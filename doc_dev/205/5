<TEXT>  By Katie Hafner and John Markoff; Simon &amp; Schuster, 327 pp., $22.95;  THE
popular image of the computer hacker has taken a troubling turn over the past
decade -- from harmless hobbyist to computer criminal.;    The hackers of the
1960s and 1970s were computer enthusiasts who built the software and hardware
that would launch an industry. Though given to pranks, they believed strongly
in open access to computer systems and adhered to a hacker ethic that frowned
upon damaging data.;    In the 1980s, the term came to define a new generation
of electronic interlopers -- ones who penetrated computers for power or
financial gain. Though they shared their predecessors' obsession with
computers, these pranksters were often malicious, and they had no social
mission, no code of conduct. Some call them "crackers," not hackers.;    In
"Cyberpunk," Katie Hafner and John Markoff, who are wife and husband, examine
this darker generation of computer hacker by focusing on the three most
notorious high-tech outlaws of the 1980s. Hafner, a former high-tech reporter
for Business Week, and Markoff, who covers the computer industry for the New
York Times, have burrowed deeply into the computer underground and emerged
with a captivating account.;    The first study in computer crime is the story
of Kevin Mitnick, the shy, overweight Southern California teen who has come to
typify this new generation.;    A loner who came from a broken family, Mitnick
started as a "phone phreak," using stolen access codes for free long-distance
calling. Intoxicated by the power and attention it gave him, Mitnick moved on
to far more sophisticated high jinks on the phone and computer networks.;   
Along with his companions, Mitnick penetrated an extraordinary number of
computers, many of them in the Bay Area. They destroyed data on computers at
U.S. Leasing in San Francisco; invaded the systems of Santa Cruz Operation, a
software developer; and stole proprietary software from Digital Equipment
Corp.'s computers in Palo Alto. Mitnick, the authors note, was a master of
"social engineering," the art of persuading secretaries and bureaucratic
functionaries to relinquish computer access codes by posing as their
superiors.;    In many ways the most fascinating account of "Cyberpunk" is the
story of Pengo, a young West Berlin computer hacker named for a video arcade
game, and his loose-knit West German hacking ring. Of all the characters in
this book, they come closest to the authors' idea of "cyberpunks," a
description borrowed from science fiction writer William Gibson.;    Drawn
together by an obsession with computers, a love of science fiction and a taste
for hashish, Pengo and his companions hatched a scheme to sell their hacking
skills to the Soviets. They seem to have been motivated more by the allure of
riches than a desire to equalize the balance of powers. The hackers, the
authors reveal, often duped their technically unsophisticated KGB contact,
earning top dollar for what in many cases was free, public-domain software.;  
 This account, of course, is the other side of the electronic sleuthing story
told by Clifford Stoll in "The Cuckoo's Egg." Stoll tracked one of the West
German hackers after he penetrated the computers at Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratories. Stoll, a Berkeley liberal now lionized by many in the computer
security field, was "a bit of a crank" for calling in the FBI and the CIA to
investigate the hackers, the authors say.;    Old-school hacker;  "Cyberpunk"
concludes with the story of Robert T. Morris Jr., the gifted Cornell grad
student who unleashed a computer "worm" that paralyzed computers across the
country. The inclusion of Morris complicates the book, for although Morris'
worm will be remembered as one of the most notorious computer "crimes" of the
decade, it rapidly becomes apparent that Morris doesn't belong in the company
of a Mitnick or a Pengo.;    Morris is a hacker much more of the old school.
The son of an eccentric, brilliant mathematician, Morris grew up joyriding
around his father's computers at Bell Labs, something like learning to drive
on a Lamborghini. Shy and insecure, Morris was a first-rate programmer by the
time he began his freshman year at Harvard University.;    With a reputation
for witty, harmless pranks, Morris wrote a program that was intended partly as
a show of his programming prowess and partly to prove a point about security
holes in Berkeley Unix, a widely used software environment. His program was
designed to quietly insert a single copy of itself onto computers on the
Internet, a national computer network.;    But because of a programming error,
the "worm" replicated faster than Morris had intended, clogging 6,000
computers on the Internet within hours after he had unleashed it. Although the
damage was extensive, it was the result of an innocent error.;    Pioneering
reporting;  "Cyberpunk" is well-written and thoroughly reported, drawing on
interviews with the hackers themselves, their families and law enforcement
officials. One gets the sense that Hafner and Markoff are breaking new ground,
particularly in the West German hacking case. (For example, it has been
suggested that the bizarre self-immolation of one of the hackers was not a
suicide but a KGB assassination. The authors provide evidence that the death
indeed was probably the act of a deeply troubled young man.);    Yet the book
only skims the surface of the broader questions raised by the cases it has
examined. What accounts for this dark turn in the image of the computer
hacker? What implications do these characters and their crimes have for a
society that relies more and more on computers? How have these cases helped
define the concepts of privacy and freedom in the electronic world? Whatever
impact these outlaws on the computer frontier will have is speculation, but it
is speculation that the authors are richly qualified to make. It's a
disappointment that they didn't try.  </TEXT>
