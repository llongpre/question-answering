<HEAD>East German Ex-Spy Chief Says KGB May Be New Boss for Some</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Markus Wolf, East Germany's
celebrated former spy chief, was quoted Friday as saying some former
agents may now be working for the Soviet KGB.
   However, Wolf said he thought any such defections were individual
cases, rather than the result of wholesale recruitment, according to
an interview in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper of Munich.
   Wolf called for a meeting of officials from both Germanys to try
to resolve the problem of inner-German espionage. He predicted the
longer it takes to resolve how a united Germany deals with former
Communist spies, the greater the danger even more East German agents
will defect to other spy networks.
   Wolf, 67, recently returned to East Berlin from Moscow, where he
said he went to finish work on a book. West German counter-espionage
officials alleged he was meeting with the KGB to turn over East
Germany's spy network in West Germany.
   Wolf retired in 1987 as head of foreign intelligence in Communist
East Germany's Security Ministry, where he gained a reputation as
one of the most skilled intelligence chiefs in the East bloc.
   West Germany has an arrest warrant out for him for his espionage
activities, but Wolf is protected as long as the two Germansy remain
separate countries. West German officials have not yet decided how
they will handle East German spies after unification.
   The Munich Abendzeitung newspaper on Friday quoted Guenther
Beckstein, a senior official in the Bavarian Interior Ministry, as
saying East Germany should hand Wolf over to West Germany for
prosecution.
   Beckstein likened Wolf's case to that of suspected terrorist
Susanne Albrecht, who was captured by East German authorities in
East Berlin on Wednesday and is expected to be turned over to West
Germany next week.
   In Bonn, spokesman Roland Bachmeier of the West German Interior
Ministry said a meeting of the two German interior ministers in
April provided the information that led to Albrecht's capture. West
German authorities had sought Ms. Albrecht, a suspected member of
the leftist Red Army faction, for 13 years.
   The Red Army faction has been blamed for a wave of terror in West
Germany since the early 1970s.
