   A Canadian woman conspired with dozens of
computer hackers across the United States, some as young as 14, in
a scheme to steal as much as $1.5 million in goods, services and
cash, authorities said Thursday.
   Leslie Lynn Doucette, 35, was charged with conspiring to steal
telephone and computer service, the U.S. attorney's office said.
She was charged with trafficking in illegal credit cards and
telephone calling-card numbers on corporate and government
voice-mail computers.
   Ms. Doucette, arrested Wednesday in Chicago, is from Toronto,
and was convicted in Canada in 1987 of telecommunications fraud,
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Cook.
   Authorities believe her operation involved at least 50 people in
several states, Cook said.
   Federal agents have questioned pairs of teen-agers in Columbus,
Ohio; Sterling Heights, Mich.; and Boston; and they impounded the
computer equipment of a 15-year-old in Marietta, Ga., authorities
said. Search warrants also were issued in Los Angeles, Cook said.
   U.S. Magistrate Joan Lefkow ordered Ms. Doucette, whose two
children live with her, held without bond at least temporarily,
Cook said.
   Earlier in the four-month investigation, ``she called the
attorney general's office in Arizona and indicated ... they weren't
going to be able to locate her,'' Cook said.
   If convicted, Ms. Doucette faces up to 10 years in prison for
illegal use of computer-access devices, 5 years for wire fraud and
5 years for conspiracy, Cook said.
   In Sterling Heights, Mich., Secret Service agents questioned two
eighth-graders said to have admitted belonging to the hacking
network. The 14-year-old boys ``got hooked because of their
fascination with the medium,'' said James Huse of the Secret
Service's Detroit office.
   One of the boys ran up a $3,800 phone bill for April because he
mistakenly thought he was making free long-distance calls, Huse
said.
   Authorities estimated the value of goods and services obtained
illegally by the network to be between $200,000 and $1.5 million.
Huse said investigators still had to sort through evidence to find
out what the hackers ordered with other people's credit cards, and
how much revenue long-distance companies lost.
   Court documents in Chicago charged that Ms. Doucette, using the
code-name ``Kyrie,'' infiltrated electronic ``mailboxes'' in which
businesses store and exchange information and messages.
   The hackers communicated with each other through companies'
private mailboxes to avoid the scrutiny police have been giving to
public ``bulletin boards,'' the forums where computer users
normally share information, authorities said.
   The hackers used their computers to program their telephones to
keep dialing until they got into an electronic mailbox, prosecutors
said. There they found codes that gave them access to other
computers or telephone services, credit card numbers and other data.
   Ms. Doucette, for example, obtained at least $1,000 in money
orders purchased from Western Union with credit cards whose numbers
she passed on to other hackers, Cook said.
   Home Box Office and RCA Telephone System Sales also suffered
losses, Huse said.
