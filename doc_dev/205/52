   A former U.S. Army sergeant
arrested in West Germany headed an international spy ring that sold
NATO defense secrets to the Soviets at high prices for a decade,
officials said Thursday.
   ``We can't exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are
involved,'' said Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the chief
federal prosecutor's office.
   A second American soldier who was not identified received a
``five-figure sum'' of money for supplying the ring with military
secrets, said Chief Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann, and Prechtel
said two Hungarian-born brothers arrested Tuesday in Sweden with
cipher keys, coded messages and radios were a part of the ring.
   It was too early to know how much damage was caused to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, Prechtel said in an interview, but
the ring is believed to have stolen documents concerning NATO
defense plans for Europe and U.S. Army contingency plans for a
ground war with the Soviet Union in Europe.
   Clyde Lee Conrad, the former sergeant, was arrested Tuesday, and
a statement from the prosecutor's office said he was charged with
``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially
grave case.''
   The New York Times in its Friday editions quoted officials as
saying Conrad gave away information on rocket bases and a secret
NATO oil pipeline in West Germany to resupply tanks. The report
from Washington did not identify the officials.
   Conrad was born in 1947 in Ohio and worked for the U.S. military
for 20 years, Prechtel said. Army records list his hometown as
Sebring, Ohio.
   He worked as an infantryman and then as an ``administration
specialist'' during his active duty, according to his service
records released in Washington. Conrad received the National
Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, five Army
Commendation medals, the Army Achievement Medal, three Meritorious
Service medals and seven Good Conduct medals.
   Prechtel said Conrad worked with classified military defense
plans for seven years at a U.S. Army base in Bad Kreuznach, in
central West Germany, and had access to a wide array of secret
documents. Conrad allegedly continued espionage work after he left
the service in 1985, Prechtel said.
   Rebmann said Conrad turned over the most recent batch of
information to his Soviet bloc contact in Vienna just last month.
   Cable News Network on Thursday quoted unidentified West German
sources as saying Conrad systematically photographed files between
1980 and 1985. The CNN report said investigators believe he may
have transferred material onto a personal computer, which was
seized at his home.
   Espionage cases are common in West Germany, where Soviet bloc
agents are active and sometimes are caught. But allegations of deep
involvement by an American citizen in a West German-based ring are
extremely rare.
   An official at the U.S. Justice Department, speaking on
condition of anonymity, called the case ``a serious encroachment on
our national security.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan had
been kept informed about the investigation ``on a continuing
basis.'' But he added, ``We won't have any response or reaction at
this point. We're looking into it.''
   A special panel of West Germany's Supreme Court ordered Conrad
held in prison pending further investigation, Rebmann said.
   Prechtel said the West German-based spy ring started in the late
1970s and used couriers from Sweden.
   In Goteborg, Sweden, authorities said they detained two
Hungarian-born brothers who confessed to working for the Hungarian
secret service.
   The two men, physicians who immigrated to Sweden in the 1960s,
were detained with radios, cipher keys and coded messages,
authorities said. Their names were not released.
   The New York Times reported Thursday that eight people were
arrested by Swedish and West German in the ring operating through a
German-Hungarian connection.
   The report said investigators believe the spy ring provided
U.S., West German and NATO secrets to the Hungarian intelligence
agency. The Hungarians then shared the secrets with the Soviet
Union, officials told the Times.
   Prechtel, speaking from his office in the city of Karlsruhe,
confirmed virtually all of the Times report. But he said
``several'' people were taken into custody or arrested and could
not confirm that the number was eight.
   The Times said the network was uncovered by West German and U.S.
officials, including agents from the FBI and the Army. The Army has
about 250,000 military personnel in West Germany at more than 200
installations and frequently warns its personnel to beware of
Soviet bloc spies.
   Rebmann said Conrad ``is under compelling suspicion of having
delivered ... documents to a Soviet bloc secret service by means of
a command officer and couriers living abroad in return for high
payments.''
   He did not identify the command officer but said the two last
met in Vienna last month when Conrad allegedly again handed over
secret documents for payment.
   After his retirement, Conrad tried to recruit other soldiers for
espionage, Rebmann said.
   ``He recruited another member of the U.S. Army for espionage
work and paid him a five-figure sum for the delivery of military
documents,'' Rebmann's statement said. The type of currency was not
disclosed.
   The prosecutor's spokesman declined to release any further
information about the second soldier.
