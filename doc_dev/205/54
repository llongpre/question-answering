Federal prosecutors dropped charges Friday against a free-lance journalist who 
was arrested for allegedly trying to steal information from the computers of 
Fox Television's tabloid show "A Current Affair," but hours later he faced 
similar "computer hacking" charges in state court. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Goldman, 44, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court and was released on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman was arrested March 8 at his Studio City apartment, where Los Angeles 
police confiscated his personal computer and floppy disks. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, federal and state officials announced that Goldman had attempted 
to steal sensitive information from Fox computers in New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Fox officials told authorities that someone had been trying to gain access to 
their computers and that the hacker used the same computer password in both 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman had worked briefly for "A Current Affair," a show that offers a mix of 
gossip and news. Goldman also worked for a competing show called "Hard Copy." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors filed an affidavit in U.S. District Court in New York last 
month stating that Goldman had attempted to gain access to sensitive files 
regarding news stories worked on by Fox journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Neither law enforcement nor Fox officials have said what information they 
believe Goldman was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman recently tried to sell an inside story on so-called tabloid television 
shows to the Los Angeles Times. On Friday, Goldman said the research on his 
article was complete, but declined to say if he had found someone to publish 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman's attorney, Alan Rubin of West Los Angeles, said Friday morning that he 
had persuaded the U.S. attorney's office in New York to drop the federal 
charges there. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors would not comment on why the charges in New York were 
dropped. Fox spokesman Dennis Petroskey also declined any comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, the district attorney's office charged Goldman with seven 
felony counts of violating the California Penal Code section prohibiting 
unauthorized access to computers. Goldman used another person's access code to 
gain entry to a Fox television computer at Channel 11 in Hollywood, according 
to Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. She said 
Goldman used telephone lines to extract material from Fox computers and place 
it into his home computer. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, who has written articles for National Review magazine and the Los 
Angeles Times, among other publications, faces a maximum six-year prison term 
if convicted on all charges, Gibbons said.
