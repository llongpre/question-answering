   A hacker who browsed for weeks through
the unclassified computer system of a top federal nuclear weapons
laboratory has been identified and has apologized to authorities.
   No arrests have been made, officials said Saturday. FBI and lab
officials refused to identify the hacker.
   ``In a communication, he regretted the difficulty caused by his
actions and agreed to stop accessing LLNL computers,'' said Jeff
Garberson, spokesman at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
   Lab officials had pleaded through local media for the hacker to
contact them. The pleas led to several phone calls identifying
possible suspects, but it was unclear if the identity of the hacker
was discovered through a tip.
   A spokesman said earlier in the week that the hacker did not
invade the lab's top secret nuclear weapons research computers,
which are physically and electronically separated from the
unclassified system.
   The lab, run by the University of California at Berkeley, is one
of the nation's two centers for design, manufacture and testing of
nuclear weapons. The other is at Los Alamos, N.M.
   The FBI is investigating the case, spokesman John Holford said.
   Garberson said because criminal charges may be filed, lab
officials will not provide any further information.
   The hacker first appeared on the lab's Internet system about two
weeks ago. The system connects research facilities and universities
nationwide.
   The hacker accessed various computers at the lab and even gave
himself ``super user'' status so he could roam through files.
However, no data or files were destroyed.
   Lab officials described him as ``joy riding'' through the system
to see what he could get into. He made at least 11 system
trespasses, the last on Dec. 10.
   The infiltration is on the same system that was invaded by a
computer ``virus'' that struck nationwide last month and by another
hacker two weeks ago. Both of the latest invasions were through
different holes in the system and there may yet be other access
points that have not been patched.
