   The legal system has failed to respond adequately
to the threat that computer hackers pose to the computer networks
that are crucial to corporate America, a computer expert says.
   Many computer hackers ``are given slaps on the wrist,'' Mark
Leary, a senior analyst with International Data Corp., said at a
Tuesday roundtable discussion.
   ``The justice system has to step up ... to the fact that these
people are malicious and are criminals and are robbing banks just
as much as if they walked up with a shotgun,'' he said.
   Other panelists complained that hackers, because of their
abilities at breaking into computer system, are even given jobs,
sometimes as security consultants.
   The experts spoke at a roundtable sponsored by Network World
magazine, a publication targeted at computer network users and
managers.
   Compr networks have become crucial to business, fromnd compiling information
to overseeing and running
manufacturing processes.
   The public alss increasingly exposed to networks through such
devices as automatic teller machines at banks, airline reservation
systems and company computers that store billing information.
   Companies became more willing to spend money on computer
security after last year's celebrated invasion of a nationwide
computer network by a computer virus allegedly unleashed by araduate student,
the experts said.
   ``The incident caused us to reassess the priorities with which
we look at certain threats,'' said Dennis Steinaur, manager of the
compcurity management group of the National InstitutTechnology.
   But computer security is not only a matter of gagainst
unauthorized entry, according to Max Hoe president
for information systems at American Airlines.
   Hopper said American has built ``a Cheyenne Moun
installation for its computer systems to guard against a varietf
problems, including electrical failure and natural disaster.g to the Defense
Department's underground nerve center
inside aColorado mountain, he said American's precautione a three-day supply
of food.
   ``We've done everything we caect the total
environment,'' Hopper said.
   Hopper and Steinaur said that despite the high-tech image of
computer terrorism, it remains an administrative problem that
should be approached as a routine management issue.
   But the experts agreed that the greatest danger to computer
networks does not come from outside hackers. Instead, they said,
the biggesthreat is from disgruntled employees or others whose
original access to systems was legitimate.
   While screening of potential employees is uSteinaur said,
it is more important to build within computer systems ways to track
unauthorized use and to publicize that hacking can be found out and
traced.
   But Steinaur said growing computer literay, plus the activities
of some non-malicious hackers, help security managers in some
respects.
   Expanded knowledge ``forces us as security managers not to be
dependent on ignorance,'' S
   ``Security needs to be a part of the system, rather than a
`nuisance addition,''' Steinaur said, ``and we probably have not
done a very good job of making management realize that security is
an integral part of the system.''
   IDC's Leary said the organization's surveys of Fortune 1000
companies surprisingly found a signiumber of companies were
doing little to protect their systems.
   The discussion, the first of three planned by Network World, was
held because computer sabotage ``is a real problem that p
aren't aware of,'' said editor John Gallant. Many business people
believe sabotage cases ``are glamorous incidents that happen to
sophisticated networks.''
   Also, it is a problem that many industry vendors are reluctant
to address, he said, because it raises questions about a company's
reliability.
   ``Data can be restored, but it takes years to rebuild public
confidence,'' he said.
   Gallant said the magazine had tried and failed to get computors on
the discussion panels.
   ``They don't  in the public eye,'' he said. He
declined to say who turned doinvitations.
