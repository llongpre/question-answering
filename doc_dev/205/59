<P>
A computer hacker from Panorama City, who was considered such a danger that 
prison guards supervised his phone calls to prevent him from accessing 
computers, pleaded guilty today to two felony counts that could imprison him 
for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitnick pleaded guilty to one count of possessing 16 unauthorized 
long-distance telephone codes and one count of computer fraud for gaining 
access to a Massachusetts computer company's system and stealing a security 
program. Mitnick, 25, will be imprisoned for 12 months and subjected to 
intensive supervision for three years after his release if the agreement is 
approved by U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer. She scheduled sentencing for 
April 24. 
</P>
<P>
When Mitnick was arrested, prosecutors insisted he posed such a threat to 
national computer security that he must be held without bail. Prison guards 
have been dialing the phone for him so he does not access computers.
