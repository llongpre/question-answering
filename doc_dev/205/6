   A Harvard astronomer turned sleuth helped crack an
international electronic spy ring in West Germany by tracking down
the ``hacker'' who broke into his computer files.
   For more than six months, finding the computer snoop was a lonely
obsession for 38-year-old Clifford Stoll, who initially was unable
to convince the FBI to investigate the computer break-in.
   On Thursday, a West German official announced the arrests of
three hackers who allegedly acquired sensitive military computer
passwords and codes and sold them to the Soviets. The Pentagon has
not determined the extent of the damage to U.S. security.
   A West German television network said the passwords and other
information came from key military and research computers in the
United States, Western Europe and Japan.
   ``I would say (Stoll) was largely responsible for cracking the
case,'' said Charles S. Hurley, former spokesman for the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., where Stoll once worked.
``Over a period of many months, he tracked them.''
   It all started with a 75-cent accounting error that Stoll noticed
in the California laboratory's shared-time computer system accounts
in August 1986.
   ``If it had been $1,000 off, I wouldn't have thought anything of
it,'' Stoll said in an interview Thursday. ``It's like, if your
house collapses, you just assume there's been an earthquake. But if
you find a tiny termite hole, you think, `Geez, I'd better
investigate.' It's the little problems that are the most
fascinating.''
   Stoll, a computer expert with a doctorate in astronomy from the
University of Arizona, searched for clues for three days and
discovered the error was caused by someone who had gained access to
the computer through telephone lines.
   ``For four months, I did absolutely nothing but watch what he
typed in,'' said the bushy-haired Stoll.
   Stoll said it became apparent that the hacker was trying to use
the Berkeley Laboratory's computer as a gateway to the so-called
Milnet, a computer network linking defense plants, university labs
and military installations.
   ``He was searching for key words like nuclear, ICBM, SDI,
biological warfare, Norad. He was reading everything he could get
his hands on, and then it turns out he was selling it to the
Soviets,'' Stoll said.
   He said he told the FBI about the hacker in the late summer of
1986, but there wasn't much of a response.
   ``They said, `What have you lost?' I said, `Well, all we've
actually lost is 75 cents.' So the FBI said, `Who cares, it's not
important.'''
   To be fair, Stoll added, ``They're much more sensitive to
computer break-ins now.''
   Charles Steinmetz, a spokesman for the FBI in Washington, said
the bureau would not comment on the case.
   Stoll said his girlfriend, tired of his electronic pager that
would beep whenever the hacker got onto the system, was responsible
for the big break in the case. She suggested that he lay a trap.
   He created bogus military data and a fictitious computer network
called ``SDI Net.'' The hacker took the bait, spending two hours
reading through the material, giving Stoll enough time to trace the
call to Hanover, West Germany.
   Three months later, Stoll said, he got a letter from a man in
Pittsburgh asking for information about SDI Net. When he turned that
letter over to the FBI in April 1987, he said, the bureau found the
man had connections to Eastern European governments and immediately
began an investigation.
   In all, Stoll said the spy ring had attempted to break into about
450 different computers and succeeded in stealing information from
more than 40 of them _ including data systems at the Pentagon,
defense contracting firms and U.S. military bases around the world.
   According to a German television network, authorities believe the
West German hackers were recruited by the Soviet KGB in 1985 and
``were paid with cash and drugs ... and were later forced to provide
the codes and passwords to the Soviets.''
   Stoll now has a contract from Doubleday Inc. to write a book
about his not-so-amateur sleuthing.
   But he said he is glad the case is nearing an end so he can get
back to work at the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in
Cambridge, Mass.
   ``In one sense, it was exciting,'' he said. ``In another sense,
it was dreadful, because I got zero astronomy done for two years.''
