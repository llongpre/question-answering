   A computer hacker charged with infiltrating
systems in the United States and England, was declared ``a very,
very great danger to the community'' Tuesday by a judge who renewed
his imprisonment without bail.
   U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer made her ruling after
Kevin David Mitnick, 25, pleaded innocent to computer fraud charges
and his attorney urged the judge to release him on bail.
   Attorney Alan Rubin argued that Mitnick is ``being held
incommunicado'' and is being treated more harshly than men charged
with violent crimes.
   ``My client is being portrayed as some sort of Machiavellian
figure _ either out of government paranoia ... or some other
government agenda I'm not aware of,'' said attorney Alan Rubin.
   Rubin accused the government of exaggerating the seriousness of
the case and suggested that Mitnick be released to his family with a
tap placed on his telephone.
   But the judge, citing Mitnick's previous misdemeanor conviction
on a similar computer related crime, rejected that suggestion.
``Isn't it highly likely he'll do it again?'' she asked.
   Rubin insisted he wouldn't repeat the action. A Mitnick associate
who turned him in has told of the young man's genius with computers
and his alleged ability to tap into computers operated by the
National Security Agency, among others.
   The super-secret NSA is responsible for electronic eavesdropping,
gathering data from U.S. spy satellites and conducting sophisticated
signals intelligence.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Leon Weidman, said he will file further
charges against Mitnick next week. ``We believe he's extremely
dangerous and should not be allowed any access to a computer or
telephone,'' Weidman said.
   Mitnick is being held in a maximum-security cell at the federal
Metropolitan Detention Center, where he is not allowed to make phone
calls unless he is monitored by an administrator.
   A federal grand jury indicted him Dec. 20 on computer fraud
charges. He is accused of unauthorized use of MCI long-distance
codes to tap into computers at Leeds University in England and the
University of Southern California, and of causing $4 million damage
to a Digital Equipment Corp. computer system.
   Leonard DiCicco, 23, an associate who reported Mitnick to
authorities, has described the defendant as ``a big fat slob of a
guy who couldn't get through a day without breaking into a computer
somewhere.''
   ``It's scary to think of the things he's capable of,'' said
DiCicco.
   The 5-11, 240-pound Mitnick, clad in a khaki prison uniform,
answered, ``Not guilty,'' twice when asked for his plea to the
charges against him.
   His trial was tentatively set for Feb. 21 but Judge Pfaelzer said
that would be changed if a new indictment is filed.
   ``I have no doubt that he is a very, very great danger to the
community,'' she said. ``I also believe he is a flight risk.''
   She ordered restrictions on his telephone use to remain in effect.
   When Rubin objected to Mitnick being housed in a high security
area of the prison, Ms. Pfaelzer declared: ``The court thinks high
security is entirely appropriate with this defendant.''
   Rubin said he believed authorities were reacting to ``technology
fear and other reports of computer viruses'' elsewhere in the nation.
   Mitnick reportedly used the code name ``Condor'' in his
electronic activities, taking the name from the 1975 film ``Three
Days of the Condor,'' in which Robert Redford played a CIA
researcher and telephone expert.
   DiCicco contends that Mitnick is obsessed with two things _ fast
food and computers. ``All he did was eat Fat Burgers, drink Slurpees
and work on computers,'' DiCicco said.
