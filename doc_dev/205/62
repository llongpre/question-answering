   Federal police today smashed a
computer-hacking ring and arrested three young men following
complaints from the FBI about illegal intrusions into university
computer systems in the United States.
   The three were charged in Melbourne Court with damaging data in
government computers, which is punishable with a maximum of 10
years in jail. Their identities were not made available but police
said they ranged in age from 18 to 21.
   A police spokesman said the suspects were arrested following
raids earlier in the day in which computers were put out of action
to prevent the destruction of software.
   The arrests followed a six-month investigation conducted jointly
by Australian federal police, the FBI and police in the state of
Victoria.
   Federal police alleged the three hackers _ using the codenames
Phoenix, Electron and Nom _ hacked into universities and
laboratories in Australia and overseas.
   Police said it was the biggest Australian-based computer hacking
operation uncovered so far.
   U.S. investigators first discovered an Australian-based hacker
was at work in 1988 when it was found the Citibank system had been
illegally entered. Further reports of extensive illegal entry to
U.S. computers followed throughout last year.
   A Federal Police spokesman said their investigation began in
earnest only six months ago after the Commonwealth Crimes Act was
approved last July covering offenses on illegal computer use.
