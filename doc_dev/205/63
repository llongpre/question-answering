   A 12-year-old computer hacker is accused of
gaining access to the computers of TRW Inc., a national company
that checks customers' credit ratings, and distributing charge card
numbers to computer bulletin boards.
   State police said today that authorities were preparing to
submit a petition to Wayne County Probate Court to charge the youth
of computer fraud and financial transaction fraud.
   The boy's computer and files were seized Thursday from his
Grosse Ile home, said Lt. Tom Meekins, of the Michigan State Police
Criminal Investigation Division.
   ``It won't be hard to prove,'' Meekins said. ``The records we
have indicate he was deeply involved.''
   Authorities talked to the boy in his home but not take him into
custody or charge him, Meekins said. Federal authorities had
originally said that the boy was arrested and charged, but that is
incorrect, Meekins said.
   Authorities were uncertain how many files were tapped, who used
the credit card numbers, and what was purchased with them, said
Michigan State Police Lt. Chris Hogan. But officials said TRW
officials noticed the improper entry to their system and contacted
authorities.
   ``TRW's still trying to figure that one out,'' he said.
   TRW Consumer Relations Supervisor Jean Stevens was not in her
Farmington Hills office this morning to comment, her secretary said.
   The Michigan Computer Crime Task Force of state and federal
authorities said the boy broke through TRW security at a
Detroit-area branch.
   ``Hacking is a common problem and is proliferating as the
computer industry improves and home computers are more available,''
said U.S. Secret Service Special Agent John Britt in Detroit. ``But
tapping into TRW is a new twist and pretty sophisticated.''
   The boy's mother said the family owned the computer for several
years and friends of her son recently taught him how to use it. He
worked on it for up to five hours every weeknight and up to 14
hours on weekends, she said.
   ``He didn't bother me,'' she said. ``He sat there on his
computer. Well, I figured, computers, that's the thing of the day.''
