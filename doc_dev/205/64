   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The infection proved curable, at a hefty cost. No
sensitive secrets were penetrated. But the anguish a now-famous
computer virus produced last November has led to soul-searching
about computer security. The fact is that the machines are
vulnerable to all sorts of interference, from playful hackers to
sophisticated criminals. Second of three articles.

   The bad news is that computers get
diseases.
   The worse news is that when they do, the illness can spread at
the speed of light, leaving everything from household accounts to
business data to power plants to defense systems fatally stricken.
   Apocalypse now? It's not just a movie.
   ``There's a potential risk that matches the destructiveness of a
nuclear attack,'' warns Donn Parker, an authority on computer crime
at SRI International here.
   In only a few short years, computers have become the bedrock of
how the United States and, increasingly, the developed world
operate. Computers handle half a trillion dollars in U.S. bank
transfers a day. They guide planes through the air and back to land.
They monitor hospital patients, predict weather, run phone systems,
plant crops and check the results out of supermarkets, store any
data imaginable. Your bank balance. The national debt. When a
computer gets sniffles, a whole system can catch pneumonia.
   Computer technology advances almost daily. So do the techniques
of computer security. So do the threats of someone, witting or
unwitting, monkey-wrenching whole systems.
   Computers get sick for the same reasons humans catch flu or VD.
They interconnect. The illnesses bear the same familiar names that
attack people: worms, bugs, viruses. They work the same way,
invading a system and replicating or infiltrating until the body is
overwhelmed.
   A worm broadly believed to have been planted last November by
Cornell grad student Robert Morris within hours fouled up some 6,000
interconnected computers in a defense-university network. Estimates
of the damage done and the man-hours spent to repair it run from $20
to $95 million.
   The origins of computer disease vary. Begin with the hacker, the
computer junkie who spends every waking minute bopping around in
computerland exploring its fascinations. Then come the mischievous,
then the malicious and then the outright criminal: the embezzler,
the corporate spy. What Donn Parker fears is the arrival,
eventually, of the terrorist.
   Some case histories of computer illness, benign and less so:
   In 1986 then Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir was about to
give a speech which said:
   ``Let us say yes to a great, massive, successful and victorious
Herut movement.''
   Just before delivery it was discovered an otherwise-minded
employee had wormed his way into Shamir's computer and changed the
text to read:
   ``Let us say yes to a tiny, worrying and incompetent Herut
movement.''
   In Fort Worth, Texas, an uneasy employee planted a ``time bomb''
in his company computer. Any time his name did not appear,
indicating he'd been fired, the hidden instruction would activate,
destroying the firm's files.
   About five years ago in New York, students at the exclusive
Dalton School found their way into the computers at the
Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research. They were discovered
before they could do any damage, intended or inadvertent, to medical
files.
   In Hayward, Calif., a rapist used a computer to get the addresses
of women he attacked by tracing their license plates through state
files to which he had access. In the Equity Funding scandal of the
'70s, a ring used computers to steal some $70 million.
   Besides the federal government, 48 states have laws against
computer crime. The remaining two, Vermont and West Virginia, are
considering introducing legislation this year.
   ``In effect, the laws say thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not do
damage and thou shalt not trespass,'' said Jay BloomBecker, who runs
the National Institute for Computer Crime Data in Los Angeles. He
estimates computer crime may have reached the billions-a-year level
in the United States. ``The problem is getting society to treat
computer crime as it does other crimes.''
   Computers are a natural for disease and crime because they are
vulnerable. They are vulnerable because their usefulness is
magnified many times over when they talk to each other to exchange
news or data or memory. Unfortunately, that means they can share
infection.
   ``A network is for exchange of information,'' says Richard
Koenig, associate director of the Computer Security Institute in
Northborough, Mass. ``If it needs a lot of security, you defeat its
purpose.''
   ``Any communication designed for easy access is subject to
tampering,'' says Bill Cunningham, head of management information
systems for The Associated Press.
   To stop tampering or worse, Koenig foresees the day when access
to computer networks will be encoded like a scrambler phone. But
that only makes computers even more intimidating to the unpracticed
layman than they already are. It's a dilemma.
   To the hacker, it's more likely a challenge. ``The more complex a
system gets, the more nooks and crannies for hackers to try and get
into,'' says Tom Mandel, a computer futurist at SRI. This is not to
point a finger at hackers. Quite the contrary. Their contribution to
technology is inestimable. They push machines beyond their designed
limits to new horizons. Their genius with software is one reason the
United States leads the world in that technology.
