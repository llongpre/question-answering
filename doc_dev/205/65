   So far, the country has been lucky. There have
been viruses, worms, logic bombs, Trojan Horses and other computer
scams but no successful, systematic attempt to subvert the systems
that are so essential to modern society.
   However, says an expert on computer security, ``there is reason
to believe our luck may soon run out unless we take action now.''
   A committee of the National Research Council spent 1{ years
looking into the state of computer security and found systems and
information in danger, and society, in turn, at risk. It issued a
300-page report Wednesday, titled ``Computers at Risk.''
   ``We have in many cases left computer systems unprotected from a
wide variety of current and future threats to their integrity,''
committee chairman David D. Clark told a news conference.
   ``National computing and communications systems are vulnerable
to potentially catastrophic ecurity breaches and accidental
failures,'' he said. Contending that the nation has been lucky, he
said, ``The committee concludes that tomorrow will not be like
yesterday.''
   Horrible examples abound:
   -For 10 months in the mid-1980s, a West German nicknamed ``Wily
Hacker'' attacked 450 computers operated by the U.S. military and
its contractors, successfully gaining access to 30. He allegedly
had ties to the Soviet KGB, the NRC report says, and it was assumed
he was looking for sensitive data.
   -In 1988 a ``worm'' paralyzed thousands of computers in the
Internet, a network that links 60,000 computer systems used in
university and other research. Robert Morris of Arnold, Md., is
appealing his conviction in federal court for unleashing the
program.
   -A software design error froze much of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph's long distance network.
   -The German Chaos Computer Club broke into the NASA Space
Physics Analysis Network.
   -An error in computer software controlling a radiation therapy
machine, a Therac 25 linear accelerator, resulted in at least three
patient deaths.
   -More than 26,000 diskettes that featured AIDS prevention
information but were infected with a hidden computer virus were
mailed to hospitals, businesses and government agencies worldwide.
   There have been thousands of reported virus attacks and hundreds
of different viruses identified, such as Stoned, Devil's Dance,
1260, Jerusalem, Yankee Doodle, Pakistani Brain, Icelandic-2, Ping
Pong and December 24, the committee said.
   A ``virus'' is a computer program, usually hidden, that attaches
itself to other programs and has the ability to reproduce itself.
Viruses generally are ``Trojan Horse'' programs which, when
executed, result in undesired side effects unexpected by the user.
``Logic bombs'' are Trojan horses activated by a particular event
in the computer, perhaps even the occurrence of a particular date.
   A ``worm'' is a program that distributes itself in multiple
copies within a system or into connected systems. A worm attack
might exploit security vulnerabilities in a system or cause denial
of service to the computer user.
   Clark said the committee, which had 16 members from
universities, industry, computer manufacturers and security firms,
is concerned about a blase attitude among most in the U.S. business
community.
   ``Many people still use easy-to-guess passwords such as their
first name, or they use common English words that can be `guessed'
by a determined hacker with a computerized dictionary,'' he said.
``Attacks based on these weaknesses are commonplace today.''
   The committee recommended six key actions, a major one being
creation of a private, non-profit organization to develop system
security principles, supporting research, maintain a tracking
system of threats and foster training of computer security agents.
   ``The modern thief can steal more with a computer than with a
gun,'' the NRC report says. ``Tomorrow's terrorist may be able to
do more damage with a keyboard than with a bomb.
   ``Thus far we have relied on the absence of malicious people who
are both capable and motivated. We can no longer do so. We must
instead attempt to build computer systems that are secure and
trustworthy.''
