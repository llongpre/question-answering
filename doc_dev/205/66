<BYLINE>Cold War Is Over; Where Are All the Spies?

   The Cold War is over, but not all the spies have
come in.
   Markus Wolf, the East German master spy, may be in Moscow, maybe
not. Klaus Kuron, who tracked Wolf's operatives for West Germany,
is accused of being a double agent.
   Germany was a crossroads for spies in the 1930s and became a
hive of espionage after World War II, when Hitler's secret agents
went to work for East or West, depending on where they were
captured.
   Spies penetrated the highest ranks on both sides; a West German
chancellor was brought down when his top aide was exposed as a
Communist agent. There was a saying in intelligence circles that
West Germany had more spies per acre than any place in the world.
   Some were captured and exchanged. They walked across Glienicke,
the ``bridge of spies'' that spans the Havel River, passing each
other without turning their heads. It is easy to imagine the ghosts
of George Smiley and Karla lurking there on a silent, snowy night.
   What of the future? Cold War or no, Germany is the center of
Europe, the powerhouse that will drive the continent. Whether for
industrial, political or military purposes, the spies are certain
to be here.
   Lutz Stavenhagen, security aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
believes some will be from Moscow because what goes on in the new
Germany is ``of enormous interest for the Soviets.''
   Even Bonn, the dowdy little capital on the Rhine, has long
exuded an atmosphere of intrigue.
   Communist spies infiltrated government offices, including the
chancellery. Guenter Guillaume attached himself to Chancellor Willy
Brandt, the architect of ``ostpolitik,'' the opening the the East,
and Brandt was forced to resign in 1974.
   During the war, the Allies had secret agents in the Third Reich,
gathering intelligence and aiding the resistance.
   Immediately afterward, Berlin was infested with spies, a window
of easy passage for agents hunting secrets.
   It was ``the most productive intelligence collection center in
the world,'' Peter Wyden, a German-born American author, wrote in
``Wall,'' published just before the Berlin Wall was opened last
year.
   ``Counting the delegations from Greece and Norway, 86 separate
intelligence operations stumbled over each other's tracks'' in
Berlin, he said.
   Wyden wrote that the CIA alone had 40 ``safe houses'' in Berlin
at one time, as shelters and meeting places for control officers
and their agents.
   In the mid-1950s, the CIA and Britain's MI6 undertook one of the
most extraordinary espionage operations of the Cold War, digging a
tunnel from which they tapped communications between KGB
headquarters in East Berlin and Moscow.
   According to Wyden and some other writers, the Soviets knew of
the operation and played along to protect an important ``mole'' in
Western intelligence.
   Many writers, John le Carre and Wyden among them, have
questioned the competence of Western intelligence operations in
Berlin. Wyden, for example, points out that the West was surprised
when the wall went up in August 1961.
   Le Carre transformed spies from superheroes into lonely men
plying a questionable trade. Perhaps his most dramatic evocation of
the image was in ``The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,'' when the
aging British agent Leamas and an innocent friend are shot down at
the wall, victims of a double cross.
   The list of real spies who found fame, infamy or death in
Germany seems endless.
   There was George Blake, a British agent unmasked in 1960 as one
of the most damaging sources of information for the KGB.
   Heinz ``Fiffi'' Felfe, a former Nazi SS officer hired by West
German intelligence, was considered one of the finest spy fighters
- until 1961, when he was found to be a double agent for the KGB.
   Wolf, the master spy known as ``Misha,'' ran a string of agents
and ``moles'' in West Germany who got their hands on some of NATO's
most precious secrets.
   He scored coup after coup in West Germany, sending East German
agents across the border as refugees to infiltrate government,
intelligence and industry. Wolf ran Guillaume, who ended Brandt's
career as chancellor.
   If East German agents couldn't get into the government
themselves, they went after people already there.
   Intelligence officials tell of one ``Romeo'' agent who used
several aliases in seducing West German government secretaries to
obtain secrets.
   In June at Koblenz, Clyde Lee Conrad, a retired U.S. Army
sergeant, was convicted of treason for spying. Conrad, who had been
in charge of a vault filled with classified documents, was part of
a ring that sold Army and NATO secrets to the Soviet bloc.
   Betraying the information could have started a world war, the
judge said, and sentenced Conrad to life in prison.
   Western nations ran their own espionage operations in the
Communist East, sometimes with fatal consequences.
   Double agent Horst Galau was arrested by East Germany in 1985
and died three years later in Bautzen prison. East German officials
said he hanged himself, but West German intelligence said it might
have been murder.
   Germany is united now, but spy scandals continue.
   The arrest of Klaus Kuron might have been enough to destroy the
government a few years ago. His surrender Oct. 7, however, seemed
merely to underscore the old assumption that East Germany had
seriously compromised West German intelligence.
   At least 12 other alleged spies were arrested in connection with
the Kuron case and dozens more are on the run. Officials say some
have been taken over by the KGB.
   Intelligence officers expect spying to continue in Germany, but
now that the Soviet bloc has collapsed, there is no more flavor of
a morality play.
   ``One shouldn't see this in a moralistic way,'' a German
official said. ``Fashion designers send their own snoops off to see
what the competition will have in the latest collection. That's not
much different from espionage.''
