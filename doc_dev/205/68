   A Maryland computer hacker pleaded guilty to felony
computer-crime charges, ending a year-long investigation
spanning three states by agents of the Secret Service and the
Justice Department, officials said.
   The case is the latest in a widening crackdown on computer
crime that has led to searches, computer seizures and arrests
in a dozen states. Federal agents have targeted such groups
as the "Legion of Doom," a loose-knit band of mostly young
hackers who made a sport of breaking into others' systems but
insisted they caused no damage.

   Leonard Rose Jr., 32 years old, of Middletown, Md., agreed
to plead guilty to two charges against him in Chicago and
Baltimore and will serve two concurrent, one-year prison
terms. He'll be eligible for parole in 10 months.
   The hacker cases have been closely watched because some
raise constitutional issues of free speech, attorneys said.
Mr. Rose, for example, wasn't charged with breaking into
computers or engaging in a conspiracy to do so -- he was
accused of possessing programs that could have been used by
others to break into computers. Because he pleaded guilty to
narrower charges, however, such issues weren't addressed.
   Indeed, in the plea agreement, Mr. Rose agreed only to
charges that he misappropriated, shared and modified parts of
a program called Unix, licensed by American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. While a commercial license costs $77,000, Unix
has been widely available at nominal cost for years on
college campuses and among programmers.
   Mitchell Kapor, founder and former chairman of Lotus
Development Corp., who paid for Mr. Rose's defense,
questioned the severity of Mr. Rose's sentencing. "If they
sent to prison everyone with some unlicensed Unix code, the
jails would overflow," Mr. Kapor said.
   He suggested that Mr. Rose was being made an example to
frighten other hackers. "He didn't profit from this. He used
poor judgment copying the program, but you don't send people
to prison for that."
   In a statement late Friday, Fred Foreman, the U.S.
Attorney in Chicago, made it clear the government wasn't
about to back off on its efforts. "People who invade our
telecommunications and related computer systems for profit or
personal amusement create immediate and serious consequences
for the public," he said. "Those who choose to use their
intelligence and talent in an attempt to disrupt these vital
networks will find themselves vigorously prosecuted."
   Mr. Rose -- who went by the name "Terminus" when
communicating with other computer users on electronic
networks -- was a "Legion of Doom" member, prosecutors
alleged. But his attorney, Jane Macht, said Mr. Rose didn't
belong to the group. Mr. Rose couldn't be reached for
comment.
   In the government's statement, Mr. Rose is alleged to have
put a hidden "trojan horse" program into a portion of the
Unix software that secretly stored the personal passwords of
people on the system.
