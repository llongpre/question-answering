<LEADPARA>  Four years after the federal government adopted a wide-ranging computer
security law, a group of Dutch teen-agers was able to tap sensitive
information in Defense Department computers using the simplest of hacking
techniques, a congressional committee was told Wednesday.;   Federal auditors
said the interlopers entered some computer systems without even using
passwords. Among the data available at the 34 defense installations they
penetrated were personnel performance reports, weapons development
information, and descriptions of the movements of equipment and personnel.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At least one of the systems cracked by the teen-agers, who operated between
April 1990 and May 1991, directly supported Operation Desert Storm. Jack L.
Brock, director of government information for the General Accounting Office,
declined to give specifics about that system, but said operations against Iraq
were in no way compromised.;   "It is not clear that these hackers had the
level of sophistication needed to use what they obtained," Brock told a
subcommittee of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. Nevertheless, he
said, "this type of information could be very useful to a foreign intelligence
operation.";   Brock and congressional critics sought to use the case of the
Dutch hackers to illustrate their contention that federal agencies have failed
to follow the federal Computer Security Act of 1987.;   A GAO review last year
indicated that only one of 23 federal agencies reviewed had instituted the
security measures and training the act requires.;   A Defense Department
spokeswoman said security procedures are being reviewed, but pointed out that
the hackers only gained access to unclassified information. Law enforcement
officials are seeking to prosecute the teen-agers.;   The 1987 law was drafted
in response to the Reagan administration's tightening control over data in
federal computers and attempts to control access to "sensitive but
unclassified" data in private computers as well. The bill took authority for
non-classified federal systems away from the military and transferred it to
the civilian National Institute of Standards and Technology.;   As part of the
law, various federal agencies were required to submit plans for preventing
unauthorized access to such vital computer systems as the IRS' tax processing
system and the Federal Aviation Administration's air traffic control network.  </TEXT>
