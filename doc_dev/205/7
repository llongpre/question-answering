   The most delightful program on television
Tuesday night is a mystery-comedy-espionage thriller about a
mild-mannered astronomer who tracks down a KGB-financed spy ring.
   It's the true story of Clifford Stoll, a tale of suspense, high
technology, international intrigue, wonderful sight gags - even a
shower scene! - and it's the season premiere of ``Nova,'' PBS' fine
science documentary series.
   ``The KGB, the Computer and Me,'' is Stoll's account, re-enacted
by him and the other people involved, of his two-year hunt for a
computer hacker who had systematically penetrated the U.S. network
of military and academic computers.
   In August 1986, Stoll was a stock comic figure of academe: a
scientist whose grant had expired. With his wiry shock of dark hair
and laid-back wardrobe, he looks more like a Grateful Dead fan
(which he is) than an astronomer.
   Fortunately for him and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the
University of California at Berkeley, the lab needed a manager for
its computer system, and he was hired.
   On his first day in his new job, the boss asks him to track down
a 75-cent discrepancy in the computer billing report.
   ``Thousands of dollars of charges, off by 75 cents, didn't sound
like much,'' Stoll noted, ``but it was an interesting problem. A
big error would mean an obvious bug in the system, easy to find and
fix.
   ``But 75 cents? That was a challenge!''
   And thereby hangs a fascinating story about science, scientists
and the business of doing science.
   The 75-cent error eventually led Stoll to the electronic
fingerprints of a hacker who'd used a personal computer and
telephone connection to break into the Berkeley computer system
from far away.
   ``He was really like a burglar who knows a few ways to
burglarize a house and uses them over and over again,'' Stoll
recounted in a telephone interview. ``He tries the front door, the
back door, and pushes on a couple of windows, and when he can't get
in, he moves on.
   ``He figures, `Sooner or later I'll find one where somebody left
the key in the door.' ''
   Tight computer security - like burglar bars on windows - make
the ``environment'' more difficult for its legitimate occupants as
well as potential invaders. The hacker was exploiting the system's
openness.
   Once inside the computer, the hacker used standard programming
techniques to exploit a ``bug'' in the computer's operating system
and take it over.
   Invisibly, the hacker had made himself a ``super-user'' able to
read, write, erase and remove any file in the program.
   Stoll was angry and appalled. Part of the lab's computer system
is used in high-energy radiation therapy for certain brain tumors.
The hacker was fooling with computer programs that aim heavy
radiation into living people's brains.
   ``When you screw around with systems that you don't know about,
you can't predict what the effects will be,'' Stoll said. ``He
thought he knew and he didn't.''
   It would have been a simple matter to lock out the hacker, fix
the bug in the system and wrap things up, but Stoll wanted to catch
him or her or it.
   And, to his growing concern, the hacker was using the Lawrence
Berkeley computer to move around on the network of university and
non-classified Defense Department computers around the country.
   The hacker was intruding into military databases, defense
contractors, even the Pentagon. True, none of the material was
classified, but it also wasn't the kind of information you read in
the newspapers, either.
   Stoll went to the FBI. A 75-cent error? They weren't interested.
Stoll's quest ultimately led him to ``various three-letter
agencies'' that included the CIA and the ultra-secret NSA.
   ``It was frustrating to find people who really are bureaucrats,
who very much want to help but can't because of the structure of
where they work,'' Stoll said.
   ``The rumors that you hear are true: The government would like
to help you, but it can't. It just doesn't know how,'' he said.
   Stoll persisted, and his efforts eventually led to the arrest,
trial and conviction of a group of West German hackers with links
to the KGB. Stoll even testified at their trial.
   The story he re-enacts, and his equally fascinating book about
the case, ``The Cuckoo's Egg,'' are about science, Stoll insists.
   ``A lot of the time we think the idea of science is to come up
with answers,'' he said. ``That is so bogus!
   ``If you're doing good science, you don't care what the answer
is. You want to find the process, the method. You passionately want
to find the procedure. It seems to me the work I did in catching
this hacker would have been just as satisfying if it had turned out
to be some teen-ager down the block.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE: PBS's excellent documentary series,
``The American Experience,'' starts tonight with ``Lindbergh,'' a
one-hour portrait of the great aviator that tries to look beyond
the legend and find the man.
   Narrated by Stacy Keach, the program features seldom seen
archival footage and photos, and new interviews with his wife, the
often reclusive Anne Morrow Lindbergh, and two of the Lindberghs'
children.
