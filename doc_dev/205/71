   A former U.S. soldier convicted of
spying for the East bloc leaked documents on NATO and American
troops in Europe, the chief federal prosecutor's office said
Thursday.
   Former Army Sgt. 1st Class Clyde Lee Conrad was found guilty of
high treason and sentenced to life in prison in West Germany on
Wednesday after a court in Koblenz found he had passed classified
secrets to Hungary and Czechoslovakia for a decade.
   Late Thursday, the FBI announced that its agents had arrested
another former soldier on spying charges in an outgrowth of the
Conrad case.
   A court in the West German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, in
which the spying occurred, found the 43-year-old Conrad guilty of
providing classified material to the Hungarian and Czechoslovak
secret services from 1975 through 1985.
   It was the first time a foreign resident living in West Germany
had been tried for espionage.
   It estimated he received $1.2 million for his efforts.
   The native of Sebring, Ohio, had been in charge of the classified
document center at the army's 8th Infantry Division in Bad
Krueznach, 50 miles west of Frankfurt, during the majority of his
time with the unit.
   A top official in the chief federal prosecutor's office in
Karlsruhe, Alexander Prechtel, said Thursday that Conrad had turned
over ``defense strategic papers'' to the Hungarian and Czechoslovak
secret services.
   The documents concerned NATO and American troops in Germany and
Europe, Prechtel said, but he would not elaborate.
   Of the classified documents Conrad leaked, Prechtel said:
``Normally everything goes to the Soviet Union, but we can only
prove the way to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and the rest is
speculation.''
   Prechtel said authorities in Czechoslovakia and Hungary had not
cooperated in the investigation.
   ``But that's quite normal. Those countries who are involved in
the case, they are not asked to cooperate,'' he said.
   In Tampa, the FBI arrested another soldier in Conrad's unit,
Roderick James Ramsey, and accused him of violating espionage laws
against gathering or delivering defense information for a foreign
government.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions said the investigation was one
of the most complicated of its kind ever undertaken by the bureau,
and the information passed on was ``extremely sensitive.''
   In reporting Wednesday night that Ramsay had been targeted by the
FBI, ABC News said the espionage ring had smuggled computer parts
from the United States to the East Bloc through Canada.
   Prechtel denied that Conrad was involved in smuggling computer
parts.
   He said West Germans had no other investigation pending in
connection with the Conrad case but pointed out that the United
States had given West Germany the information for Conrad's
prosecution.
   Because Conrad had retired in West Germany with his German wife
and son, he had to be prosecuted by German authorities.
   U.S. authorities in West Germany referred all questions regarding
Conrad and possible other investigations to Washington.
   Conrad's Bonn-based lawyer, Klaus Huemmerich, said he would
appeal the judgment.
   Chief Judge Ferdinand Schuth said Conrad ``endangered the entire
defense capability of the West'' and that the former sergeant was
motivated by ``pure greed.''
   Had war broken out, the judge said, the information passed by
Conrad ``could have led to a breakdown in the defenses of the
Western Alliance,'' and ``to capitulation and the use of nuclear
weapons on German territory.''
   Schuth sentenced Conrad to life imprisonment for spying for the
Hungarians. He said Conrad was also guilty of spying for
Czechoslovakia on a lesser scale, and he sentenced him to four years
in prison on that charge.
   Conrad was arrested Aug. 23, 1988, on suspicion of heading a West
German-based international spy ring with Eastern contacts in Sweden
and Vienna, Austria.
   Conrad, who retired after 20 years in the military, served with
the Army from 1965 to September 1985 and had lived in West Germany
since his discharge.
   According to court records, Conrad was introduced to the
Hungarian secret service in late autumn 1975 by his supervisor in
the 8th Infantry Division, former U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Zoltan
Szabo.
   Szabo, who was convicted of espionage in Austria in 1989,
received a 10-month suspended sentence. He identified for
investigators some of the documents the court said Conrad sold to
the Hungarians.
   Two Hungarians, Sandor Kercsik and his brother, Imre, were
described by the court as Conrad's main contacts.
   The two were arrested in 1988 in Sweden and admitted being agents
of the Hungarian secret police. They were sentenced to 18 months in
prison for possessing NATO defense material.
   The Kercsik brothers also provided statements to the Rhineland
Palatinate state court with evidence implicating Conrad.
