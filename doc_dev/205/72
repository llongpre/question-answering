HOUSE SEARCHED IN HACKER INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The U.S. Secret Service searched a house in Ventura this week to gather 
evidence for Operation Sundevil, a two-year national investigation into 
computer hackers who are suspected of committing credit-card fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Police Department helped execute the search warrant, one of 24 
served in 16 cities nationwide Monday and Tuesday, said Richard Griffin, 
special agent in charge of the Los Angeles field office of the U.S. Secret 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the warrants were executed in the Los Angeles area, Griffin said. The 
U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. attorney's office and the attorney general of 
Arizona were provided with technical assistance for tracking down suspects by 
telecommunications companies, such as Pacific Bell, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
The computer hackers are suspected of gaining access to and using information 
from other computers, long-distance dialing codes and credit-card numbers, 
Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the losses from those activities may run into the millions 
of dollars, said Wendy Harnagel of the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal charges will follow in the next several months, after agents have 
processed information from 23,000 floppy disks and handwritten material seized 
in the nationwide searches, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
The hackers are suspected of belonging to underground groups that were formed 
to exchange information relevant to their criminal activities through their 
computers, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin said the U.S. Secret Service has noticed that an alarming number of 
people adept at computer science are using their skills for crime, mistakenly 
believing that they can avoid detection. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secret Service has jurisdiction over computer fraud and credit-card 
fraud.
