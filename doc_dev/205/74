TWO COMPUTER hackers who broke into systems belonging to companies and
institutions around the world were imprisoned for six months yesterday.
Mr Neil Woods and Mr Karl Strickland had earlier pleaded guilty to offences
under the Computer Misuse Act - legislation introduced in 1990 to outlaw
computer hacking.
For two years the two men hacked into computers belonging to the investment
bank SG Warburg, British Telecommunications, the European Community, and
Nasa, the US space agency. The court heard that the cost of the damage they
caused was conservatively estimated at more than Pounds 123,000.
Passing sentence on the men at Southwark Crown Court in London, Judge
Michael Harris said he fully accepted that their hacking activities were not
designed to damage systems, to misuse the information they contained, or to
make a profit from what they were doing.
He told them, however, custodial sentences were appropriate 'to penalise you
for what you have done and for the losses caused, and to deter others who
might be similarly tempted'.
He said hacking was not harmless and hackers needed to be given a clear
signal that their activities would not be tolerated.
Mr Strickland, a Liverpool University research assistant, and Mr Woods, a
computer salesman from Oldham, both pleaded guilty to conspiring to obtain
telegraphic services dishonestly, and engaging in the unauthorised
publication of computer information.
Mr Woods also admitted causing Pounds 15,000 damage to a computer owned by
Central London Polytechnic.
