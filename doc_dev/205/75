   Two eighth-graders admitted
belonging to a computer hacking network that defrauded more than 20
companies of up to $1.5 million in goods and services, federal
authorities said.
   The computer systems infiltrated include Home Box Office, the
Michigan Treasury Department and RCA Telephone System Sales, the
Secret Service said.
   ``This is the kind of crime we are going to deal with more and
more in the 20th century as we move into a cashless society,''
James Huse, agent in charge of the Secret Service's Detroit office,
said Wednesday.
   In addition to the two 14-year-olds in Sterling Heights, Secret
Service agents questioned five teen-agers in Boston, Atlanta and
Columbus, Ohio, and a woman in Chicago.
   At least 55 other people nationwide used the network's
information, officials said.
   The Michigan teen-agers are too young to face federal charges
but could be charged under state juvenile laws.
   ``They got hooked because of their fascination with the
medium,'' Huse said. ``They gained access to telephone access codes
and financial institutions' access codes which could be used by
them to obtain free phone services and property.''
