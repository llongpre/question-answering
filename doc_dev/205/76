COMPUTER HACKERS broke into an international network belonging to SG
Warburg, the investment bank, Southwark Crown Court was told yesterday.
Mr Neil Woods and Mr Karl Strickland broke into one of the systems operated
by Warburgs and gained full system manager status.
The two had access to the bank's computers around the world, Mr James
Richardson, prosecuting, told the court. Radio pager numbers and home
telephone numbers of Warburg computer staff were found by police at Mr
Woods' home.
The two men had swapped network user identifications and authorisation codes
enabling them to dial into other systems belonging to other companies such
as British Telecom, education establishments and the European Community, Mr
Richardson said.
Mr Woods, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, and Mr Strickland, from Liverpool,
pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to conspiring to obtain telegraphic
services dishonestly. They also admitted engaging in the unauthorised
publication of computer information.
Mr Woods also admitted causing damage to a computer owned by Central London
Polytechnic.
The two men are expected to be sentenced today.
In March this year Mr Paul Bedworth, a student from Ilkley, West Yorkshire
who joined the two men in some of their hacking activities, was acquitted of
offences under the Computer Misuse Act.
His trial was the first test of the legislation since it was passed in 1990.
