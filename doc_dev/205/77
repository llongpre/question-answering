<HEAD>Illegal Intruder Says He Meant to Taunt Experts</HEAD>

   A man identifying himself as the hacker who
illegally penetrated a nationwide computer network said he did so
to taunt computer security specialists, The New York Times reported.
   The man called the Times on Tuesday afternoon, identified
himself only as an Australian named Dave, and said he was callng
from outside the country, the newspaper said in Wednesday editions.
   His account could not be confirmed, the Times said.
   The newspaper said, however, that the man offered many details
about recent electronic break-ins that were corroborated by several
targets of the intruder.
   Federal investigators have said that in recent months the
intruder has illegally entered computers at dozens of institutions
in a nationwide telephone linkup, the Internet.
   Once inside the computers, they said, the intruder stole lists
of the passwords that allow users to enter the system, then erased
files to conceal himself.
   Unidentified investigators said federal authorities in Chicago
were close to finding the intruder and several associates, the
Times said. The U.S. attorney's office in Chicago refused to
confirm that.
   The caller said he had intended to tease computer security
experts but not to damage the systems he entered.
   ``It used to be the security guys chase the hackers,'' he said.
``Now it's the hackers chase the security people.''
   Asked if he would continue his illegal activities, the caller
said he might lay low for awhile.
   ``It's getting a bit hot and we went a bit berserk in the past
week,'' he said.
