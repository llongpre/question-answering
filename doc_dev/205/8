   Investigators have cracked a major spy
ring in which West German ``hackers'' allegedly acquired sensitive
military computer passwords and codes and sold them to the Soviets,
an official said Thursday.
   A West German television network said the passwords and other
information came from key military and research computers in the
United States, Western Europe and Japan.
   Three West Germans have been detained on suspicion of ``obtaining
information about access to databanks, and to have passed that on to
Soviet intelligence agents,'' said Roland Bachmeier, spokesman for
the federal Interior Ministry.
   He refused to confirm other details of a report by the
Norddeutsche Rundfunk broadcasting network.
   The Pentagon issued a one-sentence statement Thursday saying:
``Until possibly affected components of the Department of Defense
have had a chance to analyze the report, we have no reaction.''
   William Caldwell, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department would
have no further comment before Friday at the earliest.
   One security source in West Germany, speaking in an interview
with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said the
``hackers'' tried to break into a large U.S. military computer
network in West Germany but failed to gain access to secret material.
   Police in Hanover arrested two computer hackers on ``suspicion of
espionage activities for an Eastern European intelligence agency,''
said Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's
Office in Karlsruhe. Another suspect was arrested in West Berlin, he
said.
   ``They are suspected of breaking into foreign computer systems''
and selling information to communist agents, Prechtel said.
   He said investigators still are trying to determine how much
damage the suspected espionage had caused to Western security
interests.
   Norddeutsche Rundfunk reported the hackers gained access to a key
U.S. Defense Department computer and to important research computers
elsewhere.
   They obtained sensitive information that would allow the Soviets
to gain access to the computers, the network said.
   Among the computers was the U.S. Defense Department's general
databank known as Optimus, a NASA computer, as well as computers
tied to nuclear weapons and energy research in New Mexico and
Illinois, the network said.
   Those facilities are the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los
Alamos, N.M., and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near
Chicago.
   The information also would give the Kremlin access to U.S.
military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging to
several European institutes that deal with atomic and aerospace
research, the network statement said.
   ``Thousands of computer codes, passwords and programs were
delivered to the Soviets,'' the network said. ``They opened the door
for the KGB to gain access to some of the most important computer
centers of the Western world.''
   Norddeutsche Rundfunk said three suspects had been detained
following searches of at least six apartments in West Berlin and
Hanover. The network also said investigators had seized ``extensive
evidence'' in the searches.
   According to the network, authorities believe three West Germans
were recruited by the Soviet KGB in 1985 and ``were paid with cash
and drugs ... and were later forced to provide the codes and
passwords to the Soviets.''
   The network also said the three handed over ``highly sensitive
information from the United States, Japan, Great Britain, France,
Italy, Switzerland and West Germany'' at a 1985 meeting with two KGB
agents in East Berlin.
   Bachmeier said the arrests followed an investigation by the
federal Constitution Protection Office _ the country's main
counterespionage bureau _ as well as criminal investigators and the
Federal Prosecutor's Office.
