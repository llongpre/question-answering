   A 20-year-old computer hacker was sentenced
Friday to a 21-month prison term on federal charges of breaking
into a nine-state 911 emergency network and passing access codes to
other hackers.
   Robert J. Riggs pleaded guilty with two other computer
enthusiasts. An indictment alleges they belonged to the ``Legion of
Doom,'' a tight-knit group of hackers who used computers to tap
into the 911 system and copy the program.
   Riggs, from Decatur, and Franklin E. Darden Jr., 23, of Norcross
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer and wire fraud,
among other charges.
   Darden and Adam E. Grant, 22, of Atlanta were sentenced to
14-month prison terms, seven of which can be served in a halfway
house.
   Grant pleaded guilty to possession of access codes with intent
to defraud.
   U.S. District Judge Owen Forrester ordered the three to serve
probation and perform community service after they serve their
prison time.
   Riggs was charged with breaking into the Atlanta-based BellSouth
Corp.'s 911 network covering Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and
Florida.
   The hacking between September 1987 and July 1989 did not produce
a service disruption. The computer program was published in an
electronic newsletter.
   ``He was involved in a quest for knowledge,'' said Darden's
lawyer, Michael Hauptman. ``Frank was addicted to this world of
computer doors ... put before him.''
   Riggs was ordered to surrender to begin their sentences no
earlier than Feb. 15. Darden and Grant were told to report Jan. 4,
1991.
