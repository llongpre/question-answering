   Computer hackers have stolen some $12 million in
free telephone service through Johnson Space Center in what at
least one expert said was the biggest such theft in the nation,
according to published a report.
   Hundreds of people have used the system over at least two years,
the Houston Chronicle reported Wednesday.
   ``It's the biggest one I've ever heard of, and certainly the
longest-running one I've ever heard of,'' said Detective Jim Black,
computer crime unit coordinator of the Los Angeles Police
Department and a leading authority on telecommunications theft.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration could not
determine precise figures for the loss, said spokesman Steve
Nesbitt.
   The $12 million figure was calculated from costs of similar
break-ins described by law enforcement agents specializing in
computer crime.
   Nesbitt said the service was stolen in two ways - by using a
long-distance credit card number and by direct use of NASA's phone
lines. The credit card fraud was discovered by AT&amp;T when use of the
number exceeded typical patterns.
   The heavy losses were sustained through four lines in the space
center's regular phone system.
   ``That was shut down. It's been deactivated,'' Nesbitt said.
   The incident at NASA is the second such infiltration of a
government agency to come to light in recent weeks. On Nov. 17, it
was reported that computer hackers and others had stolen phone
service worth millions through the Houston offices of the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   In both instances, intruders gained access to the Federal
Telephone System, a phone service similar to a WATS line. The
Federal Telephone System has no per-call billing, a fact that
allows abuses to go undetected for so long.
