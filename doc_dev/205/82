   A 25-year-old computer hacker once declared
``a very, very great danger to the community'' pleaded guilty to
computer fraud in a plea bargain with federal prosecutors.
   Kevin David Mitnick would be sentenced to 12 months in prison and
three years on supervised release under terms of the agreement.
   The pudgy, youthful looking Mitnick was described by friends as a
computer genius who called himself ``Condor'' and was capable of
infiltrating any computer system.
   Mitnick pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges he infiltrated
Digital Equipment Corp.'s computer system and stole one of its
programs, and admitted stealing 16 MCI telephone codes and using
them to make phone calls. It was not clear whether the long distance
codes were used to access computer systems.
   Prosecutors agreed to dismiss two additional charges, one of
which alleged that Mitnick infiltrated the computer system of Leeds
University in England.
   U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer declined prosecutors'
recommendations until Mitnick is interviewed by probation department
authorities. She noted that he has a prior conviction for similar
activities in Santa Cruz, and set sentencing for April 24.
   At a bail hearing on Jan. 3, Pfaelzer denied bail for the
defendant, saying Mitnick posed ``a very, very great danger to the
community'' _ reflecting public comments made by assistant U.S.
Attorney Leon Weidman.
   Even Mitnick's access to the telephone was restricted. Mitnick's
lawyer, Alan Rubin, has maintained that prosecution comments about
the case were wildly exaggerated.
   On Wednesday, Rubin said outside court that Mitnick had expressed
a desire to undergo psychological counseling, which also was part of
the plea agreement.
   ``He's a very talented man with a lot of ability and for whatever
reason ... there's been a misuse of that ability,'' said Rubin. ``A
computer company that could harness his abilities would really get a
talented employee.''
   Rubin said Mitnick never intended to damage computer systems or
to sell information for profit.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger said the government based
its sentencing recommendation on Digital's estimate that Mitnick's
actions had cost the firm between $100,000 and $200,000 in ``down
time'' on its computer.
   He said the computer system had to be shut down while the firm
looked for damage. The government's initial estimates of damage to
Digital's system were set at $4 million.
   It turned out there was no damage to the overall system, Asperger
said, although Mitnick was able to steal and copy one program.
   Mitnick already has served more than three months in prison, and
Rubin added, ``He'll be out by Christmas.''
