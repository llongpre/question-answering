   Hackers infiltrated the European
Economic Community's computers twice last month, a spokesman said
Friday.
   Claus Ehlermann said the hackers were ``individuals just having
fun'' from Britain, the south of France, Switzerland and South
Africa.
   They obtained no confidential information, he said, because they
quickly were discovered when they penetrated computers of the EEC
commission's external relations, energy, personnel and spokesman's
departments.
   ``Our immediate reaction was to strengthen the defenses of the
system,'' Ehlermann said.
   He denied news reports that hackers also infiltrated the EEC's
computers in Geneva, which recieve sensitive information for
community negotiators at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   In October, a computer hacker revealed how he entered the
Belgian government's computer system and for several months read
the electronic mail of about 10 Cabinet ministers, including Prime
Minister Wilfried Martens.
   The hacker said he even met other ``burglars'' in the system,
which had confidential information such as details on terrorist
killings and the agenda of weekly Cabinet meetings.
   The government ordered an investigation and improved security.
