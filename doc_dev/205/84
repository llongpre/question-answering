   A new Dallas company said it has invented an air-tight
defense against hackers who break into business computers and
phone systems.
   The closely held company, Gatekeeper Telecommunications
Systems Inc. has attracted some of the best-known names in
the computer-security field, including a former American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. security specialist and a prominent
Arizona prosecutor who has spent a decade chasing hackers.

   Gatekeeper said it has developed a device akin to an
electronic key-and-lock that denies hackers access to a
computer carrier tone, making it far more difficult to break
into a system.
   "If this device were in widespread use, it'd take all the
fun out of being a hacker," said Gail Thackeray, a former
Arizona assistant attorney general who will be a vice
president of the company. Law enforcers have been forced to
waste resources on hackers who take unauthorized joy-rides
inside business computers or the public phone system, she
said, when they could be chasing "the real criminals"
committing more serious communications and computer fraud.
   Ms. Thackeray said the Gatekeeper system is
"cost-effective, secure and idiotproof." It won't be
practical for every phone line, she said, and won't solve
serious computer crime such as electronic theft or vandalism
committed by angry employees or other insiders. But it could
slam the door shut on most hackers, she said.
   Under Gatekeeper's system, users would send a unique code
generated by a small keypad over a phone line to get access
to their computer or phone system. The "lock" is installed in
front of a modem, a common computer communications device, so
that hackers don't even get a computer "handshake" telling
them what system is on the other end. And it doesn't
interfere with existing password programs.
   The device also is designed to protect corporate phone
systems, which are increasingly targeted by hackers who run
up huge charges. Last week, Mitsubishi International Corp.
sued AT&amp;T, the maker of its phone system, seeking $10 million
in damages and recovery of $430,000 for more than 30,000
unauthorized calls placed to numbers around the world.
   Neal Norman, one of AT&amp;T's top network security executives
until his retirement two years ago, is Gatekeeper's
president. He said the system could prevent much of the
access fraud being committed by hackers targeting AT&amp;T and
local telephone networks. "I've spent years working to
protect the telephone network, and no one else has come up
with anything that does what this system can do," he said.
   At least one of the regional Bell phone companies has
expressed interest in the system, as have law enforcement
agencies and a top accounting firm, Mr. Norman said. He
wouldn't detail the contacts.
   The systems -- starting at less than $10,000, depending on
their configuration -- will be available this fall, said Mr.
Norman.
