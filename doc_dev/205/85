<HEAD>British High Court Clears Computer Hackers</HEAD>

   A computer hacker who sent messages to Prince
Philip's computer cannot be prosecuted under the country's
counterfeiting and forgery laws, Britain's highest court ruled
Thursday.
   Stephen Gold and Robert Schifreen were arrested separately in
1985 for breaking into the Prestel system, the information service
of British Telecom, the nation's telephone company.
   Gold, of Sheffield, and Schifreen, of London, were convicted in
1986 of nine offenses and fined $1,140 and $1,425, respectively.
   Five Law Lords of the House of Lords, members of an unelected
upper legislative chamber who have expertise as judges, unanimously
upheld a Court of Appeals ruling last year that said the two men
could not be prosecuted as charged under the Forgery and
Counterfeiting Act.
   ``Their conduct amounted in essence to dishonestly gaining
access to the relevant Prestel data bank by a trick,'' said Lord
Geoffrey Lane. ``That is not a criminal offense. If it is thought
desirable to make it so, that is a matter for the legislature
rather than the courts.''
   ``I knew from the start that the Forgery Act is not designed to
apply to unauthorized access to computers and that has now been
proved,'' said Schifreen. ``I am not saying computer hacking should
be legal, but there should be a specific law to cover it.''
   He said the messages left on Prince Philip's computer were not
``terribly interesting,'' mostly congratulations on the birth of
his grandson Prince William, the elder son of Prince Charles and
Princess Diana.
