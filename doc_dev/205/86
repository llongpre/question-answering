   Prosecutors said the light sentence given
a computer hacker whose ``worm'' shut down a nationwide network
would not deter them from cracking down on computer abuse.
   Robert T. Morris Jr., 25, was sentenced Friday to three years
probation, fined $10,000 and ordered to perform 400 hours community
service.
   Although the Justice Department had asked that Morris be given
jail time, U.S. Attorney Frederick Scullin Jr. said he believed the
sentence was fair.
   ``This is sort of a unique circumstance,'' he said. ``I don't
feel it's going to be any sort of a precedent.''
   Scullin said future computer hackers may face stricter sentences.
   ``Would-be hackers are now on notice that the Department of
Justice will vigorously prosecute future computer criminals and
seek severe penalties, regardless of what their motives are,'' he
said.
   U.S. District Judge Howard Munson said there were no previous
cases that could be used as a model for sentencing.
   In January, Morris became the first person to be convicted under
the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for breaking into a federal
computer network and preventing authorized use of the system.
   The former Cornell University graduate student was found guilty
of creating a ``worm'' program on Nov. 2, 1988 that invaded an
estimated 6,000 computers linked to the Internet research system
used at NASA, military facilities and major universities.
   Once in the system, the program replicated itself wildly,
paralyzing the network.
   Under federal sentencing guidelines, Morris faced up to five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine. But his attorneys argued that
the case did not fit the guidelines.
   ``This is not your garden-variety fraud crime,'' attorney David
O'Brien said. ``This crime was not motivated by malice. It was not
motivated by an intention to do harm. It was an experiment _ albeit
a reckless, irresponsible, stupid one.''
   Defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni said the sentence was
reasonable, but he will file an appeal to challenge the law under
which Morris was convicted.
   ``I don't believe Mr. Morris deserves to be a felon for what he
did,'' Guidoboni said.
   Morris did not speak at the sentencing and did not talk to
reporters afterward. When the sentence was announced, he smiled and
hugged his mother.
   Robert Morris Sr., a scientist at the National Computer Security
Center in Bethesda, Md., said he does not consider his son a
criminal.
   ``There is real computer crime in this country,'' he said. ``It
is rampant and extremely expensive, and this case did not begin to
touch on that.''
   Morris, who was suspended from Cornell after the worm incident,
works at a computer-related job in Cambridge, Mass.
   He testified at his trial that the worm was an experiment that
went out of control because of a programming error he made. He
admitted he designed the worm to attack the Internet system but
said it wasn't supposed to replicate as it did.
   Prosecutors described his program as a ``full-scale assault''
and said Morris took deliberate steps to make the worm difficult to
trace and eradicate.
