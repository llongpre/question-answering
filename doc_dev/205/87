   A former U.S. Army sergeant who
allegedly led an international spy ring sold the Soviets secret
documents on nuclear missile bases, military pipelines and NATO
troop strength, news reports said today.
   The Bild newspaper of Hamburg, which is known to have close
contacts to intelligence sources, quoted an unidentified West
German security official as saying Clyde Lee Conrad had sold
``extraordinarily important information.''
   A special Supreme Court panel ordered Conrad held in prison
pending further investigation following his arrest Tuesday. He was
charged with ``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an
especially grave case,'' according to the prosecutor's office.
   Two men who officials said were part of the ring were arraigned
today in Sweden.
   Kurt Rebmann, the chief federal prosecutor, said Conrad also
recruited a second American soldier who received a ``five-figure
sum'' of money for supplying the ring with military secrets.
Rebmann refused to elaborate.
   Bild said information contained in documents that Conrad
allegedly sold included ``secret locations of nuclear missiles,
classified documents about pipeline systems, defense plans of NATO
and of U.S. divisions, and top-secret troop mobilization plans.''
   West Germany's ARD television network and The New York Times
also reported that such information was sold by the ring, which
allegedly had been operating since the late 1970s.
   The Times quoted U.S. and German officials as saying Conrad
guarded a safe that stored documents at the U.S. Army base in Bad
Kreuznach in central West Germany.
   Bild said Conrad lived in an elegantly furnished apartment near
the base.
   Officials have said the ring was believed to have stolen
documents concerning NATO defense plans for Europe and U.S. Army
contingency plans for a ground war with the Soviet Union in Europe.
   Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office, said Thursday that it's too early to determine what damage
the spying caused the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``We can't exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are
involved,'' he said.
   ``It could take months before we know the full extent of the
damage to NATO defenses,'' he added. He refused to release any
further details about the probe.
   In Goteborg, Sweden, a district court today arraigned two
Hungarian-born brothers, who Prechtel said were part of the ring.
Chief Prosecutor Sven-Olof Hakansson said the men, arrested
Tuesday, acknowledged working for the Hungarian intelligence
service.
   Security officials said Sandor Kercsik, 48, and Imre Kercsik,
34, were suspected of ``preparing unlawful intellegence activity
and supporting preparations of criminal acts.''
   A third suspect, the wife of one of the brothers, was detained
for questioning and released. Her arraignment was not immediately
sought.
   A U.S. Justice Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, called the spy case ``a serious encroachment on our
national security.''
   Army records released in Washington said Conrad, of Sebring,
Ohio, was born in 1947 and worked for the U.S. military for 20
years, first as an infantryman and then as an ``administration
specialist.''
   According to his service records, Conrad received the National
Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, five Army
Commendation medals, the Army Achievement Medal, three Meritorious
Service medals and seven Good Conduct medals.
   Prechtel said Conrad worked with classified military defense
plans for seven years at the U.S. Army base in Bad Kreuznach with
access to a wide array of secret documents.
   Conrad allegedly engaged in espionage work after he left the
service in 1985, Prechtel said.
   In a statement, Rebmann alleged that Conrad had turned over the
most recent batch of information to his Soviet bloc contact in
Vienna last month.
   Rebmann said officials still were investigating to determine
exactly what was missing.
   Cable News Network on Thursday quoted unidentified West German
sources as saying Conrad systematically photographed files from
1980 to 1985. The CNN report said investigators believe he may have
transferred material onto a personal computer, which was seized at
his home.
   Prechtel said that while ``several'' people had been taken into
custody or arrested, he could not confirm a New York Times report
Thursday that eight people were rounded up.
   The Times said the network was uncovered by West German and U.S.
officials, including agents from the FBI and the Army. The Army has
about 250,000 military personnel in West Germany at more than 200
installations and frequently warns its personnel to beware of
Soviet bloc spies.
