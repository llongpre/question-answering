CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S. J. DIAMOND: NEGOTIATING THE MAZE OF COMPUTER GAMES

Many parents bought computer games this Christmas, some just because they have 
a home computer and want their child to learn something while fooling around. 
</P>
<P>
It would certainly get the kids away from the TV or the Nintendo. It involves 
some reading, if only of the manual. And there are great-looking games now, 
with dungeons, warlords, space travel, mazes and mysteries -- obviously pure 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
But these aren't video games, and computers aren't television sets. New buyers 
often find themselves up to their keyboards in problems. They can't "load" the 
game onto the computer. Or they can't figure out how to play it. 
</P>
<P>
Or they can't get beyond a certain point in the game. With Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit, they never manage to navigate the highway to the nightclub, where the 
real action begins. With King's Quest, they never get the little hero much past 
the goat pen near the start of his journey. With Flight Simulator, they never 
land a plane without crashing. 
</P>
<P>
Devised by computer hackers in the days before personal computers, computer 
games now have sales of $262.6 million a year, having risen 30% between 1987 
and 1988. But they're still a hacker's hobby and only 10% of the $2-billion 
software market. 
</P>
<P>
Computers themselves aren't mass market yet. They're present in only 20% of 
American homes, according to the Software Publishers Assn. in Washington. 
Keyboard-driven, coded with "commands," they're not easy to operate, unlike 
arcade and video games. They're not even standardized: Each computer needs its 
"compatible" game version and a proper-sized disk. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are ever more computers out there, and their owners are changing 
the profile of the computer game player. "Not hackers or hobbyists, these are 
people who got their computer for Christmas," says Peter Spear, a computer game 
expert and author of the book "King's Quest Companion." 
</P>
<P>
"They think they bought a toaster, and they want to plug it in and have it 
work," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Too commonly, such people "have 128K computers and they're buying 640K games," 
says Mason Rutledge, spokesman for Egghead Discount Software in Issaquah, Wash. 
More commonly, there's an incompatibility between the game's capacity and the 
player's. 
</P>
<P>
These aren't board games, all laid out, with moves and rules detailed inside 
the cover. Some require mostly speed and dexterity -- dodge-'em, shoot-'em 
arcade games or abstract puzzles such as Tetris and Revenge of Doh. Others 
involve strategy or guesswork -- simulations of flights and battles -- or 
"animated adventures" featuring journeys and mazes. 
</P>
<P>
For the computer "techie," the challenge is the game. "The hard-core veteran 
gamer will slog through 50 pages of rules and grumble," says Russell Sipe, 
editor of Anaheim-based Computer Gaming World (circulation 30,000), "but then 
play for 40 hours." Or they'll gladly start with nothing, Spear says, "part of 
the point being to discover the game as you go." 
</P>
<P>
Given the ethos, software publishers "didn't always make sure the documentation 
was easy to read," says Phillip Adam, president of Spectrum Holobyte (Tetris) 
in Alameda, "or that the game had documentation." 
</P>
<P>
Where manuals exist, they're often elliptical, for readers who say, "Don't ever 
give me an answer, give me a clue," Spear says. A King's Quest game, for 
example, comes with a fairy tale introducing the kingdom featured and a 
"reference card" outlining the key commands, but it leaves players to guess 
that when a condor flies overhead, one should type "jump," projecting the 
little hero onto its back to fly to the next scene. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, these games began as group entertainment: Players shared the 
experience, comparing notes, admiring graphics. Computer Gaming World's roster 
of 10 top games is not a list of best-sellers but of readers' own ratings. Even 
kids work together, particularly the adolescent boys who form an obsessive 
subgroup of the market, "playing in groups of two, three or four," says one 
mother, "talking on the telephone, passing around lore. If they all get stuck, 
whoever has a hint book brings it out." 
</P>
<P>
There's some help available from vendors, but it indicates their ambivalence 
about serving a mass market. "The core market is always going to be there, and 
companies want that market badly," Sipe says. "The number of users is smaller, 
but the amount of money spent is so much larger -- $50 a month on computer 
games, compared to four games a year for the mass market buyer." 
</P>
<P>
There may be hint booklets, as with King's Quest, but some consumers are 
offended when asked to pay $6 for guidance on playing a $40 game. Worse, they 
move by hints, coyly printed in ink revealed by a special pen: "How do I figure 
out the gnome's name?" "Read the note you found on the witch's bed stand for a 
hint." 
</P>
<P>
Publishers do offer "technical support" by phone but apparently find no message 
in the fact that people have so many questions. Few provide 800 numbers (except 
for orders): They can't afford it, they say, given their limited sales volume, 
and they have some disdain for the questions. Kids pester them, people want 
help using their computers, callers waste calls on what one vendor calls 
"solvable problems" -- things they should have figured out themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Some retailers help, although as interest grows and popular games sell 
themselves, retailers do less work. Some let customers open and try games in 
the store, or return the goods after purchase -- most famously, the 205-store 
Egghead chain. "You may buy a product far beyond your capabilities," Mason 
Rutledge says, "and you won't know till you try it." (One consequence: 
Consumers may find that Egghead games, rewrapped and resold, have strangers 
already signed on as players.) 
</P>
<P>
Because the new buyer of computer games is truly up against something new, "my 
personal advice," says computer analyst Lawrence Magid, "is if your kid says he 
played something at Johnny's and liked it, then you buy it." It's still a 
word-of-mouth industry.
