TWO COMPUTER hackers who broke into systems belonging to companies and
institutions around the world were imprisoned for six months yesterday, John
Mason writes.
Mr Neil Woods and Mr Karl Strickland had earlier pleaded guilty to offences
under the Computer Misuse Act - legislation introduced in 1990 to outlaw
computer hacking.
For two years the two men hacked into computers belonging to the investment
bank SG Warburg, British Telecommunications, the European Community and
Nasa, the US space agency.
The court heard that the cost of the damage they caused was conservatively
estimated at more than Pounds 123,000.
Passing sentence on the men at Southwark Crown Court in London Judge Michael
Harris said he fully accepted that their hacking activities were not
designed to damage systems, to misuse the information they contained or to
make a profit from what they were doing.
He told them custodial sentences were appropriate, however, 'to penalise you
for what you have done and for the losses caused and to deter others who
might be similarly tempted'.
Mr Strickland, a Liverpool University research assistant, and Mr Woods, a
computer salesman from Oldham, Greater Manchester, both pleaded guilty to
conspiring to obtain telegraphic services dishonestly and to engaging in the
unauthorised publication of computer information.
