<LEADPARA>  It was on the way to the canned vegetables that Kevin Lee Poulsen's 17-month
flight from the law ended -- and with it perhaps the decade-long career of a
man authorities believe to be one of the most sophisticated, successful
telephone and computer hackers in the history of high-tech crime.;    At 10
minutes to midnight on Wednesday, April 11, Poulsen pulled his black Pontiac
Fiero into the parking lot of an all-night Hughes supermarket in suburban Los
Angeles.  </LEADPARA>

HACKER'S OBSESSION LED HIM TO JAIL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Acting on a tip from an "associate" of the 25-year-old computer hacker,
Pacific Bell investigator Terry Atchley was staking out the market. He'd
warned employees on the night shift that Poulsen, wanted by the FBI, might
show up. When Poulsen, with bleached hair and dressed in black jeans, T-shirt
and leather jacket, walked in, packing clerk Dave Hernandez seized the
slender, 5-foot-8 suspect and bear-hugged him until Atchley had handcuffed
him.;    "He was on his way to the canned vegetable aisle and just didn't make
it," clerk Jon Lacson told a reporter. "He was jumped from behind and just
kept asking, 'What did I do?' ";    Faces up to 37 years in prison;  Today,
Poulsen is in the Santa Clara County Jail awaiting trial this fall on federal
charges ranging from electronic joyriding through phone company computers to
eavesdropping on an FBI investigation to hacking his way into military
computer networks. If convicted on all 16 counts, Poulsen faces up to 37 years
in prison under a relatively untested 1986 computer crime law.;    Based on a
review of the indictment, court documents and more than 20 interviews, a
picture emerges of Kevin Poulsen as a brilliant but troubled computer prodigy
who was motivated by the need for attention and by an obsession for secret
information.;    "He was a nice kid," said Annette Randol, the mother of Sean
Randol, a former friend. "He was a little strange. He was a lot strange! But
he wasn't a bad person. He felt powerless. Computer hackers are people who
feel powerless, and computer hacking is a way of feeling powerful.";    At key
moments in Poulsen's career, luck and a seemingly minor event played important
roles. While on the run from the FBI, he was arrested by Los Angeles police,
but released by authorities who didn't know whom they'd arrested. And the
break that led police to Poulsen was one that in most cases would be
considered inconsequential: an unpaid storage bill.;    He lived two lives; 
By most accounts, Poulsen lived two lives during the period covered by the
indictment: 1986 to 1988. By day, he held a coveted job at Menlo Park's SRI
International, the prestigious think tank and consultant. By night, he stalked
an electronic netherworld, assuming identities drawn from a dark and
disturbing science fiction fantasy called the "Watchmen.";    Telephone
hacking, or "phone phreaking," is something of a Silicon Valley tradition.
Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs raised money for the Apple computer prototype by
selling "blue boxes," devices that produce the necessary high-pitched tone
that allowed users free long-distance calling. Today, that would be a federal
offense.;    Few believe Poulsen hacked for financial gain, for espionage or
even for malice. Even so, respected computer industry officials who recently
have come to the aid of young hackers said that if Poulsen burglarized offices
and eavesdropped on conversations, he exceeded what they view as ethical
hacking.;    And prosecutors say that what distinguishes Poulsen is an
astonishing knowledge of what is the most ubiquitous computer system of all:
the telephone network. That understanding, they say, gave him the power to
sabotage phone service, change subscribers' bills and invade their privacy.;  
 "Some of these crimes have tremendous potential for damage," said John von
Brauch, a Pac Bell security official who has pursued Poulsen since 1988.;   
Poulsen declined to be interviewed. And his attorney, Paul Meltzer of Santa
Cruz, also declined comment, saying he'd only recently taken the case.;   
Called indictment 'ludicrous';  Poulsen's only known defense is a two-page
letter he sent while still a fugitive to NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries," which
broadcast a segment on his alleged crimes. According to the segment's
producer, the letter called the indictment "ludicrous" and cited numerous
cases in which the government has come down hard on hackers who turned out to
be harmless.;    Perhaps the most stunning aspect of the case is that Poulsen,
already known for his involvement in a notorious criminal hacking case, was
hired for a job at SRI that included work testing computer security for the
Defense Department.;    In a celebrated case in the early 1980s, Poulsen was
caught by the FBI masquerading as "Dark Dante" and hacking into Arpanet, a
Pentagon computer network that links universities, think tanks and defense
contractors across the country. Hacking rival Ron Austin, who was 19 at the
time, received three years' probation. Poulsen, who was 17 and never charged,
was rewarded for his exploits.;    After hearing of the case, SRI hired the
computer whiz in 1985 to work on military projects, including a sensitive
experiment to test the vulnerability of Pentagon computer security, according
to a source familiar with the program. SRI officials declined to discuss
Poulsen or the case.;    Poulsen, a high-school dropout, was delighted by the
SRI job. During visits home to North Hollywood, he boasted about it to Randol,
his friend. "He was proud," said his father, Lee Poulsen, a retired mechanic
with the Los Angeles Police Department.;    At the same time, Poulsen was
aiming at a new target for his hacking: the phone system.;    Charged with Pac
Bell break-ins;  The Justice Department has charged Poulsen with masterminding
a series of break-ins into Pacific Bell offices in San Ramon, San Francisco
and Palo Alto. In most of those cases, Poulsen dressed as a workman and used
stolen or manufactured identification, the government alleges.;    In
Poulsen's apartment, investigators found blank ID cards, a laminating machine,
a stack of mug shots of Poulsen and blank birth certificates. They also found
business cards indicating Poulsen had passed himself off as Kevin A. Locke of
Al's Lock 'N' Key and Kevin A. Locke, a staff writer and photographer for
Health and Fitness magazine.;    As a teen-ager, Poulsen was a devotee of
"Dungeons &amp; Dragons," a fantasy role-playing adventure game. And that
obsession with alternate identities seemed to grow more sophisticated as
Poulsen got older.;    In early 1987, Poulsen established Pacific Bell phone
lines and accounts in the names of Jon Osterman and Walter Kovacs. Kovacs is a
multifaceted character in a comic book called the "Watchmen," a series of
violent and bizarre science fiction tales that apparently fascinated Poulsen.;
   Like Poulsen, the fictional Kovacs maintains a dual life, working in the
garment industry of a decaying city by day and assuming the identity of
"Rorschach" by night, a disturbed vigilante who wears a mask resembling a
Rorschach test.;    Another insight into Poulsen's mind, authorities say,
comes from the photographs he took of his alleged crimes. They suggest that he
was motivated more by thrills and bragging rights than by financial gain.;   
When investigators searched Poulsen's possessions, they found photographs of
him picking the lock of a GTE telecommunications trailer in the Santa Cruz
Mountains and sitting down at telephone terminals inside. They also found
newspaper clippings of his exploits as a teen-ager and computer tapes of
incriminating electronic mail messages.;    'Arrogant little guy';  "Kevin is
kind of an arrogant little guy," said von Brauch, the Pac Bell security
officer and a former Oakland cop. "There are several things a self-respecting
burglar wouldn't be caught dead doing.";    After several break-ins,
investigators say Poulsen had accumulated an astonishing collection of phone
company equipment, including circuit test packs, telephone lineman hand sets
and consoles. They filled a room of the Pine Street apartment he shared with
Mark K. Lottor half a block from SRI. Poulsen and Lottor hung a sign on the
door, calling it "The Switchroom.";    Lottor, 26, who works at SRI, faces
five counts of computer and telephone fraud, although he has been offered a
deal that would involve telling authorities about Poulsen, according to
Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert K. Crowe, chief prosecutor on the case.;   
Together with the stolen access code books and software manuals he had, the
equipment gave Poulsen the run of the phone system. It was that knowledge that
allowed him to commit a variety of intrusions, the indictment alleges:;   
(check) In September 1987, Poulsen entered Pac Bell computers and retrieved
unpublished phone numbers and employee lists for the Soviet Consulate in San
Francisco.;    (check) In one of his more brazen moves, Poulsen rounded up the
names of Pac Bell security personnel and checked records of their calls to see
if they were following him. He even used as an alias the name of a former Pac
Bell security supervisor.;    (check) From September 1987 to January 1988,
Poulsen eavesdropped on phone conversations and electronic mail between two of
the investigators and taped conversations of Annette Randol and her daughter,
Sean, with whom he'd had a falling out.;    In October 1987, according to the
indictment, Poulsen and Robert E. Gilligan, a computer networking programmer
at Sun Microsystems Inc., tapped into Masnet, an unclassified Army computer
network.;    Gilligan got as far as Masnet's electronic "No Trespassing" sign
at the gates of the network, according to his attorney, Charles Gretsch. He
printed out the sign before logging off and gave it to Poulsen, who allegedly
later logged onto Masnet himself.;    Poulsen also is charged with obtaining a
classified document -- flight orders for thousands of Army paratroopers who
were on a military exercise at Fort Bragg, N.C. It is unclear whether either
of these incidents were related to Poulsen's work at SRI.;    As part of a
bargain with the prosecution, Gilligan, 32, pleaded guilty to possessing a
telephone access code directory and received three years' probation. He also
must pay $25,000 in restitution to Pacific Bell and tell authorities what he
knows about the case.;    Locker held a treasure trove;  In the end, Poulsen
was caught by a $34 unpaid storage-locker fee. Using the name John Anderson,
Poulsen had rented a locker at the Menlo-Atherton Storage facility. When he
failed to pay the fee for more than two months, Larry Tyson, the facility's
owner, opened it to find a treasure trove of stolen phone equipment. Even the
lock itself was from Pacific Bell.;    Tyson, himself something of a computer
buff and a former Redwood City cop, called in the Menlo Park police and von
Brauch of Pacific Bell. When Poulsen came in to pay his bill, the police
picked him up and questioned him. Poulsen agreed to show them his room in the
apartment he shared with Lottor.;    But even with the evidence that Poulsen
had hacked into Masnet and monitored the Soviets, the FBI was reluctant to get
involved. It wasn't until local police presented the agency with evidence that
Poulsen had eavesdropped on their surveillance of Imelda Marcos' daughter,
Irene Araneta, in Woodside that the FBI got involved.;    "That's when they
got real mad, when they realized he was screwing up one of their
investigations," Tyson said.;    For a variety of reasons, including the
reassignment of the assistant U.S. attorney working on the case and the
complexity of the evidence against Poulsen, an indictment wasn't filed until
November 1989, more than 20 months after Poulsen was arrested. By that time,
Poulsen had fled.;    Pac Bell and the FBI pursued Poulsen over the next 17
months, suspecting from the start that he was in the Los Angeles area. FBI
headquarters in Washington deemed the case important enough to suggest that
"Unsolved Mysteries" do a segment on it, although the show failed to produce
the tip that led to his capture.;    In September, Los Angeles police picked
up Poulsen, allegedly in connection with a separate telephone fraud
investigation. Not realizing who they had, the police took a picture of
Poulsen and released him. Authorities declined to discuss what Poulsen was
doing during that period, but say they expect to file additional charges
against him within a month.  </TEXT>
