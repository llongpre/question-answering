   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Guardians of the nation's linked computer
networks were shaken up last year by a now-famous ``virus.'' It was
spawned within the narrow, and to outsiders mysterious, world of
hackers. What's it like, this esoteric subculture? Occasional
mischief notwithstanding, could it be a national treasure? A
reporter opens the computer file on the prodigies of the terminal.
First of three articles.

   SUBJECT FILE: Hackers. Computer hackers.
   DEFINE: Misperceived as an electronic subculture of humans who
noodle at computers 40 hours a day _ subsist on Cokes and takeout
Chinese food _ typically young, smart males who rarely become nose
guards _ often found at schools whose initials end in `T' for Tech _
nerds with acne who devise fiendish booby traps to blow the fuses of
the republic's vital computer systems.
   ENTER: Caution. Don't believe everything you read. Hackers are
more likely a national treasure.

   Seated at a terminal in the computer lab at the University of
California-Berkeley, Jef (one `f' has been sacrificed for aesthetic
purity) Poskanzer, a longhair of 30 years, is poised like Vladimir
Horowitz about to bring magic from a keyboard.
   Plockety-plock-plock. Suddenly on the screen appears a detailed
portrait of the Earth's moon. Every 20 minutes throughout the 28-day
lunar cycle the portrait changes to update the sunlight's
progression from fingernail sliver to complete illumination at full
moon. Jef programmed the computer to do this during several nights
when the machines usually doze.
   Neat.
   But why did Jef do this? For about the same reasons that
Michelangelo painted ceiling, Columbus went sailing or
Hillary-Tenzing worried up the ice of Mount Everest.
   ``What use is a newborn baby?'' replied Ben Franklin when a
rain-soaked fellow onlooker asked him in Paris in 1783 what possible
purpose Jacques-Alexandre-Cesar Charles could have had in mind in
launching a huge balloon up into the clouds.
   Poskanzer's moon is an intellectual descendant of that balloon
and is, in the purest sense of the term, a hack.

   Hacking can be called an attitude toward problem solving, a human
urge to outwit conventional wisdom, an exploration of limits, not
always absent _ whimsy.
   When Caltech students at the 1961 Rose Bowl rearranged the code
of the cheering section's half-time show so their synchronized cards
spelled ``CALTECH'' instead of ``HUSKIES'' for the University of
Washington, then spelled Huskies backward, this was a hack.
   Since Robert Morris, a 23-year-old Cornell grad student, was
strongly suspected of planting a ``virus'' last fall _ actually a
``worm'' but don't bother your head about the distinction _ that
gave 6,000 interconnected computers electronic hits, hacking has
become a nasty word. Should it be?
   According to Steven Levy, the Herodotus of hacking in his
estimable history, ``Hackers,'' the word stems from MIT at the dawn
of the computer age in the late '50s. The incubator was the Tech
Model Railroad Club.
   In The Real World, defined by ``The Hacker's Dictionary'' as a
place whose inhabitants wear ties and are thought of as ``not unlike
deceased persons,'' hacking was how Henry VIII solved his marital
dissonances or what inept golfers or unfelicitous writers do.
   At MIT, where ingenious students had long since advanced from
reassembling Model A Fords in a professor's room, hacking at the
Railroad Club meant creating something of great panache and
ingenuity without necessarily an ultimate utility. Circuits could be
rewired not to make the tiny trains run on time, but to make them do
it more elegantly.
   When computers began showing up on campus, some railroaders were
immediately drawn to them like moths to a diode. They set behavior
patterns which abide. They lived by night when computers were idle,
neglected families, food, studies, sunlight, soap. The last may
account for the scarcity of female hackers.
   Early on, hackers, marked more by preoccupation than misogyny,
ignored girls because they considered them unprogrammable.
Poskanzer, however, backpacks, plays soccer and admits he has a girl.

   Gifted children have long been prodigies in music and math. Add,
now, computers.
   ``The young don't know there are walls,'' says Glenn Tenney who
is 39, still hacks but knows he must buy foodstuffs in The Real
World. ``It's easier to spend 40 hours a day hacking when you're a
kid than when you're middle-aged.''
   A hacking prodigy can be called, often unjustly, a nerd.
   The source of the term nerd is obscure. In a very informal poll,
the only characteristic a majority agreed on was that nerds usually
wear plastic pencil holders in their shirt pockets.
   In a lacrosse game, this writer once faced off against an MIT
defenseman whose stick was twice the length of mine. Rather than
snarl that he'd split my skull the next time the ref wasn't looking,
this student engineer observed:
   ``Quite a disparity in leverage, isn't it?''
   The remark was probably nerdistic.

   The hacking instinct in the years B.C. _ before computers _ might
have expressed itself in the souping of hot rods. But this is dirty
work. Computing is clean. There's a whole world at your fingertips.
You don't have to risk rejection when the neighborhood gang chooses
up sides for one o' cat.
   ``Years ago these kids would have been tipping over decrepit
barns or the like,'' says Don Parker, an authority on computer crime
at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif., and once an expert in
barn demolition. His childhood mates would almost saw through the
supports of an abandoned barn, tie on ropes, then collapse the
structure before the startled eyes of the owner roused from his bed
by the adolescent clamor. Delinquency, perhaps, but with a flair
toward a hack.
   ``Most kid hackers are not socially skilled,'' says Dave Flory.
``They socialize through the computer.''
   ``It's a way to nudge the system, impress your friends, say,
`Here I am,''' says Tom Mandel, a hacker who also wears a tie in The
Real World as a futurist at a Silicon Valley think tank.
