   East bloc officials secretly working for the Central Intelligence Agency several years ago provided the U.S. with the first evidence that a major Warsaw Pact spy ring had gained access to military secrets, but the officials were arrested and executed, intelligence sources said. 

   The exposure this week of the Hungarian-run spy ring also may revive the controversy about whether the KGB, the Soviet intelligence service, gained access to the American Embassy in Moscow in 1986. 
U.S. officials said the ring operated for more than a decade and provided the Soviets and their allies with "box loads" of secrets about North Atlantic Treaty Organization communications and plans for defending Western Europe. 

   U.S. intelligence officials compared the latest spy scandal, first reported in detail in the New York Times, to the Walker family spy ring, which sold U.S. Navy communications secrets to the Soviets for years and seriously compromised Navy operations. 

   A former U.S. Army sergeant, Clyde Lee Conrad, and two Hungarian-born brothers were arrested Tuesday in West Germany and Sweden and charged with suspicion of espionage. 
A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Milt Ahlerich, said yesterday, "This is a very significant matter. 
The interest to this country is acute." 

   While officials try to assess exactly how much damage the spy ring did to the U.S. and its European allies, officials in the CIA's Counterintelligence Center are trying to figure out how the Soviets hunted down and liquidated the sources who first had alerted them to the spy ring, intelligence officials said. 

   Some of the CIA's sources were arrested at the same time U.S. counterintelligence officials suspected Marine guards or others might have allowed KGB officers into the Moscow embassy. 
"A couple of people who were executed were original sources of information on this (spy ring) case," said one U.S. official, who asked not to be identified. 
"They had told us the kind of information they were getting, but not the names of the people they were getting it from." 

   A Marine guard at the embassy, Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, was convicted last year of providing information about embassy operations to the Soviets. 
But a $30 million probe by the Naval Investigative Service failed to produce any evidence to support charges that Sgt. Lonetree, or anyone else, had allowed KGB agents into the embassy. 

   Now, however, some intelligence officials believe the KGB must have discovered the first leaks about the Hungarian spy ring either by entering the CIA station in Moscow, or by obtaining highly classified secrets from the CIA or the embassy. 

   Edward Lee Howard, a low-level CIA officer who was fired from the agency in 1983 and defected to the Soviet Union two years later, exposed other Soviet officials who were providing information to the West about East Bloc espionage operations. 
But one official said Mr. Howard was fired before the CIA began looking for the Hungarian spy ring. 

   In one important respect, intelligence sources said, the latest espionage case appears to resemble the litany of other counterintelligence disasters -- including the Walker case -- suffered by the U.S. during the last decade. 
Officials said Mr. Conrad is suspected of having sold secrets for money, not for ideological reasons. 
West German Chief Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said a second American soldier, who wasn't named, received a "five-figure sum" for supplying military secrets.
