<HEAD>Report: West German Tapped Into U.S. Military Computers</HEAD>

   For nearly two years, a West German citizen
gained access to more than 30 computers belonging to the U.S.
military and military contractors, according to a published report.
   The New York Times reported in Monday's editions that the West
German searched for data related to nuclear weapons, intelligence
satellites, the Strat=e Initiative, the space shuttle and
the North American Air Defense Command.
   The Times, quoting computer security experts, said he did not
gain access to any classified information or break into a
``secure'' government computer where classified information is
stored.
   An FBI spokesman confirmed Sunday that the matter was under
investigation.
   A West German magazine, Quick, detailed the case last week and
identified the intruder as Mathias Speer, 24, a computer science
student in Hanover. The FBI would not confirm his identity, the
Times said.
   The electronic break-ins may have gone on for a year before
being discovered in August 1986, the newspaper said.
   They were monitored for a year and traced, the Times said, and
in June 1987, the West German and an American who may have been an
accomplice apparently were questioned by authorities. The break-ins
stopped about the same time.
   ``This kind of penetration could clearly have been used for
espionage,'' Peter G. Neumann, a computer security expert familiar
with the case, told the Times. ``I think most of the attacks before
this have been relatively benign on a global scale. This one is
much more insidious.''
   Computer managers at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in
Berkeley, Calif., which is involved in broad-based unclassified
scientific research, discovered the intrusions, the Times said.
   The laboratory and its sister institution, the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, which is involved nuclear weapons research
and SDI, are operated by the University of California for the
federal government.
   The break-ins involved a variety of U.S. military computer
systems in this country, Europe and Japan, the Times said,
including systems at the Naval Coastal Systems Command in Panama
City, Fla., the Air Force Systems Command in El Segundo, Calif.,
the Pentagon's Optimus data base and NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
