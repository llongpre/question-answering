   Authorities said today they have
arrested a former U.S. soldier and charged him with espionage for
leading an international spy ring that sold military secrets to the
Soviet Union over the past 10 years.
   Chief Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said the charges against
former Army Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad involved an ``especially grave
case'' of supplying American and NATO defense secrets to the
Soviets through the spy ring.
   The most recent delivery took place last month in Vienna,
Rebmann said.
   ``We can't exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are
involved'' in the case, said Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for
Rebmann. He said it was too soon to say exacly what damage was done
to NATO.
   The U.S. State Department said in a statement in Washington,
``We understand that there has been an apprehension by West German
authorities, but do not consider it appropriate to comment at this
time.''
   But FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich said: ``This is a very
significant matter. The interest to this country is acute. It is a
matter of intense interest to the FBI.''
   Authorities in Sweden said today they have detained two
Hungarian-born brothers who confessed to working for the Hungarian
secret service and who apparently were members of an international
spy ring.
   Sven-Olof Hakansson, chief prosecutor of the Goteborg district,
said the men, both physicians who immigrated in the 1960s, were
detained on Tuesday with radios and coded messages.
   ``We have worked in cooperation with German police because it
was very important to arrest these people at the same time so they
could not warn each other,'' said Torsten Bjorkhede, chief of the
Swedish security police.
   Prechtel said the arrested Swedes were suspected of being part
of the same ring, which he said was based in West Germany and used
couriers from Sweden.
   Hakansson said the suspected spies had traveled several times to
West Germany.
   Prechtel, said in a telephone interview that he couldn't rule
out the possibility the charge of espionage against Conrad might be
raised to treason. The spokesman said Conrad was ``the head'' of
the ring.
   Prechtel said Conrad was from Ohio, but he could not provide the
hometown.
   The statement came after The New York Times reported today that
Swedish and West German authorities had arrested eight people
involved in a spy ring that supplied secret military documents to
the Soviets for at least 10 years.
   Prechtel, speaking from his office in the city of Karlsruhe,
confirmed virtually all of the Times report on the case.
   He confirmed that documents concerning North Atlantic Treaty
Organization defense plans for Europe were believed stolen as well
as the U.S. Army contingency plans for a ground war in Europe
against the Soviet Union.
   But he emphasized that officials were still conducting in-depth
investigations to determine exactly what was missing.
   Prechtel said that while ``several'' people had been taken into
custody or arrested, he could not confirm that the number was eight.
   The ring was based in West Germany, while couriers were based in
neutral Sweden, the spokesman also confirmed.
   Rebmann said Conrad sold secret documents to ``a Soviet bloc
secret service.''
   Conrad has been sent to investigative detention following his
appearance before a special panel of the West German Supreme Court,
Rebmann's office said.
   Rebmann's statement said that Conrad had worked for the U.S.
military for 20 years before his discharge in 1985. It said he was
born in 1947, but did not give his hometown in the United States.
   Principals in the newly uncovered ring, which operated through a
German-Hungarian connection, caused a major security loss to the
United States, according to the Times report, later confirmed by
Rebmann.
   The report said investigators believe the spy ring provided
American, West German and NATO secrets to the Hungarian
intelligence agency. The Hungarians then shared the secrets with
the Soviet Union, officials told the Times.
   The Times said the network was uncovered by West German and U.S.
officials, including agents from the FBI and the Army. The Army has
about 250,000 military personnel in West Germany at more than 200
installations.
   Rebmann's written statement said the charge against Conrad was
``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially
grave case.''
   The statement said that in the seven years before his 1985
discharge, Conrad had access to military defense plans at a U.S.
base in the West German city of Bad Kreuznach.
   ``The accused is under compelling suspicion of having delivered
these documents to a Soviet Bloc secret service by means of a
command officer and couriers living abroad in return for high
payment,'' the statement said.
