   Federal agents said William Troy Landreth could
once crack into the computer networks used by the Department of
Defense and NASA. But now, awash in waves of emotional depression,
he lives in the streets.
   The 24-year old computer whiz with a genius IQ, who as a
teen-ager was the target of a highly publicized FBI crackdown on
computer hackers, now spends his days on park benches and his nights
in shelters and concrete doorways.
   Known at the height of his fame by his code name ``The Hacker,''
Landreth has all but dropped out of society, saying mood-altering
drugs and antidepressants couldn't ward off the depression that has
dogged him.
   But Landreth said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that
he remains confident in his ability to control computers, and could
make lots of money using his talents. But he said he must live by
his own rules.
   ``I could set up a data base system for a company and walk away
with a few thousand dollars for five or six hours work, and they'd
never regret it,'' he said. ``The five or six thousand for five or
six hours of work would interest me, but I haven't fallen for it.
   ``I didn't inherit a great deal of money that's been accumulating
for several eons, so I wouldn't know how to look at money,'' he said.
   Landreth gained notoriety in 1983 when the FBI cracked down on
him and other hackers.
   With an IQ measured at 186, well into the genius category,
Landreth was accused of breaking into the Virginia-based GTE
Telemail electronic mail network to take a look at computer
correspondence from the Defense Department and National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
   Landreth eventually pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud,
was fined $87 for using computer time he didn't pay for and was
placed on three years' probation.
   During his legal problems, Landreth appeared to be in control of
his life, giving lectures to business executives, doing freelance
computer work and promoting a book about his experiences, ``Out of
the Inner Circle,'' which has sold about 68,000 copies.
   But in September 1986, Landreth disappeared, leaving behind a
rambling, eight-page essay touching on such subjects as man's
evolution and immortality, communism and capitalism, nuclear war and
greed, and suicide.
   ``I was bored in school, bored traveling around the country,
bored getting raided by the FBI, bored in prison, bored writing
books, bored being bored,'' read the last page. ``I will probably be
bored dead, but this is my risk to take.''
   Landreth drifted for almost a year, turning up in the Oregon town
of Minnville, near Portland, where he was arrested for violating his
probation.
   He was sent back to San Diego, where he found that he had about
$9,000 waiting for him in book royalties from foreign sales. He
rented an apartment, but it burned down. He eventually landed on the
streets.
   ``The way I see it, I could be retired in five or 10 years, if I
did things in a constructive way,'' he said. ``But I haven't decided
to do that.''
   He prefers, for now, to live by his own definition of freedom,
even though he knows some of his friends and family think he's
wasting his life.
   ``I don't know what (freedom) is good for any more than anyone
else knows what it's good for,'' he said. ``So it's really in how
you look at it.''
