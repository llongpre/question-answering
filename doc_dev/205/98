   A man who was convicted of computer fraud as a
teen-ager faces charges of causing $4 million in damage to a
computer, stealing a security system and gaining access to
long-distance telephone codes.
   U.S. Magistrate Venetta Tassopulos on Thursday ordered Kevin
Mitnick, 25, held without bail.
   ``This thing is so massive, we're just running around trying to
figure out what he did,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Leon Weidman.
``This person, we believe, is very, very dangerous, and he needs to
be detained and kept away from a computer.''
   Mitnick was accused of damaging a Digital Equipment Corp.
computer, stealing a computer security system and obtaining MCI
telephone codes through university computers in Los Angeles and
England.
   His attorney, Anthony J. Patti, refused to comment.
   Mitnick is believed to the first person in the nation to be
prosecuted under a federal law against gaining access to an
interstate computer network for criminal purposes, the Los Angeles
Times reported.
   The FBI, the district attorney's office and the police said they
are just beginning to figure out Mitnick and his alleged high-tech
escapades.
   ``He's several levels above what you would characterize as a
computer hacker,'' said Detective James K. Black, head of the police
computer crime unit. ``He started out with a real driving curiosity
for computers that went beyond personal computers. ... He grew with
the technology.''
   If convicted, Mitnick could receive up to 20 years in prison and
a $500,000 fine.
   Mitnick served six months in a youth facility after being
convicted at age 17 of cracking Pacific Bell's computer to alter
telephone bills, penetrate other computers and steal $200,000 worth
of data from a corporation.
