   The Supreme Court ruled today that a federal
law reducing patent-infringement protection for drug companies
applies to medical devices.
   The court, by a 6-2 vote, refused to reinstate a $26.7 million
award against Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis.
   Eli Lilly and Co. of Indianapolis said Medtronic infringed
patents on a device implanted in patients to correct potentially
fatal heart rhythms.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, upheld
Medtronic's interpretation of a 1984 patent-infringement law. The
statute applies to patented inventions as well as generic drugs, he
said.
   Scalia said Medtronic did not infringe on Eli Lilly's patent as
long as the activities of the former firm were reasonably related
to the development of information necessary to obtain federal
approval for its device. The case now goes back to a lower federal
court to determine whether Medtronic met that condition.
   The 1984 law is intended to help generic drug manufacturers
seeking to place their substitutes for patented drugs on the market
as soon as patents expire.
   The law permits the generic drug firms to get information from
the federal Food and Drug Administration and apply to the FDA for
approval of their substitutes prior to expiration of the patented
drugs.
   Also, as long as the purpose is related to its application to
the FDA, the generic companies are allowed by law to ``make, use or
sell a patented invention'' prior to the patent's expiration.
   Eli Lilly, with support from other major medical companies and
patent holders, said applying the law to medical devices could
undermine health care research and development of life-saving
inventions.
   It said the pace of costly, innovative research will be slowed
because patent holders will fear their work soon would be copied.
   But Medtronic said Eli Lilly is distorting economic reality.
   Medtronic said the value of the heart-implant devices it tested
is less than $415,000. By contrast, it said, Eli Lilly is expected
to sell more than $100 million worth of the devices before a
two-year extension of its patent expires on Oct. 26, 1990.
   Medtronic said its new device is intended to treat cardiac
distrubances painlessly with low-energy electrical impulses as a
substitute for the higher-energy shocks that accompany the Lilly
device.
   Lilly's appeal to the Supreme Court was supported by Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, sponsor of the 1984 legislation, and Rep. Carlos
Moorhead, R-Pa., floor manager of the bill in the House.
   The case is Eli Lilly vs. Medtronic Inc, 89-243.
