   MINNEAPOLIS -- Medtronic Inc., the nation's leading
producer of heart pacemakers, is free to expand into the
lucrative U.S. market for cardiac defibrillators after
settling patent litigation with Eli Lilly &amp; Co.
   Minneapolis-based Medtronic, which settled eight-year-old
lawsuits, was working on the defibrillator -- designed to
alleviate too-rapid heartbeats -- when sued in 1983 by a
company that became a unit of Indianapolis-based Lilly.

   Medtronic and Lilly dropped an array of cross-lawsuits
dealing with the defibrillator and with a "dual-chamber"
cardiac pacemaker on which Medtronic held a patent.
   In settling the various lawsuits -- one of which went to
the U.S. Supreme Court last year -- the two medical giants
cross-licensed all patents to each other that electrically
manage the rhythm of the heart.
   The net effect is that Medtronic, which already sells a
defibrillator in Europe, will be able to pursue the entire
U.S. market, pending clearance by the Food and Drug
Administration. The world-wide defibrillator market is
estimated at $500 million a year.
   Meanwhile, the Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. unit of
Indianapolis-based Lilly will have an opportunity to expand
its sales of dual-chamber pacemakers. These devices, which
sell for as much as $6,700, make up about 20% to 30% of the
$1.3 billion world-wide pacemaker market.
   Medtronic's entry into implantable defibrillators didn't
come cheaply.
   A company release said it will supply pacemakers to
Lilly's CPI unit -- leading at least one analyst to suggest
that Lilly had come out ahead in the costly litigation.
   Ronald Nordmann, of PaineWebber, said that, "reading
between the lines, it looks to me as if Eli Lilly won.
   "No products went from Lilly to Medtronic, but Lilly's CPI
subsidiary received products from Medtronic," said Mr.
Nordmann. "And I don't think there's any cash involved in the
settlement."
   "It's a little bit better than a tie for Lilly," he
concluded.
   Terms of the settlement were confidential. Neither company
would comment on the number of pacemakers being supplied by
Medtronic, nor on whether any cash changed hands.
   The saga began in November 1983, when Intec Inc. filed
suit in Philadelphia federal court alleging Medtronic and
Hahnemann Hospital there had infringed Intec's patents. Lilly
acquired Intec in 1985 and assigned it to its CPI unit.
   A district court jury found Medtronic had indeed infringed
on the patent, but that $26.6 million jury award ultimately
was overturned by the Supreme Court on an issue of patent
law. The court found that Medtronic, through an FDA exception
to patent-infringement law, was allowed to develop the
defibrillator.
   That device, which sells for about $20,000 overseas and is
expected to be more costly in the U.S., contains a three-step
capability of regulating rapid heartbeats.
   A normal heart beats roughly in the range of 70 beats per
minute. The defibrillator, surgically implanted in a
patient's chest, is capable through small electric shocks of
reducing a racing heartbeat to the normal level.
   The Medtronic product, for example, has three levels of
intensity, depending on the severity of the excessive
heartbeat; to a patient, one level is imperceptible, the next
feels like a hiccup and the third is a noticeable shock. This
last stage would kick in only when the patient faced a
potentially life-threatening cardiac event.
   Lawsuits concerning the defibrillator were filed in
Philadelphia and Indianapolis. Separately, Medtronic filed a
Minneapolis lawsuit contending Lilly had infringed its patent
on the dual-chamber pacemakers.
   Pacemakers are for patients with abnormally slow
heartbeats. Medtronic holds about 46% of the world-wide
pacemaker market, maintaining a similar share in the U.S.
That amount almost doubles the share of its nearest
competitor, Pacesetter Systems Inc. unit of Siemens AG.
