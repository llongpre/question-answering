   Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s Hybritech Inc. unit filed a patent infringement suit against Abbott Laboratories in a federal court in Los Angeles. 

   Eli Lilly's unit claims in the suit that North Chicago, Ill.-based Abbott sells diagnostic kits that infringe on Hybritech's Tandem brand name line of testing products. 
Eli Lilly said the Hybritech line is based on a patented method of using monoclonal antibodies to detect pregnancy, cancer and infectious disease. 

   Hybritech is asking the federal court for damages, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions against Abbott, according to the suit. 
Eli Lilly didn't elaborate. 

   Lael F. Johnson, Abbott general counsel, said the company will fight the suit by arguing that the technology of using monoclonal antibodies in diagnostic kits can't be patented. 
"Our position is that once these things were invented it was just plain obvious to use monoclonal antibodies," he said. 

   Many diagnostic kits used to employ antibodies harvested from animals, such as goats and rats, Mr. Johnson said. 
He added that some kits have changed to monoclonal antibodies, which are artificially engineered antibodies. 
Abbott estimates that kits that use monoclonal antibodies represent 7% of Abbott's world-wide diagnostic sales. 

   The suit is similar to one Hybritech filed in 1984 against Monoclonal Antibodies Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., biotechnology concern. 
In September, a federal appeals court overruled a lower court's decision and upheld Hybritech's patent. 
That case has been sent to federal district court in San Francisco, which will determine whether the Mountain View company's products infringe on the Hybritech patent.
