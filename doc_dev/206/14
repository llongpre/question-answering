   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said net income rose 11% to $138.2 million, or 96 cents a share, in the fourth quarter on a 5.6% increase in sales. 

   But on a continuing operations basis, the pharmaceutical giant posted an $86.9 million loss, the result of $271.9 million in restructuring charges and $65 million in special provisions. 

   The total $336.9 million in pretax charges and provisions, which Eli Lilly said it booked to "strengthen long-term profitability," approximately offset the $216 million gain the company realized from its $700 million sale of its Elizabeth Arden cosmetics unit. 
That sale to Faberge Inc., New York, was completed Dec. 22. 

   Lilly included the Arden gain in profit from discontinued operations, which totaled $225.1 million. 
The company posted an increase in net because of a rise in its profit from continuing operations, excluding the charges. 

   A year earlier, profit from continuing operations was $114.3 million, or 80 cents a share. 
Profit from discontinued operations was $10 million. 
Net was $124.3 million, or 87 cents a share. 
Sales rose to $904.9 million from $856.3 million. 
Results were restated to reflect Elizabeth Arden's sale, the company said. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the company's stock closed at $71.75, down 37.5 cents. 

   The rise in Eli Lilly's profit from continuing operations, after excluding the charges, was due to sales increases in each of the units, which include its mainstay pharmaceutical business as well as its medical-instrument, agricultural and biotechnology operations. 

   The company also had "very strong growth," in its international sales, said Richard D. Wood, chairman and chief executive officer. 
Rising sales volumes were largely responsible. 
One-third of the rise, however, resulted from the U.S. dollar's weakness compared with other currencies, said James M. Cornelius, vice president, finance, and chief financial officer. 

   Eli Lilly was also helped by growing gross profits that outpaced sales because of improvements in manufacturing and a lower 1987 tax rate, Mr. Wood said. 

   Eli Lilly's world-wide pharmaceutical sales rose 7% to $2.27 billion, with increases in both U.S. and overseas markets, it said. 
The company said Ceclor, its oral antibiotic, showed an "exceptionally strong," double-digit sales rise, surpassing $500 million in sales. 
That rise more than offset declining sales of another oral antibiotic, Keflex, which has faced a competitive onslaught from generic products since coming off patent last April. 

   For the year, net rose 15% to $643.7 million, or $4.41 a share, from $558.2 million, or $3.89 a share, in 1986. 
Sales rose 9.6% to $3.64 billion from $3.32 billion.
