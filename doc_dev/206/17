   Food and Drug Administration investigators are looking into possible brand-name drug manufacturing problems at an Indianapolis plant owned by Eli Lilly &amp; Co. 

   Disclosure of the FDA's investigation of Lilly comes as the federal agency broadened its separate investigation of the generic drug industry. 
Officials of some generic drug companies have admitted to engaging in bribery, submission of false data and other criminal activities to get their drugs on the market ahead of competitors. 
Generic drugs are usually less expensive versions of brand-name drugs whose patents have expired. 

   The FDA said it will begin comprehensive plant investigations at the nation's 20 leading generic-drug makers. 
The agency is already looking at 11 generic-drug makers and it said last week that it plans to test the 30 top-selling generic drugs on the market. 

   FDA officials said the investigation at Lilly centers on manufacturing and record-keeping problems and has not turned up the illegal practices found among the generic-drug manufacturers. 
"We're talking about apples and oranges here," an FDA spokesman said in Washington. 

   A spokesman for Lilly confirmed that FDA officials were conducting an investigation at an Indianapolis plant that makes tablet and capsule products, such as phenobarbital and potassium chloride. 
Lilly's spokesman also confirmed that in June the company recalled from its wholesalers a thyroid drug and 11 types of vitamins manufactured at the plant. 
He said that the recalls involved a premature loss of the products' potency and that there was no safety hazard involved. 
The spokesman said Lilly didn't know whether the FDA inspection was linked to the recalls. 
"Pharmaceutical companies including Lilly are frequently reviewed by the FDA with regard to their manufacturing processes," said a Lilly spokesman. 
"Lilly is now undergoing such a review." 

   People familiar with the FDA investigation of Lilly said it was triggered by the company's June recall of its products. 
On June 22 Lilly recalled a tablet form of thyroid medication. 
On June 30 the company recalled 11 vitamin products. 

   The FDA sources said that although the agency usually sends its inspectors to plants when there is a recall, the Lilly investigation wasn't being considered routine. 
The sources said the recalled products could turn out to be an indicator of more widespread manufacturing problems at the company. 

   All the products were recalled at the wholesale level. 
"These are relatively small product lines for us," said Lilly's spokesman. 
He said the vitamins that were recalled included a B-complex vitamin and two multi vitamins, Mi-Cebrin and Mi-Cebrin T. 
All the recalled products are sold either under the Lilly or Dista name. 
Dista is a Lilly brand name. 

   Lilly's spokesman said the FDA investigation had been under way at the Indianapolis plant for a number of weeks. 
The investigators have focused on Lilly's documentation and validation procedures for its drugs, the spokesman said. 
Investigators haven't told the company when the investigation would be completed. 

   Meanwhile, a group of California physicians, joined by a University of Washington pharmacy professor and a pharmacologist from the University of California at Los Angeles, petitioned the FDA to hold a hearing on the safety and effectiveness of generic drugs. 
They also requested a moratorium on drug approvals until there is a review of all generics on the market. 

   The FDA said it plans to withdraw three drug approvals from Par Pharmaceutical Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y., and 25 drug approvals from Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., on the ground that the companies made "untrue statements" in seeking FDA clearance to market the generic products. 
Both companies have already voluntarily recalled or suspended production of the drugs involved.
