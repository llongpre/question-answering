   Three drug companies reported robust increases in first-quarter earnings. 

   Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J.; Pfizer Inc. of New York; and Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis, each reported a 14% rise in net income. 

   Warner-Lambert
   Warner-Lambert's world-wide sales, aided by the continuing decline in the U.S. dollar's value, rose 14%, to $928 million. 
Joseph D. Williams, chairman and chief executive officer, said sales grew at each of the core businesses, with the biggest gains registered by confectioneries and non-prescription drugs. 

   Mr. Williams said Warner-Lambert achieved the earnings gains despite record investments in research, advertising and promotion. 
World-wide sales of prescription drugs rose 11% to $288 million, he said, with international sales of prescription drugs up 24%. 

   Prescription drug sales were led by Lopid, a lipid regulator used to lower cholesterol levels, Warner-Lambert said. 
Sales grew because of a highly publicized study, released last November, showing that using the drug significantly lowered risk of a second heart attack. 
Warner-Lambert recently requested permission to expand Lopid's advertised claims in the U.S. to include heart-disease prevention. 

   The company is awaiting U.S. marketing approval for another lipid regulator, the Cholybar brand of cholestyramine, and plans to introduce 60 new products in international markets this year. 

   Warner-Lambert's world-wide sales of non-prescription drugs rose 12% to $314 million. 
World-wide sales were up 12% for Listerine mouthwash and 26% for Rolaids antacid. 
U.S. sales grew 29% for the E.p.t. pregnancy test. 

   Eli Lilly
   Lilly said all business units reported increased results, but it wouldn't break out earnings by segment. 
Pharmaceutical sales rose despite a decline in sales of Keflex, an oral antibiotic, Lilly said. 
The drug's patent expired last April, thus introducing competition from generics. 

   Agricultural sales were helped by favorable weather, Lilly said, which allowed for early application of its herbicides Treflan and Sonalan. 
Lilly disclosed plans to build a pharmaceutical research center for $110 million, to be completed in late 1991. 

   Analysts said Lilly's results exceeded their expectations. 
"It suggests that they're going to have a strong year," said Craig Baskin of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. 

   Because of the first-quarter results, Ronald Noordman, analyst with PaineWebber Inc., boosted his full-year estimates to between $5.25 and $5.30 a share. 
He had been predicting $5.20. 
In 1987, Lilly earned $643.7 million, or $4.41 a share, including a $233.3 million gain from discontinued operations. 

   Pfizer
   Pfizer said that world-wide sales rose 16%, to $1.3 billion, for the quarter, aided by strong gains in its five business segments. 
Sales advances were 16% in health care, 17% in specialty chemicals and 18% at materials science. 
Consumer sales rose 17% while agricultural sales climbed 15%. 

   Among pharmaceutical sales, the leader was Pfizer's anti-arthritis drug Feldene, with a 33% sales increase. 
Hospital sales rose 14% world-wide.
