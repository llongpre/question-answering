   The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to referee
a big-money battle over patent rights for medical devices.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Eli Lilly and Co. of
Indianapolis, seeking reinstatement of a $26.7 million award
against Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis. Eli Lilly said Medtronic
infringed on patents on a device implanted in patients to correct
potentially fatal heart rhythms.
   At issue are provisions of a 1984 federal law that reduced
patent infringement protection for drug companies.
   A federal appeals court here interpreted the law to apply to
medical devices as well as generic drugs. The appeals court last
March threw out the $26.7 million judgment a lower court awarded
Lilly.
   The 1984 law is aimed at helping generic drug manufacturers
seeking to place their substitutes for patented, brand-name drugs
on the market as soon as patents expire.
   The law permits the generic drug firms to get information from
the federal Food and Drug Administration and apply to the FDA for
approval of their substitutes prior to expiration of the patents.
   Also, as long as the purpose is related to its application to
the FDA, the generic drug companies are allowed by law to ``make,
use or sell a patented invention'' prior to the patent's expiration.
   The appeals court here said ``the clear intent of Congress was
to create an FDA experimental use exception'' for research
activities. ``No persuasive reason is suggested why Congress would
create an exception with respect to those activities for drugs
only,'' the appeals court said.
   Eli Lilly, with support from other major medical companies and
patent holders, said the ruling could undermine health care
research and development of lifesaving devices.
   The companies said the pace of costly, innovative research will
be slowed because patent holders will fear their work soon might be
copied.
   But Medtronic said Eli Lilly is distorting economic reality.
   Medtronic said the value of the heart-implant devices it tested
is less than $415,000. By contrast, it said, Eli Lilly is expected
to sell more than $100 million worth of the devices before a
two-year extension of its patent expires on Oct. 26, 1990.
   ``Notwithstanding the limited nature of Medtronic's
FDA-controlled testing, Lilly contended that the testing gave
Medtronic a headstart towards an entry into the commercial
marketplace,'' Medtronic said.
   It added that if Lilly's interpretation of the 1984 law is
correct, it is up to Congress and not the Supreme Court to correct
the problem.
   Medtronic said its new device is intended to treat cardiac
disturbances painlessly with low-energy electrical impulses as a
substitute for the higher-energy shocks that accompany the Lilly
device.
   Lilly's appeal to the high court was supported by Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, sponsor of the 1984 legislation, and Rep. Carlos
Moorhead, R-Pa., floor manager of the bill in the House.
   The case is Eli Lilly vs. Medtronic, Inc., 89-243.
