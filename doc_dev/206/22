   Congressional investigators have broadened their investigation of the generic-drug industry to include production problems reported by federal inspectors at a plant operated by Eli Lilly &amp; Co. 

   In a letter to Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Frank E. Young, the chairman of the House investigations subcommittee called for records on inspections of more than 50 Lilly manufacturing plants dating back to 1985. 
Subcommittee chairman John D. Dingell said the request was triggered by the FDA's disclosure Tuesday of widespread quality-control problems at one of Lilly's drug plants in Indianapolis. 

   Lilly said it had halted all drug shipments from the Indianapolis plant and recalled 10 products made there after the FDA reported the findings of its four-month investigation. 

   Separately, FDA officials disclosed yesterday that three other Lilly drug-manufacturing plants are under investigation in Puerto Rico. 
An FDA spokesman in Washington said documents from the Indianapolis investigation were sent to Puerto Rico and that investigators were "looking for the same sort of problems that were found in Indianapolis." 
The Puerto Rican investigation was started in late August, the FDA spokesman said. 

   FDA officials said they would probably decide within the next few weeks whether to expand their investigation to other Lilly manufacturing facilities. 

   "We are examining the results of the Indianapolis inspection to determine the magnitude and severity of the problems there and the likelihood they may affect the manufacture of other products," said Carl C. Reynolds, the FDA's Detroit district director. 
The FDA's Detroit office is in charge of the investigation of Lilly in Indianapolis. 

   A Lilly spokesman said yesterday the company had received a call from a staff member of Rep. Dingell's subcommittee "expressing interest" in the FDA probe of the Indianapolis plant. 
The Lilly spokesman declined to give details. 
He also declined to discuss any details of the Puerto Rican investigation. 

   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Lilly's shares closed at $59.00, down 62.5 cents. 

   Rep. Dingell's subcommittee has been leading the federal probe into alleged wrongdoing by generic-drug makers. 
So far, three FDA employees have pleaded guilty to charges of taking illegal gratuities from generic-drug makers, and manufacturing and record-keeping problems have been found at nearly a dozen generic-drug makers' plants. 

   The subcommittee's request for the inspection reports on Lilly marks the first time the federal probe has been extended to brand-name drug makers. 
"We want to make sure that the FDA and the subcommittee treat the brand-name companies the same way the generics are treated," a subcommittee staff member said yesterday. 

   The House panel is seeking to learn whether Lilly filed false or misleading information with the FDA about its manufacturing processes in Indianapolis, the staff member said. 
"We'd also be concerned if they changed drug formulations without notifying the FDA or didn't report problems like stability failures with their drugs," he said. 

   The FDA's report on its Indianapolis investigation relates a number of instances where Lilly's drugs failed to maintain their stability or to dissolve properly. 
The report says Lilly did not maintain proper followup records on the failures.
