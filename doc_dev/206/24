   Two major pharmaceutical makers reported double-digit
increases in second-quarter earnings. A third, American Home
Products Corp., reported a slight decline after a
year-earlier gain.
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said its earnings continued to reflect the
same trends in its core product line that have contributed to
growth in recent quarters. And Upjohn Co. said it had record
quarterly sales, including animal health products.

   American Home Products
                                                                                                       

   American Home Products, based in New York, said profit in
the year-ago quarter included an after tax gain of $70
million, or 23 cents a share. Sales for the quarter rose to
$1.62 billion from $1.61 billion.
   Even so, American Home said the company's continuing
operations increased profit because pharmaceutical sales in
year-ago period were off sharply. The company said prior to
the second quarter last year it discontinued a variety of
promotional programs to wholesalers, which had reduced sales.
   A company spokesman noted that the recent quarter's sales
were very good, and the company's Premarin, an estrogen
replacement drug, and Orudis, a pain medicine, were
especially strong.
   For the six months, sales declined slightly to $3.38
billion from $3.42 billion; the year-ago period included
sales from the businesses the company has shed.
                                                                                                       

   Eli Lilly &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   The Indianapolis pharmaceutical giant said a 12% increase
in sales, to $1.38 billion, reflected volume increases in the
company's domestic and international markets. World-wide
sales in the second quarter of pharmaceutical products such
as Axid, its anti-ulcer drug; Ceclor, an antibiotic; the
cardiovascular product, Dobutrex; Humulin, a genetically
produced insulin; and its Humatrope growth hormone, grew from
the previous year.
   The company added that the drug Prozac and the antibiotic
Vancocin contributed to its sales increase. In the first
quarter, the rapid growth of Prozac, the controversial
anti-depressant, was believed to have slowed -- reflecting
numerous lawsuits alleging the product may be linked to
suicide attempts by some patients suffering from depression.
Lilly said it doesn't discuss sales of individual drugs.
   The company also said that its medical devices and
diagnostics division contributed "significantly" to the
quarter, led by the division's Advanced Cardiovascular
Systems Inc., Cardiac Pacemakers Inc., and Hybritech Inc.
subsidiaries.
   Lilly said manufacturing costs and operating expenses grew
at a slower rate than sales, resulting in a 20% gain in
operating profit. Research and development costs rose 12% to
$183.1 million.
                                                                                                       

   Upjohn Co.
                                                                                                       

   Upjohn said its strong earnings accompanied record
quarterly sales of $859 million, up 14% from a year earlier.
   The Kalamazoo, Mich., company said its sales of
pharmaceutical products rose 16% on strong performances from
Ansaid, an anti-inflammatory agent; Xanax, a tranquilizer;
and Halcion, a sleeping pill.
   Sales of its agricultural products jumped 10%. All
businesses in that unit contributed to the sales gain,
officials said. Animal health products were led by the
antibiotic, Naxcel, and the feed additive, Lincomix.
   Operating profit in the quarter was $168 million, compared
with $175 million last year. Earnings from continuing
operations were up 34%, after excluding a pension credit and
other nonrecurring items from last year's results.
   The results pushed up Upjohn's firsthalf earnings, and
sales increased 12% to $1.66 billion.
