   Eli Lilly and Co. has discontinued
manufacturing 60 products and versions of products, according to a
notification letter sent to drug wholesalers around the country.
   Representatives of several pharmaceutical wholesaling companies
said the products involved were either old or slow-selling and that
the manufacturing halts would have little or no financial impact on
them.
   ``It shouldn't cause an problems. Our buyers reacted to it as a
routine maintenance'' of Lilly's product line, said a spokesman for
Bergen Brunswig Corp., a California-based drug wholesaler.
   In the letter, dated March 26, Lilly told wholesalers to
continue to fill orders from their inventories and then, after
inventories were depleted, to classify them as ``manufacturer
discontinued.''
   Lilly said it knew of no other manufacturers for 10 of the
products, including two package sizes of 32 milligram Darvon
capsules. However, other dosage sizes of Darvon are available.
   In additions, some packaging formats of Axid, Lilly's anti-ulcer
drug, and of Keflex, an antibiotic, were discontinued, but Lilly
continues to manufacture those products in other formats.
   Several of the products discontinued were among those cited in
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's highly critical inspection
report on Lilly's manufacturing practices issued last year.
   Also discontinued two versions of Bacitracin ointment, an
over-the-counter antibiotic. According to the FDA, Lilly recalled
about 6,000 tubes of Bacitracin in February after testing showed
that the product might not retain its potency through its
expiration date.
