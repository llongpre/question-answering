<HEAD>Prozac Sales Lead to Record Quarterly Earnings for Eli Lilly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>

   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said Tuesday its earnings
rose 26 percent to a record $274 million for the second quarter,
led by sales of the antidepressant drug Prozac and other
pharmaceuticals.
   For the three months ending June 30, earnings per share were 93
cents, compared with 75 cents on net income of $217 million during
the same period in 1989. Sales rose 24 percent to a record $1.23
billion from $986.6 million during the second quarter last year.
   Chairman Richard D. Wood said Lilly experienced sales growth in
each of its operations.
   ``Sales increased in both international and domestic markets.
Higher unit volume continued to be the main contributor to the
quarter's results,'' Wood said. Operating costs grew slower than
sales, he added.
   Worldwide sales of pharmaceutical products ``were significantly
higher than those of the second quarter of last year,'' Lilly said
in a prepared statement. Besides Prozac, other pharmaceutical sales
leaders included the drugs Axid, Ceclor, Dobutrex, Humatrope and
Humulin, Lilly said.
   Lilly also reported record results for the first six months of
1990. Net income increased 23 percent to $615 million, or $2.07 per
share, on sales of $2.47 billion.
