   Major U.S. drug makers reported higher earnings for the
fourth quarter and year as a result of strong sales growth
and level manufacturing costs.
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis, said earnings rose 13% to
$255.3 million, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, a New Brunswick, N.J.,
maker of pharmaceuticals and health-care products, posted a
14% boost to $232 million.

   Marion Merrell Dow Inc., a Kansas City, Mo., company
created by the 1989 merger of Marion Laboratories and Merrell
Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., said fourth-quarter net income was
$112 million, up 53% from pro-forma 1989 levels.
                                                                                                       

   Eli Lilly
                                                                                                       

   The pharmaceutical giant posted its 30th consecutive year
of sales and earnings growth. However, sales for the quarter
grew at a faster rate, 26%, than did earnings.
   Sales growth in each of Lilly's operations paced the
company's performance, as did the fact that manufacturing
costs and operating expenses for the year increased at a
slower rate than did sales.
   World-wide 1990 sales of pharmaceutical products rose 26%
to $3.71 billion, with growth led by the antibiotic Ceclor
and the anti-depressant drug Prozac. Prozac's growth came
despite lawsuits alleging the product may be linked to
suicide attempts by some patients suffering from depression.
   Other products contributing to the growth were the
anti-ulcer drug Axid, the cardiovascular product Dobutrex,
Humatrope, a human growth hormone, Humulin, a genetically
produced insulin, and the antibiotic Vancocin HCl.
   The earnings increase was held down by higher interest
costs related to the company's stock buy-back program and
lower earnings in the DowElanco agricultural chemicals unit.
   Chairman Richard D. Wood also said the company raised
capital spending for the year by 82%, primarily for higher
production capacity and environmental projects.
                                                                                                       

   Johnson &amp; Johnson
                                                                                                       

   The company said pharmaceutical sales paced earnings for
the fourth quarter and year. The concern posted a 13%
increase in fourth-quarter sales to $2.79 billion from $2.47
billion.
   The company also said the weakness of the dollar against
other currencies boosted sales; more than half of the
company's sales are overseas.
   The pharmaceutical sector outpaced the company's other
businesses. Pharmaceutical sales for 1990 rose 24%, paced by
the anti-fungal drugs Terazol and Nizoral, and the
antihistamine Hismanal.
   The company didn't introduce any drugs in 1990, but the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved several,
including the anemia drug Procrit, the antibiotic Floxin, the
cardiovascular drug Vascor and Duragesic, an anti-pain skin
patch.
                                                                                                       

   Marion Merrell Dow
                                                                                                       

   Sales for the fourth quarter rose 18% to $630 million from
the pro-forma figure of $535 million for the last quarter of
1989.
   The company's first full-year results showed sales of
$2.46 billion, up 11% over the 1989 pro-forma numbers.
   The top contributors to sales for the fourth quarter and
the year were the Cardizem line of cardiovascular products
and Seldane, an antihistamine product. Seldane sales for the
quarter more than doubled, compared with the year-earlier
quarter; this was partly due to the fact that the company
launched sales of the drug in Japan in 1990 under the name
Triludan. Revenue from the drug in Japan for the year
exceeded $50 million.
   Fourth-quarter sales of Carafate, a drug for duodenal
ulcers, rose 17%.
