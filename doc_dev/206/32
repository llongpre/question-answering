   A U.K. appeals court decision probably will force about 500 Britons to drop their suits against Eli Lilly &amp; Co. over its anti-arthritic drug Oraflex. 

   Three appeals judges yesterday upheld last month's High Court ruling that all 1,500 Britons claiming the drug caused illness or death in their families must share the estimated #6 million ($9.9 million) court costs equally if their litigation fails. 
The suits against the Indianapolis-based drug maker and the British government seek unspecified damages. 

   The claimants' lawyers unsuccessfully argued in court Tuesday that only the roughly 1,000 plaintiffs eligible for government legal aid should pay the court costs. 
Yesterday's ruling means the 500 plaintiffs who don't qualify for government aid but can't afford the legal fees probably will drop their suits against Lilly, their lawyers said. 

   In 1985, Lilly pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to 25 criminal counts for failing to inform U.S. officials about four deaths and six illnesses in Britain among patients taking the drug. 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials have said that Oraflex, known as Opren in the U.K., has been "possibly" linked to 49 deaths in the U.S. and "several hundred abroad." 
Lilly already has settled several U.S. lawsuits out of court. 

   After yesterday's ruling, six lawyers representing about 1,200 U.K. claimants called on Lilly and the British government agency that approved the drug in the U.K. "to compensate all victims of Opren, as Eli Lilly has done in America." 

   A settlement with both the drug company and the U.K. Committee on the Safety of Medicine was "nearly achieved" before this week's appeals court hearing, the lawyers said in a statement. 
"It cannot be right for Eli Lilly and the government to delay settlement until they see how many victims have had to drop out," their statement went on. 

   Lilly began to sell Oraflex in the U.K. in October 1980 and in the U.S. in May 1982. 
When Britain banned the drug on Aug. 5, 1982, Lilly withdrew it from the U.S. and other international markets. 

   In 1984, an Indiana judge dismissed a local suit against Lilly by more than 400 Britons who alleged that Oraflex had harmed them. 
The judge said they should file their claims in British courts. 

   Rodger Pannone, a plaintiffs' lawyer here, said yesterday that some of the 500 British claimants might return to the Indiana court because they had been "denied access" to the U.K. courts. 
It wasn't immediately clear whether any plaintiffs were involved in both the Indiana and British cases. 

   The appeals court also ordered the plaintiffs' lawyers to promptly seek a High Court deadline for when claimants must decide whether to drop their suits. 

   Lilly declined comment, saying it hadn't had an opportunity to study the decision with its U.K. counsel. 
Lilly shares closed yesterday at $92.375, up $2.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
