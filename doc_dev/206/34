GENENTECH, the US biotechnology company, said it had filed a suit against
Eli Lilly, the pharmaceuticals company, charging that Lilly's manufacture of
a human growth hormone, used to treat dwarfism, infringes a new Genentech
patent.
The move came after Genentech had been granted a patent covering basic
processes used in recombinant DNA technology or 'cloning'.
Genentech, a pioneer in the use of recombinant DNA technology to produce
pharmaceuticals, launched its first product, a human growth hormone, in
1985. Lilly entered the market two years later with its own version of human
growth hormone.
Since then, the two companies have been waging legal battles over patent
rights.
Eli Lilly said last night: 'This is yet another suit in the ongoing
litigation.'
Genentech said its new patent resulted from early biotechnology research
conducted by Dr Keiichi Itakura and Dr Arthur Riggs at the City of Hope
National Medical Centre.
'Their research led to the production of the first useful protein by
recombinant DNA technology, which is widely acknowledged as one of the most
significant scientific achievements of this century,' said Mr Stephen Rains,
Genentech's vice-president of intellectual property.
Genentech has already licensed its recombinant DNA technology, including
that covered by the new patent, to 28 other companies in the biotechnology
field.
In 1990, Roche Holdings acquired a 60 per cent stake in Genentech for
Dollars 2.1bn.
Separately, the Food and Drug Administration is set to review Genentech's
application for approval of Pulmozyme, a treatment for cystic fibrosis.
