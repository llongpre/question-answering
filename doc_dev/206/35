ELI LILLY of the US is cutting about 10 per cent of its worldwide
pharmaceuticals workforce and shedding a further 2,000 staff throughout its
operations, in an effort to remain competitive in an increasingly hostile
industry.
Ten per cent, or 2,000 positions, are expected to disappear by mid-1994
through a combination of voluntary early retirement, attrition and selective
hiring. Lilly hopes to eliminate the second 2,000 jobs by further attrition,
cutting use of temporary and contract workers and consultants.
The move marks the first big initiative by Lilly's new management. Its
former chief executive, Mr Vaughn Bryson, resigned in June after clashing
with Lilly's board. Lilly's failure to produce new, big-selling drugs and
its disappointing results contributed to the resignation. Mr Bryson was
replaced by Mr Randall Tobias, former vice chairman of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph.
Lilly plans to accelerate the expansion of its European pharmaceutical
operations, but sharply to reduce the size of its London headquarters - from
35 staff to five - and its Vienna regional office.
'These actions are the first in what we expect to be a series of decisions
that will help us achieve stronger long-term growth by reducing our
expenses, improving our efficiencies and expanding our capabilities,' said
Mr Tobias. 'These are among many alternatives we're considering in light of
our changing global markets and the economic realities of those markets.'
The Indianapolis-based company has been hit by pressure to reduce drug
prices, and has been plagued by the absence of important new drugs.
As a result of its early-retirement programme and job cuts in Europe, Lilly
said it would take special pre-tax charges against fourth-quarter earnings.
The company predicted third quarter earnings of 98 cents to Dollars 1 a
share. On Wall Street, Lilly's shares closed Dollars 3 1/2 up at Dollars 53
5/8.
