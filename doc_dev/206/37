   SmithKline Beecham PLC said it received Food and Drug
Administration approval to begin marketing its Relafen
arthritis drug.
   Relafen was among a batch of new prescription drugs
approved by the FDA in late December, including a Hoffmann-La
Roche Inc. antidote for tranquilizer overdoses and an Eli
Lilly &amp; Co. antibiotic product.

   Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, will sell its new drug,
loracarbef, under the brand name Lorabid, as a broad-spectrum
treatment for bronchitis, pneumonia, strep throat, sinus- and
middle-ear infections, urinary-tract infections and certain
skin infections, including impetigo. FDA officials described
Lorabid as a successor to Ceclor, a major Eli Lilly drug.
   "They put a lot of work into developing this drug," said
Bruce Burlington, an FDA official. "They had 10,000 people in
clinical trials, which is a much larger number than usual."
   SmithKline Beecham shares climbed on the Relafen
announcement, which unlike word of the Eli Lilly and
Hoffmann-La Roche approvals, came before markets closed
Friday. London-based SmithKline's American depositary
receipts closed Tuesday at $86.25, up $4, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   Relafen, SmithKline's brand of nabumetone, is one of a new
class of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment
of severe arthritis, particularly rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis. About 13 million people suffer from arthritis
in the U.S., SmithKline said. There currently are more than
15 such non-steroidal arthritis drugs being marketed, "and
few substantial differences have been demonstrated in their
ulcer-causing potential," the company said. What
distinguishes Relafen is that it is non-acidic and is a
"prodrug"that is, it does not become active until after it
passes through the stomach and is transformed by the liver,
said the company, whose U.S. operations are based in
Philadelphia.
   SmithKline said that "in controlled clinical trials,
including 1,677 patients treated (with Relafen), cumulative
incidence of peptic ulcers was 0.3% at three to six months,
0.5% at one year and 0.8% at two years." The company said
1,140 of the patients were followed in the trial for a year,
and 927 were followed for two years.
   Relafen currently is marketed in several other countries;
world-wide sales are about $50 million. With the U.S. market
included, some analysts expect sales to reach $200 million in
1992.
   Hoffmann-La Roche plans to market its new drug,
flumazenil, under the brand name Mazicon. The drug reverses
the sedative effects of Valium, Halcion and other drugs that
are used in anti-anxiety and anti-depressant therapy or as a
part of general anesthesia.
   "It's the first antidote to Valium -- and other
benzodiazepine -- overdoses," said Robert Temple, a senior
FDA official. "Up until now, all you could do is provide
(life) support for them." Such overdoses can be fatal,
particularly if the drugs are taken along with alcohol.
   Hoffmann-La Roche, the U.S. unit of Swiss drug maker Roche
Holding Ltd., also makes Valium. Mazicon is expected to be
widely used to help anesthesized patients wake up after
surgery.
   The FDA, under Commissioner David Kessler, approved 30 new
prescription drugs in 1991, seven more than the previous
year. The agency said it also cut its average approval time
last year by a few months. Now it takes the FDA about two
years to approve new drugs.
   Other late-December approvals include:
   -- Simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, which Merck &amp;
Co.'s Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme division plans to market as Zocor.
It is pharmacologically similar to another Merck drug,
lovastatin, which is sold under the brand name Mevacor.
"Whether simvastatin has any advantages isn't clear yet,"
said an FDA drug-review official.
   -- Cefprozil monohydrate, an antibiotic developed by
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. to treat mild-to-moderate
respiratory infections as well as certain skin infections.
The company will market it as Cefzil.
   -- Isosorbide mononitrate, or ISMO, a drug made by
American Home Products Corp.'s Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories for
the prevention of angina pectoris due to heart disease.
   -- Enoxacin, a Warner-Lambert Co. drug to treat
urinary-tract infections and the venereal disease gonorrhea.
The drug, with a brand name of Penetrex, is similar to others
on the market.
