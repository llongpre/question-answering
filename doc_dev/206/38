   INDIANAPOLIS -- Eli Lilly &amp; Co. signed a four-year
research pact with closely held Neurogenetic Corp., under
which the pharmaceutical company will fund Neurogenetic's
development of neurological drugs.
   Lilly, which said it will acquire an equity stake in the
Paramus, N.J., company, purchased the exclusive world-wide
license to Neurogenetic's genetically engineered versions of
the human neurotransmitter known as serotonin.

   Terms of the pact weren't disclosed. While the agreement
with Lilly marks the first commercial partnership
Neurogenetic has formed, the small company made it clear that
it will seek further links with other drug makers, and will
push forward with its own research.
   Nerve cells are turned on and off by chemical messengers,
known as neurotransmitters, that fit into receptors.
Knowledge of how those receptors are activated, many
scientists think, may help in development of drugs to control
migraine headaches, depression and anxiety.
   Lilly's big-selling Prozac anti-depressant works by
slowing brain cells' intake of serotonin, for example.
Research into that family of neurotransmitters is being
pursued by a number of drug companies.
   Neurogenetic makes genetically engineered receptors, which
can speed such research by allowing scientists to directly
observe how a potential drug will affect the desired receptor
without time-consuming tests on animal tissue.
   Lilly, Neurogenetic said, will fund research "directed at
integrating these cloned receptors into ongoing serotonin
research efforts at Lilly." Under the agreement, Neurogenetic
will receive royalties on sales of any Lilly products that
come out of the collaboration.
   Neurogenetic, which said "several" drug makers have asked
it to consider cloning specific so-called peptide receptors,
will "choose one partner for a collaboration in this area"
later this year.
