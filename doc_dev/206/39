   Monoclonal Antibodies Inc. said a federal judge in San Francisco, as expected, issued a preliminary injunction blocking it from selling products that account for 80% of its sales. 

   The biotechnology concern said Judge Marilyn Patel granted a motion by Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s Hybritech unit for an injunction against the sale of all Monoclonal products named in a Hybritech patent-infringement lawsuit. 
An Eli Lilly spokesman said the company had no immediate comment on the action, but expects to comment later this week. 

   Monoclonal said it is "taking steps to minimize the effect of the injunction," by redesigning major products such as its OvuStick ovulation test and Advance pregnancy test to avoid infringement of the Hybritech patent. 

   Monoclonal also has cut its staff about 30% and is developing new tests for detecting sexually transmitted diseases and drug abuse, which it believes "could make an important contribution" to sales. 
The company said it hopes to begin shipments of the new products in early 1988. 

   As previously reported, Monoclonal said in March that the judge's injunction, which is expected to cost the company about $1.1 million in sales each quarter, was forthcoming. 
The suit, filed in 1984 by then-independent Hybritech, charges that Monoclonal infringed on a technology that uses antibodies to detect and monitor physical conditions such as pregnancy. 

   Monoclonal prevailed in the initial trial, but a federal appeals court last September upheld the validity of the Hybritech patent and sent the case back to the trial court. 
The injunction is expected to remain in place until the court resolves the infringement question, a Monoclonal official said. 
Monoclonal has asked the court to stay the injunction, he said, and is asking for a new trial, but it is "not clear" whether those requests will be granted. 

   In the year ended March 31, Monoclonal had a net loss of $8.1 million, which included charges of $4.3 million related to withdrawal of a product line. 
Revenue for the year was $7.5 million, of which about $6.2 million came from product sales. 
As previously reported, the company's auditor intends to issue a qualified opinion on Monoclonal's year-end financial statements because of uncertainty about the outcome of the legal proceedings. 

   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Monoclonal shares closed at $4, unchanged. 
Eli Lilly closed at $84.125, up 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
