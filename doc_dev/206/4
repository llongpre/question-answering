ELI LILLY, the large US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday unveiled a 14 per
cent advance in first-quarter after-tax profits, in line with the strength
in the drugs sector.
The group made Dollars 495.8m in the three months to the end of March,
compared with Dollars 430.1m in the same period a year ago.
The profit figures were scored on sales of Dollars 1.44bn, up 16 per cent on
the previous year's figure. Eli said the improvement derived largely from
volume increases in both its domestic and international markets.
Among the main product contributors were Axid, which treats ulcers; Ceclor,
an antibiotic and Eli Lilly's top seller; Humulin, a genetically-engineered
insulin; Humantrope, a growth hormone also genetically-engineered by Eli
Lilly; and Prozac, the antidepressant, which has run into some controversy,
provoking lawsuits which claim that the drug has harmful side-effects.
Eli Lilly acknowledged that cost increases outstripped sales growth in the
quarter, saying that the rise in marketing and administrative expenses from
Dollars 303.6m to Dollars 365.7m reflected added promotional costs on newer
products.
Research and development expenditure advanced to Dollars 184.5m from Dollars
163.1m.
