   An anonymous benefactor described as a "Fairy Godparent" offered to help pay legal fees for about 500 Britons so they can pursue their lawsuits against Eli Lilly &amp; Co. 

   The offer means the claimants "probably don't need to" drop their suits against the U.S. drug maker over its anti-arthritic drug Oraflex, said Rodger Pannone, their lawyer here. 

   Some 500 plaintiffs seemed likely to give up their litigation against the Indianapolis-based concern after a High Court ruled in May that all 1,500 Britons who claimed Oraflex caused illness or death in their families must share an estimated #6 million ($9.9 million) in court costs if their litigation fails. 

   "If this will help facilitate resolution of the issues it will be beneficial to all parties involved," said an Eli Lilly spokeswoman. 

   The donor's existence was revealed yesterday when a High Court judge set an Oct. 9 deadline for plaintiffs to decide whether to drop their lawsuits. 
The judge noted "a benefactor" was "prepared to offer to provide very substantial sums of money to fund" the 500 claimants' cases, describing the gift as "the 'Fairy Godparent's' generosity." 

   The lawsuits against Lilly and the British government seek unspecified damages. 
In 1985, Lilly pleaded guilty in U.S. court to 25 criminal counts for failing to inform U.S. officials about four deaths and six illnesses in Britain among patients taking the drug.
