   Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, said a federal court in Philadelphia granted a request by Eli Lilly &amp; Co. to stop Medtronic until 1990 from making, using or selling devices to treat tachyarrhythmia, a heart condition. 

   A jury last month awarded Lilly $26.5 million in a patent infringement suit filed by Lilly in 1983 involving two patents for the devices. 
Medtronic, which makes implantable biomedical devices, said the final court order is expected next month. 
Lilly, Indianapolis, is a drug, medical-instruments and agricultural-products concern. 

   Medtronic said it disputes both the jury verdict and the injunction and intends to assert that position in post-trial proceedings. 
It added that clinical trials of these devices will continue outside the U.S. and commercial release is expected in several countries in 1989. 
It said it aims for entry into the U.S. market in the early 1990s. 

   Lilly said it is pleased that the court confirmed the enforceability of the patent and that it issued an injunction to prevent Medtronic from using the devices in the U.S. until Lilly's patent expires in 1990.
