   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said it received United Kingdom government approval to market Axid, a drug used to treat peptic ulcers. 
The product became available for marketing Monday. 

   The Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical concern said the oral medication belongs to a class of therapeutic agents that decrease production of stomach acid associated with peptic ulcers. 

   Lilly said Axid is under U.S. regulatory review and has been approved by Italy, Switzerland and France. 
The company said Axid will be marketed in those countries following receipt of government pricing approvals or completion of pricing reviews.
