   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said it received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market a new form of genetically engineered human growth hormone. 

   But Lilly's ability to market the drug may depend on the outcome of a lawsuit filed against the FDA by Genentech Inc., a biotechnology concern based in South San Francisco, Calif. 

   Lilly's new drug, called Humatrope, is used to treat certain forms of dwarfism in children induced by a hormone deficiency. 
It will compete with Protropin, a growth hormone drug that Genentech began marketing in 1985. 

   The two drugs have slightly different amino-acid sequences. 
While Lilly's drug is identical in chemistry and structure to the growth hormone produced by the human body, the Genentech drug contains one additional amino acid. 
Because of this, fewer patients have an immune reaction to Humatrope than to Protropin, Indianapolis-based Lilly said. 

   That difference could give Lilly a significant edge in the marketplace, some analysts said. 
But Genentech, in what could be a precedent-setting test of the FDA's 1983 "orphan" drug act, is fighting to keep the Lilly drug out of the marketplace. 

   Both drugs have been awarded orphan-drug status under the act, which was designed to spur research into drugs to treat diseases with fewer than 200,000 victims. 
Such status entitles their manufacturers to an exclusive seven-year marketing period before competitive pharmaceuticals can be approved. 
A new Genentech drug -- which, like Humatrope, contains one fewer amino acid -- hasn't been awarded orphan drug status. 

   Last week, Genentech sued the FDA in federal court in Washington seeking clarification of how the act applies to genetically engineered drugs. 
The biotechnology concern contends that its second version of Protropin is simply an "improved" product that warrants the orphan-drug status already granted to the original. 

   Genentech also charged that the agency may have violated the orphan-drug act by granting orphan status to the Lilly drug. 
It sought a temporary restraining order preventing the FDA from approving Humatrope. 
Although that motion was denied, a hearing on a preliminary injunction was set for March 26. 

   Genentech's suit, while addressing an important question for gene-splicing drug makers, is clearly aimed at protecting what the company sees as a lucrative market. 
Sales of Protropin, first developed in 1979 to treat certain forms of hormone-deficiency-related dwarfism in children, reached $43.6 million in 1986 -- its first full-year of marketing. 

   A Lilly spokesman refused to comment specifically on the Genentech suit. 
However, he said the company expects a "normal launch" of its drug within a few weeks.
