<TEXT>     For all of 1990, the Indianapolis-based company had a profit of $1.127
billion, or $3.90 per share, up 21 percent from the $939.5 billion, or $3.20 a
share, earned the previous year. Sales rose 24 percent to $5.19 billion from
$4.176 billion.;    Lilly said sales of the antibiotic Ceclor and the
antidepressant Prozac were particularly strong during the fourth quarter. But
those gains were partially offset by a loss from its stock buyback program and
lower earnings from its DowElanco division.;    DowElanco, a plant science
unit, is Lilly's joint venture with Dow Chemical Co. Lilly, which holds a 40
percent stake in the venture, did not provide a breakdown of DowElanco results.  </TEXT>
