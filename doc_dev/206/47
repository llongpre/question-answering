MOODY'S Investor Service, the US rating agency, is reviewing the long-term
debt of Eli Lilly, the US pharmaceuticals group, for possible downgrade from
its current Triple A rating.
Moody's said the review was provoked by concerns the company's product
pipeline might not generate enough revenues and profits to justify the
agency's highest rating. About Dollars 900m of long-term debt of Lilly and
guaranteed entities would be affected.
The review comes after last week's abrupt resignation of Mr Vaugh Bryson,
Lilly's chief executive, who had been in charge for just 20 months.
Mr Bryson took the blame for Lilly's disappointing sales and product
development, losing out in a boardroom struggle. He was replaced by Mr
Randall Tobias, a well-regarded vice-chairman at AT&amp;T.
Lilly this week suspended trials of the anti-viral drug Fialuridine (FIAU),
once thought to be a potential money-spinner. The drug, seen as a possible
cure for hepatitis B, was licensed by Lilly last year. It halted trials
after adverse side-effects, and will conduct further studies before deciding
whether tests will resume.
Moody's said: 'Without FIAU, Lilly's new product line is unusually lean for
the intermediate term and may be hard-pressed to offset the maturity of the
existing product portfolio.' It said the debt review would assess Lilly's
product pipeline, prospects for profitability, and the impact on capital.
Lilly is heavily dependent on sales of the anti-depressant, Prozac, which
faces increasing competition, and the anti-biotic, Ceclor, which lost part
of its patent protection last year, and will lose the rest in 1994. Sales of
new drugs, such as Lorabid, an intended replacement for Ceclor, have not
taken off.
