<TEXT>
<P>
Eli Lilly &amp; Co. has discontinued manufacturing 60 products and versions of 
products, according to a notification letter sent to drug wholesalers around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several pharmaceutical wholesaling companies said that the 
products involved were either old or slow-selling and that the loss of the 
items will have little or no financial impact on them. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't cause any problems. Our buyers reacted to it as a routine 
maintenance" of Lilly's product line, said a spokesman for Bergen Brunswig 
Corp., a California-based drug wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
Lilly said it knows of no other manufacturers for 10 of the discontinued 
products, including two package sizes of 32 mg. Darvon capsules. However, other 
dosage sizes of Darvon are available. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some packaging formats of Axid, Lilly's anti-ulcer drug, and of 
Keflex, an antibiotic, were discontinued, but Lilly continues to manufacture 
those products in other formats. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the products discontinued were among those cited in the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration's highly critical inspection report on Lilly's 
manufacturing practices issued last year.
