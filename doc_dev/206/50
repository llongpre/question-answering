<HEAD>Four Big Drug Companies Report Higher Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Four major U.S.-based pharmaceutical companies reported sharply
higher third-quarter results Tuesday, led in part by strong sales
growth at home and abroad for disease-fighting drugs.
   The results reported by Warner Lambert Co., Merck &amp; Co., Eli
Lilly and Co. and Pfizer Inc. also reflected the declining strength
of the dollar, which inflates the value of sales in other countries
when calculated in dollars.

<HEAD>Warner-Lambert</HEAD>

   Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, N.J., said earnings for
the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $124.76 million or 93 cents
a share, up 16.7 percent from $106.92 million or 79 cents a share a
year in the 1989 third quarter. The year-earlier per-share figures
were restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split this past May.
   Third-quarter sales rose to $1.19 billion, a quarterly record,
up 7 percent from $1.11 billion a year earlier.
   Joseph D. Williams, chairman and chief executive officer,
attributed the results to the strength of the company's worldwide
pharmaceutical business, led by prescription drug sales, notably in
the cholesterol-regulating drug Lopid.
   Non-prescription drug sales also rose, paced by strong
performance of Listerine mouthwash and Halls cough tablets. The
gums and mints segment, which includes brands such as Certs,
Chiclets and Sugar Daddy, fell slightly.
   For the nine months, Warner-Lambert said earnings totaled
$379.54 million or $2.83 a share, up 18.5 percent from $320.36
million or $2.37 a share a year earlier. Sales totaled $3.44
billion vs. $3.15 billion, up 9.2 percent.

<HEAD>Merck</HEAD>

   Merck, a Rahway, N.J.-based maker of health products and
specialty chemicals, said third-quarter earnings rose 19 percent to
$465 million or $1.19 a share, from $390.5 million or 99 cents a
share a year earlier.
   Sales for the quarter rose 17 percent to $1.91 billion from
$1.63 billion a year earlier.
   The company reported gains in all operations and said there was
particularly strong demand for its pediatric vaccine M-M-R II,
which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. The Centers for
Disease Control strengthened its recommended dosage of the vaccine
in response to higher incidence of measles infections in the United
States.
   For the nine months, Merck said earnings totaled $1.34 billion
or $3.42 a share, up 18.5 percent from $1.13 billion or $2.85 a
share a year earlier. Sales totaled $5.57 billion vs. $4.79
billion, up 16.3 percent.

<HEAD>Eli Lilly</HEAD>

   Eli Lilly, headquartered in Indianapolis, said third-quarter
earnings rose 21 percent to a record $257 million or 90 cents a
share, vs. $212.4 million or 73 cents a share a year earlier.
   Chairman Richard D. Wood attributed the strength to higher sales
at home and abroad, led by demand for the antidepressant drug
Prozac and other pharmaceuticals.
   For the nine months, Lilly earned $872 million or $2.99 a share,
up 22 percent from $714.2 milloin or $2.45 a share a year earlier.
Nine-month sales totaled $3.75 billion vs. $3.03 billion, up 23.7
percent.

<HEAD>Pfizer</HEAD>

   Pfizer, a New York-based maker of health care and consumer
products and specialty drugs, said third-quarter earnings totaled
$243.3 million or $1.45 a share, up 12 percent from $217.5 million
or $1.29 a share a year earlier. Quarterly sales totaled $1.64
billion vs. $1.44 billion, up 14 percent.
   The company said strong growth in pharmaceutical sales was paced
by the cardiovascular agent Procardia XL and antifungal drug
Diflucan.
   For the nine months, Pfizer said earnings totaled $646.4 million
or $3.85 a share, up 8.8 percent from $594 million or $3.52 a share
a year earlier. Sales for the period totaled $4.62 billion, up 10.5
percent from $4.18 billion.
