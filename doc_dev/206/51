   A congressional subcommittee investigating
the generic drug industry has asked Eli Lilly &amp; Co. to hand over
several documents within two weeks.
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., sent a letter Tuesday to Lilly
Chairman Richard D. Wood in which he said an inspection report by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration made public last week
``confirmed that callous and cavalier business practices were
commonplace in your Indianapolis plant.''
   Dingell chairs the subcommittee on oversight and investigations
of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which has been
investigating production problems and illegal payments in the
generic drug industry and the FDA's approval process for generic
drugs.
   Generic drugs are copies of brand name products that have lost
their patent protection.
   The subcommittee's request seeks from Lilly copies of documents
dating back to Jan. 1, 1985, and covering Lilly responses to any
inspections of its manufacturing operations; communication to or
from the FDA regarding inspections of manufacturing or research
facilities for drugs produced or sold in this country; and a list of
management personnel at the Indianapolis plant.
   A spokesman for Lilly said the company had not received the
letter.
   The 90-page FDA inspection report addressing Lilly's tablet and
capsule manufacturing facility criticized the company's quality
control, manufacturing and record-keeping procedures.
   In response, Lilly recalled 18 lots of 10 products, temporarily
halted all shipments from the Indianapolis plant, and formed an
in-house task force to revamp procedures to meet FDA objections.
   Last week Dingell's subcommittee asked the FDA for the reports of
all Lilly manufacturing plant inspections worldwide since Jan. 1,
1985.
