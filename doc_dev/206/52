   WASHINGTON -- Was Eli Lilly &amp; Co. pulling the Food and
Drug Administration's chain, or was the huge drug maker
really testing the Bush administration's commitment to
speeding up the marketing of new drugs?
   It depends on whom you talk to.

   On Nov. 13, the President's Council on Competitiveness and
the FDA announced a sweeping plan to streamline the
drug-approval process. The avowed goals are to cut the
average time for testing and approving drugs to seven years
from the current 10 years, and to 5 1/2 years for drugs
desperately needed to treat AIDS and other deadly diseases.
   A fact sheet released by the competitiveness council said,
among other things, that the FDA "will immediately permit"
drug companies to bypass the agency altogether when it comes
to initial testing of new drugs on humans. Instead, they need
only obtain the approval of an "institutional review board"
at a hospital or medical school.
   Indianapolis-based Lilly, it appears, took the council,
chaired by a Hoosier, Vice President Dan Quayle, at its word.
But it also appears that the FDA regards the use of the word
"immediately" as a slipup.
   On Nov. 14 or Nov. 15, a company lobbyist telephoned the
FDA to see if the fact sheet was indeed correct, according to
an FDA memo obtained by Rep. Ted Weiss. She was told that
Lilly couldn't begin testing any drug on a review board's
say-so. What's more, according to the memo, she was told that
such boards say "they don't have the capability to adequately
review investigational new drugs for safety and don't want
responsibility for approving such testing."
   This didn't deter Lilly. In a Nov. 21 letter, the company
notified the FDA that it has asked an Indiana University
review board for clearance to begin testing a new drug for
Alzheimer's disease.
   The FDA, facing a bold challenge to its authority, went
ballistic. Paul Leber, a senior drug-review official, took
Lilly's letter as apparently "a notice of an intent to
violate existing law," according to another FDA memo. Dr.
Leber telephoned a Lilly executive on Dec. 3 and laid down
the law: There won't be any drug-testing changes until the
FDA changes the drug-testing regulations.
   This didn't satisfy Rep. Weiss, who had gotten wind of
Lilly's testing plan. In a letter yesterday to the FDA, the
New York Democrat demanded an even tougher response, warning
that Lilly's "actions may ultimately jeopardize the health of
unwitting volunteers in clinical trials."
   Yesterday, the company said it has called off its
Alzheimer's drug-testing plan. Which brings us back to the
original question about Lilly's intentions. On the one hand,
the FDA's Dr. Leber says he has the impression that the
company was "merely tweaking the system." On the other hand,
when asked if Lilly was seriously testing the
administration's resolve to speed up drug approvals, Lilly
spokesman Edward West replied: "That's a fair
characterization."
