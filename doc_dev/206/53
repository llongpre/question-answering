   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   PENSIONS
   
   The court spared the federal program protecting the pensions of
30 million American workers from a potential financial crisis.
   By an 8-1 vote, the court broadened the authority of the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation to order employers to restore
terminated pension plans.
   The case is PBGC vs. LTV, 89-390.
   
   PATENTS
   
   The court ruled that a federal law reducing patent infringement
protection for drug companies applies to medical devices.
   The court, by a 6-2 vote, refused to reinstate a $26.7 million
award against Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis. Eli Lilly and Co. of
Indianapolis said Medtronic infringed patents on a device implanted
in patients to correct potentially fatal heart rhythms.
   The case is Eli Lilly vs. Medtronic Inc., 89-243.
   
   S&amp;L
   
   The court agreed to consider killing a lawsuit by a Texas
businessman who says federal regulators caused the financial ruin
of his failed savings and loan association.
   The court said it will review a ruling that revived part of
Thomas M. Gaubert's negligence suit against the government. The
suit alleges the federal regulators who assumed day-to-day
operation of the Irving-based Independent American Savings
Association ran it right out of business.
   The case is U.S. vs. Gaubert, 89-1793.
   
   HANK WILLIAMS
   
   The court refused to kill a lawsuit in which a woman who claims
to be Hank Williams Sr.'s daughter seeks some of the late country
music legend's copyright royalties.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that Cathy Yvonne Stone, 37, is entitled to have her legal
fight put before a jury.
   The cases are Williams vs. Stone, 89-1538 and 89-1563.
   
   TENURE
   
   The court left intact a decision forcing Boston University to
grant a lifetime professor's job to a woman found to have been a
victim of sex bias.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that requiring
the university to grant her tenure interferes with its academic
freedom.
   A key issue in the case of English literature professor Julia
Prewitt Brown was the admissibility of trial evidence allegedly
showing university President John Silber harbored sexist attitudes.
   The case is Boston University vs. Brown, 89-1680.
   
   SECURITIES
   
   The court let the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulate
a new form of financial trading called index participations.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that gives the
CFTC, rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission, such
regulatory power.
   Index participations are contracts of indefinite duration based
on the value of a group of securities.
   The cases are Investment Company Institute vs. SEC, 89-1484;
American Stock Exchange vs. Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 89-1502;
Philadelphia Stock Exchange vs. Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
89-1503.
   
   ANTITRUST
   
   The court said it will use the case of an eye surgeon denied
staff privileges at a Los Angeles hospital to study the scope of a
key federal antitrust law.
   The justices agreed to hear an appeal by the hospital seeking to
dismiss the doctor's antitrust suit. A ruling is not expected until
next year.
   The case is Summith Health Ltd. vs. Pinhas, 89-1679.
