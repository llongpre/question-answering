Of Protropin Status

   Genentech Inc. said it filed suit against the Food and Drug Administration in what it called a precedent-setting test of the FDA's "orphan" drug act as it applies to genetically engineered drugs. 

   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, aims to force the FDA to extend orphan-drug status to a second version of Genentech's human growth hormone. 
The orphan-drug act was enacted in 1983 to spur research into drugs to treat diseases with fewer than 200,000 victims. 

   Such status, which the FDA awarded to Genentech's Protropin growth hormone drug in December 1985, entitles the company to an exclusive seven-year marketing period before competitive human growth hormone drugs can be approved. 

   The South San Francisco, Calif.-based biotechnology concern said it believes its second version of Protropin -- made by slightly changing the amino-acid sequence of the original drug -- is simply an "improved" product that warrants the orphan-drug status already granted the original. 

   Genentech said that the FDA's inclination so far has been to apply the rules of conventional drugs and treat the new Genentech growth hormone as an entirely new drug requiring a separate application for orphan-drug status. 
Genentech also charged that the agency may be violating the orphan-drug act by agreeing to consider an application for orphan status from a rival drug concern, Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis. 

   Eli Lilly has developed a human growth hormone similiar to Genentech's new version of Protropin but made by a different process, according to Genentech. 
The company said the orphan-drug act needs to be clarified to consider "special characteristics" of genetically engineered pharmaceuticals. 

   Genentech's suit, while raising an important question for gene-splicing drug makers, is aimed at protecting what the company sees as a lucrative market. 
Sales of Protropin, first developed in 1979 to treat certain forms of hormone deficiency-related dwarfism in children, reached $43.6 million in its first full year of marketing, which ended Dec. 31, the company said. 

   Genentech estimates those sales could grow dramatically as the drug is approved for treating further conditions of growth-hormone deficiency. 
The deficiency, leading to stunted growth, occurs when the pituitary gland fails to secrete adequate amounts of growth-stimulating protein. 

   By one estimate, as many as 15,000 children in the U.S. suffer from treatable growth-hormone deficiency. 
Under FDA regulations, Protropin can be obtained only by prescription through pharmacies at hospitals where children with growth-hormone deficiency are treated. 

   In Washington, FDA spokesmen couldn't be reached for comment yesterday. 
An Eli Lilly official declined to comment.
