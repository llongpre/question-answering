   A salesman says he developed suicidal impulses
while taking the anti-depression drug Prozac, and he once
intentionally smashed his car into a truck.
   In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, Ralph
Langer of suburban Chicago is seeking more than $1 million in
damages from the drug manufacturer, Eli Lilly &amp; Co. of
Indianapolis, and its subsidiary, Dista Products Co.
   Langer contends in the lawsuit that Eli Lilly has failed to warn
doctors about what the suit said is a link between Prozac and
suicidal or aggressive behavior.
   An Eli Lilly spokeswoman refused to comment on the lawsuit, but
defended the drug as safe.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has no evidence of the
drug being linked to specific deaths and still considers the drug
safe, spokeswoman Eva Kemper said in a telephone interview from
Maryland.
   Langer contends he began experiencing suicidal and
self-destructive impulses after his therapist prescribed Prozac in
September 1987 to treat his depression.
   Other lawsuits also have been filed involving the drug.
   A New York woman sued Lilly last month. In addition, the widows
of three victims of a Kentucky man who murdered eight people before
shooting himself are each suing the pharmaceuticals company for $50
million, saying the aggression was linked to Prozac.
   Langer's lawsuit says that at one point while on the drug, he
intentionally drove his car at high speed into the rear of a truck.
He suffered broken bones and bruises in the crash.
   His attorney, Aron D. Robinson of Chicago, said his client had
never had suicidal impulses before being prescribed Prozac.
   He said this was the pattern in other Prozac cases studied by
his law firm.
   The aggressive or suicidal behavior ``began when the person
first began taking the drug and ended when the person was taken off
the drug,'' he said.
   Lilly spokeswoman Mari Abbott said the drug was tested on more
than 11,000 people before it was marketed. It has been prescribed
for more than 2 million patients without evidence that it was
linked to suicidal impulses, Ms. Abbott said.
   ``All of the data we have does not show a cause-and-effect
relationship between our product and suicidal thoughts and acts,''
she said. ``The safety and effectiveness of this product has been
tested.''
