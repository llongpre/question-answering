Eli Lilly, the US drugs company, is to pay Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) for
PCS, a drugs distributor, in the third big acquisition of its kind in the US
in less than a year.
PCS, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based McKesson, claims to sell drugs to
50m Americans under various healthcare programmes, with drugs sales last
year of Dollars 6.4bn, making it one of the biggest companies of its type.
The planned deal is the latest sign of the rush by drugs companies to secure
distribution for their products in the US, the world's biggest
pharmaceuticals market. Faced with pressure to hold down prices,
manufacturers have sought to build market share by buying distribution
companies or by gaining preferential treatment for their drugs.
If completed, the deal will leave three of the biggest US distributors under
the control of pharmaceuticals manufacturers. Last year, Merck paid Dollars
6.7bn for Medco Containment Services, while SmithKline Beecham recently
agreed to acquire Diversified Pharmaceutical Services for Dollars 2.3bn.
McKesson had discussed a sale of the distribution arm with other
manufacturers, but did not hold a formal auction of the company, PCS said.
Following other links between distributors and manufacturers, it was the
only big pharmacy benefits management company left on the market. These
companies provide prescription drugs to people covered by the healthcare
programmes of big US employers.
In London, shares in Glaxo, which had been rumoured to be interested in PCS,
fell 8p to 563p.
The main reason, said analysts, was that a substantial proportion of US
patients would now be more difficult for Glaxo to reach, particularly with
its top-selling anti-ulcer drug Zantac.
Merck, SmithKline Beecham and now Eli Lilly would each push their respective
anti-ulcer products through their newly acquired distribution companies,
explained Mr Duncan Moore, pharmaceuticals analyst at Morgan Stanley.
These subsidiaries claim to have nearly 50m people covered by their
formularies. 'This is a material tightening of the screws for Glaxo,' he
said.
PCS claimed that it would continue to make available the most beneficial and
cost-effective drugs to its customers after the deal, regardless of who
manufactured them. 'The deal was not done for us to market Lilly's drugs
over other companies.'
The structure of the deal leaves McKesson open to higher offers for PCS.
Lilly has launched a tender offer for McKesson's shares. It said it would
spin off all McKesson's businesses apart from PCS into a new company, shares
in which would be distributed to existing McKesson shareholders. 'It does
open the door to other offers,' PCS said yesterday.
News of the deal drove McKesson shares up by a third yesterday, to Dollars
97 5/8 . By contrast, Eli Lilly's shares slid 12 per cent to Dollars 50 on
fears that it was paying too much for the acquisition. The all-cash purchase
would be financed with short and medium-term debt, Eli Lilly said. Moody's,
the US credit rating agency, said it would review the company's debt for a
possible downgrade.
