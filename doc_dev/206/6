   Medtronic Inc. said a jury in Philadelphia awarded Eli Lilly &amp; Co. $26.5 million in a patent infringement suit Lilly had filed against the maker of implantable biomedical devices. 

   Medtronic said the suit, filed in 1983, involved two patents for a device that treats tachyarrhythmia, or too fast heartbeat. 

   Medtronic said it strongly disputes the verdict and intends to assert that position in post-trial legal proceedings and in appeals, if necessary. 
It said a federal district court judge will review the verdict, and that a decision is expected in four to six weeks. 

   A Medtronic spokeswoman said it's "premature" to assess any financial impact on the company. 
In the year ended last April 30, the rapidly growing company earned $73.8 million, or $5.25 a share, on sales of $502 million. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Medtronic stock fell $1.75 to $92.50, while Lilly shares rose $1.625 to $85.50. 
The announcement came shortly before the close of trading. 

   A spokeswoman for Eli Lilly, an Indianapolis-based drug, medical instruments and agricultural products concern, said the company had no comment because "the case isn't concluded." 

   The Medtronic spokeswoman said the company has had the device in clinical trials for almost a year. 
She said the company will continue to pursue development, with the expectation of reaching the market in the early 1990s. 
The first of Lilly's patents for the device expire in 1990.
