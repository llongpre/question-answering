<HEAD>Lilly Tells State Department It Won't Supply Potent Herbicide To
Government</HEAD>

   Eli Lilly and Co. has decided not to sell
the government a potent herbicide to destroy coca plants in Peru, a
decision that drew sharp criticism from the State Department.
   In announcing its decision Monday, Lilly said only that ``while
the company recognizes the critical importance of the U.S.
government's efforts against illicit drugs, a number of practical
and policy considerations preclude our participation in this
specific program.''
   The Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical company would not explain
those considerations.
   The sale of the herbicide reportedly would have earned Lilly $25
million.
   State Department officials have been planning to spray the
herbicide tebuthiuron on tracts of coca plants in the Huallaga
Valley in Peru, which officials say is the source of much of the
cocaine produced in Latin America.
   But tebuthiuron is thought to have strong, long-lasting effects
as a defoliant that causes ecological damage.
   Ann B. Wrobleski, the State Department's assistant secretary for
international narcotics matters, called Lilly's decision
``surprising'' and ``unconscionable.''
   Ms. Wrobleski said Monday the company's decision was perplexing
because the government is looking at five or six herbicides and has
yet to complete tests.
   ``I have no indication that there is any environmental problem
with this chemical,'' she said.
   ``Is Eli Lilly saying, `We choose not to be part of the solution
to the cocaine problem'?'' Ms. Wrobleski asked.
   The company produces Spike, the brand name for tebuthiuron, for
retail sale.
