   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said the Food and Drug Administration gave the company preliminary approval to market Axid, an anti-ulcer drug. 

   The pharmaceuticals company said it received a letter from the agency informing the company that Axid, whose generic name is nizatidine, is "approvable." 
But further discussions between the agency and company are necessary before the compound can be marketed, Lilly said. 

   Axid, currently marketed in the United Kingdom, enters a U.S. market already crowded with similar compounds, making it unlikely that the drug will gain major market share. 

   But Kenneth Kulju, an analyst with Fahnestock and Co., New York, a regional brokerage, said Axid "symbolically signals that Lilly is actively moving to expand its range of therapies." 
Lilly is adding drugs used for chronic care, such as pharmaceuticals for nervous-system disorders, to its stable of drugs used in acute-care situations, such as hospital antibiotics. 

   Axid is used to treat duodenal ulcers, which occur in the small intestine. 
Tagamet, made by Philadelphia-based SmithKline Beckman Corp., and Zantac, a product of London-based Glaxo Holdings PLC, have U.S. sales of about $500 million each in a market estimated at $1.2 billion annually, said Michael Martorelli, an analyst with regional broker Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. 
Merck &amp; Co., Rahway, N.J., has a smaller share of the market with its Pepcid product. 

   Lilly's Axid is a "me-too drug," Mr. Martorelli said, meaning that it closely resembles drugs already on the market. 
"It's not going to be revolutionary to medicine like when Tagamet or Zantac were introduced," he said. 
But Mr. Martorelli added that Axid may benefit, like the other compounds, from an expanding market for anti-ulcer drugs. 
More people are taking medication for ulcers instead of changing their diets.
