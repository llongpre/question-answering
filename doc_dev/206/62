   Organogenesis Inc., a medical products concern developing human organ replacements, said it signed an agreement with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly &amp; Co., under which the companies will develop a replacement human artery. 

   Under the agreement, Organogenesis will develop a replacement artery derived from cells and molecules normally present in human blood vessels, with scientific and financial support from Lilly, a medical and agricultural products concern. 

   If the product receives Food and Drug Administration approval for marketing, Organogenesis will manufacture it and Lilly will hold exclusive world-wide marketing rights to it, Organogenesis said.
