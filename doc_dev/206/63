   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said it halted the distribution of all drugs made at one of its Indianapolis plants and recalled 10 drugs after federal inspectors found widespread quality-control problems at the facility. 

   A spokesman for the Indianapolis-based drug maker said the company has started a broad review of its production procedures that could result in additional recalls if more problems are uncovered. 
In a statement, Lilly said it is "confident that there are no safety or efficacy issues involved with the lots to be recalled." 

   The recalled drugs include several forms of darvon, methadone, two anti-infectives and an anti-inflammatory agent. 
Lilly's spokesman said the drugs were mostly "older line products" sold either under the Lilly or Dista labels. 
He said they constitute a relatively small part of Lilly's tablet and capsule production and would have no impact on the company's financial results. 

   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Lilly's shares fell 75 cents to close at $59.625. 

   The investigation by the Food and Drug Administration did not include Lilly's largest drug lines such as its oral antibiotic, Ceclor, or Prozac, its anti-depressant drug. 

   Burton Love, the FDA's Midwest regional director, said Lilly voluntarily halted distribution from its Indianapolis plant and initiated the recall. 
"We don't disagree with those actions," Mr. Love said. 

   The inspectors' 90-page report sharply criticizes Lilly's quality-control procedures. 
During a four-month investigation, the federal inspectors said they found "objectionable conditions in nearly every area inspected." 
The problems centered on poor record keeping, including missing recall records and follow-up data on drugs that failed to retain their stability or potency. 
The inspectors also criticized Lilly's failure to adequately train its quality-control officers. 
In one case the inspectors said dozens of Lilly's products went through major reformulations without any follow-up stability tests. 

   The inspectors' report said Lilly had numerous production problems with its darvon compounds, some of which resulted in recalls. 
The company's ulcer drug Axid also had to be recalled after it failed to dissolve properly. 
The inspectors reported that some of Lilly's codeine sulfate tablets failed stability and dissolving tests. 
In some cases, the inspectors said Lilly failed to maintain records documenting problems leading up to recalls or detailing follow-up investigations. 

   Lilly's spokesman said that as a result of the FDA's findings the company has recalled 18 product batches covering 10 items. 
"It's possible other lots can be affected" if additional problems are found, he said. 
To date, Lilly has recalled five of its drug products this year and had two recalls last year. 
"We had one or two product recalls in each of the previous years," the spokesman said. 

   Lilly said it expects to resume distribution from its Indianapolis plant within several weeks on a product-by-product basis. 
The company said it halted distribution from the plant Aug. 25 after it received a copy of the FDA inspection report. 

   Despite the widespread problems uncovered at the Indianapolis plant, Mr. Love said the FDA had no immediate plans to extend its investigation to Lilly's other plants. 
Instead, he said the agency was leaving it up to Lilly to conduct its own internal investigation of quality-control procedures at the plants. 
FDA inspectors will follow up on Lilly's findings, Mr. Love said.
