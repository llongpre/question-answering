   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. offered to pay more than #7 million ($12.6 million) in damages and legal fees to settle a string of lawsuits in Britain over Oraflex, the U.S.-based drug maker's arthritis medicine. 

   The Indianapolis-based company made its settlement offer to about 1,200 Britons who claimed that they became ill or that their relatives died from taking the drug, known as Opren in Britain, during the early 1980s. 
Lilly withdrew the drug from world-wide sale in 1982, after reports of four deaths and six illnesses among Britons using the medicine. 
Oraflex-related damage suits since have become a major legal headache for Lilly in Britain and the U.S. 

   Desmond Wilson, who heads a U.K. public-interest lobbying group, denounced the offer as "miserly." 
He and other Lilly critics urged revisions in British court procedures that he said make it hard for large groups to win such personal-injury suits. 

   Attorneys for Lilly and the plaintiffs declined to comment on the size of the settlement offer, at the request of a High Court judge hearing the case. 
But one individual involved in the dispute said Lilly's offer to settle the health-damage claims totaled nearly #3 million -- an average of less than #2,500 a claimant. 
Lilly also would pay the plaintiffs' legal fees, which the individual estimated at more than #4 million. 

   Rodger Pannone, the plaintiffs' chief attorney, said lawyers will figure each plaintiff's fair share and recommend they accept the sum as "reasonable," given Britain's tradition of relatively small personal-injury settlements. 
A Lilly spokesman in London said the settlement, under which the company wouldn't admit any liability, was "preferable to prolonged and costly litigation." 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Lilly shares closed at $69.75, up $2.375, amid broad advances on the Big Board. 

   Lilly previously had tried -- and apparently failed -- to make individual settlements with about 20 plaintiffs. 
The company didn't disclose the size of those offers. 

   The 1,200 plaintiffs have several weeks to decide whether to accept Lilly's latest offer. 
The settlement wouldn't cover between 250 and 450 other plaintiffs who missed a court deadline for joining the case. 

   Jack Ashley, a Labor Party member of Parliament and longtime drug-industry critic, said that "there will be public outrage" if the damage settlement is so small that the plaintiffs get less than their lawyers receive in fees.
