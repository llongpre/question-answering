The US Federal Trade Commission said Eli Lilly had agreed to settle charges
that its Dollars 4bn acquisition of McKesson and its prescription management
business, PCS Health Systems, would substantially lessen competition in the
pharmaceuticals industry, potentially causing higher prices and reduced
quality, AP-DJ reports from Washington.
The settlement would require Lilly to ensure that its drugs were not given
unwarranted preference over competitors in connection with the
pharmacy-benefit management services Lilly will provide as a result of the
acquisition.
Lilly also agreed to build a 'fire wall' between its pharmaceutical sales
business and PCS's pharmacy benefits management business to ensure that any
Lilly division does not gain access to sensitive information about
competitors' drugs from another division, the FTC said.
The FTC said the proposed consent agreement would require Lilly to ensure
that PCS maintains an 'open formulary' - one that includes any drug approved
by a 'pharmacy and therapeutics committee'. The settlement would require
Lilly to appoint an independent committee of healthcare professionals, most
of whom not affiliated with PCS or Lilly, to evaluate drugs for inclusion in
the PCS open formulary.
The proposed settlement prohibits PCS and Lilly from sharing proprietary or
other non-public information - such as price data - from competitors whose
drugs are eligible for the PCS formulary. It also requires Lilly over the
next five years to obtain FTC approval before acquiring an interest in any
firm providing formulary services to more than 2m people in the US.
The requirement also applies to any distribution pact between Lilly and
McKesson, and/or any other wholesaler distributing Lilly products.
