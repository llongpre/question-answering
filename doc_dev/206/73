   The Lilly Endowment, one of the nation's largest foundations, announced a $50 million scholarship program for students who live in and attend colleges in the foundation's home state of Indiana. 

   The Indianapolis foundation said it hopes to encourage students to continue their education by easing the financial burden that has forced many to choose between abandoning college or taking on large loans to meet college costs. 

   Under the seven-year program, students, some of them from middle-income families that currently don't qualify for state or federal aid, will receive awards averaging about $570. 
The foundation said it expects to spend approximately $6.5 million to help about 11,000 students in the first year. 

   The $50 million grant is the largest ever made by the foundation, which was established in 1937 by Eli Lilly, founder of the pharmaceutical concern. 
Eli Lilly &amp; Co. stock is still the major asset in the foundation's $1.9 billion portfolio. 
Last year, the foundation awarded $56.5 million in grants, primarily for religion, education and community development projects in Indiana.
