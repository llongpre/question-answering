   A Long Island woman is suing the makers
of the anti-depressant drug Prozac for $150 million, claiming the
drug caused her to mutilate her own body and to attempt suicide.
   Rhonda Hala of Shirley charged in her suit that the
manufacturer, Eli Lilly &amp; Co. of Indianapolis, failed to warn users
that Prozac could cause an obsession with death and violence.
   There are about 1.5 million people in the United States on
Prozac, with 650,000 prescriptions written each month. An Eli Lilly
spokeswoman, Marie Abbot, said the company is not removing Prozac
from the market and said it has not been shown that the drug causes
suicidal thoughts.
   Mrs. Hala began taking Prozac in 1988 after a spinal disc
procedure and withdrawal from painkillers left her depressed.
Within two weeks, she said, her thoughts turned to suicide.
   During her 18 months on Prozac, she slashed her arms, legs and
stomach with razor blades and dug scissors and screws into her
flesh about 150 times, she said.
   ``I thought I had someone else's brain in my body,'' said Mrs.
Hala, 40, a school secretary.
   She tried six times to kill herself, requiring hospitalization
four times. Her husband and two teen-age children were afraid to
leave her alone.
   ``It was as if I was possessed,'' said Mrs. Hala. ``I was always
a happy, up person, but I became obsessed with self-mutilation.''
   As her mental state deteriorated, her psychiatrist doubled her
dose of Prozac. It was not until he read an article in the American
Journal of Psychiatry that he immediately took Mrs. Hala off the
drug and her life returned to normal.
   In the February article, Dr. Martin Teicher of Harvard
University and his colleagues reported that six patients had
developed violent suicidal thoughts within weeks of taking Prozac.
   Officials at Eli Lilly and the federal Food and Drug
Administration, which approved Prozac in 1988, acknowledge
nationwide reports of serious adverse effects from the drug,
including ``suicidal ideation.''
   But they said it may be impossible to determine if the drug
directly caused the suicidal thoughts, or if they were the result
of the patient's mental depressed state.
   ``The idea that Prozac is a killer drug is a little bit silly,''
said psychiatrist Dr. Jerrold Rosenbaum, chief of the
Psycho-Pharmacology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston and associate professor at Harvard University.
   ``The bottom line is that Prozac is no wonder drug. It has no
extravagant claims attached to it, but it has helped a lot of
people suffering from depression appreciate the benefits of life,''
Rosenbaum said.
   Prozac's known side effects include nausea, a rash, agitation
and jittery nerves.
   In the last year, various Prozac support groups have been formed
by former users of the drug to publicize their claims of side
effects.
   ``This is a terrible drug,'' said Sharyn DiGeronimo, a Selden
resident who founded Prozac Survivors Support Group in New York.
   DiGeronimo said she receives calls from Prozac patients who
report of loosing control or judgement while on the drug. Some were
prescribed Prozac to help them stop smoking or loose weight.
   Abbot, the Eli Lilly spokeswoman, declined comment on the
litigation, but acknowledged the company revised its package
literature on Prozac last May.
   The update listed adverse effects reported to the company since
Prozac went on the market, including ``suicidal ideation or
thoughts associated with the drug.''
   ``Suicidal thoughts are unfortunately common among depressive
patients,'' Abbot said. ``It is important to note that there has
been no cause-effect relationship established between Prozac and
the reports of suicidal ideation.''
   Dr. Paul Leber, director of the FDA's neuropharmocological
products department, said the agency has been monitoring the
reports of suicidal or homicidal thoughts.
   ``We have taken a good, hard look and haven't found anything
that leads us to believe that Prozac causes suicidal thoughts,''
said Leber.
