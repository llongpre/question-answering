   Monoclonal Antibodies Inc. said a U.S. judge will issue a preliminary injunction preventing it from selling products comprising 80% of the company's product sales. 

   The company said Judge Marilyn Patel decided to grant a motion by Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s Hybritech Inc. unit for an injunction against the sale of all Monoclonal products named in Hybritech's 1984 patent-infringement lawsuit. 
That would cost the Mountain View, Calif.-based company about $1.1 million of sales a quarter. 

   A clerk for Judge Patel confirmed that the judge said she would issue the injunction, but declined to predict when the order would be formalized. 

   Thomas A. Glaze, Monoclonal president, said the ruling "is going to require us to restructure our operations to conserve cash and continue the business." 
He declined to speculate about the likelihood of layoffs or other belt-tightening measures. 

   Monoclonal said it would ask Judge Patel to reconsider her decision to issue the injunction. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Monoclonal shares closed at $4.75, down $2.25, on volume of 368,000 shares. 
The stock was trading in the mid-20s last May. 

   A spokesman for Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly said, "While the court has indicated that an injunction will be entered that will prohibit making, using or selling certain products of Monoclonal Antibodies Inc., the injunction has not been made final. 
Therefore Lilly will not be able to comment more at this time." 

   In 1984, a then-independent Hybritech sued Monoclonal, charging infringement of a technology called a "sandwich assay," a method for using monoclonal antibodies to detect and monitor physical conditions such as pregnancy and cancer. 

   The court ruled in Monoclonal's favor, but a federal appeals court last September reversed the decision, upholding the validity of the Hybritech patent. 
The case was then sent back to the trial court, which yesterday indicated its intention to block the sale of those products that infringe on the Hybritech patent. 

   Last February, Monoclonal petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the company's case -- one of several key patent cases underscoring the importance of patents to the biotechnology field. 

   The products that would be hardest hit by the expected injunction are the company's Ovu-Stick test for determining ovulation, and Advance, a pregnancy test made by the company and marketed by Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. 
The decision follows an earlier move by Ortho, Monoclonal's largest customer, to stop marketing an ovulation predictor test because of problems with its shelf life. 

   In the third quarter ended Dec. 31, Monoclonal posted a loss of $832,000 on revenue of $1.9 million -- about $1.4 million of which came from product sales. 
That compares with a year-earlier profit of $224,000, or eight cents a share, on revenue of $2.5 million. 

   Monoclonal said it hopes to offset the expected negative impact on sales by introducing in late 1987 or early 1988 new tests to detect sexually transmitted diseases and drug abuse. 
Mr. Glaze said the company also plans to modify current products "to make sure they're clearly free" of the alleged patent-infringement problems. 

   The expected injunction is "a real blow . . . very bad news for Monoclonal Antibodies," said James McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter. 
He declined to estimate the dollar impact "because the biggest issue (in future court proceedings) could be damages, and we've no clue about that." 
He said Monoclonal possibly could stay afloat because of what he described as "fair" cash reserves, but that the company might become a takeover target. 

   The case is one of several key patent actions underscoring the importance of patents to the biotechnology field. 
Mr. McCamant noted that Lilly and Hybritech had filed a similar patent-infringement suit against Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill., and that Wellcome PLC challenged Genentech Inc.'s British patent covering TPA, a clot-dissolving product for heart-attack treatment. 

   "There will be more" such actions, he predicted. 
Defensible patents, he said, "reward the guy who gets there first." 

   Mr. Glaze declined to comment on Mr. McCamant's suggestion that Monoclonal could become a takeover target. 
Diagnostic Products Corp., a Los Angeles-based maker of medical test kits, disclosed earlier this year that it had acquired a 6.6% stake in Monoclonal.
