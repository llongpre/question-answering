   Three Eli Lilly &amp; Co. plants in Puerto Rico
failed to follow federal regulations on manufacturing practices
last year, according to inspection reports released by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
   No products were recalled, and the Indianapolis-based
pharmaceutical company agreed in January to a schedule for making
corrections.
   ``We believe the steps we have taken have resolved those issues,
and we continue to work with FDA inspectors to ensure our practices
comply with all existing regulations,'' said Lilly spokesman Edward
A. West.
   The FDA reports were obtained Monday by The Indianapolis Star
under the Freedom of Information Act.
   In one document, Edward R. Esparza, director of the FDA's
district office in Puerto Rico, said the company failed to maintain
manufacturing practices required by federal regulations.
   FDA inspectors criticized an uncovered section of a conveyor
line in which bottles were being filled with Ilosone liquid, an
antibiotic. Gaps in an overhead conveyor chute ``permitted pieces
of broken caps to fall onto and around the bottle conveyor,'' the
report said.
   The document referred to inspections conducted June 1989 through
October 1989 at three Lilly plants in Carolina, Puerto Rico.
   In subsequent correspondence, Esparza said Lilly had answered
most of the questions raised by the inspections and had produced a
satisfactory schedule for correcting the problems.
   The inspections of Lilly's Puerto Rican operations occurred
during and after a four-month FDA inspection of Lilly's
Indianapolis facilities, which resulted in the recall of some
batches of more than 10 products.
