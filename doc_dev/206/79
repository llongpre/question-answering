   The U.S. drug industry enjoyed a robust third quarter, with five companies posting profit increases ranging from 11% at American Home Products Corp. to 31% at Merck &amp; Co. 

   Warner-Lambert Co. recorded a 16% jump. 
Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s profit rose 14.3% and Pfizer Inc.'s rose 17%. 
The companies cited such factors as diversified product lines, favorable foreign exchange and lower taxes. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, American Home shares were unchanged at $80.25; Lilly closed down 87.5 cents to $89.75; Merck fell 25 cents to $58; Pfizer rose 25 cents to $56.25; and Warner-Lambert tumbled $4.25 to $72.50. 

   Warner-Lambert
   Net income for the big drug concern, based in Morris Plains, N.J., included a charge of about $29 million incurred to "de-consolidate" its Argentinean operations. 
But the company said it still will achieve its goal of 20% gain in per-share net for the year. 
Sales rose 16%, to $1.03 billion, from the year-earlier quarter. 

   Joseph D. Williams, chairman and chief executive officer, said the results illustrate that the company's "diverse product line and broad geographic coverage give us a distinct advantage" in its markets. 

   World-wide sales of Warner-Lambert's prescription drugs, led by the lipid-regulation product Lopid and anti-convulsant Dilantin, rose 16% to $311 million. 
Sales of non-prescription products, led by Halls lozenges and Rolaids antacid tablets, increased more than 13% to $352 million. 
Among other products in the category are Listerine mouthwash, Lubriderm skin lotion and Benadryl antihistamine. 

   Gum and mint sales, including Trident and Clorets, posted a 23% sales rise to $249 million. 
And sales of the company's other products, which include Schick razors and blades, jumped 17% to $120 million. 

   In the first nine months, sales were $2.91 billion, up 14% from $2.54 billion. 
In the latest period, average shares outstanding totaled 68.1 million, compared with the year-earlier 71.8 million. 

   Merck
   Sales rose 12% to $1.47 billion from $1.31 billion in the year-earlier quarter. 
Merck, based in Rahway, N.J., said sales of new products fueled the quarterly growth, reflecting strong unit gains in the U.S. and abroad. 
Merck said the sale of its interest in a Japanese affiliate in the second quarter reduced sales four percentage points. 

   The company said income growth and improved profit margins reflected strong unit volume gains, a better product mix, continuing cost controls, productivity increases and the favorable effect of foreign exchange. 

   In the first nine months, Merck's sales totaled $4.41 billion, up 20%. 

   American Home Products
   Sales for the New York-based company rose 9% to $1.42 billion from $1.3 billion. 

   American Home said net benefited from a lower tax rate. 
It said sales of health care products rose 9%, and food and household products rose similarly. 

   In the nine months, sales increased 10% to $4.2 billion from $3.81 billion. 

   Pfizer
   Sales rose 7% to $1.38 billion from $1.3 billion. 

   Edmund T. Pratt Jr., chairman and chief executive of New York-based Pfizer, described the results as strong and said they were fueled by a 20% boost in U.S. pharmaceutical sales from the year-earlier quarter. 
The company said sales were up 11% in its health care business segment, 9% in consumer products and 3% in material science. 
Sales declined 11% in specialty chemicals and 3% in agricultural products. 

   Health care gains reflected world-wide sales growth of 10% in pharmaceutical products and 16% in hospital products, Pfizer said. 
It added that the pharmaceuticals segment is expanding its sales force 20% in advance of the launching of new drugs pending approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration. 

   Nine-month sales rose 10% to $4.02 billion. 

   Pfizer also said it is negotiating an agreement with Cambrex Corp., Bayonne, N.J., for the sale of Pfizer's iron oxides and pigments business. 

   Eli Lilly -
   Lilly said it had record results for the quarter and nine months in each of its business segments, in both domestic and international markets. 
Quarterly sales rose 11% to $940.6 million from $845.8 million. 

   The Indianapolis-based company said the growth in pharmaceutical sales was led by such new products as Prozac, an anti-depressant, and Axid, an anti-ulcer drug. 

   The company's Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. subsidiary led the growth in the medical instrument systems division, and sales of the pesticide Treflan led growth in its plant science products business. 
Sales of animal health products declined, Lilly said. 

   Nine-month sales were $3.03 billion, up 11% from $2.74 billion.
