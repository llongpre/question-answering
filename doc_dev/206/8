   Two big pharmaceutical concerns, Upjohn Co. and Eli Lilly
&amp; Co., posted solid sales and earnings growth for the first
quarter.
   Lilly, with the same core product line that has fueled its
recent growth, said its net climbed 14% to $388.6 million, or
$1.35 a share, from $340.8 million, or $1.16 a share, in the
year-earlier period. Sales increased 16% to $1.44 billion
from $1.24 billion.

   Upjohn's net rose 17% to $133.3 million, or 73 cents a
share, from $114.3 million, or 61 cents a share. Income from
continuing operations rose 15%. Sales rose 11% to $799.4
million from $723.4 million.
   Eli Lilly, based in Indianapolis, said its Axid anti-ulcer
drug, Ceclor antibiotic, Humatrope growth hormone, and
Humulin synthetic human insulin, all were "important product
contributors." The results include what is thought to be a
slowdown in the rapid sales growth of the company's Prozac
anti-depressant, however; Lilly, as a matter of policy, won't
discuss sales of individual drugs. Sales in Europe and Japan
contributed "significantly" to the overall growth in sales.
   The company said its medical devices and diagnostics
division, led by the division's Advanced Cardiovascular
Systems Inc. segment, also helped push sales higher.
   Chairman Richard D. Wood said that while the company's
cost of sales increased at a slower rate than sales,
"operating expenses grew slightly faster" at 20%. The higher
marketing and administrative outlays reflect the costs of
promoting newer Lilly products, "as well as expenses to
support future growth," he said. Lilly's research and
development costs rose 13% to $184.5 million.
   Upjohn Co., based in Kalamazoo, Mich., said its sales
increase partly reflects price rises and foreign-currency
fluctuations.
   World-wide sales of its human healthcare products
increased 10% in the latest period. Rogaine, a
government-approved treatment for baldness, and Ansaid,
Upjohn's nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, contributed
significantly to the U.S. sales growth, the company said.
   U.S. sales were up 10% from a year ago. Sales abroad rose
12% to $317 million, representing about 40% of total sales.
