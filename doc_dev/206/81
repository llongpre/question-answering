Eli Lilly, the US drugs group, announced one-off charges of Dollars 1.2bn
before tax and said it planned to spin off its medical devices and
diagnostics businesses, which account for around 20 per cent of sales.
The moves signal an attempt by Mr Randall Tobias, the former AT&amp;T
vice-chairman brought in to head the company last June, to concentrate
Lilly's resources on its drugs business. Lilly has suffered from imminent
patent expiries on some of its biggest drugs, and a widespread belief that
it will not introduce any significant drugs in the near term.
It is more dependent on the slowing US market - from which it derives
two-thirds of sales - than most of its rivals, and it has been slow in
adapting its sales and marketing activities to the managed care
organisations which are starting to dominate the US healthcare market.
On the decision to spin off the devices and diagnostics businesses, Mr
Tobias said: 'It's a matter of strategic fit and focus - these are very,
very different businesses.'
The stock market applauded the move, pushing Lilly's share price up Dollars
1 3/4 to Dollars 61 5/8 .
The businesses to be shed accounted for estimated sales of Dollars 1.25bn
last year, out of a total of some Dollars 6.4bn. Analysts' estimates put
their value at anything between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 3bn.
Lilly said it may float the businesses, sell them, or issue shares in them
to its existing shareholders.
It plans to put six of the nine businesses into a new holding company,
shares in which would be either floated or issued to existing Lilly
shareholders. The outcome would depend on tax considerations, the state of
the stock market, and the attractiveness of any offers for individual
businesses.
The remaining three businesses will also be sold, though the timing will
depend partly on the resolution of undertakings Lilly made when it acquired
the businesses.
Lilly also reported fourth-quarter charges of Dollars 1.2bn before tax, of
which Dollars 540m was the result of a voluntary retirement programme under
which 2,600 people have already left.
It also announced a Dollars 370m charge for rationalisation of some
manufacturing operations and for changes to its 'distribution strategies',
and a Dollars 290m write-down of some manufacturing assets and acquired
intangible assets.
