   INDIANAPOLIS -- Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said Richard D. Wood will
step down as president and chief executive officer Oct. 31.
   The company's longtime chief, who will be 65 years old
next month, will be succeeded in both posts by 53-year-old
executive vice president Vaughn D. Bryson.

   Mr. Wood, who has been with the pharmaceuticals giant for
41 years, will remain chairman. He was named president in
1972 and added the chairman and chief executive titles the
following year.
   Mr. Bryson joined Lilly in 1961. He was named to the
company's board in 1984 and was named one of four executive
vice presidents in 1986. In his current position, he oversees
the company's financial and government affairs and
information systems, as well as Lilly's Elanco animal-health
division and the company's medical devices and diagnostics
division.
   Mr. Wood's departure from day-to-day leadership is in line
with Lilly's tradition of having its highest-level executives
hand over the reins at age 65. The company wouldn't formally
comment on the selection process, but Mr. Bryson had been
widely viewed as the heir apparent among the four executive
vice presidents.
