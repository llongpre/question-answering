<HEAD>Lawmakers Petition for Oraflex Victims Trust Fund</HEAD>

   A non-partisan group of 100 lawmakers Monday asked
Eli Lilly &amp; Co. to set up a trust fund for victims of side effects
of its anti-arthritis drug Oraflex.
   The lawmakers wrote to Lilly President Richard Wood asking that
the company bring compensation for British claimants into line with
that offered American claimants.
   ``The total of 2.275 million pounds ($4.1 million) for 1,354
people is extraordinarily low compared wth the roughly equivalent
sum paid in compensation to one American sufferer,'' said the
letter.
   It said the differences between British and U.S. legal systems
did not justify lower payments to British claimants while the
Indianapolis-based company offered $50 million to 103 U.S.
claimants.
   Derek Anthony, a spokesman for Lilly Industries, the British
subsidiary of Eli Lilly, said he would not comment on the amount of
compensation offered to U.S. or British claimants because of
confidentiality.
   He said, however, that about 98 percent of the British claimants
had accepted the settlement.
   Anthony said he could not comment on the lawmakers' letter
because he had not seen it.
   The drug, known as Opren in Europe, was withdrawn worldwide in
1982 because of complaints of serious side-effects, including
damage to skin, kidneys and liver.
   The Opren Action Committee in Britain said doctors had linked it
to 83 deaths and nearly 4,000 cases of adverse reactions.
