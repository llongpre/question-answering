   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said its board adopted an anti-takeover measure involving the distribution of preferred stock purchase rights to common shareholders. 

   Under certain circumstances, the rights entitle its holder to buy stock in Lilly, or the acquiring company, at a substantial discount. 

   The pharmaceutical concern said the plan wasn't adopted in response to any effort to acquire control of the company. 

   Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Lilly shares closed at $84.50 each, down 37.5 cents.
