   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. will soon face fresh challenges to its longstanding dominance of the diabetes-care market as two rivals start marketing new insulin-delivery devices. 

   Although Princeton, N.J.-based Squibb Corp. and two Danish companies are still underdogs to the formidable leader, Lilly no longer has a hammerlock on the market for insulin products that millions of diabetics must use every day. 

   As recently as 10 years ago, Lilly had the U.S. insulin market virtually to itself. 
But Squibb, its joint venture partner, Novo Industri AS of Copenhagen, and rival Nordisk Gentofte AS have gained footholds, gradually capturing a combined share that some analysts estimate at 15% to 20% of the $400 million market for injectable insulin. 
The market has grown recently at about 10% a year. 

   Now the Squibb-Novo joint venture is mounting a big advertising and direct-marketing campaign to promote a new insulin-delivery product called NovolinPen. 
The lightweight, portable device looks like a fountain pen. 
It operates with a dosage-measuring dial, replaceable insulin cartridges and disposable needles, so it can be carried in a pocket, purse or briefcase and used away from home. 

   Meanwhile, Nordisk has begun marketing a similar device, called Insuject, in Canada. 
A spokesman for the company's U.S. operations in Rockville, Md., says Nordisk is making some modifications in the product to gain approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 

   By promoting its pen aggressively, Squibb-Novo hopes to alter the makeup of the insulin-device industry, which has relied for decades on conventional syringes and vials. 
But beyond that, the company is betting that the pens will significantly increase sales of its human insulin product, Novolin, which still lags far behind Lilly's product, Humulin. 

   Lilly doesn't have a pen-type product on the market, but a spokesman says the Indianapolis-based company is continually researching "many methods of insulin delivery." 
He indicated those research efforts include possible development of a cartridge device. 

   Squibb-Novo's basic challenge is to build awareness of the new device among the vast ranks of general practitioners and family doctors who treat the nation's estimated two million insulin-dependent diabetics. 
Part of the strategy to reach that goal is to get the patients to tell their doctors about the device. 

   "Most doctors aren't diabetics," says Eric A. Orzeck, a Houston-based physician who has evaluated the NovolinPen and rival products for the American Diabetes Association. 
"They just don't understand how much of a nuisance it is when you're in a public restroom, trying to balance a syringe and a vial on your knees." 

   Earlier this month, Squibb-Novo began giving away 100,000 of the pens, which retail for about $40 each, and offering attractive rebates to patients who buy the insulin cartridges. 

   To distribute the pens, the company is tapping its own 100-member sales force and the sales organization of Squibb Corp.'s E.R. Squibb unit. 
The objective is to deliver the pens in person to 15,000 general practitioners, family doctors and diabetologists, each of whom will be urged to enroll five to 10 patients in the pen-usage program. 

   In June, Squibb-Novo exhibited the new product at the annual conference of the American Diabetes Association. 
The company's survey of physicians attending the conference found that 88% plan to switch as many as half of their patients to the pen immediately. 
Most of those surveyed cited portability, dosage accuracy and discreet design as advantages of the pen. 
Squibb-Novo will use those survey results in touting the product to other doctors. 

   As part of a media blitz, the company has scheduled a news conference for today in Philadelphia to introduce some local doctors and nurses whose patients have used the pens successfully for several months. 

   Dr. Orzeck, the Houston physician, says he thinks Squibb-Novo was smart to design the pen so that it accepts only the Squibb-Novo cartridges of insulin and no competitors' products. 
"That should bring a big boost to their insulin sales," he predicts.
