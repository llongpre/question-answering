Regulatory scrutiny of Eli Lilly's proposed Dollars 4bn takeover of PCS, a
drugs distributor, was extended yesterday for a further two weeks,
apparently signalling that the company and the Federal Trade Commission had
failed to reach agreement on the terms of the deal, writes Richard Waters in
New York.
The waiting period for approval of the transaction under US anti-trust
legislation had already been extended once.
In a statement after the market closed yesterday, Lilly said the review
would now be extended further, to October 27.
'Because of the complexity of the transaction, additional time is needed to
complete the ongoing discussions between Lilly and the FTC,' it said.
The regulators have been reported for some weeks to be taking a harder line
on the Lilly/PCS deal than on two similar takeovers of distributors by drug
manufacturers over the past year - Merck's acquisition of Medco Containment
Services and SmithKline Beecham's purchase of Diversified Pharmaceutical
Services. The earlier transactions received FTC approval.
