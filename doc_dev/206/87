   Eli Lilly &amp; Co., maker the
anti-depressant drug Prozac, is among five defendants in lawsuits
brought by the widows of three men slain in a bloody rampage last
year at a printing company.
   Joseph Wesbecker killed himself after fatally shooting eight
co-workers at Standard Gravure Corp. on Sept. 14. Twelve other
shooting victims survived.
   Wesbecker was on long-term disability leave from his pressman's
job at Standard Gravure because of psychiatric problems at the time
of the shootings and was taking Prozac.
   The suits, filed Wednesday, claim Lilly, based in Indianapolis,
was negligent in its production, promotion and distribution of the
drug and seek $50 million from the company.
   The Federal Drug Administration says Prozac is the most widely
prescribed anti-depressant on the U.S. market. Former users of the
drug have said it drove them to violent tendencies, including
suicidal and homicidal thoughts.
   Last month, a New York woman sued Lilly for $150 million,
claiming she suffered severe side effects after taking the drug.
   Edward West, spokesman for Eli Lilly, said that of the 2 million
users of Prozac, Wesbecker's was the first report of violence. He
noted that Wesbecker also had a history of psychiatric problems
prior to using Prozac.
   ``It would not appear that Prozac caused this behavior,'' he
said.
   After the shootings, a six-member coroner's jury concluded that
excessive stress in the workplace, and possibly the effects of
psychiatric drugs, were factors that contributed to the shooting.
   Also named as defendants were Shea Communications, the owner of
Standard Gravure; Hall Security Service Inc., which provided
security guards to Standard Gravure; the estate of Joseph
Wesbecker, and Dr. Lee Coleman, the psychiarist who was treating
Wesbecker.
   Each suit seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages
from each defendant. The suits seek punitive damages in the amount
of $2 million from Wesbecker's estate and $5 million from Shea
Communications in addition to the $50 million from Lilly.
   The suits were filed by Louisville attorney B. Hume Morris II of
behalf of Linda Ganote, Joyce Fentress and Sarah Wible.
