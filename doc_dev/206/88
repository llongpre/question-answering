   Pfizer Inc. reported a 5.2% increase in third-quarter net income, but said profit for the full year "may fall slightly short of our objective." 

   Separately, Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly &amp; Co. posted an 11% rise in earnings. 

   Pfizer's net rose to $185.8 million, or $1.10 a share, from $176.6 million, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier. 
But the gain trailed the 13% profit increase in the first half. 
Sales for the pharmaceutical company rose 12% to $1.29 billion from $1.16 billion. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Pfizer shares fell $2, to close at $63.75 in a broadly lower market. 

   Edmund T. Pratt, chairman and chief executive officer, noted that a higher expected tax rate in the fourth quarter, compared with the year-earlier rate of 20.5%, will hurt the period's results "although favorable sales and pretax results for the fourth quarter are anticipated." 

   He said that with fourth-quarter earnings Pfizer may miss its long-term growth objective of 10% to 15% a year, as the company continues to spend heavily on research and development, and marketing. 

   For the nine months, net rose 10% to $553.6 million, or $3.26 a share, from $501.6 million, or $2.96 a share. 
Sales rose 10% to $3.64 billion from $3.31 billion. 

   Meanwhile, Eli Lilly reported third-quarter net of $150 million, or $1.02 a share, from $135.6 million, or 95 cents a share. 
Sales for the quarter rose 8% to $957.7 million from $883.4 million. 

   The maker of medicines, medical instruments and agricultural products said all its groups contributed to the improved results. 
Pharmaceutical sales abroad rose sharply because of an increase in unit volume and favorable exchange rates. 
Sales of agricultural chemicals also registered strong gains outside the U.S., Lilly said. 

   For the nine months, Lilly posted net income of $505.5 million, or $3.44 a share, up 17% from $433.9 million, or $3.02 a share in the year-earlier period. 
Sales rose 10% to $3.03 billion from $2.75 billion.
