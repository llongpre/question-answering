Eli Lilly, the US drugs group, yesterday indicated its third-quarter
earnings would be ahead of most analysts' expectations, due largely to
stronger-than-expected sales of Prozac, the anti-depressant which is its
biggest-selling product.
Mr Sidney Taurel, executive vice-president, pointed to 'solid worldwide
growth in new prescriptions' and a build-up of inventory by wholesalers in
the US ahead of a price rise which took effect yesterday. The company said
earnings per share for the three months to the end of September would reach
Dollars 1.08-Dollars 1.12, after a 14 cents a share charge for the takeover
of Sphinx Pharmaceutical.
Lilly revised estimates of earnings per share for the year to Dollars
4.65-Dollars 4.85, up from Dollars 4.55-Dollars 4.65. This is before special
charges, including those for the acquisition of Sphinx and the planned
Dollars 4bn takeover of PCS, a drug distributor.
In early trading, Lilly's share price rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 59, but
later fell back to close unchanged at Dollars 57 3/4 . Lilly's shares slid
by nearly 20 per cent in July on fears that it was paying too much for PCS,
but it bounced back on takeover speculation to close to its high for the
year.
