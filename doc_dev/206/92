Eli Lilly yesterday spelt out details of plans to shed its
non-pharmaceuticals businesses, including an initial public offering later
this year for a new medical devices company with sales of Dollars 800m.
In January, the US drugs company had indicated that it planned to group six
of its devices businesses into a single company for later sale. Under the
plan announced yesterday, though, one of these six, Ivac, would be sold
separately.
Lilly said this was because the company operated in a different market than
the others, and that it would benefit more from being bought by another
company. It added that it was in talks for the sale of the business, but
refused to name a potential buyer.
The remaining five businesses, all of which operate in the area of
cardiovascular or minimally invasive systems, will be floated in the fourth
quarter of this year, Lilly said. The intention is to sell 20 per cent of
the shares in this new company, to be known as Guidant, with the remaining
shares being distributed to Lilly shareholders within the following six
months.
This would either be done by issuing shares in the new company to existing
Lilly shareholders, or allowing Lilly shareholders to exchange some of their
shares for shares in the new company.
