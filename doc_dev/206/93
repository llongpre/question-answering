FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Eli Lilly issues warning on
profits

ELI Lilly, the US drugs group, warned that profits this year were likely to
be at the lower end of most analysts' predictions and could fall in 1994.
Mr Randall Tobias, in his first presentation to analysts since taking over
as chief executive last month, said the company would have to dig deeply
into costs: 'Our overhead structure evolved during a very different era.'
Downward pressure on drugs prices and increasing research and development
costs meant that the company's 1993 earnings were likely to be at the lower
end of the Dollars 4.45-Dollars 4.75 a share predicted by analysts.
The continuation of these pressures, and the possibility of a higher tax
charge resulting from the Clinton administration's economic programme, 'will
challenge Lilly to stay even with 1993 results next year,' Mr Tobias said.
He added that the company's cash flow remained robust and its debt levels
low.
Lilly, which has suffered from the lack of successful new drugs from its
research, used the meeting to announce it had signed a licensing agreement
with Eisai of Japan.
