<LEADPARA>  A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel agreed unanimously Friday that
there is no sound evidence to link Prozac or any other anti-depressant drug
with suicidal acts or violent behavior.;   The FDA's Psychopharmacological
Drugs Advisory Committee also voted 6-3 against changing the labels on
anti-depressants to warn of tendencies toward suicide or other acts of
violence.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Panel members did express concern about the kind of care given to depressed
people who eventually try to commit suicide or other violent acts, but
concluded that drug labeling was not the way to educate doctors.;   Witnesses
said in a hearing that suicidal thoughts normally are a symptom of depression,
and that there is no way to tell whether a drug or the disorder itself is
responsible for suicide or violence.;   Fifteen percent of untreated depressed
patients commit suicide, said John A. Smith, deputy executive director of the
National Mental Health Association.;   "Anti-depression medications decrease
suicidal 'ideation' and decrease suicidal behavior," said Dr. Peter Stokes,
professor of medicine at Cornell University Medical College in New York.;  
Smith said changing the labels would "needlessly frighten potential patients
from taking the medication or, even worse, encourage people to stop taking it
without consulting their physicians.";   About 30 witnesses, however,
maintained that Prozac had led to suicides, attempted suicides and homicides,
and health problems such as headaches, vision trouble and gynecological
symptoms.;   In addition, Dr. Martin Teicher of McLean Hospital in Belmont,
Mass., said it is possible that a small number of users might have bad
reactions to anti-depressants. Teicher, who was invited as an expert to aid
the panel, published the first study indicating Prozac might cause suicidal
thoughts.;   Prozac has been prescribed to more than 3 million patients in the
United States and more than 5 million worldwide.;   Numerous lawsuits have
been filed against Eli Lilly of Indianapolis, the manufacturer, alleging the
drug causes violent behavior. Four mental-health organizations, including the
American Psychiatric Association, said Thursday that a group supported by the
Church of Scientology, which actively opposes psychiatry, has spurred much of
the bad publicity about Prozac.;   The group, the Citizens Commission on Human
Rights, had petitioned the FDA unsuccessfully in October 1990 to withdraw
approval for Prozac, saying the group had documented adverse reactions to the
drug, including suicides and killings.;   But psychiatrists and other mental
health professionals told the panel there was no proof Prozac rather than the
depression led to the tragedies.; PROZAC; Approved by FDA: Dec. 29, 1987.;
Number of users: An estimated 5 million people worldwide since it became
available in January 1988.; Generic name of drug: Fluoxetine.; Manufactured
by: Dista Products Co., a division of Eli Lilly and Co.; Used to treat:
Depression. Also prescribed, though not FDA-approved, for obesity and
obsessive-compulsive, panic and eating disorders.; Standard dose: 20 mg. (1
capsule) daily. Can go as high as 80 mg. (4 capsules) daily.; Cost: About
$1.83 per capsule. Price for consumers may vary depending on pharmacy and
quantity purchased.; Side effects: Nausea or diarrhea, irritability,
restlessness or nervousness, sleep disturbances.; How it works: Causes
serotonin, a chemical that transmits nerve impulses in the brain, to remain
active longer by preventing its reabsorption into nerve cells. Depression has
been associated with decreased serotonin levels.; ...; Sources: Dr. Gary
