   Pfizer Inc. and Eli Lilly and Co., two major pharmaceutical
manufacturers, each reported Monday that their first quarter profit
rose by about 14 percent this year from the same period of 1987.
   New York-based Pfizer stated its net income for the quarter rose
to $219.8 million, or $1.31 per share, from $192 million, or $1.13
per share, a year earlier. Its sales rose to $1.3 billion from $1.1
billion in first quarter 1987.
   Lilly, based in Indianapolis, posted a first quarter profit of
$233.2 million, or $1.62 per share, compared with a profit of
$205.2 million, or $1.40 per share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales rose to $1.07 billion from $967.2 million a year earlier.
   Pfizer reported strong sales gains in all of its business
segments: health care, specialty chemicals, materials science,
consumer goods and agricultural products.
   Sales of Pfizer's anti-arthritic drug, Feldene, rose 33 percent
to pace the growth of the company's worldwide sales, Pfizer
reported.
   Lilly stated its sales growth came in both domestic and
international markets, although international sales rose faster.
   Lilly also announced it was investing $110 million for
construction of a new research centers in Indianapolis, to be
completed at its corporate headquarters by 1991. The company called
the project the biggest single capital expense in its 112-year
history.
