Eli Lilly, the US drugs company, has reached an outline agreement with the
US's Federal Trade Commission which will allow it to go ahead with the
planned Dollars 4bn acquisition of PCS, a pharmaceuticals distributor,
writes Richard Waters in New York.
The deal, full details of which have yet to be finalised, is expected to act
as a model for how two other drugs companies - Merck and SmithKline Beecham
 -operate similar drugs distributors that they have acquired in recent
months.
Lilly, while refusing to confirm that it had reached a provisional deal with
the anti-trust authorities, said it believed a final agreement would be
completed by next Thursday. This would open the way for completion of the
PCS acquisition before the end of the year.
The deal with the FTC is believed to require PCS to continue to offer drugs
made by companies other than Lilly. It will also establish arrangements to
prevent Lilly from gaining access to information about the prices at which
other companies sell their drugs to PCS.
Yesterday, Lilly sought to play down the significance of both aspects of the
agreement. However, concern that the deal would limit its ability to earn
the sort of profits it had hoped for from the PCS acquisition left the
company's share price Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 60 yesterday.
Merck said that it had also been asked for information during the FTC
investigation into Lilly, though it refused to say whether the regulators
were examining its dealings with Medco, its own distributor.
