Eli Lilly, the US drugs group, said it had agreed the sale of Ivac, one of
its medical devices and diagnostics businesses, and that it remained on
track to float most of the remainder on the stock market by the year-end,
writes Richard Waters.
Ivac, which makes drug infusion and vital-signs equipment, is being bought
by an investor group led by a buy-out fund run by US brokers Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Though the value of the deal was not disclosed, analysts
estimated that Ivac was worth a multiple of its sales last year, which are
understood to have been about Dollars 200m.
Lilly also said the company had received tax clearance for the flotation of
Guidant, a company formed out of five of its devices businesses, with total
sales last year of of Dollars 800m. Guidant, which analysts have valued at
Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn, should still make its debut on the stock market
in the current year, as originally planned, Lilly said.
