  [Text] Washington, March 5 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's top White House legal counsel Bernard Nussbaum 
resigned here today. 
  Nussbaum, a 57-year old New Yorker, said in a letter to 
President Clinton that his resignation would take effect April 5 
to assist the President "in arranging for an orderly transition 
in the counsel's office," White House sources said. 
  In a letter of reply, Clinton said that he accepted 
Nussbaum's resignation "with deep regret" and praised his 
efforts, the sources said. 
  But reports showed that the President in recent days made no 
effort to defend his counsel against mounting criticism from 
U.S. Congress and federal officials investigating an Arkansas 
real estate project which has links with the Clintons. 
  The lawyer's resignation is viewed here as a casualty of 
turmoil over the Clinton administration's handling of questions 
related to the real estate project. 
  The White House lawyer told President Clinton about his 
decision to resign late Friday night as he and five other senior 
White House officials were subpoenaed by the special legal 
counsel, Robert Fiske, investigating the project. 
  President Clinton met with Nussbaum in the Oval Office late 
last night. 
  The project, the Whitewater Development Corporation, was 
half 
owned by the Clintons and was connected with the failed Madison 
Guaranty Savings and Loan. 
  The failed Madison cost the U.S. taxpayers 60 million U.S. 
dollars and federal officials are investigating whether Madison 
improperly diverted money to Whitewater or to Clinton's 1984 
re-election campaign when he was governor of Arkansas. 
  The Clintons have denied any wrongdoing over the matter, 
saying instead that they lost 69,000 dollars on the real estate 
project in the 1980s. 
  The subpoenas have brought the Madison case directly into 
the 
White House, a bitter blow to the President and his aides. 
  The five senior White House officials who received subpoenas 
were White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, Hillary 
Clinton's Chief of Staff Margaret Williams, White House 
Communications Director Mark Gearan, Senior Adviser Bruce 
Lindsey, and Hillary Clinton's Press Secretary Lisa Caputo. 
Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman and three of his senior 
aides also received subpoenas. 
  In addition, a second subpoena calls for the White House to 
produce all documents or memoranda on any meetings, 
conversations or contacts on Madison between any White House 
staffers and officials of Treasury Department. 
  Treasury Department officials twice informed the White House 
last fall of the status of a federal investigation into the 
failed Madison. 
  All the subpoenaed officials were ordered to appear before a 
federal grant jury in Washington on March 10 when the documents 
must also be produced to the jury.
