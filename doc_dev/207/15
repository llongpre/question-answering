White House"] 
  [Text] Washington, 7 March -- President Clinton might be 
generally satisfied with his first 13 months of office. The 
recession is over, the economy is thriving, jobs are being 
created, and prices are relatively stable. NAFTA has been 
approved by Congress, and the Uruguay Round has finally been 
concluded. Initial agreements with the booming economies in 
Asia are emerging, and Clinton's first visit to Europe was 
generally praised, in spite of the war in Bosnia and the 
insecurity regarding future developments in Russia. 
  Despite these successes and Clinton's considerable 
popularity 
among the U.S. population, things are not going well with his 
presidency. His political credibility, which was never really 
solid despite the approval, has become suspect because of the 
so-called Whitewater affair. In fact, the White House legal 
adviser who was mainly responsible for the amateurish handling 
of this insignificant story dating back to Clinton's Arkansas 
past has now left the stage. However, journalists have tasted 
blood. A special public prosecutor is investigating the case, 
and Congress is seriously considering hearings. 
  Behaving as though the Watergate scandal had never existed, 
Clinton's advisers, out of a false sense of loyalty, assiduously 
tried to protect the President and his wife Hillary with plump 
maneuvers and delaying tactics instead of disclosing everything 
at the very beginning and dispelling doubts and mistrust. With 
this bunker mentality, which would have done credit to Nixon, 
they succeeded in making a mountain out of a molehill. It is 
not true that they enriched themselves personally or that public 
funds were used for private or political purposes in connection 
with the Whitewater investments and their deals with a bankrupt 
savings bank. Clinton is a womanizer, but he is not greedy for 
money, the well-known journalist David Broder stated on 
television. 
  Thus, the inexpertness and foolishness with which Clinton 
and 
his advisers have handled the Whitewater issue since 1992, 
creating the impression that they have something to hide, is all 
the more inexplicable. Legal adviser Nussbaum played a 
particularly inglorious role in this respect. Yet Hillary 
Clinton, probably the president's wisest political adviser, also 
failed in this case. The reason may be that Hillary Clinton, 
who has thus far won friends and opponents with charm, expert 
knowledge, and political finesse, is for the first time the 
object of criticism. Clinton's wife is more deeply involved in 
the Whitewater affair than the President himself, and faces the 
danger of being discredited. She was not only responsible for 
the investment decisions of the Clinton family. She was also 
the lawyer for the savings bank in question, and she fiercely 
rejected the nomination of a special public prosecutor who 
should examine the Whitewater affair. 
  To make matters worse, her friends and colleagues from the 
Rose Partnership in Little Rock, Arkansas, who have been given 
positions in important government offices, have meanwhile gotten 
into difficulties. Nussbaum had to resign. Vincent Foster, the 
deputy legal adviser at the White House, committed suicide last 
summer for unknown reasons, and Webster Hubell, one of the 
deputies of the attorney general, is being investigated by his 
former law office because of the alleged fraudulent settlement 
of accounts. 
  It is quite obvious how this development, which overshadows 
and which might even paralyze important legislative tasks, 
including the health reform, was possible. Thirteen months 
after Clinton took office, there is still nobody at the White 
House who directs the destiny of the White House and controls 
the apparatus with a firm hand, expert knowledge, and political 
instinct. Mack McLarty, Clinton's friend and chief of staff, is 
willing but weak. David Gergen, who already served President 
Reagan as communications director, is more interested in his own 
future than in Clinton's White House. All the other aides are 
too young and inexperienced to be able to give good advice to 
Clinton. Moreover, none of them has the required courage to 
confront Clinton and his wife Hillary openly with unpleasant 
things, Washington officials claim. What makes the situation 
even more complicated is that the White House staff is serving 
two presidents -- Bill and Hillary -- and has to divide its 
loyalty between the two. Hillary's unprecedented powerful 
position reportedly creates problems, too. William Kristol from 
the "Project for the Republican Future" has offered another 
explanation: Since Bill and Hillary have not learned to 
distinguish between "public and private, and official and 
personal matters," it is nearly impossible for aides to Bill and 
Hillary to draw a clear line between ethically permissible and 
unacceptable actions.
