THE 'HILLARY factor' and the role of Mrs Hillary Clinton, the wife of
Arkansas governor Bill Clinton, is emerging as a strong force in the
Democratic presidential primary campaign and a possible Clinton presidency.
As a full partner in her husband's campaign and a prominent lawyer in her
own right, Mrs Clinton, at 44, is as much a symbol of generational change in
national US politics as her husband. At first viewed as the 45-year-old
governor's secret weapon, she played a leading role in the nuts and bolts of
what has been a well-organised campaign.
However, her response last week to a spate of negative news stories about
connections between the state government and contracts granted to her law
firm has lifted her political profile. It may also have been something of a
lesson in why most candidates' wives confine their activities to sitting on
platforms and gazing adoringly at their husbands.
Speaking to journalists about how she might have to re-evaluate how she
conducts her career, Mrs Clinton blurted out: 'I suppose I could have stayed
home, baked cookies and had teas,' she said.
The remark was immediately seized on as a disparagement of women who forgo
careers to be housewives and mothers. Governor Clinton was forced to defend
it on television on Sunday. Insisting that Mrs Clinton 'believes that
rearing children is the most important work in our society', he said she had
been speaking of what could have been a 'largely ceremonial role' as
Arkansas state's First Lady.
Until then, Mrs Clinton was considered such a plus in the campaign that both
she and her husband like to say they are a 'two-for-the-price-of-one'
election bargain. She was certainly invaluable in parrying the womanising
charges which hovered over her husband until they came out in to open in the
Gennifer Flowers Affair.
When Ms Flowers, a part-time nightclub singer, told a supermarket tabloid
that she had had a 12-year affair with the governor, Mrs Clinton was at her
husband's side, urging voters in the New Hampshire primary to 'take the
election back from the sleazy tabloids'.
Most Americans got their first glimpse of Mrs Clinton's forceful personality
when the governor and his wife appeared on '60 Minutes', the top-rated US
television current affairs programme, to acknowledge implicitly that he had
strayed during his marriage.
However, said Mrs Clinton, 'I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing
by my man like Tammy Wynette (a country music singer). I'm sitting here
because I love him and I honour what he's been through and what we've been
through together. And if that's not enough for people, then heck, don't vote
for him.'
This kind of frankness can be alluring to many 'baby boomers' who admire her
independent mind and the equality of roles the couple seems to have
achieved.
Mrs Clinton's early press notices suggested she is tough where her husband
is more pliable. She could be, friends suggest, another Eleanor Roosevelt,
who was also considered more liberal than her husband.
While she has been named by the National Law Journal as one of 'the 100 Most
Influential Lawyers in America', her views are also under attack. In
scholarly articles and speeches, she has urged 'family policies' and
'children's rights', anathema to conservatives who fear the encroachment of
government into private lives (except on the abortion issue).
'Children should have a right to be permitted to decide their own future if
they are competent,' she has written. Also, she has argued, the US must
develop a comprehensive system of childcare, adapting to the reality that
most women now must work. (The Clintons have a 12-year-old daughter,
Chelsea.)
'If we compare our parenting policies in the workplace with those available
in our industrialised competitors around the globe, we seem to put less
actual value on the act of parenting than any other - despite our rhetoric,
despite the political talk about who can be more pro-family than the next
politician.'
Her views are, said The National Review, the conservative journal,
'chillingly . . . Swedish.'
No one knows how the 'Hillary factor' will play in the general election. In
Washington, observers wait for 'another high heel to drop' but she may have
already neutralised the issue.
Older voters may see her as a 'pushy' feminist. Certainly there could be
little more contrast with the maternal Mrs Barbara Bush or Mrs Marilyn
Quayle, wife of the vice-president, who earned a law degree but never
practised law.
