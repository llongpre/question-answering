   One of every four U.S. workers is now a college graduate, compared with just one in every five 10 years ago, the Labor Department said in a report showing significant increases in education levels in the American work force. 

   An additional 20%, up from 16% a decade ago, have completed one to three years of college, according to the new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

   At the same time, the proportion of workers without a high school diploma has declined from 24% in 1978 to 15% today, the bureau said. 
The share of the work force ending their formal education at the completion of high school remains unchanged at 40%. 

   While differences in the proportion of college graduates still exist among whites, blacks and Hispanics, all three groups have shown significant increases in the past 10 years. 

   Among white workers, 26% are now college graduates, up from 21% in 1978. 
Fifteen percent of black workers and 13% of Hispanic workers are college graduates, up from 10% and 9%, respectively, a decade ago. 

   Meanwhile, the percentage of high school dropouts has fallen from 40% to 23% for blacks, from 52% to 40% among Hispanics and from 14% to 8% among whites. 

   The survey, taken in March, continued a pattern showing that workers with the most education incur the least unemployment. 

   The jobless rate for college graduates was just 1.7%, compared with unemployment rates of 3.7% for workers with one to three years of college, 5.4% for high school graduates and 9.4% for high school dropouts. 

   At a record low 3.3%, the unemployment rate for black college graduates, however, was still more than twice the 1.5% rate among white college graduates. 

   While the proportion of working-age men in the labor force dropped slightly -- from 89.8% in 1978 to 88.6% this year -- it increased significantly for women. 

   Two of every three women of working age now hold jobs or are actively seeking them, compared with 56.1% a decade ago.
