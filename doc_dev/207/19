   One of every four U.S. workers is now a
college graduate, compared with just one in every five 10 years
ago, the Labor Department said Monday in a report showing
significant increases in education levels in the American workforce.
   An additional 20 percent, up from 16 percent a decade ago, have
completed one to three years of college, according to the new data
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   At the same time, the proportion of workers without a high
school diploma has declined from 24 percent in 1978 to 15 percent
today, the bureau said. The share of the work force ending their
formal education at the completion of high school remains unchanged
at 40 percent.
   While differences in the proportion of college graduates still
exist among whites, blacks and Hispanics, all three groups have
shown significant increases in the past 10 years.
   Among white workers, 26 percent are now college graduates, up
from 21 percent in 1978. Fifteen percent of black workers and 13
percent of Hispanic workers are college graduates, up from 10
percent and 9 percent, respectively, a decade ago.
   Meanwhile, the percentage of high school dropouts has fallen
from 40 percent to 23 percent for blacks, from 52 percent to 40
percent among Hispanics and from 14 percent to 8 percent among
whites.
   The survey, taken in March, continued a pattern showing that
workers with the most education incur the least unemployment.
   The jobless rate for college graduates was just 1.7 percent,
compared with unemployment rates of 3.7 percent for workers with
one to three years of college, 5.4 percent for high school
gradutates and 9.4 percent for high school dropouts.
   At an all-time low 3.3 percent, the unemployment rate for black
college graduates, however, was still more than twice the 1.5
percent rate among white college graduates.
   While the proportion of working-age men in the labor force
dropped slightly _ from 89.8 percent in 1978 to 88.6 percent this
year _ it increased dramatically for women.
   Two of every three women of working age now hold jobs or are
actively seeking them, compared with 56.1 percent a decade ago. The
most dramatic gains, according the Labor Department, have been
among women college graduates, up from 70.8 percent in 1978 to 80.6
percent this year, and those with one to three years of college, up
from 61.9 percent to 74.7 percent.
