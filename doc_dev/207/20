<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev article: "U.S. President Coming to Moscow </F>
To Support Russian Reforms"] 
  [Text] Here's a joke. Bill and Hillary Clinton are 
driving down a country road. They stop to fill up. "Hey," says 
Hillary, looking at the pump attendant, "I know that guy.... 
He's someone I used to date at school." "So if you'd married 
him," Bill replies, "you'd be filling someone's car up now too." 
"No," Hillary objects confidently, "that guy'd be president." 
  There are not very many people in the United States who 
would 
argue that without Hillary, without her ambition, without her 
fierce self-discipline, and without her brilliant political 
instinct enabling her to recognize not so much current as future 
enemies and friends -- without all this Bill would most probably 
have remained a provincial politician, even if he had managed to 
make it to Washington by becoming, for instance, senator for his 
native Arkansas. 
  It is said -- and this is the truth, not a joke -- that 
Clinton's daughter Chelsea phoned the White House from her 
Washington school to check with her parents on whether 
"America's first child" was allowed to have some injections. 
They went straight to the President, as Chelsea had 
recommended, citing the fact that "Mommy's always busy, so it's 
better to ask Daddy." 
  But both Bill and Hillary are workaholics able to work late 
into the night and start again early next morning. I would note 
that in this sense Washington is a rather strange town. Press 
conferences starting at seven or seven-thirty are a tradition 
here rather than a rarity. 
  It is hard to be U.S. President without being a workaholic 
-- 
although it is possible. One need only recall Ronald Reagan, 
one of the most successful presidents of this century -- 
successful in the sense that he fundamentally carried out, and 
even exceeded, his agenda which, I would recall, combined a 
policy of exhausting and shaking up the Soviet empire while 
simultaneously building up America's prosperity. But this same 
Reagan had a truly legendary capacity to snooze through Cabinet 
sessions and limit his working day to four or, at most, five 
hours of normal presidential activity, devoting the rest of his 
time to pleasant pursuits such as riding or talking with his 
wife Nancy. 
  But Reagan had a surprising ability -- he was excellent at 
delegating. This ability is almost an art -- few politicians or 
statesmen have it. Those who do almost always win -- they can 
focus seriously and thoroughly on the main, strategic, long-term 
issues, while letting their ministers, advisers, and other 
clerks handle the details. 
  One of Bill Clinton's problems, which was evident almost as 
soon as he became President, is his insatiable need to decide a 
lot -- if not everything -- himself. Which, incidentally, was a 
characteristic of one of Clinton's predecessors -- the 
Democratic President Jimmy Carter. He himself decided which of 
his advisers and aides would play at what times and how often on 
the White House tennis courts. Any independence for the clerks 
was completely ruled out. 
  Carter often lost sight of what was important in a mass of 
trivia. Not for nothing is his presidency (while undoubtedly 
burdened by objective factors such as the very serious world 
energy crisis) considered one of the weakest in America's recent 
history -- symbolized by the crushing and tragic failure of the 
attempt to free the American hostages held in revolutionary 
Iran. Carter took part at first hand in the job of working out 
the rescue mission -- which required excellent military 
knowledge -- often "knocking down" the opinions of genuine 
specialists. 
  Clinton too plunged into the job straight after the day in 
1992 when the presidential election left him victorious over his 
rival -- the Republican George Bush. Bill took on everything, 
quite forgetting that he was no longer governor of Arkansas but 
the president of a superpower where the budget for military 
bands is more than some other countries' state budgets.
