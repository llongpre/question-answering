<F P=106> [Commentary by Kurt Kister: "The Bold Attack of the Cool </F>
Lady"] 
  [Text] In a siege, there are two ways to ward off 
approaching enemies: Either you trust in your own stamina or you 
try to break up the opponent's army by bold sorties. The White 
House, where Whitewater has reached a threatening level, is 
adopting the second method lately -- forward defense. 
Nominating old Washington insider Lloyd Cutler as the successor 
of resigned legal adviser Bernard Nussbaum was such a sortie; 
the second one was made by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had so 
far been unusually quiet in the Whitewater affair. In several 
interviews with news magazines, the president's wife defended 
herself against criticism of her. 
  It is not so much the content of these interviews that is 
remarkable. Although Mrs. Rodham Clinton admits having made 
certain mistakes (especially the mistake of having participated 
in the dubious estate project at all), she keeps insisting that 
neither she nor her husband did anything wrong or even unlawful. 
She regards the affair primarily as a campaign by political 
opponents aiming at undermining the First Couple's credibility. 
This line of defense is well known. What is new, however, is 
that criticism is concentrating more and more on the First Lady 
-- and this is why her interview offensive is like a curious 
spectacle featuring a besieged person that is forced to do a 
sortie. 
  Mrs. Rodham Clinton is under fire for three reasons. First, 
she was the Clinton family's acting part in the Whitewater 
business. Second, she seems to have been one of the main 
protagonists in the failed attempt to limit the damage to the 
White House (she and her confidante Nussbaum tried to prevent 
the appointment of a special attorney up to the last minute). 
Third -- and this does her the greatest harm -- public 
admiration of how she redefined the role of First Lady has 
turned into criticism of exactly this redefinition. 
  Bill Clinton's wife is the president's most influential 
adviser in many domestic policy issues. In the central part of 
Clinton's agenda of reforms, the health insurance reform, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton had the position of a top politician that 
had neither been elected nor appointed. Admittedly, there were 
other president's wives before her, such as Eleanor Roosevelt or 
Rosalynn Carter, who considered the role of First Lady to be 
more than a mere hostess and smiling benefactress. But never 
before in this century did the White House see a wife as 
cogovernor. 
  Up until the Whitewater affair, this was not considered as 
suspicious. Quite the contrary, the media, which form the image 
of a presidency, praised Hillary Rodham Clinton as a 
revolutionary who perfectly embodies the changing role of women 
in America. For a long time, the wife was more popular than her 
husband. Surprisingly, hardly anyone wondered how Mrs. Rodham 
Clinton could be considered a shining example of emancipation, 
although she owes her present position exclusively to the fact 
that she is married to a man who was elected president. Putting 
it provocatively, one could say that she won her top position in 
a highly "unemancipated" way: through marriage. 
  This is not meant to detract from Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
achievements or even qualifications. As an attorney, she proved 
again and again that success in one's job does not have anything 
to do with one's sex or marital status. Like so many other 
women, she also had to bear the additional burden of having to 
stand her ground in a world that is still dominated by men. 
Maybe it is part of the burden that the empire is now fighting 
back: Bill Clinton is asked how he could let the mistakes 
happen. But his wife is asked what she is doing in a position 
where she could make such mistakes.
