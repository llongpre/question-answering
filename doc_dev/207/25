FT  23 SEP 93 / Last ditch moves on healthcare bill

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton called leaders of both parties to the White House
yesterday, for a final discussion on healthcare reform before he unveiled
his proposals in a speech to both houses of Congress last night.
Both Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary, who has headed the White House
healthcare task force, have spent the last week expressing readiness to
compromise on virtually all aspects of their proposal.
And despite months of planning, many details of the programme, particularly
how it will be paid for, have still not been determined.
Legislative texts are not expected to be sent to Congress until the
beginning of next month, and even the most optimistic do not expect the
reform to be passed before next spring.
Mrs Hillary Clinton this week set a still more modest timetable, predicting
only that a bill would be ready to sign into law within a year.
This would be perilously close to next year's congressional elections and
could endanger the spirit of compromise now prevailing between the political
parties.
The core of Mr Clinton's plan is the promise of universally guaranteed
health insurance by the end of 1997. But Mrs Clinton this week said she
would be 'open to talk about' a slower phase-in of universal coverage.
Most people would be enrolled in 'health alliances' which would broker a
limited range of government-regulated health plans for members.
All employers would have to pay 80 per cent of premiums for their workers,
although premiums would be subsidised for small companies. The plan
envisages spending Dollars 160bn (Pounds 104bn) over the next seven years on
these employer subsidies, Dollars 80bn to expand coverage of long term care
and Dollars 72bn to pay for prescription drugs under the Medicare programme
for the elderly.
Offsetting this, Mr Clinton hopes to save Dollars 285bn on existing
government health programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid, and to raise
Dollars 105bn from 'sin taxes', mostly from an increased tobacco tax,
although the precise details have still not been fixed.
The US public is still uncertain and divided about healthcare reform. A
recent Gallup poll showed that while 70 per cent of those questioned were
satisfied with their own coverage, 90 per cent believed US healthcare was in
crisis.
