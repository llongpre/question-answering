President Bill Clinton's first state of the union address will be delivered
on February 17, the White House announced yesterday, Jurek Martin reports
from Washington.
This will beat by a symbolic one day President Ronald Reagan's initial state
of the union message in 1981. Far more than last week's more spiritual
inaugural address, it will encompass legislative priorities at home and
external foreign policy objectives, though the fine print of Mr Clinton's
extensive list of domestic proposals is unlikely to be ready before
mid-March.
As part of the preparation, the president is taking his cabinet this weekend
to his Camp David retreat to debate policy options. On Monday he named his
wife Hillary Clinton to head the health-care reform task force.
