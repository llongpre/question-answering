FT  23 APR 94 / Hillary Clinton defends her business ethics

<TEXT>
Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday defended her business ethics and her
investment practices in an unusual White House press conference called in an
attempt to dispel the continuing questions over her and President Clinton's
involvement in the Whitewater Development Corporation.
She said she had no knowledge of money passing from Madison Guaranty, a
failed Arkansas savings and loan institution, to Whitewater or to Mr
Clinton's campaign funds.
She defended her successful trading in cattle futures, saying she had been
well advised by Mr James Blair, a close friend, and lucky in her decision to
pull out of the market when she discovered she was pregnant. 'He and other
friends of mine who continued trading ended up losing money.'
Mrs Clinton also denied she had received any favourable treatment in her
trading, in which she rode a bull market in cattle futures to build an
initial Dollars 1,000 investment into nearly Dollars 100,000 (Pounds
68,490).
'There isn't any evidence that anybody gave me any favourable treatment.'
Mrs Clinton acknowledged that her earlier reluctance to answer questions
about her finances had added to public doubts, and said she now regretted
that reluctance.
She also denied that her high-rolling investment strategies contradicted her
husband's campaign rhetoric about the greed of the 1980s.
