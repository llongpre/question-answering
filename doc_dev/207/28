quickly on pilot scheme

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday unveiled a pilot scheme he hopes to develop
into a far-reaching national service programme with the impact of the GI
bill in the 1950s or the Peace Corps in the 1960s.
Mr Clinton asked Congress to act quickly on a summer initiative designed to
create a core group of about 1,000 leaders to spur community service
programmes around the country.
The pilot programme is intended to develop into a broader scheme to provide
loans for university education, to be paid off by community service, which
the president hopes will involve 100,000 people by 1997. He proposes that
participating graduates would undertake either one or two years of direct
community service, or repay the loans as a percentage of the graduate's
subsequent income.
The president's promise that 'in a Clinton administration everyone will be
able to get a college loan as long as they're willing to give something back
to their country in return' was one of his most productive themes during
last year's presidential campaign.
With tuition costs at US universities rising by an average of more than 10
per cent a year throughout the 1980s, the cost of higher education has
become a particularly daunting prospect for the middle-income families that
Mr Clinton targeted during the campaign.
Budget realities, however, have forced the new president to scale back some
of his ideas. The programme is now budgeted at Dollars 98m (Pounds 69m) next
year, climbing to Dollars 3.4bn in 1998, as part of a broader 'lifelong
learning' spending package totalling Dollars 37.8bn in 1994-97, compared
with Dollars 63.3bn spent over four years in Mr Clinton's campaign
manifesto.
The president said in an article in the New York Times on Sunday that his
national service programme would concentrate on providing young people to
work in schools, immunisation clinics, police forces and environmental
projects.
He argued, however, that the programme could have a wider impact on a whole
generation, as the Peace Corps created by President John Kennedy had for his
own generation.
'At its peak, the Peace Corps enrolled only 16,000 volunteers yet it changed
the way a generation of Americans look at themselves and the world,' Mr
Clinton wrote.
He was also due to present his national service scheme last night on a
special programme on MTV, the music video channel which last year became the
favourite means of targeting younger voters for both Mr Clinton and his
opponent, former President George Bush.
