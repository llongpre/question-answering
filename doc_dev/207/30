Bill Clinton met Richard Nixon on Monday night. They were not actually in
the same room, town or state, and therefore did not discuss Russia,
Whitewater, Watergate or any other great matter of the past or present. But,
metaphorically, they were together.
The place was the Coliseum in Charlotte, North Carolina. The current
president was in the stands as his home state university of Arkansas, where
he was a law professor from 1973-76, played Duke, where Mr Nixon got his law
degree in 1937, for the national collegiate basketball championship. It is a
fair bet Mr Nixon was watching the game on television.
For Mr Clinton, it was the perfect end for the sort of Easter Monday that
only presidents get to enjoy. It started on the White House lawns with an
Easter egg hunt for children; it was levitated, via Air Force One, to the
traditional throwing of the first ball at Cleveland's magnificent new
baseball stadium; and it wound up in Charlotte, with his arms round the
black and progressive Arkansas coach.
Mr Nixon, in his time, was the self-appointed nation's 'first fan,' though
he preferred football. He used to volunteer suggestions to the then coach of
the Washington Redskins, the very conservative George Allen, whose son is
now Republican governor of Virginia, having been helped on his way by
fundraisers organised by the 37th president.
But the current comparisons doing the rounds are far more political than
sporting. Whitewater may never equal Watergate either in substance or
climactic end result, but both men have found themselves on similar racks.
The Nixon approach to his crisis was to try to brazen it out, with a White
House praetorian guard under Haldeman and Ehrlichman manning the drawbridge.
The Clinton tactic over the tale of his family's land and financial dealings
in Arkansas years ago was initially to deny almost everything and then to
parcel out information bit by bit. Neither approach worked.
Both came to office burdened with opprobrious nicknames - 'Tricky Dicky' and
'Slick Willy' - which reflected their tendency to moralise and their
quicksilver approaches to politics. Neither was easy to pin down or predict.
Mr Nixon, the presumed foreign policy hardliner, opened the door to
communist China; Mr Clinton's promise 'to end welfare as we know it' would
dismantle a Democratic party monument.
Both were also adept at stealing the political clothes of their opposition,
with Mr Nixon advancing some policies, including wage and price controls,
long favoured by the left and Mr Clinton attacking the budget deficit and
crime almost as if he were a Republican.
The combination of their respective personalities and policies meant that
both inspired something akin to hatred from those who believed they were
morally disqualified for the highest office. For Mr Nixon 20 years ago,
contempt came from liberals; for Mr Clinton today, it is from conservatives.
But many in the middle confessed, then and now, to being made uneasy.
Both faced a hostile media, though comparisons here can only be taken so
far. The Watergate story of 'high crimes and misdemeanours' instigated by
the White House may have been 'broken' by a handful of young reporters but
quickly came to consume the political and legal system and the country at
large.
Whitewater still appears mostly a media-generated affair, with some
assistance from Republican partisans, but underwhelming for the general
public. The quality of much Whitewater reporting pales in comparison with
what Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein achieved over Watergate.
The consolation for Mr Clinton is that Arkansas just beat Duke on Monday
night. The state whose entrails are now under the national microscope can
boast a president and a national champion for the first time. The Cleveland
Indians also won. The only bad Easter omen is that Hillary Clinton threw out
the first ball in Chicago, but the local Cubs promptly lost.
