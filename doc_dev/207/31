Before his ennoblement, Mr Nigel Lawson, the former British chancellor, once
explained the success of Thatcherism by referring to the tides of history.
The Conservatives, he implied, had been borne aloft in the 1980s as much by
powerful intellectual currents as by their own efforts. As the Democratic
National Convention opens in New York, I wonder whether Governor Bill
Clinton and Senator Al Gore may not benefit similarly from tidal forces of
unsuspected power.
The rise of Thatcherism coincided with a global shift towards free markets.
This movement continues, but, in the US, the Democrats may benefit from a
powerful cross-current. Many now believe that market forces must be
supplemented by more effective social and environmental policies. The
Clinton/Gore ticket neatly mirrors these anxieties: Mr Clinton has expertise
in education, welfare policy and health care; Mr Gore is one of the US's
leading environmentalists. Together these baby-boomers can speak with
authority on the critical issues of the day.
After three years of economic stagnation, economics was bound to play a
decisive role in this year's election. But fresh signs that the fragile
recovery is again flagging have raised the stakes. The candidate with the
most convincing plan for restoring prosperity is certain to have a powerful
advantage. Mr Clinton - unlike President George Bush or Mr Ross Perot, the
likely independent challenger - has a bold and potentially enormously
appealing economic message for the American people, if only he can
articulate it properly. It goes under the rubric of 'people economics'.
A coterie of close advisers has convinced Mr Clinton that efforts to improve
the education and skills of the workforce hold the key to American
competitiveness in the next century. The argument - long familiar in Britain
 -was well put by Mr Robert Reich of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government
in The Work of Nations (Knopf 1991). Mr Reich, a fellow Rhodes scholar at
Oxford with Mr Clinton, argued that capital mobility and global competition
rendered traditional Democratic approaches to the economy obsolete.
Rather than focusing on measures to aid industry or promote physical
investment, the US had to raise the skills and productivity of the American
people - the least mobile factor of production - thus raising their wages
regardless of the nationality of their employers.
Now listen to Mr Clinton outlining his 'putting people first' economic
strategy last month. 'In the emerging global economy, everything is mobile:
capital, factories, even entire industries. The only resource that's really
rooted in a nation - and the ultimate source of all its wealth - is its
people. The ony way America can compete and win in the 21st century is to
have the best educated, best trained workforce in the world . . .'
In proposing ways of improving workforce skills, Mr Clinton has moved well
beyond the usual focus on the failings of high schools. He wants to:
make employers invest in the training of all employees (rather than just top
executives) by imposing a training levy equivalent to 1.5 per cent of
payroll;
improve access to university by allowing all qualified students to borrow
from the government and repay either through a low tax on subsequent
earnings or by serving the community for a limited period - for example as
police officers or teachers;
offer new hope for the majority of Americans who do not graduate from
college by setting up a national apprenticeship programme loosely based on
continental European practice.
In America, such proposals are little short of revolutionary. The argument
that investing in people - all the people - will secure greater economic
prosperity has a good chance of resonating with the general public. Opinion
polls show that voters are confused and dismayed by the stagnation of wages
since the 1970s. Mr Clinton can offer both an explanation of what went wrong
and a cure that sounds plausible.
By contrast, the other candidates offer shopworn economic recipes. Mr Perot
is respected for his own entrepreneurial success. But on economic policy he
has advanced a succession of cliches. He talks of eliminating the Dollars
350bn budget deficit 'without breaking a sweat', yet his only concrete
proposal is to cut waste, fraud and abuse. He has criticised the free-trade
pact being negotiated with Mexico on the grounds that US employers cannot
compete with Mexican wages. Yet simply restricting US access to cheap labour
will do nothing to improve US productivity.
Mr Bush is even less inspiring. Under his stewardship, the economy has grown
more slowly than at any time since the 1930s. He has lost the confidence of
conservative supply-siders by acquiescing in minor tax increases and by
allowing real federal domestic spending to rise at an annual rate of nearly
9 per cent during his presidency. Yet he has developed no strategy for
channelling spending into productive investments, such as those proposed by
the Democrats. If Mr Clinton can lay to rest doubts about his character and
cogently articulate his vision of 'people first' economics, he has every
chance of winning in November.
