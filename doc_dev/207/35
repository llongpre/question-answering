Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, yesterday predicted the US Congress
could begin its investigation into the Whitewater affair by May 1. He
foresaw separate hearings by both House and Senate.
The prospect of congressional hearings was certain to be raised at last
night's prime time televised press conference, which President Bill Clinton
called to lay before a national audience his explanation of his past
investments in Arkansas and the many offshoots from it.
Polls yesterday indicated the Whitewater affair is eating into Mr Clinton's
popularity rating. The Washington Post-ABC poll recorded a drop in approval
to 47 per cent, 11 points below last month's levels. Other surveys have also
shown an erosion in support to around 50 per cent.
According to the poll, which surveyed 1,004 adults between last Friday and
Tuesday, 47 per cent of Americans approve of Mr Clinton's handling of the
presidency while 45 per cent disapprove and 7 per cent have no opinion.
Most polls show a public generally unpersuaded that Whitewater entails
serious wrongdoing on the part of the president or his wife. But each day
seems to bring some new reported allegation or distracting event. Yesterday,
for example, two senior White House aides, Mr George Stephanopoulos and Mr
Bruce Lindsey, told a federal grand jury what they knew about meetings at
which the state of regulatory investigations into a failed Arkansas savings
and loan company were discussed.
The White House has also been obliged to reassign internally one of its top
lawyers, Mr William Kennedy, after it was revealed he had failed to pay
social security taxes for a household employee. Mr Kennedy used to work for
the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas, where Mrs Hillary Clinton was a partner. Some
Republicans have demanded his dismissal.
