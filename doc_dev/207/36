Clinton's greatest attraction to American voters

Mr Bill Clinton might be the next president of the US, but with more than
six weeks to go that is all that can be said. His principal asset, I was
told over and over again in Los Angeles and Washington this week, is that he
is not Mr George Bush. He is young; the president is not. He is something
new; Mr Bush is all too familiar. He has a plan for the country's salvation;
the incumbent is blamed by many voters for setting the US economy on the
road to perdition. Yet there is no guarantee that Mr Clinton will win, in
spite of a lead that the conventional wisdom declares to be unassailable.
The Democratic candidate's problem is that he has the appearance of a
striver who is not quite 100 per cent gilt-edged. This is partly due to the
well-known accusation that he is an adulterer, a draft-avoider, and a man
who, when a student, puffed on a joint or two. In some eyes these are
peccadilloes but, in his anxiety to please, he has made the worst of them.
His successive explanations tumble over themselves. The danger for him is
that one day he may trip himself up.
He is attractive when addressing a crowd or moving within it to shake hands
and sign his autograph. He appears to enjoy pressing the flesh. To my eye,
he spoils it by a manner that is a touch over-studied. The gestures, the
hair-do, the smile, could have been designed to revive the image of Robert
Kennedy. If so, the comparison is to the disadvantage of the governor of
Arkansas. Where the former had soul, the latter has calculation.
This is not to say that Mr Clinton is more untrustworthy than any other
politician. In the eye of heaven, he may be judged to be possessed of
greater political integrity than President Bush. That is, however, beside
the point. What counts is that the challenger is vulnerable to attacks on
his character.
The intensity of such attacks, orchestrated no doubt by Mr James Baker, is
likely to increase. Nothing else that the president has tried seems to have
worked. The appeal to 'family values' - in reality a sigh of despair at the
changes that have taken place in society since the 1960s  - is politically
lucrative among the older generation, particularly in the southern states,
but less so elsewhere. The attempt to copy the subtext of the Conservative
election campaign in Britain earlier this year - 'sure we made you poorer
but the Democrats will make you poorer still' - has not so far been
effective.
In short, Mr Bush is still well behind in the race in virtually every state.
Former president Richard Nixon, now enjoying an established reputation for
shrewd political analysis, has advised the Republicans to forget about
California, where Mr Clinton seems set to win. That would give him 54 of the
270 electoral college votes necessary to put him in the White House. This
week, the challenger was back on the west coast again, a relaxed candidate
nailing down his huge lead.
His highly professional team placed him in south-central Los Angeles, where
burnt-out reminders of this year's riots can still be seen. At an
'employment preparation center' (vocational training school), he talked of
federally subsidised community development banks and federal matching funds
for the poor who save for a house or an education. He promised enterprise
zones, and the sharpening of a law (currently most honoured in the breach)
that obliges banks to invest specified sums in local areas.
There is courage in parts of this standard package: he is offering workfare
to the poor. That means that, after a while, social security ends if the
recipient does not sign up for a job, training or community service. The
students, hand-picked by advance teams, cheered and waved their pom-poms and
banners.
On to a Mexican independence day rally in the Hispanic area of Baldwin Park.
With practised passion, Mr Clinton preached his give-the-market-a-hand
interventionism. Mrs Hillary Clinton, splendid in pale blue, favoured the
sun-drenched audience with her best Princess Diana smile; the crowd, perhaps
aware of tendentious Republican attacks upon her, responded with loud
cheers. Mr Clinton talked again of helping the market to help people make
the best of their opportunities. In this part of town his language was a
shade more conservative than it had been earlier in the morning.
Watching, my mind raced back to 1968, when Hubert Humphrey lost to Mr Nixon
by a hair's breadth. Mr Humphrey was a man of substance, a New Dealer, a
socialist by today's definitions. He was, however, genuine. I heard him make
the same speech at brief stops in 48 states; he surely believed his own
words every time. The Humphrey promise was all about government handouts,
with nothing that I can recall on enterprise zones, or workfare. He offered
to perpetuate President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.
Mr Clinton is so far to the right of Mr Humphrey - and, for that matter, of
Mr Robert Kennedy - that he could be running as a Republican. He is offering
what all serious parties of the left must put forward today. This is an
activist government programme, dressed in free market clothing. It is hard
to combine the two streams of thought into something that appears
unadulterated.
President Bush is trying to find a vulnerable point: he has begun to
characterise the Clinton programme as 'social engineering' of the kind that
led to wholesale nationalisation in western Europe.
This is sheer electoral hyperbole. By European standards Mr Clinton's
policies are fairly centrist, some of them tending towards the centre-right.
On non-economic matters he is no lefty: he is a cruelly proven supporter of
capital punishment. Yet, as president, he would constitute a full-stop to
the anti-government years that began with the election of President Reagan.
He is no free-market minimalist. The Democratic Congress would be likely to
support his bills where it opposed his immediate predecessors'. He would, as
Americans say, make a difference.
Not too much should be made of this. The arithmetic of Mr Clinton's
proposals, which shifts spending around and increases taxes on the rich, is
not wholly convincing to anyone who regards reduction of the budget deficit
as a priority. Mr Bush's failing is that he does not appear to understand
the need for domestic renovation; Mr Clinton's that his principal motivation
appears to be to get elected. For that to happen, American voters must trust
him all the way to November 3. It could be tricky.
