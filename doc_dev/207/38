at the party's convention in Houston, spots a campaign trend

PRESIDENT George Bush, proclaiming himself revived in spirit and 'feeling
positive', is promising to pull no punches in his re-election campaign
against Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic party's nominee.
To that end, yesterday morning's session of the Republican convention was
treated to another invocation of the low blow that so damaged Mr Michael
Dukakis, the Democratic presidential candidate, four years ago.
Mr Dan Lungren, attorney-general of California, said in a speech on crime
that 'the Democratic icon of righteous indignation' consisted of two words
 -Willie Horton. He specifically linked Mr Clinton with Mr Dukakis's
supposed leniency towards the convicted criminal, which featured in
effective, but controversial, Republican commercials in 1988.
There were reports Mr Lungren had come under pressure to excise his comments
about Willie Horton and Mr Bush continues to insist he will engage in no
personal attacks. But the new sharpness in his own tongue combined with the
licence given to his surrogates gives a clear idea of the future direction
of the campaign.
Both Mr and Mrs Clinton are considered fair game. The litany against the
Democratic candidate is that he is 'the failed governor of a small state'
and thus unqualified to be president. His failure to serve in the military
in the Vietnam era will be repeatedly contrasted with Mr Bush's war record.
Armed with an incisive new speechwriter, Mr Bush is also developing some
good new punchlines.
Dismissing Mr Clinton's claim to be the comeback kid, he proclaimed 'we're
running against the karaoke kids, willing to follow any tune, like customers
at a singalong bar, to help them get elected'.
The charge against Mrs Hillary Clinton, given full airing by Mr Patrick
Buchanan on Monday night, is that she is a radical feminist with no
appreciation of true American values. Again the contrast will be made with
Mrs Barbara Bush, who is to address the convention tonight, in an unusual
departure for a president's wife.
But Mr Clinton scoffed yesterday at Mr Bush's claim he would make as big a
comeback in this election campaign as Harry Truman did in 1948.
'Harry Truman at least tried to take responsibility for the country. George
Bush blames everybody else for his problems,' Mr Clinton said. 'Truman had a
sign on his desk that said: 'The buck stops here.' Bush has a sign on his
administration that says: 'The buck stops everywhere else'.'
Undaunted, Mr Bush yesterday boldly told TV viewers that the US was 'poised
for very strong economic growth'.
'I think you are going to see a rather blooming economy,' he said
expansively, adding he would make a 'lot of changes' in top administration
personnel if he won a second term. He also wanted to accomplish change 'on
education, health care and the whole anti-crime and anti-drug front.'
