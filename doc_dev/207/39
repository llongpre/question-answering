Congress yesterday took its first tentative step towards putting together a
healthcare reform bill when a House of Representatives panel sat down to try
to draft legislation.
The subcommittee, a healthcare panel of the influential Ways and Means
Committee, is chaired by Congressman Pete Stark of California, whose own
proposal for reform is somewhat to the left of the plan put forward by
President Bill Clinton's administration.
Mr Stark wants to add a new category to the government-run Medicare
programme which now provides health insurance for the elderly, to cover both
the poor and unemployed, including those now included in the parallel
government Medicaid programme.
The new Medicare category would also be open to companies with up to 100
employees, who would, if they chose this option, have to pay 80 per cent of
the premium for their employees.
Controversially, Mr Stark also proposed yesterday a 0.8 per cent payroll tax
to raise Dollars 24bn a year, on top of the tobacco tax increase advocated
in the Clinton plan, to pay for some of the cost of expanding health
insurance to cover the entire US population.
While Mr Stark's proposal is seen by many members of Congress as redolent of
the kind of state-run medicine that provokes goosebumps among US doctors,
patients and politicians alike, its strength is that it is built on
Medicare, which is not only familiar but also generally popular among the
groups it serves.
Although the proposal differs in many respects from Mr Clinton's ideas,
which are based on health alliances to purchase insurance, White House
officials appeared happy that the Ways and Means subcommittee was at least
setting the legislative ball in motion.
Other subcommittees which have jurisdiction over parts of the healthcare
reform package have deadlocked, and the entire issue of reforming the system
has lost momentum.
Further complicating the task is the current preoccupation with the
WhiteWater financial affair, which has not only absorbed all the energies of
a good portion of the senior White House staff in recent days, but also cast
an unfavourable light on Mrs Hillary Clinton, who has been the
administration's principal spokesperson on health reform.
Mr Clinton yesterday expressed his optimism that a health care reform bill
will, in the end, pass the Congress.
