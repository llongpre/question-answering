   A brain tumor cut short the life of
11-year-old Clinton Hill, who dreamed of establishing a worldwide
club called Kids for Saving Earth. But a $1 million contribution is
making Clinton's dream a reality.
   The suburban Plymouth boy laid the groundwork for the club
before he died in November.
   ``He was worried about the air we breathe and the water we
drink,'' said Tessa Hill, Clinton's mother. ``He knew that kids can
make a difference.''
   Mrs. Hill enlisted Target Stores in her son's crusade after
noticing a flier that described the company's environmental
protection efforts. She asked Target executive George Hite to speak
to Clinton's class, and Hite was so moved that he lobbied for the
company to take on the project.
   ``It reminded me of how powerful kids can be,'' said Hite, vice
president of public and consumer affairs. ``They have a sense of
honesty, simplicity and a very strong commitment.''
   Target, a discount chain with 407 stores in 32 states, plans to
insert brochures explaining Clinton's idea in 35 million Sunday
newspaper advertising supplements on Earth Day, April 22. It also
will provide kits for schools telling children how to start
chapters of the club.
   The company will broadcast 30-second commercials nationally
during Earth Week promoting the club, and will give away millions
of posters and educational materials listing ways for children to
help protect the environment.
   During Earth Week, banners featuring the club's pledge will be
displayed at Target stores for children and adults to sign. The
banners then will be submitted to the United Nations General
Assembly.
   The pledge reads: ``The Earth is my home. I promise to keep it
healthy and beautiful. I will love the land, the air, the water and
all living creatures. I will be a defender of my planet. United
with friends, I will save the Earth.''
   ``We think it's very important to have a good society for our
own children,'' said 11-year-old Katrina Lusty, one of Clinton's
classmates from Sunny Hollow Elementary School in New Hope. ``We
think it's going to make a difference.''
   Classmate Tim Svensson, 11, said the members of Kids for Saving
Earth are taking steps in their own homes and communities to
protect the environment, such as urging their families to recycle.
   ``Kids can influence their parents,'' Tim said. ``The
politicians haven't done much so far as I can see.
   ``I love McDonald's, but they use a lot of Styrofoam,'' he said,
using a brand name popularly used for the polystyrene that keeps
hamburgers warm. ``When we go to McDonald's, we say, `No Styrofoam,
please.'''
   While more than a dozen cities have enacted bans on some plastic
products to keep them from choking landfills, McDonald's Corp. has
pushed for other approaches. It has a pilot program in which New
England customers are asked to separate plastic trash for
recycling, and representatives of the company are working on
proposals for a tax on use of unrecycled materials.
   David Rosene, Clinton's sixth-grade teacher, said kids are aware
that their future depends on that of the Earth.
   ``I think the students realize that this is an issue that
affects them personally,'' he said.
   ``These kids will be the graduating collegiates in the year
2000,'' Rosene said. ``They'll be ready to exert their influence on
the world.''
   Hite said Target's support for the project will continue as long
as there is interest in the club. Target, a division of
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp., will provide money from its
charitable contribution fund each year, he said.
   Hite said Kids for Saving Earth provided an opportunity to reach
the generation that will have to clean up the mess left behind by
today's adults.
   ``It will be the centerpiece of our environmental work,'' he
said.
