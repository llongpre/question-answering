FT  25 JUN 94 / Celebrating rites of passage: Americans know how to
negotiate life's stepping stones

My daughter, Caroline, graduated from Harvard recently and there was much
celebration - deservedly for her; more selfishly for the parent freed of
forking out Pounds 25,000-plus a year.
The warm glow of the three happy days of rejoicing at 'the other Cambridge'
still lingers, but with it a serious thought: that whatever else they may do
right or wrong, Americans understand the importance of commemorating rites
of passage - and there are few more serious than obtaining a university
degree. More than that, marking the occasion properly is a long-term
investment in the future, for university and graduate alike.
Dim 30-year old recollections of Oxford are of a quick shuffle in a cap and
gown, rented by the hour, along with a handful of others who bothered to
pick up their degrees in person, the odd bottle of fizz huddled under an
umbrella, and back to the grindstone. Younger friends report it has not
changed much since.
Harvard, America's oldest university, has been doing it properly for 343
years and so, for not as long, have most other groves of US academe, where
to graduate from college (and high school and kindergarten and typing
school, come to that) is regarded as worthy of proper commemoration not only
by those receiving degrees but all who have helped them - parents, friends,
lovers, teachers, even bank managers.
Cynics say America overdoes this sort of thing, giving awards and
recognitions to those who do not really deserve them. Even now a controversy
rages in higher education over whether what is known as 'grade inflation'
make degrees themselves worth the paper they are written on.
But, as US vice-president Al Gore kept repeating (in a different context) on
Harvard's glorious Commencement Day: 'The cynics are wrong.' There ought to
be nothing cynical, as the university's bachelor's degree citation puts it,
about 'passing into the company of educated people', nor about the sense of
occasion and its own history that Harvard puts on display every year.
My daughter's graduation was no exception. Of course, it helped that the
weather was magical but local lore has it that it never rains on Harvard's
graduation and, if it does, it is only scotch mist, which no one notices.
Certainly a crowd that must have numbered 25,000, only about a third of them
getting first and higher degrees, could scarce forbear to cheer at every
opportunity (with the business school graduates cheerfully and greedily
waving dollar bills).
The featured guest speakers were Al Gore (class of '69) and recipient of an
honorary degree this year, and Lani Guinier. In truth, the vice-president
was not at his best in a speech that wandered more than a little from its
central text - that cynicism is the enemy of democracy.
But his now well-rehearsed line in self-deprecation ('I'm a living example
to the millions of Americans suffering from Dutch elm disease') got
appreciative laughs.
But Guinier was nothing if not challenging. She is the black law professor
nominated last year to run the justice department's civil rights division
but ditched by President Clinton after she had come under fire from the far
right for allegedly advocating weighted voting according to race.
Her message - that the problem of violence in inner cities is but a mirror
image of the fault lines in established society - got a few of the parents
grumbling, but was delivered with a force and a logic designed to dispel
complacency in the younger generation present.
Best of all were the student speakers, chosen by the faculty and then given
additional training by a drama coach. One gave the traditional Latin
oration, replete with references to the Simpsons and Whitewater. Another
wondered if the manic pursuit of goals left room for a real life. A third
urged the law school graduates to take up cases pro bono (for free). A few
were sentimental, but not weepy, and all were as pleased as punch to have a
role in the ritual.
Nine honorary degrees were awarded, the selection again showing the
catholicism that Harvard prizes but which British universities, too often
consumed with petty politics and ideology, sometimes fail to match - as
witnessed yet again by the carping surrounding Clinton's doctorate of laws
from Oxford.
As well as Gore, they included Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for
Refugees; Benny Carter, the black jazz musician; an ancient Harvard classics
professor; and even the president of Yale, grinning as the mention of his
university was greeted with universal hisses.
Commencement Day is also a great occasion for alumni, marching around
Harvard Yard according to their year, the very oldest in wheelchairs, their
fund-raising activities for the university recorded publicly.
And we are talking serious money: in less than a month since its launch, the
new Harvard campaign to raise Dollars 2bn had generated over Dollars 670m,
more than 1 1/2 times as much as the Pounds 268m Oxford has raised over five
years.
The discrepancy can be put down to differences in state support, national
wealth and attitudes towards philanthropy, as well as a testament to the
career successes of old Harvard men and women. But another element must
surely come into play - the great sense of obligation that Harvard graduates
feel towards the university.
The relationship is not a one-way street. An Ivy League degree looks good on
any resume, as does one from Oxbridge, although it is less of a guarantee of
instant success and riches in today's tough employment market than it was in
palmier economic times. But the Harvard network of important connections is
not left to chance. Harvard clubs flourish all over the world, bringing
people together often for more than a drink.
Rarely does a week go by without my wife, Kathleen (class of '72), receiving
Harvard mail - and not all of it, by a long chalk, asks for money.
Oxbridge is much less good at preserving this sense of mutual assistance.
This was a message I tried to convey in a modest speech last autumn to an
Oxford dinner and it seemed to have been well-received (even by John Patten,
the education secretary). But there has been no communication from the
college since, and my inclination to contribute to the Oxford fund has not
grown more keen.
Harvard, on the other hand, does even the little things well in sending its
products on their way. Within two hours of getting her degree from the
Master of Leverett House, Caroline had it framed: a quick service for just
27 bucks by the Harvard Co-op, ready to be hung forever on a wall. I am not
sure in what dark closet my rumpled piece of paper can be found.
