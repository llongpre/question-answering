McLarty

There are not many people who can say of the 42nd president of the United
States, as Mack McLarty did on Thursday morning: 'In many ways, Bill Clinton
is the same person he was in kindergarten.' Nor be quick enough to realise
that he should not give the impression that the Oval Office is now inhabited
by a five-year-old. 'That's not to suggest he hasn't matured and grown
wiser,' was his next sentence.
Washington this week was filled to the rafters with FOBs (friends of Bill),
all members of the extraordinary number of overlapping networks the Clintons
have maintained over the years. But Thomas F McLarty, known as Mack, is the
only BOF (Bill's oldest friend). Both 46, they go all the way back to Miss
Mary's kindergarten in Hope, Arkansas. Now William J Clinton, still called
Bill, has turned to Mack to help him in Washington as the White House chief
of staff.
There is, potentially, no more sensitive job in the capital. Exactly how it
is performed depends on the wishes and needs of the president, and each has
had his different requirements. But even a breezy look at recent history
shows how much the chief of staff can make or break a president.
Probably the most successful in the past 20 years was James Baker in Ronald
Reagan's first term who ran a tight but not leak-proof ship. Above all, he
protected his president from situations in which he might be caught
off-guard.
Another Baker, Howard, the former senator from Tennessee, also did well as a
damage control operator when Mr Reagan's final years turned sour. Dick
Cheney, later a congressman from Wyoming and the just-departed defence
secretary, was a great help to President Gerald Ford in a difficult period.
Better remembered are the failures: H R Haldeman, who pandered to all
Richard Nixon's darker instincts and paid for it with a prison term:
Hamilton Jordan, whose contempt for the Washington establishment did no
favours to an outsider president, Jimmy Carter: and two of President Bush's
chiefs of staff, John Sununu, fiercely ideological and personally abrasive,
and Sam Skinner, who never realised until too late that his boss was in deep
political doo-doo.
His friendship with his president apart, McLarty comes to Washington
probably the least known of the new Clinton team. The son of a successful
car dealer and University of Arkansas graduate, he embarked on a political
career early and, at 23, became the youngest ever state assemblyman. But his
father's failing health brought him to the family firm, where he did well
enough developing its leasing business that, still only 30, he was elected
to the board of Arkla, the natural gas utility. Seven years later he was its
president, replacing Sheffield Nelson, who was to become Mr Clinton's arch
political rival, and two years on its chairman and CEO.
He inherited a company in crisis, afflicted by declining oil prices, mild
winters, and expensive long-term pipeline contracts. By the mid-80s Arkla's
debt far exceeded its net worth. By 1989, its stock price had dropped 70 per
cent and its credit rating was dubious. It is still not out of the woods
even after an extensive disposal of assets, and McLarty's chairmanship is
not without its critics.
One acquisition, of a Houston natural gas company which may still be liable
for the debts of a local savings and loan it owned before being taken over,
leaves Arkla with a potentially high and still disputed charge. But McLarty
gets general credit in the industry for keeping it afloat, and it was still
in the charts as the 47th-largest utility in the most recent 1991 rankings
of service companies by the Fortune 500.
But his record as a businessman is not why he was the first person named by
Mr Clinton to a Washington job.
The explanation lies in Arkansas, which, to repeat the ultimate cliche,
really is a small state where everybody who is anybody knows everybody else.
Though out of elective state politics for more than 20 years, the chairman
of one of its biggest companies is a de facto intimate of every politician,
not least its governor. Sometimes this has presented problems for McLarty,
as in 1990 when he remained conspicuously neutral in the governor's race
between Clinton and Sheffield Nelson. But this never harmed his relationship
with the Clintons. He was a discreet intimate throughout last year's
campaign and a big fund-raiser.
All the Arkansas references are glowing, from friend and foe alike, though
he seems to have few enemies. He is universally described as methodical,
intelligent and, above all, gracious. His television performances in the new
limelight this week certainly showed his quiet charm. They also disclosed a
canny skill at saying nothing in the nicest possible manner.
He has talked a little, however, about his role as chief of staff. He does
not see himself as a gatekeeper or high profile operator, which means he may
have been seen more on TV in the first two days of this administration than
in the next two years.
The key, as he told the Washington Post recently, is: 'I really believe that
Bill and I are not going to have any trouble talking straight to each other.
We've done that for years and it flows very smoothly. He wants it. That was
one of the real elements he felt was needed.'
Mrs Clinton is getting an office in the political west wing of the White
House rather than the social east wing, and will be a power in developing
healthcare policy. McLarty's view is: 'Hillary's a good friend, too, someone
I really greatly admire.' He even discreetly allowed that there were some
differences between the approaches of the president and his influential
wife. 'The linear style of thinking (reaching a decision and pushing ahead
with the next item on the agenda) might be more Hillary's style and my
style.'
So Mack McLarty begins his capital odyssey with a clean sheet and the
complete trust of the man who is president, but as a relative innocent in a
city with many more snakes than ladders - one of which Zoe Baird failed to
climb this week. He also has a fear of flying, but, then, there is much to
do without leaving the ground in Washington.
