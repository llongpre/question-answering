<LEADPARA>  At a breakfast for rural newspaper editors at the governor's mansion in Little
Rock recently, Bill Clinton, who announces his candidacy for president today,
showed why he keeps getting re-elected governor in the midst of a fierce
anti-incumbent, throw-the-bums-out mood among voters.;   Spotting one weekly
newspaper editor, Garrick Feldman, Clinton called upstairs to his daughter,
"Chelsea, come say hi to Rebecca's father."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     When an editor of another small paper joked about being hungry, the
6-foot-3, 220-pound Clinton began patting his own stomach and commiserating
with her about dieting.;   That's when Bill Woods of the Grand Prairie Herald
piped up, "You sure didn't push away from the table when you ate at my
house!";   Arkansas, say the locals, is not just a small state; it's a small
town -- and 45-year-old Bill Clinton seems to know just about everyone in it.
That comes in handy: Going into his 1990 re-election campaign, polls showed
him running only slightly ahead of Republican Sheffield Nelson. But when the
votes were counted, Clinton's friends had given him nearly 57 percent of the
vote.;   Friends everywhere; "You could drop him down by helicopter in any of
the 75 counties in this state, and he'd have some close friend he'd want to
visit," said Clinton press aide Mike Gauldin.;   University of Arkansas
political science Professor Diane Blair said that in a state that ranks 47th
in per capita income, Clinton has that most basic of Arkansas values on his
resume: He grew up poor.;   "He's not just from Arkansas, he's of Arkansas,"
Blair said.;   Critics and supporters agree that Clinton, a Georgetown
University and Yale Law school-educated Rhodes Scholar voted the best governor
by his fellow governors, has used his good ol' boy charm almost
single-mindedly on a progressive cause -- upgrading the state's educational
system.;   Education agenda; There were those who didn't want any part of this
agenda, but Clinton has gradually won over his most ardent opponents,
including the Legislature, the teachers unions and the state Chamber of
Commerce, which in turn has used Clinton's educational reforms to attract new
business to the state. Even Republicans who dislike Clinton concede that his
perseverance in that quest is certainly the achievement that most recommends
him as a presidential candidate.;   As a Democratic candidate, Clinton will
attempt to position himself as a moderate to conservative Democrat, who is not
all that different from President Bush on foreign policy and is pro-business.
But he will insist that he is vastly more committed than Bush on such issues
as spending for early childhood development programs, aggressive federal
intervention in public schooling, adult literacy and job retraining.; Graphic
