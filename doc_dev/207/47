FT  28 JAN 93 / Observer: Stone cold in the market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's not only bridge players whose hearts leap at the prospect of not one,
but two grand slams in diamonds. The De Beers' marketing department must
have been likewise stirred by two unrivalled chances to promote their rocks
both in and beyond the globe's premier selling places: Japan and America.
Firstly - and perhaps not unconnected with the worldwide televising of
President Clinton's inaugural celebrations - Hillary Clinton was persuaded
to attend wearing a 4 1/4 -carat diamond in a ring specially designed for
the occasion. The stone found in Arkansas' Crater of Diamonds park in 1977,
was loaned to Clinton by no less than Stan Kahn of Kahn's Jewelry in Pine
Bluff.
Alas, the watching millions caught not a glimpse of the glitter. In line
with convention, the presidential spouse kept her gloves on throughout the
ceremony.
Still, although thus cutting no ice at the US inauguration, the marketeers
had Japan to keep their hopes alive. Just think of the promotional potential
in the diamond engagement ring which the Japanese jewellery trade is certain
Crown Prince Naruhito has given his bride-to-be.
Boom - convention strikes again. Protocol forbids the disclosure of any
sales-boosting information about the ring. Too many Japanese would be
dismayed were their royal family to be associated with a commercial
exercise.
Worse, even informally, none of us is ever likely to cast an eye on the new
Empress's diamonds. In Japan, engagement rings are not for wearing, but for
locking away in a safe deposit.
