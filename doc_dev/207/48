Three White House officials yesterday gave evidence in secret to a federal
grand jury investigating the Whitewater affair. Stacks of relevant documents
were also turned over to the same panel, convened by Mr Robert Fiske, the
independent counsel probing Whitewater.
The officials called yesterday were understood to be Mr Mark Gearan, the
communications director, Ms Margaret Williams, chief of staff to Mrs Hillary
Clinton, and Ms Lisa Caputo, the First Lady's press secretary. All are said
to have attended meetings with regulatory officials investigating Madison
Guaranty, the failed savings and loan institution at the centre of the
Whitewater affair, involving Mr and Mrs Clinton's 1980s financial dealings
in Arkansas.
Other senior White House and treasury officials have secured temporary
postponement of testimony, most until next week. But one of them, Mr Roger
Altman, the deputy secretary of the treasury, confessed in an interview
yesterday with the Wall Street Journal to 'a piece of awful judgment' in
arranging a meeting on February 2 with the White House to discuss the status
of the Madison inquiry.
He was then acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency
formed to clean up the nationwide savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. He
said he never told the president, First Lady, or Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the
treasury secretary, in advance about his initiative in briefing the White
House, but insisted the session was purely informational.
Republicans have alleged the briefings were improper and raised the
possibility of official tampering in the case.
Washington suspects Mr Altman, the Wall Street investment banker who has
been a high flyer in the administration, may be the next prominent victim of
Whitewater. Although the White House insists there is no question of his
resignation, his chances of succeeding Mr Bentsen have clearly diminished.
President Bill Clinton went on the road to New York yesterday for speaking
engagements to give the impression of business as usual. The threat of early
congressional hearings on Whitewater, which Mr Fiske said could interfere
with his own inquiries, appeared to recede. Senator William Cohen, the Maine
Republican, doubted yesterday that hearings could be held before June.
The president could also take some encouragement from two polls published
yesterday which showed that, notwithstanding a torrent of critical and now
nationwide media coverage, the public is still unpersuaded by the
seriousness of Whitewater.
The Wall Street Journal/NBC survey found 34 per cent believing it was being
used against him for political purposes, with only 16 per cent persuaded he
had done anything wrong. The USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll found well over half
convinced Mr and Mrs Clinton had done something unethical. But both reported
only a little erosion in the first couple's approval ratings.
