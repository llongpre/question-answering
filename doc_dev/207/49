<HEAD>Ball State Offers To Enroll 11-Year-Old Graduate</HEAD>

   Ball State University has offered to accept
a California college graduate who otherwise might have to return to
junior high school because he's only 11.
   Adragon E. DeMello of Santa Cruz, Calif., received his
bachelor's degree in mathematics last week from the University of
California at Santa Cruz. But he has been turned down by several
graduate scools because of his age, a Ball State official said
Tuesday.
   ``Universities talk about being accessible to all who are
qualified,'' said John Hill, assistant dean of the graduate college
at Ball State.
   ``This spring, we awarded a doctoral degree to a man who is 80
years old, so this young man would not be our first non-traditional
student.''
   Under California law, if DeMello is not accepted to a graduate
school, he must take the same classes as other 11-year-olds.
   The boy's father said he is considering moving abroad because of
that law, but did not say whether Ball State's offer would be
accepted.
