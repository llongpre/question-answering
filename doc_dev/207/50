FT  18 JAN 93 / Washington braced for the big bash: The five-day
extravaganza marking the US presidential inauguration

WHEN it is not consumed by the plight of Nicaraguan peasants, National
Public Radio, the closest American broadcasting comes to the BBC, has a nice
line in gentle humour.
The other day it ran a skit in which one of its women reporters, who is
unmarried and happens to have a ticket for the inaugural ball, took calls
from really famous people, such as TV talk show hosts and the odd senator,
all begging for a date next Wednesday night.
Tickets, beds and chairs are perhaps the most important commodities in the
five-day multimillion-dollar extravaganza that is this week's presidential
inauguration. There are, quite simply, not enough of the first two to go
around and there may, when it is all over, be a distinct shortage of things
to sit on in perhaps the most important room in the country.
Free-market theorists will be disappointed to know that there is virtually
no secondary, or scalping, market in tickets for the balls, galas and parade
stands. The inaugural is one of those occasions when tickets have no retail
value, as the important thing is to be there and to be seen to be there.
The official inaugural programme is extensive; starting even before a
30ft-by-60ft fireworks representation of Bill Clinton playing the saxophone
lit up the skies over the Potomac to mark his arrival from Thomas
Jefferson's Virgina home yesterday, and ending with a White House open (but
by invitation) day on Thursday. But it is dwarfed by the unauthorised,
though lavish, events also scheduled for this week.
The terse Associated Press diary is now more than 3ft long, only the first
11 inches of which are taken up by official functions. Unofficial highlights
include an Animal Ball, at which vegetarian food will be served by
waitresses clad only in aprons and to which the wearing of furs is
prohibited, the MTV rock n'roll ball, with live music and a performance by
Mr Clinton's country music singing brother, and a ball for the homeless, to
which food contributions are required and the wearing of 'church clothes'
recommended.
On Monday night the Clintons and Gores will be attending the official gala
at a suburban sports centre but will not be the main attractions. The
monarch himself, Michael Jackson, will be singing and dancing, and so will
the queen of Hollywood, Barbra Streisand, recently energised by her
organisation of a boycott of Colorado because of its passage last November
of an anti-homosexual initiative.
There have been reports from Los Angeles that the 'stars', who expect to be
treated like royalty, are a bit miffed at the shortage of appropriate
accommodation and lack of recognition accorded to them in Washington.
There has certainly been a run on local stretch limousine rentals not seen
since the Reagans took over the town 12 years ago.
The cost of all this is impossible to estimate. The official side is
supposed to be operating on a Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.1m) budget, financed by
the sale of memorabilia and by private donations, which have been solicited
(including, controversially, by Mrs Hillary Clinton's brothers, who would
have been better advised to sing back-up to Roger Clinton). As sure as it
will be cold this week, this budget will be broken.
There have naturally been complaints that tickets have been priced out of
the reach of ordinary people, also arriving in thousands. At Dollars 125 a
head an official ball ticket is cheaper than any at the Reagan and Bush
inaugurals; the problem is simply laying hands on one. It is assumed that
the whole population of Arkansas (3.7m) has them, but evidence suggests this
is not true.
In any case, there is much free entertainment. The Johnson Mountain Boys,
one of the stellar bluegrass groups, seem to be performing three times a
day. So, for aficionados of Slavic music, are the Popovich brothers.
However, anyone with a spare bedroom in Washington has discovered how many
out-of-town 'friends' they have. Every office with a view over the
Pennsylvania Avenue parade route has already ordered the paper cups and
cocktail snacks.
But one room is going to look rather different when it is all over. Most of
the members of the Bush cabinet are taking home with them the chairs they
sat in while deciding the affairs of state.
Each chair costs Dollars 1,666 and has a commemorative plaque on the back.
Some staff members chipped in to buy the chairs for their departmental
heads; the cabinet itself had a whip-round to give Mr Bush his.
Theoretically, new chairs have been ordered for the Clinton cabinet. But if
they have not arrived in time 'there's plenty of folding ones to go around,'
according to one Republican White House aide.
