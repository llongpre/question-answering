PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton yesterday appointed three women to senior
positions in his administration and brought his old Oxford friend and
adviser, Mr Robert Reich, on board as labour secretary.
Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a professor at the University of California, will
be the new head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. An expert
in trade and industrial policy, she has advocated government intervention to
promote the high technology sector.
Ms Donna Shalala, the highly regarded chancellor of the University of
Wisconsin, gets the health and human services portfolio. She worked in
President Jimmy Carter's housing department, is close to Mrs Hillary Clinton
and has been attacked for being 'politically correct'.
Ms Carol Browner, who runs environmental regulation in her native Florida,
becomes the next head of the Environmental Protection Agency. She served on
the Senate staff of vice-president-elect Al Gore.
Mr Reich, though not a qualified economist, has, like Ms Tyson, been
critical of classical free-market policies.
Mr Clinton had said his government would be 'more like America' in its
racial and sexual composition. With four of his first nine senior appointees
women, he has lived up to part of that pledge, but no black, hispanic or
Asian Americans have been nominated.
The appointments are probably closer to the 'new kind of Democrat' Mr
Clinton promised to include than were the economic team, under Senator Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas as Treasury secretary, announced on Thursday.
