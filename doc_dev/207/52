Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel, and senior Republicans yesterday
failed in their first attempt to negotiate a compromise under which Congress
could hold hearings into the Whitewater affair.
Both Senator Al D'Amato from New York and Sen William Cohen from Maine
remained hopeful some resolution could be reached. Sen Cohen spoke of
delaying a congressional investigation and of not granting immunity from
prosecution to witnesses, if either made Mr Fiske's task easier.
The special counsel did not budge from his objection that hearings on
Capitol Hill could jeopardise the integrity of his own investigations.
But he conceded he could not stop Congress calling hearings. He also implied
he could work around them if they were confined to the question of meetings
between White House and regulatory officials on the status of Madison
Guaranty, the Arkansas savings bank at the heart of the Whitewater affair.
He added he was completely satisfied with White House co-operation to date.
The failed Arkansas savings and loan institution is at the centre of the
Whitewater allegations that Mr and Mrs Clinton engaged in improper financial
dealings in the 1980s.
The Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill seemed more determined than ever
yesterday to frustrate Republican wishes. Sen George Mitchell of Maine, the
majority leader, said the Republicans wanted to stage 'a political circus'
that would 'throw up a lot of dust and embarrass the president'.
Mr Fiske, Senator Mitchell said, 'is independent, is a Republican, was
selected at the request of Republicans and it's very clear, as he says, you
can't have both a congressional investigation and an independent
investigation'.
Press advice on the issue was mixed yesterday. The New York Times urged a
compromise that would give Mr Fiske 'a head start, probably measured in
weeks' before Congress got in on the act.
The Wall Street Journal, as ever virulently anti-Clinton, headlined its
comment yesterday: 'The Fiske Cover-up.' It pretty much demanded
fully-fledged hearings.
The president's press spokeswoman was forced to deny rumours in the New York
markets that Mr Roger Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary, was about to
resign because he had participated in the S&amp;L meetings. He is among 10
officials under subpoena to testify in front of the federal grand jury
convened by Mr Fiske. Mr Clinton said yesterday he had advised the 10 to be
'very open' and tell everything they knew.
Several news organisations continued to report on the alleged shredding by
the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, where Mrs Hillary Clinton was a part ner,
of documents purportedly bearing the name of Vincent Foster, the deputy
White House legal counsel who com-mitted suicide last summer.
