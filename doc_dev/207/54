The American political wheel has come full circle in a little over six
months. Barring the unpredictable, the November presidential election will
as usual be fought between a Republican and a Democrat, with no serious
outside interference.
Back in January, the general expectation was that President George Bush
would probably win re-election against one of a gaggle of second-string
Democrats, of whom the likeliest prospect appeared at the time to be
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
This could still be the outcome. But only a Rip van Winkle, unaware that so
much water has flowed in so many torrents under the political bridges since
then, would confidently predict it.
Unless it is all an illusion, neither the country nor the candidates are
quite what they were. It was known before the year began that Americans were
in a sour mood with the political establishment but the depth of their
discontent was not fully apparent.
Their temporary embrace of such improbable protest candidates as Pat
Buchanan, only a rightwing polemicist, Jerry Brown, the arch exponent of
political cynicism and self-indulgence, Paul Tsongas, worthy but duller even
than Michael Dukakis, and, above all, of Ross Perot, revealed at last as
just another self-centred autocratic Texas billionaire, showed a hunger for
something different, even fraudulently different.
But they have all gone. Left standing, as in the beginning, are George Bush
and Bill Clinton and they surely are not the same.
Some find the first evidence of President Bush's frailty in the Pennsylvania
Senate by-election last November, when his man, Dick Thornburgh, was upset
by a liberal Democrat, Harris Wofford. Others ascribe it to the unfortunate
incident in the lap of the Japanese prime minister in Tokyo in January.
Since then it has been open season on Mr Bush and not only for Democrats.
Pat Buchanan cut him up, Ross Perot bludgeoned him, the media turned against
him, even his own party treated him with disdain. His ace-in-the-hole, an
improving economy, has so far let him down.
In the face of all this, the president has seemed paralysed at worst,
indecisive at best, with no clue how to get out of his present troubles and
no idea what he would do with his second term. If the astronomical peak of
his popularity after the Gulf war was always illusory, he had better hope
that the depths to which he has now plunged, as low as any incumbent
president in an election year, are equally false.
But Mr Bush's travails are nothing compared with Mr Clinton's, which makes
his emergence this week as the unchallenged leader of a party united beyond
its wildest dreams and soaring away to 20-point plus leads in the overnight
polls all the more remarkable. Of course, July polls mean nothing in
November, as Mr Dukakis discovered four years ago, but they meant enough for
Mr Clinton in New York for him reasonably to claim the title of 'the
comeback kid'.
The list of his early tribulations is well known: pot-smoking, draft
dodging, free love - the trinity of excesses for anyone who grew up in the
1960s. His sometimes evasive responses raised doubts about his honesty, and
Americans have been taught to believe, in spite of manifold evidence to the
contrary, that their presidents, like George Washington, never dissemble.
Jimmy Carter was not the first, nor will he be the last, to run for the
office proclaiming: 'I'll never lie to you.'
But perhaps the greatest test of Clinton's endurance was about a month ago,
when he seemed to have fallen well behind Bush and Perot. One compilation of
polls taken in every state showed him leading in only two, evoking memories
of the disastrous Democratic campaigns of 1972, 1984 and 1988. At that time
his party had no realistic alternative and he looked a loser.
But he is tough and smart and had some answers. The first approach was to go
back to what he is best at, policy-oriented proposals. The economic
blueprint was reworked, borrowing a bit from Mr Tsongas on the investment
side, backing off earlier promises of a middle-class tax cut. Perfect it is
not, but it began to look good in comparison with the complete lack of
substance from Mr Perot and the broken-record utterances of Mr Bush.
The second was to acknowledge that the picture that the country had of the
man Clinton himself was sketchy. He has always maintained - citing the New
Hampshire primary, when he might well have been knocked out, and his own
popularity in Arkansas - that the more people got to know him the more they
accepted him.
But any candidate can meet half the populations of New Hampshire and
Arkansas in a couple of weeks. Extending that to the national level is a
different proposition. So, borrowing a bit from Mr Perot, he took to the
talk and celebrity shows, played his saxophone on late-night television and,
above all at this week's convention, began to talk more about himself and
the modest circumstances of his upbringing, long before Georgetown, Oxford
and Yale brought out his intellectual sophistication.
Yet still Mr Clinton could not have recovered to his present state of
relative grace without Ross Perot. Initially it was the acerbic Bush-Perot
war which made him look sober and responsible in comparison. But the real
current boost has come from the sudden unravelling of the Perot phenomenon.
Mr Clinton's surge is directly attributable to mass desertion from the
would-be-and-now-no-longer independent candidate.
The selection last week of Senator Al Gore as a running mate has proved a
temporary plus beyond expectations. He stands up well against Vice-President
Dan Quayle and provides Washington experience. The 'baby boomer' ticket
emphasises youth and compatibility, thus sustaining the case for the sort of
serious but non-radical change explicitly tailored to the tastes of
middle-class suburban America.
That both are border southerners has not attracted the criticism it might
from haughty yankees, nor from blacks, now comfortable with progressive
southern politicians. The Rev Jesse Jackson has endorsed the ticket, less
grudgingly than he might have. So, with the predictable exception of Jerry
Brown, have leaders of almost all the liberal Democratic constituencies.
Mario Cuomo, New York's quixotic governor and, along with the Rev Jackson,
guardian of the liberal flame, did Mr Clinton more than proud with a
roof-raising nominating speech.
One other ingredient matters. This is touted, with some justification, as
the year of the woman in US politics. Women have been mobilised by the
threat to reproductive choice, which seven out of 10 of them want to
preserve, and by outrage at the treatment of Anita Hill in the Clarence
Thomas hearings. On both scores Mr Clinton is with the majority and Mr Bush,
whose opposition to abortion is challenged inside his own party, is not. The
only doubt is whether, as in the past, women's rights fade as a major
determinant in the election itself.
So Mr Clinton, Mr Gore and the party, under the able leadership of Ron
Brown, came out of New York this week actually believing they can win in
November. Some might have liked Mr Perot to stick around for a while but
there is a genuine hunger for the battle and there will be no relaxation in
the campaign, as Mr Dukakis fatally did when he came out of Atlanta four
years ago with a comparable lead.
But this hopefulness, too, might be just another illusion in a political
year of mirrors. The convention was a confection like no other seen in
recent Democratic party history, efficiently run, flag-waving, nearly free
of dissent, a Busby Berkeley production. But it cannot disguise the fact
that, outside the converted in Madison Square Garden, Mr Clinton has a way
to go before he generates real enthusiasm in the land.
Moreover the Republicans lie in wait with a recent record of knowing how to
win elections, by fair means or foul. They will attack his lack of formal
foreign-policy experience, they will pick holes in his record as governor of
a still backward state and they will hammer away that he is, whatever his
cloak of fiscal pragmatism, in reality a traditional 'tax and spend'
Democrat. 'Bill Clinton is just another Fritz Mondale,' said one Republican
strategist this week.
They will seek to turn the generational argument on its head, contrasting
not only Mr Bush's experience with Mr Clinton's newness but also not sparing
the distaff side. The nation's grandmother, Barbara Bush, will be deployed
as the real embodiment of traditional family values as opposed to Hillary
Clinton, who is going to be labelled even more sharply as an overambitious
career woman contemptuous of the homemaker.
In this, and in other matters, it could get very dirty. Bill and Hillary
Clinton may have their defence mechanisms in order after all they have been
through so far, but the expectation is that they have seen nothing yet.
Now that this is a two-horse race again, standard electoral calculations may
be reapplied, and some benefit Mr Bush. His southern base looks more secure,
unless Mr Clinton and Mr Gore catch fire on their near home turf. Florida
and Texas should remain his with Mr Perot out of the way, though California
still looks shaky. In many other states west of the Mississippi, a plurality
of votes was achievable for Mr Clinton, but a majority is a much tougher
target.
The Bush campaign team needs reshuffling. It is not clear if the president,
after going fishing with James Baker this week, can lure his secretary of
state all the way back, as he did from the Treasury four years ago, but a
greater Baker input is inevitable. If he is as good as he was in 1988, it
will make a difference.
Finally, if Mr Clinton got a big bounce out of New York, Mr Bush can expect
something equivalent out of Houston next month. Mr Clinton did not give a
great acceptance speech, and Mr Bush is no Demosthenes either. The country
has flirted with a desire for change this year, Mr Clinton preaches the need
for it, and Mr Bush, though he talks of it, represents the status quo. It
all depends on how restless Americans are  - and there are still more than
100 days to go.
