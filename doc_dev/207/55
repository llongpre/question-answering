   Army bases across the country are running out
of tuition assistance funds for soldiers because of a $30 million
cut in the Army's education budget, according to college groups.
   The Army has put new restrictions on its tuition assistance,
which helped 188,000 soldiers and officers pay for college and
graduate school last year.
   Allan W. Ostar, president of the American Association of State
Colleges and Universities, said the cutbacks ``will have a direct
impact on thousands of individuals who want to take college
classes.''
   ``It will only hurt us all if individuals enlisted in the Army
do not have the opportunity to get the education they need,'' he
said.
   Frank Mensel, vice president of federal relations for the
American Association of Community and Junior Colleges, said the
Army has shifted ``education funds into recruiting.''
   Lt. Col. Greg Rixon, an Army spokesman, said the cutbacks were
triggered by Pentagon budget reductions that Congress and the
Reagan administration recently ordered to hold down the federal
deficit.
   The education budget was cut to $96.6 million. Originally, $35
million of the Army's $126 million education budget for fiscal 1988
was targeted for tuition assistance.
   Rixon said Army's personnel chief did have the option ``to move
money around'' among his education, civilian training and
recruiting accounts, ``but there was a relatively uniform reduction
across the board.''
   The college groups are lobbying to get at least $11 million
restored for tuition assistance. Even at that level, Ostar said,
``a number of programs would still come to a grinding halt, but at
least it is a more realistic and equitable approach to budget
reduction.'''
   The Army has requested a total education budget of $104 million
for fiscal 1989, which starts Oct. 1.
   Many soldiers pursue their college or graduate studies at state
campuses and community colleges near military bases.
   The Army once covered 90 percent of a G.I.'s cost of taking
classes. Rixon said it now pays 75 percent of tuition costs, up to
$80 a semester hour for undergraduate study and $165 for graduate
study.
   He said area commanders are being allowed to tailor the program
to meet their local needs.
   But the Army has ruled out providing tuition assistance for
soldiers who are entitled to Vietnam-era G.I. Bill benefits for
college, and it will not pay for a degree that is lower or lateral
to one a soldier already has.
   In general, subject to the area commanders' discretion, the Army
is not paying any tuition for lieutenant colonels or above, or
paying for graduate school for enlisted soldiers or warrant
officers, Rixon said.
