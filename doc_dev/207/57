  [Excerpt] The capital of Belarus is preparing for the 
arrival of Bill Clinton. The U.S. president will spend no more 
than six hours in Minsk. Clinton's visit on 15 January will 
include talks wih the heads of the parliament and government of 
Belarus, a speech to Belarusian young people in the Academy of 
Sciences, and a visit to Kuropaty, the site of mass shootings in 
the 1930's. 
  Belarusian Foreign Minister Petr Kravchenko said it is 
possible that several bilateral documents will be signed, 
including documents on protecting investments, on cooperation in 
science, and banking. The president's wife Hillary Clinton will 
visit medical establishments where Chernobyl victims are being 
treated. Petr Kravchenko said Bill Clinton's visit was an 
acknowledgement that Belarus is most logically and consistently 
conducting a policy of nuclear disarmanent. [passage omitted]
