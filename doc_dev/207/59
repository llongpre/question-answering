  [Text] Belarusian Foreign Minister Petr Kravchenko believes 
that during his visit to Belarus, U.S. President Bill Clinton 
will announce new funds or programs to sustain business and 
economic reforms in Belarus. The Belarusian Foreign Minister 
made the statement at a news conference in Minsk Wednesday. 
  Bill Clinton is to meet Stanislav Shushkevich and Vyacheslav 
Kebich in Minsk January 15, the minister told reporters. 
  Clinton will also speak at the National Academy of Sciences 
and will place flowers to the Monument of Victory of the Soviet 
people in the Great Patriotic War. 
  Kravchenko has confirmed the information which says that the 
U.S. President intended to meet representatives of Democratic 
parties and movements, for example, the leader of the Belarusian 
People's Front Zenon Poznyak. 
  The U.S. president's wife, Hillary Clinton intends to see 
some hospitals in Minsk where people who suffered the aftermath 
of the Chernobyl disaster undergo medical treatment.
