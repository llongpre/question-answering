The US Senate has voted unanimously to hold hearings on the Whitewater
affair, but has left to future negotiation their date and the ground they
will cover.
The compromise, agreed on Thursday night, represents qualified victories for
Republicans who have been demanding hearings and Democrats who have resisted
them.
No grants of immunity from prosecution will be given to those summoned to be
questioned.
President Bill Clinton seemed resigned to the fact that there would be a
congressional forum but again said it would be found not to be worth the
expense.
The general White House mood is more upbeat than it was 10 days ago, with
the president and Mr Hillary Clinton embarked on a heavy round of public
appearances to push the administration's domestic agenda. One senior
official said of Whitewater: 'We've moved from crisis management to problem
management.'
The Senate resolution also gives Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel,
time to conduct his inquiry into whether government officials have conspired
to obstruct federal investigations of the failed Arkansas savings and loan
entity at the centre of the first family's land and financial dealings, in
their home state in the 1980s.
Still unresolved by the Senate action are possible hearings by the House
banking committee, tentatively scheduled for sometime late next week.
Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, senior Republican on the committee, continues
to insist that they be held, but Mr Fiske is unhappy with them and the
Democratic leaders in the House are pressing for a delay.
Mr Fiske's federal grand jury took testimony on Thursday from two senior
White House members, Mr Bernard Nussbaum, former legal counsel, and Mr
Harold Ickes, the presidential counsellor mainly involved with healthcare.
An additional subpoena has been served on Mr George Stephanopoulos, a close
adviser to the president. This brings to 11 the number of White House and
Treasury officials called to testify before the grand jury.
Meanwhile, the New York Times yesterday said that Mrs Clinton had made as
much as Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 66,934) on the commodities market in
1978-1979, thus transforming the Clinton family finances.
She was advised in her investments, according to the article, by Mr James
Blair, a prominent Arkansas lawyer and an investor long close to the
Clintons. Mr Blair's principal legal client was Tyson's Food, the chicken
producer and big Arkansas company.
The president said yesterday that his wife's investment was 'perfectly
independent and perfectly legal', and that taxes had been paid on the money
made. The rest of the article, he added, was 'innuendo, unsupported
allegation.'
Mr Blair responded by saying it was ridiculous for the Clintons to have to
'weed their friends out and say they can only have friends who are sweeping
the streets.'
