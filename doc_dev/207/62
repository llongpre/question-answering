AT NOON today Mr Bill Clinton becomes the 42nd president of the US.
Yesterday he spent a few quiet moments at the grave of the man who inspired
him to take up a political career, President John F. Kennedy.
Mr Clinton, his wife Hillary and about 20 members of the Kennedy clan placed
white roses on the graves of the two assassinated Kennedy brothers. He read
the inscriptions on their tombstones, but said nothing.
He hardly needed to, because it is the stuff of legend (and captured on
film) how, just four months before Kennedy was killed in Dallas in 1963, the
gangly 17-year-old youth from Arkansas, as a member of the American Legion's
Boys Nation, shook hands with the president at the White House.
There is an additional symbolism to the tribute. At 46, Mr Clinton is three
years older than JFK when he assumed office, yet both represent the ascent
of a younger generation of Americans to the seat of power. It is likely Mr
Clinton will again invoke the example and memory of his idol when he gives
his inauguration speech today.
Most of Mr Clinton's last full day as a president-elect had a youthful
theme. He took his customary morning jog and later was to attend a couple of
galas mostly for the young. He told an older lunchtime group, the governors
of the 50 states, that they ran 'our laboratories of democracy' and he would
need them to tell him as president what he was doing right - and wrong.
Elsewhere serious business was afoot, with new bombing raids over northern
Iraq and an apparent Iraqi offer of conciliation.
But there was good news from Capitol Hill. Assorted Senate committees
unanimously approved the nominations of six of his would-be cabinet,
including Mr Warren Christopher as secretary of state and Mr Mickey Kantor
as US trade representative. The full Senate may confirm some nominations
this afternoon.
The judiciary committee heard an apology from Ms Zoe Baird, the
attorney-general designate, for having employed two illegal aliens. Its
senior Republican, Mr Orrin Hatch of Utah, said the incident was no
disqualification to her serving as head of the Justice Department.
Meanwhile a dozen senior State Department appointments were announced and as
many as 100 more across the government promised for this week, thus ensuring
that not all desks in the corridors of power would be empty this afternoon.
