DOUBTS about Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early front-runner for
the Democratic party's nomination for the US presidency, are surfacing among
party leaders in Congress.
In the wake of adultery allegations against Mr Clinton, Mr Dick Gephardt,
majority leader in the House of Representatives, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen
of Texas, the party's vice-presidential candidate in 1988, are reported to
be considering entering the campaign if further allegations are made against
Mr Clinton.
Mr George Mitchell, majority leader in the Senate, said on television
yesterday a 'substantial' number of senators had urged him to run. But he
added: 'I do not intend to be a candidate.'
Senator Mitchell said Mr Clinton's chances of winning the Democratic
nomination had been 'hurt' by the charges of marital infidelity which first
surfaced three weeks ago in a supermarket magazine. The tabloid paid the
woman who made the charges, a former Arkansas state employee and cabaret
singer, and the story was repeated in the national press.
Mr Clinton admitted he had been unfaithful to his wife Hillary, a fellow
Yale law graduate, during their 16-year marriage. But he denied the specific
allegations in a nationwide television interview a week ago and called on
the press to show restraint.
Reporters covering the campaign have since been exhorted to 'stick to the
issues' - a tactic supposedly aimed at avoiding a repeat of the trivia-laden
1988 campaign, but one which in fact helps Mr Clinton, who spews out
statistics and five-point plans without missing a beat.
Congressional Democrats, having watched the party lose five of the last six
presidential elections, have been unnerved by the charges. They believe
that, even if Mr Clinton survives the present fracas in the primaries, he
would face a torrid contest against President George Bush's Republicans in
November's presidential elections.
Meanwhile, on the Republican side, the latest CNN/Time magazine poll shows
Mr Bush's popularity slipping nationwide as well as in the state of New
Hampshire, site of the first important primary election for both parties.
The president's approval rating stands at 44 per cent, half the level after
the Gulf war. In New Hampshire, he stands at 52 per cent, with the number of
undecided Republican voters rising.
