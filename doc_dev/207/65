<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Now in High Spirits for </F>
Economic Revival"; from Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 27 January 
Morning Edition] 
  [Text] The annual policy speech the U.S. President makes 
to Congress at the beginning of the year is called "state of the 
union address" in English. Most of the one hour-odd speech 
given by President Bill Clinton on the evening of 25 January 
(morning of 26 January Japan time) was devoted to the economy, 
health care reform, education, welfare, and other domestic 
issues. It was literally a speech worthy of the term "state of 
the union address." 
  It was a speech devoid of the pretentious rhetoric 
characteristic of most presidential addresses, and was a piece 
of pragmatic discourse focusing on policy. While some say it 
was not a speech becoming the president of a major power, 
considering Clinton's position as the President of a United 
States with declining power in the post-Cold War world, which is 
exerting desperate efforts toward economic revival, his speech 
was straightforward and made a favorable impression. 
  One year ago, when the first baby boomer president took 
office, few, even inside the Democratic Party, believed that 
Clinton's economic policies would be successful. However, as 
Japan and the nations on the European continent moan under an 
economic recession, the U.S. economy is now definitely on its 
way to recovery. 
  One can sense confidence in his policy direction and his own 
leadership from the President's speech, which puts across the 
optimistic atmosphere that has come back to U.S. society after a 
long time. 
  The president used the word "renewal" many times. Although 
proud of the achievements in the past year, he said: "We know 
and acknowledge that our work has just begun. There is more to 
be done." 
  Although Clinton is in a tight spot over the appointment of 
a 
defense secretary, and scandals have created controversies in 
the mass media, his popularity rating has recovered, and his 
administration is basically stable. 
  Clinton plans to carry on with administrative and fiscal 
reforms, and reduce federal government personnel by 252,200 in 
five years. He stressed that "we will work hard for the American 
people, who pay our salaries." 
  The President strongly advocated the reform of the health 
care system, where "58 million Americans have no coverage at 
all." In this health care reform, of which Mrs. Hillary Clinton 
is in charge, the president spoke of "the courage to face up to 
the special interests obstructing the reform." 
  Lights did not go off in the White House until the late 
hours 
for days on end. Meetings were held with the President even 
late at night or early in the morning. Expensive restaurants in 
the neighborhood complained that they were out of business 
because the White House staff never came out to eat. 
  Foreign affairs will be the task for the hardworking 
President from now on. "There are some who argue that with the 
end of the Cold War, the United States should turn its back on 
the rest of the world," but the President asserted that "we will 
not stop our contributions to the world." He expressed the 
intention to continue to exercise leadership in building a new 
world order. 
  The word "Japan" did not appear at all in the speech. 
However, President Clinton has to take Japan into 
consideration, whether as a partner or as a competitor, in many 
of the things he wants to do from now on. 
  In that sense, one cannot help being apprehensive about how 
the United States will behave at the Japan-U.S. summit in 
February, which will discuss the economic framework talks.
