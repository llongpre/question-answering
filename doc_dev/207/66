<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Clinton's Public Relations </F>
Machine Is Working Overtime"] 
  [Text] The White House's "spin patrol" [last two words in 
English] had two busy days in Detroit. In this case "spinning" 
has nothing to do with purring contentedly before the open fire, 
but everything to do with a public relations (PR) machine which 
is overwhelming the press with one-sided information. In this 
case about the president's economic plans. 
  The occasion was the two day G-7 meeting on employment. At 
the invitation of President Clinton, the finance, trade and 
labor ministers from the seven richest countries had gone to 
"Motown" to meditate openly and behind closed doors about 
fighting unemployment. 
  This international setpiece was intended to distract 
attention from Clinton's problems in Washington. There he is 
being pursued by the call for more openness and hearings in the 
Whitewater affair. In Detroit and during other events in the 
country he could finally concentrate on his policies again. For 
a brief moment he was out of the snake pit. 
  To ensure that the media understood that too, Clinton's PR 
machine provided the exclamation points. The U.S. treasury 
secretary called Clinton's ideas "amazing." The commerce 
secretary said he found them "exciting." The top economic 
advisor spoke of "remarkable" plans. Vice President Al Gore 
called the conference "an important turning point in the postwar 
dialogue between the United States and other industrialized 
countries." 
  The rather less exuberant comment by the British 
representative that he had been to "other dull meetings like 
this one" could not temper U.S. enthusiasm. The message was 
intended for the U.S. public and not for foreigners who, after 
all, do not have votes. 
  But things went wrong. Clinton's speech on Monday [14 March] 
was to have sent out the signal to the masses that the President 
is keeping an eye on the interests of the average worker and 
unemployed person, despite healthy economic growth. On Monday 
morning that seemed to still be working, but the fun was spoiled 
a little later by Webster Hubbell. Hubbell is a friend of the 
Clintons and a former colleague of Hillary Clinton. On Monday 
he resigned as a highly placed member of staff at the justice 
department. Hubbell is suspected of charging excessively high, 
unjustified bills to his clients while working as a lawyer in 
Arkansas. 
  So Clinton's comments took a back seat. Once again the 
President was plagued by questions about his cabinet, scandals, 
ethics and the departure of his friends from Washington. A week 
earlier Bernard Nussbaum, the top lawyer in the White House and 
another friend of the Clintons, had resigned because of 
Whitewater. In the morning in Detroit Clinton was still proud of 
his policies, in the afternoon in Boston he was back at the 
beginning. 
  And what about the conference itself? The participants 
called it a success, of course. They would "take the comments 
with them" to the G-7 summit in Naples this summer. However, 
the ministers reached no conclusions and announced no moves. 
  In any case the participants have learned one thing. They 
have seen with their own eyes what happens in a city plagued by 
11 percent unemployment with virtually no social safety net. 
Their limousines, escorted by a noisy police escort, shot past 
boarded up houses along dilapidated streets. The Detroit-based 
car industry may have risen from its slump, but it is robots and 
cheap labor elsewhere which does the work.
