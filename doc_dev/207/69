   Nearly two-thirds of American families of
Asian and the Pacific Islands background have more than two people
holding jobs, well above the national average, the Census Bureau
reports.
   Leading are Americans of Tongan descent, with 71.6 percent of
families reporting multiple workers.
   But Filipinos were close behind with 71.4 percent, the Bureau
reported in releasing final Asian and Pacific Islander statistics
from the 1980 census.
   Overall, 63.3 percent of Asian families and 57.6 percent of
those from the Pacific islands had multiple workers.
   By comparison, 54.2 percent of all families in the United States
have multiple workers.
   While Tongans had the most workers, their median family income
of $16,717 lagged behind the national average of $19,917 at the
time of the count.
   Filipinos, on the other hand, reported median family income of
$23,687, third among Asian and Pacific ethnic groups.
   Tops in family income were the Japanese at $27,354, followed by
Indians with $24,993.
   Koreans were most likely to be self-employed at 11.9 percent,
well ahead of the 7.9 percent for Japanese. For the nation as a
whole, 6.8 percent of people are self-employed.
   Cambodians were most likely to be foreign born, at 93.9 percent,
followed by 93.7 percent of Laotians in this country. Only 6.2
percent of the overall population is foreign born.
   In terms of education, Pakistanis led with 58.4 percent being
college graduates. Overall, 32.9 percent of Asians and Pacific
Islanders in this country have college degrees, about double the
16.2 percent for the nation as a whole.
   The study covers all U.S. residents reporting their descent from
Asia or the islands of the Pacific Ocean, regardless of how long
they had been in this country.
