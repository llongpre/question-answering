  [Text] Provided no changes are made in the schedule of 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Belarus, the President 
will fly to Minsk on 15 January along with his wife Hillary and 
daughter Chelsea. Guests are always shown what is best, 
although this will not be an easy task given the fact that the 
Clintons' visit will last only a couple of hours. As is known, 
Hillary and Chelsea Clinton have plans of their own during the 
visit. The President's daughter will attend a demonstration at 
the State Choreography College, while his wife will visit the 
Opera and Ballet Theater. She will be accompanied by our 
Republic's first ladies -- Irina Shushkevich and Alena Kebich. 
They will exchange souvenirs at the opera, after which Hillary 
Clinton will meet with artists.
