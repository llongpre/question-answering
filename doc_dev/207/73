<HL> Letters to the Editor: College Education's Value </HL>

<TEXT>
   In his Sept. 15 letter to the editor, Nathan Crow argues that your article on the value of college degrees ("Benefit of B.A. 
Is Greater Than Ever," Aug. 17) might be flawed because it fails to take into account the fact that college graduates might differ in significant respects from non-graduates. 
He argues that "most of the market value of college would prove illusory" if a proper study is conducted, comparing similar groups of "degreed and non-degreed individuals." 

   Woodrow Hughes and I recently conducted just such a study ("Social Internal Rates of Return to College Education in the United States: 1969, 1974, 1978 and 1982," University of South Carolina). 
We employed data from a large sample of college and high-school graduates, and conducted statistical analyses that come close to achieving the comparison suggested by Mr. Crow. 
Our results suggest that the internal rate of return to college has decreased from more than 9% in 1969 to about 8% in 1974 and to 6% in 1978. 
The rate increased, however, to almost 7% by 1982. 
Work by Walter W. McMahon of the University of Illinois, using Bureau of the Census data, suggests that the returns to college might have increased even further by 1986, since the ratio of mean earnings of college graduates to high-school graduates has increased from 1982 to 1986 (from 1.40 to 1.51 for ages 25-34, and from 1.42 to 1.57 for ages 35-44). 

   Moreover, our analysis indicates that rates of return to graduates who attended college on a part-time basis (working at least part time) were considerably higher, perhaps as high as 10% in 1982, because as students they had much lower forgone earnings than full-time students. 
Our results appear to be quite consistent with those in your Aug. 17 article.
