PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas are increasingly
taking aim at each other, rather than their respective party challengers.
In speeches on Thursday in Pennsylvania, which holds the next primary on
April 28, the president recycled an old proposal for increased student
loans.
Mr Clinton, front-runner for the Democratic nomination to oppose him in
November's election, countered that the Bush plan was politically cynical,
since the administration had previously done its best to cut student loan
programmes and was now borrowing from one of his own main education policy
positions.
Mr Lamar Alexander, secretary of education, tartly observed that 'if
Governor Clinton thinks it's a good idea, that's terrific. But his friends
in Congress don't think it's a good idea. Maybe he should talk to them.'
However, the main thrust of the Democrat's speech, given to the Wharton
School of Business, was to attack the president for mismanagement of the
economy and to present his own plans for the future. He gave a similar
speech on foreign policy in New York two weeks ago.
Mr Clinton cited the case of Mr Michael Milken, the convicted junk bond
dealer (and, incidentally, a Wharton graduate), as an example of where the
economic philosophy of the 1980s had gone wrong. 'We must bring an end to
this something-for-nothing ethic,' he said.
His blueprint, drawing together several previously stated positions,
includes a new Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) tax credit for new investments;
making permanent the existing research and development tax credit, now
costing about Dollars 1bn a year; and a new 'enterprise tax cut' worth
Dollars 200m a year.
He would also establish what he called a 'future budget' to increase
investment in the country's social and physical infrastructure, running from
schools to roads and bridges. He promised to focus on the critical issue of
converting defence programmes into civilian output and to put more resources
into education and training.
This would be broadly financed by cuts in military spending, a reduction in
administrative outlays, and a determined effort in future to ensure that
costs stayed below the rate of inflation.
'We spend a quarter of what our competitors do on training programmes for
our workers,' Mr Clinton said. 'Last year Germany and Japan had productivity
growth rates several times ours because they educate their people better and
they organise their economies to change better than we do.'
The two speeches mark the end of what had been a lull in the campaign, with
Mr Clinton sidelined by an overworked voicebox and Mr Bush mostly attacking
the Democratic-controlled Congress.
The president's latest pitch is that he, not Mr Clinton, is the real
architect of change, though his critics have observed that many of his
recent policy proposals, including that on student loans, have been old
ideas dressed up differently.
But Mr Bush has less of a hill to climb in establishing his credentials than
does Mr Clinton, who needs to put the 'character' questions behind him and
clearly differentiate his policies from those of the president.
This extends even to what the two men eat. Yesterday, Mr Clinton, in a
Philadelphia street market, held up a stick of broccoli, the president's
least favourite vegetable, and said he liked it. The impact of this
staggering expression of preference has yet to be recorded in the polls.
