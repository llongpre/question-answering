SPENDING has become a dirty word in Washington. Investment, however, carries
far more positive connotations, especially for a new administration
convinced that one of the worst US structural defects is the investment gap,
as measured against the record of its main foreign competitors.
Matched against that, the administration has sought to come up with credible
attempts to cut spending. The principal targets outlined yesterday are
four-year savings of Dollars 91bn on 'entitlements' (social programmes),
Dollars 76bn on defence and about Dollars 50bn on other discretionary
budgetary items.
President Bill Clinton's proposals divide investment into the short term, to
help create an additional 500,000 permanent and temporary jobs, and the
longer haul, intended to ensure that the human capital in society gets its
due.
Just over Dollars 16bn in extra spending is planned for the current year,
mostly on the public works side. Included, for example, are an extra Dollars
3bn in road building and another Dollars 1bn on other forms of transport,
Dollars 2.5bn in block grants to local communities, Dollars 1bn in summer
youth employment programmes, Dollars 3bn in federal loan authority, Dollars
300m for the mass immunisation programme, and Dollars 845m for waste water
clean-up.
All these proposals build on existing programmes and, according to senior
officials, fall within the discretionary spending totals for the budget of
the current fiscal year, ending in September.
The four-year Dollars 160bn investment plan is much more ambitious in scope
and in its potential demands on the public purse, assuming it meets
congressional approval.
Some Dollars 48bn is earmarked for infrastructural development, including
Dollars 17bn on technology, involving more funding for the National Science
Foundation and assorted government research and development programmes,
Dollars 9.6bn for housing and community initiatives such as enterprise
zones, Dollars 8.4bn on transport, embracing high speed rail and new
investments in mass transit, and Dollars 8bn on the environment.
What is known as 'lifelong learning' is to get Dollars 37.8bn over the four
years, with principal sums going to education reform, worker training, Mr
Clinton's youth national service programmes and continued and full funding
of the Head Start programme for disadvantaged children.
Another Dollars 25bn is destined for 'rewarding work', mostly concerning the
government safety net such as the earned income tax credit and extended
unemployment compensation, but also including extra funds to combat crime.
A further Dollars 26bn is planned for expansion of existing health care
programmes, though this sum is separate from whatever recommendations emerge
from the task force on health care reforms being chaired by Mrs Hillary
Clinton.
Finally, Dollars 24bn is targeted for investment incentives that increase
productivity and jobs. Most of this sum is made up of assorted capital gains
tax relief, and extended investment tax credits.
Many of the above causes are dear to Democrat hearts, though the great
emphasis on private sector investment more reflects President Clinton's
thinking. However, there must be a heavy probability that the mix of
investment plans proposed by the administration will change as Congress goes
to work.
One of the most controversial measures is a proposal to cancel the ambitious
Freedom space station to clear the way for a smaller and cheaper station.
Freedom was first proposed 10 years ago as an Dollars 8bn project; its cost
is now estimated at Dollars 30bn, but many critics charge that its real
lifetime cost could be as much as Dollars 180bn. While many scientists
believe the station has little scientific use, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration has spread the project's construction work around a
great many congressional districts.
Because of termination costs, Mr Clinton will save little money in the short
term, but could achieve significant savings in the longer term.
