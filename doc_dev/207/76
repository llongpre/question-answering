  [Text] Washington, February 1 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton today named Boston lawyer Deval Patrick to be 
deputy attorney general in charge of the civil rights division 
of the U.S. Justice Department. 
  Patrick, 37 and black, is a Harvard Law School graduate and 
a 
partner of the Boston firm Hill and Barlow. The Chicago native 
grew up in a poor and segregated neighborhood. 
  He once worked at the NAACP (National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People) legal defense and education fund 
on cases concerning voting rights and death penalty matters in 
the south. 
  Patrick's nomination filled a spot left vacant for months 
after the withdrawal of Lani Guinier, Clinton's first choice for 
the post. 
  Clinton abruptly withdrew Guinier's nomination after drawing 
criticism from some people in June, saying that he was surprised 
by the liberal bent to some of her writings on racial politics. 
The post has been vacant since Clinton took office on January 
20, 1993. 
  Wasting no time, conservatives called Patrick "a stealth 
Guinier." 
  But, "he understands the law is a tool to help real people 
with real problems," Clinton said in today's Oval Office 
announcement, flanked by Attorney General Janet Reno and Vice 
President Al Gore. 
  The Justice Department's civil rights division has protected 
civil liberties for "tens of millions of Americans," but there 
is still much more to be done, the U.S. President said.
