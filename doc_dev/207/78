A light aircraft, with its engine switched off, penetrated high-security air
space and crashed on a White House lawn early yesterday. It slid against the
mansion, killing the pilot. President Bill Clinton, his family and staff
were unharmed, Reuter reports from Washington.
Security agencies were trying to determine whether they were dealing with a
bizarre accident or a kamikaze-style attack. The pilot was tentatively
identified as a man from the neighbouring state of Maryland. Officials were
pursuing reports he had stolen the aircraft from a Maryland air club and
were checking reports that he had a history of mental illness.
The president, Mrs Hillary Clinton and their daughter Chelsea were asleep a
few hundred yards away across Pennsylvania Avenue in Blair House, a guest
residence.
The aeroplane swooped from the direction of the Washington Monument, passed
over a high, steel-rail fence and ploughed into the White House back lawn at
about 2am local time.
There were no reports that White House security forces had fired at the
aircraft.
The US secret service and the US army are believed to have installed
anti-aircraft weapons on the mansion and a next-door building after a
similar airborne intrusion in 1974.
