   To his credit, Bill Clinton made it through the Michigan
primary without throwing over his commitment to free trade.
It'd have been easy to see how he might have decided to trim
on the trade issue. Jerry Brown, a free-trade advocate when
Governor of the nation-sized state that faces the Pacific
Rim, traded growth for votes in Michigan without blinking.
That got him 26% of the vote.
   Governor Clinton thus emerges from the domestic-content
state with his free-trade credentials essentially intact. So
far, Bill Clinton has mostly run up the score in the
Democratic primaries by bellowing class resentments at the
"Roseanne" crowd. But it's intriguing and encouraging that
even in Michigan he left the protectionist card to Mr. Brown.
A lot of different subjects and rhetoric are going to flow
over the falls between now and November, but when it's over,
trade is a crucial issue that the next President has to get
right. The consequences of getting it wrong, at this
important turning point in history, are enormous.

   Should Mr. Clinton secure the Democratic nomination, we'd
presumably have two candidates running for the presidency who
have stated commitments to the principle of an open world
economy. That's fine, but in America's recent political
history, the siren song of protectionism always seems to be
lurking around the next corner. We guess this means that the
politicians are invariably going to be several steps behind
the American voter.
   The political names that come to mind in surveying the
advocates of protectionism are Gephardt, Dole, Dukakis,
Wofford, Harkin, Kerrey, Buchanan and Brown. Excepting
Wofford, who beat a Bush stand-in who loyally stood for next
to nothing, all came up losers when playing the trade card.
   Meanwhile, President Bush, who reached a free-trade
agreement with Canada and is pushing one with Mexico, is
winning. Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, counts as one of his close
advisers Robert Reich of Harvard, who understands quite well
the international side of the new global economy. Mr. Reich
is indeed right that what we need are not American-based
firms but high-skill jobs for more Americans.
   Yet somehow even candidates with these principles feel a
need to bow to their losing protectionist opponents.
President Bush waffled some on trade this past week, for
instance, by running campaign commercials publicizing Pat
Buchanan's ownership of a Mercedes. No doubt the Bush
campaign staff found irresistible the chance to take a hard
shot at someone who'd called them virtually a subsidiary of
Japan Inc. But the ad implicitly put the Bush campaign in the
BuyAmerican camp, creating potential for future confusions
over the President's stance.
   Mr. Clinton, for his part, has on occasion had praise for
the trade law's draconian Section 301 provision, which
triggers retaliation against foreigners for alleged unfair
trade practices, which some of his supporters find puzzling.
   A political argument can be made for both Messrs. Clinton
and Bush getting unambiguously behind free trade.
   In Mr. Clinton's case, it would simply look incongruous
for an obviously intelligent and well-educated 46-year-old to
come on like some Buchananized mossback. The members of Bill
and Hillary Clinton's generation know there is a world of
rapidly developing and integrating economies out there --
Korea, Mexico, Turkey, Hungary, Taiwan and inevitably Russia
and China. The national electorate is probably more
interested in voting for a President with a modern world view
than another insular Southern populist. We suspect Governor
Clinton can make the adjustment.
   Unless President Bush captures the free-trade issue first.
They say Mr. Bush doesn't believe in anything much. But a
truly liberal trading system is an exception. He believes in
it deeply, and that undoubtedly would come through if he
moved the issue to the center of his campaign rhetoric, as
well as his administration's interpretations of the Canadian
agreement and the antitrust implications of Japanese
keiretsu.
   Ultimately, a candidate's stand on trade reflects more
than politics. There is the matter of leadership, of having
the skills to see with one's own eyes what is going on in the
world and recognizing America's role in that world. Pat
Buchanan and Jerry Brown are losers because they are ranting
about foreign threats at the very time when Japan's economy
is stumbling badly and when Germany is struggling with
integrating the formerly communist east. If those two world
economic locomotives slow, the U.S. President better be
focused on something larger and more important than the
"domestic content" of Hondas.
