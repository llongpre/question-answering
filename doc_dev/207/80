<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Administration Which Turns Its </F>
Attention More Toward Domestic Affairs"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has entered the 
second year since his inauguration, gave his State of the Union 
address in Congress on 25 January. A major portion of his 
address dealt with domestic issues and made little reference to 
diplomatic issues. President Clinton, who became President by 
advocating his plan "to rebuild America," originally indicated 
that he planned to place emphasis on domestic affairs. On top 
of this, off-year elections are to be held this coming fall. As 
a result, he has apparently made it clearer that he intends to 
turn his attention more toward internal affairs. 
  The President's State of the Union address includes an 
outline of the U.S. Government's domestic and diplomatic 
policies over the coming year. Particularly since this was 
Clinton's first such address, it has attracted the world's 
attention. However, it could not avoid being rated as 
unimpressive due to its domestic affairs-oriented content. 
  In his address, the President praised himself for "making a 
good start" concerning his first year at running the government. 
According to research by a periodical specializing in 
Congressional affairs, over 84 percent of the bills reaching 
Congress during Clinton's first year as President were passed. 
Since the periodical began such research in the early 1950's, 
this figure ranks third after former Presidents Dwight D. 
Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson. It shows Clinton's 
extraordinary leadership over Congressional steering. 
  When Clinton was first inaugurated, critics charged that his 
policies lacked focus and were inconsistent. However, 
supporters praised his uncompromising realism. Generally, 
experts give high ratings to Clinton for his accomplishments 
during his first year as President. His declined support rating 
has resurged to the 60-percent level he enjoyed at the time of 
his inauguration. 
  Recovery of the U.S. economy has been the greatest 
contributing factor in Clinton's regaining his popularity. 
Whether the President can also make dazzling achievements 
during his second year depends on whether he can ride on the 
favorable winds of the time. 
  As prime priority policy goals for his second year, the 
President presented three pillars: fight against crime, health 
care system reform, and welfare system reform. Concerning the 
fight against crime which is of the greatest interest to the 
American people, Clinton has already sent a comprehensive crime 
prevention bill to Congress that includes recruiting 100,000 
more policemen. As part of the crime prevention plan, a law on 
hand gun control was enacted last year. It is hoped that 
greater gun control will be promoted, such as introducing a 
system requiring gun licenses. 
  Concerning health care system reform which aims at having 
every American covered under health insurance, President Clinton 
hopes that Congress will pass the bill worked out under the 
leadership of Hillary Clinton, the First Lady. Tentatively, the 
focus of attention will be on the contest between this bill and 
a number of other bills proposed by some Congressmen which 
Congress is currently examining. 
  The President has decided to continue with his plan to give 
priority to problems of the people and boldly deal with social 
issues which tend to be ignored. 
  The greatest task facing President Clinton is that of 
solidifying his foundation for reelection by having his party 
win in the off-year elections. The President hopes to form a 
majority that encompasses a broad range of the population by 
winning over the middle class in addition to traditional 
Democratic supporters. He will need to patch up relations with 
leaders of the Democratic Party and labor unions with whom he 
clashed regarding ratification of NAFTA. He also needs to 
quickly regain public confidence that has been lost due to 
consecutive scandals involving women and the Whitewater scandal. 
  Regarding diplomatic affairs, a task has emerged for the 
President to reconstruct his team in charge of diplomacy and 
national security, as this team has been considered a weak point 
in the Clinton administration. Bobby Inman, who at first agreed 
to succeed Les Aspin as secretary of defense after the latter 
announced his resignation, decided not to accept his nomination. 
Finally, William J. Perry, deputy secretary of defense, was 
just promoted to fill the post. There has also been deep-rooted 
criticism against Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
Anthony Lake, assistant to the President for national security 
affairs. 
  In his State of the Union address, President Clinton 
indicated U.S. leadership is essential to global stability. For 
the United States to exercise its leadership without repeating 
the mistakes it has made in Somalia, Haiti, and former 
Yugoslavia, it is indeed necessary to promptly form a strong 
team to handle diplomacy and national security.
