Recruits College Graduates To Replenish Police, Which Are of 
Poor Quality and Short-Handed"] 
  [Text] At present, graduates from the public security 
schools and colleges in the mainland can hardly meet the needs 
of the police service in all localities. The poor quality of 
the police force, which is also short-handed, has become one of 
the major reasons for the failure to effectively contain crime. 
This year, the public security departments of Beijing and some 
other big cities, for the first time, will recruit police 
officers openly in society, and this will meet with a positive 
response from graduates of colleges and secondary vocational 
schools. 
  At a recent job orientation meeting for 1994 college and 
secondary vocational school graduates in Beijing, the Beijing 
Municipal Public Security Bureau, for the first time, openly 
recruited a number of policemen and policewomen from among 
applicants in society. Beyond many people's expectations, many 
college graduates showed interest in joining the police force. 
At the meeting, some 2,500 college and secondary vocational 
school graduates made inquiries, and 870 people -- including 440 
female college students -- filled in forms to show their 
interest. 
  The practice of the police in Beijing showed that they were 
in need of competent personnel, and police in all parts of the 
country also face the same situation. According to statistics, 
the proportion of policemen and public security personnel to the 
national population now is greatly lower than in other 
countries. In particular, a large part of the police force in 
China is the armed police force, responsible for domestic 
security, and the proportion of the police force directly used 
to manage public order and check crimes is even smaller. In 
addition, the police force is prominently short of officers who 
know foreign languages and have mastered modern skills in police 
work. 
  In Beijing, the number of policemen and the proportion of 
the 
police troops to the local population are slightly higher than 
in other provinces and municipalities, but the police force in 
Beijing shoulders much heavier tasks than its counterparts in 
other localities. They not only have to maintain law and order 
in the capital and guarantee the security of major conferences, 
important visitors, and large cultural and sports events, but 
also have to guarantee the safety of foreign visitors. The 
image of the police in Beijing also reflects, to a certain 
degree, the image of the nation. Therefore, in addition to 
replenishing the police force in Beijing, the overall quality of 
the police force there also must be enhanced so that it can 
match Beijing's status. 
  According to statistics, however, only 14 percent of the 
policemen and policewomen in Beijing are college or secondary 
vocational school graduates, and the percentage is six points 
lower then the national average. As Beijing now is becoming a 
modern international metropolis, this quality of the police 
force often causes embarrassment to the capital city. When some 
foreigners want to seek help from policemen, this may embarrass 
most policemen, who even do not know the simplest English words. 
In addition, the police force now still cannot proficiently 
operate the modern communications system, make scientific 
arrangements, and carry out effective management. A modern 
metropolis needs a high-quality guardian. 
  The responsible officials of the Public Security Ministry 
also are clearly aware of the hidden crisis in the quality of 
the police force. Zhu Chunlin, deputy director of the Political 
Department of the Public Security Ministry, said that it is 
necessary to enhance and improve the overall educational 
background and structure of the public security personnel and 
police officers. In particular, in order to modernize the means 
of public security, it is urgently necessary to recruit people 
who have received better education. The proportion of college 
graduates in the police force, especially that in Beijing, will 
be getting larger. The general educational condition of the 
police also will be raised. 
  At present, however, the public security schools in all 
parts 
of the country still cannot provide sufficient graduates to meet 
the needs of the police department. On the other hand, the 
educational background of the policemen and policewomen 
recruited openly in society remains at a comparatively low 
level, and the recruits must first receive a certain amount of 
training. Therefore, police recruitment must be linked with the 
competitive job market in order to attract more competent 
personnel, and should be opened to college graduates first. 
However, it is still unknown how many college students will 
have an interest in joining the police force. 
  This time, the job orientation meeting for the college 
graduates in Beijing brought unexpected gratification to the 
police in Mainland China. Applicants on that occasion included 
college graduates majoring in 63 branches of learning, including 
law, Chinese language, computer science, and foreign languages. 
There also were doctorate candidates, postgraduate students for 
master's degree courses, and college graduates holding double 
bachelor degrees. As the police recruitment action also was 
opened to females, this attracted a large number of female 
college students.
