   WASHINGTON -- High school and college graduates are more
heavily concentrated in the West than elsewhere in the U.S.,
according to a Census Bureau report.
   But the country's single greatest concentration of college
graduates lives in the Washington, D.C., area, the study
said.

   Eighty-one percent of all adults -- age 25 and older --
residing in the West have completed high school, compared
with 73% of those in the South. In the Northeast and Midwest,
the figures were 78% and 79%, respectively.
   The survey, which wasn't part of the 1990 decennial
census, included data gathered through 1989.
   Utah and Washington State had the highest proportion of
high school graduates, 88%, followed by Alaska, Wyoming,
Minnesota, Nevada and Oregon. Alabama had the lowest
percentage, 63%, with Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas,
Mississippi and West Virginia all falling near the bottom.
   The metropolitan area with the highest ratio of high
school graduates among its age 25 and older population --
more than 90% -- is Seattle, followed by the twin cities of
Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn.; Sacramento, Calif.; Salt
Lake City; and Portland, Ore.
   Among regions, the West is where the densest concentration
of college-educated adults live. Fully 25% of all adults in
the West, age 25 and older, completed four or more years of
college, compared with 19% in the South and the Midwest, and
23% in the Northeast.
