It's time to put people first. That is the core of my national economic
strategy for America. And that will be the fundamental idea that guides my
presidency - Bill Clinton, June 1992
The economic convictions of Governor Bill Clinton, the front-runner in the
US presidential election, are now a matter of pressing importance. Would he
make marginal changes to US economic policy or push the US in a radically
new direction?
The answer is still hotly disputed, partly because Mr Clinton's speeches are
the artful constructions of a master politician. For example, he proclaims
his commitment to free trade, yet in the same breath condemns the
Republicans for 'exporting' American jobs to the Third World. The truth
seems to be that Mr Clinton is offering a genuine break with the past. As a
conservative southerner, he has little sympathy for either old-style 'tax
and spend' liberalism or Republican laissez-faire.
President George Bush is offering the nation a watered-down version of
Reaganism. He argues that big government is part of America's economic
problem and pledges new tax cuts if re-elected. Tax cuts - particularly more
generous relief on capital gains - are sold as a way to stimulate more
saving and investment, thus boosting growth and helping reduce the budget
deficit.
For Mr Clinton, this is the failed policy of 'trickle-down' economics. He
argues that rich individuals failed to invest or save in the 1980s despite a
halving of the top rate of income tax. Instead of raising productivity
growth, supply-side economics led to a consumption binge of unprecedented
proportions. Democrats attribute the economy's inability to shake off
recession in the past two years largely to the record corporate and personal
debts accumulated during the boom years of the 1980s.
Mr Clinton offers policies based on radically different premises. From the
day he shook former president John F Kennedy's hand as a schoolboy in the
1960s, he has believed in government as a positive force in people's lives.
He believes the US is losing ground relative to Europe and Japan because
federal and state governments often do little to support economic growth.
Deliberately echoing the rhetoric of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, Mr
Clinton is offering the American people a 'new covenant' - a pledge that a
revitalised public sector will take active steps to help the forgotten mass
of middle-class American families, many of which have recently suffered a
steady erosion of living standards.
But in an era of global economic competition and unprecedented mobility of
physical and financial capital, how can government best promote high living
standards? Drawing on the ideas of advisers such as Mr Robert Reich, a
professor at the Kennedy School of Government, Mr Clinton argues that
policymakers should concern themselves with factors of production that are
immobile, principally people and infrastructure.
He makes the argument crystal clear in his economic plan, Putting People
First: 'In the emerging global economy, everything is mobile: capital,
factories, even entire industries. The only resource that's really rooted in
a nation - and the ultimate source of all its wealth - is its people. The
only way America can compete and win in the 21st century is to have the
best-educated, best-trained workforce in the world, linked together by
transport and communication networks second to none.'
The underlying logic seems persuasive. US per capita incomes once depended
purely on the performance of American companies. In a global market, they
now depend on Americans' ability to gain employment with the world's most
dynamic companies, regardless of their ultimate ownership. One route to high
US living standards is thus to persuade the most productive companies -
German and Japanese as well as American - to locate high-tech plants and
research facilities in the US. But they will do this only if the US offers a
better environment for business than other countries, which means a
better-educated workforce and a modernised public infrastructure.
On education and training, Mr Clinton's proposals move well beyond the usual
focus on high-school reforms. By proposing a national apprenticeship
programme based loosely on continental European practice, he has become the
first presidential candidate to take seriously the educational needs of the
majority of Americans who do not attend university. To help those already in
the workforce, he would oblige employers to invest about 1.5 per cent of
payroll in training or contribute to the cost of public training schemes.
The college-bound, meanwhile, would benefit from financial reforms allowing
all qualified students to borrow from the government and repay loans either
through a low tax on subsequent earnings or by serving the community for a
limited period after graduation, for example as police officers or social
workers. The bold idea of encouraging thousands of graduates to pay for
college by enlisting in a domestic 'Peace Corps' is especially appealing for
middle-class families hit by rocketing tuition costs.
On infrastructure investment, Mr Clinton's plans go beyond mundane projects
such as new bridges and roads. He favours Japanese-style bullet trains and
promises a 'communications network of high-technology interaction that will
link every home, every school, every factory, every business in America, and
put us in the lead economically well into the 21st century'.
Mr Clinton's case for more activist government has other important planks.
He sees healthcare as partly an economic issue, because soaring costs are
putting an intolerable burden on much of American business. The Republican
claim that competition can bring down costs is dismissed as yet another
failed nostrum of the 1980s. Noting that a competitive free-for-all has led
to healthcare spending equivalent to 13 per cent of gross domestic product -
easily the world's highest - Mr Clinton argues convincingly that the US must
learn lessons from other advanced countries and accept the need for sterner
government regulation, including national spending caps.
He is also openly advocating a more interventionist industrial policy,
partly to help redeploy resources devoted to defence during the cold war
years. His advisers say he is not interested in 'picking winners' but does
believe that the federal government could do more to support the development
of new 'generic' technologies in fields such as robotics, high-speed
computing and biotechnology. He would create a civilian research and devel
opment agency 'to bring together business and universities to develop
cutting-edge products and tech-nologies'.
For many economists, however, Mr Clinton's otherwise attractive plan is
flawed by a failure to address the nation's single most pressing problem:
the federal budget deficit. His promise to 'halve the deficit' by 1996
despite proposing an additional Dollars 200bn of investment in education and
infrastructure is not regarded as credible. The extra spending is not large
relative to the US budget, but it is likely to inflate the deficit because
the offsetting tax increases and spending cuts proposed are dubious. For
example, Mr Clinton has unrealistic hopes of raising about Dollars 85bn from
the top 2 per cent of earners and Dollars 45bn from foreign companies
operating in the US.
Mr Clinton's failure to propose tough fiscal measures - such as Mr Ross
Perot's bracing Dollars 160bn increase in petrol taxes and Dollars 230bn cut
in entitlement programmes - makes a mockery of his pro-growth rhetoric. The
drain on national savings from record budget deficits is arguably the single
most important cause of low investment and productivity growth. Yet what
should Mr Clinton say if he hopes to win the election? Should he make the
same mistake as Mr Walter Mondale, the Democratic candidate in 1984, and
call for a general tax increase? This would be to present himself as a lamb
for slaughter.
Given electoral realities, budget policy should perhaps not count as a clear
negative for Mr Clinton. His promise to raise federal investment without
specifying credible tax increases is no more irresponsible than Mr Bush's
pledge to cut taxes without specifying offsetting spending cuts. What he
will do if he wins the election is uncertain; if the economy is still
stagnant, he will face immediate pressure to agree a fiscal stimulus.
But there is little reason to fear he will perform worse in the medium term
than the Republicans, who have quadrupled the national debt in 12 years. He
may do better. As governor of a poor state, he is used to making hard fiscal
choices and is reputedly keener on budget balance than most of his economic
advisers. He may even take advantage of an emerging consensus in Congress on
the need for budget retrenchment finally to bring the deficit under control.
Many elements of the Clinton plan have received broad support - in normally
Republican business circles as well as in Democratic strongholds such as the
teaching profession and labour unions. People appreciate Mr Clinton's long
time horizons. In the US, economic policy debates have normally been
restricted to next year's tax and spending plans. Mr Clinton is breaking new
ground by shifting the focus to the long-term determinants of productivity
growth, such as the quality of the workforce.
The common thread linking different parts of the plan is the notion that the
US must adapt and become more like its main trading rivals, such as Germany
and Japan. It is striking that each of Mr Clinton's main reform proposals -
in education and training, infrastructure, healthcare and industrial policy
 -would push the US economy in a distinctly European direction.
Mr Clinton, in effect, is offering the American people something akin to a
Germanic social market in which free enterprise is bolstered, rather than
undermined, by strong social policies. This approach is not without risks:
greater state intervention can inhibit the ability of economies to respond
flexibly to economic shocks, which is one reason why German unification has
imposed such great strains in Europe. But it also offers the prospect of
greater social cohesion, which may be more important in the long run. Mr
Clinton's success in the polls suggests Americans are ready for what could
prove an historic change of direction.
