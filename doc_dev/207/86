   Your second-front-page article ("Benefit of B.A. 
Is Greater Than Ever," Aug. 17) on the monetary value of a college education was too quick to jump to conclusions. 
Correlation is not causation, and comparing college graduates with non-graduates is far from the simple task it first appears. 

   In the first place, what is of interest is not so much whether and by how much graduates exceed others in income, but how much the degree itself adds to one's earning power. 
College graduates differ in a number of important respects from non-graduates. 
The graduate tends to be brighter. 
He is more often of European or Oriental extraction. 
His parents are generally wealthier, and are themselves usually better educated than the parents of nongraduates. 
Finally, graduates self-select for the one ability that may be most important to their economic success over a lifetime: the personal discipline requisite to completion of a program of creative study. 

   I am not denying that a college education has value, at least for some people. 
But that value may well be more in the expanded horizons and opportunities for interesting (not necessarily well-paying) work that are perhaps more readily available to the degreed individual. 

   It would be most interesting to see an article that would examine the market value of a college degree by separating out for comparison a group of degreed and non-degreed individuals with similar social and economic backgrounds and levels of intelligence. 
I suspect that most of the market value of college would prove illusory.
