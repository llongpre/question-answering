that a new strategy is starting to emerge

The outlines of a new White House strategy to recover from the debilitating
Whitewater affair have begun to emerge over the last few days, according to
senior officials preferring to speak off the record.
Prominent will be the emergence of Mrs Hillary Clinton back into the public
domain, following more than a week when controversy about her role in the
complex tale of family financial and land dealings in Arkansas had driven
her into relative seclusion.
Two weekly news magazines will publish today interviews with her in which
she confesses to 'mis-steps' in White House handling of the affair and an
underestimation on her part of media interest in it. A news conference or TV
interview, with or without her husband, is also being considered.
The White House sense is that Mrs Clinton's 'moral authority', both as a
policy adviser and role model, has been damaged but is by no means beyond
repair. President Bill Clinton's public schedule, which took him to Detroit
yesterday for today's Group of Seven jobs conference, will also be stepped
up.
Officials admit he has been much distracted over the last ten days by
Whitewater and particularly want him to turn his attention back to several
pressing foreign policy issues, such as relations with China and Russia,
Bosnia and, possibly, putting the new Nato 'partnership for peace' with
eastern Europe on a faster track.
Mr Lloyd Cutler, recruited last week as new White House legal counsel, has
already emerged as a leading designated spokesman, with the mission to
assure both public and press that no crimes were committed and no cover-up
undertaken. Yesterday, for example, he appeared on all three TV network
Sunday shows, a rare occurrence.
His presence, taken together with the fact that both the Clintons are now
consulting more widely with senior staff who had been frozen out of the
internal Whitewater deliberations, seems to have lifted some of the
demoralised gloom inside the White House that touched a nadir when the
federal grand jury issued subpoenas to senior staff.
Mr Joel Klein, the deputy counsel who joined the White House last December
to fill the late Mr Vincent Foster's shoes, is also given much credit for
ensuring no stone was unturned in delivering documents to the grand jury. He
is said to have established an excellent working relationship with Mr Robert
Fiske, the independent counsel, and this has contributed to what is hoped to
be a growing impression in the media that the White House is holding nothing
back.
Mr Cutler said on NBC yesterday his investigations included 'accusations
relating to possible Clinton involvement' in the death of Mr Foster. He did
not eleborate.
The media mood itself is currently quite fickle. Absent any new revelations,
several publications in the last 48 hours have run self-critical articles
about Whitewater reporting overkill. Opinion polls depict a public still
less than consumed by the affair.
A critical element to the White House strategy is to get political and
public focus back on the president's domestic programmes. Last Friday's
comfortable passage by the House of the 1994-95 budget, with only marginal
changes to the administration blueprint, was a substantial victory for the
president but received perfunctory media coverage, in sharp contrast to last
year's budget drama when Mr Clinton prevailed by just one vote.
One option is to try to make an early deal with Congress on healthcare
reform, incorporating some basic elements of the Clinton plan, including
universal coverage, but with concessions to more modest versions advanced by
both conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans.
This approach is being pushed by the less ardent supporters of the Clinton
plan and, therefore, may encounter resistance from the First Lady, its chief
architect. The counter argument is that public support for the plan is
ebbing and failure to cut a deal soon may mean loss of any chance to pass
healthcare this year.
The second option is to try to reach early accommodation with House
Republicans on a crime bill comparable to that approved by the Senate last
year. This would take up a popular issue and would exploit some Republican
nervousness about being seen to hold the legislative programme hostage to
Whitewater.
White House tacticians sense a tendency on the part of the Republican
Whitewater assault troops to overplay their hand. Over the weekend, several
prominent Democrats took to attacking the record of Senator Al D'Amato of
New York, a leading Whitewater critic whose own ethical history is studded
with controversy.
However, further personnel sacrifices from the administration are far from
excluded. The most likely candidate appears to be Mr Webster Hubbell, now
the associate attorney-general and previously Mrs Clinton's law partner in
Arkansas. He has been accused of assorted ethical improprieties, not all
related to Whitewater.
Also vulnerable is Mr Roger Altman, deputy treasury secretary, who initiated
meetings with White House officials to discuss the status of federal
investigations into the failed savings and loan at the heart of Whitewater.
However, late last week, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, delivered a
pep talk to senior treasury staff on the imperative of rallying behind Mr
Altman.
Beneath this guarded sense of recovery lies the fear of further damaging
accusations and revelations. As fas as Whitewater itself is concerned,
senior officials believe that the worst that could happen is that Mr and Mrs
Clinton might be forced into a civil settlement, such as payment of back
taxes.
This could be harmful - but not fatal - to his political future, especially
if the economic recovery continues. However, so balkanised has the White
House become that extensive knowledge, both of Whitewater and of the events
of the last nine months which are sometimes portrayed as a cover-up, is not
widely spread, even in the upper reaches of the executive branch.
