FT  21 AUG 92 / Discordant tones over family values: Republican Party
Convention in Houston - The GOP making politics of wholesomeness

NORMALLY, a highlight of any US political convention is the roll-call of the
states voting on the nominations for president and vice-president. It is a
process which gives the unsung party worker a minute in the televised sun,
as he or she proclaims something along the lines of: 'The great state of
Calicutt, the world's leading producer of triangular melons, proudly casts
all its 2 3/4 votes. .  .'
Not so on Wednesday night. The roll-call came late because the Republican
party wanted television prime time to play what it thinks is one of its
strongest tunes this year, the family values melody.
The religious overture was by a television evangelist, the Rev Pat
Robertson, than whom few are more conservative; the intermezzo by Mrs
Marilyn Quayle, than whom few are more certain in conviction; and the
rousing crescendo by Mrs Barbara Bush, than whom few rate higher in the
nation's admiration. The coda was the appearance on the podium of her 22
children and grandchildren and, finally, her husband, the president.
This parade of family wholesomeness was intended to contrast with Clinton
and Clinton, as erstwhile Republican challenger Mr Pat Buchanan maliciously
called the Democratic candidate and his lawyer wife. Far from being just
another 'baby boomer' family, they were promoting, as Mr Robertson saw it,
'a radical plan to destroy the traditional family and transfer its function
to the federal government'. Worse yet, they rated the Spotted Owl more
highly than God.
Mrs Bush, undoubted star of the evening, is far too shrewdly apolitical to
engage in anything other than indirect comparisons. She extolled her husband
as a great family man and recalled 'the best years of our lives', after the
second world war in Midland, Texas, with its round of carpools for the
children, little league baseball, church, Fourth of July fireworks, carols
at Christmas.
'Family,' she proclaimed, 'means putting your arms around each other, and
being there.' With a wife like this, the convention said to itself, how
could anybody not reasonably vote for George Bush?
Mrs Quayle was less reticent in casting her stones at the Clintons, without
mentioning them by name. She unctuously contrasted her baby-boomer values
with, by implication, those of the opposition, who also came of age in the
1960s.
'Not everyone demonstrated, dropped out, took drugs, joined in the sexual
revolution, or dodged the draft,' she proclaimed - the last a brave, even
brazen, reference since her husband avoided military service in Vietnam by
joining the National Guard reserve, as Mr Clinton sought to do.
A career, Mrs Quayle went on, was a real option for women. But 'most of us
love being mothers or wives, which gives our lives a richness that few men
or women get from their professional accomplishments alone.'
The Clintons and the Gores also made much of the strengths of their
respective families last month at the Democratic convention in New York. For
the Clintons, this was political necessity, since they had conceded that
their marriage went through a rocky period and because Mrs Hillary Clinton
is a noted advocate for the rights of children.
This has made her a particular demonic figure in the eyes of Republicans,
who have dragged out, and misquoted, a 1974 legal article in which she is
alleged to have equated motherhood with slavery.
The reality, as an editorial in USA Today pointed out yesterday, is that the
US family is not what it was. Nearly three out of five mothers of pre-school
children are now in the workforce; less than a third of all families are now
'traditional' - married couples with husband working and wife at home.
'Evoking a lost era and inflaming hatreds do not help real families,' the
newspaper, not noted for liberalism, declared. It advised both candidates
'to start pushing for the policies that can do children and families some
good'.
Mrs Bush acknowledged this reality in her speech when she addressed parents
who have sacrificed for their children: 'You may be exhausted from working a
job, or two jobs, and taking care of your children, or you may have put your
career on hold. Either way, you may wonder, as I did every now and then, am
I really doing the right thing? Yes, you are.'
Mrs Bush is so popular that she can get away with invoking the past and
acknowledging present realities. She constitutes a vote-winning appeal that,
for the night at least, put into shadow those less tolerant Republican
elements, notably the religious right, whose preference is indeed to roll
back the clock and whose broader appeal must be suspect. The representatives
of the mythical state of Calicutt could not object to playing second fiddle.
