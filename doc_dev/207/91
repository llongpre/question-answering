<LEADPARA>  IT WAS supposed to be Bill Clinton's 15 minutes of glory. He was to give the
nominating speech for his friend, Michael Dukakis, before a television
audience of millions at the 1988 Democratic national convention in Atlanta.;  
 Instead, it was 45 minutes of embarrassment, a long-winded oration that
turned off delegates in the hall and clicked off TV sets across the nation.
When Clinton finally uttered the words, "In closing . . . ," the restless
Democrats cheered.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That was then. This is now.;    Re-elected to his fifth term as governor of
Arkansas last fall, Clinton is burning up the political circuit this year with
vigorous speeches calling on Democrats to change their losing ways if they
ever hope to regain the White House.;    In the process, he is dazzling many
party activists desperate for somebody -- anybody -- who can grab the
attention of voters enamored of George Bush.;    They like Clinton's youth,
good looks and style: 6 feet 3 inches tall, blue-eyed and wavy-haired, he is
only 44 years old even though he is the nation's senior governor in amount of
time in office.;    And they like his message: that America needs a "new
choice" instead of the worn-out conservatism of the Reagan and Bush
administrations -- or the stale liberalism many voters associate with the
Democratic Party.;    HE SAYS his "agenda isn't liberal or conservative. It is
both, and it is different." For example, he thinks government should do more
to help poor people escape from poverty, but he expects them to work, study
and behave responsibly in return.;    In charisma and communication skills,
Clinton is outmatched only by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo among the little band
of potential 1992 Democratic presidential candidates.;    "He was fabulous,
fabulous," gushed Nathan Landow, a leading Maryland Democrat, after Clinton
appeared before a group of wealthy party fund-raisers in Washington in June,
according to the Arkansas Gazette. "He has a good message," Millie Jeffries, a
veteran Michigan party activist, said after Clinton addressed the National
Women's Political Caucus on July 14.;    Like Cuomo, Clinton says he has not
yet decided to run in 1992. If he does, he said in an interview in his office
here, he will campaign as an "outsider, running against the established order
of things.";    That is a formula that worked for Ronald Reagan and the last
successful Democrat, Jimmy Carter. Analysts think an outsider could have an
edge over a senator or a member of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992,
given Americans' massive distrust and cynicism toward government and
politics.;    Although he admits he is "virtually anonymous" outside political
circles, Clinton is not lacking in experience and sophistication.;    Born to
a farming family in Hope, Ark., he worked his way through Georgetown
University, studied at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and earned a law degree at
Yale with the help of scholarships, a federal loan and six part-time jobs.;   
As governor for 11 years, he said he has dealt, in microcosm, "with every good
thing and every bad thing that has happened in America.";    He has led
governors' committees that devised programs for education, health care and
welfare reform. This spring, Clinton was voted the most effective governor in
the nation by a jury of his peers, the National Governors Association, getting
four times as many votes as Cuomo.;    Unlike many harassed governors this
year, Clinton can boast of a balanced budget, thanks to a state constitution
that makes it a misdemeanor for him to spend more than he collects every 90
days.;    After a shaky start -- he was defeated during the 1980 Reagan
landslide after his first two years in office but has been re-elected four
times since -- he has gradually earned the confidence of business and labor,
blacks and whites.;    SCHOOLTEACHERS, for example, were furious at Clinton
when he imposed teacher-testing in his second term, said Debra DeLee,
political director of the National Education Association. But they like him
now because he repeatedly has increased taxes to raise their salaries while
keeping classroom sizes small.;    Arkansas blacks voted overwhelmingly for
him, while business executives -- including Sam Walton, the billionaire
founder of the Wal-Mart chain -- are generally friendly.;    Clinton's message
to national Democrats, like his record in Arkansas, is a mixture of liberal
and conservative ideas that he believes will appeal to the broad middle of the
electorate.;    He conceded that any Democrat will have a hard time beating
Bush.;    "There may be a no-vacancy sign on the White House in 1992," he
said. "To the best of my memory, no war-winner has ever been denied
re-election.";    But at the same time, he insisted that "people know all is
not right with this country. Deep down, they know that it's not right for the
president to deny the existence of problems and to disclaim any
responsibility. They want a chance to turn inward and focus on our internal
problems. . . . National security begins at home.";    Four years ago, Clinton
also explored a presidential race but pulled back, explaining that he did not
want to subject his only child, Chelsea, then 7, to the stress of a national
campaign.;    This time, he said, his daughter is old enough to survive a
campaign, but he worries about what life in the White House might do to a
young girl nearing adolescence.;    "God forbid I should win!" he quoted his
wife, Hillary, as saying.;    CLINTON BIOGRAPHY; NAME:; Bill Clinton (father,
