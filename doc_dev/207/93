with sudden fame - Nikki Tait meets the woman who made Hillary Clinton's
ball gown

HOW DOES a budding entrepreneur cope with a rush of publicity?
Ask Sarah Phillips, the Manhattan-born designer who created the blue-violet
ballgown which Hillary Clinton wore on the evening of Inauguration Day. The
dress, with its lace bodice, heavy beading and wafting mousseline overskirt,
twinkled across 30m television screens as the newly-installed first lady
waltzed round Washington dance-floors.
Designing the gown would have been a plum commission for any fashion
business. The garment, after all, goes on show at the Smithsonian
Institution and coverage of the inaugural balls is watched worldwide. But
for a 37-year-old designer, who started her business only two years ago, the
assignment would seem to represent the ultimate break.
Five minutes with Phillips dispels such illusions. For a start, she is
talking from a loft, situated on a grafitti-ridden stretch of Manhattan's
Lower East Side. This is where she lives and works, swatches of material
nestling behind her sculptor husband's metalwork.
Not only is the apartment unpretentious, it is also frenetic. No sooner has
Phillips finished haggling down the telephone with a supplier, than her
husband begins a laborious conversation with the White House. He is
struggling to secure pictures of the Inauguration evening on behalf a
Japanese magazine interviewer. Forget secretaries, PR advisors, or flunkies.
This is a one-woman, husband-assisted show - and taking advantage of the
avalanche of interest which has followed the ballgown design is proving an
uphill task.
Phillips's basic problem is lack of capital. She started the business with
about Dollars 65,000 (Pounds 45,000) of family money, after training at New
York's Parsons School of Design and working for the likes of Ralph Lauren
and Christian Dior. She has never received a cent of outside funding, not
even a commercial bank loan.
As a result, her scant working capital is tied up in a treadmill of sample
lines and production costs. With no assets besides her talent, she is not
the sort of proposition which has lenders salivating. Yet, to take advantage
of her sudden fame - via a showroom or stepped-up orders - she badly needs
financing.
Phillips, who aims to produce a spring and an autumn line, explains how the
numbers work: 'It usually costs Dollars 25,000-Dollars 30,000 to do a sample
line of about 30 pieces,' she says. (Her 'normal' focus is on
highly-tailored day and evening wear, ranging from a full-length coat which
retails at Dollars 5,000, to evening pieces in the Dollars 1,000-Dollars
4,000 range).
'Basically, you need to have all this money upfront. Then you take your
orders and produce. Again, you have to have the money to buy all the fabric,
meet all the production costs.' Production expenses, she estimates, are
about 40 per cent of sales.
'Next, you ship the goods, and then the stores don't pay until 30-120 days
after you've delivered. By that time, you've had to start your second sample
line.'
Phillips's orders have grown nicely, as a handful of upmarket boutiques and
store chains, including Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, have taken her
merchandise. Orders, which totalled Dollars 60,000 in the autumn 1991
season, topped Dollars 300,000 for the 1993 spring season. However, to fund
the twice-yearly process and with limited funds to hand Phillips has been
forced to raise cash by selling her purchase orders to factors.
The factoring businesses buy the orders at a discount of 1 per cent a week.
'That means I'm paying them Dollars 3,000 a week to buy my fabrics and
produce the line for me,' says Phillips.
'We gave the factors Dollars 50,000 last season. The season before that we
spent Dollars 25,000. Plus they get a fee. And this is all because banks
will not lend to people who are starting out in business.'
Phillips admits that the small scale of her operation increases the problem:
'The whole idea is that you want to ship every month, so your cashflow is
better.'
She also acknowledges that her search for more substantial capital resources
should have been given higher priority.
'We had some investors who were interested, but they weren't familiar with
the industry and didn't understand the deadlines. We had to get the fall
line out for this season, and a month went by. We really trusted them, which
was probably our fault, when we should have been pursuing other avenues.'
In the end, the investors dropped out, and Phillips says she does not know
what will happen next.
But if capital problem was rumbling before the ballgown fame, it became
doubly vexatious afterwards. 'We never expected the assignment,' says
Phillips, who was asked to submit evening gown suggestions after Hillary
Clinton bought a Phillips-designed suit in a Little Rock boutique and wore
it at the Democratic Convention.
'We just weren't prepared. There were a lot of orders we couldn't fill
because we didn't have the capital to go out and buy more fabric. Besides,
it was getting so late at that point. We were starting all of our production
patternwork, and that was the end of January. We were due to ship at the end
of February and it was just too tight (to take on extra work). If we were
larger firm, we could have handled it.'
A few lesser problems have also emerged. First, Phillips is now firmly
associated in the public mind with ballgowns - or, in the case of some
customers, bridalwear.
'I don't do ballgowns,' she wails, sounding like an actress who is terrified
of being typecast. 'I did one particular ballgown for the first lady, and
that's the only ballgown I've ever done. I really don't want to make a
business of ballgowns. You don't make money.'
Secondly, she is uncertain how the fashion business generally is responding
to her sudden fame.
'A lot of popular designers got their nose bent out of shape on Seventh
Avenue . . . they wanted the job and were calling the Governors' Mansion in
Little Rock on a daily basis. I understand. Who wouldn't want it? Still,
when a relative unknown gets it . . . some established designers who happy
about it, although others were great.'
Phillips says she would not have missed the sudden glory. She knows that she
has acquired wider name-recognition as a result. Her husband shows a set of
'behind-the-scenes' snaps he took of the Inauguration Day evening, which
will probably become family heirlooms. They hope that the search for backing
will prove fruitful.
'But,' says Sarah Phillips, a little wistfully. 'I would have prefered all
this to have happened later in my career.'
