   There may be something rising faster than the price of going to college, after all. 

   The price of not going. 

   In a ritual well known to strapped parents, the College Board recently released its annual survey showing tuitions rising faster than inflation. 
As is customary, the big admissions group gave no explanation for the 7% increase for 1988-89, the eighth year in a row that the rise in college tuition has outpaced inflation. 

   Pressed by Congress and others for the reasons, colleges have in the past blamed the need for more scholarships and higher faculty salaries. 
But a growing body of research suggests a more markets-like answer: College costs more because the product is worth more. 

   Measured in terms of income, returns on a bachelor's degree "have been exploding in the '80s," says Finis Welch, an economics professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who specializes in the labor market. 
Mr. Welch and other analysts, using census data, see a dramatic rise in the amount of income gained by going to college over a time period roughly coinciding with the big tuition increases. 

   Male college graduates in the work force made 39.2% more than high school graduates in 1986, the latest year of Census Bureau reports, compared with 23.8% in 1979. 
For women, the difference rose to 40.5% from 27.9%. 

   More recent data, derived by University of Michigan economist Jonathan Bound from computer tapes of the Census Bureau's monthly surveys, indicate that the differences were more pronounced in 1987. 
Mr. Bound's figures show that the gap last year was 70% for women in their first 10 working years and 46% for males of that experience. 
Economists caution that when data for all workers is reported by the Census Bureau, the unusually large gap for women will probably shrink, though it still will be above the 1986 figure. 

   Moreover, Mr. Bound says the figures don't reflect another benefit of college, namely that the college educated are less likely to be unemployed than high school graduates. 
And Mr. Welch's research shows that the gap between more-seasoned workers is widening even faster, peaking at about 20 years' experience and remaining steady afterward. 

   No one is sure what's behind the growing income gap, but some economists point to a drop in high-paying factory jobs among high school graduates. 
Another reason may be the growing importance of high-tech employment demanding more education. 
Also, while the number of new college graduates has edged up only about 5% in the past 10 years to about 980,000 a year, the work force has expanded much faster. 
This has given a sheepskin a rarity value unimagined in the 1970s, when the well-educated flooded the labor market and the cabbie with a doctorate drove his way into national folklore. 

   "It's rather remarkable," says Richard Freeman, an economist whose 1976 book, "The Overeducated American," presented evidence on the decline of a diploma's value. 
Now director of labor studies at the National Bureau for Economic Research in Boston, Mr. Freeman says he had expected college's value to make a comeback, "but no one anticipated the magnitude" of the gains for college graduates. 

   Census data show that the median income of the college-educated man in 1986 was $34,391 versus $24,701 for those without college. 
That means that the college "payback time" -- the number of years it takes a worker to recoup four years of tuition and lost earnings -- has shrunk despite the soaring tuitions. 
Using tuition figures for public colleges, which educate about 77% of all students, the payback time is down to about 11 years, from about 17 in 1979, before the big tuition mark-ups. 

   Economists don't suggest that high school seniors are delving through census data and punching calculators before deciding whether or not to attend college. 
But they do say students and parents know what's going on around them -- and act accordingly. 

   "People see some of the kind of job creation that's going on, and they realize without a college education they're up a tree," says Louis Morrell, treasurer of Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Mass. 
"People want it and they're willing to pay for it." 

   Relatively stable annual enrollment of about 12 million students in the 1980s wouldn't seem to support the idea of more clamoring for college. 
But enrollment has held steady in the face of a 16% decline in the number of high school graduates since 1977. 
More college freshmen than ever say they're there to make more money, and according to the most recent Gallup survey on the subject, 64% of Americans rate a college education as "very important" in getting ahead, up from 36% in 1978. 

   "Costs have escalated at the very moment in history when more people believe that (college) is worth it," says Terry Hartle, education aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. 
"I don't think it's unrelated." 

   The figures tend to support the economic value of college. 
But they also suggest that prices in higher education are more subject to market forces than universities have generally acknowledged. 
Richard Rosser, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, says many colleges struggle to hold the line on costs without sacrificing quality. 
And he adds that tuitions cover only a portion of total costs, with the balance coming from governments, private donations and investment earnings. 
"Colleges agonize over tuition decisions," he says. 
"What they're doing is simply covering the real cost of running our universities." 

   With soaring applications, officials of Ivy League and other top private colleges have long contended that they could raise tuitions by more than they have, and still retain enrollments. 
They say they have resisted doing so because of concern about the ability of some people to pay. 

   As for the future? 

   Higher tuitions still, say the economists who study higher education, until quality, or at least the economic value of higher education, is perceived to decline. 
"Colleges will act like businessmen on a board," says Mr. Morrell of Radcliffe. 
"They price themselves according to what the value of the good is perceived to be, and they'll continue to do that until the market says it won't accept it."
