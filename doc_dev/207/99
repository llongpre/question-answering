THE AGENDA: INSIDE THE CLINTON WHITE HOUSE by Bob Woodward Simon &amp; Schuster
Pounds 14.99, 352 pages
Bob Woodward really is the most amazing investigative reporter. He gets
everywhere. Here we are on the very first page of his latest book and the
famous Watergate sleuth is actually in bed with Bill and Hillary Clinton, or
perhaps under it.
We must assume he was there because the conversation between the two, in
late August, 1991, and about whether Bill should run for president, is all
in direct quotes. And they both speak in complete sentences, apart from
three 'yeahs' from Hillary, which few people, even those as articulate as
the Clintons, ever manage in the informality of their own private quarters.
There is a severe temptation to put this book down after the first page, so
preposterous is its beginning and so presumptuous is the hypothesis laid out
in the introduction. This temptation should not necessarily be resisted,
partly because of the methodology (as in his last book, The Commanders,
about the US military, conversations are 'recreated' throughout the book on
the basis of extensive but off-the-record interviews), partly because it is
so poorly written and partly because the numbing detail of the twists and
turns of the debate over US economic policy in the first seven months of the
Clinton administration can be of interest only to the truly devoted or those
with axes to grind.
But, all that said, it is a perversely riveting read for the cognoscenti. It
has been devoured in the US capital because it is all about Washington
people, processes and mores, triple navels which consume the city's everyday
life. The Washington Post, the hometown newspaper which is Woodward's
employer, spread it all over the front pages for four days in a row (cynics
believe that all the best material was in these extracts).
It also matters, given that Washington does not like the Clinton crowd and
vice versa, that it does not show the president, his wife and his government
in the best of lights. They come over as a group of disorganised well
meaning incompetents who cannot work out whether to increase taxes or cut
them and who are eternally surprised when Congress does not do their
bidding.
Woodward announces that he got interested in the economy as long ago as
1992, which suggests we must confine the collective wisdom of Keynes,
Friedman, Galbraith and several Austrians to the wastebasket. Perhaps his
newness to the business of economic policy-making and his own membership of
the Washington establishment explains why the eminence grise of his book is
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and a de facto pillar
of that establishment.
It is Greenspan, we are assured, who educates an administration inclined to
be contemptuous of Wall Street, in the importance of the bond market. Lower
interest rates, he kept pointing out, took some of the pain out of necessary
cuts in public spending. Thus, so long as long term rates kept going down,
as they did during the book's time span, the bond markets became the 'new
God.'
It stretches credulity to accept that wily old pols like Lloyd Bentsen, the
treasury secretary, and Wall Street veterans like Robert Rubin and Roger
Altman were unaware of this phenomenon, even if there was a
politico-economic clique in the administration uncomfortable with it. It
also insults intelligent non-economic members of the Clinton team, like
George Stephanopoulos, to imply prior ignorance of the importance of
markets.
It also dangerously simplifies the eternally shifting and complex
relationship between the head of the independent central bank and the
government. Greenspan is a subtle operator, to be sure, with finely tuned
political antennae. But he also answers to his own board, to the markets and
to his own economic policy instincts, responsibilities which hardly square
with the quasi-Machiavellian role ascribed to him.
Where the book does hit home is in its portrayal of the factions inside the
Clinton crowd. There are, indeed, several power centres, starting with a
president of superior intellect and involvement but chronically disorganised
and indecisive.
There is a Hillary faction, an Al Gore faction, deficit versus investment
factions, and the influential group of external political advisers
technically not on the White House staff whose mission is to ensure Mr
Clinton does not forget all the promises that got him elected.
This last group - James Carville, Paul Begala, Mandy Grunwald and Stan
Greenberg - come over as prime sources for the book. Some may regret this.
Begala, for example, discloses that his nickname for Leon Panetta, then
budget director, was 'the poster boy for economic constipation.' Panetta has
just been named White House chief of staff with a mandate to shake-up the
operation which, if he bears grudges, just might include limiting Begala's
access to the presidential ear.
But this is perhaps the most remarkable thing about the book. Just about
everybody, insiders, outsiders and even, on the basis of the first page, the
Clintons themselves, appears to have talked to Bob Woodward. It is almost as
if they all felt that not to talk to him would be like a good Catholic
avoiding the confessional. Retribution might not be papal but the Washington
knife is much to be feared.
Yet, having cooperated, they find that the Woodward book, for all its
manifold faults, comes over as a mean stiletto. It is no small wonder that
its sources have greeted it mostly with a deafening silence, interspersed
with occasional mutterings that it is all about 'process' and not about
'substance'.
Mary McGrory, the salty veteran Washington columnist, suspects that the book
was the last straw for Clinton in reshuffling his White House pack.
'Plainly, people who have time to give Woodward four or five interviews -
while other calls go unreturned - and press on him internal documents of
fair sensitivity could use some reminders of their primary responsibility.'
