Which city, after London, is Britain's leading city of theatre? The answer
is Glasgow; but few people outside Scotland realise this. In the Citizens
Theatre (with three auditoria, since last year), the Tramway, the Kings
Theatre, and the Theatre Royal, it has both quality and quantity. What's
more, the Citz and the Tramway combine to give Glasgow a range of styles so
broad and so European that any other British city, London included, should
envy it.
The Tramway has a particular record for bringing Glasgow some of the most
important European and British theatre. This is the one British locale to
which Peter Brook brought his Mahabharata, Carmen and (earlier this year)
Pelleas et Melisande; this is where Howard Barker's The Europeans had its
premiere earlier this year; and this is a focal point for the four Romanian
theatre productions currently or recently touring Britain. The
theatre/dance/music company Second Stride has just given here two
performances of its new Escape from Sea, seen in London two weeks before;
and in February Scottish Opera will give David Leveaux's new production of
Britten's Turn of the Screw here.
Glasgow, like Edinburgh and other British cities, has also its share of
shows that London has seen or will see. Peter Hall's new production of Pam
Gems's Piaf, with Elaine Page, which the West End has yet to see, is running
this week at the Theatre Royal. And Hall's 1992 staging of Wilde's An Ideal
Husband, which ran for six months on Shaftesbury Avenue, recently came to
both Glasgow's Theatre Royal and Edinburgh's King's Theatre. (Dulcie Gray
and Michael Denison, in their bit roles, are still clinging on from the
original cast - and now promoted to star billing, just above Kate O'Mara and
Angharad Rees.)
Then there are productions that London does not see, but which tour
Scotland. TAG Theatre's Scots Quair, which ran successfully throughout the
Edinburgh Festival, has recently played at the Citizens Theatre; and the
staging of Jakob Lenz's The Soldiers, which Philip Prowse directed and which
opened during the same festival, is a Citizens production which later
transferred to its Glasgow place of origin. Glasgow also gets to see
productions from Edinburgh theatre, such as the Royal Lyceum's A Midsummer
Night's Dream, the second production by the Lyceum's artistic director Kenny
Ireland, which recently transferred to Glasgow's Theatre Royal for a
fortnight.
But the two contrasting forces that probably do most to define Glasgow
theatre are its old music-hall tradition on the one hand and 'the Citz' on
the other. The music-hall tradition, whose influence percolates through to
the comic roles in the Edinburgh Lyceum's stagings of classic drama, erupts
in the pantomime season. (At a time when trad panto is fading from the West
End at Christmas, various Glasgow venues this December will offer
productions of Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Jack and the Beanstalk, Beauty
and the Beast, Snow White and Mr McScrooge.)
The Citizens Theatre is a source of another kind of vitality, enlarging
Scottish theatre rather than carrying on old Scottish or English traditions.
Since 1969 it has built up a complex reputation, a reputation that includes
sexiness, glamour, freshness, irony, camp, daring and more. It has presented
classics in radical new versions, introduced unknown European classics to
Britain, developed new ways of adapting famous works of literature to the
stage, and presented lively new plays.
The Citz Christmas non-pantomime show, opening next week, will be The Lion,
The Witch and the Wardrobe. Meanwhile the two smaller auditoria have been
launched other productions. There is little to commend in A Stinging Sea, by
Vivien Adam and directed by Maggie Kinloch, currently in the theatre's
smallest space: a crummy psychodrama set on a Hebridean island about a man,
a woman and a ghoul who variously represents the boy the man once was, the
children the woman has abandoned for him, the foetus she once aborted, and
the child one or other of them would like to have. Plenty of sex
(increasingly joyless), even more screaming, but weak female acting and
several narrative cliches.
Upstairs in the Circle Studio, however, the staging of Goldoni's Don Juan -
translated and directed by Robert David MacDonald - is a thrill. No Don Juan
tells quite the same story, and Goldoni's variants are part of this
version's excitement. Here, Donna Anna and Duke Octavio dislike each other
and are only engaged with extreme reluctance; Elisa (the peasant Zerlina
character) constantly tells lies to string along her men; Donna Isabella
(the Elvira character, already deceived by Juan) pursues her former lover in
male disguise, and finds herself drawn to Octavio, her new protector (Anna
even denounces her, falsely, as Octavio's mistress); and Anna's father, the
Commendador, only appears as a living figure, not as a vengeful statue.
When finally Juan is shown to have tricked all the women, and is trapped in
sanctuary, he begins to rave hysterically: 'Elisa - Isabella - Anna - which
of you will murder me?' He dies when the ceiling collapses upon him, but
this act of God is the only hint of supernatural intervention in the play.
All is rational, witty, dangerous, charged. (This is the British premiere of
Goldoni's version: it is astonishing that we have done without it so long.)
The most remarkable character of all is Anna - a proud schemer, torn between
virginal devotion to her father and sensual attraction to Juan, determined
to resist Octavio at all costs and half-repulsed by Juan's more brusque
advances, yet prepared at first to marry Juan even after he has killed her
father. What a role] She is as complex, cold and cruel as one of Racine's
heroines. But I was amazed too by the duplicitous determination of Elisa.
There are less surprises about Juan himself, but Goldoni fleshes out his
lethal, Godless selfishness and hubris with telling detail.
I should love to see a Don Juan festival - maybe at Edinburgh? - in which
this Goldoni was included, alongside those other versions by Tirso de
Molina, Moliere, Gluck, Mozart, Byron, Zorilla, Strauss, Shaw and Horvath.
The only flaw in MacDonald's production is that is Andrew Wilde's chilling
Juan lacks sensual allure. But the staging has psychological depth, glamour,
tension, and spirit. (Andrea Hart as Anna exemplifies all these factors.)
But I should love also to see a Goldoni festival. This year is the
bicentenary of his death, by the way; and the more you see of his work, the
more diverse a master he appears. Just compare - to name but three  -
Strehler's revelatory and humane staging of Le Baruffe chiozzotte (brought
last year to the National), the RSC's current staging of the knockabout
Venetian Twins, and this rational and penetrating Don Juan. No British
theatre has done more to honour Goldoni than the Citz; this is its eighth
Goldoni since 1976. All eight have been translated and directed by
MacDonald. His Don Juan text is exemplary: elegant, intelligent, idiomatic,
and never calling attention to its own cleverness. Lucky Glasgow.
Don Juan continues at the Citizens until December 11; A Stinging Sea ends
tonight - November 27
