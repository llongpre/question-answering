GLASGOW'S economy, tourism and culture received a strong boost in 1990 when
it was the EC's European city of culture.
The year, during which Glasgow provided an uninterrupted stream of cultural
events, is reckoned to have created more than 5,000 temporary jobs and
produced a net return to the regional economy of between Pounds 10m and
Pounds 14m.
The European city of culture accolade passes to EC cities in turn. Glasgow
says it was the only city to provide an all-encompassing programme running
for 12 months. Other cities to hold the accolade have provided concentrated
programmes of arts events.
This year the city of culture is Madrid. Last year it was Dublin.
A report by Mr John Myerscough, a consultant specialising in the economic
impact of cultural events, says there was an 81 per cent increase in visits
by tourists to arts events compared with 1986.
During the year attendance at theatres, galleries, halls and museums rose by
40 per cent.
The report says the cost to the public sector of creating between 5,300 and
5,600 jobs during the year was Pounds 7,286 per job, which compared
favourably with other job-creating initiatives.
The net gain to the economy of up to Pounds 14m took into account
public-sector support of Pounds 36m. The private sector contributed Pounds
6m, and total spending was Pounds 400m.
Mr Myerscough said Glasgow now needed to main-tain the momentum created by
the year of culture and to promote the city as a cultural tourist
destination, especially for the short-breaks market.
