are no passengers, but Prestwick insists it has a future

IF THE 400,000 people who live in Ayrshire have one thing in common it is a
passionate loyalty to Prestwick Airport.
There is a widespread belief that the airport, near Ayr on the Firth of
Clyde, is one of the world's finest. It has a long runway, an impressive
passenger terminal and the area's mild climate means it is hardly ever
forced to close.
Yet for the past year and a half it has had no regular passenger flights,
scheduled or charter. Much of the terminal is deserted. Even Mr Matthew
Hudson, the airport's chief executive, jokes: 'Business? We haven't got any
business.'
Prestwick's decline accelerated in 1990 when the government abolished the
legal requirement for transatlantic flights from Scotland to use Prestwick.
The number of flights using the airport was already dwindling: passengers
were reluctant to use it because, being 30 miles south-west of Glasgow, it
was seen as too remote for much of Scotland. As soon as transatlantic
flights were free to use Glasgow, services to north America were launched
from there.
Prestwick's monopoly had been maintained because of the influence wielded by
Ayrshire MPs, led by Mr George Younger, who was Tory MP for Ayr and is now
Lord Younger of Prestwick.
Now Ayrshire is having to prove its loyalty to Prestwick with money and hard
work.
In April last year the airport was bought from BAA, the airports operator,
by a consortium of Ayrshire business people and local authorities, chaired
by Lord Younger. It now belongs to PIK Holdings, a company named after
Prestwick's international call-sign.
Although there are no passenger flights, Prestwick has substantial air
freight business. Federal Express, the US freight company, operates daily
services and has taken a 10 per cent stake in PIK. Air Canada and TNT also
use the freight terminal.
The airport is used by British Aerospace which builds aircraft at Prestwick
and owns the runway. Its pilot training college can generate hundreds of
daily air movements by trainer aircraft.
Ryder Systems, the US company, has a plant adjoining the airport that
overhauls aero-engines. The airport is used by Bond Helicopters. There is
also a naval air station, HMS Gannet, whose previous commander Mr Paddy
Healey left the Navy to become PIK's managing director. But that is about
all.
Mr Hudson, a Canadian lawyer who moved to Ayrshire, says: 'We've had to
reinvent the way an airport is managed. What we've done enables us to
survive and be profitable at a very low level of turnover.'
New working practices were brought in. PIK made all 71 BAA employees
redundant and built up a new workforce, re-hiring some of the former staff
and engaging new ones on different conditions. The number of unions was cut
from about eight to one. All 137 staff have to be able to perform at least
two jobs.
'The crash rescue team works on the apron, shifts luggage when necessary or
cuts the grass,' says Mr Hudson. 'My secretary sometimes goes and works in
the duty-free store when aircrew want to purchase anything.'
Instead of contracting out handling and other services, PIK has taken over
everything itself. 'We do all freight and passenger handling,' says Mr
Hudson. PIK has taken over air traffic control from a Civil Aviation
Authority subsidiary, and runs its own duty-free sales.
Holiday flights from Prestwick should start again next year. The tour
company Direct Holidays is to operate flights to destinations including
Florida, Turkey and the Algarve. PIK has also set up its own travel agency.
Prestwick believes it can compete successfully with Glasgow because it
charges airlines Pounds 15 less a passenger, due in part to its
cost-reduction programme. It can also offer much cheaper carparking for
travellers than Glasgow. 'We want to make Prestwick into Scotland's
favourite holiday airport,' says Mr Hudson.
Now that Ayrshire has to take responsibility for Prestwick the community is
pulling all the stops out.
One of the airport's long-standing weaknesses is that although the
Glasgow-Ayr railway passes little more than 100 yards from the terminal,
there is no railway station.
Now a station is likely to be built at a cost of Pounds 2m, financed with
help from Strathclyde Regional Council and Kyle and Carrick District
Council, which is already a shareholder in PIK.
British Rail is also expected to agree to a scheme giving free rail travel
to the airport to rail travellers from anywhere in Scotland who display a
ticket for a Prestwick flight.
Mr Hudson explains that BAA had no motivation to promote Prestwick because
it owned Glasgow and Edinburgh airports. He believes BAA normally made
annual operating losses of about Pounds 3m at Prestwick.
PIK says it made a profit in its first year of operations. 'The accounts are
not yet audited, but we should make pre-tax profits of between Pounds
600,000 to Pounds 800,000 for the year to March 31 on turnover of about
Pounds 4.5m,' says Mr Hudson.
'We made a profit in the first half and have already handed out Pounds 250
to each of our staff in profit-related pay,' he adds. 'This is a community
endeavour.'
Even sceptics believe that whatever the next few years hold for Prestwick,
the airport's long-term survival is assured.
A politician involved with the airport explains: 'It will be politically
impossible ever to build a new runway at Glasgow. So when Glasgow eventually
runs out of space, Prestwick will come into its own.'
