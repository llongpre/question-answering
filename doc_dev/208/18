FT  06 FEB 92 / BAA launches programme to improve services at Glasgow
airport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the airports operator, launched a Pounds 60m investment programme
yesterday to improve international passenger services at Glasgow airport.
The development will be the second stage in the extension and improvement of
the airport. The first stage, also costing Pounds 60m, is due to be
completed in June to provide 70 per cent more space for passengers.
The second stage will include an international pier for up to eight widebody
airliners, taxiways and aprons and an extension to the terminal to improve
international passenger services. Work is to be completed by 1996.
Glasgow has seen an increase in international traffic after the government's
'open skies' policy for Scotland, introduced in 1990. Last year more than 4m
passengers went through Glasgow, of whom almost half were international
travellers. The expansion programme will increase annual capacity from 5.5m
passengers to 10m.
BAA is negotiating the sale of Prestwick airport, Ayrshire. International
traffic has fallen there and switched to Glasgow because of the 'open skies'
policy.
