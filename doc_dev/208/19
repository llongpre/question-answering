One cannot question the loyalty of George Younger, the former defence
secretary. Who else would prefer to adopt the title of an obsolete Scottish
airport rather than some pretty glen?
Lord Younger of Prestwick, as he will soon be known, has always been
uncommonly faithful to the under-utilised airport in his former constituency
of Ayr. In the 18 years he was an MP, he led the lobby which persuaded the
government to keep Prestwick's monopoly on transatlantic flights to and from
Scotland.
Because the airport was highly inconvenient for much of the Scottish
population, its traffic dwindled to the point when on some winter days there
were no passenger flights at all; the development of air services from
Scotland was retarded by a decade, often to the benefit of airports like
Manchester.
However, Younger lost his battle in 1990 when the government finally allowed
neighbouring Glasgow to break Prestwick's transatlantic monopoly.
As a result BAA sold Prestwick earlier this year to a consortium, backed by
the local authority, with Younger a prime mover.
Prestwick is now developing its freight business and hoping for the day when
Glasgow becomes too congested. However, if Prestwick really proves a white
elephant, Younger won't necessarily be tagged for life. He should eventually
succeed to his father's title Viscount Younger of Leckie, the name of the
family home, a long, long way from Prestwick.
