   Perhaps it's a sign of better times in
tough old Glasgow that this year's biggest uproar was about the
past.
   Critics attacked an exhibition about the city's 800 years, which
stressed its relations with the world, for ``sanitizing history.''
   Glasgow's Glasgow, as it was called, closed Nov. 5 and was the
city's biggest attraction in 50 years, drawing half a million
visitors. The show may have lost more than $8 million in a 30-week
run, which the city will have to cover.
   City Hall will announce the cost in February when it presents
the entire bill for the city's year as the European Capital of
Culture.
   The exhibition, promoted as ``Everything Glasgow gave to the
world ... and more,'' was the centerpiece of the year-long festival
celebrating the title bestowed by culture ministers of the
12-nation European Community. Athens, Florence, Amsterdam, Berlin
and Paris were chosen in earlier years.
   Jill Campbell Mackay, public relations director for the cultural
year, said the title Glasgow's Glasgow ``meant how the city
perceived itself as perceived by the outside world.''
   Under 22 arches of storage space below the central railway
station, unused for 60 years, the show assembled 3,200 artifacts of
history, industry and social life.
   They ranged from a model of the yacht Shamrock V, with which
Glasgow grocery tycoon Sir Thomas Lipton made five unsuccessful
tries for the America's Cup, to the suitcase of an emigrant who
paid 2 pounds (then $10) for passage to Canada in the 1920s.
   Documentary films lauded Glasgow's greatness as the second city
of the British Empire, an industrial cornucopia that poured out
textiles, locomotives, weapons and, by 1913, about 60 percent of
the world's ships.
   ``I think the exhibition was a great success,'' said Robert
Palmer, director of the cultural year. ``A space which was dripping
wet, unusable and derelict was renovated, and that space and the
new Arches Theater there seem certain to become a permanent part of
the city's life.''
   An unusual partnership of business and a socialist council
budgeted 50 million pounds ($80 million when the year began) to
make Cultural Capital 1990 a success. About $7 million went for
Glasgow's Glasgow.
   Commercial sponsors contributed cash, materials and assistance
valued at about $1.2 million.
   U.S. Ambassador Henry E. Catto visited the show June 20 and
called it the ``most imaginative exhibition of its kind I have ever
seen.''
   Sniper fire was aimed at it regularly, however, by the daily
Glasgow Herald and Workers' City, a group of left-wing and
anarchist writers, poets, folk musicians and workers. The 60 or so
active Workers' City members champion the class struggle against
what they regard as Glasgow's yuppie ascendancy.
   Glasgow is renowned for fierce partisanship. Alone among British
cities, it is regarded as having come close to revolution - in
1919, during a general strike.
   The red flag was raised in George Square when 20,000
demonstrators demanded a 40-hour work week. While the sheriff read
them the Riot Act, ordering them to disperse, a bottle hit him on
the head. Forty people were seriously injured when horse and foot
police charged the crowd.
   A photograph of tanks and troops assembled at the Cattle Market
was part of Glasgow's Glasgow.
   Although unemployment remains above 14 percent, the cultural
capital designation recognized Glasgow's self-regeneration from
industrial blight, slums, ill health and violence to a humming
center of commerce, tourism and the arts.
   The poor have been moved out of the city center and their
tenements demolished, but to Workers' City they are no better off
in the bleak, damp tower blocks erected for them on Glasgow's
periphery.
   ``We have been accused of being pro-poverty, but it isn't
true,'' said Brendan McLaughlin, owner of the Scotia Bar, where
Workers' City meets.
   ``In the interests of privatizing Glasgow and presenting it as a
place without problems, the Glasgow's Glasgow exhibition buries our
history of industrial struggle.''
   John Murray, the show's marketing executive, said: ``We had the
slums, the drink, the gambling, the crime, the sickness and death
alongside the shipyards, the factories, the scientists and the new
industries.''
   In hopes of making a profit, Glasgow District Council set an
admission charge of 4 pounds (then $6.50) when the show opened in
April.
   After public and press criticism, the price was reduced in July
to a pound (about $1.60). Total attendance was 501,105, largest for
such a show in Glasgow since the Empire Exhibition of 1938
attracted 12{ million visitors from around the world. That one lost
money, too.
   ``No exhibition makes money, but the cost of subsidizing
Glasgow's Glasgow was only half the cost of others in Europe,''
said Doug Clelland, the architect who devised it.
   Clelland is proud of the exhibition's appeal. ``We did three
exit surveys and found 30 percent of the people visiting it had
never before set foot in a museum or gallery,'' he said.
