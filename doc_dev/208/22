Scotland's new National Gallery

The room was designed to seat 250; in the event, 1,000 turned up. University
lecturers in tweed jackets stood alongside old ladies in mackintoshes, young
women tending babies and at least one judge of the court of session at the
meeting earlier this week to protest against the decision by the National
Galleries of Scotland to locate a new gallery not in the Scottish capital,
but in Glasgow.
It was the climax of a controversy which has been the chief talking point of
Scotland's chattering classes since early December. Each day there have been
broadsides in the letters and features pages of The Scotsman. Last week its
Glasgow rival The Herald devoted four pages to the issue. Next week it will
be debated in the House of Lords.
The controversy involves not just art but Scottish nationalism and the
perpetual rivalry of Scotland's two biggest cities.
It concerns a plan to create a National Gallery of Scottish Art, intended to
tell the history of Scotland and its art. It will take paintings by Scottish
artists from two Edinburgh galleries, the National Gallery of Scotland on
The Mound, and the Gallery of Modern Art. It will also absorb the entire
Scottish National Portrait Gallery, also in Edinburgh, which will close. The
new institution will be built at Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow.
The idea of creating a National Gallery of Scottish Art was launched in 1991
by Timothy Clifford, the ebullient Englishman who is director of the
National Galleries of Scotland, and by Angus Grossart, the terse merchant
banker who is chairman of the galleries' trustees.
It sprang from a desire to relieve the serious shortage of space in the
Edinburgh galleries, which means that paintings by Scottish artists have to
be taken down to provide space for exhibitions, while hundreds of Scottish
paintings lie in store.
The Portrait Gallery's collection of paintings of leading Scotsmen and women
over the centuries would form the nucleus of the new gallery, blended with
other paintings by Scottish artists such as Raeburn, Wilkie and Cadell from
the National Gallery and the Gallery of Modern Art. It would tell the
history of Scotland visually. Landscape paintings would illustrate
Scotland's geology and topography.
At the time Clifford said Edinburgh was the most logical place for the new
gallery, but added: 'It is up to Glasgow to come up with wonderful
proposals. We are ready to be seduced.'
That is exactly what happened. Whereas Edinburgh reacted sluggishly, Glasgow
with typical assertiveness offered the trustees several locations, promised
to lend the new gallery some of its best paintings and commissioned
architects such as Sir Norman Foster and Terry Farrell to produce designs.
Glasgow consistently made the running: a consultants' study showed that on
economic grounds Glasgow was the best location: the sites were cheaper, the
population was bigger and the existing Kelvingrove art gallery and museum
had higher attendances than the Edinburgh galleries.
The ten trustees repeatedly postponed a decision. But in the end the
economic arguments for Glasgow, reinforced by the knowledge that the
trustees represent Scotland rather than Edinburgh (several of them come from
Glasgow) made Kelvingrove inevitable. It was announced on November 30.
People in Edinburgh reacted with horror to what had happened. The decision
meant that some of the best-loved paintings would leave Edinburgh for
Glasgow. Raeburn's famous picture of the Reverend Robert Walker skating on
Duddingston Loch - which the gallery uses as its logo - would go for some
years to Kelvingrove.
The rights and wrongs of a National Gallery of Scottish Art had been debated
intermittently since 1991. Now the arguments against it came pouring out.
They boil down to two.
First, the new institution would mean herding Scottish art into a ghetto. As
Julian Spalding, director of Glasgow's Art Galleries, said in 1991 (he has
since changed his mind) the most successful galleries in other countries try
to cross-fertilise the art of different nations rather than separating them
into compartments.
By the same token it would severely weaken the National Gallery. Though the
gallery has listed those Scottish paintings that will stay, art historian
Duncan Macmillan says the Scottish collections should be the heart of the
National Gallery. 'Without them it becomes the National Gallery of Nowhere
in Particular, or perhaps the International Gallery of Anywhere Else but
Scotland.'
Secondly, the new institution means destroying the Portrait Gallery, created
in 1889 and one of only three in the world. Paul Scott, a leading
campaigner, calls it one of the most treasured possessions of the Scottish
people: it should be kept intact and remain in the Scottish capital. It is
this which arouses the strongest feelings.
At this week's public meeting Clifford defended his plan and Spalding
pricked a few consciences when he asked: 'If the Portrait Gallery was
closing and if Edinburgh had been successful in the bid it made (to have the
new gallery) would you all be here tonight?'
Edinburgh campaigners say they do not object to a new gallery being built
somewhere else, even Glasgow, but with a different configuration. But they
voted overwhelmingly for the trustees to reconsider or resign. None of the
trustees was present.
Yet even if the trustees stick to their decision it is far from certain that
the new gallery will go ahead. The Scottish Office has said that it will not
contribute to the Pounds 20m cost. Glasgow may stand a better chance than
Edinburgh of qualifying for EU funding but this is far from certain.
Grossart talks of tapping private donors and getting money from the National
Lottery or the Millennium Fund. But it is difficult to believe that the
government, which will control those funds, would direct them to a project
which so many people oppose.
Increasingly eyes are turning to Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary. He has
the final say and could veto the scheme or order a review. To many people,
possibly including some of the trustees, that might come as a relief.
