FT  05 FEB 93 / Nestle job sweetener in Dijon is a bitter taste for Glasgow

DIJON is getting its own back on Glasgow. In an ironic reversal of Hoover's
switch of jobs from the French town to Glasgow, another multinational is to
close the bulk of its Scottish plant and indirectly move jobs to Dijon.
Nestle Rowntree, the Swiss-owned food conglomerate, said yesterday it would
close the chocolate bar production part of its plant in Glasgow over the
next two years with the loss of 550 jobs. The production of its Breakaway
and Blue Riband brands will be relocated to the company's Fawdon plant near
Newcastle upon Tyne.
As a result, the company will move UK production of its Lion bar from
Newcastle upon Tyne to its new Dijon plant where the European production of
Lion will be concentrated on a large, technically advanced production line.
Nestle Rowntree said it would look for a buyer for the 140-year-old Glasgow
plant, which would continue to make Gray Dunn chocolate biscuits. If a buyer
could not be found, the plant would be closed. The announcement came less
than a fortnight after Hoover's decision to shut its Dijon vacuum cleaner
plant and shift production to Glasgow.
Union leaders in Scotland last night denounced the Nestle Rowntree move as a
political manoeuvre to placate the French.
'I would need a lot of convincing that this is pure coincidence,' said Mr
John Glass, deputy divisional officer in Glasgow of the Union of Shop,
Distributive and Allied Workers, whose members will lose jobs as a result of
the Nestle Rowntree plant closure.
Mr Mick Casey, a company spokesman said: 'I cannot stress strongly enough
that there have been no political trade-offs. The Dijon connection is pure
coincidence. We have to make our products as competitively as possible.'
A spokesman for the parent company in Switzerland said: 'We are not in
business to satisfy the national ego of anybody. We are here to make money.'
He added that the decision to close the Glasgow plant originated in 1990
when the company closed its Noisiel plant outside Paris and moved to Dijon
to 'take advantage of economies of scale'.
Nestle Rowntree will shortly announce that it is moving the production of
Quality Street chocolate from Dijon to Halifax in the west riding of
Yorkshire. The company insists there will be no overall loss of jobs in the
complex shifting of production.
Mr Glass said the union was told of the Glasgow closure in a letter at 2pm
yesterday. 'There is no justifiable reason for closing the Glasgow plant. We
intend to fight it all the way,' he said.
Mr Graham Millar, the company's UK managing director, said: 'Everyone at
Glasgow has worked extremely hard to try to ensure the factory's viability
but Nestle Rowntree has to remain competitive and that means fully utilising
our more modern facilities at other locations.'
Nestle Rowntree will provide Pounds 250,000 in assistance to help their
Glasgow workers who are to lose their jobs.
