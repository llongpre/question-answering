FT  15 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Glasgow versus Glyndebourne

<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest David Murray's review of the new Glyndebourne
production of Mozart's Don Giovanni (Arts, July 12). The last time elements
of this audience voiced noisy disapproval also involved a Mozart piece -
Peter Sellars' version of Die Zauberflote. When this production came to
Glasgow in 1990, however, it received a most enthusiastic welcome at the
city's Theatre Royal.
It is to be hoped that director Deborah Warner will take heart from this. An
imaginative treatment of a much-loved Mozart masterpiece, even if
controversial, may find a more sympathetic reception from a different
audience.
Perhaps Ms Warner should persuade Glyndebourne Touring Opera to take her Don
Giovanni into its repertoire. I live in hope that she might measure the
reaction of the opera lovers of Glasgow against the louts of Glyndebourne.
