FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (1): Alive and kicking - After stemming the decline
of the 1960s and 1970s, Glasgow is fighting to avoid the worst of the
present recession. At the same time, it is trying to create and consolidate
a new basis for its future prosperity

GLASGOW last winter formally sent into retirement its famous slogan
Glasgow's Miles Better, which, enlivened with the cheery face of Mr Happy,
had for a decade been pasted to the side of buses in both Glasgow and
London, and, translated into foreign languages, taped proudly to the luggage
of Glaswegians travelling abroad.
The decision to drop the slogan was a symbolic moment of transition. It
showed that Glasgow thinks the world has now accepted that it has pulled
itself out of the decline to which it seemed to be condemned in the 1960s
and 1970s, and that it is time for the next stage in the city's recovery.
Yet there seems to be a widespread realisation in the city that the next
stage is not likely to be particularly easy, nor are its outlines very
clear. The greater sobriety of the new slogan, Glasgow's Alive, (said to be
more convenient than its predecessor for putting on to almost any document
originating in Glasgow) has a durability that may be required during the
long haul ahead.
The revival of Glasgow has so far been one of the success stories of urban
regeneration in Britain. In the 1970s the economic base of this once great
shipbuilding and manufacturing city was declining at an alarming rate; its
population fell by 33 per cent between 1961 and 1981, not just through
organised dispersal to new towns but by emigration motivated by despair. The
city had an intimidating reputation for grime and crime.
A turning point came in 1975 when the new Strathclyde regional council
persuaded the government to abandon the creation of another Scottish new
town and divert the money to the regeneration of the decayed east end of the
city. Gradually a coalition of forces - the Scottish Development Agency, the
Labour controlled regional and district councils and the private sector -
developed a strategy for recovery, which involved pouring in very large
quantities of public money. Much of this came from a Pounds 350m EC
integrated development grant negotiated by Strathclyde regional council.
Glasgow was perforce to become a largely post-industrial city, concentrating
on developing its service activities. The initial aim was to improve the
centre of the city, not least by property development, new retail complexes
and extensive stone-cleaning, making the centre one of the main generators
of wealth.
Glasgow would also exploit its already strong cultural assets to become a
tourist destination and develop its distinguished university base to become
an exporter of graduates and knowledge.
What made the policy work was the existence of a form of collective
leadership that was lacking in Liverpool, a city with comparable problems,
which took such a different path to Glasgow in the 1980s. Glasgow's Labour
politicians became almost Conservative in their fiscal rectitude and grasp
of commercial reality; the city's business leaders are committed people who
for the most part live in the city rather than escaping to the countryside
in the evening.
The landmarks of revival are the Glasgow's Miles Better slogan which struck
a happy note with Glaswegians when it was launched in 1983 ('people just
flooded into the City Chambers to pick up the stickers,' says Mrs Jean
McFadden, leader of the district council); the Glasgow Garden Festival of
1988; and the city's year as European City of Culture in 1990, which
culminated in the opening of the Pounds 28.5m Royal Concert hall.
Yet despite all the achievements, unemployment in Glasgow never dropped
below 14 per cent in the recent upturn and has lately risen to 15.5 per
cent, with no less than 21.6 per cent of the male workforce out of work.
Manufacturing is still declining despite the fact that Glasgow has some good
engineering and shipbuilding companies: it now occupies only 16 per cent of
the work force.
The population is still falling, although the drop from 765,000 in 1981 to
654,000 in the 1991 census may have been exaggerated by as much as 35,000 by
poll tax non-payers not registering in the census.
Above all, while the centre and the west end of Glasgow are now rather
smart, and surrounding areas like the east end, Govan and even the Gorbals
are improving, there are still great areas of wretched accommodation,
poverty and misery in the peripheral areas of Easterhouse, Drumchapel,
Castlemilk and Pollok.
Last year, the Scottish Development Agency was wound up and replaced with a
network of local enterprise companies under the umbrella of the new Scottish
Enterprise. Glasgow gained the Glasgow Development Agency, which has a
budget this year of Pounds 67m to spend on training, property and
environmental improvement and assistance to business.
Mr Stuart Gulliver, its thoughtful, chain-smoking chief executive, exudes
what the agency calls the 'new mature realism' about Glasgow. 'Any
turnaround of a city like Glasgow takes about 25 years, a full generation.
So far we've done 10 years and transformed the urban landscape, laying a
patina of improvement across the city. There's far more to be done.'
He is frustrated that the recession, which came late to Glasgow, is putting
a brake on development and forcing businesses to concentrate on survival
rather than long-term improvement. He admits that the agency's prime target
group among the city's 50,000 unemployed has to be the top 30 per cent -
'the walking wounded who have their work ethic intact'.
He fears that the bottom 30 per cent - 'second or third generation
unemployed, living in a world of drugs and crime' - are beyond reach of an
organisation like the GDA.
About these people Mr Robin Boyle, formerly at Strathclyde university's
centre of planning, wrote recently: 'Glasgow's poor are simply no longer
part of the city. In economic, political or social terms, their alienation
from urban life is almost complete.
'Years of isolation bred hopelessness; the reponse of the very poorest has
been to withdraw into a personal world of survival, far removed from city
centre renewal, waterfront housing and new shopping centres.'
Mrs McFadden, who recently replaced the powerful Mr Pat Lally as Labour
leader on the council, voices a similar anxiety. 'I've always said Glasgow's
Miles Better only referred to the centre of the city. It was a sick joke for
people living in damp houses in Easterhouse.'
Like many leading people in the city she expresses a longing for a revival
of manufacturing in Glasgow. The great expansion of jobs in services, she
says, is 'very worrying because these jobs do not pay as well as those in
manufacturing, tend to involve women rather than men and, especially in
tourism, are vulnerable to recession'.
Where does Glasgow go now? The city council and the GDA have formed a strong
partnership which will continue the strategy of developing service
industries such as tourism, and attracting more companies to set up branch
or head offices in the city, and, it is hoped, factories.
Mr Gulliver says a long term policy of upgrading skills and performance
throughout the businesses of the city is essential.
Michael Kelly, who as Lord Provost launched the Glasgow's Miles Better
campaign and now runs a public relations agency while also advising other
British cities on how to stage recovery, believes a big new initiative is
needed to succeed the garden festival and the city of culture ventures.
'I've suggested we celebrate the ending of World War two, possibly in
conjunction with other European cities'.
He rejects the idea that this approach to reviving a city is purely cosmetic
and does not produce lasting effects. 'Why do women use cosmetics? Because
they are effective.'
But the calm Mrs McFadden says Glasgow no longer needs spectacular new
events to follow up the garden festival and the city of culture year. 'We
don't need a big event every so often any more. A lot of the groundwork of
recovery has been done. What Glasgow needs now is constant marketing to
proclaim our advantages and attract both visitors and companies.'
