Northwest Airlines is to end its non-stop daily service between Glasgow and
Boston from October 25. It says it has been losing money because of excess
capacity on transatlantic services from Glasgow and low yields due to
insufficent business passengers.
Northwest's withdrawal after 14 years is the second blow to transatlantic
services from Glasgow within weeks. Last month American Airlines said it
would not operate its daily Chicago service between November and mid-May.
Northwest offers alternative services for Scottish travellers from London
Gatwick and Schiphol, Amsterdam, connecting with Air UK.
