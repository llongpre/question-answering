You are in Glasgow, with an hour between meetings. What to do?
Dr William Hunter has an assured place in medical history as a famous
obstetrician and the first great teacher of anatomy in Britain. Even Adam
Smith, Edmund Burke and Edward Gibbon went to his lectures. His wide-ranging
collections of specimens, coins and medals, and his fine library of books
and manuscripts, have enriched the University of Glasgow, while his
paintings form the nucleus of the Hunterian Art Gallery, one of the choicest
of all university collections.
Thanks are due to the doctor for the three magnificent paintings by the
incomparably subtle Jean-Simeon Chardin: A Lady Taking Tea, The Cellar Boy
and The Scullery Maid. But the real strength of the Hunterian focuses on the
turn of this century, and the influential Glasgow architect and designer
Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the American-born artist James McNeill
Whistler.
The windows and front door from the long-demolished Mackintosh House in
Glasgow were incorporated into the facade of the new museum in 1980, and its
four principal interiors carefully reconstructed as Mackintosh originally
conceived them. Bequests of furniture and other applied arts, drawings and
designs have made the museum the pre-eminent Mackintosh archive.
The Whistler holding - the contents of his studio at his death - comprises
some 80 oils, including 11 full-length portraits, 120 pastels and several
hundred prints and drawings. Its only rival is the Freer Gallery in
Washington.
