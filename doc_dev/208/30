   A university professor wanted in the
stabbing death of a student he coached on the debate team wrote a
letter admitting to the killing, police said.
   A murder warrant was issued Monday for William Lee Slagle, 42, a
Samford University professor sought in the Sept. 21 slaying of
20-year-old Rex B. Copeland, Shelby County Sheriff Buddy Glasgow
said.
   Authorities received a handwritten letter Monday in which Slagle
admitted killing Copeland, Glasgow said.
   ``He sort of apologized about what had happened,'' he said.
   The pair had argued about preparation for a debate in Iowa,
Glasgow said. Slagle ``didn't feel like he was studying enough,''
the sheriff said.
   ``I know these folks are serious about their debating and it
could lead to a heated argument,'' Glasgow said, ``but it doesn't
sound like something worth killing for, does it? I think there'd be
more to it.''
   Copeland was found dead in his apartment Sept. 22. He had been
stabbed several times in the chest.
   Investigators have been trying for about a week to question
Slagle, and have been told he left town, Glasgow said. His mother
lives in San Antonio and he has a brother in Dallas, the sheriff
said.
