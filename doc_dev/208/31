<HEAD>Jumbo Jet Diverted Because Of Fear Of Luggage Tampering</HEAD>

   A Toronto-bound jumbo jet with 214 people on board
made an emergency landing at Glasgow Airport after a passenger said
she thought someone had tampered with her luggage in the hold,
police and airline officials said today.
   ``It was a false alarm,'' said Glasgow Police Inspector Robert
Nicholson. ``There was a bit of concern, but everything turned out
to have a happy ending.''
   The British Airways jet took off from London's Heathrow Airport
at 4:45 p.m. Friday and had been airborne an hour when a Canadian
passenger told a flight attendant she was worried that her checked
luggage had been tampered with before she boarded a connecting BA
flight in Cairo, the airline said.
   Airline spokesman Bill Burchill said the flight attendant
informed the captain, who decided to turn back and make an emergency
landing.
   The Boeing 747 jet was about 30 minutes over the Atlantic at the
time and had to dump fuel before touching down in Glasgow at 7:45
p.m., he said.
   After the jet landed, inspector Nicholson said all baggage on the
plane was isolated, examined ``and found to be in order.'' The
airline said there were 197 passengers and a crew of 17.
   The plane took off from Glasgow at 9:35 p.m. without the woman
and her two companions, who spent the night at a local hotel to help
police complete their inquiries, Burchill said.
   The woman, who was not identified, and her friends were expected
to fly to Toronto today on a British Airways flight from London, he
said.
   ``The woman felt a certain amount of disquiet,'' Burchill said.
``We have no idea at all why she waited until the plane was
airborne'' to inform the airline of her concern.
   Flight 093 landed safely in Toronto, he said.
