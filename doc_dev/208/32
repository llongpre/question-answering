Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary and Edinburgh MP, yesterday joined
objections to last month's decision by the National Galleries of Scotland to
move much of its collection to a new gallery in Glasgow.
He said that aspects of the plan were 'unacceptable and do not deserve
public support'.
The National Galleries of Scotland intends to create a gallery of Scottish
art in Glasgow. It would display many of the paintings by Scottish artists
now in the National Gallery and the National Gallery of Modern Art in
Edinburgh. It would also feature all the paintings in the Scottish National
Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, as well as pictures not currently on display.
When the new gallery was proposed in 1991 there was no suggestion of it
being anywhere but Edinburgh. But Glasgow offered accommodation more cheaply
and consultants said a Glasgow gallery would receive more visitors.
The plan has been attacked by leading figures in Edinburgh. Mr Ian Lang, the
Scottish secretary, has said the government will not contribute to its
Pounds 20m cost.
Mr Rifkind attacked the plan because it would entail removing the most
important Scottish paintings from the National Gallery and closing the
Scottish National Portrait Gallery.
