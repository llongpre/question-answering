As anticipated, Glasgow has won the battle with Edinburgh to house the new
National Gallery of Scottish Art. It will rise in Kelvingrove Park and
should be ready in time for the Millennium. Indeed Millennium money,
directed via the national lottery, will be expected to provide much of the
Pounds 25m cost.
The National Gallery of Scottish Art will provide a home for a national
collection of pictures, decorative arts, and other objects associated with
the Scottish heritage. It will give expression to Scottish national feeling
and be the Scotland's project to celebrate the Millennium.
Glasgow won the fiercely fought contest with Edinburgh for the site mainly
because a consultants report suggested it would attract more visitors, some
750,000 a year. It was also successful because its local council fought
harder for the project. At the start, Edinburgh actually wanted to charge
the trustees Pounds 3m for their preferred local site, Dean Lodge, opposite
the Gallery of Modern Art.
In response Glasgow offered a choice of five locations, all free, and
promised loans to the new Gallery of its Charles Rennie Mackintosh
interiors, and works by the early 20th artists, the Glasgow Boys. It also
suggested that a site in Glasgow might attract an EC grant of Pounds 10m.
Among the architects with plans for the new Museum is Richard Rodgers.
Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries, welcomed the choice.
'It will be the most exciting development for the visual arts in Scotland.'
He will use the extra gallery space to show some of the 70 per cent of stock
usually kept in the vaults. However paintings by the leading Scottish
artists, such as Ramsay and Raeburn, will still hang in the National Gallery
on the Mound in Edinburgh.
The choice of Kelvingrove puts a question mark over the future of the
National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. It will be expected to provide many
of its most popular pictures, and might seek a new role as a gallery devoted
to photography, sculpture or architecture.
