</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ryanair, the independent Irish airline, is to operate flights between Dublin
and Glasgow using Prestwick, the privately owned airport in Ayrshire which
has had no scheduled flights since 1991.
The twice daily flights in each direction will be priced at much less than
the Aer Lingus services between Dublin and Glasgow's Abbotsinch airport.
