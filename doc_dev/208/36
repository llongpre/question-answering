ON THE face of it, Cardiff seems to have plenty of hotels.
If you emerge from Central station and look skywards slightly to the right,
your eyes are met by the masthead of the Holiday Inn (182 rooms). It is
unusual to see a Holiday Inn in a British city centre: they tend to be built
on the periphery of towns, close to motorways.
Two hundred yards from the Holiday Inn, past the ice rink, is the
International Hotel (143 rooms), built by Brent Walker at a cost of Pounds
7.5m, and opened last September.
If, instead of crossing St Mary's Street to the Holiday Inn in Mill lane,
you turn left down St Mary's Street, you quickly come to the Royal Hotel (63
rooms). Continue past St David's Hall, and you come to the Angel Hotel (91
rooms). Situated between Cardiff Castle and the Arms Park rugby ground, the
Angel describes itself as the city's premier hotel.
Close by is the Park Hotel (119 rooms) and the Crest Hotel (157 rooms).
Farther out, near to the motorway, are the Post House (150 rooms) and the
Moat House (144 rooms).
All of these are three- or four-star hotels. Most could be described as new
'business' or old 'town' hotels. They all charge between Pounds 50 and
Pounds 80 a night.
If a couple of places not mentioned are included, the total number of
bedrooms in quality hotels is around 1,000 to 1200. If one were to include
two-star hotels, Cardiff probably has some 6,000 rooms available.
How much accommodation does a city need? Albeit a capital city, though one
which is not yet an established business-and-services centre, nor on the
well-mapped circuit for cultural and heritage tourists? For the moment, the
answer would seem to be: about what it has got.
The occupancy rate of the Holiday Inn, for example, is 70 per cent, spread
through the week. It is full of business people during weekdays, while
weekends are a moveable feast. If there happens to be a rugby international
at Cardiff Arms park, the hotel is full to overflowing; if there is not, it
can be empty.
According to Jack Nicholas, general manager of the Holiday Inn, a good
weekend trade was beginning to build in family tourists taking advantage of
heavily discounted room prices. But this was thwarted by the Gulf war and
the recession. The past few months have seen a decline in weekend bookings.
Most of Cardiff's other quality hotels probably have occupancy rates similar
to that of the Holiday Inn, though the International Hotel has an occupancy
rate of 50 per cent, being a new hotel still building up business.
If supply seems to be roughly in line with current demand, the situation
could soon change, even though a Copthorne hotel is being built, for Cardiff
has aspirations to become both an important business-and-services centre and
a cultural tourist city, in the manner of York, Chester or even Glasgow.
For most people, the transformation to a services or business city is linked
with the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. When the barrage is built
across the bay, Cardiff could become a maritime city with some 5m sq ft of
extra office space, many tourist and leisure facilities, and 30,000 new jobs
in buildings that will be put up on what is now largely derelict land. The
development corporation believes it will be 10 to 15 years before these
targets are realised.
Before then, other developments could ensure a greater demand for hotel
rooms. Opposite the International Hotel is the half-finished World Trade
Centre, being developed by Brent Walker. Technical problems have delayed its
completion. But with a city grant and a soft loan from the European
Investment Bank, it should now be finished by the middle of next year.
It will have exhibition space and conference facilities for 5,000 people.
Brent Walker also bought the ice rink in 1989. It has managed to change its
use designation (though it is home to a successful ice-hockey team, which
will continue to use it), and it can now be covered over and used, for
example, for rock concerts. It seats 4,000. Despite Brent Walker's well
publicised financial problems of the past year, these projects are
proceeding, and will mean a greater demand for hotel space.
So, too, may the efforts being made by Cardiff Marketing, a private company
supported by local councils and the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. The
thought underlying Cardiff Marketing's efforts is that, if Glasgow can be
publicised into life, then why not Cardiff? It is, after all, a capital city
with a rich cultural identity.
It is estimated that 2m visitors went to Cardiff last year, but fewer than
100,000 went to tourist centres for information. The potential is therefore
considerable. The city may even get a five-star hotel.
