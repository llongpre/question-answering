FT  19 MAY 93 / People: Englishman goes to market for Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time, an Englishman is to become chairman of what remains of
the Glasgow stock exchange.
Anthony Vine-Lott, 45-year-old managing director of Barclays Stockbrokers,
is to succeed Robert White of the Edinburgh stockbroker Bell Lawrie White as
chairman of the Scottish regional advisory group of the London Stock
Exchange.
Glasgow is one of the more active of the dwindling number of regional
branches of the Stock Exchange. It has the only firms of market-makers
outside London (two of them) and handles most settlements for Glasgow-based
stockbrokers, such as Allied Provincial.
The exchange, which employs about 20 people, claims to be second only to
London in the volume of business it handles.
Meanwhile, Barclays Stockbrokers is probably the biggest user of the Glasgow
exchange. It employs about 300 people in the city and does all share
transactions for retail customers of the bank's branches, as well as
handling back office work for a number of regional stockbrokers.
It claims to transact 10 per cent of all retail business in the UK.
Vine-Lott is one of the new breed of stockbrokers who came into the business
from the technology side rather than from dealing, having been a senior
executive of Wang UK in the early 1980s.
He helped design an electronic dealing system for Barclays de Zoete Wedd
before becoming md of Barclays Stockbrokers in 1988.
But he only works two days a week in Glasgow, spending the rest of the week
in London, and his home is in Kent.
He sees the Scottish regional advisory group as 'a local lobby group
sponsored by the exchange' which should work as a conduit to pass
information to members of the stock exchange and to obtain their views to
pass back to London. He wants to widen the role of the committee to
represent the views of quoted Scottish companies and Scottish fund managers
on stock exchange matters.
