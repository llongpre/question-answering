THE most ardent supporter of C P Taylor would not claim Walter is one of his
best plays. One reason why it is included in the tribute to him in this
year's festival may be that the work pays homage to his native Glasgow.
Glasgow did not encourage Taylor as a playwright. It was the Traverse
Theatre in Edinburgh that discovered him. Afterwards he moved south to
Northumberland, where he wrote his best work. Still, Glasgow was a formative
influence.
Taylor was born there in 1927, the son of a Jewish family which had fled
from tsarist Russia. The Walter of the play is based on a music hall
comedian called Walter Jackson (originally Jacobson). Jackson, like Taylor,
had Jewish parents. He began performing in Glasgow in 1932.
After the war, Jackson became relatively well known beyond music hall. He
appeared in television soaps and did straight acting at the Glasgow
Citizens'. But just as his new career was taking off he died aged 60 in
1977.
The version that appears in a collection of the seven Taylor plays being
performed at this year's festival takes less than an hour to read, but
stretches to two and a half hours on-stage. For all the love and care that
have gone into Hamish Glen's production at the St Bride's Centre, it remains
heavy going.
Walter, the music hall comedian, is left far behind. The play is about the
sex life of a man who wonders how far he remains Jewish. He has left a
Jewish wife for a Jewish mistress, then abandoned her and is now living on
the banks of Loch Lomond with a young Gentile girl who speaks with a Geordie
accent. She wants him to move to Northumberland because the Scots do not
like the English crossing their border and Scotland is full of 'bloody Jews,
communists and film directors'.
The sex life does not seem very satisfactory; nor is the play. There is a
nice joke about Catholics being lovely when they are sober and terrible when
drunk, and Protestants the other way round. Tom Watson plays Walter with
tremendous determination and one admires Tracey Wilkinson as the Geordie
girl. But none of the cast is on fertile ground.
