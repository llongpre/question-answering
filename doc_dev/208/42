FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Jobs top Govan voters' concerns

UNEMPLOYMENT tops most voters' concerns in Govan, an inner-city district of
Glasgow with a large amount of run-down housing and drug-related crime.
Unemployment is 14.6 per cent, slightly better than elsewhere in Glasgow.
Govan is a marginal in a city of safe Labour seats. Mr Jim Sillars won the
seat for the Scottish National party in a 1988 by-election, overturning a
Labour majority of almost 20,000, shaking Labour out of complacency about
its hold over Glasgow. Mr Ian Davidson, a Strathclyde regional councillor,
is working hard to win the seat back this week. Both parties claim to offer
the best deal on jobs.
Glasgow has a history of sectarianism and Govan has slightly more Protestant
voters than Catholic. Traditionally, Catholic voters incline more towards
Labour than the SNP.
Mr Sillars predicts an increased SNP majority, Labour says it will take the
seat back, and the posters seem evenly divided. This is still a seat to
watch.
THE Church of Scotland yesterday entered the election debate with a strongly
worded attack on the government's social and economic record. The annual
report of the church and nation committee says the human cost of
unemployment is unacceptable and last year's comment by Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, that unemployment was 'a price worth paying' to bring down
inflation, was 'hollow and cynical."
