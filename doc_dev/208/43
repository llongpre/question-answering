BRITISH AIRWAYS is setting up a business to run its domestic regional
services called British Airways Regional. This follows agreement with BA's
unions to reduce annual staff costs on its regional network by Pounds 8.25m
from the beginning of next month.
BA said the cost-cutting package would improve profitability and safeguard
about 1,000 jobs in its domestic regional services based at Birmingham,
Manchester and Scotland.
The agreement comes after several months of negotiations. It does not
include BA's shuttle services between London Heathrow and Manchester,
Belfast, Glasgow and Edinburgh, as well as services between Heathrow,
Newcastle upon Tyne and Aberdeen and transatlantic services from Manchester
and Glasgow.
British Airways Regional will operate 23 BAe One-Eleven jet aircraft at
Birmingham and Manchester and 13 BAe ATP turboprops based in Scotland.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA's director of marketing and operations, said the launch
of British Airways Regional was a new phase in the company's short-haul
operations which marked a further 'significant step in BA's determination to
control costs'.
Up to 500 staff at the Swindon headquarters of Galileo, the international
travel booking network owned by a consortium of European airlines, could
lose their jobs after the company's merger with its US equivalent Apollo.
Mr Pieter Bouw, president of Galileo and chairman of KLM, the Dutch airline,
said yesterday that most of the cost savings after the merger would be
through job losses. He said that most of these would be in data processing
at Swindon.
Galileo said that 500 of the 800 staff at Swindon were 'technical'. The
remainder are in marketing.
The technical headquarters of the combined operation, which supplies
on-screen travel booking to more than 25,000 travel agents around the world,
will be in Denver, Colorado.
