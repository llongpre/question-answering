<F P=106> [Article by Rajeev Syal: "Killer Heroin Reaches London After </F>
Eight Die in Glasgow"] 
  [Text] A cache of heroin so powerful that police warn it 
could kill after a single "fix" has been found in London after 
similar batches have claimed the lives of addicts in other parts 
of Britain. 
  The new batch surfaced in Camden, north London, and is twice 
as strong as most heroin bought on the streets. Its discovery 
comes amid growing concern about a rise in the quantity and 
purity of heroin being sold around the country. 
  Last week, eight people died in Glasgow after using 
unusually 
pure forms of the drug. Nine have been killed in Bristol during 
the past six months in similar circumstances, and seven died 
last year in King's Cross, close to where the latest batch of 
heroin was found. 
  The discovery was reported by Release, the drug advice 
agency, which has been told by local counsellors that it is 64 
percent pure--street heroin is usually 35-40 percent pure. "The 
users have not got the tolerance for such high strength, and we 
see the tragic consequences," said Simon Kirkham, group 
spokesman. 
  Powerful drugs interfere with the part of the brain that 
controls breathing. Death arises from congestion in the lungs. 
  Police are trying to trace the source of the London batch, 
and said they were taking the threat it poses very seriously. It 
was found only three days after the latest death in Glasgow. 
  Police in Glasgow have offered an amnesty to people active 
in 
the drug world in an attempt to find the rest of the lethal 
batch, which they believe to be as much as 74 percent pure. 
  But drug counsellors and relatives of those who died in 
Glasgow dispute the official view that high-grade heroin is to 
blame. They insist that drug cocktails and overdoses may have 
killed many of the addicts. Two years ago Glasgow was the scene 
of 20 unexplained deaths which were blamed on high-quality 
heroin. 
  The National Criminal Intelligence Unit believes danger 
arises when inept or inexperienced drug dealers fail to mix 
heroin properly. "Some young dealers may not be used to handling 
the drug, which can be highly dangerous," a spokesman said. 
  In Bristol, laboratory tests last week showed that heroin 
believed to have caused at least four of the nine abuser deaths 
was 63 percent pure. Police fear the purity of the drug reflects 
the large amount of heroin in the British market. 
  Inspector Peter Wills, of Avon police, said drug dealers 
normally mixed the drug with similar looking substances such as 
baking powder, talcum or dried baby milk to maximise profits. 
"Whereas a street dealer would mix the drug with other 
substances if there is a drought--thus increasing his own 
profit--when there is a lot of heroin on the streets, they do 
not need to," he said. 
  Heroin seizures have increased dramatically throughout the 
country in the past year, particularly in Avon, Manchester, 
London and inner-city areas. In Gloucestershire there was a 400 
percent increase, while seizures went up by 600 percent in 
Northumbria and 1,000 percent in Nottinghamshire.
