Ewan Marwick, ceo of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, has died in a car crash in
Moscow. He was one of the best known figures in Scottish business.
Marwick, who was 41, had run the chamber since 1982. He was a high profile
figure, and an energetic lobbyist. He spearheaded a long-running campaign to
persuade the government to remove Prestwick airport's status as the sole
gateway for transatlantic flights from Scotland. The campaign was finally
won in 1990, against considerable opposition from some Conservative
ministers, and several new air services immediately began between Glasgow
airport and the US.
Marwick was also a leading campaigner to have non-domestic rates in Scotland
reduced to English levels. The government began harmonising Scottish and
English business rates in 1989, but Scotland's disadvantage has not yet been
eliminated.
In 1990 Marwick stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative party candidate in
the Paisley North by-election, and nurtured ambitions to go into national
politics.
Graduated in economics from Edinburgh university, he began his career
advising Shetland Islands Council, before joining the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors in Scotland as assistant secretary.
He was in Russia on a mission to advise the Rostov-on-Don region on economic
development.
