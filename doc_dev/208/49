FT  20 FEB 92 / Appointments: Glasgow smiles on part-time job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Edwin Glasgow QC has been appointed chairman of the financial reporting
review panel, the new watchdog of accounting standards, in place of Simon
Tuckey QC who has just become a high court judge.
Glasgow, 46, was called to the bar in 1969 and took silk in 1987; he is
known for tough but courteous cross-examination. His broad-based practice,
covering common law and commercial litigation, has brought him into the
public eye. He acted on behalf of the football clubs in the public inquiries
after both the Bradford fire in 1986 and the Hillsborough disaster in 1989;
he also represented Ernest Saunders in the DTI inquiry into the Guinness
affair in 1987, and is currently acting on behalf of the Chief Constable of
Surrey in the Guildford Four inquiry.
The part-time job as chairman of the review panel involves co-ordinating the
work of its 22 members, who scrutinise accounts which are at variance with
accepted standards and have the power to order directors to change faulty
accounts at their own expense.
The panel has recently made its presence felt by making comments on the
accounting policies of four British companies - Ultramar, Williams Holdings,
Shield Group and Forte - and writing to 240 more which have made minor
reporting errors.
Glasgow says that he is expecting a 'very busy first year and will give up
as much time as necessary to ensure the job is done thoroughly. In
appropriate cases, a firm but fair line will be taken.'
He may have developed a passion for accounting during actions for and
against a number of large accountancy firms. But he must hope that earlier
earnings will tide him over; his time on the panel will only provide an
honorarium believed to be a few thousand pounds a year.
