There has been bad news for users of transatlantic air services from
Scotland in the past few weeks. First, American Airlines announced that its
daily service from Glasgow to Chicago would in future only operate in the
summer. Flights would finish this year on November 2.
Next, Northwest Airlines said it was ending its daily Glasgow-Boston service
altogether on October 25, after flying from Scotland for 14 years.
These decisions reverse the gradual expansion of transatlantic services from
Glasgow that began in 1990, when the government stopped forcing
intercontinental flights to use Prestwick airport, 30 miles south-east of
Glasgow. At that time, American Airlines and British Airways, which had
refused to use Prestwick, launched services from Glasgow, with American
flying daily to Chicago and BA three times a week to New York. Northwest and
Air Canada moved to Glasgow from Prestwick, and last year United Airlines
began flying daily from Washington DC.
Aviation specialists believe the latest decisions to cancel flights reflect
airlines' determination to improve returns on their assets rather than seek
market share. American Airlines complained that, while summer holiday
traffic was good, there were not enough year-round business travellers to
give a satisfactory yield per seat and make the service profitable overall.
Northwest also blamed low yields, and claimed there was excess capacity on
transatlantic routes from Glasgow.
One difficulty is that business or first-class passengers do not necessarily
want to fly from their local airport. The convenience is offset by the fact
that there are a much greater number of transatlantic services from London's
Heathrow and Gatwick airports, giving passengers a range of options in case
of delay or cancellation. And many of these flights go direct to the
traveller's ultimate North American destination.
Mr Bob Buntin, Northwest's general manager for Scotland, says that its
Glasgow flights have had good capacity utilisation, but claims this is only
because fares are low. 'We have been trapped for some time at the low end of
the market,' he says.
BAA, which runs Glasgow airport, hopes to persuade the remaining year-round
transatlantic carriers, United, Air Canada and British Airways, to increase
their services to take up any slack. British Airways says it will increase
its frequency to New York from four flights a week to five, probably from
January.
