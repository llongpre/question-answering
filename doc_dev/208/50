FT  14 JAN 94 / People: Cicutto flies in to Glasgow for NAB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clydesdale Bank, the Glasgow-based clearing bank which is a subsidiary of
National Australia Bank, has appointed Frank Cicutto, a high-flyer from the
parent company, to replace Charles Love, the ceo who died just after
Christmas.
Cicutto, 43, is currently state manager for New South Wales and Australian
Territory, the largest unit in NAB, with more branches and greater assets
than Clydesdale. He took up office in Glasgow yesterday but will not move
from Sydney to Glasgow until the second half of February.
Love, who was 48, died suddenly during a skiing holiday in France. He had
been ceo at Clydesdale for little over a year having previously held senior
posts with TSB. He had recently launched a project to create two branch
banking processing centres and a telephone centre for the Clydesdale in
Scotland, a project which will involve up to 800 job losses but will not
mean closing branches.
Cicutto has been with NAB for 26 years. His recent appointments include
general manager of the group's credit bureau and head of the bank's US
operations, based in New York. He had not visited Scotland before this week.
Cicutto is the first Australian to be ceo of Clydesdale, which NAB acquired
in 1987 from the Midland Bank. All previous ceos have been British and there
are only a handful of Australians working in the bank. However, he says he
does not expect to encounter any hostility for not being Scottish and that
he intends to carry on with the strategy launched by Love. 'The direction is
very clear and I am very comfortable with it,' he says.
