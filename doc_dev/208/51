FT  06 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: Court has power in swap rate case -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has been asked to rule whether it has
jurisdiction to hear a case concerning the Brussels Convention on
Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments referred to it by the English
Appeal Court.
The case concerned interest rate swap contracts between Glasgow District
Council and Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank. In performance of the
contracts, Kleinwort Benson paid Glasgow District Council sums totalling
more than Pounds 800,000. After these payments, the House of Lords ruled
that local authorities such as Glasgow District Council did not have the
power to enter into such contracts.
In the light of the Law Lords judgment, Kleinwort Benson brought a High
Court action against Glasgow District Council for restitution of the sums
paid out under the swaps contracts.
The parties agreed the contracts were governed by English law, that England
was the place of performance and that it was the place where the harmful
event occurred. However, they were in dispute about which UK courts had
jurisdiction to hear the dispute.
Kleinwort Benson argued the English Courts should have jurisdiction. Glasgow
District Council claimed the Scottish Courts should hear the case.
The English High Court decided it did not have jurisidiction. Kleinwort
appealed and the Appeal Court referred the issue to the Luxembourg court.
The claims of both sides were based not on the Brussels Convention but on
the provisions of a schedule to the 1982 Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments
Act, which incorporates the Convention into UK law. One of the act's
provisions allows for questions relating to any Convention issue to be
referred to the ECJ.
Such a reference is not made under the Rome Treaty but under a 1971 Protocol
to the Brussels Convention. Because of this technicality, the issue of the
ECJ's jurisdiction to hear the case arose.
Both Glasgow District Council and Kleinwort together with the German and
Spanish governments argued the Court did have jurisdiction to give a ruling
on the questions referred to it.
Their arguments were based on the fact that the reference related to the
Convention; that even if it concerned the application of the internal
legislation of a member state, the national law in question referred to
provisions of Community law for which the ECJ had jurisdiction; that it was
necessary if there was to be a uniform application of Community law; and,
that the mere fact that the case concerned the assignment of jurisdiction
between courts in a single member state should not deprive the ECJ of its
jurisdiction.
However, the French and UK governments, together with the European
Commission argued the Court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the
reference. Their arguments included: the fact that the dispute did not
concern an international jurisdictional issue, but rather a conflict of
jurisdiction in one member state; that the reference was governed
exclusively by national law; and, that even if the Court did give a
preliminary ruling, the national court would not be bound by that ruling as
it would only be an advisory opinion and in such an event, it would be
ruling on questions of national law contrary to its own case law.
It was argued the Court's case law on the interpretation of Community law
applied by national legislation should be strictly construed and only apply
where the national law directly transposed the relevant Community law. That
was not the position in this case.
On the separate issue of which UK court should hear the dispute, Kleinwort
claimed that jurisdiction should be given to the English courts either
because England was the place of performance of the contracts or because it
was where the harmful event occurred. Glasgow District Council argued the
normal rule should apply, whereby people are sued in the part of the country
in which they are domiciled.
The advocate general's opinion is expected next year followed by a full
judgment of the ECJ.
