FT  07 DEC 94 / National Lottery could turn Post Office into art gallery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glasgow's main Post Office building could become a new national art gallery
for Scotland. The Pounds 25m cost could be paid for out of National Lottery
cash, and the gallery could open in 1999, the year of Glasgow's reign as the
UK City of Architecture and Design. The possibility emerged when the
National Galleries of Scotland yesterday set out options for a new gallery
in Glasgow
