FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Artistic row brews up - Off the Wall / The Edinburgh
Festival

WITH EIGHT days to go, the Edinburgh Festival is on line to be a commercial
success. But artistically it is still up for grabs.
Director Brian McMaster had a soft start last year when he presided over his
first Festival. Now the inevitable criticisms are starting. A lack-lustre
opening concert; a pretentious Peter Sellars production of The Persians;
doubt over the new works by featured composer James MacMillan - these are
nit-picking irritants.
But the row that McMaster has got into with the National Gallery of Scotland
is more serious. Every year, the National Gallery mounts its best shows to
coincide with the Festival. It has been included in the official Festival
programme and to most visitors is part of the festivities. When successful,
as the Ramsay exhibition was last year, the Festival gets some of the glory.
McMaster appears to be against the visual arts. He has suggested a separate
Visual Arts Festival. He refused to include the major National Gallery shows
this year, one devoted to Holbein, the other to the Russian avant-garde, in
his programme, even though the gallery pays for the privilege.
The National Gallery is furious. Fortunately, it is getting record
attendances for the Russian exhibition at the Gallery of Modern Art but it
cannot understand why McMaster does not make use of its great potential
contribution to the Festival. McMaster maintains he wants complete control
over the contents of the Festivals.
The spat this summer could be put down to inexperience. But there are
reports that McMaster is not interested in including the 1994 art shows
inside the official Edinburgh Festival brochure for next year. Since they
involve expensive and important exhibitions on late 19th century French
painting and German Romanticism, and seem sure to be popular, McMaster might
wisely think again and perhaps try to attract to the Festival events that
tie-in with these themes.
It is unfashionable to say that the arts in the UK have for the past
generation enjoyed a Golden Age, prompted in part by government funding that
has risen sharply ahead of inflation. If the Arts Council's budget is cut by
Pounds 5m next year (and Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke now presides over
such a large empire that he could easily switch funds to the arts if he
wished) it is a minimal cut compared with recent increases.
Of course, the arts must put pressure on Mr Brooke and defend their corner
but sometimes the crisis talk gets out of hand. Take Edinburgh, for example,
and Scotland generally. The success this year of the biggest arts festival
in the world hardly suggests imminent doom and the Scottish Arts Council is
in remarkably good heart. Here follows some good news.
Within 18 months the Lottery should be providing money for the arts. The SAC
reckons it could receive Pounds 6m of it, a sizeable improvement on its
current grant of Pounds 23m a year. It anticipates using the annual windfall
mainly for capital projects. But where?
The arts in Scotland are in the throes of an extraordinary building binge.
Glasgow recently got its international concert hall; the money has been
found for the new Festival Theatre in Edinburgh, which will open next spring
with the largest stage in the UK; the Traverse Theatre is new and sparkling,
as is the Citizens' Theatre in Glasgow. The Fruitmarket and the Tron are
among a whole array of art institutions that have recently been refurbished.
The Lottery money will easily be absorbed, in improving the Usher Hall, for
example, but no-one can pretend that the arts in Scotland are in extremis.
There are the inevitable squabbles - over the merger of two Scottish
symphony orchestras; whether Edinburgh or Glasgow should play home to yet
another new arts structure, the Museum of Scottish Art; but as the SAC
awaits its divorce from the Arts Council of Great Britain and becomes a
client of a supposedly-sympathetic Secretary of State for Scotland in Iain
Lang, it does seem as if one part of the UK is doing well by the arts.
Bill Burdett-Coutts who runs the Assembly Rooms, the biggest venue on the
Fringe, is to take over as director of the Riverside Studios in London. It
is a challenging job. Riverside is Pounds 200,000 in the red.
Burdett-Coutts will continue to manage the Assembly Rooms during each
Festival and hopes that he will be able to integrate programming. He has
long wanted to produce new work rather than just act as a receiving house
and controlling a London venue makes it feasible to create plays that start
in Edinburgh with a guaranteed transfer to the capital and vice versa.
In the meantime he might give some thought soundproofing the various
auditoria inside the Assembly Rooms. American comic Greg Proops got so upset
at the noise percolating to his show from the performance of the Doug
Anthony All-stars playing up above that he rehearsed his 100-strong audience
in anti-Anthony slogans and led them on to the All-stars stage The
Australians retired hurt for 20 minutes.
