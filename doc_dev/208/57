MIRROR GROUP Newspapers has cancelled plans to build a printing plant at its
Anderston Quay headquarters in central Glasgow. Work on the Pounds 70m
construction project stopped on Christmas Eve and will not resume.
Instead staff of the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail will be told
today that the plan is to build on a greenfield site close to Glasgow city
centre.
Talks have started with local authorities on a new site to install modern
colour presses which are stored in crates in Glasgow.
Mr David Montgomery, the recently appointed chief executive of MGN, asked
the board of the Scottish papers to carry out a review of the project.
Apart from the decision on the location of the presses, the review found
that no provision had been made for the latest electronic page make-up
systems or for equipment to insert previously printed material at the same
pace as the presses roll.
The overall cost of the Anderston Quay project was to be Pounds 114m
including the presses. Following the review the savings could be as high as
Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m in spite of adding the extra equipment. 'We will
get more for less,' Mr Montgomery said last night.
The existing Glasgow presses can produce only 48-page papers and as a result
the company has had to turn away advertising.
Interim measures to produce larger newspapers on the existing presses are to
be introduced until the new plant can be built.
Larger newspapers will mean fewer copies can be printed. To cover the
temporary shortfall MGN's plant at Oldham, Manchester, will produce copies
for the south of Scotland.
Mr Montgomery has told staff that flexible working without extra payments is
now a necessity for the Mirror group, which has to make good the ravages to
its pension fund by Robert Maxwell.
A review is under way on whether the editorial staff of the Scottish titles
should stay at Anderston Quay.
