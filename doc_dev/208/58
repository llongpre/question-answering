Ian Russell, director - financial control, at Tomkins, the conglomerate, is
to become finance director of Scottish Power. He will thus fill a vacancy
which has existed since January at the Glasgow-based company when Duncan
Whyte moved up to become chief operating officer (electricity supply) under
ceo Ian Preston.
Russell, 40, was born and educated in Scotland, and was previously with
Hongkong Bank Group in London and Hong Kong. He trained with accountants
Thomson McLintock and later worked for Pentos and Mars. He will join the
board of Scottish Power and take up his post in January.
Though Scottish Power is said to have had difficulty attracting someone of
sufficient stature for a company in the FT-SE 100 who was willing to move to
Scotland, (Tomkins is based in London) the absence of a finance director has
not been a problem. A consultant has been brought in to occupy that seat and
Whyte has been near at hand.
Changes are also taking place a few hundred yards away at the Scottish
Power's regulator, the Office of Electricity Regulation in Scotland (OFFER).
Here the youthful Graeme Sims, 30, is taking over as deputy
director-general, reporting to Stephen Littlechild, the director general of
electricity supply who is based in Birmingham.
In January, Sims will replace Peter Carter, who only took the job in January
1993, having moved from the Glasgow-based Offshore Supplies Office of the
DTI, which supports the North Sea oil industry. Carter has become
Littlechild's deputy dg in Birmingham.
Sims is currently economic adviser at OFFER in Glasgow, which he joined soon
after it was set up in 1991. Before that he worked in a small business
development agency in Glasgow and for the Boston Consulting Group in London.
