FLOYD PRAISED FOR LAND BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wish to commend Assemblyman Dick Floyd (D-Carson) for coming to the 
assistance of the Holly Glen Community in Hawthorne. He has introduced Assembly 
Bill 702, a bill requiring Caltrans (the state Department of Transportation) to 
sell surplus property known as "the Glasgow Strip" to the city of Hawthorne for 
development as a public park. Caltrans has allowed the Glasgow Strip, between 
the 405 Freeway and a residential area, to become an eyesore. As grateful as I 
am to Floyd, I am equally appalled that the Republican assemblymen on the 
Transportation Committee voted as a bloc against the citizens of Hawthorne when 
AB 702 came before the committee on May, 1. These Republicans have sided with 
Caltrans in its effort to subvert the city of Hawthorne's right and duty to 
govern the city and to promote the best interests of its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The Glasgow Strip has been zoned urban open space since 1983. For six years 
Hawthorne has attempted to purchase the Glasgow Strip from Caltrans. 
Unfortunately, the city was forced to request the legislation in AB 702 because 
Caltrans would not conduct good-faith negotiations. Contrary to current law, 
Caltrans refuses to sell the property at "fair market value." Instead, Caltrans 
insists this property be appraised as residential, in violation of both the 
city's General Plan and the zoning that has been in effect for six years. This 
would result in a windfall for Caltrans and a hardship for Hawthorne and its 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
I understand the need for freeways, but I don't agree that Caltrans should make 
windfall profits by the disruption necessitated by freeway development. 
Hawthorne is attempting to improve through acquisition of open space, but 
Caltrans, acting from Sacramento, is trying to impose its will contrary to 
Hawthorne's General Plan and zoning ordinances. It distresses me that our 
Republican assemblymen would side with Caltrans against the residents of 
Hawthorne. I think we deserve better than this.
