   DALLAS -- Enserch Corp. agreed to sell the offshore
engineering portion of its Humphreys &amp; Glasgow International
unit to Oslo-based Kvaerner AS for $28 million.
   The businesses to be sold are Humphreys &amp; Glasgow Offshore
Engineering Ltd., based in London, and Earl &amp; Wright, with
offices in London, San Francisco and Houston. Proceeds will
be used to reduce Humphreys &amp; Glasgow's bank debt in the
United Kingdom.

   Enserch, an energy engineering and construction concern,
said any gain on the sale is expected to be relatively small.
