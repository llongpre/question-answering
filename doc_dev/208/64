value in float

Servisair, the independent aircraft and passenger handling company, has
announced that despite current market indigestion for new issues its
flotation was fully underwritten at its target price, valuing the company at
Pounds 54.3m.
The company's parent, Securum, is selling 60 per cent of its stake.
Servisair is offering a further 7.4m new shares, making a total offer of
24.12m shares priced at 135p.
The company is forecast to make profits of Pounds 4.2m before exceptional
items, putting the shares on a price-earnings ratio of 14.7, which is
roughly the stock market average.
It is offering 6.03m of the shares to intermediaries. This portion of the
offer should get a boost from the news yesterday that Servisair has won a
10-year baggage-handling contract at Glasgow airport, the UK's fourth
largest.
Servisair already operates passenger and cargo handling services at Glasgow,
which should contribute about Pounds 5m to this year's revenues. The
baggage-handling contract should add at least 10 per cent to that figure.
The company has also secured 10-year contracts for its other operations in
Glasgow.
Servisair will pay a notional dividend of 3.8p for 1994, representing a
notional gross dividend yield of 3.5 per cent.
The offer to intermediaries closes on October 12 and trading is scheduled to
start on October 18.
COMMENT
Servisair has done well to achieve a high price in an unfavourable market,
but does not appear to have left much for the stags. It offers the
advantages of a long management track record, a decade of profits growth,
and a relatively dependable source of earnings. It also has a strong
argument for new business. Airlines in the UK and Europe are starting to
contract out lower margin, non-core activities such as passenger and
aircraft handling. The old monopolies are being broken, as at Glasgow,
providing a convincing medium-term picture. As most of the short-term
attractions are well accounted for in the offer price, it must be classed as
a stock for the patient.
