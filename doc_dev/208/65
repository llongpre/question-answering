FT  14 JAN 92 / Appointments: The power to attract expats
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISHPOWER, the electricity company privatised in June, has made Murray
Stuart its non-executive deputy chairman. Stuart, 58, recently resigned as
chief executive of Berisford, the food, commodities and property group,
having brought it back from the brink of liquidation in 18 months.
Stuart, who became a director of ScottishPower in 1990, was formerly
chairman of MB Group, previously known as Metal Box. He is to work closely
with Sir Donald Miller, chairman, and Ian Preston, chief executive, on
developing ScottishPower's corporate strategy.
This will mean spending two days a week in Scotland and Stuart, who lives in
Surrey, says he will soon be buying a property there. Although he says he is
soon to take up another appointment in England he indicates that he could
eventually follow the path of many an expatriate Scot (he was born in
Glasgow, educated at Glasgow Academy and Glasgow University and is an
accountant by training) and return to his native land.
Neither he nor ScottishPower has anything to say on suggestions that he
might be groomed to succeed Miller, 64.
