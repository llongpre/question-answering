Glasgow is cock of the walk in European conservation, winning five of the
annual Europa Nostra awards for conservation and new construction in
conservation areas.
This year the scheme attracted more than 125 entries from 20 countries. It
is sponsored by American Express, and the now merged Europa
Nostra/International Castles Institute runs it. Seven projects won medals of
honour, and 36 won diplomas of merit.
The two British medallists are the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
refurbished to its Victorian splendour, and the 18th century court house and
jail in Inveraray, Argyllshire.
Other winners are from Germany (the Hotel im Wasserturm in Cologne, and
three ancient revolving windmills at Oberoderwitz), Norway (Arendal town),
and Spain (the San Isidro chapel in the San Andres church in Madrid, and a
15th century house in Valencia).
Diploma winners include a fortified church in Romania, Dublin Castle,
Trinity College Cambridge, dock conversions in Amsterdam, the Ca'd'oro
Building in Glasgow (along with four other schemes there) and the National
Trust's restoration of the exotic Victorian garden at Biddulph Grange in
Staffordshire.
