Ryanair, the Dublin-based independent airline, is to expand its budget
'no-frills' UK-Ireland services with two new UK destinations out of Dublin
from next month.
Adding Manchester and Glasgow to its destinations of Stansted, Luton,
Liverpool and Birmingham, Ryanair aims to capture market share from Aer
Lingus, the state-run airline, and Irish Sea ferry operators.
Ryanair says traffic on the Dublin-Birmingham route has grown by over 60 per
cent since it started last October, challenging the Aer Lingus monopoly on
the route. The company is confident it can achieve the same level of growth
on the Manchester and Glasgow services.
Ryanair will operate eight flights a day between Dublin and Manchester and
four between Dublin and Glasgow. Its fares will be half those currently
offered by Aer Lingus, the state-run airline, and will almost certainly
force Aer Lingus to adjust its fares on the routes.
