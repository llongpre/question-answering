FT  01 OCT 93 / Glasgow wins fight for 700 MoD jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW has finally won the battle for the Ministry of Defence's new
personnel centre, which will bring the city up to 700 jobs.
It appeared several times that a guarantee to base the centre in the city
might be snatched away after it was announced in January that Glasgow was
the recommended site for the unified personnel centre to handle all Army pay
and pensions.
The proposal was to bring together a number of smaller offices around
Britain and create 700 jobs in Glasgow while safeguarding 400 existing jobs.
But then Stockport, Greater Manchester, entered a bid proposing a suitable
building which would cost Pounds 4m against Pounds 20m for one in Glasgow.
The decision to look seriously at the Stockport proposal angered Mr Ian
Lang, Scottish secretary, particularly as Rosyth lost the Pounds 5.5bn
Trident submarine refitting contract to Devonport.
After looking again in Glasgow, a cheaper, existing building at Kentigern
was proposed and consultations started.
But in July the MoD was inundated with a stream of representations and
intense lobbying from MPs proposing alternative sites around the country.
However ministers preferred the Kentigern proposal and the other
representations did not change their minds.
