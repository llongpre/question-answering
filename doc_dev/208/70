FERGUSON Shipbuilders, based at Port Glasgow on the Lower Clyde, has won a
Pounds 16m contract to build two ferries to operate between Southampton and
the Isle of Wight.
The contract, with Red Funnel Ferries of Southampton, secures the future of
the shipyard until early 1995. Ferguson has been owned since early 1991 by a
consortium chaired by Sir Ross Belch, who once managed the Scott Lithgow
shipyard at Port Glasgow, now mothballed.
The 500-tonne ferries, 280 feet long, will each carry 700 passengers and 140
cars between Southampton and Cowes. Ferguson won the contract in the face of
competition from other yards.
The company was part of British Shipbuilders until 1989 when it was sold to
a private consortium. It was then sold to Kvaerner, the Norwegian company
which owns the Govan shipyard in Glasgow. Kvaerner sold it for Pounds
250,000 to Sir Ross Belch's group.
Ferguson employs 220 people and has built ferries and offshore oil service
vessels.
Mr Bill Scott, chief executive, said the award of the contract highlighted
'the pre-eminent position of Ferguson in the market for inter-island
ferries.'
It brought the total of orders won since privatisation to Pounds 50m,
'creating potential for increased employment'.
