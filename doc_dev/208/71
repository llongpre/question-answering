A few days ago, funding was agreed for a 100,000 sq ft office development in
the heart of Edinburgh. The project, known as Exchange Plaza, is one of the
largest speculative developments being undertaken in the UK.
It will slot into place another piece of the jigsaw in the Lothian Road area
whose realisation at the end of the 1980s looked problematic as developers
failed.
Exchange Plaza, which is being funded by the Scottish developers
CALA-Morrison and by Railways Pension Trustee Company, will stand near the
new Edinburgh International Conference Centre, and a new headquarters being
built for Standard Life.
It will help relieve Edinburgh's shortage of modern open-plan office space,
a shortage that has been masked by the comfortable supply of available
office stock, much of it either old or requiring refurbishment, according to
the chartered surveyors Ryden.
Even though the Edinburgh office market is still moving fairly slowly, the
scene in the capital is the most upbeat in Scotland. When restrictive
planning policies were eased in the mid-1980s, demand for space far exceeded
supply, pushing rents up to peaks of Pounds 27 per sq ft.
Now there is space available in the Georgian New Town and city centre, rents
for modern accommodation are between Pounds 18 and Pounds 20 a sq ft,
comparable with UK cities such as Leeds and Birmingham.
'Edinburgh has come back into the pack,' says Mr Alan Robertson of Jones
Lang Wootton's Edinburgh office. 'We now have space and rents to attract
incoming businesses.' He points to surveys where Edinburgh comes near the
top of preferred relocation destinations.
New developments are building up steadily on the western fringe of the city,
close to the motorway system. The two big Scottish banks have moved many of
their activities there and the first projects are taking shape for Edinburgh
Park, a high quality business park.
But the move by financial institutions and professionals into new office
buildings around Lothian Road area has left about half of the stately
Charlotte Square empty. However the recent granting of planning permission
to Helical Bar for a project to develop at the rear of the square while
maintaining the Georgian houses intact appears to offer a way in which the
square can be revived.
There is rather less movement on the Glasgow property scene. In the late
1980s Glasgow, traditionally the biggest and most stable market in Scotland,
renewed much of its office stock and extended the core down to the river
Clyde.
But as Mr James Thomson of Jones Lang Wootton's Glasgow office says: 'things
have been very quiet for the past three years.' Much of the new property
took a long time to fill up and although the amount of office space let each
year has increased steadily there is still a considerable number of empty
floors.
Yet paradoxically the city also has a shortage of large open-plan floor
space. 'If you wanted 50,000 sq ft of space in a building you'd be pushed to
get it,' says Mr James Thomson, a partner in Jones Lang Wootton's Glasgow
office.
'There is a lot of second-hand space hanging over the market, with tenants
unable to get out of their leases. Site values are back at the levels they
stood at in the mid-1980s before the last upturn.' Prime rentals, according
to Ryden, have fallen back to Pounds 17.50, backed by substantial
incentives.
Whereas a year ago there was not a single crane working on a private sector
development in central Glasgow, now two construction projects are going
ahead.
Hill Samuel Life Assurance and London &amp; Wiltshire are building a 23,000 sq
ft building on a speculative basis in St Vincent Street, and Scottish Life
House nearby is being refurbished.
One of the most important developments is promised for a 49-acre site about
a mile from the city centre at Pacific Quay, used for the Glasgow Garden
Festival in 1988 and lying idle ever since.
Miller Developments and CTP are working on a project whose key element, in
addition to leisure facilities, is a 250,000 sq ft business park.
According to the Glasgow Development Agency which owns the site, the city's
performance in winning inward investors continues to suffer because of the
shortage of good quality serviced industrial-business premises, particularly
in comparison with the new towns of East Kilbride and Cumbernauld.
