IT IS a paradox of European culture that the stuffiest cities play host to
the most radical artists: Vienna, Salzburg and Edinburgh, all famously
bourgeois, woo the enfants terribles of the European avant-garde for
festivals each year.
Antwerp, which has just launched its programme as European City of Culture
for 1993, slots naturally into this set. A deeply conservative, Roman
Catholic, Flemish city, where the right-wing Vlaamse Blok scored well at
last November's election, its long-standing role as a magnet for innovative
artists makes it Belgium's obvious choice as cultural capital.
Yet Antwerp joins Glasgow as the only two in the series of Europe's cultural
capitals - Florence, Paris, Berlin, etc. - not known as an international
arts centre.
Glasgow in 1990 responded with a new, cleaned-up image and a programme
including sports and popular events. Antwerp - on a budget of BF900m, less
than a third of Glasgow's - has a much tighter, arts-orientated schedule
which builds on the tradition of artistic excellence which already makes it
a powerhouse of Flemish culture. Like Glasgow, it has more to prove and more
to gain from its year in the arts limelight, than the other cities.
Visit Antwerp, and the paradox of the radical and the traditional is
everywhere. More than 300 Madonnas are sculpted into niches on the outside
of the stepped, gabled houses of the 17th century merchants who made Antwerp
rich. Now the lugubrious Virgins brood warily over the pazzazz of
developments such as the old docks, about to become Antwerp's Covent
Garden-style piazza and home to Eurosail '93, a mooring of tall ships from
round the world.
At the new Dock's Cafe, a former warehouse on the banks of the River
Scheldt, city slickers queue nightly for cocktails. Seconds away, the
remnant of the old port life, a street of red-lit windows where negro
prostitutes advertise their wares, struggles for survival.
As a young man, Simenon, Belgium's most famous writer, once gave his most
precious possession, a silver watch, for 20 minutes with one of them.
The growth of high-tech industry in Flanders, and especially the expansion
of Antwerp's and Rotterdam's docks into western Europe's two leading ports -
both slick, stream-lined post-modern affairs - has created a milieu spawning
experimental, up-to-the-minute Flemish art.
Ask any Belgian to name national artists of international standing, and the
list will be Flemish: choreographers Wim Wanderkeybus or Anna Theresa de
Keersmaeker and the 'Rosas' group with the kinetic dazzle and compressed
energy of their violent new dance forms, both recent guests in England;
directors Jan Fabre or Jan Lauwers with multi-tongued music-drama like
'Sweet Temptations' or 'Invictos', an Andalusian dance of death based on
Hemingway which plays in Dutch, Spanish, English or German according to its
audience. All these have criss-crossed Europe this year, but at home too,
along with trendy visitors such as Vienna's Claus Peymann, Tadeusz Kantor's
Polish troupe and the American musical 'Josephine' about the life of
Josephine Baker, which began its European tour in Rotterdam and Antwerp,
they were the biggest hits of this season. They illustrate a distinction
between Flemish and Walloon cultural self-images: where Brussels, the
outstanding Monnaie Opera excepted, languishes as a Francophone Cinderella
too close to the rigorous chic of Paris to thrive as an independent artistic
metropolis, Antwerp joins Rotterdam and Amsterdam in a snazzy nexus of
confidant Flemish-Dutch cities which see themselves as a heartland of North
European culture.
It is the European connection that Eric Antonius, director of the festival
Antwerp 93, is stressing in his strategy for the city's role as the first
cultural capital in a Europe without frontiers.
'It is typical of Europeans', says Mr Antonius, 'that they are continually
taking a close, critical look at themselves and at the world in which they
are trying to survive. They ask questions, hesitate, often live at variance
with themselves and dare to brush aside their achievements so as to start
all over again'.
His European theatre programme, 'The Questioner' (De Vragestellar) will
reopen the Bourla Theatre, the monumental late-classical building on the
Komedieplaats which has stood empty since it was declared a fire hazard in
1980.
Oedipus, Hamlet, Orfeo, Don Juan, Faust and other self-pondering archetypes
of European drama will tread its boards in 1993 along with those giants of
modern angst, Peter Handke ('The Question Game'), Bernard-Marie Koltes, with
a roll-call of down-and-out and mass-murderer heroes, and Thomas Bernhard,
who distils existential agony into drama and even comedy like no one else.
It's an exciting programme but there's an unmistakeable whiff of the
Teutonic heavyweight about it; had Brussels hosted such a festival, French
legerete would as distinctly have been the name of the game. But Antwerp 93
undoubtedly has a finger on the pulse of contemporary theatre.
In the other performing arts, the programmes are also serious and
innovative. The modish arts complex De Singel will collaborate with the
Flemish Opera, for example, on the first Festival of Contemporary Opera,
directed by Jan Fabre and including several Flemish composers or
theatre-makers.
'I am an international artist but first I am a Flemish artist', says Jan
Lauwers, who will direct Walter Hus's opera 'Orfeo'. Antwerp 93 will be a
showcase for what there is in Flemish culture beyond Rubens, Brueghel,
waffles and lace. Anyone who has not visited the city for some years will be
surprised. The messy frontage of the turn-of-the-century Centraal Station,
one of the great railway cathedrals of European station architecture, will
be restored to its former lustre for 1993. The wall which has for years
divided Antwerp Cathedral will go, making the Cathedral of Our Lady again
the largest Gothic church in the Netherlands. And the old waterfront will be
a jazzed-up catwalk of restaurants for style-spotters.
In industrial Antwerp early this century, the saying used to go: 'Antwerp
owes the Scheldt to God and the rest to the Scheldt'. The port is still the
city's life-blood, but the old docks should attract a fleet of Euro-yachts
and a crowd of Euro-visitors, and will be the nerve-centre of the new
tourist Antwerp too.
