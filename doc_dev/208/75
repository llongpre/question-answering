To take issue with its title is an easy way of criticising at an exhibition,
yet it can also be a useful in clarifying the issue at the outset,
dispelling any misapprehension.
'The Belgian Avant-Garde 1880-1900', the sub-title of the show in the Royal
Academy's Sackler Galleries, has the virtue of exact description, but even
the most pro-Belgian would concede that on its own it sounds a little dull.
So what of Impressionism to Symbolism, the main title? One can see all too
well why those two big -isms were chosen - everyone has heard of them;
together they neatly suggest the period of the show; and the merest mention
of Impressionism is sure to draw the punters in.
The only trouble is that it is not quite right. Vague in its generality, it
gives the unfortunate impression that here is little more than an annexe to
the French painting of the time, so dominant still is the Franco-centric
reading of the art history of early modernism. And in its particular
conjunction, it proposes a narrative sequence, development or shift from the
one -ism to the other.
This is a pity because the show, in both material and critical content, is
so much more interesting than that. Indeed my only complaint is that there
is too little shown of a rich and fascinating subject. Between the one and
the other would have been the better choice of title.
What this exhibition actually gives us is not a sequence at all but rather
an over-view, as though looking down into a house with the roof off, and no
matter whether the contemporaneous activity revealed is complementary,
contradictory or unrelated. It is an admirable exercise for the Academy to
have taken on, for one of the most rewarding critical developments in recent
years has been the renewal of comparative interest in the national schools
in the early modern period. In this, the Academy has often taken the lead,
if not always the credit it deserves.
What is revealed, and especially in this exhibition, is that while at
particular moments certain places - for all sorts of historical, political
and cultural reasons - become the place to be, the focus of current interest
and activity, it is never the only place where significant creative work is
being done. Of course Paris was of first importance in the later 19th
century, primus inter pares, but what of Berlin, Copenhagen, Oslo, the
Hague, Turin, Barcelona, London, Glasgow, Vienna, Brussels . . . ?
It is the premise of this show, with Brussels at its centre, that we ask the
same question. What we find is that the Paris relation is evident enough,
yet what little of Impressionism there is seems closer in its robust spirit
to what was going on Holland and Scandinavia than to Monet or Pissarro.
Bartsoen's barges in the snow and Mertens' moonlit fisherman are fine,
straight-forward examples.
There is, admittedly, a lot of post-Impressionism, in the pointillism of
Lemmen, van de Velde, Finch and van Rysselberghe - indeed disproportionately
so, though with some splendid examples. A more intriguing French connection
lies in the social realism of such as Bastien-Lepage, but then again the
ramifications run throughout Europe, from Newlyn to Stockholm, Glasgow to
Turin. The Belgian view is notably represented here by the large 'Funeral
Wake' of Leon Frederic, the 'First Communion' by Emile Claus and van
Leemputten's 'Distribution of Bread in the Village'.
More particular is the reference to the social symbolism of Millet and
Puvis, which we find in Verstaete's 'Barge Haulier' and Verheden's
'Gleaners'; and to the psychological symbolism of Moreau and Redon, in the
dreamlike, haunted drawings of Fernand Knopff, and the dark, mysteriously
inhabited interiors of Xavier Mellery. Rops seems included as an
afterthought - a missed opportunity. These two aspects of symbolism come
together in the angst-ridden sculpture of Meunier and Minne. With
Spilliaert's hypnotic self-portrait, the step is forward into psychological
expressionism - again we could have done with much more of him. There are
cross-references and blurred distinctions everywhere.
With James Ensor, still the best known of the early Belgian modernists and
central to the show, such shifts are endless - expressionism, symbolism,
realism, on their own and all at once, even in the small selection here. The
comparison with Munch is inevitable, and proposes what is perhaps the
message of this show. For him the view from Brussels stretched east to
Berlin and north to Oslo quite as much as south to Paris. The artist is free
even to stay where he is. To be local is not always to be provincial.
