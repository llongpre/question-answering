FT  25 NOV 93 / Glasgow's health board chief resigns after row

Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, yesterday accepted the resignation of Mr
Bill Fyfe, chairman of Greater Glasgow Health Board, Britain's largest
health authority, James Buxton writes.
Mr Fyfe's position became increasingly difficult following a board decision
which he instigated to dismiss Mr Laurence Peterken, the board's general
manager.
Shortly after Mr Peterken was dismissed he was appointed to the newly
created post of director of special projects by Mr Gerald Scaife, the chief
executive of the National Health Service in Scotland.
Mr Scaife then investigated circumstances of Mr Peterken's dismissal while
MPs put down questions to ministers in parliament. Mr Fyfe appeared to be
losing the support of Scottish Office ministers.
Yesterday five members of the Greater Glasgow Health Board issued a
statement saying: 'In the light of information now available we believe the
correct procedure was not followed in the dismissal of Laurence Peterken.
'We have no confidence in the chairman and we call on him to resign
forthwith.'
Mr Fyfe took over the chairmanship of the health board earlier this year. He
had previously won ministerial approval as chairman of Ayrshire and Arran
Health Board, where he stood up to trade unions, made savings and encouraged
the formation of one of the first trust hospitals in Scotland.
