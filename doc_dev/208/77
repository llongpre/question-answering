MORE than 40 Royal Bank of Scotland staff in Glasgow have been suspended as
a dispute between Bifu, the banking union, and Royal Bank intensified
yesterday.
The dispute, originally about pay, now centres on whether Bifu members are
entitled to withdraw from overtime they normally work.
A total of 41 Bifu members have been suspended for refusing to work
'contractual overtime'.
The bank said: 'Staff who refused to work normal hours have been sent home.
They are free to resume work as soon as they agree to restrict any
industrial action to legitimate voluntary or abnormal overtime.'
The bank said action over the Easter weekend had had an 'insignificant
effect' on services. It anticipated minimal disruption at affected branches,
all of which are in the centre of Glasgow.
The union launched an overtime ban and work-to-contract action just before
the Easter weekend as part of its campaign of industrial action over pay.
It has rejected an offer of between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent for
clerical grades. It has also rejected a performance-related pay package for
managers, which it says fails to guarantee a rise.
Bifu has asked Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, to intervene
in the dispute. It alleges that the bank's management is intimidating Bifu
members engaged in legal industrial action.
Mr Leif Mills, Bifu general secretary, is due to address a meeting of Royal
Bank of Scotland staff, including those who are suspended, in Glasgow this
evening.
