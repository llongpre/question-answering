Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817-75) was a leading architect in Glasgow in
the middle years of the 19th century. He worked mainly in his own version of
the neo-classical style which time has shown to be, not only extremely
original, but also of considerable European significance.
Although he is a very remarkable product of Scotland, in many ways Alexander
Thomson is a forgotten architect. He never travelled outside the British
Isles and remained very insular as a character. Yet his architectural
achievements, which are confined to Glasgow and its immediate surroundings,
are of the highest imaginative quality.
Thomson, in his original interpretations and developments of classicism,
reminds me of Nicholas Hawksmoor (1661-1736), another insular non-traveller.
What Hawksmoor and Thomson have in common is their own imaginative
interpretation of the Ancient Classical world.
So Thomson is an architect who should not be forgotten. I have written
before about the important work of The Alexander Thomson Society, which was
recently founded by Dr Gavin Stamp and others in Glasgow. This Society now
has an urgent case on its hands. It has already done sterling work in its
campaign to make the work of Thomson at least as familiar as that of Charles
Rennie Mackintosh - Glasgow's other much praised native architectural son.
The urgent case they are now quite rightly promoting is that of Holmwood,
the finest house designed by Thomson.
Holmwood is a villa set in a Loudonesque sylvan setting. It stands on the
southern edge of the city of Glasgow, next to a scenic bend on the river
Cart. It is a Grade 'A' listed building and is, to my eye, one of the most
original neo-classical villas in the world.
It is almost in the same league as the Court Gardener's House in Potsdam by
Karl Friedrich von Schinkel - but possibly even more original and daring. We
know that Thomson was much influenced by Schinkel and that he possessed the
engravings of much of Schinkel's work. Thomson built Holmwood in 1857-58,
after his famous Double Villa and none of his subsequent domestic work is of
such interest.
In 1958 Holmwood was purchased by the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions,
who erected school buildings on land behind the house. The convent school
closed last year and the Alexander Thomson Society started to campaign for
the house to be acquired for the public realm and restored and opened.
The National Trust for Scotland immediately saw the point of the house, both
as an important aesthetic monument and as a very positive addition to its
architectural portfolio.
There are still some handicaps to be overcome. In 1990 a property developer,
the Carvill Group (UK), acquired an option to purchase the whole Holmwood
site, subject to securing planning permission to build in the grounds. This
unwise and unfortunate situation has led to elaborate negotiations between
the developer, The National Trust for Scotland, Historic Scotland, and the
Planners of Glasgow District Council to find a compromise solution that will
allow the house to be preserved with as little intrusive development as
possible.
The debate about planning consent naturally affects the value of the house
to the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions and the need to debate the
planning consents adds the risk of lengthy delays. So the situation is
urgent. Vandalism has already begun - the empty school buildings have been
set on fire and the Sisters are having to employ security guards at
considerable expense.
The National Trust for Scotland is hoping to make a decision about acquiring
and restoring Holmwood early in October. The National Heritage Memorial
Fund, under its energetic new chairman, Lord Rothschild, has already visited
Holmwood and shown considerable interest and willingness to help.
There is an urgent need for a final push by all the parties concerned to
reach a sensible deal that is not based only on commercial considerations.
There is enormous goodwill in the air - perhaps greater public awareness at
this stage will help to force some conclusive action.
What is so special about Holmwood? It represents the peak of Thomson's
domestic invention. It is a pioneering and creative piece of architecture
that is moving and beautiful to see. In its strange abstraction it points
towards much modern architecture and to the work of Frank Lloyd Wright.
All this ingenuity comes from an architect who was a practising Grecian at
the same time as Scott, Pugin and Ruskin were preaching their Gothic
triumphs.
His churches in Glasgow - the Caledonian Road Church and the Vincent Street
Churches - are even more remarkable, bringing Egyptian and Indian elements
into their designs. One is a burnt ruin and the other is worryingly insecure
 -both belong to the City council.
Holmwood should be the turning point for the public appreciation of 'Greek'
Thomson, a European creative genius yet to be fully recognised.
