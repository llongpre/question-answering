GLASGOW, like most other big British cities, made big efforts after the
Second World War to disperse its population from the centre to the suburbs.
One result was a fall in population - from 1.12m in 1939 to only 700,000
today. Another was the so-called doughnut effect: Glasgow has a rich centre
and a poor periphery. The metaphor does not work completely since not all
council tenants were moved to the peripheral estates, where until the 1970s
most housing was built by the public sector for rent.
But most recent inner city residential developments have been privately
developed. In the Merchant City, attractive but derelict warehouses and
factories close to the City Chambers (city hall) were handed over to private
developers by the city council and made into residential units which are
either unsuitable for families or beyond the pocket of working class people.
In 1980s terminology, it was 'yuppified'.
Now, however, an ambitious pilot scheme, backed by the Glasgow Development
Agency, the Glasgow District Council and Scottish Homes, the housing
enabling body, aims to develop a low cost housing community close to the
city centre.
The project, called the Crown Street regeneration project, is to take place
in part of the notorious Gorbals, which is a microcosm of Glasgow's changing
fortunes over the past 100 years.
The Gorbals, on the south bank of the River Clyde only five minutes from the
city centre, was once a respectable middle class area. Then from the 1860s
the once fashionable four storey tenements in the area were occupied by
Irish immigrants and Highlanders driven to the big city by famine and
clearances. So overcrowded were the buildings that a system known as
'ticketing' was introduced, which stipulated the numbers who could live in a
four storey building. By the 1880s one seventh of Glasgow's population lived
in ticketed buildings.
With industrialisation people continued to pour in. By the early 1900s, the
still elegant stone facades of Hutchesontown in the centre of the Gorbals
concealed a hidden Glasgow. Families ate, slept, gave birth and died in one
room.
The cheap housing attracted further immigrants from Ireland and Eastern
Europe and from Pakistan. These added their own cultures to the distinctive
street life of the area. But the area became best known for the violence of
the so-called razor gangs. By the 1950s the Gorbals had the worst slums
north of Naples.
The post-war planners in Glasgow decided to start from scratch. The first
area in the city to be tackled was Hutchesontown/ Gorbals. The Hutchesontown
Redevelopment Plan was finally approved in 1957. The area was to be a green
city of tower blocks.
It was not a success. The communities felt cut off and alienated. Within a
short time the tower blocks - built using the 'tracoba' method of system
building imported from Algeria - suffered from dampness and condensation.
Lifts broke down. The dampness proved incurable. By 1982 the last residents
were moved out. Five years later Hutcheson E - the most notorious of the
blocks - was demolished.
There are 40 acres standing empty in Hutchesontown owned by the city
council. It is here that the Crown Street regeneration project will take
place. The plan is to build 1,000 four storey tenements. The first two
floors will be three and four bedroom maisonettes with gardens back and
front. The top two floors will form single level one and two bedroom
apartments.
Twenty five per cent of the dwellings will be for rent with the rest for
owner occupation. The entire project will cost Pounds 80m. Scottish Homes
has put up Pounds 9m as seed money (in England it would be defined as city
grant.) Because the council owns the land, and there is a high level of
subsidy, the housing that is not for rent will be cheap. Maisonettes will
start at Pounds 50,000 and flats at Pounds 32,000.
Mr Mike Galloway, the director of the project which is only at the stage of
examining design tenders, says, 'what we are attempting here is
revolutionary. We are going for urban regeneration without gentrification.
We are going to build a genuine lower middle class community here. There
will be shops and community centres. We even have plans for a budget hotel.
People from different walks of life will want to live here because it is so
close to the city centre.'
The peripheral estates which have tens of thousands of residents are a
different problem. The estates, consisting of a mixture of three to four
storey blocks of flats and tower blocks, have become almost as infamous as
the Gorbals. They are characterised by high unemployment (30 per cent in
some cases), by alienation and loss of community spirit, by vandalism, drugs
and other symptoms of deprivation.
It is unfair to say, however, that because the estates are out of sight they
are out of mind. Professor Alan MacGregor of Glasgow University sits on the
partnership committee for the Castlemilk estate, to the south of the city.
This is one of four partnership areas in Scotland designated by the
secretary of state for Scotland - joint ventures between central government
and local community organisations.
Professor MacGregor says, 'Over 10 years hundreds of millions of pounds will
be channeled into the estates in all kinds of areas, housing, training,
employment and training. One of the things we are doing is to improve links
between Castlemilk and East Kilbride where there are good employment
prospects after the recession.'
In other areas organisations such as the Glasgow Development Agency, the
Glasgow District Council and the Confederation of British Industry in
Scotland are involved in initiatives on the estates. Professor MacGregor
says, 'it is early days for the initiatives. But it is not true to say that
the city council is spending money on tarting up the centre and on the arts
that it should be spending on the estates. It is doing both.'
