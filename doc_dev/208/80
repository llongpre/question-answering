   Hundreds of people lined the streets
of this Glasgow suburb Saturday to pay tribute to one of three
British airmen killed in IRA attacks in the Netherlands.
   A cortege bearing the coffin of Senior Aircraftman John Baxter,
21, wound its way to a cemetery beside Cardonald's chapel for the
burial. A 12-man Royal Air Force squad fired a volley of shots, and
a bugler sounded ``Taps'' as the coffin was lowered into a grave.
   At a Mass earlier, the Most Rev. Thomas Winning, the Roman
Catholic archbishop of Glasgow, denounced the killing and said
people ``shudder with revulsion at the thought of this terrible
deed.
   ``We deplore and condemn it with the whole of our being. No
cause, no matter how just, can ever claim the right to achieve its
ends by these means,'' he said.
   The bodies of Baxter and two other airmen killed in the May 7
attacks, Senior Aircraftmen John Miller Reid, 21, and Ian Shinner,
20, were flown home Friday.
   Reid, also of Glasgow, was cremated Saturday after a private
service in nearby Lenzie. Shinner was to be buried Monday in his
hometown, Winsford, England.
   Baxter and Reid were killed when a bomb detonated in their car
outside a discotheque in the Dutch village of Nieuw Bergen.
   Shinner died an hour earlier in a hail of bullets as he and two
other airmen sat in a car in Roermond, about 35 miles from Nieuw
Bergen.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the
attacks. The outlawed group is fighting to oust the British from
Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with
the mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
