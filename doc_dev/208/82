Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, has vetoed the plan by the National
Galleries of Scotland to establish a gallery of Scottish art in Glasgow,
James Buxton writes.
He said the plan, which had aroused intense controversy in Scotland, did not
enjoy 'the broad general support appropriate to a major initiative of this
kind'.
Mr Lang's decision is a rebuff to Mr Angus Grossart, the merchant banker who
is chairman of the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland, and to Mr
Timothy Clifford, the director of the galleries, who were the plan's
proponents.
The idea was to create a gallery to depict Scottish art and history. It
would have been based around the collection in the Scottish national
portrait gallery but include pictures from the National Gallery and the
National Gallery of Scottish Art, all in Edinburgh, plus pictures in store.
Glasgow made a successful bid for the new gallery to be in the city, but the
plan caused an outcry when it was announced late last year. Opposition
focused on the transfer of the portrait gallery collection, and there were
objections to the idea of removing Scottish pictures from their
international context, as well as to the choice of Glasgow rather than
Edinburgh
The trustees of the gallery then changed the plan to leave the portrait
gallery untouched. Mr Lang said he would not have been prepared to permit
the transfer of the portrait gallery collection in any case, but without
this collection the proposals had 'lost their core'.
