Glasgow yesterday unveiled detailed routes for a light railway system that
will cross the city. Strathclyde Regional Council hopes the first phase of
the new network will be operating by 2002 at a cost of Pounds 150m.
The 20km tram system will run along a mixture of dedicated track and city
streets from Maryhill, north-west of the city centre, through the centre to
Easterhouse on the eastern fringe.
Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive says the tram system will provide
links to areas poorly served by public transport and dissuade people from
driving into the city centre. The trams will be long, single-deck vehicles
similar to those in continental cities and will carry at least 150 people.
Glasgow hopes to join Manchester and Sheffield, which have systems, and
Croydon and Birmingham, which have plans for reintroducing trams.
The reintroduction of trams is held up by the difficulty of securing
public-sector finance. Mr Gordon, who admitted that financing the project
could be 'problematical', said he hoped the council would allocate part of
its capital spending programme to the project, obtain European Union
financing and get a government grant under Section 56 of the 1968 Transport
Act.
Mr Stephen Lockley, chief executive of Strathclyde PTE, said the executive
could award a contract to a private-sector group to design, build, operate
and maintain the network. But he acknowledged that the 'vast bulk' of the
financing would still come from the public sector.
