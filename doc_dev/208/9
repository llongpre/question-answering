GLASGOW should be the location of the army's new centralised personnel
centre, the government announced yesterday, James Buxton writes. Two months
ago there were fears in the Scottish city that the centre, which would have
created 700 new jobs, would go to Stockport, near Manchester, despite
Glasgow having been designated as the army's preferred location in January.
The army, however, intends to locate the centre in the Ministry of Defence's
existing building, rather than occupying a large, recently completed office
building in the city centre which has been standing empty for more than a
year.
The latest recommendation on the centre, which the army wanted to group
together the administration of all army pay and personnel matters, is
subject to consultation and a final decision will be made in July.
Mr Archie Hamilton, armed forces minister, said that the army had decided
that the most economical option was to house the centre in Kentigern House
in Glasgow at a cost of Pounds 6m.
This would be cheaper than occupying a new building in Glasgow at a cost of
Pounds 25m, or taking a building in Stockport which would cost Pounds 15m.
