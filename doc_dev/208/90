FT  01 SEP 93 / People: TSB Scotland's new local hero
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The so-called Scottish financial mafia which dominates the top jobs in
Scotland's business world has a new recruit. Gordon Anderson, 62, the next
chairman of TSB Bank Scotland, comes from a background markedly similar to
many of his peers in the industry.
He has spent most of his career as an accountant, like Forbes Macpherson,
the current chairman. Anderson was deputy senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young
and a former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
Scotland, while Macpherson is a former senior partner of Touche Ross in
Scotland.
They both live in the posh Glasgow suburb of Bearsden and share the same
telephone code. Anderson lives in Manse Road just a couple of doors down
from Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, who helped restore Guinness's fortunes
after the excesses of Ernest Saunders' chairmanship. Anderson and Macfarlane
both went to the High School of Glasgow and are members of Glasgow Golf
club.
However, one can't quibble with the incestuous nature of the Scottish
financial establishment if it guarantees results like those of TSB Bank
Scotland. Last year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 79.4m, or nearly twice
as much as the whole TSB group. Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman of the TSB
Group, says that the Scottish market has always been a significant
contributor to TSB's business and with a mortgage book of Pounds 1.5bn, it
is one of Scotland's largest lenders in the housing market.'
Anderson, who has been a director of TSB Bank Scotland since 1991, takes
over from the 67-year-old Macpherson next March. Anderson has also been
appointed a member of the TSB Group, the parent of TSB Bank Scotland.
