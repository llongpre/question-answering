PROPOSED boundary changes in Scottish constituencies could result in Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader, having to contest a marginal seat at the next
general election.
Under proposals announced yesterday by Scotland's Boundary Commission Mr
Smith's Monklands East constituency near Glasgow would be reshaped and
become vulnerable to the Scottish National Party. A new seat of Cumbernauld
and Airdrie would take in areas of Cumbernauld, where the SNP is strong.
At last year's general election Mr Smith had a majority of 15,712.
The SNP calculated yesterday that ward - by - ward voting in last year's
district council elections in the proposed Cumbernauld and Airdrie
constituency gave the SNP 47.1 per cent of the vote against Labour's 45.2
per cent.
Mr Jack McConnell, secretary of the Labour party in Scotland, said that on
voting records going back for several years he was confident that Labour
would win the seat comfortably, 'especially with the leader of the party
standing'.
But Mr McConnell added that the proposed new boundaries for the area would
be challenged, resulting in a public inquiry, because they cut across
identifiable communities. The boundary commission might then have to come
forward with new proposals.
Under the commission's proposals Glasgow will lose one of its 11 seats, all
of which return Labour MPs. The commission has already proposed the creation
of an additional seat in Aberdeen, reflecting the fact that the population
of the Grampian region has risen while Glasgow's has declined.
The commission's proposals for the Ayr constituency mean that Mr Phil
Gallie, the sitting Tory MP whose majority is 85, would probably lose his
seat.
