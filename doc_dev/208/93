A VISIT to the splendid penthouse offices of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in the
centre of Glasgow, gives a highly instructive overview of the Scottish
commercial property scene.
The lift passes three empty floors on its way up the eighth-storey building
in St Vincent Street. Kenneth Campbell, the managing partner for Scotland,
ushers me out on to the terrace and points to the sole construction crane on
the skyline. 'That's working on a Glasgow district council property,' he
says.
Then, somewhat hesitantly, he points to the several large unoccupied, or
barely occupied, office buildings that dot the city centre, the product of
over-optimistic expansion in the late 1980s. Quickly he switches the
conversation to Edinburgh, where things are a little more cheerful.
Scotland did not have the excesses of the property boom of the south of
England. But Glasgow, always the largest and most stable commercial property
market in Scotland, renewed much of its office stock in the central business
district and boldly extended the core down to the river Clyde with the
Broomielaw development.
Edinburgh, meanwhile, was slower to get started, but significant
developments are now taking place.
In the early 1980s, the Scottish Development Agency struggled to persuade
developers to look at new sites in Glasgow. But towards the end of the
decade developers were taking a much more confident view of the city's
prospects as its image improved. There were high hopes of attracting
businesses and government departments relocating to the city.
The result was that, in the 10 years to 1992, developers added another 3.5m
sq ft of offices to the 16m sq ft office stock; but the stock that was
occupied only rose by 1m sq ft. According to the consultants Erdman Lewis,
supply has been outstripping demand since 1989.
Though Keith Aitken, of KFR, says there is a significant upturn in the
property market this year, with take-up of prime office space running at
higher levels than last year, rents for prime sites have returned to 1989
levels (around Pounds 18 a sq ft prior to incentives) and, according to
Erdman Lewis, will show little growth up to 1995.
In the spring, the property market suffered a cruel disappointment when the
ministry of defence decided to create a new centre for the army's pay and
personnel in the city: but instead of, as had been expected, taking Tay
House, a largely vacant building with a wing straddling the M8 motorway, the
MoD chose to shoehorn the new staff into its existing properties in the
city.
Edinburgh, on the other hand, presents a slightly more cheerful picture.
Cranes are hovering over the new Edinburgh International Conference Centre,
a long-awaited project promoted by the district council and Lothian and
Edinburgh Enterprise, which will anchor the expansion of the business core
of the city south from the Georgian New Town into the Lothian Road area.
Standard Life is to build a new headquarters close by, and Scottish Widows
is seeking planning permission to build on the long-vacant Port Hamilton
site to the south. A joint venture of Cala and Morrison is is hoping to go
ahead with an office development close to the conference centre.
The first move by businesses out of the New Town was to Saltire Court, an
imposing stone-fronted building developed by Scottish Metropolitan. But
coming on the market a little late, it was slow to fill up. Now, however, it
is 98 per cent let, on headline rents of around Pounds 22-Pounds 23 a sq ft.
Furthermore it was recently sold by ScotMet to the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority for Pounds 53.1m, a Pounds 6.5m surplus on book value,
representing a yield of 7 per cent. 'That was a remarkable achievement which
really puts Edinburgh on the agenda for international investors,' says Mr
Peter Smolka, of Hillier Parker, selling agents.
But the other side of the coin is that almost half of Charlotte Square,
formerly the stately core of the Edinburgh office district, is vacant,
following the departure of fund managers, solicitors and accountants to
Saltire Court.
The re-letting of Charlotte Square is held up by two factors. First, a lot
of medium-sized modern accommodation in other parts of the New Town has
recently become available, or will shortly do so, giving Edinburgh occupiers
a range of choice they have not had for years. Second, the district council
imposes intense restrictions on development and alterations in the listed
properties in Charlotte Square.
'The council must now make concessions on the rules to allow open-plan
office space to be created in Charlotte Square behind the Georgian facades,'
says Mr Smolka, 'otherwise the buildings will remain unoccupied and
eventually become derelict.'
On the fringes of the New Town, values have dropped to such an extent that
one or two office properties are returning to residential use, according to
the surveyors Ryden. Out at South Gyle, near the by-pass on the western edge
of Edinburgh, new developments are taking shape that avoid the planning and
traffic constraints of the centre. The infrastructure has been completed at
Edinburgh Park, intended as a prestige office area with harmonised
architectural design, and Scottish Equitable is to build a new headquarters
close by.
Already the two leading Scottish banks, Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of
Scotland, have built large head offices at South Gyle, and Royal Mail is
building a sorting office. Safeway and Marks and Spencer are the lead stores
in the recently opened South Gyle shopping complex.
In Aberdeen, the office property market has become more lively in recent
months, according to Ryden, with an increase in take-up and a rise in
inquiries. The Aberdeen market is driven by the oil industry, and several
oil companies are relocating staff to the city from London, or are planning
to do so.
Available space is on the increase, but speculative developments in Aberdeen
have in the past been rare, though Ryden believes that space built
speculatively would be taken up, given the apparent and latent demand.
Mr Smolka says: 'The perception of Aberdeen is that it is a one-business
economy and therefore more risky to speculative developers than other big
Scottish cities. The big oil companies mostly have their own purpose-built
head offices, so it's not very promising for property investors.'
