FT  06 SEP 94 / People: Crawford relocates to Scottish Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Enterprise, the development organisation for Scotland outside the
Highlands, has put most of its key operations into a single unit and made
Robert Crawford, below, its managing director.
Crawford, 43, is currently director of Locate in Scotland, Scotland's inward
investment agency.
The new unit, called the national operations group, will incorporate Locate
in Scotland, as well as Scottish Enterprise's Scottish and international
operations division, run by Bob Downes, and its business development
division under Russel Griggs. A new director will be sought for Locate in
Scotland.
The new group is being created by Crawford Beveridge, Scottish Enterprise's
chief executive, to integrate different parts of the organisation dealing
with businesses. While foreign companies wanting to set up plants in
Scotland deal with Locate in Scotland, those wanting to trade with Scottish
companies may go to Scottish Trade International, part of Scottish and
international operations.
Robert Crawford will now be in charge of a big chunk of Scottish
Enterprise's headquarters in Glasgow, though most of the organisation's
Pounds 450m budget is spent by the 13 local enterprise companies all over
southern Scotland.
He has had a successful three years running Locate in Scotland; prior to
that he was head of its operations in the US where he helped persuade Sun
Microsystems to locate its European plant in Scotland.
Crawford was educated at Strathclyde university and was then a Kennedy
scholar at Harvard.
After a spell as research officer for the Scottish National party he did a
PhD at Glasgow university, then spent a year with Citibank and three years
with the Fraser of Allander economic institute in Glasgow.
