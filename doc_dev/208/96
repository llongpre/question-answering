STRATHCLYDE regional council, which funds the railway network in the Greater
Glasgow area, yesterday suspended new investment worth Pounds 52m in trains
and tracks because of uncertainty about the network's future under the
government's railway privatisation, James Buxton writes.
Mr Malcolm Waugh, chairman of the council's transport committee, said it
wanted firm commitments from the government that the Strathclyde passenger
transport executive would be involved in the franchising of ScotRail,
British Rail's Scottish operation, and that fares would remain subsidised.
On Tuesday Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, announced that
ScotRail would be one of the first British Rail areas to be managed
autonomously as a prelude to being franchised to private operators after
April 1994.
Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive makes decisions about rail
services in its area and is the largest PTE in Britain. ScotRail operates
the trains, and the regional council puts in an annual subsidy of Pounds
30m, investing Pounds 150m over the past 10 years.
The committee's decision means that the award of a contract for 23 diesel
multiple units, due to be made in the next two months, will be delayed.
Three railway manufacturers have tendered for the work.
In addition, no contracts will be awarded for a Pounds 28m rail link joining
the electric railway networks of north and south Glasgow, and work worth
between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m on a new suburban line from central Glasgow
to Milngavie will not go ahead.
A Pounds 4.5m project to convert a freight line between Rutherglen and
Coatbridge into a passenger line with six new stations is also to be frozen.
All these projects are being partly financed with the use of European
Community structural funds.
