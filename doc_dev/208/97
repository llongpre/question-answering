HUMPHREYS &amp; Glasgow, the venerable but loss-making UK process plant
contractor, is changing hands in a deal that switches ownership from
Dallas-based Enserch Corporation to Jacobs Engineering Group of Pasadena.
The sale, for which terms were not disclosed, comes in the centenary year of
H&amp;G, which was founded by two American-trained engineers, Dr Alexander
Humphreys and Dr Arthur Glasgow, to tackle the carburetted water gas
business in Europe.
Since 1892 H&amp;G has developed a worldwide reputation for its process-plant
contracting skills with expertise in industries ranging from refining to
pharmaceuticals and power generation.
Financially, it has been less successful. As a private company run for more
than 40 years by Mr Ambrose Congreve, Dr Glasgow's son-in-law, it struggled
in the 1970s against increasing competition and dwindling orders, and was
purchased by Enserch in 1983.
Terms were never disclosed - Mr Congreve said at the time: 'I always
understood a gentleman never asked the price' - but were believed to be
about Pounds 10m.
Yesterday Enserch said H&amp;G had been losing money for some years and 'the
strategic fit that we saw 10 years ago does not exist today'. Mr Frank
Edwards, former managing director, says in a book to mark the H&amp;G centenary
that the company was not able to take advantage of the process plant boom in
the late 1980s and did not have a large order backlog to cushion it through
the recession.
H&amp;G's offshore business, employing 650 to 700 people, was sold in February
to Kvaerner of Norway. Jacobs is acquiring the remaining process contracting
business, a 50 per cent stake in a successful new joint venture with Anglian
Water, and a 40 per cent stake in Bombay-based H&amp;G Consultants.
Mr Robert Clement, vice-president of marketing services at Jacobs, said it
had been searching for a long time for the right company to expand its
presence in Europe.
'This is an excellent opportunity to shape and mould H&amp;G into a winning
organisation,' he said. 'Our perception is that the losses are manageable.'
