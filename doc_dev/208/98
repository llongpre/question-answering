When they decided that the Glasgow International Early Music Festival would
be biennial, somebody omitted to count ahead and notice that there would be
no festival in 1995. That is the year of the Purcell tercentenary - well set
to be the biggest early music jamboree that Britain has ever seen.
Glasgow was not to be outdone. For the major attraction of the 1994
festival, it is ambitiously presenting a fully-staged production of The
Indian Queen, one of Purcell's musical works on - or around - a play by
Dryden. Is it an opera? Is it a play with incidental music? Even in
Purcell's day there was some indecision as to who these semi-operas were
intended for, so it is not surprising to find that they rarely get a
showing.
Unfortunately for Purcell enthusiasts, these scores contain some of the
composer's best music. The usual solution is to perform the music in concert
and leave the play as a synopsis in the programme. The commemoration of
Purcell's death next year, however, demands more serious treatment. And it
will get it: both the Royal Opera and ENO have new, fully-staged productions
of the two most famous of the semi-operas planned.
Their tributes will probably be more lavishly staged, better rehearsed and
sung than this Indian Queen (they had better be]) but they will do well to
be half as convincing. On the only other occasion that I have seen The
Indian Queen performed as intended with play and music together, the two
art-forms barely made contact, as though musicians and actors were not on
speaking terms. Kate Brown, the producer in Glasgow, achieves a far greater
unity than that.
Unlike The Fairy Queen or King Arthur, this work does draw music into the
heart of the drama. The key scene is the wicked queen's visit to the
sorcerer's cave, where Purcell devised sinister music of the supernatural to
create a world far removed from the earthly scenes of the rest of the play.
David Thomas was marvellous as the sorcerer Ismeron, growling in his deepest
bass tones for the spoken lines and slowly rousing himself into song.
Otherwise, Purcell mostly tried to elaborate general themes from the drama,
an exotic story set among Aztec warriors. There is not a lot else one could
do with the play, which rarely bothers itself with such disciplines as logic
or restraint. Triumphant generals regularly change sides at the drop of a
helmet and unconquerable tyrants are liable to be seen in chains in the next
scene for no apparent reason. Juliet Cadzow played the Indian Queen as a
cross between Boadicea and Cruella de Vil. Out of ludicrous material Matthew
Whittle and Dan Maxwell did well to create serious male leads.
The musicians have an easier time of it, as Purcell's score is overflowing
with songs and dance music that have brilliance of character already written
in. The soprano Tinuke Olafimihan stood out among the singers. Gregory
Squire conducted the Baroque Orchestra of the Scottish Early Music Consort
with more zest than tidiness. They should all thank Kate Brown for giving
them a production (designed by Louise Belson) which had wit and
effervescence. It is amazing what one can achieve with a tiny budget and a
big imagination.
Final performance at the Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
