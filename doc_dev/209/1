THE POPULAR conception of Dr Johnson, derived from Boswell's Life, as the
great fulminator and layer down of the law, becomes modified when his
letters are read consecutively. A new edition of his correspondence, the
most complete so far, brings out the many-sidedness of the man: Johnson the
loving husband with a sick wife, replaced soon by Johnson the widower who is
in spite of his own grief a constant support and morale-raiser for his
friends and fellow authors, men and women. Then there is Johnson the
freelance who is his own literary agent; and Johnson the dedicated classical
scholar, part of an erudite network of friends and colleagues regularly
exchanging information. All these Johnsons come through more powerfully than
ever before.
Many of the letters are well-known - not just from previous scholarly
editions, mainly the one in 1952 from Oxford by RW Chapman - but also from
Boswell and from being printed in full in books such as John Wain's Johnson
on Johnson where the texts of letters are taken from the Chapman edition.
'Chapman', said Wain, 'worked on Johnson's letters from 1919 to 1952; what
he did not know about them, I for one am content to go on not knowing.'
Not everyone, though, was so content with the Chapman edition. The American
Johnson specialist Bruce Redford, professor of English at the University of
Chicago, has been hard at work with his students for many years on an
entirely new edition of the letters of Johnson and now we have before us the
bulk of it in three volumes. This is called the Hyde Edition: it derives
from the Hyde Collection partly formed by Mary Hyde Eccles (Lady Eccles)
without whose scholarly enthusiasm this new edition would not have been
possible.
The first volume begins in 1731: Johnson, recently down from Oxford without
a degree, writes from Lichfield to Edward Cave, editor of The Gentleman's
Magazine, trying to interest him in taking some work. By the third volume
Johnson has become a famous man, having made his name with the appearance of
his Dictionary in 1757. He writes in 1781 to his friend Mrs Thrale, the
brewer's widow, assuring her that his affection for her is not diminished.
Before his death three years later he will break with her completely.
Redford found Chapman's edition inadequate in several respects. In his three
volumes Chapman printed, all told, 1,515 Johnson letters. Redford has
discovered 52 more and he 'strongly doubts the authenticity' of four printed
by Chapman which he has dropped from the canon. A recurrent problem for any
editor is Johnson's hand-writing, which is often difficult to decipher.
Chapman spotted mistakes made by earlier editors but then went on to make
some of his own. His 'Mr J Combe', for example, in a letter of 1770, turns
out in reality to have been Henry Thrale's nephew, Ralph Plumbe.
Clearly then, Chapman's has now been superseded by this new edition. It will
be completed by a further two volumes in 1994, one of letters from 1782-84,
and one containing appendices and a comprehensive index. The ordinary reader
will wish to ask, is all this no doubt admirable scholarly work of editing
going to alter our view of Johnson radically? Many of the texts of the
letters do in fact appear here in exactly the words they appeared hitherto,
including such famous letters as the one in February 1755 to Chesterfield
about the Dictionary ('Seven years, my Lord have now past since I waited in
your outward Rooms or was repulsed from your Door . . .') and the one to
James Macpherson of January 1975 in which Johnson spiritedly refused to
retract a single word of his view that the Ossian manuscripts never existed
and that the whole thing was a fraud - as indeed it was.
Nonetheless, Redford says of his edition that it 'aims ultimately to provide
the materials for a fresh assessment of Samuel Johnson, man of letters'.
Previous editors have, in Redford's view, seriously misinterpreted Johnson's
tone in his letters to Hester Thrale, and by reading them in this edition we
may now see how crucial these letters were to Johnson's discovery of his own
potential. They do not represent a great man humouring a tiresome woman, as
earlier editors tended to think, but are evidence of a deep mutual bond.
Among the material not included at all in Chapman, there are printed here 12
letters to the novelist Charlotte Lennox, author of The Females Quixote.
These, says Redford are 'outstanding in biographical significance'.
The Lennox Collection of 42 letters came to light in the Dunfermline branch
of a Scottish bank in 1964 and was acquired by the Houghton Library, where
the letters were edited and published by Duncan Isles. His work is fully
acknowledged in the copious footnotes to the Hyde Edition. When read in
Isles's edition in the Harvard Library Bulletin, the dozen Johnson letters
in the Collection - the ones printed here by Redford - are seen to dovetail
with letters to Mrs Lennox from several other eminent men, such as Lord
Orrery, David Garrick, Samuel Richardson, 18th century English gentlemen who
went out of their way to aid this gifted woman writer.
This is not to underestimate the importance of placing those letters written
specifically by Johnson to Mrs Lennox in the chronological context of his
entire correspondence and to find confirmed the admiration that he had for
her lively mind. This enhanced view of their relations is one of the fresh
perspectives opened for all Johnsonians by the appearance of this new
edition.
Johnson and Boswell speak nowadays with two different voices to two
different audiences. One voice addresses the professors and post-graduate
students whose field is 18th century English literature. The other voice
speaks to the audience represented by - in Johnson's own words - the common
reader. Boswell's journals have always been issued in two separate editions,
a popular one with a minimum of apparatus, and a scholarly one with the full
panoply of footnotes and textual glosses.
The latest book in the popular series is the one-volume selection from all
previous editions of Boswell's journals edited by John Wain. Boswell's
amorous hopes and disappointments, encounters with the famous and the lowly,
as he set them down, are one of the greatest literary bombshells to have
exploded in our century. From them Boswell emerged as a person in his own
right quite separate from Johnson. We can conveniently sample his whole
character here.
A sense of the need for a book about Johnson not seen exclusively through
the eyes of Boswell prompted Wain to write a fresh life of Johnson in 1974
and in 1976 to edit the book Johnson on Johnson (the 1000th volume in
Everyman's Library). The common reader might find the view from its nursery
slopes a useful preliminary vantage-point before scaling the majestic
heights of Redford's great new edition of Johnson's letters.
