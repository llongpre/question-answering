   BIOGRAPHY: Master Sgt. Samuel Kanyon Doe led a bloody coup April
12, 1980, that ended the rule of President William Tolbert, who was
killed.
   Doe's presidency has been characterized by numerous coup
attempts, murders and detentions of opposition leaders and
suppression of the country's press.
   Doe permitted elections in October 1985. When opposition parties
appeared to have won the voting, Doe's men burned and destroyed
ballots. The election commission Doe had appointed declared him the
winner.
   The election rigging triggered the worst violence yet under
Doe's rule. At least 1,500 people were estimated to have died,
including Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, who led a coup attempt.
   Quiwonkpa had been a popular commander from Nimba County and his
killing made his home area a fertile base for the Dec. 24, 1989,
invasion of Liberia by rebel leader Charles Taylor.
