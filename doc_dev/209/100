MADAME DU DEFFAND AND HER WORLD by Benedetta Craveri Halban Pounds 20, 481
pages
Paris was a place of scandal during the period of the duc d'Orlean's regency
in the early 18th century. Orgies were held in the Regent's rooms every
evening, involving behaviour so lubricious that its contemporary chroniclers
dared not name it.
At the height of the Regent's excesses, shortly before his death, a young
newly-married woman joined his bacchanalia and became his mistress. She was
a sparklingly vivacious, witty woman with beautiful eyes: Marie de
Vichy-Champrond, marquise du Deffand.
This was a spectacular arrival on the social scene for a young woman not
long out of convent school, not long married - and not long separated from
her milk-sop husband. It presaged the rising of a new star in the French
social firmament. Mme du Deffand became one of Paris's great salon
hostesses, and because of her friendships with D'Alembert, Voltaire, the
duchesse de Choiseul, and especially with Horace Walpole, she made
substantial contributions to one of the 18th-century's richest literary
traditions: the art of letter-writing.
In this translation of her much-praised biography, Benedetta Craveri paints
an extraordinarily rich portrait of Mme du Deffand and her world. It is not
a biography in the straightforward sense, so it proves an advantage to know
the outlines of Mme du Deffand's life before reading Craveri, whose primary
concern is with the nuances of the marquise's complex relationships and
their even more complex setting. Craveri explores both through the
marquise's vast surviving correspondence, which shimmers with historical and
literary fascinations.
Mme du Deffand was born into an aristocratic family at Champrond in 1697. At
her convent she preached irreligion to her fellow-pupils, so the Mother
Abbess summoned the great Massillon to correct her. He failed, commenting as
he left 'She is charming]' Her parents married her to a cousin, the marquis
du Deffand, but they soon separated, whereupon Mme du Deffand began her
career of dissipation.
After the Regent's death she was for a long time a companion of the royal
duchesse du Maine, who kept court at her chateau at Sceaux. The chief
pastime there was theatricals. Here Mme du Deffand established her
reputation as a wit and mistress of repartee; and here she enjoyed the best
years of her long-standing affair with Jean-Francois Henault, president of
the parlement of Paris.
It was only in middle-age that Mme du Deffand established her own salon,
based in the secular wing of the convent of St Joseph in Paris. Its handsome
apartments were famously decorated in buttercup yellow watered silk
decorated with flame-coloured bows, which visitors came from all over Europe
to admire.
It was a salon for aristocrats, not savants; with the exceptions of her
lifelong friend Voltaire, D'Alembert - whom for a time she loved - and,
briefly, Rousseau, she hated the philosophes, holding it against Diderot
that he was such an ill-mannered lout that he used inadvertently to kick
Catherine the Great's shins while explaining points of philosophy to her.
Instead, her salon entertained aristocrats increasingly at odds with the new
world of the Enlightenment, who looked back to the manners and values of the
days of Louis XIV.
At the age of 55 Mme du Deffand went blind. (Voltaire said 'she has been
punished whereby she made others sin.') She employed Julie de Lespinasse to
help her run her salon. While the clever and lovely Julie was at her side,
the literati still attended; but then Mme du Deffand discovered that Julie
and D'Alembert were having an affair, and that the literati arrived early to
spend time with Julie on her own; so the women quarrelled, and Julie left,
taking the literati with her.
But the greatest was yet to be. Horace Walpole, gothic novelist son of the
British Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole, became an habitue of Mme du
Deffand's salon, and she - though 20 years his senior - fell in love with
him. Walpole did not return the sentiment, but was drawn to her nonetheless
by her intelligence and perceptive wit. As a result he drew her best work
from her, in the form of letters. By his prompting and example he made Mme
du Deffand reveal in her letters a high order of literary talent.
Mme du Deffand suffered terribly from what she called ennui and she is one
of the first true chroniclers of ennui as an existential agony. But despite
it, she took by sheer force of character and intellect a position at the
centre of French 18th century life, her intimate record of which is not only
one of the great literary achievements of the time, but a great historical
document.
