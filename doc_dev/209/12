Henry Adams by Ernest Samuels (The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press: 
$25; 504 pages). 
</P>
<P>
"Porcupinus Angeliscus," Secretary of State John Hay called Henry Adams, his 
gossip, walking companion, close friend, and co-owner of the double mansion 
across from the White House which stands today as the Hay-Adams Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"The fox knows many things; the porcupine knows one thing well," Sir Isaiah 
Berlin wrote. All his long life -- 1838 to 1918 -- Adams bore a porcupine's 
head upon a fox's skibbling legs. They trotted him restlessly from mastery to 
mastery without ever staying long enough to move in. 
</P>
<P>
Classical historian, philosopher of history, political insider, novelist, 
professor, muckraking editor, conversationalist, husband, grand Platonic 
(though unwillingly) lover, epicure, puritan and, for a year, a fastidious 
South Seas drifter: Adams was all these things, many of them with brilliance. 
Yet they all eluded him or, more accurately, he eluded all of them. When his 
brother, Charles Francis Adams Jr., asked his help in preparing a biography of 
their father, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
"Make any use of me that you like just as though I were real." 
</P>
<P>
Fourth in a line of famous Adamses -- John, John Quincy, Charles Francis -- 
Henry angrily struggled with the family curse of being so high-minded as to 
reach a summit and then drift off upwards. He ran all the races, and well 
enough to win; but because he could not allow himself to want the prize, he 
never quite ran any race at all. 
</P>
<P>
Except one, and that one without running. He wrote some of the most 
extraordinary sentences in American letters. His genius was a series of 
specific and powerful brilliancies that glitter in his best books and 
particularly in his collected letters. He was a master miniaturist who 
attempted murals and got lost. 
</P>
<P>
Even "The Education of Henry Adams," which carries along wonderfully for 
awhile, sinks struggling into its own quicksand of high-reaching and 
half-articulated thought. William James wrote Adams to commend the early parts 
of the book. But, he added cautiously, "a great deal of the later diplomatic 
history is dealt with so much by hint and implication that to an ignoramus like 
W. J. it reads obscurely." 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Samuels, who had spent his life on Adams' life, makes a spectacular 
effort to assay and describe the cloudy convolutions of such speculative works 
as "Mount Saint Michel and Chartres," and of Adams's theories on history. 
Sometimes, as with a long and devoted marriage, the features of Samuels' 
writing come to resemble those of its subject, both in its witty pinpointing 
and in its clouds. But even he tells us finally -- and it reflects Adams's own 
unsleeping self-awareness: 
</P>
<P>
"Adams could not either state his problem or wholly know what he himself 
meant." 
</P>
<P>
Samuels' three-volume biography was powerful and artful scrutiny of the man who 
doubted he was real. It is a classic, but three volumes in this case may itself 
constitute a kind of practical unreality. Now the biographer has condensed and 
refined his work into one volume, benefitting from additional material that has 
come to light. 
</P>
<P>
It starts off, appropriately, with a high-minded refusal. As a child, Henry 
observed his grandfather, John Quincy, declining to attend a Boston banquet for 
President Tyler. It was a protest against Tyler's slave-holding; even more, it 
was a slap in the face of the Boston financial Establishment for its 
complaisance towards slave-holding interests. 
</P>
<P>
Always a virtuous remnant, the Adamses were never at ease even in the city that 
most of us associate them with. Henry could not even abide its virtues -- nor 
ever quite get away from them. He called Boston "a provincial city in which 
intellectual life has foundered in moral earnestness." All his life he worked, 
not really successfully, to strip himself of what he called "my Bostonianism 
and finikin clinging to what I think best." When Harvard tried to give him an 
honorary doctorate, he wriggled and temporized and introduced so many caveats 
before refusing, that finally President Charles Elliot wrote stiffly reminding 
him that "You are not conferring the degree on yourself -- it is the act of the 
University." 
</P>
<P>
It epitomized his brilliant, hopeless, comical and rather grand pursuit of a 
three-legged contradiction: to be an Adams, to make a mark on a brawling, 
vulgar United States, and to infuse this cigar-chewing, money-grubbing, 
immensely vital country with the spiritual and cultural values of European 
civilization. It made him alternately reach out and pull back, whether as a 
Washington insider-outsider or as a celebrator of old-world sophistication and 
political dialectic. He managed to be an aesthete on close terms with the likes 
of Bernard Berenson, to be a parlor Marxist, and to be a genteel conspirator 
for Cuban independence. "Come and revolute Cuba," he wrote to Hay -- not yet in 
the government -- at one point. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, his salon was a privileged window on national politics. Everyone 
came by to tell him things. At the same time, along with his wife, Clover -- 
until she killed herself in an access of depression -- Mr. and Mrs. Hay, and 
several others of the elect, he set standards for snobbishness. Even President 
Rutherford Hays found himself snubbed one day when he walked over to join Henry 
and several of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Samuels' volume gets in all in, along with Adams's travels, his writings, and 
the long unconsummated love affair, after his wife's death, with Elizabeth 
Cameron, another Washington grande dame. She sent him away, called him back, 
she would and she wouldn't. Finally, she didn't. Possibly this was to his 
relief; he wrote her with melancholy wit: "I am not old enough to be your tame 
cat. You are too old to accept me in any other character." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps wit -- melancholy, choleric, exhilarated -- was, after all, his true 
passion and bedrock reality. Certainly his letters, from which Samuels quotes 
generously and well, demonstrate it. This one-volume compression calls urgently 
for another: a selection of letters from Harvard University Press's six-volume 
set.
