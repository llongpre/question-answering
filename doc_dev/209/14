   Liberian President Samuel K. Doe took power in a violent coup a
decade ago and left power in the same manner.
   His capture Sunday by fighters loyal to rebel leader Prince
Johnson comes 8{ months after insurgents began their battle to
unseat him. The civil war has claimed more than 5,000 lives and
re-opened the ethnic divisions that Doe used to take power.
   Sixty-four people, including many of Doe's bodyguards, were
killed in the battle Sunday, the British Broadcasting Corp. said.
Doe was reported wounded in both legs. The fight took place outside
the headquarters of the West African task force sent to end the
country's civil war.
   Doe claimed he had thwarted 30 attempts to topple him since
April 12, 1980, when he led a band of 17 sergeants who ended
domination of this West African nation by the descendants of freed
American slaves.
   Doe, son of an army private, personally led the charge into the
executive mansion of President William Tolbert, who was killed. The
sergeants publicly executed 13 other prominent Americo-Liberians
several days later.
   Born in blood, Doe's rule was characterized by numerous murders
and detentions of opposition leaders and suppression of the
country's press.
   In August 1981 he had five of his closest associates shot for
allegedly planning a coup against him. Later a president guard
commander was executed in similar circumstances.
   After more than five years of military rule Doe permitted
elections in 1985. The election rules Doe had approved required
presidential candidates to be at least 35 years old.
   His official biography listed his birthdate as May 6, 1952. The
year was scratched out, 1950 written in, and the biography handed
out to reporters.
   When opposition parties appeared to have won the Oct. 15, 1985
voting, Doe's men burned and destroyed ballots. The election
commission Doe had appointed declared him the winner.
   On Nov. 12, 1985, another former close associate, a sergeant who
like Doe had been named a general after the revolution, attacked
Monrovia. His men took over local radio stations and appeared to
control the city before Doe counterattacked.
   At least 1,500 people were estimated to have died. Brig. Gen.
Thomas Quiwonkpa, who led the coup attempt, reportedly was
disemboweled after being captured.
   Quiwonkpa had been a popular commander from Nimba County and his
killing made his home area a fertile base for the Dec. 24, 1989
invasion of Liberia by rebel leader Charles Taylor.
   Doe, in announcing he would not seek another term as president,
said he has survived 35 or 36 coup attempts and would be happy to
leave the ``burden of leading a country ... the political
harassment'' to someone else.
   The former master sergeant, described by foes as impulsive and
by friends as brave, visited the scene of a bloody assault by his
own troops on refugees in Monrovia. He met with victims and
promised to help them, and vowed to executed the masked soldiers
who had committed the attack.
   ``Remember that tough times don't last, only tough people do,''
Doe once said at a news conference.
   By all economic standards the country has declined sharply since
Doe took power. But it was already broke when he arrived. It had
huge budget deficit and a foreign debt of $800 million.
   The goal of his revolution had largely been simply to end the
rule of the elite descendants of American slaves. He also wanted
better pay and conditions for soldiers.
   Doe worked hard, taking college classes, speech tutoring, and
shifting from army fatigues to a three-piece suit.
   Since July, Doe had been holed up in his mansion as street
fighting raged in the capital. His troops _ many of them members of
his Krahn tribe _ reportedly refused to let him flee without
obtaining assurances for their own safety.
   The rebels have accused Doe of nepotism and stealing millions of
dollars of state money. They also hold him responsible for the
deaths of thousands of civilians killed during the civil war.
