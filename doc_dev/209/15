   Lady Bird Johnson said Tuesday that some of
the things written about her husband would make her angry if she
read them, so ``the simplest thing is not to read them.''
   That was the closest the former first lady, meeting with
reporters before a speech winding up a Johnson administration
reunion, came to commenting on the furor over Robert Caro's ``Means
of Ascent.''
   The book, the second volume of a projected multi-volume
biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, has been sharply criticized by
Johnson associates and some reviewers who say it is unduly harsh on
the 36th president.
   Caro defends his research and says a more positive picture of
Johnson's achievements will emerge in later volumes.
   Mrs. Johnson, asked simply whether ``negative'' books and other
writings about her late husband made her angry, replied, ``I'm sure
they would if I read them, so the simplest thing is not to read
them.''
   The former first lady was interviewed in the front parlor of the
Woman's National Democratic Club, with pictures of herself and
other presidential wives on the wall. Visible through a window was
a garden she dedicated during the Johnsons' White House years.
   Mrs. Johnson was in Washington for a series of events in
connection with the 25th anniversary of Johnson's inauguration as
an elected president in 1965.
   In her speech, the widow of the man who was president from 1963
to 1969 dealt mainly with her work on behalf of beautification and
the environment, both while in the White House and since leaving it.
   Mrs. Johnson told reporters the reunion has been fun, although
``neither my eyes nor my legs are as strong as they once were.''
   She said she wouldn't want to be back in the White House, though.
   ``It's too much of a crescendo of activity, and when you are 77,
you want to lie in the hammock and savor the world.''
