<P>
Everything about Lyndon Baines Johnson was outsized. His physical bulk, his 
energy, his ambition, his tirades, his deceptions and even his ears made 
Johnson a political mega-force. 
</P>
<P>
No less forceful is the work of Robert Caro. The former newspaper reporter has 
labored for 14 years to turn the life of Johnson into what will be a 
four-volume biography that, he says, will tell the darkness-and-light tale of 
how a poor boy from the lonely Hill Country of Texas acquired power in 
Congress, became a millionaire, clawed his way to the U.S. Senate in a "stolen" 
election, ascended with alacrity to become Senate Majority Leader and twisted 
arms as President to turn his civil rights initiatives into law. 
</P>
<P>
Caro's L.B.J. in the newly published second volume, "Means of Ascent" (Alfred 
A. Knopf), is unrelentingly dark. There is none of the 
Johnson-as-the-boy-wonder depicted in the first volume, the young congressman 
who brought electricity to the 200,000 farmers and ranchers of his rural 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The L.B.J. in "Means of Ascent" angrily stalks through the bleakest wilderness 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
But, like Johnson, the second volume of Caro's opus is ambitious and 
compelling. Even Horace Busby, a longtime Johnson adviser, who disagrees with 
Caro's savage evocation of the period, says: "My feeling is he's making the man 
a legend. Carl Sandburg would have to write another book about Lincoln to keep 
up with Caro." 
</P>
<P>
Knopf has dispatched 250,000 copies of "Means of Ascent" across the country, up 
from the original 200,000 first printing. The book is a main selection of the 
Book-of-the-Month-Club and six excerpts of it have appeared in the New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
Caro has spent seven years on each of his books: "Means of Ascent," "The Path 
to Power," which earned Caro the National Book Critics Circle award for 
nonfiction and "The Power Broker," Caro's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of 
New York's master-builder, Robert Moses. He has also spent part of the past 14 
years on a novel about the newspaper business, which he left in 1967. All he 
will say of it is that "it is immense." 
</P>
<P>
Working with his wife, Ina, a medieval historian and his research assistant, 
Caro has spent months at a time in Texas, reading some of the 34 million papers 
in the Johnson Library in Austin and driving rented cars thousands of miles 
across the state for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
If possible, Caro wants to be where Johnson was, to visualize what molded his 
subject, much as Francis Parkman, the historian Caro admires most, did when 
writing about the American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
When Caro didn't comprehend Johnson's upbringing in the lonely Hill Country and 
residents didn't trust that the city boy with the New York accent was committed 
to knowing them, he and Ina moved near them for parts of three years. He gained 
their trust and their unembellished memories. 
</P>
<P>
When he wanted to understand the area's loneliness, he took a sleeping bag and 
camped out on a ranch for four days, waiting as Lyndon and his brother, Sam, 
once waited for a car to come by so they'd have somebody to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
In 14 years of studying his subject at the Johnson Library, 787 document boxes 
filled with notes, memoranda, letters, telephone transcripts and speeches -- 
altogether about 629,000 pages of documents, have been delivered to Caro in the 
eighth-floor research room. 
</P>
<P>
Caro says he has dug deeper and wider than any biographer (there have been 21 
others) to understand Johnson. "Everything in this book," Caro says, "is true 
and documented beyond the possibility of any doubt. That's just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
What Caro covers in "Means of Ascent" is a seven-year period in Johnson's life, 
from 1941 to 1948, when the future President saw his way blocked to power in 
the House of Representatives and election to the Senate. He had lost a special 
1941 Senate election and reluctantly stayed out of the 1942 race, to follow 
through on a promise to fight in "the trenches" if war brought out. 
</P>
<P>
He was no longer the pet of House Speaker Sam Rayburn or a President's southern 
protege after Franklin Roosevelt's death in 1945. He craved influence and 
money, but had neither. As he eyed the 1948 Senate election, Caro writes, it 
was "all or nothing." If Johnson lost, he'd return to a life he dreaded, to 
being ordinary and poor, like his daddy. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnson of Caro's uncompromising portrait of these years "is unrelieved by 
redeeming social values," says Robert Gottlieb, the editor of the New Yorker, 
who has edited all of Caro's books for Knopf. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a picture corroborated by Johnson confidants like John Connally and 
Horace Busby -- who admit they can't fault Caro's reporting, just his 
conclusions. Connally, former governor of Texas and secretary of the treasury, 
says: "For whatever reason, Caro has painted the dark side of Johnson without 
the benefit of the doubt on anything. Why I don't know. But the problem in 
arguing with Caro is it's impossible to dispute his facts. I don't argue the 
facts, but the nuances and interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
Caro shakes his head at Connally's remarks. Connally refused to speak to Caro 
until two years after the publication of "The Path to Power." Says Caro: "My 
interviews with him were four days of the most fascinating interviews I've ever 
had. When we started talking, he was enthusiastic about the book. But since he 
started his own book, that enthusiasm has lessened. He told me the reason he 
talked to me was because I had gotten Johnson 'right on the head' and he didn't 
want me to write any more volumes without him." 
</P>
<P>
Says Busby: "I'm not detracting from his work, but Johnson was a many-sided man 
who was difficult to capture. Caro doesn't deal with the extreme sensitivity of 
the man, and I was closer to that side of him than anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
From the start of his work, Caro's goal has been to separate legend from truth 
by speaking to people never interviewed before and pressing others to 
reconstruct events as they happened. Among the parts of the Johnson legend Caro 
disassembles: 
</P>
<P>
* Johnson's war service. After a desultory 10 weeks of inspecting shipyards for 
the Navy, a period enlivened only by parties and practical jokes, and after 
Roosevelt rebuffed him for high-level Washington desk jobs, Roosevelt sent 
Johnson to the Southwest Pacific to survey the war effort. While Johnson 
maintained that he played an important combat role, he was only an observer on 
a bomber that saw 13 minutes of action against Japanese Zero fighters. Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur awarded him the Silver Star. Back home, L.B.J. had the Silver 
Star pinned on him at public appearances, and became the increasingly heroic 
"Raider" Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
* Johnson's wealth. As President, Johnson maintained that the broadcasting 
empire that started with buying the KTBC radio station in Austin in 1943 was 
built by Lady Bird. He had nothing to do with it. But Caro shows that it was 
Johnson's influence with the FCC that helped buy the station, change it to 
full-day operation and shift it to a better frequency. It was Lyndon who won a 
CBS radio affiliation for KTBC, unavailable to a rival Austin station. It was 
Lyndon to whom influence-seeking local lawyers and businessmen came with open 
pockets to advertise. 
</P>
<P>
Caro intended "Means of Ascent" to carry Johnson up to John F. Kennedy's 
assassination in 1963, but he stopped in 1948, the year of Johnson's "stolen" 
victory in a Senate primary runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The primary campaign matched Johnson, running as if for his life, and Coke 
Stevenson, the stoic former three-term governor who never made promises or 
presented a campaign platform. Stevenson won the primary by 71,000 votes, but 
it wasn't enough to avoid a run-off. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next is why material that began as one chapter turned into 
two-thirds of Caro's book. 
</P>
<P>
"If I showed the 1948 campaign in depth, I could show things I've always wanted 
to show about American politics," says Caro. "I could show the full 
destructiveness of the new media politics on the political process. In Coke 
Stevenson, you had the old politics in a pure example. It was the end of an 
era; no one ever campaigned like this again in Texas. And here is Lyndon 
Johnson with his new politics and media manipulation. He didn't create the new 
politics, but he brought it to a new maturity." 
</P>
<P>
That the run-off was stolen is not disputed. But Caro disproves the myth that 
the votes filched in Johnson's name represented business as usual in Texas 
politics and that everybody did it -- even Coke Stevenson. Caro found that no 
race had ever witnessed a vote theft so massive, where thousands of votes 
shifted to Johnson for six days after balloting closed. Johnson's puny 87-vote 
margin of victory was contrived when the corrupt Rio Grande Valley political 
boss, George Parr, ordered Luis Salas, an election judge in Jim Wells County, 
to add 200 votes for Johnson. "If the votes were not for Johnson, "I make them 
for Johnson," Salas later said. 
</P>
<P>
Caro does not say Johnson directed the vote thefts. But he does not believe 
denials that L.B.J. lacked personal knowledge of what was being done in his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"For 40 years, people didn't know what happened," says Caro, "and I said I 
wasn't going to write a biography of Lyndon Johnson where in the pivotal point 
in his career, I'm not going to know the truth." 
</P>
<P>
But it was not the election that tantalized Caro as much as Coke Stevenson, the 
symbol of the end of the old ways. In Stevenson, Caro found the perfect 
antithesis to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Caro wasn't prepared for Stevenson; he had barely heard of him until people who 
knew Johnson told stories of the cowboy governor's honesty. In the capital of 
Austin, Stevenson was known as the man who could not be bought. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1948 campaign, Johnson lied about Stevenson's positions; he 
insulted, mocked and aped him. Repetition was the key. But Stevenson wouldn't 
reply. Johnson's new politics trampled Stevenson's old politics. Unlimited cash 
let Johnson pound his message over the radio airwaves. Stevenson campaigned 
simply, driving into towns, giving speeches on courthouse steps. 
</P>
<P>
Connally says Caro "beatified" Stevenson to set up Johnson as "the man in the 
black hat. There was no balance at all. Stevenson was an old-style politician 
who was well-regarded; he sure wasn't all that beloved." 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't say anything about Stevenson's integrity, did he?" asks Caro. No. 
Caro nods, certain as ever, of the rightness of his portrait. 
</P>
<P>
Caro writes in an office on West 57th Street, not far from the apartment he and 
Ina, who were married 32 years ago, share on Central Park West. His workplace 
is spare: a stained white couch, dirty walls, unwashed windows, scratched wood 
bookcases, used file cabinets and a shabby desk. 
</P>
<P>
He arrives each morning about 8, but when thoughts rouse him from his sleep, 
he'll be at his desk before sunrise. He hates distractions; when he writes, he 
shuts off the telephone and answering machine. The mail slot on his door is 
blocked with a steel plate. 
</P>
<P>
He is an exacting perfectionist who doesn't think he's taking too much time to 
study Johnson and who believes that the truth takes time. He wonders why, after 
he's set down all the facts, people could disagree with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that while someone may quibble with me," he says, "they'd be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
For all his intensity and what Gottlieb calls "his free-floating anxiety," Caro 
is unfailingly polite and respectful. It's not difficult to visualize how Caro 
induces Johnson friends and intimates like lawyer Ed Clark, a Texas power for 
40 years, and contractor George Brown of Brown &amp; Root, which helped 
bankroll Johnson's campaigns -- men who had never talked to biographers or whom 
other biographers ignored -- to open up. 
</P>
<P>
"My models for interviewing are George Smiley and George Simenon's Inspector 
Maigrit," says Caro. "What distinguishes both is their empathy, how they 
understand what they're hearing rather than ask a lot of questions. I'm always 
writing 'shut up' to myself in the note pad." 
</P>
<P>
One Caro technique is to take interviewees back to key places to help them 
recall important moments in Johnson's life. In Volume One, he took Lyndon's 
brother, Sam Houston Johnson, back to the family home to re-create the searing 
arguments between Lyndon and their father. 
</P>
<P>
Caro almost always refuses to use a tape recorder, except for rare technical 
interviews. A wooden cabinet in his office stores precisely stacked piles of 
pads, each annotated on the cover with the people interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Many more notebooks will be filled before Caro is done. He is now writing about 
Johnson's Senate years in Volume Three, covering the period when Johnson became 
the most powerful majority leader in history. This time, threads of dark and 
light run together, as Johnson uses questionable means to pass early civil 
rights legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"His personality doesn't change," says Caro. "All the old traits, good and bad 
are there, but he's using them in a noble cause. To watch him tirelessly 
maneuver the civil rights legislation with his savage energy is fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
"If I portray him right," adds Caro, sitting on the edge of his couch, 
excitedly describing the work that lies before him, "we will never have to ask 
again what one aspect of political genius is. This is it. That's why I raise 
the relationship between ends and means. By the time you finish my four 
volumes, anyone who wants to talk about the relationship between ends and means 
will have the material." 
</P>
<P>
Caro has been observing Senate action from its overhead gallery and examining 
papers, memos, letters and telephone transcripts of Johnson's contemporaries. 
Caro says the most revealing information comes from the papers of lesser-known 
senators. "The story of how he came to power has never been told," he says, 
"because some of the collections have never been looked at." 
</P>
<P>
Caro is bluntly confident that he will come closer than any biographer to 
knowing the man who could muscle into law both the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution 
and the Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
One person who disagrees with Caro's self-assurance is UCLA history professor 
Robert Dallek. He says that he's done the historical research that will yield a 
more accurate portrait of Johnson, which he will publish in two volumes, the 
first to be published late this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Caro is a muckraking investigative journalist who does a lot of interviewing, 
and he's painted a portrait of saints and sinners, with elements of cartoon and 
caricature," he says. "I've done interviews, but mine is based on 116 
manuscript collections. My books rest on the contemporary record more than the 
memories of people about events from 30 or 50 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Does Robert Caro hate Lyndon Johnson? No, says Caro. "Means of Ascent' was 
meant to be dark, but it is only seven years. Lyndon Johnson is not the sum of 
his actions between 1941 and 1948. His positive impulses, manifested in rural 
electrification in the 1930s and social justice legislation of the 1960s, did 
not emerge in this period. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to know this personality," says Caro. "It may be unpleasant to know. 
His presidency was a watershed in American history. The country changed. In a 
watershed, on the top of a divide; waters on one side run in one direction and 
on the other side, they run in the other direction. That was Lyndon Johnson's 
presidency. It wasn't solely because of his personality, but if you have a long 
list of factors why history changed during his presidency, the personality of 
this President has an unusually heavy weight in the equation. You have to 
understand that."
