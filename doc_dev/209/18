   Robert Caro can understand why some Lyndon
Johnson supporters are unhappy with with the second of a
four-volume series on the former president's life.
   Caro also felt disappointed. ``I really thought I was going to
love him,'' said Caro, author of ``The Years of Lyndon Johnson:
Means of Ascent.''
   ``When I started on the series, I thought he was like (former
New York Gov.) Al Smith. There were great similarities. They were
both very uneducated, physically unattractive,'' said Caro, who
wrote of Smith in the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``The Power Broker:
Robert Moses and the Fall of New York.''
   ``But Al Smith, while he was a ruthless politician, I thought
Smith's motivating drive underneath was his desire to help his
people, like the Irish immigrants,'' said Caro, who has spent 14
years studying Johnson's life. ``I had the same image of Lyndon
Johnson when I started and it was an image that died hard.''
   What Caro claims to have discovered was that Johnson was a
self-centered politician obsessed with power, willing to do
anything _ steal a U.S. Senate election, wildly exaggerate his war
record, even risk his life _ to advance himself.
   Caro's first volume, ``The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Path to
Power,'' was published in 1982 and also riled some Johnson
supporters.
   Former Johnson aide Jack Valenti has accused Caro of being
``passionately bent on destroying'' the late president's
reputation. Bob Hardesty, a Johnson speechwriter who helped him
write his memoirs, called Caro's biography dishonest.
   ``I don't think it pretends to be fair. I think it is the work
of a man with a burning, unnatural hatred for his subject,''
Hardesty said.
   Caro denied bias. He said his assertions are supported by books,
newspapers, court documents, files obtained from the Johnson
Library and by interviews with Johnson's widow, Lady Bird, and
others.
   ``Means of Ascent,'' published by Alfred A. Knopf, begins with
Johnson's narrow defeat for the U.S. Senate in 1941 and ends in
1948 when Johnson beat former Texas Gov. Coke Stevenson by 87 votes
in a Senate race long suspected of having been stolen.
   Caro said that ballot boxes were stuffed and votes altered.
   ``I really believe that no fair-minded person can ever doubt
again that the election was stolen,'' Caro insisted, ``and not with
87 votes or 200 votes, but with thousands of votes. It was not
simply something that everybody did, this went further.
   ``The amazing thing to me is that there was doubt for so many
years. When you start reading the court transcripts, witness after
witness testifies the same way.''
   Caro also said that Johnson portrayed himself as ``a war-scarred
veteran of many battles on many fronts,'' but actually saw combat
in the South Pacific only as an observer and ``for a total of 13
minutes.''
   He wrote of a man who frequently humiliated Lady Bird, had a
lengthy affair with a publisher's wife and campaigned despite
potentially life-threatening kidney stones that caused fever and
excruciating pain.
   Caro agreed with his critics that his subject comes across
unfavorably, but said he felt compassion for him, referring to
Johnson's painful experiences growing up when his family was in
poverty.
   ``I tell you there are times when you really do feel like
crying,'' Caro said.
   Caro said more positive qualities that Johnson displayed as a
senator and then as president will be depicted in upcoming volumes.
   ``A Johnson person might say, `What is this? Where is the rest
of Lyndon Johnson?' The third volume, when he's passing civil
rights legislation, takes hundreds of pages and you really see him
doing something noble.
   ``He had those elements in him, great gifts. An empathy for
really the disadvantaged in society and a matchless gift for
mobilizing the powers of government.''
