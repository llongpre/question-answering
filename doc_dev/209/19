   Angered by a new book picturing Lyndon B.
Johnson as a self-centered politician obsessed with power, admirers
of the 36th president are gathering here this week to celebrate his
``large and generous vision of America.''
   The occasion is a reunion recalling the 25th anniversary of
Johnson's inauguration as an elected president on Jan. 20, 1965.
   On Tuesday, a new 30-minute documentary film,``Lyndon Baines
Johnson: A Remembrance,'' was previewed at the Motion Picture
Association of America theater.
   Produced by Academy Award-winning documentary maker Charles
Guggenheim of Washington, the film presents an image of Johnson
hardly recognizable to readers of ``Means of Ascent,'' the second
volume of Robert Caro's LBJ biography.
   The book portrays Johnson in his youth as willing to do almost
anything to satisfy an all-consuming political ambition. Caro has
said a subsequent volume will show more positive qualities that
Johnson displayed as senator and president.
   The film, made up of black and white still photographs and the
voices of former Johnson associates, concentrates on Johnson's
labors on behalf of civil rights legislation and touches briefly on
the troubles that the war in Vietnam brought to his administration.
   It ends with journalist Bill Moyers, who was one of Johnson's
press secretaries, saying, ``He was many things: proud, sensitive,
impulsive, flamboyant, sentimental, earthy, mean at times, bold,
euphoric, insecure, magnanimous, but temperamental, melancholy, and
strangely ill at ease. He has such a large and generous vision of
America in his best moments as a prosperous, caring, just society.
This was a mind not given to rest, and neither, I think he would
say, should we.''
   On Friday, organizers say approximately 1,000 former White House
staffers, ambassadors, telephone operators and others from the
Johnson White House will gather for a social event to launch a
book, ``LBJ: The White House Years,'' by Harry J. Middleton,
director of the Johnson presidential library, with photographs by
the late White House photographer Yoichi Okamoto.
   ``I find it far more skillful and I think useful than Mr.
Caro's,'' said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture
Association of America and a former Johnson aide.
   Joseph Califano, a Johnson aide who later became secretary of
health, education and welfare in the Carter administration, asked
to comment on Caro's book, said of Johnson: ``Was he a tough
politician? Sure he was. Could he be a bare-knuckles fighter? Sure.
Were no holds barred? Absolutely. But what is totally missing from
Caro's book is any sense of what drove the man _ of the vision that
he had.''
   The observance is scheduled to wind up Saturday with panels of
journalists discussing ``In Search of LBJ'' under auspices of the
National Press Foundation and the LBJ Foundation, and former
Johnson administration officials discussing ``Social Welfare Issues
from the 1960s to the 1990s.''
   Many of the same group will gather May 5 in Texas for a two-day
seminar at the LBJ Ranch near Johnson City, Texas.
