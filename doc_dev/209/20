<HEAD>Historian: Johnson Didn't Steal Election; Others Did</HEAD>

   Lyndon Johnson didn't steal the
1948 Senate election, as a recent biography contends, but a
political boss might have rigged the election to get Johnson's
opponent, says a close Johnson associate.
   Joe B. Frantz, now a history professor, contends the election
was stolen for Johnson, possibly without his knowledge, by a
disgruntled south Texas political boss eager to derail the
opponent, Coke Stevenson.
   Johnson won the election by 87 votes out of almost a million
cast, collecting 99 percent of the south Texas vote.
   ``There's no question the election was stolen,'' Frantz said,
but he contends that political boss George Parr filched it to spite
Stevenson, not necessarily to help Johnson.
   Frantz said he revealed the information at a recent historical
society banquet because of accusations against Johnson by Robert A.
Caro in ``Means of Ascent,'' the second volume in Caro's biography
of Johnson.
   Frantz, a White House aide under Johson and former chairman of
the University of Texas history department, teaches at Corpus
Christi State University.
   Frantz put together the Oral History Project for the Johnson
Presidential Library in Austin, taping interviews with nearly 1,000
people, including Johnson's political enemies.
   He said his information about Parr's political vendetta against
Stevenson came from an interview he conducted with Stevenson when
the former governor was in his 80s. Stevenson died in 1975 at age
87.
   ``It would have been in the early 1970s,'' Frantz told The
Associated Press. ``He set me down and he said, `I'm going to give
you the straight story' ...''
   Stevenson and Parr had always been close allies, Stevenson told
Frantz, until Parr asked Stevenson, then governor, to name a
certain man judge at Laredo.
   Stevenson refused because ``the fellow was an absolute rascal
and into evey sort of political sin available,'' Frantz said.
   Parr promised revenge, the professor said.
   ``The feeling is that Parr decided, `I'm going to teach Coke
Stevenson a lesson and, at the same time, get in very good with the
new senator from Texas,''' Frantz said.
   Frantz was unable to locate Parr to interview him before Parr
died in the mid-1970s.
   Frantz said he interviewed the man responsible for disposing of
votes from a contested box before a recount could be held.
   He said he came away from the encounter convinced the south
Texans were guilty of stuffing the box, which disappeared after the
count, with illegal votes.
   ``They were a bunch of rascals,'' he said.
   Frantz said he thought Caro's characterization of Johnson in his
first volume, ``The Path to Power,'' was slanted against his
subject.
   He said that he felt that in the second book Caro expressed
annoyance ``as if Johnson had pulled off the dirtiest steal in
history. He doesn't see things in the context of the times.''
   ``We didn't know what a secret ballot was,'' Frantz said. ``I
grew up in Weatherford, and all the precincts used to vote in the
same room in the courthouse and all the courthouse hangers-on would
stand around and watch you.''
   It was not at all unusual for campaigners to know how a vote was
going before balloting ended, he said, and for people to round up
votes midway through the voting to counteract trends.
   ``I was sort of amused by Robert Caro's almost innocence in how
dirty all this was,'' said Frantz, former director of the Texas
State Historical Association. ``When the national press seized on
it, it's like he expected some sort of local paradox down here.
Actually it's no dirtier than anywhere else.''
