<TEXT>   IN 1964, I campaigned door-to-door for Lyndon Johnson as a 14-year-old Young
Democrat.;   At 18, I could barely say his name without swearing.;   At 22, I
stood in the freezing cold on the Capitol steps for the chance to pay my last
respects before his coffin.;   Before or since, I've never had such mixed
emotions about a president, and watching the two-part, four-hour "LBJ," which
begins tonight on PBS's "American Experience," brought them all back up again:
the hope, the hate, the hurt about what might have been.;   For Lyndon Johnson
was the last president many of us believed. He was also the first we learned
had lied to us.;   He was, as narrator David McCullough says here, like
something out of Shakespeare, a dozen characters in one who rose out of the
'60s like a colossus. His triumph was achieving more on the domestic front
than anyone but Franklin Roosevelt. His tragedy was the Vietnam War, which
overshadowed all he accomplished.;   Biographer Robert Caro, in his two
massive volumes, found in LBJ a black heart, and said he came to the Senate in
a stolen election.;   Black, white, in between; Robert Dallek, whose "Lone
Star Rising, Lyndon Johnson and his Times: 1908-1960" was published earlier
this year, found in him many more shades of gray.;   "LBJ" writer, producer,
director David Grubin, whose other work includes "Marshall, Texas" and
installments of Bill Moyers' "Creativity" and "A Walk Through the 20th
Century," sides with Dallek, who is interviewed throughout the series, while
Caro is nowhere to be found.;   Neither are several other folks such as
Moyers, the former Johnson press secretary who wants to do his own work on LBJ
someday; former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, who won't talk about the
Vietnam War; and former Sen. Barry Goldwater, loser to Johnson in the 1964
election, who remains outspoken about his foe's dishonesty.;   And nowhere is
there even a mention of Eugene McCarthy, whose seemingly hopeless challenge to
Johnson in 1968 helped bring an end to his presidency.;   The only time in
"LBJ" when we see McCarthy is in the background at a John Kennedy speech at
the 1960 convention in Los Angeles.;   Such an omission is quite glaring,
considering how thorough much of the rest of this evenhanded documentary is.
Grubin spent five years interviewing more than 200 people and poring through
4,000 miles of archival film to put together his absorbing finished product.; 
 Other voices; In addition to Dallek, we hear repeatedly from other Johnson
biographers such as Doris Kearns and Ronnie Dugger. John Connally and J.J.
Pickle are among the longtime Johnson political allies who spin wonderful
tales about their larger-than-life friend.;   Bobby Baker, who went to prison
for misuse of the power he got while working for Johnson in the Senate, heads
the long list of aides on camera, while other notables include Lady Bird
Johnson, Dean Rusk, George Ball, Sargent Shriver, Clark Clifford and Daniel
Ellsberg.;   Ellsberg, who would later leak the Pentagon Papers, went to work
in the Defense Department two days after the first incident in the Tonkin
Gulf, the trumped-up event that Johnson used to get a congressional mandate to
bomb, and later fight a full-scale war in, Vietnam.;   Despite that massive
deception -- and there is clear testimony here that Johnson knew he was lying
to Congress about the alleged attack -- Ellsberg surprisingly says that, at
one point in White House discussions about the war, he felt that Johnson "was
the only sane man at that level of government.";   That was early in the war,
however, before LBJ fell victim to the generals' siren song, ignoring those
who said escalation would only drag the country into a hopeless quagmire.;  
The reason he did that, Dugger says, is that he thought he "might just get
away with it.";   He didn't, and it meant the end of what he worked so hard to
build.;   The domestic successes; "LBJ," which is divided into four segments,
is at its best when it chronicles Johnson's whirlwind domestic accomplishments
and his inability to understand how rioting could occur after all he had done
for blacks.;   But they weren't the only ones he tried to help. He started
Medicare and the Job Corps, Head Start, the school-lunch program, public
television, highway beautification and the National Endowment for the Arts.;  
In short, he was not only, as Grubin describes him, "the last believer" in the
Vietnam War but perhaps the last believer in the power of government as well.;
  No matter what his other failings were -- and they are spelled out in detail
here -- Lyndon Johnson felt the United States could do better, that it could
be a great society, and he tried his best to make that happen. That alone
makes him different from the presidents who followed.;   "He was," Ronnie
Dugger concludes, "just interesting as hell. He was just fun to be around, and
you liked him. . . . I liked him when I was with him -- more than when I was
thinking about him.";   After four hours of "LBJ," you may not like him, but
you will think about him.  </TEXT>
