The writer Sir Peter Quennell died on Wednesday at the age of 88.
The news will be heard with sadness by all who value purity and elegance of
expression in literature. Quennell was one of those for whom an ugly
sentence could cause more pain than an aching tooth.
He was a regular contributor to the Financial Times' weekly books page over
many decades. An eminent biographer himself, he was a natural choice to
review the lives of those famous or obscure authors who inhabit the highways
and byways of 18th and 19th century literature. His own extended
pen-portraits of Byron, Boswell, Baudelaire, Hogarth, Ruskin and others may
still be read with enjoyment.
But Quennell's link with the FT was stronger than that of an occasional
contributor. He was for many years joint-editor of the journal History Today
when it was part of the FT's stable of periodical publications, and he
worked from an office within the FT in Bracken House.
Quennell and his colleague, Alan Hodge, his co-editor, used to make a
striking contrast when they appeared together in the lift, the former tall
and matinee-idol-like in appearance, the latter with the anxious countenance
and concentration of a scholar. They were firm friends, however, and through
Hodge, who had served Brendan Bracken and Churchill, kept alive the spirit
of an illustrious past.
The then chairman of the FT, Lord Drogheda, was in the habit of sending
queries down about recondite literary topics to 'Peter Q' (as he always
called him) and receiving an instant response.
Born in 1905, Quennell was the son of C H B Quennell, the architect, and
Marjorie Quennell, a book-illustrator. The pair published jointly a number
of reference books of which A History of Everyday Things is the best known.
They sent Quennell to Berkhamsted Grammar School where he was a contemporary
of Graham Greene but, far from scarring him for life, it seems to have
equipped him with most of the resources required, not merely for success in
literature, but also socially.
In his youth no fashionable gathering was complete without Quennell's
handsome witty presence. He crops up with alarming frequency in the smart
memoirs of the period.
Quennell showed distinct promise as a poet in his youth, but then found his
true metier in biography and literary journalism. He reviewed for a variety
of journals with a long spell as chief book critic of the Daily Mail and he
was editor of The Cornhill Magazine in the 1940s.
Quennell had five wives and two children, a daughter Sarah and a son
Alexander, both of whom survive him. He was knighted in 1992.
Quennell was a delightful companion with an unexpected gift for mimicry, and
he will be much missed by his many friends, both for his conviviality and
for his lightly worn erudition.
