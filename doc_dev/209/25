The 1930s - Berlin, Spain, socialism and homosexual love - defined him. The
1990s have enshrined him, a relic of his age, the surviving limb of the
poetic quadruped that Roy Campbell called MacSpaunday - MacNeice, Spender,
Auden and Day-Lewis.
What happened in between? Stephen Spender, 85-years-old on Monday and with a
rare volume of new poems to mark the event, says that somewhere around the
middle of his life he became domesticated.
'I think I got so much involved in things largely to do with earning money
and supporting my family,' he said. 'I can't look back on my last 40 years
as a kind of legendary, private, personal thing.'
Do you mean you've been too successful for a poet? Too suburban?
'Yes, very bourgeois. Too much so, I think. And I regret that, very much. I
wasn't when I was young, because I went to Spain during the civil war and
lived with a friend of mine, a working-class friend.' (He means the youth he
called Jimmy Younger in his 1951 autobiography).
'And I don't go to pubs. I often think my life would be much richer if
anyhow I'd gone to pubs all the time.'
Why do you say that?
'Because I think this a very limited existence and a limited view of
existence. One has to realise that self-interest is a very high priority:
one's standard of living becomes a very high priority, you see. But that is
all to do with family . . . Then friends have been very important.'
The young idealist who used to talk of 'going over to the proletariat' has
lived in a rented villa in fashionable St John's Wood, London, since 1945.
The house is painted blue, inside and out. There he lives with his second
wife (his first marriage was brief), Natasha Litvin, a Russian pianist. They
have a son who paints and a daughter who writes: she is married to the
female impersonator Barry Humphries, which makes Spender Dame Edna Everage's
father-in-law.
I asked him if the bourgeois life had been bad for his writing.
'My writing would probably be different. I don't think it's really bad for
my writing. I mean, I think in a way my poetry is all one long poem. And I
think - I hope - that it's moved outwards from being about myself,
discovering my own identity, partly into discovering other people's and
partly about the historic period we've lived in. That's extremely important,
isn't it?
'There's something very unreal about middle-class life today. You can sit
eating a lamb cutlet and you have television on and you see a child in Asia
somewhere starving to death in front of one's eyes, or people being
murdered.
'What do you do? Do you stop eating the lamb chop, do you turn off the
television?' He laughed, tickled by the dilemma. 'I think you somehow have
to go on . . . facing the lamb chop and thinking, well, this is my life.'
He has written about the dreadful events of his century, but thinks a writer
cannot enter in too far. 'I mean, the real experience today is the 10
seconds before someone is murdered, in the concentration camps or something
like that. The reality of our time is of consciousness participating in its
own extinction, being destroyed, you see, in some terrible way.'
Poets, he said, had always been aware of moments in which poetry disappeared
into 'a terrible reality beyond itself.' It was what King Lear was about,
and why Dr Johnson couldn't read it. 'Johnson wanted to stay this side where
there is literature. I'm very conscious of doing that.'
Spender shows signs of the classic complex of the too-comfortable,
silver-spoon socialist. But he has not been entirely passive. Not only did
he go to Spain, he instigated Index on Censorship in response to a plea from
the Russian dissident Pavel Litvinov.
You have a CBE, I said accusingly, and a knighthood.
'My son was very upset when I accepted. I said all my friends have been made
knights - Isaiah Berlin, Stuart Hampshire, though not Francis Bacon who
refused everything.
'What I'd really like is to be known to have refused a knighthood. I'd like
there to be an honours list with in the left-hand column the honours and the
right-hand column those who refused.' He giggled, and I saw the cheeky
Oxford undergraduate behind the old-ladyish face. 'It's just vanity,
absolute vanity.'
Are you going to tell me the best thing about a knighthood is being able to
get a table in a restaurant?
'That's exactly what was on my lips.' He laughed delightedly.
Spender seems gentle, naive and vulnerable. He is a lot tougher than he
looks. I mentioned his string of appointments, especially in the US, and
asked: Have you helped create your own worldly success?
'No I'm sure I haven't. No, I've never sought out anything. I really
haven't' But later, only half-jokingly, he said: 'There's a sort of danger
if you don't see your name in the newspaper you think you no longer exist.'
How do you react to being lionised?
'I suppose one does in a way. The answer is one quite likes to make an
entry, you see. On the other hand I am very glad that in England so little
is made of all that.'
Is it one of the recompenses of the writer's life that people come up to
you?
'I like that. I always wanted that. When I was a child I always longed to be
famous. Yes, I did really.'
He described a recent 'scraggy meeting of poets' adding: 'All the younger
poets received me very sort of politely, nicely and affectionately. I think
that's fun, in old age, if one gets a little affection and people are at all
grateful and respect you. You don't feel you've altogether deserved it, but
you think 'Thank God I've managed to escape universal contempt.' Don't you
think?'
As a poet, Spender has not been prolific - he has written essays, reviews,
journals, autobiography and fiction - and some critics say he has written
only a handful of great poems. His ambition from the age of 10 was to get
one piece into the Oxford Book of English Verse. He hopes he will be
included in 100 years' time - but for something other than his
much-anthologised 'The Truly Great.'
Have you ever thought about your obituary?
'No, I dread all that. People are beginning to write my obituaries now.' He
laughed uneasily. 'It's all about your sex life and things like that.
'It seems rather terrible that one can't write a poem without not only one's
own life being subject to biography but the lives of unfortunate people who
have been concerned with one suddenly dragged into the light.
'Biography can become a form of pornography in fact.'
Last week Spender won an injunction to suppress the British publication of
While England Sleeps, a novel by a homosexual American writer which
fictionalised the 'Jimmy Younger' episode in Spender's own life. And his
riposte to a recent, unauthorised biography was to lodge a 40-page catalogue
of 'mistakes' in the British Library.
I said: You've written yourself about your ambivalent sex life. Did you
marry and have children in order to get away from the homosexual ghetto and
the misery you thought you might have to endure?
'Well, perhaps,' he said cautiously. 'I think that every vocation requires
some kind of gift, doesn't it? What's rather marvellous today is that there
are homosexuals who are sort of gifted for being homosexuals.'
Auden, he said, was an example of a homosexual who had no gift for it: he
really wanted to be married and would have been a wonderful father.
'I am not really happy living with another man. I just find it a strain.'
Of course in the 1930s it was sort of fashionable?
'Yes it was. It was a sort of club. And if you forsook the club they were
very annoyed. They felt very let down, especially as it was a club of people
who were taking high risks . . . Well, not high risks like Mount Everest -
more Mount Skiddaw or something.' He laughed.
Is living in the 1990s interesting for you, or a struggle?
'I think it's still interesting. Anyhow to be a survivor is to mean that you
carry something with you which is of your generation. I feel I do carry
something with me which is of my generation and of my friends.'
This sense of being part of a continuum is described in Dolphins, the new
book of poems, where Spender reflects on Samuel Pepys' diaries, and writes:
No, when I read Pepys now, he and his cronies
Burn from their days and through my veins -
Their acts and passions one with those
Moving through mine]
Is writing, I asked him, an attempt to make sense of life or a prop for
life?
'No, it's a way of trying to make sense of life, and trying to do so as
clearly as possible. I've always tried to be as clear as I possibly could.
It's also a record of experience.'
Spender recently started keeping a diary again, not only in order to keep a
grip on names and events but to recapture, as he put it, 'the feel of things
and the sensation of people, the characters.'
Even at this stage of life?
'Yes, even at this stage of life. And also I do know rather interesting
people.'
So you explain life to yourself by writing about it?
'Yes, I do.'
And you give yourself a purpose for living as well?
'Well, my purpose for living would be just to do that, I think.'
It sounds circular, I said.
'I suppose. But why not?'
And it goes on until you drop off the perch?
'I hope so, yes. I think so. It becomes all one's life, so if one stopped
one would drop off the perch.'
Do you still suffer from youthful idealism?
'Yes, I think so, yes.'
But idealism is about the future. At 85 what kind of idealism can one have?
'At 85,' he said immediately, 'I think one should express no public opinions
because they may involve something such as you'd be prepared to die for -
and you're going to die for some other reason. You can't put your life on
the line any more, can you?
'I'm quite clear about that. I don't think I should express any opinions
about anything, publicly. Just try to go on writing my work, my thoughts, my
diaries.'
Aren't you supposed to be the village elder now? To sit in the sun with your
hands over the stick and provide a free consultation service for the
middle-aged who are trying to run the show?
'Yes, I know. That would be possible in the city state, like Athens, but I
don't think old people are in that position now, are they?'
What's the fun of being 85 if you can't hand down wise words?
There was a long pause. Spender was obviously working up a joke. Then he
began giggling: 'I think the fun of 85,' he said, spluttering with mirth,
'is that one won't have to live into the next century.'
