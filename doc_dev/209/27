   Here is a brief profile of Liberian leader Samuel K. Doe:

<TEXT>
   Samuel K. Doe was born on May 6, 1950, in Tuzon, Grand Gedeh
County.
   He attended R.E.B. Richardson Baptist Junior High School and the
Ministry of National Defense Radio and Communication School in
Monrovia.
   Doe joined the Liberian Army in 1969. As a master sergeant, he
led the bloody coup on April 12, 1980, that ended the rule of
President William Tolbert, who was killed.
   Doe's presidency has been characterized by numerous coup
attempts, murders and detentions of opposition leaders and
suppression of the country's press.
   He permitted elections in October 1985. When opposition parties
appeared to have won the voting, Doe's men burned and destroyed
ballots. The election commission Doe had appointed declared him the
winner.
   The election rigging triggered the worst violence yet under
Doe's rule. At least 1,500 people were estimated to have died,
including Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, who led a coup attempt.
   Quiwonkpa had been a popular commander from Nimba County and his
killing made his home area a fertile base for the Dec. 24, 1989,
invasion of Liberia by rebel leader Charles Taylor.
