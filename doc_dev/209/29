   In her account of Erich Leinsdorf's American years (Leisure &amp; Arts, Jan. 21), Manuela Hoelterhoff omits one important name, the man who saved the anti-Nazi conductor from deportation to his native -- and, at the time, Hitlerite -- Austria. 
This was none other than Lyndon Baines Johnson, then a young congressman and protege of Franklin D. Roosevelt. 

   Robert Caro (in "The Path to Power," the first volume of his remarkable Johnson biography) records the historic moment. 
The two young (Viennese musical and Texas political) prodigies met in Washington's Mayflower Hotel at the behest of mutual friend, Alice Glass. 
There, Lyndon Johnson set wheels in motion that were to keep Leinsdorf from the tender mercies of the "Anschluss" and the Thousand Year Reich. 

   So let's hear it for LBJ. 
A standing ovation. 
And "bravissimo." 
Or, as Maestro Leinsdorf might be the first to say, "Ich liebe" Lyndon."
