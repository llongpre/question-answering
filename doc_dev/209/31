In securing Graham Greene's approval to write this biography, Norman Sherry 
tells us, he promised the novelist that he would retrace his arduous journeys 
through the more rugged parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Risking disease and death as he had done," he writes, ". . . I made journeys 
to Mexico (where I contracted dysentery in exactly the same mountain village, 
living in the same boarding house as he had done), Haiti, Argentina, Paraguay 
and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"In Liberia, a week after I had left that most corrupt of countries, during a 
revolution led by Sgt. Doe (now general and head of state), the previous 
corrupt leader was murdered and his supporters shot or had their throats cut. I 
had only recently interviewed some of these men." 
</P>
<P>
There is something grandiloquent and faintly absurd about this. If Sherry had 
tackled De Maupassant would he have felt obliged to contract a venereal 
disease? Does talking to government officials who were subsequently murdered 
really constitute risk of death? 
</P>
<P>
Boastfulness does not disqualify a biographer; Leon Edel is not a shrinking 
violent; neither was the late Richard Ellmann. But presumably boastfulness 
would be earned by the writer's perceptiveness and literary gifts; not by his 
blisters. The sad truth about this massive biography -- only the first of two 
volumes -- is that its energy is mainly physical. No doubt, those were hard 
trips; they seem to have done more for Sherry's self-confidence than for his 
insight, which is crude, or his writing, which is ungainly. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry's book describes Greene's comfortable but uneasy childhood as one of the 
children of the headmaster of Berkhamstead School, and later as a student 
there. It takes us through a mysterious adolescent breakdown, a course of 
treatment with a London psychoanalyst, his days at Oxford, his courtship, 
conversion and marriage. 
</P>
<P>
It tells of his life as a struggling and frequently failing young writer; and 
of the early successes -- "Stamboul Train" and "This Gun for Hire" -- which, 
sold to Hollywood, allowed his family to live with a little more ease. It goes 
on to describe the writing of "Brighton Rock," a religiously tinged thriller 
and his first masterpiece; and of his expeditions to Africa and to Mexico. It 
ends with 1939 and "The Power and the Glory." 
</P>
<P>
Greene chose Sherry, the latter tells us, partly out of admiration for a book 
he had written about Joseph Conrad. At the same time, Greene wrote a friend 
that his biographer-to-be "has the great advantage of not knowing me." 
Considering that Greene was reluctant to have a biography done at all, and only 
gave in at the urgings of relatives, the phrase has an odd ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose it is far-fetched to suggest that the elusive writer, noted for 
privacy, chose Sherry because he sensed convenient qualities of obtuseness in 
him. But it is remarkable how little, despite 12 years work and thousands of 
miles traveling, Sherry has managed to get beyond what Greene has already 
chosen to put out about himself. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's grueling trek through Liberia, for example, in the company of a young 
cousin, is vividly related. But the telling seems mainly to be a paraphrase of 
Greene's own book on the subject. The footnotes for these chapters largely 
consist of citations of "Journey Without Maps" followed by chains of 20 or 25 
ibids. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the chapters dealing with the writer's trip to Mexico draw most of 
their substance from Greene's "The Lawless Roads" and his novel, "The Power and 
the Glory." The results of Sherry's travels are relatively meager, though 
discussed at length and ploddingly. Sherry finds the old man whose toothy look 
inspired Greene's physical description of the Judas figure in "Power and 
Glory." It is quite a jump, though, to assert that this makes him the model for 
the character. 
</P>
<P>
In his research, Sherry had access to Greene's diaries (with an occasional page 
torn out), to a great deal of unpublished correspondence, and to interviews 
with friends and relatives. He also had a number of talks with Greene himself. 
These are curiously unreflected in the book; hardly ever do we get a reference 
to something Greene told the author. "You are grilling me," Sherry quotes him 
as complaining; if so, the heat was on low. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most striking new material is Greene's letters to Vivien 
Dayrell-Browning before they were married. He met her while at Balliol and fell 
violently in love. She was cool for a long time, but began to soften after he 
converted to her Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
The temper of the letters makes it clear that whatever else went into Greene's 
conversion -- one that would shape his most important writing later on -- Eros 
was at least as important as Grace. His, you might say, was a baptism under 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear one, Darling heart, marvelous wonderful adorable one, Angel, Loveliest in 
the world, Sweetest heart, Dear only one for ever, sweet one, old thing, dear 
desire," goes one courting passage. Later, trying to overcome her resistance by 
proposing a celibate marriage, he writes: 
</P>
<P>
"And there'll be winter evenings, when we can make hot buttered toast for each 
other (do you like roast chestnuts? I do), &amp; there'll be summer days with 
the sea sparkling blue . . . &amp; days on the town, &amp; night expresses, and 
evenings sometimes, when we are both sleepy and tired &amp; we'll just read, or 
I'll write &amp; you'll put in a few touches to a design." 
</P>
<P>
It is not what we tend to think of as Greene's prose style. But after a few 
samples -- and long before Sherry exhausts what perhaps he regards as his 
richest trove -- the letters lose their relevance. After all, the meaning a 
love letter has for writer and recipient is not the meaning it has for a third 
party. In effect, we're reading a flawed translation. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental defect in this biography is not a matter of sources, nor a lack 
of assiduousness nor an overbalancing use of what Greene himself has written. 
It is in the mediocrity of the biographer's thought and style. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Greene as a baby: "His infancy went according to nature's and man's 
plan. For four months he was fed at his mother's breast." As a child: 
"Childhood and the innocent eye are temporary." Later on: "The world was not as 
he imagined." Crying at sad stories: "Perhaps this imaginative sympathy with 
the predicaments of others helped to make him a novelist." 
</P>
<P>
Describing a student prank -- Greene and a friend dress up as Gypsies and play 
a barrel organ on the street -- Sherry sees far-reaching implications. Greene 
was "challenging accepted principles, and experiencing life outside the bounds 
of society's protection, which involved hardship and danger (on a minor scale 
as yet), secrecy and disguise." 
</P>
<P>
As for the topographical accuracy of Brighton Rock, Sherry tells us that "what 
Hale observed in the Grand Hotel so must Greene have observed: They were 
drinking cocktails on the terrace." 
</P>
<P>
He also writes that Greene "was antipathetic to Mexico" (he didn't like the 
place); and that ". . . there are times when he smiles, with his transparent 
blue eyes giving an impression of blindness, when he unquestioningly looks 
beatific." Unquestionably. 
</P>
<P>
Only those who admire Greene's writing are likely to want to read a biography 
that may fill 1,500 pages when it is finished. And few who admire Greene's 
writing are likely to put up with Sherry's.
