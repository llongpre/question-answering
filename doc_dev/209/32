HOGARTH: ART AND POLITICS, 1750-1764 by Ronald Paulson Lutterworth Press
Pounds 35, 568 pages
RONALD Paulson's biography of Hogarth appeared originally in two volumes in
1971. In the intervening 22 years much further research on Hogarth and his
period has been accomplished. Not least by Paulson himself, who is Professor
of Humanities at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Constantly widening
his already encyclopaedic knowledge of this artist, Paulson arrived some
time ago at a point where he has was moved to cover the whole ground again.
He was especially enlightened by spending a week at the Tate scrutinising
the Hogarths in the exhibition of 1971 before it opened.
In 1991 Paulson published the first volume of a greatly revised biography,
Hogarth: The Modern Moral Subject, 1697-1732 (Lutterworth Press Pounds 35)
and in 1992 the second, Hogarth: High Art and Low, 1732-1750 (Lutterworth
Press Pounds 35). With the appearance of this final volume, Paulson sets the
seal on a major work of scholarship that includes both interpretation of all
the works and biographical narrative.
Hogarth's paintings and engravings were executed over a time-span that
begins in the period of Addison's Spectator, which he regarded as a kind of
Bible, and continues through the high Augustan era of Pope and Swift into
the world of Dr Johnson, Garrick, Goldsmith. Although not as phenomenally
successful as his younger rival Reynolds, Hogarth represents a much more
significant response to the political and cultural development of the
period. Queen Anne died when he was three; George III was on the throne when
Hogarth himself died, aged 67, in 1764.
There are many points at which his work touches on contemporary literature.
Fielding was a friend and colleague; both as a novelist and as a magistrate
he shared Hogarth's concern about public order and his dread of anarchy.
Smollett was an enemy who satirised Hogarth as Mr Pallett in Peregrine
Pickle. Sterne's way of writing fiction was positively Hogarthian. Defoe and
Richardson both come into the Hogarth story. John Cleland's Fanny Hill
derives from Hogarth. Paulson raises his eyebrows at the absence of any
tribute to Hogarth in Ian Watt's standard The Rise of the Novel and similar
studies.
Hogarth was likewise deeply into poetry. One of Hogarth's earliest works was
a set of illustrations for the verse satire that preceded those of Pope -
Samuel Butler's Hudibras. Hogarth's genius for ridicule was already
riotously in evidence here. Busy crowded woodcuts foreshadow his main
painterly innovation - a pictorial work in consecutive parts, delineating
the progress of an anti-hero, or an anti-heroine, containing coded
references to historical and contemporary people. The tradition of the
'political cartoon' later developed by Rowlandson and Gillray stems from
Hogarth.
The Hudibras illustrations were followed by The Harlot's Progress - a close
kinship here with The Beggar's Opera, which Paulson sees as the transitional
work of the whole period and which Hogarth also illustrated. Then came The
Rake's Progress - a set of paintings aimed at a single purchaser,
accompanied by a parallel edition of prints for popular consumption that
were sold to the public by Hogarth from his workshop on subscription. This
doubling of painting and print was his usual practice: the prints were not
mere copies but often differed in points of detail from their originals.
In London, where Hogarth lived for his entire life, we are fortunate that
much of his best work is easily accessible, not only in galleries like the
Tate but also in those institutions with which Hogarth was associated:
Captain Thomas Coram's hospital for Foundlings of which Hogarth was a
governor - he designed the children's uniform - and St. Bartholomew's
hospital. Above all, there are the 12 fine Hogarths purchased by that great
18th century collector, Sir John Soane, architect to the Bank of England.
They are on view in the Sir John Soane's Museum, 12 Lincoln's Inn Fields.
They consist of the eight original paintings of The Rake's Progress series
and four large canvases done in the last decade of Hogarth's life when he
was exercised by the corruption evident in party politics - An Election.
Paulson deals with this sequence in fascinating depth, showing the contempt
that Hogarth had both for the candidates and the mob.
It was not only party politics that preoccupied Hogarth at this time but
also the politics of art. As a youth he served his apprenticeship as a
silver-plate engraver; he left his master before completing his seven-year
indenture; then he became an assistant to Sir James Thornhill with whose
daughter Jane he eloped. Setting up on his own as an artist-dealer in 1720,
he was much concerned about the protection of engravers' copyrights in their
own prints against pirates and succeeded in getting legislation through
Parliament in favour of the artists. He was active as an instructor at the
re-formed St Martin's Lane Academy and he joined the newly founded Society
of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce (now the RSA) where the first annual
exhibitions of paintings in London were held.
Led by Reynolds, many leading artists left the Society and lobbied for an
English Academy on the lines of those in France and Italy. When this
resulted in the formation of the Royal Academy in 1768, Hogarth parted
company from them. He opposed the emphasis the Academy put on the copying of
canonical Renaissance models (prescribed by Reynolds in his annual
Discourses to the students). By contrast Hogarth believed that they way
forward for art in England was by direct, honest, often scurrilously
subversive observation.
Much of Paulson's final volume is taken up with Hogarth's theory of art.
Hogarth expounded it himself in The Analysis of Beauty in 1750 both in a
text and in two engravings. His gesture against the formal symmetry of the
continental ideal was to point to the wavy line, the sinuous shape made by
the letter S, as the basis of the Beautiful. His first print shows a
painter's yard full of statues in S-shaped poses and surrounded on its
border by stays, furniture and other examples of the S-bend. The second
print shows the S-shape as formed in their movements by a group of dancers
at a ball who are doing a minuet. The shape is wayward and variable -
elements of variety and surprise were crucial to his theory of art. Looking
at a painting also implied search. The spectator is encouraged to observe
the picture closely and decode it.
Here Paulson is invaluable. His glosses on the proliferation of emblems and
allusions in Hogarth's work amount to a social history of the period. In his
concluding chapter Paulson deals with Hogarth's last drawing, Tail Piece or
The Bathos made in 1764. At this time Hogarth was under attack from the poet
Churchill and in contention with both Burke and Wilkes. He inscribed on it
in capitals the word FINIS, a sentiment that will now be echoed by his
biographer, with a justifiable sense of triumph.
