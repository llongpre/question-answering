   After losing a court battle for the right to
publish an unauthorized biography of J.D. Salinger, Random House
says it will publish ``a substantially new book'' about the
reclusive author and the legal wrangling over the first book.
   The new book, ``In Search of J.D. Salinger'' by Ian Hamilton, is
slated to arrive in bookstores in May. It will be both a biography
of Salinger, author of the 1951 novel ``The Catcher In the Rye,''
and tell the story of Hamilton's unsuccessful effort in 1986 to
publish ``J.D. Salinger: A Writing Life.''
   Salinger, who rarely leaves his Cornish, N.H., home and has
given only one interview in 35 years, came to New York to give a
deposition in the lawsuit against the first book. He claimed
invasion of privacy and infringement of copyright because the
planned biography reproduced some letters he wrote to his friends
and editors between 1939 and 1961.
   The letters had been donated to libraries and were open to
scholarly perusal.
   Last October, after months of appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court
let stand a lower court ruling barring publication of the biography
unless the quotations from and paraphrases of Salinger's letters
were deleted. The court said the letters still belonged to Salinger.
   Jason Epstein, the editor of the book, said, ``The original book
essentially survives within the new book.''
   Gerald Hollingsworth, Random House's general counsel, said, ``I
can't conceive of there being any well-founded legal problems with
this book.''
   Dorothy Olding, Salinger's longtime literary agent, said she had
expected Random House to go ahead with another book and she planned
to inform Salinger's attorney. She said she was certain Salinger
would have no comment.
   In a statement issued by Random House, Hamilton said: ``The new
version is a different sort of book altogether _ more of a literary
adventure story with the biographer as a leading character. ... At
the same time it raises key questions about the whole business of
`biography' _ what is it for, why do we write it, why do people
want to read it and so on.''
