   Oscar-winning film director Oliver Stone
has apologized for wrongly depicting Syracuse police clubbing
college protesters in his movie ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   Stone apologized in a letter that was sent to the Syracuse
Police Benevolent Association and addressed to all city residents.
The film won two Oscars at the Academy Awards on Monday night,
including one for Stone for best director.
   ``I took creative license to make my point, and sometimes
sacrificed smaller truths for larger ones,'' Stone wrote. ``There
is, I would like to point out, a disclaimer at the end of the film
to this effect.''
   The movie, starring Tom Cruise, is based on the life story of
Ron Kovic, and his passage from patriotic soldier to anti-war
activist.
   Based on a book by Kovic, the movie depicts city police officers
beating students during a campus protest at Syracuse University in
1970. City police officials denied that officers used violence to
stop college protests.

   Singer Gloria Estefan was up and walking around
Tuesday, one week after fracturing two vertebrae when her tour bus
was hit by a truck, hospital officials said.
   ``She's doing really well,'' said Evelyn Torres, spokeswoman for
the Orthopedic Hospital for Joint Diseases. ``Her spirits are up,
and there's no paralysis at all.''
   The 32-year-old singer will remain in the hospital about five
more days, Torres said.
   Walking without crutches or a cane, Estefan gave fellow patients
dozens of presents she had received from fans.
   The star of the Latin-pop band Miami Sound Machine underwent
successful surgery Thursday to have her spine stabilized with metal
rods.

   Told that Robert Caro was in town, a
longtime associate of Lyndon B. Johnson cracked: ``Who let him in?''
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning author says he expects to come in for
criticism in Texas for his dark portrayal of Johnson in the second
volume of his biography of the late president. But he thinks
critics are missing the point.
   ``I wanted to show the transformation,'' Caro was quoted as
saying in an interview published Tuesday in the Austin
American-Statesman.
   ``I don't write biographies just to show the lives of famous
men. I wanted to show what happened with American politics'' at the
dawn of a new age of media politics, he added. The turning point
was the 1948 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate between Johnson
and former Gov. Coke Stevenson.
   ``Nobody had ever run a campaign like that before,'' said Caro,
who in his book ``Means of Ascent'' portrayed Johnson as evil and
Stevenson as a romantic, heroic figure.
   Caro, 53, said the same vigorous reaction greeted his first
volume, ``Path to Power.''
   ``The initial reaction is controversy. After a while, all that's
left is the book. The book endures,'' Caro said.
   Rep. Jake Pickle, D-Texas, who was an aide and heir to Johnson's
congressional seat, said Caro ``made Coke a saint. We respected
Coke as a solid sort of conservative, but we didn't think of him as
a man of vision _ the saint of all Texans, he was just `Calculatin'
Coke.'''

   Raunchy rock 'n' roll comedian Sam Kinison
says he quit drinking because he is getting too old to keep
ignoring his health.
   ``Yeah, I've cleaned up my act a little bit,'' Kinison told The
Cincinnati Enquirer in an interview published Tuesday. ``Turning
36, partying too much and grabbing my heart made me think, it's
time to be good.
   ``I wanted to hold out at least until the turn of the century.''
   But tempering his alcohol intake isn't part of a mellowing trend
for the heavyset comic known for his manic, screeching style and
often explicit commentary.
   He plans to belt out his remake version of ``Wild Thing'' with
the band L.A. Guns here Thursday night.

   Thomas DeBarge, a member of the
DeBarge family band that scored hits with ``Who's Holding Donna
Now?'' and ``Rhythm of the Night,'' was sentenced to 2{ to 20 years
in prison on a drugs' charge.
   While acknowledging DeBarge's talents, Kent County Circuit Judge
Donald Johnston suggested Monday that ``perhaps success came too
quickly'' for the 32-year-old Grand Rapids native.
   DeBarge pleaded guilty in February to possession with intent to
deliver cocaine after being arrested by an undercover officer. He
asked that his sentence be delayed until he completes a
drug-treatment program, but the judge refused because it was
DeBarge's second cocaine-related conviction in four years.

   Some movie stars stayed clear of Hollywood
on Academy Awards night.
   Christopher Reeve, Susan Sarandon, Ron Silver, Jennifer Beales
and Alec Baldwin, all members of The Creative Coalition, met with
Gov. Mario Cuomo and state legislators Monday to promote
environmental bills.
   ``I think sometimes there's a skeptical attitude about
celebrities, that we just do quick hits,'' Reeve said. ``We are a
serious group.''
   The politically active artists' group have pledged to exploit
its celebrity status to promote legislation in New York state that
aims to protect the environment.
   ``State government has become more powerful as the federal
government has withdrawn from matters of concern to the people of
the state and the nation,'' said Silver, the organization's
president.
   The group supports Cuomo's proposed $1.9 billion environmental
bond act, and will identify lawmakers who try to block
pro-environment bills, Silver said.
   Environmental lobbyist Lee Wasserman said the celebrities could
prove a big boost.
   ``The reasons things don't get done on the environmental front
is the public isn't fully aware of how the process works,''
Wasserman said.
