<TEXT>  Princeton University Press, 783 pp., $29.95; WHO  was ever so unabashedly
American as to count among the most romantic sensations of mankind the first
American moon landing and among his most memorable pleasures "a triangular
gulp of canned beer"?;   Who's that distinguished man who befriended an FBI
agent at Cornell, lauded President Johnson for his "admirable" Vietnam policy,
and dubbed Sigmund Freud the "Viennese Quack"?;    Who ranked Pound a
second-rate poet and Dostoevski a third-rate writer?;   The man "as American
as April in Arizona" -- where he chased butterflies and wrote large parts of
"Lolita" -- is Vladimir Nabokov. And 14 years after his death at 77 he has
become almost a legendary figure.;   No doubt, a Nabokov renaissance is in
full swing. There's a new complete edition in Germany. He's being reclaimed in
Moscow and St. Petersburg as the prodigal son of Russian literature. Vintage
International has brought out his major works in a series of smooth, handsome
paperbacks, including a detective reader's delight, the "Annotated Lolita.";  
In 1989, Nabokov's son Dmitri edited "Selected Letters 1940-1977." A year
later, Brian Boyd published to unanimous acclaim the first volume of his
biography, subtitled "Russian Years." This new volume, "American Years," keeps
all the promises its predecessor ever made.;   No symbols, no Great Ideas;  
Boyd succeeds gloriously in blending the fascinating biographical story of a
remarkable man and a detailed, but imaginative, interpretation of the works
Nabokov wrote during his American years. At the same time, he avoids hunting
down "symbols" and "deeper" meaning and "great ideas," or proclaiming a
"moral" in Nabokov's plays and novels. For Nabokov there is a moral in
science, in scholarship, and in dealing with the Bolsheviks, whom he loathed
from beginning to end. But the distinction between "good" and "bad" in art
isn't a matter of eternal ideas, but a matter of talent, style, a sharp pencil
and an incredibly high intensity of work. There's passion in science, Nabokov
has often said, but there must be absolute precision in poetry.;   At the
center of Boyd's book stands, naturally, "Lolita." First published in 1955 by
the "pornographer" Maurice Girodias and his Olympia Press in Paris, it took
another three years of haggling and cajoling and luck to find a U.S. publisher
with enough muscle to defend it in court, if necessary. While "Lolita" was
making big waves in Europe, Walter Minton of Putnam's heard from a former
showgirl in Paris about the novel. On Aug. 18, 1958, "Lolita" hit the book
market in New York like a hurricane.;   The reviews were magnificent, and
detractors were just sufficiently outraged to add fuel to the fire. Very
importantly, the courts had been skillfully quieted in advance through a
careful campaign by scholars and critics who were beyond reproach. Early on,
Graham Green had selected "Lolita" as one of the three best books of 1955.
Dorothy Parker raved: "A fine book, a distinguished book -- all right, then --
a great book." Others were equally enthusiastic with their praise: William
Styron, Harry Levin, Lionel Trilling. "Lolita" was compared to James Joyce's
"Ulysses," one of the few classics even Nabokov admired. On Sept. 13 the New
York Times announced that "Lolita" had become the first book since "Gone with
the Wind" to sell 100,000 copies in its first three weeks.;   (Stanley
Kubrick's movie followed in 1962, with the late James Mason as Humbert Humbert
and Sue Lyon as Lolita. At present, director Adrian Lyne is planning a "more
sensual" "Lolita" with Dustin Hoffman. This new screenplay by James Dearden is
supposedly closer to the novel and perhaps also to Nabokov's own screenplay
that he wrote in Hollywood as a guest of Kubrick's. I, for one, am not holding
my breath to see how Mrs. Robinson's boy turns lecherous eyes on a Lolita who
watches Madonna videos and imitates Paula Abdul's cheerleading.);   Set free
by 'Lolita';   For Nabokov, "Lolita" meant, finally, financial independence.
He quit his job at Cornell, and brought to a close a distinguished academic
career that had moved him through Stanford, Wellesley, Harvard and Cornell,
from "lean lecturer to full professor." At last he was free to pursue the most
"intense pleasures known to man": writing and hunting butterflies.;   But
there's much more to Boyd's biography, and to Nabokov the professor and
author, than the sensations and success surrounding "Lolita." Nabokov himself
believed that he would be remembered by "Lolita" and his painstakingly literal
translation of Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin." This translation led to one of the
most ferocious, relentlessly public trans-Atlantic literary battles ever: his
feud with Edmund Wilson over prosody, exactness and fidelity to the original
text. A long friendship was sacrificed for literary and artistic principles.; 
 American readers may find the deceptively funny and deeply moving "Pnin" the
easiest book to enjoy. But beware: Toward the end of the book Nabokov himself
makes a surprise appearance -- well, not to spoil the innocent fun, but to
show that there is no innocence.;   Or "Pale Fire," a poem in 999 verses, with
a commentary which "is the book." There is, first, the literary genius, the
poet Shade, whose poem is edited with an amazing, and fake, learnedness by the
commentator Professor Kinbote. There are the playful games of word golf and
polyglot puns. But there's also the darker side of a deeper consciousness, and
a murder, and one of the saddest and simplest and most poetic lines in
American fiction, when Shade's daughter drowns in the lake at Lochan Neck.;  
Nabokov's last great success, "Ada," made the cover of Time magazine in 1969.
By that time, he was long settled in a comfortable hotel in Montreux,
Switzerland. Here the postal service functioned; there were no strikes and
demonstrations. Here he held court, wrote and gave interviews -- questions
submitted and answered in writing only, please -- because he hated the ad hoc
chat, the peeping questions into his personal life, and because he loathed
seeing his ramblings in print. He saw himself, as humble as ever, in these
terms: "I think like a genius, write like a distinguished author, and speak
like a child.";   Boyd's biography sets out to present all three, the
cosmopolitan genius of letters, the famous author of Russian and American
books, and the amazing path of a child born to stupendous wealth, growing up
in exile. The child became a man of letters, who protected his Russian
language like a threatened treasure, and a family man, who with wife Vera and
son Dmitri barely escaped Hitler in France. At 41, he began inventing and
living yet another full life when he came to America in 1940, his home for 19
years.;   Perhaps it is a pity that Nabokov kept so much to the Russian
emigrants when he lived in Europe. It prevented him from knowing other writers
who might have lived up even to his exacting standards; for example Robert
Musil, who also retreated to Switzerland. He read some Thomas Mann, whom he
quickly dismissed as artificial, along with Stendhal, Auden, Balzac. Or
perhaps it's for the better that he avoided the potholes of Western European
literatures. It may have helped him steer a clear route from the melancholic
rustle of Russian through the elegance of French into the rich simplicity of
English. For in which other language do you have the ability to describe, as
Nabokov did in the autobiographical "Speak, Memory," a baby's burp as a
"post-lactic all-clear signal" and still sound amusing? (box)  </TEXT>
