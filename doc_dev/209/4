   The people who worked for Lyndon Johnson in
this town are buzzing _ and often furious _ about a new biography
of their old boss that says he stole his election to the Senate in
1948.
   ``Why, why, why would a man want to spend this much of his life
writing about a fellow that he can't stand and whose reputation he
is so passionately bent on destroying?'' demands an injured Jack
Valenti, an aide in Johnson's White House.
   ``I think it is a dishonest biography,'' says Bob Hardesty, who
used to write Johnson's speeches and helped him write his memoirs.
``I don't think it pretends to be fair. I think it is the work of a
man with a burning, unnatural hatred for his subject. It only
presents a dark, evil, negative side of Lyndon Johnson.''
   The book, ``Means of Ascent,'' by Robert Caro pictures a
youthful Johnson who is willing to do almost anything to appease an
all-consuming political appetite.
   It is the second of Caro's projected four-volume LBJ biography.
Caro already has devoted 14 years to the task. The first volume met
with equal hostility from some Johnson fans. One book critic said
it demonstrated ``enraged animus against Lyndon Johnson.''
   The new volume is just out, but excerpts ran in the New Yorker
magazine and they were the talk of Washington's Texas community.
   Ex-Texas newspaperman Bob Mann, now teaching at Emory &amp; Henry
College in southwestern Virginia, says this week's mail brought
three sets of Xeroxed copies of the excerpts from friends who were
afraid he might miss them.
   Caro, in the book's introduction, acknowledges that he paints a
portrait of a despicable person.
   While ``bright and dark'' threads run through most of Johnson's
life, Caro writes, no bright thread is visible in a period when
Johnson ``was all but totally consumed by his need for power and by
his efforts to obtain it.''
   The book covers the years from Johnson's 1941 defeat for a
Senate seat in a rigged election to his 1948 victory _ by 87 votes
_ in a 1948 Democratic runoff over an enormously popular former
governor, Coke Stevenson.
   The theft by Johnson of that primary election has been fixed in
Texas lore for years, but Caro provides new evidence.
   The book also says Johnson pulled strings in Washington to
enhance the power and value of a Texas radio station that made him
a millionaire.
   And it says Johnson made shamelessly political capital from his
war career _ which amounted to flying under enemy fire for only a
few minutes, then accepting a Silver Star from Gen. Douglas
MacArthur.
   ``He didn't seize the Silver Star,'' says Horace Busby, a
Johnson associate for 20 years. ``MacArthur, who was a political
general, gave it to him to curry favor with Franklin Roosevelt, who
liked Johnson. What was Johnson to do _ throw it back?''
   As for LBJ's stolen election, Busby says: ``Johnson went before
a statewide electorate seven times after that and it was never a
factor.''
   Caro's critics say his legwork is meticulous and his writing
thrilling, but his viewpoint warped. They say he finds little good
_ or balanced _ to say about Johnson and nothing bad in Stevenson's
record, despite his touch of racism.
   History buff Jeff Patterson, an aide to Rep. Mike Andrews,
D-Texas, says Stevenson comes across as ``Saint Coke.''
   ``Caro sets out to make Johnson look like a real jerk,'' says
Patterson. ``Give me warts-and-all, but don't try to overdo it.''
   Political reporter David Broder, reviewing the book in The
Washington Post, said Caro's Johnson is ``a complete scoundrel''
and ``a lying, cunning, utterly unprincipled operator.''
   Caro did not respond to messages asking for a reply. ``We don't
want to respond to a single review,'' said Paul Bogaards, publicist
for Alfred A. Knopf, which has printed 250,000 copies of the book.
   Former Johnson aide Lloyd Hackler says Caro ``puts more emphasis
on the negatives _ and God knows Johnson had those _ than on the
positives,'' but adds: ``Its probably the best job of research that
anybody has ever done on Johnson.''
   Valenti calls Caro's work ``this loathsome book'' _ but admits
he read every word of the serialization and now will proceed to
read the book whole.
   Valenti mourns the impact the book is likely to have on
Johnson's place in history.
   ``Caro writes engagingly and that torments me,'' he says. ``This
may become the definitive Johnson biography.''
   But Hardesty says he has no such worries: ``Over a period of
time, when the historians have their say, he'll come out a
full-bodied figure, flawed but an attractive man who had a great
impact on the country.''
