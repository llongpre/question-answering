NO ABIDING CITY: EVELYN WAUGH 1939-1966 by Martin Stannard JM Dent Pounds
25, 523 pages
GRAHAM Greene, in a much-quoted phrase, said that his friend Evelyn Waugh
was 'the greatest novelist of my generation'. Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford
in another well-known quotation: 'You have no idea how much nastier I would
be if I was not a Catholic . . . ' There is the challenge to the biographer:
to show how the literary genius co-existed with the cruel, tormented,
snobbish, offensive, reactionary old buffer.
The second volume of Martin Stannard's biography opens in 1939 with the
fashionable author of black comedies joining the Royal Marines as an
over-age trainee officer - or rather, as he saw it, as a Catholic crusader
in the defence of Christendom.
The love affair with the army was short, and painful on both sides. Waugh
came to feel that he was unwanted (which was true) and that the cause had
been dishonoured; his five days in Crete gave him a conclusive sense of
national disgrace. He began to turn his life into a fiction - 'sensitive,
Catholic, bundled out of a Protestant war because he would not compromise
his honour . . . ' writes Stannard. 'Everyone else had to be wrong . . . '
Here was the impetus for the post-war writings, and also for his short,
unhappy life; he retreated into a dream, a fixation with a romantic and
unreal past.
An important part of that fiction was his infatuation with the aristocracy.
He never truly belonged to it, he was reacting against his Golders Green
birth and his middle-class father. As his son Auberon has written: 'Although
the Waughs were an eminently respectable family . . . the gulf between them
and the carefree traditions of the aristocracy was as great as if he had
been a fishmonger's assistant'. That may be a bit strong but the idea can
stand: there must have been hypocrisy as well as eccentricity in Waugh's
life, which would have heightened self-parody and unreality and, in his
literary art, 'the confusion of social grace with moral worth' (in one of
Stannard's sharper phrases).
Stannard lingers over the detail of Waugh's increasingly isolated and
misanthropic years as country gent. His days were taken up with family,
church, library, increasingly distant friends, and drunken jaunts to London.
He was an old man long before his time.
His (second) marriage, one suspects, will remain mysterious: he must have
been an impossible man. His deficiencies as a father have been aired again
in his son's recent autobiography. The father said of his children: 'I can
only see them as defective adults, feckless, destructive, frivolous,
sensual, humourless . . . ' Was that a joke? Presumably not - the sentence
comes from his diaries. Was it self-parody?
The fundamental concern of his life was his Catholicism, and Stannard
rightly emphasises his obsession with the preservation and propagation of
the Faith, He awaited death for years. He was afraid of madness, and in The
Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold in 1957 he left a remarkable report on his own
breakdown. Stannard gives the episode a central place in his tale. Were
Waugh's 'voices' the result of an overuse of narcotics, as he afterwards
claimed, or, as Stannard suggests, did the drugs release 'a barrage of
self-hatred . . . his private catalogue of self-reproach'? If he was mad,
perhaps he should have bitten a few more of our novelists . . .
Stannard's biography is careful, readable, and appears exhaustive until one
realises its great weakness, which is that it too rarely illuminates the
most important area of Waugh's life - there is almost no sense of Waugh at
work as writer. There is a welter of detail about the minutiae of the years,
his wartime postings, his feuds with Cyril Connolly, and so on and so forth.
But what happened when this dyspeptic and lonely man closed his library
door, settled at his desk, and picked up his fountain pen? We are not told.
It turns out to be a curiously un-literary biography.
