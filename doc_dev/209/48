VIRGINIA WOOLF by James King Hamish Hamilton Pounds 25, 699 pages
It may not seem like it to those readers suffering from Bloomsbury bulimia,
but as James King, professor of English at McMaster University, Ontario, is
at pains to point out, this is the first full-scale biography of Virginia
Woolf since the one by Quentin Bell in 1972.
The years that followed Bell's sparely written life of his aunt saw the
publication of the five volumes of her diaries and the six volumes of her
letters. Then Andrew McNeillie began to edit a complete edition of the
essays of Virginia Woolf (including all her scattered book-reviews, many of
which were originally anonymous). With the appearance recently of Volume 4
(The Hogarth Press, Pounds 35.00) this edition has reached the year 1928.
Two more volumes will take it up to Woolf's death in 1941.
Thus the millions of words she wrote both privately and professionally
during her tragically curtailed lifetime are now all in the public domain.
Even the laconic diary she kept at Asheham in Sussex in 1917-18 before the
move to Rodmell, hitherto only partially printed in Volume 1 of the diaries,
is now available in full in the current number of The Charleston Magazine
(Issue 9, available from Charleston Farmhouse, Firle, Lewes, BN8 6LL at
Pounds 2.95).
Faced by such a mass of primary material - not to mention all the secondary
and related sources that have mushroomed - an overview of the writer, the
self-destructive drives that accompanied her endless literary creativity,
her ironical exposure of the injustices perpetrated upon women, is surely
much to be welcomed. King has avoided over-kill and organised his book
judiciously. He uncovers the autobiographical elements in the works while
integrating his subject's development as an artist with the many intense
relations she had with other people.
These relations form a set of concentric circles - first the family ones
including female cousins like Madge Vaughan and older women like Violet
Dickinson, to whom as a girl Virginia was very close. Then the men, her
brother Thoby's Cambridge contemporaries who became Bloomsbury, including
Lytton Strachey and Leonard Woolf. Finally, a wider circle of writers and
artists like Katherine Mansfield, Vita Sackville-West, TS Eliot, Hugh
Walpole who were not part of Bloomsbury but whom she came to know intimately
as her fame spread.
King is a sensitive scholar who leads us patiently through a richly varied
life with fresh insights to offer about episodes familiar from earlier
accounts. The least judgmental of biographers, he cannot avoid presenting
Virginia's half-brothers, George and Gerald Duckworth, as the villains of
this Cinderella-like story. We have her word - in papers she wrote and read
to the Memoir Club, a small private society within Bloomsbury - that she was
abused sexually by both of them: by Gerald when she was six who fondled her
and by George, who tried to rape her in her bedroom after a dance.
The precise extent of the abuse remains obscure. One should remember that
Woolf was capable of fantasising - as in one spectacular instance after
Thoby's death; she pretended to Violet that he was still alive sending her
details of the improvement in his condition. But even without the activities
of the half-brothers Duckworth (Gerald was to become the publisher of her
first novel) she suffered a series of bereavements when she was growing up
that were in themselves more than enough to de-stabilise her finely poised
mind.
Her mother Julia's death in 1895 at the age of 49 was followed two years
later by that of her half-sister Stella, who had assumed the maternal role
in the family. Virginia was 15. Her tyrannical but lovable father Leslie
Stephen died in 1904 when she was 22; her brother Thoby died aged 26 in
1906; and her nephew Julian Bell was killed in the Spanish Civil War.
Her recovery from her breakdowns, to the point where she could write her
novels and reviews and even re-create the process of losing control of
reality in the character of Septimus Warren Smith, was a minor miracle.
Though innately anti-Semitic she found her personal salvation through
marrying Leonard Woolf, a Jew, who gave up a very un-Jewish kind of career
in the Ceylon Civil Service where he was rising meteorically up the
administrative ladder. He became instead a writer and a devoted husband. Her
lesbian tendency was already apparent and marriage did not eliminate it.
Marital sex was another of Leonard's sacrifices.
The marriage survived an endless series of upheavals, including Virginia's
intense sense of rivalry with other women authors, notably Katherine
Mansfield, and with her sister Vanessa with whose husband, Clive Bell, she
flirted outrageously, precipitating Vanessa's lifelong passion for the
homosexual painter Duncan Grant.
When Viriginia was 43 she entered upon her passionate friendship with Vita.
This did not become a long, full-blooded affair, like those Vita had with
Hilda Matheson and Gwen St Aubyn. According to King they only slept together
twice but afterwards remained firm friends. Orlando was as much a requiem as
a celebration.
The composer Ethel Smyth, another attachment, sends a breath of irreverent
fresh air through this hothouse informing Virginia that she hated everything
Bloomsbury stood for. VW's ups-and-downs in her relations with all her
friends were mirrored in her attitude to her work. She see-sawed
bewilderingly between exaltation and utter despair and was over-sensitive to
reviews and verbal criticism.
After King's thorough biography, which inevitably concludes with her suicide
in 1941 as the threat of Nazi invasion loomed, we will not need another life
of Virginia Woolf for some time to come.
