   Former President Lyndon B. Johnson bragged he was
a World War II hero, but he actually observed only 13 minutes of
combat, according to a book to be published next year.
   An excerpt from ``Means of Ascent'' published Monday in the New
Yorker magazine claims the Silver Star that Johnson said he won for
his heroism in World War II was awarded merely as a political
gesture by Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
   The book, by Robert A. Caro, will be the second volume of his
comprehensive biography of Johnson, covering the former president's
``hopelessness and despair'' from 1941 to 1948.
   Caro writes that in the years after the war Johnson ``portrayed
himself as a war-scarred veteran of many battles on many fronts.''
   Actually, Caro says, Mr. Johnson saw combat in the South
Pacific, only as an observer, ``for a total of 13 minutes.''
   ``Not only did Johnson accept the Silver Star,'' the New Yorker
serialization says, ``he arranged to accept it in public. Several
times. Buying the decoration (in an Army-Navy store in Washington),
he took it to Texas, where, in a number of public appearances, it
was affixed to his lapel as if for the first time.''
   Caro said ``Johnson rapidly came to feel not only that he
deserved it but that he deserved more: that the Silver Star was not
a sufficiently high honor for such heroism as his.''
   George Christian, Johnson's presidential press secretary, said
Monday he never heard Johnson brag about his war record.
   ``I never heard him embellish it, although he did wear his
little Silver Star in his lapel,'' Christian said. ``It's
conceivable. A lot of people in World War II like to imagine they
did more than they did.''
   Caro's first volume, ``The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Path to
Power,'' was published in 1982 and won the National Book Critic's
Circle Award for non-fiction.
   Earlier, Caro won a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of New York
power broker Robert Moses.
   Caro said Monday he spent four years near Austin researching
Johnson's early years. He said what emerged from his interviews was
a portrait less flattering than those found in some of the 17
Johnson biographies published before his.
   ``Texans are very honest,'' he said. ``They will not lie to you.
If you can find the right question, they will answer.''
   Lady Bird Johnson, the former president's widow, stopped
cooperating with him early in his research, Caro said. But former
Texas Gov. John Connally decided to talk to Caro only after reading
the first volume. Connally granted four days of interviews.
