TROLLOPE by Victoria Glendinning Hutchinson Pounds 20, 551 pages
IN AN ideal world there would be some sort of central mart of exchange to
which biographers could apply for information about who else was working on
the same subject. This would be particularly helpful when the relevant
sources were in the public domain.
Official biographers who are given first and exclusive access to a person's
papers are in a different situation. Their work cannot be pre-empted. They
may or may not produce books worth reading, but at least there is no danger
of being forestalled. When Lord Beaverbrook invited me in 1950 to write the
life of Bonar Law, whose papers he owned, I felt safe on that score - if not
on others.
I was in a more perilous situation in 1958 when I decided, unprompted, to
embark on a biography of Disraeli, whose official life had been completed in
1920 and whose papers had been open to inspection for many years, though in
physically daunting conditions. I saw no way of ascertaining what might be
in the pipeline and resolved to take a risk, but I was momentarily dismayed
when a US professor published a book on Disraeli's youth which anticipated a
discovery I thought I had made about Disraeli's early sexual imbroglios.
Luckily for me the book was by a toiler in what Paul Johnson has described
as the 'Eng. Lit. Crit. Industry', and therefore unreadable.
These personal reflections are prompted by the remarkable outburst of
Biographia Trollopiana which has occurred in the last four years. When
Victoria Glendinning began her research in 1988 she had no idea that three
other authors - all of them American, as it happens - were busy in the same
field and had been for several years. The last serious life of Trollope, by
James Pope-Hennessy, had appeared in 1971.
There is no obvious reason for the revival of interest, no centenary or
other significant date, yet the appearance of four biographies, of which
this is the latest, coincides with the foundation of the Trollope Society of
London and New York which is publishing a uniform edition of the novels. It
also coincides with the placing of a memorial in Poets Corner in Westminster
Abbey and with a Prime Minister who is a Trollope fan (not the first to be)
and who took for holiday reading, no doubt as a relaxation from perusal of
the Treaty of Maastricht, The Small House at Allington, which Victoria
Glendinning, if she had to make a choice, would place among the seven best
of all the novels.
I have read only one of the three earlier biographies, Richard Mullen's
Anthony Trollope, A Victorian In His World (Duckworth 1990). Reviewing it
for the Financial Times I described it as 'a great literary biography, one
of the best to appear in recent times. It is unlikely ever to be
superseded'. I would stand by that verdict. Victoria Glendinning has not
superseded Mullen, nor has she made any such claim. What she has done is to
write a perceptive and sensitive study of Trollope's life and writings from
a slightly different angle.
Mullen saw the key to Trollope in his desire to be respected not only as a
novelist but as a serious writer who wanted to influence public life. Hence
the importance of his non-fiction works and, apart from those, his important
role as a Post Office official - inventor of the pillar box - and his
unhappy foray into politics when he stood in 1868 as an unsuccessful Liberal
candidate for the infinitely corrupt seat of Beverley.
Mullen saw Trollope's travel books and articles on British and US politics
as 'the best portrayal of his personality . . . I see his non-fiction as the
key to his fiction.' There is a great deal in this interpretation and
Richard Mullen's use of the travel books and his full analysis of the
affairs of the Victorian Post Office are very illuminating.
Victoria Glendinning's emphasis is rather different. She sees him as a man
with an outer and an inner life. Behind the bluff, noisy, seemingly
extrovert clubman, raconteur and shrewd man of business, there was a highly
emotional person who understood affairs of the heart, the ways of men and
women, the balance of power between the sexes in and out of marriage, with
an acumen unrivalled among the Victorian novelists.
She does not underplay his public life but emphasises that it was balanced
by another aspect, and she makes full use of his novels and autobiography to
explain it. The publishers make something of the first biography of Trollope
by a woman and Glendinning seems to believe that his wife Rose has been
neglected by previous writers. These matters of 'gender' can be overdone. In
fact there is just as much, if not more, about Rose in Richard Mullen's
book.
Trollopians should have both these biographies on their bookshelves, but if
they have space or money for only one I would, at the risk of the charge of
male chauvinism, advise Mullen's. His book is longer by 200 pages, more
scholarly in terms of notes and index, and equally well written. The major
sources in both books are the same and inevitably there is a great deal of
overlap.
It was brave of Victoria Glendinning to go ahead in the knowledge of these
forthcoming works but Trollope admirers will be glad that she did. Whether
the market can sustain four biographies of the same person in four years is
another matter. That is something for authors and publishers - especially
the latter - to consider, not for reviewers.
The Collected Shorter Fiction of Anthony Trollope, containing 42 short
stories, edited by Julian Thompson, will be published next month by Robinson
Publishing (Pounds 25, 959 pages)
