A PASSION FOR FRIENDSHIP: SIBYL COLEFAX AND HER CIRCLE by Kirsty McLeod
Michael Joseph Pounds 20, 180 pages
'IF I dine with you, I shan't sleep; if I don't sleep, I cant write. You say
this dont matter a straw. I quite agree with you. But my next year's income
depends on sending a book to America in August. It aint half done, owing to
dining out. So theres no more to be said.'
The date is 1931. The handwriting - with its odd lack of apostrophes - is
that of Virginia Woolf. The recipient? Lady Sybil Colefax.
On receiving a refusal couched in those terms, most people would be inclined
to delete the writer's name from future guest-lists. Sibyl's reaction was
the opposite - to send Virginia three further invitations for other
dinner-parties. Eventually Virginia caved in and became a friend of hers.
A friend? Yes, but the kind of friend you make fun of behind her back to
your real friends, the kind of friend you do your best to put off when she
invites herself to stay with you in the country:
'Dearest Sibyl, Yes delighted Thursday 8th but, (1) View is ruined (2) No
room for chauffeur in house (3) The smallest possible doghole for you (4)
Village char is cook Let me know if you are daunted. If not, whether we
shall meet a train: if so, which. Yours in haste (not hate) Virginia No
clothes but nightgowns worn here.'
Poor Sibyl] But if her friends often were bitchy about her, biographers have
been kinder, pointing to the heart of gold beneath the absurdities, to the
core of loyalty in friendship, masked by Sibyl's indefatigable collector's
instinct for the famous. Brian Masters had a judicious chapter on her in his
book Great Hostesses (1982) where Sibyl emerged as positively saintly beside
the likes of Mrs Ronnie Greville and Emerald Cunard. Now Kirsty McLeod has
filled the portrait out more fully.
Sibyl Halsey was born in 1874, daughter of an Indian civil servant. The
first great man Sibyl encountered was Lockwood Kipling, Rudyard's father.
The Kipling connection remained firm after Sibyl had grown up and become a
great hostess of London society. A young woman of her ambitious temperament,
desirous of moving in the world of celebrities, might have been expected to
marry a genius, or a perhaps a title, but Sibyl was shrewder than that. She
found her fate in Arthur Colefax, a grammar school boy who became an eminent
lawyer, then an MP, and was knighted for his work running the scientific
side of the manufacture of munitions in the First World War.
They occupied a grand house in the King's Road, Chelsea, where Sibyl
entertained almost everyone of any eminence. At the height of her career in
the 1930s her regular guests included HG Wells, Maynard Keynes, JL Garvin,
Oswald Mosley, Robert Bruce Lockhart, John Gielgud, Edward Lutyens, Gerald
Berners, Artur Rubinstein, Roger Fry, Noel Coward, Andre Maurois, Alfred
Beit, Desmond MacCarthy, Gertrude Lawrence, Brendan Bracken, Mrs Churchill,
Alexander Korda, Lord Beaverbrook, the Duke of Buccleuch, Rebecca West, the
Mountbattens, the Dufferins, the Jebbs, the Wellesleys - to list but a few
of the names in Sibyl's Visitor's Book.
Sibyl's success may in part be ascribed to her persistence, to the immense
trouble she took, and to her flair for invariably producing the man or woman
of the moment - 'Paul Valery will be in London on Tuesday. Do come along and
meet him' - but one gathers there was more to it than simply her ability to
deliver the goods. Sibyl had great courage. She was fiercely
anti-appeasement. Above all she was someone in whom you could safely
confide.
When the King's mistress, Mrs Simpson, had to decide whether or not to
abandon her beloved, it was to her friend Sibyl that she turned for support.
The full correspondence between Sibyl and the Duchess of Windsor has not yet
been published. After it was all over, Osbert Sitwell, one of Sibyl's
enemies, lampooned her in his poem Rat Week. 'Coalbox' was what the
malicious Sitwells always called her.
At the same time Sibyl suffered serious private adversity. Her husband's
increasing deafness, coupled with unwise investments in the US, led to the
almost total loss of their income. Now Sibyl showed her pluck and
resilience. Following the lead of other women in society like Syrie Maugham,
Sibyl set herself up professionally as an interior decorator. She joined
forces with the furniture-maker John Fowler to found the firm Colefax and
Fowler which still exists today.
A smaller house in Westminster proved less satisfactory for her parties, but
she carried on regardless. Even another world war could not stifle her
compulsion to entertain. By now a widow, Sibyl made the Dorchester Hotel her
wartime centre of operations; she would send each of her guests a bill to
meet his share of the evening's cost. Everyone paid without a murmur.
Sibyl's Ordinaries - as these parties were called - were one of the more
bizarre manifestations of well-bred defiance to the rigours of the London
blitz.
Sibyl survived the war, but died of cancer in 1950. Kirsty McLeod certainly
convinces us in this short readable book that Sibyl deserved more than the
footnote biographers usually give her.
