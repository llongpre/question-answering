SCOTT FITZGERALD by Jeffrey Meyers Macmillan Pounds 17.99, 400 pages
Literary biography is an impossible art. You can detail the life of the
writer, but how can you ever begin to understand what happens when he sits
down at his solitary desk? We know, for instance, from so many biographies,
of the events that made up Joseph Conrad's life - the Polish uncle, ships in
the South China Sea, - but we can never hope to be present at that moment
when he turns to his manuscript of Heart of Darkness.
Scott Fitzgerald presents another, rather different example. From his CV,
from the notebooks, from the memoirs of friends, we know he was an appalling
species of a young American. He was callow, arrogant, snobbish,
self-absorbed, irresponsible, hedonistic and - most important of all - he
was a drunk. Yet - and yet] - he was one of the most wonderful writers of
this century. So how does one understand those hung-over mornings when he
staggered back to the draft of The Great Gatsby? Let alone those doomed,
liver-dead days in Hollywood 15 years later as he struggled, and failed, to
finish The Last Tycoon? We can never know what happened inside his head, and
he, like most writers, was not able to tell us.
Jeffrey Meyers is an American academic and an extremely prolific biographer
of 20th-century novelists: he knocks off these books with near-annual
enthusiasm, and sometimes it shows. With Scott Fitzgerald he has taken on a
subject as difficult as any: there is a classic biography by Arthur Mizener
dating back 40 years (The Far Side of Paradise) and various later efforts
including the purple and indulgent but very detailed Some Sort of Epic
Grandeur by Fitzgerald's academic guardian, Matthew Bruccoli. Do we need
another?
The answer, I'm afraid, must be negative. This one is supposed to be 'more
analytic and interpretive', but the story is more or less the same (except
for new light on one of the less important mistresses) and the discussion of
the books is pedestrian and unilluminating: to mention just one example, the
comparison with, and influence of, Conrad needs much more attack and
development to be worthwhile.
There is less sympathy than in earlier biographies for Fitzgerald's
all-too-evident shortcomings. We get the drinking and the hooliganism, the
nightmare of a wife called Zelda, the bluffer and failure as student,
sportsman, soldier, the limitations of writing that was based on personal
experience.
But the remaining and unexplained mystery is that Fitzgerald produced such
wonderful fiction and wrote like an angel. In 1919 he retreated to St Paul
and, by dint of hard work, turned himself that summer from Princeton poseur
into a professional writer, able from then on to spin highly paid
short-stories as well as the real stuff, so that by 1920 he was famous for
This Side of Paradise. In the middle of the sophomoric nonsense on the
Riviera in 1924, and despite Zelda, he managed to write The Great Gatsby.
In those years the tragic pattern was established: he churned out stories
for the Saturday Evening Post to support his extravagant life style while
always understanding that he ought to be devoting himself to the novels: 'I
now get Dollars 2000 a story,' he wrote to a friend, 'and they get worse and
worse, and my ambition is to get where I need write no more but only novels
. . .' Gatsby made no money.
Meyers is so stern on his subject that, beyond admitting the man had
'charm', he understates the sheer hard slog, the professionalism, the
perseverance-beyond-the-bottle, which made Fitzgerald so much more than a
handsome lush. And of course, Meyers cannot explain the gift.
The relationship with Hemingway will always fascinate, and Meyers, who is
also a biographer of Hemingway, should be qualified to discuss what was both
friendship and rivalry. Fitzgerald, wrote Hemingway early on, 'had a
marvellous talent and the thing is to use it - not whine in public'. In a
later memoir by his son, he was reported as saying, 'Scott's writing got
better and better, but no-one realised it, not even Scott. Despite his
rummyhood and perhaps because of Zelda, who really made him the box with the
handles, he got better and better. The stuff he was writing at the end was
the best of all. Poor bastard.'
So Papa got it right. As did Scott himself, when he wrote, to his wife, 'I
think everyone . . . guessed at your almost megalomaniacal selfishness and
my insane indulgence to drink . . .'
That was one part of the truth: at another level, his Princeton friend and
later editor Edmund Wilson wrote: 'He has been given imagination without
intellectual control of it; he has been given the desire for beauty without
an aesthetic ideal; and he has been given a gift for expression without very
many ideas to express'.
Some friend] Was Wilson right? The only response is to go back to the books.
Go back, also, to The Crack-up, that extraordinarily brave self-analysis,
and the Notebooks, where you will read his sad epitaph: 'Then I was drunk
for many years, and then I died'.
