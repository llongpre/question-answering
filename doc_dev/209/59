Good grief! Charlie Brown is 40 years old? 
</P>
<P>
Yep. Charlie and the rest of the "Peanuts" gang hit the Big Four-O, a midlife 
plateau that usually sets off a good deal of soul searching in most folks. Just 
don't expect to see it mentioned in the award-winning strip. 
</P>
<P>
"A comic strip should not make self-conscious statements," says Charles Schulz, 
67, creator of the "Peanuts" characters who appear in more than 2,000 
newspapers in 68 nations. "There will be nothing in the strip." 
</P>
<P>
But that hardly means the milestone will pass unnoticed. An exhibition is 
planned at the Louvre in Paris, and half time at the Super Bowl next January 
will feature a birthday extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, the story of Charlie, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus and friends can 
finally be told. The whole truth comes out in the shy cartoonist's biography, 
"Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz," due Thursday from Pharos Books. 
</P>
<P>
The book by Rheta Grimsley Johnson is a first, says Phyllis Henrici of Pharos, 
a sister company of the Scripps Howard newspaper chain. Schulz draws for United 
Features Syndicate, a Scripps Howard subsidiary. "Publishers have wanted to do 
a biography of him for years, but he hasn't wanted to authorize one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
What made the difference this time? "I liked her right away," Schulz said of 
Johnson, a columnist for the Memphis Commercial Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lured by Art Ad 
</P>
<P>
Schulz studied art when he was in high school, after he saw a "Do you like to 
draw?" advertisement. "The truth is, I wasn't a very good student," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His first professional job was doing lettering for drawings in Timeless Topix, 
a Catholic comic book. He later taught at the Art Instruction School and sold 
cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post. 
</P>
<P>
His cartoon feature, "Li'l Folks," the start of Peanuts, was developed for St. 
Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. The strip was sold to a syndicate in 1950, and the 
name changed to "Peanuts." 
</P>
<P>
Although the book contains stories about all the strip's characters, the most 
interesting is about a character never shown -- the "little red-haired girl" 
who is Charlie Brown's unrequited love. 
</P>
<P>
"Peanuts" began syndication on Oct. 2, 1950, 19 days after Schulz's proposal of 
marriage was turned down in his native St. Paul, Minn., by Donna Mae Wold, the 
original red-haired girl. 
</P>
<P>
"It's heartbreaking," said Schulz, who proposed five years after plowing across 
France in a half-track as an infantryman during World War II. "It's something 
you never get over, but I think the only purpose in recounting the story was to 
show how experience prompts a cartoonist's ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, whose book discloses that the artist suffers from depression, says 
Schulz's life contains many rejections he translated to the strip. "Rejection 
is his specialty, losing his hobby. He has spent a lifetime perfecting 
failure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fighting Agoraphobia 
</P>
<P>
At first, Johnson thought the artist was kidding about Wold's turning him down. 
"He talked about it as if it took place last year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with depression, the artist also has bouts of agoraphobia, the fear of 
being alone in public places from which escape might be difficult. "The sight 
of a hotel lobby, for example, puts Schulz in a sweat," writes Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Such fears and troubles are too bad, says the author. Yet, there would not be 
Schulz's "unique gift to the world without the sensitivity that so limits his 
personal life."
