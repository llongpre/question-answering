DR JOHNSON AND MR SAVAGE
by Richard Holmes
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 19.99, 260 pages
THE LAST we heard of Richard Holmes was that he was engaged on a massive
life of Coleridge. The first volume - Coleridge: Early Visions - appeared a
couple of years ago to a bevy of appreciative reviews including the one in
this newspaper by the present reviewer. Having got Coleridge poised in
mid-career, Holmes seems to have temporarily deserted him to take a little
holiday. Holmes's idea of a holiday being to write a book, a shorter book
that required much less research - and the result is Dr Johnson &amp; Mr Savage.
One might be tempted to call it a quickie, but like everything Holmes does,
it is carefully written and argued.
The material mainly comes from printed sources, the chief being Dr Johnson's
Life of Richard Savage. In popular editions of Johnson's Lives of the Poets,
such as the Worlds Classics, this Life appears as one among many. The bulk
of them were written on commission by Johnson when he was famous as prefaces
for an edition of the English poets' works in several volumes. But the Life
of Savage was written and published more than 30 years earlier than the
others, in 1744.
Johnson wrote it the year after Savage died - at the behest of Edward Cave,
the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine, the journal that printed work by
both Johnson and Savage. It was in Cave's office above the medieval arch at
St John's Gate in Clerkenwell (still there) that Johnson and Savage probably
met. Johnson was then an obscure young man of letters recently married;
Savage at 41 an established poet, capable at short notice of turning out
ringing panegyrics in rhyming couplets on anything under the sun. A bond of
friendship soon formed.
Both were penniless. They were so poor that they would spend the night
pacing the streets of London in animated literary discussion until dawn.
Savage also had more disreputable friends with whom he would go
pub-crawling. On one of his late-night visits to a tavern in the their
company, Savage became involved in a brawl in which a man was killed during
a sword-fight. Johnson was not present but gives an account of this in the
Life.
Savage was subsequently tried at the Old Bailey and convicted of murder. It
was only after a vigorous campaign by his friends in high places that a
royal pardon was obtained. And it was after his release from prison that
Savage's career really took off with poems like 'The Bastard' - Savage
claimed he was the illegitimate son of the Countess of Macclesfield - and
'The Wanderer', enshrining his basic fantasies about himself. Then after a
period of glory his life took a turn for the worse again and he died
disgraced.
Savage was one of those impossible people who possess enormous, irresistible
charm until they become completely stoned when they turn into colossally
aggressive bores. He emerges in Holmes's account as a singular instance of
the Poet as both Charmer and Sponger, a kind of 18th century Dylan Thomas.
And Holmes reveals how thoroughly the young Johnson surrendered to Savage's
appeal.
Disappointed at not being made poet laureate by George II, Savage appointed
himself what he called 'Volunteer Laureat' to Queen Caroline and wrote an
annual poem in her honour - a splendid example of Savage's chutzpah, in
reward for which the Queen, who had a weakness for poets and flattery,
granted him an annual sum. But on her death this was discontinued, and
Savage was on his uppers again. A group of well-wishers and poets led by
Pope, generous in his private dealings, banded together to make up the
deficit on condition Savage left London for good and took up residence in
rural Wales where - they vainly hoped - he would keep out of mischief.
Exhibit B in Holmes's exhumation of the relations between Johnson and Savage
is Johnson's 'London: A Poem' (printed by Cave in 1738, the poem with which
Johnson first began to make a name for himself among the literati). In it
the poet laments the departure of a friend - one Thales - from London to
Wales: 'Tho' Grief and Fondness in my Breast rebel/ When injur'd Thales bids
the Town farewell . . .'
Much scholarly ink has been expended on the question of whether the hero of
the poem may be interpreted as being Savage. Holmes thinks he is and he sees
the poem as the forerunner of the Life of Savage. But in his Life of
Johnson, Boswell denied that Savage was Thales. The Boswellians point to the
poem's Latin original - the Third Satire of Juvenal. The original contains a
figure called Umbricius who leaves Rome in disgust at its mores to reside in
the country and Thales, they say, is merely a fictitious equivalent.
Holmes sees this as an attempt by the Boswellians to cover up Johnson's
early friendship with the scapegrace bard. Johnson had studiously not
revealed that he was the indigent nocturnal friend in his Life of Savage. It
was a youthful episode now best forgotten, incompatible with Johnson as the
stern moralist, the judgmental father-figure. John Wain endorses the lasting
influence of Savage on the young Johnson, in his biography of Johnson, but
says he 'cannot see that 'London' would have been any different if Johnson
had never met Savage'.
Holmes does us a double-service - firstly by reviving interest in the
raffish yet attractive figure of Savage who died in 1743 in Bristol's
Newgate jail; and secondly in positing a rather different, a more radical
and bohemian Dr Johnson, to complement the traditional figure of the Great
Tory Cham. But in his final claim that Johnson's Life of Savage also makes
him the founding father of the modern literary biographer, Holmes presses
his case a little too far.
Unlike those contemporary biographers who are able to set aside years of
their lives to complete their tasks, accumulating overwhelming detail,
Johnson was a literary journalist working severly against the clock. He
relied heavily on the 18th century tradition of anecdotes and is on record
as saying: 'I wrote forty-eight of the printed octavo pages of the Life of
Savage at a sitting; but then I sat up all night'. With respect - the
correct lineage is not Johnson, Holroyd, Holmes, Glendinning; but Johnson,
Sainte-Beuve, Strachey, Nicolson, Connolly.
