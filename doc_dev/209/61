   Most scions of Hollywood's founding fathers
guard the family archives as if they were CIA files. But Samuel
Goldwyn Jr. gave total access to his father's biographer, A. Scott
Berg.
   ``I felt it was the only way I could attract a first-class
biographer,'' said the younger Goldwyn, himself the head of a
prosperous film company. ``It's a gamble you take.
   ``My father said he wanted `an honest book.' I took him at his
word. I'm not sure if he were alive that he would want it quite so
honest. I think that it is on the whole an honest biography. When
someone gives you 8{ years of his life to do this book, as Scott
did, you have to take that chance.''
   Why did it take so long to research and write ``Goldwyn: A
Biography'' (Knopf, $24.95)?
   ``Research, research, research,'' the 39-year-old author said.
``I was given access to a real treasure trove of material,
basically 50 years of Hollywood history, none of which anyone had
ever gone through. So it was all there for the first time.
   ``I immediately realized that with this material I could tell
the whole history of Hollywood. So I wanted to interview as many
people as I could from the various eras that were included. I
interviewed about 250 people, of whom 60 are dead now.''
   Goldwyn and Berg were interviewed at the Century City offices of
The Goldwyn Co. Young Sam operates in his own manner, building his
company with smaller films and foreign releases. He's now branching
out with big-name movies such as ``Stella'' with Bette Midler.
   Goldwyn appears to have escaped the soul-numbing later life that
has afflicted many sons of the pioneers. How?
   ``I had a very strong father, but I also had one who taught me
that the most important thing is to survive,'' he said. ``If
there's any one message in this book, it's about survival _ human
survival in Hollywood.''
   Berg added: ``If Sam Goldwyn was not the most interesting of
Hollywood producers, he was certainly the most quintessential. I
thought his life would be the most interesting lens through which I
could tell the whole history of the movies.
   ``What sustained me throughout was that I genuinely admired him
for the career he put together. We're all dealt a hand at birth,
and I think he was dealt a lousy one _ a lot of twos, threes and
fours, no picture cards.
   ``There he was in Poland at the height of the pogroms. His
family situation he was not crazy about: His father died while he
was very young, and he was responsible for the support of his
mother and five siblings. Pretty awful. Nothing going for him
except this enormous drive, enormous energy, enormous will to
survive.''
   Like many immigrants in the early century, he was drawn to the
movie business. He joined with Jesse Lasky and Cecil B. DeMille to
produce one of Hollywood's first features, ``The Squaw Man.'' But
Goldwyn could never tolerate partners, and he soon launched his own
company.
   Many people thought the producer was part of
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Not so. He had sold his interest in his
company, which kept the Goldwyn name, by the time it merged with
Louis B. Mayer's studio and the Metro Co.
   As an independent, the Samuel Goldwyn Co. produced an
astonishing number of classics: ``Stella Dallas,'' ``Dodsworth,''
``Dead End,'' ``Wuthering Heights,'' ``The Little Foxes, ``The
Pride of the Yankees,'' ``The Best Years of Our Lives,'' ``Guys and
Dolls.'' His last movie was a disappointing adaptation of the
Broadway hit ``Porgy and Bess'' in 1958.
   Goldwyn suffered a stroke in 1969 and died in 1974 at age 94.
The Samuel Goldwyn Co. dissolved. Sam Jr.'s firm, The Goldwyn Co.,
was an entirely new enterprise, but it did retain the original
Goldwyn film catalog.
   Berg, who wrote the acclaimed ``Max Perkins: Editor of Genius,''
covers it all and provides a few surprises. The major one: the
great love in the life of Frances Goldwyn, Sam's wife, was director
George Cukor (``My Fair Lady'').
   Despite Mrs. Goldwyn's deep feelings, the relationship was
platonic, since Cukor was a homosexual. Nevertheless, Mrs. Goldwyn
arranged for Cukor to be buried at Forest Lawn alongside herself,
her husband and her mother.
