FREYA STARK: A BIOGRAPHY
by Molly Izzard
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 25, 342 pages
ONE OF the curious things about Freya Stark's travel books is that she is
always falling ill. It comes as a bit of a shock to the armchair reader to
realise that this famous maiden lady voyaging to the remoter corners of
Arabia was a hypochondriac: we begin to wonder why. But she cannot have been
as frail as all that. Tomorrow, in her home in Asolo, she arrives at her one
hundredth birthday. Perhaps it is just as well that the old girl is in no
mental state to be aware of this new biography.
Molly Izzard, who is herself a long-time Middle East hand, has decided that
it is time to de-bunk - to de-mythologise - Dame Freya's carefully presented
life story. To do this she has placed herself, as biographer, at front of
stage, and described her long and fascinating investigation into the truth
behind the legendary image of the Great Traveller. Her exploration of a
personality, as she puts it, takes her into territory which Dame Freya (in
her voluminous memoirs and published letters) and her faithful friends have
always been careful to avoid.
The first 35 years, for example, have had only the sketchiest of maps. Now
we can see the semi-invalid daughter of an unhappy middle-class marriage,
traumatised and scarred by a head wound and jilted by her Italian fiance,
taking Arabic lessons with the vague idea of becoming a governess in the
Middle East. Once into Lebanon with a wealthy woman friend in 1928, Freya
discovered her vocation.
But hold on, says Mrs Izzard - she was never a serious explorer: her pre-war
travels were very modest and brief affairs, as the local colonial officers
always knew, though they were willing to help her and rescue her when she
fell sick. Her true gift lay in her writing - 'the deft concealment of the
practical under the poetic' as the biographer describes it - in which she
re-worked the material first drafted in the thousands of letters she used
instead of a journal. Dame Freya, it is correctly insisted, is not worthy of
the frequent comparison with Gertrude Bell.
That is also true of her wartime activities when she was posted to Cairo and
Baghdad to organise her 'Brotherhood of Freedom', the Ikhwan al Hurriyah, a
clandestine network of pro-British locals whose importance is hard to assess
in these post-Nasser days - a sort of 'Greenmantle in reverse' is Izzard's
witty comment (Buchan's version was the Ka'aba al Hurriyah). What is clear
is that by the end of the war Freya Stark was a celebrity, her reputation as
a Middle East expert established, but by no means justified with hindsight.
By this time, and after the necessary passage on Freya's late and absurd
marriage to her homosexual colleague Stewart Perowne, Mrs Izzard loses
interest. There is next to nothing in this book about the past 40 years of
Dame Freya's life, and rather too much on the newly discovered family
background. There is also too much speculation about motivation.
We are to understand that Dame Freya was in reality an egotistic
self-publicist, naive, exploitative and spiteful to old friends, a
psychosomatic fantasist who used her symptoms to attract attention, an
Edwardian imperialist who never had any sense of Arab nationalism. 'Her
preferred associates were wealthy, with important connections or influential
family backgrounds, preferably rather grand. She had little time for the
humble and the obscure except as ministrants to her own comfort and needs,
on whom her bland affability and easy manner usually produced a gratified
willingness to be made use of . . .'
This last does at least suggest that she had charm, as her friends would
certainly agree. Whether she was in love with her mother - or with her
father - and what that meant for her sexuality . . . well, by now Mrs Izzard
is out of her depth.
This book was commissioned by Dame Freya's attentive and long-suffering
publishers, John Murray, who, when they saw it, changed their mind. They had
earlier declined the eight volumes of collected letters which Dame Freya
insisted on publishing in her eighties. But it is worth going back, not just
to the 1930s travel books but also to the John Murray 1988 selection of
letters in one volume, Over the Rim of the World. There is a tone of voice
in them which this mischievous, very readable birthday present does not
adequately acknowledge.
