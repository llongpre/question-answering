It has been a wonderful year for biography, a difficult craft which is
surely going through a golden age. Fiction this year has been problematical
(see the Booker Prize]) but there has been a flow of excellent biographies
whose subjects have been drawn more often from literature than from
politics.
Not a week passes when there is not a biography to top the books pages. This
year has brought weighty (in both senses) and readable lives of Hardy,
Virginia Woolf, Richard Hughes, Charlotte Bronte, Balzac, Stendhal, James
Baldwin, Kipling, Shakespeare, Brecht and Greene.
From my own reading, I would want to highlight another half-dozen. First and
foremost, a brilliant trio of literary biographies: on DH Lawrence (The
Married Man, by Brenda Maddox, Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 20); on The
Brontes by Juliet Barker (Weidenfeld, Pounds 25); and on Evelyn Waugh by
Selina Hastings (Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 20). These three are contesting
the various awards - and there is no point in asking why so many of the best
literary biographers are women.
The Lawrence book is unashamedly sympathetic to the man and to his German
wife, Frieda: Brenda Maddox likes Lawrence, and persuades us that he was a
good and lovable as well as a great man. The Barker book - following hard on
the heels of an excellent biography of Charlotte Bronte earlier in the year
by Lyndall Gordon (Chatto, Pounds 17.99) - is dramatically revisionist
stuff, from a former curator of the Haworth museum, stripping out the
stereotypes, murdering the myths - 1,000 pages but impossible to miss for
any devotee of that extraordinary family. As for Evelyn Waugh, you might
reckon that he deserves a rest, but Selina Hastings has produced a splendid
read emphasising his early years.
Historical biography is led by another distinguished book from Claire
Tomalin, a brilliant summoning of the life of Dora Jordan, top actress,
mistress of the future William IV, mother of a dozen of his children, who
was cast aside for reasons of state (Mrs Jordan's Profession, Viking Pounds
18). Add to the history list important new biographies of William Tyndale by
David Daniell (Yale, Pounds 19.95), Curzon by David Gilmour (John Murray,
Pounds 25) and Chamberlain by Peter T. Marsh (Yale, Pounds 30).
I got more simple fun from the stories of two colonial figures, early and
late - Livingstone (hardly a new subject but well revived in Journey to
Livingstone by Timothy Holmes (Canongate Press, Pounds 17.99) and the nutty
Francis Younghusband, invader of Tibet and a hippy ahead of his time
(Younghusband, the Last Great Imperial Adventurer by Patrick French,
HarperCollins Pounds 20). Best of all, for the late-Victorian period, was
Fiona MacCarthy's end-year life of William Morris (Faber, Pounds 25), which
brings together the radical politics with the medievally-inspired crafts.
But the lives of writers seem to be more attractive to publishers than those
of politicians, with the exception of old stalwarts like Churchill: there
was a new and controversial biography by Clive Ponting (Sinclair-Stevenson,
Pounds 20) and a rather odd collection, Eminent Churchillians, by Andrew
Roberts (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Pounds 20).
Scott Fitzgerald, for instance, collected another biography, from the
prolific Jeffrey Meyers (Macmillan, Pounds 17.99), and another American
drunk, John Steinbeck, was rather luckier at the hands of Jay Parini
(Heineman, Pounds 20). There was a batch of books about Graham Greene, but
reserve judgment until the final volume of Norman Sherry's trilogy.
Oh, there was also a biography of the Prince of Wales . . .
