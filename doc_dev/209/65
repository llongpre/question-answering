   When Master Sgt. Samuel Kanyon Doe
seized power, his people hailed him as a hero redeeming them from
serfdom imposed by descendants of freed American slaves who founded
Liberia.
   He clung to power for 10 years the way he gained it: with brutal
killings of challengers that shocked the world and left many
Liberians ashamed to admit their nationality.
   ``He and his bank accounts have grown fat, literally, on the
blood and flesh of our people,'' said a Liberian university
professor.
   President Doe, 38, refused repeated demands that he resign and
leave the country, and U.S. State Department said he had died of
wounds suffered in a gun and grenade battle with rebels of a small
faction led by Prince Johnson, who used to fight in Doe's army.
   The rebels quarreled with Doe when he turned up unexpectedly at
the headquarters of a West African regional force Sunday in
Monrovia's port. The regional troops came to Liberia in the hopes
of restoring peace. Rebels claimed Doe had finally decided to flee
the country, wracked by war since Dec. 24.
   More than 60 people, most of them Doe's bodyguards, died in the
fighting that left Doe wounded in both legs. He reportedly died
Sunday in a rebel camp where Johnson was interrogating him about
millions of dollars that disappeared from state coffers.
   Witnesses said Doe's mutilated body was put on display,
according to the British Broadcasting Corp..
   Doe started his political career as a semiliterate career
soldier who sneered at education. He became a portly, dictatorial
despot proud of the masters degree in political science he was
awarded by the University of Liberia.
   ``They got all their Ph.D.s in their books, I got a Ph.D. in M16
(guns),'' he once said. Books is a Liberian pidgeon word for
education.
   But Doe's arrogance masked what sometimes seemed to be an
inferiority complex. When he was forced by mounting opposition to
announce he would not stand for reelection next year, Doe said he
wanted to devote time to his family and get a doctorate.
   In his private life, he was said to be fond of football and
adopted the style of an African potentate, having six children from
his two wives and at least five from his mistresses. His senior
wife left him after the coup.
   Doe once declared he wanted someone else to carry the burden of
leading the nation to end ``political harassment'' that included
about 36 coup attempts. His detractors say many were conjured up as
excuses to kill opponents.
   The most serious of the coup attempts, in 1985, was led by Doe's
former army chief of staff, Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa. He had returned
from exile in the United States to try to oust Doe after blatantly
rigged elections.
   Quiwonkpa got to the gates of Doe's Israeli-built fortified
mansion before his troops were stopped.
   Doe boasted he disemboweled Quiwonkpa, his friend from
childhood. What was left of the general was paraded down Monrovia's
Tubman Boulevard on the back of a jeep by soldiers who stripped
flesh from the body and ate it publicly.
   ``I saw it, hundreds of Liberians saw it. The stories of
cannibalism at the mansion are not fairy tales,'' said a Liberian
clerk.
   An orgy of killings followed as Doe repressed a rebellion. He
sent troops to Quiwonkpa's home county of Nimba. They murdered
thousands of civilians from the Gio and Mano tribes to which the
coup plotters belonged.
   Five years later, the Gio and Mano took their revenge, rallying
to the call of rebel leader Charles Taylor. His rebel army invaded
from neighboring Ivory Coast last December, and Doe sent troops who
again killed hundreds of civilians.
   ``He has doomed us with a legacy of tribal hatred that may never
end, as each side seeks to avenge the killings of the others,''
said a lawyer.
   Doe is a Krahn, a tribe making up 2 percent of Liberia's 2.3
million people. Krahns are despised by most of the other 13 ethnic
groups.
   As for Doe's foreign policy, many Liberians said it was dictated
by greed.
   Liberia became the first African country after Egypt to resume
diplomatic relations with Israel after the Camp David agreement.
Doe then visited Israel and returned with commitments for
cooperation, including training of his feared Special
Anti-Terrorist Unit. Many personal favors were included, critics
claim.
   At the same time, his government is accused of extorting
hundreds of thousands of dollars from Lebanese businessmen who
smuggle diamonds from Liberia, depriving the nation of desperately
needed revenue.
   Libya was the first country to recognize Doe after his coup.
Other African leaders shunned the master sergeant and denounced the
assassination of 68-year-old President William Tolbert in his bed
and the killings of 16 Tolbert aides. The aides were given a
kangaroo trial, fastened to stakes on Monrovia's Atlantic beach,
and shot by a drunken firing squad.
   Doe had said at one point that he had no regrets, though he had
to make some difficult decisions.
   ``It is especially difficult when it comes to signing death
warrants,'' he said in 1985. ``In my lonely moments at night, I
said to myself, `Why should these people be executed?''
