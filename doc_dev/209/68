HENRY JAMES: THE IMAGINATION OF GENIUS
by Fred Kaplan
John Curtis/Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 25, 566 pages
WHEN Leon Edel revised his four-volume biography of Henry James and
condensed it into one volume - Henry James: A Life (1987) - he managed to do
the job in 717 pages plus notes and index. Now another American James
biographer, Fred Kaplan (born 1937 and with previous biographies of Carlyle
and Dickens under his belt) has come along and has performed a similar task,
a complete life from cradle to grave, in a mere 566 pages plus notes, etc.
Kaplan's book prompts three questions. Has the saving of 150 pages of text
resulted in the omission of any significant material that the first-time
reader of a life of Henry James would need to know? Have the five years that
have elapsed since the appearance of the one-volume Life by Edel revealed
some startling material unknown to Edel and included here? And finally, even
if the material is basically the same here, does Kaplan's use and
interpretation of it give the reader a series of radically new insights into
Henry James? The short answer to all these three questions is the same - No.
It must be conceded that Kaplan is a skilful writer who succeeds in reducing
the facts of James's long, arduous literary career, and the complex web of
personal relations it entailed, into a tighter package than Edel did. The
price to be paid for this comparative concision is in loss of readability -
Edel is more enjoyable - and in Kaplan's fewer references to the novels and
stories. Edel traces many more echoes and resonances of the life in the
work.
Some new facts do emerge in Kaplan. The most vivid concerns James's sad
relationship with Constance Fenimore Woolson - an American authoress living
in exile in Italy who contributed to the character of Miss Tina in The
Aspern Papers. This poor lady committed suicide, probably on account of
James's refusal to propose marriage to her. Kaplan has a scene - straight
out of a Roeg movie yet to be made - where, after her death, James takes her
voluminous black dresses with him in a gondola and throws them into the
lagoon. For a long while the sombre garments refuse to drown and bob up out
of the water as black shapes to haunt him.
On the other hand, there is some fresh material in Edel not taken account of
here by Kaplan. He accepts the received view, put out originally by James
himself, that The Turn of the Screw derived from an anecdote told to the
novelist by Edward Benson, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Yet it is rather
odd, as EF (Fred) Benson confessed in As We Were, that none of the Benson
children could ever remember hearing that anecdote from their father.
There may have been some shadowy remark, about children being corrupted by
servants in a big house, from the lips of the archbishop that triggered
James's imagination. But, as Edel fascinatingly showed in his one volume,
the true source was a story 'Temptation' published in the widely ready
American 19th-century story magazine, Frank Leslie's New York Journal (the
forerunner of Collier's). It was a horror story serialised there between
January and June 1855 when James was a schoolboy. The parallels with James's
tale - a villain called Peter Quin who was the valet of an employer who
lived in Harley Street; Quin having a henchman called Miles - these
parallels are too abundant to be mere coincidence. The story was published
anonymously but Edel has deduced the author was Tom Taylor, a former editor
of Punch. 'What James', writes Edel, 'seems to have carried over into his
later years, more than the memory of the names he borrowed, was the sense of
portentous evil in Tom Taylor's story, the insidious power of Peter Quin and
the . . . child victims'.
Both Edel and Kaplan adopt a Freudian stance in their interpretation of the
works. They see little Miles, for instance, as a projection of James's
immediate anxieties about his occupancy of Lamb House, Rye, and more
ingrained fears and jealousies, rooted in childhood, concerning his older
brother William, the professor of psychology, whose approval he wanted for
his purchase of the house. Both biographers are also of a mind in regarding
What Maisie Knew as being crucial in James's efforts to resolve his own
psychological difficulties. In that novel Kaplan affirms that 'James
dramatized his own lifelong problems of growth, choice and personal
freedom'.
Kaplan makes slightly less of the theatrical failure than Edel, who sees it
as the great trauma. (Understandably he does: it was the origin of Edel's
interest in James when as a French-speaking Canadian student of literature
at the University of McGill in Montreal, he published his doctoral thesis in
1931.)
Writing in our contemporary climate, Kaplan is a little freer in dealing
with James's sex-life - the lack of it in practice - than was Edel. James
never seems to have had a real physical affair with anyone of either gender
and it was not until The Wings of the Dove, written when he was pushing 60,
that he intimated that sexual congress had recently occurred between two of
his principal characters. But in his latter years in real life he had a very
physical way of addressing people he was fond of, certain younger men like
the sculptor Hendrik Andersen. 'My dear friend, I pat you on the back . . .'
and similar phrases. Kaplan concludes that James was 'homoerotic' - an
ugly-sounding word he uses a great deal. It comes from psychiatry, defined
in the OED 2nd edition as meaning: 'Pertaining to or characterised by a
tendency for erotic emotions to be centred on a person of the same sex'.
With particular reference to Henry James, it means that basically he was gay
but he never did anything about it.
The psychological profile of James we get from Kaplan may well be perfectly
true but it becomes unhelpful when it serves to concentrate the mind of the
biographer on viewing the fiction largely as a form of self-therapy. One may
hope that the next Jamesian biographer to come along will pull the old boy
up from off the analyst's couch and permit him to stand once more on his own
two feet. What we need now is a biographer who will treat James's fiction
not as the dramatising of interior anxieties but as the expression of the
keenest, most scrupulous observations we possess concerning the men and
women of his period.
