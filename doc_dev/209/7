   President Lyndon Johnson was an ``awesome engine
of a man'' whose personality and deeds cannot be captured in a
book, a former aide said Thursday at a 25th anniversary symposium
celebrating LBJ's 1965 inaugural.
   Lady Bird Johnson and daughters Luci Turpin of Toronto and Lynda
Robb of McLean, Va., were among several hundred people who attended
the symposium of friends and former associates.
   Jack Valenti, special assistant to Johnson in 1963-66, said,
``Nobody knows better than the people in this room that Lyndon
Johnson was many-sided, contradictory, and no one near him, with
the exception of his wife, ever took the total measure of the man.
   ``And so it will be, that none of the written, or yet to be
written, volumes will be definitive on the work President Johnson
performed, on the deeds that he accomplished and on the flaws he
exhibited.''
   Valenti referred to the controversy raging over the second
volume of a three-volume biography of Johnson. The author, Robert
Caro, portrays the former president as a man without scruples who
stole his 1948 election to the U.S. Senate.
   Valenti, now president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said Caro's latest book, ``Means of Ascent,'' and the
earlier volume fall short _ ``way short.''
   ``Every Caro word is dipped in curare, every Caro page squirmed
with loathing. The cards are marked, the deck is stacked,'' he said.
   ``Almost anything that you could say about LBJ had a tinge of
truth except one thing _ you could never say he was dull,'' Valenti
said. ``He was an awesome engine of a man, and you and I in this
room will never, ever again see his like.''
   Former Democratic vice presidential candidate Sargent Shriver, a
Johnson assistant in 1965-68, said the United States ``needs
desperately the vision of a Kennedy and the political genius of a
Johnson and their can-do spirit to get our nation moving again.''
   ``Yes, I've read and heard about Kennedy's alleged womanizing,
and Johnson's alleged theft of an election,'' Shriver said in a
reference to Caro's version of Johnson's narrow 1948 U.S. Senate
victory over former Texas Gov. Coke Stevenson, who was lionized in
the book as a Texas hero.
   ``The only perfect man I've ever heard of is Jesus Christ and
the only perfect woman was his mother, Mary,'' Shriver said. ``So,
I'm not looking for any miraculous reincarnation of virgin birth _
most certainly I'm not looking for a Coke Stevenson.''
   The symposium, co-sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin
and LBJ Library, continues through Saturday.
   Johnson, who became president after the Nov. 22, 1963,
assassination of John F. Kennedy, won the White House on his own in
1964. He retired to his ranch west of Austin in 1969 and lived
there until his death in 1973.
