<P>
From 1925 until 1975, Janet Flanner wrote The New Yorker's Letters From Paris 
under the pseudonym Genet. The daughter of a prosperous Indianapolis mortician, 
who killed himself when she was 19, and a woman whose theatrical ambitions had 
been frustrated by her marriage and the birth of three daughters, Flanner fled 
the Midwest by marrying a classmate from the University of Chicago and moving 
to New York. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, she fled the marriage in the company of Solita Solano, the first 
of the several women she loved, and the two settled eventually in Paris. The 
career of this writer with the ambiguous pen name, considered by admirers 
"America's Toqueville," provides the focus for Brenda Wineapple's respectful, 
responsible but lackluster biography. 
</P>
<P>
On the face of it, Flanner's life promises to make a rich and intriguing tale. 
On her arrival in Paris in the '20s, she was drawn into the community of 
expatriates whose names still glitter today: Gertrude Stein and Alice B. 
Toklas, Sylvia Beach, Ernest Hemingway, Kay Boyle. . . . In addition to her 
Letters From Paris, The New Yorker published her lengthy profiles of some of 
the foremost figures in 20th-Century art, literature and politics, among them 
Pablo Picasso, Edith Wharton, even Adolf Hitler. Although she left France for 
the United States during World War II, on her return, she traveled widely to 
report on the war's aftermath, including the Nuremberg trials. 
</P>
<P>
For years, with the suavity of an international diplomat, she simultaneously 
sustained relationships with three beautiful women -- Solita Solano, Noel 
Haskins Murphy and Natalia Danesi Murray -- "keeping present and former lovers 
and friends away from one another, arranging itineraries and schedules so as to 
prevent discord as much as possible and to protect herself and others." 
</P>
<P>
If Wineapple's account lacks the animation such circumstances would seem to 
engender, the difficulty may lie in the subject herself. To a considerable 
extent, Wineapple makes clear, Genet functioned not just as a nom de plume but 
as a mask, permitting Flanner to remain, in true New Yorker style, "witty, 
distant, and uninvolved." The journalistic advantage of this persona was that 
it permitted a double vision, placing Flanner "inside history because she was 
there, as well as outside it, as an American in Paris, a woman, a spectator." 
</P>
<P>
But the disadvantage to the biographer is suggested by Flanner's resistance to 
writing her memoirs: "After so many years spent studiously avoiding the word I, 
she was hardly about to embark on a project in which the first person was 
essential. Moreover, she must have thought that writing her memoirs would make 
public her private life, and this she would not do. Her life had been an 
eminently private one, devoted to concealment, not revelation, and the 
conscious crafting of an identity." 
</P>
<P>
So adamantine a veneer prohibits the biographer, and therefore the reader, from 
bringing the person crouched beneath it to life; the veneer itself must simply 
do. The remark of one critic reviewing Flanner's generally acclaimed Paris 
Journal might apply to Genet as well: "Rather than objectivity about events 
which no longer excite and which are too fragmentarily related to rank as 
history, the reader might prefer more of Miss Flanner herself." 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, however, a responsible biographer can reveal only what her subject 
has permitted to become known. All the same, Wineapple might have strengthened 
her presentation through more penetrating literary judgment and livelier 
literary techniques. She cites, for example, one of Flanner's major themes, her 
lifelong wistfulness for the past, noting that in 1921, she believed that "the 
civilization of today, influenced by bourgeoise self-interest, is moving away 
from an ideal," embodied in the Acropolis. 
</P>
<P>
By 1968, "the world seemed more and more incomprehensible, with its burgeoning 
skyscrapers, its ugliness, its continuing violence, its youth subculture, its 
scatalogical language," and Flanner "craved a turning backward," this time not 
to Attic glory but to the same 1920s she had earlier decried. But Wineapple 
never explores the significance of this implicit intellectual stasis for 
Flanner the woman or Genet the writer. 
</P>
<P>
Genet's strengths, according to Wineapple, lay in "her strong reactions, her 
vivid pictorial sense, her sharp metaphor, her common sense, and even the 
crushes she sometimes got on people and movements." With the exception of 
common sense, these qualities are largely missing from the biography. 
</P>
<P>
A brief passage in the preface describing one of Flanner's homes suggests that 
Wineapple can use concrete detail evocatively, but for the most part, people, 
places and incidents fail to come alive. Instead, the style is relentlessly 
expository. Apparently believing herself duty-bound to account for Flanner's 
whereabouts at all times, Wineapple, for instance, shuttles us back and forth, 
back and forth, back and forth across the Atlantic on nearly indistinguishable 
trips that leave us woozy with jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
Genet's lack of flair should not dissuade readers interested in 20th-Century 
literary and social history. Through her thorough research, Wineapple has 
documented the life and world of a writer whose journalistic style, urbane and 
ironic, remains an antidote to gonzo journalism and related disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the volume itself is appealing; the cover is attractively designed, 
using an antique endpaper; the text is printed in a handsome typeface on 
good-quality stock; a small array of photographs is well-selected. It should 
well please all biographiles.
