   BIOGRAPHY: Charles Taylor returned to Liberia from the United
States, where he worked as a factory mechanic, after Samuel Doe
took power in a 1980 military coup.
   Doe named Taylor head of the General Services Administration.
Taylor fled to the United States in 1983 to escape charges of
embezzlement.
   He was arrested in the United States but escaped before he could
be extradited.
   Taylor's revolt began Dec. 24, 1989, when he crossed the Ivory
Coast border into Liberia with a small band of men. They accused
Doe of corruption, mismanagement and human rights abuses. Taylor
based his men in Nimba County, an area hostile to Doe.
   Doe's forces responded with savage attacks on tribal groups that
supported Taylor. International agencies say hundreds were killed,
and the atrocities appeared to have increased support for Taylor.
   As a civilian, however, Taylor insists he is different from Doe,
who made his career in the military. He said he was leading ``a
grassroots civilian uprising to get rid of a dictator'' but
harbored no dictatorial ambitions himself.
