BIOGRAPHY 
</P>
<P>
A FIRST-CLASS TEMPERAMENT; The Emergence of Franklin Roosevelt by Geoffrey C. 
Ward (Harper &amp; Row) 
</P>
<P>
Meeting Franklin Delano Roosevelt shortly after his ascension to the Presidency 
in 1933, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes described him as "a second-class 
intellect. But a first-class temperament." This second volume of Ward's lively 
and psychologically revealing biography begins with his honeymoon abroad in 
1905 and concludes with his election as Governor of New York in 1928. Ward's 
portrait provides a balance to the well-known characterization of Roosevelt as 
a "gregarious, graceful and ebullient man." Here he is revealed also as a 
"consummate actor," a trait which, for all the damage it often wreaks, served 
him well in coping with the devastation of poliomyelitis.

THE IRON LADY; A Biography of Margaret Thatcher by Hugo Young (Farrar, Straus 
&amp; Giroux) 
</P>
<P>
The central riddle revealed here is why, as a woman in a man's world, Margaret 
Thatcher evinces such an exclusionary attitude toward women. The British Prime 
Minister's stance stems from her "barely tolerant" childhood view of her mother 
juxtaposed with the idolization of her father. From her father, Young argues, 
she inherited a "joyless earnestness" that combined with her early interest in 
science to produce the roots of her public character. "She did not ponder 
problems; she wanted solutions. . . . Political intellectuals interested her to 
the extent that they offered solutions." The author, whose career as a 
political columnist has coincided with Thatcher's as political leader, 
describes two qualities that are her greatest strengths: her "sense of moral 
rectitude" and her political intuition.

MEANS OF ASCENT; The Years of Lyndon Johnson by Robert A. Caro (Alfred A. 
Knopf) 
</P>
<P>
The Pulitizer Prize-winning author's second book in a projected four-volume 
work on the life of one of our most complex presidents. It is a dark and 
unrelenting portrayal of the way in which the humiliation of sudden poverty at 
age 13 led to Lyndon Johnson's quest for power at nearly any cost. More 
importantly, this painstakingly documented account also unflinchingly reveals 
the corrupt relationship between ends and means in American political life. The 
author, a former investigative journalist, was able to elicit untapped 
recollections from Johnson's old cronies. One of the most dramatic passages is 
an analysis of the mysterious 1948 senatorial contest that Johnson at his most 
desperate managed to win by the "87 votes that changed history."

SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR; A Biography by Deirdre Bair (Summit Books) 
</P>
<P>
Deirdre Bair commenced the research for this book with two questions: "How 
could that well-brought-up little Catholic girl have found the courage to 
become the fearless, free-spirited adult who gave as good as she got in the 
often vicious arena of Paris intellectualism? And as for 'The Second Sex,' from 
what place within her creative consciousness had that book come?" It took the 
author, recipient of the National Book Award for her biography of Samuel 
Beckett, seven years to answer these questions. The product is by turns 
literary biography, intellectual history, feminist theory and oral history.

THE FIVE OF HEARTS; An Intimate Portrait of Henry Adams and His Friends, 
1880-1918 by Patricia O'Toole (Clarkson N. Potter/Crown) 
</P>
<P>
An intimate, gossipy, yet graceful and well-researched social history of an 
elite group of influential Americans who first came together in Washington, 
D.C., in the winter of 1880-1881 as privileged bons vivants needing an 
appreciative outlet for their unconventional energies, ideas and wit. The 
social circle was composed of Henry Adams, historian and descendant of 
presidents; his wife, Clover; Secretary of State John Hay and his wife, Clara; 
Clarence King, geologist, leader of the great Fortieth Parallel survey. Often 
compared to the Bloomsbury group, the fivesome dubbed themselves "The Five of 
Hearts." Although intimates, they kept to themselves their most intriguing 
secrets (King, considered a bachelor, at his death was discovered to have left 
behind a black common-law wife and five children). Their "little White House" 
gatherings at the Lafayette Square home of the Adamses included Presidents from 
Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt, along with other such influential figures as 
Henry James, Edith Wharton, Mark Twain and Andrew Carnegie.

DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT; Culture and Technology in the Twentieth 
Century by O. B. Hardison Jr. (Viking) 
</P>
<P>
A startlingly original examination of change in modern culture and what it 
bodes for the future of human values. "Is the idea of what it is to be human 
disappearing, along with so many other ideas, through the modern skylight?" 
Hardison asks. He reviews the ways in which central concepts in five basic 
interrelated areas -- nature, history, language, art and human evolution -- "no 
longer seem to objectify a real world. It is as though progress were making the 
real world invisible." People who have made the transition across this "horizon 
of invisibility," he explains, put their experience not into familiar words and 
images but into symbols that cannot be understood by those who have not yet 
made the transition to modern culture -- thus, another "disappearance."

THE POLITICS OF RICH AND POOR; Wealth and the American Electorate in the Reagan 
Aftermath by Kevin Phillips (Random House) 
</P>
<P>
This highly readable book could serve as a wake-up button. Political analyst 
Kevin Phillips draws a convincing portrait of the new political economics as a 
deliberate quest to intensify oppression of the poor while fostering 
unprecedented growth of upper-bracket wealth. Directly related are the growth 
of federal debt, global economic realignment, foreigners devouring large chunks 
of American real estate, and "the meaninglessness of being a millionaire in an 
era with nearly a hundred thousand 'decamillionaires.' " His supporting data 
are as persuasive as his main point: that a Populist backlash in the 1990s is 
both needed and inevitable.

DISTURBING THE PEACE; A Conversation With Karel Hvizdala by Vaclav Havel 
translated by Paul Wilson (Alfred A. Knopf) 
</P>
<P>
"The history of this book has been marked by history itself," says the preface. 
Indeed. The "conversation" from exile that forms this book is actually a set of 
prescient answers to carefully wrought questions posed through underground mail 
to the rebel playwright three years before the startling events that would lead 
to Havel's election as president of Czechoslovakia. The changed context 
provides an ironic gift for the reader. On the eve of his 50th birthday, Havel 
remembers the political and literary battles of his youth, his involvement in 
the Prague Spring of 1968, what it is to be an artist under constant 
surveillance and harassment by the police, the years of imprisonment and his 
involvement in the civic struggle to bring moral responsibility back into his 
country's public life.

MY TRAITOR'S HEART; A South African Exile Returns to Face His Country, His 
Tribe, and His Conscience by Rian Malan (A Morgan Entrekin Book/ Atlantic 
Monthly Press) 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the white master tribe of South Africa, the author grew up 
thinking himself a "Just White Man." Then he took a job as a police reporter 
and the truth about the fear and violence in his homeland set in. He fled to 
America in 1977 and remained in exile for eight years, contemplating his 
country and his family, which included both white and black relatives linked by 
secret ties of blood. Finally, he decided to go back to seek the truth, which 
became the motivating force for this book: "I had always been two people, you 
see . . . A Just White Man appalled by the cruelties Afrikaners inflicted on 
Africans, and an Afrikaner appalled by the cruelties Africans inflicted on each 
other and might one day inflict on us. There were always these two paths open 
before me, these two forces tugging at my traitor's heart."

THE LONG GRAY LINE; The American Journey of West Point's Class of 1966 by Rick 
Atkinson (Houghton Mifflin) 
</P>
<P>
As tensions continue in the Middle East, we might all benefit from this 
splendid book by Pulitzer-Prize-winning journalist Rick Atkinson. "The Long 
Gray Line" is a long, poignant reminder of the sad cost of war. In haunting 
prose, Atkinson chronicles the pain and stoicism of the families, and 
especially the boys, of the West Point Class of 1966. And boys they were, 
teen-agers too young for the exercise of informed free will, yet sent on 
missions to Vietnam that many would later consider immoral. This story of West 
Point, where the "rage for order" transforms frightened boys into cadets "eager 
to fight," is a metaphor for the larger national, generational and political 
schism that left us all wiser.

<P>
AWASH IN A SEA OF FAITH; The Christianization of the American People, 1550-1865 
by Jon Butler (Harvard University Press) 
</P>
<P>
Despite what our cultural mythology has taught us, Puritanism in early America 
was not the single major force that shaped our religious values; instead, from 
the time Europeans began settling New England, American religious life was 
complex and eclectic. Yale professor Butler approaches his subject by 
emphasizing religious beliefs and practices, rather than the formal 
institutions and the elites who run them. As a result, we learn that what most 
early American believers had in common was their desire to begin anew and to 
create their own religion, which most often consisted of a quest for direct 
access to salvation and to the supernatural. 
</P>
<P>
A PEACE TO END ALL PEACE; Creating the Modern Middle East 1914-1922 by David 
Fromkin (Henry Holt) 
</P>
<P>
A panoramic view that attempts to explain the modern Middle East since the end 
of the Ottoman Empire, when the Allies divvied up the area without much regard 
for the religious sensibilities inseparable from nationhood in this part of the 
world. "The Middle East, as we know it from today's headlines, emerged from 
decisions made by the Allies during and after the First World War," Fromkin 
writes. Boundary lines for the new Middle East were arbitrarily drawn on "an 
empty map" without any input from the leaders of those countries themselves, 
says the author of this carefully researched book based on recently opened 
archival material.

 THE SEARCH FOR MODERN CHINA; by Jonathan D. Spence (W. W. Norton) 
</P>
<P>
A passionately told epic of China by Yale professor and historian Spence, 
author of eight other acclaimed works on China. His not-surprising contention 
is that in order to come to terms with China today we need to know about its 
past. The author's dilemma was where to begin in a recorded history that spans 
4,000 years. He decided on 1600 because from that point on there is a 
continuity in customs and practices, meaning that the presence of the past can 
be seen. A "modern" nation, according to Spence, is one that "is both 
integrated and receptive, fairly sure of its own identity yet able to join 
others on equal terms in the quest for new markets, new technologies, new 
ideas." Defined in this way, modern countries existed centuries ago; yet, he 
emphasizes, never has China been one of them.

THE QUEST FOR EL CID; by Richard Fletcher (Alfred A. Knopf) 
</P>
<P>
An illuminating tale of the life and times of Rodrigo Diaz, the 11th-Century 
Spanish aristocrat-soldier commonly known as El Cid. Spain's first great 
national hero emerges as a timeless character motivated by the quest for 
fortune, which he unabashedly sought by whatever bloody means were required. By 
the time of his death in 1099, he had become the independent ruler of a 
principality and the most famous man in Iberia, which accounts for his 
legendary presence in heroic tales to this day. In the masterful account of the 
old hero, Richard Fletcher has both clarified and verified previous research by 
others. 
</P>
<P>
ITALY AND ITS MONARCHY; by Denis Mack Smith (Yale University Press) 
</P>
<P>
A densely packed account of the inner workings of the Italian monarchy, which 
existed only from 1861 until 1946 (under the reign of only four kings), yet 
exerted considerable impact on Italian history -- much of it havoc-producing. 
Written by one of the world's leading historians of Italy, it "assesses the 
kings' influence on the slow and uneven progress of Italian parliamentary 
government, on an adventurous foreign policy that Italy could not afford, on 
the controversial decision to enter the two world wars, and on the 
authoritarian-nationalist experiment of fascism."

FICTION 
</P>
<P>
FRIEND OF MY YOUTH; by Alice Munro (Alfred A. Knopf) 
</P>
<P>
Powerful and haunting short stories. Munro's characters inhabit sparse Canadian 
landscapes; they are straightforward and refuse to feel sorry for themselves. 
Their wisdom is quietly ingested, their goodness revealed only through decent 
living. Yet the price they pay for their quiet dignity causes a catch in the 
reader's throat. Tragedy and mystery surround these characters who have no 
resources for the struggle against evil. As one of them says, "You either trust 
or you don't trust, in my opinion. When you decide you're going to trust, you 
have to start where you are." 
</P>
<P>
REACHING TIN RIVER; by Thea Astley (G. P. Putnam's Sons) 
</P>
<P>
Sprawling Australia is the setting for heroine Belle, a fortyish divorcee, the 
love-child of uncommitted 1960s parents, who passionately seeks the order and 
logic she discovered in Euclidean geometry. Belle's own life is shiftless until 
she chances upon a turn-of-the-century photograph of Gaden Lockyer, an obscure 
local dignitary with an interesting face and a shady past. She becomes obsessed 
with moving backward in time to Lockyer's native Tin River, where she 
occasionally sees his phantom image. In his diaries she finds mention of his 
inexplicable sighting of her -- or does she? So successful is this story of 
Belle's loosened grip on reality that we long for her fantasy ourselves and 
ache with loss when Belle's story ends. 
</P>
<P>
LANTERN SLIDES; by Edna O'Brien (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux) 
</P>
<P>
A superb new collection of stories that continue the theme of tragedy that 
intrigues Edna O'Brien. The book's epigraph by Thomas Mann -- "Each human life 
must work through all the joys and sorrows, gains and losses, which make up the 
history of the world" -- is a theme that reverberates throughout her stories. 
There isn't a human situation she shrinks from, whether it is the revulsion of 
a sister when her brother-lover takes a wife or the self-destruction of a woman 
obsessed with a married lover. The title story is the collection's masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
ORDINARY LOVE AND GOOD WILL; Two Novellas by Jane Smiley (Alfred A. Knopf) 
</P>
<P>
Two novellas that explore the hidden territory of marriage and the price that 
must be paid for the choices we make. In "Ordinary Love," 52-year-old Rachel 
Kinsella's current contentment with her life was gained at a cost to her 
children and herself that is only now being tallied 20 years after a brief 
mindless affair, the catalyst for the loss of her snug family. Until this 
summer's reunion with her children, Rachel had not understood what it was that 
made her commit the grand act of self-destruction -- or was it 
self-preservation? -- that cast her out. Now she sees that her husband's 
enthrallment with his family was actually the passion of an egomaniac. Perfect 
happiness, she concludes, "must be accompanied by the inevitable pain of 
knowing it cannot last."

<P>
BAOTOWN; by Wang Anyi translated by Martha Avery (W. W. Norton) 
</P>
<P>
This simple, powerful, engaging prose (translated from the Chinese) is the work 
of a young writer who at 16 was sent away from her family for eight years to a 
poverty-stricken northern province of China to fulfill the Cultural 
Revolutionary requirement of intellectuals. Wang Anyi transformed the 
experience into funny and warm stories of the completely human characters that 
make up the fictional "Baotown."

SONORAN DESERT SUMMER; by John Alcock illustrated by Marilyn Hoff Stewart (The 
University of Arizona Press) 
</P>
<P>
Scientific voyeur Alcock has devoted his professional life to the study of 
desert insect behavior. At the "little mountain" an hour's drive from Phoenix, 
he pursues his fascination with the miniature desert life that is the subject 
of his latest book. "Ironically," he writes, "it is the extreme hostility of 
the climate that is responsible for the exotic and intriguing nature of the 
desert's biology." 
</P>
<P>
GREEN RAGE; Radical Environmentalism and the Unmaking of Civilization by 
Christopher Manes (Little, Brown) 
</P>
<P>
With unabashed partisanship and a brash tone, law student and Earth First! 
member Christopher Manes communicates the roots, rationale and methods of 
radical environmentalism. Here is the story behind the daredevil defenders of 
nature who employ attention-grabbing -- and often illegal -- tactics such as 
driving spikes into trees in order to shatter loggers' saws. The premise, of 
course, is hard to argue with: The earth is in dire danger. The point of the 
movement -- and of this book -- seems to be that in any struggle, somebody must 
challenge the status quo by taking the extreme position. 
</P>
<P>
PATENTING THE SUN; Polio and the Salk Vaccine by Jane S. Smith (William Morrow) 
</P>
<P>
Mention the word "polio" and people born before 1950 will emotionally recall 
the summers of their youth when parents were too frightened to let children 
swim in public pools or attend movies. The worst epidemic in U.S. history 
occurred in 1952, when 60,000 new cases were reported. This intriguing social 
history of polio in the United States recounts the quest to develop the vaccine 
that in 1955 dramatically ended those anxious summers. 
</P>
<P>
DISCOVERING; by Robert Scott Root-Bernstein (Harvard University Press) 
</P>
<P>
A fictional approach to unveiling the discovery process. At a colloquium to 
debate the issues that lie at the core of scientific creativity, six characters 
ask themselves: Is there a structure to the process of discovering? Who 
discovers? What kinds of obstacles must discoverers overcome? And what can be 
done to foster discovery? Predictions are made: Great inventions and 
discoveries will take place in countries having expanding economies and which 
accommodate mavericks; mavericks will most likely be trained at new and 
peripheral institutions or will work in emerging fields.

<P>
THE CONTROL OF NATURE; by John McPhee (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux) 
</P>
<P>
Three long essays by one of America's finest nature writers defy our notion of 
natural order: It is not nature, even in its worst rages, that is out of 
control, but rather human beings who are out of control in their obsessive 
efforts to control nature. When a subject commands McPhee's attention, he 
engages fully in respectful observation. When he writes, he brings poetical 
description to the previously ordinary. Especially compelling for the Southern 
Californian is McPhee's essay on Los Angeles' debris flows: "The house became 
buried to the eaves. Boulders sat on the roof. Thirteen automobiles were packed 
around the building, including five in the pool. . . . The stuck horn of a 
buried car was blaring. The family in the darkness in their fixed tableau 
watched one another by the light of a directional signal endlessly blinking."

POETRY 
</P>
<P>
WHAT LIGHT THERE IS; And Other Poems .by Eamon Grennan (North Point Press) 
</P>
<P>
Light in these lyrical, meditative poems illuminates the classical themes of 
poetry -- nature, family, love and the contentedness of an uncluttered life. 
These themes act as a counterpoint to anxiety, the knowledge of how "our lives 
hang on balances too delicate to ponder for long." Moments of satisfaction 
come, as in the poem, "Accidents," when "I'm all at once all there" or in 
"Fall," when "On a still morning the shallow pond / Is full of kissing: little 
narcissi . . . " 
</P>
<P>
THE COLOR OF MESABI BONES; by John Caddy (Milkweed Editions) 
</P>
<P>
A searing collection of poems and prose poems that describe surviving a 
childhood of violence. Often framed in the third person, their impact is the 
more powerful for showing us the effects rather than the perpetration of 
violence: "The boy is dreaming in the dark / a metronomic sound that punctuates 
the night with glares of sullen red / It is, slow and strong / the sound of one 
hand slapping some boundary of meat." These are poems that attempt to reach 
back decades to assuage the pain now and to understand: "The doctor slides the 
X-rays from manila. . . . An X-ray syndrome . . . shaken child . . . we can't 
be sure of course." 
</P>
<P>
GRACE NOTES; by Rita Dove (W. W. Norton) 
</P>
<P>
This fourth collection of poetry by the winner of the 1987 Pulitzer Prize in 
poetry is inspired by events in Dove's childhood. Her images are captivating: 
"ant-freckled stones" and "exhausted wives hovering over bins of frozen pork." 
Her poetry is full of lines that can be held and turned over and over like a 
smooth, comforting stone: "If you can't be free, be a mystery" or "Here's a 
riddle for Our Age: When the sky's the limit, how can you tell you've gone too 
far?" or "The Island Women move through Paris / as if they had just finished 
inventing their destinations . . . better not look an island woman in the eye 
-- unless you like feeling unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
GOING BACK TO THE RIVER; by Marilyn Hacker (Vintage) 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Hacker has been the recipient of the National Book Award. Her rhyming 
poetry, which springs from her feminist sensibilities, is playful, 
wisecracking, erotic and devoid of pretense. These compelling poems are about 
love, loss and relationships, in which she combines openness and technical 
mastery of conventional poetic forms. 
</P>
<P>
LEAVING ANOTHER KINGDOM; by Gerald Stern (Harper &amp; Row) 
</P>
<P>
A large collection that spans 15 years, with allusions to philosophers, artists 
and other poets. "Another Insane Devotion" is one of the most moving poems in 
the collection: "Thirty-five years ago I ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms 
/ we were dying together / we never met again / although she was pregnant when 
I left her -- I have a daughter or son somewhere / darling grandchildren in 
Norwich, Connecticut, or Canton, Ohio."
