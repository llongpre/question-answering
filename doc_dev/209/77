ALAN PATON: A BIOGRAPHY by Peter F Alexander Oxford Pounds 25, 510 pages
In September 1946 a middle-aged Borstal headmaster from South Africa was in
Norway on a study tour. He visited Trondheim Cathedral, went back to his
hotel and, homesick, began to write: 'There is a lovely road that runs from
Ixopo into the hills. These hills are grass-covered and rolling, and they
are lovely beyond any singing of it . . .'
He was Alan Paton and he would take just three months to complete Cry, the
Beloved Country, the novel which changed his life and, just conceivably,
altered the world's perception of South Africa.
It is - what? One of the finest novels of the century? Surely not. One of
the most moving? Yes. One of the most memorable, powerful, effective,
influential? Certainly. And what were Alan Paton's other achievements?
Peter Alexander has written an excellent biography of an interesting and
important man who died, in 1988, just a few years before the coming of the
democratic and non-racial society for which he had fought and written. The
story is told steadily (57 pages to get to varsity sex), respectfully, warts
and all, and the judgment is well-considered and balanced. Mr Alexander
liked and admired Paton, and owed him favours, but this is no hagiography.
To get the warts out of the way, Paton had an unpromising Christadelphian
background, hated his authoritarian father, had a sad, sexually unhappy
marriage with an older woman, became in turn a bad parent, was feared and
detested by his pupils when a schoolmaster, was a flogger of sadistic
dimensions, and may even have drunk too much. All this for a man whose
international image has for years been that of a Christian writer-hero
defying the apartheid government to do its worst.
It is a compliment to Alexander that, in Cromwellian style, the portrait
proceeds from there. Paton was shaped by his childhood in Maritzburg; he
carried from it a passion for the African landscape, an instinct to fight
authority, a Christian faith which he was able to adapt to the less
puritanical Anglican Church, and which gave him the biblical cadences of his
distinctive prose style.
His idealism led him from schoolteaching (the pupils cheered when he almost
lost his sight in an accident) to the desperate job of rescuing the black
reformatory at Diepkloof, a terrible institution when he arrived in 1935,
and which was to give him 13 happy and inspired years as he learned about
his country and discovered the necessity to build bridges across the colour
line.
After the instant, worldwide success of Cry, the Beloved Country he left
government service and set out to write (he found it depressingly difficult
to produce a second book) and then to move into politics. The story of the
founding of the South African Liberal Party is not new but is told well,
including Paton's anguish when the multi-racialism and non-violence of the
Party came under pressure from within. There seems to have been happiness in
the later years in the Valley of a Thousand Hills when he married a
formidable second wife who became notorious among politicians and
journalists for the rigour with which she guarded him.
He did not write all that many books, partly because he gave so much of his
time to politics, which included his journalism. There were only two other
novels - Too Late the Phalarope (1953), which was probably overpraised when
it appeared, and the rather odd Ah, But Your Land Is Beautiful (1981). There
were some short stories and two biographies - of his friend, the flawed
statesman Jan Hofmeyr, and his Archbishop, Geoffrey Clayton - neither of
which, we can now see, cut to the bone with the instinct of the natural
biographer. The two-volume autobiography had its areas of discretion.
Alexander is enthusiastic about a slim volume of Christian meditation,
Instrument Of Thy Peace (1967), which apparently was his second most popular
book (and which reviewers like this one have never read])
Paton, in public, always looked like a Methodist lay preacher, and this
biography does not contradict that aspect of him: it is true that he was a
fine orator. There remains a touch of mystery in the transformation of a
small-town schoolmaster with a cane in his hand to an
internationally-celebrated figurehead of liberalism.
Alexander does not go out of his way to deny that Paton wrote only one
'great' book. I suggest that he understates the sheer courage of the man in
the face of constant harassment and vilification. He correctly concludes
that, never mind the mean quibbling of the ANC and Black Consciousness,
Paton's Liberalism kept alive for South Africa certain values in a time of
great darkness; Paton then had the courage to close down the Party when it
could not continue with integrity.
Alexander has a nice final quote, supplied by Paton himself, from a certain
Sir Robert Shirley, whose encomium was that he 'did the best of things in
the worst of times, and hoped them in the most calamitous'. He kept the
faith. Woza Alan]
