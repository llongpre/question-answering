LETTERS FROM MENABILLY
by Oriel Malet

DAPHNE du Maurier, who always valued her privacy, was virtually a recluse
towards the end of her life. Instead of an autobiography, she wrote an
account of her youth, ending with her marriage in 1932, which concentrated
on her development as a writer. Margaret Forster's biography can be said to
concentrate on the emotional crises behind that development: her
relationship with her father, the famous actor-manager Sir Gerald du
Maurier; her passionate friendship with a teacher at her Parisian finishing
school; her pre-marital affair with Carol Reed; the highs and lows of her
long marriage; the births of her three children; her 'crush' on Ellen
Doubleday, the wife of her American publisher; and a brief fling with
Gertrude Lawrence.
In a working life spanning over 50 years, Daphne du Maurier published some
25 volumes of novels and stories and 10 works of non-fiction and biography.
Her sales were quite phenomenal: even with wartime paper rationing, she
commanded print runs of 50,000 and 100,000. Film versions of her early
novels and later of her stories, The Birds and Don't Look Now, brought her
name to a wider audience and boosted an already-considerable income.
To the young Daphne du Maurier, the idea of deliberately writing for a
particular 'market' would have been anathema. When writing Jamaica Inn,
Rebecca, Frenchman's Creek and My Cousin Rachel, she was driven by the same
'hidden prompter' (vide Saul Bellow) as weightier and more ambitious
novelists. She was a natural, one of those who turn into a neurotic wreck if
not writing and whose lives are therefore dominated by the need to fulfil
this urge.
Given her highly-respectable old age (she was made a Dame of the British
Empire in 1969), it is easy to forget that as a young woman Daphne du
Maurier had a raffish reputation. Her father may have been a knight but he
was still 'a theatrical' and therefore not quite top-drawer. She herself
recounts (but Forster does not) how she shocked the people of Fowey in the
late 1920s by walking around the town not only hatless but in shorts. Her
first lover, the young film director Carol Reed, the illegitimate son of
Herbert Beerbohm Tree, would have made a good match. Instead, she married a
handsome martinet who had already fought in the First World War and ended
the Second as Major-General Sir Frederick Browning.
There have long been rumours about the unhappiness of this marriage, citing
Browning's philandering and later his drinking. The biography reveals that
sexual relations (known as 'Cairo' in du Maurier code as opposed to lesbian
ones, which were 'Venice') were never resumed after the war - more from
inertia and shyness than anything else. Sir Frederick's work as Royal
Equerry kept him in London all week and his demeanour at Menabilly on
weekends earned him the nickname Moper. Because of her writing - now their
main source of income - and her love of the seclusion offered by her Cornish
home, Lady Browning could seldom be tempted to London, so it is not
surprising that things fell apart. But, with typical loyalty, she forgave
him his peccadilloes and nursed him to the end.
Menabilly was the biggest folly in her life, a dark and dilapidated house
which she acquired in 1943 on a two-year lease and into which she poured
money - Pounds 30,000 on the roof alone - as if she owned it. She refers to
it as 'my rat-ridden ruin', and the myth of a Rebecca-like life of elegant
luxury is shattered. She was oblivious to domestic chaos, never bothered
with central heating, and when she finally moved to the dower house at
Kilmarth in 1969 she was amazed by its warm, sunny rooms.
Ms Forster's revelation that Daphne enjoyed 'Venice' with Gertrude Lawrence
 -if only during one care-free weekend in Florida - and fell in love with
Ellen Doubleday, will not surprise those who have always thought of her as
first and foremost a writer with a cavalier attitude to domestic duties and
motherhood.
A far livelier, if less comprehensive, portrait of the writer can be found
in Letters from Menabilly, written to her friend, the novelist Oriel Malet,
who adds her own commentary (to be published in May). They are full of
irritating Du Maurier slang and half-baked philosophy but there is nothing
in the 'official' biography to match these vivid and sometimes irreverent
pictures of her curious existence at Menabilly and Kilmarth. 'Do tell me,'
she asked Oriel Malet wistfully in her dotage, 'did I write Gone With The
Wind, or was it someone else?'
Margaret Forster is reluctant to take Daphne du Maurier seriously as a
writer; if she has any opinions about the quality of the work, she keeps
them to herself. I suspect that she is not a fan. She is certainly wary of
making judgments and seems to consider that the fiction is adequately dealt
with by old-fashioned psychological readings. Knowing that Rebecca was
sparked off by Daphne's jealousy of her husband's previous fiancee does not
help us to understand the novel's extraordinary and enduring appeal.
Not only has Margaret Forster produced a strangely muted portrait of a
particularly colourful character, she makes no suggestions as to how and why
the best of these books became and remain so popular. Daphne du Maurier's
diction is alternately clumsy and wooden; she has no ear for dialogue, an
erratic sense of history and a weakness for stereotypes. Yet, in her best
work, the superb story-telling, her dramatic use of nature, her strong sense
of place and her ability to evoke evil, put her in a Romantic tradition that
goes back to the Brontes. It is surely the business of a major biography to
address these contradictions and place the work of its subject in an
appropriate cultural context.
