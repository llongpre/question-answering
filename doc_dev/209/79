JOHN STEINBECK: A BIOGRAPHY
by Jay Parini
Heinemann, Pounds 20, 614 pages
Is it still true, as I suppose, that most people love reading John Steinbeck
in their teens, yet only rarely return to him in their maturity? Was his
friend John Hersey right when, explaining Steinbeck's astronomical sales, he
said, 'Readers loved him. Even people who really did read books read
Steinbeck'? Has persistent denigration by academic critics denied him his
proper reputation notwithstanding his Nobel Prize?
The virtue of this long but readable book is that Jay Parini, by achieving
an excellent balance between biography and literary appreciation - always a
difficult task - makes a strong case for the quality of Steinbeck's work in
the course of a well-told life story.
He establishes the structure with confident authority: the family homes in
Salinas and Monterey; the unsatisfactory parents who nevertheless supported
their son while he mastered his trade; the failure at Stanford; the early
experience on the road, as labourer, rancher, sailor, solitary; the three
wives, the alcohol and the depressions; the unfailing conviction of his
vocation as writer; and then the breakthrough to worldwide success with
Tortilla Flat, followed by Of Mice and Men and, in 1939,The Grapes of Wrath.
Parini then moves deeper. He understands that the fame of The Grapes of
Wrath - one of the great 'angry books', the instant classic which describes
so unforgettably the plight of the Okies fleeing from the Dust Bowl - can
mislead us about Steinbeck's true gifts. The 1930s may have been the period
when the American novel went political but Steinbeck, an instinctive New
Deal Democrat rather than a radical sophisticate, always knew that realism
was, in his words, 'a dead end for the novel'.
His own ambitions lay more in the myth-making function of the artist. He had
a life-long obsession with the Arthurian legend (which is clear in Tortilla
Flat and Cannery Row) and, arising out of his scientific bent, he held
well-developed theories about the relationship between the individual and
the larger social unit which he called the 'phalanx'.
'Man is a double thing,' he once wrote, 'a group animal and at the same time
an individual. And it occurs to me that he cannot successfully be the second
until he has fulfilled the first.' That is rather a good way of
understanding The Grapes of Wrath.
As Parini points out, this philosophy is not so far from Jung's Collective
Unconscious, and it is particularly interesting to find that one of
Steinbeck's close friends in pre-war Monterey was Joseph Campbell, later to
become America's most influential mythologist. (This California group of
'whores, scientists, bums, winos and local artists' included Steinbeck's
best friend, the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, George Albee and John Cage,
as well as Campbell, who had an affair with Carol Steinbeck which may have
contributed to the eventual divorce.)
Out of all this detail, Parini focuses on his argument: 'Like Joyce and
Eliot and any number of other writers, Steinbeck used myth to organise his
ideas and ground his work in archetypal patterns. The important point is
that Steinbeck summoned a reality that was fresh and highly particularised,
always trying to examine 'the group' and its effects on the individual.'
There is a lovely line from Steinbeck's diary as he was writing Grapes -
'Carol says, stay with the detail'.
After earning a mere Dollars 870 in his first seven years, Steinbeck took
off. The critics soon decided that he had peaked already, but the public
disagreed. There were to be films and plays and travel books and journalism,
as well as more novels.
Parini takes us smoothly through the fame and the fortune, the years as war
correspondent, the move to New York, the bad second marriage and failure as
a father, divorce and more drink and crisis, a happy third marriage, East of
Eden and the screenplay of Viva Zapata].
Steinbeck wrote a book a year between 1931 and 1950 and was only defeated by
his attempt on his beloved Malory, for which he moved to Glastonbury.
These later years are told at a fast lick, but it would be churlish to
complain. The argument of the book is not simply that Steinbeck is unfairly
under-esteemed but that it is wrong of the critics to declare that his work
declined after the famous bestsellers.
Does Parini make his case?
I suspect that he protests too much. But in order to be sure, I'll have to
go back to the books - which is a good test of a good biography.
