THE APPEARANCE of Beckett's first novel, Dream of Fair to middling Women,
has been welcomed by Beckett scholars. There was a ripple of excitement when
the actor Barry McGovern read extracts from it last week at its launch in
The Dublin Writers' Museum.
It is published in Ireland with a print run of 8,000 by The Black Cat Press,
a small Dublin-based company, founded by a cardiologist and Beckett-expert,
Eoin O'Brien, who is also the novel's co-editor. Eoin O'Brien is best known
in literary circles for The Beckett Country, a collection of photographs and
texts illustrating the Irish origins of Beckett's work.
He was chosen as co-editor of the novel by Beckett's literary executor,
Jerome Lindon, and worked closely with Edith Fournier, a lifelong friend of
Beckett and sometimes his translator. Beckett had strong misgivings about
all his early, pre-war works. O'Brien says that the decision to publish
Dream of Fair to middling Women was not taken lightly, but its appearance
today 'is at Samuel Beckett's own behest, expressed to me in talks on the
subject between 1975 and 1989.' Samuel Beckett died in late 1989.
Beckett's English language publisher, John Calder, licensed this one
hardcover edition to The Black Cat Press, chiefly so that the editor could,
says Calder, 'bring out a very special edition according to his own
specifications.' Calder will be distributing the book for Black Cat in the
UK.
The 'special edition' is at first glance a rather plain 241-page hardback in
a dark green jacket; its specialness lies in the quality of its typesetting
and proof-reading, both formidable tasks as Beckett uses idiosyncrasies of
punctuation and spacing and writes in at least seven known languages; he
also coins neologisms at a rate exceeded only by James Joyce in Finnegans
Wake. 'Verbal exuberance' is a recurring phrase in critical assessments of
the work.
In fact, the non-specialist dipping into Dream could quite easily suspect
that it is an undiscovered work by Joyce. And yet, while it is undoubtedly
under his influence, the 26-year-old Beckett often prefigures the mature
writer: 'Doubt, Despair and Scrounging, shall I hitch my bath chair to the
greatest of these?' Lines from the poetry fly by; Belacqua is the main
character, as in More Pricks than Kicks, and the location is Beckett's
Dublin. At times it reads like the footnotes from Watt.
And these are more than echoes. Beckett called this useful outpuring 'the
chest into which I threw my wild thoughts,' a chest which he later
plundered, seeing no immediate prospect of the novel as it stood gaining
publication. Some of the stories from Dream were assembled with others and
published as More Pricks than Kicks. O'Brien claims that it also served as a
starting point for later works such as Happy Days and Krapp's Last Tape.
Eoin O'Brien believes that the book will have an appeal beyond the coterie
of specialists, pointing to Dream's 'youthful zest,' which he hopes will
attract younger readers. John Calder sees it as a clever student
showing-off, great fun to read, and very much a young man's book. Some of it
is very funny, some of it is quite rude. It is a book without much in the
way of restraint, whereas later on he became very restrained.
James Knowlson, Director of the Beckett International Foundation at Reading
University, and Beckett's official biographer, is among those who welcome
the publication of this early work, while admitting that it is uneven: 'Very
brilliant in parts, and not so good in other parts.'
Like many first novels, even the great master's is to some extent
autobiographical, with thinly disguised portraits of friends and
acquaintances. Knowlson thinks that he can identify most of them; all will
be revealed in two years' time when the biography appears. Meanwhile stand
by for a barrage of speculation and learned commentary when Dream of Fair to
middling Women becomes available in the UK later this month (about November
10, price Pounds 18.99).
