<TEXT>
   Ten years ago, warriors of the Krahn
tribe led a bloody campaign of revenge against Liberians descended
from American slaves, who had ruled the country since it was
founded in 1847.
   Now the Krahn, and their allies of the Mandingo tribe, are
themselves being hunted in a tribal war waged without mercy.
   Members of the Krahn tribe kill people of other tribes, and the
others kill Krahn, solely because of tribal allegiances.
   Descendants of the freed slaves brought here early in the 19th
century by American civil rights groups are known as
American-Liberians. Their forbears organized the True Whig Party,
which ruled without interruption, and American-Liberians were
widely accused of brutalizing the native inhabitants.
   A revolution in 1980 led by Samuel Doe brought an end to their
rule.
   President William Tolbert was killed in his executive mansion on
April 12, 1980. A week later, 13 of Tolbert's ministers and heads
of government corporations were executed in public, tied to stakes
on the Atlantic beach near the mansion.
   The coup and subsequent executions were the work of Doe and 16
other non-commissioned officers from the Krahn homeland, Grand
Gedeh County, in the distant eastern interior. Many were illiterate
and had never been in touch with civilized life.
   Liberia's new rulers appeared to have no sense of money, and the
result was economic disaster.
   American-Liberians kept a low profile. Their standard of living
often dropped to the level of their tribal compatriots.
   Since they had no tribe of their own, they became known
collectively as the Congo tribe. Congo was a popular term at the
time of the U.N. operation to save the former Belgian Congo, now
Zaire, from chaos.
   A part of Monrovia is known today as Congo Town, after the
American-Liberians who settled there.
   After Doe's coup, the Krahn were the masters. The Masonic temple
that dominated Monrovia, once the place where the major decisions
were made, became a ransacked shell.
   The national motto, ``The Love of Freedom Brought Us Here,'' was
an insult to native tribes, but none of the Krahn in authority
thought to change it.
   Doe ran the country like a private estate. The army commander,
Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, attempted a coup in 1985 and was
killed.
   Popular dissatisfaction with Doe's rule grew and, in 1989,
tribes that had suffered under the Krahn-Mandingo oppression
rebeled.
   Most American-Liberians remained on the sidelines, but one of
them, Charles Taylor, sought to lead the rebellion.
   Taylor and his lieutenant, Prince Johnson, had spent four years
in Libya being trained in military tactics and indoctrinated in the
``green book'' ideology of Moammar Gadhafi. Libya still is Taylor's
main arms supplier.
   Most of Taylor's followers are from aboriginal tribes and he has
tried to shake off his Congo tribe background.
   Johnson, of the Gio tribe, broke with Taylor after an argument
over the execution of several rebels Johnson accused of desertion.
Johnson had the deserters shot and Taylor has been his sworn enemy
ever since.
   Generally, unlike Taylor, Johnson has tried to humanize the
conflict. He distributed food to civilians, ordered men of his
executed for looting and insisted he was fighting only to remove
Doe from power.
   ``As soon as this war is over, I and my men are returning to
barracks,'' he says repeatedly. Civilians tend to believe him.
   Taylor has fought with the same brutality as Doe. Unlike the
other two contestants, he refused to have anything to do with a
peace force of West African states, and said he would fight the
peacekeepers if they arrived.
   Then Johnson and Doe concluded a truce, to unite against Taylor,
laying the foundation for an even longer civil war.
   The five-nation West African force arrived Friday night, was
welcomed by Prince Johnson and, according to the Ghana news agency,
repulsed an attack on Saturday by rebels loyal to Taylor.
   Countless atrocities have been reported in the many months of
fighting, many of them attributed to Doe's Krahn warriors. Up to
400 people were killed Aug. 5 in a night attack on Gio refugees
sheltering in St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Monrovia.
   U.S. Marines were sent to protect the U.S. Embassy, but were
instructed to stay out of the general conflict.
   To many Liberians, however, the United States is their only hope
of rescue from destruction. They look to America as their country's
founder.
   ``America is my fatherland,'' said Johnson, whose personal
experience of the United States is minimal. ``We expect the
Americans to come to our help as the French came to the help of
Gabon, or the British to the help of Uganda.''
