   Fighters loyal to rebel leader Charles
Taylor advanced to within firing distance of the presidential
mansion Wednesday, filling a vacuum left by a rival group's
execution of President Samuel Doe.
   The British Broadcasting Corp., quoting exiled Liberians in the
United States, said Taylor had executed some opponents, among them
prominent politician Jackson Doe.
   Doe, no relation to the late president, was the 1985
presidential candidate of the Liberian Action Party. Many observers
said he was robbed of victory by election officials appointed by
Samuel Doe, who took power in a 1980 coup.
   Taylor's force, mainly untrained youths, had been bogged down by
Samuel Doe's men for nearly three months on Monrovia's eastern
outskirts.
   But Doe died Monday after being captured by rebels under Prince
Yealu Johnson, and his loyalists fled in disarray, offering an
opening for Taylor. Columns of smoke rose as Taylor's rebels
advanced through eastern suburbs behind a barrage of shell, rocket
and gunfire. They moved past the Spriggs Payne Airfield and John F.
Kennedy Hospital to City Hall, a few hundred yards from the
executive mansion.
   About 230 relatives and remnants of Samuel Doe's army were
trapped inside the hilltop, seven-story mansion.
   Prince Johnson _ who earlier in the week had been hunting down
Doe loyalists around the city _ agreed Wednesday to allow the late
president's followers to leave Monrovia if they surrender their
arms.
   Johnson made the offer in response to a request by the chairman
of the Economic Community of West African States, Gambian President
Sir Dawda Jawara, who ordered a West African task force to save
Doe's supporters.
   A long convoy of vehicles from the 3,000-strong West African
peacekeeping force in Monrovia was approaching the mansion late
Wednesday to offer safe conduct in a convoy escorted by two tanks
and a small group of Johnson's men.
   A spokesman for the West Africans said no decision has been
reached about where the Doe supporters would go.
   Taylor started the war when he invaded Liberia from Ivory Coast
on Dec. 24. Johnson was one of Taylor's commanders, but quarreled
with him in March and formed a splinter group.
   The three warring factions have slaughtered more than 5,000 of
Liberia's 2.3 million people, often because of their tribal
affiliations. About 500,000 people have fled their homes.
   Doe was a Krahn, one of 14 small tribes in Liberia. Johnson is
the son of a Gio, and Taylor is of mixed Americo-Liberian and
native ancestry.
