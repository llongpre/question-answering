Upchurch-Brown Booksellers in Laguna Beach, which regularly hosts book signings 
and other literary events, has embarked on its most ambitious project yet. 
</P>
<P>
Co-owners Mary Upchurch and Robert Brown have teamed with Laguna restaurateur 
Jules Swimmer to create Laguna Mysteries Inc., a mystery dinner theater in 
which the audience will literally take to the streets in the course of 
attempting to find out who-done-it. 
</P>
<P>
The first play in the audience-participation series, which will be presented on 
the last Saturday of each month, is "The Laguna Baron," written by Los Angeles 
playwright Julio Martinez. The debut performance on April 29 is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
As scripted, the mystery begins at the bookstore with an "author signing 
party." To search for clues, guests move on to several Laguna locations, 
stopping at Swimmer's Le Petit Gourmet Cafe for dinner. After dinner, it's back 
to the bookstore for the resolution of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The play's 6-member cast is from the Comedy Company of Newport Beach. Despite 
the acting company's name, Brown emphasizes that the play is not a comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it's set in 1989, it's more a 1930s-style mystery, and we use Laguna 
landmarks, history and architecture," he said. "It's a Laguna experience." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $48 per person and each performance, which lasts about 2 1/2 hours, 
is limited to 40 people. For reservations and information, call (714) 497-9742.
