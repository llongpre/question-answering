<HEAD>Barbara Bush Says Biographies on Her Won't be `Page-Turners'</HEAD>

   Barbara Bush said Friday she's looking for a good
book to read but it won't be a gossipy new biography about former
first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.
   ``I'm not going to read that,'' the first lady said. ``It's not
a nice book.''
   Commenting on two books being written about her now, Mrs. Bush
said, ``Trust me, they're not going to be page-turners unless
they're fiction.''
   Accompanying President Bush to Rome, the first stop on a
four-nation European tour, Mrs. Bush chatted with reporters on Air
Force One for about 20 minutes during the nine-hour flight across
the Atlantic.
   For the trip, she changed from a black and white dress she wore
to a departure ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base to tan slacks and
a turquoise knit top and red loafers.
   Despite a thyroid ailment that has irritated her eyes and caused
a weight loss, Mrs. Bush said she felt wonderful and was swimming
and playing tennis daily. She said she expected to continue her
exercise regimen during her week in Europe.
   The discussion of books arose when she said she had brought
something to read but wasn't satisfied with it. ``I need a good
book,'' she said, quickly exhorting reporters not to invite the
public to deluge her with suggestions.
   Mrs. Bush said she was cooperating with the authors of two books
about her, but that the books were not officially authorized.
   ``Well, I can hardly wait to read them,'' she said. ``They'll be
a lot more interesting than my life.''
   Mrs. Bush said the idea of writing a book about her now is ``so
silly. I'm not done yet. I don't know what I want to be when I grow
up.''
   The first lady also disclosed she will host a White House
luncheon on June 5 for Senate wives, and that it will be attended
by former first ladies Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson, two former
presidents of the Senate wives' club.
   She showed off an engraved watch given to her last year by the
wives' club. She said she loves it.
