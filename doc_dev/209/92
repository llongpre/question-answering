   In 1955, American author and critic James Agee died in New York.

   In 1975, Japanese climber Junko Tabei became the first woman to
reach the summit of Mount Everest.
   In 1977, five people were killed when a New York Airways

toppled over, sending a huge rotor blade flying.
   Ten years ago: King Hussein of Jordan announced he would marry
Elizabeth Halaby, an American architect. (They were wed the

   Five years ago: The Lebanese Parliament and the Israeli Knesset

of foreign troops, including Israeli forces, from Lebanon. (The
agreement was signed the following day.)
   One year ago: Kentucky Derby winner ``Alysheba'' captured the
Preakness Stakes in Baltimore. (However, Alysheba fell short in the
Belmont Stakes the following month, failing to become the first
Triple Crown champion since ``Affirmed'' in 1978.)

manager Billy Martin is 60. Sen. Lowell Weicker (Republican,
Connecticut) is 57. Singer-actress Lainie Kazan is 48. Actress
