   As he labored on the life of George Bernard
Shaw, Michael Holroyd had an advantage not available to earlier
biographers: He had no help from Shaw.
   ``What I discovered was that the major biographies of him _
certainly Archibald Henderson's, Frank Harris' _ had actually been
written to a considerable extent by Shaw himself in the third
person,'' Holroyd said. ``He had ghosted his own life.
   ``Indeed, it is possible to say that some of the more severe
passages are actually written by Shaw.''
   Holroyd has just completed ``Bernard Shaw: The Search for Love''
(Random House, $24.95), which takes Shaw from childhood in Dublin
to his early years in London, his first romantic affair with a
friend of his mother and his marriage to Charlotte Payne-Townshend
in 1898.
   Two more volumes are to follow next year and in 1991.
   The amount of material to cover was enormous. Shaw was a
novelist; a music critic; a playwright whose works included
``Pygmalion,'' ``Man and Superman'' and ``St. Joan''; a Fabian
socialist, a militant vegetarian, a reformer of spelling and a
tireless writer of letters.
   At the end of a 50-page letter he once wrote, ``Forgive this
long letter. I didn't have time to write a short one.''
   It has been 13 years since Holroyd began the project, which was
initiated by Shaw's residual legatees: the British Museum, the
Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the National Gallery of Ireland.
   Holroyd, a 53-year-old Londoner who is married to the novelist
Margaret Drabble, did not go to college. He says the subjects of
his biographies _ Lytton Strachey in 1968, Augustus John in 1974
and now Shaw _ have been his professors.
   Since the last major biographies were published in 1956, the
centenary of the great man's birth, many letters, diaries and
manuscripts have come to light, Holroyd said.
   So rather than having old GBS' recollections of himself at age
20, as earlier biographers had, Holroyd said he had access to
letters Shaw wrote at the time.
   ``What Shaw wanted from biography was an endorsement for his
political opinions. He didn't want to seem freakish, eccentric,
odd, with an illegitimate background which might make his socialism
merely a tributary or an eccentric growth or, itself,
illegitimate,'' the British writer said on a recent visit to New
York.
   Illegitimacy was a gnawing issue in Shaw's childhood in Dublin.
His father, George Carr Shaw, was a drunken ne'er-do-well; the
family household was run by George Vandeleur Lee, a voice teacher
and choral conductor who had befriended Shaw's mother. The menage
was doubly scandalous because Lee was a Roman Catholic while the
Shaws were Protestants.
   Shaw grew up unloved by father or mother, a circumstance he
later said admirably equipped him for the world.
   ``He himself said he had the choice to make a tragedy of them or
a comedy. He made a comedy; people laughed, but they didn't
understand always that Shaw's ideas came in the form of jokes. And
then you have to unravel the joke to find the serious content,''
Holroyd said.
   ``My theory was that he orphaned himself from his parents and
made himself the child of his writings. He believed that he
inherited from his parents qualities that were so incompatible as
to drive them to live in different countries, and that his quest in
life was to find some reconciliation for those opposites that he
had inherited.
   ``I believe that the great debates in his plays are the
negotiations for that peace treaty in himself, as it were.''
   Holroyd began the Shaw project by immersing himself in the
subject's works.
   ``It took me, I would say, at least two years to break the code
of his language, of his jokes, to understand, to attune myself.
After 18 months, I was in some despair about this: Would I, could
I, tune in to him? Or he to me?''
   The research is now mostly done, Holroyd said, and he's relieved
to be in contact with readers once again. If he attempts another
biography after this, he said, he would prefer someone who didn't
live so long _ Shaw was 94 at his death.
   ``There have been times when I would have been tempted to kill
him off at the age of say 75 _ a very reasonable age _ rather than
go on to his mid-90s,'' Holroyd said.
   ``I've been tempted to think that when he went to Russia in 1931
I could, when I come to that point, suggest that the Russians
substituted a replica Shaw, filled this replica Shaw with a great
deal of Soviet propaganda which I needn't bother about, because
it's not the real Shaw.
   ``I could stop my narrative then, on his 75th birthday, which he
celebrated, I think, in Moscow, and just add an appendix which
would appeal to John le Carre fans _ and get me extra sales.''
