<LEADPARA>  I FIRST read Samuel Eliot Morison's; biography of Christopher Columbus when I
was 14. I thought it was one of the best books of adventure I'd ever read,
right up there with "The Odyssey" and Conrad's novels of the sea.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But Columbus is a troubling figure. Clearly heroic, he accomplished a great
deed in the face of difficulty, and his achievement changed the world. But
though he surely did what he did, he didn't know he was doing it, and that
somewhat darkens the image. And while he did change the world, the question --
still a hot topic of debate after 500 years is whether he changed it for the
better.;   Here in the United States, we sometimes act as if Columbus had been
Citizen No. 1. But in Latin America, nearly two dozen former Spanish colonies
still struggle to get over the influence of a nation that acted more like a
wicked stepmother than a mother country. Columbus is no hero there.;  
Certainly one accepted truth needs debunking. Columbus "discovered" nothing,
and to say otherwise dismisses the accomplishments, the dignity, even the
humanity of the millions of people who lived in the Americas long before
Columbus stepped ashore, most of whom were doomed to death within a
generation. Columbus, it's worth remembering, saw American blood within hours
of landing.;   The 1992 quincentenary of Columbus's arrival gives us an
opportunity to re-evaluate both past and present and to look closely at the
Old World, the other Old World of the Americas, and at the consequences of
that momentous encounter.;   Publishers, naturally, are offering enough new
books on the subject to sink the Santa Maria. The best of them are highlighted
first, followed by a wide range of others.;   Worthy of presentation to
Isabella herself; Samuel Eliot Morison's "Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of
Christopher Columbus" (Little, Brown, $24.95 paperback) won a Pulitzer Prize
when it was first published in 1941. It shaped our image and understanding of
Columbus for decades after, and it still reads like a thriller. Every writer
on Columbus in the last half-century has begun with Morison, and so should
every reader.;   For those of us who believe that art and ideas tell the real
truth of history, nothing matches "Circa 1492: Art in the Age of Exploration"
(Yale, $59.95), edited by Jay A. Levenson. This is the catalog of a National
Gallery of Art exhibition that opens Oct. 12. The book, with more than 500
color illustrations, presents art from around the world in that watershed
year. China, India, Africa, the Americas and Europe are represented, with
authoritative commentary by a phalanx of scholars. If we were in the habit of
giving Columbus Day gifts, this is what I'd want.;   Kenneth Nebenzahl's
"Atlas of Columbus and The Great Discoveries" (Rand McNally, $75) is a
cartophile's dream come true. Beginning with the world as it was known in
Columbus's time, the author presents rare maps, many in color, that document
Europe's new understanding of the world. The maps themselves are beautiful and
fascinating and the text clarifies even the most obscure of them.;   "Columbus
and the Age of Discovery" (Morrow, $40) by Zvi Dor-Ner with William Scheller
is the companion volume to the seven-part PBS series. The authors sailed
Columbus's route in replicas of his ships built by the Spanish Navy, but the
book covers more than just the adventure. In text and 300 illustrations, it
surveys all the varied aspects of the enterprise.;   "Seeds of Change"
(Smithsonian, $39.95, $24.95 paperback) by Herman J. Viola and Carolyn
Margolis accompanies an exhibition opening Oct. 26 at the Smithsonian's
National Museum of Natural History. It documents in text and well-chosen
pictures the exchange of food, tools, diseases and everything else between
Europe and the Americas. The transfers included corn, potatoes, tomatoes and
syphilis to Europe; horses, cattle, sugar cane and smallpox to America.;  
"Conquest of Eden 1493-1515" (Academy Chicago, $34.95) by Michael Paiewonsky
uses eyewitness accounts and rare illustrations from a private collection to
examine Columbus's later voyages in the Caribbean. Published in the Virgin
Islands and printed in Italy (in an edition of only 3,000 copies), this is a
beautifully designed and produced book. Collectors will want it for the craft
alone, and readers will like it, too.;   So many biographers, so little time; 
 The great modern biographer of Columbus is Italian scholar Paolo Emilio
Taviani whose original four-volume study has been shortened and translated as
"Columbus: The Great Adventure" (Orion Books, $20). When the first half was
published in 1974, Adm. Morison himself called it "the best and most scholarly
book I have read on Columbus's life." Taviani paints Columbus in a broad
context, seeing his life as yet another expression of the Italian
Renaissance.;   "Christopher Columbus: The Voyage of Discovery 1492" (Dorset
Press, $12.95) combines, at a bargain price, excerpts from Morison's 1974 "The
European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages, 1492-1616" with
contemporary portraits, maps, drawings and modern photos that bring the
subject to vivid life. "The Voyages of Columbus 1492-1504" (Dorset Press,
$7.95) by Lorenzo Camusso provides a straightforward life, generously
illustrated.;   "Columbus: For Gold, God and Glory" (Simon &amp; Schuster, $35)
has text by nautical writer John Dyson and photos by Peter Christopher. They
too sailed Columbus's route in a replica of the Nina, and Dyson offers a new
theory about that route, even suggesting that Columbus had a secret map.;  
"Columbus" (Oxford, $22.95) by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto focuses on the
explorer's character and intellectual world but the arch tone will, depending
on the reader's patience, either annoy or amuse.;   What becomes a legend;
most? Revisionists;   Kirkpatrick Sale's "The Conquest of Paradise:
Christopher Columbus and the Columbian Legacy" (Plume, $12.95 paperback) is a
debunking biography. Much of it is superficial, but Sale does have some
interesting thoughts on the exchange of cultures.;   Better is "The Mysterious
History of Columbus: An Exploration of the Man, the Myth, the Legacy" (Knopf,
$24) by John Noble Wilford. A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Wilford
examines all the troublesome debates in a level-headed but lively manner.;  
Hans Koning "Columbus: His Enterprise" (Monthly Review Press, $8.95 paperback)
is fiercely revisionist, laying stress on the "era of genocide, cruelty and
slavery' introduced by Columbus. Koning's message is unpleasant. And hard to
deny.;   In his own words;   Readers tired of other people's versions of the
truth can, of course, go right back to Columbus's own reports. A new
translation of "The Log of Christopher Columbus" by Robert H. Fuson (Tab
Books, $14.92 paperback) is the one to get. It offers a fine translation, a
useful introduction, an innovative design and an historic price.;   Coming in
December is "The Columbus Papers: The Barcelona Letter of 1493" (Macmillan,
$100), a bargain compared to the $3,000 bibliophile edition published by the
New York Public Library, which owns the Barcelona Letter and the rare maps and
documents handsomely reproduced and translated in the book.;   The Old World; 
 Three new books attempt to open up for us the European world that produced
Columbus and that was about to be changed so dramatically. Cultural historian
Stephen Greenblatt, in "Marvelous Possessions: The Wonder of the New World"
(University of Chicago, $24.95), examines how a highly developed sense of the
marvelous -- Europe was astonished by Columbus's news -- can lead to
understanding as well as to exploitation.;   "Fourteen Ninety Two: The Decline
of medievalism and the Rise of the Modern Age" (Scribner, 24.95) by Barnet
Litvinoff is a lively intellectual history of a world in transition. And in
"Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians" (Praeger, $12.95),
Jeffrey Burton Russell explains what Columbus knew and then traces the
erroneous belief that he thought the earth was flat.;   The other Old World;  
Anyone who has studied the Pre-Columbian civilizations of America can only
lament the wholesale destruction of that world by the conquerors who followed
Columbus. "Kingdoms of Gold, Kingdoms of Jade: The Americas Before Columbus"
(Thames and Hudson, $24) by Brian M. Fagan offers the latest discoveries in an
illustrated, exciting and authoritative introduction to the world of the Inca,
Aztec, Maya and North American peoples.;   Food critic Raymond Sokolov, in his
wonderful book, "Why We Eat What We Eat" (Summit, $22), traces the effects of
food exchanges on the modern world. It even has some recipes.;   The October
1991 National Geographic focuses on "1491: America Before Columbus," and
portrays the Native American heritage of the United States on the eve of
change.; "Memory and Modernity: Popular Culture in Latin America" (Verso,
$59.95, $17.95 paperback) by William Rowe and Vivian Schelling surveys the
roots of modern artistic expression in the regions most directly affected by
Spanish influence.;   The fiction of discovery; Most of the fiction inspired
-- if that's the word -- by Columbus has come from Native American and Latin
American writers whose heritage keeps them ever mindful of his long-lasting
influence.;   Among the former, Gerald Vizenor is a Chippewa writer whose
latest novel, "The Heirs of Columbus" (Wesleyan University Press, $18.95),
mixes fact and fiction in a tale of the explorer's mixed-blood descendants.
Louise Erdrich (also Chippewa) and Michael Dorris (of the Modoc tribe) have
collaborated on "The Crown of Columbus" (HarperCollins, $21.95), a novel about
both self-discovery and the discovery of some lost Columbus treasures in the
Bahamas.;   Three Latin American novels are especially worthy of note. The
great Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier dramatizes the debate about Columbus's
reputation in "The Harp and the Shadow" (Mercury House, $16.95). Mexican
novelist Carlos Fuentes offers a disturbing projection of the future in
"Christopher Unborn" (Penguin, $12.95 paperback). And Homero Aridjis, also of
Mexico, vividly recreates 15th-century Spain in "1492: The Life and Times of
Juan Cabezon of Castile" (Summit, $21.95).;   Books for children; Publishers
haven't neglected young readers either.;   The most beautiful new children's
book on the subject is "Follow the Dream" (Knopf, $15) by artist Peter Sis,
but while the paintings are gorgeous, the minimal text preserves traditional
errors.;   "All Pigs on Deck" (Delacorte, $15) should amuse readers, 5 to 8.
For readers 8 to 12, "If You Were There in 1492" (Bradbury Press, $13.95) by
Barbara Brenner provides the facts, while "I Sailed with Columbus"
(HarperCollins, $13.95) by Miriam Schlein is a rousing novel of adventure.;  
Slightly older readers will like "The High Voyage" (Delacorte, $14.95) by Olga
Litowinsky, a narrative of Columbus's fourth voyage by his son, Fernando. (box)  </TEXT>
