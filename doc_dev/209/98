<LEADPARA>  WHAT a dirty little world this is, with mud slung here and mud slung there and
mud rising neck-high if you happen to be standing in the wrong place at the
wrong time.;    Standing neck-deep -- as anyone who hasn't been in Antarctica
for the past six months knows -- is mudslinger extraordinaire Kitty Kelley,
whose unauthorized biographies of Jackie Onassis, Elizabeth Taylor, Frank
Sinatra and most recently Nancy Reagan have earned her a reputation as a
person who knows how to dig up the dirt and dish it out.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Now Kelley is on the receiving end of the mud-bath, the subject of "Poison
Pen: The Unauthorized Biography of Kitty Kelley" by George Carpozi Jr. You
can't miss it in the bookstores, where it arrived last week -- it is the one
with the jacket that looks exactly like the cover of Kelley's "Nancy Reagan:
The Unauthorized Biography.";    Carpozi, a 70-year-old journalist who has
worked for the New York Post and the Star supermarket tabloid and has written
more than 70 books, decided to take on Kelley because "suddenly she had become
a very big celebrity in this country and I, as a veteran investigative
reporter, determined that she was an outrageous liar.";    Speaking on the
phone from his home in Long Island, N.Y., Carpozi bristled with indignation as
he recapped some of Kelley's alleged journalistic transgressions.;    "It was
such garbage," he said of some of the Sinatra bombshells. "I catch her in all
kinds of lies," he added about Onassis revelations.;    Kelley's reaction to
his treatment -- which tears apart her books, point by tedious point -- is so
far unknown. Attempts to reach her through her publicist and her agent were
unsuccessful. She has put out the word that she is unavailable for comment
about the book that paints her as promiscuous, money-grubbing, mendacious and
unscrupulous.;    Carpozi even accuses her of being a kleptomaniac. Things
have disappeared when she's been around, he points out, citing several
examples. Although he admitted that some of the evidence is thin, he said a
phone call from one of Kelley's old sorority sisters detailing dormitory
thefts convinced him this was true.;    Aren't these techniques -- as well as
his liberal borrowing from previously published books and articles -- just the
sort of thing he criticizes Kelley for doing?;    "What Kitty Kelley writes is
fiction," Carpozi said emphatically. "What I've written here is the truth.";  
 Others are not so sure.;    "Just as Kitty ignores Mrs. Reagan's good points,
he doesn't give Kitty a break," said gossip columnist Liz Smith, a former
friend of Kelley's, who said Carpozi interviewed her for an hour but used none
of the material she provided.;    Smith labels the book "journalistic
overkill" and even its publisher concedes that it is hardly literature.;   
"Carpozi is a mediocre writer," said Lyle Stuart, head of Barricade Books. "So
we worked very hard on improving and improving and it isn't bad. It's not
Shakespeare, but it's a very readable book.";    But "Poison Pen" already is
meeting a barrage of refutation similar to that which has greeted each of
Kelley's books.;    "It has some factual errors," said Robin Webb, a press
assistant for Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley, the Democrat who
represents Kelley's home state of Washington and who has a long association
with the Kelley family in Spokane.;    Webb specifically quarrels with
Carpozi's description of Foley's swearing-in; the book states that Foley had
only two tickets for spectators, which went to "his two favorite people" --
his wife and Kelley.;    "In fact he was allotted nine tickets," Webb says, of
which one did go to Kelley. Carpozi never interviewed Foley for the book, Webb
adds.;    Carpozi's desire to write about Kelley has grown through the years
as he has read her books, which he says have borrowed heavily from his own --
he also has written biographies of Sinatra, Taylor and Jacqueline
Onassis.Watching Kelley say she had nothing to hide on the "Larry King Show" a
couple of years ago convinced him to go ahead with the project.;    "I noticed
these facial tics as she spoke," Carpozi remembers. "I said to myself, 'She
has something to hide.' ";    The book is doing very well, almost definitely
headed for a second printing with the first of 103,500 copies already ordered
by stores. It is certainly making a bigger splash than anything else he has
ever worked on, Carpozi says.;    His previous books include one about the
death of John Lennon, which he put together in five days after Lennon's death;
a volume about the Persian Gulf war; a biography of Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf;
and one of Donald Trump.;    Upcoming in a week or two is a paperback on the
scandals in the Kennedy family, focusing on the Palm Beach, Fla., rape charges
against William Kennedy Smith. "It shows how the authorities railroaded Willie
Smith," Carpozi promises. "This is really dynamite. I blow them out of the
water."  </TEXT>
