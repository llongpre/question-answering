CYBERSPACE: FIRST STEPS edited by Michael Benedikt MIT Press Pounds 19.95,
436 pages
LOST IN Cyberspace? Then blame Descartes: 'I have, on the one hand, a clear
and distinct idea of myself as a thinking, non-extended thing, and, on the
other hand, a distinct idea of my body as an extended, non-thinking thing;
it is therefore certain that I am truly distinct from my body, and can exist
without it' (Meditations, 1642). Three hundred and fifty years on,
technology has proved this almost instinct almost true. Leibniz arrived in
1666 with his idea of 'electric language' for logical reasoning outside
language, and the coordinates for Cyberspace were set.
Cyberspace: First Steps, is a difficult, technical and interdisciplinary
collection of 15 essays from architects, philosophers, Sci-Fi writers and
intellectual historians. It gives the history of a technology that will
alter our lives next century, although no one knows exactly how. The essays'
limitations - obscurity, obtuseness and jargon - are entirely consistent
with confusions surrounding VR technology. No one knows what kind of world
the technology is driving us towards.
The history, however, is plain enough. After written texts (around 1600)
came the electronic revolution (after 1900) and the age of information
technology (after 1960). In 1984, the Sci-Fi writer William Gibson coined
the term 'Cyberspace' in Neuromancer, a bewildering journey through a matrix
of 'collective hallucination.' Instead of sitting at the computer keyboard
controlling information, Gibson's characters were inside the matrix. They
were information.
The current pop-example of Cyberspace is the new 'Virtual Reality' (VR)
technology. This lets a computer's users represent themselves in three
dimensions and wander around with other bits of electronic information in
the computer's memory; this technology has become useful for architects,
designers and fire fighters as well as games-players. But Cyberspace is more
than that; it is the place where all information, visualised spatially,
moves along electronic networks between users; the place where data is
collected and robots controlled remotely; the place where the mind floats
free of the body.
So, what does living in Cyberspace mean? Many people are already there. With
portable PCs and modems, we are turned into nomads who are always in touch.
Within the permanently ephemeral world created by digital television, PCs
and high bandwidth cable or radio-frequency networks, we build structures of
information like data visualisation, user networks or graphic user
interfaces. These structures exist in the country called Cyberspace: bank
accounts, credit ratings, company files.
The rules of evolution for Cyberspace have yet to be defined. That
uncertainty makes these essays an adventure in honest perplexity. The
Cyberspace revolution has spawned a new commentator, the Cyber-architect,
who unites (as traditional architects do) the disciplines of design,
technology and sociology. The language which explains Cyberspace is
overwhelmingly architectural: dimensions, structures, habitations. But there
is no obvious 'natural space' equivalent for motion or physical interaction
in Cyberspace. Those who write about it in this collection are mining in
unknown seams with an occasional pit-prop and no illumination from the
outside world.
Now, Cyberspace research is beginning to call into question our very notions
of 'space', 'intelligence' and 'perception'; so these essays are a taxing
excursion in philosophical and semantic thinking. The contributors require a
highly eclectic knowledge from their reader, who is expected to be familiar
with such disparates as Baudrillard, Habermas, Lacan, CS Lewis, le
Corbusier, McLuhan, Merleau-Ponty and Gerard de Nerval. Michael Benedikt's
editing is rather too light for the non-specialist, but then Cyberspace
involves enough disciplines to make a nonsense of specialism.
Since no process of logical reasoning can add to the information which its
founding axioms contain, nor to the observations from which it proceeds
(information encoded in a molecule of DNA or an architect's blueprint), and
since Cyberspace has yet to decide on its logical processes and its axioms,
this is a fascinating area which allows every intellectual discipline a fair
shout. Few academic subjects are confident enough not to exclude others
these days.
Perhaps because Cyberspace is a country of the mind, the laws of the
imagination will turn out to be the processes which govern the new
electronic frontiers. As Dr Johnson said, 'Were it not for imagination, sir,
a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a Duchess.'
