FOR two years, Andre Knecht, national singles sales manager for Warner Bros
Records, wanted to join the data superhighway with a CompuServe forum about
the music industry.
He won his chance in mid-September when the Music Vendor forum joined what
CompuServe spokeswoman Debra Young says is 400 forums on the online service.
Warner Bros is using its new outlet, accessible to 1.4m CompuServe
subscribers throughout the world, to post new release information that is
normally disseminated only within the music industry through flimsy
new-release books.
Warner pop group Depeche Mode conducted an online press conference on the
Music Vendor forum and Knecht fields questions on changing personnel of rock
groups by staying late at the office to log on. Warner Bros does not expect
to sell anything directly on CompuServe because, although shopping is an
option of CompuServe's 'electronic mall,' information is really the
service's stock in trade.
Information generates the most sales, as when people log themselves onto
airline reservation systems and figure out their own itineraries or buy
shares more cheaply than through brokers. But then CompuServe has extensive
research for stock-market investing, including a screening service to
highlight variables like book value, growth rate, debt/equity ratio and
yield.
A stock quote is constantly at hand by typing GO BASICQUOTES, and the
Analyzer answers financial and ownership questions.
CompuServe's income comes from keeping subscribers logged onto the system.
CompuServe supplies the information while outside vendors make the sales.
For less than Dollars 10 a month, subscribers get unlimited use of free
services but many are surcharged, including even the Music Vendors forum,
though stock quotes are free. As 'the Swiss army knife of all online
services,' (in the words of PC World magazine), CompuServe has the most
comprehensive online service.
But others have found their own niches in a field where information overlap
is almost unavoidable. The Dow-Jones service has exclusive online use of the
Wall Street Journal, its own flagship publication, while Mead Data Central
secured exclusive online use of the New York Times for its Nexis service.
Other popular networks are Prodigy, a co-production of IBM and Sears, which
has a consumer bent; GEnie, General Electric's consumer data service, which
is popular for online conversation and having the latest shareware; and
America Online, a newcomer with less information but speedy communications.
THE Windows interface has made access to the databases merely a few mouse
clicks on provided software. Once logged on, subscribers see icons
highlighting areas of access like news, research, investing, and travel. The
services differ in the way they charge, some putting limits on the time made
available with the monthly fee. All have surcharges for special services.
All these online networks are provided by for-profit companies, but the
network of networks, which carries thousands of networks besides these, is
government-subsidised and non-profit. The Internet, as it is called, came to
prominence when Vice-President Al Gore discussed the data superhighway of
the future, which he expected to be a public-private collaboration.
Many noted that such a thing already existed - Internet - which began as the
means for academic exchange. It gradually grew to include companies
exchanging data with customers, suppliers and their own far-flung outposts.
The debate over who should control the Internet goes on while commercial
activity leaps through the cyberspace. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. announced
that it intends to buy Delphi Internet Services which connects customers to
the Internet, while American Telephone &amp; Telegraph said that it soon would
connect customers to the Internet with a toll-free 800 number.
The Internet itself is being inundated with businesses signing themselves
on. As of March 1, this year, more than half of 3,400 networks registered
for the Internet were private businesses, compared to 29 per cent research
institutes and 4 per cent educational centres - 'what is going on now is the
equivalent of a gold rush,' according to Phill Gross, chairman of the
Internet Engineering Task Force. 'Commercial companies, new users, the small
mom-and-pop outfits - they're all rushing into this new frontier.'
The task force is a voluntary group that deals with technical problems on
the Internet, including an effort to provide more security on the system.
The lack of security is itself protection against too much commercial
exploitation of the Internet. But as the National Science Foundation's
measly Dollars 11.5m subsidy is gradually reduced, the system is a tempting
target for commercialisation. For now, businesses that indulge in a
cyberspace version of junk mail are being excoriated by other Internet
users.
The future holds prospects for voice, text and video transmission, a
development that will only increase the appeal of the online services.
Already the Music Vendor forum foresees transmitting artwork, digital audio
files and video on CompuServe.
Knecht says that the Music Vendor forum had more than 1,000 log-ons its
first day, a feat that indicates the potential for this extra-terrestrial
definition of office space. He is leading the way in breaking down the
barriers between consumer and business communication.
But the rapid changes endanger the uniqueness of a channel pioneered by
non-commercial interests. Its fate may be decided all too shortly, as the
leading players in worldwide communications weigh in with their investments.
