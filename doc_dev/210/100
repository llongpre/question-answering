In the corporate battle zone of the 1990s, even successful companies have to
move fast to avoid defeat. As the travails of IBM, General Motors,
Volkswagen and others have shown, the proven business methods of the past
are no guarantee that sales and profits will continue to flourish.
Increasingly, executives are turning to alliances, partnerships and joint
ventures, often formed to produce particular products and then disbanded.
These enable costs to be shared, development times to be shortened and
effective use to be made of design, manufacturing and marketing skills
inside and outside the company.
Such linkages - variously described as virtual corporations or agile
enterprises - are made easier by computer technology. They can be set up,
controlled and reshaped quickly and flexibly so companies can draw on
worldwide resources to achieve their objectives.
'Information technology, because it's going to become as ubiquitous as the
telephone system, is going to enable people to have totally different
concepts of how they work together,' says David Allen, director of European
strategic marketing at Ungermann-Bass, the US-based computer equipment
company. He sees ideas like the virtual corporation as part of the business
re-engineering process by which many companies are fundamentally changing
the way they operate.
Ungermann-Bass, owned by Tandem Computers, has produced a series of combined
hardware and software products which enable companies to link up their
terminals, workstations and printers almost as they please, without
incurring heavy extra expenditure on new equipment or running the risk that
this will be outmoded. These products, described as Virtual Network
Architecture, are designed to allow information to flow where it is needed
and not just be restricted to small groups of users.
Allen believes Europe is at least a year behind the US in corporate
re-engineering. He cites the example of German companies which want to cut
traditionally high costs and employment levels while remaining global
players. 'The virtual corporation is going to start giving them concepts
they can use.'
With the associated technology - other aspirants in this field include
SynOptics and Kalpana, both of the US - this allows companies to draw on
international resources in a way that would previously have been difficult.
'Why shouldn't you have somebody in an office in England designing a
product, having it produced in Japan or Taiwan and marketed in America, with
all this being controlled totally at arms' length but appearing to be linked
together,' says Allen.
There are plenty of examples of link-ups in the motor, computer,
electronics, aerospace and other industries. Roger Nagel, operations
director at Lehigh University's Iacocca Institute in Pennsylvania, cites US
Car (an electric car venture between Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler),
Sematech (in semiconductors) and the tie-up between Apple, IBM and Motorola
in computer systems and equipment. Nagel, who recently spoke at a series of
European seminars on computer networking technology organised by
Ungermann-Bass, says such partnerships do not depend on electronic
integration, but are certainly enhanced by it.
VNA enables computer systems to be linked without the need for extra
components. This, the company claims, makes it cost effective. It works with
existing user networks and is capable of being upgraded to the next stage of
networking technology, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) which will enable
information to be passed between computers at extremely high speeds.
With VNA, life is made easier for those controlling computer networks.
Instead of extensive recabling, managers can simply identify various layers
of their networks on a screen and reconfigure the different user groups at
the push of a button. Ungermann-Bass's products, DragonSwitch and
NetDirector/VNA, are designed to make these links - up to 65,000 groupings
can be set up in one organisation - in individual sites and across the
world. They can be used with systems operating on any software, chiefly
Microsoft and Lotus, and satisfy user's desire for speed of operation.
A businessman will be able to call up information at will on, for example,
his company's activities in the Far East or research developments. 'For the
first time,' Allen says, 'he will be able to get information on anything
from anywhere on one terminal.' This will allow companies to share
information on a 24-hour basis between continents. Multi-media applications,
with pictures, sound and data on screen, will also be possible.
If, however, businesses are to assess the benefits of such products
properly, computer companies must stress the applications clearly.
'Networking is a great bore for them (executives). They don't understand it
or want to. They just want the information there when they need it,' says
Allen.
