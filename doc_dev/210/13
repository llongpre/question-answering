Japanese computer group is preparing for a head-on multimedia clash with
Microsoft

Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer manufacturer, is planning a multimedia
initiative in the US, which could bring it into head-on competition with
Microsoft, the world's biggest software house.
In April next year, it plans to launch a US version of a futuristic, on-line
role-playing game which it has been testing for more than seven years in
Japan. Called Habitat, it creates a fantasy world on screen - a virtual city
in cyberspace, as multimedia experts would describe it - populated by
characters who take on the personalities of the players. There are some
10,000 regular subscribers in Japan.
Japanese sociologists are already fascinated by the way people behave when
allowed to adopt these electronic alter egos. Within Habitat there is a
'head shop' where players can change their heads, and a 'paint shop' where
they can change their clothes.
However, Habitat - which Fujitsu bought from the Lucas Arts Entertainment
Company, owned by George Lucas, director of 'Star Wars' (see below) - is
more than a game. It can function as an attractive, simple-to-use interface
to a broad range of information and educational services. Students can send
messages to each other on an electronic campus; shops and banks can be
created on screen; and players can send their electronic images off on
shopping trips.
Tatsuzumi Furukawa, Fujitsu main board director and multimedia projects
group manager, says that Habitat will be the first test of Fujitsu's
multimedia capabilities outside Japan. If it proves successful, the service
will be extended to Europe, beginning with the UK in 1996.
A successful Habitat in the US would find itself in direct competition with
Microsoft's planned Microsoft Network, an on-line information service which
the software giant is expected to launch next spring, and which will feature
shopping catalogues, financial services and news services. Microsoft's
prices are expected to be significantly below those of existing on-line
services such as America On-Line or CompuServe. It is expected to offer a
simple user interface, based on Microsoft's best-selling Windows software.
Much will depend on the quality of information available over the respective
networks. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, has been busily signing up
information providers in anticipation of the start of Microsoft Network.
Fujitsu operates Japan's leading on-line business information service,
Nifty-serve, in partnership with Nissho Iwai. In 1993 it had revenues of
Dollars 130m (Pounds 79m) and profits before tax of about Dollars 13m.
Nifty-serve has a relationship with CompuServe, of the US, but Furukawa
agrees that over the next few years Fujitsu will have to form alliances with
a broad range of information providers. Some will be simple commercial
relationships, but others will be strategic partnerships: 'If an information
provider wanted to start a new kind of service, we would be able to help,'
Furukawa says. 'We have substantial experience now.'
Fujitsu's venture in the US is just one indication of the importance it
attaches to multimedia. It has set a target of expanding sales of
multi-media-related products and services to reach 20 to 25 per cent of
revenues by 1997. Currently the category accounts for only 2 to 3 per cent
of the group's sales.
As a leading electronics manufacturer, it already provides much of the
hardware which is making multimedia possible. It supplies, for example, four
out of the seven regional Bell operating companies with switches and optical
equipment for asynchronous transfer mode transmission, the new technology
which is expected to underpin the information superhighway.
Fujitsu sees multimedia, however, as the leading edge of its translation
from a predominantly hardware manufacturing group - it is best known for its
IBM-compatible mainframe computers - to a services orientated business. The
company is becoming involved in content, developing and marketing
information, entertainment and educational materials. Last June, it
established a Digital Media Group to co-ordinate these activities.
The group has a core of researchers who worked on software for Fujitsu's
pioneering FM-Towns multimedia personal computer (launched some six years
ago) and on three-dimentional animation. The idea is to seek out and work
with Japanese and overseas partners to develop and market software and
programs for CD-Rom, PC on-line communications, cable TV and other media
platforms.
Furukawa says: 'It is something we are taking step by step. In the US there
are many trials of multimedia developments such as video-on-demand. But we
are concerned with how to make a business out of multimedia after the trials
are over.'
The company has a three-pronged approach to the market:
First, there is the on-line information business, represented by Nifty-serve
and Habitat. Fujitsu has a strategic alliance with Sharp, the consumer
electronics company, which has sold some 400,000 personal digital assistants
(hand-held computers capable of accepting handwritten instructions). The two
companies are planning to link Nifty-serve to the PDA, to create a mobile
on-line information service.
Second, cable television. This is a novel service in Japan, and subscriber
numbers are low. But Fujitsu has invested in some 23 cable television
companies. It is a limited experiment; the investment in each amounts to
only 15-20 per cent of the equity, but it is providing a test-bed for trials
of interactive services.
Third, business multimedia. Fujitsu is marketing Team Office developed by
ICL, its UK subsidiary, in Japan. The software makes it possible to share
documents, and for colleagues to work together using linked personal
computers.
Fujitsu and ICL agreed to work together on multimedia developments last
year. The cultural shift was as great for ICL as for its parent. From
marketing large mainframes it had to focus on the home market, education and
entertainment.
McKinsey, the management consultancy, worked with the company for four
months to help ICL understand the dynamics of such a new market. The first
fruits - kiosk systems for the retail and financial services industry - are
now on trial with customers such as Argos, Woolworths and the Nationwide
Building Society.
