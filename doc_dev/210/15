A virtual war of words in cyberspace is heading for a very real
confrontation in a UK courtroom.
A London physics lecturer is suing a former colleague for libel on the
Internet, a self-regulating global computer network where millions of users
exchange academic ideas, political opinions, and, increasingly, insults.
No date has been set for the case but if the suit goes to trial in the High
Court in London it could expand the definitions of UK libel law and expose
the legal potholes in the information superhighway. Other cases have already
challenged libel laws in the US and Australia.
Usenet, the part of the Internet where the alleged libellous comments
appeared, is sometimes known as the world's largest electronic conference.
It consists of a series of 'news groups' in which an estimated 16m users can
post messages and debate special interests.
Within this conference setting, a culture of 'flaming' - the reckless
exchange of insults - has arisen. Because messages are sent to news groups,
which are accessible to almost all users, rather than individuals, rows
between users are aired in public.
Mr Nick Braithwaite, a media lawyer with London solicitors Clifford Chance,
said that many users forget their private vendettas on the Usenet are out in
the open.
'They think they are having a private conversation but it is like they are
using a megaphone,' he said.
In the UK case, Dr Laurence Godfrey, a former nuclear physicist at the
German Electron Syncroton Laboratory in Hamburg, has issued a writ against
Dr Phillip Hallam-Baker, a researcher at Cern, the European nuclear physics
laboratory in Geneva, claiming damages for libel or slander.
Dr Godfrey is suing for alleged comments about his professional work which
he claims were made by Dr Hallam-Baker on seven separate occasions between
April and July of last year on the Usenet. Dr Hallam-Baker has said the case
will be defended.
Dr Godfrey said he distinguished between insults and libel.
'The everyday insults are not libel and I do not take exception with them,'
he said. 'It is the allegations of an untrue nature that I am suing about.'
In a separate case, however, Dr Godfrey himself is being sued by Carleton
University and Brock University of Ontario, Canada, for Internet comments
which may be in breach of confidence.
