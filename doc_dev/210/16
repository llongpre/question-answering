FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (3): Buzzwords in brief - From
Ace and ATM to Lans, Mans and Vans / Although networking has vital
implications for the business world, the technology is often obscured by
technical jargon and buzzwords. Here, for the non-technical reader, Michael
Wiltshire offers some simplified definitions

Access control method: the main distinguishing feature between different
local area network (Lan) technologies.
ACE: advanced computing environment - a standard sponsored by a consortium
of 22 vendors, including DEC, Microsoft and Compaq.
ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII is the
standard method of identifying characters, numerals and punctuation marks.
ATM technology: asynchronous transfer mode, developed in France in the
mid-1980s, is a breakthrough in communication technology with the potential
to support transmission of combined data, voice and video at up to 45
megabits a second.
ATM opens the door to many new network applications.
Baud: a measure of signal changes per second in a device such as a modem.
Backbone: generic term for a Lan or Wan connections 'trunk' between
sub-networks across an enterprise. Subnetworks are connected to the backbone
via bridges and/or routers.
Bandwidth: the range of signal frequencies that can be carried on a
communications channel.
Bit: a binary unit of information that can have two values, 0 or 1. The word
'bit' is a contraction of binary digit.
Block: a collection of transmitted data.
Broadband: a term with a number of meanings - it was coined originally to
describe a channel with more bandwidth than a standard voice grade channel,
usually a 48kHz link, equal to 12 voice-grade channels. Such channels are
gradually being superseded by digital circuits.
Broadcast: when a user sends a message from one terminal to others on the
network.
CCITT: an international body, made up of telephone companies and other IT
players, responsible for setting global communication standards.
Client-server technology: the most widespread example of network computing:
moves information processing to where it is most economical, fast and
useful; divides computer systems into front-end 'client' workstations and
back-end 'server' processes.
CTI: computer-telephony integration - also known as computer-supported
telephony.
Data compression: a key topic for network managers as multimedia, video,
document imaging and other technologies emerge.
Domains: a Microsoft inspired network structure which separates large
networks into smaller, more manageble segments. A domain can be made up of
multipler servers and thousands of workstations.
DBMS: database management system - a software system to manage data.
DCE: data communications equipment, the hardware that provides connection to
the network; DTE stands for data terminal equipment on a network, eg
computers, printers and plotters.
Digital signature: an encryption method to validate an electronic message.
Distributed database: data located at multiple sites.
Digital signal: this has only two values, normally 0 and 1, during
transmission, as opposed to analogue signals whose values vary all the time.
Dynamic routing: a way of sending messages across a network - if a line
fails or is overloaded, the system will automatically re-route the message.
Packet switching operates on this principle, with the system always poised
to react to ever-changing conditions.
EDI: electronic data interchange for business data such as purchase orders
and invoices between companies.
Electronic mail: sending and receiving messages and text-based information
between computers; the most common application on networks.
Ethernet: one of the oldest Lan technologies, developed by Xerox, Intel and
DEC to run over coaxial cable; highly successful and still popular.
File server: a computer attached to a Lan, usually running on a network
operating system (Nos).
Frames: a segment of data sent over a network medium using a cable or laser.
The frame size is dependent on the protocols and services used.
Frame relay: a data communication method for wide area networks, slowly
replacing X25 - an X series standard, specifying the interface between
computers and packet switched networks.
Groupware: network software that defines applications used by a group of
people. See page five.
GUI: a graphical user interface to enable computer users to easily select a
'menu item' by using a 'mouse' to click on to a graphic icon.
Hub: the centre of a star topology network or cabling system.
Interoperability: the ability of applications on two computer systems to
exchange information so that they can understand each other.
ISDN: the slow-to-emerge integrated services digital network covering a
range of voice, data and image services.
Internet: the most expansive network of computer networks in the world, with
25m users - see article on facing page.
ISO: International Standards Organisation, based in Geneva; responsible for
many data communication standards, the best-known being the seven-layer Open
Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.
Lan: a local area network - in its simplest form, a cabling system.
Installing a private cabling system (to which computers can be connected)
and by using agreed proceedures (protocols), communications between all
stations is possible.
Man: metropolitan area network; usually high speed fibre-optic systems.
Modems: short for modulators/demodulators; devices for connecting computers
to public switched telephone networks (PSTN).
Multimedia: brings voice, video and graphics to the network in the form of
large files, requiring high disc storage space; plus large amounts of
bandwidth during transmission.
NetWare: Lan networking products including an operating system developed by
Novell that holds a large market share of the Lan server sector. Novell
claims to have 40m clients on its networks.
Network audit trail: a continuous record of a network's activity.
Network management: 'A term used to cover a multitude of sins,' says David
Palmer-Stevens, author of the Guide to Local Area Networking.* 'As yet,
there are few complete solutions available - a patchwork of network
management systems cover a variety of areas . . . basically, vendors'
systems fall into one of two camps, concerned with either physical
(hardware) elements or the logical side of the network - the control and
management of inter-process communication.'
OME: an open messaging environment.
Object-oriented technology: reusable software programming that simplifies
development of applications.
OS/2: cornerstone of IBM's client-server strategy for desktop computer
systems.
OSI model: a seven-layer model developed by the International Standards
Organisation, ISO, specifying how computers should communicate over a
network.
PowerPC: microprocessor architecture developed by Motorola, in conjunction
with IBM and Apple Computers.
PDNS: public data networks.
Packet: a group of bytes, sent over a link.
Packet switching: a method of switching data in a network where individual
packets of set size and format are accepted by the network and delivered to
their destinations. With various companies sharing a network, the packet
option can be a cost-saving method of communicating data.
TCP/IP: suite of protocols developed by the US Department of Defense, since
adopted as an international standard, particularly for networks of
interconnected Ethernet Lans.
SNA: Systems Network Architecture, introduced by IBM, the world's first
network architecture.
Token ring network: the standard of the Institute of Electrical and
Electronic Engineers.
Unix: a multi-user operating system that supports networking and distributed
file systems.
Vans: value added network services - a network that provides specialised
facilities beyond the normal carrier service by adding computer-control and
communications.
Wan: a wide area network, covering a larger area than a local area network,
and including telecom links. Examples include packet switched networks, PDNs
and Vans.
X series: recommendations specified by CCITT governing the attachment of
terminals and computers to a data network.
