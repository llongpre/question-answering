It can lay reasonable claim to being the trendiest magazine in the world.
What New Musical Express and Rolling Stone were to the rise of popular
music, a new US magazine called Wired aims to be for the emerging world of
multimedia. In the 1960s Rolling Stone and NME were essential for young rock
fans who each week bought LPs to play on the mono record players in their
bedrooms. Wired aims to be the essential accessory for a generation brought
up with the personal computer, electronic games and e-mail.
Launched in January last year, with 12 full-time staff and only Dollars
250,000 of capital, Wired's circulation has risen from 150,000 to 230,000
copies a month, mainly in the US.
Its success rests on making the cyberspace world of the computer nerd
accessible to the average consumer. It offers an informed
and exciting guide to the new products, services and businesses which are
being created by the convergence of computers, telecommun-ications and
entertainment.
The magazine's trick is that it approaches this often intimi-dating world
from angles which will satisfy novices and specialists alike. Its apparently
chaotic design borrows heavily from style magazines such as The Face. It has
its very own grammar: each article ends not just with the writer's name, but
also their e-mail address on the Internet networking system. Yet it's not
afraid of being mainstream.
It carries meaty articles which would grace a staid business magazine.
Recent issues have included long pieces about the US government anti-trust
case against Microsoft and the battle between MCI and AT&amp;T in long distance
telecommunications, for instance.
Jane Metcalfe, the magazine's 32-year-old president and co-founder explains:
'We wanted to make a magazine for really modern people living in a digital,
electronic world. All these technologies can allow people to take power
themselves.'
She and her co-founder, Louis Rossetto, spent their savings and almost two
years hawking the project around US publishers before they got their launch
finance. Now they employ 52 people and sell in 26 countries. Wired is also
about to go international in a big way, with a recent deal to start a
Japanese language edition and rapid expansion planned in the UK and
continental Europe.
In the UK, Wired is distributed by CoMag Tel: 0895 444055. By Charles
