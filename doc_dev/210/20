Armed with a personal computer and a modem, the world of on-line information
is just a telephone line and a mouse click away.
Once on the 'information superhighway' the possibilities are almost
limitless. From weather forecasts to astro physics, there are few subjects
not covered on the internet or in what has become known as 'cyberspace'.
The internet itself is an informal system linking more than 7,500 individual
computer networks and more than 2m computers in academic institutions,
companies and other organisations.
It is used mostly for electronic mail (e-mail) and information exchange by
an estimated 25m to 30m people - a figure rising by between 5 and 10 per
cent a month.
But the internet is not the only source of on-line information. There are
thousands of bulletin board systems (BBS) mostly run by computer
enthusiasts, and a wide range of commercial on-line information services.
So how does the novice begin to explore this world?
The traditional route has been the local BBS - an electronic notice board on
which messages can be left. Most BBS's also enable users to send (upload) or
receive (download) software and other data.
A BBS is run by 'sysops' (systems operators), who are usually computer
enthusiasts to help 'newbies' - newcomers to the world of PC communications.
BBS telephone access numbers - the numbers used by communications software
to connect a home PC modem to the BBS modem - are often listed in computer
magazines.
Most on-line systems, although not CompuServe, expect your communications
software to be set to the following parameters: eight bits, no parity, one
stop (or 8,N,1) and support a number of different 'protocols' or modem
communications languages, for downloading computer files. Among the most
common protocols are Xmodem, Zmodem, Ymodem and Kermit.
Usually there is no charge - other than ordinary telephone charges - for
logging on to an amateur BBS. There are, however, also a growing number of
commercial BBS, most of which advertise in magazines, which charge for
downloading programs (and sometimes pornographic pictures), or can only be
reached via premium-priced telephone numbers.
Although it is reasonably easy to set up communications software and a modem
to dial into a BBS, many new users may find it easier to start with one of
the commercial information services such as CompuServe Information Service
(CIS) or Delphi, or a commercial conferencing system such as the Computer
Information eXchange (CIX).
Although most of these services started in the US they are now available via
a local call in the UK. Their big advantage over the neighbourhood BBS is
that they have helpful telephone 'hotlines' ready to talk new users through
their first tentative steps along the information superhighway.
These services generally charge a join-up fee and then a flat monthly
membership fee of between Pounds 6 and Pounds 10. However, in an effort to
sign up new customers, they often waive the sign-up fee and offer potential
users free trials.
To sign up with CompuServe call 0800-289378 or log on to 0171-490 8881 by
modem with the parameters set to 7,1,E; for CIX call 0181-390 8446 or log on
to 0181-390 1255 with the parameters set to 8,N,1; for Delphi call 0171-757
7080.
New customers usually receive membership kits which, in addition to a local
access telephone number and a password - needed to log on to their master
computer - usually include a manual and, in the case of CompuServe, a
dedicated software package called Cim (CompuServe Information Manager),
which is available in DOS, Windows and Macintosh versions.
Although initial charges are low, it is easy to build up a sizeable bill
quite quickly. Commercial on-line services generally charge a flat monthly
fee, and an additional fee for information outside their basic services,
plus, in the UK at least, the PC user will have to pay telephone call
charges.
To reduce costs, most commercial on-line services give customers local
numbers which can be used to access their services.
There are also special software packages called off-line readers, or OLRs,
that enable you to prepare before the communications software connects to
the service and the meter starts ticking. Using an OLR such as NavCis for
CompuServe or Ameol and WigWam for CIX, a one-hour session can be reduced to
a few minutes on-line.
Commercial on-line services also provide one of the simplest methods of
connecting to, and sampling the internet. For example CIX, CompuServe and
Delphi allow their subscribers to send and receive e-mail to and from other
internet addresses. They also provide access to Usenet newsgroups - there
are around 10,000 Usenet 'discussion groups' on the internet. And CIX and
Delphi provide access to a special IP (Internet Protocol) prompt.
This means users can search for files on remote computers and upload or
download files from other computers connected to the internet using file
transfer protocol (ftp) via the on-line service.
At present however, the commercial on-line services in Britain stop short of
providing 'full' internet access. In particular they do not provide access
to one of the most exciting areas of the internet - the World-Wide Web.
Since its creation in 1992 the World-Wide Web has become the fastest-growing
internet service, with more than 3,000 Web sites and tens of thousands of
documents published by academic institutions, companies and governments.
But to access the Web, the fledgling cybernaut needs a direct internet
connection - available from a specialised telecommunications company, called
an internet service provider. Direct internet access also involves running a
communications program called a TCP/IP stack (the internet's networking
protocol) and setting up for full direct access to the Internet can be
tricky.
Fortunately, however, internet service providers have begun to provide
software - or make it available for downloading. For many new users this may
be a key factor in choosing a service provider.
