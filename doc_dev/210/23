Virtual Reality could be the next clacker ball craze (though considerably
more expensive), the next electric car, or the successor to television.
There is a tremendous amount of talk about this 'three dimensional
experience' developed by chaps in the computer and computer games
businesses, but very little on offer to the public. Horizon (8.10 BBC2)
investigates, promising that 'Sir Michael Hordern is tour guide to the
electronic frontier of cyberspace'. Hmm.
Channel 4 aims to show what private investigators are really like in
Watching The Detectives (9.00), a five-part series using verite techniques
to record the activities of three American gumshoes and two British. Today's
subject is a former jockey who repossesses cars, follows a woman whose
husband is suspicious, and tracks down cut-price kitchen units.
With its eye on the local elections on May 2, Panorama (9.40 BBC1) has a
studio debate about the future of local government. To mark the 70th
birthday of Satyajit Ray, Channel 4 has mounted a season of his films,
prefaced tonight (11.00) by a documentary in which Shyam Benegal interviews
Ray and shows extracts from many of his works.
