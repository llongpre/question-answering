Amsterdam's Digital City - The power of communications

Far removed from the canals, bicycles and red light districts of Amsterdam,
thousands of Digital City residents are glued to their computer screens,
experiencing a life of lonesome sociability.
In a world of computer-based communication, they are meeting other computer
owners in electronic 'cafes', sending messages to mailboxes in the system's
'post office', or hovering in the 'main square', on the off-chance they
might meet someone interesting.
Amsterdam's Digital City was launched in January as a three-month project to
stimulate electronic communication and provide equal and widespread access
to information. But its sponsors, including the city and national
government, have been surprised by its popularity. The three-month timescale
has long since been abandoned, and the programme is about to take into
service a much bigger computer to handle a flood of 'immigrants'.
The city offers databanks, message groups and bulletin boards, similar to
those available on the global Internet system, but more compact and far less
daunting, and in Dutch, rather than English.
Residents can hook electronically into services, such as Urban Desires, a
computer basket described as an interactive magazine of metropolitan
passions. They can wander imaginary corridors, meeting fellow
metro-travellers, on their way to more than 100 metro stops created by local
computer buffs. Or they can drop in on one of the 'buildings' rented in the
para-city by organisations such as the Amsterdam tourist office, the Anne
Frank Foundation and the University of Amsterdam, to collect information or
ask questions.
Most residents enter the city from their offices or homes, using their own
computers, modems and telephones. But there are also tariff-free computer
terminals available at Amsterdam city hall, the public library and De Balie,
an avante-garde cafe that is the spiritual birthplace of the city.
Once in, users are greeted with messages declaring: 'You are the 1,757th
user today and the 45,341th this month.' This is an incentive for some, but
a deterrent for others. 'This city is becoming much too crowded,' complains
one computer resident after failing repeatedly to log on for lack of
available telephone and computer space.
To a first-time visitor, the city can be a bewildering fusion of high-tech
communication, old-fashioned chat and channel-surfing through television
channels by remote control. It is a bit like ham radio, except that the
voices have been replaced by words flashing by on the computer screen and
the crackle of radio frequency static has made way for the silent hum of the
computer-modem connection.
The city is populated by characters calling themselves 'Daydreamer', 'Nini'
and 'Tulip'. Much on-line 'talk' in the cafes is quick-paced but banal. For
example, one participant announces that he's just bought some croissants,
another types in 'yummy'.
By contrast, those taking part in electronic discussions about politics or
society are more high-minded. One heated exchange touched upon the
democratic credentials of those running the project and centres on the right
of the poor and those without computer equipment to take an active part in
'Amsterdam'.
Digital Amsterdam was launched to make computer communication a low-cost
reality for all citizens of the real Amsterdam, by providing access to the
network for the price of a local telephone call. However, the need for extra
cash has raised the possibility that commercial businesses will be
encouraged to rent 'buildings' in the city where they can ply their trade.
One objector to this proposal ends a digital outpouring with warnings of
totalitarianism and a parting shot from Voltaire: 'It's dangerous to be
right when the government is wrong.'
The Digital Citizens' Rights Movement of the Netherlands, contributes to the
on-line discussion about commercial sponsorship with a warning that
'governments and businesses must not be allowed to run the show'.
For others, even the price of a local phone call threatens to undermine the
birth of a true digital democracy. 'In Santa Monica, California, even the
homeless can take part in discussions on the local Freenet,' one Amsterdam
resident says.
A few hours in the city are enough to leave the reassuring ' if sometimes
depressing ' impression that people in the dawning world of virtual cities
and computer communication are ultimately very much like the people who once
sent messages by homing pigeons.
There is humour, intolerance, rudeness and honesty, in roughly equal
measure. There is also no lack of controversy.
Although firm figures are hard to come by, the regular residents estimate
that as many as 90 per cent of the city's inhabitants are men. They tend to
be aged between 15 and 30 and like to stay up late. As in the real
Amsterdam, the Digital City comes to life after 10pm.
Digital Amsterdam is also quite anonymous. You may be talking to a man who's
using a woman's name, or vice versa, and no one can tell. 'Often, an Astrid
is in reality a Willem,' says Hanneke Vermeulen, a systems operator of the
computer-based network.
This anonymity means that the Digital City-dweller need never be shy to
strike up a conversation with a stranger. At least in the beginning, people
in cyberspace can hide behind their fictitious names if they want, only
letting down their guard when they have developed a rapport with a new name
on the system.
Of course, there is no reason why two residents of Digital Amsterdam could
not arrange to meet at a real cafe in the real Amsterdam. But surprisingly,
perhaps, long-time residents say this does not happen often. 'It's easier
when you don't have to meet up face to face,' one regular at the computer
'pub' confesses. 'The person you've come to know through the screen can be
disappointing when he's sitting across from you.
