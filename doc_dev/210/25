<TEXT>
Inspired by the Weekend FT's article on 'cyberspace', the free-floating
electronic community created by computer users all round the world, one
colleague has made a nasty discovery.
Electronic communication is even more cliche-ridden than the old-fashioned
kind.
Cyber-correspondents rejoice in turning their most frequently used cliches
into acronyms. Messages are spattered with jargon like GMTA ('Great minds
think alike'), IMHO ('in my humble opinion'), which must have them ROTFL
('rolling on the floor laughing'). There is even an electronic counterpart
to the letter writer's SWALK ('sealed with a loving kiss') - NIFOC ('naked
in front of computer').
