FT  06 JUN 94 / Media Futures: New billboard on the highway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mecklermedia, a US technology publishing group, last week launched
'MecklerWeb', an electronic communications and marketing system aimed at
businesses that want to have a 'corporate presence' on the Internet.
For Dollars 25,000 per year, MecklerWeb will provide companies with a
billboard on the electronic highway; a place to present their product
information, corporate messages and news.
This is unlikely to cause offence in the anti-advertising culture of the
Internet, however, because the group will not distribute promotional
materials. Instead it will provide a commercial catalogue that users may
choose to browse at will.
'Cyberspace is not a mass market,' says Christopher Locke, president of
MecklerWeb. 'You don't have to target audiences, they self select. The real
opportunity here is not traditional advertising, but rather a new method of
building business relationships and achieving market presence.' MecklerWeb
will be organised into broad topical areas of interest such as law,
medicine, sports and technology. Within each, sub-groups and specialties
will be arranged in an hierarchical structure. As well as the corporate
information, MecklerWeb intends to create discussion groups that could lure
potential customers. The group is inviting professional associations to
serve as 'hosts' to the various subject areas, moderating discussions and
organising multimedia content. Such groups will receive a share of the fees
paid by companies that participate.
