<LEADPARA>  Biologists have learned to harness viruses to create vaccines and, in recent
years, to reprogram faulty chromosomes by using viruses to smuggle new genes
into cells.;   Now a small but growing group of computer scientists is
examining the possibility of designing computer viruses and similar programs
called worms to burrow into computer networks and set in motion a whole range
of beneficial activities.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Many computer users have been the victims of malicious virus programs
propagating through networks and erasing data or causing the whole system to
fail. But now some researchers are suggesting it is possible to harness the
subtle power of computer viruses to perform useful tasks.;   They imagine
self-propelled programs gliding through a network of hundreds of thousands of
computers, automatically updating software, diagnosing hardware problems,
seeking out information stored in vast data banks or doing routine garbage
collection -- mopping up the residue of leftover calculations that can clog up
memory banks.;   "Although malicious viruses certainly must be brought under
control, it is also imperative that the fear of viruses not keep computer
scientists from exploring the many benefits they could bestow," Fred Cohen,
the scientist who coined the term "computer viruses," wrote in the current
issue of The Sciences, published by the New York Academy of Sciences.;   Some
computer security experts scoff at the idea. Eugene Spafford of Purdue
University says he is not opposed in principle to computer virus research. But
the experts argue that in a world increasingly dense with computer networks,
software designers must rethink the potential hazards of releasing autonomous
programs into the electronic milieu.;   "It's just as if we're doing
biological research," Spafford said. "We wouldn't encourage somebody to work
on recombinant DNA in their garage.";   The power of computer viruses for
constructive and destructive uses is growing. In May, for example, the U.S.
Army Signals Warfare Division issued a $550,000 contract for research into the
study of viruses as military weapons.;   Cohen was one of the first academic
researchers to openly study computer viruses. As a graduate student at the
University of California, Los Angeles, he conducted experiments showing that
viruses could be as useful as they are dangerous.;   But when he set loose a
virus to demonstrate to campus administrators that their systems were
vulnerable, their response was to shut their machines to further experiments.;
  In his article, Cohen described a virus-based bill-collecting program he has
invented. In a traditional bill collector, a single program, often cumbersome
and complex, monitors all accounts and sends out overdue notices.;   In
Cohen's system, a simple virus program is spawned each time a customer makes a
transaction. Every month, the virus checks to see what its customer owes and
dispatches a bill. Once the account is settled, the collector deletes itself.;
  Useful as such devices might be, other experts are uneasy about the idea of
distributed systems, in which friendly viruses wander through a network,
performing maintenance chores or borrowing computer time here and there to
solve especially difficult problems.;   Spafford says there is always an
ethical question raised when a program is written to run on somebody else's
computer.;   "There is no easy answer to this problem," said Peter Neumann, a
computer security expert at SRI International research center in Menlo Park.
"Distributed computing has enormous potential, but you can use it
destructively. It's a two-edged sword.";   Computer viruses actually started
out as helpers rather than invaders. The precursor of modern software viruses
and worms is probably a simple game called Darwin, invented in 1962 by two
Bell Laboratories computer scientists, Doug McIlroy and Victor Vyssotsky.;  
The two researchers designed a game in which programs competed within the
computer's memory. The winner was the one that could kill all its opponents by
erasing them.;   In 1981 at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, John Shoch and
Jon Hepp wrote a series of computer programs that would scurry around the
laboratory's network performing helpful tasks. They named their programs worms
after similar programs that had been described in a science-fiction novel.;  
One of their most powerful programs was called a vampire worm. It was designed
to hide until the human users had left for the night and then come to life and
parcel out a large calculation to computers all over the network.;   In the
morning, as the computers were reclaimed, the vampire program would shrink
away and wait until the machines were freed again the next evening.;  
Carrying the biological metaphor even further, scientists today are
experimenting with systems to create software too complex to be designed by
humans, using a type of Darwinian evolution instead. They start with a seed
program that changes slightly each time it runs. Most of these random
mutations don't help, but every once in a while the system hits upon a slight
improvement. After millions of these tiny adaptations, a complex program is
born.  </TEXT>
