THE VIRTUAL COMMUNITY by Howard Rheingold Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 16.99, 25
pages
Three years ago, Senator Al Gore's High performance Computing Act was signed
into law by President Bush. It outlined Gore's vision for 'highways of the
mind' to be mapped by federal research and development and brought to
citizens by private enterprise. Like the railways in the 19th- and the
telephone system in the 20th-century, there is a technological revolution
afoot which stretches wherever a computer can be linked to others via
satellite. The global village is becoming a global desk.
Howard Rheingold has written another first-rate book on computer technology.
In 1991 his Virtual Reality was a clear, comprehensive guide to the
technical and moral issues surrounding the three-dimensional computer-made
worlds we are making in research, business and entertainment.
Now, Rheingold has done the same for computer networks in The Virtual
Community. Using a communication programme and a telephone line, Rheingold
is a world electronic citizen, in touch with thousands of others through a
series of local and interconnecting networks which reaches from home in
California to wherever there is anyone to speak to him.
He calls it The Net, an informal term for the coterie of computer networks
using computer-mediated commun-ications to link people around the world into
public discussions; there is a directory called The Matrix (John Quarterman,
1990); and the shared computer space-time in which networkers communicate is
called Cyberspace, broadly speaking, an electronic version of an
18th-century coffee house. Rheingold envisages an 'online metropolis' where
you make friends (irrespective of race, creed, colour, gender or capability)
according to shared interests rather than chance proximity.
Rheingold has chapters on his own local network in San Francisco, on daily
life in cyberspace, on pornographie in the Parisian Minitel system, and on
online activism in the computer hacking community. He offers printouts of
online discussions, and assembles a credible picture of what it means to
spend two hours a day on a computer talking to other people. His light
liberal touch guides the book through electronic activism and
'Disinformacy', drawing on McLuhan, Habermas, Foucault and Bentham. It makes
a stimulating read. The style is lucid and the issues lively.
Rheingold makes big promises: the Net - 'an ecosystem of subcultures' - will
change our perceptions of ourselves, offer the chance of 'many to many'
communication (opposed to TV's 'few to one'), and alter our models of
representative democracy. Some of these may be partially true for the
computer-literate. The larger questions are those of ownership and control.
The world's first Network was the US Defense Department Advance Research
Projects Agency's ARPANET, designed in the 1970s to allow researchers to
operate computers at a distance.
The Net is fast, cheap, widely available and, commercially and politically,
up for grabs. It breaks down the boundaries between professional and amateur
by making information accessible to a range of people; universities are
already reverting to the 18th century by recognising they have no monopoly
on academic and intellectual property, and the Net will push that
development further, undermining institutions based merely on knowledge.
What emerges from Rheingold's excellent book is a range of information and
issues shaped for the non-specialist; it is deftly written and scrupulously
precise. Rheingold makes space for his wry wit and his social concerns.
Secker and Warburg have yet to publish Virtual Community electronically; it
should be available online within a decade or so.
