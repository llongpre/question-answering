It was almost exactly a year ago that Rob Lord and Jeff Patterson, a couple
of Californian computer science students, launched their digital jukebox,
IUMA, alias the Internet Underground Music Archive.
IUMA has since used the Internet to send samples of alternative rock music
everywhere, from Arizona to Australia. It charges each band of musicians
Dollars 20 to Dollars 75. Listeners tune in for free. All they need is
access to the Internet to download the music on to their computer sound
cards before transfering it to an ordinary cassette.
Lord and Patterson are cyber-buffs who used their skills and a Dollars
20,000 computer system to reach out to fellow music fans. Their concept has
since been copied by hundreds of other digital jukeboxes all over the world,
and is attracting the attention of the multinationals that dominate the
Dollars 30.4bn music industry. The major record companies now recognise that
digital diffusion is a serious phenomenon that will, eventually, account for
a significant chunk of music distribution. What they do not know is how
quickly it will take off - or how to approach it.
'We're working in the dark,' says Sara John, director of legal affairs for
the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in London. 'There's no doubt that at
some stage digital diffusion will become a major part of the music market.
My personal opinion is that it could happen very, very quickly.'
At present the industry is in the unenviable position of not knowing whether
digital diffusion is a golden opportunity to boost profits, or a threat to
its financial stability. The global music market is dominated by six
companies - Sony, Time Warner, Matsushita, Bertelsmann, Thorn-EMI and
Polygram.
If a compact disc sells for Pounds 12.99 in the UK, the artist earns 88p,
the producer 44p, the publisher 44p and the manufacturer Pounds 1.05. The
retailer takes Pounds 3.25 and the record company Pounds 4.66 (mostly to
cover distribution costs), leaving Pounds 2.27 for VAT.
This means that if a record company can deliver a compact disc directly to
the consumer's home, it will save the chunk of the Pounds 4.66 previously
spent on distributing it to the record shop and the retailer's Pounds 3.25.
In short, it will be able to sell the same product for the same price much
more profitably.
Such calculations have encouraged the major groups to dabble in digital
diffusion. Warner Bros, part of the Time Warner group, now offers on-line
access to some of its recordings through America Online and CompuServe, the
US on-line services.
Geffen Records, a Matsushita subsidiary, also releases material on
CompuServe. This summer it became the first major record company to produce
a CD-Rom game. Geffen joined with Jasmine Multimedia, a small Californian
software house, to create Vid Grid, a visual jigsaw that enables the user to
assemble videos from artistes including Red Hot Chili Peppers, Aerosmith and
Jimi Hendrix.
These projects are still seen as experiments. The current generation of
on-line music services is not sophisticated enough for mainstream use. It
can take as long as 15 minutes to download a three-minute song from IUMA on
the Internet. The sound quality is patchy (more like FM radio than compact
disc) and the visuals limited to black and white.
Some of the new digital diffusers - such as pHreak, a dance music format run
by Intermedia, a multimedia consultancy in London - deliver their services
by computer modem rather than the Internet. This means that pHreak has a
more limited market than the Internet's web of 25m users, but it can make
the most of the vivid colours and sharp definition offered by computer
graphics.
The Internet will become progressively more efficient. Digital junkies will
also soon be able to transfer music to compact discs, rather than cassettes,
with the launch of recordable video-CDs. The expansion of digital cable
radio, now a fledgling medium in the US and UK which relays dozens of
specialist music stations to the home on cable TV connections, will provide
another digital delivery system.
Each home could eventually have its own 'virtual record shop'. The viewer
would be able to order an album by remote control via a digital cable box
fitted to the TV set, pay for it by credit card and record it on to a
compact disc, rather than buying it from a retailer.
However, there is a risk that, rather than benefiting from digital
diffusion, the record companies will be marginalised by it. At present,
their major artistes need them to secure access to their vast retail
distribution systems. If digital diffusion became a major medium, the
artistes might be tempted to break away and handle their own distribution.
There is also the threat that digital diffusion will continue to develop in
its current fragmented form as an underground movement with devastating
consequences for the music industry's revenue.
The first wave of digital diffusers are effectively pirate operations. They
should, in theory, be licensed to 'sell' music by the appropriate industry
authority, such as the UK's Performing Right Society (PRS). They should also
pay royalties to that authority and the record company. Otherwise they could
simply buy one compact disc and send it to be copied by thousands of
subscribers.
The PRS estimates that 'literally hundreds' of on-line services have
surfaced in the UK this year. So far it has been approached by only three
and has licensed one, Cerberus, which received official sanction last week.
'We're not Luddites,' says David Uwemedimo, head of legal affairs. 'We
encourage new technology within the regulatory system. We want to find a
fair way for these new services to pay for their music. We're still working
on it.'
Time is running out. The BPI's research suggests that once people have
access to on-line services such as digital cable radio, their expenditure on
compact discs and cassettes declines dramatically.
'Record companies have historically made a lot of money from distribution
and if they don't act quickly they could lose it,' said Ms John. 'The
problem is that, as usual, technology is moving much faster than the law -
and the industry's process of thought.'
