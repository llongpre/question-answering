<LEADPARA>  When John Walker and some fellow computer programmers launched Autodesk Inc.
in 1982, they had a clear plan for every aspect of the business except one:
the products.;    Walker figured that with top-flight programming talent and
the voracious demand for software spurred by the success of the International
Business Machines Personal Computer, the company could just try a bunch of
things and hope one of them worked.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AUTODESK SEEKS TO DIVERSIFY DIVERGENTLY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     And one of them, a computer-aided design package called AutoCAD, not only
worked but became one of the most successful software products in history.
Sausalito-based Autodesk earned a remarkable $43.6 million on sales of $175.6
million for the nine months ended Oct. 31, and AutoCAD has spawned a $1
billion industry of software developers, equipment vendors and dealers devoted
to making personal computers better tools for designing everything from houses
to helicopters.;    But now, Autodesk faces the dicey task of proving that it
is not just another one-trick pony in an industry that already has a string of
them. And in trying to move beyond near-total dependence on a single product
-- a goal that has eluded most software powerhouses, including Lotus
Development, Ashton-Tate and Wordstar International -- Autodesk has set out in
pursuit of some esoteric technologies that most established companies won't go
near.;    Though Autodesk's diversification strategy differs dramatically from
the acquisition-oriented approach of Lotus and other companies, it must
overcome the same basic problem.;    "Software companies get mesmerized by
their market niche," says John Rossi, a software analyst at Robertson,
Stephens &amp; Co., a San Francisco investment bank. "All their efforts are very
focused, very specialized, so it's hard to send the whole thing down a
different track.";    But if any software company is in a position to do
things differently, it might be idiosyncratic Autodesk. Founded as a
cooperative, Autodesk never accepted venture capital funding, and it thrives
on an informal, egalitarian management style.;    Alvar J. Green, the modest
and cheerful British native who serves as chairman and chief executive,
occupies his post because Walker and the other company founders prefer to
focus on programming.;    "It's not as if I tell people what to do or
anything," he says. "You have to rally people around an idea here.";    It is
fitting, perhaps, that Autodesk's brand of consensus management has yielded an
approach to new markets consistent with Walker's original theory: Try a few
things and see what works. "We're looking for technologies that have unlimited
upside potential, but where we know what the downside will be," Green says.;  
 The company even launched a new-business development unit last month and
invited "interesting project concepts and business plans from any legitimate
source.";    Thus far, Autodesk has identified a handful of such technologies.
The most mainstream of them is multimedia computing, the integration of sound
and video into the personal computer. Many personal computer companies expect
multimedia to be a major growth area in the future, and Autodesk has set up a
new division to market its multimedia products, which so far have met with
limited success.;    On the more daring side is Xanadu, conceived some 20
years ago by computer visionary Ted Nelson as a new way of navigating through
a forest of information. In a Xanadu "hypertext" data base, the information --
including text, video or any other type of data -- would be linked
conceptually by the system, allowing the user to skip freely from one
information source to another without using keyword searches and other
traditional data-base methods.;    Xanadu Operating Co., based in Palo Alto,
had struggled for years to get a product out the door, and few in the business
took it seriously. But Autodesk did and purchased the company in 1988 for an
undisclosed sum.;    Malcolm L. Davies, Autodesk's senior vice president for
marketing, jokes that when Xanadu products are finally shipped -- and the
current goal is sometime this year -- the company will apply to the Guinness
Book of World Records for the longest-running software development project in
history. But if Xanadu does succeed, the potential market is enormous, because
it will vastly simplify and humanize the task of finding information.;   
Similarly out on the edge is Autodesk's cyberspace, or artificial reality,
project. The concept, now being pursued by many large companies, is to create
a completely computer-generated environment. A current version includes a mask
with two small television screens and a set of electronic gloves; one can
actually navigate around a seemingly three-dimensional room and use one's
hands to pick up and move objects.;    Autodesk is aiming to produce a basic
artificial reality operating system, and then software developers would use it
to create "environments" for entertainment, physical fitness or education.
Such a system could also have links to AutoCAD, allowing an architect, for
example, to walk around inside a building that exists only as an AutoCAD
design.;    "It's a simulation technique that complements AutoCAD," said
project director Randal Walser. "We believe an industry is about to emerge."; 
  Autodesk has also purchased minority interests in several small software
companies with interesting product concepts and last year acquired a
competitor in the low-end computer-aided design business. But even with $150
million in cash, Autodesk is not interested in buying established companies to
get into mainstream software markets, such as word processing or spreadsheets.
That is in distinct contrast to other big software companies, such as Lotus,
Ashton-Tate and Wordstar, which have tried -- and mostly failed -- to
diversify by acquiring going businesses.;    To meet its goal of gaining only
half its revenues from computer-aided design products within five years -- the
figure is currently over 90 percent -- Autodesk will need new businesses that
generate hundreds of millions a year.;    Scott Cook, president of Intuit
Software, suggests another, more disquieting reason that software companies
tend to be dependent on one product.;    "They got lucky the first time
around," he suggests. "Instead of victory through internal process and people
doing things right, they got lucky, got there first and got a dominant share."  </TEXT>
