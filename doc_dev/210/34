storage - Raid

RAID stands for 'redundant array of inexpensive discs,' a term coined by
computer scientists at the University of California in 1987 and now
increasingly embodied in disc storage products for systems of all sizes.
However, significant advances in disc technology since 1987 have complicated
the RAID argument just as manufacturers are expanding their RAID offerings
from office systems into the mainframe computer market.
The original research aimed to ease a problem caused by increases in
computer speed. Processors were held back by the time it took to access data
stored on electro-mechanical discs systems.
So researchers replaced a single large disc with several smaller ones.
Performance improved, because several drives were working simultaneously on
recording or retrieving a piece of information.
However, increasing the number of discs also heightened the risk of failure
of the total system. Traditional mass storage discs (known as SLED for
'single large expensive discs') were far more reliable than the 5.25-inch
disc drives of 1987, which typically broke down once every 25,000 hours:
this meant that an array of 10 would hit a problem every 14 weeks.
The researchers therefore built in redundancy, so that a problem in one
drive would not bring down the entire system. They specified what they
called five RAID levels, later expanded to seven. Some have been largely
discarded because of their impact on performance.
TWO BROAD TYPES
The RAID levels fall into two broad types: one involves recording all data
simultaneously on two discs, so that one is an exact copy of the other. This
is known as disc mirroring or shadowing. Data retrieval is faster than on
single discs because data is retrieved from both discs at once. If one disc
fails, the system continues without interruption, because all the data is
still available.
The other RAID technique is known as striping: here data is recorded, or
'striped,' across the array of discs. If one disc fails, the system can work
out the lost data by performing arithmetic on check digits stored with
related data on the other discs.
In some RAID striping levels the check data is stored on a disc of its own.
Recovering the lost data can take 20 minutes or more in a big system and,
while the recovery is going on, the performance of the overall system is
significantly affected.
Side benefits of RAID systems include the fact that they use less power and
generate less heat than traditional large disc drives. They also occupy less
floor space: the disc drives, typically placed on top of each other, are
standard 3.5 or 5.25-inch units found in personal computers, compared with
the traditional big discs measuring up to 14 inches.
Most RAID suppliers have focused initially on networked PCs and business
minicomputers, typically Unix machines and the IBM AS/400. Supplier
Hewlett-Packard says the PC market in particular is receptive to the RAID
idea.
'PC users expect disc drives to fail and are accustomed to cheap,
low-capacity, keep-a-couple-of-spares-handy units,' the company says.
'They are also likely to see disc drives, like PCs, as commodities and buy
on this basis rather than worrying about a quality system from a big-name
supplier.
'In addition, PC data tends not to get backed up regularly: the network is
typically a part-time responsibility for one person in the office. Users
therefore see RAID offering protection against failure and reducing the need
for back-up.'
Most manufacturers are only just launching RAID products in the mainframe
market, partly because here the PC arguments are all reversed.
Computing managers expect disc systems to have high reliability, capacity
and performance; they also have specialists whose jobs include regular
back-ups.
However, EMC Computer Systems, which has been in the mainframe market since
1990 with a RAID level one disc mirroring system, believes that disc
technology has progressed so quickly that debates about which RAID levels
are best have become irrelevant.
The company supports its case by pointing to the fact that after three years
it has become the third biggest supplier of mainframe disc storage, with a
15 per cent market share. EMC director Mr David Facer says that the
reliability of small discs has leapt to between 0.5m and 0.8m hours between
failures.
Simultaneously, capacities of these discs have increased from 200 megabytes
(1m characters) when the RAID research was being done to 2,000 megabytes or
more today. These figures mean that an array of 10 discs, equalling the
capacity of a single big mainframe disc drive, should only break down only
once every six to nine years. Indeed, EMC is so confident about today's disc
drives that the RAID level one mirroring feature is merely an option: the
disc redundancy issue is removed altogether. Instead, EMC uses fast
electronic memory to provide fail-safe facilities. Such memory is
increasingly being built into disc systems to hold frequently-used data and
thus reduce the need to access electro-mechanical disc storage.
Studies from research firm IDC support Mr Facer when he argues that the
falling cost of disc drives has brought the price of mirrored systems down
to that of striped systems, especially when the extra costs and performance
overheads of controlling the striping are taken into account.
Demand for data storage is said to be growing at 40 per cent a year. As more
and more information goes on-line, demand for faster and faster access is
likely to increase.
As Mr Facer puts it: 'The issue isn't about RAID: it's about
high-performance reliable storage at the right price.'
