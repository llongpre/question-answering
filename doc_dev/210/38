THE COMPUTER software industry has been promising to change the way people
work for the past decade. Sceptics might suggest the aim has been achieved,
but only in terms of expense and frustrated users. Enter Groupware.
Groupware is a term coined to embrace programs for people working in teams.
It provides an infrastructure to co-ordinate individuals in the group, while
ensuring the concurrence of data relating to their work. Members of the
group can be scattered across continents. But when they turn to their
software environment, the very latest information from all involved is right
there.
Groupware offers a godsend to large organisations tackling the logistics of
teamwork. The concept has taken off, with Lotus Notes first on the beach.
Notes sits on one dedicated PC which serves up to 50 users. This central
core holds material which users summon up, seeing the latest change to the
project across the network. Lotus began selling Notes licences for batches
of 200 users upwards. The entry investment, at Pounds 200 per user, was
Pounds 40,000.
The appeal was dramatic, with blue chip companies buying licences by the
thousand. In the last 12 months the user base has grown exponentially. By
March 1992 Lotus had sold 117,000 licences worldwide. Industry sources
suggest that this figure now stands at 500,000.
Notes answers many administrative headaches. Use it for conferencing and it
boosts productivity by avoiding duplication of effort. A centrally held
diary can fix meetings in one shot, rather than the familiar round of phone
calls via secretaries requiring a dozen cancelled appointments before one
convenient day can be established.
But it does have limitations. The dedicated server must run IBM's OS/2
operating system which is greedy in terms of space on a machine and is
primarily established among very large corporate users. Each group hangs off
one server, but co-ordinating that server to others to form a constellation
of workgroups is not easy. A release for the Unix operating system, offering
vastly improved networking capabilities, is imminent.
Management consultants KPMG recently conducted a survey covering 10,000 UK
Notes users. The principal problem encountered was actual communication of
what Notes does. Within large organisations senior managers still have
reservations about whether Notes is worthwhile.
The computer industry can blame itself for this. Groupware arrived in a
blaze of jargon. Workflow, a term that has as many definitions as it has
adherents, is a typical Groupware spin-off. It refers to monitoring
individual effort and directing the user so as to optimise time and effort.
But the term is so imprecise that it serves to confuse.
To use Groupware, a company must be comfortable with team structures. There
is little point installing Notes if the users work in a fractious
environment. Groupware is suited to professional harmony.
But corporations that have embraced Notes have gone for it in a big way.
General Motors has bought nearly 30,000 licences for Notes, through its IT
arm, Electronic Data Systems. Mr Mike Thompson, an EDS manager attached to
GM in the UK, is impressed. 'It's been phenomenal. The user perception is
extremely positive.'
A typical GM application is shipping pictures of parts around across Europe
to ensure that they are produced exactly to their original specification.
And it is evidence of the quality of graphics with Notes.
GM is prepared to entrust Notes with a critical role in maintaining
engineering standards. But the GM world already consisted of a massive IT
infrastructure and the trained staff to use it. Mr Thompson warns that
without this investment Notes will not deliver. 'You must take account of
the support aspect. You do need a network in place.'
BP Oil employs Notes as the framework for its emergency response system. If
an oil leak occurs in Germany, staff across Europe consult Notes for site
plans, technical diagrams and up-to-the-minute strategies.
Notes maintains information on health and safety rules and their
implications for the oil sector on a system that can be accessed by BP staff
across the continent.
Lotus has certainly gained acceptance for Groupware with Notes. But there
are other products that do a similar job. Why has Lotus Notes emerged from
the PC world to eclipse steady performers like Verimation's Memo or the new
Co-operation program from NCR?
Mr Richard Lavender, a senior consultant at systems house Logica, describes
the rise of Notes as 'a confidence trick in the nicest possible way.' The
market presence of Lotus as a reputable supplier of PC software was
critical. 'People knew who Lotus were and they already had Lotus products
under their belt.' And the sales strategy of going straight for large users
has produced influential enthusiasts.
Verimation's Memo range grew out of an electronic mail system for Volvo. It
tends to thrive in mainframe environments where a lot of users need to pull
down and share corporate data. Mr Bruno Giversen, Verimation vice-president,
admits that both products have their strengths, and can be complementary.
'Memo is much cheaper, but rightly so because Notes has more database
facilities.'
Abbey National's new life insurance wing uses a mainframe based Memo system
to co-ordinate its PC environment. NCR's Co-operation ties together elements
of an existing IT infrastructure. The idea is to maintain the hardware
investment but control staff working locally within the overall wide area
network. It is a development environment that can be altered to suit
individual businesses, offering a shot at the elusive prize of 'competitive
advantage'.
National &amp; Provincial Building Society is implementing Co-operation to keep
documents flowing between teams. A typical price for a 100-user installation
would be Pounds 77,000.
Mr Kenny MacIver, a software analyst at International Data Corporation, has
made an exhaustive study of the mass migration to Notes. He concludes
Groupware is here to stay. 'Notwithstanding its obvious limitations, Notes
is a glimpse of the future. Where there is a need to share data and
co-ordinate group activity, there's going to be a need for such a package.'
