<LEADPARA>  "It is quite a cloudy area," Harvard University professor Laurence Tribe says
of the troublesome intersection of cyberspace and the U.S. Constitution.;  
Tribe, one of the nation's foremost legal scholars, fears that constitutional
lines that have been meticulously drawn over two centuries -- protecting free
speech and free press, among other rights -- might "warp or vanish" when
stretched to cover the unwieldy realm of electronic reality.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Mapping "the text and structure of our Constitution onto the texture and
topography of cyberspace" promises to be one of the great constitutional
challenges of our times, he told the First Conference on Computers, Freedom
and Privacy, last March. The problem: In all of its acclaimed wisdom, the
Constitution "tends to carve up the social, legal and political universe along
the lines of physical place or temporal proximity." Cyberspace, on the other
hand, defies physical dimensions and time constraints.;   Is 27th amendment
needed?; "These are things that have not been thoroughly ventilated or
litigated," Tribe says. Although the First Amendment should prove adequate in
resolving these issues, a 27th amendment legally configuring cyberspace isn't
out of the question, he adds.;   Meanwhile, more computer network users
believe their rights have been abused and more network purveyors feel they've
been miscast as Bill of Rights villains. At the heart of the debate is the
distinction between the private and public nature of electronic bulletin
boards and the computer networks that host them.;   What's subject to
censorship; A publicly supported network, one subsidized by tax dollars for
instance, would be subject to constitutional guarantees, says Lance Rose, a
New York attorney specializing in high-technology law who is revising the
coming edition of "SYSLAW: The System Operator's Legal Guide." But in the
privately owned networks, "users sign on with a contract, and there is no
constitutional freedom of speech, so censorship in those cases is perfectly
legal . . . at least that's how it looks at this juncture.";   But as private
networks "increasingly occupy larger public roles," Tribe said, "in terms of
legal doctrine that has been evolving since the 1970s . . . the user could
assert First Amendment rights against the network or system.";   One view
contends that the electronic arena already has taken on public powers of
virtual "governments." Inasmuch as the networks "create their own rules of
admission and access and expulsion," says Tribe, and even operate beyond
international boundaries and the laws of some nations, they may be outgrowing
their private status and ripening for regulation, just as the Federal
Communications Commission regulates television and radio broadcasts.;   "If
you get too public, you do have the government involved, and First Amendment
concerns would rise to the surface," Rose says. "If it is a public message or
information system, then it starts to look like a "geographic public place."
And, as we know, there are (constitutional) provisions for people to have free
speech in public places.";   One precedent is the Supreme Court's 1980
Pruneyard Shopping Center decision that upheld freedom of speech at a public
gathering place even though it was a privately owned shopping mall in
Campbell.;   "It is hard to say if anything in the bulletin-board world has
reached that level, where it is private but somehow takes on a public
quality," Rose says. "Possibly in the future, large systems will gain that
status.";   Analogies for computer networks don't stop at shopping malls.
Depending on who's making the comparison, they've ranged from soapboxes to
bookstores to Swiss banks. Prodigy executives liken their role to that of a
newspaper editor who doesn't print every article submitted and edits letters
to be published.;   "It is called editorial discretion," argued a Prodigy
spokesman in a New York Times commentary piece responding to criticism of the
network's silencing last year of rebellious users. "And it does not limit
speech in any constitutional sense.";   Most network managers are at least
comfortable, if not satisfied, with that model. Cliff Figallo, managing
director of The Well, a Sausalito-based network, says, "Most of the legal
conjecture at this point guesses it would be treated the same as the print
media, and we try to play it safe in that regard. We are tempted to press some
of these legal issues, but we feel we are more valuable being on-line than
off-line in court.";   But Rose says even that seemingly logical model isn't
without contention: "It raises the concept of the press and freedom of the
press to a new level in American history."  </TEXT>
