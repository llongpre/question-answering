   The high-flying portable computer market will
soar to greater heights through the wizardry of notebook-sized
machines, tiny color screens and images that ``float,'' industry
experts predict.
   Not everyone goes so far as New York retailer James V. Cosby,
who flatly predicted Tuesday: ``They are going to replace
desktops.''
   But from one-pound ``palmtops'' to 20-pounders, there's no doubt
about the sales portables are racking up, or the attention they are
drawing at this year's Comdex convention, the world's biggest
computer show.
   The overall personal computer market is growing about 10 percent
a year. But sales of portables are expected to triple that growth
rate for the next three years, and sales of machines in the
8{-by-11-inch ``notebook'' format will more than quadruple,
predicted Tim Bajarin, executive vice president of Creative
Strategies International and a leading Silicon Valley consultant.
   About 300,000 portables were shipped in the United States in
1983, the first year true portables were available, he said at a
panel discussion.
   Bajarin expects shipments of 1.4 million this year and 2.5
million by 1992.
   Perhaps hottest of all at the show are Compaq Computer Corp.'s
six-pound, notebook-size LTE and LTE286 machines. They are the
first of their size to accept 3{-inch floppy disks which are now
standard for desktop computers.
   Compaq officials say their new models are more convenient than
other machines which use tiny memory cards or smaller disks _
although makers of other models contend the cards are tomorrow's
technology.
   Compaq officials say they have struggled to meet demand in the
month since they introduced the two machines. The LTE begins at
about $2,400. The LTE286, which runs on a faster 80286
microprocessor, lists for $3,900 to $5,000.
   Among the competing high-performance notebook-size computers are
the Toshiba T1000SE and NEC's Ultralite, a pioneer when it was
introduced a year ago. The Ultralite weighs just 4.4 pounds, has a
bigger screen than the LTE's, and costs about the same. Storage of
information is on memory cards.
   Also hot are the one-pound mini-machines known as palmtops or
breast pocket computers. Atari's Portfolio, which operates on two
AA batteries for 48 hours, fits in a jacket pocket and sells for
$400. Not intended to rival its bigger and more expensive cousins,
it has five simple built-in programs.
   At about $2,000, Poqet Computer Corp.'s palmtop offers a bigger
screen and keyboard, all within the tiny package.
   ``Our computer now uses about the same amount of power as a
single Christmas tree twinkle light,'' meaning it can run for 100
hours on two AA alkaline batteries, said Poquet's president, Stave
Prodromou.
   Near the other extreme is Dolch Computer Systems' ``portable''
that uses Intel's new 80486 microprocessor _ the hottest, most
powerful chip in the world for personal computers.
   The industrial-looking Dolch weighs nearly 20 pounds, but the
company says it can compete in performance with very high-end
desktop computers and work stations. Its price is hefty, too: about
$13,000 to $18,000.
   Also on display was a laptop called Gridpad. It uses a pen-like
device to ``write'' on a document-sized screen, allowing forms to
be filled out and even signed on a computer screen.
   Cyberspace's laptop does away with a screen in favor of headgear
that projects a hologram-like image that seems to hang in the air
in front of the user. It's pitched as a boon for the
security-conscious; no one can look over your shoulder and see what
you're writing or reading.
