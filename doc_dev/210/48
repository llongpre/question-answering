AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecommunications company, has
formed an alliance with Novell, the leading supplier of computer networking
software, to develop and market products linking computer networks with
telephones.
Products resulting from the joint efforts will 'bring the power of
computer-telephone integration to desktop comp-uters,' the companies said
yesterday.
They aim to help businesses increase office productivity by integrating
existing telephone and computer networks to provide 'telephony services'.
Merged computer-telephone networks will eventually be accessible from all
types of desktop computers, the companies added.
The first product, called a 'telephony server NetWare loadable module', will
link Novell's popular NetWare computer networks with AT&amp;T's Definity
communications systems.
It will allow customers to use common telephone features, such as
auto-dialling, conference calling and message management, in combination
with information stored in their computer networks.
Users will be able to speed-dial numbers and take notes on their computers.
Notes from previous conversations will be available with each new call.
The companies also plan to develop products that integrate services such as
electronic mail, facsimile and voice mail.
Mr Ray Noorda, Novell president and chief executive, said: 'Telephony
services are a powerful combination of technologies which will benefit
customers by providing integration between their existing voice and data
networks.
'The technology will simplify management and pave the way for delivery of
many new services.'
Mr Jerre Stead, president of AT&amp;T Global Business Communications Systems,
said: 'The market for computer-telephone integration is expected to almost
double each year during the next five years as customers discover its
productivity benefits. We intend to be leaders in this emerging market.'
