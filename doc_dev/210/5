<LEADPARA>  As part of a national survey not long ago, an advertising agency asked
computer industry engineers and managers about their favorite leisure
activities.;   Among those who responded, reading (18 percent) was by far the
most popular choice, with golf (5 percent) a distant second.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     So, without drawing any conclusions from the data, here are some
suggestions for reading material and gifts:;   "Cyberspace: First Steps"
($24.95, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, Boston) is an anthology
of essays and musings on one of the most exciting, exotic and least understood
frontiers of computing. The term cyberspace refers to the ephemeral otherworld
that exists in the global electronic web of computer and communications
networks.;   Michael Benedikt, a professor of architecture at the University
of Texas and editor of the book, refers to cyberspace as an "elusive and
future thing," and it remains elusive at the conclusion of the book. Yet the
descriptions offered in the book are compelling. The writers work at companies
and institutions such as International Business Machines, Electronic Data
Systems, Texas Instruments, Bull Worldwide Information Systems, Stanford and
MIT.;   Nearer on the horizon, and also promising rewards for business, are
expert systems. "The Rise of the Expert Company" ($19.95, Times Books, New
York City), by artificial-intelligence experts Edward Feigenbaum, Pamela
McCorduck and H. Penny Nii, is subtitled "How Visionary Companies Are Using
Artificial Intelligence to Achieve Higher Productivity and Profits.";  
Artificial intelligence is one of those unfortunate terms that promises more
than it delivers. Computers are not yet "smart," but they can serve as
repositories for the collected wisdom and experience of senior executives.;  
Others, then, can extract the intelligence and apply it to problems that range
from product development and administration to manufacturing. A new breed of
computer experts called knowledge engineers is creating a form of artificial
intelligence known as expert systems.;   Expert systems allow companies, not
just individual executives, to work smarter, and among the companies profiled
are Du Pont, Fujitsu, Navistar, Northrop, Canon, IBM and American Express.;  
And then there is a book for executives and dreamers who are ready to go
beyond toe-dipping and take the plunge.;   "High-Tech Ventures, The Guide for
Entrepreneurial Success" ($29.95, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading,
Mass.), is by C. Gordon Bell, with John E. McNamara. Bell, a scientist and
engineer, worked 23 years as a research and development director at Digital
Equipment Corp. before becoming a principal in more than 20 high-tech start-up
companies. Some succeeded, some failed. The lessons from each are laid down
here.;   Anyone thinking of starting a high-tech company, or investing in one,
will find this book valuable. Bell dissects start-ups such as Ovation,
Analytica, Cirrus Logic, Thinking Machines, Apollo and Sun, with
behind-the-scenes insights into the heady world of high tech.;   "High-Tech
Ventures" concludes with a look ahead, and its predictions are provocative:
The United States will continue to lead the world in inventiveness; the
Japanese will dominate every market through their strength in innovation.;  
One area where American innovation may save the day is in computer
programming, especially in an emerging field known as object-oriented
programming.;   "Object Oriented Technology, a Manager's Guide" ($19.50,
Addison-Wesley, paperback), by David A. Taylor, is one of the first accessible
guides to the most important trend in software development. Taylor, a
management consultant, has a knack for explaining highly technical concepts in
a way that executives, managers and other non-programmers can grasp. The
simple diagrams and illustrations make it virtually painless.;  
Object-oriented programming (OOP) holds the promise of making it easier for
executives to get the data they need, and it promises to allow businesses to
construct software applications in a fraction of the time now needed. It does
so by using software "packets" that contain data and the instructions
necessary to act on the data.;   Only a few personal computer software
companies, notably Borland International Inc., are pursuing OOP relentlessly.  </TEXT>
