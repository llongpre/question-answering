<LEADPARA>  Ever since its founding in 1983, the marketing effort of Banyan Systems Inc.
was virtually inaudible. The software maker quietly provided large,
sophisticated customers with the products to link vast networks of personal
computers.;   Now Banyan is turning up the volume to seize market share from
Novell Inc., its much-better-known rival.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Twice as many vendors will now distribute Banyan's products, as the company
lays plans for going public next year and increases its visibility with a full
frontal attack on Novell. "Things They Don't Tell You at Novell
Presentations," a brassy new Banyan brochure announces.;   "They've
established a strong marketing presence for the first time in their history,"
said Robert Gill of the Gartner Group, a consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.
"They are now getting in the door to pitch their story.";   Banyan, based in
this suburb west of Boston, has only 7.5 percent of the $1.2 billion market
for network software. That is dwarfed by Novell, based in Provo, Utah, which,
by serving much smaller computer networks, has captured about 60 percent of
the market. Novell has annual sales of $700 million and the loyalty of the
nation's largest computer companies.;   Some industry consultants, like George
Colony of Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., believe Novell is simply too
strong a competitor for Banyan or any other seller of network software.;  
"Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Digital have all thrown their hats in with Novell's
Netware," Colony said, explaining that these companies have agreed to sell
Netware -- Novell's network software -- with their own products. "The game is
over.";   Others say that Banyan's technology has been too far ahead of its
time, and now that the world is ready for its products, it faces in Novell a
much more powerful marketer.;   David C. Mahoney, Banyan's president and chief
executive and one of its founders, remains undaunted. He delivers his sales
pitch with the vigor of an evangelist. Rather than compete directly with
Novell, he decided to concentrate on linking larger computer networks.;   "We
had a vision and didn't want to deviate from it," he said.;   Stressing
Banyan's 25 percent annual growth rate and 20 straight profitable quarters, he
noted that Banyan had successfully left the computer hardware business, which
just last year accounted for 50 percent of sales, to focus on the more
profitable sale of software.;   Mahoney expects Banyan to increase its sales
from $100 million to $500 million in just five years. Banyan, he said, has
staked out a critical niche, with the technical strengths to emerge as a
major, long-term competitor.;   One of Mahoney's most pressing tasks is
gaining credibility with many more corporate customers. To do that, Banyan,
which is privately held, will probably go public early in 1992.;   Mahoney
said that the company did not need the cash but that corporate customers
tended to be wary of private companies, and financial analysts ignored Banyan
while touting its competitors.;   Mahoney, 46, He founded Banyan with two
associates in 1983 -- one is now the technology chief, the other departed to
start his own software company. They named the company for a tropical tree
that drops vines that then grow their own roots.;   Banyan's problem today is
not Novell but Banyan itself, Mahoney said: It simply has not gotten its
message out. His solution was to bring in a new marketing chief last year,
James D'Arezzo, the former vice president of international marketing at Compaq
Computer Corp.;   The Marine Corps used Banyan's Vines software in the Persian
Gulf war to link 350 personal computers throughout the region -- transmitting
almost immediately the equivalent of 300 pages of orders that until recently
took hours to deliver electronically.;   Banyan's Vines system allows users to
find and communicate with each other in seconds -- a technically sophisticated
feature that Novell's Netware lacks.;   "If you use Novell's Netware with 500
users, it is very difficult to find the user you are looking for," said Frank
Michnoff, a consultant with the Meta Group in Westport, Conn. "Are you going
to scroll through 500 names? Not likely.";   Industry consultants say that
Banyan has 12 to 18 months before Novell comes out with its own improved
features for locating other users on a network.;   And Banyan boasts of its
coming counterattack: software that will allow many key features of Vines to
run on systems linked by Novell's Netware.  </TEXT>
