<LEADPARA>  TO MAKE WAR GAMES -- AND other computer games -- more realistic takes
technology. Here's where companies are putting their efforts to make your
computer simulation more like the real thing:;    SOUND. Coin-operated arcade
games have been playing alluring music and blitzing players with sound effects
for years. But the built-in speakers in most IBM PC and compatible computers
are wimpy creatures incapable of producing much recognizable sound. Made to
beep at you when you make a mistake, they can barely produce a simple melody
or digitized speech, even with special software.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The solution: make games compatible with add-in boards with names like
AdLib, Game Blaster and Sound Blaster; they cost about $150 and can recreate
far more realistic voices and music. Using them, players of Three-Sixty's
Harpoon can hear the roar of rocket engines each time their fleet launches a
cruise missile.;    For the serious game player, a digital synthesizer board
is the current ultimate in game audio. The same kind of device used by
professional musicians to control instruments by computer, the synthesizer can
make the computer sound like there's an orchestra inside.;    GRAPHICS.
Computer displays are improving faster than built-in sound, and games are
taking advantage of crisper displays at a rapid pace. Many new games won't
even work with older and cruder displays; they demand state-of-the-art VGA
displays that can show more colors and more detail.;    But most game makers
are beginning to concentrate on creating three-dimensional displays for their
games, increasing realism even more. The chief problem: Complex displays
require a lot of computing power. But the main market for computer games are
home computer users who don't tend to own state-of-the-art equipment.;   
CD-ROM. On the market for only a couple of years, the computer version of
audio compact disks -- called CD-ROM -- are practically unbreakable, don't
wear out, cost only $2 or so to replicate, and can hold the equivalent of
hundreds of floppy disks worth of data. That means game developers can use far
more graphics and sound effects, both of which require huge amounts of disk
space.;    It will still be a few years, though, before CD-ROM disk drives are
inexpensive enough -- and have enough games -- to make them attractive to home
buyers.;    "NETWORK" GAMES. Personal computer games generally are one-player
affairs with computer opponents, or with the computer simply acting as a
referee of sorts between the human player and a bunch of pre-programmed
enemies. Makers are looking at computer networks as the key to multi-player
games.;    Future games would be played by a variety of users connected over
telephone lines with computer modems. Your opponents will be your friends down
the street in their own living rooms or your colleagues down the hall at the
office. The concept can be expanded to political simulations, with each player
the head of state of a country, or even cooperative ventures.;    Users of
some commercial on-line services can already play games against other users,
although action can be limited because of the time it takes data to travel
between those computers over telephone lines. Local-area networks in offices
are much faster. And there are a few commercial efforts under way to develop
network game arcades where you can play combat games against other teams --
for about $1 a minute.;    VIRTUAL REALITY. The idea of virtual reality is to
create an computer "experience" as much like the real thing as possible.
Special goggles containing miniature computer screens would immerse the player
in the sights of the game. As your head turns, so does your view of the scene.
Wearing a flexible glove embedded with sensors, you can move by pointing and
even "pick up" objects you see. Three-dimensional sound, that moves as you
move your head and body, would help complete the experience.;    Eventually,
proponents say, you could experience a game with tactile feedback, perhaps
even computer-generated odors. There are even serious discussions among
researchers about how to create virtual realities where you can even have sex
with another player -- or even with a computer-generated one.;    But today
there are very few computer systems that can simulate even a crude sort of
virtual reality -- and they are extremely expensive. It's unlikely the
necessary hardware will be cheap enough for mass production for decades.  </TEXT>
