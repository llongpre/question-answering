<TEXT>  and Outrageous Evolution; of Economic Life; By William Irwin Thompson;
Doubleday, 159 pp., $20; CHEEZ Whiz sprayed out of an aerosol can onto a
Styrofoam potato chip, Cool Whip "smoothing out the absence of taste in those
genetically engineered monster strawberries" -- we eat these not so much
because they taste good, veteran author William Irwin Thompson suggests, but
because they are processed, and thus in a way sanctified, by our culture: "Any
peasant with a dumb cow can make whipped cream, but it takes a chemical
factory to make Cool Whip. . . . In America, even the food is a moon shot, a
fast-food rocket aimed away from Earth.";   Thompson first seems to be
romanticizing communities based on nature -- where people's destiny was
determined by blood ties or place of birth -- and demonizing those based on
culture: "noetic polities," or mind-managed environments. Illustrating how the
noise of modern life has become "the solvent of Renaissance individuality," he
visits places like EPCOT Center, nicknamed "Every Person Comes Out Tired" by
its employees because "EPCOT is not fun. It's serious business . . . every
sound bite and image you experience is programmed . . . every gigantesque
corporate pavilion seems to be saying to the little guy, 'Me Tarzan, you
Jane.' ";   But Thompson actually turns out to be rooting for Tarzan -- i.e.,
the United States. He supported the gulf war, for instance, because he
believes that by replacing territorial and blood ties with a single world
culture, we can eliminate ethnic wars. Ultimately, though, Thompson
overestimates America's capacity to "replace" nature, making the common
mistake of assuming that if technology is changing rapidly, human nature must
be too. Thus the current inability of Arabs and Jews to understand each other
is seen as stemming from the confusion of living in "the cyberspace of the CNN
electronic collage," when the inability, in fact, has an older name:
