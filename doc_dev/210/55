plans of W Industries, developer of virtual reality systems

STRAP ON three kilos of headgear in a few upmarket amusement arcades and you
can experience a crude form of virtual reality, an electronic simulation of
events.
But the race is on among a handful of companies around the world to develop
the next generation of equipment. This will not only be much smaller and
lighter but offer a big step up from a two-dimensional screen into
'immersive virtual reality' through which users will be able to participate
in the electronic world.
Bringing these sophisticated toys to consumers - particularly for use at
home - will create a large new sector in the global electronic games market.
Some US virtual reality analysts estimate that the VR market as a whole will
be worth Dollars 500m (Pounds 340m) within four years.
To help fund such expensive development, W Industries, a small UK company
with a leading technological edge in virtual reality, is planning to
announce today its intention to float on the London Stock Exchange later
this year and to change its name to Virtuality Group. Analysts believe the
flotation could raise Pounds 10m.
W Industries was founded by Mr Jonathan Waldern in 1988, following his
academic research in advanced computing programmes. By 1990 his company had
developed the world's first fully integrated virtual reality system.
Backed by Apax Partners, the venture capital company, its revenues have
moved from Pounds 102,000 in 1990 to Pounds 5.24m at the end of 1992. It has
now sold more than 360 of its virtual reality systems in 19 different
countries and is currently selling 20 units, at a retail price of between
Pounds 22,000 and Pounds 32,000 (plus VAT), each month.
Apax currently has about 67 per cent of the shares and the management 33 per
cent fully diluted, Apax having acquired its holding from Wembley Leisure.
Mr Waldern holds about 15 per cent of the company.
Mr David Payne, W Industries' chairman, says: 'Apax provided stable,
committed shareholding. Even at this stage Apax are not exiting, they are
staying in.'
Apax has so far seen no return because W Industries has not yet paid any
dividend. 'We don't plan to pay dividends in the short term because we want
to preserve our profits and inject them back into the business,' says Mr
Payne.
The purpose of the float, according to Mr Payne, 'is that we have an
enormous amount of intellectual property in the business. We believe that
virtual reality has a very explosive future ahead of it and we can't
continue to develop and package our intellectual property either fast enough
or in such a way that it is marketable out of the cash we are currently
generating.
'If we go in fast and do the right deals now with the big electronics firms
who recognise that we have some of the core intellectual property, there is
a chance that we may achieve the holy grail, which is to get some of what we
do accepted as the industry standard.'
W Industries has made a start in that direction. In July Sega Enterprises of
Japan, the world leader in coin-operated arcade entertainment, agreed to use
W Industries' operating system for its first immersive virtual reality
product.
The contract with Sega should be worth Pounds 3.5m to W Industries for the
first two years and Pounds 1.3m a year thereafter in licensing fees. Sega
bucked the trend for Japanese electronics companies this year, returning
pre-tax profits of Pounds 342m, up 64 per cent on the previous year. The
electronic arcade business is reckoned to be growing at 18 per cent annually
and is currently worth some Pounds 6bn a year worldwide.
Mr Waldern, W Industries' managing director, has a vision which he believes
will keep his company a global leader in this young but dynamic market.
He wants the world of electronics games to move away from being something
solely for young boys, seen as a rather anti-social activity, into a
family-based entertainment, where parents and children interact in playing
the games.
He believes that interactive immersive virtual reality, as a leisure
vehicle, has so far just skimmed the surface of what is possible.
Future growth will lie partly in technological innovation and partly in
intelligent marketing. If the technology supporting the current, relatively
crude graphics, with large cumbersome machines fixed in arcades, can be
adapted and transformed into a lightweight game easily installed in the
front parlour, and with graphical capacities far advanced from today's
possibilities, then W Industries could be on to a winner.
'Anybody can do this stuff on an expensive machine. But to be really
successful, it's got to be cheap.'
