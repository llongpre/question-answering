Political candidates in California have discovered that the information
superhighway can be a fast and inexpensive route to voters. They are using
the Internet, a global network of computers, to answer questions and deliver
election campaign pitches in the run-up to next week's US mid-term
elections.
Fed up with television campaign ads filled with more barbs than substance,
thousands of computer users are going online to find out where the
candidates stand on issues and to research details of their past records.
Over the past month, more than 5,000 people have logged on to the California
Online Voter Guide, a non-partisan service funded by groups ranging from the
California Teachers' Association to Pacific Bell, the regional telephone
company.
Many more are accessing Project Vote Smart, a service sponsored by the
League of Women Voters that provides voting records, campaign finance data
and performance evaluations of candidates by interest groups.
Several candidates are using electronic mail to communicate directly with
voters. E-mail addresses for the two main gubernatorial candidates in
California - incumbent Pete Wilson (Republican) and his challenger Kathleen
Brown (Democrat) - have been widely published and their campaign staff
regularly answer voters' questions.
Both have also participated in online chat sessions with subscribers to
America On-line, CompuServe and Prodigy, the commercial online services.
Ms Brown also has an electronic presence on the World Wide Web, the fastest
growing portion of the Internet which provides easy ways to scan the globe
for information resources.
To reach voters who do not have home computers, Ms Brown this week set up
computer kiosks in San Francisco, Sacramento and Los Angeles. Each kiosk
contains an Apple Macintosh personal computer containing a range of
information about the candidate, including recordings of some of her
campaign speeches.
Claiming to break new ground in the use of technology in a political
campaign, Ms Brown said that the technology 'combines two elements that have
contributed to California's economy and creativity - Hollywood and the
Silicon Valley'.
When it comes to election day, the Internet will also be the place for
up-to-the-minute news on election returns.
The full text of the bulky California ballot pamphlet is already online via
http://www. election. digital. com and the digital campaign cybertrail is
spreading to other states. Through Project Vote Smart, computer terminals
laden with voter information are being placed in public libraries in several
states.
To find out where California's gubernatorial candidates stand on the
controversial issues of immigration, taxes and health care in the November 8
election, send E-mail to petewilson@delphi. com or katbrown@netcom. com -
and wait to see if the computer promises are kept.
