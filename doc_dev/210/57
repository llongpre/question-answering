Sega Enterprises of Japan, the world leader in coin-operated arcade
entertainment, is going into partnership with W Industries of the UK to
develop a new generation of games featuring 'virtual reality', or advanced
computer simulation.
The UK company has become a Sega technology partner along with Martin
Marietta of the US, a leading electronics supplier and specialist in
simulation and training systems.
It will work with Sega on the development of a new arcade game to be
launched in early 1994. No details of the new game are being released. The
deal is worth Pounds 3.5m over two years to W Industries, followed by a
further Pounds 1.3m a year in licensing fees. W Industries has a letter of
intent from Sega for further games research.
According to Jon Waldern, W Industries chief executive, Sega chose to use
the British company's virtual reality system over its own and that of
leading US virtual reality suppliers.
W Industries, now six years old, is the UK's leading exponent of virtual
reality for entertainment. It specialises in 'immersive' virtual reality in
which players wear video helmets and sensory gloves to enter an imaginary
electronic world. It has recently won an industry award for 'Legend Quest' a
dungeons and dragons game installed in the Tower Pageant at the Tower of
London. For four players, the game involves a search for treasure through a
maze of rooms. Wearing helmets which transmit three-dimensional images of
the rooms, the players co-operate in the quest. They 'see' each other as the
fictional characters they play.
Sega, a leader in computer graphics for entertainment, bucked the trend
among Japanese electronics companies this year, returning taxable profits of
Y55,000bn (Pounds 342m), up 64 per cent on the previous year.
Developments of the kind Sega and W Industries are pioneering are changing
the image of games arcades from haunts of bored teenagers to family
entertainment centres. Worth some Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) a year worldwide,
the electronic arcade business is growing at 18 per cent annually.
UK companies including W Industries and Division are among the world leaders
in virtual reality.
