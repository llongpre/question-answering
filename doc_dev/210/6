CYBERIA: LIFE IN THE TRENCHES OF HYPERSPACE by Douglas Rushkoff Flamingo
Pounds 6.99, 320pp
The Utopian urge has been with us since Cro-Magnon man started bumping his
head on the cave ceiling, so it is hardly surprising that some people
maintain that quantum advances in information technology might give birth to
a vastly better society.
The young American journalist Douglas Rushkoff is such a believer. His
lively and informed book is an ode to computers and fibre optics, a glowing
map of a brave new world called Cyberspace.
Rushkoff defines Cyberspace as a 'consensual hallucination accessed through
the computer' - hence, anything from two people speaking by satellite link,
to a boy wandering deep in the latest virtual reality program.
For Rushkoff, Cyberspace is a realm ripe with possibilities for new human
organisation and development. It is a place potentially free of governmental
oversight and personal neuroses, where human impulses can be infinitely
perfected with the help of the microchip.
The author is at his most convincing while charting recent advances in
hardware technology and showing how these have benefited the human
imagination. For Rushkoff, the existence of a 'datasphere', where a large
number of people are plugged into one another's computers, provides an
imaginative arena of unbridled possibility.
He posits a world where business meetings and classrooms no longer require
physical proximity, where correspondence occurs without delay, where news
can be transmitted without need for media conglomerates. Rushkoff
breathlessly scans the future horizon, catching glimpses of scenarios such
as cyber-sex between two people using Virtual Reality software and 'wet',
body-reactive hard-
ware.
It is hard to argue that technology like Video Toasters, which allow us to
'sample' television shows as disc jockeys now do records, and 'wireheading',
hardware that plugs directly into the human brain, promise a whole new way
to work and play.
What Rushkoff seems to have less of a stomach for is the dark side of this
world, the dystopia in which technology is used as a means of repression and
conformity rather than liberation. Believing that 'as computer-networking
technology gets into the hands of more cyberians, historical power centers
are challenged,' he seems to forget that the reason so much power is
centralised is that the people who wield it have a knack of staying one step
ahead of the rest of us. Cyberia's relation to its Soviet namesake may be
more meaningful than just a facile pun. That said, Rushkoff's examination of
the technological aspects of Cyberspace remains essential for those
interested in the subject.
Where the book proves far less effective is in its second part, which deals
with the non-computing side of Cyberia. Smart drugs, house music and
Cyberpunk fiction are all subsumed under a tatty umbrella of New Age
thinking that would have us believe is in some way related to the
information revolution.
Rushkoff's arguments are far from convincing - one need only listen to the
monotonous drone of rave music or the cretinous babble of a 'smart drug'
saleswoman to understand that this is nothing more than warmed-over
hippyism. Rushkoff's prose, so lucid in the early parts of the book, becomes
unmoored and jargon-ridden as he takes us through the poorly-lit labyrinth
of 'neopaganism' and 'technoshamanism'. Where he started off largely
convincing us that a brave new world was being born, we leave the book
thinking that Cyberia is little more than an enclave for the sort of
drop-outs who have always found their utopia in the same place - anywhere
but here.
