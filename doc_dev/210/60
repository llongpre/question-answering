   Apple Computer Inc. said it acquired closely held Orion Network Systems Inc. of Berkeley, Calif. 
Terms weren't disclosed. 

   Orion makes software products that permit computers that aren't directly compatible with International Business Machines Corp. computers to communicate with IBM and IBM-compatible models. 
Apple said the acquisition underscores the company's "commitment to being a leader in the integration of the Macintosh personal computer into industry standard computing environments." 
Apple computers aren't directly compatible with IBM machines, which are the most popular choice for many business applications. 

   Orion is the second company Apple has acquired to enhance its computer networking technology. 
In March, it bought a company known as Network Innovations Corp., which also makes software that helps dissimilar computers communicate. 

   Separately, Apple said that Novell Inc., a maker of equipment and software for networks of personal computers, had modified its popular NetWare network systems to accommodate Apple's Macintosh personal computer. 

   Previously Novell's NetWare, which to date has been used to connect more than two million personal computers into networks, could exchange data and messages only between IBM personal computers and compatible machines. 
Novell is based in Provo, Utah.
