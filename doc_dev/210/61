   The licenses of two Las Vegas slot
machine companies were suspended after gaming authorities found
evidence that keno and video poker games were rigged to prevent
players from hitting jackpots.
   The alleged slot-rigging involved American Coin Enterprises and
American Coin Machine Co.
   The Nevada Gaming Commission voted Thursday to temporarily
suspend more than 30 licenses held by the two companies after
getting an emergency request Wednesday from its enforcement arm,
the state Gaming Control Board.
   The principals in the companies are Rudolph LaVecchia and Frank
Romano. LaVecchia's son, also named Rudolph, is a principal in
American Coin Enterprises. All are from Las Vegas.
   A woman who answered the telephone at American Coin Machine said
only, ``We don't have any comment right now.'' At American Coin
Enterprises, a woman also declined to comment and said the
LaVecchias and Romano were not available.
   The companies have electronic games at 94 locations, mainly bars
and taverns in the Las Vegas area. Gaming Control Board agents
began seizing machines on Wednesday, and continued the roundup on
Thursday.
   Commission Chairman John O'Reilly said the Control Board's
allegations ``are extremely serious'' and warranted the license
suspension pending further review.
   Control Board Chairman Bill Bible said his agents found evidence
that the machines had been altered in a manner that ``cheats the
players'' by altering the odds of hitting a jackpot.
   Board agents said the changes prevent players from hitting a
high-paying royal flush on the companies' video poker machine, and
also prevent a big keno payoff.
   The Control Board released an affidavit from agent Ron Harris
saying an investigation started in June after the board got
information that slots had unapproved computer chips, or eproms,
which determine how the devices operate.
   The American Coin machines were sealed July 14 and unsealed only
after the computer chips were replaced in all the machines, the
board said.
   But the Control Board said further investigation this week by
its lab technicians and agents revealed more unapproved features in
the slot machines ``which the board determined to be cheating
devices.''
   Asked whether there was any evidence of complicity on the part
of bar or tavern owners who got machines from the companies, Bible
said, ``It is an ongoing part of this investigation.''
   American Coin Enterprises and American Coin Machine Co. hold
licenses as slot route operators, manufacturers and distributors of
slot machines.
