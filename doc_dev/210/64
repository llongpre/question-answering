FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (1): A challenge which cannot
be ignored - Computer networking opens up new opportunities for business,
ranging from simple electronic mail to a plethora of multimedia services

Computer networking, at one time a narrowly focused, technical subject for
electronics specialists, has become synonymous with a raft of profound
changes which are expected to reshape business in the late 1990s. Business
leaders ignore its implications at their peril.
Among the expected changes are the growth of electronic channels to the
customer: home shopping, for example, through video catalogues will
profoundly influence retailing. The potential of the automated teller
machine, widely deployed by banks and other financial institutions, has yet
to be fully explored and could provide an electronic market stall for a
broad range of goods and services.
The ability of computer networks to overcome barriers of time and space will
increasingly threaten the position of intermediates in a wide range of
industries, starting with financial services. The growth of desk-top
video-conferencing, now being pioneered by telecommunications companies
including AT&amp;T and British Telecom as well as computer manufacturers like
International Business Machines and Olivetti, seems certain to have an
impact on the travel business.
All of this implies drastically more flexible and higher capacity networks
than those available at present. The chief technical change is expected to
be be the emergence of an enterprise-wide, high speed network capable of
carrying all an organisation's electronic traffic. This implies a single
network capable of supporting data, voice, facsimile and video. Such a
network could carry services ranging from simple electronic mail to a
plethora of multimedia services. Multimedia services involve text, graphics,
video and sound converted into computer language and delivered through a
single interactive channel.
Networks of this kind should prove more cost effective and efficient than
the multiplicity of parallel networks which characterise voice and data
communications in large organisations today, but they will also make
possible new ways of doing business and facilitate new commercial
relationships.
Forrester Research, for example, a US-based consultancy, anticipates the
emergence of 'social computing': 'It will consist of a new generation of
telephones, televisions, and personal computers that access on-line services
through a variety of networks. We assert that large firms will use social
computing to build new connections to customers. Companies that do not
address the emergence of this powerful new communications channel will
suffer in the marketplace'.
The message seems to have struck home. Mr James Cosgrove, head of AT&amp;T's
data-communications services group, says customer demand for the new
services is almost outstripping the company's ability to provide them:
'Their argument is: 'If I do not keep up with this, I will be at a
competitive disadvantage,'' he says.
Mr Cosgrove identifies at least three trends driving change. First, the
convergence of computers and communications in the move from mainframe based
data processing to client-server, or networked, systems: 'Routers and local
area networks have changed the way people think about computing. Today,
people think about networking' he says.
The growth of local and wide area networks has led to the emergence of a
lively group of companies which provide the hardware and software which make
them work. Novell, for example, the market leader in networking software,
earlier this year formed a networking alliance with AT&amp;T. Hubs, the control
and management centres at the heart of local areas networks, and routers
which interconnect networks are provided by Cisco, 3Com, Chipcom, Cabletron
and Synoptics among others. The rates of growth of these companies
illustrates the health of the sector. Chipcom turned over Dollars 48m in
1991, Dollars 87m in 1992 and Dollars 150m last year.
Second, the emergence of highly mobile employees; they are more effective
because they are able to spend more time with their customers. Mobile
employees have to be supported with the elements of a 'virtual office' -
portable computing and telephony; cellular radio links for voice and data.
Third, a growth in intercompany as opposed to intra-company networking.
Companies generally established data networks on a proprietary basis to
disseminate information through their own organisations.
Today, the aim is to share information on a much broader basis. The
influence of Lotus Notes, software which enables groups of people to share
and work on the same information, Mr Cosgrove says, could be compared to a
new industrial revolution.
The keys to many of the new possibilities are information carried in digital
form so it can be stored and manipulated by computers, high bandwidth fibre
optic cabling providing adequate conduits for the volume of information
carried, a new generation of powerful microprocessors and, most important,
an enabling technology called asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) which looks
like revolutionising the way computer networks are built. It provides high
speed transmission and is suitable for many kinds of traffic including
voice, data, facsimile, real-time video, CD-quality audio and imaging.
In the US, carriers including AT&amp;T and US Sprint are already offering their
customers services based on ATM technology.
In Europe, a committee led by Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner,
warned that Europe could not afford to be left behind.
'One important development is the integrated services digital network, ISDN.
This offers the opportunity to send not only voice but also data and even
moving images through telephone lines,' a committee report said.
'ISDN is only the first step. New multimedia services, for instance, high
quality video communications, require even more performance. ISDN is showing
the way and the next technological wave aims for the multimedia world. This
is integrated broadband communications providing an opportunity to combine
all media in a flexible way. The lead technology to implement this is ATM.'
ATM is the latest step in a technological progression which began with
packet switching in the 1970s. As the technology has improved, speed and
capacity has risen inexorably.
Packet switching involves the movement of labelled packets of data each of
which takes the best route through a network. It works well, but it is slow.
Frame relay, the current favourite, is faster. ATM gets its speed from
technological improvements which mean that each packet needs only minimal
addressing and minimal error correction.
Most managers are aware, however, that information technology properly
implemented has the potential to boost business efficiency while poorly
designed and poorly implemented, it is more likely to damage a company's
performance, absorbing money, creating inflexibility and taking up senior
management time.
This double-edged property of IT is amply demonstrated in the current growth
of computer networking. On the one hand, through networking, managers have
the opportunity to change the shape of their organisations for the better by
the timely dissemination of information through and between companies.
On the other, it not easy to accomplish. Senior managers may see parallels
between the stage networking has reached today and the early days of data
processing.
The complexity and novelty of the changes involved requires technical skills
which are in short supply. Substantial cultural barriers may have to be
negotiated - and most companies today are not prepared for the structural
changes which follow on from advanced computer communications. Some
organisations have already decided they are not in the business of network
management and have outsourced their network services to companies like
AT&amp;T, BT, Cable &amp; Wireless and GEIS.
If the 1970s and 1980s was the heyday of the data processing manager, it
seems clear that over the next few years the network manager will take a
leading role in setting a company's IT strategy.
