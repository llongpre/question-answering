<LEADPARA>  When 20,000 managers of corporate computer systems gathered at the Networld
'91 trade show here last week, they found vivid proof that the personal
computer industry remains in a mating frenzy, with companies seeking strategic
partners in virtually every market corner.;    The latest significant
technological pairing, announced at the show, brought together Novell Inc. of
Provo, Utah, the leading maker of operating system software for personal
computer networks, and International Business Machines Corp.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Responding to what it said were requests from customers, IBM said it would
begin selling and supporting Novell's Netware operating system, along with its
own LAN Server software.;    Netware tailored for IBM;  Novell is to develop
versions of Netware for IBM's high-end personal computers and midrange
systems, which will run on top of IBM's OS/2 and AIX-Unix operating systems.; 
  IBM, in turn, will develop the fittings necessary for Netware and LAN Server
to work together seamlessly on large business networks. Officials at both
companies say the alliance does not involve financial dealings.;    For their
customers, the plans are good news. Novell Netware, which works with almost
all major brands of personal computers, has become the network operating
software of choice at the departmental level for most businesses because it is
relatively simple and inexpensive to install.;    Top down joins bottom up; 
IBM's networking efforts, on the other hand, have been strongest at the top,
reaching down from the big, central computing systems for which IBM is
famous.;    By embracing Netware and integrating it with LAN Server, IBM will,
in theory, eventually be able to connect mainframes, minicomputers,
engineering work stations, powerful network personal computers called servers,
desk-top PCs, dumb terminals and even portable computers with a unified system
of plumbing.;    Information would flow through the plumbing "transparently,"
meaning that an executive could log on to the networked system at any machine,
using a standard set of commands, and have access to all information
regardless of where it resides.;    May take years to evolve;  But such a
system may take years to evolve. "Rome was not built in a day," said James A.
Cannavino, an IBM vice president and general manager of its personal systems
division.;    Nor was Rome built without intrigue and some bloodletting. In
embracing Novell, IBM appears to be turning its back on the Microsoft Corp.,
which is developing a rival operating system for local area networks, called
LAN Manager.;    Although IBM and Novell have worked together for several
years in developing networked systems for schools, IBM has largely ignored
Netware in the business market.;    Competes with Microsoft; Instead, IBM has
licensed Microsoft's LAN Manager technology and has incorporated aspects of it
into its own LAN Server software. IBM says it will continue to support LAN
Server, but it will now compete directly with Microsoft's LAN Manager by
selling Netware as well.;    IBM and Microsoft, which is based in Redmond,
Wash., and is the nation's largest personal computer software company, have
had a very close relationship since the early days of the personal computer
industry. But the two companies have clashed repeatedly on the direction that
system software will take in the future.;    Playing to the large base of
low-end personal computers installed around the world, Microsoft emphasizes
the DOS and Windows operating systems; IBM, whose interests lie in selling
newer and more powerful PCs, emphasizes OS/2 and Presentation Manager.;   
Irreconcilable differences?;  Cannavino sought to downplay the notion that the
IBM-Microsoft rift has become irreconcilable.;    "Our interests overlap in
some areas, and they compete in some areas," he said. A Microsoft official at
the show said only that the IBM-Novell alliance "sounds like it will be good
for OS/2," which Microsoft continues to develop.;    Rival computer makers
said they were not particularly concerned by the IBM-Novell alliance. "It's
good for the industry," said a spokesman for Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston,
which itself has a strategic alliance with Novell.;    May help sell
computers; "If it widens the acceptance of Netware and network computing, it
will help us sell more computers.";    Digital Equipment Corp., the
second-largest computer maker after IBM, also announced its support for
Novell's Netware at the show. Digital stopped short of selling Netware,
however, and simply announced plans to have its own Pathworks network
operating system, based on Microsoft's LAN Manager technology, coexist with
Netware. Digital also announced a number of improvements to the Pathworks
software.;    The IBM-Novell alliance was not the only major news of the show.
One of the most significant announcements had little to do with products.
Compaq, which since its beginning in 1982 has referred all customer problems
and complaints back to its dealers, said that it would soon offer direct
telephone support, through a toll-free line, that will providing answers to
basic questions and product information.;    For complex computing problems
that require expert answers, Compaq will offer, for $3,000, a contract for
direct telephone technical support for business customers.  </TEXT>
