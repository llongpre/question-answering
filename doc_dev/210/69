   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co. and Novell Inc.
said they reached a broad agreement under which the two will
develop and market new computer-networking technologies.
   The first fruit of the collaboration will be a version of
Novell's popular networking software, NetWare, that runs
directly on Hewlett's Precision Architecture computer chips,
the "brains" of Hewlett's hottest-selling computers.

   The new NetWare software will allow Hewlett computers to
"talk" more efficiently with other computers in a network and
will be a powerful tool in selling corporations on the
concept of tying computers together in "enterprise-wide
computing," said John Young, Hewlett's president and chief
executive officer. NetWare is now available for many
computers, but runs only on top of operating software rather
than directly on the chips.
   The new agreement also calls for Hewlett to distribute all
Novell products through Hewlett's extensive direct-sales
force, Mr. Young said. Other projects under the deal include
a combination of Hewlett's network-management software into
some future Novell products, creation of a NetWare version
for Hewlett's HP-9000 computers and development of printing
equipment tailored to Novell's network software.
   Mr. Young said the agreement also includes some 25 other
future projects "aimed at making networks better, friendlier
and easier to maintain."
   Raymond Noorda, president and chief executive of Novell,
Provo, Utah, said the agreement also will allow Novell to
market technologies developed jointly with Hewlett. He added
that the far-reaching agreement, "from a financial standpoint
. . . will strengthen our position."
