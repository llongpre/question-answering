<LEADPARA>  NOVELL INC., which makes the Netware operating system software that allows two
or more personal computers to exchange data and share peripherals, has
developed a simplified version called Netware Lite for small businesses and
offices. Netware Lite is not only simple but delightfully cheap.;   Many
advantages come from hooking all the personal computers in the office
together, including the ability to share files, programs and expensive
peripherals like laser printers.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The cost of networking is theoretically offset by the savings on hardware
(one printer can serve many computers, and those computers do not necessarily
have to have hard disks). Productivity is theoretically enhanced because
people do not have to run from computer to computer to find the data they
need.;   "Theoretically" is the key word because networks are often complex,
fragile and expensive to maintain -- and, for small businesses, more trouble
than they are worth.;   Now, for businesses with two to 25 DOS-based personal
computers, Netware Lite provides an alternative. (Apple's Macintosh computers
have built-in networking and are exceptionally easy to hook together, but Macs
are a minority in the office.);   Netware Lite is what is known as a
peer-to-peer networking system, which means that each user can tap into the
resources of all other PCs on the network.;   In "heavy" Netware-based local
area networks -- which constitute three of four LANs in operation today -- one
computer must be set aside as a "dedicated server" that holds the network
operating system and data to be shared by all the others. With Netware Lite,
every computer on the network can act as a server for every other computer.;  
Netware Lite does have some competition, notably Lantastic, from Artisoft Inc.
of Tuscon, Ariz. But Novell, of Provo, Utah, is so well-known that Netware
Lite is expected to dominate the category for low-end networks.;   The list
price for each package of Netware Lite is $99. For a limited time, Novell will
toss in a copy of DR DOS 6.0 as well. (Novell has announced its intention to
acquire Digital Research, whose DR DOS is equivalent to Microsoft Corp.'s
MS-DOS.);   A customer will need one package per computer and will also have
to buy network adapter cards, cables and connectors, and probably special
network versions of their favorite software packages.;   Several companies
have assembled starter kits based on Netware Lite. Xircom Inc. of Los Angeles
((818) 878-7600), for example, offers a bundle called Network Simplicity. It
is truly networking in a box, containing all the hardware and software needed
to get a peer-to-peer system running in just a few minutes. Because it uses
external network adapters instead of plug-in cards, Xircom's product can work
with portable computers as easily as with desk-tops.;   The $849 bundle
includes two copies of Netware Lite, two adapters that attach to the parallel
port of each computer, cables, special installation software that is easier
than Novell's own and an electronic mail application called Simplicity
E-Mail.;   There is also a "multiplexer" device that allows a single parallel
port to handle both the network and a printer at the same time. Additional
computers can be added for $399 each.;   Xircom also offers toll-free
technical support and 24-hour electronic bulletin board support. Novell, in
contrast, has established a 900-number telephone help line for pay-as-you-go
technical help. For new users especially, Xircom's is the better deal.;   For
people who do not mind opening the computer case, Eagle Technology of San Jose
((800) 733-2453), offers the Netware Lite Ethernet Starter Kit, which includes
two nodes of Netware Lite software, two Ethernet adapter cards, a 20-foot
length of coaxial cable, two T connectors, a grounded terminator kit and an
installation guide. Eagle, a division of Anthem Electronics, made network
cards for Novell before Novell got out of the hardware business.;   The Eagle
starter kit has a suggested list price of $615, and additional computers can
be added for $312 each.;   Netware Lite is strictly for DOS- and Windows-based
PCs, and therefore is not a good choice for offices that want to hook PCs to
Macintoshes, OS/2-based servers, Sun work stations or other non-DOS machines.
Also, the Lite version lacks some of the advanced data security features of
Netware 2.X and 3.X.;   But the cost is minimal compared with, say, $5,000 for
a dedicated server plus all the hidden expense of heavy network administration
and maintenance.;   Setting up Netware Lite isn't quite as easy as plugging a
phone into a jack and dialing the office, but it is simpler than setting up a
regular Novell network. The Lite software installation process takes just a
few minutes, and unfamiliar words such as client and server are explained on
screen.;   Basic network functions, including the ability to restrict access
to some areas of a networked computer through passwords and log-ons, can be
set up and controlled by a simple menu system.;   "We created it for the owner
of a flower shop," a Novell product engineer said. "You know, someone who's
more familiar with peonies than with PCs."  </TEXT>
