   South Korea isn't the only one with Olympic problems. 
Consider the sparks flying between the U.S. coin industry and Grey Advertising, which has a $22 million contract to advertise the 1988 U.S. Olympic commemorative coins. 

   Coin experts are aghast over Grey's use in ads of a computer-enhanced rendition of the $5 gold coin, which features the face of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. 
They say it makes the coin look ugly. 

   "I almost died when I saw it," says Elizabeth Jones, the U.S. Mint's chief sculptor-engraver and the Nike coin's designer. 
"If I weren't with the government, I would sue them." 

   "A gross artistic miscarriage," declares Coin World, a trade publication. 

   The computer version -- which was used because a photo of the coin wasn't available at the time-makes several changes to Nike's face. 
In the ad depiction, a wave of hair hangs over her forehead, her mouth is crooked, her nose is turned up, and her right cheek is sliced off, Miss Jones says. 
There's also an extra olive stuck in the middle of her olive-branch wreath. 

   All in all, says David L. Ganz, an author and lawyer specializing in numismatics, the ads do an "abominable job in terms of presenting what a really exquisite coin looks like." 

   Mint officials explain that photos of a coin can be taken only after it's officially struck. 
In this case, a gala first-strike ceremony was held May 2, but Grey had to prepare the ads months earlier. 

   Robert Ravitz, a Grey senior vice president, says the agency did the best it could based on drawings of the coin. 
Responding to Miss Jones's comments, he says: "I don't know what her problem is with the artwork. 
It was an incredible time crunch. 
If we had longer time, I'm sure we could have massaged the artwork to death." 

   Nonetheless, now that Grey has a photo of the coin, he says, it will "rush out" new direct-mail pieces, print ads and TV ads -- to begin running in August. 

   Miss Jones, meanwhile, says all this has hurt her artistic reputation, earned through work such as the 1986 Statue of Liberty commemorative coin. 
She and Mr. Ganz say the "ugly" ads have probably hurt sales, too. 
The coins have so far raised $16.5 million for U.S. athletes; the mint's goal is $49 million. 

   Maybe it's the wrath of Nike. 
Grey's portrayal of the dashing goddess is all most people will see, Miss Jones says, and "I had a couple of people tell me to my face she doesn't look very pretty."
