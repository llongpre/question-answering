FT  19 DEC 94 / Observer: On the line
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inclining to the view that Internet bores deserve anything that comes their
way, Observer was delighted with the following diverting tale from one
hapless surfer in cyberspace.
Wishing to travel from London Waterloo to bijou Barnes, 20 minutes down the
line in a south- westerly direction, he consulted Internet's railway
timetable.
The system quickly found the route. Travel from Waterloo on the 21.39 to
Brussels on Eurostar. Return to Ostend, take a ferry to Ramsgate, a train to
Waterloo and a train to Barnes, where you will arrive at 7.19 the following
morning.
