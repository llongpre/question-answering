'downtime' / PC Networks

PERSONAL computer network technology today is a mature technology, which is
well-understood by the technical experts. It has also become so
sophisticated that it is deceptively easy to install and look after. The
truth, however, is far from that, as some organisations are discovering to
their cost.
One City of London law firm recently had its entire network crash in the
middle of a working day. The network - comprising desktop PCs for more than
200 staff - ran its client files, as well as accounting and word processing.
The crash meant the 150 solicitors employed could do no work.
The firm's IT consultants found that a piece of faulty applications software
on one of the network server machines had been the cause. When the software
was removed, the system began to function again. Nevertheless, the
consultants spent most of the day trying to get everyone back on-line.
In another case, a leading bank in London put all the PCs on its trading
floor onto two fault-tolerant server machines, and relied on these machines
to keep the network running. No-one managed it on a daily basis, and neither
did anyone realise that one of the servers have fallen over until the second
one also developed a problem. The entire trading floor was out action for
two working days.
According to John Godden, principal consultant with network specialist
Azlan, the cost of the 'downtime' in such situations can be much larger than
the simple cost of fixing the system. These networks, in common with most
that are being installed today, are commercially driven. They are used to
support the day to day business functions, in a way that did not used to be
the case even two or three years ago.
The old-style PC networks were 'device sharing' facilities, giving people
access to a departmental printer or fax. If they went down, people could
carry on working. Today they cannot. People use their PC to log on to the
network for all their software, from wordprocessing through to databases.
They also use the network to get information from software held elsewhere in
the organisation - 'the true cost is the cost per hour in lost business for
every hour the network is down,' says Godden.
Networks need to be planned differently to support the new applications,
says Andy Rolfe, technical director of Logical Networks. The design should
be sufficiently resilient and robust to properly support the new business
applications, and the increased traffic volumes which they create - 'many
companies under-estimate the complexity of the system they want,' he adds.
Technically, a network consists of several 'layers' of equipment and
software. The bottom layer is the wiring. The comes the 'pipe' - ethernet,
token ring, or FDDI (fibre distributed data interface).
On top of that is the transport protocol which determines how the data will
be transported. Next is the operating system, such as Novell Netware or
Banyan Vines, which manages what goes where, and finally there is the
applications software held on the server. To complicate matters, there are
other pieces of equipment known as routers, bridges, hubs and switches,
which play a part in sending the data traffic around the wires.
Some problems happen because the 'pipes' installed do not have sufficient
capacity, as one insurance company found out to its cost. It had tried to
stretch the ethernet pipe beyonds its technical limit, and wondered why
'protocol error' messages kept appearing on the screens.
In other cases, the network has just grown organically, and gets to a point
where it is simply over-stretched. Re-assessing the applications software
may solve the problem.
One such case was the British Airports Authority resource management system.
It supported 150 PCs, which log faults which occur at UK airports, including
London Heathrow. It ran a PC database system, but the application was
drowning the network with too much data traffic. Consultants ACT business
Systems solved the problem by redesigning the applications software to use a
client-server architecture, cutting down the volume of traffic on the
network.
Mike Long, principal consultant at Hoskyns, stresses that a sound network
infrastructure does not come cheaply, but the long term benefits can
outweigh the cost - 'it must be flexible, and easy to add more people. That
is a heavy commitment. For a large building, of say 180,000 square feet, and
five or six storeys, the cost could come to between Pounds 500,000 and
Pounds 750,000,' he says.
But even a well-designed robust network is not trouble-free. An issue that
many large organisations are now wrestling with is data management. As
networks, the number of servers increases in proportion, and that creates
problems for users. They do not know where files are stored, or find that
duplicate file copies do not match.
'If you have 250 users, you would have to think about controlling the data.
Problems arise such as who has a copy of this document, what did they file
it under, on which server,' says Andy Mulholland of network services
company, BISS.
Difficulties arise when two copies of the same file are held on different
servers, but one has been altered. Anyone calling up the unaltered file
could unknowingly be working with out of date information.
At BISS, they have first-hand experience. The company's 200 employees all
have a PC, connected to 10 servers, with 500 Mbytes of storage each.
Documents transferred from one department to another are regularly re-filed
on a different server under another name. The copy in the originating
department does not get updated. BISS is hoping to solve the problem by
replacing its 10 500Megabytes servers with two 3Gigabyte 'super-servers.'
These 'super-servers' also have other advantages. It is easier to keep them
in a single physical location, where they can be protected not only against
theft, but against spilled drinks and other hazards of the office
environment.
An alternative way to improve the management of the network might be to use
new operating software, such as Novell's Netware 4. This has been designed
to provide sophisticated data management facilities, in particular to make
file access simpler. However, the software was only launched this year, and
most consultants are advising people to wait until it has proved itself
before they embark on a substantial installation.
