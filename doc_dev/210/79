   Rage against Margaret Thatcher animated some of
the liveliest corners of British culture in the past decade, and
with her departure many an artist has lost a muse.
   ``There will be a period in which we feel her loss,'' playwright
Peter Flannery said Friday.
   ``Culturally, she was an especially clear and pleasurable
target,'' said novelist and screenwriter Hanif Kureishi. ``Her
ideology is so clearly obnoxious.''
   With the Labor Party split and demoralized for much of Mrs.
Thatcher's conservative tenure, the role of opposition fell to the
``chattering classes'' - including Harold Pinter and his wife,
historian Antonia Fraser, and novelists Salman Rushdie and Ian
McEwan.
   John Mortimer, author of ``Rumpole of the Bailey,'' created the
amoral, grasping politician Leslie Titmuss as a Thatcherite
character in the novel ``Paradise Postponed,'' which became a TV
miniseries.
   Mrs. Thatcher was assaulted in Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses,''
on stage in David Hare's ``The Secret Rapture'' and in hard-hitting
TV fare such as ``A Very British Coup'' and the grotesque puppets
of ``Spitting Image.''
   On screen, Kureishi and director Stephen Frears achieved
international renown with a pair of films that let rip against
Thatcher's Britain: ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ``Sammy and
Rosie Get Laid.''
   The state-subsidized stages of The National Theater and The
Royal Shakespeare Company rang with denunciations of the free
market ethos of Thatcherism.
   It was not the best way to catch the attention of the prime
minister, who showed little enthusiasm for culture save for an
occasional night of opera at the Glyndebourne Festival. Her tastes
in literature ran to Jane Austen, Alexander Solzhenitsyn and
Frederick Forsythe.
   Mrs. Thatcher had her friends in the arts, including Andrew
Lloyd Webber and novelist-playwright Jeffrey Archer, who briefly
was Conservative Party deputy chairman. Kingsley Amis, who became a
knight thanks to Mrs. Thatcher, claimed she had replaced Queen
Elizabeth II in his dreams.
   On the left, however, it was open season.
   ``She didn't kill poetry in 11{ years - she's not that powerful
- but if she had been there for another 11{ years she might have,''
said Mary-Kay Wilmers, an editor of the left-leaning London Review
of Books.
   At the National Theater, David Hare wrote three plays -
``Pravda'' (with Howard Brenton), ``The Secret Rapture,'' and
``Racing Demon'' - all influenced to varying degrees by the
Thatcher zeitgeist.
   The Royal Shakespeare Company had two hits with ``Fashion,''
Doug Lucie's biting satire about an ad agency executive named Cash;
and ``Singer,'' Flannery's sprawling play about postwar Britain.
   In ``Singer,'' the title character becomes an avaricious
property developer who lends his name to a phenomenon, Singerism,
not dissimilar from that recently coined term Thatcherism.
   ``What we're going to write about now, I don't know,'' said
playwright Flannery.
   But Terry Hands, artistic director of The Royal Shakespeare
Company, said few writers ever truly came to grips with Mrs.
Thatcher.
   ``I can remember in the late '80s saying, `Where are the plays
about these Thatcher years?' as if the whole country was cowed,''
Hands said in an interview.
   He thinks it is too late now to throw any more brickbats.
   ``Play writing has either got to be timeless, as `Singer' was,
or precisely on the button,'' Hands said. ``God defend us from
plays written about yesterday.''
   Who will be the new target?
   Former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine, Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd and treasury chief John Major are all running to
succeed Mrs. Thatcher as the Conservative Party leader and prime
minister. Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock also hopes to be prime
minister before long.
   ``There will be plays about Heseltine; there will be plays about
Kinnock,'' said Peter Hall, former artistic director of the
National Theater. ``Art exists to challenge the status quo.''
