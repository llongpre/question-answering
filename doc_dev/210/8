Solo travellers on the Internet 'information highway' are being overtaken by
the digital equivalent of 16-wheel juggernaut trucks, as businesses begin to
transport large quantities of data through cyberspace. The system is being
transformed into a global electronic marketplace that could change the way
world trade is conducted.
The Internet, a global system of computer networks, now links an estimated
2.2m computers and over 25m users in 137 countries. New users are hooking up
at the rate of about one every two minutes.
Originally a US government-funded programme in the late 1960s, to
electronically link researchers at US universities and government
laboratories, the Internet was in theory closed to commercial activity until
about two years ago.
Now companies are rushing to take advantage of the system as a low-cost
route for international electronic mail. Computer companies have led the
way. Digital Equipment, one of the heaviest users, has over 31,000 computers
linked to Internet and exchanges an average of 1.7m e-mail messages per
month with people outside the company.
To date, however, very little commerce is actually being transacted in
cyberspace. Most companies have been reluctant to trust sensitive business
data, purchase orders or credit information to the unregulated network. But
that could be about to change. A group of Silicon Valley companies and
organisations has joined forces in an attempt to pioneer the use of the
Internet as a new medium for trade among high technology companies by
creating an electronic marketplace called CommerceNet.
If successful, this 'could revolutionise both regional and foreign trade',
says Marty Tenenbaum, chief executive of Enterprise Integration Technologies
(EIT), a research firm leading the development of CommerceNet, together with
Stanford University's Center for Information Technology and the Western
Research and Educational Network (West Ren), a non-profit group that
operates the Northern California portion of the Internet.
The CommerceNet consortium is funded by a Dollars 6m US government grant,
through the Department of Commerce' Technology Reinvestment Program which is
being expanded by the Clinton administration as part of its technology
development policy. The group will obtain matching funds from the companies,
state and local agencies that have agreed to sponsor the service.
CommerceNet is tackling the problems that have discouraged companies from
using the Internet for buying and selling goods and services, notably the
complexity of navigating the Internet and lax security.
The first problem can be overcome with a new 'point and click' interface
program called Mosaic, developed by the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Distributed free via the Internet, Mosaic is rapidly gaining popularity as
an easy-to-use method to gain access to information resources on the
Internet.
Mosaic will enable companies to place 'virtual store fronts' on the
Internet. Buyers can tap into these store fronts, browse through catalogues
of products - which may include pictures, diagrams and even video clips -
call up order forms and transmit their orders directly to the seller.
However, security remains a serious concern for business users. The public
network is particularly vulnerable to computer 'crackers', as demonstrated
by a recent rash of password interceptions involving tens of thousands of
Internet users.
To address this problem, EIT is working with RSA Data Security, the leading
US encryption technology company, to develop a 'secure' version of Mosaic.
CommerceNet will provide participants with authentication, authorisation and
data encryption programs so that buyers and sellers can safely exchange
sensitive information such as credit card numbers and bid amounts, sign
legally enforceable contracts, maintain audit trails, and get paid through
co-operating banks.
Until such software is available, CommerceNet participants will proceed
cautiously. Most say they will provide on-line product catalogues and
literature and enable orders to be placed via the Internet. For now,
however, they will stop short of completing financial transactions.
Nevertheless, CommerceNet is an important testbed for 'commerce in
cyberspace', say participants.
'We expect to gain valuable insights and experience concerning electronic
commerce, and to offer a broad range of business information and services
via CommerceNet,' says Peter Meekin, of Dun &amp; Bradstreet.
Hewlett-Packard and other manufacturing companies that are already using
private networks for exchanging order information with their customers and
suppliers see CommerceNet as a potentially cheaper alternative that could be
used to expand their electronic selling activities.
'It will be another mode of electronic commerce, another tool in our tool
kit,' says Sandy Whitson, EDI business manager at HP. The company will move
cautiously, she says, but is keen to explore the potential of public network
electronic sales which could reach a broader range of customers than
existing systems. While CommerceNet is currently focused on
'business-to-business' transactions within a tightly-knit group of about two
dozen companies, its founders have ambitious goals.
'I believe that in two to three years you will see as many as 100,000
companies using the Internet as a principal sales and service channel,' says
Tenenbaum. CommerceNet itself will be handling business transactions for as
many as 3,000 companies by the turn of the century, he predicts.
