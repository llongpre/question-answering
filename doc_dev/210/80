   The Canadian Mint has been forced to drop two canoeists from Canada's new dollar coin and replace them with a loon, because the master dies for the original design disappeared during a November snowstorm. 

   The mint disclosed the loss yesterday and said "an intensive" police investigation has failed to locate the dies. 

   The mint said it didn't know whether the dies were mislaid or stolen, but it said their disappearance "represents a security breach which necessitated" the design change. 

   The dies disappeared while being shipped by a courier company, Mouland Express of Ottawa, from the mint's Ottawa office to its production plant in Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
The mint said it was advised by Mouland on Nov. 7 that the dies had reached Winnipeg, but that their delivery to the Winnipeg plant would be delayed because of a severe snowstorm. 

   Several days later, after the storm had passed, the mint was informed that the dies were missing. 
A spokesman for Mouland said he couldn't comment while an investigation was under way. 

   The Winnipeg shipment included the master dies for both sides of the dollar coin. 
The mint said it usually ships each die separately for greater security. 

   Mint officials said it would be technically difficult for anyone not in the coin-production business to produce coins from the missing dies. 
If any coins of the original design show up on the market they would be illicit, because the mint said it didn't produce any. 

   The new design will retain on one side an effigy of Queen Elizabeth II, which appears on all Canadian coins.The loon motif for the coin's reverse side was drawn from the mint's inventory of coin designs. 

   The Canadian Wildlife Federation welcomed the use of the loon, but the government is expected to encounter considerable criticism for the mishap. 
A commentator on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. termed the incident "loony." 

   The mint said that even if the original dies are found "they will never be used to produce the new one-dollar circulating coin." 

   The 11-sided, gold-colored coin, which will be slightly heavier and slightly larger than a U.S. quarter, will be made of bronze plated nickel. 

   The dollar coins will be introduced as planned this July despite the design change, the mint said. 
Paper dollar bills are to be gradually withdrawn, starting in 1989.
