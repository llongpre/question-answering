AT&amp;T, the US telecommuni-cations company, and Novell, the leader in computer
networking software, have formed an alliance to create worldwide inter- and
intra-company communications services for businesses.
The new service, called AT&amp;T NetWare Connect Services, will combine Novell's
widely-used local area network software with AT&amp;T's telephone network to
form a global network of business networks, in effect a 'business internet',
the companies said.
Business use of the Internet, a global network of computer networks with an
estimated 25m users, is rapidly expanding. However, concerns about security
and the complexity of using the Internet have limited most business use to
electronic mail.
AT&amp;T said its new service will address these problems.
Applications will include workgroup collaboration, information retrieval and
manipulation, electronic commerce, distributed computing, messaging and fax
services.
'Our alliance with Novell is a significant step in expanding the electronic
highway on which commerce, business collaboration, and knowledge sharing
will ride,' said Mr John Petrillo, president of AT&amp;T's Business
Communications Services unit.
The advent of public data services will enable business customers to avoid
the expense of building and operating their own private inter networks said
Mr David Taylor, industry analyst at the Gartner Group, a market research
firm.
