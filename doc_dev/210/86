THE SLOW but inevitable convergence of computing and telecommunications is
providing the motive force for an implosion of new information processing
practices and technologies.
A lexicon of neologisms has emerged to label these concepts: enterprise-wide
computing, co-operative computing, client-server architectures,
plug-and-play environments, rightsizing.
What they all amount to is new ways of describing a concept more than a
quarter of a century old: distributed data processing or ddp, the idea that
computer power can be spread throughout an organisation if it can be
contained in small enough packets. For many companies it means substituting
a large number of small computers connected in networks for a small number
of larger machines.
International Business Machines (IBM), the world's largest computer
manufacturer and staunchest defender of data processing centred on mainframe
computers, is joining in. Last month among a raft of new communications
products it announced adaptors (special circuit boards) that allow portable
computers unprecedented access to corporate information systems as well as
announcing plans that could see CICS, its flagship transaction processing
software, dominating the open - or vendor independent - systems environment.
The range of issues now encompassed by distributed data processing is
bewilderingly broad. At one end of the spectrum is the dilemma of how to
manage very large data networks, now the biggest concern among information
technology managers. At the other, the question of which operating system
should prevail in the open data processing environment of the late 1990s.
It is also providing the dynamo for the growth of a large number of
entrepreneurial companies which were quick to recognise the possibilities of
computer communications. These include Novell, the leader in software for
personal computer networking and 3Com and Cisco which specialise in
'internetworking', providing the hardware and software which allows local
and wide area networks to talk to one another.
These developments are taking place against a background of the worst
instability the computer industry has known. Prices are tumbling as improved
technology cuts the cost of components. Distribution channels are being
undermined as gross profit margins narrow. The global recession is forcing
customers to put a cap on capital investment.
The large telecommunications companies, meanwhile, are taking a new interest
in computing services, the fastest growing area of the computer industry.
BT has emerged as one of the largest systems integration companies in the
UK. France Telecom is negotiating to take a stake in Sema Group, the large
Anglo-French services company. Mercury Communications, BT's principal
competition in the UK is moving into managed data communications, securing,
among others, a Pounds 15m, five-year contract with TSB Retail Banking and
Insurance.
The purpose behind these activities, whether overt or not, is the creation
of 'intelligent networks' which will give customers greater control of their
telecommunications and cost savings from improved allocation of network
resources.
For the telecommunications companies intelligent networks will provide an
integrated, managed, services environment. Competition is already developing
between the big companies to provide managed voice and data networking
services for international companies.
The growth of computer communication is underpinned by a number of trends,
including the evolution of open systems.
Standards are at the heart of open systems. One of the most abused of
industry terms, open systems simply imply computers that can easily be
connected into communications networks and with the capacity to run software
from any supplier obeying the open systems rules.
Last month Mr Jim Manzi, chief executive of Lotus Development Corporation
told the Etre conference of top computer industry executives that open
systems were the only way customers could expect an uninterrupted return on
their investment in computerisation.
Many corporations share a common dilemma. Their operations, whether national
or international, have grown in response to a business strategy in which
information technology played little part.
The result is all too often an electronic Tower of Babel of incompatible
computers and software which denies senior management the chance to create
enterprise-wide communications and has meant corporations have derived fewer
benefits than expected from considerable investments in computers and
communications.
This dissatisfaction is driving the open systems movement. Large vendors,
while paying lip service to open systems, have been less than enthusiastic
about implementing them because of heavy investment in their own designs.
Digital Equipment and IBM were networking pioneers - IBM through its
mainframe networking protocol Systems Network Architecture and DEC through
its VAX compatible computer line - but tardy in implementing open systems.
Both are now changing rapidly. Earlier this month IBM announced early
support for the latest version of an industry-wide set of rules that
guarantee a product conforms to open systems standards.
The rules are set by X/Open, a worldwide, independent open systems
organisation which is dedicated to developing a multivendor Common
Applications Environment, based on both formal industry standards and
standards which have become accepted de facto.
X/Open's new set of specifications, XPG4, comprises 22 separate components
covering operating systems and languages, data management, user interfaces,
general interworking, mainframe interworking, PC interworking and media.
Products which meet the XPG4 specifications will pass the open systems
interoperability test and can safely be connected together in corporate-wide
networks.
Advances in open systems are still confused by the arguments over operating
systems. There are still those who see open systems as synonymous with Unix,
a multi-tasking, multi-user operating system developed by AT&amp;T and now
championed by Unix International, a non-profit organisation responsible for
directing the evolution of Unix System V, an industry standard.
Competition for Unix will be seen from Microsoft with Windows NT, IBM with
OS/2 and Taligent, an IBM and Apple joint venture, with a operating system
codenamed 'Pink'.
Just as portable telephones have revolutionised conventional communications,
so tiny portable 'digital communicators' capable of handling voice, data and
image, are expected to revolutionise computer communications. Apple, AT&amp;T in
co-operation with Matsushita, Marubeni and EO, have already announced
product intentions. IBM is not expected to be far behind.
