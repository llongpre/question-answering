   Microsoft Corp., riding a ``red hot'' hit
with its Windows 3.0 software, plans to invest millions of dollars
on new products and services and add more than 2,300 employees in
the next year, its executives say.
   Corporate officials also told financial analysts gathered at
Microsoft's headquarters Thursday that because of the spending, it
would be difficult to maintain the hectic pace of sales growth the
company has enjoyed.
   Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates said the new version
of Windows ``is the center of the universe for us now.'' The
program, which provides an easy-to-use framework for running
spreadsheets, word processors and other programs, will be further
improved this year and have more programs adapted to it, he said.
   Gates also said Microsoft was beginning a major move into office
computer networks and hoped to capture a share of that market now
dominated by Novell Inc. of Orem, Utah.
   Microsoft, the world's largest publisher of personal computer
software, reported Wednesday its profits for the fiscal year ended
June 30 grew 64 percent over the year before, while revenues rose
47 percent.
   ``We're extremely bullish on the markets we participate in from
a long-term standpoint,'' said Microsoft president Mike Hallman,
but added that projects would require ``some heavy investments this
year.''
   Asked whether Microsoft could sustain the 47 percent sales
growth, senior vice president and chief financial officer Frank
Gaudette replied, ``I think that would be on the very high end.''
   Microsoft's stock, which closed up $2 at $71.50 a share
Wednesday in over-the-counter trading, fell $2.75 a share to $68.75
Thursday.
   Neither Hallman nor Gates would say how much investment would be
required. But Steve Ballmer, senior vice president for systems
software, said his segment alone would spend $18 million and hire
500 more people to work on its new ``Network Specialist Program.''
   Microsoft spent $180 million on research and development and
$317 million on sales and marketing in fiscal 1990.
   Microsoft plans to grow from its present 5,635 employees to
about 8,000 over the next year. Hallman said the new workers would
include 750 in research and development and 1,250 in sales and
marketing.
   Microsoft, founded by the multibillionaire Gates and prep school
friend Paul Allen 15 years ago, had just 1,800 employees in 1987.
   It reported fiscal 1990 profits of $279.2 million or $2.34 a
share on revenues of $1.18 billion, both records. Net earnings for
fiscal 1989 were $170.5 million or $41.52 a share on revenues of
$803.5 million.
   Sales and profits were boosted by Windows 3.0, a runaway success
with 800,000 copies shipped since its introduction in late May,
Ballmer said. The software replaces the technical word commands
needed to manage programs and information in IBM personal computers
with on-screen graphics.
   ``It is absolutely red hot,'' Ballmer said.
   Microsoft shipped just 200,000 copies of its advanced computer
operating system OS-2 in all of fiscal 1990, Ballmer said.
   At one time, OS-2 was seen as the replacement for MS-DOS,
Microsoft's operating system that is the industry standard for
IBM-compatible computers. But with the huge success of Windows,
Microsoft now sees itself as having a ``family'' of operating
systems, with OS-2 an ``advanced form of Windows,'' Gates said.
   ``DOS is not likely to be replaced in the foreseeable future,''
Ballmer said.
   In the 1990s, Microsoft will evangelize for office and corporate
networks linking large computers and desktop computer users to
permit instant access to vast amounts of information, Ballmer said.
   To do that, Microsoft will introduce a new version of its Local
Area Network Manager software in August, is setting up a specially
trained group of resellers, and is boosting its sales and support
force, he said. It plans a major ad campaign and a series of
seminars this fall and winter to launch the Network Specialist
Program, he added.
   The target is Novell, which has 65 percent or better of the
existing office network market. Novell, founded in 1983 and the
maker of the NetWare operating system, had sales of $225.9 million
in the six months ended April 28.
   Capturing market share from Novell won't happen soon, Ballmer
said. ``We cannot overwhelm them. We have to show cleverness,'' he
said.
   Gates said he didn't see the move as dramatic or dangerous, but
necessary, since he believes networks will eventually dominate
office computing.
   A Novell official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
move by Microsoft had been expected for some time. By educating
more potential customers, Microsoft's heavy promotion of office
networks should benefit the industry as a whole, Novell included,
the official said.
