whirl - Jargon

The word 'platform' is among the latest to have fallen prey to the jargon
merchants of the computer industry. It joins the ranks of 'server' and
'environment' as a new way to describe the humble computer. In fact, systems
no longer run on computers but in environments, notably in Unix environments
and in PC environments - where everything is Wysiwig ('what you see is what
you get'). And minicomputers (remember them?) are now called mid-range
servers.
Words are given new forms or are invented from other words. Take 'leverage,'
which is fast becoming a verb. Network company Novell said last month: 'Only
a minority of desk-top systems leverage the network services available to
them.' What does that mean? We could ask the same of outsource, rightsource,
rightsize, downsize.
Is deriding words like these taking a Canute attitude to change in the
language or is it providing examples to support the Oxford English
Dictionary's definition of jargon as 'barbarous or debased language'?
Or again, is jargon more sinister, a language invented by marketing people
to create the impression their product is bringing something new?
A director of the research company, IDC defined so-called client-server
systems, currently a subject of much marketing and customer activity, as
merely the latest in a line of over-hyped concepts masquerading as
solutions.
The point is the computing industry is still relatively young and is
progressing at extraordinary speed. There is no clear way forward for
businesses. Ten years ago they wondered about the role of personal
computers; today they look at the implications of being able to mix moving
pictures and voice with standard data on machines which can be carried in
briefcases.
In the early 1980s, fourth-generation languages were the answer to system
development problems; then came computer-aided systems engineering and now
there is rapid application development, with object-orientated development
and software re-use complicating matters.
Each 'new' development brings its own jargon. Suppliers latch on to it and
computing specialists get sucked in.
Technical jargon is undeniably useful as a verbal shorthand for specialists
when talking to others in the same field, be it computing, law or financial
futures trading. Jargon has always been part of the computing industry.
After all, what did 'mainframe' mean before it became 'enterprise server'?
Computing people are comfortable using terms such as hardware, software,
megabytes, RISC and Windows in the knowledge that technical colleagues are
likely to understand exactly what they are talking about.
However, until recently, computing people worked in their ivory towers,
turning system specifications into programs which more or less did what the
business departments required. They could talk their own language to each
other as they got on with their jobs.
BUSINESS COLLABORATION
But personal computing has opened business people's eyes to the potential of
information technology (arguably an acceptable term) and brought them closer
to the specialist staff. New software products (now called tools) enable
computing people and business people to develop prototype systems together.
The new applications of information technology emerging from such
collaboration are making computing central to the business. The computing
specialists are increasingly having to cut jargon and talk the language
(business jargon?) of their end-users (do these people know, for example,
that they are end-users?).
Perhaps this welcome trend towards collaboration will work its way back from
the end-users to the computing people and from them to the marketing people
who are responsible for so much of the jargon.
Any reversal of the encroachment of jargon could be significant. Stripping
away jargon exposes just what people are trying to sell. After all, whatever
computer suppliers might say, they do not leverage open platforms: they sell
boxes of electronics.
