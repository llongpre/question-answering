Question: Today, there is an active market for United States uncirculated coins 
graded MS-63, MS-64 and MS-65. I would like to know if there is such a market 
for Mexican coins as well. If not, do you see one developing in the future? -- 
R.K. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Mexican coins have long been popular with U.S. collectors. In part this 
is due to the proximity of Mexico. In part it has to do with the normal 
collecting urge. There are collectors for every country imaginable, but Mexico 
and Canada rank high with Americans because of common interests, shared 
histories and virtually open borders. 
</P>
<P>
During Spanish rule, Mexican coinage circulated freely in the United States, 
and many consider pieces of eight (some minted in Mexico) among our earliest 
coins. There is an active market for such coins and others during the colonial 
period of Mexico. Modern issues also have a strong following. 
</P>
<P>
Just as you'll find dealers who specialize in ancient coinage or world coins, 
so too you will find some who are experts in Mexico or South America. But there 
are differences insofar as grading is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
United States coins are now virtually universally graded on a scale of 1 to 70 
with coins in the 60-to-70 range considered to be uncirculated. The higher the 
grade the better and more expensive the coin. Some grading services and dealers 
will vouch for the quality of a coin. But even so, there is often disagreement 
between grading services and dealers as to the accuracy of a given grade. And 
beyond this, two similar coins given the same grade may still vary in price due 
to the greater eye appeal. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no such grading services exist for foreign coins, although some dealers 
will personally grade them and some grading services have flirted with the idea 
of grading them. 
</P>
<P>
My suggestion regarding Mexican coins would be to purchase the best quality 
available, keeping in mind that no universal grading standards actually exist. 
Experience is still the best teacher. Grading is an art, not a science.

Q: About 20 years ago while selling Girl Scout cookies a customer mentioned 
saving bills with Joseph Barr's signature. He said they would be valuable 
because of the short term he held office under President Kennedy. I've never 
seen or heard anything about this. What determines the value? -- K.K. 
</P>
<P>
A: Many people are under the impression that bills with Barr's signature are 
valuable. This is a fallacy. It's true that he was Treasurer for a short period 
of time, but the government made sure that millions and millions of bills 
bearing his signature were run off in order to prevent hoarding and 
speculation. Whatever bills you might have are just worth face value.

Q: One of my hobbies is collecting coins. One of the oldest I have is marked 
1893, 1 florin, 2 shillings. The opposite face is marked Victoria . dei . gra . 
Britt . Regina . Fid. Def. Ind. Imp. How much is this coin worth now? -- M.F.C. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your coin is British and worth about $3. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My mother noticed your column and remembers she had brought home a few half 
dollars. (I had already had some.) I read your article about the value of 1964, 
'65, '68 and '69 half dollars. I don't have any of those, but I do have 1970s 
and '80s. The most interesting is a 1776-1976 Bicentennial. How much is it 
worth? Also, I have 1956, '52 and '39 pennies. How much are they worth? -- L.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your half dollars, I'm sorry to say, are just worth face value. The 
Bicentennial is a nice coin, but millions and millions were made for 
circulation. Some proof and uncirculated silver pieces do have collector value. 
Your wheat-back cents too are probably just worth face value. You can learn 
more about coins and values by talking to coin dealers, joining a coin club and 
reading books on the subject. Some good primers are "High Profits From Rare 
Coin Investment" by Q. David Bowers and "The Coin Collector's Survival Manual" 
by Scott A. Travers.
