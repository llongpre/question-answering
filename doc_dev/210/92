   You can't look at David J. Colmans' book, but you
can read it.
   The book _ on using computers in public relations and related
fields _ was written on computer by people contacted via computer,
edited on computer and published on computer.
   And since it exists only in the memory of a computer in
Columbus, Ohio, the book can only be read by using a computer.
   ``The essence of the book is to share information on the `this
is how I do it' use of technology in the communications arts,''
said Colmans, vice president of an Atlanta public relations firm.
   Colmans is one of about six ``system operators'' of a computer
network called the Public Relations Special Interest Group. Along
with co-editor Ron Solberg of Chicago, he has compiled the book
over about four years.
   In it are chapters written by the public information officer for
Kansas City, Mo., who tells how he has set up a computer network to
tell citizens what is happening in the city; discussions of ``voice
mail,'' a sophisticated, computer-operated telephone answering and
message system; and numerous other aspects of how to use technology
in the field.
   The computer book, which would be about an inch thick if
printed, is better than one on paper, Colmans said, because ``once
you buy a hardcopy book and put it on the shelf, that's it for
eternity _ whatever's in the book is the information.''
   ``With an on-line book, not only are you not stuck with having
to have all the information sitting on your shelf, ... but the
minute something becomes obsolete, bang, it's gone. And the minute
something comes in that's interesting and new, in a matter of a
couple minutes it's on line and available for everybody to see,''
he said.
   The book _ with the official title of ``The Functional Use of
Computers in Public Relations, Marketing and Advertising'' _ is a
true creature of electronics.
   ``Virtually the entire book was brought together through
electronic mail messages and sharing of text as opposed to voice
communication,'' Colmans said.
   ``There were very few phone calls. ... The book itself was
created in an electronic communications environment. I have met,
face to face, about six of the 40 to 50 people that I communicate
with electronically. Most of them are just type on a screen to
me,'' he said.
   Colmans is not your average computer hacker, sitting in front of
a terminal, wrapped up in the nuts and bolts, or bits and bytes, of
technology.
   ``About five years ago, I started getting interested in
computers to help me do my work, not just to play with, because I'm
one of those people that can't write a program,'' he said.
   ``I don't know how a computer works any more than I know how a
television set works. But I do know how to turn on a TV and I do
know how to turn on a computer.''
   In compiling the book, Colmans said, ``the big issue that we
discovered was, and still is today, that there are so many kinds of
computers out on the market and there's a real lack of
understanding among computer users that ... you can actually get
those computers to talk to each other.''
   Because the book has not been published in the traditional
sense, Colmans earns nothing from the people who use it.
   ``We have not done this project to make money; we've done this
project to share information,'' he said, although there has been
some discussion about publishing a ``hardcopy of the book'' in the
future.
