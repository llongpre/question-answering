<LEADPARA>  Many computer companies talk about compatibility and connectivity, asserting
that it is easy to hook their computers to other systems customers may already
have installed. Executives may soon have the chance to see, in advance and
without pain, how "multi-vendor connectivity" works in real life.;   Last
week, at the Infomart technology center in Dallas, the foundation of such a
public showcase was officially put in place. The Infomart Martnet is an
ambitious attempt to get most of the major computer and information technology
companies to roll up their sleeves and work together on a real project.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The premise behind Infomart is simple. Busy executives or even casual
shoppers can drop by the building to request demonstrations of a company's
latest products, ranging from new lap-tops to corporate-size information
networks. Instead of spending days or weeks visiting individual companies, a
company's computer managers and executives can visit many major information
technology companies under one roof.;   An estimated 350,000 visitors are
expected to pass through the building this year -- about 5 percent of them
from abroad and most of them corporate officers and computer managers on
scouting missions.;   On request, Infomart officials will arrange
presentations by any resident companies. Among those who have come for
briefings are Allstate, the Labor Department, Occidental Petroleum and a group
of six police departments shopping together.;   Among the companies sitting
down to create a single integrated network are Apple Computer, IBM, NCR and
its new owner AT&amp;T, Novell and Xerox. If it works as planned, Martnet will
enable Infomart tenants to send and receive information -- voice, data and
eventually video -- almost as easily as they use a telephone.;   "We've taken
the most complicated environment that you could be subjected to and put
together a network that would allow extremely diverse architectures to talk
together," said Ron Scott, president of Access Communication, a Dallas company
that is coordinating the Martnet project.;   Scott said the collaboration had
been surprisingly smooth despite the skepticism of some participants. "They're
all willing to work together because they realize that proprietary systems are
a thing of the past," he said.;   Infomart is a 1.6 million-square-foot
building patterned after the Crystal Palace, a world trade center built in
London in the mid-19th century. Some 115 information technology companies have
leased showrooms in the Infomart, where they demonstrate their wares,
including computers, software, telecommunications, copiers, facsimile
machines, computer-aided manufacturing systems, network cables and consulting
and training services.;   The center has a 60 percent occupancy rate, said Tom
Jones, its vice president for marketing, and is now in the black. The majority
owner is the Trammell Crow real estate family.;   Among the other tenants are
Electronic Data Systems, Texas Instruments, Epson America, Minolta, Grid
Systems, Banyan Systems, GTE, Datapoint, Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software, the Open
Systems Group, Prodigy Services, Compuserve, Picturetel and Advanced Logic
Research.;   The Infomart is also home to dozens of smaller high-tech
businesses. It is by far the most ambitious such project, far larger than the
Techmart in Santa Clara or the Inforum in Atlanta.;   Until now, shoppers have
had to go from Company A to Company B to Company C, getting each sales pitch
separately. The problem has been that executives want to know if Company A's
computers will work with Company B's computers.;   Apple, for example, is
routinely asked to guarantee compatibility with IBM computers and demonstrate
how they work together. IBM does not want to fill its showcase with NCR,
Xerox, Apple and AT&amp;T products just to show compatibility.;   The solution is
to connect all the showrooms in the Infomart, including the various networks
already in place, on a buildingwide fiber-optic network. Thirty-two miles of
fiber-optic cable have been laid by AT&amp;T, and Synoptics Communications Inc.
has provided the hubs that connect all 700 locations on the network.;   The
Novell Corp. has provided much of the operating software. The new Martnet
network system will eventually connect every room in the vast building using
two wiring schemes common in businesses, 10BaseT and Token Ring, as well as
FDDI (for fiber-optic data distribution interface), an emerging standard for
high-speed communications that uses light pulses instead of electrons.;   "We
found it a great savings of time," said Mark Schroefer, vice president and
controller of Pentair Inc., a $1.2 billion manufacturing company in St. Paul,
Minn. Seventeen Pentair officials have visited the center for presentations
and meetings.;   The fiber-optic backbone of the system, the wiring and the
control systems were all pronounced operational last week. By the end of the
year, the officials said, every office and showroom in the Informart will be
connected to an electronic mail system. Shared computer applications will be
added gradually.  </TEXT>
