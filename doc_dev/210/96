Last-minute objections from leading computer suppliers have delayed, for the
time being, a move which would have redrawn the battle lines in the
so-called operating systems wars.
Novell, the US-based market leader in PC networking, which earlier this year
completed a Dollars 320m (Pounds 208m) acquisition of Unix Systems
Laboratories from AT&amp;T, had planned to 'give away' the rights to the Unix
operating system to X/Open, a computer industry consortium including IBM,
Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems. X/Open is concerned to set standards
which ensure that versions of Unix from different manufacturers are
compatible and allow applications software to be moved freely between
machines.
Now objections by a number of the companies which would have been affected
by the deal have stalled Novell's plan to relinquish the rights to Unix. The
idea had been that passing control of Unix to an industry consortium would
silence critics who argue that control of such an important piece of
software should not rest with any one company.
It is understood the objections turn around disagreements over who will fund
further Unix developments and questions about the future of networking
software independently developed by companies in the X/Open consortium.
Intense lobbying means that it is likely the plan will eventually go ahead,
but in the interim Novell has announced a plan to: 'Bring PC market
economics to the Unix marketplace.'
Unix is one of a number of competing operating systems which are being
promoted as the key to 'client-server' computing, networks of personal
computers and servers which are expected to take over from mainframe
computers for many corporate applications. Unix allows many users to work on
the same computer system and individual users to work on several programs
simultaneously. Designed originally for mid-range computers, it is effective
on today's very powerful reduced instruction set computing (Risc)
processors.
Its principal rival as industry standard operating software is Windows NT,
released a few weeks ago by Microsoft, the US software house which dominates
personal computer software.
Novell said earlier this week that in order to increase the appeal of Unix
to the personal computer sector it would speed up the integration between
Unix and Novell's own 'NetWare' network operating system.
In practical terms this means that Novell's own version of Unix, UnixWare,
will be incorporated into the Unix source code written for Intel
microprocessors. Intel chips power some 80 per cent of today's personal
computers.
By 1994, according to Novell, it will be able to provide common network
management, system directories and other features which will allow NetWare
and Unix to be tightly integrated. This means that computer companies
building systems around Unix will not have to worry about designing new
network software connections; that will be handled by the Unix/NetWare
specification.
In other words, it should be easier to build enterprise-wide information
management systems - existing local area networks running on NetWare can be
more simply integrated with Unix software at the heart of the system.
The new software will be submitted to X/Open for its approval. Novell hopes
to gain in market share and market unity what it will lose in development
autonomy. Ray Noorda, Novell chief executive, said: 'Novell bought the Unix
system to lead the industry in unifying it, while increasing its openness
and strengthening its value to customers through volume distribution. Our
business is to extend the value of the Unix system to the tens of millions
of industry-standard computers shipped with Intel processors.'
This week ICL, the UK-based manufacturer owned by Fujitsu of Japan and a big
supporter of X/Open, said it supported the Novell UnixWare strategy and
welcomed its decision to offer to move control of Unix to the consortium.
Peter Stuart, business strategy manager for ICL's client-server systems
division, said it would result in a significant reduction of confusion in
the market.
