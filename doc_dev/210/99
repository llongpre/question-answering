THE FACTORY of the future may fast be turning into a present-day reality,
but suppliers and customers in perhaps the most complex and diverse modern
industrial sectors are still learning lessons from the mistakes of the past.
Computers - corporate-level mainframes, computer-aided design (Cad) in the
drawing office, production control systems, manufacturing resource planning
systems and much more besides - have changed the face of manufacturing over
the past 20 years. Often, however, they have simply added to manufacturing's
problems.
Customers on both sides of the Atlantic have bought too much equipment,
believing that computer - integrated manufacturing was simply a case of
giving everyone a computer screen, bought oversophisticated equipment,
failed to understand the cultural implications of a computer investment or
simply bought the wrong system for their needs.
Suppliers bear much of the blame. Dr Matthew Barekat, managing director of
Company Doctors International, recalls a case where the supplier of software
to control a batch manufacturing system tried to convince a process
manufacturer, for which the system would have been totally unsuitable, to
purchase the system by changing it very slightly.
Episodes like this go some way to explain the very high failure rates of,
and unrealistic expectations for, computers in the manufacturing
environment. At the same time, there has also been considerable
dissatisfaction at board level about companies' computer investments,
because they have hitherto been seen by chief executives as islands of
automation that have not been linked together properly, says Mr Garreth
Evans, Computervision's UK managing director.
But attitudes are now changing, just as manufacturers themselves are trying
to simplify their production processes to address the big competitive
challenges of the 1990s.
The move towards small, simple manufacturing cells with varying levels of
automation is aimed at producing truly flexible manufacturing and sharply
reducing cycle times, and manufacturers are looking for computer systems
that support rather than smother the process.
And just as the recession is forcing chief executives to control capital
spending tightly, bosses are at last realising that they have to become
involved in the major computer decisions that might previously have been
left to separate departments.
Indeed, manufacturers have to understand the need to develop a business
strategy and then find the right computer system, rather than the other way
round, says Mr John Crampton, a director of Ingersoll Engineers.
The change in attitude coincides with some important technology developments
 -in software at least - over the past two or three years, with more to
come, that hold the key to achieving what Frost &amp; Sullivan, the market
research group, recently called 'a factory in which there is computer-based,
seamless integration of people functions, information technology, and
manufacturing processes to achieve business objectives defined by management
goals'.
That is achievable now, although too many manufacturers are held back by
their past mistakes, and by, for example, computer-aided engineering
software that cannot communicate with a business mainframe. On Tuesday,
however, the start of the three-day Computers in Manufacturing show at
Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre will show how many of the old
problems can be avoided.
Experts on the use of computers in manufacturing point to a number of
significant developments over the past two to three years. The introduction
of so-called fourth generation computer languages has done a great deal,
says Dr Barekat, to increase computers' flexibility, and offered a real
opportunity to write a new breed of software for industry.
The trend towards open systems - non-exclusive, non-proprietary standards
for computer and communication environments - also offers immense
opportunities for manufacturers to create effective interfaces between
different elements of their computer systems. 'Vendors who remain
proprietorial will go to the wall - and a good thing too,' says Mr Evans.
If applied correctly, such developments ought to go a long way to address
what is now seen almost universally as the key challenge for major western
world manufacturers in the 1990s - reducing 'time-to-market' or product
development times. The concept of 'concurrent engineering' where all
sections of a company, and often its suppliers, work in teams to develop new
products, rather than taking on each task in sequence, is rapidly gaining
acceptance.
Achieving it is partly a cultural issue - Japanese manufacturers have called
the tune on product development times without heavy reliance on technology.
The use of three-dimensional Cad, seen in the west as a prerequisite for
successful concurrent engineering, is surprisingly rare in Japan.
Western companies have traditionally found the 'people issues' surrounding
manufacturing technology hard to handle - the 'failure' of MRPII
(manufacturing resources planning), one of the vogue computerised systems of
the 1970s for providing company-wide production information, is widely
attributed to a lack of training, or of involvement of users in the initial
purchasing decision.
Hence the relatively high priority given to technology solutions. Some of
the major technology contributions to reducing time-to-market are happening
within discrete parts of the process. The use of parametrics, an
'intelligent' system which automatically adjusts a Cad design for the change
of one or more dimensions, is 'taking off' says Mr Crampton, citing a
manufacturing company which was able to output a design that previously took
three months in three to four minutes.
Increasingly, however, manufacturers are realising the need for accurate,
shared information to be available to all departments which participate in
the concurrent engineering process - and external suppliers. This puts an
added premium on company-wide engineering databases and data interchange,
the success of which will depend crucially on open systems.
Mr Keith Nichols, director of EDS Scicon's manufacturing consultancy, says
the bulk of product databases are supporting small teams, but reports
considerable progress in the UK over the past three years towards what he
calls the 'million file challenge,' an indication that the product database
is broad enough for information to be truly shared.
Another problem area, he says, is in technology links with suppliers. As big
manufacturers increasingly push design work out to subcontractors, the need
for accurate, updated information grows. 'If you freeze a supply chain now,
you would find that 50 per cent of the data is out-of-date, he says.'
This points up the need for electronic data interchange (EDI) links between
manufacturers and subcontractors, especially when large numbers of companies
are involved. AT&amp;T Istel, for example, is working on a pilot programme with
Rover which will eventually link the UK car producer with 200 suppliers via
an electronic 'mailbox'.
The recession may have turned manufacturers into more discerning customers
for computer systems, but has almost certainly increased their resolve to
address the big manufacturing issues in order to survive.
The use and importance of computers also changes significantly during a
recession, according to Ms Anthea Ballam of the consultants Ballam Malaguti
International. The information provided by computers becomes much more
valuable than in boom times when the finer points of the manufacturing
control system tend to be overlooked, she says. Meanwhile, cuts in
management layers have obliged managers to work across the boundaries of
their sphere of operation, and acquire a more integrated picture of the
whole manufacturing operation.
It is partly for these reasons, therefore, that the inevitable downturn in
spending during the recession has been significantly less than for capital
equipment as a whole. A survey by Benchmark Research, to be released for the
CIM show, says UK industry plans to spend Pounds 1.5bn on computer-based
manufacturing applications in the next 12 months, down just 4 per cent on
the previous year.
The survey, encouragingly, shows that open systems are beginning to take
off, with 22 per cent of manufacturing sites that have computers using open
systems against 15 per cent in 1991. And 84 per cent of the 1,300 sites
surveyed said the need to integrate systems was a major reason for
investment.
Suppliers will be trying to address their needs in the 1990s with products
that currently remain on the drawing-board. One emerging area, says AT&amp;T
Istel, is ERP or enterprise resource planning - a phrase coined by the
Gartner Group, the US consultancy - which will use technologies such as
artificial intelligence and relational databases to create a complete 'data
model' for all aspects of multi-company enterprises, including Europe's big
manufacturers.
At the shopfloor level, Dr Barekat has advocated the concept of 'distributed
MRP,' small-scale MRPII systems at manufacturing cell level, linked by a
plant-wide network of PCs or workstations but giving each cell
responsibility for its own scheduling. The 'passive' IT users, meanwhile -
accounts, sales and administrative departments - keep a conventional
centralised MRPII system.
One can be fairly confident that yet more acronyms will be coined over the
next few years to replace those that have fallen out of favour.
