  [Text] In a joint declaration Paraguayan President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
last night described the Pilcomayo River and the areas around it 
as a decisive factor in promoting integration among Argentina, 
Bolivia, and Paraguay, and decided to invite Argentine President 
Carlos Saul Menem to a meeting with a view to seeking formulas 
that would be instrumental in jointly undertaking mutually 
beneficial development projects. 
  Paraguay and Bolivia also stated that they are committed to 
fighting the drug trade, and agreed to hold permanent 
consultations between senior officers of their two countries. 
The Paraguayan Government supports "the search for a negotiated 
agreement" to provide Bolivia with an outlet to the Pacific 
Ocean. Sanchez de Lozada has characterized this goal as "an 
unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people." 
  In the joint declaration, which was signed at Lopez Palace, 
Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada attached special significance to 
the Pilcomayo River, but did not go into detail. They agreed, 
however, to invite President Menem to a joint meeting to 
undertake joint projects. They have not set any specific date 
for this meeting. They have also acknowledged that the abuse of 
and illegal trade in narcotics and dangerous substances are a 
serious threat to the health and well-being of all peoples, and 
noted that all nations must assume their share of responsibility 
in fighting this scourge at every level and in all of its forms. 
They reiterated their commitment to fighting the drug trade, 
and agreed to urgently implement bilateral actions. 
  To strengthen friendly relations and cooperation between 
their two countries, they have decided -- based on a proposal 
from the Bolivian Government -- to hold consultations between 
senior officers of their respective Armed Forces, through 
periodic meetings to be held at least once a year, alternating 
in Bolivia and Paraguay. 
  Regarding the gas pipeline, Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada 
emphasized the work of the energy technical commission that is 
studying the sale to Paraguay of Bolivian natural gas through 
the gas pipeline project, of liquefied gas, and of gasoline. 
They conveyed their desire to have the project implemented as 
soon as possible with the participation of the private sectors 
of both countries. 
  They also expressed their satisfaction over the progress and 
consolidation of the democratic system both in the world and 
within the region. They regard this as a guarantee for the full 
exercise of human rights and a necessary condition for achieving 
socioeconomic development. 
  They also mentioned the efforts made to find formulas that 
would enable Bolivia to gradually move closer to and join 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. 
  They agreed on the need to strengthen the Agreement on 
Coordination and Cooperation among Bolivia, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay (Urupabol), which was reactivated on 16 October 1993, 
and emphasized the consultations taking place among the three 
countries with a view to holding, as soon as possible, a meeting 
of their three foreign ministers. 
  Among other points, President Wasmosy informed his Bolivian 
counterpart that the Paraguayan Government is studying a project 
to build a dam in Bahia Negra to check the Paraguay River water 
flow. He noted that this project will generate a development 
process in vast areas in the region, will make the river 
navigable along its entire course, and will decrease ecological 
risks. 
  They also stated that it would be useful to improve customs 
monitoring at their common border. A customs office will be set 
up in General Garay. Sanchez de Lozada stated that the goal of 
obtaining a sovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean is a 
fundamental topic in Bolivian foreign policy, and "an 
unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people." Wasmosy voiced 
his government's unwavering support in the search for a 
negotiated agreement on this issue.
