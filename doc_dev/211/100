  [Text] La Paz, 7 Feb (LOS TIEMPOS) -- The government does 
not discard the possibility of buying land off the peasants who 
grow coca in the Chapare and Yungas, which are traditional coca 
zones, "as a means to finally eradicate all illegal trafficking 
in Bolivia." 
  Government Ministry sources told LOS TIEMPOS on 7 February 
that the project to buy land from the peasants was proposed by 
the government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada during the 
latest meeting of the World Bank Consultative Group for Bolivia 
late last year. 
  The sources said: "This option was proposed by the 
negotiating commission that went to Washington to the 
international community as a start of the Zero Option project." 
  They said the administration is seriously studying the idea 
of buying from the thousands of peasants "their land" used for 
growing coca. 
  The sources added: "The offer of $2,000 for every hectare 
cleared of coca made by the previous government to Chapare 
peasants, with a bonus of $500 per tract of land cleared of coca 
is not an empty proposal." 
  The sources indicated that the government is willing to pay 
up to $2,500 per hectare of coca to each peasant. 
  They added: "This means a farmer with 5,000 hectares, for 
example, will have the possibility of getting approximately 
$10,000 per hectare for the land he puts up for sale." 
[sentence as published] 
  President Sanchez de Lozada decided to implement this 
project 
which was labeled "Zero Option" but the project is subject to 
international financing for its implementation in the 
medium-term.
