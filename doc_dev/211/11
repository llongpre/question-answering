  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 17 Mar (NA) -- President Carlos 
Menem and his Bolivian counterpart, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, 
today analyzed, among other subjects, the probable granting of 
Argentine credits for environmental sanitary projects on the 
common border area between the two countries for the purpose of 
preventing the spread of cholera, the situation of illegal 
Bolivian immigrants in Argentina, the struggle against drug 
trafficking, and the projections of Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South]. 
  Sanchez de Lozada today arrived in Argentina on an official 
48-hour visit with the objective of signing an agreement on 
plant and animal sanitary controls and an agreement on 
investment promotion and guarantees. 
  President Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella received 
the Bolivian president at 1020 today in Metropolitan Airport's 
military section. 
  After the welcoming protocol, City Council President Juan 
Trilla, from the Radical Civic Union, gave the Bolivian chief of 
state the keys to the city. 
  During a brief news conference after the ceremony, Sanchez 
de 
Lozada said one of the subjects he would discuss with Menem is 
the situation of some of his fellow countrymen living illegally 
in Argentina. 
  He added: "The control of drug trafficking is very 
important, 
and with the aid of Argentina and the international community we 
will be able to stop this problem." [passage omitted] 
  Regarding drug trafficking control, Sanchez de Lozada said: 
"It is a very important subject, and we will speak about the 
Bolivian criteria to ask Argentina and the international 
community for help to put an end to this phenomenon, which is 
something we cannot stop." 
  He added that the future of Bolivia "depends a lot on what 
is 
going on in Argentina, on the possibility of increasing 
exchange, and on a rapprochement" between the two countries.
