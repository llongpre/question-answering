  [Text] La Paz, 30 Dec (EFE) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada today announced that 1994 will be the year of 
great structural changes, when the traditional "come back 
tomorrow" of public administration will become a thing of the 
past. 
  Sanchez de Lozada today, Thursday, met with the local press 
at a rural spa in Cochabamba, where he is resting for a few days 
to "recharge his batteries" before facing the challenge of the 
change beginning with the preparation of the nation's general 
budget. 
  The president explained that the budget proposal he will 
send 
to congress will be accompanied by several draft laws "which 
will give meaning to the budget" and which will implement the 
structural changes. 
  "The first drafts show that more than half of the budget 
will 
be earmarked for the social area," Sanchez de Lozada said, 
because "great structural changes must be made to cover the 
growing social needs, to serve as the basis of the coming year: 
capitalization, educational reform, law against corruption, 
people's participation, and simplification of bureaucracy." 
  The 63-year-old Bolivian president said that for 1994 there 
will be an increase [in salaries] of 7.5 percent in order to 
maintain the purchasing power of the salary and that will be 
equal to the inflation rate calculated for this year. 
  "If we begin with greater increases, we will have higher 
inflation, greater deficit, and a lower level of economic 
growth," Sanchez de Lozada said, and asked whether it was worth 
having considerable increases, which would later be overcome by 
the increases in prices. 
  He ruled out the reported increase in fuel prices which 
prompted the increase in prices and hoarding of other products, 
and added that he will adopt other measures to improve income, 
such as reducing the tax rates and increasing the tax base. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said that a system to simplify state 
administration transactions will be implemented next year, thus 
seeking "to eliminate the torment the citizens" must go through 
when they are involved in these transactions and to eliminate 
from public offices the "come back tomorrow." 
  He ruled out any change in his cabinet. "It was so difficult 
for me to organize it," he said. He added that if it does not 
yield the expected results in the future, there might be some 
changes. 
  He compared the structure of the Council of Ministers he 
inherited from the previous government with a "Model-T Ford with 
which we could not win a formula one race." He added: "I built a 
race car that could not start because it was not well tuned." 
  Sanchez de Lozada was optimistic over the state of his "race 
car" although he admitted that "if we begin to run strong and if 
some part breaks down we will have to fix it quickly" to meet 
the expectations of the Bolivians who want to see the government 
working. 
  The Bolivian president will return from Cochabamba, 383 
kilometers east of La Paz, next week.
