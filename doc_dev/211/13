  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Mar (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
and his Bolivian counterpart, Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada, today 
analyzed, among other subjects, the probable granting of 
Argentine credits for environmental sanitary projects on the 
common border area between the two countries for the purpose of 
preventing the spread of cholera, the situation of illegal 
Bolivian immigrants in Argentina, the struggle against drug 
trafficking, and the projections of Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South]. 
  Sanchez de Losada today arrived in Argentina on an official 
48-hour visit with the objective of signing an agreement on 
plant and animal sanitary controls and an agreement on 
investment promotion and guarantees. 
  President Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella received 
the Bolivian president at 1020 today in Metropolitan Airport's 
military section. 
  After the welcoming protocol, City Council President Juan 
Trilla, from the Radical Civic Union, gave the Bolivian chief of 
state the keys to the city. 
  During a brief news conference after the ceremony, Sanchez 
de 
Losada said one of the subjects he would discuss with Menem is 
the situation of some of his fellow countrymen living illegally 
in Argentina. 
  He added: "The control of drug trafficking is very 
important, 
and with the aid of Argentina and the international community we 
will be able to stop this problem." 
  As for the possibility that Bolivia will join Mercosur, the 
Bolivian president said: "We want to come close to Mercosur 
because we are part of the Amazon Basin," adding that "our 
future depends on exchange with the region's countries." 
  After making these statements, Sanchez de Losada departed 
for 
Alvear Palace Hotel, from where he headed to Casa Rosada, where 
he held his first working meeting with Menem. 
  After the meeting in Government House, the two presidents 
went to San Martin Palace, where Menem held a lunch in honor of 
his guest. 
  The Bolivian president had anticipated that during his visit 
to Argentina he would talk with President Menem about subjects 
like illegal immigrants, Mercosur, cholera, and the canalization 
of the Pilcomayo River. 
  Sanchez de Losada said Argentina is, for Bolivians, "almost 
a 
second fatherland; one is always very connected with this 
country and thousands of Bolivians currently live in Buenos 
Aires," which determines "a relation of vital importance for us." 
  When asked whether the subject of illegal Bolivian 
immigrants 
will be discussed, he said "that will be one of the subjects we 
will discuss" and added that they will also discuss the 
canalization of the Pilcomayo River, which is "one of Bolivia's 
major concerns." 
  "The Pilcomayo River is dwindling away and it is important 
for Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina," he said. 
  Regarding drug trafficking control, Sanchez de Losada said: 
"It is a very important subject, and we will speak about the 
Bolivian criteria to ask Argentina and the international 
community for help to put an end to this phenomenon, which is 
something we cannot stop." 
  He added that the future of Bolivia "depends a lot on what 
is 
going on in Argentina, on the possibility of increasing 
exchange, and on a rapprochement" between the two countries.
