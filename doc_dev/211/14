  [Excerpts] In a joint declaration Paraguayan President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
last night described the Pilcomayo River and the areas around it 
as a decisive factor in promoting integration among Argentina, 
Bolivia, and Paraguay, and decided to invite Argentine President 
Carlos Saul Menem to a meeting with a view to seeking formulas 
that would be instrumental in jointly undertaking mutually 
beneficial development projects. 
  Paraguay and Bolivia also stated that they are committed to 
fighting the drug trade, and agreed to hold permanent 
consultations between senior officers of their two countries. 
The Paraguayan Government supports "the search for a negotiated 
agreement" to provide Bolivia with an outlet to the Pacific 
Ocean. Sanchez de Lozada has characterized this goal as "an 
unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people." 
  In the joint declaration, which was signed at Lopez Palace, 
Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada attached special significance to 
the Pilcomayo River, but did not go into detail. They agreed, 
however, to invite President Menem to a joint meeting to 
undertake joint projects. They have not set any specific date 
for this meeting. They have also acknowledged that the abuse of 
and illegal trade in narcotics and dangerous substances are a 
serious threat to the health and well-being of all peoples, and 
noted that all nations must assume their share of responsibility 
in fighting this scourge at every level and in all of its forms. 
They reiterated their commitment to fighting the drug trade, 
and agreed to urgently implement bilateral actions. 
  To strengthen friendly relations and cooperation between 
their two countries, they have decided -- based on a proposal 
from the Bolivian Government -- to hold consultations between 
senior officers of their respective Armed Forces, through 
periodic meetings to be held at least once a year, alternating 
in Bolivia and Paraguay. [passage omitted]
