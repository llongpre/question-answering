  [Text] La Paz, 20 Mar (EFE) -- Government sources told EFE 
that Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will reshuffle 
his cabinet in the next few days. 
  A majority of La Paz newspapers said in their front pages on 
20 March that Sanchez de Lozada will reshuffle his cabinet, 
dismissing some of his ministers and changing the assignment of 
others, possibly on 22 March. 
  The sources consulted by EFE said the ministers who will 
almost surely leave the government are Defense Minister Antonio 
Cespedes, Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters, and Interior Minister 
German Quiroga. 
  The same sources said the "super ministers" of economic 
development, Fernando Illanes, and human development, Fernando 
Romero, will have their assignments changed. 
  The sources also said that current Minister of the 
Presidency 
Carlos Sanchez Berzain and an outstanding entrepreneur and 
political leader from Santa Cruz are the leading candidates to 
replace Interior Minister Quiroga if he leaves the cabinet. 
  Sanchez de Lozada's government is formed by a coalition of 
his party, the liberal Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR), 
the populist Civic Solidarity Union (UCS), and the social 
democratic Free Bolivia Movement (MBL). 
  The UCS, the party granting the MNR control of the absolute 
majority in Congress, presently has one of its members as head 
of the Defense Ministry. The post was assigned to Antonio 
Cespedes, but he is expected to leave the government because his 
own party has requested that he be removed. 
  The MBL, whose votes in Congress are not essential, was able 
to get the Foreign Ministry for its leader Antonio Aranibar. His 
continuation is assured because he seems to be Sanchez de 
Lozada's government's most popular minister. 
  Sanchez de Lozada formed his government on 6 August 1993 
after his victory by a relative majority in the 6 June 1993 
election. 
  In these seven months of government, Sanchez de Lozada's 
cabinet has established the legislative basis for a future 
absolute transformation of the Bolivian economy and 
administration. 
  The key instruments in this transformation are the 
Capitalization Law to privatize public companies, and the 
People's Participation Law to give more power to citizens in the 
political and administrative decisionmaking process and the 
allotment of state resources through the country's 
municipalization. 
  Sanchez de Lozada also has reorganized the executive branch 
by significantly reducing, among other things, the number of 
ministries.
