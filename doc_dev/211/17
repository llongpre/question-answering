  [Text] Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada on 16 
March ratified in Buenos Aires his country's desire to join the 
Common Market of the South [Mercosur], which includes Argentina, 
Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay. The Bolivian president is here 
on an official visit, and during his first meeting with Carlos 
Menem he discussed the signing of several bilateral agreements. 
He also began discussions to obtain a measure of exception that 
will allow Bolivians who reside here to obtain their residence 
documents. 
  "For Bolivians, Argentina is practically their second 
fatherland. Thousands of Bolivians reside in Buenos Aires and 
throughout Argentina and contribute toward this country with 
their work," Sanchez de Losada said on his arrival in the 
country. 
  Regarding the possibility of joining Mercosur, the Bolivian 
president said: "I have very much wanted to approach Mercosur 
because we are a part of the Pacific's Amazon Basin, but we also 
belong to the River Plate Basin." But a diplomatic source 
indicated that the possibility is very remote and could only 
happen within the framework of a Brazilian initiative to create 
a giant South American common market. 
  Moreover, the agenda's main topic is the signing of an 
agreement that will permit the free exchange of gas, oil, and 
their by-products with an eye on bilateral integration in the 
energy sector. Argentine credits for the prevention of cholera 
in border areas is also an agenda topic.
