  [Text] The meeting that had been scheduled for 20 March in 
Formosa, Argentina, among Paraguayan President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy, Argentine President Carlos Menem, and Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has been postponed. The 
decision was prompted by the fact that Sanchez de Lozada could 
not attend the meeting, because he is scheduled to meet in La 
Paz with U.S. Vice President Al Gore on that day. 
  The three presidents had been scheduled to meet on 20 March 
to discuss the Pilcomayo River issue. Yet the above problem has 
forced a postponement of the "minisummit" to a later date. 
  During Sanchez de Lozada's recent visit to Asuncion, 
Bolivian 
Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga noted that the Formosa 
presidential summit might be postponed. It was confirmed 
yesterday at Lopez Palace that the meeting has in fact been 
postponed.
