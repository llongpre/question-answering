  [Text] La Paz, 22 Jun (LOS TIEMPOS) -- The metaphor about 
the "milk and the cow" was thoroughly explained today by 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, when he said that even if 
Bolivia gets a sovereign sea outlet -- it wants to take concrete 
steps on the sea issue with Chile -- it must also get several 
outlets on both the Pacific and Atlantic, with the full use of 
the port of Ilo in Peru as well as the Paraguay-Parana waterway 
and other ports in Argentina and Uruguay. 
  "Even though the sea outlet claim is a valid issue, though 
problematic and difficult, we want to make progress in all 
fields -- cultural, political, and economic -- in all fields 
related to our great effort to have a sea outlet on the Pacific 
and outlets through the waterway," said President Sanchez at a 
news conference held today to talk about the positive aspects of 
his tour of the United States and Colombia. 
  The controversial statement made by President Sanchez de 
Lozada after meeting with Chilean President Eduardo Frei 
prompted a wave of protests for an allegedly antipatriotic 
policy on the sea outlet issue. 
  This policy was denied today by President Sanchez de Lozada, 
who said that the talk with President Frei was from any point of 
view very positive, because the sea outlet issue will be debated 
during the Rio Group summit next September. 
  "We want to see concrete things, concrete steps to improve 
the Bolivian situation," said Sanchez de Lozada, who pointed out 
the work being carried out by Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori, whom, he said, was carrying out "concrete" work 
allowing greater binational contacts, one proof of which is the 
highway linking the port of Ilo with the Bolivian border. 
  The explanation given by President Sanchez de Lozada on the 
metaphor he used after meeting with President Frei was mainly 
related to the fact that Bolivia has to use other "outlets" to 
the Pacific and Atlantic, and these would be the port of Ilo in 
Peru and the Paraguay-Parana waterway, because Bolivia is 
entering a stage of economic and productive expansion for which 
it is necessary to seek ports for exports. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said: "Even if Bolivia gets a sovereign 
sea outlet -- and this is our great goal and struggle, which 
will not change in this government or in any other -- we must 
also find other ports that will not be Bolivian, but Chilean, 
Peruvian, and on the waterway of the River Plate Basin. In its 
projection abroad Bolivia must show that by negotiating with our 
neighbors we can get benefits without having direct ownership of 
those ports and their installations." 
  In this regard, President Sanchez de Lozada said there is a 
feeling of solidarity in the neighboring countries (Peru, 
Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay) which makes him believe that 
Chile will also enter a new stage of relations for mutual 
benefit. 
  Therefore, said Sanchez de Lozada, it is hoped that for the 
September meeting the Bolivian and Chilean Foreign Ministries 
will prepare a work agenda that will consider the issues 
dividing the two countries under a new spirit of friendly 
relations.
