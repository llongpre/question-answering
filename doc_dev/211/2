  [Text] La Paz, 9 Jun (EFE) -- The Bolivian Foreign Ministry 
confirmed today that Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada and Chilean President Eduardo Frei will meet within the 
framework of the Fourth Ibero-American summit to be held in 
Cartagena, Colombia. 
  The Bolivian Foreign Ministry reported that the two heads of 
state, who will attend the Fourth Ibero-American summit on 14 
and 15 June, will take the opportunity to hold an informal 
meeting. 
  This will be the second time Sanchez de Lozada and Frei have 
met since August 1993; the other time was during Sanchez de 
Lozada's inauguration. 
  The Bolivian president took advantage of another 
international meeting, the Rio Group meeting in Santiago, to 
meet with Chilean President Patricio Aylwin and then Chilean 
President-elect Eduardo Frei. 
  Bolivia and Chile have had no diplomatic ties since 1962 -- 
except for a brief three-year period (1975-78) -- as a result of 
a territorial dispute and Bolivia's demand for a sovereign sea 
outlet to the Pacific across land that has belonged to Chile 
since the 19th century. 
  The Bolivian Congress authorized Sanchez de Lozada to travel 
to Colombia to attend the Ibero-American summit which will be 
attended by the heads of state from Latin America, Spain, and 
Portugal. The summit will be held in Cartagena on 14 and 15 
June. 
  Congress also authorized Sanchez de Lozada to travel to the 
United States, where he will attend the opening game of the 
World Soccer Cup at Soldier Field in Chicago; Bolivia will play 
Germany on 17 June.
