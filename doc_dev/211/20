  [TEXT] La Paz, 25 Mar (EFE) -- Carlos Sanchez Berzain, 
minister secretary general of the presidency, reported that 
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada delayed until 26 
March the installation of his new ministers following today's 
collective resignation of his cabinet. 
  Sanchez Berzain said that President Sanchez is putting the 
final touches on his new cabinet during meetings he held today 
at his residence in Obrajes, a residential district in La Paz. 
  Political sources said the possibility exists of Sanchez de 
Lozada appointing a new aide who would be in charge of 
implementing the Popular Participation project, which currently 
is being discussed in Congress.
