  [Text] Let us now report on President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada's participation in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada held a working breakfast meeting with Chilean 
President Eduardo Frei this morning. The two presidents 
discussed such issues as exports and the Bolivian claim to the 
sea coast. 
  [Sanchez] We discussed it, we looked at it, and we said that 
this is a current problem. How can we solve it? The solution 
has not... [Sanchez recording ends abruptly] 
  [Reporter] The foreign media asked President Sanchez if a 
sea 
outlet was the only way for Bolivia to integrate itself into a 
modern economy. 
  [Sanchez] The sea outlet is the only way, but this is not 
necessarily related to... [Sanchez recording ends abruptly] 
  [Reporter] In addition to the issue of the sea outlet, other 
important issues for the two countries were also discussed. 
  [Frei] Issues such as economic complementation, physical 
integration, seeking common positions on matters of education, 
and joint binational projects such as natural gas, which is an 
important energy issue for Bolivia. 
  [Reporter] How would you label this meeting? 
  [Frei] Positive and very cordial. 
  [Reporter] The result of the working breakfast meeting 
between the two presidents was the preparation of an agenda for 
the two foreign ministries. [end recording] 
  The meeting was positive and cordial, an important meeting. 
There are differences, and we are under the impression that 
President Frei recognizes them despite the Chilean official 
position that Chile has nothing pending with Bolivia. There is 
a long way to go, but this process, which we believe is 
loosening up, is a good one, without illusions but with clear 
ideas. Let us now listen to Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at the 
Ibero-American Summit: 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] Are there plans for a new 
meeting between the Bolivian and Chilean presidents next 
September? 
  [Sanchez] Yes, that is true, and a request was made to the 
foreign ministries to prepare an agenda for the different 
committees to start working, looking at the problems. The sea 
issue was raised, but we did not make any progress on that 
point. We want to make progress on all issues, including the 
sea issue. 
  [Reporter] What about natural gas? 
  [Sanchez] The natural gas issue was also definitely raised, 
and there seems to be a very good predisposition and some 
contacts with Chilean state companies. This kind of negotiation 
seems to be the best way for people who are used to working on 
projects, and not to getting involved in diplomatic subtleties. 
  [Reporter] Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada labeled the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit positive. [end recording]
