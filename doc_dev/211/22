  [Excerpt] After arriving in our country to settle the 
details, Bolivian Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Gumucio announced 
that Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will make an 
official visit to Peru. According to the Bolivian official, the 
Bolivian president will arrive in Lima on 5 July. Diplomatic 
sources indicated that Sanchez de Lozada's visit will be an 
opportunity to promote mutual cooperation and integration. 
  The confirmation of such an important visit was made by the 
Bolivian vice foreign minister at a time when there is a lot of 
interest in Peru to increase trade ties that began with the 
installation of an industrial free zone in the port of Ilo. 
  The Foreign Ministry has also reported that President 
Alberto 
Fujimori has officially invited Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria to visit the country. In a letter he sent to Gaviria, 
Fujimori highlights the close ties that unite the two nations. 
The invitation was made as a result of the visit Fujimori made 
to Bogota in February. [passage omitted]
