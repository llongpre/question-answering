  [Excerpt] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada arrived on 
15 January in Laguna de los Patos Airport in the Uruguayan city 
of Colonia. There he was met by the Colonia mayor and then 
talked to the press. 
  [Begin recording] [Sanchez de Lozada] Well now, we hope for 
informal and frank bilateral approaches and approaches with 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. We hope we will be able 
to approach this market that is so important for Bolivia and 
that will become more important in the future. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The Uruguayan press announced during 
the past few hours that Presidents Lacalle, Menem, and Wasmosy 
[of Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay, respectively] reportedly 
have virtually accepted Chile's and Bolivia's entry in the near 
future. 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Well now, we have some problems because 
we are still part of the Andean market. We do not want to quit 
this pact. Nevertheless, we would like to become a hinge and 
actually be received by this agreement. If there is such a 
political will, it would be something good, but we will wait for 
this to become official. If it becomes official, we will 
consider it with much interest. [passage omitted] [end
