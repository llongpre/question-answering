  [Text] Sucre, Bolivia, 26 May (EFE) -- Bolivian President 
Sanchez de Lozada announced today his intention of establishing 
a Constitutional Court to restructure the judiciary. 
  After meeting with Supreme Court members in Sucre, the 
country's administrative capital, Sanchez de Lozada announced 
that he will promote the establishment of a Constitutional Court 
during the extraordinary congressional sessions that started 
last week, and during which the constitution will be amended. 
  After meeting with Sanchez de Lozada, acting Chief Justice 
Gualberto Davalos expressed the Supreme Court's opposition to 
the establishment of a Constitutional Court. 
  Davalos explained that the Bolivian Supreme Court has and 
will always oppose the establishment of a Constitutional Court, 
because it believes it would undermine the Supreme Court's 
powers and the autonomy of the judiciary. 
  Sanchez de Lozada expressed his determination to propose the 
establishment of a Constitutional Court in the constitutional 
amendments, and cited several European and Latin American 
countries that have one. 
  The Bolivian Supreme Court has been virtually paralyzed 
since 
last year in view of impeachment proceedings undertaken against 
its president, Edgar Oblitas, who has been charged with 
extortion.
