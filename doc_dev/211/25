  [Excerpts] La Paz, 26 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Bolivian President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada swore in his new cabinet today, 
thereby ending the ministerial crisis plaguing the first eight 
months of his administration. This will allow Congress to 
approve several projects presented by the Executive Branch. 
  The president told the new members of his cabinet: "The 
stage 
for creativity has ended. Now another stage can begin; one of 
practical and specific actions." 
  Sanchez de Lozada made changes in his 10-member cabinet 
after 
five ministers resigned. He also created a minister at large, 
thereby putting an end to what he believes is the first stage of 
his administration, which was inaugurated on 6 August 1993. 
  The Bolivian leader affirmed that this change was necessary 
because it comes at a vital and significant time for the 
country. Sanchez de Lozada is trying to get Congress to approve 
several draft laws regarding capitalization, popular 
participation, and education reform. [passage omitted] 
  Leaders of the four political parties that comprise the 
ruling coalition were present at the ceremony. They said the 
new cabinet will carry out the changes and programs set forth 
over the past seven months. 
  Max Fernandez, a leader of the Solidarity Civic Unity, who 
is said to be responsible for the cabinet crisis, said, "the 
time has come for the president to receive the conditional 
support of the ruling coalition to demonstrate that changes have 
finally come for the Bolivian people." Fernandez demanded a 
greater say within the Executive Branch in exchange for votes to 
approve the laws Sanchez de Lozada has presented to Congress.
