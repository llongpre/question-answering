  [Text] La Paz, 9 Jun (EFE) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada today announced that Marcelo Cespedes 
Gutierrez has been appointed the new labor minister. Gutierrez 
replaces Reynaldo Peters, who resigned today. 
  Peters' sudden resignation can be added to those of Luis 
Lema, Bolivian ambassador to Argentina; and Jorge Otasevich, the 
congressional and political affairs under secretary, both of 
whom resigned today. 
  Ernesto Machicao, minister of social communications, 
explained that the resigning government officials will replace 
those senators who have been objected to in the ongoing 
impeachment process against the suspended president and senior 
justice of the Supreme Court. 
  The impeachment process against Supreme Court President 
Edgar 
Oblitas and Senior Justice Ernesto Poppe is in its final stages 
after an anguishing process in the Chamber of Deputies and the 
Senate. This is the first effort made to establish a precedent 
in the battle against corruption undertaken by the Sanchez de 
Lozada administration. 
  The defense objected to several of the senators from the 
ruling Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR). In view of 
this there was a risk that the two-thirds of the votes necessary 
to approve the impeachment would not be achieved. 
  With the votes of Peters, Lema, and Otasevich, the MNR will 
be able to secure the majority of votes necessary to approve the 
impeachment process.
