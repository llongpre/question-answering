  [Text] La Paz, 12 May (EFE) -- The government coalition in 
Bolivia is facing the immediate threat of losing one of its 
allies and being left without an absolute majority in Congress. 
  Max Fernandez, leader of the populist Solidarity Civic Union 
(UCS), whose deputies guarantee the government's absolute 
majority in Congress, harshly criticized President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada after threatening to withdraw his support. 
  So far the special session of Congress called for 9 May by 
Sanchez de Lozada has not been held, because the UCS, in a 
demonstration of force, has joined the opposition in boycotting 
the president's call. 
  Sanchez de Lozada "is worse than a dictator" said Max 
Fernandez, according to his remarks published by LA RAZON today. 
  The president "has no reason to tweak my ears, because I am 
not anybody's boy. I am a businessman and a person who deserves 
respect," said Fernandez, who is the majority owner of the 
National Brewery, one of the largest companies in the country. 
  Max Fernandez announced he will meet with Sanchez de Lozada 
in the next few days, assuring that "by God, it will be the last 
and definitive meeting between the president and myself." 
  Sanchez de Lozada, heading the Nationalist Revolutionary 
Movement (MNR), won by a simple majority the 6 June 1993 
elections. 
  Thanks to a pact with the UCS, Sanchez de Lozada was elected 
president by Congress and was able to form a government 
coalition supported by an absolute congressional majority. 
  On several occasions Max Fernandez has expressed his 
dissatisfaction with his party's share of power in the 
government, and criticized the president for not consulting with 
him on important decisions before implementing them. 
  As a result of the government pact signed with the MNR, the 
UCS heads the Defense Ministry, some secretariats, and embassies. 
  The other MNR ally is the social democratic Free Bolivia 
Movement (MBL), whose seven deputies do not guarantee the 
government's absolute majority. The MBL runs the Foreign 
Ministry through its president [Antonio Aranibar] who is the 
cabinet chief and foreign minister. 
  The MNR has 52 of the 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 
and depends on the 20 seats of the UCS to have an absolute 
majority.
