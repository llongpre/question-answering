  [Text] Lima, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori today said that during the Ibero-American summit in 
Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, Latin America left rhetoric 
behind and took concrete steps toward integration. 
  When speaking of the results of the summit, Fujimori said 
that "the most important thing is that concrete measures were 
adopted and this represents considerable progress toward 
regional integration." 
  "This time the rhetoric was left aside and it was obvious 
that each country was making an effort to form a Latin American 
trade bloc to counterbalance the other blocs that exist in the 
world," Fujimori said. 
  The Peruvian president said that the economic section of the 
final document issued in Cartagena contains several proposals 
"which were planned based on the experience and modernization 
process of the Peruvian economy." 
  As for the political content of the declaration of the 
Ibero-American chiefs of state and governments, Fujimori said 
that the document "insists on the need for the democratic system 
to work efficiently." 
  He also mentioned that "it has been agreed that it is 
necessary to combat all kinds of corruption which, just like 
terrorism, is one of the scourges that hinders development and 
the efficiency of democracy." 
  Fujimori expressed satisfaction over the result of his 
meetings in Cartagena with Ecuadoran President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  He and Duran-Ballen discussed several plans that would 
integrate the two countries, such as highways and agricultural 
projects, while he and Sanchez de Lozada spoke about giving 
Bolivia an outlet to the sea through the southern Peruvian coast.
