  [Text] Colonia de Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (EFE) -- The 
presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay today 
agreed to integrate Bolivia as an observer country in all the 
meetings of the work subgroups of the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur). 
  The decision was made during the fifth Mercosur summit, 
which 
ended in the city of Colonia, after a formal petition made by 
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  Presidents Carlos Menem of Argentina, Itamar Franco of 
Brazil, Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay, and Luis Alberto 
Lacalle of Uruguay issued a public declaration expressing their 
satisfaction with the Bolivian Government's desire to extend and 
strengthen its ties with Mercosur. 
  The declaration states: "They thus considered it appropriate 
to respond to Bolivia's petition by inviting its representatives 
to participate, as observers, in the meetings of the work 
subgroups." 
  The presidents also state that "within the framework of 
Bolivia's petition, agreements with Bolivia will be prioritized 
with the perspective of its future total participation in 
Mercosur." 
  President Sanchez de Losada attended the summit as an 
observer and in his speech he stressed his country's interest in 
Mercosur without forgetting other integration agreements Bolivia 
has signed. 
  Technically, Bolivia cannot join Mercosur because it already 
belongs to the Andean Pact, but it can associate with it through 
a free market system. 
  The Bolivian president said before his colleagues that "we 
must recognize that we have failed" in Latin American 
integration "given the lack of political will to eliminate 
borders that are presently more in the minds of our countries' 
leaders than in geography." 
  Sanchez de Losada added: "Our peoples have always considered 
themselves brothers and sisters within a great Latin American 
family. In this process of attaining an ideal, we have fallen 
and risen many times, but we are learning." 
  "With past experience and the demands of our current times, 
we Latin Americans are taking more seriously the challenge of 
integration, and Mercosur is proof of this," he added. 
  "We Bolivians are convinced that efforts like Mercosur, the 
Andean Pact, and the Group of Three have the common objective of 
making progress toward a greater and broader integration," he 
stated. 
  Sanchez de Losada concluded by saying: "Bolivia plays a role 
in this process by being a point in common and a contact among 
regional groups. We are willing to play the role that 
corresponds to us given our continental vocation, our deep 
integrationist will, and our presence in the River Plate, 
Andean, Amazon, Pacific, and Atlantic areas."
