  [Excerpts] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada arrived this 
morning at 0615 at the El Alto international airport. During 
his 11-day trip the Bolivian president visited Cartagena, 
Colombia, where he attended the Ibero-American summit; and the 
United States, where he attended the inauguration of the World 
Cup of soccer. 
  During a news conference after his arrival, the president 
discussed the Bolivian-German soccer match. [passage omitted] 
  The president also referred to the sea outlet issue, which 
was discussed both with Chilean President Eduardo Frei and at 
the foreign ministerial level. 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] We want to advance at all levels, 
at the cultural, political, and economic levels, so that we can 
succeed in our great objective of achieving an outlet to the 
sea, both through the waterway and to the Pacific Ocean. 
  I believe we had a good meeting, and that there is the 
willingness to continue negotiating. I also explained that we 
want to take specific steps to improve Bolivia's situation. 
[end recording] 
  Regarding capitalization, journalists asked him whether he 
had been able during this trip to obtain more investments. He 
said: 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] We witnessed real interest in this 
regard in the United States. For example, the Chicago Stock 
Exchange will be sending a delegation to Bolivia. They are 
interested in helping us establish a modern and fully 
computerized stock exchange in Bolivia. 
  I believe things are working out, step by step, in a 
positive 
manner, and that there is good acceptance. Obviously this 
entails a lot of work, but I am optimistic. I believe we are 
obtaining positive results. [end recording] 
  President Sanchez de Lozada said that his administration 
will 
consist of several stages. He said the first stage is that of 
sowing, which is the current stage. 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] This stage consists of preparing 
the soil, of sowing. It is a very austere stage, and people do 
not always see results. Nevertheless it is a necessary stage, 
as there is no harvest without a season of sowing. 
  We are very confident that during the second year of this 
administration we will be able to implement the capitalization 
program. In other words, we estimate that by 6 August 1995 we 
will have completed the capitalization process, and that the 
pension funds will be operating by the end of next year. [end 
recording] 
  The president said that the harvest will be taken in during 
the third year. He said that the last year of his 
administration would be unquestionably a political year. 
  Regarding the latest poll conducted by the Catholic 
University of Bolivia, which indicates that Bolivian public 
opinion believes a president should not also hold the post of 
MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] leader, the president 
said: 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] We have a government system that 
is similar to that of a parliamentary system of government. 
Therefore, if a candidate lacks two-thirds, he has to go to 
Congress and establish a coalition. This is why I am the leader 
of a political coalition. 
  This situation is not at all strange for Spain's Felipe 
Gonzalez, or for German Chancellor Kohl, because if they intend 
to implement their government programs they must be their 
party's leaders and establish coalitions in order to be able to 
govern. [passage omitted] [end recording] [passage omitted]
