  [Text] Lima, 26 May (EFE) -- Today, the presidents of 
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela reasserted their 
commitment to the integration process of the Andean Group (GRAN) 
or Cartagena Agreement on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. 
  The five presidents expressed their support for the Andean 
integration process in separate communiques issued here today by 
the Cartagena Agreement Board (JUNAC), the GRAN's technical and 
executive body. 
  Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada stated the 
common problems affecting Andean countries are the basic factor 
in their unity. He added: "More than ever before, the 
challenges and hopes the Andean Group represents still prevail." 
  Sanchez de Lozada stated: "With our creativity and effort, 
we still must strive to achieve a better life for our countries." 
  His Colombian colleague, Cesar Gaviria, stated on the 
occasion of GRAN's 25th anniversary, "we have to rejoice over 
the implementation of this idea that has made a great 
contribution to the unity of our countries." He added: "Today, 
trade is the great force behind economic development, 
integration, and the well-being of nations." 
  Gaviria asserted that in these two and a half decades, GRAN 
faced difficulties "because the prevailing protectionist 
practices undermined commercial and integration processes." 
  He added: "Today we hope the Andean Group will develop. We 
also hope to establish a common export tariff, although we are 
aware this does not constitute a goal in itself but a means for 
achieving a free trade zone throughout the entire continent of 
the Americas." 
  Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen stressed the 
"integrating tradition" of GRAN members and reasserted his 
country's support for "the Andean integration process." 
  Duran-Ballen stated the Andean Group faces the immediate 
challenge of establishing an Andean free trade zone and helping 
Andean countries achieve "a level of modernization and 
proficiency that will allow them to achieve a definitive and 
advantageous presence in the international market." 
  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori stated that his country 
shares with other Andean countries "a profound integrationist 
spirit." Fujimori explained that Peru temporarily withdrew from 
GRAN's economic process from August 1992 to April 1994 because 
of the serious domestic crisis his country was experiencing. 
  He added that today, Peru has been able to achieve economic 
stability and has reassumed "with great enthusiasm, the noble 
task we assumed with our Andean brothers a quarter of a century 
ago." 
  After noting that businessmen were skeptical about the 
Andean 
Group's success when it was implemented, Rafael Caldera, the 
president of Venezuela, which joined the Andean Group 23 years 
ago, praised the fact that private business has become the most 
important integration force. 
  Caldera added: "The celebration of the anniversary of one of 
the most effective and auspicious Latin American integrationist 
movements constitutes an auspicious event not only for its 
members but for all developing countries."
