  [Text] President Fidel Castro broke away from the agenda of 
the summit today and addressed the Ibero-American Summit after 
the session for each of the participants to speak had ended. 
Castro warned democracy must be understood within the context 
of a great discussion among Latin Americans, and he demanded 
solidarity for the people of Cuba who are suffering due to the 
U.S. blockade, which he described as criminal. Castro requested 
the floor from Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who 
was presiding over this afternoon's session. Castro said: 
  [Begin Castro recording] In conclusion, I will say I respect 
your ideas. I sincerely respect your ideas, concepts, and 
thoughts about democracy. We would have to hold a summit to 
discuss what democracy is, what participation of the people is, 
and why millions die in this hemisphere each year from disease 
and hunger when they could be saved. [end recording] 
  Following Castro's speech, Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez 
de Lozada responded, saying even though there is still much to 
study and understand about the Cuban experience, he trusts that 
democracy will come to the island and that Castro will be at the 
head of a second Cuban revolution. 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] Possibly [words indistinct], but I 
know a change will occur, and we all wish you [words indistinct] 
respect that all this [words indistinct] big river, big ocean 
[word indistinct]. [end recording] 
  This was the second time Castro addressed the summit. His 
first speech was scheduled, the second was not. We asked 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo for his views 
regarding Castro's speech. Gaviria said: The speech Cuban 
President Fidel Castro made follows the pattern of words the 
Cuban Government uses at international meetings. They never 
sidetrack from this pattern. President Gaviria was also asked 
what he thought of the fact that Castro was wearing civilian 
clothes. Gaviria said: We were accustomed to seeing him in his 
olive green uniform, but we saw him wearing a guayabera today. 
It is an encouraging change, Gaviria said, adding there are 
also encouraging signs for Latin American democracy.
