  [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (AFP) -- On Thursday, President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada spoke of the danger of 
"narcoguerrilla" and powerful drug cartels like those of 
Colombia developing in Bolivia if a general drug enforcement 
policy is not quickly defined. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said this new policy, which he will 
present 
to Congress next August, must not be imposed from abroad. He 
spoke to a local newspaper, alluding to the problems created in 
Bolivia by U.S. pressure to radicalize drug enforcement and to 
eradicate coca plantations in El Chapare, the largest cocaine 
raw material producing zone in the world. The chief of state 
said: "Trafficking is a very serious problem for all sectors of 
society and it affects Bolivian relations with the rest of the 
world." 
  The president said he was worried about the lack of a 
consistent drug enforcement strategy. He stated that most of 
the coca produced in El Chapare -- approximately 60,000 tonnes 
per year -- ends up in drug production. 
  "Nobody chews coca in El Chapare; coca produced in Yungas 
region is taken to El Chapare, and it all goes to produce drugs. 
The atmosphere in the region favors the establishment of drug 
cartels or narcoguerrillas," Sanchez de Lozada said. 
  Regarding the policy being prepared by his administration, 
Sanchez de Lozada mentioned the creation of a National Drug 
Enforcement Council presided by Foreign Minister Antonio 
Aranibar and comprising Justice Minister Jorge Blattman, 
Sustainable Development Minister Guillermo Justiniano, and 
Minister of Government German Quiroga. 
  This council must find solutions in Bolivia and not 
solutions 
imposed from abroad, the president said, adding that this 
reorganization includes defining a policy toward the United 
States. "This is a far too important for them (the United 
States) because after many years they have recognized the need 
for shared responsibility. It is our obligation to generate a 
proposal that will really solve this problem," Sanchez de Lozada 
said.
