<F P=106> [Interview via satellite with Bolivian President Gonzalo </F>
Sanchez de Lozada in La Paz by reporter Jacobo Zabludovsky in 
Mexico City; from the "24 Hours" newscast--live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Zabludovsky] How has drug 
trafficking influenced or interfered in Bolivia's political life? 
  Sanchez: Drug trafficking is one of the most 
pressing problems confronting Bolivia. No one can explain why 
we do not have narcoguerrillas or cartels similar to the ones in 
Cali, for example. It is because social cohesion is very strong 
in Bolivia. Family and community ties are very strong; at any 
rate, the issue is one of concern, because we are a very fragile 
nation. Our institutions are very vulnerable, and we are 
apprehensive about this drug-trafficking issue. 
  We are struggling hard against drug trafficking and seeking 
strategies to convince the peasantry to become involved in other 
activities. It is not an easy task, because there is poverty, 
and one of the few things that produces revenue is the coca 
plant, especially when it is refined into drugs. Despite all 
this, we believe that if we can create enthusiasm for 
industrialization or an alternate economic activity, we will be 
able to find ways for the Bolivian people to abandon this 
activity. It is not an activity we are interested in promoting, 
given that it is so dangerous. 
  Undoubtedly, this is one of the greatest challenges 
confronting us, and we are all searching for solutions, not only 
the government but society as a whole, because it is undermining 
our youth. We are concerned that tomorrow it might undermine 
our stability as well as our social harmony. [passage omitted]
