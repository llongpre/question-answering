  [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (AFP) -- President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Losada spoke on Thursday [date not further specified] of the 
danger of a "narco-guerrilla" and powerful drug cartels like 
those of Colombia developing in Bolivia if a general drug 
enforcement policy is not quickly defined. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said that this new policy, which he will 
present to Congress next August, must not be imposed from 
abroad. He said this to a local newspaper, alluding to the 
problems created in Bolivia by U.S. pressure to radicalize drug 
enforcement and to eradicate coca plantations in El Chapare, the 
largest cocaine raw material producing zone in the world. 
  The chief of state said: "Trafficking is a very serious 
problem for all sectors of society and it affects Bolivian 
relations with the rest of the world." 
  The president said he was worried about the lack of a 
consistent drug enforcement strategy. He stated that most of 
the coca produced in El Chapare--approximately 60,000 tonnes per 
year--ends up in drug production. 
  "Nobody chews coca in El Chapare; coca produced in Yungas 
region is taken to El Chapare, and all goes to produce drugs. 
The atmosphere in the region favors the establishment of drug 
cartels or narco-guerrillas," Sanchez de Lozada said. 
  Regarding the policy being prepared by his administration, 
Sanchez de Lozada mentioned the creation of a National Drug 
Enforcement Council [Consejo Nacional de Lucha Contra el 
Narcotrafico] presided by Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and 
comprising Justice Minister Jorge Blattman, Sustainable 
Development Minister Guillermo Justiniano, and Minister of 
Government German Quiroga. 
  This council must find solutions in Bolivia and not 
solutions 
imposed from abroad, the president said, adding that this 
reorganization includes defining a policy toward the United 
States. 
  "This is far too important for them (the United States) 
because after many years they have recognized the need for 
shared responsibility. It is our obligation to generate a 
proposal that will really solve this problem," Sanchez de Lozada 
said.
