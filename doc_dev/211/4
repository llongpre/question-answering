  [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma this 
afternoon disclosed Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada's official response to the invitation conveyed to him by 
Chilean President Patricio Aylwin to attend the Chilean 
presidential inauguration. 
  Sanchez de Lozada says that it is not still advisable for a 
Bolivian president to attend an official ceremony. He added 
that his wife Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada will 
represent him. 
  Silva Cimma read to the press Sanchez de Lozada's reply: 
  [Begin Silva Cimma recording] He says that for reasons that 
are not beyond President Aylwin's illustrious acknowledgement, a 
visit by a Bolivian president to Chile to attend an official 
ceremony is not yet advisable. He has, however, empowered his 
wife, Mrs. Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada, to represent 
him as a proof of his consideration and personal esteem toward 
their excellencies President Aylwin and President Frei Ruiz 
Tagle. [end recording] 
  Sanchez de Lozada also conveyed thanks for the invitation 
conveyed to him by his Chilean counterpart Patricio Aylwin, and 
wished the best success to future President Eduardo Frei 
Ruiz-Tagle. 
  Silva Cimma said it is not suitable to speculate on this 
response which, according to him, does not affect bilateral 
relations. 
  [Begin Silva Cimma recording] I hope this letter will not 
lead to speculations, considering that the reply to the 
invitation was made in a very delicate way and in terms that I 
think are self- explanatory. Therefore, I am simply announcing 
the official report, and that is it. [end recording] 
  Diplomatic relations between Chile and Bolivia were 
disrupted 
after the Pacific War of the last century, when Bolivia lost its 
outlet to the Pacific Ocean.
