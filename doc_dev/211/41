  [Excerpts] Bolivia and Paraguay have signed a letter of 
intent that can open prospects for selling gas to that country. 
This important document was signed during the visit Paraguayan 
Foreign Minister Luis Ramirez Boettner is paying to Bolivia. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Bolivian foreign minister and his Paraguayan counterpart 
today signed a major document of understanding that determinedly 
supports the construction of a gas pipeline between Puerta 
Grande, Bolivia, and Asuncion, Paraguay, for supplying Bolivian 
natural and liquefied petroleum gas to that nation. 
  [Begin Ramirez Boettner recording] I believe the work we did 
yesterday afternoon and today to prepare for the visit Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will pay to Paraguay on 14 
and 15 March has been very fruitful. 
  Among the issues we addressed -- because we addressed 
several 
issues -- one of the more important is the one dealing with the 
energy problem, that is, the possible sale of Bolivian gas to 
Paraguay. [end recording]. 
  In addition to the Bolivian president's visit to Paraguay, 
other major issues were considered like economic 
supplementation; a tripartite agreement on the Pilcomayo River 
by Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia; the Paraguay-Parana 
waterway; and the Trans-Chaco Highway. 
  Concerning the sale of gas to Paraguay, the price and volume 
will be decided at a meeting of specialists from Bolivian 
Government Oil Deposits and a Paraguayan private enterprise. 
  The construction of the gas pipeline will be totally 
financed 
with private capital. [passage omitted]
