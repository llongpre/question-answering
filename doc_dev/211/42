  [Text] Cochabamba, 24 Feb -- President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada, commenting on the "rapprochement" with Chile, stated 
here today that "diplomatic relations are not resumed based on 
conditions; conditions are not established for this." 
  He added: "It is when one sees that the Chilean people, the 
Bolivian people, have experienced a true change in mentality 
that there is true acceptance, that there is hope for 
negotiations. Many people in Bolivia maintain that we must not 
resume relations until we establish conditions, but this leads 
nowhere. What one has to see is the moment in which the Chilean 
people, the Bolivian people, are willing to start true talks, 
negotiations, and thus work toward a first meeting." 
  Sanchez de Lozada said that "things are changing rapidly," 
as 
are the countries, and therefore this is "a subject that 
requires, as I have stated before, audacity and prudence." 
  The chief of state insisted that the subject must be handled 
"seriously" because "domestic policy is one thing, and 
international policy another." "There was a feeling that if I 
attended this presidential inauguration [Chilean President-elect 
Eduardo Frei's inauguration on 11 March] it would be a sort of 
acknowledgement, a tacit resumption of diplomatic relations. I 
think there are chances that this will happen at some point, but 
I still do not have a deadline nor a date set for restoring 
relations. We will see what happens with time, but we thought 
this was not the appropriate moment. But neither was it a 
matter of turning the invitation down, so we thought the best 
solution would be to send someone close to me who at the same 
time did not belong to the government, and I think we have come 
up with an imaginative solution." 
  However, consulted about the significance to Bolivia of the 
landlocked subject, he said: "Well, the sea problem has existed 
for more than 100 years, and we are not going to solve it with 
my wife's visit, but it represents a rapprochement. It is very 
hard to hold a dialogue with someone with whom you have no 
relations. You must talk to reach an understanding. We believe 
this was the adequate solution, and a step forward." 
  Sanchez de Lozada referred to the invitation extended to him 
by Chilean President Patricio Aylwin, which he termed 
"important." The president ended by stating: "This is how one 
starts a rapprochement, trying to find the right moment for this 
rapprochement process so it can result in something concrete and 
to the benefit of the Bolivian people."
