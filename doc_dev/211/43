   Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of the
governing party and Hugo Banzer, a former military dictator,
claimed victory Monday in a close presidential race, and Congress
will choose the winner.
   Officials said the outcome of Sunday's presidential and
congressional elections were an endorsement of the government's
economic austerity program, which both Banzer and Sanchez de Lozada
supported.
   Since none of the nine presidential candidates got a majority,
the new Congress will convene Aug. 4 to elect Bolivia's 77th
president, who will inaugurated two days later for a four-year term.
   ``The tendencies are clear,'' Sanchez de Lozada told a news
conference Monday. ``I will be the next president of Bolivia, and
my primary goals will be social programs and economic stability.''
   Jaime Cespedes, a spokesman for Banzer, claimed victory for his
party and said: ``We will not accept the victory of Sanchez de
Lozada because the only victory acceptable is that of the electoral
court. There is evidence to indicate fraud and the annulment of
votes favorable to Banzer.''
   Foreign observers who visited voting places throughout the
country reported some problems that appeared to stem from the
ignorance of rural electoral officials, but said they found no
evidence of widespread fraud.
   U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard told journalists his office
monitored the vote in eight cities and found only minor
irregularities. He called it ``one of the most impressive Latin
American elections in contemporary times.''
   The electoral college is to present its final tally May 28.
   Bolivia's constitution requires Congress to choose the president
when no candidate gets a majority. The 27 seats in the Senate and
130 in the House of Deputies will be divided among the parties
according to the number of votes they received in each electoral
region.
   A projection by the private Bolivian Television Association said
Sanchez de Lozada's government party would gain four Senate seats
to 13 and Banzer's party would lose four, leaving it with five
members.
   It said Sanchez de Lozada would have 38 seats in the new Chamber
of Deputies, maintaining the current two-seat advantage over the 36
of Banzer's party.
   Eight other parties would share the rest of the seats.
   According to the Television Association's tally of 1,059,305
votes, an estimated 60 percent of those cast, Banzer and his
center-right Nationalist Democratic Action led with 284,028 votes,
or 26.8 percent, and Sanchez de Lozada of the conservative
Revolutionary Nationalist Movement was a close second with 279,385,
or 26.4 percent.
   Jaime Paz Zamora of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left was
third with 233,568 votes, or 22.1 percent, it said.
   The projection said Sanchez de Lozada probably would pull ahead
of Banzer by one or two percentage points when the vote came in
from rural areas, where early returns showed him with a solid lead.
That would put Sanchez de Lozada, 58, in a good position to win
congressional approval.
   Banzer, 62, seized power in 1971 and was forced out in 1978. He
said before the elections that all candidates should support the
one who won the most votes.
   Information Minister Herman Antelo told The Associated Press on
Monday: ``In the name of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, I would
like to express satisfaction for the form and results of the
election. Independently of who is the winner, more than two thirds
of the population has given its endorsement to the government's
economic policy and the need to continue with it.''
   The 81-year-old incumbent is retiring after a career that
spanned half a century and included three periods as president.
   Sanchez de Lozada, a wealthy mine owner, was educated in the
United States and has a philosophy degree from the University of
Chicago.
   Voting was calm and orderly in what once was the continent's
most politically volatile country. Since the turn of the century
there have been 13 coups, with nine governments between 1978 and
1982.
   Some irregularities were reported, including the arrest of three
people who carried several different identity cards and apparently
planned to vote several times. There also were reports that some
voters were given already marked ballots, but foreign observers
said they had no initial indications of widespread fraud.
   Paz Estenssoro said upon casting his ballot that the elections
would help lead Bolivians to political maturity. ``The important
thing is to consolidate democracy,'' he said.
   He launched a severe economic program when he took office in
1985 to halt economic chaos, including an annual inflation rate of
23,000 percent.
   Banzer, Sanchez de Lozada and Paz Zamora pledged to maintain the
program, which has cut inflation to 15 percent a year and
contributed to some small economic growth for the first time in a
decade.
   In addition, they all vowed to continue the government's battle
against cocaine production and trafficking. The United States
provides about $55 million a year for the efforts, which include
programs to reduce coca leaf cultivation in Bolivia's jungles.
