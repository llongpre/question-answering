  [Text] The presidents of Chile and Bolivia have been 
invited to the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
presidential meeting on 17 January. The Argentine delegation 
made the proposal. [Chilean] President-elect Eduardo Frei is 
also invited. 
  Patricio Aylwin, Sanchez de Lozada, and Eduardo Frei will 
hold complementary meetings with their Mercosur counterparts but 
they will not formally participate in the deliberations. 
  It is being reported in Santiago, Chile, that President 
Patricio Aylwin is studying the possibility of attending the 
summit, which will be held in Colonia on 17 January. The 
presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay -- the 
Mercosur member countries -- invited Aylwin and also his elected 
successor, Eduardo Frei, to participate. 
  Frei is unable to attend; he is resting following a inguinal 
hernia operation today. Chilean Foreign Ministry economic 
delegation sources told the afternoon newspaper LA SEGUNDA that 
Chile should send a high-ranking representation to the meeting, 
even though it is not a Mercosur member and clearly cannot 
become one.
