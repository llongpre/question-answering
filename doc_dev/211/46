  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy will not be in 
Asuncion tomorrow, during the great march against the farm 
sector policy, which is being sponsored by peasant organizations. 
  Wasmosy, accompanied by Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez 
de 
Lozada, will visit the Itaipu hydroelectric dam at 0700 and 
visit Brazilian towns until the afternoon. 
  Peasant organization leaders say Wasmosy's attitude shows he 
has no vision of the real magnitude of the current conflict and 
that he lacks the political will to give structural solutions to 
the problem of land and the sale of cotton. 
  After visiting Itaipu, Sanchez de Lozada and Wasmosy will 
lunch in Foz de Iguazu and then visit the Brazilian city of Sao 
Paulo to dedicate a sluice in a hydroelectric power plant in 
Tiete River. For this reason he will not see the peasant protest.

  Chamber of Deputies President Francisco Jose de Vargas has 
said he is aware that some people have been hired to cause 
disturbances outside Congress during the peasant march.
