  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada used the 
expression "one can drink milk without owning a cow" in his 
proposal for an outlet to the Pacific Ocean without the need for 
Bolivia to recover ownership of the territory it lost to Chile. 
Opposition congressmen yesterday reported that Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar will be summoned to Congress to explain, in a 
secret session, the content and scope of the president's 
proposal. 
  Sanchez de Lozada's proposal in Colombia has prompted 
different reactions within the Bolivian opposition; while some 
congressmen said he is giving up a century old national desire 
for a "sovereign outlet to the sea," others called the proposal 
an "interesting initiative." 
  The most adamant opponents of that proposal are Nationalist 
Democratic Action leader Jorge Landivar and Democratic Socialism 
Alternative Deputy Jerjes Justiniano. 
  Landivar said Sanchez de Lozada has been hasty in his 
attempt 
to solve the maritime issue, adding that the president's 
proposal is some sort of a "tenancy agreement" because although 
Bolivia will have an outlet to the sea, it will be through a 
foreign territory. 
  Justiniano said that we cannot give up a sovereign corridor 
to the sea because this is the right of all Bolivians and 
because it implies "treason to the fatherland."
