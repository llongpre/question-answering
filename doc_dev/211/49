  [Text] Santiago, 10 Jun (EFE) -- Open regionalism, growth 
with social equity, and the strengthening of democracy are the 
main proposals Chilean President Eduardo Frei will present to 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Chiefs of State and 
Governments to be held on 14 and 15 June in Cartagena de Indias 
(Colombia). 
  This announcement was made by Foreign Relations Under 
Secretary Jose Miguel Insulza, who said Frei will leave for 
Cartagena on 13 June with a small delegation aboard a commercial 
flight. 
  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa will leave for 
Cartagena on 11 June to attend the preparatory meetings at the 
foreign minister level to decide on the proposals to be debated 
by the chiefs of state and governments. 
  Figueroa also confirmed that President Frei will meet with 
Spanish King Juan Carlos. He will probably meet with Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, and Cuban President Fidel 
Castro. These meetings will depend on Frei's agenda. 
  Insulza confirmed that the Chilean Government has approved 
the agenda of the summit which will center mainly on economic 
issues. He added that Frei will promote open regionalism, a 
policy which Chile has successfully developed at the trade level 
through bilateral and multilateral agreements. 
  He said the Chilean Government wants a regional debate on 
growth with equity because it considers overcoming poverty to be 
the most important challenge for the countries of the region. 
  Regarding democracy, Inzulza said Chile advocates a stronger 
and better democracy in Ibero-America, efficient governments, 
honest administrations, and modernization of the state. 
  Inzulza added that Frei's proposals to the summit are 
closely 
linked to the general guidelines of his administration. 
  Frei was inaugurated last March after winning the December 
1993 elections with 58 percent of the vote. He chose as his 
government priority the fight against poverty through growth 
with equity. 
  To do this he created a national commission to fight 
poverty, 
which affects 4 million Chileans; some 1.2 million live in 
extreme poverty.
