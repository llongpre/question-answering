  [Excerpts] The Chilean Government has indicated that it is 
fully prepared to begin a "new era" of relations with Bolivia by 
evaluating positively Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada's most recent remarks about not tying any future step 
toward the resumption of diplomatic relations to the beginning 
of talks on Bolivia's lack of a sea outlet. 
  It has been explained, however, that the positive reaction 
of 
the Chilean Government does not imply that diplomatic relations 
will be resumed immediately. 
  Chilean politicians stated that Sanchez de Lozada's 
statement 
was "very positive" and praised the president's modern and 
daring approach. 
  Both government and political circles, however, agree that 
the remarks of the Bolivian president should be taken prudently 
bearing in mind that there are people in Bolivia whose position 
toward Chile and what they call "Bolivia's landlocked situation" 
is very hard and inflexible. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Relations Under Secretary Rodrigo Diaz Albonico 
said: 
"We were very happy to hear what Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada had to say." 
  Jorge Pizarro, speaker for the foreign relations committee 
of 
the Chamber of Deputies, believes that Sanchez de Lozada's 
remarks "are extraordinarily positive and reflect that the 
Bolivian president has a modern and daring approach to what 
relations between the states should be as far as the process of 
integration is concerned, in order to further the social and 
economic development of our peoples." 
  Experts in Bolivian-Chilean relations believe that rather 
than a change in Bolivia's foreign policy, there is a new and 
promising approach, confirmed by the fact the Sanchez de Lozada 
attended the Rio Group presidential summit in Santiago last year. 
  "After what Sanchez de Lozada said, it is assumed that this 
so-called `new approach' will lead Bolivia to begin talks aimed 
at reestablishing diplomatic relations in the not too distant 
future," the experts said. 
  Despite the remarks of the Bolivian president, the sources 
are not sure whether Bolivia's strategy is to resume relations 
and immediately tackle the sea outlet issue or to deal with both 
issues simultaneously. 
  Chile does not acknowledge any pending issues between the 
two 
countries on the grounds that there are treaties in effect, 
especially the 1904 treaty, which establish the current border 
between the two countries. Thus, Chile did not accept any 
conditions when the resumption of ties was proposed in the past. 
  The Foreign Ministry under secretary pointed out that the 
Bolivian president used the expression "new era" which is the 
same one Diaz Albonico used when he went to La Paz last year. 
The under secretary said that this was highly significant. 
  As to Bolivia's new willingness to approach the resumption 
of 
diplomatic ties without first tackling its so-called "landlocked 
situation," Albonico said that Sanchez de Lozada's words should 
be studied carefully. 
  He added, however, that the remarks of the Bolivian 
president 
augur a change in the political relations between the two 
countries, that may free them from past problems.
