  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 13 Jun (EFE) -- On 13 June, 
Chilean President Eduardo Frei said he had come to the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit to "reassert Chile's Latin American 
spirit," a basic issue in its foreign policy. 
  Frei recalled that during his presidential electoral 
campaign, he stated that Latin America would be the main issue 
in his foreign policy with prospects for political and economic 
integration. He added that he has continued to uphold and put 
this into practice since he came to power on 11 March. 
  Frei told EFE: "It is true that Chile is a country open to 
the world, that it is going to join the South Pacific Economic 
Cooperation Conference (APEC), and that the EU is our main 
commercial partner, but, regardless of this, Chile has a Latin 
American spirit and we have come to reassert this." 
  Frei added that sound evidence of this are the recent 
proposals for a partnership with the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur) and the proposals Chile made during the recent OAS 
General Assembly in Brazil. 
  Upon joining the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which will 
last two days in Cartagena de Indias, he said Chile will 
participate with the hope -- "and will make every effort 
possible in this direction" -- that it will mark the starting 
point, "in practice rather than in theory," of a real 
integration of the hemisphere. 
  The summit "must be the forum that will ensure Latin 
America's transformation into a true community of nations in 
which support for democracy, human rights, the struggle to 
overcome poverty, and economic integration prevail." 
  In Frei's opinion, the main thing to attaining these goals 
is 
commercial opening through negotiated agreements "with a spirit 
of open regionalism" that will cast aside protectionism and 
grant the continent access to the major markets, "free of 
exclusions and closed blocs." 
  The Chilean chief of state stressed: "This is what we have 
come to propose at this Fourth Ibero-American Summit, and we 
will do so with determination and an American spirit." 
  Upon his arrival in Cartagena de Indias, Frei offered 
Chile's 
cooperation in rebuilding the towns of Caucas and Huilas, which 
were devastated last week by the landslide caused by a tremor. 
Frei reconfirmed this offer to EFE. 
  Chile has already shipped 200 metric tons of aid for the 
tragedy's victims, but Frei said: "We have talked to the 
Colombian authorities about cooperating in the most difficult 
aspects, that is, to rebuild the towns." Frei added: 
"Unfortunately, Chile has great experience in natural disasters 
and will place this experience at the service of our Colombian 
brothers." 
  Shortly after his arrival, the Chilean president held a 
bilateral meeting with King Juan Carlos of Spain, whom he 
invited to visit Chile again, specifically the Antarctic, which 
is one of the king's "great desires." 
  The respective foreign ministries will immediately start 
working on the initiative to set a date, according to Frei, who 
said he had asked for an audience with the king "for the 
affection and support he always has granted Chile." 
  Eduardo Frei is scheduled to hold two more bilateral 
meetings 
in Cartagena de Indias: one with Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada on 15 June and one with Cuban President Fidel 
Castro on 16 June. 
  Frei said the two meetings will have an open agenda to 
assess 
the state of bilateral relations and cooperation prospects, but 
dismissed the possibilities that an agreement to resume 
diplomatic relations will be reached during either of the two 
meetings.
