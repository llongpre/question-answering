  [Text] Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (EFE) -- The 
presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay today 
ratified that Mercosur [Common Market of the South] will go into 
operation on 1 January 1995. They also confirmed the new work 
program to overcome the problem related to the common external 
tariff which is preventing the creation of a customs union. 
  The presidents were not able to fulfill the objective of 
announcing an agreement on the external tariff which is the 
basis for the customs union before Mercosur goes into operation. 
This was the intention of the fifth Mercosur summit after the 
emergence of a number of problems related to percentages 
accepted by each country for the protection of heavy industry, 
electronics, informatics, and petrochemistry. 
  Brazil, which is the main Mercosur partner, wants tariffs of 
up to 35 percent on those items while Argentina accepts up to 12 
percent or a maximum of 14 percent on the exports of third 
countries. 
  Paraguay and Uruguay, the two smaller partners, are in favor 
of a minimum tariff to prevent being subject to Brazilian 
technology and to the lack of efficiency of those industrial 
sectors. 
  President Carlos Menem of Argentina, Itamar Franco of 
Brazil, 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay, and Luis Alberto Lacalle of 
Uruguay agreed today, upon opening the fifth summit, on the 
difficulties facing Mercosur in this decisive stage of its 
operation. 
  At the same time Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada, who attended the meeting as an observer, warned in his 
speech that the lack of political will has been the main cause 
of Latin American failure in the search for economic integration. 
  All the presidents who carried out intensive direct 
diplomatic activity to overcome the obstacles asserted their 
desire to continue despite the obstacles. 
  Paraguayan President Wasmosy was the one who clearly defined 
the current situation by indirectly criticizing those like 
Brazil which seek to maintain their traditional protectionism. 
  Wasmosy said that Mercosur will only represent "the opening 
of a market comparable to other world regions if there is a 
modern framework based on free trade and competition, and where 
traditional protectionism must adjust to the new scenario." 
  He also said that Mercosur must be "a system for new 
investments and technology, even the `advanced' ones, as well as 
real full employment." 
  On the other side, Brazilian President Franco, who admitted 
the future difficulties, expressed satisfaction with the 
progress of Mercosur, and with the growth of the economies of 
the four countries. 
  He supports the extension of the free trade agreements to 
Chile and the signing of other subregional agreements. He added, 
however, that the complete opening of the Brazilian markets will 
have "benefits proportional to the size of the openings in each 
of the other member countries." 
  In order to overcome the obstacles and interpretations, the 
presidents decided to approve a new program to define the 
external tariff. That program must conclude before the sixth 
summit scheduled for next July, six months before the date 
established by the Asuncion Treaty of 26 March 1991 to put 
Mercosur into operation. 
  That work program establishes concrete dates to define each 
item of the tariff and to move toward a common percentage for 
imports from third countries. 
  The experts believe that the less complex negotiations will 
conclude before May and that by July there will be a clear 
picture on the four most controversial items which Brazil hopes 
to protect from the imports from third countries: informatics, 
petrochemistry, capital goods, and electronics. 
  A timetable for reducing tariffs has been established, 
therefore, it is expected that by the year 2000 there can be a 
tariff of 12 percent for capital goods. 
  Regarding informatics and electronics, for which Argentina 
wants a tariff of 4 percent and Brazil 35 percent, the lowest 
possible tariff will be established by the year 2006 as a way to 
favor industrial reconversion.
