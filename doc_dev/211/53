  [Excerpt] After President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada 
received an invitation from Chilean President-elect Eduardo Frei 
to attend his presidential inauguration in March, the opposition 
and government coalition on 9 February agreed that it is not 
correct for Sanchez de Losada to accept the invitation because 
the two countries do not maintain diplomatic relations, although 
the government coalition congressmen were more cautious in their 
comments. 
  Beyond the difference of approach toward the maritime 
vindication subject, the chiefs of Condepa [Conscience of the 
Fatherland], Carlos Palenque; the ADN [Nationalist Democratic 
Action], Jorge Landivar; and MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary 
Left], Hugo Carvajal, maintained that Chile has caused Bolivia's 
isolation from the sea and has historically denied it any 
possibility to a sovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean. 
  According to Foreign Ministry sources consulted by an 
international news agency, Sanchez de Losada is studying the 
possibility of attending the presidential inauguration in Chile 
on 11 March. On that day, Chilean President Patricio Aylwin will 
pass the presidency to Eduardo Frei, who won the last general 
elections. 
  LA RAZON learned last night that the national government has 
practically rejected the possibility that President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Losada will attend the ceremony, although the reason 
for not doing so was not explained. [passage omitted]
