  [Text] Colonia, 17 Jan (EFE) -- A series of differences 
were revealed on 17 January in the first results of a meeting 
the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, and 
Uruguay held to give political support to the Parana and 
Paraguay Rivers "waterway." 
  Carlos Menem, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, Itamar Franco, Luis 
Alberto Lacalle -- the presidents of Argentina, Paraguay, 
Brazil, and Uruguay -- are in Colonia, 180 km from Montevideo, 
attending the fifth Common Market of the South [Mercosur] 
summit, whose agenda centers around resolution of discrepancies 
for implementation of a common market. 
  Bolivia, which is not a Mercosur member, is being 
represented 
by its president, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who is attending as 
an observer. This country has been considered part of the River 
Plate Basin in the "waterway" project, which will give Bolivia 
its longed- for access to the sea. 
  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu told journalists 
that 
"the waterway will be included as a topic in the final 
declaration" of the fifth summit, which will end this evening, 
but did not report on the project's difficulties. 
  The common channels that Argentina and Uruguay -- the two 
River Plate coastal nations -- have under the terms of the River 
Plate Treaty have been used so far to reach the sea from the 
Paraguay and Parana Rivers. 
  But an Argentine initiative to build a private channel 
within 
its territorial waters through a public works concession to a 
private party, a project that will be financed through tolls, 
has created displeasure among the system's partners. 
  Uruguay has conveyed to Argentina its concern over the Mitre 
channel, which is the name of the Menem government's 
privatization project. 
  This channel will join the Argentine port of Rosario on the 
Parana River with the Atlantic Ocean. This will eliminate the 
Uruguayan port of Nueva Palmira as the river's final port, where 
Paraguay and Bolivia have been allowed to operate duty-free 
warehouses. 
  Uruguay also is concerned that the deepening of the new 
channel in Argentine territory will displace the channel the two 
countries share in Martin Garcia. 
  River navigation experts also have voiced their concern 
about 
the Mitre channel, which could force Uruguayan ships to pay 
tolls to the enterprises awarded the construction of Argentine 
public works, even for navigation to Uruguayan ports on the 
Uruguay River.
