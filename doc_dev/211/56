MR Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, a US-raised mine company owner, looks set to
be the new president of Bolivia, after the most peaceful elections in the
country's history, held on Sunday.
Unofficial results gave him a clear lead of almost 14 percentage points. His
Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) won 35 per cent of the vote,
against 21.1 per cent for the ruling Patriotic Accord (AP) led by a former
military dictator, ex-General Hugo Banzer.
Claiming victory yesterday, Mr Sanchez said: 'The people have voted for
change.'
However, the final outcome will emerge from a secret vote by Congress on
August 6. Projections of the results of the congressional elections, also
held on Sunday but not to be confirmed for 20 days, gave Mr Sanchez's party
69 of the 79 seats required for a majority. He will need a deal with one of
the 12 smaller parties.
Despite administrative problems, which have delayed voting in some areas
until next Sunday, the election proceeded smoothly under the supervision of
a new and independent electoral court.
The results confounded pollsters, all of whom had predicted a very close
contest. Mr Jose Gramunt, head of FIDES, the Bolivian news service,
described it as 'the best possible outcome'. He attributed the success of Mr
Sanchez to disillusion with the government, as well as to his choice of Mr
Vctor Hugo Cardenas, an indigenous politician, as his vice-presidential
running-mate. This made a contrast with the European-descended minority,
which provides most of Bolivia's politicians, and attracted many rural
voters.
Mr Sanchez is well-respected abroad as the author of a stabilisation plan in
1985 which reduced inflation from more than 24,000 per cent a year to 15 per
cent.
Bolivia now has one of the lowest inflation rates in South America, at 9 per
cent, but is also the continent's poorest country and has considerable
fiscal and balance-of-payment problems.
Mr Sanchez being pledged to continue the country's free market policies and
austerity programme, his victory was welcomed by the business community.
