  [Text] A meeting with Spanish King Juan Carlos was the 
first official activity that President Frei carried out in 
Cartagena, Colombia. Commenting on this meeting, Frei said that 
he discussed the current situation in Chile and his 
administrations' projects. 
  In addition, Frei reported that King Juan Carlos had 
expressed interest in paying another visit to Chile, and that 
some dates were already under discussion. 
  Asked about Chilean support for Cuba's return to the OAS, 
Frei said that this all depends on Cuba, which must restore 
democracy and uphold human rights. Cuba ceased being an OAS 
member in 1962. 
  Regarding his scheduled meeting with Bolivian President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, Frei said that Chile is interested in 
helping Bolivia obtain an outlet to the world.
