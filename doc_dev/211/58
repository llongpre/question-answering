  [Text] La Paz, 14 Apr (EFE) -- Most of the Bolivian 
citizens who listened to former President Jaime Paz Zamora's 
voluntary testimony felt discouragement and uncertainty because 
he did not dissipate doubts regarding alleged links between 
politics and drug trafficking. 
  The public interpellation session of former President Paz 
Zamora by the Chamber of Deputies Constitution Committee 
maintained a very high audience during the six hours it lasted, 
comparable only to the rating obtained by broadcasts of the 
soccer matches played by the Bolivian team to qualify for the 
1994 Soccer World Cup. 
  Paz Zamora left a feeling of uncertainty among citizens when 
he emphatically denied any link by his family, party, or himself 
to drug trafficking, and at the same time admitted his personal 
friendship with drug trafficker Isaac ``Oso'' Chavarria. 
  The people's discouragement became worse when the high 
degree 
of dependency the country has on the United States was reflected 
in the statements made by former President Paz Zamora to 
Congress. His words ratified similar statements by current 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  Last weekend Sanchez de Lozada revealed something the 
Bolivian people suspected but did not openly admit: ``We have a 
terrible dependency on the IMF, the U.S. Embassy, and the World 
Bank, who tell us what to do.'' 
  Paz Zamora warned that the U.S. cooperation in the struggle 
against drug trafficking may turn into interference. He added 
that no one had informed him that his ``good friend Chavarria'' 
was an alleged drug trafficker and that he, as president, was 
informed about antinarcotics operations. 
  ``Everyone obeys who pays him,'' Paz Zamora said, adding 
that 
the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) is not only advised but 
paid as well by the U.S. DEA. 
  The former president's statements seemed to be aimed at 
rekindling the traditional anti-U.S. feelings of the Bolivian 
people. He also roused a feeling of solidarity with his cause 
when he stated that he had ``pinned the national banner on his 
chest'' to implement ``coca diplomacy,'' which hurt the feelings 
of the U.S. Government. 
  Paz Zamora and George Bush in 1990 signed a drug enforcement 
agreement that is still in force that regulates financial and 
technical cooperation, the DEA's advising of FELCN, and the 
substitution of coca crops. 
  Coca leaves, which are the raw material for cocaine, have 
become a point of friction between Bolivia and the United 
States. This Andean nation recognizes the need to eradicate 
cocaine but also faces a serious social and economic problem 
with the destruction of coca crops, which produce a living for 
about 300,000 peasants.
