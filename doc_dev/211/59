  [Text] La Paz, 11 Jun (EFE) -- The Bolivian Senate today 
found Supreme Court Chief Justice Edgar Oblitas and Supreme 
Court Dean Ernesto Poppe guilty of the crimes of prevarication 
and bribery. Their sentences will be disclosed within the next 
few hours. 
  The Senate held an extraordinary session today to carry out 
the legal process which began last year in the Chamber of 
Deputies. Oblitas and Poppe were accused of extortion by former 
Nicaraguan Deputy Presidency Minister Jose Antonio Ibarra. 
  The administration of Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada supported the decision to bring the Supreme Court 
justices to trial in an attempt to prove its political resolve 
to fight corruption. The 16 senators in the ruling coalition 
formed by the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR) and Civic 
Solidarity Unity (UCS) found the two justices "guilty." The 
three senators from the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) 
voted in favor of their acquittal, while the seven senators from 
the Nationalist Democratic Action (ADN) and Conscience of the 
Fatherland (CONDEPA) abstained from participating in the session. 
  Senate President Juan Carlos Duran from the ruling coalition 
declared a recess of approximately two hours to agree on 
sentences for Oblitas and Poppe, who were suspended from their 
posts shortly after their trial began. 
  [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 0214 GMT on 12 June transmits a 
150-word report that Juan Carlos Duran, president of the Grand 
Jury of Bolivian Senators, decided today to postpone the 
sentencing of Supreme Court Chief Justice Edgar Oblitas and 
Supreme Court Dean Ernesto Poppe until Monday morning].
