  [Excerpts] La Paz, 27 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has stated that Bolivia is running the 
risk of becoming the target of "narcoguerrilla" actions. In a 
statement published by the La Paz newspaper ULTIMA HORA today, 
Sanchez de Lozada explained that in Chapare, a region in the 
central part of Cochabamba Department, "the atmosphere is ripe 
for the establishment of drug cartels or the operations of 
narco-guerrilla groups." [passage omitted] 
  Sanchez de Lozada stated that "all coca leaves produced" in 
the Chapare region are used to manufacture cocaine, not for the 
traditional and legal uses of this leaf. [passage omitted] 
  Sanchez de Lozada also announced that his administration 
wants to draft a new drug enforcement policy in coordination 
with the United States Government. 
  "This is very important for them (the North Americans), 
because even though they have acknowledged after many years that 
the responsibility for this situation should be shared, we must 
come up with a proposal capable of truly resolving this 
problem," the Bolivian president said. 
  Sanchez de Lozada agreed that drug trafficking is one of 
Bolivia's most serious problems, and stressed that it 
jeopardizes Bolivia's relations with the rest of the world.
