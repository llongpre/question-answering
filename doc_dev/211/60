  [Text] Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (NA) -- The 
presidents of Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia this morning 
agreed to establish a joint entity that will study possible 
solutions to the problems created by the continual floods of the 
Pilcomayo River. 
  This was announced this morning by Argentine Foreign 
Minister 
Guido Di Tella following the meeting among Presidents Carlos 
Menem, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in the 
Mirador Hotel. 
  Taking the opportunity of the presence of the Bolivian 
president, the Argentine and Paraguayan presidents invited him 
to help them find solutions for the Pilcomayo problems. 
  Di Tella said that these floods cause considerable 
ecological 
damage. He added that in order to solve these problems the three 
countries will seek financing from international financial 
institutions. 
  The Argentine minister said that during 1994 Argentina and 
Paraguay will try to solve the problems created by this river 
exclusively in their countries, but in 1995 the works and 
studies will have to be carried out jointly among the three 
countries. 
  Argentina and Paraguay last year had serious incidents as a 
result of the poor construction of two relief channels on both 
sides of the river in Formosa Province. 
  The issue was solved when the two governments decided to 
leave aside these faulty channels and to begin new works to 
solve the problem of the floods.
