  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has also 
commented on the clashes that occurred in Chapare. During a 
news conference, the president commented on the drug trafficking 
issue. He said Bolivia and his administration are coexisting 
with a time bomb because Law 1008 obliges the government to 
eradicate 1 hectare of coca for every cocaine maceration pit 
that is found. He said this is the cause of the problems. 
  [Begin Sanchez de Lozada recording] This causes the problem: 
We have been finding large production centers of cocaine base, 
which is purchased by the main cocaine producers who transform 
this base into cocaine. This concerns us. [end recording] 
  Asked if his administration will defend coca production, he 
said: 
  [Begin Sanchez de Lozada recording] Of course we will defend 
it. Coca is part of our society. It is a consumer product, but 
we cannot protect coca production in the Chapare region where it 
is grown exclusively for drug production, for cocaine 
production. You know very well that if you offer Chapare coca 
leaves to miners, they will refuse to chew them. Miners and 
peasants only chew coca grown in Yungas. This, however, is no 
reason to simply eradicate this coca and fill our country with 
violence. We must find solutions to this problem and these 
solutions can only be found through dialogue. Pressure from 
abroad is great and domestic damage is also great. We cannot 
forget that Bolivia is already beginning to have (?addicts) and 
drug consumption problems. Cocaine base is a very bad drug.
