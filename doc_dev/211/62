FT  10 JUN 93 / Bolivia rewards radical reformer: Christina Lamb on an
unlikely victor in presidential elections

MR GONZALO Sanchez de Lozada is living proof that radical economic reform
can bring political rewards. Since implementing a tough structural
adjustment programme as Bolivia's planning minister in 1985, he has twice
finished ahead of his rivals in presidential elections and this time seems
assured of winning his prize by actually being named president.
After polling strongly in the popular vote on Sunday, he found his way
virtually clear yesterday when former military ruler General Hugo Banzer,
his nearest rival, withdrew from a run-off vote in Congress in August. Gen
Banzer said that Mr Sanchez de Lozada would be named president.
He is an unlikely head for South America's poorest country. Raised in the
US, 62-year-old Mr Sanchez de Lozada owns Bolivia's largest private mining
concern and is one of the country's richest citizens.
He jokes: 'When I was campaigning in the interior, many people thought I was
a foreigner who'd got off a plane in La Paz and decided to run for
president.'
But he is deadly serious in his desire to build on his neo-liberal reforms
of 1985 which brought down inflation from 24,000 per cent and created a
market economy - the first Latin American country to do so under democratic
government. After eight years of austerity, Bolivia now has inflation of 9
per cent - the lowest in South America and both democracy and stability seem
consolidated.
But growth has been minimal and poverty is described by the World Bank as at
sub-Saharan Africa levels.
'The problem now is to get the economy moving again, get the money to the
people and make sure no one steals it,' says Mr Sanchez de Lozada. His
ambitious targets are for 8 per cent annual growth for the first three years
in office and 11 per cent in the last, creating 500,000 jobs and practically
wiping out unemployment.
An obvious way to start raising investment would be to privatise the main
utilities following the lead of neighbouring Argentina. But it was Mr
Sanchez de Lozada's party, the MNR, which nationalised these companies in
the 1950s and privatisation is sensitive in highly unionised Bolivia. He
explains: 'The state oil company was born out of the Chaco war in which
50,000 Bolivians died. How can I sell it to foreigners?' Instead, he has
devised an innovative 'capitalisation' plan under which investors can buy 49
per cent of the companies. While this leaves control nominally with the
state, the companies will be run by a foundation comprising 'notables' and
the private investors.
Once the companies are running efficiently, the state's part will be handed
back to the Bolivian people as freely tradeable shares worth an estimated
Dollars 4,000 per person - five times per capita income. Mr Sanchez de
Lozada believes in this way he can transfer 50 per cent of gross national
product to the people in five years, easing the massive income gap.
To carry out this 'popular capitalism' will require foreign investment.
Although local businessmen are doubtful about the attraction of investing in
companies of which they do not have control, they say that Mr Sanchez de
Lozada with his native English, sharp mind and considerable charisma is the
best possible salesman for the country.
Pointing out that 'in a country with just 7m people, a small amount of
investment has tremendous impact', he believes that capitalisation of the
six largest state companies will be 'like a motor to start up the economy'.
Estimating their assets at Dollars 2bn, he hopes to attract as much again,
boosting state and private investment, including borrowings, to Dollars 8bn
over four years - double the current rate.
Before he can do all this, Mr Sanchez de Lozada must be formally approved as
president by Congress. In the 1989 elections, he narrowly topped the polls
but a deal between the runners-up led Congress to choose the third-placed
candidate. This time his main rival has cleared the path by stepping out of
the run-off.
'I'd like to be president, not just the guy who keeps winning elections,' he
says.
