  [Excerpt] Belem, Para (Brazil), 7 Jun (EFE) -- During a 
speech to the 24th OAS General Assembly on 7 June, Bolivian 
Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga stated that the 
Bolivian Government hopes that this year it will start holding 
talks with Chile on the problem of Bolivia's land-locked 
situation. 
  Aranibar said: "We believe there are new conditions to 
tackle 
the issue of our aspirations to an outlet to the sea." He 
reported that the presidents of both countries will discuss the 
issue during the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of 
government and state to be held in the Colombian city of 
Cartagena de Indias on 14-15 June. 
  The Bolivian foreign minister asserted that "in the course 
of 
the meetings that (Bolivian) President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
held with Chilean presidential candidates before the elections, 
including then-candidate Eduardo Frei, he sensed that Chile was 
more willing to discuss that issue." 
  Bolivia's land-locked situation was on the agenda of the 
24th 
OAS General Assembly, which was inaugurated in Belem, a city in 
Para State in the Amazon, on 6 June. This issue was discussed 
by the foreign ministers of the two countries involved. 
  This question has been included on the agenda of all OAS 
General Assemblies since 1979 at the request of Bolivia and 
despite the fact that Chile has always objected to it. The 
Bolivian claim has been endorsed in the last few years by 11 OAS 
resolutions. 
  In his address to the foreign ministers and chiefs of 
delegations of the 34 OAS member countries, the Bolivian foreign 
minister asserted that his country has the right to ask the 
international community to discuss Bolivia's possibility of 
having an outlet to the sea and to give it the same treatment as 
the cases of Palestine, South Africa, and Haiti. 
  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano stated that 
his country's stance is based on respect for the principle of 
nonintervention and faithful compliance with the treaties on 
that matter. He said: "We would like once again to insist at 
this meeting on the legal arguments that prove that our claim is 
valid." [passage omitted]
