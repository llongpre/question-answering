  [Text] La Paz -- The Armed Forces general staff is 
assessing a series of state intelligence and security reports 
suggesting that Chapare, in Cochabamba Department, be declared a 
"military zone," taking into account that a series of factors in 
the region could place the country's political and social 
stability at stake. 
  The reports state that the presence of individuals linked to 
terrorism has been detected in this tropical region of 
Cochabamba. It is even suspected that they may have some 
relationship with subversive groups operating in Peru, also 
precisely in coca production areas, such as Upper Huallaga, 
which has characteristics similar to those of Chapare. 
  The reports mention, moreover, that the presence of drug 
traffickers that have come into Bolivia from Colombia has been 
detected. These traffickers are allegedly inciting the peasants 
to oppose the implementation of programs to eradicate surplus 
coca plantations, through demonstrations that recently almost 
resulted in violent clashes. 
  According to the intelligence report submitted to the Armed 
Forces high command suggesting that Chapare be declared a 
military zone, these and other factors detected in the area 
represent a worrisome prospect. National institutions must work 
to prevent the unleashing of conflict that could place internal 
security and the country's sociopolitical stability at stake. 
  Moreover, military sources who asked not to be identified 
stated that high-ranking government echelons are concerned over 
the existence of acts of sabotage against the alternative 
development program. This seriously affects the country as a 
whole regarding the fulfillment of bilateral agreements with the 
United States. 
  The Bolivian and U.S. Governments have reached drug 
enforcement agreements, including the gradual elimination of 
surplus coca plantations, in which large sums of money have been 
earmarked for alternative development programs, interdiction 
actions against drug trafficking, and aid to help maintain 
Bolivia's balance of payments. 
  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada recently voiced his 
concern over the presence of domestic disturbance factors in 
some regions of the country when he referred to the possibility 
of "narco-guerrilla" groups appearing in the country and warned 
of the need to look into this possibility more carefully. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said that there are signs of underlying 
violence in Chapare, and that if adequate and timely preventive 
measures are not taken the region could become a territory 
occupied by international drug cartels or even 
"narco-guerrillas." 
  The president of the Republic's concern also reached 
Congress, where it was stated that the possibility of violent 
actions promoted by drug traffickers and terrorists in Chapare 
"is real," according to recent comments by Cochabamba Deputy 
Hector Cartagena, of the UCS [Solidarity Civic Union]. 
  Military sources consulted by LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz stated 
that the mentioned reports are being carefully assessed in order 
to reach a specific institutional evaluation, but that in any 
case it is up to President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, in his 
capacity as the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, to make 
the decision regarding the possibility of declaring Chapare, in 
Cochabamba, a "military zone."
