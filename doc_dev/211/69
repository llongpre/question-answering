  [Text] Santiago, 30 Dec (EFE) -- Foreign Minister Enrique 
Silva Cimma today confirmed that the Chilean Government is 
looking into the possibility of resuming diplomatic relations 
with Cuba. He did not specify, however, whether this would take 
place before the change of government on 11 March. 
  Silva Cimma told the media that the subject is being studied 
"carefully" and that "every aspect of what the relationship 
between Chile and Cuba represents" is being taken into account. 
  Diplomatic relations between the two countries were broken 
following the 11 September 1973 coup to oust Chilean President 
Salvador Allende. 
  When Patricio Aylwin assumed the Chilean presidency in March 
1990, relations were restored at the consular level, despite the 
interest of the socialist sector of the governing Coalition of 
Parties for Democracy in fully resuming relations with an 
exchange of ambassadors. 
  Since then, however, there has been a strong rapprochement 
in 
the commercial field between the two countries and several 
Chilean businessmen have invested in the tourism and 
agroindustrial fields in Cuba. 
  From the political viewpoint, Carlos Lage, vice president of 
the Cuban State Council and executive secretary of the Council 
of Ministers, visited Chile in response to an invitation from 
the Chilean Government. Lage said that the invitation was a 
demonstration of the mutual interest in moving toward a gradual 
integration process 
  Last November, Chile voted at the UN General Assembly in 
favor of lifting the U.S. commercial embargo on Cuba. 
  According to political sources mentioned by the Santiago 
daily EL MERCURIO, the Chilean Government wants to resume 
relations before 11 March in view of Cuban President Fidel 
Castro's interest in attending the presidential inauguration. 
  EL MERCURIO goes on to say that within the Chilean 
Government 
there are also some who are against this idea. They consider it 
inadvisable that Castro be at the ceremony because the display 
he makes during his trips abroad might overshadow Chilean 
President-elect Eduardo Frei. 
  According to EL MERCURIO, these sectors also believe that 
Castro might create problems with other countries with which 
Chile wishes to maintain good relations. The daily thus 
recalled the public disputes between Castro and Argentine 
President Carlos Menem a few months ago in La Paz during the 
inauguration of Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada.
