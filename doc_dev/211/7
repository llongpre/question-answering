  [Text] Rocio Bernal, chief editor of Channel 7, has 
prepared an important report summarizing the main aspects of the 
meeting between Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and 
Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem in Buenos Aires: 
  [Begin Bernal recording] I have important news from 
Argentina. An important energy agreement was signed by President 
Sanchez de Lozada and Argentine President Carlos Menem. The main 
aspects of the agreement are the sale of 6.1 million cubic 
meters of natural gas per year at an initial price of $1.21 per 
cubic meters until 1996. As of 1996, the price will be increased 
annually based on international prices. For the first time 
Bolivia will sell gasoline to Argentina. This will allow Bolivia 
to obtain an income of $4 million a year. Regarding light crude 
oils, the cubic meter will be sold to Argentina at $162.50 
delivered at the Palmasola plant. 
  The official Bolivian mission that went to Argentina headed 
by President Sanchez de Lozada also was able to obtain an 
investment of $5 million for the next two years as of the 
agreement's signing. An investment of $15 million for the next 
four years also was obtained. The contract signed with Argentine 
Government Oil Deposits is an important step for the country's 
benefit, and from the quality and quantity viewpoint it is 
better than the previous contract. President Sanchez de Lozada 
expressed by phone his complete satisfaction with the result of 
his visit to Argentina because the No. 1 issue, the sale of 
natural gas to Argentina, was excellent for Bolivia after 
difficult negotiations. 
  Also, the presidents of Argentina and Bolivia reviewed 
international, regional, and bilateral issues within the 
framework of cordiality and friendship. They pointed out the 
excellent level of relations between the two governments, and 
verified the importance of the issues discussed during the 
recent visit of the Argentine foreign minister to Bolivia 
included in the La Paz Joint Declaration on 22 December 1993. 
  With the purpose of pointing out the positive results of the 
current visit, the presidents signed a joint declaration that 
says they reaffirmed their commitment to contribute to the 
consolidation of democracy in the continent as the essential 
basis for keeping peace and developing social justice to protect 
human rights and implement economic development. 
  The two presidents agreed that the invitation made by the 
four Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries to Bolivia 
to have government representatives participate as observers in 
the meetings of subgroups will contribute to strengthening the 
mechanisms of appropriate relations for joining the Mercosur 
integration process. 
  Regarding the Bolivian maritime claim, which is one of the 
main components of Bolivian foreign policy, the Bolivian 
president expressed his satisfaction over the possibilities now 
existing for sincere dialogue among all the parties involved. 
  The two presidents also expressed their conviction that the 
14th meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee of the 
Paraguay-Parana Waterway to be held in Formosa [Argentina] from 
21 to 25 March will strengthen cooperation between the states on 
the waterway program and will be progress in studying the 
related issues that will facilitate regional integration. 
  Within the framework of economic cooperation between the two 
governments, the Argentine Government gave Bolivia the 
equivalent of $84 million, of which $54 million is for local 
projects and will be disbursed from April to December. The 
remaining $30 million will be used to finance Argentine and 
Bolivian goods, installations, and equipment for a broad health 
program in the border regions of Argentina and Bolivia. To this 
effect, the two countries' health officials will prepare the 
adequate projects of basic infrastructure and health. Within 60 
days, a trade agreement will be signed establishing free 
transit, without tariffs or other types of fees, on goods 
between the two countries. This is for the competitive 
fabrication in Bolivia of products for the Argentine and 
Bolivian markets, for exporting to third countries, and for 
offering incentives for the investment of Argentine and Bolivian 
capital to this effect. The two presidents expressed their 
satisfaction with the signing of the agreement on reciprocal 
promotion and protection of investments. 
  Upon concluding his state visit, constitutional Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada thanked Argentine President 
Carlos Saul Menem for his expressions of sympathy and friendship 
and for the warm hospitality of the Argentine Government and 
people. [end recording]
