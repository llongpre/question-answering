  [Text] Colonia, 17 Jan (NA) -- President Carlos Menem today 
criticized the region's businessmen and said "there are 
companies" in Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member 
countries "that, safeguarded by an internal growth policy, were 
protected more than necessary." 
  "They lost their spirit of initiative and market 
sensitivity, 
which should be their essence, so competing in a broader market 
is a difficult challenge for them," the Argentine president said. 
  Menem's statements were interpreted as a reply to the 
demands 
made by some industrial groups in the region, especially the 
Argentine Industrial Union (UIA), which repeatedly has requested 
the postponement of the deadlines to establish Mercosur. 
  The Argentine president, however, said his government "is 
clearly concerned with this situation because behind each 
company there are capital and jobs of people whom we cannot 
forget." 
  Menem made these statements during the official opening 
ceremony of the fifth Mercosur Council meeting that is being 
attended by the presidents of Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, and 
Bolivia in the El Mirador Hotel convention hall. Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada attended the meeting as a 
special guest since his country is not a Mercosur member. ? 
With Mercosur, Menem said: "We have begun to change the 
continent's history and I would even say that we have taken a 
qualitative step toward our maturity as a nation." 
  "Interrelation has become so important that currently not 
even the major world powers can avoid political, economic, and 
cultural associations with other countries. The European Union 
and NAFTA are eloquent evidence of this." 
  He said: "The economic benefits our four countries currently 
are obtaining through Mercosur are evident," adding that one of 
the most evident accomplishments has been the increase of trade 
in the region. 
  When referring to the troublesome subject of common import 
duties, the Argentine chief of state praised the fact that the 
member countries have so far agreed on a considerable amount of 
items, although he recognized that "there is still much to be 
done." 
  "In 1994 we must make a renewed effort to improve the basic 
instruments that will guarantee fluid trade in Mercosur as a 
free trade zone and as a customs union," Menem said. 
  In turn, Brazilian President Itamar Franco said efforts in 
the past three years to establish Mercosur "were greatly 
compensated for by the positive results already attained." 
  Franco agreed with Menem that in 1994 the member countries 
will go through a decisive stage because they must define a 
common import duty to consolidate the integration process.
