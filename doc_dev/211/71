<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Gonzalo Sanchez de </F>
Lozada by Roberto Solans on 18 March; place not given] 
  [Text] [Solans] You have said the coca crop, drug 
trafficking, and misery make Bolivia a time bomb. What is your 
strategy to defuse it? 
  [Sanchez] We want to achieve significant growth levels, 
comparable with those of Chile and Argentina through 
capitalization, but with a significant social component. 
  Then comes the people's participation program that makes our 
representative democracy a participative one through the use of 
a great asset of ours; a strong understanding of the community. 
Do not forget that two thirds of our population are Indian 
groups that, unlike western societies, favor the community 
rather than the individual. 
  Taking advantage of this, we want to create a society 
capable 
of achieving significant employment and high social justice 
levels. 
  We are seeking to restore exports. In trade terms, Bolivia 
lost about 90 percent over the past 14 years. We are currently 
exporting drugs and people. 
  [Solans] The agreements that you have just signed with the 
Argentine Government seem to be aimed at achieving this goal ... 
  [Sanchez] They promote investments by both nations [Bolivia 
and Argentina] in my country to establish a raw-material 
processing industry (the processing of national raw materials in 
another country and the purchase of the finished products) that 
will allow us to export lines in which Argentina is no longer 
competitive as a consequence of its high labor costs. This way 
we will export products and not people. 
  This step, along with an increased access to the U.S. 
markets, about which we will ask U.S. Vice President Al Gore 
when he visits La Paz within a few days, should allow us to 
voluntarily eradicate coca crops. 
  [Solans] Is Mercosur [Common Market of the South] one of 
Bolivia's goals? 
  [Sanchez] We are part of the River Plate system and we want 
to be closer because Argentina and Brazil are our great markets. 
We note that Mercosur's dynamics involves expansion, but there 
should me much more opening and honesty. 
  With tariff lists that have more exceptions than uses, I 
believe the honest approach has been neglected. 
  If we are allowed access, NAFTA may lead us into a dynamic 
situation. Bolivia wants to become a bridge between Mercosur 
and the Andean market. 
  [Solans] Concerning your talks with the Argentine 
Government, 
did you receive any response on the immigrants who do not have 
any legal papers? 
  [Sanchez] We talked about establishing a new period for 
Bolivians who already are here to gain legal status. We also 
talked about enforcing new restrictions on the border and making 
entry into Argentina more difficult. 
  Bolivia wants to give more jobs to Bolivians and this is the 
goal of the free trade agreement between the two countries. We 
are attempting to create a relationship similar to the one 
existing between the United States and Mexico. 
  Deploying more guards on the border is no solution because 
barriers vanish with a little corruption. The solution is to 
create jobs in Bolivia and gain access to the Argentine market. 
  [Solans] And the gas sales to our country? 
  [Sanchez] Significant progress has been achieved. We have 
reached agreement on an indefinite, free access in both 
directions of gas and hydrocarbon by-products. We are very 
content with having defined this market. 
  A three-year contract has also been signed in which a price 
list has been established for gas because Argentina is paying 
less than we should receive. The United States, with a 
deregulated economy, is paying almost double. We understand 
that the Argentine economic process does not permit any 
traumatic cost-of-living surges and we will have to follow up on 
this. We trust there will be a gas market here for Bolivia and 
that there will be a market in Bolivia for certain Argentine oil 
by-products. 
  [Solans] What reaction might stem from the Bolivian Armed 
Forces over the impending extradition of former General [Luis] 
Garcia Meza? 
  [Sanchez] None, we believe. We are enforcing a sentence. 
The institutions are not corrupt -- men are. 
  The trial lasted seven years. He has been a fugitive for 
five years. He was discharged from the Armed Forces. It has 
been clearly established in Bolivia that this does not represent 
an attack against an institution, but against a man who has 
seriously damaged it. 
  [Solans] Do the lower echelons also understand it this way? 
  [Sanchez] I believe so. At one time it was clear that a 
group of officers were the culprits. As time went by there has 
been a natural renewal within the Armed Forces and now it is 
understood that this case belongs to the past and justice must 
be meted out. 
  [Solans] And in the political circles? 
  [Sanchez] We don't know. Some people are fearful of what 
Garcia Meza might say. I believe this is not the case, that 
everything was disclosed at the proper time and that, despite 
speculations by the press, there will be nothing new. I believe 
satisfaction prevails because impunity has been punished, 
something that is not usual in our countries. 
  [Solans] Is it true, as some political circles in La Paz 
claim, there are officials in your government who closely 
cooperated with Garcia Meza's regime? 
  [Sanchez] No. Thank God I have no one who was linked to 
drug trafficking or Garcia Meza. Our party was not involved, 
while other parties, for various reasons, were involved in Gen. 
Garcia Meza's project. 
  [Solans] Which ones? 
  [Sanchez] General Hugo Banzer's Nationalist Democratic 
Action. Nevertheless, they moved away when they realized the 
nature of that government.
