  [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar yesterday 
announced that President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will travel 
to Colombia on 14 June to attend the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit, which is to be held in Cartagena. 
  This will be the first time Sanchez de Lozada will attend 
this forum, at which 23 presidents and chiefs of state from the 
continent and Spain meet every year. The summit will last two 
days. 
  This year the main subject of the summit will be regional 
trade and democracy. The first meeting was held in Guadalajara, 
Mexico. Four years ago Bolivia was represented by Jaime Paz 
Zamora, who was president at that time. 
  Aranibar also announced that Bolivia will send a 
representative to an international meeting to be held next week 
within the framework of the OAS annual forum, where countries of 
the continent will assess the progress made in the struggle 
against drug trafficking and the cooperation between countries 
to face this crime.
