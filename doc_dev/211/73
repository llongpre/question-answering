  [Text] Yesterday President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said 
that the DEA works and must continue to work in a coordinated 
manner with the national institutions and abiding by the 
Bolivian laws. 
  In response to the concern expressed by several sectors 
regarding the alleged interference by foreign agents or 
organizations in domestic affairs, the president explained: "We 
are getting the DEA to work in a coordinated manner with the 
Bolivian institutions, abiding by the national laws." 
  The chief of state said that at a personal and diplomatic 
level he clearly stated that the orders must come from Bolivia, 
as we are waging a great joint struggle against drug trafficking 
and for this need U.S. support. 
  The president said: "We need U.S. assistance, but it should 
be granted within a framework of mutual respect and the 
effectiveness that stems from adequate coordination." 
  In Sanchez de Lozada's opinion, the DEA has heard the 
criticisms from various sectors of the country, and he believes 
it has understood the rules of the game. 
  He stated, however, that as a result of these criticisms he 
is not going to adopt a chauvinist attitude nor seek to easily 
gain popularity by criticizing the United States for what has 
happened. 
  The DEA's work in Bolivia is being questioned by political 
and social sectors, among them the Church, which believe that 
the DEA is violating Bolivian sovereignty. 
  U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia Charles Bower was the first U.S. 
Government authority to answer these expressions of concern, 
stating that there are no signs of interference in domestic 
affairs.
