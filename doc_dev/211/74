Sir, Your readers, and I think Bolivia, deserve better than Chris
Philipsborn's article 'Architect of austerity ahead in Bolivian poll' (March
9).
We are shortly to hold our four-yearly presidential and congressional
elections and you may be right in suggesting that Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada
will be first past the post. He may, although I very much doubt it, become
president for a four-year term in the run-off. But what he, much less you,
can not claim is that he is responsible for the crackling economy which the
incoming president will receive from the hands of the Jaime Paz Zamora
government, of which I am the chief economic minister.
Over the past 12 months inflation in Bolivia has been cut to just 8 per cent
(much better than in Chile or Mexico). That is two and a half times better
than when Mr Sanchez de Lozada left office. Growth was 3.8 per cent in 1992
and we are heading for 5 per cent this year. The average annual growth
during the Paz Zamora government has been 3.5 per cent, 10 times greater
than the 0.35 per cent growth bequeathed to us by the previous government.
Investors are voting with their cheque-books. Today there are more than four
times the volume of dollar bank deposits than there were when the last
government left office. Foreign currency deposits in the commercial banks
were close to zero and in any case less than Dollars 500m. Today they are
close to Dollars 1.7bn.
This, and a lot more of the same, is not the result of Mr Sanchez de
Lozada's policies. We all wish economic growth was merely a question of
setting the right policy. But the reality is that the economic successes of
the Jaime Paz Zamora government have been brought about by hard-headed
cost-cutting and control on a daily, cash basis by a tough group of
politicians and civil servants, many of whom have degrees from the same
schools as the people who run Washington and London.
Your reporter talks of 'botched' privatisations. What on earth can he be
talking about? Leaving aside a score of companies that have been privatised,
some with the help of accountants Price Waterhouse, we have just shut down
the massive Banco del Estado and virtually closed Comibol, the old state
mining company, which under Mr Sanchez de Lozada was beginning to be
reorganised. Today, the workforce is down to just 10 per cent of the
original 25,000.
The real story in Bolivia concerns a rising generation of young politicians,
bankers and businessmen who are running the country according to the rules
of a 'parliamentary democracy', in the words of Professor Jeffrey Sachs of
Harvard. This group, which includes President Jaime Paz Zamora as well as Mr
Sanchez de Lozada, is unified only by its desire to establish a free market
in Bolivia.
My party wants to take this further and search for ways to relate the market
to social justice. We are concerned that growth and inflation figures do not
reflect that two-thirds of our population is poorly educated, malnourished,
and living close to the poverty line.
