Audits and accountants are hardly the stuff of high stakes political
intrigue. But in Bolivia, bean counting is becoming a high-risk profession.
Last year, Bolivia approved a law introducing financial controls, snap
inspections and audits throughout the government in a bid to reduce
corruption and make public administration more efficient. The aim is to make
government more accountable, strengthening Bolivia's fragile democracy. The
clampdown threatens powerful people, principally the politicians,
businessmen, unions, generals and bureaucrats who for generations have
plundered the state with impunity.
The architect of the law is Mr Antonio Sanchez de Lozada, a choleric
60-year-old businessman who was appointed Bolivia's comptroller-general in
1982. He has dedicated his 10-year term, which has six months left to run,
to the seemingly hopeless task of making his department - a sort of
turbocharged audit bureau - effective for the first time since its creation
in 1928.
Mr Sanchez de Lozada realised that many of Bolivia's problems stemmed from a
powerful, but ineffective and corrupt state: Until recently, it dominated
the economy and incurred unsustainable deficits financed with crushing
foreign debts and inflation; the result was permanent instability; and as
state-controlled institutions became increasingly discredited and ceased to
function, so the edifice of the state began to crumble.
No other country in Latin America is a better example of this institutional
paralysis: Bolivia has had more coups d'etat than any other state; poverty
is widespread; and hyperinflation, having reached a peak of 24,000 per cent
in 1985, forcing the government to introduce radical economic reforms, has
now been brought under control, and the economy is growing modestly. Yet
government remains as ineffective and discredited as ever because corruption
and incompetence have not been satisfactorily attacked.
The free-market reforms sweeping Latin America remain tenuous, in part
because few countries have established sound institutions as the bedrock of
democracy and a capitalist economy. In February, Venezuela was shaken by an
army uprising. Last month, President Alberto Fujimori seized dictatorial
powers in Peru. Shortly after, Bolivia's President Jaime Paz Zamora
threatened to close congress.
Yet there are some encouraging trends. Argentina is now emulating Bolivia's
reforms. This is significant, given that Argentina's recent past is as
unenviable as Bolivia's. Buenos Aires is introducing free-market reforms in
addition to auditing and control mechanisms similar to Bolivia's.
Bolivia's legislation on auditing controls will introduce a framework of
modern management principles underpinned by clear policy objectives and
budgets. The comptroller-general is in charge of enforcing targets,
authorising snap inspections of bureaucracies and conducting routine audits.
He also has the power to prosecute. The auditors will check all departments
of the executive branch - including sensitive areas such as the armed
forces. Monopolies and companies or organisations that receive state support
must also be monitored.
Besides tackling corruption and boosting efficiency, the legislation is
designed to make government accountable.
The system has yet to be fully introduced and so it is too early to draw any
conclusions. Yet nobody doubts Mr Sanchez de Lozada's personal commitment.
Much of his work has been low-level and routine, although several cases have
brought him face to face with the biggest names in Bolivian politics. He and
his staff have received death threats.
Few people really believed congress would approve the reforms. But Mr
Sanchez de Lozada says: 'After 1985, people were willing to listen.
Hyperinflation opened their minds. Everyone was fed up with extortion.
People are demanding institutions that are beyond the grasp of politicians.'
Nonetheless, he has few illusions about the challenge he faces. Many of the
concepts underlying the legislation (like the rule of law and
accountability) are recent developments in Latin America.
Countries with a history of authoritarianism can hardly be expected to
change overnight. Any reforms in Bolivia will remain largely ineffective
without the development of a professional civil service and judiciary
independent of the government of the day.
There are considerable misgivings about the government's motives for
approving the audit law. Many dismiss it as a public relations exercise and
doubt it will ever confront big business, the ruling party or the army.
Until now, these groups were beyond effective control.
Equally, no Latin country has shown it can resist the international drug
trade's recourse to bribery and intimidation.
Mr Sanchez de Lozada's investigations into corrupt practices are now being
criticised as likely to provoke another coup. His term of office expires in
November. If his successor is a cypher, the doubters will be vindicated. But
if the government appoints a respected and effective replacement, Latin
America's weakest democracy will have taken another big step forward. It
would be a step its neighbours would do well to copy.
