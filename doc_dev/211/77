FT  18 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Brazil-Bolivia pipeline block - A look at
stalled negotiations for a Dollars 1.8bn natural gas project

To the president of Bolivia, Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, it seems simple.
His country has a huge surplus of natural gas, while its neighbour, Brazil,
has an impending energy shortage. Pumping cheap gas to Brazil's industrial
south should therefore make everybody happy.
But, as Mr Sanchez de Lozada has discovered during negotiations in Brazil
this week, contracts involving natural resources and sovereignty over
infrastructure are rarely straightforward. Although both sides agree that
the Dollars 1.8bn pipeline will eventually go ahead, arguments about
shareholdings in the project and the volumes to be pumped threaten to delay
the venture further.
'The project is of the highest importance to Bolivia but no bank is going to
finance it unless they can see the pricing and volumes are right. This is
not a question of brinksmanship or who wins,' he says.
Brazil and Bolivia have long talked of building a gas pipeline but
negotiations only began in earnest in 1991, when a Brazilian study concluded
that gas was more efficient and environmentally sound than other energy
sources, and could reduce oil imports by at least 100,000 barrels a day.
As such, it seemed to offer a solution to Brazil's looming energy shortage.
About 95 per cent of the country's electricity comes from hydroelectric
power stations. But these take up to 10 years to build and the government's
economic problems have halted construction at many stations.
'If the country grows at 4 per cent a year - not fast for Brazil - in three
years we will reach capacity. Gas would be an alternative for this 'black
hole' between the finishing of the halted plants and opening of new ones,'
says Mr Eugenio Mancini Scheleder at Brazil's mines and energy ministry.
The two countries agreed in February last year to build a 3,400km pipeline
between Santa Cruz in Bolivia and Brazil's industrial capital Sao Paulo.
Brazil was to begin by buying 8m cu m of gas daily, rising to 16m cu m
within seven years.
Then the problems started, first over pricing. Brazil said the cost to its
consumers of imported gas had to compete with subsidised electricity prices,
thereby undermining Bolivia's profit margin. Petrobras, Brazil's oil and gas
monopoly, took a particularly aggressive stance in the negotiations, arguing
that Bolivia, one of Latin America's poorest countries, badly needed the
project to earn foreign exchange and that Brazil was Bolivia's only
potential customer on the continent.
The biggest row, which President Sanchez de Lozada and Brazil's President
Itamar Franco have been trying to defuse this week, is over shareholdings.
Brazil's constitution assures Petrobras a monopoly over the production and
import of oil and natural gas in Brazil. Petrobras believes this means it
should hold 51 per cent of the shares in the Brazilian portion of the
pipeline, easily the largest section. Meanwhile, both sides have agreed that
they will take small, symbolic stakes in each other's pipeline.
In what might have been a bid to head off further debate over shareholdings,
Petrobras announced at the weekend that it would work with BTB, a joint
venture between BHP, Tenneco and British Gas, on the project, with BTB
holding a significant but as yet undefined shareholding.
However, President Sanchez de Lozada this week arrived in Brazil saying
Bolivia wanted a 49 per cent stake in the pipeline, instead of the 4 per
cent Petrobras allegedly offered. 'We have the gas, they have the market. It
should be parity,' he says.
Bolivia seems to have raised its shareholding demand as a negotiating tactic
to persuade Brazil to increase the volumes of gas it will buy. Bolivia needs
the extra money to develop its gas fields and reserves.
Negotiations about the shareholdings were continuing yesterday, the closing
date for the original contract, at presidential level. A compromise is
likely, even if the sides only agree at this stage to delay a decision but
extend the contract. 'The pipeline is too good for too many people for
either side to walk away,' according to a member of BTB.
But the arguments have highlighted how much work still needs to be done
before construction can begin. Under the original contract, financing was
meant to be in place by now. But discussions with banks and international
agencies has so far been preliminary because of delays and confusion over
the project's structure. Detailed feasibility studies and market testing
have not yet started, even though Brazil wants to begin construction in the
third quarter of next year. To do so, financing needs to be in place by the
middle of next year: a target which is described as 'aggressive if not
impossible' by another BTB member.
Brazil says the main part of the project needs investment of Dollars 1.4bn,
of which Dollars 600m will be in equity and Dollars 800m in debt finance.
Raising that much money should not be difficult, given the project's
environmental advantages and importance to Bolivia. But the wrangling is
unhelpful, particularly after the World Bank hinted it was unhappy lending
to a project where the state-owned - and autocratic - Petrobras was a
majority shareholder.
