   President Victor Paz Estenssoro is to
step down on Aug. 6, but there is no leader waiting in the wings to
assume control of this impoverished nation of 6.9 million people.
   No party won an absolute majority in May 7 elections and the top
three vote-getters have been unable to choose the next president.
   Uncertainty over who will be Bolivia's 77th president has raised
political and economic tensions in this impoverished nation of 6.9
million.
   In May, voters chose among nine presidential candidates.
   Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, candidate for the governing
Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, won a relative majority with 24
percent of the vote. Former military dictator Gen. Hugo Banzer
Suarez of the conservative Nationalist Democratic Action Party
trailed Sanchez de Lozada by just 1 percent and Jaime Paz Zamora of
the Social Democratic Movement of the Revolutionary Left, won 19
percent of the vote.
   According to the constitution, the president must be elected
from the top three parties by a new congress chosen according to
the percentage of popular votes each party received.
   A presidential candidate must receive 79 congressional votes to
be elected. Sanchez de Lozada party's has 49, Banzer's party has 46
and Paz Zamora's party, 41.
   The new congress is scheduled to meet Aug. 4 and should elect a
president in time for the Aug. 6 inauguration. But three leading
candidates have been unable to form an alliance to provide
sufficient congressional votes to elect a president.
   Earlier this week, Roman Catholic bishops mediated negotiations
between Banzer, Sanchez de Lozada and Paz Zamora and the three
candidates signed a declaration promising congress will choose a
new president by Aug. 6.
   In recent weeks, Paz Zamora's left-of-center party negotiated
its support for Banzer in return for the presidency of Congress and
regional development corporations. Leaders in Zamora's party,
however, broke ranks and refused to support Banzer, who persecuted
them during his 1971 to 1978 dictatorship.
   Sanchez de Lozada, 59, offered Paz Zamora a major role in the
government in exchange for his support. Sanchez de Lozada also said
that his party would back Paz Zamora for president after his four
year term ended.
   Paz Zamora, 50, has not yet responded to Sanchez de Lozada's
proposal.
   Business leaders have asked the three candidates to resolve
their differences out of concern for the conflict's impact on the
economy.
   Banks have frozen the disbursement of loans, and businesses
report a slowdown in the economy. In response to the political
crisis, citizens have also pulled millions of dollars in deposits
from banks.
   Despite an uncertainty over who will be the next president,
however, the government has managed to keep a lid on inflation and
maintain the confidence of foreign governments and lending
organizations. Inflation since January is running at 5 percent, one
of the lowest rates in South America.
   The U.S. government also granted Bolivia a $100 million loan to
shore up the economy.
   The three candidates have said that if elected president, they
will maintain the basic elements of the government's free market
economic program, which managed to halt 24,000 percent inflation in
1985.
   The economy is expected to expand by at least 3 percent this
year, the first real growth in more than a decade.
   After presidential elections in 1979 and 1980, a similar
stalemate resulted in bloody military coups.
   Today, however, the military high command is supportive of the
democratic process and there are no rumblings from the barracks.
   The Aug. 6 swearing-in would be the first time in 25 years that
a civilian president has completed his term and turned over the
presidency to a democratically elected government.
