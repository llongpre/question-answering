  [Text] While addressing the third working meeting of the 
Ninth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) on 
27 June, Chilean President Eduardo Frei stated: "The lessons 
learned in Chile from its traumatic recent past have taught us 
that democracy is an absolute, indivisible value that cannot be 
minimized." 
  The Chilean president added that there may be "different 
ways 
to organize a state from the institutional viewpoint, but there 
cannot be different types of democracies for different types of 
societies. Democracy, in essence, cannot be upgraded or 
downgraded." 
  Frei continued: "We believe democracy exists when free, 
secret, and informed elections are held. We believe democracy 
exists when institutions and state branches are respected. We 
believe democracy exists when there is a Congress that 
functions, when there is an opposition force to supervise 
government actions. We believe democracy exists when there is an 
independent judicial branch to uphold the due process of law," 
and when "there is freedom of expression with communications 
media, freedom of information, and freedom of assembly." 
  Frei added that world "politicians and political leaders are 
harshly criticized; many say they are not politicians. Those of 
us seated here--heads of state are political leaders--are very 
proud to be politicians." 
  He added that if we want to rescue politics we have to 
address "two basic concepts. First, a basic ethical and moral 
concept and, second, a political leader must have a close 
relationship with the people. We must be concerned about every 
citizen, no matter how modest and humble." 
  The Chilean president said: "We must seek broad agreements 
within our countries. When a president seeks agreements and 
consensus within his country, the people say that he is weak, 
that he lacks power, and authority. I believe it is quite the 
opposite; those of us who seek great agreements and consensus 
bring stability to the countries, bring grandeur to labor." We 
respect power and authority "but at the same time we believe 
power to be impersonal, we believe the law is superior, and we 
believe in respect for the people." 
  President Frei met yesterday with his Bolivian counterpart 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. It was later disclosed that in 
September the foreign ministries of the two countries will 
disclose a proposal to step up bilateral relations. Frei denied 
that these talks will imply yielding territory to Bolivia, 
adding that "the subject is not on the agenda." Frei admitted, 
however, that the subject was raised by the Bolivian chief of 
state. 
  Frei commented on his meeting with Sanchez de Lozada, 
stating 
that it is important to meet with the various chiefs of state to 
assess relationships and determine how to improve them. 
  Frei will meet today with Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
  Although he did not disclose the subjects they will address, 
Frei said he upholds the proposal made at the summit: "We want 
democracy and want to consolidate it," just as we want "respect 
for human rights." He added: "Practically every country has 
asked Cuba for a gesture. We want Cuba in the Latin American 
system, but the next move is basically up to them."
