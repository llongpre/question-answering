  [Text] La Paz, 26 Mar (EFE) -- Former Bolivian President 
Jaime Paz Zamora announced his withdrawal from politics today. 
The announcement came after a police investigation linking him 
to drug-trafficking activities. 
  In a televised address to the nation, Paz Zamora said during 
his term in office (1989-93) "there was no crime, but there were 
errors," in reference to his relations with Isac Chavarria, 
alias Oso, allegedly Bolivia's most notorious drug trafficker. 
  Paz Zamora appeared spiritless on the television screen. He 
stood as he delivered dramatically his statement at the side of 
a crucifix. 
  The Special Force for the Struggle Against Drug Trafficking 
[Fuerza Especial de Luchas Contra el Narcotrafico--FELCN] 
revealed this week there are indications that during his 
presidential administration, Paz Zamora received and obeyed 
instructions from Chavarria to appoint officers in the Armed 
Forces and the government. 
  FELCN also delivered to a parliamentary commission a report 
indicating relatives of the former president as well as 
distinguished members of the social democratic Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left [MIR], Paz Zamora's party, gave protection to 
the drug trafficker. 
  Among the accused are Susana Seleme, Paz Zamora's secretary 
when he was president, and MIR leader Oscar Eid. 
  Colonel Faustino Rico Toro, who in 1991 was appointed 
commander in chief of the antidrug struggle, was arrested on 22 
March. The U.S. Government asked the Bolivian Government for 
his extradition on drug-trafficking charges on 23 March. 
  In announcing his withdrawal from politics, Paz Zamora, 
current vice president of Socialist International, acknowledged 
implicitly his relations with Chavarria but said he always acted 
in "good faith, close to naivete." 
  Several MIR leaders and relatives of the former president 
have admitted an old friendship united Chavarria and Paz Zamora 
who appear together in various old pictures the media have 
published. 
  Although he admitted his "mistakes," Paz Zamora said today 
he 
is astonished by certain people's "intention to treat 
maliciously" his personal relations, referring to his relations 
with Chavarria, who is in La Paz' maximum security prison. 
  The president said the charges against him "have not been 
proved" and accused his accusers of "tarnishing my family's 
honor." 
  The former president said he is concerned only with "the 
international impact" the charges against him and his party may 
have. He said "an effort is being made now to deny the results 
of the antidrug struggle" that his government waged, a struggle 
that has been acknowledged by the international community, he 
claimed. 
  Since handing the Presidency over to Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada following the 6 June 1993 elections, Paz Zamora has 
secluded himself in his private residence in the town of Tarija, 
on the border with Argentina. 
  He made his only public appearance today since then. It came 
several months after the first reports of the drug-trafficking 
charges against his party, charges that in the past few days 
have centered on him.
