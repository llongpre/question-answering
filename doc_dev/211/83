  [Text] The issue of the reduction of Armed Forces human and 
financial resources continues in the news. In a speech, 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has denied it. 
  [Begin Sanchez de Lozada recording] I want to tell you that 
there never were, and never will be any plans of the sort 
reported in an opposition newspaper article--which, 
unfortunately, acquired some notoriety--because this institution 
safeguards all Bolivians, our sovereignty, our democracy, and 
our development. 
  We undoubtedly need to adopt many measures to improve the 
institution. That is only natural. These measures seek to make 
the Armed Forces a stronger institution, allowing them to better 
fulfill their institutional duties and to better represent and 
defend our fatherland. [end recording]
