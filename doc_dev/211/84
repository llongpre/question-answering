  [Text] Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada on 3 
April went to Sipesipe, a provincial village, where he attended 
Easter Mass. The president was very happy and in good spirits. 
Speaking to the local press, the president said that this will 
be a key month because the Popular Participation Bill, the 
educational reform bill, and the national budget will be 
approved here. He announced that workers will not receive any 
more salary increases. The president encouraged leaders of 
civic committees and municipal authorities to resort to dialogue.

leaders will participate in a dialogue with the government

Bill and the national budget to allow the economy to operate 
according to [words indistinct] so that municipalities can start 
getting funds as of May and improve the standards of living of 
the people in their counties. The Popular Participation Bill is
