   Governing party candidate Gonzalo Sanchez
de Lozada today claimed an upset election victory over former
military dictator Hugo Banzer Suarez, but the congress will have
final say over who becomes president.
   Neither candidate appeared to have won more than 50 percent of
the vote in Sunday's election so, by law, the new congress will
choose the president.
   Nevertheless, Sanchez de Lozada's surprising finish provided a
kind of public endorsement of the government's conservative,
free-market economic program, which has included severe austerity
measures.
   It also was expected to help ensure continuity in this
impoverished country's U.S.-financed war on cocaine production and
trafficking.
   All 27 Senate and 130 House of Deputies seats were also up for
election, but officials said there would be no clear indication on
how each party had fared until later today.
   No official figures were available and the tally was expected to
take nearly three weeks to complete as votes arrived from remote
parts of the landlocked, largely undeveloped South American country.
   An independent television station, the Bolivian Television
Association, said Banzer of the center-right Nationalist Democratic
Action party led with 27.7 percent of the vote to 27.3 percent for
Sanchez de Lozada of the Conservative Revolutionary Nationalist
Movement.
   It based its computerized projections on a tally of 851,437
votes of the estimated 1.8 million cast nationwide.
   The station said, however, that Sanchez de Lozada was projected
to eventually pull ahead a percentage point when the rural vote
came in. Banzer was strong in cities, which reported their returns
quickly,. Sanchez de Lozada was counting on a big vote from the
countryside.
   Sanchez de Lozada's campaign manager, Andres Petricevic, said
his party projected a victory with 29 percent of the vote to 27
percent for Banzer.
   Late Sunday, Banzer's party refused to concede defeat but said
it would respect the ``will of the people.''
   Jaime Paz Zamora of the Social Democratic Movement of the
Revolutionary Left was running third with 204,717 votes or 22.3
percent. Six other contenders trailed far behind.
   The new congress convenes on Aug. 4 and will have two days to
select the president, whose inauguration to a four-year term is
scheduled for Aug. 6.
   Banzer, 62, had sought victory by a margin of 5 percentage
points or more to oblige congress to respect the popular vote and
name him president. He finished first in the 1985 election with
28.6 percent but congress picked the runner-up, Victor Paz
Estenssoro, who had 26.4 percent.
   The 81-year-old incumbent is retiring after a tumultuous career
that spanned half a century and included three periods as president.
   Sanchez de Lozada, 58, said on the eve of the election that he
felt confident of being picked president if he finished first or a
close second. A wealthy mine owner, he was educated in the United
States and has a philosophy degree from the University of Chicago.
   Most opinion polls showed Banzer as the front-runner this year
and he was confident enough to say his party would back whomever
finished first. He called on other parties to do the same but,
trailing in the polls, they declined.
   The vote took place in a holiday-like atmosphere, with a calm
and order remarkable for what once was the continent's most
politically volatile country. Since the turn of the century there
have been 13 coups; with nine governments between 1978 and 1982.
   Some irregularities were reported, including the arrest of three
people who carried several different identity cards and apparently
planned to vote several times. There also were reports that some
voters were given already marked ballots, but foreign observers
said they had no initial indications of widespread fraud.
   Paz Estenssoro said upon casting his ballot that the elections
would help lead Bolivians to political maturity. ``The important
thing is to consolidate democracy,'' he said.
   He launched a severe economic program when he took office in
1985 to halt economic chaos, including an annual inflation rate of
23,000 percent.
   The austerity measures included laying off 35,000 state miners
and other public workers, a tenfold increase in the price of
gasoline and a 95 percent currency devaluation.
   Banzer, Sanchez de Lozada and Paz Zamora pledged to maintain the
program, which has cut inflation to 15 percent a year and
contributed to some small economic growth for the first time in a
decade.
   In addition, they all vowed to continue the government's battle
against cocaine production and trafficking. The United States
provides about $55 million dollars a year for the efforts, which
include programs to reduce coca leaf cultivation in Bolivia's
jungles.
