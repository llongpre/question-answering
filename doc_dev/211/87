  [Text] Colonia, Uruguay -- The four presidents of the 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries have reaffirmed 
the principles, goals, and timetables established in the 
Asuncion Treaty to move ahead in a coordinated, balanced, and 
sustained manner toward the establishment of a customs union and 
setting the basis for structuring Mercosur in a joint communique 
released at the conclusion of the presidential summit. 
  They also noted that the coordination of macroeconomic 
policies is an essential condition for the sucess of the 
integration process. 
  They pointed out that the fulfillment of the timetable 
established in Las Lenas [Argentina], as well as the 
instrumentation of the decision of the Common Market Council on 
the common external tariff, measures, and instruments for 
structuring Mercosur, are a firm commitment of the four 
countries. They also agreed that the progress on the different 
priority areas must be made symmetrically and simultaneously. 
  Recognizing that the main challenge is to promote the 
prosperity of their people and to reach the highest standard of 
living, the presidents expressed their special satisfaction in 
face of the substantial trade increase within Mercosur which 
went from $3.6 billion in 1990 -- before the Asuncion Treaty was 
signed -- to more than $8 billion in 1993. 
  This accelerated trade growth is the result, among other 
reasons, of the fulfillment of the commercial liberation program 
which currently has a tariff preference of 82 percent between 
the states. 
  They also expressed their satisfaction over the technical 
progress reached on the common external tariff, and asserted 
their determination to conclude the definition of the common 
external tariff on 30 June 1994 as the basic instrument for 
structuring the customs union which is a significant stage for 
establishing the common market. 
  They also emphasized the importance of the special meeting 
to 
be held this year to establish the institutional structure of 
Mercosur. The meeting will serve to create the permanent 
institutions that will start operating on 1 January 1995. They 
also recognized the importance of the current and future works 
of infrastructure which are the basis of physical integration 
that also includes the water way. 
  In the joint communique the four presidents also recognized 
the importance of strengthening the Latin American Integration 
Association. They pointed out that it is essential to maintain 
the integrity of the 1980 Montevideo Treaty which made important 
projects possible. 
  They also expressed their safisfaction over the presence of 
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and reiterated 
their pleasure at the Bolivian Government's willingness to 
strengthen its links with Mercosur. They also noted the 
institutional cooperation provided by the EC with Mercosur as 
well as the cooperation given by the Inter-American Development 
Bank.
