   Jaime Paz Zamora, the third-place
finisher in May elections, was elected president of Bolivia
following an all-night debate in Congress, officials said today.
   Paz Zamora garnered 98 of the 156 votes after former dictator
Gen. Hugo Banzer Suarez cast his support to the 50-year-old. Paz
Zamora, head of the Social Democratic Movement of the Revolutionary
Left, had been arrested by Banzer in 1974 and accused of trying to
overthrow the government.
   Luis Ossio Sanjines, an ally of Banzer and head of the Christian
Democratic Party, was elected vice president.
   Swearing-in ceremonies for the Bolivian leaders' four-year terms
is scheduled for Sunday afternoon.
   The opposition had held up balloting because of alleged voting
irregularities in the May 7 election.
   No candidate received a majority in the voting, so under
Bolivia's Constitution, the Congress chose from the top three
contenders.
   Squeezed out by the Paz Zamora-Banzer alliance was Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada of the governing Nationalist Revolutionary
Movement.
   Sanchez de Lozada had received 24 percent of the vote in May
while Banzer, who ruled Bolivia from 1971-79, had 23 percent and
Paz Zamora 18 percent.
   The alliance with Banzer assured Paz Zamora of the votes to win
the presidency with their two parties holding 79 of the
congressional seats.
   Bolivia has had more than 100 coups or revolutions since it
gained its independence from Spain in 1825 and Sunday's inaguration
will be the first time in 25 years that a government has completed
its term and transferred power to a democratically elected
president.
   The alliance between Paz Zamora's party and Banzer's
conservative Nationalist Democratic Action could be an uneasy
partnership.
   Paz Zamora was jailed for six months after he was arrested in
1974 and accused of trying to overthrow Banzer.
   Announcement of the alliance came as a surprise to many
Bolivians and led to a run on banks. In two days depositers
withdrew the equivalent of $13 million from the banks.
   Paz Zamora met with business and banking officials Thursday and
told them his government would maintain a free market economy and
the current stabilization program.
   President Victor Paz Estenssoro implemented tough austerity
measures when he took over in 1985. They included a restructuring
of state companies, firing 23,000 government-employed miners, a
ten-fold increase in the price of gasoline and a wage freeze. The
measures lowered inflation from 24,000 percent in 1985 to an
estimated 6 percent for 1989. Paz Estenssoro is Paz Zamora's uncle.
   U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard said Friday, ``We expect to have
a very good relationship with this government and Paz Zamora has
indicated to me his interest in attracting foreign investments to
Bolivia.''
   Paz Zamora is the son of a career army officer.
   He attended a Roman Catholic seminary in Argentina but then went
to Belgium, where he was active in university politics.
   When he returned to Bolivia in 1971 he founded the Movement of
the Revolutionary Left and advocated armed struggle to overthrow
Banzer, who seized power in a coup in 1971.
   After he was released, Paz Zamora went into exile abroad. He
came back to Bolivia in 1977 and resumed his political activities.
   In 1980, his party formed a coalition with the Communist Party
and the Leftist Revolutionary Nationalist Movement under the
leadership of Hernan Siles Zuazo and the coalition won the election.
   A military coup in July 1980 blocked the installation of Siles
Zuazo as president and Paz Zamora as vice president. In 1982, the
military stepped down and turned over the government to Siles Zuazo.
   Siles Zuazo and Paz Zamora stepped down in 1985, a year before
their terms expired, because of social unrest and political
pressure. During the Siles Zuazo administration inflation reached
24,000 percent and strikes were a daily ocurrence.
   Paz Zamora ran for the presidency in 1985 and finished third
with 8 percent of the vote.
