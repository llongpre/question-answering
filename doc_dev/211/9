  [Excerpt] Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
arrived at Silvio Pettirossi international airport this morning. 
He said: "During this visit we will close agreements that will 
be remembered for a long time." Sanchez de Lozada was 
accompanied by his wife and a large entourage of businessmen. He 
was received by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. According to 
Sanchez de Lozada, natural gas and the two countries' road 
connection will top the presidents' agenda. 
  The Bolivian president said it was an honor and a great 
satisfaction to be in Asuncion. 
  "I think this will be a historic visit. We will achieve many 
things, and we will reach agreements that will be remembered for 
a long time," Sanchez said after the protocol ceremony and still 
on the landing strip. 
  Regarding the agenda's main issues, Sanchez de Lozada said 
the two presidents will talk about the sale of Bolivian gas to 
our country and full integration through a paved highway 
crossing Paraguay's Chaco region, "creating a single heart for 
the entire continent." [passage omitted]
