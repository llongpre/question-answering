  [Text] La Paz, 13 Jun (PL) -- The Ibero-American Summit 
being held this week in Cartagena de Indias should serve to 
consolidate that international forum, according to Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  The chief of state made this statement in an interview 
granted to PRENSA LATINA before beginning an overseas tour that 
will include his participation in the Ibero-American Summit. He 
described the summit as important to help the member-countries 
coordinate their policies, adding that it will serve as a 
fitting venue for the presidents to discuss topics that interest 
them. 
  [Robles] Mr. President, what are your expectations regarding 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit? What do you think the 
summit's priorities should be? 
  [Sanchez] Regarding the Ibero-American Summit, I must note 
that it is a meeting whose importance is undeniable to the 
extent that it will permit the definitive consolidation of this 
international forum and will serve as a hub for relations among 
member-countries. 
  In keeping with modern times, the most important topics will 
deal with the implementation of the most dynamic mechanisms of 
commercial exchange and regional and subregional integration. 
At the same time, such mechanisms could serve as the means to 
aid the various countries in their struggle to consolidate their 
internal development and to strengthen the social policies that 
will improve the living standards of the people. 
  [Robles] What is your assessment of the Ibero-American 
summits held so far? Do you think they have met expectations? 
  [Sanchez] The preceding summits were highly significant, 
because for the first time we set up a mechanism for 
Ibero-American relations. In this area, we can stress two 
principal achievements: 
  A. Following its inception, policies are now coordinated 
among member-countries, and cooperation and integration among 
the countries have improved, both on the bilateral and 
multilateral level. 
  B. Attendance at these summits is significant, considering 
that the presidents avail themselves of such meetings to discuss 
topics that are of particular interest, especially on the 
bilateral level. 
  Also, I must note, that on this occasion the meeting will 
broach the problem of the native and Indian peoples of the 
continent. This demonstrates that important progress has been 
made in identifying the new social problems and permits 
consolidating and strengthening the democratic processes in the 
region. 
  [Robles] Considering the importance your administration 
attaches to international cooperation, what are your 
expectations regarding the Ibero-American Summit is this area? 
  [Sanchez] This Ibero-American Summit must attempt to 
strengthen the objectives outlined in previous summits and also 
render a renewed impetus for regional integration, through the 
analysis of topics such as trade, sustained development, and 
cooperation, seeking to alleviate the existing social problems. 
  [Robles] Some time ago your government announced a 
diplomatic 
plan of action aimed at decriminalizing the international trade 
of the coca leaf. Will you broach this option at the 
Ibero-American Summit? 
  [Sanchez] At the next summit, the Bolivian Government will 
present findings to the rest of the countries that demonstrate 
the process of structural reforms undertaken and the new views 
to be implemented in terms of efforts against drug trafficking. 
  [Robles] How do you view Latin American integration, its 
progress, and perspectives? 
  [Sanchez] Latin American integration is at a stage of 
complete development, seeking to consolidate its main mechanisms 
by reviewing and updating them. This new view includes a common 
perception on the viability of open regionalism, whereby 
countries that conform to different mechanisms will encounter 
fewer obstacles in negotiating with similar regional groups, 
thereby fulfilling the principal goal of overseeing Latin 
American regional integration, ensuring its flexibility, and 
seeking to include all of the nations in their unity proposal. 
  [Robles] Considering the priority that your government 
assigns to integration with its neighbors, could you give us 
your views in this regard? 
  [Sanchez] Bolivia attaches particular importance to regional 
and subregional integration, because it is believed that this 
policy will jointly promote the internal development of the 
member-countries and of the diverse economic coordination 
mechanisms. 
  [Robles] Mr. President, what means do you see for merging 
the 
existing subregional blocs into a vast integrated framework? 
Should this merger be based on pluralism? 
  [Sanchez] Undoubtedly, pluralism has become one of the key 
elements of Latin American integration. Since the creation of 
the Latin American Integration Association in 1980, our 
countries have considered the final goal of regional 
coordination policy to be the formation of a single continental 
bloc. This will be possible to the extent that democratic 
systems are consolidated in our countries, which supposes the 
active practice of pluralism, both internally within each 
country and in its foreign relations. 
  [Robles] What are the achievements, the biggest problems, 
and 
the tasks faced by your administration? How are you coping with 
the social problems faced by your government? 
  [Sanchez] My administration finds itself at a very 
significant point in Bolivia's history. The reforms we are 
implementing are of a structural nature. At this moment in 
time, we are focusing on the capitalization laws, the education 
reforms, and reforms dealing with the people's participation. 
Our final goal is to consolidate democracy, improve the 
Bolivian people's standard of living, and last, make tangible 
our desire to achieve the country's overall development. We are 
seeking all of this within a framework of a renewed concept of 
overall and sustained human development based on economic 
growth, social justice, participative democracy, respect of the 
environment, and international solidarity.
