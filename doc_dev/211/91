  [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada has ordered military troops to the streets and 
national highways to control public order and guarantee free 
transit, in view of possible road blockades by peasants. 
  The Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) has urged peasants to 
block roads, highways, and railroad tracks as of today to 
increase pressure on the government to yield to their salary 
demands. 
  Bolivian main cities were today under military control, 
while 
several military units were patrolling highways to stop peasants 
from complying with the COB appeal. 
  Although the government has expressed its willingness to 
negotiate with union leaders, it has warned that it is very 
difficult to amend the budget law which provides for an 8 
percent salary increase because "there is no flexibility in the 
allotment of resources." 
  Military and police officials have reported that all roads 
were cleared during the first 12 hours of the day; but they 
admitted that several roadblocks were set up at different 
locations. 
  However, Radio Fides in La Paz reported that peasants have 
complied with the COB instructions to block roads and railroad 
tracks. 
  Peasant Leader Juan de La Curz Villca asserted that about 
30,000 members of the coca leaf farmers union in the El Chapare 
region have set up roadblocks on the main highway linking 
Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. 
  Villca warned that the producers of coca leaves, a 
traditional product for Bolivian indigenous groups that is also 
the basic ingredient for manufacturing cocaine, have reported 
"they will not lift the roadblocks, not even under machine gun 
fire." 
  Union leader David Herrada asked the members of the Armed 
Forces and the police to join the blockade in Cochabamba. He 
said: "If we take another piece out of this neoliberal 
government it will also benefit the police and the Armed Forces, 
who also have low salaries, like the workers." 
  The prefect (governor) of Chuquisaca, Omar Montalvo, 
confirmed that the military unit patrolling Sucre and the access 
roads will break up any demonstration and prevent any road 
blockade. 
  A Sucre radio station reported that about 3,000 peasants 
closed roads in five of the 10 districts of Chuquisaca. 
  In addition some buses going to Potosi had problems in 
arriving in that city due to the blockades set up by the 
peasants. 
  Several military units have been deployed to other regions 
of 
the southern part of the country, where roads and railroad 
tracks were closed. 
  The FIDES news agency reported that in Camargo, in the 
southern part of the country, about 500 peasants prevented about 
100 cargo and passenger vehicles from passing, and that because 
of this a two-year-old girl "died from the very cold weather 
early this morning." 
  Some cargo and bus companies have suspended services while 
the strike ordered by the COB continues. 
  Despite the tense situation created by the presence of 
military troops on the streets and the road blockades, 
government officials and COB leaders are holding talks behind 
closed doors in an effort to find a solution to the crisis. 
  The appeal made by the COB to the Catholic Church to mediate 
in the conflict was rejected by Apostolic Nuncio Giovanni 
Tonnucci, who said that the church cannot mediate "among people 
who turn a deaf ear to dialogue."
