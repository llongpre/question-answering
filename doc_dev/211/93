  [Excerpts] The situation in the Armed Forces has been tense 
in the last few days as a result of the personnel reduction in 
the Armed Forces. Defense Minister Raul Tovar said that the 
comments made by General Moises Schiriqui Bejarano, Armed Forces 
chief of staff, were distorted. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Mario Espinoza] This report does 
not seek to increase a disagreement between the Armed Forces and 
the constitutionally established civilian government. The idea 
is to reflect what is happening between the Armed Forces and the 
executive branch. Today President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
arrived 40 minutes late to a ceremony prepared by his escort 
batallion. Furthermore, the issue of the reduction of personnel 
and economic resources in the Armed Forces has created concern 
not only because of the reaction of the Armed Forces chief of 
staff, as reported by an editorial in LA RAZON, but also because 
of how it was done, as if it were an answer to an offense 
against the Armed Forces which in reality never existed. This is 
why the comments of the defense minister also created concern 
when he said that the declarations of General Moises Schiriqui 
Bejarano have been distorted. 
  [Tovar] His comments were distorted. 
  [Espinoza] Does this mean that there are no disagreements 
between the Armed Forces and the civilian power? 
  [Tovar] No, there are no disagreements, absolutely none. 
There is complete respect for democracy. 
  [Espinoza] As far as we know, General Schiriqui never 
questioned the government's policy, in this case democracy. What 
is indeed under discussion is the possibility of a reduction of 
personnel and economic resources in the Armed Forces within the 
framework of the economic crisis affecting the country for the 
last few years. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  After President Sanchez de Lozada delivered his speech the 
impasse with the Armed Forces was overcome. President Sanchez de 
Lozada was very clear in the speech he made during the ceremony 
on the anniversary of the Colorados Regiment. 
  [Begin recording] [Espinoza] President Sanchez de Lozada, 
with the Constitution in his hands, reminded the Armed Forces of 
their constitutional role of guaranteeing the stability of the 
legally established government and of cooperating in the overall 
development of the country. 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] The Armed Forces have the basic role of 
defending and maintaining national independence [words 
indistinct], and the honor and national sovereignty, insuring 
the reign of the Constitution, guaranteeing the stability of the 
legally established government, and cooperating in the overall 
development of the country. This is the government policy, this 
is the government guideline [words indistinct]. 
  [Espinoza] President Sanchez de Lozada said there is not, 
nor 
will there be, any policy that does not benefit the nation and 
this includes the Armed Forces because when a country grows, its 
Armed Forces also grow. 
  [Sanchez de Lozada in progress] a stronger institution, 
better prepared to fulfill its constitutional duties, and to 
represent, and defend our country. [words indistinct] 
  [Espinoza] The president believes there are no poor 
countries 
with great Armed Forces and that the current effort is to 
strengthen the national economy and society, to educate the 
people, to watch over their health, and also to appropriate 
resources to have a strong Armed Forces. In the afternoon, the 
president summoned the high military command to explain the 
government policy regarding the Armed Forces. Then Armed Forces 
Commander General Fernando Sanjinez referred to the presidential 
speech. 
  [Sanjinez] We are very pleased with the speech delivered by 
the president this morning. We are really very pleased with his 
speech. 
  [Espinoza] Apparently the situation is now clearer. There 
was 
undoubtedly a moment of confrontation but following the meeting 
the situation is completely normal. [end recording]
