<F P=106> [Article by "special correspondents" Roque Gonzalez Vera, </F>
Hilarion Acosta, and Jorge Caceres] 
  [Text] Formosa, Argentina -- Argentina, Paraguay, and 
Bolivia have decided "at the highest level" to give the highest 
priority to the handling and solution of all matters pertaining 
to the Pilcomayo River, and they also decided to establish that 
the carrying out of any tasks, both at the technical and 
environmental levels, will be carried out in coordination with 
the three countries' proper organizations. 
  The tripartite decision to act "as one body" in the solution 
to the technical, political, and environmental problems 
curiously does not contain the manner in which the financial 
resources will be obtained to carry out the scheduled tasks in 
the lower basin, which is shared by Argentina and Paraguay, and 
the middle and upper basins, which are in Bolivian territory. 
  [Argentine President Carlos] Menem, [Paraguayan President 
Juan Carlos] Wasmosy, and [Bolivian President Gonzalo] Sanchez 
de Lozada, together with their foreign ministers and chief 
technicians, met for six hours in this provincial capital to 
discuss a common action policy for the Pilcomayo River. 
  The governors of Formosa, Salta, and Jujuy Provinces 
(Vicente 
Joga, Roberto Ulloa, and Oscar Perassi) also participated in the 
meeting. 
  The Declaration of Formosa signed by the presidents 
indicates 
the need to ensure an equitable distribution of the river's 
waters in its lower reaches in Argentina and Paraguay, and in 
this respect it urges that "the immediate action that already 
has been decided on has the objective of re-establishing the 
equal flow of the water that enters the territories of the two 
countries, mainly to attenuate the process of damage and 
clogging and to prevent an abrupt change in the river's course 
at the points listed as critical." 
  The presidents also decided to include the middle and upper 
basins in the work plans that are to be carried out; therefore, 
they decided to "hasten the studies regarding the third phase of 
the project for the multiple development of the Pilcomayo's 
basin with the intention of implementing a program for the 
overall management of said basin taking into account the 
intensive erosion of the upper basin, the control of the flow, 
and the rational use of the waters." 
  The Argentine, Paraguayan, and Bolivian Governments decided 
to promote the development of the Pilcomayo's basin and its area 
of influence in order to optimize the exploitation of its 
natural resources, create jobs with the attraction of 
investment, and allow the rational use of its hydraulic 
resources. 
  In order to help this development, the chiefs of state 
agreed 
to the creation of a "tripartite commission for the development 
of the Pilcomayo's basin," and instructed their foreign 
ministers to sign the respective agreement as soon as possible. 
  During the news conference they gave, Wasmosy revealed that 
this commission will be made up of six members (two from each 
country) and will have an executive secretary, who will be 
contracted in another country, possibly a European country. 
  Finally, the presidents expressed the concern of their 
governments regarding the protection of the environment, and 
said they will support action "directed at sustained development 
that will necessarily include the implementation of 
environmental protection policies with an eye to preventing the 
region's environmental deterioration." 
  During the news conference in the Turismo Hotel's Blue Room 
after the signing of the joint declaration, Menem said: "If 
anyone is demanding indemnification for damages, then the first 
thing he has to do is demonstrate that the accused party is 
responsible. This is a basic fact in law." With these words, 
the Argentine president rejected Argentine responsibility for 
the damage that is being suffered by our country due to the 
opening of the channel [from the Pilcomayo into Argentine 
territory]. 
  Menem, who remained fairly calm until he was asked if the 
Pozo Hondo-Mision La Paz bridge is to be considered 
indemnification for Paraguay, added: "If they are accusing 
Argentina of causing damage then they have to demonstrate that 
we are responsible for the waters not entering the neighboring 
country and that we are to blame. It is true that I do not know 
who is to blame in this matter because the two countries agreed 
to the opening of channels. We opened a channel, but it seems 
that the Paraguayans did not open theirs correctly." 
  The Argentine president emphasized that they are willing to 
cooperate. But "we will not accept a responsibility that is not 
ours," he said. To prove these remarks about cooperation, Menem 
confirmed that the construction of the Pozo Hondo-Mision La Paz 
bridge over the Pilcomayo will begin immediately. This bridge 
will allow a road connection with Salta Province and will mean 
the physical linking of the Atlantic with the Pacific through 
the Paraguayan Chaco. 
  He indicated that the Formosa Province Government headed by 
Vicente Joga has received instructions to begin the work as soon 
as possible. "The bridge has to be finished by the end of the 
year, which is when the rains start and the river begins to 
rise," he said. 
  When Menem finished speaking, Wasmosy took over, saying: "I 
do not want to go into details and predict who is to blame and 
who is not. My intention is to look at the positive and 
constructive factors, and the positive aspect is that there 
exists the political desire of the three countries, interpreting 
the feelings of their peoples, to apply a rational and equitable 
solution to this problem." 
  With these words the Paraguayan president is practically 
rejecting the possibility of requesting that Argentina pay 
indemnification for the damage that has been caused, as though 
two years without receiving a drop of water and another year of 
receiving it in drops are not a sufficient argument to face this 
problem in a responsible way. 
  Regarding this point, it must be recalled that in 1991 
Paraguay and Argentina did agree to the opening of experimental 
channels. On schedule and on the agreed date the Argentines 
opened their channel, but the Paraguayan technicians arrived 15 
days later and, to top everything else, opened a channel against 
the river's current as though the river could reverse its 
current. Colorado Party politician Juan Roque Galeano was then 
director of the National Pilcomayo Commission, and he should be 
put on trial to determine his responsibility in the loss of our 
sovereignty. 
  But this negligence does not exonerate our neighbor from his 
responsibility. The agreement called for the opening of a pilot 
channel, but their technicians brought in bulldozers and opened 
a channel with a depth not contemplated in the agreement. And 
this flatly points to bad faith. They also promised to close 
the channel, and in September 1993 Menem stressed that Paraguay 
would receive the same amount of water as Argentina by the end 
of 1993, but that is still in his dreams so far. 
  And this is not all. Argentine technicians and geologists 
had perfect knowledge of a subterranean geological structure 
that cuts the Pilcomayo perpendicularly, thus causing a tilt 
toward Argentine territory. Formosa Province waited for the 
sediment to reach that point and it was there that it opened 
"the tap" that is very difficult to close today. If there had 
been good will, concern to prevent the closure of the river's 
bed would have been expressed much sooner and not when Paraguay 
is facing a de facto situation that will be very difficult to 
reverse. 
  During the news conference and regarding the channel's 
closure, Menem again promised that the work will have top 
priority "as scheduled by Paraguayan technicians. I again 
repeat that Argentina will not receive one drop more than 
Paraguay. We are going to achieve an equitable distribution of 
the Pilcomayo, as it should be between brother countries." 
  Referring to costs, Menem explained that constructing the 
dam 
on the Pilcomayo at the site of the two countries' channels will 
cost $18 million and these funds already have been obtained in 
Europe. The dam that has been planned in the area of Villa 
Montes, Bolivia, will cost $300 million. The Argentine 
president reaffirmed that the bridge's construction and the 
channel's closing will be finished before the end of the year, 
and only then will the other scheduled works be carried out. 
  Asked by ABC COLOR's special correspondents on his country's 
participation in the financing of the works on the upper reaches 
of the Pilcomayo, Sanchez de Lozada said: "If Bolivia does not 
participate in the seeking of solutions, the Pilcomayo will die. 
We have a large responsibility in this matter because the river 
starts in our territory." 
  The Bolivian president flatly denied press agency reports 
datelined La Paz that reported an alleged negative response to 
committing his country to international financing for the work 
to be carried out on the Pilcomayo. "It is absolutely not true 
that Bolivia refuses to contract debts. We form a team together 
with Paraguay and Argentina in which each party has a determined 
quota of sacrifice. We have given top priority to the river, 
and we look at it as a system that must be protected," he said. 
  It is important to point out that the Bolivian president 
acknowledged that his country has always traditionally 
considered the Pilcomayo to be a Paraguayan-Argentine concern 
and that it has not implemented any direct action because it is 
not directly affected by the silting up of the river. 
  "Bolivia stopped looking at the Pilcomayo as something 
foreign because its fate also affects us. The river poses a 
tremendous environmental challenge because the consequences can 
be extraordinary. And it must be taken into account that the 
environmental damage can cost much more than the investment 
being projected." 
  The presidential news conference was delayed due to changes 
made in the joint declaration. The meeting with some 100 
journalists from the three countries and international agencies 
was held in the Turismo Hotel's Blue Room. 
  During the conference, Wasmosy highlighted the political 
will 
of the three countries to implement measures to save the river 
from its imminent disappearance. He also emphasized the 
region's environmental importance and the need to preserve it. 
He also confirmed the creation of a technical commission to be 
made up of technicians from the three countries. 
  A neutral expert will be contracted for the post of 
executive 
secretary, preferably someone who is an expert in hydraulic and 
environmental matters. "It will be someone who has nothing to 
do with the interests of each country, in order to obtain the 
most just solutions and alternatives," Wasmosy said.
