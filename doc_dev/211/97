  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has also 
commented on the clashes that occurred in Chapare. During a 
news conference, the president commented on the drug trafficking 
issue. He said Bolivia and his administration are coexisting 
with a time bomb because Law 1008 obliges the government to 
eradicate 1 hectare of coca for every cocaine maceration pit 
that is found. He said this is the cause of the problems. 
  [Begin Sanchez de Lozada recording] This causes the problem: 
We have been finding large production centers of cocaine base, 
which is purchased by the main cocaine producers who transform 
this base into cocaine. This concerns us. [end recording] 
  Asked if his administration will defend coca production, he 
said: 
  [Begin recording] Of course we will defend it. Coca is part 
of our society. It is a consumer product, but we cannot protect 
coca production in the Chapare region where it is grown 
exclusively for drug production, for cocaine production. You 
know very well that if you offer Chapare coca leaves to miners, 
they will refuse to chew them. Miners and peasants only chew 
coca grown in Yungas. This, however, is no reason to simply 
eradicate this coca and fill our country with violence. We must 
find solutions to this problem and these solutions can only be 
found through dialogue. Pressure from abroad is great and 
domestic damage is also great. We cannot forget that Bolivia is 
already beginning to have (addicts) and drug consumption 
problems. Cocaine base is a very bad drug. [end recording]
