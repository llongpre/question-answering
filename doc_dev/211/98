A FORMER military dictator, a mining tycoon, a brewing magnate and a TV talk
show host were the main candidates tussling for votes yesterday in Bolivian
presidential elections.
Expectations of a big turnout were thwarted by a series of last-minute
administrative problems such as a lack of voting slips in the city of Santa
Cruz. Voting in a substantial number of areas has been delayed until next
Sunday.
But while oxygen may have been in short supply at the 12 de Octubre polling
station in the poor El Alto township above La Paz which, at 13,000 feet,
claims to be the world's highest voting booth, enthusiasm for democracy was
not.
Swarms of people queued to vote, the women in their distinctive bowler hats,
embroidered shawls and multi-layered skirts. Most did not seem to care who
won, enjoying instead the power of voting in their third election since 1985
in a country until recently so riddled by coups that it was considered the
most unstable in Latin America.
Waiting to cast his vote, Mr Vladimir Benita, a stallholder, said: 'It's
important that we vote so that we get a good government. We're proud to be a
democracy after so many years of dictatorship.' There were some dissenting
voices. Mr Zairo Villasuelo, a carpenter, said: 'I wouldn't vote if it
wasn't compulsory. Politicians are all corrupt.'
These are the first Bolivian elections to be held under an independent
electoral court, and President Jaime Paz Zamora said yesterday that
Bolivians should be proud of the most transparent elections in the country's
history. However, there were charges of fraud due to a surge in the number
of registered voters to 2.4m against less than 2m in 1989, and the Santa
Cruz problems led some candidates to demand a new election.
Fourteen parties were fielding candidates, but the real fight was between Mr
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, 62, from the main opposition party and General
Hugo Banzer, 67, a former military dictator and now the rightist candidate
of the ruling party. US-educated Mr De Lozada owns the country's biggest
private mining company and, as planning minister from 1985 to 1989, fathered
a stabilisation plan which reduced inflation from 26,000 per cent to just 15
per cent.
There was little difference in their campaign platforms, both favouring a
continuation of the austerity programme.
The last opinion poll put Mr De Lozada slightly ahead, but no one was
expected to secure a majority. This would leave the balance with Mr Max
Fernandez, the brewing magnate, and Mr Carlos Palenque, the talk show host.
Under Bolivia's electoral system the candidate with the most votes may not
win, as Mr De Lozada learnt in 1989 when he topped the polls but was not
named president. The decision rests with Congress, which holds a secret vote
in August.
