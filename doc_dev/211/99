  [Text] On 8 April, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
admitted the country's "major dependency" on foreign power 
factors that have an impact on various Bolivian fields that 
cannot change from one day to the next without placing financial 
stability at risk. 
  In his speech during the main ceremony to mark the 42d 
anniversary of the national revolution, Sanchez de Lozada said: 
"Our dependency is on the IMF, the IDB [Inter-American 
Development Bank], and the U.S. Embassy, which tell us what we 
can and cannot do. And this is due to our weakness, but I want 
to tell you that what this government is doing is to go beyond 
what we are told to do." 
  Before an auditorium full of supporters, the chief of state 
asked the country for patience by pointing out that the major 
reforms will take some time to yield results because the 
government is determined to carry out a third revolution in 
democracy, "free of violence and shots... but with measures as 
important as those of the 1952 National Revolution and those 
that allowed the stabilization of our economy in 1985." 
  Addressing his political allies in the government, he asked 
them to get rid of susceptibilities and, above all, the idea 
that the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] might 
disappear some day. He stated: "I am a businessman and my 
businesses and partners do well and each one has their separate 
share; the people are our common business now." 
  But he also warned the MNR that it would be disastrous to 
try 
to be a hegemonic party again because when this happens "one 
loses touch with reality and infighting starts, which is 
something the party already has experienced in the past. 
Competition is better than hegemony." 
  Regarding the opposition, he said that many parties 
disappeared because they believed in dogmas and myths and others 
because they let pragmatism prevail over their principles. 
  He also devoted several minutes of his speech to the reforms 
his government upholds. He said he intends to consolidate what 
the MNR started during the six times it came to power since 1952 
and project this work into the future. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said: "Capitalization, the peoples' 
participation, the education system's reform, and sustained 
development fall within the MNR's much-desired objective to 
consolidate the national state with social justice." 
  The capitalization project seeks to rescue the public 
enterprises to prevent them from the same fate as COMIBOL 
[Mining Corporation of Bolivia]. He added that it is not only 
an economic measure but also a social one because it is designed 
to redistribute wealth. 
  He said the peoples' participation project is a 500-year-old 
debt that is being honored because it will give the people 
economic and political power. It will allow a fair distribution 
of wealth according to the population, which means that a person 
from La Paz will have the same status as a person from Pando and 
a person from Potosi will be the same as a person from Santa 
Cruz. Let's hope it will work because the future of new 
generations is tied to the project's success.
