   Six sets of remains that may be
those of missing American servicemen were flown to the United
States on Thursday after a U.S. honor guard saluted and Buddhist
monks prayed to console the dead.
   It was the first time since the Vietnam War ended in April 1975
that Communist authorities in Cambodia have delivered suspected
remains of those missing in action, or MIA.
   ``The United States appreciates the support of the Phnom Penh
authorities for this undertaking,'' said Lt. Col. Thomas Boyd, a
U.S. spokesman. ``We consider this an important humanitarian
undertaking which, if successful, will help to alleviate the
suffering of American families.''
   Cambodia is ready to cooperate with future American MIA
missions, the official news agency SPK on Thursday quoted the
deputy interior minister, Khim Ponn, as saying. He heads an MIA
commission formed last month to cooperate with local officials in
the MIA search.
   U.S. officials had accused the Vietnamese-backed government,
which the United States does not recognize, of using the issue to
exact political concessions.
   An appeal this year by Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., broke the
deadlock.
   Also, Washington announced a week ago that it was withdrawing
recognition of the Khmer Rouge-dominated guerrilla coalition that
is fighting Phnom Penh, and would open talks with Vietnam on ending
the Cambodian civil war. Sources in Washington said Secretary of
State James A. Baker III favors opening talks with Phnom Penh as
the next step.
   The 14-member military team flew to Phnom Penh for the airport
repatriation ceremony.
   Buddhist monks in saffron robes chanted prayers in Pali during a
15-minute memorial service before an altar covered with flowers and
burning incense. The six caskets sat behind the altar, and a monk
sprinkled holy water to bless the dead and speed their rebirth.
   The American military honor guard escorted six aluminum caskets,
each draped with a U.S. flag, on board an Air Force C-141 that took
off for Hawaii.
   In Hawaii, the remains will be analyzed and identified by the
Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the Army Central
Identification Laboratory, agencies that account for America's
wartime missing.
   A total of 2,300 Americans are listed as missing in action in
Indochina. Aside from the 83 in Cambodia, 1,678 are missing in
Vietnam, 533 in Laos and six in China's coastal waters. At least
eight American civilians are also listed as missing in Cambodia,
according to U.S. officials.
   The six remains were among 28 sets that Cambodian authorities
said they have recovered in recent years. A Foreign Ministry
spokesman said his government paid $2,000 for the return of some
remains from remote provinces.
   Six U.S. military specialists examined them in a tiny laboratory
at Cambodia's only medical college on Tuesday and Wednesday, and
decided that six warranted further tests. The team was the first
known official U.S. contact with the Phnom Penh government.
   Two of the six remains that were repatriated were found in
eastern provinces bordering Vietnam. U.S. planes heavily bombed the
area during the war in failed attempts to interdict the Ho Chi Minh
Trail, Communist North Vietnam's main supply route to U.S.-backed
South Vietnam.
   U.S. officials said most of the American servicemen missing in
Cambodia were airmen.
   The other four sets were from Choeung Ek, a southwest suburb of
Phnom Penh that the Khmer Rouge used as a mass execution ground
when they ruled from 1975 to 1978. The Khmer Rouge were ousted
after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978.
   Boyd said Washington would consider sending another such team to
examine more remains, but added that this was not discussed during
his group's visit to Phnom Penh.
