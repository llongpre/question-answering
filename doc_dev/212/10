   Outgoing President Oscar Arias said
Central America should be demilitarized because the region's
limited resources should be spent on tractors instead of tanks.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Arias on Wednesday
also criticized what he called U.S. efforts to hinder fulfillment
of a regional peace plan he drafted in 1987 with the help of other
Central American leaders.
   Arias, who hands power Tuesday to Rafael Calderon, was awarded
the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for authoring the 1987 peace accord. It
was seen as crucial to ending Nicaragua's civil war and promoting
elections in February in Nicaragua. The U.S.-backed opposition won
the vote.
   ``The decade of the '90s must be the decade of disarmament if we
want greater development,'' said Arias, a Social Democrat whose
country is the only Latin American nation with no armed forces.
   ``There is no other way,'' he said while being driven to a
ceremony at a cattle breeding center outside San Jose. ``The gap
between the rich northern nations and the poor southern ones
continues to widen. Rich countries' commitments to poor countries
are not increasing, so we must depend more on internal savings. We
must dedicate our resources to the satisfaction of our peoples'
needs and not to buying arms.
   ``Costa Rica is the best example. Costa Rica buys tractors while
the rest of Central America buys tanks. The tractors produce food.
The tanks do not.'' He praised the plan of the new Panamanian
government to abolish the army in favor of a civilian-controlled
police force.
   ``I'm pushing that,'' he said.
   Arias said he had planned to teach at Harvard University for a
couple years upon returning to private life but was persuaded by
friends, including former President Jimmy Carter, to continue
promoting peace.
   He said he will dedicate himself to working for the Arias
Foundation for Peace and Human Progress.
   ``There is no greater satisfaction for a human being than being
able to contribute to ending war,'' Arias said.
   ``My experience, my condition as Nobel laureate, as author of
the Central American peace plan will perhaps permit me to help, to
contribute my grain of sand.''
   Of U.S. resistance to his peace plan, Arias said: ``Every time I
spoke with a U.S. functionary it was for that person to tell me
`Look. This isn't working. This is bad. Pull back. Why don't you,
the author, declare that the peace plan is washed up?'
   ``So that they could continue their little Central American
war.''
   He continued: ``The relationship between the war and drug
trafficking did not matter to anyone. Here a horrible cynicism was
put into play. There was a double standard in everything. On one
hand they were saying drugs were the biggest threat to Central
America and that anybody who got involved in drugs must be punished.
   ``But they closed their eyes when those who were helping the
Contras, fomenting war, dealt drugs. And they were on the payroll.''
   Arias provided no hard evidence to support the allegation,
previously made from other quarters, that U.S. officials supporting
the anti-Sandinista rebels dealt in or condoned dealing drugs.
   ``History will take it upon itself to reveal that this was
indeed the case, and that each one receives his just punishment,''
Arias said.
   The president, who met Monday with a delegation of Salvadoran
guerrilla commanders, predicted the civil war in El Salvador will
end this year.
   Asked what he considered his legacy to Central America, Arias
said: ``To have achieved that, for the first time in many many
years, the people of Central America today all live under
democratic systems.
   ``Also, to have appealed to the sensibility of our people to
silence the weapons.''
