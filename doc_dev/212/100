<LEADPARA>  ON NOV. 5, President Bush signed HR 5114, the Foreign Operations, Export
Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1991 -- that is, the
overall U.S. foreign aid bill. But he said he planned to ignore certain parts
of the law, particularly Section 562A.;    That section ordered the Agency of
International Development, the dispenser of much American aid, to assess the
needs of "all the people of Cambodia" in distributing $20 million in aid to
that broken country. The wording seems innocent enough, and God knows the 8
million people of Cambodia need all the help they can get after 21 years of
war, horror and economic sanctions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But the president has no intention of doing anything for the 8 million, who
have been subject for 12 years to a government put in place by Vietnam after
the Vietnamese army drove the murderous Khmer Rouge from power and into the
mountainous jungles along Cambodia's frontier with Thailand. From there, with
families and support facilities in refugee camps on the Thai side of the
border, the Khmer Rouge is continuing a civil war against the Phnom Penh
government.;    There are 300,000 Cambodians up there, an estimated 36,000 of
them soldiers in communist Khmer Rouge combat units, in political and military
coalition with 13,000 other soldiers attached to groupings called the
"Non-Communist Resistance." Those 300,000 get American "humanitarian" aid --
roads, trucks, fuel, food, hospitals and even boots useful to the Khmer Rouge
and NCR troops in what we have designated as the "Liberated Zone" on the
Cambodian side of the border.;    This is no secret in Cambodia or Thailand.
"I have to feed the military, clothe the military," said an important American
official there. "That's my job; that's why I'm here.";    So it is. He is
following the president's orders, which were clearly restated when Bush signed
the Foreign Operations Act: "I have no objection to sending an AID team to
certain areas along the Thai-Cambodian border, and from there that team can
gather information about the considerations along the border and in Cambodia
itself.";    Leaving aside the fact that once again the U.S. Congress is
revealed as an impotent national joke, making laws that the president feels
comfortable in ignoring, there is nothing but jungle to be seen from the Thai
border in the northwest.;    Most of the people of Cambodia live, very badly,
in the southern parts. A few million dollars in hard currency spent there for
food, medicine and well-drilling rigs to pump clean water would literally save
the lives of thousands and thousands of women and children.;    But U.S.
humanitarian aid in Southeast Asia has nothing to do with saving lives. It
does not have much to do with our public devotion to an ongoing United Nations
peace process and elections in Cambodia. Nor does it even have much to do with
our traditional goal of fighting communism, since both the Khmer Rouge and the
government in Phnom Penh are communist.;    So why is the president of the
United States using American taxpayers' money in a mini-geopolitical game that
could lead to the revival of the most murderous regime of modern times, the
Khmer Rouge?;    There are three reasons:;    (check) A cadre of U.S.
officials in Washington, and the president seems to be one of them, are still
fighting the war in Vietnam. Our gripe with Cambodia is that it was invaded
and occupied until two years ago by the Vietnamese. Once we thought we could
save Vietnam by destroying it. Now we think we can save it by destroying
Cambodia.;    (check) We seem to be incapable of following any policy that
might offend China. The Chinese and the Vietnamese are ancient rivals and
Beijing is the true patron of the Khmer Rouge, supplying the tanks that Khmer
Rouge battalions in American boots hope to drive down American-built roads to
Phnom Penh.;    (check) The United States, in the words of one American
official I interviewed, must have "a seat at the table" when the fate of
Cambodia is finally decided in war or at a U.N. peace conference. This
administration lives in terror that our status as a superpower might be
compromised by regional decision-making in Europe, the Middle East or
Southeast Asia.;    George Bush does not want the Khmer Rouge back in power
any more than he wants Iran running what used to be Iraq. But he is willing to
gamble our money and their lives that our games will not lead to more
Cambodian killing fields. If he miscalculates, so be it. Our casualties will
be low to none. The people killed, once again, will only be Cambodians. And,
with luck, a few Vietnamese, too.  </TEXT>
