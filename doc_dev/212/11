PACT OFFERS CAMBODIANS A WAY OUT -- BUT ONE
DANGER, THE KHMER ROUGE, REMAINS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The agreement outlines a U.N.-supervised demobilization, a proportionate
electoral system and United Nations oversight of key ministries. Politically,
the structure seems sound; the danger lies in paving the way back to
legitimacy of the Khmer Rouge.;   The Khmer Rouge will return to Phnom Penh
before the year's end, running candidates for national assembly seats.;  
After four years of Maoist-inspired terrorist rule that killed from 1 million
to 3 million Cambodians, the Khmer Rouge were ousted in 1979. Upon the
guerrillas' insistence, the peace pact has watered down a reference to Khmer
Rouge genocide, and mentions only a future need to prevent the recurrence of
recent practices.;   Though of little regional significance itself, Cambodia
two decades ago suffered the misfortune of being engulfed in the conflict
raging next door in Vietnam. The United States secretly bombed it, its prince
was overthrown, its people were murdered and infrastructure was destroyed by a
mad regime. After the war ended in Vietnam, Cambodia was occupied by
Vietnamese troops, and is still beset by civil war.;   Keys to the peace talks
were warming U.S.-Soviet relations and the subsequent rapprochement between
China and Vietnam, prime sponsors of the Cambodian combatants. The United
States, another supplier of the guerrillas, belatedly has shifted its
wrongheaded policy, and is talking directly with the government in Phnom
Penh.;   Twenty years of war in Cambodia have proven nothing. It's time to end
the proxy antagonism.  </TEXT>
