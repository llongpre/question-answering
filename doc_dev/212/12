<HEAD>Baker: No Agreement Yet on Afghanistan</HEAD>

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
on Thursday sought to dampen speculation that a settlement of the
Afghan civil war is imminent, said officials traveling with him.
   He made his remarks on the flight from Washington before he
arrived in Jakarta on the first leg of a four-nation swing through
Asia.
   U.S. officials quoted Baker as telling reporters on the flight
that the United States had not yet reached agreement with the
Soviet Union on Afghanistan.
   ``There's no agreement on Afghanistan. It's a product of the
rumor mill,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Prior to Baker's departure, U.S. officials had indicated the
secretary of state would try to clear the remaining roadblocks to a
cease-fire in Afghanistan during the trip.
   They said Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, who are to meet Aug. 1 meeting in Irkutsk, Soviet
Siberia, would discuss a timetable for Afghanistan's President
Najibullah to step down.
   ``The Soviets hinted at a deal; they haven't fleshed it out,''
said an administration official Tuesday on condition of anonymity.
``The thread of the deal is going to be pursued in Irkutsk by
Baker.''
   ABC News had said earlier this week that Shevardnadze and Baker
already had made a deal to end the Afghan civil war, but the
administration official disputed that report.
   The Bush administration has been hoping for a breakthrough to
end the war between Afghan government forces armed by the Soviet
Union and a guerrilla coalition fighting with American-supplied
weapons funneled through Pakistan.
   The Soviets have not yet told the United States how Najibullah
might be removed from power in Kabul, said the administration
official.
   The Soviet Union installed the Najibullah government in 1979,
but the government in Kabul has been unable to impose its will on
the countryside. The Soviets withdrew their troops last year but
continue to supply arms.
   In Indonesia, Baker will attend a meeting of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations on Friday and Saturday.
   ASEAN said in a statement Wednesday that a change in Cambodia's
representation in the United Nations would hurt the search for
peace in Indochina. Last week, the United States withdrew its
recognition of the guerrilla coalition that holds Cambodia's U.N.
General Assembly seat.
   Baker was quoted as telling reporters on the plane that the
change of U.S. policy on Cambodia was ``an example of our need to
adjust to new circumstances.''
   Washington also announced last week it would open talks with
Vietnam on a settlement in Cambodia and would no longer support the
right of the guerrilla coalition to represent Phnom Penh in the
world body.
   Those steps could open the way to a broader rapprochement
between the United States and Hanoi, shifting the balance of power
in Southeast Asia. Hanoi supports the Cambodian govenment.
   U.S. officials said the policy shift was designed to prevent the
Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the three guerrilla groups, from
gaining power in Cambodia. The Communist Khmer Rouge took power in
1975 and slaughtered hundreds of thousands of civilians before
being ousted by Vietnam in 1978.
   Later in the Asian trip, Baker will hold talks in Singapore and
visit Outer Mongolia.
