  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday urged ASEAN 
countries to take a unified stand against foreign interference 
in the Cambodian civil war. 
  "ASEAN is in a good position to voice opposition to any 
foreign interference in Cambodia's internal affairs and to 
oppose foreign (arms) assistance to any of the Cambodian 
parties," he said. 
  King Sihanouk said last week that foreign military 
assistance 
to the Cambodian government might be the only way to end the war 
with the Khmer Rouge. 
  An Australian government official said in Canberra on Friday 
that the Phnom Penh government had approached Australia, the 
United States, France and "some ASEAN countries" for weapons. 
  The six-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) 
comprises Thailand, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines 
and Singapore. Thailand has repeatedly warned against outside 
interference in Cambodia's affairs. 
  Chuan reiterated yesterday that his government preferred a 
nonmilitary solution to the conflict. The seemingly endless war 
would only be fuelled further by fresh supplies of weapons, and 
this would have a direct affect on Thailand, he added. However, 
the prime minister opined it was the Cambodian government's 
"sovereign right to ask for a foreign arms supply". 
  Thailand, smarting under allegations it denies that it still 
supports the Khmer Rouge, has been unsuccessful in previous 
attempts to convince its ASEAN partners of the need for a 
unified stand against foreign interference in Cambodia. 
  Despite well-earned world praise for ASEAN's earlier 
cohesiveness in policies towards Cambodia, a meeting of senior 
officials from the six nations in Thailand last month could not 
reach a consensus on the situation there. 
  Phnom Penh will be invited as a special guest to the annual 
ASEAN meetings to be held in Bangkok in July, when the situation 
in Cambodia will be a topic of concern. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday urged 
France and Indonesia, as co-chairmen of the Paris Peace 
Conference, to call for consultations among all 19 signatories 
to the Paris peace agreement on the question of foreign arms 
supplies. They include the US, France and Australia. 
  "The issue now is that even Western arms suppliers have no 
consensus on whether to supply arms to Cambodia," Surin told 
reporters upon his return from Saudi Arabia.
