<LEADPARA>  A conference to end Cambodia's 12-year-old civil war remained deadlocked today
over the key issues of elections and disarmament, but a compromise on human
rights abuses was reached, the chief mediator said.;   Prince Norodom Sihanouk
said Cambodia's warring factions would tackle the outstanding issues during
today's final session. But he said it appeared unlikely the talks would
produce a comprehensive peace package.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The civil war has pitted the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh
against three allied guerrilla groups: the Khmer Rouge, followers of Sihanouk
and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front. The sides are all
participating in talks at this seaside resort.;   A breakdown in negotiations
could jeopardize a fragile cease-fire that took effect in June. Violations
have been reported by all parties.;   Sihanouk told reporters at the end of
this morning's session that the Phnom Penh side had agreed to drop its
insistence that references to "genocide" be included in a human rights
statement accompanying the peace document.;   Such a reference has been
strongly opposed by the Khmer Rouge, which slaughtered hundreds of thousands
of people during the mid-1970s and was branded one of the most murderous
regimes in modern times. The Khmer Rouge were ousted by a Vietnamese invasion
in late 1978 but kept fighting from strongholds along the Thai-Cambodian
border.;   A senior Khmer Rouge official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said today that Vietnam and China, the group's key backer, had pressured the
factions to compromise.;   The growing rapprochement between Beijing and Hanoi
is seen as conducive to a peace settlement in Cambodia.;   Disputes remained
over the key issue of disarming military forces, however.;   The Khmer Rouge
insists that Phnom Penh's special "A-3" police force be subject to an
agreement to reduce all armies by 70 percent. Cambodia's premier, Hun Sen,
said today the police were not a military force and should be excluded.;  
Sihanouk said the Cambodians would consult later today with Maj. Gen. Timothy
Dubuama, the leader of a U.N. team that recently toured Cambodia to determine
how best to monitor a cease-fire.;   The Phnom Penh side also opposes adopting
an electoral system of proportional representation as called for in the U.N.
plan.;   Sihanouk said today he would send a letter to U.N. Secretary-general
Javier Perez de Cuellar requesting help in rebuilding war-torn Cambodia.  </TEXT>
