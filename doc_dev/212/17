  [Text] Today is the second day of negotiations between the 
Cambodian Government and Khmer Rouge in Pyongyang. The meeting, 
scheduled to last until 31 May and chaired by King Norodom 
Sihanouk, is aimed at putting an end to the killing among 
Cambodians and finding ways to form a national reconciliation 
government to rule the country. Meanwhile, the United States, 
Australia, and France, in another part of the world, are 
considering sending weapons to Cambodia to prolong the massacre 
in that country. 
  We wish to appeal to all world powers to think carefully 
before sending weapons and military assistance to help the 
Cambodian Government fight the Khmer Rouge. It is not difficult 
to decide to send arms and assistance to Cambodia. However, it 
might be impossible to completely wipe out the Khmer Rouge. 
Hence, sending weapons and assistance to Cambodia is tantamount 
to fanning the flames of war which is a mistake the major powers 
could make in their attempt to solve the Cambodian problem. 
  Judging from the remarks of Thomas Hubbard, U.S. deputy 
assistant secretary of state; and Kent Weidemann, U.S. assistant 
secretary of defense, after their visit to Phnom Pehn and 
consultative meetings with Thai ministers, we feel that the two 
U.S. officials, whose mission was to write a report to help the 
U.S. Government make a final decision, are worried that the 
Phnom Penh Government, without external support, will not be 
able to resist the Khmer Rouge's massive offensive and that the 
country will fall into Khmer Rouge hands. 
  We have a solution to the problem. The Thai people and 
Government believe that the major powers and the international 
community are capable of ending the war in Cambodia this very 
moment by making the two factions recognize each other and form 
a national reconciliation government to rule the country so that 
they can solve all problems at the negotiating table instead of 
fighting an endless war using lives, blood, flesh, and the agony 
of the people as their stakes. 
  Following the stormy accusations made by the Cambodian 
Government about Thai support for the Khmer Rouge, we, the mass 
media, have noticed a decline, to a certain extent, in the Thai 
Government's credibility in this regard. So effective are the 
fabrications, that the United States, France, and Australia are 
induced to give assistance to the Phnom Penh government. We 
wish to remind the United States that a genuine solution to the 
Cambodian problem must include the end of the war and mutual 
recognition among the Cambodian factions. So, the United States 
must think carefully before doing anything. 
  The United States must not miss the opportunity to exploit 
the new expanding market in this region with a total population 
of 350 million. If the international community sets the 
ultimatum for national reconciliation and the end of fighting in 
Cambodia, we do not believe that the Khmer Rouge will be crazy 
enough to risk fighting the war to gain full control of Cambodia 
because it will surely face something it deserves.
