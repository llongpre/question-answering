   Prime Minister Hun Sen on Sunday
said a full-scale civil war can be averted if other nations stop
arming the guerrillas once Vietnam withdraws its troops from
Cambodia.
   He said at a news conference that bloodshed is inevitable after
the Vietnamese forces backing his government are gone, but that the
level of fighting depends on foreign aid to the insurgents.
   Officials on both sides of the conflict have predicted new
offensives by the guerrillas after this week's withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops.
   Hun Sen also said that his troops still control Pailin, a
gem-mining region near the Thai border reported under intense
attack by the Khmer Rouge, the strongest group in the three-member
guerrilla coalition.
   Defense Minister Tea Banh acknowledged Saturday that the Khmer
Rouge now control some territory near Pailin.
   Vietnam, which invaded in 1978 to end a bloody reign of terror
by the Khmer Rouge and installed a pro-Hanoi government, has
pledged it will remove all its forces from the country by Tuesday.
The guerrillas say it is a ploy and that Vietnam is hiding soldiers
in Cambodia.
   A large farewell ceremony for the Vietnamese military,
reportedly the last of 26,000 in Cambodia, is to be held Monday in
Phnom Penh.
   ``After the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops the war will
continue,'' Hun Sen told reporters. ``As to the scope of the war,
we think it will depend on foreign countries.''
   Thailand has allowed the insurgents to set up camps in its
territory, while China has armed them.
   ``We appeal to those who supported the enemy on the basis of
their opposition to Vietnamese forces in Cambodia to reassess their
policies,'' said Hun Sen. ``The best way to prevent civil war is to
immediately stop supplying arms.''
   He said he is willing to improve ties between his Communist
government and the United States through joint searches for remains
of U.S. servicemen missing since the Vietnam War.
   Both Vietnam and Laos have participated in some searches for
missing U.S. servicemen together with American specialists.
   Hun Sen said his government already has discovered some remains
and is willing to hand them over. He did not say how many bodies
have been discovered, and a senior Foreign Ministry official said
he did not know the number.
   ``It was the U.S. that showed a lack of interest in our finds,''
said Hun Sen. ``They said they have no relations with the Phnom
Penh government so they will not get in touch with the Phnom Penh
government on this issue.''
   China and many Western countries refuse to establish diplomatic
ties with an administration installed by Hanoi, and the United
Nations recognizes the guerrilla coalition as Cambodia's official
government.
   However, a Foreign Ministry official said Sunday that Chinese
officials came to Cambodia for the first time since 1979 earlier
this year to discuss resuming trade ties.
   Hun Sen confirmed that he and guerrilla leaders have agreed to
resume peace talks some time in the future.
   Peace talks in Paris failed in July after Hun Sen rejected
guerrilla demands that the Khmer Rouge be included in a
transitional government.
   Under Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge forced hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians to leave the cities and killed thousands in a brutal
attempt to create a primitive agrarian society.
   The Phnom Penh leader again refused to share power with them.
   ``We can make some concessions, but with regard to the Khmer
Rouge we cannot make any concessions at all,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, 11 Western aid agencies in Cambodia called on
governments Sunday to prevent the Khmer Rouge returning to power.
   ``Our experience in Cambodia and our contact with Cambodians at
all levels of society confirm that what Cambodians most fear is a
return to the horrors of the Khmer Rouge regime,'' the groups said
in a statement.
   They criticized some countries for insisting that the Communist
Khmer Rouge be part of a future coalition government. Many Western
and non-Communist Southeast Asian countries who wish for Vietnam's
downfall back the coalition despite the inclusion of the Khmer
Rouge. The two non-Communist guerrilla groups do not hide their
distaste for the Khmer Rouge, but say they would rather share power
than fight them.
