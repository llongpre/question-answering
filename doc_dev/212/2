  [Text] Phnom Penh 14 Jun (AKP) -- Following is the 
declaration made on 10 June by His Majesty the King of Cambodia: 
  "This week in Cambodia, the civil war that, alas, continues 
to rage and that pits units of the Cambodian Royal Armed Forces 
against those of the Khmer Rouge, has produced hundreds of 
victims among our innocent civilian compatriots, that is, nearly 
100 killed and more than 100 seriously wounded (men and women 
and old, adults, and children) not to mention scores of the 
slightly wounded and those who have survived but who have lost 
everything (houses burned, rice, fowl, and cattle lost, and so 
on)... 
  "In this civil war that, alas, slowly but surely advances 
through our motherland and pushes our people toward certain 
death, there is not nor will there be any victor or vanquished 
among the belligerents on either side. There is and will be 
only a great loser, the innocent little people of Cambodia. 
  "I appeal to all belligerents to have pity for these people 
who, for 24 years now, have suffered and still suffer so much. 
  "I ask them to please totally, immediately, and permanently 
end their war. 
  "Only total peace in Cambodia can save our motherland, our 
people, and our race from disappearing from the world map and 
the universal history."
