   Contra commanders on
Wednesday surrendered their weapons to President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro in a ceremony hailing the end of a nine-year civil war
that left 30,000 people dead.
   ``Today the war ends,'' presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo
said.
   Mrs. Chamorro accepted the weapons from 100 top rebel commanders
led by Israel Galeano in San Pedro de Lovago, 100 miles east of the
capital.
   Meanwhile, shortly after the ceremony, two helicopters carying
about 24 journalists collided as they were taking off and at least
14 people were injured, according to reports. The journalists
aboard included photographers for The Associated Press and Agence
France-Presse.
   In a speech, Mrs. Chamorro promised to disarm the leftist
Sandinistas who led the government for 11 years. There have been
charges the Sandinistas distributed weapons among their supporters
before leaving office on April 25.
   ``We're going to disarm everyone peacefully, without hate and
without resentment,'' Mrs. Chamorro said, adding that she would ask
local officials nationwide to ``tell me in writing'' where
Sandinista arms caches were hidden.
   The Contras cited the alleged arming of the civilian population
when they missed several deadlines to disarm.
   Galeano, speaking during the ceremony, said: ``It is an honor to
say to the Nicaraguan people: mission accomplished. The struggle
has been to establish a government of laws in this country.''
   Troops from an international demobilization force used
blowtorches to destroy the weapons on the spot.
   ``I feel proud and happy as a Nicaraguan woman and mother
because the boys have turned over their arms so Nicaragua can live
in peace,'' Mrs. Chamorro said.
   The weapons included automatic rifles and a second batch of
surface-to-air missiles. On Tuesday, Galeano handed over 62 of the
U.S.-made Red Eye missiles to the head of the United Nations force
that has overseen the demobilization of more than 18,000 Contras,
Gen. Agustin Quesada.
   ``We hope this signifies that peace will endure in Nicaragua,''
Galeano told the Spanish general.
   The former Sandinista government led by Daniel Ortega lost a
Feb. 25 election to the conservative coaltion led by Mrs. Chamorro.
   About 30,000 people died and another 25,000 were wounded in the
war between the U.S.-backed rebels and the Sandinistas in
Nicaragua, a nation the size of Iowa with 3.6 million residents.
   Galeano insisted the Contras were never tools of U.S. policy, as
many charged, and said they arose as a peasant reaction to
Sandinista attempts to impose ``foreign, totalitarian and
expansionist ideologies'' on Nicaragua.
   He gave up the first set of missiles in El Amendro, a town 190
miles southeast of Managua in Rio San Juan Province, where the
Contras have been promised land and a degree of local autonomy.
   Galeano said the United States had given the Contras more than
100 of the missiles the last four years of the war. He claimed the
rebels downed 35 government aircraft with them.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who has played a key role in
persuading the rebels to lay down their arms, celebrated a Mass
marking the war's end. He said peace depends on putting aside the
``language of hate and vengeance.''
   Diplomats from the United States, which armed the Contras early
in the Reagan administration, and from the Soviet Union, which
armed the Sandinistas they tried to overthrow, were invited to
Wednesday's ceremony, Lacayo said.
   The rebels began disarming on May 8, and U.N. officials say
about 1,000 still have their weapons.
   The elections were held under a regional peace accord that
called for the Contras to disarm.
   The war, along with the harsh U.S. economic sanctions that
contributed to bringing the Nicaraguan economy to a virtual
standstill, were thought the key factors behind the Sandinistas'
defeat.
   Washington lifted the economic embargo after Mrs. Chamorro's
victory and sent Nicaragua $300 million in needed foreign aid.
