<F P=106> ["Today's Comment" column by Thlang Ambal: "To Achieve </F>
Peace War Must Be Waged"] 
  [Text] Not all of the world's wars have been brought to an 
end through negotiations alone. Some countries have concluded 
wars through talks, while others have terminated them through 
war. Vietnam, after 30 years of fighting, finished its war 
through war. In Cambodia, Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan have also 
ended a war through war. 
  The Khmer Rouge [KR] still nurtures the obsolete idea of 
terminating war through war, by which it has previously 
succeeded. This being the case, it does not want to hold talks 
to end the war. 
  Ignorant individuals-cum-politicians that a party picked up 
from a "rubbish bin" claim that peace can only be achieved if 
the Khmer Rouge is included in the Royal Government. 
  We are still optimistic, however, that "if the war is to be 
terminated," the war must be fought. Negotiations should not be 
held at any rate, because holding negotiations is tantamount to 
handing over a sword to the Khmer Rouge. 
  The policy of "negotiating" with the Khmer Rouge could once 
again become a "policy of fleeing the country." 
  Those siding with the Khmer Rouge must go and stay with 
them. 
The Kingdom of Cambodia will not surrender to the Khmer Rouge, 
come hell or high water.
