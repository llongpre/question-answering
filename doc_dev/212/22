   Cambodia's four warring factions said Sunday they
have agreed on most key elements of a U.N. peace plan, but they
ended their round of talks without a final accord.
   The outcome of the two-day Paris talks fell short of the
objective set by France and Indonesia, co-chairmen of the
conference, to secure total agreement to the proposal. However, the
participants said the Paris Peace Conference would reconvene ``at
an early date.''
   A final communique by the Supreme National Council, made up of
the warring groups, said early Sunday there was agreement on ``most
of the fundamental points'' of the U.N.-sponsored plan. But it
added there were outstanding questions.
   These questions should be discussed within the 12-member council
and by the Coordinating Committee of the Paris Conference, which is
the framework for signing an overall peace settlement to end more
than a decade of civil war in the Southeast Asian country.
   The U.N. plan was agreed to Nov. 26 by the United States and the
four other permanent members of the Security Council. It calls for
the United Nations to administer Cambodia during an interim period
leading to free elections, while the Supreme National Council acts
as titular head. It also calls for a cease-fire and disarming of
all four parties.
   The heads of all the resistance factions voiced their acceptance
``without reserve'' of the plan and called on the Phnom Penh
government to accept it. The resistance representatives were Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, heading the delegation of rebel coalition leader
Prince Norodom; Son Sann; and Khieu Samphan, leader of the
Communist Khmer Rouge.
   The government of Prime Minister Hun Sen was the only one of the
four Cambodian factions to object to key aspects of the U.N.
proposal, according to informed sources speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   A senior Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Phnom Penh is concerned about the extent to which its
government could be dismantled by the plan and about the extent of
disarmament.
   Hun Sen said on his arrival here that ``serious measures must be
taken to suppress the foundations'' of the Khmer Rouge, the
strongest member of the three-party resistance coalition.
   The Khmer Rouge's three-year reign as Cambodia's government,
which ended in 1979 with a Vietnamese invasion, left hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians dead from executions, famine and civil
unrest.
