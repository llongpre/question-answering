   U.S. military experts arrived in
Cambodia today to examine what may be the remains of America's
wartime missing, the first such mission since the 1975 Communist
takeover.
   The six-man team, including two forensic scientists, flew from
Bangkok, Thailand, in a U.S. Air Force C-141 jet transport.
   The U.S. delegation shook hands awkwardly with a group of
mid-level Cambodian officials then drove into Phnom Penh, where
they spent an hour touring the city before meetings with Cambodian
officials.
   On Wednesday, they are to examine remains collected by the
Cambodians. If it appears the remains may be those of American
servicemen, they are to be removed to the United States for further
examination and identification.
   The United States still does not recognize the
Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh government. On Wednesday, however,
it announced it was withdrawing recognition of the guerrilla
coalition battling the government in order to open talks with
Vietnam on ending the country's civil war.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said on July 13
that today's mission would be strictly humanitarian and have no
political intent. American officials have complained that the
Cambodians postponed repatriation of remains in order to exact
political concessions from the United States.
   The visiting team is from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center
and the Army Central Identification Laboratory, Hawaii-based
agencies that try to account for U.S. military personnel listed as
missing in action in the Indochina conflict.
   It is led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, head of the resolution center.
   Harvey said on arrival in Phnom Penh that he came only to view
the remains and the issue of normalized relations between Cambodia
and the United States ``definitely is not on the agenda.''
   In Bangkok, team spokesman Lt. Col. Thomas Boyd said that if the
remains are identified as those of Americans, a 17-member team will
fly to Phnom Penh Thursday for a military honors ceremony. The
remains would be flown to Hawaii.
   Boyd said he did not know how many sets of remains the team will
examine.
   A total of 2,299 Americans are officially listed as missing in
action in Indochina. Of those, 1,678 are missing in Vietnam, 533 in
Laos and six in China's coastal waters.
   Of the 82 missing in Cambodia, most are airmen whose planes were
downed during strikes on the Ho Chi Minh Trail in eastern areas
that North Vietnam used to infiltrate men and supplies into South
Vietnam.
   U.S. airplanes heavily bombed the country from 1969 until 1973.
   U.S. officials have said there also are at least eight civilians
missing in Cambodia, including four journalists, two contractors, a
merchant seaman and a missionary.
   The Khmer Rouge toppled the U.S.-backed Lon Nol government in
April 1975, sending the American ambassador fleeing. Over the next
four years, the Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians as it tried to turn the country into an agrarian commune.
   The Vietnamese invasion of late 1978 ousted the Khmer Rouge and
installed a new communist government in Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge
then joined two non-communist groups in a guerrilla coalition
backed by China and many other countries.
   Earlier this month, John Gunther Dean, the last U.S. Ambassador
to Cambodia, made a six-day visit to Phnom Penh _ his first since
carrying out the U.S. flag during the 1975 evacuation.
   Phnom Penh said in 1984 that it was willing to cooperate on the
issue of missing Americans and declared in 1988 it was willing to
hand over remains. But the repatriations had been delayed by the
diplomatic stalemate.
   Prime Minister Hun Sen was quoted as saying in February 1989
that his government had eight sets of American remains and was
searching for more.
   Last month, the Cambodian government said it had set up a
five-man commission chaired by a deputy minister to help search for
the remains of U.S. servicemen.
