   With Iran's agreement this week to participate in a United
Nations-sponsored cease-fire, and a South Africa-Angola agreement
on crucial issues in their conflict, it seemed peace could become a
reality for several long-troubled regions. Here is a summary of
bloody conflicts with prospects for negotiated settlements:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IRAN-IRAQ</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WAR STARTED: September 1980.
   WHY: Ancient enemies, the Persians of Iran and Arabs of Iraq
went to war anew when minor border skirmishes were followed by a
full-scale Iraqi invasion. Iran's Islamic fundamentalism clashed
with Iraq's modernizing socialism.
   TACTICS: Attacks on shipping, particularly oil tankers, in
Persian Gulf. ``War of the cities'' missile attacks on civilian
populations. Widespread reports of use of chemical weapons by both
sides. Casualties estimated at 1 million people killed or wounded.
   CURRENT STATUS: Fighting continues but Iran last week agreed to
accept a U.N. resolution that could end the war. Iraq accepted the
resolution last year. No agreement on format of talks.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ANGOLA-SOUTH AFRICA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WAR STARTED: In 1966, the South-West Africa People's
Organization (SWAPO) began guerrilla attacks on the South African
administration in South-West Africa (Namibia). In Angola, civil war
continued after independence from Portugal in 1975 between the new
Marxist government and the rebels of UNITA _ the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola.
   WHY: SWAPO is fighting for Namibian independence from South
Africa. In Angola, UNITA contends the Marxist government that took
over with Soviet help reneged on an agreement to share power.
   TACTICS: Angola and South Africa accuse each other of supporting
rebels seeking to overthrow their governments. Angola is backed by
Soviet aid and Cuban troops, now believed to number 50,000. UNITA
fights with the aid of South Africa and the United States. South
Africa escalated its role in the war a year ago, moving troops into
southern Angola on a long-term basis.
   CURRENT STATUS: Last week, South Africa, Angola and Cuba agreed
to principles to end clashes among their troops in southern Angola,
and to give South-West Africa (Namibia) its independence.

<HEAD>NICARAGUA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WAR STARTED: Small-scale resistance began soon after the leftist
Sandinistas ousted the right-wing strongman President Anastasio
Somoza in 1979.
   WHY: Contra rebels condemn the Sandinistas as authoritarian
communists.
   TACTICS: Mostly Contra infiltration from bases in Honduras.
United States supplies aid to Contra rebels. Nicaragua says more
than 26,500 people have been killed in the war.
   CURRENT STATUS: Nicaragua last Tuesday extended a unilateral
truce until Aug. 30, and called on the Contras to resume talks to
work out a permanent cease-fire. Rifts between ``hawks'' and
``doves'' in Contra ranks have left the rebels in disarray.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AFGHANISTAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WAR STARTED: In April 1978, pro-Soviet Marxist party of
Afghanistan overthrew the Afghan republic, and the anti-communist
resistance began. Soviets deployed troops in 1979.
   WHY: Largely fundamentalist Moslem guerrillas oppose communism.
Soviets have backed allied Afghan government.
   TACTICS: Guerrilla ambushes and sieges of provincial fortresses.
Soviet air attacks against guerrilla bases. Moslem rebels receive
arms shipped through neighboring Pakistan from United States.
Surveys in 1987 estimated more than 1.2 million Afghans have died
in war. Some 5 million have fled to Pakistan and Iran.
   CURRENT STATUS: Soviet withdrawal that began May 15 continues
under U.N. supervision, and is to be completed by Feb. 15, 1989.
Accords were mediated by United Nations and signed by neighbors
Pakistan and Afghanistan, with Washington and Moscow acting as
guarantors.

<HEAD>CAMBODIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WAR STARTED: Vietnam invaded in 1978, driving out communist
Khmer Rouge, who had governed since 1975. Groups including Khmer
Rouge seeking to oust Vietnam have fought guerrilla war since.
   WHY: After years of border disputes and ideological clashes,
Vietnam, with close ties to the Soviet Union, drove out the Chinese
Communist-supported Khmer Rouge and established a Vietnamese-backed
government in Cambodia.
   TACTICS: War waged only in dry season. Mostly small-scale
guerrilla engagements. Hundreds of thousands of Cambodian refugees
have poured into neighboring Thailand. About 2 million of
Cambodia's 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge executions,
famine and civil unrest before the Vietnamese ended their rule.
Vietnam said 25,000 of its soldiers have been killed since 1978.
Cambodian guerrilla casualties are unknown.
   CURRENT STATUS: Talks begin Monday, July 25, for a peaceful
solution, to be followed by talks on Cambodia between the Soviet
Union and China. Vietnam is withdrawing its troops from Cambodia
and says they all will be out by 1990.
