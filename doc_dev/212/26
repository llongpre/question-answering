<LEADPARA>  The Khmer Rouge, the communist guerrilla group that once brutally ruled
Cambodia and has now joined the new coalition government under a peace accord,
is hiding troops and a huge cache of weapons in preparation for the possible
resumption of the Cambodian civil war, diplomats and relief workers say.;  
The move, they say, violates disarmament provisions of the U.N. peace treaty
that the Khmer Rouge signed in Paris only last month with Cambodia's communist
government and two non-communist guerrilla groups.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The treaty, which is seen as the best hope for ending the long civil war in
this shattered nation, requires partial demobilization by all sides under the
supervision of the United Nations.;   Violations expected; Diplomats said that
in drafting the treaty, they took into account the possibility that the Khmer
Rouge or other factions would try to hide troops and weapons. With the first
soldiers of a large U.N. peacekeeping force arriving in Cambodia on Sunday,
the diplomats expressed hope that adequate safeguards would soon be in place
to prevent any new use of force.;   "As best anyone can tell, the Khmer Rouge
are hiding equipment and people wherever they can," said a Western diplomat
who helped draw up the peace agreement. "There's no way to detect a lot of it.
One hope is that the Khmer Rouge will feel sufficiently intimidated by the
presence of United Nations peacekeeping troops in Cambodia that they will not
fight again.";   Still, diplomats called the move by the Khmer Rouge
particularly troubling because, as the most powerful of the three rebel
factions, the group is in a position to determine whether the civil war will
resume and when.;   According to intelligence reports and accounts from
Cambodian refugees crossing into Thailand, the Khmer Rouge has put aside
enough weapons and ammunition in the Cardamom mountains of western Cambodia
and elsewhere to allow it to fight on for years.;    Khmer Rouge soldiers are
also being hidden in remote base camps to prevent their detection by U.N.
inspectors, who will try to monitor disarmament by the Cambodian factions, the
Western diplomat said.;   Khmer Rouge threat; The reports from diplomats and
relief workers are evidence both of the frailty of the peace agreement and of
the threat still posed by the Khmer Rouge and its leader, Pol Pot. During the
group's four-year rule in the 1970s, more than 1 million Cambodians were
executed or died from starvation and disease as the government sought to
remake Cambodian society.;   After the Khmer Rouge was ousted by a Vietnamese
invasion in 1978, its leaders returned to the Cambodian jungle and to border
outposts in Thailand to regroup.  </TEXT>
