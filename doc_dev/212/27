   A new U.N. peace plan for Cambodia has
again raised hopes for ending the civil war, but many past efforts
have failed after initial optimism.
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council on
Tuesday proposed a U.N. interim administration in Cambodia until a
new government is elected. They envisaged deploying up to 20,000
U.N. personnel, including a peacekeeping force, to bolster a truce
and guide the nation to democracy.
   The Vietnamese-installed communist government of Premier Hun Sen
is battling a guerrilla coalition composed of the communist Khmer
Rouge and two non-Communist groups, one headed by former head of
state Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the other by former Premier Son
Sann.
   All sides welcomed the U.N. plan and signaled willingness to
hold talks to discuss it in detail.
   But they have made no concessions on long-standing differences.
Meanwhile, fighting has increased as both sides have reported big
battles for control of western and central areas during the current
rainy season.
   One diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the
proposal a breakthrough because it was endorsed by Britain, China,
France, the Soviet Union and the United States, which back
different parties in the war. They are the permanent members of the
security council.
   China, the guerrillas' main backer, said conditions had been
created for a political settlement ``and the time is right for a
settlement.''
   U.S. officials at the United Nations tried on Friday to persuade
Vietnamese diplomats to back the U.N. plan.
   The same day, the Vietnamese government said the new plan went
``in the right direction in the search for an overall, fair and
reasonable political solution.''
   But outside efforts cannot succeed without the approval of the
Cambodian factions. Each time they have neared breakthroughs in the
past, they later retreated to their old positions.
   In Tokyo in June, Sihanouk and Hun Sen signed a document saying
they wanted a Supreme National Council formed that would arrange
the first truce in the war and act as an interim body before
elections. The council would comprise representatives from the
government and rebels.
   But the agreement collapsed quickly. Fighting continued, and the
Khmer Rouge insisted it have the same number of council seats as
the Hun Sen government.
   Both sides expressed willingness to attend talks that Indonesia
is trying to arrange for this month. Indonesia has played host at
three rounds of Cambodian peace talks since 1988.
   The U.N. plan calls for five key ministries to be placed in U.N.
hands. But the government and the guerrillas have long disagreed on
the extent of the U.N. mandate.
   Phnom Penh wants to retain power in the interim period. The
guerrillas want either the United Nations or the Supreme National
Council to have interim power.
   Phnom Penh's deputy prime minister, Hor Nam Hong, welcomed the
U.N. plan but did not indicate his government would concede on the
issue of interim power.
   However, in remarks quoted by the official news media on
Saturday, he accepted the ``major role played by the United Nations
during the transitional period, notably the right to organize free
and fair elections.''
   ``Certain important ministries may be supervised by the United
Nations so that the elections can take place in a neutral political
environment,'' he said.
   Phnom Penh previously rebuffed the United Nations because it
recognizes the guerrilla coalition as Cambodia's government.
   In July, however, in a major policy shift, the United States
said it would no longer back the guerrillas' U.N. seat. Washington
also said it would consider opening direct talks with the Cambodian
government.
   The civil war began after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978,
ending a rule of nearly four years of the Khmer Rouge. Under the
Khmer Rouge, hundreds of thousands of people died of famine, in
executions and slave labor camps.
