  [Text] Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans has 
called on the rebel Cambodian guerrilla faction, the Khmer 
Rouge, to end its war and talk peace with the government in 
Phnom Penh. Senator Evans told journalists in the Cambodian 
capital that the Khmer Rouge was a diminishing force with no 
credibility. He said the guerrillas continue to loose their 
power and influence and predicted that Cambodian Government 
troops would remain in control of the faction's former 
stronghold of Pailin, which they captured last month. Senator 
Evans said for the Khmer Rouge to engage in a proper 
reconciliation process, it would have to give up areas it still 
controlled, end its military campaign, and recognize the 
legitimacy of the Cambodian Government.
