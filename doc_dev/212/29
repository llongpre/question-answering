   Salvadoran guerrillas Thursday
denounced President Alfredo Cristiani's recent cease-fire offer as
a tactic taken only to win more military aid for his government.
   In a speech Monday to the 45th General Assembly of the United
Nations, Cristiani proposed a government cease-fire if the FMLN
would do the same.
   ``It is an old offer that seeks to end the war without ending
the causes that originated it,'' the rebels said in the broadcast
on Radio Venceremos, their clandestine voice.
   The offer ``isn't really directed at us, who have a promise with
the government and the United Nations to negotiate ahead of time
the conditions for a cease-fire,'' the rebels said. ``It is aimed
at the American Senate, who Cristiani is trying to impress ... to
get more military aid for the war.''
   Cristiani returned this week to El Salvador after meeting in New
York with President Bush, who is seeking $85 million in new
military aid to El Salvador. The aid package faces an especially
tough battle in Congress, where there is indignation over
continuing human rights abuses.
   Six Jesuit priests who taught at the University of Central
America were murdered in November. Little progress has been made in
bringing evidence against officers believed to have ordered the
killings.
   Cristiani told a news conference Thursday that he met with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar during his trip and
wanted to step up the pace of talks with the rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National LIberation Front.
   ``I consider it necessary to implement some formulas whic will
make the process more dynamic,... which will move more quickly than
what has happened until now,'' Cristiani said.
   Government and guerrilla representatives met under U.N.
sponsorship five times this year, but failed to reach agreement on
terms for ending the decade-old civil war which has claimed at
least 73,000 lives, mostly civilians.
   Cristiani expressed regret at the guerrilla rejection of his
proposed cease-fire, saying he had offered it ``thinking that the
Salvadoran people should not have to continue suffering violence.''
