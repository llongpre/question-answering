   After nine years of civil
war that claimed about 30,000 lives, Nicaragua is finally at peace.
   ``I feel proud and happy as a Nicaraguan woman and mother
because the boys have turned over their arms so Nicaragua can live
in peace,'' President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro said Wednesday
after a ceremony in which top Contra rebel leaders gave up their
weapons.
   ``We're going to disarm everyone peacefully, without hate and
without resentment,'' she said.
   During the ceremony formally ending the war, about 100 rebel
commanders turned over surface-to-air missiles and automatic rifles
to international observers from the United Nations and Organization
of American States.
   The international force destroyed the Contra weapons with
blowtorches on the spot in San Pedro de Lovago, about 100 miles
east of Managua, the capital.
   The town is in the heart of the security zones established for
the disarmament and voluntary resettlement of the Contras.
   ``Today the war ends,'' presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo
said.
   Shortly after the ceremony, 14 people, most of them journalists,
were seriously injured when two helicopters carrying them back to
Managua collided during takeoff.
   The Contra commanders were led by Israel Galeano, who had turned
over a first batch of weapons, including 62 U.S.-made Red Eye
missiles, to the head of the U.N.-OAS force, Gen. Agustin Quesada.
   ``We hope this signifies that peace will endure in Nicaragua,''
Galeano told the Spanish general.
   ``It is an honor to say to the Nicaraguan people: `Mission
accomplished.' The struggle has been to establish a government of
laws in this country,'' Galeano said, handing over his own rifle.
   The Contras, who were trained and supported by the United
States, claim credit for forcing the former Sandinista government
to call the Feb. 25 election that Mrs. Chamorro won.
   After losing the election, the Sandinistas allegedly distributed
tens of thousands of automatic weapons to civilian supporters,
urging them to ``defend the conquests'' of the Sandinista
revolution.
   Mrs. Chamorro pledged during Wednesday's ceremony to ask local
officials nationwide to ``tell me in writing'' where Sandinista
arms caches are hidden.
   The Contras had cited the arming of the civilian population of
this nation of 3.6 million people when they missed several previous
deadlines to disarm.
   They finally began turning in their weapons on May 8, two weeks
after the Sandinistas handed over power to Mrs. Chamorro.
   U.N. officials now say that only about 1,000 members of the once
18,000-strong rebel force still have their guns.
   He gave up the first batch of missiles on Tuesday in the town of
El Amendro, 190 miles southeast of Managua in Rio San Juan
Province, where the Contras have been promised land on which to
settle.
   He said the United States had given the Contras more than 100 of
the Red Eye missiles in the last four years of the war. He claimed
the rebels had downed 35 government aircraft with them.
   The war, which was accompanied by harsh U.S. economic sanctions
that helped bring the Nicaraguan economy to a virtual standstill,
is seen as the key factor behind Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega's
stunning electoral loss.
   Although a cease-fire has been in place since early 1988,
sporadic combat _ and the hated military draft _ continued along
with U.S. economic pressure.
   Washington lifted the sanctions after Mrs. Chamorro's victory
and sent Nicaragua $300 million in badly needed foreign aid.
   Mrs. Chamorro abolished the draft on April 25, the day she took
office. She later announced plans to reduce to army to half its
current strength of more than 90,000.
   Nicaragua had amassed Central America's largest armed force with
huge infusions of aid from the Soviet Union and its allies.
