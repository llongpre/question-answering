   Thousands of Vietnamese soldiers
bade farewell to Phnom Penh today, leaving behind citizens worried
that the dreaded Khmer Rouge is already taking advantage of Hanoi's
pullout with new assaults.
   Hundreds of army vehicles including artillery and tanks paraded
in front of the Royal Palace as a band played a song celebrating
the ``solidarity'' between Vietnam and Cambodia.
   Several thousand people including Cambodian soldiers and
schoolchildren lined the streets waving flags in yet another
government-organized ceremony marking what Vietnam says is the
withdrawal of its final 26,000 troops.
   Heng Samrin, president of the Vietnamese-installed government,
thanked the commanders of departing Vietnamese units 479 and 979.
Twelve Buddhist monks in saffron robes chanted blessings.
   Cambodian and Vietnamese commanders embraced and were presented
flowers from women in traditional costumes.
   After the brief ceremony, the soldiers headed east for the
Vietnamese border on narrow Highway No. 1. That was a main route
Vietnamese forces used to invade Cambodia in late 1978 and end
nearly four years of Khmer Rouge rule in which hundreds of
thousands died.
   After an overnight rest, the soldiers were to cross from Svey
Rieng province to Vietnam's Tay Ninh province, supposedly ending
Hanoi's involvement in the stalemated war against the Khmer Rouge
and two other guerrilla groups. Other units were to return home by
the Mekong River and the Gulf of Thailand.
   The guerrillas have called the six-day troop movement a fake,
but the Khmer Rouge has beseiged the gem-rich western town of
Pailin in recent months, evidently to take advantage of a
Vietnamese retreat from the Thai border area.
   The Khmer Rouge claimed today it had captured the Ratanamondol
district seat at Sdau township, on Route 10 which links the town of
Battambang with Pailin.
   On its radio station, the Voice of the National Army of
Democratic Kampuchea, the Khmer Rouge called the area a ``major
strategic position whose task is to defend Battambang town from the
south.'' A transcript of the radio report was seen in Bangkok.
   Battambang is about 160 miles northwest of Phnom Penh.
   The defense minister, Gen. Tea Banh, has acknowledged the
guerrillas have seized territory around Pailin but says it remains
under Phnom Penh control.
   Phnom Penh's best division, the 196th, was defending Pailin
against some 3,000 guerrillas of elite Khmer Rouge divisions 415
and 320, said Khieu Kanharith, a prominent newspaper editor who
recently visited the front.
   Khieu said the Khmer Rouge were raining 800 to 2,000 shells
daily. He said the guerrillas trucked in ammunition from a short
distance while Phnom Penh forces were supplied from bases 75 miles
away.
   Since 1979, only soldiers have lived in Pailin, he said in an
interview.
   The battle has intensified concern in the country over whether
the army of the Vietnam-installed Phnom Penh government can handle
the guerrillas alone.
   Some Phnom Penh residents have been stocking rice anticipating
the guerrillas will cut off supplies to the city, Cambodian
officials said. Some senior government officials have been saving
money and gold in case they need to flee abroad, Western aid
officials say.
   Already many Vietnamese civilians, including entire villages of
fishermen, reportedly have fled back home.
   The Khmer Rouge toppled the U.S.-backed Lon Nol government in
April 1975, and immediately drove the people of Phnom Penh into the
countryside at gunpoint. Attempting to turn Cambodia into a
primitive agrarian commune, they created slave labor camps that
became mass graves.
   On Sunday, Phnom Penh's Prime Minister Hun Sen urged the main
non-Communist resistance leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, to break
with the Khmer Rouge and return home.
   Sihanouk's hands have been ``soaked in blood'' by the alliance,
he said.
   Hun Sen called on China, Thailand and other countries to keep
what he said were pledges to stop military aid to the guerrillas
once the Vietnamese have left.
   ``We have clearly seen that our enemy has prepared all
eventualities for civil war,'' he told a news conference. ``The
scope of the war will depend on the attitude of foreign countries.''
   In a statement issued in Bangkok, Sihanouk said today he would
only take part in future peace talks if they are held within an
international framework.
   He rejected absolutely any negotiations with Hun Sen, and said a
report on the Voice of America radio station that he had agreed to
bilateral talks ``does not correspond with reality.''
   Thailand has allowed the insurgents to set up camps in its
territory, while China has armed them.
   The Soviet ambassador, Rashit Khamidouline, has said his
government is continuing arms supplies to Phnom Penh but not
increasing them as Vietnam retreats.
   Hun Sen confirmed that he and guerrilla leaders have just agreed
to resume peace talks.
   But he said he would not back off from his demand that any
settlement must include dismantling the Khmer Rouge army and
political organization.
   Talks in Paris failed in July after Hun Sen rejected guerrilla
demands that the Khmer Rouge be included in a transitional
government.
