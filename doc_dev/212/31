<TEXT>     "Cambodia is about to resume its place in the world," he added during the
session at an ornate conference center in Paris.;   Hours before Mitterrand
spoke, relief workers and the military wing of the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front, one of the guerrilla factions, accused Phnom Penh government
forces of shelling several positions in northwestern Cambodia.;   Hundreds of
Cambodian exiles cheered Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who will head an interim
Cambodian government, when he arrived to sign the treaty intended to end 20
years of bloodshed and civil war.;   Waving banners reading "Peace in
Cambodia," the throng greeted Sihanouk with cheers and applause as he entered
the center a few hours the signing ceremony.;   Secretary of State James
Baker, among those attending the ceremony, said earlier today the
U.N.-sponsored peace treaty for Cambodia cannot guarantee lasting peace but
would give "great hope.";   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, whose
Vietnamese-installed government is one of four Cambodian factions signing the
accord, said he "shared the joy of the Cambodian people.";   But he accused
the Khmer Rouge, the hard-line communists whose rule from 1975 to 1978 led to
the deaths of 1 million people, of "creating new problems" that he did not
specify.;   Hun Sen claimed that Cambodian police would be able to guarantee
Sihanouk's security when he returns to Phnom Penh on Nov. 14 as leader of the
Supreme National Council that is to shepherd the country toward U.N.-sponsored
elections next year.;   Khieu Samphan, chief delegate for the Khmer Rouge,
said that he would return to Phnom Penh in November as representative of the
Khmer Rouge, which forms part of the council.;   The Paris Conference on
Cambodia, which first convened July 30, 1989, and is co-chaired by France and
Indonesia, has been the framework for negotiations.  </TEXT>
