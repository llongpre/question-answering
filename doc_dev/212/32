   SITE 2, Thailand (AP) _ Buddhist monks chanted prayers Sunday
before thousands of Cambodian refugees who gathered to appeal for
the human rights denied them for nearly two decades.
   The ceremony marking International Human Rights Day followed
clashes just outside this border camp Thursday and Friday that
killed at least one person and wounded two people, aid officials
said.
   Officials said the clashes involved Thai paramilitary personel
and Cambodian traders along the border, also the scene of
intensifying fighting in the 11-year-old civil war.
   Relief officials have documented numerous slayings, rapes and
beatings of Cambodians in refugee camps and their homelands by Thai
authorities, the three guerrilla groups and the
Vietnamese-installed government.
   ``Our people have already suffered too much because of human
rights violations,'' said Dr. Haing Ngor, who portrayed a survivor
of the brutal 1975-78 Khmer Rouge regime in the film ``The Killing
Fields.''
   ``Please help the suffering people of Cambodia, the most
suffering nation in the world,'' he said during the ceremony.
   The ceremonies, organized by U.N. relief officials, began with
Buddhist monks in saffron robes praying for peace and
schoolchildren singing a human rights song.
   ``Human rights is sometimes seen as a Western idea, an idea
alien to Cambodian culture,'' one monk, Yos Hut, told several
thousand of the camp's 140,000 residents. ``This is not true.''
   On a stage of bamboo and cloth, students in traditional costumes
danced and other refugees acted out a sketch of quarreling
neighbors who peacefully settle their disputes.
   Eight pigeons were released and flew outside the camp, where the
refugees are not supposed to go.
   After a minute of silence, some participants ventured into an
exhibition of paintings by refugees, showing the Khmer Rouge
killing victims and dumping them into mass graves and Vietnamese
soldiers bayoneting and raping Cambodians.
   At sundown, about 20 to 25 Western relief workers and about a
dozen refugees at Site 2 ended a 24-hour fast to appeal for the
protection of the Cambodians.
   ``All of these border camps are human rights violations in
themselves,'' said an organizer of the fast, Corinne Bowmaker of
the American Refugee Committtee.
   Millions have died in Cambodia since the 1970 military coup
ended the peaceful three-decade rule of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
The Khmer Rouge, who won the 1970-75 civil war, killed hundreds of
thousands of people before Vietnamese troops drove them from power
in late 1978. A civil war has raged since.
   Site 2 is controlled by the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front. Human Rights Day ceremonies were also held in Site B, the
main camp controlled by the forces of Prince Sihanouk, and Site 8,
the main Khmer Rouge camp.
   U.N. relief workers recently introduced into the camps judicial
systems reflecting the principles of the human rights declaration,
which the United Nations adopted 41 years ago Sunday.
