<P>
The five permanent members of the U.N Security Council agreed Sunday on the 
final draft of a peace settlement to end 12 years of war in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the United 
States adopted a 12-page document that outlines a U.N-sponsored peace plan for 
the country, Western diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, first proposed in January, calls for U.N. administrators and 
peacemakers to virtually run Cambodia during a transitional period leading to 
free elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Our work is over," a Western official close to the talks said before the 
19-hour session ended at 1:15 this morning. In three days of negotiations, 
officials talked for about 40 hours with little sleep or food. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word about the fate of a final communique they wrestled 
to write after reaching agreement on the peace draft. 
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. plan is to succeed, Cambodia's four warring factions must first 
bury their differences and agree to set up a Supreme National Council, which is 
a cornerstone of the draft settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Exiled Cambodian leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who flew to Paris last week, 
urged Phnom Penh Premier Hun Sen and his own two allies in a guerrilla 
coalition fighting the government to join him in the French capital as soon as 
possible for an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Full adherence to the plan by the four would allow France and Indonesia to 
convene the 19-nation Paris peace talks on Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris conference, which could be held this year or in early 1991, would be 
asked to give official approval to the U.N. plan. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the five permanent members backed different factions. China has long 
supported the notorious Khmer Rouge, the strongest guerrilla group, and the 
Soviet Union backed Cambodia's pro-Vietnam government. 
</P>
<P>
China last week announced that it was ending military aid to the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet Union appeared determined to gain a final draft settlement 
in the seventh peace talks held this year, it raised the stickiest points, 
diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
"They apparently had the greatest problems with their allies in bringing them 
to the peace table," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Problems surfaced over a cease-fire and dismantling some of Phnom Penh's 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the contrast between Hun Sen's regular troops and the guerrilla 
forces, the plan provides for a phased process of disarmament and a return of 
people in uniform to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the government, the plan allows the United Nations to directly 
supervise functions of key ministries such as foreign affairs, defense, 
finance, security and information to ensure "a neutral political environment" 
before elections. 
</P>
<P>
No figures on the size or cost of the U.N. role were available. Officials in 
the past have spoken of up to 20,000 people, half civilian, half military, and 
a budget of $3 billion to $5 billion over two years. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomatic sources said the document contains: 
</P>
<P>
* A description of a mandate for the U.N. Transitional Authority in Cambodia, 
including a civilian and military component, organization of elections and 
verification of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
* Detailed provisions for a cease-fire and withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
* Election plans. 
</P>
<P>
* Repatriation of Cambodian refugees and displaced people. 
</P>
<P>
* Principles for a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The draft is accompanied by an agreement covering neutrality and sovereignty 
issues and a declaration on rehabilitation and reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
