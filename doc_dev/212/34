<LEADPARA>  The Bush administration has decided to launch a major diplomatic initiative
toward Vietnam, offering America's former wartime adversary a series of trade
and economic benefits and new steps toward normalization of relations if
Vietnam helps to bring about a quick peace settlement in Cambodia, U.S.
sources say.;    "The administration would like to lay that (Vietnam) era to
rest," a senior administration official said Monday. "What the administration
is trying to do is to give Hanoi and Phnom Penh every incentive to cooperate."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In New York today, Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon is
expected to present the new U.S. proposals to Trinh Xuan Lang, Vietnamese
ambassador to the United Nations, and to outline them on Capitol Hill in
testimony Wednesday.;    One administration official said the new U.S.
initiative will amount to "a road map" detailing exactly what benefits Vietnam
and the Vietnamese-backed government in Cambodia will obtain from a Cambodian
peace settlement. Details of the proposal were not available Monday.;   
Vietnam, confronted with a drastic cutback in economic support from the Soviet
Union, has been seeking a lifting of the U.S. trade embargo against it and an
end to the ban on loans to Vietnam from the World Bank, International Monetary
Fund and others. American support is considered crucial for Vietnam to obtain
loans from international financial institutions.;    Vietnamese 'quite tough';
 "The Vietnamese dearly want international aid," an Asian diplomat said
Monday. "They are short of foreign exchange." However, the official said, even
in its current economic plight, it is still not clear whether Vietnam will go
along with the new U.S. initiative. "The Vietnamese are quite tough," he said.
"They can hang on the ropes.";    Administration officials emphasized that
Vietnam will not get any of the new "incentives" unless it cooperates in
bringing about peace in Cambodia.;    Last summer, the five permanent members
of the United Nations Security Council approved a detailed plan for peace in
Cambodia. But over the past few months, Vietnam and Cambodia have resisted
going along with the U.N. plan on grounds that it would require the Phnom Penh
government of Premier Hun Sen to yield too much of its sovereignty to United
Nations-sponsored overseers.;     One critic's view;  One congressional staff
member, a critic of American policy toward Indochina, said Monday that the new
Bush administration overture is "an effort to show that they (U.S. officials)
are amenable (to a peace settlement) and that the Vietnamese are being
intransigent.";    However, a senior U.S. official characterized the
initiative as the first step in what could be "the end-game" in diplomatic
negotiations toward a Cambodian settlement.;    Not only the United States but
the Soviet Union and China are trying to bring about a Cambodian settlement,
this administration official said. "Basically, this (U.N. plan) has everyone's
support but two parties, Hanoi and Phnom Penh," he asserted. "We're sitting
here ready to turn on the lights and pour the wine.";    Khmer Rouge killed 1
million;  The current government in Phnom Penh was installed when Vietnamese
troops invaded Cambodia at the end of 1978 and ousted the Khmer Rouge. Over
the previous three years, under the Khmer Rouge regime, more than a million
Cambodians died as a result of political repression, hunger or disease.;   
Since 1979, Khmer Rouge guerrillas, armed by the Chinese, have been fighting a
civil war against the Vietnam-backed government. Two non-Communist resistance
groups have also been battling the Phnom Penh regime with support from both
China and the West. For nearly a decade, the Khmer Rouge and the non-Communist
groups were joined together in a political coalition, and there has also been
at least some battlefield cooperation among the resistance groups.;    Under
the United Nations peace plan, the four Cambodian political factions -- the
Phnom Penh government, the Khmer Rouge and the two non-Communist resistance
groups -- were all to share power in what was known as a Supreme National
Council. United Nations personnel were to control the government, arrange a
cease-fire and conduct free elections.;    But last fall, an administration
official said, "things began to unravel." The Phnom Penh government, with
Vietnam's support, resisted giving up control to the Supreme National Council
and sought new assurances that the Khmer Rouge would not resume their
murderous campaigns against other Cambodians.  </TEXT>
