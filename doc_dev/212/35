   The United States has opened the way
for new approaches to peace in Cambodia, but Khmer Rouge guerrillas
may escalate the fighting unless China goes along.
   On Wednesday, the United States announced it was withdrawing
recognition of the guerrilla coalition's seat at the United Nations
in order to open talks with Vietnam on ending the war. Although the
coalition has three factions, two of them non-Communist, the
Beijing-supported Khmer Rouge is by far the strongest.
   Because of the U.S. action, ``all of us can look forward with
confidence to the whole (peace) process having new momentum,'' said
Foreign Minister Gareth Evans of Australia, a key mediator on
Cambodia.
   Washington's decision widened the gulf between it and China, but
brought the United States closer to the Soviet Union, the main ally
of Hanoi and the Vietnamese-sponsored government of Cambodia.
   Evans noted the talks on Cambodia to be held this week in
Indonesia by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, United
States, Japan, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the European
Community.
   The Bush administration changed the U.S. position after American
intelligence reported increased Khmer Rouge assaults reminiscent of
those that brought it to power in April 1975.
   By the time Vietnamese forces invaded in December 1978, the
Khmer Rouge had slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people in
labor camps and execution chambers, and hundreds of thousands more
had died of starvation.
   Its 30,000 fighters are the dominant force in the guerrilla
coalition. The other factions are led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
the former ruler of Cambodia, and Son Sann.
   Many non-Communist resistance leaders say the U.S. shift will
drive the Khmer Rouge closer to China and convince its leaders they
must win militarily because they have been shut out of a political
settlement.
   Sihanouk, overall leader of the coalition, expressed anger at
the U.S. action and said the insurgents would be ``more firm and
fierce in their determination to continue to resist.''
   China has said it will halt aid only when other countries do and
only when a comprehensive political settlement is reached, and
demands the Khmer Rouge be included in a settlement. U.S.
intelligence agencies estimate it gives the Khmer Rouge $100
million worth of aid annually.
   ``I haven't seen any sign that they're softening on either of
these positions,'' a Western diplomat in Beijing said of the
Chinese.
   He said China wanted to remain the region's dominant power and
was trying to head off Vietnamese attempts to forge an Indochinese
bloc by controlling Cambodia and Laos. China does not seek direct
influence in Cambodia, but wants to ensure its neutrality, he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Diplomats also said China has been serious in talks on Cambodia
with the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and France, the other
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
   ``The Chinese appear to us to have all sorts of options in their
bag,'' De Montigny Marchand, Canadian undersecretary of state for
foreign affairs, said Thursday after talks in Beijing. ``They
struck me as not being as doctrinaire as I expected them to be.''
   Moscow has sharply reduced its economic aid and political
support, so Vietnam and its client government in Phnom Penh may be
more amenable to concessions.
   The U.S. dialogue with Vietnam, their first political talks
since the Vietnam war ended 15 years ago, has inspired hope that
Hanoi will put pressure on Phnom Penh to make peace.
   Vietnam knows settling the war is essential to achieving normal
relations with the United States, which are critical to ending its
isolation and solving its economic problems.
   Hope also flowered, however, when Vietnam and China began talks
on Cambodia in January 1989. In June, the fourth round collapsed in
mutual recrimination.
   Despite many negotiations over 2{ years, the factions still
disagree on who would govern until general elections. The
government wants to retain interim power and rejects any
significant Khmer Rouge role; the guerrillas demand a four-party
coalition government or a U.N. authority.
   Diplomats said the U.S. change could help induce Vietnam and the
Cambodian government to accept a U.N. authority, which they have
rejected because the guerrilla coaltion occupies the Cambodian seat.
   Cambodia's state news agency said the American decision would
``enable the United Nations to play its honorable and appropriate
role'' in a settlement. Vietnam expressed willingness to negotiate
an early solution.
