<F P=106> [Unattributed "Roundup": "Sihanouk Pessimistic About Peace </F>
in Cambodia"] 
  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 14 (XINHUA) -- King Norodom Sihanouk 
is very pessimistic about the prospects for peace and 
reconciliation in Cambodia following cool responses to his 
latest peace plan from both the government and the Khmer Rouge. 
  He said Thursday [12 May] that he was abandoning his peace 
efforts and leaving for medical treatment in a Beijing hospital 
on May 18, two weeks earlier than scheduled. 
  As the civil war escalates in west and northwest Cambodia, 
Sihanouk called for a round-table meeting between the royal 
government and the democratic Kampuchea on April 22. 
  However, the meeting was not held because of wide 
differences 
between Phnom Penh and the Khmer Rouge. 
  The Khmer Rouge thought its delegation might be in danger if 
the meeting were to be held in Phnom Penh and suggested a 
neutral site instead. 
  But the government claimed that it could guarantee the Khmer 
Rouge delegation safety 100 percent, and insisted that the 
meeting be held in Cambodia. 
  Sihanouk, who attempted to negotiate an end to the Cambodian 
war, on May 2 called for a total, immediate, unconditional and 
standstill cease-fire in Cambodia, and suggested holding the 
round-table meeting in the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea, but his efforts failed again. 
  Last weekend he suggested a new election, an idea which was 
immediately supported by the Khmer Rouge. However, some local 
newspapers and officials accused the king of "seeking power". 
  Despite the king's call, military conflicts are escalating, 
spreading from Battambang to 7 provinces, including Siem Reap, 
Kratie, Kompong Speu, Kompong Cham and Kampot. 
  As government troops fought to stave off a large-scale 
offensive by Khmer Rouge guerrillas, a government military 
spokesman said that 30 guerrillas had been killed and 30 injured. 
  The spokesman said that government forces had pushed the 
Khmer Rouge further back along National Route No. 10 on Sunday 
in Battambang, and had recaptured villages in Siem Reap and 
Kompong Speu. 
  But according to Khmer Rouge radio monitored here today, the 
Khmer Rouge, who are even threatening to take the city of 
Battambang, have captured three villages in Sangker District, 
east of Battambang and taken over a government stronghold 11 
kilometers north of Battambang. 
  The radio said they have also captured 23 villages along 
National Route No. 6 in Siem Reap Province, taken over four 
counties in Kratie Province, and cut the communications over the 
Mekong River this week. 
  Discouraged by his fruitless peace efforts, Sihanouk said 
angrily "even with 100 round-tables, there will be no peace." 
  He said he did not understand "why Khmers want to destroy 
their own country, want to destroy their own people." 
  King Sihanouk is now bringing his peace plan to Beijing and 
Pyongyang. Observers here believe that an end to the civil war 
is nowhere in sight.
