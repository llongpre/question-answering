<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: independent Namibia.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Cuban troops have been defending the Marxist government of
Angola from an anti-communist insurgency by UNITA, the National
Union for the Total Liberation of Angola, and recently the Cubans
and their Angolan allies have clashed with South African troops
sent over the border from Namibia to back UNITA. UNITA has also
received diplomatic and military support from the United States.
   Even earlier, at the U.N. General Assembly's special session on
disarmament in June, many nations lauded recent U.S.-Soviet
diplomatic agreements on nuclear arms reduction, saying their
example should inspire regional powers and the developing nations
to reach peace pacts and reduce their arsenals.
   And in Central Europe, the Warsaw Pact allies offered this month
to negotiate conventional force imbalances with their NATO
counterparts this year and accepted the West's demand that the
talks cover weapons as well as troop levels.
   The U.S. State Department said earlier this month that it
appears Moscow may withdraw 65,000 Red Army troops from Hungary or
10,000 from Poland as a unilateral gesture.
   The Warsaw Pact has called for each side to reduce its forces by
about 500,000 troops.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies have said the
Warsaw Pact has superior forces, and must make greater reductions
than the West.
   In Afghanistan, the Soviet withdrawal that began May 15
continues under U.N. supervision, and is to be completed by Feb.
15, 1989, ending nine years of Kremlin effort to put down armed
opposition to the communist Kabul government by Moslem guerrillas,
known as Mujahedeen. The accords were mediated by the United
Nations and signed by neighbors Pakistan and Afghanistan, with
Washington and Moscow acting as guarantors.
   A decade-long guerrilla war in Cambodia could begin winding down
after peace talks start Monday in Bogor, Indonesia.
   Communist Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to oust the
communist Khmer Rouge, who held power since 1975. About 2 million
of Cambodia's 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge executions,
famine and civil unrest until the Vietnamese ended their rule.
   The Khmer Rouge turned to guerrilla warfare, and since 1979 has
been the most powerful force battling Heng Samrin's government in
Phnom Penh, which is supported by about 140,000 of Hanoi's troops.
   The coalition of Cambodian resistance groups also includes the
non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front, and
followers of the former Cambodian head of state, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk. China is the main supporter of the resistance.
   Vietnam is withdrawing its troops from Cambodia and says they
all will be out by 1990. Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of
Vietnam has said that the long anti-guerrilla campaign has become
``Vietnam's Vietnam.''
   The Indonesian talks will be the first among all of Cambodia's
warring groups.
   In addition to the three guerrilla groups and the current
Cambodian government, the talks will include Vietnam, Laos and the
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations _ Thailand,
Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
   A diplomatic approach to three insurgencies in Central America
has met only limited success.
   Last August, the presidents of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Costa Rica signed a peace accord that links truces in
Central America with the withdrawal of military forces and
equipment supplied by outside powers and the restoration of civil
liberties.
   Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega last Tuesday extended a
unilateral truce in the 7-year-old war against the Contra rebels
until Aug. 30, and called on the U.S.-backed Contras to resume
talks to work out a permanent cease-fire.
   The Contras seem unprepared to handle a peace process; rifts
within their ranks between those who want to fight and those who
are willing to discuss a poltical settlement have left the rebels
in disarray.
   An impasse has developed in El Salvador, where cancer-stricken
President Jose Napoleon Duarte has called upon leftist rebel groups
to lay down their weapons after eight years of guerrilla war and
join the constitutional process of government.
   In Guatemala, the peace plan stalled when the Guatemalan Workers
Party, the political front for leftist rebels, declared a
government general amnesty offer ``unacceptable.''
