<LEADPARA>  A majority of Americans believe the United States ended the war with Iraq too
soon but fewer than half are in favor of aiding the beleaguered rebels
attempting to overthrow President Saddam Hussein, according to a new
Washington Post-ABC News Poll.;    Few Americans favor resuming bombing or the
ground war to aid the rebels and seven out of 10 people questioned said they
approved of the way President Bush was handling the situation in Iraq.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The latest survey results and follow-up interviews around the country
suggest that no consensus has emerged in support of substantial U.S. aid to
Kurdish and Shiite Muslim rebels. Also, most Americans are comfortable with
Bush's hands-off policy toward the volatile situation in Iraq.;    "Whatever
civil unrest they have over there is their problem, and we shouldn't be
involved," Catherine Ivy, 32, a flight attendant from Kansas City, said
Thursday. "We have enough civil unrest to deal with over here.";    Just over
half of those polled -- 55 percent -- said they believe the United States
should not have ended the war with Saddam still in power. And by 51 percent to
45 percent, those questioned said the United States should not help Kurdish
and Shiite rebels overthrow the Iraqi president.;    Among those who favored
U.S. involvement, most said the United States should attempt to ground or
destroy Iraqi government helicopters. The Bush administration has come under
criticism for allowing the helicopters to fly uncontested under terms of the
temporary cease-fire agreement that prohibited flights by Iraq's military
aircraft.;    But just over half of those who favor helping the rebels would
support a resumption of U.S. bombing strikes against Iraq's military forces,
and only four out of 10 said the United States should resume the ground war.
Those results suggest that fewer than one out of four Americans would support
the resumption of large-scale military action against Iraq.;    Still, many
Americans believe Bush made a mistake in ending the war when he did. "I think
we went halfway, as usual," said Steve Fass, 47, a food operations manager
from Manhattan. "I don't think we should necessarily have done anything with
U.S. forces, but I certainly think it would have been helpful if we didn't
allow him to fly his helicopters. We always get in trouble when we waver."  </TEXT>
