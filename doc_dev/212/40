   A fresh push will likely be made to wrap up negotiations with the
Soviet Union on reducing long-range nuclear weapons. In December,
1987, President Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty which provides for eliminating all U.S. and
Soviet land-based missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   The Bush administration also will closely monitor the moves of
the 12-nation European Economic Community, or Common Market, to form
a single market by the end of 1992. That's when the nations are to
remove many of the trade barriers separating them.
   U.S. officials worry _ despite repeated denials by Europeans _
that the unifying moves will cause Western Europe to turn inward,
possibly erecting barriers to goods from the United States.

   China and the Soviet Union are expected to hold
their first summit in 30 years by mid-1989, ending a rift that
drastically reshaped the strategic thinking of the world powers.
   The Reagan administration stressed it welcomed the easing of
tensions between the two giants and expressed faith in Chinese
assertions they will never return to the relationship of the 1950s
when Beijing was a subservient ally of Moscow.
   But George Bush, a former U.S. ambassador to China, will need to
take a new look at how China figures in American strategic interests
when Mikhail S. Gorbachev's meeting with Deng Xiaoping formally
makes America's ``China card'' obsolete.
   U.S.-Chinese relations based on shared antipathy to Soviet
policies have long been overshadowed by more substantially binding
ties. Total trade for 1988 is expected to reach $12 billion and
continues to grow. U.S. businesses have invested $3 billion in
China's modernization drive. Scientific, military and cultural
exchanges are everyday occurrences, and thousands of Chinese study
at American universities and research centers.
   The Bush administration must decide how far to push China to play
a larger role in ending the war in Cambodia. China provides arms and
political support to the Khmer Rouge, the strongest faction in the
anti-Vietnamese coalition in Cambodia. Vietnam insists the
withdrawal of its troops hinges on assurances the Khmer Rouge,
blamed for the deaths of 1 million Cambodians when they ruled in the
1970s, not return to power.
   The end of the Iran-Iraq War in the Middle East eased
U.S.-Chinese tensions over Chinese arms sales to Iran. However,
China's drive to sell arms in the Third World, including countries
opposed to U.S. interests, could again become an issue in 1989.

   Marked by wars, deep economic problems
and social and political instability, Central America poses new
foreign policy questions for the Bush administration in 1989.
   The president will have to decide if he will continue the Reagan
administration's funding for the Contra rebels in their attempt to
oust the almost 10-year-old leftist Sandinista government in
Nicaragua. Bush, shortly after his election, indicated he might take
a more diplomatic approach with the Sandinistas.
   The majority of the Contras, backed by the United States since
1981, moved into base camps in Honduras in 1988 to receive
U.S.-supplied goods ranging from food to uniforms. Honduras, a
strong U.S. ally, wants the United States to get the rebels out.
   In El Salvador, Marxist-led guerrillas appear more determined
than ever to topple the U.S.-backed government. More than $3 billion
in aid over almost a decade failed to end the war or right the
economy. Presidential elections in March favor the conservative
candidate from the National Republican Alliance, known as Arena.
   The Salvadoran conservatives promised a tougher approach toward
the guerrillas, battling since 1979.
   Honduras and Panama will hold presidential elections in 1989.
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian strongman, could run and
win, putting the Bush administration in the position of dealing with
an elected leader who has been indicted on drug charges in the
United States.
   In Guatemala, a civil war with Marxist guerrillas simmers. The
democratically elected government will face continued pressures from
the ultra-conservative sector not to go soft on communism.

   South America's crushing foreign debt and
a firmly entrenched cocaine industry will pose tough challenges for
the new U.S. administration in 1989 and years go come.
   The foreign liabilities of South American nations surpass $250
billion and show no signs of shrinking. Several of the biggest
debtor countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Peru, spent 1988
struggling with stagnant economies, soaring inflation and spreading
social turmoil.
   Shackled by huge debt obligations, their governments are looking
north for reduced interest rates and other forms of financial
relief. It would be proof, they contend, that the United States and
other wealthy countries are sincere in their pledge to back the
continent's young and increasingly troubled democracies.
   Few South Americans expect any radical change in U.S. policy when
George Bush takes office, however. His secretary of state, former
Treasury chief James Baker, proposed three years ago a program of
new credits that debtor countries said did not go far enough.
   The billion-dollar cocaine business also is seen as endangering
the stability of some South American countries, including Colombia,
Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. Despite the arrest of some kingpins and
seizures of tons of drugs, traffickers have remained largely immune
to law enforcement efforts by bribing, intimidating and even killing
public officials.
   During his campaign, Bush vowed an all-out war on narcotics
traffickers, saying he was willing to send U.S. troops into foreign
countries that wanted help battling drug production.

   Among Caribbean nations, Haiti poses
one of the most difficult problems the Bush administration is likely
to deal with.
   U.S. officials say they are encouraged by democratic reforms
undertaken by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril since he assumed Haiti's
presidency in a military coup Sept. 17.
   He has installed a mostly civilian Cabinet, purged the army of
scores of notoriously corrupt officers and stepped up cooperation
with the United States in reducing drug-trafficking through Haiti.
   At stake is $70 million in direct U.S. economic aid suspended by
Congress after abortive presidential elections in November 1987 in
which paramilitary thugs massacred at least 34 people at polling
stations.
   Bush must decide whether to recommend a resumption of aid in
hopes of keeping Avril in power long enough to make good on his
promise of democracy, or to await further reforms.
   Elsewhere in the Caribbean, the United States will be watching
for signs of a shift in Cuban-Soviet relations in view of Fidel
Castro's lack of enthusiasm for Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call for more
openness and economic enterprise.
   Bush can expect continued improvement in relations with Guyana,
as President Desmond Hoyte seeks Western aid in dealing with the
non-aligned nation's grave economic plight. A U.S. military aid team
is to begin work in Guyana this spring.
   In Jamaica, Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who is staunchly
pro-United States, faces a tough challenge from former Prime
Minister Michael Manley, a socialist, in elections expected early
this year.
