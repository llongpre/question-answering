<LEADPARA>  For the first time since the Vietnam War ended 16 years ago, U.S. military
experts Wednesday began an investigation in Cambodia to try to account for
missing U.S. servicemen.;    The investigation is focusing on claims, some of
them based on photographs, that U.S. servicemen have been seen alive since the
war ended in 1975, said Gloria Berbena, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in
Bangkok.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Cambodia has denied that any U.S. servicemen are in the country.;    "This
is the first time a team has been allowed in," Berbena said.;    Team to stay
five days;    The team, which flew to Phnom Penh from Bangkok, will stay about
five days.;    Instances of U.S. cooperation with the Vietnamese-installed
communist government in Cambodia have been extremely rare. Berbena said Phnom
Penh approved an investigation after a U.S. deputy assistant secretary of
state, Kenneth Quinn, met with Cambodian officials earlier this month in
Beijing and Laos.;    Berbena said the team will investigate a highly
publicized photograph showing three men in a wooded setting holding a cryptic
sign. Five families of missing Americans have said their relatives are in the
photograph.;    U.S. told photograph a fake;    Quinn sought information on
the photograph in Vietnam and Laos last week, and Vietnamese officials told
him it was a fake.;    Last week, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft
said that there is "no credible evidence" U.S. servicemen are being held
captive in Vietnam and that the photograph appears to be fabricated.;    A
total of 2,273 Americans are listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War.
Of the 83 missing in Cambodia, most are airmen.;    Many were on U.S. planes
that bombed Cambodia's portion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which North Vietnam
used to infiltrate South Vietnam.;    The Vietnam War ended in 1975, and the
Communists took power. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and installed the
current government in Phnom Penh.  </TEXT>
