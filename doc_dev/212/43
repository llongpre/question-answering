   The United States warned Vietnam Monday that
resisting the major-power formula for ending the Cambodian civil
war endorsed by the United Nations would hurt its prospects for
normal diplomatic relations with the United States.
   `Hanoi's own interests ... would be best served by supporting
rather than resisting the progress made toward a Cambodian
settlement,'' Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon told a
subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee
   Although Vietnam has made some statements expressing willingness
to support the U.N.-backed formula, ``other statements are at best
ambiguous or put forward positions in basic opposition,'' Solomon
told the subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs.
   Solomon said Hanoi should ``reexamine its position'' and
influence the Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia to accept
the settlement drafted by the United States, Soviet Union, China,
Britain and France, the five permament U.N. Security Council
members, and recently endorsed by the Council and General Assembly.
   In answer to questions, Solomon said it was ``inconceivable''
that the Bush administration would normalize relations with Vietnam
or the government in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, if the U.N. peace plan
is scuttled.
   American business groups have been pressing for ending the U.S.
trade embargo against Vietnam. Hanoi has sought normalization to
bolster its weak economy. Solomon reaffirmed the U.S.
``long-standing policy that normalization of relations with Vietnam
can occur only in the context of an acceptable comprehensive
settlement of the Cambodian conflict.''
   The hearing heard Solomon's assessments of a decline in the
prospects for early peace and prevention of a return to power of
the communist Khmer Rouge, blamed for more than one million
Cambodian deaths in 1975-78.
   ``Unfortunately, the Phonm Penh regime has recently issued a
series of statements opposing basic tenets of the current draft
settlement ... only the Khmer Rouge are likely to benefit'' if the
plan is scuttled, Solomon said.
   Solomon represented the United States in drafting the Big Five
formula providing for a United Nations presence to organize free
elections, temporarily oversee government and disarm the Southeast
Asian country's warring factions.
   Phonm Penh leaders demanded that the U.N. presence last less
than a year and be limited to organizing an election, leaving their
powers unaffected, Solomon said. ``A fair and workable settlement
cannot be achieved on this basis,'' he added.
   ``At worst ... once again in the control of the Khmer Rouge,
Cambodia may yet again be transformed into an Asian Auschwitz,''
said subcommittee Chairman Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-NY, referring to
the notorious Nazi extermination camp where millions perished in
World War II.
   ``Unfortunately, there appears a very real reason to believe
this (plan) may not be accepted,'' he added, referring to
disagreement among the Cambodian factions and the recent statements
from Phonm Penh. Even at best, Solarz said, Cambodia could ``end up
like the Lebanon of Southeast Asia.''
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kenneth Quinn said the Khmer
Rouge were ``regaining some popularity'' using Cambodian animosity
against the Vietnamese as a guerrilla recruiting tool. With time on
the side of the Khmer Rouge, Hanoi and Phomh Penh could serve their
own interests by accepting a settlement providing for
internationally enforced disarmament, he said.
