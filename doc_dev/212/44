  [Text] The warring parties in the civil war are in a hurry 
to sell the country's natural resources. 
  Near the end of 1992, a reconnaissance plane from the UN's 
Cambodia operation filmed from the air the Pailin area, which is 
controlled by the Khmer Rouge. The film was so shocking that the 
UN declared it secret. 
  The guerrillas had raped all of western Cambodia. Hills had 
been turned into open mines, from where precious stones had been 
taken to Thailand. The remaining trees had been felled and 
dragged across the border, without any attempt to spare the 
ground vegetation. 
  In Cambodia, peace and capitalism have been able to achieve, 
in one and a half years what war and communism were unable to do 
in two decades; the country's unique natural resources are 
teetering on the brink of an ecological catastrophe. 
  The warring parties of the Cambodian civil war are the 
people 
behind the deforestation. In 1991, after peace had been reached, 
they hurried to sell the natural resources of their lands to the 
highest bidders. 
  Thailand and Vietnam, Cambodia's neighbors, were the 
architects of this catastrophe. After they had put an end to 
logging in their own countries, they needed the raw material for 
their rich customer, Japan. 
  The UN development program, UNDP, is attempting to slow the 
destruction through a project that is aiding the government in 
creating a sensible environmental policy. After the UN, Finland 
is the most significant supporter of the project, as it has 
committed itself to a contribution of 340,000 dollars. 
  "Cambodia's problems are frightening," said Mbella Ngongi, 
legal counsel for the project. "Environmental protection is 
something new in this country. Even the cabinet ministers must 
be educated," he added. 
  The task appears hopeless. Starting from scratch, seven 
experts must, in less than a year, teach the Cambodians moral 
values and help them enact laws that would prevent environmental 
destruction. 
  The project's goals are awesome: the enactment of 
environmental laws in a country with only five lawyers; even 
many of the justices on the Supreme Court have no legal 
training. 
  "It's no wonder that they give up their natural resources 
without stopping to ponder the consequences of such insanity," 
said one UN official, who asked to remain anonymous. 
  In many areas, the destruction has been so reckless that 
refugees, returning after 10 years from Thailand, have been 
unable to recognize their native region. 
  During the 13-year-long civil war, the Phnom Penh 
government, 
which enjoyed the support of Vietnam, cut down forests in order 
to chase the Khmer Rouge out in the open. The guerrillas escaped 
and the timber was taken to Vietnam. 
  Logging operations accelerated in October 1991, when the 
four 
parties in the civil war signed a peace accord in Paris. 
  "In Cambodia, in a year and a half, all natural resources, 
both used and unused, ended up being controlled by foreigners," 
as the newspaper, PHNOM PENH POST, stated last summer. 
  Cambodia's neighbors need lumber. Thailand put a stop to 
logging in 1989. Laos put restraints on logging operations in 
the summer of 1991. Vietnam outlawed lumber exports in the 
spring of 1992. 
  "Cambodia was easy prey for its neighbors," said UNDP's 
lawyer, Ngong. "A civil servant earned 10 dollars a months. He 
could not believe his ears when he was offered millions just for 
tree trunks," he added. 
  In 1992, 1.5 million cubic meters was exported from 
Cambodia. 
More than half of this was transported illegally to Thailand and 
Vietnam. 
  Everyone sold logs: Khmer Rouge, the Cambodian Peoples' 
Party, which formerly led the communists, and FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia], who was loyal to King Sihanouk. 
  "We have enough forests to use," said Deputy Finance 
Minister 
Mok Mareth. "All of Cambodian is green." 
  Mareth is currently under secretary in charge of 
environmental affairs. 
  Log exports were temporarily stopped in January 1993. 
According to the UN, during the first five months of the 
moratorium, the prohibition was violated 103 times -- at a value 
of 7.2 million dollars. 
  According to Ngong, the problem is that everyone wants to 
get 
rich fast, and they are all blinded by quick profits. 
  The government parties have not stated how they intend to 
combat the ecological catastrophe. And that is not surprising, 
as soldiers from Cambodia's new army stand guard in the log 
yards of Thai companies, during forest auctions.
