<LEADPARA>  THERE ARE, they say, 7,000 people living in thatched shelters or with no
shelter at all here in the middle of what we would call nowhere, dry and dusty
fields 40 miles southwest of Phnom Penh. They are women and children, widows
and orphans. Most Cambodians are, because the men are at war or were killed in
the murderous years of Khmer Rouge rule.;    They are, officially, "displaced
persons," Cambodians moved by government troops from mountain villages in
areas now controlled, more or less, by the Khmer Rouge. This camp, as it is
called, a hot, miserable place of diseased water and not enough to eat, is
surrounded by land mines, little Chinese ones, smaller than cans of tuna.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Who laid the mines? Are they there to keep the Khmer Rouge out or to keep
these people in? Are these people here for their protection? Or are they here
to keep them from growing rice that might be used to feed Khmer Rouge
guerrillas? Who knows? Certainly not American visitors.;    This is just
another fetid pool in the landscape of misery that is Cambodia -- and has been
Cambodia since it became a killing ground in the 1960s because it was a weak
little country that happened to be in the geographical embrace of Vietnam
during that country's civil war.;    The numbers compiled by international
organizations and the current government seem more precise than they ever
could be, but you get the general idea: From 1969 to 1974, the Americans
dropped 539,129 tons of bombs on "Vietnamese targets" in this country; from
1975 to 1979, Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge destroyed 1,200 villages, 5,857
schools, 796 hospitals and clinics, 1,968 pagodas, 1,008 factories, and killed
or drove away 3,314,786 people.;    Civil war began here in 1970 with the
overthrow of Prince Sihanouk, a military coup backed by the United States. It
continues, and there is a significant chance that the Khmer Rouge, with
Chinese backing and indirect U.S. help, will regain power.;    Cambodia is
broken, smashed. The Khmer Rouge emptied Phnom Penh, dismantled the Roman
Catholic cathedral and turned the National Library into a pig farm. Savagery,
war, and economic sanctions by the United States and United Nations, both
protesting Vietnamese invasion and occupation in 1979, have left it one of the
poorest countries in the world -- with shattered roads and irrigation canals,
without electricity, clean water and medicine. The gross national product,
another estimate, is half what it was in 1968. There were 45 doctors left in
the country after the Khmer Rouge killed all the educated people it could find
in a drive to return the country to preindustrial simplicity.;    There is,
for all practical purposes, no hard currency in the country, though people do
trade in gold and precious stones. What the government can get it uses to buy
weaponry, but it is getting less and less from its two patrons, the Vietnamese
and the Soviets, each with their own problems. There is only nine months'
worth of food produced and donated to the country each year, according to the
World Food Program, and people survive by eating leaves, roots and insects.;  
 But they do survive. Cambodians have seen death -- people regularly break
down without warning and tell you how they lost their families in the Pol Pot
years -- and they worship life. They are having children as fast as they can,
even if that means a de facto polygamy because there are so few men
available.;    Though there are still few such spectacular luxuries as Honda
motor scooters in Phnom Penh, the symbol of life and hope in the city is one
of them with a man driving, a child standing on the floor in front of him,
another child behind him on the seat, and his wife sitting sidesaddle over the
back wheel with an infant at her breast. The Hondas, smuggled into the country
from Thailand, surrounded by bicycles and three-wheeled, pedal-driven
rickshaws called "cyclos," actually caused a traffic jam, the first in years
and years, on Jan. 7, the 12th anniversary of the day the Vietnamese drove out
the Khmer Rouge.;    Caught in the middle, in a cyclo, I had trouble
remembering that these people are officially my enemies. But they are,
classified as such by the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917. That American
law and its sanctions and embargoes, imposed by American officials who think
the Vietnam War is not over, will be partly to blame if the Khmer Rouge is
able to come back to power and destroy the lives of the people who were around
me that night -- and that could happen.  </TEXT>
