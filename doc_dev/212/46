   Cambodia, a nation ravaged by war and
revolution for the past 20 years, is again facing severe food
shortages because of increased fighting, drought and floods, United
Nations officials say.
   Some refugees who say they cannot grow rice are among the
roughly 20,000 Cambodians who fled west to guerrilla-controlled
camps in Thailand this year. Thousands of others went east to areas
under government control.
   Government officials in Phnom Penh expect that Cambodia's 8
million people will be shot about 100,000 tons of rice in 1991, or
three times the official deficit for this year, Scott Leiper of the
U.N. World Food Program told donor countries at a Dec. 18 meeting.
   ``The situation is causing concern,'' said S.A.M.S. Kibria, the
U.N. secretary-general's special representative for Cambodian aid
programs.
   ``From all indications the food situation had improved over the
last couple of years,'' he said in an interview Monday. ``This
year, because of the fighting, a lot of the land was left
uncultivated. Secondly, the rainfall both in terms of quantity and
timing was not right.''
   Another major factor, he said, was that the Soviets have stopped
providing fertilizer as a result of their general disengagement
from Cambodia.
   Cambodia had been getting about 50,000 tons of fertilizer
annually, but only a fifth of that amount was available for the
1990 wet season crop, Leiper said.
   The Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh is battling
three guerrilla groups, and fighting has spread since the
Vietnamese troop pullout that began in September 1989.
   Each year, combat intensifies during the dry season that has
just begun.
   The U.N. Security Council has drawn up a peace plan to end the
civil war in Cambodia, but representatives of the warring factions
failed during talks in Paris last weekend to agree on all parts of
the plan.
   Millions died in Cambodia in the 1970-75 civil war, the 1975-78
bloody rule of the communist Khmer Rouge, and in the fighting since
late 1978 when invading Vietnamese troops drove the Khmer Rouge
into the jungles.
   Western isolation of the communist Phnom Penh government has
kept the country impoverished.
   Leiper, head of the World Food Program's Phnom Penh office, told
the donor countries that the shortages are expected to hit hardest
in southwestern Kampot and Kompongspeu provinces, which have
suffered ``alarming'' food shortages due to drought the past two
years.
   They are expected to face a combined food deficit of 44,000 tons
of rice in 1991 - about 40 percent of the total nationwide deficit.
   Leiper said prolonged drought in many areas of the central and
southeastern provinces has reduced the area planted, and flooding
in the west and the fighting has also reduced cultivation.
   Cambodia's official SPK news agency recently said drought and
floods had destroyed more than half the cultivated area in the
central province of Kompong Thom.
   It said the average yield was expected to drop by a third
compared to last year in the northwestern province of Battambang, a
main agricultural region, due to bad weather and guerilla
harassment.
   Leiper also requested aid for the 130,000 people, many living in
dire conditions, who have been displaced in government-held
territory this past year. Getting them food, he said, has been
hampered by shortages of trucks and fuel, and the country's
battered infrastructure.
   International aid officials say about 90 percent of these people
had fled the fighting in the western provinces of Battambang and
Banteay Meanchey.
   The World Food Program moved cautiously in appealing for aid
because some of the other refugees, in Kompongspeu and Kompong
Chhnang provinces, said the government had moved them out of their
villages because of guerrilla infiltration.
   At the donor meeting, Sweden pledged $6.6 million for aid inside
Cambodia. The United States pledged $10 million and the European
Community $6 million to help about 300,000 refugees in Thai border
camps controlled by the guerrillas.
