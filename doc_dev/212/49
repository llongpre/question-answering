<TEXT>     Hours before he spoke, relief workers and the military wing of the Khmer
People's National Liberation Front, one of the guerrilla factions, accused
Phnom Penh government forces of shelling several positions in northwestern
Cambodia.;   In Paris, hundreds of Cambodian exiles cheered Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, who will head an interim Cambodian government, as he arrived to sign
the treaty intended to end 20 years of bloodshed and civil war.;   Waving
banners reading "Peace in Cambodia," the throng greeted Sihanouk with cheers
and applause as he arrived at a conference center a few hours before the
signing ceremony.;   Secretary of State James Baker, among those attending the
ceremony, said earlier today the U.N.-sponsored peace treaty for Cambodia
cannot guarantee lasting peace but would give "great hope.";   Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen, whose Vietnamese-installed government is one of four
Cambodian factions signing the accord, said he "shared the joy of the
Cambodian people.";   But he accused the Khmer Rouge, the hard-line communists
whose rule from 1975 to 1978 led to the deaths of 1 million people, of
"creating new problems" that he did not specify.;   Hun Sen claimed that
Cambodian police would be able to guarantee Sihanouk's security when he
returns to Phnom Penh on Nov. 14 as leader of the Supreme National Council
that is to shepherd the country toward U.N.-sponsored elections next year.;  
Khieu Samphan, chief delegate for the Khmer Rouge, said that he would return
to Phnom Penh in November as representative of the Khmer Rouge, which forms
part of the council.;   The Paris Conference on Cambodia, which first convened
July 30, 1989, and is co-chaired by France and Indonesia, has been the
framework for negotiations. The signing of the peace treaty was expected this
evening after speeches by each of the arriving ministers.  </TEXT>
