   A dedicated communist who lost an eye
fighting for the Khmer Rouge in the Indochina War, Prime Minister
Hun Sen has emerged as a key figure in resolving Cambodia's civil
war.
   Once dismissed by the West as a puppet of the Vietnamese, Hun Sen
is preparing to run a country that Vietnam promises will be free of
all its troops by Sept. 30.
   In the meantime he has stepped up negotiations with Cambodian
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk and others to end a
guerrilla war that is sapping the country's limited resources and
energy.
   One of world's youngest government heads, the 38-year-old Hun Sen
has impressed diplomats and Western aid officials in Phnom Penh.
   ``He began as a country boy. Now, he's by far the most
intelligent of the lot,'' said a senior Soviet diplomat in Phnom
Penh.
   When this correspondent first interviewed Hun Sen in 1980, his
responses were straight down the Marxist line, and he appeared to
have a poor grasp of issues.
   The Hun Sen of today is said to have picked up an impressive
range of knowledge through late-night study, foreign trips and daily
staff briefings. Aides say he is progressing well in the English,
French and Vietnamese languages.
   He has also picked up on politicking, driving his own car to
villages, listening to farmers' grievances and berating ineffective
officials on frequent inspection tours. He takes time out to play
soccer and volleyball on civil service teams.
   Hun Sen may well be preparing for an election or at least a
popularity contest with Sihanouk, who said in May he might return to
Phnom Penh.
   The prime minister appears to realize that he himself is
handicapped.
   Despite his association with the hated Khmer Rouge, Sihanouk
still commands widespread affection. Especially among older
Cambodians, he remains a father figure who presided over an era of
peace before his ouster by pro-West Cambodians in 1970 and the
apocalyptic events that precipitated.
   Hun Sen, on the other hand, fought with the Khmer Rouge in the
war against U.S.-backed Cambodians and remains a communist in a land
where the ideology was implemented with extreme brutality.
   He has said, however, that communist ideology doesn't sit well
with most Cambodians.
   Thus, Hun Sen has been the key proponent of economic and
political liberalization and Western aid officials say he gets
things done in a government rife with inefficiency and corruption.
He has maintained a clean image and appears to live modestly.
   Hun Sen's formal education stopped after high school when he
joined communist rebels fighting the Phnom Penh government. Some
Western historians say he fled in 1967 but recently he reportedly
told Sihanouk that he joined the guerrillas in 1970 because the
prince himself had sided with the Khmer Rouge and had called for a
war against the U.S.-backed government in Phnom Penh.
   The official biography says Hun Sen was born in the northeastern
province of Kompong Cham. He rose rapidly in Khmer Rouge ranks to
command a division and during an was wounded five times, losing an
eye to an artillery shell April 16, 1975, during an attack on a
government camp in his native province.
   A day later the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh to end the war and
begin a reign of terror. How far, if at all, Hun Sen participated in
Khmer Rouge atrocities is not known.
   Phnom Penh officials play up his early opposition to the the
Khmer Rouge leadership and his defection in 1977 when he and a
number of other commanders fled to the Vietnamese.
   In January, 1979, the Vietnamese entered Phnom Penh and Hun Sen
came out of the jungles to become the youngest _ and perhaps most
inexperienced _ foreign minister in the world. In January 1985 he
was named chairman of the Council of Ministers, or prime minister,
of Cambodia.
