   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
and Cambodian Premier Hun Sen signed a communique today that called
for an end to hostilities but stopped short of announcing a
cease-fire in Cambodia's 11-year-old civil war.
   The powerful communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who are part of a
three-faction rebel coalition Sihanouk heads, boycotted the session.
   The statement said the factions ``should refrain from all
offensive actions'' and there should be measures to ensure a
``military standstill.'' But it said an ``actual cease-fire'' should
be realized through agreement on forming a so-called supreme
national council.
   The council has been proposed as a body joining representatives
of the resistance coalition and the Hanoi-backed Phnom Penh
government. It would administer the country in the period before a
national vote to determine Cambodia's future.
   The communique said a supreme national council should include
equal numbers from the resistance coalition and from the Phnom Penh
government and be formed by the end of July. It mentioned a future
role for the United Nations in monitoring the withdrawal of foreign
forces, the end of foreign military supplies and a cease-fire
agreement.
   The impact of the declaration on fighting in Cambodia was hard to
judge. Combat intensified in the days preceding the Tokyo conference
as the contenders sought to extend their areas of control.
   In Bangkok, Sihanouk spokesman Roland Eng said heavy fighting was
continuing and guerrilla groups had launched offensives in areas
around Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital.
   The Khmer Rouge nominal leader, Khieu Samphan, did not attend the
signing ceremony. He also boycotted the opening session Monday when
the Tokyo peace conference started.
   A statement from the Khmer Rouge was expected later. The group
had said it declined to join the conference unless it was an equal
member, rather than a part of Sihanouk's resistance coalition.
   After the Khmer Rouge boycotted the conference, informal meetings
continued, mostly in the hotel where the guerrilla delegations were
staying. Pressure came from other countries, including China, which
backs the Khmer Rouge; the United States, which backs Sihanouk while
trying to distance itself from the Khmer Rouge; and Thailand,
through which arms flow to the rebels.
   Thailand's deputy prime minister, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who
helped arrange the talks, held separate meetings with Hun Sen and
with Sihanouk's guerrilla factions.
   Chinese Ambassador Yang Zhenya was seen leaving a corridor where
informal talks were held. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
David Lambertson called on Son Sann, the U.S. Embassy said.
Lambertson was in Tokyo for consultations and to observe the
Cambodian talks.
   The less than full success of the meeting seemed certain to
disappoint Japan, which was acting as host to its first
international peace conference since World War II.
   The meeting was heralded as a stepping-stone to a conference set
for Paris in July. Before the Khmer Rouge boycotted, the conference
was expected to be one of the rare instances in which all four
contending factions would be present.
   Sihanouk, 67, had said he intended to sign an agreement with Hun
Sen whether the Khmer Rouge came along or not, but he had to stay a
rocky course to reach that point.
   As he left for the signing ceremony with Son Sann, the
conservative leader of a guerrilla faction in his coalition,
Sihanouk said they had worked hard to move toward peace and
reconciliation ``and I am happy to be able to sign.''
   Son Sann said he had agreed to the arrangement.
   The guerrilla coalition is fighting moderate communist Hun Sen's
government, which was installed by Vietnam in 1979.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and ended the brutal
1975-79 rule of the Khmer Rouge when hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians were killed.
   Hun Sen has refused to negotiate equally with the Khmer Rouge or
allow them an equal role in a future interim government.
   Vietnam says it withdrew all its troops last September, but there
are charges that some remain.
