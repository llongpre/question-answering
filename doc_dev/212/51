   Cambodia's warring factions today held
the first session of a council formed to try to end 11 years of
civil war and argued over the future role of guerrilla leader
Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The Supreme National Council, created last week during talks in
Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, met for three hours at the Cambodian
Embassy. The embassy had been abandoned since 1975, but 100 Thai
workers cleared it of overgrown foliage and repainted it over the
weekend.
   ``There were some problems, and we will have to resume
discussions tomorrow,'' said Premier Hun Sen of the
Vietnamese-installed government. He would not elaborate.
   The council has six seats for the Vietnam-installed Phnom Penh
government and two spots for each of the rebel factions. The plan
also allows for a 13th seat for a chairman, but the post remains in
dispute.
   The guerrillas want Sihanouk to hold the chairman seat. A Thai
Foreign Ministry official said Hun Sen replied that Sihanouk could
only be chairman if he also takes the spot of one of the dozen
regular members.
   Sihanouk officials accused Hun Sen of ``intransigence.''
   The council now includes six representatives of Hun Sen's
government and two representatives from each of the three allied
guerrilla groups.
   Not discussed were other items Hun Sen placed on the agenda:
choosing a delegation to this week's U.N. General Assembly, and
arranging a ``voluntary cease-fire'' and an end to outside military
aid.
   The rebel coalition includes the non-Communist forces of
Sihanouk and former Cambodian premier Son Sann, who have been
backed by Washington, and the Chinese-backed Communist Khmer Rouge,
ousted by the Vietamese in 1978.
   During nearly four years in power, the Khmer Rouge tried to
transform Cambodia into a radical agrarian society, resulting in
the deaths of nearly 1 million people.
   The Supreme National Council would cede much of its authority to
the United Nations, which would administer the country until free
elections. U.N. officials have said up to 20,000 troops and
civilian personnel could be sent to Cambodia to oversee the plan.
   The U.N. plan, which also calls for disarming the four armies,
was adopted Aug. 28 by the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council: the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain
and France.
   Hun Sen met in the session with Khieu Samphan of the Khmer
Rouge, Son Sann of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front and
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who commands forces loyal to Sihanouk,
his father.
   The sparsely furnished meeting room was decorated with fresh
flowers and photographs of Cambodia, including one of Angkor Wat,
ancient capital of its greatest civilization.
