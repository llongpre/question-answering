   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
take up with his Soviet counterpart hints from Moscow of a
readiness to make a deal aimed at ending the 12-year-old civil war
in Afghanistan, an administration official said Tuesday.
   But the official disputed a report from Moscow by ABC News that
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Baker already
had cut a deal.
   Baker leaves Wednesday on a four-nation trip to Asia. He is
scheduled to meet Shevardnadze in the Soviet Siberian city of
Irkutsk on Aug. 1.
   The Soviets have not yet conveyed to the United States how
Afghan President Najibullah might be removed from power in Kabul,
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   For weeks the Bush administration has hoped for a breakthrough
to end to war between Afghan government forces armed by the Soviet
Union and a guerrilla coalition fighting with American-supplied
weapons funnelled through Pakistan.
   But the Soviets failed this month to send a delegation to
Washington for talks on the major obstacle to a settlement based on
a cease-fire and elections _ that is, when Najibullah should yield
power. Both sides already have reached a tacit agreement that
Najibullah would play no role in the new government and would step
down at some point before his successor take over.
   ``The Soviets hinted at a deal; they haven't fleshed it out,''
the official said. ``The thread of the deal is going to be pursued
in Irkutsk by Baker.''
   Administration officials did not find fault with Moscow for not
sending the delegation to Washington. They said they thought the
Kremlin was simply preoccupied with the 28th Communist Party
Congress at the time.
   But when Baker saw Shevardnadze in Paris last Wednesday, again
there was no major development on the Afghan front, the official
said.
   The Soviet Union installed the Najibullah government in 1979,
but the government in Kabul has been unable to impose its will on
the countryside. The Soviets withdrew their troops last year but
continued arms supply.
   Both superpowers have grown weary of the effort to defeat the
other side's client in Afghanistan. The Senate Intelligence
Committee, according to congressional sources, reflected this
disenchantment Tuesday in voting for a cut about $100 million in
the current $300 million annual aid for Afghan rebels.
   In a report attributed to unspecified western diplomatic
sources, ABC said the Baker-Shevardnadze agreement called for an
end to arms supplies for both sides. The United States had
abandoned its position that Najibullah must go.
   The official who spoke with The Associated Press called the
network report ``premature.''
   The 2\-hour Paris meeting was dominated by Cambodia. Afterward,
Baker, announced that the United States had withdrawn its
diplomatic support from a rebel coalition that included the Khmer
Rouge and would hold talks with Vietnam, supporter of the
government in Phnom Penh and an ally of the Soviet Union.
   The State Department announced Tuesday that Kenneth Quinn, a
deputy assistant secretary, will meet with Vietnam's ambassador to
the United Nations in New York on Aug. 6.
   On his Asia trip Baker will also attend a meeting of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Indonesia; hold talks in
Singapore and visit to outer Mongolia after seeing Shevardnadze.
