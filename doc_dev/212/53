   Here is a chronological look at key events in the 11-year-old
Cambodian civil war:
   _On Christmas Day 1978, Vietnamese tanks roll in to start
Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and war with its former Communist
ally, the Khmer Rouge.
   _On Jan. 7, 1979, the Vietnamese march into the Cambodian
capital, Phnom Penh. The strike is so swift the Khmer Rouge leaves
behind half-eaten meals and tons of arms as they flee.
   
   _On Jan. 10, 1979, a new Communist government is proclaimed. It
is led by Heng Samrin and other Khmer Rouge defectors who had fled
to Vietnam, fearing the previous government's bloody purges. But
sanctuary from Thailand and arms from China soon raise the Khmer
Rouge into a potent guerrilla insurgency.
   _In January-February 1979, China wages a border war against
Vietnam to ``punish'' it for the invasion of Cambodia.
   
   _In June 1982, the Khmer Rouge, the forces of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and those of former Premier Son Sann form a resistance
coalition. The United Nations recognizes it as Cambodia's
government. _In March 1985, Vietnamese forces, allied to the
government in Phnom Penh, overrun every major border camp in their
greatest victory of the war.
   _In July 1987, Sihanouk holds peace talks in France with Phnom
Penh's Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   
   _On Dec. 19, 1988, Premier Li Peng says China will decrease its
aid to the resistance as Vietnam withdraws from Cambodia. He says
China will halt all aid when the troops are gone.
   
   _In December 1988, Vietnam begins its pullout of an estimated
50,000 troops.
   _In January 1989, Vietnam sends a senior official to Beijing to
discuss the conflict. The two sides agree that Vietnam will
withdraw its troops by September in exchange for an end to Chinese
aid to the guerrillas.
   _In July 1989, a 19-nation conference on Cambodia opens in
Paris. Sihanouk calls for an interim government with Khmer Rouge
participation. Hun Sen opposes the idea.
   _In September 1989, Vietnam says it has withdrawn its last
troops. Guerrillas call it a sham and begin a general offensive.
China calls the pullout a fraud and indicates it will continue
arming the guerrillas until there is a political settlement.
   _On Sept. 30, 1989, non-communist guerrillas seize the district
seat of Thmar Puok near the Thai border. They make their greatest
gains in the war in the coming months.
   _On Feb. 11-13, 1990, the U.N. Security Council's permanent
members say regrouping the Cambodian armies into designated areas
is essential to the peace process. But they fail to agree on
proposals to disarm the factions. Sihanouk and Hun Sen hold talks
in Bangkok, Thailand. They agree on the need for a U.N. presence in
Cambodia and a ``supreme national body'' to government the country.
   _In April, Sihanouk urges an immediate cease-fire. He says the
U.N. Security Council should deploy peacekeeping troops to enforce
it.
   _In June, Cambodian guerrillas launch major attacks and seize
areas of several provinces as Cambodia's warring factions prepare
to meet to discuss a cease-fire. Chinese, Thai and U.S. officials
join attempts to foster progress in peace talks stalled by the
Khmer Rouge's refusal to attend.
   _In July, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker announces that
Washington is withdrawing diplomatic recognition of the resistance
coalition because it includes the Khmer Rouge.
   _On Sept. 5, Baker announces the United States will open direct
talks for the first time with Hun Sen's government. The first talks
are held the next day.
   _On Sept. 10, warring parties agree to a U.N. peace plan to end
the 11-year-old war. They agree to share power on an interim
Supreme National Council until elections can be held. A cease-fire
remains to be worked out.
