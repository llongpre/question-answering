   Hopes that Liberia's bloody civil
war would end with a quick victory over President Samuel Doe have
vanished as rebels hungry for power and vengeance fight among
themselves.
   Rebel leader Charles Taylor, who had bragged in interviews that
he would chase Doe from his presidential mansion in the Liberian
capital, Monrovia, remains bogged down in fighting six miles away.
   Fighters loyal to Prince Johnson, who split with Taylor three
months ago, have fought their way into the city center, where Doe
remains in his fortified Israeli-built mansion, guarded by loyal
troops. Doe has refused to resign.
   At one stage in the siege of the capital, the rebels suddenly
withdrew from their positions around Monrovia, reportedly because
Johnson's forces had attacked Taylor's men.
   ``Doe does not want to relinquish power. Charles Taylor wants
power at all cost. Prince Johnson wants to get rid of both,'' said
a senior Western diplomat who has been monitoring reports on the
fighting from his Monrovia embassy.
   Liberia's 2.4 million people are the big losers. Since the civil
war began the vast majority of casualities have been civilians.
   Doe's soldiers began the slaughter in northern Nimba County,
where 100 rebels invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast on Christmas
Eve.
   Angry at their inability to halt the rebel advance, frustrated
troops turned on civilians of the Gio and Mano tribes, killing,
raping, looting and setting homes ablaze. The two tribes form the
main support base for the rebels.
   Initially, the guerrillas did not attack civilians and appeared
to be ``the good guys'' in a battle against a corrupt and
nepotistic government that brutally suppressed opposition. But this
lasted only as long as they were moving through through territory
populated by tribes friendly to their cause.
   As soon as the rebels advanced southward into territory
populated by tribes that backed Doe, reports of the murder of
civilians began to emerge. Most of those killed were members of
Doe's tribe, the Krahn, or the Mandigo tribe, which also backs the
government.
   Monday morning, government troops went on a rampage inside a
refugee center in the capital and carried out one of the worst
known massacres of the war. Survivors said 600 people, mostly women
and children who had been trying to flee the violence, were killed.
The U.S. State Department put the casualties at 200.
   The victims were from the Gio and Mano tribes.
   Doe denied reponsibility for the church atrocity and said it was
carried out by rebels dressed in army uniforms. But survivors said
they were attacked by soldiers speaking Krahn.
   The standoff in Monrovia bears an eerie resemblance to the 1985
coup attempt led by Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa. The general, whose
forces included Johnson, took the entire city of Monrovia by
surprise.
   But Doe and his troops emerged from the mansion and killed them.
   Soldiers subsequently killed thousands of Gios and Manos in
Nimba County, setting the stage for the rebel invasion late last
year.
   For a time it appeared the rebels would quickly take Monrovia.
Western diplomats in the capital, whose governments had switched
sides and now opposed the president, told reporters Doe's soldiers
would flee at the first sight of rebels.
   That was six weeks ago.
   Instead, Taylor's National Patriotic Front has been unable to
break the remnants of Doe's 72nd Infantry Battalion.
   As Taylor remained bogged down outside Monrovia, Johnson's men
waded through a swamp last week to launch a surprise attack on
Doe's forces in downtown Monrovia.
   The arrival of Johnson's men dashed hopes of a simple ending to
the war.
   Taylor accused Johnson of being a tool of the United States,
which he said was trying to stop him from taking power. Johnson
said Taylor was a Communist on Libya's payroll.
   Taylor is of mixed Americo-Liberian and native African ancestry.
The Americos, descendants of freed American slaves who founded the
country, ruled Liberia until Doe took power in a 1980 coup.
   Doe's coup was hailed throughout the country because it ended
the domination and subjugation of native Liberians by Americos who,
like Doe's Krahn people, constitute only 5 percent of the
population.
   Johnson is the son of Gio parents, and there were fears the
ethnic background of the two men could lead to a new war.
