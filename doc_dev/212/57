<TEXT>     But Kosal carried a letter -- from a soldier presumed dead to a wife ever
hopeful -- that would shatter the calm of the setting.;   "I have missed you
so much . . .," it began.;   Kosal is a professional "tracer" in a country
where tens of thousands of people are still missing from the genocidal reign
of the Khmer Rouge and the dozen years of civil war that followed.;   In the
United States, a now-discredited photograph purporting to show three U.S.
veterans missing in action and still alive somewhere in Indochina touched off
the most recent wave of MIA fever.;   In Cambodia, the issue of missing
soldiers and relatives -- partly an outgrowth of America's war in Vietnam --
remains an achingly mundane fact of life for thousands.;    THE LETTER Kosal
was carrying came from Soung Sakhorn, a former Cambodian army soldier captured
by guerrillas three years ago and now living in the Sok Sann refugee camp in
Thailand.;   Three pictures were attached to the letter, along with a tracing
request the soldier had filed with the Red Cross in Bangkok, which channeled
it to Phnom Penh. The request listed his wife, Soeng Tha Vy, as the primary
"person sought.";   She was not home when the letter arrived. She was in Phnom
Penh buying vegetables to sell in the market here. Still, a crowd murmuring
with excitement soon gathered around the Red Cross official and the village
chief who had directed him to the bamboo house.;   The soldier's daughter
stared at one of the pictures of her long-lost father, looking rather glum in
the photo. His mother-in-law wiped tears from her eyes.;   "I have missed you
so much, during the five years I have been separated from you," the soldier
wrote his wife. "At this time I am free to write this to you with three
photographs telling you of the place where I am living. Don't worry about me.
But I am always worried about all of you. If you are well, I will be very
delighted, because you, my dear, are the apple of my eye.";   Between 1 and 2
in the afternoon, the Voice of the People broadcasts radio announcements from
Cambodians looking for lost family members. State-run television does the same
at 6 in the evening.;   Many of the announcements have been placed by former
Cambodian refugees, who are coming back from the West in ever-increasing
numbers to conduct their own searches.;   Tracing requests, meanwhile,
continue to pour in at a rate of 600 to 800 a month at the Red Cross regional
headquarters in Bangkok, mostly from Cambodians still stuck in refugee camps
on the Thai-Cambodian border. Typically, more than 100 of those requests are
forwarded each month to the Red Cross in Phnom Penh.;   About the only hopeful
thing to be said is that many of those looking for relatives find them, making
the situation far different from that in the United States, where few experts
believe that any of 2,273 Vietnam War-era MIAs are still alive.;   The reason
the search here continues lies in the particular horror of the Cambodian
diaspora, which separated countless families from the moment Khmer Rouge
leader Pol Pot's communist fanatics marched into Phnom Penh in April 1975 and
began the forced relocation of Cambodia's entire population.;   While most
families were separated during the Khmer Rouge reign of terror, the case of
the soldier whose letter Kosal carried to the bamboo house shows how the
nightmare has continued long after Pol Pot fell in 1979.;   GENOCIDE, at that
point, gave way to civil war, as the Khmer Rouge and two other non-communist
guerrilla factions retreated to the border and began a conflict that only
ended in May with an unofficial cease-fire.;   The case of the missing soldier
also illustrates why tracing requests filed by those in border camps often end
in success. Cambodians have strong attachments to their native villages, in
most cases returning there no matter how far away the Khmer Rouge may have
dragged them.;   In the soldier's case, Kosal knew that the precise home
address spelled a good chance for success. Indeed, the soldier's family was
right where he last saw them five years ago.;   Many Cambodian refugees living
in the West also have had good success locating family members or determining
their fate by sending letters or emissaries back to native villages, where
someone often knew what became of them or where they were.;   Kosal waited on
the porch of the bamboo house as the village chief did the honors of writing a
reply to the soldier on the border, which the Red Cross would swiftly mail
back to him.;   The chief, Phon Van Than, worked ploddingly on the reply, like
a grammar school student carefully forming big block letters.;   But the
chief's hand turned out to be sure -- it was the sentiment that took him so
long to create, writing the letter as though it were from Soeng herself.;  
Finally, he finished. He looked pleased.;   "I am very happy to learn that you
are alive and well," the reply began. "The family is well here, so you mustn't
be worried. I had heard of your death, but I never believed it. I always
thought you were alive. At last, we are very happy and I wish to meet you at
once.";   "With great wishes," the letter ends. "From the apple of your eye."  </TEXT>
