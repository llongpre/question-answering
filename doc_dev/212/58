Compromise</HEAD>

   The Vietnam-backed government,
having passed a crucial battlefield test, appears more entrenched
domestically and may make fewer compromises in negotiations to end
the 11-year-old civil war.
   The avowed September pullout of Vietnam's forces left the
untested and jittery Phnom Penh government facing a three-party
guerrilla coalition that includes the powerful Khmer Rouge.
   Initially, the Chinese-armed guerrillas made headway in
northwest Cambodia. But as the monsoon season approaches, signaling
a slowdown in fighting, the tide appears to have turned.
   The Khmer Rouge has failed to take the northwest's major city,
Battambang. The U.S.-backed Khmer People's National Liberation
Front is suffering sharp setbacks, and troops loyal to overall
coalition chief Prince Norodom Sihanouk have yet to make
significant gains.
   Although Vietnam's reinvolvement is denied by Phnom Penh, the
change of fortune appears at least in part to have been due to the
return of some Vietnamese troops. This has not, however, detracted
from the confidence evident among Cambodian government officials.
   ``I think they're feeling pretty good about themselves. They've
surprised themselves,'' said one Western aid official who requested
anonymity. ``They're concerned about the future, but they think
they have compromised as much as they will, can and need to.''
   Knowledgeable diplomats caution about predictions for this
volatile, tragic country, but sketch one possible scenario that
sees Phnom Penh trying, while coping with the civil war, to slowly
improve economic conditions and deepen political control.
Eventually, it would gain international recognition and aid.
   Few nations now recognize Phnom Penh, but lower-level contacts
have intensified. In recent months, Phnom Penh has hosted British
and Australian officials as well as former U.S. Secretary of State
Edmund Muskie, who called for changes in Washington's hostile
policy toward Indochina.
   Officials in this capital deny military successes will harden
their stance at the conference table, saying the draining ``half
war, half peace'' that exists is unacceptable.
   ``Look around you at this rundown country,'' said Pong Peng
Cheng, a senior advisor to Prime Minister Hun Sen. ``How can you
have development when war remains the top priority, when 40 to 50
percent of the budget goes to the military?''
   To date, round after round of negotiations _ in Paris, Jakarta
and Bangkok _ have failed despite a stack of peace plans and active
participation by the world's major powers.
   A major obstacle to peace is the future role of the Khmer Rouge,
widely detested for its 1975-78 reign of terror when hundreds of
thousands of people were killed. But non-Cambodian diplomats
involved in the negotiations also say leaders of the warring
parties, including Hun Sen and Sihanouk, are wary of making
concessions that could dissipate the power they now wield.
   Each leadership group, the diplomats say, is gauging whether it
could win a free election or a tussle for power in Phnom Penh
should some kind of political solution be reached.
   The Hun Sen government would have major handicaps at the polls.
It is communist in a country which has suffered the most radical of
communist revolutions. It is tainted by growing corruption, which
is admitted by officials and criticized with increasing vehemence
by ordinary Cambodians.
   On the positive side, the government follows liberal economic
policies and last year allowed peasants to own plots of land.
Recent rice harvests have been good, with Western aid sources
estimating the country will face a 30,000-ton food deficit in 1990
_ far less than in the earlier years.
   Un Buntha, a vice director in the planning ministry, said that
despite the continuing conflict, Cambodia's gross national product
increased by an estimated nine percent last year and further growth
was anticipated.
   But he admitted that the outside investment needed to revive
Cambodia's shattered infrastructure was not forthcoming. ``The
foreigners are hesitating because they are afraid of the war and we
do not yet have regulations and guarantees for investors,'' he said
in an interview.
   A major Phnom Penh asset may be its enemy. ``If it wasn't for
the Khmer Rouge, this government would have a very hard time
mobilizing the people. But with them out there, they don't need
much more,'' said an international aid agency official.
   The war, however, exacts a hefty price which may move the
government towards political compromise. Observers say the mass
conscription of young men, the villages of widows and hospitals
full of children maimed by mines may stoke hatred for the Khmer
Rouge and its allies but it also creates bitterness against the
Phnom Penh side.
