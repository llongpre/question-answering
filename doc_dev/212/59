<HEAD>Prime Minister Says ``Civil War'' Inevitable in Cambodia</HEAD>

   Prime Minister Hun Sen said today that
civil war in his country is unavoidable because other nations are
funneling arms to guerrillas bent on testing his government on the
battlefield.
   In an interview with the official Cambodian news agency SPK, Hun
Sen downplayed recent victories by a three-party opposition
coalition that includes the Khmer Rouge and two non-Communist groups.
   He accused China, the United States, France, the United Kingdom,
Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand of involvement in the military
activities of the guerrillas.
   Hun Sen said a number of countries had not honored their
commitments to cease military aid to the coalition after Vietnam
said it completed the withdrawal of all its forces in late
September. Rebels say some of the troops remain.
   ``Hence a civil war is inevitable in Cambodia. The Khmer
reactionary forces and their outside supporters are intending to
make a test of forces in the military field within six months before
they engage in a new round of talks,'' Hun Sen said.
   ``We are still advocating the settlement of the conflict through
negotiations,'' he said in the interview that took place in Phnom
Penh, was carried by SPK and monitored in Bangkok.
   He said the first stage of the guerrilla's strategy was to seize
the northwestern provinces of Battambang, Siem Reap and Bantey
Meanchey.
   ``Over the past months, the enemy have made the highest possible
efforts in their military campaigns involving almost all the armed
forces of the three Khmer reactionary factions,'' he said.
   But he said the coalition's ``noisy claims about their so-called
victories are nothing but a ploy of their psychological warfare.''
   Since the Vietnamese troop pullout, the Khmer Rouge have seized
the gem-mining town of Pailin and moved towards Cambodia's
second-largest city, Battambang. The Khmer People's National
Liberation Front and a group loyal to coalition leader Prince
Norodom Sihanok have captured a number of government positions in
the northwest.
   The Cambodian army is supplied by weapons from the Soviet Union
and until last month was backed by a formidable Vietnamese force
which invaded the country in late 1978.
   Hun Sen accused China, the United States, France and Singapore of
shipping military supplies to the guerrillas while Thailand, the
United Kingdom, Malaysia and the United States have trained the two
non-Communist groups. China alone, Hun Sen said, was training the
Khmer Rouge.
   The prime minister said Chinese, American and Thai military
advisors plus some Thai mercenaries had joined the guerrillas during
the recent offensive.
   The United States denies sending lethal aid to the two
non-Communist factions but provides other forms of assistance. China
and Thailand have long been the major backers of the coalition.
