   Moeun Mali massaged the bandaged
stump, all that's left of a leg blown off by a mine while she
walked with friends in the countryside. She awaits an ugly
replacement made of wood, leather and steel.
   She is 19 and frightened. ``I feel lost now,'' she said
softly.``I don't know about the future.''
   ``Someone like her has a bleak future in Cambodia,'' a Western
aid official said later. ``Nobody will marry her and society offers
little. There is still a cultural belief that if you have lost a
limb you are less than whole. You are a second-class citizen.''
   Moeun Mali is one of thousands of Cambodians maimed by
anti-personnel mines, which Cambodian officials and Western aid
workers say Khmer Rouge and other guerrillas are sowing in roads,
ox-cart trails, stream beds and rice fields.
   Although most of the fighting is along the Thai border in the
northeast, they say, the mines are being planted throughout the
country.
   ``In many respects, this is a war being fought with land mines
against civilians, and I don't think anybody is keeping records of
where they are being laid,'' said Brett Ballard of the American
Friends Service Committee.
   Officials of the Vietnam-sponsored government in Phnom Penh say
most of the mines are planted by the Khmer Rouge, whose government
was ousted by the Vietnamese invasion of December 1978.
   The Khmer Rouge and two less powerful guerrilla groups, which
officials say are planting a smaller number of mines, are loosely
allied against the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   Aid workers said half a dozen types of mines are used.
   One made by China, the guerrillas' main arms supplier, is a blue
plastic device that floats just beneath the water's surface and is
easily detonated.
   The mines are light, making them ideal for transport from
guerrilla sanctuaries on the fromtier with Thailand, and often are
planted in flooded rice paddies. The plastic shards are difficult
to detect by X-ray when embedded in a human body.
   ``It's a classic Khmer Rouge terror tactic,'' said Ballard, who
runs his organization's aid program in Cambodia. ``They don't have
the people's hearts and minds, so they use the barrel of the gun.''
   According to Cambodian officials, the guerrillas' objectives are
to sabotage the economy, disrupt community life and convince the
people the government cannot protect them. The guerrillas also
appear to use mines to ring hideouts and arms caches.
   Both sides in the civil war sow large numbers of mines in the
northwestern battle zone, and often do not remove the mines when
they change position.
   Refugee camps and hospitals on the Thai side of the border
receive a constant stream of victims. Former soldiers with missing
limbs beg in the streets of Phnom Penh.
   Some say the greatest impact of the mine warfare is
psychological, keeping people on the edge of fear after 20 years of
war and a reign of terror by the Khmer Rouge government.
   ``It also seems to have the effect of reminding people of the
horror experienced under Pol Pot, and in many ways strengthens
resolve against the Khmer Rouge,'' Ballard said in an interview.
``People can see very clearly that the Khmer Rouge have not
changed.''
   At least 1 million people were killed or died of starvation
while Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge government was in power from April 1975
until the Vietnamese invaded.
   Conservative estimates put the number of amputees in Cambodia at
more than 10,000. Many people are killed outright or die on the way
to hospitals, which can be several days' travel from remote
villages.
   Twelve provincial centers and one in Phnom Penh, run by the
government and aided by the American Friends Service Committee
since 1982, try to cope with the mounting toll.
   Other foreign agencies are setting up vocational training for
amputees and otherwise trying to strengthen weak government
services for the handicapped.
   As in Vietnam and Laos, where people still are maimed by mines
left over from a war that ended 15 years ago, aid agencies foresee
death and injury continuing years after the conflict in Cambodia is
over.
   More than 1,800 civilians and soldiers have been fitted with
artificial legs and undergone rehabilitation at the Phnom Penh
center. Artificial arms come from abroad.
   The leg made at the center is ugly, but is relatively easy to
make from local resources and requires little maintenance. It is
sturdy, designed for farmers working in rice paddies.
   One was being made in the workshop for Moeun Mali, who lost her
right leg in December. Her father, a farmer, was killed earlier by
the Khmer Rouge.
   Moeun Mali brought her books to the center. She hopes to finish
high school and become a nurse.
