Only Chance"] 
  [Text] The unclear response of Democratic Kampuchea [DK] to 
the first topic in the agenda of the roundtable commission's 
meeting which required that the conflicting parties give a yes 
or no answer to the proposed cease-fire continues to cloud the 
search for peace in Cambodia. 
  Democratic Kampuchea's representative Mr. Chan Youran told 
the meeting that his party did not want to fight. He demanded 
that a real cease-fire be organized with the proper supervision 
of a committee or technical group set up for that purpose. 
Democratic Kampuchea's current stance as presented by Mr. Chan 
Youran was a little different from what it was before in that 
this time his party did not insist that other countries be 
invited to take part in the cease-fire supervision committee. 
However, it could be seen that the nature of Democratic 
Kampuchea's stance expressed at the Chhanghsu-on royal residence 
on 27-28 May remains virtually the same, as few changes have 
been made to it. 
  Democratic Kampuchea's strategy is to achieve national 
reconciliation and end the war right off, without first going 
through the stage of a cease-fire. Mr. Meas Chey, an important 
official of Democratic Kampuchea at its permanent office in 
Phnom Penh, stated outside the meeting that the main reason 
behind this Democratic Kampuchea stance was that when all 
Cambodians succeed in achieving national reconciliation, there 
would automatically be a cease-fire. He went on to say that 
otherwise a cease-fire would be ineffective, no matter where and 
when it may be, and he cited many specific examples, including 
the 1973 agreement in the U.S.-Vietnam war. For this reason, 
beginning with national reconciliation remains an important 
starting point. Although Mr. Meas Chey did not tell us what 
would be used as a basis for national reconciliation, certain 
political analysts have cautioned that Democratic Kampuchea was 
trying to push its enemies into its "Minimal Policy Program" 
trap. 
  What is Democratic Kampuchea's minimal policy program 
anyway? 
Mr. Meas Chey explained that the program was not aimed at 
dissolving the Royal Government. According to it, the two sides 
should make compromises. They should discuss what the Royal 
Government would get from Democratic Kampuchea, and vice versa. 
Yet most observers believed that Democratic Kampuchea was 
insulting the Royal Government elected by the people. 
  Although the participants expressed some cheerfulness, a 
Royal Government official who also took part in the meeting 
remained quite pessimistic. He affirmed that he still did not 
understand what the minimal policy program really was. 
  Now, through Democratic Kampuchea's "accepting while 
resolutely rejecting the cease-fire" answer, the war in Cambodia 
is still going on because what the Royal Government wants is to 
set a specific schedule for the cease-fire. Samdech Hun Sen was 
very pessimistic when it came to the future of Cambodia all 
because of the failure to declare a cease-fire schedule. 
  Recently, Samdech Hun Sen told the press that he was in 
possession of a document that was written by Pol Pot, which he 
obtained at the end of last March. According to this document, 
the objective of the Khmer Rouge was to increase their forces to 
25,000 men between May 1994 and May 1996 in preparation for an 
offensive. It should be noted that according to neutral military 
analysts, the current Khmer Rouge rebel army is believed to be 
20,000 strong, including their militia. The actual fighting 
force of the Khmer Rouge, however, is assessed to be about 8,000 
men only. 
  If the proposal for a cease-fire with a specific schedule 
fell through and the roundtable commission's meeting collapsed, 
the Khmer Rouge would surely lose more of its support. The 
Royal Government is certainly employing the Khmer Rouge's own 
game to destroy the Khmer Rouge in addition to the military aid 
from foreign countries, especially the United States, France, 
and Australia. It can equally be said that this is also a 
chance for the Khmer Rouge to make up their mind whether they 
want to end the war and launch a political attack instead, 
because to be frank the Khmer Rouge are far from finished on the 
political stage. 
  On the contrary, if this opportunity is allowed to pass by, 
the Khmer Rouge issue will then no longer belong to the 
framework of a settlement for national reconciliation and an end 
to the war. And His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk already 
warned before the roundtable commission's meeting that, should 
this meeting fail, he would not propose any more of them.
