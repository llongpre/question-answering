   The warring factions in Cambodia
agreed today to share power in a transitional ruling council in an
effort to end the long civil war in their country.
   The question of temporary rule has stalled the peace process in
the past.
   A joint statement issued at the end of two days of negotiations
in the Indonesian capital identified six members of Premier Hun
Sen's Cambodian government as members of the 12-seat Supreme
National Council.
   The remaining six seats are to come from the guerrilla
resistance coalition, with each faction allowed two members.
   The parties also agreed that a peace plan recently adopted by
the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council would serve
``in its entirety as the basis for settling the Cambodian
conflict.''
   The warring factions met today to discuss who will rule their
country until elections can be held. A day earlier, Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had said that the four factions had
indicated they could accept the U.N. peace plan as a negotiating
framework.
   The plan was drawn up by the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union, China,
France and Britain. Negotiations are now aimed at forming an
interim administration, Alatas said.
   The talks have been a series of meetings between the factions
and mediators Alatas and Edwige Avice, the French deputy foreign
minister.
   The Vietnam-installed Phnom Penh government was represented by
Premier Hun Sen. For the three rebel factions, Khieu Samphan
represented the Communist Khmer Rouge; former Premier Son Sann the
anti-Communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front; and Prince
Norodom Ranariddh the followers of his father, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk.
   Sihanouk, the head of the guerrilla coalition, said he was ill
and could not travel from Beijing for the meeting.
   In a written statement today from Beijing, Sihanouk, 67, said
his health was forcing him to take a six-month leave from politics
but he supported all decisions being made in Jakarta. The notice
did not explain the nature of Sihanouk's illness.
   Alatas said he was encouraged by the progress of the opening
session, and aksed the Cambodians to set aside their mistrust and
enmity.
   ``Anyone or any party seen to be blocking the path to peace will
have to assume an awesome responsibility before history,'' he said.
   Alatas has mediated a series of meetings since July 1988. Those
talks ended inconclusively when the four factions disagreed on how
to share power in the period before elections.
   Under the U.N. plan, Cambodian sovereignty would rest with an
interim government formed by the warring factions for the
pre-election period. But some vital powers would be held by a U.N.
peacekeeping force, which would ``supervise and control ... if
necessary'' the ministries of defense, foreign affairs, finance,
public security and information.
   The U.N. force also would verify a cease-fire and supervise
disarmament of the four factions. In a complicated disarmament
procedure, armies of the four would be regrouped in camps and
gradually relinquish their weapons to the United Nations.
   The Cambodian factions must decide the makeup of the interim
government and under what circumstances it would cede power to the
United Nations.
   Hun Sen has resisted the idea of his government giving up its
power before elections. Hun Sen conferred during a break in the
talks Sunday with John Monjo, the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia.
   It was believed to be the first high-level meeting between the
United States and Cambodia since Washington withdrew its
recognition from the resistance coalition in July.
   The resistance coalition is battling the government Vietnam
installed in Phnom Penh after it invaded in late 1978 and toppled
the Khmer Rouge.
   The Khmer Rouge had during nearly four years of rule tried to
transform Cambodia into a radical agrarian society, causing the
deaths of nearly 1 million people due mostly to starvation and
executions.
