In a move that could finally end the war with the Contras, Nicaraguan President 
Daniel Ortega decreed an immediate halt to offensive operations by the 
Sandinista army Wednesday, two months before he is to leave office. 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire came hours after Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who upset Ortega 
in Sunday's presidential election, joined the Sandinista government in urging 
the U.S.-backed guerrillas to disarm at once and return to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
"The president has decided to order a unilateral halt to offensive military 
operations with the aim that the counterrevolutionary forces demobilize 
immediately," a message from Ortega's office said. 
</P>
<P>
He urged the United States to cut all aid to the rebels and asked Honduras to 
close rebel camps in its territory. U.S. military aid to the Contras ended two 
years ago, but Congress continued to fund "humanitarian aid" for the rebels. 
That aid ran out Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista troops have waged an offensive against about 3,000 Contras inside 
Nicaragua since Ortega ended a 19-month-old cease-fire last Nov. 1. Because the 
rebels never officially renounced the cease-fire, Ortega's decision restored a 
mutual suspension of hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
The quick succession of events indicated that a final settlement of the war, 
which has claimed about 30,000 lives in eight years, is a priority of both the 
defeated incumbent and the president-elect and could be one of the first fruits 
of Chamorro's stunning electoral victory. 
</P>
<P>
That prospect appeared to gain Wednesday when the Contras expressed a 
willingness to negotiate with Chamorro on their insistence on keeping their 
arms until her government takes effective control of the army and security 
forces from the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
A rebel spokesman in Honduras, Alejandro Acevedo, said the Contras prefer to 
remain intact as a fighting force to ensure that Ortega hands over power as 
scheduled on April 25. "But under the right conditions, we would be willing to 
demobilize sooner," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"All the repressive structures that caused this war have to disappear," he 
said. "Violeta has magnificent intentions, but up against a totalitarian regime 
it takes more than good intentions. It takes deeds and real guarantees. 
Thousands of lives are in play." 
</P>
<P>
Acevedo said that the rebel high command, which met Wednesday in Tegucigalpa, 
the Honduran capital, set up a commission to meet with Chamorro's 14-party 
National Opposition Union (UNO) and press their conditions for disarming. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Cesar, a former Contra leader who became Chamorro's chief campaign 
strategist, confirmed that informal contacts with the rebels are under way. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro broadcast her appeal to the rebels Tuesday night after Ortega, in a 
speech to thousands of Sandinista militants, made the rebels' disarmament a 
prime condition for a "peaceful transfer" of power to her coalition. She said: 
"The causes of this civil war have disappeared. There is no reason for more 
war." 
</P>
<P>
At her first news conference as president-elect on Wednesday, Chamorro called 
the cease-fire "a step forward in the reconstruction of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Acevedo also welcomed Ortega's decision to resume the 
cease-fire but said the rebels will urge international observers to monitor it. 
The day after the election, rebel commanders ordered their forces inside 
Nicaragua to avoid combat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Contra war, which has battered the economy and divided Nicaraguans, began 
three years after the Sandinista guerrillas overthrew the Somoza dictatorship 
in 1979. The Contras have lost strength since Congress cut their military aid, 
but about 10,000 are still in arms, most of them in Honduras, held together in 
part by food and other non-military supplies from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Under a Central American peace accord signed last August in Tela, Honduras, the 
rebels were to turn their arms over to a task force of observers from the 
United Nations and Organization of American States so that Nicaragua's 
elections could proceed peacefully. It also committed both sides to a 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
But after the rebels refused to lay down their arms, Ortega ordered his army 
last Nov. 1 to resume the offensive, ending a cease-fire that had held since 
March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At her news conference, Chamorro said that when Ortega visited her home Monday 
to concede defeat, she chided him over his decision last year to resume the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, Daniel, if you had complied with your commitments at Tela, you would 
have won (the election)," she recalled telling him. "You didn't end the war, so 
now we have to do it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
But Chamorro's aides admit that it will not be easy for her, either. While she 
identified with the Contra cause, and one of her sons served briefly as a 
Contra civilian leader, rebel military leaders view her with suspicion, fearing 
that she might prove too weak and allow the Sandinistas to keep too much power, 
especially in the army. 
</P>
<P>
A final settlement of the Contra war has become entwined with negotiations 
between UNO and the Sandinistas over the army's future. The Sandinistas have 
said they will resist any changes in the army unless the war ends, but the 
Contras want to see changes before they disarm. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar, the UNO strategist, said one solution might be for the Contras in 
Honduras to surrender their arms now to a U.N. peace-keeping force being set up 
there but remain in their border camps until they are satisfied with conditions 
in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas, called Tuesday 
for the Contras to disband and leave his country quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Talks between an UNO transition team and a Sandinista delegation led by Gen. 
Humberto Ortega, the president's brother, are to start this week. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro made it clear Wednesday that she will remove Gen. Ortega as defense 
minister and replace him with a civilian. She has also pledged to abolish 
compulsory military service as one of her first official acts, depoliticize the 
70,000-member army and reduce it "according to the economic capacity and social 
needs of the country." 
</P>
<P>
While the Sandinistas have characterized the transition talks as negotiations, 
Chamorro insisted that those plans are not negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the constitution of the republic, it is I who will rule from now 
on," she declared. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently to avoid conflict with the Sandinistas, however, her advisers have 
decided recently that the army will not be reduced below the levels of other 
Central American armies and that former Contras will not be incorporated unless 
they disarm, accept amnesty and join up like any other volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chamorro has vowed to declare a general amnesty that would make 
Sandinista soldiers and police officers immune from prosecution for any crimes 
committed during the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar said Chamorro's government will control the army through civilian 
management of a reduced military budget. But other opposition goals, such as 
removing Sandinista military instruction and diversifying foreign military aid, 
would have to be negotiated with a Sandinista officer corps that would remain 
mostly intact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all officers above the rank of captain are Sandinistas who fought as 
guerrillas against the Somoza dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s. Sandinista 
nationalist ideology is part of basic training. The army is not only the 
Sandinistas' power base but a testing ground for new militants. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview late last year, Col. Oswaldo Lacayo, a member of Gen. Ortega's 
staff, conceded that while the army is dominated by Sandinistas, it could 
evolve into a truly national army "with the participation of all patriotic 
sectors." But he warned that if the opposition came to power and adopted an 
"anti-popular program," such as reversing the Sandinista land-reform program, 
the army would resist.
