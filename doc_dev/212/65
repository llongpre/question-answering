   A U.S. military team goes to Cambodia
on Tuesday to examine what may be the remains of Americans missing
from the war in Indochina, a spokesman said.
   It will be the first such mission since the 1975 communist
takeover in Cambodia.
   The United States does not recognize the Vietnamese-installed
Phnom Penh government and has supported guerrillas fighting for its
overthrow.
   But Wednesday, the United States announced it was withdrawing
recognition of the guerrilla coalition and would open talks with
Vietnam on ending the Cambodian war.
   The six-man team leaves from Bangkok aboard a U.S. Air Force
plane and will stay overnight in Phnom Penh, said team spokesman
Lt. Col. Thomas Boyd.
   He said if the remains are identified as those of Americans, a
17-member team will fly to Cambodia on Thursday to take the remains
to Hawaii.
   Boyd would not say how many sets of remains will be examined. At
least 82 U.S. servicemen are listed as missing in action in
Cambodia, he said.
   U.S. officials have also said there are at least eight civilians
reported missing in Cambodia, including four journalists, two
contractors, a merchant seaman and a missionary.
   Most American servicemen missing in Cambodia are airmen. U.S.
airplanes heavily bombed the country from 1969 until 1973.
   Earlier this month, John Gunther Dean, the last U.S. Ambassador
to Cambodia, made a six-day visit to Phnom Penh _ his first since
carrying out the U.S. flag out in 1975.
   The U.S. severed relations with Cambodia in 1975 after Communist
Khmer Rouge guerrillas seized power. During their four year rule,
the Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people as they
tried to implement radical agrarian reforms.
   Phnom Penh said in 1984 it was willing to cooperate on the issue
of missing Americans and declared in 1988 that it was willing to
hand over remains. But the repatriations have been delayed by the
diplomatic stalemate.
   Cambodia's premier, Hun Sen, was quoted as saying in February
1989 that his government had eight sets of American remains and was
searching for more.
   Last month, the Cambodian government said it had set up a
five-man commission led by a deputy minister to help search for the
remains of U.S. servicemen.
   There are 2,353 Americans missing from the war in Indochina. The
largest number, 1,719, are missing in Vietnam.
