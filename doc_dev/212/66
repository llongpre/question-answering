<DESCRIPT>  CAMBODIA; PEACE; MEETING; END  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Cambodia's warring factions failed today to forge a comprehensive peace
package to end the nation's 12-year-old civil war.;   As four days of talks
came to a close, the opposing sides were still deadlocked on the format for
national elections.  </LEADPARA>

DEADLOCK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     They also appeared to have put aside a dispute over disarming fighting
forces and monitoring a cease-fire to a later date.;   Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the chief mediator, had voiced optimism at the beginning of the
talks that the factions could produce a final peace agreement.;   The interim
Supreme National Council, a reconciliation body headed by Sihanouk, plans to
meet again in this sea resort Oct. 21-23, he told reporters. A session also is
planned for Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, in mid-November.;   Snags in the
negotiations have raised worries the fragile cease-fire that took effect in
June could fall apart. Already, violations have been reported by all parties.;
  The conflict pits the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh against
three guerrilla groups, the Khmer Rouge, Sihanouk's followers and the Khmer
People's National Liberation Front. All sides are represented on the council.;
  A peace plan drawn up by the U.N. Security Council has served as the basis
of the negotiations. The plan calls for a monitored truce, demobilization of
troops and U.N. supervision of the government prior to elections.;   Sihanouk
said the factions were unable to agree on a formula for elections.;   "The
position of each side remains very firm, very uncompromising," he said.;   The
government in Phnom Penh is pushing for an electoral system of separate
legislative districts rather than apportioning seats based on a party's
percentage of the total overall vote.;   The key issue of disarming military
forces also appeared to remain unsolved.;   A seven-point, joint communique at
the end of the talks said the factions agreed each army would reduce its
weapons, ammunition, equipment and personnel by 70 percent, and the remaining
troops would be placed in cantonments under U.N. supervision.;   But Sihanouk
said the Khmer Rouge had "for the time being" agreed not to raise the issue of
how to monitor the implementation of that agreement, implying it had not been
resolved.;   In another area, Sihanouk told reporters the Phnom Penh side
agreed to drop its insistence that references to "genocide" be included in a
human rights statement accompanying the peace document.;   Such a reference
has been strongly opposed by the Khmer Rouge, which slaughtered hundreds of
thousands of people during the mid-1970s. The Khmer Rouge were ousted by a
Vietnamese invasion in late 1978 but kept fighting from strongholds along the
Thai-Cambodian border.;   A senior Khmer Rouge official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said today that Vietnam and China, his group's key backer, had
pressured the factions to compromise.  </TEXT>
