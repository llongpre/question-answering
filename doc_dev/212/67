<LEADPARA>  In what appeared to be a significant step toward ending 12 years of civil war,
Cambodia's warring factions agreed today to reduce their armies by 70 percent
and send the remaining troops to barracks.;   Prince Norodom Sihanouk made the
announcement during a second day of peace talks. But the resistance
leader-turned-mediator warned that other disagreements remained between the
Phnom Penh government and the three guerrilla groups opposing it.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I have good news to inform you. Finally we have unexpectedly achieved a
good solution to the main stumbling block -- the military problem," he told
reporters after emerging from the conference room.;   Sihanouk said the
troops, weapons, ammunition and equipment of each of the four armies would be
reduced 70 percent. The rest of the soldiers would be regrouped and placed in
specifically designated quarters under the supervision of U.N. personnel.;  
Phnom Penh's sizable police force would be kept intact but also placed under
U.N. control, he said.;   Sihanouk, who heads an interim council of guerrilla
and government representatives set up under a U.N. peace plan, noted that
disagreements remain over the extent of the world body's involvement in the
Cambodian peace process.;   The Phnom Penh government seeks a minimal role for
the U.N., while the guerrillas and Sihanouk want a major presence and
authority for international peacekeepers.;   Western and Asian diplomats
observing the meeting, which was to last three days, had said earlier that
they believed the U.N. plan was in danger.;   Diplomats say that if the
Cambodians deviate too far from the plan, the United Nations may back away
from significant involvement in the peace process because it fears putting its
resources and prestige on the line.;   A senior official of the Khmer Rouge
guerrilla faction, noting that Premier Hun Sen had walked out of Monday's
meeting, said discussions on disarmament would be "very tough.";   The U.N.
plan -- the main negotiating document -- provides for a monitored truce,
demobilization of all armies and extensive U.N. supervision of the Phnom Penh
government prior to elections.;   Phnom Penh wants to keep at least part of
its army intact during the transition because it fears the Khmer Rouge may try
to seize power.;   During the mid-1970s, the Khmer Rouge presided over a reign
of terror during which hundreds of thousands of people were killed in the name
of communist agrarian revolution.;   Asked about the Khmer Rouge record, which
included the murder of many of his own children, Sihanouk said, "Let bygones
be bygones.";   The Khmer Rouge was ousted by a Vietnamese invasion in late
1978 but kept fighting from strongholds along the Thai-Cambodian border. Its
fighters were later joined by guerrillas loyal to Sihanouk as well as
irregulars from the Khmer People's National Liberation Front.  </TEXT>
