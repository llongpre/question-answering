   The decade of the 1980s produced a familiar chronicle of wars _
from the savage Iran-Iraq War, which broke out in 1980 and dragged
on for eight years, to the short, bloody fight between Britain and
Argentina over the Falklands Islands, a conflict that blew up like
a South Atlantic storm in 1982.
   Lebanon was ripped apart by civil war and ended the decade as it
started it, in a welter of Moslem and Christian blood. Wars
scourged Africa from the sands of the Sahara rim to the bush of
southern Africa. The dead often went uncounted, and the living
often lived on in the misery of famine and flight.
   Here is a brief look at some major conflicts of the decade:
