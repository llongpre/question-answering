   The Khmer Rouge failed to appear Monday at the
opening of peace talks aimed at ending Cambodia's 11-year-old civil
war, casting a cloud over the first international peace conference
in Japan since World War II.
   Khieu Samphan, nominal head of the Communist Khmer Rouge, later
said he didn't attend the talks ``because there are many problems.''
The Khmer Rouge poses the strongest military challenge to the
Vietnam-backed government of Premier Hun Sen.
   Samphan had appeared Sunday evening at a pre-conference banquet
and posed for a photograph with the leaders of other factions. He
said on arrival in Tokyo that he hoped to be able to sign a
cease-fire accord.
   But Hun Sen's government has refused to give the Khmer Rouge a
voice, blaming it for ``genocidal policies'' of the Khmer Rouge when
it held power from 1975 to 1979.
   Hun Sen said he would negotiate only with Sihanouk. In recent
weeks, fighting in Cambodia has intensified.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on Monday greeted arriving
delegations from the Vietnam-backed Phnom Penh government of Premier
Hun Sen and the three-party guerrilla coalition led by Prince
Norodom Sihanouk at Akasaka Palace, Japan's state guest house.
   The talks started about 10 minutes late at 9:30 a.m. after some
hesitation and confusion over Samphan's absence.
   An official with the Khmer Rouge delegation, contacted at their
hotel, declined to explain what had happened. ``We are busy, and
cannot tell you,'' said the official, who did not give his name.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said the reason was not clear.
   While the talks started without him, Samphan and several aides
met for about 20 minutes with a key Thai mediator, Deputy Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who is here to observe the talks and
was instrumental in drafting the cease-fire pact.
   As the Khmer Rouge leader left the meeting, he told reporters he
hadn't attended the peace talks ``because there are many problems.''
He repeated that he had come to Tokyo to sign the cease-fire.
   ``I am waiting for that,'' he said, refusing to elaborate.
   The truce is expected to be disregarded, but the Tokyo talks are
still regarded as a stepping-stone to the possibility of political
progress to end the war.
   The Phnom Penh government hopes the talks also will cover an end
to arms supplies to the guerrilla factions, formation of a national
council to unite the Phnom Penh authorities and Sihanouk's
coalition, and arrangements for some form of international control
in Cambodia, said Hun Sen's spokesman, Chum Bun Rong.
   ``He hopes that we will succeed in this meeting, at least 99
percent. The one percent would be if the Khmer Rouge sabotages it,''
the spokesman said Sunday.
   The 67-year-old Sihanouk was accompanied to the talks by the
third member in his coalition, conservative former Premier Son Sann,
and Prince Ranariddh, Sihanouk's son.
   Talks aimed at settling the Cambodian conflict have had a bumpy
course since 1987 when Sihanouk and Hun Sen met in Paris. Sessions
have been held sporadically in Indonesia and Paris, pointing up how
difficult it is to bring the contenders together, much less get them
to agree.
   The next scheduled Cambodia peace talks are to be held in Paris
in July with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
   Sihanouk's government was ousted in 1970 in a military coup. The
prince allied himself with the Khmer Rouge, which took Phnom Penh in
1975 but then held him in house arrest while killing hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians.
   Vietnam invaded in late 1978, sending the Khmer Rouge back into
the jungles, and the country has been in a state of civil war since.
Hanoi claims that it took all its forces out of the country in
September, though there are charges that Vietnamese troops are still
supporting the Hun Sen government.
