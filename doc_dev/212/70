<LEADPARA>  The United States today stationed its first diplomat in Cambodia in 16 years
to help the war-shocked nation arrange democratic elections.;   "We're about
to embark upon the implementation of a plan that will lead to a new era in
Cambodian history," Charles Twining, an Indochina expert, told reporters after
arriving to set up a U.S. diplomatic mission.  </LEADPARA>

DIPLOMAT SETS UP STATION IN CAMBODIA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Twining will work with the United Nations and Cambodia's Supreme National
Council, a reconciliation body of government and guerrilla leaders, to guide
the nation to U.N.-organized elections by 1993.;   The Vietnamese-installed,
Soviet-backed communist government and three rebel groups that fought it --
two of them U.S.-supported -- signed a peace treaty in Paris on Oct. 23.;  
The agreement was another product of improving relations between the
superpowers since the end of the Cold War. The United States and the Soviet
Union have helped settle other proxy wars in Africa and Latin America,
agreeing to cut military aid to factions in each conflict.;   Embassy closed
in 1975;   The United States had hurriedly shut its old embassy in Phnom Penh
in April 1975, as the Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge closed in on the capital
to defeat the American-backed Lon Nol government.;   One of the most enduring
images of America's defeated intervention in Indochina was a news photo of
American ambassador John Gunther Dean, the U.S. flag tucked under his arm,
walking to an evacuation helicopter.;   The Khmer Rouge government of Pol Pot
was ousted by Vietnamese-backed communists in 1978 after a three-year reign of
terror. Pursuing radical social revolution, the Khmer Rouge had killed
hundreds of thousands of people in purges, slave labor camps and execution
chambers.;   Like Japan and Britain, which also sent envoys to Phnom Penh over
the past two days, the United States will recognize the Supreme National
Council as Cambodia's authority -- not the Vietnamese-installed
administration.;   Ex-head of state returns;   Thursday, former Cambodian head
of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk is to return to Phnom Penh from more than a
decade of exile to lead the council. Premier Hun Sen left for Beijing today to
escort him.;   Twining said that the Paris peace agreement, which gives the
United Nations extensive military and administrative involvement in Cambodian
affairs, "offers the most realistic way to bring peace to Cambodia.";   The
accord would "give the Cambodian people the chance to choose their own
government and build safeguards against the return to the violence of the
past," he said, referring to the totalitarian horror under the Khmer Rouge.;  
The Khmer Rouge is the most potent of three guerrilla groups that have fought
the Phnom Penh government since Vietnam invaded the country in late 1978.  </TEXT>
