   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council met today to discuss what many see as the best chance in
years to end the Cambodian civil war.
   The closed-door meeting followed reports that Khmer Rouge
guerrillas had taken territory from Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed
government and attacked the country's two largest cities.
   The Khmer Rouge radio reported today that thousands of people
fled the western city of Battambang following a guerrilla attack
Jan. 5. The report could not be confirmed.
   Representatives from Britain, China, France, the United States
and the Soviet Union began talks this morning. Diplomatic sources
said it was unlikely a statement on the progress of the talks would
be issued before the meeting ends Tuesday.
   The Foreign Ministry issued a statement as the talks began
urging the diplomats to find ``a solution to allow an end to the
murderous conflict tearing apart Cambodia that prevents a return to
power by the Khmer Rouge.''
   About a dozen supporters of the non-Communist resistance in
Cambodia gathered outside the International Conference Center to
protest the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese-installed government in
Phnom Penh.
   ``The people of Cambodia cannot and the free world should not
resign themselves to an alternative between two despotisms,'' said
a statement signed by 41 French parliamentarians supporting the
protesters.
   Hundreds of thousands of people died during the Communist Khmer
Rouge's 3{-year grip on power, which ended when Vietnam invaded
Cambodia in late 1978. Since September, when Vietnam said it
withdrew the last of its troops from Cambodia, concern has risen
that the Khmer Rouge would again seize power.
   The Security Council delegates likely will focus on an
Australian proposal for an interim U.N. administration to run
Cambodia until free elections can be held.
   Cambodia's disputed seat in the United Nations, held by the
three-party guerrilla alliance since 1982, would be left vacant
until a new government is elected.
   The plan received a boost Friday after a Soviet deputy foreign
minister, Igor Rogachev, announced the Soviet Union and China have
agreed the United Nations should play ``a very major role'' in a
settlement.
   The announcement holds promise for the talks since the Soviets
arm the Communist government of Prime Minister Hun Sen and China
arms the Khmer Rouge, the strongest rebel group.
   France, Britain, and the United States have reacted favorably to
the Australian plan. Vietnam and Phnom Penh have lent conditional
support. So has Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of the alliance,
and former Prime Minister Son Sann, head of its smallest faction.
