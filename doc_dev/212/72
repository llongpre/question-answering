   Senior Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap
today embraced the leaders of military units returning from
Cambodia, where the pro-Hanoi government was said to be losing
territory to guerrillas.
   Before the outdoor ceremony to welcome back thousands of troops,
Vietnamese generals said that their last units had left Cambodia
Tuesday, ending a nearly 11-year struggle against resistance forces
in the neighboring country.
   Vietnam says it has now withdrawn the last 26,000 of its troops
from Cambodia. But the Cambodian guerrilla resistance claims
thousands of Vietnamese soldiers have stayed, disguising themselves
as Cambodians.
   Rebel radio broadcasts monitored in Bangkok, Thailand, on
Wednesday said 3,000 Vietnamese troops were defending the gem-rich
Cambodian town of Pailin near the Thai border from a three-pronged
attack by Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
   Gen. Nguyen Van Thai, chief spokesman for the Ministry of
Defense, denied the claim but said guerrilla forces had taken some
territory.
   The announced Vietnamese withdrawal has raised fears that
Cambodia will slide into a protracted civil war.
   Wars and bloody revolution have kept Cambodia torn by conflict
for the last 20 years. The Khmer Rouge, the strongest of three
resistance groups, sent hundreds of thousands of Cambodians to
their deaths in trying to turn the country into an agrarian commune
from a nearly four-year rule that ended with Vietnam's 1978
invasion.
   Giap, 78, told reporters after the welcoming ceremony that peace
can be achieved in Cambodia if countries supporting the resistance
respond to Vietnam's pullout by ending their aid.
   ``Now that Vietnamese troops have been withdrawn, the ball is on
the other side,'' he said. ``If they don't respond, the Cambodian
people must continue their fighting.''
   Giap a key strategist during Vietnam's war with the United
States,currently is vice chairman of the Vietnamese Military
Council.
   He said Vietnam would ``patiently try to achieve a political
solution'' to the guerrilla war in Cambodia.
   ``We have created a favorable condition for a political
settlement by withdrawing from Cambodia. Now other countries must
stop their military support'' for the guerrillas.''
   China supplies arms to the insurgents, while Thailand has
allowed them to set up bases on its territory.
   In the back of the troop formations during the outdoor welcoming
ceremony, soldiers chatted with giggling girls from Le Qui Don, an
elite girls' school.
   ``It's nice to talk to Vietnamese girls again,'' said a
22-year-old soldier grasping a bouquet of flowers given by the high
school girls.
   Few other residents of Ho Chi Minh City took part in the
ceremony in front of the city hall, formerly South Vietnam's
presidential palace.
   ``I'm happy the soldiers have come back, so mothers and fathers
won't have to worry any more and families will stop losing their
sons,'' a shopkeeper said.
   Asked if Vietnamese troops might return to Cambodia, Giap said
it now is the ``duty of the international community'' to prevent a
return of the Khmer Rouge to power.
   Nguyen Vinh Nghiep, chairman of the People's Committee of Ho Chi
Minh City, called the withdrawal of troops from Cambodia a big
event for Vietnam, and said ``people all around the world are
paying attention.''
   Behind him, a large banner read, ``Solidarity forever between
the peoples of Vietnam and Cambodia.''
   Many Western countries have withheld diplomatic recognition of
Vietnam and the Phnom Penh government because of Vietnam's invasion
and continued military presence.
   Officials from both countries say they hope the withdrawal will
encourage the establishment of political and business ties with
other nations.
   Asked if Vietnamese troops should have withdrawn earlier from
the stalemated guerrilla war, Giap said he disagreed:
   ``American troops, after eliminating Japanese fascism, remained
in Japan, and in Germany and in South Korea. Have they been there
too long?''
   Giap said he believed the troop withdrawal would lead to peace
in Cambodia.
   ``I'm optimistic. I think the international community loves
peace and justice, and in the end we will find a peaceful
solution.''
