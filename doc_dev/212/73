   The Cambodian resistance says next
week's peace negotiations may fail because Vietnam refuses to
resolve key issues and looks upon talks ``as part of the war and not
part of the search for peace.''
   Hopes for a settlement are the brightest yet because the warring
factions have agreed to meet in Paris on July 24-25 and join an
international conference with the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council five days later.
   A guerrilla radio broadcast Monday, however, said success hinged
on Vietnam's sincerity and mentioned ``recent historical lessons.''
   A text, seen Tuesday, said Vietnam's wars with France and the
United States showed that it ``always considered the negotiating
stage as part of the war, and not part of the search for peace as
expected by the rest of the world.
   ``One thing is indisputable: Not even once has Vietnam respected
any negotiated agreements,'' the broadcast said.
   The Vietnamese refuse to work out a comprehensive settlement on
the futures of the Vietnamese-sponsored government in Cambodia and
the Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla group, and oppose deployment
of a peacekeeping force, the broadcast said.
   ``Vietnam loudly states that it wants peace more than anything
else, but Vietnam blocks every key leading to this peace,'' the
radio said. ``Vietnam's odious goal would always be to use the
negotiating stage ... as a forum to gain some reprieve at a time
when its economy is moribound. In this case, we of the Cambodian
resistance will ... fight on.''
   Three guerrilla groups oppose Vietnam's decade-old occupation of
Cambodia _ the Khmer Rouge, Khmer People's National Liberation Front
and the forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, former ruler of Cambodia.
   Vietnam invaded in December 1978, ousting the brutal Khmer Rouge
regime led by Pol Pot, and the civil war began after the Vietnamese
installed a new government in Phnom Penh the next month. Hanoi has
pledged to have all its military forces out of the country by the
end of September.
   A central issue for negotiators in Paris is the future role of
the Khmer Rouge, who killed hundreds of thousands of people when
they ruled Cambodia from the end of the Indochina war in April 1975
until the Vietnamese invasion.
   Premier Hun Sen's government has rejected resistance demands that
the Khmer Rouge be included in a provisional coalition government.
   Cambodia's official news agency SPK said five-day international
conference on ``The Phenomenon of Genocide and the Prevention of the
Genocidal Pol Potists' Return to Power in Cambodia'' would begin
Wednesday in Phnom Penh.
   It said those expected to attend included Cambodians living
abroad and about 100 foreigners, including lawyers and academics.
