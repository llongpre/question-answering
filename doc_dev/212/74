<LEADPARA>  MANY years ago, before war and the vicious Khmer Rouge engulfed Cambodia in
darkness, Am Thiey could often be found at the Royal Palace dancing for her
beloved sovereign, Prince Norodom Sihanouk.;   This week, Am Thiey will once
again dance for the prince, who is to return to Phnom Penh on Thursday after
13 years of exile for what Cambodians hope will be the start of a new era of
peace.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Now a wizened master of 61 years, Am Thiey is tirelessly leading the
national dance troupe in rehearsals of the sweet songs and deliberate,
graceful, traditional dances to be performed in front of the palace Friday.;  
"I'm very happy inside," she said, smiling and clasping her hands in joy above
her heart.;   Preparations for Sihanouk's long-awaited arrival are nearly
complete, mainly in and around the Royal Palace where he will again take up
residence.;   The outer wall of the expansive palace got a final coat of ocher
paint this past week. Inside, almost 200 workers are laboring around the clock
to refurbish the Khem Rim -- the main living quarters -- and other royal
buildings.;   Nearly $100,000 is being spent to repair the Khem Rim and supply
it with new furniture, carpets and curtains brought in from Singapore and
Thailand. France is paying for most of the renovation.;   Just down the road
at Wat Phnom park, artisans have been painting 15-foot portraits of the prince
that will adorn the city, depicting him as a youthful man about half his 69
years.;   Starting in 1941, Sihanouk ruled a Cambodia at peace. He deftly kept
his nation out of the bloody conflict in neighboring Vietnam but was
overthrown in a coup by pro-U.S. military officers in 1970. Cambodia was
engulfed in civil war until 1975, when the Khmer Rouge won.;   Sihanouk
returned in 1975 to live in isolation at the palace, first as the figurehead
leader of the Khmer Rouge regime and then under house arrest.;   OUTSIDE, the
communist Khmer Rouge embarked on one of history's most murderous revolutions,
killing hundreds of thousands of people in purges, slave labor camps and
execution chambers in an attempt to make a radical agrarian commune of
Cambodia.;   The Khmer Rouge allowed Sihanouk to leave for China in 1978
before Phnom Penh fell to invading Vietnamese troops, who installed a
pro-Hanoi government.;   Sihanouk is returning from Beijing as head of
Cambodia's Supreme National Council, a reconciliation body comprising leaders
of the Vietnamese-installed government, the Khmer Rouge and two non-communist
guerrilla groups.;   Also arriving in town this week are diplomats from
Western nations and U.N. peacekeeping forces who will monitor the truce
reached last month in Paris. They will help supervise elections scheduled for
1993, too.;   Almost every Phnom Penh resident interviewed in the past week
expressed pleasure over Sihanouk's return. Large crowds are expected to line
the capital's main roads to greet his motorcade from the airport.;   Although
many Cambodians believe the prince's return will help bring peace and improve
their miserably low standard of living, few know much about him.;   Many
residents were not even born when Sihanouk ruled. Those who were seem to have
only vague memories of the man, although many of the elite in Phnom Penh
recall his autocratic ways and the rampant corruption of his ruling clique
during the 1960s.;   "At the time (Sihanouk ruled), everything was not
perfect, but it wasn't so awful, either," said 50-year-old Von Ngai. "It was
better than the Khmer Rouge regime.";   The most vivid memories are of the 3
1/2 years of rule by Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge and the subsequent civil war.;  
The peace treaty signed in Paris also allows the Khmer Rouge to return to the
capital, and many people are afraid that, despite Sihanouk's presence, the
Khmer Rouge may again plunge the nation into violence.  </TEXT>
