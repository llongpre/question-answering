  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan has 
reaffirmed to France the government's policy that supplying 
weapons to Cambodian government troops is not the solution to 
ending Phnom Penh's conflict with the Khmer Rouge. 
  Surin met French Ambassador Jacques Rummelhardt on Thursday. 
  Three Western countries -- France, the United States and 
Australia -- are considering a Cambodian request to provide 
military aid, including weapons, to help fight the Khmer Rouge. 
  "During the discussion, I inform the French envoy that the 
Thai position towards the request is that the supply of weapons 
will not end the Cambodian conflict and it is not a suitable 
solution," said Surin. 
  Members of the Cambodian government have reiterated calls 
for 
weaponry to attack the guerrillas after roundtable talks in 
North Korea, called by King Norodom Sihanouk, failed to reach a 
settlement. 
  The participants agreed to set up a joint committee which is 
scheduled to meet for the first time on June 15 in Phnom Penh. 
  First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh declared at 
Pochentong airport upon arrival from Pyongyang that war between 
the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge is unavoidable. 
Cambodia's foreign minister, Prince Norodom Sirivut, has toured 
England and France, reportedly to request weapons. 
  Meanwhile, a high-ranking government source yesterday 
confirmed reports that Malaysia has supplied munitions to 
Cambodian troops. 
  "It is widely known in Phnom Penh that Kuala Lumpur has 
supplied munitions to Cambodia in recent months," he said. 
  However, the source said, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamed had told Prime Minister Chuan Likphai recently that 
supplying weapons was not the way to end Cambodia's civil war. 
  The source noted that Western countries which have been 
approached for aid are having second thoughts. 
  "Military aid does not mean only weapons, but also a 
military 
training programme for the ill-disciplined Cambodian troops in 
various fields," he said. 
  The same source said that the West had no assurance that 
weapons they supply would not be sold by the underpaid Cambodian 
troops, even to the Khmer Rouge. Thailand has also expressed 
deep concern that the weapons would be brought across the border 
onto its soil. 
  The United States sent representatives to Phnom Penh last 
month to observe the situation there before making any decision 
on the aid request. The Phnom Penh Post reported the U.S. has, 
however, already decided to send about 90 mine removal experts 
and engineers to Cambodia, and that an advanced team had already 
arrived.
