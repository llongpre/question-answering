   The four warring factions in Cambodia
appear ready to accept a U.N. peace plan to end their 11-year-old
war, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Sunday.
   ``We are encouraged by the fact that the four factions have
indicated they can accept the document as the basis for settling
the Cambodian conflict,'' the foreign minister said after the
opening session of peace talks in the Indonesian capital.
   Alatas said ``the circumstances for achieving a comprehensive
settlement are unlikely ever again to be as favorable as they are
now.''
   The guerrillas and Cambodia's Vietnam-backed government had no
immediate comment.
   The talks, originally scheduled to open Wednesday, were delayed
because key leaders threatened to stay away unless their
counterparts attended.
   The talks were focusing on a plan backed by the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council _ the United States, Soviet
Union, China, Britain and France _ to end Cambodia's civil war.
   The plan envisions the formation of a transitional council on
which each of the four Cambodian factions would be represented.
   The so-called Supreme National Council would cede much of its
authority to the United Nations, whose representatives would
administer the country until free elections could be held. The plan
also calls for disarming and regrouping the four armies.
   Earlier meetings in Indonesia and elsewhere since July 1988
ended inconclusively when the four factions disagreed on how to
share power in the period before elections.
   Premier Hun Sen of the Vietnam-installed government in Phnom
Penh has accepted the U.N. plan ``not only as the agenda of the
meeting, but also as the framework of the solution.''
   The three-party guerrilla resistance coalition also accepts the
U.N. proposal. It was represented Sunday by Khieu Samphan, nominal
leader of the communist Khmer Rouge; former Cambodian Premier Son
Sann, who heads the anti-communist Khmer People's National
Liberation Front; and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who represents the
faction of his father, Prince Norodom Sihanouk. He said he was ill
and could not attend.
   The Indonesian foreign minister and a French Foreign Ministry
official, Edwige Avice, were leading the talks.
   ``The main idea for us, for the permanent five, is an enhanced
intervention of the United Nations in order to create a neutral
political environment allowing the Cambodian people to decide
freely on its future by free and fair elections,'' Ms. Avice said.
   Sihanouk has said the guerrilla coalition would allow the Phnom
Penh government half the seats on the proposed 12-member council,
with the other six seats to be divided equally among the three
guerrilla groups. However, he said the council's decisions should
be made by consensus rather than majority vote.
   He also said the council should be formed before the start of
the U.N. General Assembly session later this month so its
representative could take Cambodia's seat in the world body, which
is now held by the guerrilla coalition. He said China supported his
proposals.
   The guerrilla coalition's non-Communist resistance forces are
backed by Washington. China backs the Khmer Rouge.
   The guerrilla coalition is battling the government Vietnam
installed in Phnom Penh after it invaded in late 1978 and toppled
the Khmer Rouge, who had during their nearly four-year rule tried
to transform Cambodia into a radical agrarian society. Their
program resulted in the deaths of nearly 1 million people.
