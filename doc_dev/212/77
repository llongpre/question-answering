   Cambodia's Vietnam-installed government
and delegates of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas clashed at peace talks
that ended today, and a settlement of the 9-year-old civil war
remained elusive, participants said.
   One participant, Foreign Minister Suppiah Dhanabalan of
Singapore, said the four Cambodian factions remained ``quite far
apart'' after four days of informal talks.
   The talks brought together Vietnam, the nominal coalition of
three guerrilla groups opposing its occupation of Cambodia, the
Phnom Penh government, and Vietnam's close ally, Laos.
   Also attending were representatives of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, which backs the guerrillas: Thailand,
Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
   Working groups of senior officials of all the parties are to be
set up to discuss specific issues. By year's end, the groups are to
make recommendations on holding another round of talks.
   The guerrilla leaders were Khieu Samphan of the communist Khmer
Rouge; Son Sann of the non-communist Khmer People's National
Liberation Front; and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, representing his
father, former Cambodian monarch Prince Nordom Sihanouk.
   Vietnam maintains more than 100,000 troops in Cambodia to fight
the guerrillas, but has pledged a total pullout by early 1990. That
led to the Bogor talks and an anxious search for a political
solution to prevent a bloodier civil war.
   Vietnam's delegate, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, said he
was ``half happy'' with the talks. ``We are determined to have a
political solution before the end of 1990,'' he said.
   A closing statement by the host, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas, said all participants agreed on the urgent need for a
political settlement leading to a neutral and non-aligned Cambodia.
   It said they also agreed on withdrawing Vietnamese forces,
preventing ``the recurrence of genocidal policies and practices''
of the Khmer Rouge regime, and ending foreign arms supplies to the
warring parties.
   The participants also agreed on the need for definite timetables
and an international presence to supervise these processes, the
statement said.
   But Khieu Samphan said in a statement that it was a ``shameless
lie'' to claim the groups agreed on a wide range of issues.
   His statement also appeared to reject any linkage between the
pullout of Vietnamese troops and steps to prevent the Khmer Rouge
from returning to power, although it said the Khmer Rouge agreed
that no single faction should have power. It said Vietnam must
withdraw from Cambodia unconditionally.
   The Khmer Rouge killed at least a million people in its attempt
to impose radical agrarian communism when they ruled Cambodia from
1975 until Vietnam invaded in late 1978 to end bloody Khmer Rouge
attacks on its western border. The group is the strongest of the
three guerrilla groups and reportedly is storing arms for an
offensive in 1990.
   Alatas and Dhanabalan called the talks ``a very important
psychological breakthrough'' _ the first time all the parties
talked face-to-face.
   However, Dhanabalan added: ``The points were made with smiles,
with soft words, and very diplomatically. ... (but) if I look at
the substance, I am less sanguine. I think more effort is needed.''
   He said at least two Cambodian factions ``are still quite far
apart ... They basically reiterated old positions.
   ``Unless there is a genuine attempt on the part of the Cambodian
factions, especially two of the factions, to compromise on the
issues and be ready and willing to share in the power structure of
a future Cambodia, it will be difficult to make progess.''
   Dhanabalan did not name the two parties, but Hun Sen, prime
minister of the Phnom Penh government, told a news conference of
his strong disagreements with the Khmer Rouge.
   ``My party, Son Sann, and Prince Ranariddh have made efforts to
find common ground,'' he said. ``It was a pity that the Khmer Rouge
rejected our proposal.
   ``We proposed a national reconciliation council with Sihanouk in
charge, but the Khmer Rouge rejected it,'' he said. ``We accept
political participation of the Khmer Rouge in any political
solution but not the participation of their army.''
   In a peace plan presented Monday, the first day of talks, Hun
Sen called for ``elimination'' of the Khmer Rouge leadership and
``dissolution'' of its armed forces.
   Hun Sen also announced today he would meet Sihanouk in Paris in
October for a third round of separate talks. No significant
progress was made at their meetings in France last December and
January, and Sihanouk later canceled a third round scheduled for
April in Pyongyang, North Korea.
   Sihanouk, who is considered central in any future Cambodian
government, resigned July 10 and refused to attend the Bogor talks.
But he met Wednesday in Jakarta with his guerrilla partners and Hun
Sen and issued another peace plan, which Hun Sen said he would give
``due consideration.''
