   Peu Dinda, hopping up a hill on one
leg with rusty crutches, says life won't improve for him no matter
who controls Cambodia.
   He is one of the thousands to have lost a part of themselves
during Cambodia's 20-year-old civil war. In this Southeast Asian
country where most people work two or even three jobs to survive,
the former soldier can't find any job at all.
   Without any formal education, he said his only hope is manual
labor. But with only one leg, he fears that's an impossibility.
   ``It's difficult to tell the future,'' said Peu Dinda, who
survives on a meager government war stipend.
   Such feelings of hopelessness grip many Cambodians. Since
gaining independence from the French in 1954, this country has
struggled to survive American bombings, a superpower-sponsored
civil war, a Khmer Rouge genocide and an 11-year Vietnamese
occupation.
   Promises of peace and prosperity with the next government are
greeted with wariness - and weariness.
   World leaders have called a peace settlement by Cambodia's four
warring groups the long sought-after solution to the country's
problems.
   They say a Sept. 10 agreement to share power in a Supreme
National Council - supervised by the United Nations - is what the
country needs.
   Signing the accord is the Vietnam-installed government of Prime
Minister Hun Sen and a coalition that includes the Khmer Rouge,
Khmer People's National Liberation Front and forces of former
Cambodian leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The council is meant to be a symbolic government, with the
United Nations running the country, organizing a cease-fire,
planning elections, ending all foreign military aid and disarming
the four groups fighting for power.
   But the groups have broken peace agreements in the past.
   Meanwhile, the country is stagnating. Boys march into Phnom
Penh's best restaurants to beg food off the plates of foreigners. A
mother washes her month-old baby under water dripping from a fire
hydrant.
   The bulk of Cambodia's property is so run down that it can't be
rented. Electricity and running water are a luxury; some people
carry buckets of water to their homes up flights of stairs daily.
   There are no official records of the country's per capita income
or unemployment rate, according to Cambodia's mission to the United
Nations in New York. Said the mission's First Secretary, P. Cheng:
``All of the social structure is basically destroyed. Statistics
are not possible.''
   The World Almanac Book of Facts in 1990 cites six-year-old
statistics as its most recent, listing $100 as the per capita
income in 1984.
   Some blame Cambodia's troubles on its history as a political
pawn. The country has been at the mercy of outside powers like
China, the Soviet Union and the United States for years.
   ``American policymakers look at Cambodia through an empty
Vietnamese glass. It is not how to help Cambodia but how to punish
Vietnam,'' said Khieu Kanharith, former editor of a weekly
state-owned newspaper.
   Khieu was referring to the U.S. trade restrictions imposed
against Cambodia because of its 11-year occupation by Vietnam.
   ``The international boycott is keeping us from progressing. The
only one way for us to catch up with our neighboring countries is
with international aid,'' Khieu said.
   Further evidence of a country trapped in the past is just inside
the National Pedriatric Hospital, the country's showcase hospital.
   Dr. Chour Ymeng, the hospital's vice director, pointed to the
sick people lining hallway floors. He showed a visitor the red
blotches dotting a baby - caused by malnutrition, which is easily
preventable.
   Chour said he is one of only a handful of doctors who survived
the Khmer Rouge killing fields. If more doctors had lived, perhaps
more children could be saved today, he said.
   Chour isn't the only one who thinks about what could have been.
The brother of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot has spent years picturing
life without the genocidal group.
   Loth Suong lives in a rundown housing project without
electricity to power his refrigerator, a television or even lights.
His brother lives in a Thai beach villa and has yet to be brought
to justice for his genocidal rule.
   ``My brother brought Cambodia down. If the country has no Khmer
Rouge, ordinary people will have a good living standard,'' said
Loth, 79. ``Because I am old, I need only peace. Now I call for you
to give peace to Cambodia.''
   Ros Sopea, a 29-year-old journalism student at Phnom Penh
University, said there aren't enough social services such as
schools or hospitals in Cambodia.
   But she said Cambodia would develop quickly if only the war
would end, freeing the country's estimated 6 million people to
produce enough rice to get ahead.
   Not everyone has Ros' faith.
   Lim Sothy fled Cambodia several months ago. Clutching an English
dictionary, the 18-year-old headed for a refugee camp just inside
Thailand. When last seen, he had about 215 miles, fields of
landmines and border guards to get past.
   But Lim said he had nothing to lose.
