   Influential senators are joining an effort to
persuade President Bush to revamp U.S. policy toward Cambodia,
saying the current one could return the dreaded Khmer Rouge to
power.
   In the draft of a letter to Bush, the group says ``the Khmer
Rouge represents an unacceptable threat to the people of Cambodia,
and that American policy should be based, first and foremost, upon
preventing the return of the Khmer Rouge.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and a
bipartisan group of 10 other senators suggest in the letter that
Bush should open the door to contacts between the United States and
the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh government of Hun Sen.
   They also ask Bush to implement a congressionally authorized aid
program for children who are victims of the country's civil war and
loosen restrictions on U.S. development and humanitarian aid to
Cambodia.
   The letter, circulated for signatures last week, is the latest
sign of growing congressional opposition to a decade-old policy
which sends U.S. aid to a loose political coalition fighting the
Hun Sen government.
   It has become increasingly clear that the Khmer Rouge, whose
regime was responsible for the deaths of more than a million
Cambodians in the 1970s, could be indirectly riding the U.S.
support back into power as the dominant member of the coalition.
   While the Bush administration insists that none of the U.S. aid
is helping the communist rebel group, there is increasing
restiveness on Capitol Hill. Last month the Senate Intelligence
Committee voted to kill a covert aid program for the resistance,
reportedly worth $10 million.
   The United States also has a $7 million program of overt,
non-lethal aid to the resistance coalition.
   Those pressing for the policy change included Intelligence
Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla., vice chairman William
Cohen, R-Maine, and committee member John Danforth, R-Mo.;
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and
senior committee Republican Mark Hatfield of Oregon.
   Also included were Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and committee members Nancy Kassebaum,
R-Kan.; and Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; as well as Sen. Charles Robb,
D-Va., a past strong supporter of administration policy; and Sen.
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
   The administration and its congressional supporters say the aid
is important to keep alive an alternative political force that
could vie for power if negotiations succeeded in bringing about
elections. But the critics are not buying that.
   ``The president's policy in Cambodia is indefensible,'' Mitchell
told reporters last week. ``It doesn't make any sense. How can we,
the United States, which has already enacted into law a prohibition
on aiding the Khmer Rouge, engage in a policy which does precisely
that?''
   He expressed hope that the letter from Capitol Hill would help
strengthen those within the administration who are embarrassed
about the U.S. stance.
   Mitchell and others, including Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., have
suggested that with Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia last year,
the Khmer Rouge now represents a far greater threat.
   They believe U.S. Cambodia policy is a symptom of a larger Bush
blind spot when it comes to China _ the Khmer Rouge's chief
sponsor. ``It all goes back to China, the administration doesn't
want to offend China,'' Mitchell said.
   ``We believe that American policy can and should more clearly
and effectively help prevent future Khmer Rouge domination of
Cambodia,'' stated the letter.
   The group asks that Bush ``clearly state that the United States
will not support a negotiated solution that would give the Khmer
Rouge a role in Cambodia's future or increase the likelihood of a
Khmer Rouge military victory.''
   And noting a promise by Hun Sen to hold U.N.-supervised
elections, it expresses the ``hope that you will see value in
opening up direct contacts with representatives of the regime in
Phnom Penh.''
   It also asks for a more thorough investigation into reports of
military coordination between the non-communist resistance forces,
including the U.S.-backed faction led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
and the Khmer Rouge.
   And it asks for an end to U.S. support for any participation by
the Khmer Rouge in Cambodian representation at the United Nations.
``Better an empty seat than one which bestows international
legitimacy'' upon the forces of the infamous Khmer Rouge leader Pol
Pot, the letter contends.
