   Thousands of Vietnamese soldiers pulled
out of Cambodia today, rumbling across the border in aging trucks
and buses in what Hanoi says is the end of its involvement in the
decade-long war in Cambodia.
   Led by officers riding in a U.S.-made jeep and a string of
Soviet-made armored personnel carriers, the troops passed by
thousands of schoolchildren waving flags along Highway 1.
   The narrow, potholed road was one of the main routes from which
Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and ended nearly
four years of Khmer Rouge terror, installing a pro-Hanoi government.
   There is widespread fear that the Khmer Rouge, which from 1975
to 1978 sent hundreds of thousands of Cambodians to their death as
it tried to turn the country into a primitive agrarian commune,
could fight its way back to power.
   In a radio report received today, Khmer Rouge guerrillas said
they captured two more positions in western Cambodia and killed or
wounded a number of Vietnamese soldiers.
   And in a message to his countrymen, Cambodian President Heng
Samrin today appealed to the army, the Communist Party and the
people to ``unite as a rock-like bloc'' to prevent the re-emergence
of the Khmer Rouge.
   In Ho Chi Minh City today, government officials said Vietnam and
Cambodia would renegotiate a ``peace and friendship'' treaty
imposed on the Cambodian government soon after it was installed.
   The treaty, in essence a mutual defense pact, conflicts with
Cambodia's stated goal of neutrality.
   The officials said Vietnamese arms shipments, military advice
and intelligence, will last as long as nations such as China and
Thailand continue to support the guerrilla resistance front.
   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach today urged a halt
to outside military support for Cambodia's warring factions in
order to avert a civil war.
   Vietnamese schools were closed to mark the troops' return, and
relatives of soldiers ran across the border at Moc Bai.
   ``I am so happy to be leaving Cambodia,'' said a soldier from
Can Tho province as his 3-year-old daughter tugged at his hair.
   ``My wife is more beautiful now than ever,'' said another
soldier as he held hands with his spouse. The young woman, dressed
up in a skirt and blouse, had sprinted the last few yards to
embrace her husband.
   In addition to the 10,000 troops crossing at Moc Bai, Vietnam
soldiers crossed over at port towns on the Mekong River and at
several other locations overland. In all, Vietnam said its last
26,000 troops were coming home today.
   Logistics and artillery divisions, along with wounded soldiers,
crossed the border at Samat, several miles north of Moc Bai. Tanks
and armored personnel carriers arrived at the port town of Rach Gai.
   Outside of Moc Bai, villagers crowded around the trucks to cheer
the soldiers. Many waved Vietnamese flags. Some threw flowers to
the troops.
   ``Welcome home!,'' many people shouted.
   But many soldiers said they were worried about their future.
Vietnam has said it will demobilize many after the withdrawal, and
unemployment is high.
   For the past decade, tens of thousands of Vietnamese troops have
been in Cambodia helping the Phnom Penh government battle a
coalition of guerrilla groups whose strongest faction is the Khmer
Rouge.
   Both the Hanoi and Pnom Penh governments hope the withdrawal
will convince countries to end economic and diplomatic boycotts
imposed after Vietnam's invasion.
   Phnom Penh's Premier Hun Sen says he also hopes the pullout will
persuade China and Thailand to stop aiding the three guerrilla
groups.
   ``After the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops the war will
continue,'' Hun Sen told reporters Sunday. ``As to the scope of the
war, we think it will depend on foreign countries,'' he said.
   The guerrillas have called the troop withdrawal a sham, and say
thousands of Vietnamese troops will remain, disguised as Cambodians.
   At a series of farewell ceremonies over the past six days in key
provincial towns, Cambodians cheered the departing troops and
praised the communist solidarity between the two neighboring
countries.
   Some Cambodians said they welcomed the withdrawal, while others
said they feared the Khmer Rouge, which has been on the offensive
as the Vietnamese withdraw.
   On Monday, in a report received today in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge
radio claimed its forces had captured two more positions in the
west, at Peam Ta and Toek Sok. The guerrillas also claim to have
captured ``a major strategic position'' on the road between the key
towns of Battambang and Pailin in western Cambodia.
   Pailin is the center of a remote ruby mining district near
Thailand, where the guerrilla groups are based.
   Western diplomats do not normally consider Khmer Rouge radio
reports reliable sources of information.
   Phnom Penh's defense minister, Gen. Tea Banh, has acknowledged
the guerrillas have seized teritory near Pailin, but said the area
remained under government control.
   Cambodian officials have repeatedly assured reporters that they
are capable of fighting the guerrillas without Vietnamese military
support, but concede that some Phnom Penh residents have begun
stocking rice and other staples in anticipation of a cut-off of
supplies to the capital.
   In 1975, Khmer Rouge forces encircled the city, forcing the
withdrawal of U.S. Embassy personnel on April 12 and the fall of
the U.S-backed Lon Nol government five days later.
   In the decade since Vietnam's invasion, the number of Khmer
Rouge troops has fallen from 170,000 to 17,000, Vietnamese army
officials say.
