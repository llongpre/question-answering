   Cambodian resistance groups claim
tens of thousands of Vietnamese troops have disguised themselves as
Cambodians and will remain in the country despite Hanoi's claims of
a total troop withdrawal.
   The resistance charge is emerging as its central argument to
justify an escalation of the war in Cambodia, despite the absence
of any hard evidence of a large-scale plan by the Vietnamese army
to remain in Cambodia.
   Vietnam said the last of its forces will be out of Cambodia,
which it invaded in late 1978, by midnight today. But officials of
all three major resistance groups characterize the pullout as an
elaborate hoax.
   ``The Vietnamese will not withdraw from Cambodia,'' said Prince
Norodom Rannaridth in a recent interview. ``We are not fighting a
civil war. It will remain a war to liberate Cambodia from
Vietnamese occupation.''
   The prince leads the army loyal to his father, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, who heads a loose coalition which also includes the Khmer
Rouge and the non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation
Front.
   The Sihanoukists charge that more than 30,000 Vietnamese have
already been disguised as troops or militia of the Phnom Penh
government or as Vietnamese civilians living in the country. Others
are operating in remote areas as regular Vietnamese troops, they
claim.
   Khmer Rouge radio claimed in a recent broadcast that the number
of disguised Vietnamese troops is 110,000.
   While the resistance and defectors fleeing to the Thai-Cambodian
border often cite specific units and figures where the subterfuge
is supposedly occurring, Western analysts following developments in
Cambodia are still uncertain.
   ``I have heard many reports of Vietnamese disguised as Phnom
Penh troops, but we cannot confirm anything,'' one analyst said.
``I am not saying it isn't happening but we have no proof.''
   ``All they (the resistance) need is one piece of hard evidence,
one captured document or officer,'' said another Cambodia watcher.
``But until then nobody will believe them. Nobody except
Cambodians, who are always ready to believe in the worst intentions
of the Vietnamese.''
   Cambodia experts point out that a total Vietnamese pullout would
greatly undermine the resistance battle cry that they are fighting
their historic enemies, the Vietnamese, and preventing them from
``swallowing the country.''
   But should there be truth in the resistance claims, Vietnam
would jeopardize its sorely needed economic assistance from
non-communist nations which have shunned it since the invasion.
   Hanoi hopes the withdrawal will end its isolation.
   The resistance groups say disguised Vietnamese units are used
only to support government troops who are faring poorly in combat
against their fighters.
   ``The Vietnamese are in (Cambodian Prime Minister) Hun Sen
uniforms. I have seen many of them,'' said 25-year-old Mao Souen, a
defector from the Phnom Penh army. ``In my unit there were six
Vietnamese experts. They are in Hun Sen uniforms like me. Before
they were in Vietnamese uniforms, but three months ago they
switched.''
   The chief military analyst of the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front, Dr. Abdul Gaffar, said a number of disguised
Vietnamese were fighting in Pailin. Khmer Rouge and Phnom Penh
troops are reportedly locked in fierce battle for the gem-rich,
Thai-Cambodian border town.
   Gaffar said two regiments of Hanoi's 330th Division had been
integrated into Phnom Penh's 92nd Division while three other
Vietnamese regiments had shed their own uniforms.
   The resistance also points to Vietnamese civilians living in
Cambodia as proof of Hanoi's intention to colonize their country.
It places the number of these settlers at 1.25 million. Vietnamese
officials say there are only 80,000 while some Western diplomats
estimate 200,000.
   Most are shopkeepers, skilled workers and fishermen. Many have
left or are leaving, fearing for their safety after the Vietnamese
military shield is withdrawn.
