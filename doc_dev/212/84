<LEADPARA>  One of modern history's greatest political survivors -- Prince Norodom
Sihanouk -- returns from exile to his war-shattered homeland Thursday faced
with perhaps the most difficult task of his stranger-than-fiction life.;   For
half a century, the prince has captured center stage in Cambodia: as king,
independence hero, head of state, guerrilla chief and international diplomat
par excellence.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Now he returns to the fairy-tale Royal Palace, where as a 19-year-old he
was enthroned by French colonials who thought he would prove a playboy puppet
whose strings they could pull.;   From his regained seat of power, the
69-year-old prince must try to calm fierce hatred among the country's opposing
factions and attract enough international good will and hard cash to rebuild a
land bled dry by two decades of conflict.;   Analysts say Sihanouk's role as
head of an interim Supreme National Council will be pivotal in the next 18
months as U.N. peacekeepers attempt to disarm more than 150,000 soldiers and
the country strives for democratic elections.;   "He is probably the only
Cambodian universally respected, universally recognized as the only Cambodian
who can bring this nation together," Charles H. Twining, the new U.S. envoy in
Phnom Penh, said.;   To Sihanouk's advantage are a charismatic personality,
widespread domestic popularity and finely honed skills that awed even seasoned
diplomats as they watched him cajole, badger and outmaneuver during the
tortuous negotiations of recent years.;   Perhaps his strongest card is solid
backing from the international community, including the United States, China
and Soviet Union. These and other nations brokered the peace accord, signed
last month, that seeks to end Cambodia's 13-year civil war and allowed
Sihanouk's return.;   Preparations for Sihanouk's long-awaited arrival are
nearly complete, mainly in and around the Royal Palace, where he will again
take up residence.;   The outer wall of the expansive palace got a final coat
of ocher paint this past week. Inside, almost 200 workers are laboring around
the clock to refurbish the Khem Rim -- the main living quarters -- and other
royal buildings.;   Nearly $100,000 is being spent to repair the Khem Rim and
supply it with new furniture, carpets and curtains brought in from Singapore
and Thailand. France is paying for most of the renovation.;   Just down the
road at Wat Phnom park, artisans have been painting 15-foot portraits of the
prince that will adorn the city, depicting him as a youthful man about half
his 69 years.;   Sihanouk is returning from Beijing to head a reconciliation
body comprising leaders of the Vietnamese-installed government, the Khmer
Rouge and two non-communist guerrilla groups.;   Also arriving in town this
week are diplomats from Western nations and U.N. peacekeeping forces who will
monitor the truce reached last month in Paris. They will help supervise
elections scheduled for 1993, too.;   Almost every Phnom Penh resident
interviewed in the past week expressed pleasure over Sihanouk's return. Large
crowds are expected to line the capital's main roads to greet his motorcade
from the airport.;   Although many Cambodians believe the prince's return will
help bring peace and improve their miserably low standard of living, few know
much about him.;   Many residents were not even born when Sihanouk ruled.
Those who were seem to have only vague memories of the man, although many of
the elite in Phnom Penh recall his autocratic ways and the rampant corruption
of his ruling clique during the 1960s.;   Over the years, the eccentric prince
-- who brings his fluffy dog Micky to the conference table -- has attracted
admirers. And even his most acerbic critics acknowledge that he is the best
choice among a Cambodian leadership lineup which ranges from ineffectual
has-beens to mass murderers.;   Often in the past, Sihanouk had been counted
down and out only to bounce back.;   To the French, young Sihanouk seemed made
of malleable stuff. But his giddy exuberance, soprano-register voice and
extra-curricular activities (including women, French wine, singing love songs
and making B-grade movies) masked a brilliant, sometimes ruthless political
player.;   He not only wrested independence from the French in 1953 but ran
Cambodia as a private fiefdom, first as king and after 1955 as the political
head of a one-party state.;   He traveled throughout Cambodia, where peasants
regarded him as a cross between an ancient god-king of Angkor and a "papa" who
would hand out gifts and speak their earthy language.;   Indeed, while war
enflamed neighboring Vietnam and Laos, Sihanouk managed to steer Cambodia
along a perilous but peaceful course. He allowed Vietnamese communists to use
Cambodian border areas as sanctuaries and looked the other way when American
planes bombed them.;   "Whether I swing to the right or to the left is my
concern because I work only in the interests of my own country," he said,
explaining before his 1970 overthrow why he sided alternately with the
communists and the West.;   Internally, he tried to root out opponents,
including communists who would later be known as the Khmer Rouge. He also drew
bitter criticism from the educated urban class, fed up with his one-man show
and the rampant corruption of his wife, Princess Monique, and others of the
inner circle.;   This anti-Sihanouk sentiment, too, remains. Internal Khmer
Rouge documents have described Sihanouk as "90 percent rancid, debauched"
while non-communists in Phnom Penh today fear the old corruption will return
on the prince's coattails.;   His opponents, encouraged by the United States,
staged a coup in 1970, sparking a brutal, five-year war between communist-led
rebels and the U.S.-backed government of Gen. Lon Nol.;   From his exile in
Beijing, Sihanouk served as the nominal head of a resistance front dominated
by the Khmer Rouge. Many in Cambodia sided with the Khmer Rouge because of
their loyalty to Sihanouk, who in the eyes of some historians thus shares
responsibility for the destruction of his country.;   "The Khmer Rouge do not
like me at all, and I know that. Ooh, la, la. . . . It is clear to me. When
they no longer need me, they will spit me out like a cherry pit," he said in a
1973 interview.;   His predictions proved true. Returning to Phnom Penh after
the 1975 Khmer Rouge victory, Sihanouk was kept prisoner in his deserted
palace and only saved from execution by intervention of former Chinese leader
Chou En-lai.;   Around him, Khmer Rouge rebels were trying to reshape society
by first destroying it. Their victims -- hundreds of thousands of them -- lie
scattered as bones throughout Cambodia and include more than a dozen of
Sihanouk's own children and grandchildren.;   The Vietnamese probably also
saved him. With Hanoi's forces driving toward Phnom Penh to oust the Khmer
Rouge, Sihanouk was sent as an emissary to Beijing in a desperate, last-minute
ploy by Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot.;   Embarking on his second exile, he
denounced both his captors and the invaders. He began to crystallize a
guerrilla resistance that would fight the Vietnam-installed government in
Phnom Penh for the next 13 years.; The factions; Here are the main political
groups in Cambodia:; (box)Khmer Rouge -- The strongest guerrilla group, their
regime (1975 to 1978) held responsible for 1 million deaths. Ousted by
Soviet-backed Vietnamese forces. Estimated strength: 30,000 troops. Led
publicly by Khieu Samphan and Son Sen, but behind scenes is former dictator
Pol Pot.; (box)Sihanouk's group -- Ousted in 1970 after 29 years, Prince
Sihanouk from exile directed non-communist guerrilla forces estimated at
20,000. He led rebel coalition in peace talks.; (box)Khmer People's National
Liberation Front -- Led by former Cambodian Prime Minister Son Sann, it is
other major non-communist guerrilla force.; Source: Associated Press  </TEXT>
