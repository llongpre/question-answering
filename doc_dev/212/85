   In the first incident of its
kind in the 11-year-old civil war, the government says leftist
rebels shot down one of its war jets with a missile.
   The downing Friday, which killed the pilot and wounded another
crewman, came three days after the rebels launched an offensive
that has killed nearly 100 people.
   The rebels say their offensive was aimed at forcing the rightist
government of President Alfredo Cristiani back to the bargaining
table after a series of stalemated sessions.
   A government communique on Friday claimed that rebel use of
missiles in several attacks demonstrates that the rebels' past
participation in peace talks ``is purely tactical.''
   The fighter-bomber was shot down in eastern Usulatan province,
the communique said. It said the A-47 Dragonfly was struck by a
Soviet-designed missile at midday near Santa Elena, about 80 miles
east of San Salvador.
   Earlier, the armed forces press office had said the plane
crashed because of mechanical failure.
   It was the first time the government has said one of its
warplanes was downed by a missile in El Salvador's civil war, a
conflict that has cost at least 73,000 mostly civilian lives since
it began in 1979.
   The United Nations is mediating peace talks between the
government and the rebels. Five rounds of talks since May have
produced little progress.
   A bill passed recently by the U.S. Congress cut in half the $85
million in military aid that El Salvador receives annually
beginning in fiscal 1991.
   The legislation is aimed at forcing both sides to reach
agreement on ending the war. It stipulates that the aid could be
restored if the rebels launched an offensive that threatened to
overthrow the government, or be halted altogether if President
Cristiani's government refuses to negotiate.
   The government communique, broadcast Friday night, claimed the
missile was one of several supplied to the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front rebels - also known as FMLN - by the leftist
Sandinista government in neighboring Nicaragua before it
relinquished power April 25.
   Such weapons represent ``extremely dangerous acts that could
affect the political stability of the country,'' the communique
said, adding that the rebels have been employing the missiles ``for
the past 72 hours.''
   Earlier Friday, the government said the rebels agreed to end an
offensive they launched last Tuesday that killed at least 91
people. But a rebel spokesman denied it, and reports of new
fighting surfaced.
   According to government officials, the offensive has killed 39
soldiers, 44 rebels and eight civilians and wounded about 300
people.
   The guerrillas claimed over their radio station that the army
suffered 450 casualties, without saying how many were deaths.
   The foreign ministers of Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, who
were meeting in Mexico City on Friday, appealed for an end to the
fighting and urged the two sides to cooperate with the
U.N.-sponsored peace talks.
