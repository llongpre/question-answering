   Sudanese rebels said today they had
agreed to peace talks with Sudan's new military rulers but that no
date had been set.
   Maj. Deng Alor, a spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation
Army, said only that he hoped the talks he described as preliminary
would begin soon.
   Sudan's leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, said Thursday
that the talks would begin in early August. El-Bashir said the
Sudanese government delegation would include one member of the
15-member junta that ousted an elected civilian government in
Khartoum June 30.
   Deng said the rebel delegation would include a high-ranking
member of the rebel's military command but rebel leader John Garang
would not take part in the preliminary discussions.
   The talks, to be held in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, are
aimed at ending Sudan's 6-year-old civil war, which has killed and
displaced millions of people and created waves of refugees into
countries neighboring Sudan.
   The rebel movement, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa, took
up arms against Khartoum's Moslem-dominated government in 1983,
demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms for the nation's
predominantly Christian and ethnically African south.
   In an interview published July 13, el-Bashir said he would agree
to partition of his country if southern residents decide it would
end the civil war. The United Arab Emirates newspaper Al-Khaleej
quoted him as saying he would also accept forming a federation with
southern Sudan.
   El-Bashir has said one of the reasons he ousted Prime Minister
Sadek el-Mahdi's government was because it failed to end the war.
He ordered a unilateral cease-fire, which rebels appear to have
tacitly accepted.
   U.N. officials said earlier this month that Sudan's new military
rulers and the rebels have pledged to cooperate with U.N. efforts
to save 100,000 Sudanese threatened by famine and disease.
   Food has been used as a weapon in the civil war, and the United
Nations estimates 250,000 Sudanese died last year from starvation
due to flood, drought, and war-induced famine.
