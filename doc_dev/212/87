   Cambodian government officials and
rebel leaders were in Jakarta today for possible meetings on a
U.N.-supported peace plan. The talks, scheduled to begin Thursday,
may bring together representatives of Premier Hun Sen's
Vietnam-backed government and leaders of a three-member guerrilla
coalition.
   But plans for the meetings seemed threatened Tuesday after
disputes over who would represent the various groups.
   Coalition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk said earlier this week
he would be represented by his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Hun
Sen said he would send a subordinate because Sihanouk would not be
in Jakarta. Then the Khmer Rouge said it would boycott the talks
because Hun Sen had withdrawn.
   Son Sann, leader of the third element in the coalition, said he
was ``prepared to hold talks on Cambodia despite the absence of Hun
Sen.''
   ``I hope Hun Sen will be coming soon ... If they are serious,
they will come,'' said Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan said after
arriving in Jakarta.
   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas arranged for no more than
three days of informal talks on a peace plan adopted Aug. 28 by the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
   The plan, approved by the United States, the Soviet Union,
China, Britain and France, calls for a truce and U.N. supervision
before elections. It also proposes a Supreme National Council of
representatives from the four Cambodian factions.
   Khieu Samphan said he hoped his arrival would encourage Hun Sen
to make an appearance.
   All three guerrilla factions welcomed the U.N. plan. Phnom Penh,
however, expressed support for a major U.N. role, but said it
should retain power in the interim period.
   The peace plan, originally proposed by Australia, appears to
offer the best hope to end the decades-old conflict.
   Millions have been killed in Cambodia since 1970, when a coup
ended three decades of rule by Sihanouk. The Khmer Rouge won a
civil war in 1975 and ruled the nation for three years. It's blamed
for the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people in efforts to
create a new agrarian society.
   The Soviet-backed Vietnamese invaded in December 1978. Guerrilla
combat and near famine in 1979 drove hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians to U.N. refugee camps in Thailand.
   The Hun Sen government comprises largely Khmer Rouge defectors.
   Sihanouk said from Beijing that he was not coming to Jakarta
because Hun Sen should negotiate with Son Sann, who is premier of
the resistance coalition.
   Sihanouk also said he doesn't want bilateral talks with Hun Sen
because a solution must be worked out among all four Cambodian
factions.
   The Khmer Rouge receives weapons and supplies from China. Moscow
backs the Phnom Penh government and the United States supports the
non-communist factions under Sihanouk and Son Sann.
