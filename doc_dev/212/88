  [Text] Phnom Penh, Jan 3 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge guerrillas 
injured five civilians and burnt down about a hundred homes in 
an attack on a former stronghold of the royalist FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] Party in northwest Cambodia, 
government and military officials said Monday. An estimated 
300-strong group of guerrillas attacked Rumchang in the Ampil 
district bordering Thailand early New Year's day, military 
officials said. The Khmer Rouge withdrew after several hours, 
the officials said, adding the government had sent 
reinforcements to the area. 
  The attack took place as government troops were conducting 
an 
offensive on Khmer Rouge positions further west, near the border 
town of Poipet. 
  Fighting had died down in the Poipet area Monday, but the 
situation remained tense after three days of battles between the 
government and the guerrillas, Thai army officials said. 
  Prior to the May U.N.-organised elections which brought 
FUNCINPEC into a coalition government with their former Phnom 
Penh foe, the Cambodian People's Party, Rumchang served as a 
base for royalist troops and current co-premier Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh maintained a residence in the area. 
  The prince's former residence was not burnt in the attack, a 
government official said. 
  FUNCINPEC was in alliance with the Khmer Rouge throughout 
the 
13- year civil war which was brought to a formal end by the 
signing of the Paris peace agreement in October 1991.
