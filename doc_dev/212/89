   Cambodia's Vietnam-backed government
has welcomed a U.S. offer to meet and discuss ending nearly 20
years of civil war, but it is unlikely to yield easily on
relinquishing power to a U.N. administration.
   In Jakarta, Indonesia, talks scheduled for today involving the
Cambodian government of Premier Hun Sen and representatives of its
guerrilla foes failed to get off the ground as the parties bickered
over who should sit at the table. Secretary of State James Baker
III told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that
U.S.-Cambodian talks would be held in the Laotian capital of
Vientiane.
   He called it ``the next logical step'' in U.S. support for peace
efforts.
   U.S. diplomats in Bangkok say no date has been set for the
meeting.
   A Cambodian official today called it ``another step forward in
the solution of the Cambodian problem.'' Hor Nam Hong, minister
responsible for external affairs on Phnom Penh's council of
ministers, spoke to reporters in Jakarta.
   Washington backs the non-communist resistance forces of Prince
Norodom Sihanouk and of Son Sann, who are allied with the
Chyinese-backed communist Khmer Rouge.
   The three forcea are battling the government Vietnam installed
in Phnom Penh after it invaded in late 1978 and toppled the Khmer
Rouge, which had during a nearly four-year rule tried to transform
Cambodia into a radical agrarian commune, sending nearly 1 million
people to their deaths.
   Plans for the talks in Jakarta were on the verge of total
collapse earlier in the week after key figures threatened not to
come, and the meeting did not begin as scheduled today.
   But Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, today said his
father would come to Jakarta on Sunday. In reponse, Hor Nam Hong
said the premier now plans to arrive Friday.
   The feared Khmer Rouge, the strongest rebel group on the
battlefield, had threatened to boycott the talks if Hun Sen and
Sihanouk did not attend.
   The talks were expected to focus on formation of a transitional
government to govern while elections are organized. Each of the
four Cambodian factions is supposed to be represented on the
council.
   On Aug. 28, the United States and the other permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council _ Britain, China, France and the Soviet
Union _ adopted a Cambodian peace plan under which the world body
would hold interim authority and disarm and regroup the four armies.
   But while Phnom Penh welcomed a major U.N. role, President Heng
Samrin said again last week that his intention was ``to maintain
the status quo _ both politically and militarily.''
   Richard Solomon, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Asian
affairs, expressed disappointment last week when asked if U.S.
officials had succeeded in getting the Vietnamese to persuade Phnom
Penh to back the U.N. plan.
   U.S. and Vietnamese officials met at the United Nations on
Friday in their second round of talks on the Cambodian conflict.
   Solomon said the Vietnamese still want the armies to remain in
place and Phnom Penh to hold interim authority.
