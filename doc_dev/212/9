   Vietnam said Wednesday it will
withdraw from Cambodia by Sept. 30, nearly 11 years after an
invasion that ended the brutal Khmer Rouge regime and started a
civil war.
   Vietnam had said previously it would remove its remaining
soldiers, estimated at up to 70,000, by September only if a
political settlement was reached but would be out by 1990 in any
case.
   Wednesday's announcement, issued as a joint statement in Phnom
Penh, Hanoi and Vientiane, capital of Laos, did not indicate any
conditions were attached.
   Laos, with its pro-Vietnamese government, was included because
the statement was intended to show regional unity and solidarity.
   The statement said an international commission including Canada,
Poland, Indonesia and India was welcome to supervise the
withdrawal, and called for an end to outside military aid.
   ``Vietnam will withdraw from Kampuchea (Cambodia) all of her
forces by the end of September 1989,'' said the statement read to
reporters by Hun Sen, premier of the government Vietnam installed
in Phnom Penh after the invasion.
   Vietnamese withdrawal and the end of outside aid ``will put an
end to the civil war and stimulate the Kampuchean parties to settle
the internal aspects of the Kampuchean question before September
1989 on the basis of national reconciliation,'' said the statement,
also released by Vietnam's official news agency.
   If foreign countries continue aiding resistance groups, the
government in Phnom Penh reserves the right ``to call on other
countries to give assistance to the Kampuchean people to defend
themselves,'' the statement said.
   In the statement, the three Indochinese countries recommended
revival of an ``international controls and supervision commission''
established by the 1954 Geneva Agreement on Cambodia.
   They said the original commission members _ India, Poland and
Canada _ should be joined by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas of
Indonesia, who presided over recent Cambodian talks, and a
representative of the U.N. secretary-general.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
praised the announcement and said that ``if the withdrawal is
carried out it would be a positive development.''
   Ha Huy Thong, a spokesman for Vietnam's permanent mission to the
United Nations, said: ``As the U.S. has repeatedly said that they
will normalize relations with Vietnam after we withdraw all our
forces from Cambodia, we're now waiting to see if they keep their
promise.''
   Hun Sen said in Phnom Penh that he and Prince Norodom Sihanouk
would meet May 2 in Jakarta, Indonesia, on a political settlement,
but rejected Sihanouk's demand that his government be dissolved
before elections.
   Sihanouk once ruled Cambodia and now leads the alliance of three
guerrilla armies, which includes the communist Khmer Rouge.
   In Beijing, Sihanouk said the withdrawal must be supervised by
the United Nations ``and not by the countries chosen unilaterally''
by Vietnam.
   He said China would end its support of the resistance ``only on
the day when the United Nations will have seen the reality of the
withdrawal.''
   A spokeswoman in Paris for the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front, a member of Sihanouk's coalition, called the
Vietnamese announcement ``a farce.''
   Complete withdrawal from Cambodia would remove a major obstacle
to improvement of Vietnam's relations with non-communist nations of
Southeast Asia, with which it hopes to expand trade and political
cooperations.
   The way also would be eased for normalization of Chinese-Soviet
relations. China supports the resistance. The Soviet Union backs
Vietnam.
   Hun Sen dismissed suggestions from reporters that Vietnam was
moving up the withdrawal date because of Soviet pressure before the
visit to Beijing next month by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Vietnam invaded in December 1978 and ousted the Khmer Rouge,
under whose rule an estimated one-fourth of Cambodia's 8 million
people had died from famine and execution since the Indochina war
ended in 1975.
   Fear of a return to power by the Khmer Rouge, the strongest
force in the resistance coalition, has been a major problems in
negotiations.
