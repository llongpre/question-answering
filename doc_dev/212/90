   A gunman from a refugee camp controlled
by Cambodian guerrillas today injured an American working for peace
in Cambodia, a Thai official said.
   Paynai Sirirat, a senior Thai border official, said Peter L. Pond
of Providence, R.I., was shot in the leg by a Cambodian from the
Site 8 camp, located on the Thai-Cambodian frontier. The official
could not confirm whether the guman was a Khmer Rouge soldier.
   Pond was taken to a Bangkok hospital where a nurse said he was in
the emergency room for X-rays. She declined to give more details,
saying the U.S. Embassy had asked the hospital not to talk with
reporters about the case.
   Sirirat said Pond and the gunman quarreled before the shooting.
He said the argument might have been over Pond's work at the camp.
   Pond is a Protestant minister who has worked with Cambodian
refugees and adopted several Cambodian children.
   He helped Cambodian Buddhist monks build a temple at the refugee
camp and planned to set up a Buddhist school.
   Jim Anderson of the International Rescue Committee, which also
works with Cambodian refugees, said he had heard Pond was shot by a
Khmer Rouge soldier in the leg while just south of the camp.
Anderson said his information was sketchy and ``not firsthand.''
   Site 8 is south of the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet and
houses nearly 40,000 refugees. They are followers of the Khmer
Rouge, one of three guerrilla groups fighting the Vietnamese and the
Phnom Penh government in Cambodia.
   Pond has been closely associated with a charismatic Cambodian
Buddhist monk, Maha Ghosananda, who has sought to unite the warring
parties in Cambodia.
   Ghosananda heads The Cambodian Mission for Peace, which Pond
helped found and organize. Both men attended recent peace talks to
end the civil war in Cambodia and urged all factions to reconcile
their differences.
   The ultra-leftist Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia in the 1970s and
killed hundreds of thousands of people in a drive to return to a
primitive agrarian society. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979 and
ousted the Khmer Rouge.
   The guerrillas claim they have renounced their radical ways, but
Western aid organizations, human rights groups and others say their
is mounting proof the Khmer Rouge remains a ruthless force.
