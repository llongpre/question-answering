  [Text] THE Army again warned Cambodian government troops 
fighting the Khmer Rouge near the border yesterday that Thailand 
will respond "in a tough manner" if stray artillery shells 
continue to land on Thai soil. 
  Army spokesman Phalangkun Klahan said the shells could have 
"intentionally'' been aimed against Thai territory. 
  "The artillery shells which have fallen on our soil lately 
are becoming increasingly suspect," the spokesman said. " We 
are analyzing possibilities to determine whether they (Cambodian 
troops) had some motive and intended to fire directly into 
Thailand. 
  "We are preparing to respond in a tough manner" to ensure 
Thailand's sovereignty, said Phalangkun. 
  The warning came amidst heightened tension between Thailand 
and Cambodia over Phnom Penh's allegation that the Thai military 
is still supporting the outlawed Khmer Rouge. Cambodian leaders 
have blamed Thailand for the Khmer Rouge's success in retaking 
the strategic and gem-rich western town of Pailin, an accusation 
Bangkok described as a sore loser's attempt to find a scapegoat. 
  Phnom Penh accused some units of the Thai military of having 
business interests with the Khmer Rouge in Pailin, which were 
seized by the Cambodian army a month before the Khmer Rouge 
recaptured it about a week ago. 
  Supreme Command spokesman Anuson Kritsanaserani last week 
complained about artillery shells fired by Cambodian troops 
landing in Thailand. 
  The military has also pointed out that while Phnom Penh has 
been "smearing" Thailand's image, Thais living along the border 
have had to bear the brunt of the military spillover from the 
Cambodian civil war as well as the burden of never-ending 
refugee problems. 
  "Thai soldiers are taking care of Khmer refugees at the 
border. This shows we are not siding with anybody," Phalangkun 
said. 
  Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon Wongwanit has been at the 
forefront of the diplomatic row between-Thailand and Cambodia. 
He last week threatened to cut humanitarian assistance to the 
war-torn country if it continued its verbal attacks on the 
government here. 
  Wimon yesterday said he wanted to see peace in Cambodia as 
soon as possible and an end to the refugee problem.
