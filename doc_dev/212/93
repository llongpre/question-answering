UNITED NATIONS participation in the Cambodian peace process is expected to
be strongly reaffirmed by the Security Council, despite the refusal of the
Khmer Rouge to co-operate.
A draft Security Council resolution, due to be passed within a week,
underlines the determination of the international community to hold
elections in May 1993 whether or not voting is possible in areas held by
Khmer Rouge guerrilla forces.
The resolution is likely to be acceptable to all the countries which played
a big part in engineering last year's peace agreement which was intended to
end the 13-year civil war.
There are disagreements about the degree of response to failure of the Khmer
Rouge, which was a party to the accord, to abide by it. The Khmer Rouge has
refused to allow the UN access to the areas it controls, has violated the
ceasefire, has fired on UN helicopters and has not disarmed or cantonned its
troops.
The resolution is expected to state that economic penalties would be used
against the Khmer Rouge if it attempted to disrupt the elections or
registration of voters, but to stop short of mandatory sanctions. It will
also leave the way open for the Khmer Rouge to participate in the electoral
process until the last possible moment.
To deter disruption, UNTAC - the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia  -
will maintain its military strength at 16,000 troops until the May elections
instead of cutting it to about half that as planned.
The troops will put less emphasis on cantonment of the military forces of
Cambodia's factions - which has not been a success for most of them and has
been ignored by the Khmer Rouge. Instead, UN troops will be deployed to help
ensure undisturbed registration of voters.
UNTAC is an unusually ex-tensive Dollars 1.6bn operation designed under last
year's peace agreement to steer Cambodia from its civil war to the
establishment of a freely elected government. It plans to keep voter
registration lists open until around the end of January, giving time for
UNTAC to mount a campaign to educate voters about the elections.
A Security Council decision to reinforce UNTAC's mandate reflects a belief
that Khmer Rouge forces are not strong - estimates vary from 5,000 troops to
a maximum of 30,000 - and that elections can be held without serious
disruption.
Khmer Rouge violations of the ceasefire have sometimes been exaggerated by
the Phnom Penh government, western officials say.
It is estimated that areas not held by the Khmer Rouge represent about 85
per cent of Cambodia's territory and around 90 per cent of the populace.
Officials say this would be sufficient for a new government to win
international recognition.
Officials who believe there has been progress in Cambodia point to the
repatriation of 175,000 Cambodians from Thai border camps. They say most
have chosen to return to their villages and that none has been killed
despite the danger from land-mines. The target is to re-settle the remaining
100,000 or so before the elections.
Mandatory sanctions are unlikely to be agreed because of the misgivings of
some governments, including Thailand and France, about the value and
effectiveness of sanctions against the Khmer Rouge.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, has recommended to the
Security Council tighter immigration controls on Cambodia's eastern border
with Vietnam and customs checks on the exportation of lumber and gems on the
Thai border.
In a report, he dismissed Khmer Rouge claims that Vietnamese troops had
infiltrated Cambodia, saying there was no evidence of any formed units of
foreign forces with the possible exception of those zones controlled by the
Khmer Rouge, to which UNTAC had no access.
