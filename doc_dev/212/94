   Troops loyal to slain President Samuel
Doe bombarded rebels from atop the executive mansion Tuesday, and a
West African leader said Doe's death would make it more difficult
to end the war.
   Two days after rebels led by Prince Johnson attacked Doe and his
entourage at the headquarters of the West African task force, the
late president's men used heavy cannons to beat back insurgents.
   Throughout Monrovia, shells exploded and gunfire crackled as
Prince Johnson's fighters scoured the city for Doe loyalists.
   Survivors from Doe's elite presidential guard turned heavy
artillery, placed on the roof of the seaside executive mansion,
onto the rebels and the war-ravaged city. The guns normally face
out toward the Atlantic Ocean.
   Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara said Doe's men had asked the
five-nation West African force to help them evacuate the capital.
Jawara said aid would be offered on humanitarian grounds.
   ``I think it is now urgent to try and do something about
protecting these 230 or so Doe supporters from factional or tribal
revenge,'' said Jawara, chairman of the 16-member Economic
Community of West African States.
   The Community ordered a 3,000-member task force into Liberia
last month to help quell the 8{-month-old civil war, often marked
by tribal fighting. The soldiers are from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea,
Sierra Leone and Gambia.
   Jawara, who was visiting Zimbabwe, said that rather than
speeding the war's end, Doe's death Monday likely would increase
bloodshed.
   Witnesses said Doe's mutilated body was on display at Johnson's
headquarters outside the city. Johnson had said Doe would be
court-martialed, but within a day of his capture Sunday he was
reported dead from gunshot wounds.
   The West African force commander, Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo of
Ghana, said Tuesday that 78 people were killed when Johnson's men
attacked Doe's entourage on Sunday. Among the dead was Defense
Minister Brig. Gen. J. Boima Barclay.
   Quainoo said in a statement Doe told him he had come to express
his surprise that Quainoo had not paid him a courtesy call.
   The statement said: ``General Doe talked at length to the effect
that he was not ready to submit the sovereignty of his country to
any power or indeed regional organization.''
   Quainoo said Doe accused the United States of destroying
Liberia. Doe said he ``feared no one and would fight to the end.''
   The statement said Johnson and about 40 of his men then arrived
and protested Doe's visit. An argument ensued that degenerated into
a shootout.
   Quainoo and other West African officers tried to persuade
Johnson and his men to stop, ``but failed, except that they did not
kill Doe, who was shot in the legs and taken away.''
   Doe's removal from power had been the key demand of Johnson's
rival, Charles Taylor. But Taylor's spokesman, Tom Woewiyu, said
Taylor now was insisting on withdrawal of the West African force
before accepting a truce.
   Plumes of smoke rose Tuesday and sounds of gunfire and shelling
echoed from eastern Sinkor suburb, from where Taylor's fighters
again tried to move into Monrovia.
   It was unclear how strong Taylor's forces are. At one point he
claimed 10,000 fighters. But reporters who visited his camp said
many insurgents have returned to their villages, and those who
remain include many young boys with no training.
   Taylor, a former bureaucrat, overran much of Liberia with little
difficulty after leading a rebel army in an invasion Dec. 24. But
he has been blocked in the eastern suburbs of Monrovia for more
than two months.
   Johnson, a former lieutenant in Doe's army, broke with Taylor
earlier this year and advanced on the capital.
   In Abidjan, capital of Ivory Coast, a group of Johnson
supporters took over the Liberian Embassy. Ambassador Harold Tarr
and his staff abandoned the office Monday after they heard Doe was
dead.
   Liberia has been without effective government for months. Since
mid-July, Monrovia has been torn by fighting involving the two
rebel armies and Doe loyalists. Much of the capital is without food
and water.
   An interim government named at a national unity conference in
Gambia on Aug. 30 _ but rejected by Taylor _ said Tuesday it was
sending a delegation to Monrovia to prepare its installation.
   Sources close to Amos Sawyer, who was named president of the
interim government at the Aug. 30 conference, said he was urged to
send envoys by Johnson and Brig. Gen. David Nimley, whom Doe
loyalists named acting president.
   Doe took power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted elitist
descendants of freed American slaves who had discriminated against
Liberian natives. The rebels accused Doe of misappropriation of
state funds and other corruption.
   But the civil war has been fought largely upon tribal lines. Doe
was from the Krahn people, one of 14 small tribes in Liberia.
Johnson is the son of a Gio, and Taylor is of mixed
Americo-Liberian and native ancestry.
   Americo-Liberians are the descendents of American slaves who
founded Liberia in 1847.
