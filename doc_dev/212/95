   A non-communist Cambodian rebel leader
said Wednesday the men who led the brutal Khmer Rouge government
more than a decade ago should accept exile in China to quiet fears
that they will return to power.
   Son Sann, whose guerrillas are technically allied with the Khmer
Rouge, addressed a news conference on the first day of the annual
General Assembly debate on Cambodia.
   ``I invite Pol Pot and all other Khmer Rouge leaders who
committed great crimes to prepare for their future in a pagoda in
China,'' he said.
   He referred to reports that China, embarrassed by Pol Pot's
record, would offer him and his colleagues refuge, thus eliminating
a major obstacle to a Cambodian settlement.
   ``If you disarm and Khmer Rouge and all parties and let people
vote, they are not going to vote for the Khmer Rouge,'' Son Sann
told the reporters.
   Pol Pot led the Khmer Rouge government that took over Cambodia
in April 1975 and killed or starved hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians before it was ousted by the Vietnamese invasion of
December 1978. The Khmer Rouge now is the strongest fighting force
in the alliance of three guerrilla groups.
   Addressing the General Assembly on behalf of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the former Cambodian ruler who leads the alliance, Son
Sann accused Vietnam of trying to divert attention from what the
rebels claim is its continued presence in Cambodia by focusing on
the Khmer Rouge threat.
   Vietnam says all its soldiers were withdrawn from Cambodia by
the end of September, but the guerrilla alliance claims more than 1
million remain, disguised as Cambodian troops and settlers.
   Son Sann denounced Hanoi for rejecting U.N. supervision and
verification of the withdrawal.
   ``In order to divert the international community from the
subterfuge of `total withdrawal,' Vietnam continues to brandish the
threat of the return of the Khmer Rouge to power,'' he said.
   ``It keeps rejecting all effective and impartial measures to
control its so-called total withdrawal and maintaining at all cost
the regime it has installed in Phnom Penh.''
   He suggested a U.N. presence in Cambodia for five to 10 years to
help safeguard civil rights, verify disarmament of the fighting
groups and make sure the Khmer Rouge did not return to power.
   Vietnamese Ambassador Trinh Xuan Lang said the two major issues
in Cambodia were Vietnamese withdrawal and keeping the Khmer Rouge
out of power.
   All the Vietnamese were gone, he declared, and ``the remaining
key issue is the need to prevent the Pol Pot clique from waging
civil war and re-establishing their genocidal regime in Cambodia.''
   This is the 11th annual General Assembly debate since the
Vietnamese invasion. Members are expected to give overwhelming
approval to a resolution for a comprehensive political settlement
and U.N. validation of the Vietnamese withdrawal.
   The United Nations recognizes the resistance alliance as
Cambodia's legitimate government.
