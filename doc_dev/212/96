  [Text] KONG KREAL, Cambodia , March 6 (AFP) -- Cambodian 
officials said Sunday the Thai military helped Khmer Rouge [KR] 
guerrillas, backed by tribesmen, recapture a major base in 
northern Cambodia which was taken by government forces early 
last month. 
  "Thai military helped fresh Khmer Rouge troops come through 
Thai soil from Pailin," General Khin Yean said referring to the 
Khmer Rouge's main headquarteres in northwest Cambodia. 
  The general said there was no doubt the guerrillas were 
helped by the Thai military in retaking the base at Anlung Veng 
which served as the Khmer Rouge's headquarters for guerrilla 
operations in north and central Cambodia. 
  "I am 100 percent sure, not 99.9 but 100 percent sure," the 
general said, speaking at this rear control base about 50 
kilometres (30 miles) west of Anlung Veng. 
  All around the base troops were carrying out repairs on 
tanks 
and bringing up supplies for what government officers said would 
be an imminent government counter-attack. The general was 
emphatic in saying he did not blame the Thai government for 
Phnom Penh's defeat at Anlung Veng. 
  "But we blame the Thai military and Thai businessmen who 
co-operate together to make money from logs," he said. 
  The fresh Khmer Rouge troops, who numbered up to 500, were 
joined by small groups of guerrillas from surrounding areas and 
by several hundred hill-tribe fighters, the general said. 
Government troops said they were frightened by the 
hill-tribesmen. "We shot at mountain people but they kept on 
coming, it's like they were not afraid to die," said one 
soldier, who retreated through the jungle for two days without 
food and water. 
  "I think the Khmer Rouge gave them some special medicine and 
they get drunk. They came at us like they didn't seem to care, 
like life was not important," private Penn Nouvat said. Some of 
the Montagnards were in Khmer Rouge uniform but others were 
dressed in civilian clothes, government soldiers said. 
  General Khin Yean said the Montagnards were from the Kouy 
tribe who came from Cambodia's remote northern and northeastern 
provinces. Ta Mok, the notorious one-legged Khmer Rouge general 
and commander of Anlung Veng, hired them as mercenaries and was 
paying them handsomely, he said. The Khmer Rouge were not short 
of money, he said, as they sold concessions to log in the rich 
forests surrounding Anlung Veng to Thai business interests, many 
of them controlled by the military. 
  A government official in the provincial town of Siem Reap 
said the Thais were helping the Khmer Rouge as they had a lot of 
money tied up in logs that had been cut but were still lying on 
the ground around Anlung Veng. 
  "There was about 150,000 cubic meters of wood lying there 
when we went in and a cubic meter (35 cubic feet) of top quality 
timber sells for around 80 US dollars," the government official 
said. Government officers confirmed reports that trucks crossed 
over from Thailand to start collecting the wood soon after the 
base was recaptured by the Khmer Rouge on February 24. 
Government officers said the guerrillas were equipped with 
sophisticated anti-tank weaponry, which they believed to be 
German made "Armburst" anti-tank missiles. 
  "I think that Thailand sold this kind of weapon to the Khmer 
Rouge because we have never seen them use it in action before," 
tank commander General Ben Hort said. But a government military 
source in Phnom Penh said the weapons may have been given to the 
royalist FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, 
Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia] forces and the 
non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) 
and then sold to the Khmer Rouge who were their allies in the 
resistance war against the Phnom Penh regime. 
  The war ended with the signing of the 1991 Paris peace 
accords which paved the way for United Nations supervised 
elections and the formation of a coalition government made up of 
the Phnom Penh regime, FUNCINPEC and the political wing of the 
KPNLF.
