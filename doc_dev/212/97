   The physical torture is over for Haing S. Ngor,
former doctor, Cambodian refugee, movie actor and now author and
activist.
   But the nightmares won't stop, and he can't forgive himself for
being the only member of his immediate family to survive four
hellish years under the Khmer Rouge, the Cambodian communists who
seized power in 1975.
   ``Yes, I have survivor's guilt,'' he says, sitting in a luxury
suite at a plush Chicago hotel.
   ``And every night I still have nightmares and I will never be
forgiven by my memory for watching my wife die, watching my parents
tortured by the Khmer Rouge, beaten by the Khmer Rouge, killed by
the Khmer Rouge.''
   Ngor, 40, won an Academy Award in 1985 for his first acting role
when he portrayed Cambodian journalist Dith Pran in ``The Killing
Fields.'' His own tale of survival under the brutal Khmer Rouge
regime is told in ``Haing Ngor: A Cambodian Odyssey'' (MacMillan
Publishing Co., $19.95), which Ngor wrote with journalist Roger
Warner.
   The book is an understated account of life in a country savaged
first by civil war, then by Khmer Rouge occupation. Ngor writes of
scrounging for edible insects to stay alive. He writes of watching
his wife die in childbirth because helping her would reveal he was
a doctor and mean his own certain death. And he writes of torture _
his own and others'.
   No embellishment could add to the horror that comes through in
this straight accounting.
   ``They tied my upper arms to the cross and then my thighs and my
feet,'' Ngor writes about one of the three times he was imprisoned
and tortured. ``Then they threw the rope attached to the top of the
cross over the goalpost and hoisted me up until my feet were above
the pile of wood and rice hulls. I swayed there, back and forth.
   ``After the guards tied all of the prisoners they went around to
each pile of rice hulls and lit it with cigarette lighters.
   ``Rice hulls have a consistency like sawdust. Fires with rice
hulls give off thick, stinging smoke and burn slowly, for days.''
   The war in Vietnam spilled over into Cambodia, but the country's
own civil war racked what had been for centuries a sleepy, agrarian
culture where government corruption was accepted.
   For many Cambodians of mixed ancestry, the native, dark-skinned
Khmers of the countryside seemed to pose no danger. But in 1975,
the Khmer Rouge won control of Cambodia, renaming it Democratic
Kampuchea. Americans were airlifted out of the country and many
well-off Cambodians _ such as Ngor, with his medical degree,
Mercedes-Benz and merchant family background _ left too.
   But he stayed.
   ``I couldn't believe that the Khmer Rouge would do what they
did,'' Ngor said. ``I couldn't believe that the Khmer Rouge would
be so brutal, so cruel. And not only me, the other educated people
thought the same way.''
   As part of their purge, the Khmer Rouge relocated the
population, emptying the cities and forcing residents into the
countryside. There are estimates 2 million to 3 million Cambodians
died under the Khmer Rouge.
   On the day the capital, Phnom Penh, fell to the Khmer Rouge,
Ngor was operating on a wounded government soldier. He left the
patient to die, beginning his own struggle for survival.
   Ngor's four years of hell didn't end until Vietnam invaded
Cambodia and Ngor had made his way to Thailand and then to the
United States and his new home in Los Angeles.
   ``A Cambodian Odyssey'' began taking shape in a Thai refugee
camp, Ngor says. It took two years to write.
   The book is a memorial to ``my wife, my family ... and ... the
people that were killed by the Khmer Rouge,'' Ngor says. But both
the book and the movie were a catharsis as well.
   Ngor says he's seen ``The Killing Fields'' only once. ``I didn't
want to watch, because it seemed like it would bring back all my
memories,'' he says.
   ``Why I decided to do it, because before I crossed the border, I
go to my wife's grave and say, `Sweet, one day I will tell our
story to the world.'
   ``Secondly, I know that film is very touching, but I have to
tell the world and I have not only the movie, but ... I ... write
that book.''
   Ngor still lives in California and he says he's devoting some of
his book and movie earnings to building hospitals for refugees
along the Thailand's border with Cambodia, which remains under
Vietnamese occupation.
   A Buddhist, Ngor filters his experience through his belief in
karma, the cycle of birth, suffering and rebirth.
   ``Maybe in my last life before this one, I did something wrong
to hurt people,'' he says. ``But this life, I paid back ... Please,
next life do not separate my family and my wife.
   ``I want to have my whole family. And, I don't want to see that
kind of torture.''
