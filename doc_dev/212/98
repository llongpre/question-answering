   Fawaz Younis, the Lebanese man convicted here
of hijacking a plane in Beirut in 1985, denounced terrorism in an
interview broadcast today and said the United States was ``showing
off'' by arresting him.
   ``I am sorry to say I have been imprisoned because the United
States government would like to show off,'' Younis, speaking through
an interpreter, said on the CBS ``Nightwatch'' program.
   Repeating his courtroom claim that he had been a member of the
Amal militia carrying out a military orders, Younis said he was not
an international terrorist as portrayed by U.S. authorities.
   ``If my brother would harm civilians, I would be against him,''
he said in the interview, which was taped Wednesday night.
   Younis was found guilty by a U.S. District Court jury of
hijacking a Royal Jordanian airliner from the Beirut airport in 1985
and holding 70 people, two of them Americans, for 30 hours. The jury
acquitted him of charges that he used or threatened violence against
crew members or passengers and that he helped blow up the aircraft.
   The hijacked plane was used to deliver to an Arab League meeting
in Tunisia Amal's demand that armed Palestinians be removed from
Lebanon.
   Younis, 30, was lured to arrest in an elaborate trap the FBI set
on a yacht in the Mediterranean Sea. U.S. officials call his
conviction a successful test of a 1984 statute giving the United
States jurisdiction over the taking of American hostages abroad.
   Younis remains imprisoned under heavy guard and faces a possible
sentence of life in prison. But he said he was tried unfairly for
taking orders as a member of the Amal militia seeking an end to
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   ``The leaders of Amal are not terrorists,'' he said. ``They will
not terrorize anyone, they will not harm innocent people.''
   ``We had an objective. Terrorist acts do not serve ... to end the
war. ... Terrorism harms civilians to serve objectives which have
nothing to do with the war.''
   Younis said he was the wrong target if the U.S. aim was to strike
against anti-American terrorism.
   ``But I would like to leave the judgment on this issue to the
American people,'' he said. ``Had I had any hate or problem with the
American government, I would have harmed those two American
citizens. The testimony proves in court they were well treated. They
were even better treated than the Lebanese citizens who were on
board that flight.''
