   One of the three nations seized by communist
forces in the Indochina War, Cambodia plummeted into even greater
turmoil and death in what was supposed to an era of reconstruction.
An AP correspondent who has kept watch on Cambodia from Thailand in
all those years finds things are beginning to change now for
Cambodians.

   ``No more revolution,'' a communist
government official shouted over the din of live American rock
music. ``And no more curfew. We can dance until morning.''
   Such euphoria is strikingly new in Cambodia, and so is the fact
that anyone would express it so openly to a visiting Western
journalist. Just a few months ago it would have been politically
dangerous to do so, and dancing until dawn would have been
impossible because of a decade-long curfew that had closed down the
Cambodian capital at night.
   But 1989 brought a series of major reforms, along with efforts to
end a civil war with anti-government guerrillas, that have changed
the rules and the mood in Cambodia, which has been under the rule of
various communist factions since the end of the Indochina War in
1975.
   A hunger for consumer goods, a mini construction boom and dancing
fever at Phnom Penh's growing number of nightclubs appear to be
symptoms of hope that Cambodia's long agony is nearly over.
   The freer speech seems to reflect a shift to liberalism among the
motley mix of revolutionaries and technocrats who have run the
country since the Vietnamese invaded 10 years ago and ousted the
Khmer Rouge faction that had turned the country into a killing
ground where perhaps a million people were killed or died of
government-imposed hardship.
   These days Phnom Penh's central market, originally planned for
state ownership, is a haggling, colorful and prospering arena of
free enterprise. Along Ok Nha Sou St., thousands of motorbikes that
failed road inspection tests in Singapore have been shipped in,
repaired and snapped up by customers paying as much as $600 in gold.
   A marked improvement is evident in residential buildings, the
result, said Vice Mayor Roth Sarin, of a recent ordinance allowing
private ownership of property in a city which has grown from a ghost
town at the end of the Khmer Rouge era to 300,000 people in 1981 and
nearly a million today.
   Led by the 38-year-old Prime Minister Hun Sen, the Marxist
government has also given farmers ownership of their land, declared
Buddhism the state religion and abolished the death penalty. It has
promised to allow opposition political parties, something
neighboring Vietnam and most other communist countries still reject.
   ``If we (the Communist Party) lose in general elections we will
be ready to step aside. We are ready to play the democratic game,''
newspaper editor Khieu Khanharith said in an interview. ``How can
one party pretend to represent all strata of society? How can a
Leninist party represent Buddhist monks?''
   Government officials say the impetus for change comes from many
quarters.
   The Phnom Penh government hopes its liberal posture will woo back
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's leader until
he was overthrown by pro-West Cambodians in 1970. The return of
Sihanouk would likely gain Cambodia both international recognition
and badly needed foreign aid and at the same time weaken the Khmer
Rouge, with whom Sihanouk is linked in an anti-government guerrilla
alliance.
   With Vietnam promising to pull all its troops out of Cambodia by
Sept. 30, the Phnom Penh leaders will need determined support from
the population to face the still potent Khmer Rouge and their
leader, Pol Pot, who led the postwar reign of terror.
   Communism, Hun Sen has said, does not go well with most
Cambodians, but liberal reforms do.
   The communist world too, officials point out, is changing, and
war-weary Cambodia needs urgently to end its isolation and poverty
by being flexibile.
   ``If you stand up stubbornly to a strong wind you will be blown
over,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Chum Bun Rong said.
   ``The Cambodian problem is 70 percent solved,'' declared another
Foreign Ministry official, echoing what some Western residents here
believe is over-optimism about the future. Many Cambodians say they
are elated that Sihanouk might return to Phnom Penh and they paint a
rosy picture of economic prosperity just around the corner.
   But the peace process depends on the potentially explosive
chemistry of several parties including the changeable Sihanouk, the
hard-line Khmer Rouge and its Chinese armorers. Regarded as the most
powerful group opposing the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh government,
the Khmer Rouge has been eerily quiet on the battlefields but
Sihanouk recently predicted they would launch a major offensive this
fall.
   ``People are enthusiastic about the changes Hun Sen is bringing
but we're still dead scared of the Khmer Rouge,'' said one
businessman, reflecting the deep scars the Khmer Rouge inflicted
during its 1975-79 rule.
   Economically, too, there are major hurdles ahead.
   Among the world's poorest nations, the ``half war, half peace''
of the past decade has prevented a regeneration of the country's
shattered infrastructure. Hul Lim, a senior official of the Planning
Ministry, projected that it will take Cambodia until the year 2000
to reach the level of per capita output of goods and services it had
attained in 1970.
   In another interview, Uy Sambath of the Commerce Ministry listed
the country's 1988 exports as $30 million, with imports totaling
$125 million. The economy survives, he said, on credits from the
Soviet Union, barter trade and unofficial cross-border trade
exchanges with Thailand.
   But many here are convinced the economy _ some 60 to 70 percent
of it already in private hands _ is slowly improving. A
psychological boost is provided by the growing number of Western aid
agencies setting up offices in Phnom Penh and businessmen from
Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand coming to survey investment
possibilities.
   Anticipating the arrival of foreign companies, and the higher
salaries they will offer, thousands of people are taking English
lessons in private homes in an area now being called ``The English
Quarter.''
   The loosening of restrictions also has led to more ostentatious
displays of wealth. Phnom Penh's moneyed class can now buy American
cosmetics, French champagne, Thai beer and perhaps even a small
Japanese car. Lavish wedding parties, a prime status symbol, average
200,000 riel ($1,300), a sum far out of reach of the average
Cambodian.
   Life affords few luxuries in the countryside, but Chea Kong, a
vice director in the Agriculture Ministry, said the once dangerous
deficits of rice have been brought down to this year's manageable
shortage of 50,000 tons. More construction is also evident in rural
areas where, contrary to guerrilla claims, most Western aid workers
say the government has established considerable authority.
   ``I see lethargy, negligence, lack of initiative, stupid
bureaucracy,'' said one senior international aid official. ``But at
the same time I am amazed at what they have achieved in 10 years,
given their start from zero and their ostracism by the international
community. Nothing works well here, but it works.''
