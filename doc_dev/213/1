The eerie lights go up, the spooky stage smoke clears and what looks like a 
seven-foot-tall ghost of Marley appears wearing stunning fluorescent ghoul 
makeup and cobwebby grave clothes. It's clear that this "Christmas Carol" is 
going to be an exciting blend of spectacle, special effects and surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Local director Tim Glasby has mounted an ambitious version of the Charles 
Dickens classic in the intimate 100-seat Center Stage Theater. The 21-member 
cast, who play 40 characters, is headed by Equity actors John Fink as Marley 
and Richard Stretchberry as Ebenezer Scrooge. 
</P>
<P>
The massive set, based on four rotating wagons, features a curved bridge large 
enough to hold a phalanx of carolers in Victorian dress who sing between 
scenes. We sympathize with the poor Cratchit family, root for Tiny Tim and 
follow the metamorphosis of that archetypal miser Scrooge, who stomps and 
humbugs his way through rapidly shifting scenes -- from Christmas Past, 
Christmas Present and Christmas Future. 
</P>
<P>
The first scenes reveal that Ebenezer was a solitary, neglected child who grew 
up to be a lonely, isolated man, insulated from all human feeling. When 
Christmas Future reveals his unmourned death, Scrooge suffers profound anguish 
over his miserly years and feels a genuine need to make something of what is 
left of his life. 
</P>
<P>
The test of an actor is here. Scrooge must change in one moment from curmudgeon 
to jovial gift-bringer. Stretchberry is up to it. He builds the change slowly 
with superb control. When we finally see him hopping and singing with joy on 
Christmas morning, we can believe this. And we believe that Scrooge is a symbol 
of Everyman and that every man harbors a streak of Scrooge. 
</P>
<P>
This is a good holiday show for the whole family. The children will love the 
special effects. One little girl at the performance I attended turned to her 
friend afterward and said, "It was perfect."
