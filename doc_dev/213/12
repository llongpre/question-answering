<P>
As Ebenezer Scrooge plunges headlong with the rest of us into an apparently 
nasty decade filled with omens of war and hard times, his redemption through 
generosity and kindness would seem to have a special significance. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, Hal Landon Jr. has turned serious as Charles Dickens' 
notorious miser. He brings a far more provocative dimension to his perennial 
starring role in South Coast Repertory's adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" than 
the caricature he gave us last year. 
</P>
<P>
Landon remakes Scrooge into a tragic figure of sorts, who manages to avoid the 
usual fate of tragic figures. He also has eliminated last year's giddy baby 
talk in a climactic second-act scene, which clearly was intended to entertain 
the 6-year-olds in the audience but which trivialized the meaning of the play. 
</P>
<P>
Landon's deepened performance, however, is not matched by the rest of the 
company, which is nowhere near as crisp as it was last year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the casting of a handful of minority actors in major supporting roles 
-- a commendable, politically correct effort -- the production is measurably 
diminished by the loss of such top-notch SCR veterans as Anni Long, Jarion 
Monroe and Don Took as well as Devon Raymond, one of the brightest newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the romantic byplay -- or even a spark of attraction -- between 
young Ebenezer and Belle is totally lost. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, with Dante di Loreto and Raymond in the roles, it made for one of 
the play's more appealing digressions. But Richard Soto gives a wooden and 
uninviting performance as young Ebenezer, no better here than he was this 
summer as Claudio in the Grove Shakespeare Festival's "Much Ado About Nothing." 
Lucy Rodriguez not only lacks delicacy as Belle but manages the seemingly 
impossible feat of swallowing her words while delivering them with a stentorian 
flourish. Their parting scene as would-be lovers has the flavor of community 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Butler, also a newcomer, fares better in the roles of Marley's Ghost and 
the Spirit of Christmas Yet-To-Come, both heavily disguised by makeup and 
costuming. 
</P>
<P>
SCR veteran Richard Doyle, replacing Art Koustik (who is recovering from a 
motorcycle accident), brings the requisite joviality to the role of Mr. 
Fezziwig and gives us a baudier, less feral portrait of the Fagan-like Joe. And 
while Ron Boussom's depiction of the Ghost of Christmas Past is comically 
effete, it pales by comparison with Monroe's precise elegance in last year's 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the party scenes as a whole have lost some of their radiance, 
although director John-David Keller's staging is full of lively details and 
Dwight Richard Odle's costumes are colorful and authentic. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the show's overall technical pizazz is all there, including special 
effects that elicited shrieks from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the supporting cast will improve with more performances. Getting 
accustomed to the chatter from the kids in the seats may help as well. 
</P>
<P>
As a cultural rite of passage, "A Christmas Carol" plays to many kids. The 
veteran actors in this annual holiday show have come to expect interruptions. 
On opening night Wednesday during the second act, however, one young child kept 
up such a long, loud, running conversation with himself, his parents and nobody 
in particular that it would have been hard for Olivier himself to have cast a 
spell. 
</P>
