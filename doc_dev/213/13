Patrick Stewart, and Charles Dickens, plainly have a dedicated following. At
the end of his one-man performance of A Christmas Carol at the Old Vic,
Stewart received an immediate standing ovation. And in the last 20 minutes
of his two-hour show one can see why: as the reformed, beneficent Scrooge,
Stewart is totally in command of his material and his audience.
Not that there were lapses before; the technique is always there. Any
reservations are about how far it is possible to reduce the Dickens novel to
a solo show.
When people were reputed to have known A Christmas Carol by heart, perhaps
they would have picked up every nuance and minor character and gone along
quite happily with the sequence of the ghosts of Christmas. A lot of people
still do. Never having developed a taste for Dickens, I shall defer to them,
save to say that much of it seems maudlin and repetitious and that unless
you know the story by heart, you may find a one-man version confusing and
irritating.
My only other criticism could be a compliment. Stewart's opening Scrooge -
the hard man - does not seem such a bad old stick. When someone wishes him
'Merry Christmas', he replies 'humbug': not an uncommon sentiment. Possibly
this a deliberate interpretation. Underneath the mean old Scrooge, there was
always a generous soul waiting to break out. The simpler explanation,
however, is that Stewart is much better playing Scrooge, good or bad, rather
than all the other characters as well.
The Old Vic is a biggish theatre with a large stage. On the first night it
was packed. Despite the seasonal coughing, Stewart held the audience
throughout. He knew his performance was working because after going through
an hysterical burst of laughter, he suddenly ad-libbed: 'For a man who has
been out of practice so long, that was a brilliant laugh.' Applause all
round.
For the last six years or so Stewart has given his talents to Hollywood and
television. Here is a welcome re-appearance. As an actor he has a lean and
hungry look. One hopes that the Royal Shakespeare Company, of which he is
still an honorary member, can tempt him back to greater parts.
