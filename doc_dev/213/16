Cheers to the San Diego Repertory Theatre for putting the true Christmas spirit 
into its 14th edition of "A Christmas Carol" on the Lyceum Stage. 
</P>
<P>
The theater could have trotted out the same wonderful, heartwarming sure-fire 
success that "A Christmas Carol" has always been for them -- and goodness 
knows, at the end of a tough, controversial season like this past one, they 
could have used something safe. 
</P>
<P>
They could have cut costs by dusting off old sets, freshening up old costumes 
and pulling out old props. Instead, director Walter Schoen looked at an 
oft-overlooked side of Charles Dickens -- his role as a crusader against the 
social injustices of his time -- and decided to address the sadnesses of our 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of focusing on the poor of Victorian England, Schoen set this year's 
"Carol" on a San Diego street where the homeless congregate. The prologue is 
simple and brief: Some of the homeless, to keep warm, are burning books. One of 
the books, pulled from the fire by a little boy who wants to hear a story, is 
"A Christmas Carol." As the boy's mother reads the story, the homeless 
community acts it out, using props from the street: a wastebasket with planks 
of wood for Bob Cratchit's desk, a shopping cart with a coin changer for a 
store. 
</P>
<P>
Once the mother, played with rousing spirit by Sylvia M'Lafi Thompson, begins 
reading the story, the script is the same sturdy, satisfying adaptation by 
Douglas Jacobs that the Rep has always used. 
</P>
<P>
One of the pluses of the contemporary opening is that it gives the show welcome 
room to play with a range of retrospective styles. The dances, smartly 
choreographed by Bruce Nelson, range from old English steps to break dancing by 
the agile Nelson as Mr. Fezziwig. And the music -- beautifully orchestrated by 
Linda Vickerman for one of the Rep's most able singing casts -- moves 
effortlessly from gospel singing to old carols to modern pop. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while the Rep's daring deserves praise, Schoen would have been more 
successful if he had pushed his concept further. 
</P>
<P>
The director seems to be after a "Man of La Mancha" effect, in which Dickens' 
book, like Cervantes' manuscript in "Man of La Mancha," needs to justify its 
existence if it is to survive. But he doesn't put enough force behind the idea. 
</P>
<P>
When the boy saves the book from the fire, the man tending the fire just shrugs 
instead of scolding him. There is an issue here for the man to raise; when 
people are cold, isn't concrete warmth more important than storytelling ? 
</P>
<P>
What needs to be pointed out more forcefully -- obvious as it may be to some -- 
is that this book is needed to warm these people's hearts even more than it is 
needed to warm their hands. 
</P>
<P>
Also, to elicit more sympathy for the homeless who act out the play, one needs 
to establish characters -- even briefly -- who can show themselves to be 
personally affected by the story in the end. 
</P>
<P>
Why not have someone -- perhaps the small boy's mother -- beseech the vagrant 
who is to play Scrooge for an extra piece of bread for her boy who is ailing? 
Why not have her plead for the sake of the Christmas spirit, only to be turned 
down by the fellow who -- in the true spirit of Scrooge -- doesn't see why 
Christmas should be used as an excuse to take away a starving man's last crust? 
</P>
<P>
Why not show the small boy, who does in fact play Tiny Tim, as being sick or 
handicapped in some way? And when the story is over, might the man not help him 
by offering him something to eat and an arm to help him walk? 
</P>
<P>
Still, what does come through overwhelmingly is that this is a story with its 
heart in the right place. The talented cast is a joy, from W. Francis Walters 
as a crusty bourgeois Scrooge to Kory Abosada as both Tiny Tim and the youngest 
Ebeneezer (a clever touch to help Scrooge identify with Tiny Tim), to Richard 
Soto as Scrooge's ebullient nephew, Fred. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson injects a welcome toughness to Mrs. Cratchit as well as to the part of 
first narrator (several people narrate as the book is passed from hand to 
hand), Damon Bryant lends weighty pain to Scrooge's dead partner, Jacob Marley, 
and Maggie Stewart suggests an ethereal, musty air as the gentle Ghost of 
Christmas Past. 
</P>
<P>
The contemporary squalor of the sets by Thomas Buderwitz are clever in a 
bittersweet way -- the vagrants' imagination of a feast is all wrapped up in 
buckets of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Cheez-Its, with empty soda cans 
decorating the holiday wreaths. The costumes by Catherine Meachum find common 
threads, literally, between contemporary layering of faded cloth and Victorian 
layering of the same. 
</P>
<P>
The lighting by John B. Forbes is excellent, and Schoen's direction is inspired 
except for the curious beginning in which it is not clear when the play 
actually starts. 
</P>
<P>
The play's awkward opening is redeemed by an effective ending in which it 
becomes clear that this story about Christmas does not end at the theater 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
As the theater crowds exit through a glittering, bedecked Horton Plaza, with 
the homeless stretched out not far from the pretty and upscale stores, this 
"Christmas Carol" becomes a powerful reminder of how urgently the ordinary 
person, like Mr. Scrooge, needs to learn how to keep Christmas in his heart if 
anything is to change. 
</P>
<P>
Dickens would have liked this show.
