<P>
As Ebenezer Scrooge plunges headlong with the rest of us into an apparently 
nasty decade filled with omens of war and hard times, his redemption through 
generosity and kindness would seem to have a special significance. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, Hal Landon Jr. has turned serious as Charles Dickens' 
notorious miser. 
</P>
<P>
He brings a far more provocative dimension to his perennial starring role in 
South Coast Repertory's adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" than the caricature 
depicted last year. 
</P>
<P>
Landon remakes Scrooge into a tragic figure of sorts, eliminating last year's 
giddy baby talk in a climactic second-act scene that trivialized the meaning of 
the play. But his deepened performance is not matched by the company. 
</P>
<P>
The romantic by-play between young Ebenezer and Belle -- one of last year's 
more appealing digressions -- is totally lost. Richard Soto is wooden as young 
Ebenezer. Lucy Rodriguez not only lacks delicacy as Belle, but manages the 
seemingly impossible feat of swallowing her words while delivering them with 
stentorian flourish. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Doyle brings the requisite joviality to the role of Fezziwig and gives 
us a bawdy, less feral portrait of the Faganesque Joe. 
</P>
<P>
The party scenes have lost some radiance, though John-David Keller's staging is 
lively and Dwight Richard Odle's costumes colorfully authentic. The technical 
pizazz is there, including special effects that elicit audience shrieks.
