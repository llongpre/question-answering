South Coast Repertory has transformed the time-encrusted mythology of "A 
Christmas Carol" into a sprightly, well-turned comedy with an Ebenezer Scrooge 
who doesn't have a mean bone in his body. 
</P>
<P>
Scrooge is a penny-pinching grumbler, of course. And virtually everybody on 
stage either says he's a meanie or treats him like one. But we don't believe it 
for a minute. We're not meant to. Not in this version. For no matter how bony 
Scrooge's face, how chilly his words, how miserly his deeds, Scrooge is a 
comic. This news should come as no surprise to SCR regulars. Hal Landon Jr. has 
played him this way every year since 1980, and John-David Keller has directed 
the show for as many silly laughs as it can get. 
</P>
<P>
The result happens to be highly entertaining, especially for a family audience. 
But it is not Dickens. It misses the pathos of the story and its emotional 
impact. Furthermore, while Jerry Patch's adaptation conveys the basic message 
that kindness and charity are to be valued, the moral of the story is 
dangerously oversimplified. 
</P>
<P>
Every kid in the audience, and probably some parents, may well be persuaded 
that the inverse of the moral is true. By play's end, Scrooge discovers that 
money is the root of all good, as long as he gives it away. Money buys love. 
Money buys happiness. Money, more than generosity, remains his form of 
salvation. 
</P>
<P>
However, there can be no faulting the production for its liveliness, freshness 
and technical polish. It moves swiftly, yet without sacrificing too much 
detail. The acting is crisp and particular. Party scenes are radiant, with 
minor roles filled out beautifully. The music is warm, the costumes authentic. 
And the special effects, while vivid, are not overplayed. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, this "Christmas Carol" has the great virtue of not being boring, 
which cannot be said for many cultural rites of passage. It certainly works as 
a first taste of theater and may whet a child's appetite for the real Dickens.
