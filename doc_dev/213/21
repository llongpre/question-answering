<LEADPARA>  On a cool November night, on a stage in North San Jose, Scrooge, actor Joe
Christensen, wanders through an imaginary graveyard, calling after the phantom
that beckons him. 'Spirit,' he cries, ". . . something has informed me our
parting moment is at hand. I know but I know not how.";   Well, Ebenezer,
that's easy. Your parting moment is coming because, as every man, woman and
child knows, you are about to learn the true meaning of Christmas.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In an age when the spirit of Christmas can get lost in hectic shopping
trips, made-for-television specials and a bombardment of commercials,
Northside Theatre Company director Richard Orlando sees himself as a purist.; 
 This year's production of the classic "A Christmas Carol" aims for the
essence of Dickens. "It's pure," says Orlando. "We treat the play as a
Christmas ghost story.";   One of the main reasons for preserving the original
intent of the play is to educate the public about the world of Dickens.;   In
other words, this is no cheery song-and-dance Christmas pageant. It's the
story of 19th-century London complete with plague and poverty, Orlando said.
And there's enough fog, eerie music, trap door entrances, ghosts and
graveyards to scare the Dickens out of you.;   Dockworkers and common folk on
the waterfront tell the story of the miser who gets a lesson in giving. "It's
never been told that way before from the community," Orlando says. In the
sparse, wood scaffolding of the dock set, barrels become desks, the dock
becomes Scrooge's bedroom.;   The 19-member cast -- through a series of quick
changes -- handles the play's 50 roles. Many cast members are returning from
last year's production.;   This will be the eighth season that the Northside
company has performed "A Christmas Carol." Orlando said the play has survived
because it is as applicable to London of long ago, as it is to 20th- century
San Jose. "We get caught up in the commercial aspects of Christmas, going to
the mall, buying presents. In the play it talks about giving time, listening,"
Orlando says.;   It is also a play about community.;   "Scrooge is alone, he
is isolated from the first," Orlando said. "It is all about being involved in
where you live and being involved in your community.;   "We have so much
diversity in this community but everybody has their own pigeon hole," he said.
"('A Christmas Carol') says get out and do it. Have some fun and be
involved.";   Back at rehearsal, Christensen huddled over a tombstone and
continued with Scrooge's pleas. While specters spring up from behind Scrooge's
grave and haunting music swirls in the background Scrooge cries out: "Oh, tell
me that I may sponge away the writing from this stone.";   Of course, we know
the stone comes clean and Scrooge gets a second chance to keep the spirit of
Christmas alive in his heart all year -- or at least until next Christmas
season.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The play runs Thursdays through Sundays from
Dec. 5 through 29 at the Olinder Theater, 848 E. William St. Tickets can be
ordered by calling (408) 288-7820.  </TEXT>
