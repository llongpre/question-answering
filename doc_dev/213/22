Patrick Stewart cautions his public in the program: Don't expect ornamentation. 
No Christmas fog, no visible ghosts of Christmases Past, Present or Future. 
</P>
<P>
No Tiny Tim, no warm Christmas fires. 
</P>
<P>
This perennial one-man reading of "A Christmas Carol" is furnished strictly by 
the vigor of Charles Dickens' words, the distinctive characterizations 
delivered by Stewart's reading of them -- and by the tricks they play on our 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who is a Royal Shakespeare Company stalwart (now known to larger 
audiences as Captain Jean-Luc Picard on TV's "Star Trek: The Next Generation") 
expertly calibrates his reading. 
</P>
<P>
In black suit and white shirt, he creates a world with a desk and a chair -- 
slicing the air with the pages of his script, grousing as the diffident 
Scrooge, snarling as the furtive one, bursting into wrenching sobs as Bob 
Cratchit, breaking our hearts as Tiny Tim and chuckling with uncontrollable 
glee as the rehabilitated old miser. 
</P>
<P>
It all works. The bleakness of Dickens' rigorous imagery and suspense, in 
collusion with the actor's virtuosity, even in as familiar a story as this, 
keeps us surprisingly close to the edge of our seats.
