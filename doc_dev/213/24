   The film world has long been fascinated with
the yuletide season.
   Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol,'' the time-worn tale of
Scrooge and Tiny Tim, may well be the most recurrent of the
Christmas movies. It appeared in several versions during the silent
era, then MGM made a 1938 ``A Christmas Carol'' with Reginald Owen
as Scrooge. In 1951, the English did their own version with
Alistair Sims as the legendary penny-pincher (the British had done
an undistinguished ``Scrooge'' in 1935).
   Albert Finney was unrecognizable in the title role of the 1970
``Scrooge,'' and a recent version starring George C. Scott has
become a television perennial. A couple of years ago, the Walt
Disney company enlisted all of its cartoon stars for a featurette
``Mickey's Christmas Carol.''
   The song ``White Christmas,'' sung by Bing Crosby in the 1942
film, ``Holiday Inn,'' became Irving Berlin's greatest hit and
resulted in the 1954 movie, ``White Christmas.''
   Frank Capra's unabashed sentiment often resulted in Christmas
scenes, notably in ``Meet John Doe'' and ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
The latter shows up regularly on holiday television.
   Oddly, most films with ``Christmas'' in the title have fared
poorly at the box office.
   ``The Christmas Tree,'' starring William Holden and Virna Lisi,
was a 1969 bomb.
   In 1944, Universal cast its biggest star, Deanna Durbin, in a
grim melodrama with Gene Kelly, ``Christmas Holiday.'' Audiences
voted overwhelmingly for Deanna to return to musicals.
   Other misfires: ``Christmas Eve,'' three wayward sons (George
Raft, Randolph Scott, George Brent) return to their mother (Ann
Harding) for the holiday (1944); ``Christmas in July,'' a tame
satire of the advertising industry by Preston Sturges (1940);
``Christmas in July,'' a soap opera with Barbara Stanwyck and
Dennis Morgan (1945).
   Disney had little luck with ``One Magic Christmas,'' a
Capra-esque fantasy starring Mary Steenburgen and Harry Dean
Stanton.
   The producers of ``Superman'' thought they would have another
box-office bonanza with a big-budget ``Santa Claus: The Movie,''
starring David Huddleston in the title role and Dudley Moore as
chief elf. They thought wrong. The film was the turkey of 1985.
   The most successful film about Christmas has been George
Seaton's ``Miracle on 34th Street,'' starring Edmund Gwenn as a
department store Santa Claus who claims to be the real thing. The
film, which also starred Maureen O'Hara, John Payne and a young
Natalie Wood, has become a television perennial and has now been
colorized _ much to the distress of purists.
   Some other films featuring Christmas: ``The Holly and the Ivy''
(1952), ``The Inn of the Sixth Happiness'' (1958), ``The Bells of
St. Mary's'' (1945), ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' (1941), ``Young
at Heart'' (1954), ``The Apartment'' (1960), ``The Glenn Miller
Story'' (1954), Not to mention ``Santa Claus Conquers the
Martians'' (1980).
