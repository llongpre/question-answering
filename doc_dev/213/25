   Scrooges in Chautauqua County are about to
be visited by a modern day recreation of Charles Dickens' Spirit of
Christmas.
   Charles Ferraro, county commissioner of social services, has
compiled the names of 1,000 people who owe a total of $5.7 million
in overdue payments for child and family support.
   Ferraro's ``SCROOGE'' list _ Support Children, Remember
Obligations, Or Get Embarrassed _ will appear Dec. 20 in full page
advertisements in the county's two daily newspapers.
   ``It just made so much sense when you think about the story of
Scrooge and how in the end, he realized what he was doing and turned
out to be the good guy,'' Ferraro said. ``We are hoping that will
happen to a lot of these people.'' The penny-pinching Ebenezer
Scrooge finally got the Christmas spirit in ``A Christmas Carol''
and helped Tiny Tim and his family.
   Reaction from some of the delinquent parents, who have been
warned in a series of letters, ranged from anger to threats of
lawsuits, Ferraro said.
   ``Its rather amazing to me that a man who can't pay his child
support can afford to hire a lawyer to sue me,'' he said.
   The pay or publicity tactic has social service commissioners in
other counties waiting expectantly, he said. ``We've had many
inquires from other commissioners, and some of them have already
committed themselves to doing the same thing next year.''
   Judy Lamb, head of the Western New York Coalition of Women for
Child Support, said the idea was ``terrific.''
   ``It can take years to get a non-custodial parent to make support
payments, and if a woman decides to resort to a request for
incarceration for the delinquent father, it can take two to three
years before a hearing officer will even make a recommendation for
incarceration,'' Ms. Lamb said.
   Ferraro said the plan was conceived a year ago after he noticed
that overdue payments were increasing each year.
   The idea to print the names was an offshoot of the county's
practice of publishing names of delinquent property taxpayers and
the idea of SCROOGE popped up with a Christmas target date, he said.
