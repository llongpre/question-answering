   ``Scrooged,'' the retelling of the Charles
Dickens Christmas classic starring comedian Bill Murray, opened to
huge box-office business in the first big week of holiday movie
going.
   According to preliminary figures released Monday by Exhibitor
Relations Co., ``Scrooged'' collected $13 million during the
weekend, easily topping second-place finisher ``The Land Before
Time.''
   ``Scrooged,'' based on Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol,'' was
greeted coolly by critics, but set a record for the best five-day
Thanksgiving opening ($18.5 million) for a non-sequel movie. All
box-office proceeds, in fact, were significantly higher than last
weekend, thanks to the holiday and a flurry of new releases.
   ``The Land Before Time,'' which a week ago enjoyed the best
opening ever for an animated film, collected $8.1 million. The film
tells the story of a baby brontosaurus' dangerous journey through a
prehistoric world.
   Another animated movie, ``Oliver and Co.,'' finished third, up a
notch from last week. ``Oliver and Co.,'' employing a variety of
celebrity voices for the tale of a homeless kitten, grossed $6.3
million. The story was inspired by another Dickens tale, ``Oliver
Twist.''
   Debuting at No. 4 was the sequel ``Cocoon: The Return,'' an
updated look at a group of senior citizens enjoying everlasting
youth, with revenues of $5.6 million. It was followed by ``Ernest
Saves Christmas,'' in which an oddball cab driver (Jim Varney) saves
the holidays by driving Santa's sleigh. The movie had sales of $5.2
million.
   The horror movie ``Child's Play,'' featuring a homicidal doll on
the rampage, finished sixth with $4.6 million in sales. ``High
Spirits,'' starring Peter O'Toole as the proprietor of a
ghost-infested Irish castle, ended up seventh with receipts of $2
million.
   In eighth place was ``The Accused,'' starring Jodie Foster and
Kelly McGillis, with sales of $1.6 million. Rounding out the Top 10
were ``Fresh Horses,'' with Molly Ringwald, collecting $1.55 million
in ninth and ``Iron Eagle II,'' starring Louis Gossett, with a
reported gross of $1.35 million in 10th.
   The holiday film season continues to expand this week, with ``The
Naked Gun'' and ``Tequila Sunrise'' opening on Friday.
