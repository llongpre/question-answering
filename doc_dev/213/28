<LEADPARA>  MY DEAR Miss Fezziwig,;   How delightful to hear from you! Uncle Ebenezer is
still grateful for your appearance at the sanity hearing after the publication
of Mr. Dickens' rather sensational report. I know that the testimony of one my
uncle knew in his youth helped sway the jury, although I agree that Mr.
Dershowitz's putting young Timothy Cratchit on the stand was the masterstroke.
I only wish that the shareholders in Scrooge &amp; Marley had been more forgiving,
but I must admit that the firm is doing splendidly under the leadership of Bob
Cratchit. (I suppose we must now call him "Sir Robert.")  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     To respond to your inquiry: I know that Uncle Ebenezer would be grateful
for anything you might wish to send him this Christmas, but your suggestion of
a book seems most appropriate. My uncle's library is quite small. During the
years in which he was involved with Scrooge &amp; Marley, he accumulated very few
volumes. He recently donated a well-thumbed copy of "Trump: The Art of the
Deal" to the jumble sale held by the Widows and Orphans Fund. I fear that
neither it nor the portrait of Mrs. Thatcher he also donated found a taker,
and I discovered afterward that he had consigned them both to the dustbin.;  
As you know, Uncle Ebenezer has become a friend to humankind, so I should
think that the handsome new volume The Circle of Life: Rituals From the Human
Family Album (HarperSanFrancisco, 240 pp., $39.95) would be of great interest
to him. It documents the rituals of birth and childhood, initiation and
adolescence, marriage and adulthood, death and remembrance in cultures around
the world. This is one of those books in which photographs loom larger than
text, although the text is impressive: The introduction is by Gabriel Garcia
Marquez, the afterword by Peter Matthiessen.;   As Uncle Ebenezer has gone
about in the world more, his circle of friends has widened. (Sometimes, I
fear, to his detriment: I'm sure you know that there was never any truth in
the report in the National Enquirer about the relationship between my uncle
and Mrs. Helmsley. They met when Mr. Dershowitz introduced them, and perhaps
my uncle's sincere concern that the lady see that amiability is preferable to
meanness was misinterpreted by observers.) Be that as it may, I think my uncle
might well like one of the two anthologies on the subject of friendship that
appeared this year.;   The Oxford Book of Friendship (Oxford, 364 pp., $24.95)
contains readings on the topic from many sources -- letters, essays, journals,
fiction, poetry and drama, the Bible and the Epic of Gilgamesh -- and many
authors, from Aristotle to Cole Porter. However, the selections are quite
brief, making it a book perhaps more suitable for after-dinner speakers and
authors in search of the apt quotation than for the general reader.;   The
Norton Book of Friendship  (Norton, 608 pp., $25) is a book more likely to be
read by the fireside and shared with a companion. Its editors, Eudora Welty
and Ronald A. Sharp, prefer not to excerpt but to reprint entire texts, so
they don't include passages from novels. The volume begins with a section of
"Invitations" (primarily to dine, including a charming passage about Colette's
mother and a spider who loved chocolate), proceeds to essays (such as Cicero's
"On Friendship," the bane of Latin students), letters (wonderful ones by
Keats), poems, legends and folktales, and concludes with "Farewells"
(appropriately, Robert Burns' "Auld Lang Syne" is the last entry).;   You
inquired if Uncle Ebenezer still clings to the notion that his remarkable
change in character was effected by supernatural agentry. Alas, I fear that it
is so. But it will do no harm to provide him with a few volumes on the
subject. Perhaps the improbable tales of others might convince him that his
experiences were indeed the result of "an undigested bit of beef.";   I am
certain, then, that he would enjoy Victorian Ghost Stories: An Oxford
Anthology  (Oxford University Press, 497 pp., $24.95). It contains tales by
Henry James, Wilkie Collins, Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling and
others (including the ubiquitous Mr. Dickens -- though not, one may be
grateful, his story about my uncle).;   There is apparently no end to the
vogue for such tales. Witness The Literary Ghost: Great Contemporary Ghost
Stories  (Atlantic Monthly Press, 369 pp., $22.95), by such writers as M.F.K.
Fisher, Joyce Carol Oates, Graham Greene, Nadine Gordimer and Isaac Bashevis
Singer. Although these are a cut above the works of Stephen King, they are
rather more likely to bring a blush to the maiden cheek than the ones by the
Victorians. However, Uncle Ebenezer is not squeamish (especially after having
been transported to the site of his own grave!).;   My uncle also delights in
narrating his experiences to the Cratchit children, so perhaps he would
appreciate The Random House Book of Ghost Stories  (Random House, 223 pp.,
$18.95), which is designed for children. The ghosts in these stories are
rather more benign than those in the other volumes. I was particularly struck
by the tale "Laughter in the Dark," by Leon Garfield, which tells of how a
ghost thwarted the aims of a miserly old man. One wonders if ghosts have been
at work of late on Wall Street.;    As you knew Uncle Ebenezer in his school
days, you know how he delighted in Don Quixote, Gulliver's Travels, Tom Jones
and Tristram Shandy as a youth. No doubt he would like some of these volumes
in the hardcover editions that have lately been issued by Alfred A. Knopf in
its Everyman's Library series and by Random House as Modern Library editions.
I myself owned many volumes of the Everyman's Library and the Modern Library
in my youth -- they are far more durable than the paperback editions one
accumulates today, and I am delighted to see the series being revived.
(However, I seem to recall paying much less for such books in my youth than
the $15 to $20 that these cost.) The Everyman's titles range from John Donne's
poems to Pasternak's "Dr. Zhivago." The Modern Library, as its name suggests,
is still more modern, including Borges and Jerzy Kosinski and Philip Roth
among the works of Aristotle and Plato and Plutarch.;   My uncle's well-known
love of the Christmas season makes A New Christmas Treasury  (Viking, 532 pp.,
$25) a most suitable book for him. It contains many of the most familiar works
associated with Christmas -- O. Henry's "Gifts of the Magi," Clement C.
Moore's "A Visit From St. Nicholas," the letter assuring Virginia O'Hanlon
that, yes, there is a Santa Claus -- as well as works by Hans Christian
Andersen, J.M. Barrie, Willa Cather, Robert Louis Stevenson, James Thurber and
Laura Ingalls Wilder, among many others. There are also selections by people
one certainly doesn't associate with Christmas: Truman Capote, John Cheever,
Thomas Hardy, James Joyce, H. L. Mencken and even Feodor Dostoevski. But I
fear that the volume's editor, Mr. Jack Newcombe, is under the misapprehension
that, as he writes, "Dickens . . . seemed to embody the very spirit of the
season." Humbug! say I. It is otherwise a most satisfactory volume.;   The
Clement C. Moore poem included in Mr. Newcombe's treasury is the subject of an
entire volume, The Annotated Night Before Christmas,  edited by Martin Gardner
(Summit Books, 253 pp., $20). Mr. Gardner has previously given us his glosses
on the text of Lewis Carroll's works in "The Annotated Alice" and "The
Annotated Snark." There is in fact little to explicate in the Moore poem,
although presumably very young Americans do not know what sugarplums are, so
Mr. Gardner explains that they are not really plums. Most of the book is given
over to some of the countless parodies of the Moore poem. Thus, one finds "A
Visit From Jack Nicklaus," "A Visit From St. Nicholson" (Jack, that is), "A
Visit From Sid Vicious" and even "A Visit From Saint Woz" (Steve Wozniak,
whose name Mr. Gardner misspells). There are parodies from Mad magazine and
from the New York magazine competition, and some dialect parodies that are
just barely on the safe side of political correctness. A very amusing book if
taken in small doses.;   And finally, I might suggest The Frugal Gourmet
Celebrates Christmas,  by Jeff Smith (Morrow, 297 pp., $25). Uncle Ebenezer is
frugal only in his personal expenditures these days. His generosity was sorely
taxed by the requests for aid that followed the "60 Minutes" profile and the
article in People. The volume of requests was so great that he accepted my
offer to process them. I forwarded most of them to Mr. Percy Ross. The Frugal
Gourmet's cookery book is filled with Christmas and Hanukkah feasting lore --
indeed the photographs alone are a feast in themselves. And it will enable
Uncle Ebenezer to prepare a roast goose dinner -- described, alas, as worthy
of Dickens! -- that will spare his purse for more charitable uses.;   I hope
that this has been of some use to you, dear Miss Fezziwig. A very merry
Christmas to you, and God Bless Us, Every One!; Affectionately,; Fred  </TEXT>
