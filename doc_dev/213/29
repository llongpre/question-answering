From "Pee-Wee's Playhouse" in New York to "Scrooge" in Yorba Linda? 
</P>
<P>
Some might see that as a leap from the extraordinary to the prosaic, but not 
Jeff Raum. He sees the Yorba Linda Civic Light Opera's production of "Scrooge," 
which opens Tuesday, as an opportunity to tap into two sides of his creativity 
at once. The artist who helped develop the surreal environs of television's 
"Playhouse" will perform the title role in the musical production and will 
create the character's distinctive look. 
</P>
<P>
Raum, 30, has done makeup and theatrical design, mostly in New York, for 
several years. Besides transforming a studio into Pee-Wee's playhouse, he 
helped devise much of the elaborate makeup for two major Broadway shows, "I'm 
Not Rappaport" and "Into the Woods." 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys resident manages a company that executes murals, trompe l'oeil and 
other faux finishes for homes and businesses. But he still does occasional 
stage projects. "I just thought ("Scrooge") would be a lot of fun, getting the 
chance to be both a visual artist and a performing artist," he said. "It has 
been great, but a lot of work, too." 
</P>
<P>
Raum spends as much as two hours turning himself from a nice young guy into one 
of the world's sturdiest symbols of mendacity. It takes time to get the 
prosthetic nose just right, then there's the wig to deal with. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The makeup requires a patient hand and attention to detail. "At one point, I go 
out into the audience, so it has to look authentic and hold up to close 
scrutiny. The demands are there," he said. "You can't take it casually." 
</P>
<P>
But the payoff, he continued, is not only a convincing appearance but a 
resonance that the makeup helps bring to his performance. "I really feel my 
personality changing . . . it really clicks when I get the makeup and clothes 
on and feel the character coming through. People have said I'm different during 
dress rehearsals, more real and vivid." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't Raum's first acting role. Although he started feeling early on that 
his talents are more on the technical side, he has acted since high school in 
Cockeysville, a suburb of Baltimore, in professional as well as amateur 
productions of "The Dresser," "A Man for All Seasons," "Twelfth Night" and "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream." 
</P>
<P>
His approach to "Scrooge" is straightforward. "I play him pretty traditionally, 
much the way Dickens' describes him. People go to the show not expecting to see 
something new; they go to see an old friend, so I don't deviate too much from 
what the audience expects." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from the University of Dayton in 1983 with an art degree, Raum 
worked briefly for an advertising firm in Washington, D.C., before moving to 
New York City to join Broadcast Arts, which developed animated television 
commercials and "Pee-Wee's Playhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Though he didn't get a chance to work with Pee-Wee himself, Raum found the 
"Playhouse" job to be a real hoot. "I designed some of the characters, like the 
dinosaur family, the magic screen, Globey and a few others. . . . I enjoyed it 
because it was so off the wall, there was a lot of freedom in the approach." 
</P>
<P>
Raum described his work on "Into the Woods" and "I'm Not Rappaport" as exciting 
and demanding. For "Woods," he applied the makeup for the witch, Rapunzel, the 
wolf and several other key characters; for "Rappaport" he helped age actor Hal 
Linden by about 20 years.
