   Even the ghost of Jack Benny couldn't save
Ebenezer Scrooge on Wednesday when a judge refused to clear the
name of the miserly main character of ``A Christmas Carol.''
   The tongue-in-cheek ruling by Municipal Judge George Choppelas
came at the Court of Historical Review and Appeals, a mock court
that met to decide if the name of the character created by Charles
Dickens should continue to be synonymous with greed and avarice.
   In the past, the court has ruled on such weighty questions as
the existence of Santa Claus or if chicken soup deserved to be
considered Jewish penicillin. Yes on both, the court found.
   The puns during the court's 65th session moved fast with
``little Dickens'' and ``you've been Scrooged'' bringing moans from
100 or so spectators.
   Scrooge, dressed in black and wearing a top hat, pleaded his
case, saying he had been ``sorely hurt by an early, early love.''
   Scrooge, portrayed by retired drama teacher E. Wyman Spalding,
claimed his mentor, Jacob Marley, should be blamed.
   ``It was Marley, Marley,'' he told the judge. ``Marley was the
real Scrooge.''
   The miser was defended by Frank Winston, who said the world
actually owed a debt to ``Eb,'' insisting that comedian Jack
Benny's tightwad image was inspired by the Scrooge character.
   Even the names were familiar, the lawyer said. BENny and
eBENezer. Get it?
   ``Eb was always a grand guy,'' Winston said.
   The references to Benny led Choppelas to try an impression of
the late comedian.
   ``I'm thinking, I'm thinking,'' he said at one point, a slight
Benny tone in his voice.
   Prosecutor Angela Alioto said Scrooge deserved his bad name
despite his change of heart at the end of the novel turned into a
popular Christmas movie.
   ``Those nightmares would scare the hell out of anybody,'' she
said. ``You can't change with a four-hour period of being nice.''
   Scrooge also drew the fire of Noah Griffin, a San Francisco
Examiner columnist who wrote a poem for the event. One stanza read:
   ``But tears from Scrooge were mean and vile
   Befitting but the crocodile.
   His so-called heartfelt transformation
   Was nothing but media manipulation.''
