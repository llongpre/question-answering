   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Everybody knows the ghost of Christmas past in
Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol,'' but less celebrated spooks
have haunted the season for a long time. Here's an account of their
ectoplasmic activities.

   Long before and long after Jacob Marley rattled his rosary of
cash boxes, keys and padlocks at Ebenezer Scrooge, a Christmas
ghost, more surely than Santa, would appear at the fireside of many
a stately home and country inn.
   Holiday guests overstuffed with roast goose and mulled port were
less likely to be dreaming of a white Christmas than having
nightmares about graveyard rats gnawing at the tree ornaments or
goblins kidnapping a church sexton.
   That matter of the vanishing verger was Charles Dickens's first
published Christmas ghost story, inspired by a bedtime tale told by
Mary Weller, the Dickens family nursemaid. She filled his
imagination with the phantoms of evil innkeepers making sausage pies
out of complaining guests and hapless travelers terribly tortured by
rats _ phantoms that reappeared in his annual tales to trim the tree
by.
   Mary herself reappeared in ``The Holly Tree,'' that snowbound inn
on the Yorkshire moors where the storyteller at the fireside reaches
back to the nursery and finds himself ``at the knee of a sallow
woman with a fishy eye, an aquiline nose, and a green gown, whose
specialty was a dismal narrative of a landlord whose visitors
unaccountably disappeared...''
   Your genial host at this early variant of the Bates Motel stole
into the guest rooms by a secret passage, slit their throats then
dispatched the bodies down a trap door to copper cauldrons bubbling
below.
   The pie maker was undone, as Dickens respun the cobwebs of his
childhood, when overheard muttering ``too much pepper!'' in his
troubled sleep.
   Ghosts at Christmas? Why not? A child is born, but the year is
dying: 'Tis the season to be mindful of our mortality.
   All the way back to Bethlehem, when the ox and ass knelt with the
shepherds at the manger and the Magi, magicians or wise men from the
East, came calling, Christmas has been a time of mystery and magic.
   The Christmas ghost is older in tradition than the fir tree
trimmed with lights or stockings hung by the chimney with care. The
horror has always gone with the holly, as the Wise Men knew when
they offered the new-born babe the gift myrrh, a burial spice, from
their camel bags.
   In Victorian times, a ghost for Christmas was as common as a
goose.
   With the publication of ``A Christmas Carol'' in 1843, Charles
Dickens became the acknowledged master of the seasonal spooky story,
which he did not invent but refined into an annual event. Even under
pressure of unfinished novels long past the publisher's deadline, a
grim Dickensian word, he would not give up the Christmas ghost. ``I
am loath to lose the money,'' he admitted, ``and still more so to
leave any gap at Christmas firesides which I ought to fill.''
   Christmas ghosts hovered over the writing desks of Sir Walter
Scott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Wilkie Collins, William Thackeray,
Charles Reade, Rudyard Kipling, Elizabeth Bowen, L.P. Hartley and
Lord Dunsany, to name but a few.
   English, French, Scandinavian and American literature abound with
Christmas ghouls, trolls and goblins.
   Such merry merchants of the macabre as Algernon Blackwood, H.P.
Lovecraft, Sheridan LeFanu, Saki and W.W. Jacobs of ``The Monkey's
Paw'' fame observed Christmas with a grisly gothic gift to their
readers.
   As the last line hauntingly confirms, James Joyce's ``The Dead''
is a classic Christmas ghost story: ``His soul swooned slowly as he
heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly
falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and
the dead.''
   In a holiday tale of malicious merriment, English humorist Jerome
K. Jerome warns guests against spending the night in ``The Blue
Chamber'' of his uncle's country manor. The room is haunted every
Christmas Eve ``by the ghost of a most sinful man who once killed a
Christmas carol singer with a lump of coal'' for singing off key.
   The spirit of this sensitive music lover ``did not like to appear
to be boasting'' but he also dispatched seven street musicians
``counting trombones,'' an ``Italian lad who came to town with a
barrel organ that played nothing but Scotch airs'' and an entire
German oompah band.
   A half-century later in a Christmas issue of the New Yorker,
cartoonist Charles Addams struck another blow for Noel noise
abatement. His fiendish friends are seen up on the roof of their
haunted town house pouring down boiling oil on the carolers gathered
on the front stoop.
   ``What is it that makes human beings at Christmas request a very
carnival of crime?'' asked Ambrose Bierce, lexicographer of ``The
Devil's Dictionary.''
   Sisters in crime Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers always
could be relied upon to contribute a holiday homicide to the
carnival.
   In ``Maigret's Christmas,'' Georges Simenon's Gallic gumshoe
investigates the case of an orphan girl visited by a white bearded
Father Christmas who gives her a large doll, then quickly tears up a
few floorboards. ``You come to me on Christmas day, when you know
that I am alone in my house,'' the junk dealer chuckles to Markheim,
his murderer, in Robert Louis Stevenson's splendid descent into the
seasonal spirit world.
