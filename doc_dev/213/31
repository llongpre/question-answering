   Kenneth W. Cowans's Dec. 24 editorial-page article, "The
Munificent Ebenezer Scrooge," reads as if it might have been
written by the old miser himself. Mr. Cowans states that
"Scrooge's decision not to give to charity and to keep his
capital working instead was the best contribution he could
make to the welfare of the poor." Where were the poor to go
while waiting for this 1830s' "trickle-down" theory to bear
fruit? Scrooge's own words come to mind: "Are there no
prisons? And the workhouses, are they still in operation?"
   Mr. Cowans praises "the hard-headed businessmen like
Ebenezer Scrooge" who reinvested their full year's earnings
without deducting anything for charitable contributions. Such
a practice was at the time, and is still today, not so much
hard-headed as cold-hearted. Whether in the inner cities of
today or in the London of Charles Dickens, acts of kindness
and charity convey life, joy and hope to those in need.

   Perhaps Mr. Cowans needs a nocturnal visit from the same
spirits that visited Scrooge.

   Mr. Cowans may or may not have been serious in praising
Dickens's most notorious skinflint. Even so, he obviously
equates Ebenezer's dour philosophy with that of Ronald Reagan
-- that is to say, the "trickle-down" theory of reinvestment.
But, I do not recall that Dickens indicated that Scrooge ever
did any significant spending or invested his heavy wealth
anyplace but in his own vaults, at least not until after his
somewhat bizarre reborning. However, while he and Mr. Reagan
seemed to have had a number of traits in common, there was at
least one outstanding difference. Mr. Scrooge displayed his
disdain for his fellow countrymen with a scowl; Mr. Reagan,
ever mindful of television, did it with a smile.
