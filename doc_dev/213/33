<LEADPARA>  Likening Gov. Pete Wilson to Ebenezer Scrooge, a coalition of churches and
advocates for the poor Thursday launched a campaign to defeat the governor's
proposed welfare cuts.;   Members of the "Campaign for a Fair Share" said they
also would seek legislation to restore previous welfare cuts and eliminate tax
loopholes for the wealthy.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  PROPOSED WELFARE CUTS CALLED 'SCROOGE APPROACH'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "If the truth be known, Gov. Wilson's proposal is a thinly disguised
Scrooge approach to poor people's lives," said Patricia Whitney-Wise of the
California Council of Churches.;   On Monday, the Republican governor proposed
an initiative for the November 1992 ballot that would cut basic payments under
the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program by 10 percent and by
another 15 percent after able-bodied recipients' first six months on the
welfare rolls.;   The proposal would also limit welfare payments for newcomers
to California and prevent grants from increasing when women on welfare have
additional children. Other provisions would increase food stamp payments by
$20 a month and boost welfare payments to teen-age parents who stay in
school.;   Wilson said the changes were necessary to get more welfare
recipients into the workforce and to help solve the state's budget crisis.;  
The cuts would be on top of a 4.4 percent reduction in AFDC payments that
California imposed in September.;   On Thursday, the opposition campaign held
a Capitol news conference with a cardboard cutout of Wilson dressed in
Victorian clothing and with cartoon bubble containing the words, "Bah
Humbug.";   "We may look like a bunch of carolers, but we find it difficult to
celebrate when the governor has launched a campaign against children,
unemployed mothers, seniors, the disabled and other low-income people in our
state," said Callie Hutchison of the California Homeless and Housing
Coalition.;   Whitney-Wise read a selection from Charles Dickens' "A Christmas
Carol," in which a miserly Scrooge refuses to give money to two men collecting
donations for the poor.;   "We in the council have already seen the increase
of families living on the streets and coming to our doors as the result of the
1991 budget cuts," Whitney-Wise said. "The governor's latest proposal will
force more families into homelessness and some of them will die.";   The
Western Center on Law and Poverty released a study that disputes Wilson's
claims that the size of California's welfare grants encourages people to move
to the state, have more children and shirk work.;   The report, titled "Easy
Targets," says the typical welfare family is a 30-year-old mother and two
children who have received AFDC payments for less than two years.  </TEXT>
