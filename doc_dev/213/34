<LEADPARA>  It was as if Patty Fisher was playing the part of the Spirit of Christmas
Future from "A Christmas Carol" for the public schools and teachers in "Long
limping, schools finally fall" (Commentary, Dec. 22).;   Let us not forget
that in "A Christmas Carol," Scrooge is visited by three spirits. It is the
Spirit of Christmas Past who enlightens Scrooge about the financial decisions
he made earlier in his life, which cost him much in emotional happiness and
set him on a path of isolation and selfishness. Teachers might do well to
consider how well the decision to unionize has served them and what it truly
has cost them.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Spirit of Christmas Present allows Scrooge to see what his life had
become and exactly what people thought of him behind his back. (The public has
grown weary of the public schools' lack of performance and teachers' academic
elitism, isolationism and unionism. More and more of the public no longer
wishes to support what it perceives as a non-productive, non-responsive,
self-serving bureaucracy. Many are seeking ways to rid themselves of these
ills (especially teachers who don't teach and can't be fired). Ergo the rise
of the voucher system.;   In "A Christmas Carol," Scrooge asks the Spirit of
Christmas Future if what he had been shown were shadows of what would be or
shadows of what might be? Having seen the error of his ways, Scrooge also
realized that his future was yet to be, and he did indeed have a chance to
change it. Therefore he set about changing his ways, and goodwill and
happiness returned to his life. Thus ends the story of "A Christmas Carol.";  
The question is, what spirits have the public schools and schoolteachers seen
this Christmas? I believe it is within their power to summon all the public
goodwill and support they will need to subdue any problems presented them in
the future. If -- and this is a big if -- they, like Scrooge, understand what
part they played in making the present, and if they seek to change the errors
(the isms) of their past, they can do this. They will lead us into a new and
enlightened era of public education for the benefit of all.;   But on the
other hand, if they choose to excuse themselves from, and to blame others for
what has brought them to this time and place, the future may very well be like
that foretold by Patty Fisher, "the Spirit of Christmas Future.";   -- Robert
