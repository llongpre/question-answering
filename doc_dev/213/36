Christmas, it often seems, means Dickens. You can see why. There is Scrooge,
of course, and the Spirits of Christmas Past, Present and To Come; there are
the affecting snow scenes in several other novels. And there is the love of
family and friends to which he so often returns.
Since Dickens has always prompted British character actors to their most
acute performances (there have been at least three new British stagings of
Great Expectations since early September), it is no wonder that several new
Dickens stagings occur this Christmas in London.
A Christmas Carol comes to the Barbican, in the world premiere of a new
adaptation by John Mortimer, directed by Ian Judge, with Clive Francis as
Scrooge, opening on December 6. (Meanwhile in Manchester Scrooge runs for
two months at the Palace Theatre.)
Oliver, the Lionel Bart musical version of Oliver Twist, comes to the
Palladium in an important new production by Sam Mendes, starring Jonathan
Pryce as Fagin (also starring Ruthie Henshall, Sally Dexter), opening on
December 8. At the Battersea Arts cafe, Sketches by Boz, adapted by critic
Robert Butler, with music by Stephen Lade and directed by Graham Sinclair,
opens on November 29. And a new version of A Tale of Two Cities by Matthew
Francis opens at Greenwich Theatre on December 19.
But Christmas can also mean novelty; and a surprising number of new or
modern plays comes to the West End in this period. One of the Royal Court's
most acclaimed novelties this year, My Night with Reg, by Kevin Elyot and
directed by Roger Michell, is opening at the Criterion Theatre in late
November. Pinter's supreme (and very short) one-act play Landscape comes to
the Cottesloe Theatre, in the staging (by Pinter himself) which was the
highlight of this May's superb Pinter festival at the Gate Theatre, Dublin,
and very nearly of all 1994; Penelope Wilton and Ian Holm star.
On November 29, Richard Nelson's New England has its world premiere with the
RSC at the Pit; Peter Gill directs, and the cast includes Angela Thorne.
Described as 'humorous and ironic', it deals with the feelings of English
exiles in America. The Theatre de Complicite opens its latest production,
Out of a House walked a man . . ., at the Lyttelton Theatre on December 1;
directed by Simon McBurney with a cohort of Complicite stars (Kathryn
Hunter, Toby Jones, Marcello Magni, Toby Sedgwick). And on December 13,
Slavs, the latest play by Tony Kushner (he of Angels in America) opens at
the Hampstead Theatre, with an illustrious cast including Annette Badland,
Ron Cook, Imelda Staunton, Paul Jesson, and Aisling O'Sullivan; Matthew
Lloyd directs. The subtitle is Thinking about the Longstanding Problems of
Virtue and Happiness.
Meanwhile, at the Bush Theatre, the excellent Dominic Dromgoole directs an
'epic' production of Raising Fires (opening on November 25), a prize-winning
new play by Jenny McLeod: desire, revenge, and arson in 16th xentury Essex
around Tilda, the town's first black woman. And, on December 1 in
Scarborough, Alan Ayckbourn presents, and directs, his third new play this
year: The Musical Jigsaw Play.
Christmas also means children's stories - by Kenneth Grahame, Hans Christian
Andersen, the Brothers Grimm, et al - several of which reach our stages this
year. The 1990 Alan Bennett version of A Wind in the Willows returns to the
Olivier Theatre on December 15, for what is said to be its final revival. At
the Young Vic (opening on December 7), the poet Carol Ann Duffy adapts Grimm
Tales (eight of them), directed by Tim Supple. At the Lyric Hammersmith
(opening December 12), Neil Bartlett adapts and directs Andersen's The
Little Match Girl; the effects, by Forkbeard Fantasy, include nine-foot
teddy-bears, dancing Christmas dinners, live satellite links to heaven, and
disreputable angels.
In BAC Studio One (Battersea, opening on December 7), Tom Smith directs
Peter Pan, an Edwardian Fantasy. And, straight after Christmas, the
unclassifiable Music Theatre London brings to the Queen Elizabeth Hall its
1992 hit version of Rossini's Cinderella (Cinderella's father is Essex man;
her step-sisters are played by men; Prince Charming is played by a woman).
Christmas, since it involves carols, also just means, for many people,
musicals. New British musical productions include Out of the Blue (opening
later this month at the Shaftesbury), two versions of Calamity Jane (one
opening at the Leicester Haymarket on November 22, one at the BAC,
Battersea, on December 9), and Phyllida Lloyd's staging of The Threepenny
Opera at the Donmar Warehouse (opening on December 14).
