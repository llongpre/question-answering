From Orange County to Santa Barbara, theaters ring in the holidays with 
"Christmas Carols," "Christmas Memories" and a Hanukkah program; "Annie" is in 
town; Santa beams down from the North Pole and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick 
Stewart) beams down from the Starship Enterprise to the 19th-Century world of 
Charles Dickens. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of the theatrical holiday season, from intimately staged readings 
to lavish spectaculars, familiar fairy tales and off-the-wall comedy.
