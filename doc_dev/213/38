   ``The Naked Gun,'' a spoof of television police
shows, and ``Scrooged,'' a slapstick update of a classic Christmas
story, touched the hearts and wallets of the nation's moviegoers
last weekend.
   ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,'' which stars
Leslie Nielsen as a hardboiled detective who stumbles on a murder
plot, rated first place at the box office, earning $9.3 million in
its first weekend of release.
   ``Scrooged,'' featuring Bill Murray as a modern day Scrooge in
the retelling of ``A Christmas Carol,'' was second with $7.5
million, according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations
Co.
   Making its debut in third place with $6.3 million was ``Tequila
Sunrise,'' a steamy thriller starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Mel Gibson
and Kurt Russell.
   Animated films followed in a close race. ``The Land Before Time''
was No. 4 with $3.5 million and ``Oliver and Co.,'' followed with
$3.1 million.
   ``The Land Before Time,'' about a baby brontosaurus making a
dangerous journey through a prehistoric land, had the best-ever
opening for an animated film three weeks ago.
   ``Oliver and Co.'' recounts Dickens' ``Oliver Twist'' tale, using
the voices of Lily Tomlin, Cheech Marin and Billy Joel, among others.
   Another Christmas theme movie _ ``Ernest Saves Christmas'' placed
sixth with $2.3 million.
