Since the advent of video, my friends and I have gathered in an annual 
endurance test of holiday cheer. We have thrown Christmas Movie Marathons. 
</P>
<P>
After raiding a video store or two, we sit back for 24 hours or so, basking in 
the season. Some people may want to split their viewing over several weeknights 
or even a few weekends, but those who manage to sit straight through everything 
will find it a wonderful sensation. As the films flicker by, the marathoner may 
feel his or her heart grow to two or three times its normal size. 
</P>
<P>
First, there are the television specials (yeah, I know I said movie marathon 
but Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without a few of these TV classics now 
available on video. Try shuffling them up and watching them between the real 
movies). 
</P>
<P>
This year, several specials directed by the inimitable team of Arthur Rankin 
Jr. and Jules Bass have been released for sale and rental. "The Little Drummer 
Boy" is a charming little piece that may remind one of the sometimes forgotten 
role played at Christmas by the baby Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
And what would the holidays be without "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"? This 
Rankin and Bass tale is narrated by a Burl Ives snowman and features many 
holiday tunes. Such fun characters as prospecting Yukon Cornelius and a 
bouncing Abominable Snowman highlight this tale of misfits in search of 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin and Bass' "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" finds Fred Astaire narrating 
the story of Santa, letting us know just who he is and how he came to be. More 
toe-tapping tunes and endearing characters lace this favorite. (Incidentally, 
if Hollywood is listening, "The Year Without a Santa Claus," the 
rarely-televised story about the year when Santa couldn't deliver toys because 
of the worst blizzard in history, should be released on video. The singing and 
dancing Heat Miser is sorely missed.) 
</P>
<P>
"A Very Merry Cricket" is a wonderful animated special written and directed by 
Chuck Jones of Looney Tunes fame. It tells the tale of a cricket who brings 
Times Square to a halt with his Christmas caroling. Jones' best-known 
directorial effort is the quintessential Christmas TV special, "How the Grinch 
Stole Christmas," written by Dr. Suess and narrated by Boris Karloff. My group 
continually promises to save this one for the end of the marathon, as sort of 
its crowning glory, but none of us can ever wait that long to see it. 
</P>
<P>
And, just as we need to see the Grinch carve the roast beast, we need to hear 
Linus' soulful telling of the Christmas Story, and to watch Charlie Brown 
rescue a forgotten little Christmas tree, and to hear the Peanuts' gang's 
rendition of "Hark the Herald Angels Sing" in "A Charlie Brown Christmas." If 
you've only got one hour for Christmas viewing, Charlie Brown and the Grinch 
can fill it with decades worth of Christmas memories and cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Onto the movies! John Hughes' "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" is a good 
starting point even though it is a Thanksgiving film. Steve Martin is trying to 
get home to spend the holiday with his family. The hazards of the road and John 
Candy get in his way, and make for an exceptional film loaded with laughs and 
laced with a human warmth that should bring a lump to the heartiest throat. 
</P>
<P>
A good follow-up is "Miracle on 34th Street," the version that stars Edmund 
Gwenn as the bearded gent who must convince a very young Natalie Wood -- and a 
courtroom -- that he truly is the real Santa. (Again, you should only invite 
people to your marathon who will not mind displays of emotion. Both movies 
listed so far, and most that follow, are guaranto teed tear-wellers). 
</P>
<P>
For a change of a pace, you might want to add "The Nutcracker," especially the 
lavish American Ballet Theatre production that features Mikhail Baryshnikov as 
both star and choreographer. The National Philharmonic's spirited rendition of 
Tchaikovsky's score rounds out this excellent choice. 
</P>
<P>
If you wish to delve further down the fantasy path, try "March of the Wooden 
Soldiers." This 1934 film with Laurel and Hardy is the original "Babes in 
Toyland" and is far superior to the Disney remake (with Annette Funicello and 
Tommy Sands) that most people rent unwittingly. Although this film includes 
some tunes that are far from exciting, Laurel and Hardy are great fun as the 
toy maker's assistants who must save the storybook town. 
</P>
<P>
"A Christmas Carol" is a must, but which version? I recommend the 1951 
black-and-white one with Alastair Sim as Scrooge. It is well written and the 
acting is superb, on top of which you don't have to listen to Albert Finney 
sing. And Dickens' bleak world plays best in black and white, as a place of 
shadow and light. (You may want to consider before renting that this film is 
for sale at just slightly more than the rental fee. It makes an excellent 
addition to a home library and even comes in a specially priced gift package 
with the next film in our marathon: "It's a Wonderful Life." 
</P>
<P>
For many people, this classic is at the top of the Christmas film list. If you 
have not yet enjoyed the tale of Jimmy Stewart taking a peek at what the world 
would have been like had he never been born, what are you waiting for?!? There 
is a colorized version, but avoid it like the plague. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the black-and-white vein, "The Bishop's Wife" stars Cary Grant as an 
angel who attempts to reconcile David Niven's stagnating marriage by making 
moves on Niven's wife. Both funny and touching, it'll leave you smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bells of Saint Mary's" is the exceptional sequel to the Academy 
Award-winning "Going My Way." Bing Crosby, returning to his role as a 
modern-minded priest, finds himself at a parochial school butting heads with 
Ingrid Bergman's Mother Superior. It's a delightful film with many warm 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
"Holiday Inn" finds Crosby and Fred Astaire singing, dancing and fighting over 
women. It also marks the first appearance of Irving Berlin's classic "White 
Christmas" (later reprised in a film named after the song and again featuring 
Crosby, this time with sidekick Danny Kaye). If you're a Bing fan, "Holiday 
Inn" is a must. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas in Connecticut" is a screwball comedy starring Barbara Stanwyck as a 
newspaper columnist whom people turn to for advice in family matters. The 
problem is that she's not the Susie Homemaker type she pretends to be; she's 
really tough and streetwise. For the sake of publicity (and her job), she has 
to find house and husband for the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the '40s and into the '80s with "Ernest Saves Christmas." Yes, an Ernest 
film. I admit to being a fan, but even non-Ernest fans might love this one, a 
very funny story about Ernest's efforts to help an old Santa pass on his 
gift-giving skills to an overweight children's show host. Even though you may 
not entirely buy the borderline, maudlin runaway-girl subplot, this is still a 
film that should make you say, "Hey! It's Christmas . . . and I like it!" 
</P>
<P>
There's more Christmas comedy from John Hughes in "National Lampoon's Christmas 
Vacation" as Chevy Chase returns as Clark Griswald, the consummate family man 
trying to have a real family Christmas. Naturally, nothing goes right. From his 
harpy in-laws to the unexpected arrival of rural cousin Randy Quaid, Chevy's 
Christmas takes one downward slide after another. 
</P>
<P>
A true gem is "A Christmas Story," with Peter Billingsley (better known as 
Messy Marvin) as a boy who wants a Red Ryder air gun for Christmas. He schemes 
diligently to get one, only to hear from everyone -- including a department 
store Santa -- that he'll shoot his eye out. It's a charming, nostalgic look at 
youth and a bygone era. Darren McGavin plays the boy's father with a 
delightfully silly quality. If you haven't saved the Grinch or "It's a 
Wonderful Life" for last, you might want to consider "A Christmas Story" as the 
crown of your marathon. 
</P>
<P>
A very funny version of the "Christmas Carol" tale is Richard Donner's 
"Scrooged," with Bill Murray as a practically soulless television executive who 
receives the ghostly visitations of Christmas Past, Present and Future. How can 
you not like a movie that proposes a television special entitled "The Night the 
Reindeer Died" complete with explosions and Lee Majors? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there'll be a new addition to my group's marathon this year: "Die 
Hard." Yes, the Bruce Willis action flick about a lone New York cop up against 
a gang of ruthless, bloodthirsty burglars. Aside from the bullets and blood, 
you see, it's a film about a man trying to win his family back. He's come to 
Los Angeles to spend Christmas with them. Some people will argue for "Lethal 
Weapon" on the same grounds: It, too, takes place in the holiday season. Mel 
Gibson must learn to overcome the death of his wife, people get shot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One last note: for the truly warped, there is a film called "Silent Night, 
Deadly Night," which finds Santa running around chopping people up with an ax. 
This one has the distinction of having had its ads pulled from television 
because they were scaring little children and it most likely will not be in my 
group's marathon.
