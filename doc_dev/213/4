<LEADPARA>  EVERY COUPLE of years, someone in Hollywood decides to remake Charles Dickens'
"A Christmas Carol." Despite the various versions -- comedies, musicals,
television miniseries and cartoons -- the story has lost none of its power. In
fact, the fable of how four ghosts redeem a wayward skinflint may be even more
relevant today than it was to its 19th century audience.;   This Christmas
season, I've decided to offer my own version of the classic story, featuring:  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The American middle class as Bob Cratchit. Overworked and underpaid,
Cratchit can barely make ends meet. Like many of today's overtaxed Americans,
Cratchit has to rent a home because he can't afford the down payment on a
house, has no savings account, has no idea how he will finance his kids'
education and this year can't afford to give his children the kind of
Christmas they deserve.;   President Bush as Scrooge. A basically good man,
Scrooge was led astray by his "friend" and partner, Marley, who convinced him
that money is the key to happiness. Similarly, Bush was convinced last year by
his "friends" in Congress -- and in his own administration -- that more taxes
and more government pork would help the economy.;   Supporters of the 1990 tax
hike as the Ghost of Marley. Shackled by chains, Marley returns from the dead
to warn Scrooge to reform before he, too, becomes the victim of his own greed.
Like Marley, many of the supporters of the 1990 Budget Boondoggle now are
worried about the damage they caused by raising taxes, and are calling for tax
cuts to help revive the economy.;   Ronald Reagan as the Ghost of Christmas
Past. In the Dickens version, the ghost shows Scrooge how good things were
before he was corrupted. In my version, Christmas Past reminds Scrooge of the
economic growth and prosperity created by the 1991 Kemp-Roth tax cuts: 20
million new jobs, 6 million new businesses and a 32 percent increase in real
gross national product.;   Free-market conservatives as the Ghost of Christmas
Present. In the Dickens tale, this ghost opens Scrooge's eyes to the damage
his uncaring greed has caused. The free-market version points out that the
average American -- who pays more than 40 percent of his income in federal,
state and local taxes -- is in need of tax relief.;   And any liberal as the
Ghost of Christmas Future. The last ghost to visit Scrooge shows him how he
will be rewarded if he continues his greedy ways: with an early, unmourned
death. Similarly, the ghostly liberal shows Scrooge/Bush the "rewards" of
higher taxes, runaway government spending and increased regulation: a
depressed economy, millions of Americans out of work and a liberal victory in
the 1992 elections.;   The end of "A Christmas Carol" is a happy one. Scrooge
-- after his ghostly vision thing -- awakens a changed man and immediately
runs out to spread the message of "peace on earth and goodwill to men.";   The
Washington version also could have a happy ending. All our modern Scrooge
needs to do is come up with a vision for putting the economy back on track.;  
For starters, he might want to give taxpayers a Christmas present by
guaranteeing that reductions in the defense budget will be returned to them in
the form of a tax cut, rather than squandered on congressional pork.;   Let's
make this the merriest of Christmases, and put the humbugs behind us.  </TEXT>
