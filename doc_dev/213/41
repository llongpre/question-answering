"It's a hard-boiled detective serial -- except all the roles are reversed," 
said Anita Merzell, whose radio spoof "The Case of the Purloined Sterling" 
(opening Wednesday at Actors Alley in Sherman Oaks) boasts a tough-talking 
female private eye. "All the he-man behavior is performed by Shayna Goldberg, 
and the fainting characters are the men she leaves behind, in her pursuit of 
peace, justice and the American way." 
</P>
<P>
In the spirit of "The Maltese Falcon," Shayna is also in pursuit of valuable 
booty: in this case, the Flaming Tahitian Sunset silverware passed down from 
her grandmother to her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"Shayna's no-good boyfriend, Bernie, steals the silverware, which sets her on a 
quest from New Jersey to Peekskill to Sing-Sing, on a train to San Francisco 
and a boat to Cairo," Merzell said. "Along the way, she meets some bizarre 
characters who both help and hinder her: her mentor-bookie Mad Rabbi Mordechai, 
the mysterious Dr. Chu and his sex slave Rod Todd, whom the silverware falls 
to. So Shayna follows him to the tomb of a long-dead Jewish princess in the 
Valley of the Kings. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Four actors and one singer play the 20-odd characters. As with old-time 
broadcasts, the sound effects are provided by an on-stage collection of 
creative noisemakers. "We have traditional effects, like a pumpkin being 
dropped for a dead body," Merzell noted. "We also have untraditional ones, like 
a basketball -- also dropped for a dead body -- bouncing a few times. And the 
actors will have their scripts in hand, making costume changes as the scene 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
The writer-actress (who's also playing Shayna) won't reveal her age, but 
emphasizes that she doesn't personally remember radio drama. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the information we get in our generation has been from film and TV," 
she pointed out. "I started thinking about what it would be like to get it from 
the radio -- or sit in the audience during one of these broadcasts. So when I 
was in San Francisco developing this, I did a lot of research, listened to old 
radio shows. We've also written some funny commercials and used old news 
broadcasts to give people a flavor for the era -- then turned it on its ear. 
It's looking with an affectionate, funny eye at where we were, and where we are 
now."

December is the month for Christmas plays, Hanukkah plays, holiday satires . . 
. and a couple of nondenominational pursuits. The small but eclectic roster of

past. It's written and directed by Justin Tanner, whose "Zombie Attack!" is
