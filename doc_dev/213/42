Charlie C and Malcolm X. Only through the world-shrinking,
history-scrambling quirks of movie production could the two have ever come
together.
Films about real people are called 'bio-pics': partly, one suspects, because
they are grown with the fertiliser of artistic presumption. Take a famous
fellow - Chaplin, Emile Zola, Napoleon, Gandhi, Malcolm X - and water him
with a few drops of liquid feed compounded from (equal parts) wild surmise,
canonisation and a democratising Everymanness.
Then watch your hero grow from someone real, measurable and idiomatic into
someone bland and generic enough to command a two or three-hour movie. Sir
Richard Attenborough's Chaplin is all about a handsome chap with curly hair
and quirky accent (it starts Elephant and Castle cockney, it ends Belgravia
posh) who floated through Hollywood between 1914 and 1952. Much of the time
this chap appears bewildered: partly because his life has been scripted by
four different people - Bryan Forbes, William Boyd, William Goldman and
(uncredited) Tom Stoppard - and partly because he is impersonated by a
fifth, Robert Downey Jr, who is brilliant when allowed to clown, comatose
when not.
Yet Chaplin, for all its faults, is a gust of pleasure compared with Malcolm
X. This, coming to British screens shortly, was witnessed by me a week ago
in Los Angeles. In the bio-pic cosmos Spike Lee's film is Yang to
Attenborough's Yin. Where Chaplin is a victim of innocence, stumbling into
aesthetic voids in the course of a well-meaning search for the Little Chap's
tragicomic essence, Lee's film is a disingenuous bland-out. Hustling its
hero through recent political history, it dodges controversial issues like a
soldier serpentining between bullets on a battlefield.
In both films the real-life subject is replaced by an expanded
glamorisation. But where Attenborough falls hapless victim to the
ineluctability of commercial movie tradition - gotta have a hero you can
like and understand rather than someone too prickly or protean (like Chaplin
himself) - Spike Lee uses that hagiographic trend as a propagandist tool.
In the role of race-war hate prophet Malcolm X he has cast Denzel
Washington, black cinema's Mr Nice Guy, best known for sweetening Steven
Biko in (Attenborough's) Cry Freedom. As a result, there is no sense of the
acrid aggressiveness with which the real Malcolm X played to black crowds
but which might, of course, have sent white audiences hurtling from the
cinema.
Malcolm X the movie, like Chaplin, pretends to portray a switchbacking life.
The civil rights leader did recant his own hate arias in late career,
converted to a gentler propagandism shortly before his own assassination.
But the conversion is meaningless - or impactless - in a movie where we
scarcely sense those hate arias to begin with. Even Malcolm X's notoriously
approving response to Kennedy's killing - 'The chickens have come home to
roost' - is camouflaged in a montage sequence where sounds and images are
pixillated to distract us from their content.
Chaplin owes its switchbacking structure to a different conversion: the
hero's change from silent-era supercomic to showbiz celebrity mugged by
history. This was not just movie history - the dooming effect of the sound
era on a performer whose work was grounded in mime - but political history.
Chaplin the man fell foul of the postwar American epidemic of anti-Communism
and Chaplin the movie suggests that even some of his troubles with women -
notably a litigious paternity suit - were the dark work of the FBI.
Could be true. But then almost anything in Chaplin could be true. Framing
the story with Swiss-set scenes of a white-haired Charlie discussing his
memoirs with his publisher (Anthony Hopkins), Attenborough and his scribes
make the film a giant flashback as if to say to the audience, 'Dispute what
you like. This is an old man's recall, not holy writ.'
Yet having taken this licence, they fail to use it interestingly. Charlie
recalls, it seems, only in cliches. His Ma (Geraldine Chaplin) is a
draggle-clothed cockney with a Monty Python line in penurious household
budgeting ('Sorry, it's only fish-'eads again, me darlins'.) The great
swashbuckler Doug Fairbanks (Kevin Kline) is introduced - yes - swinging
from a chandelier. And silent director Mack Sennett (Dan Aykroyd) is a
photo-fit assemblage of bullhorn, barking command and work mottoes designed
to tickle modern audiences' hindsight laughter ('I never make more than two
pictures a week').
The cartoonish approach might have earned its passage, if sustained and
intensified. But as Chaplin himself ages, so does the film's style. With the
comic practitioner pushed aside by the serial husband and suspected commie,
all the initially animated Robert Downey can do is to stand centre-screen,
arteries stiffening as he is assailed by a sirocco of subplots. Allowing
Chaplin to be his own first-person narrator - which may have seemed an
inspired idea at first - ends up playing straight into the hands of Bad
Bio-pic Practice. The hero freezes into a bland reactive icon, surrounded by
a cast of compensatingly exaggerated movers and shakers.
Throughout both Chaplin and Malcolm X we long for glimpses - and
occasionally get them - of the real man behind the movie surrogate. Each
time the real comedian or activist crackles forth from some old newsreel,
high-diving into a slapstick pond or haranguing from a fiery podium, we
suddenly see or hear what we have been missing. Danger. Surprise.
Attraction. Revulsion. Hilarity. Outrage. All those uneven, vivid,
corrugated emotions that are crushed smooth by the genuflecting gestures of
the bio-pic.
Meanwhile, Christmas draws on apace. And what more seasonal than The Muppet
Christmas Carol, directed by Brian Henson, son of the late great Jim? This
has Michael Caine's Scrooge adrift in a Victorian London packed with rats,
frogs, pigs, bears and creatures beyond description. Most of these animals
are gifted with the power of speech: not least the Great Gonzo as one
'Charles Dickens.'
This is very enjoyable and absurd for about 30 minutes, after which drama
and sentiment take over. Jerry Juhl's script becomes too obsequious to the
original, leaving the Muppets to mug frantically in the few seconds they get
between the Scrooge-and-ghost set pieces. Kermit gulps away prettily as Bob
Cratchit. Fozzie Bear shines for a millisecond as factory-owner 'Fozziwig.'
But Miss Piggy, wasted as Emma Cratchit, practises a porcine sneer in
preparation for better roles.
Mo' Money is a cops-and-robbers comedy scripted by black star Damon Wayans
(The Last Boy Scout). Wayans and real-life brother Marlon play two
knockabout con persons who, between scams, help the police expose big
business corruption. Fearlessly democratic in its offensiveness, the film
lampoons lawmakers and lawbreakers alike: not to mention cripples, junkies,
mental patients, paranoiacs, para-feminists, whole-earthists, half-earthists
and Uncle Tomism and all. It is so ill-behaved it is almost charming. Or am
I just suffering from pre-Christmas concussion?
Cool World may have contributed to that state if I am. Imagine a cartoon
dimension where migrated humans (Brad Pitt, Gabriel Byrne) turn into painted
likenesses of themselves and where painted nymphets long to depart so they
can turn into real earthy beauties. One such nymphet departs to become Kim
Basinger. But the strain proves too much and she returns to cartoondom.
Ralph Bakshi (Fritz The Cat, Lord Of The Rings) designed and directed this
live-action/animation folly, which is every bit as whimsical, circular and
one-idea as it sounds.
