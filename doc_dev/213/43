This year offers a bumper selection pack of Dickens in London. Over the next
fortnight Oliver] opens in the West End, A Christmas Carol at the RSC, A
Tale of Two Cities at Greenwich and The Oxford Stage Company brings its
adaptation of Great Expectations to Richmond. With Martin Chuzzlewit still
rolling along on BBC2 and Hard Times scheduled for Christmas Day, there is
no escape from his gallery of rogues.
The enterprising Battersea Arts Centre has come up with a little hors
d'oeuvre to whet your appetite for the meatier Dickens to follow in the
shape of Sketches by Boz, an evening of newspaper articles by the young
novelist. The evening is conceived as an old-fashioned 'entertainment'
mounted, cabaret-style, in the cafe, where candles on the tables and food
and drink on offer create a convivial atmosphere.
On stage a cast of five work their way through half a dozen sketches adapted
for stage by Robert Butler and spliced together in Fair Play Theatre
Company's production with sardonic little ditties of the time. A
Dickens-like master of ceremonies at a lectern links the scenes and
occasionally stoops, with marvellous disdain, to speak the words of some
unsavoury character or other. The only other props are a piano, a table and
a couple of chairs, and round these the company presents a parade of
grotesques and unfortunates.
You can certainly see the young Dickens sharpening his satirical pencil for
the characters that were to people his novels. There is the gauche, gaunt Mr
Watkins Tottle, whose faint heart is trampled on by an unscrupulous 'friend'
and an insensitive young woman; there is the Scrooge-like killjoy who
delights in ruining his godson's Christening party; there is an artful
dodger deported by a judge who never looks up from his paperwork, and a trip
to the pawnbrokers reveals a cauldron of miserable souls.
The show gradually spirals downhill until the last sketch brings us to the
cell of a condemned prisoner in Newgate, Dickens writing with all his might
to convey to his readers the terror and misery of a man in such
circumstances.
These are clearly the work of an angry young man, who writes with more heart
than head in places - 'The Black Veil' is particularly melodramatic. But
this evening of miniatures, performed by a spry, witty company, is an
illuminating introduction to the young writer who was to become such a
household name - and seasonal companion.
