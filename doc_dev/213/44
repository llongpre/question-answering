   Christmas packages are arriving early at the
nation's theaters as movie companies try to lure holiday trade with
ghosts, hip dogs, baby dinosaurs and Bill Murray romping about in
yet another version of Charles Dickens' seasonal favorite, ``A
Christmas Carol.''
   Industry sources estimate that the holiday season will bring $300
million dollars worth of films. Why so many expensive films at
year's end?
   ``Because the six weeks from Thanksgiving through New Years Day
is the second biggest period of theater attendance, exceeded only by
summer,'' said Art Murphy, Daily Variety's financial expert. ``Those
six weeks amount to l4 percent of the year's business.
   ``It's unusual because the period includes a `chasm,' the second
week in December. That's the worst week of the year because children
are finishing school and others are Christmas shopping.''
   `Tis the season to be jolly, and the studios are responding with
a host of comedies. In ``High Spirits,'' Peter O'Toole attempts to
pass off his rundown hotel as a haunted castle, and ghosts,
including Daryl Hannah, actually appear.
   Dan Aykroyd in ``My Stepmother Is an Alien'' is a widowed
scientist who falls in love with spaceling Kim Basinger. Cybil
Shepherd discovers in ``Chances Are'' that her daughter's boyfriend,
Robert Downey Jr., is the reincarnation of her late husband.
   Also in the comedy grabbag is another treatment of the Dickens'
classic, ``A Christmas Carol.'' In Warner Bros. ``Scrooged'' Bill
Murray plays a crass TV executive who tries to exploit the Christmas
spirit but gets caught up in his own scheme.
   There's also ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,''
with Leslie Nielsen and Ricardo Montalban as opponents in a
reworking of the memorable but brief 1982 TV series ``Police Squad.''
   Michael Caine and Steve Martin team as con men on the French
Riviera in ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.''
   Ivan Reitman (``Ghost Busters'') would have us believe in
``Twins'' that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito actually are.
   Parents will be pleased to learn that two new animated features
will appear during the holidays. ``Oliver and Company,'' a new twist
on ``Oliver Twist,'' with such voices as Bette Midler and Billy
Joel, bears the Disney imprint. It's about a bunch of rather hip
dogs and a cute little kitten who tangle with a loan shark and learn
what friendship is all about.
   Steven Spielberg and George Lucas acted as executive producers on
the dinosaur epic, ``The Land Before Time,'' produced by Disney
defector Don Bluth.
   The holidays are also a time for drama since the studios bring
forth their Academy Award hopefuls before the December 31 deadline
for qualification. Here are some of the most promising:
   ``Rain Man,'' with Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise as brothers on a
trip across the United States.
   ``Beaches,'' with Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey as long-time
friends striving to survive marriages and careers.
   ``Mississippi Burning,'' with Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as
FBI agents investigating the murder of three civil rights workers in
the 1964 South. Based on an actual case.
   ``Talk Radio,'' Oliver Stone's (``Platoon'') version of the Eric
Bogosian play about an abrasive radio talk show host. Bogosian stars.
   ``Torch Song Trilogy,'' with Harvey Fierstein, Anne Bancroft and
Matthew Broderick in Fierstein's play about gay life in New York.
   ``Working Girl,'' with Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver and
Melanie Griffith in a drama-comedy about corporate life and love.
   The other attractions include: ``Cocoon II: The Return,'' with
most of the cast returning; and ``Tequila Sunrise'' with Mel Gibson
as a drug dealer who wants out of the business and Kurt Russell as a
narcotics cop who's his friend.
   No matter how these films fare with audiences, Daily Variety's
Murphy predicts another record year for the movie business.
   ``Grosses are already $130 million ahead of last year, and so
1988 is certain to pass the 1987 record of $4.25 billion.''
