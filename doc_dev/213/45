   An oil painting featuring Walt Disney
characters Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge has been sold for $75,000,
it was announced Wednesday.
   Real estate developer Robert E. Hall of Harrisburg, Pa., bought
the painting by former Disney artist Carl Barks from Another
Rainbow, a Disney licensee.
   The painting, featuring Scrooge, Donald and siblings Huey, Dewey
and Louie, is named ``Makings of a Fish Story'' and was painted
earlier this year.
   Barks, who lives in Oregon, wrote and drew more than 500 Duck
family comic book stories from the 1940s to the mid-1960s. His most
famous original creation was the wealthy old miser, Scrooge.
   Another Rainbow publisher Bruce Hamilton said at least eight of
Barks' oil paintings have sold for more than $70,000.
   Hall said he sold stock to raise cash for the painting because
``I think it's a better investment for me at this time. Besides,
it's a lot more fun.''
