   More and more Americans seem to be choosing to celebrate the
holiday season away from home.
   The American Automobile Association estimates that 25 million
Americans will hit the road during this Christmas holiday.
   For those who plan such a trip, there is now a second edition of
Patricia Carpenter's ``Away for the Holiday,'' a soft-cover
directory of domestic and foreign places to stay, holiday tours and
cruises, and a section on holiday traditions around the world.
   And, if you tend to associate the holidays with libations, there
is a list of toasts in foreign languages.

   Guests will be ``waltzed'' to the ball in horse-drawn carriages
that will travel down a ``snowy'' boulevard flanked by decorated

   In New York's Times Square every New Year's Eve, there is a
countdown to midnight.
   In the ``Times Square of the West'' celebration in Seattle,
there is a ``countup.''
   At 89 seconds to midnight, spotlights will follow one of the
glass elevators as it ascends the darkened 605-foot Space Needle,
Seattle's most famous landmark. When the elevator reaches the top
at midnight, 5,000 lights will envelop the dome and thousands _
actually four times 1,989 _ helium-filled balloons will be released
and illuminated by floodlights.
   This year, the Space Needle officially launches 1989 as the
centennial year for the state of Washington.
