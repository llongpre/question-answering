<TEXT>     1776 -- General George Washington crosses the Delaware on Christmas night,
expecting to surprise the Hessians with their glasses up and their guard down.
He does.;   1818 -- In the Austrian village of Arnsdorf, the bellows of the
church organ have been eaten away by mice. With the organ unplayable for
midnight Mass, only hours away, Father Joseph Mohr takes a poem he has written
and goes to schoolmaster and musician Franz Gruber. He asks Gruber to set the
poem to music suitable for guitar. The song they produce is "Silent Night.";  
1844 -- Charles Dickens gives the world Ebenezer Scrooge and "A Christmas
Carol." A New England factory owner, reading the story a few years later,
closes his plant on Christmas for the first time.;   1856 -- The Rev. John
Pierpont, a Unitarian, writes a poem and sets it to music. Since it does not
seem appropriate for church, Pierpont assumes it is destined for oblivion.
Still, it is catchy. He calls it "Jingle Bells.";   1897 -- New York Sun
prints its famous editorial, "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." And
reprints it each year until its demise in 1949.;   1899 -- Mrs. Santa Claus
debuts in "Goody Santa Claus on a Sleigh Ride," one of 32 books by Katherine
Lee Bates. No one remembers Bates' books today, but some remember that she
wrote "America the Beautiful.";   1900 -- "Dear Santa Claus: I haven't had a
Christmas tree in 4 years. And I have broken my trimmings. And I want a pair
of roller skates. And a book. I can't think of anything more." The child
writing that letter was Edsel Ford, son of auto pioneer Henry Ford.;   1906 --
"The only real blind person at Christmas time is he who has not Christmas in
his heart." Helen Keller, Ladies Home Journal.;   1913 -- Buster, heavyweight
champion turkey of Crawford County, Ohio, has a date at a Christmas dinner
table. But it is not to be. After weighing in at 80 pounds, Buster pushes for
90 when, on Dec. 19, he suffers the only fatal turkey heart attack ever to
make the newspapers.;   1915 -- British and German troops sing carols, shake
hands, then resume World War I.;   1931 -- The Coca-Cola Co. hires artist
Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa having a Coke. His paintings, produced each
year through 1968, are probably responsible for the look of Santa Claus as he
appears today.;   1939 -- Asked to write a children's Christmas booklet as a
giveaway, Montgomery Ward copywriter Robert May creates a story about a
reindeer with a bright red nose. The rest, Rudolph fans, is history. (The song
followed in 1947.);   1941 -- In deference to war blackouts, the National
Christmas Tree in Washington, D.C., has no lights.;   1942 -- Stiff upper lip
in war-torn England. Winston Churchill tells the nation, "Let the children
have their night of fun. Let the gifts of Father Christmas delight their play.
Let us grown-ups share to the full in their unstinted pleasure before we turn
again to the stern task . . ."  </TEXT>
