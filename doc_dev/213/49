   When the history of American entertainment in
the 1970s and '80s is written, a hefty chapter will be required for
``Saturday Night Live.''
   NBC's off-the-wall comedy series has produced almost as many
stars as did vaudeville in an earlier era, including: John Belushi,
Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin,
Albert Brooks, Laraine Newman, Joe Piscopo, Eddie Murphy, Brad Hall,
Jim Belushi, Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest, Rich Hall and Martin
Short.
   Murray has warm memories of his service (1977-80) with the Not
Ready for Prime Time Players:
   ``The most fun we had was when it was just us. After 6 o'clock on
Friday night, everyone would leave the building (RCA in Rockefeller
Plaza, New York). We wouldn't have hangers-on or guests or visitors.
It would just be the actors and the crew.
   ``That was fun that nobody else could have,'' he said. ``We're
the only ones who know what it was really like. From 6 o'clock to 11
o'clock, it was just work, execution and learning something. It was
one of the greatest schools anyone could ever have. Anyone who had
that job for more than six months can do anything. It was incredible
training.
   ``We all got goofy, but everybody gets goofy. We were in the
business of making funny television, hopefully. When you did it
right, that was more satisfying that getting drunk or throwing
bottles out of windows or whatever anyone says we may have done.''
   Many of the tricks Murray learned on ``Saturday Night Live'' can
be viewed in ``Scrooged,'' new from Paramount Pictures. It's an
update of ``A Christmas Carol'' with Murray as a TV network boss who
would make Scrooge seem like Mother Teresa. Most of the critics
didn't enjoy the movie, but the public did. The first weekend take
was a massive $13 million on 1,262 screens.
   Why another version of Dickens' oft-told tale?
   ``The incentive was to make a funny version of `A Christmas
Carol,' to give it a modern look and a 1980s social conscience,''
Murray said. ``Besides I wanted to work. I like to work. I'm a
better person when I work. It was better that I get a job; I was
deteriorating rapidly.''
   Of course, one never knows how seriously to take Murray's
remarks. It is true that he took a long breather after the megahit
``Ghostbusters'' and his dramatic mishap, ``The Razor's Edge.''
   What did he do on his vacation?
   ``Well, I was over in Paris for a while,'' he said. ``I studied a
little bit at the Sorbonne. I learned how to eat with a fork and
knife. They're really very good with a fork and knife over there in
France. They can eat anything with a knife and fork. They prefer to
eat yogurt with a knife and fork.
   ``They're much better than the English or the Dutch with
silverware. Every American should go to France to learn how to use
silverware. They've got something going there. I don't think even
the French know what they've got.
   ``The silverware thing is pretty much it for my vacation,'' he
quipped. ``There weren't any good scripts. They were all pretty
scary. You get lazy. Your momentum drops and you get so you can
barely leave the house.
   ``You get lazier and lazier. When I did `Scrooged,' it took me
weeks to get back into it. I wasn't really sharp at all. Usually,
just before lunch there's a big shot, and they like to get it. For
two or three weeks, I blew the take just before lunch and they said,
`That's OK, Bill, let's go eat; maybe that will help.' I wasn't
amusing anybody for a weeks.''
   Murray grew up in a funny family in Wilmette, Ill., near Chicago.
He was the middle of nine children who, according to family legend,
vied for the attention of their father, a lumber salesman with a
rare sense of humor. He continued trying to make his fellow students
laugh while attending a Jesuit school. After a brief stint at a
pre-med school in Denver, he drifted back to Chicago.
   His older brother, Brian, had joined Second City, the
improvisational comedy troupe that included John Belushi and Harold
Ramis. Murray studied at the company's workshop, then replaced
Belushi who moved on to New York. The Murray brothers and Ramis
followed soon afterward. Then came the explosion of ``Saturday Night
Live.''
   Murray's fresh, laid-back comedic style attracted movie interest,
and his first starring role was in Ivan Reitman's summer-camp
comedy, ``Meatballs.'' He bombed in ``Where the Buffalo Roam,'' a
mistaken attempt to capture gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson in a
movie. Then came another Reitman romp, ``Stripes,'' followed by
``Ghostbusters.''
   In 1989, the ``Ghostbuster'' gang returns for the long-awaited
sequel.
   ```Ghostbusters' was the most fun we ever had making a movie,''
said Murray. ``It was just funny people doing a funny movie. Even
though there was a lot of waiting because of the special effects, we
really had a lot of fun. I've known these guys (Aykroyd, Ramis,
Reitman) for a long time. We laughed a lot.''
