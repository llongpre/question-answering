Cypress College's "A Christmas Carol: Scrooge and Marley" seems designed 
primarily for a youthful audience. Director Mark Majarian has brought in a 
bagful of special effects. Bells gong loudly, shrieks and yelps echo; there are 
demons with incandescent peepers, and spirits enshrouded in stage fog. 
</P>
<P>
Along these lines, Gil Morales' set has the perspective of a children's 
nightmare: The large cut-out scenery is cartoon-like and eerie, all flinty 
grays and drained-out colors. 
</P>
<P>
Even the use of Marley as a narrator -- the major innovation in this Israel 
Horovitz adaptation of Dickens' venerable tale -- appears intended to guide 
children through the story. 
</P>
<P>
Because of these touches, this "Christmas Carol" may succeed at holding some 
young kids, but their parents and older siblings are likely to fidget. Despite 
all the gee-whiz moments, the production simply doesn't involve as well as it 
should. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few central problems. The first revolves around Majarian's decision 
to use all of the Campus Theatre's large stage. This makes some sense during 
the big crowd scenes. But the more intimate passages, when we're supposed to 
grasp Scrooge's personality, are all but lost, swallowed by the expanse. Even 
on the big stage, Majarian might have blocked the actors and sets nearer to the 
audience. As it is now, though, the action is removed several feet from the 
front row. 
</P>
<P>
Another glitch: From where I sat, a gap in the scenery, toward the side, 
allowed a distracting view of the cast preparing backstage. 
</P>
<P>
A bigger problem: Too many scenes are allowed to lag. The actors move about 
doing this and that, but they don't push the action along. A prime example is 
when Scrooge all but cleans house in the long moments before Marley's first 
midnight visitation. We grow impatient; let those Christmas ghosts get on with 
it! 
</P>
<P>
Timothy D. French's Scrooge looks too young, even with makeup and gray powder 
dusted in his hair. A Cypress College student, French does try to lend the 
character age and severity through a hobbled gait and biting manner, but it 
doesn't always work. It's an impression of Scrooge, not an embodiment. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Ernest Jackson has the tougher role as Marley. The character 
hovers between a ghostly presence out to frighten (Jackson comes up with a lot 
of those maniacal laughs) and a hopeful moralist commenting on Scrooge's 
soulful journey. It puts Jackson at a disadvantage, as he has trouble combining 
the two.
