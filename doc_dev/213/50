December is filled with the sounds of Christmas carols, bells and chimes, the 
bellowing laughs of jolly men in bright red suits. But one December night 
brings the mysterious rhythms of drums and rattles played by winter night 
spirits dressed in black and white. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara residents have gathered to celebrate the summer solstice, the 
longest day of the year, for the past 14 years. But 6 to 8 p.m. Friday marks 
only the second annual winter solstice festival, celebrating the longest night 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
And although both summer and winter solstice dates are important spiritual 
markers for many cultures, present and past, "the spirits which inspire winter 
solstice are quite different from the spirits which inspire summer solstice," 
said Michelle Bernes, coordinator of the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
So although the highlight of summer solstice is a lighthearted, colorful 
parade, winter solstice offers a mysterious, magical processional. This year's 
theme is magic of the night, and a masked sorceress and sorcerer will conjure 
magical feats, Bernes said. 
</P>
<P>
Revelers are asked to dress in black and white, as they believe a "winter night 
spirit" looks. They should also bring drums and rattles and meet at the gardens 
of the Santa Barbara Courthouse at 6 p.m. Musician Jim De Fazio will lead the 
group in a musical candlelight procession to De La Guerra Plaza, followed by 
celebratory dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Like its summer counterpart, winter solstice is a non-commercial event and 
participants' costumes cannot display any slogans, words or recognizable 
symbols. No animals or motorized vehicles are allowed. Call 964-3727.
