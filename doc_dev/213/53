EVERYONE can breath a sigh of relief this Christmas since once again there
is no major West End panto. Recent efforts have been under rehearsed,
woefully scripted vehicles for declining stars. But anyone whose perfect
family Christmas includes Boxing Day at the panto need travel no further
than Richmond, where the usually reliable Derek Griffiths is masterminding
Snow White; or Stratford East, where the laid back atmosphere should ensure
a happy (and politically correct) Aladdin; or Bromley where the Churchill
has the not so politically correct Jimmy Tarbuck as Idle Jack in Dick
Whittington.
But if panto is out of fashion there is no shortage of alternative Christmas
shows. The Shaw is mounting Pinocchio; Paul Nicholas will be tightrope
walking, juggling and trapezing his way through Barnum at the Dominion from
Monday; and the Snow Queen has settled at the Young Vic.
And one old stalwart has been re-vamped in time for Christmas. Unlike
British Rail, Starlight Express (approaching its ninth year at the Victoria
Apollo) has received a complete modernisation. This musical fantasy about a
train set that comes alive at night is, if anything, more baffling than
ever. On one track it offers the latest in hi tech wizardry, as the cast
roller-skate around the theatre like Nintendo graphics. On another it
celebrates old fashioned virtues, steam power over diesel and electric,
modest worth over flash competitiveness. There is even a mystical element
which makes it the ideal Christmas treat.
Producer Trevor Nunn has given it a thorough going over, and composer Andrew
Lloyd Webber has written five new songs. The result is a softer show.
Instead of the threatening Thatcherite Controller guiding the action we have
a little boy's dream come true. Two of the new numbers are romantic ballads,
one of which, 'Next time you fall in love', should become a cabaret
standard.
But while the mood is mellow, the all dancing, all singing, skaters seem
more energised, showing off some very fancy somersaults. The cast, held
together by Lon Satton as the aged steam loco, are still tentative about the
new story line but the special effects are faster, the music so revitalised
that it embraces Sir Andrew's first Rap number, and the audience of children
and foreign tourists remained reverentially delighted.
Since Charles Dickens virtually invented our modern, or rather our
pre-television, Christmas he would be delighted if, as the Ghost of
Christmas Past, he popped into Ron Pember's adaptation of A Christmas Carol
at the Mermaid. This manages to broaden the story slightly to provide some
cheap guffaws for the kids, and to add a sprinkling of musical numbers for
cheery ensemble choruses, while staying honourably true to the original. And
what a fine story it is, perhaps best suited for jaded Thatcherites but with
enough creepy moments and sentimental gushings to keep the whole family
happy.
Douglas Fielding is not quite nasty enough as Scrooge (there is the touch of
a Doctor Who about him) but a matinee audience of school children was
impressively gripped as the company rollocked through Vanessa Ford's
direction.
Of course there is one traditional panto in the heart of London. Whittington
Junior and his Sensational Cat could not be more traditional or more
central. The script is cobbled together from a Victorian original, all
rhyming couplets and cringe making puns, and it is performed at the Players'
Theatre under the arches at Charing Cross, the epicentre of the capital.
This annual Players' panto is a good idea which sometimes scores, sometimes
horribly misses. This year it is a good one. An attractive cast battle
through the good natured nonsense, held together by Amanda Bairstow's
chipper Dick and Nigel Williams monumental Emperor of Morocco. There is
something puritanical about the Players, despite its raison d'etre as the
home of vulgar old music hall, and the dick jokes, essential for an
enjoyable Whittington, are raced over. Ms Bairstow also lets the side down
by wearing shorts rather than long legs.
The music has been down graded to drawing room ballads: I missed the skits
on Verdi, Donizetti and Rossini which in past years have been memorably
sung. But this is still a cheerful, off beat, panto, offering un-demanding
fun.
