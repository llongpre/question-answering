   Thieves broke into a church's storage
room, picked through almost 2,000 toys that were donated for the
poor and made off with the best of them, authorities said.
   ``What they took was the new stuffed animals, the doll babies,
the trucks,'' said Barbara Zahner, executive director of Sacred
Heart Church's Community Services. ``They left us the used toys.''
   The toy giveaway Monday is aimed at helping boost the morale of
poor parents. The 1,000 parents who registered for it can browse
through the storage room to make their selections, and receive
wrapping paper and ribbons to decorate the packages.
   ``The idea is they can come and shop with dignity,'' Zahner said
Friday. ``There's no money exchanged, but they can choose.''
   The storage room is in a building used by at least seven social
service agencies. Zahner said two men were seen walking down the
hall with full plastic garbage bags Thursday night, but no one paid
much attention to them.
   There were no signs of forced entry, so Zahner said she suspects
the thieves may have had a key to the building.
   The giveaway is still set for Monday.
   ``We'll just count on the goodness of people who realize that
this is the season of the child,'' Zahner said.

   A man working as a shopping mall
Santa Claus was arrested on charges that he fondled teen-age girls
while they were having their pictures taken with him.
   Police said Donald Strong, 44, of Crawfordsville was charged
Thursday with sexual battery after he allegedly fondled the young
women, aged 15, 16, 17 and 18, at Boulevard Mall.
   Mall manager Kevin B. Garleb said Strong has previous convictions
on burlgary and theft charges. He would not comment on the sexual
battery charges, but defended his hiring of Strong.
   ``Past charges of burglary do not mean that you would be a
possible threat for a sexual crime,'' Garleb said.
   Detective Lt. Rick D. Wilson said Strong was arrested while he
was off duty.
   The young women did not report the alleged fondlings, but a
policeman overheard other shoppers talking about the allegations.
   ``I think there were several reasons why they did not report the
incidents immediately. Like victims of other sexual crimes, they
were afraid of the embarrassment and publicity,'' Wilson said.

   Only the most ruthless of robbers would steal the
Grinch who stole Christmas.
   But steal him they did _ until their consciences caught up with
them.
   A pair of Northeastern University students who identified
themselves only as Ebenezer Scrooge and Kriss Kringle on Saturday
returned the 6-foot green Grinch they had pinched two days earlier
from Boston's downtown Quality Inn.
   ``Initially we were going to hold the Grinch for a large
ransom,'' the pair said in a note they left along with the
well-loved hater of Christmas. ``But ... we decided to return the
Grinch hoping the Quality Inn would donate $100 to the charity of
your choice in the names of myself and my partner and the Grinch.''
   Hotel spokeswoman Doris Pike said all was forgiven and that plans
were in the works to donate the money to Camp Joy, a recreational
therapy group for children with special needs.
   ``We threw a party today for about 65 kids from the group,'' Ms.
Pike said. ``They missed out on the Grinch, so they get the money.''
   According to the children's storybook by Dr. Seuss, ``The Grinch
That Stole Christmas,'' the dour green character makes off with a
town's Christmas decorations and presents after becoming enraged by
the sounds of Christmas cheer. But the Grinch relents and returns
the booty to Whoville.

   While members of a theater troupe were
staging ``A Christmas Carol'' at a Bismarck playhouse, a real-life
Scrooge was backstage stealing their money, police said.
   Five members of Dakota Stage Ltd. lost more than $500 in cash to
the thief, police said Saturday.
   The bandit got into the backstage dressing room area while the
play was going on Thursday night, a police report said. The area was
unlocked.
