<P>
The Air Force base is closing here, and jobs are growing scarce. Property 
prices have fallen; banks are uneasy. A tank of gas for the car now costs what 
a good blouse or sweater used to. It's getting very cold, and heating the 
house, to the horror of people in this seaside community, has become a luxury. 
</P>
<P>
Could this be the time for "A Carol of Christmas"? 
</P>
<P>
"Humbug!" shouted Abner Stone, the updated answer to Dickens' Scrooge. "Utter 
nonsense!" 
</P>
<P>
Stone, portrayed by an actor named William Morris, enunciated each syllable 
with fiendish precision. His expression screamed scoundrel. His gestures 
shouted villain. 
</P>
<P>
Leaning against the piano, lyricist Bruce Belland crowed "Perfect! I love it!" 
Composer Roy M. Rogosin offered a satisfied grin. Joel Rogosin, who wrote the 
book for "A Carol of Christmas," nodded approvingly. 
</P>
<P>
It was right, Belland and the Rogosins were saying. With beards and gentle 
middle-aged paunches that made them look like shopping-mall Santas on their day 
off, the three displaced Angelenos had captured the bitter crux of Christmas 
1990, when hard economic times are threatening generosity of spirit. They had 
catapulted Dickens into a new century and set their tale to music while they 
were at it. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to take the familiar legend and place it in a town like 
Portsmouth," which has been so negatively affected by the economy, Roy Rogosin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I understand that it's not just here." Times are tough in so many places, 
said Rogosin, "and I thought we could create a Christmas show which had the 
values of the familiar 'Christmas Carol' " in a contemporary setting. 
</P>
<P>
There is a character named Tim, Roy Rogosin explained. "He doesn't have a 
crutch, but he observes his parents' marriage falling apart." Abner Stone, the 
factory owner, is threatening to shut down the town's major employer, a marine 
propeller plant. For 20th-Century authenticity, there is an extraterrestrial 
named Barnaby. 
</P>
<P>
Roy M. Rogosin, 49, is a veteran musical director. For many years he worked 
with Johnny Mathis, and for four years he worked in Paris with Michel Legrand. 
He spent 20 years conducting and writing music for Broadway as well as for 
movies and television. His wife and business partner, Eileen, is an 
ex-Mouseketeer. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Rogosin went to Portsmouth to direct "The Music Man" at the town's 
Music Hall. When he went home to L.A., things neither looked nor felt the same. 
A year later, the Rogosins packed up their two kids, sold the home they had 
owned for 20 years and resettled in Portsmouth. 
</P>
<P>
"We had friends in L.A. who said, 'New Hampshire, that's near New York, right?' 
" Rogosin said. "They'd say things like: 'How far are you from the grocery 
store?' 'Are there schools there?' " 
</P>
<P>
Roy and Eileen Rogosin founded PAPA, the Portsmouth Academy of Performing Arts. 
When theater space in a 19th-Century brewery became available two years ago, 
the Rogosins became the proprietors of the Bow Street Theater here. Their 
performing group is known as the Seacoast Repertory Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back in Los Angeles, Bruce Belland had been making "obscene" amounts 
of money producing game shows. He worked for Ralph Edwards, and said he was 
widely viewed as a successor to Edwards when the older man retired. But 
Belland, the lead singer for the Four Preps, a middle-of-the-road 1960s pop 
group, was never quite happy. "I missed the music," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Now 54, Belland was a star in the choir at Hollywood High. He was also a 
lyricist, turning out such Four Preps hits as "26 Miles (Across the Sea)," "I 
Was a Big Man Yesterday" and "Down by the Station." The group disbanded in 
1969, and, for a time, Belland became a regular actor on "The Adventures of 
Ozzie and Harriet." 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, Belland was producing five shows for TV. He was also writing lyrics 
for Willie Nelson and writing songs that became hits in Europe. One Belland 
composition, "What Would I Do Without My Music?," seemed to have a prophetic 
title. 
</P>
<P>
That year, Roy Rogosin called Belland with a proposal for a musical. The two 
had become friends some years earlier when both toured with Johnny Mathis. Now 
Rogosin was telling about a book he had read, "Minding the Store," about the 
founding family of the Neiman Marcus stores. 
</P>
<P>
To the consternation of his Hollywood colleagues, "I just walked away from my 
TV job," Belland said. "I realize it was foolish and unrealistic, but I don't 
regret it." 
</P>
<P>
While struggling with "Minding the Store," Belland and Rogosin wrote another 
musical, "Quick Change." It opened and closed on Broadway in four days. 
</P>
<P>
Rogosin and Belland kept their friendship, but went their separate professional 
ways. In 1988, with encouragement from Dick Clark, the new Four Preps were 
launched as "Three Golden Groups in One" -- two Preps (Belland and Ed Cobb; a 
Diamond (David Somerville) and a Letterman (Jim Pike). 
</P>
<P>
The group rehearsed for 11 months before setting out on a major concert tour. 
Belland, for one, was pleased with the product. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no humble way for me to say it," he said. "It's the best vocal group 
God put together." 
</P>
<P>
Belland said he has been having "an absolute ball" with the reorganized Four 
Preps. He paused for only a moment last spring when his friend Roy Rogosin 
called and asked if he would write the lyrics for an original Christmas 
musical. 
</P>
<P>
His brother Joel, 58, a television producer in L.A., had written "an 
extraordinary" play, Rogosin told Belland. They wanted something fresh. "I 
didn't want to do Kentucky Fried Christmas," Roy Rogosin said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the lyrics -- such as the words to the haunting song "Folks Around 
Here" -- were written while the Four Preps were on tour. Appearing at the Trump 
Castle in Atlantic City, Belland would rush up to his room after the show, 
change into sweats, then write until the wee hours. His faxes would come to the 
Rogosins at 4 and 5 a.m. in Portsmouth. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to imagine trying to write Currier &amp; Ives lyrics in a place like 
Atlantic City," Belland said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rogosin brothers and Belland have found it "refreshing" to work together, 
Joel Rogosin said. 
</P>
<P>
"In L.A., they have all these committees. Here, we're the committee, the three 
of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A Carol of Christmas" runs at the Bow Street Theater in Portsmouth through 
Dec. 23. This spring, the three will reunite when the Seacoast Rep offers the 
show they still believe in -- even if Broadway didn't -- "Minding the Store."
