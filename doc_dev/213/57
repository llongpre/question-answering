   ``Twins,'' the comedy starring Danny DeVito and
Arnold Schwarzenegger as brothers separated at birth, took first
place in national box office receipts for the third consecutive
weekend.
   ``Twins'' pulled in $9 million during the long Christmas weekend,
followed by ``Rain Man,'' a somber study of autism starring Dustin
Hoffman and Tom Cruise, which grossed $8.7 million.
   In third place was the comedy ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of
Police Squad!'' featuring Leslie Nielsen as a bumbling police
detective, which collected $5.8 million. Next was ``Working Girl,''
the corporate Cinderella comedy with Melanie Griffith and Harrison
Ford, with ticket sales of $4.7 million in a limited release.
   ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' the Steve Martin-Michael Caine
remake of 1964's con-man comedy ``Bedtime Story,'' finished fifth
with $4.5 million. ``Scrooged,'' comedian Bill Murray's
interpretation of Dickens' Christmas classic, finished in sixth with
$4.2 million. Next was ``Oliver and Co.,'' an animated update of the
Oliver Twist story, which drew $3.5 million.
   ``Hellbound: Hellraiser II,'' a horror movie from writer Clive
Barker, netted $3.19 million for eighth place. ``Tequila Sunrise,''
a moody drug-dealing drama with Mel Gibson, Kurt Russell and
Michelle Pfeiffer, collected $3.16 million for ninth. And ``The Land
Before Time,'' an animated tale of a baby dinosaur's perilous
journey through a prehistoric world, grossed $2 million and finished
10th.
