South Coast Repertory has transformed the time-encrusted mythology of "A 
Christmas Carol" into a sprightly, well-turned comedy with an Ebenezer Scrooge 
who doesn't have a mean bone in his body. 
</P>
<P>
Scrooge is a penny-pinching grumbler, of course. And virtually everybody on 
stage either says he's a meanie or treats him like one. But we don't believe it 
for a minute. We're not meant to. Not in this version of Charles Dickens' 
Christmas tale. 
</P>
<P>
For no matter how bony Scrooge's face, how chilly his words, how miserly his 
deeds, Scrooge is a comic. This news should come as no surprise to regular 
SCR-goers. Hal Landon Jr. has played him this way every year since 1980, and 
John-David Keller has directed the show for as many silly laughs as it can get. 
</P>
<P>
The result happens to be highly entertaining, especially for a family audience. 
But it is not Dickens. It misses both the pathos of the story and the emotional 
impact. Furthermore, while Jerry Patch's adaptation manages to convey the basic 
message that kindness and charity are to be valued, the moral of the story is 
dangerously oversimplified. 
</P>
<P>
Every kid in the audience, and probably some parents, well may be persuaded 
that the inverse of the moral is true: By play's end, Scrooge discovers that 
money is the root of all good, as long as he gives it away. Money buys love. 
Money buys happiness. Money, more than generosity, remains his form of 
salvation. 
</P>
<P>
However, there can be no faulting the production for its liveliness, freshness 
and technical polish. It moves swiftly, yet without sacrificing too much 
detail. The acting is crisp and particular. Party scenes are radiant, with 
minor roles filled out beautifully. The music is warm, the costumes authentic. 
And the special effects, while vivid, are not overplayed. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, this "Christmas Carol" has the great virtue of not being boring, 
which cannot be said for many cultural rites of passage. It certainly works as 
a first taste of theater and may even whet a child's appetite for the real 
Dickens. 
</P>
<P>
Landon's star turn as Scrooge seems at all times a cross between slapstick and 
caricature, regardless of whether he's playing nasty (in his black suit and 
stovepipe hat) or playing scared (in his red nightcap and white sleeping gown). 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, his performance has been designed for kids. It prizes all sorts of 
amusing goofiness, including baby talk and an acrobatic hat trick. One thing it 
does not include is anything remotely British -- in keeping with most of the 
other performances -- though not for lack of trying. (Landon affects a peculiar 
accent that sounds vaguely Southern.) 
</P>
<P>
Back from previous years in fine form are Ron Michaelson as the Spirit of 
Christmas Present, Art Koustik and Martha McFarland as Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig 
(both doubling in minor roles), Don Took as Marley (also doubling), John 
Ellington as Bob Cratchit and Howard Shangraw as Scrooge's nephew. 
</P>
<P>
Two admirable newcomers to the production, Jarion Monroe and Devon Raymond, are 
outstanding additions. Monroe, who replaces Richard Doyle as the Spirit of 
Christmas Past, brings a precise elegance to the role (as deft in its way as 
the smarmy flair he lent to "A Chorus of Disapproval" earlier this season). And 
Raymond, as Belle, not only fits her character's name but has a quiet, 
authoritative presence that is very appealing, and talent to match.
