   Holiday moviegoers are favoring comedy over
drama, as the lighthearted ``Twins'' topped the new drama ``Rain
Man,'' according to weekend box-office figures.
   For the second week in a row, ``Twins'' was the nation's most
popular movie, and two comedies, ``The Naked Gun'' and ``Scrooged,''
finished ahead of the serious ``Tequila Sunrise.''
   According to figures issued Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.,
No. 1 ``Twins,'' focusing on non-identical brothers (Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito) separated at birth, grossed $7.8
million.
   In second place was ``Rain Man,'' the new drama about an autistic
savant (Dustin Hoffman) on the road with his conniving brother (Tom
Cruise). ``Rain Man'' collected $7 million.
   Two other comedies continued strongly, as ``The Naked Gun: From
the Files of Police Squad!'' and ``Scrooged'' finished in third and
fourth place, respectively. ``The Naked Gun'' a spoof of police
movies starring Leslie Nielsen, sold $5.6 million worth of tickets,
while ``Scrooged,'' Bill Murray's comic interpretation of the
Dickens classic, gathered $4.6 million.
   In fifth place was the new comedy ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,''
starring Steve Martin and Michael Caine as dueling con men, opened
weakly with receipts of $3.8 million. It was followed by ``Tequila
Sunrise,'' a drama featuring Mel Gibson as a reformed drug dealer,
which drew $3 million.
   The holiday season's two animated films _ ``Oliver and Co.'' and
``The Land Before Time'' _ finished in seventh and eighth place.
``Oliver and Co.,'' an Oliver Twist-inspired story about a homeless
kitten, grossed $2.3 million. ``The Land Before Time,'' a tale of
baby dinosaurs negotiating a perilous prehistoric world, collected
$1.5 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were the failed ``My Stepmother is an
Alien,'' with Kim Basinger as an extraterrestrial beauty, and
``Ernest Saves Christmas,'' with Jim Varney. ``My Stepmother,''
dropping to ninth place from seventh a week ago, grossed just $1.1
million in its second week of release, while ``Ernest,'' at No. 10,
took in $950,000.
   The holiday film season grows even more frantic this week, as
studios release their ``prestige'' titles to qualify for the Academy
Awards.
   Movies opening this week, some only in selected cities, include
``Beaches,'' ``Working Girl,'' ``Talk Radio,'' ``The Accidental
Tourist,'' ``Hellbound: Hellraiser II,'' ``Burning Secret,''
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown,'' ``The Boost'' and ``Pelle the Conqueror.''
