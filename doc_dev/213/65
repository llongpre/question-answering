Christmas always seems to me to be all the holidays and most of the prominent 
emotions rolled into one. By now it is both religious and secular, by tradition 
and observance respectively, a duality that puts the secularist ACLU in 
contention with both Christians and Jews, although I see that the creche has 
just won a round in Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
The day has all the end-of-year finality of New Year's Eve, all the 
thankfulness of Thanksgiving, including the gathering-in of the family, much of 
the sense of renewal of Easter. And, as on Labor Day, you are mindful of those 
who have to work when so many people don't. 
</P>
<P>
Emotionally, Christmas is what you might call intermittent, with sunshine and 
rain showers contending. December 25 measures the passage of time like no other 
day this side of your birthday. "I was just writing Christmas cards yesterday," 
said the forlorn note on one card, meaning that yesterday was a year ago. At a 
certain point the Dec. 25's go by ever faster, like telephone poles watched 
from an accelerating train. 
</P>
<P>
The joys of the day, even if they are abundant, are always undercut by 
melancholy -- for the friends the dying year has taken with it, for goals not 
achieved, by the thought of the growing millions for whom the joys are not 
abundant, only the pains. Even when they survive, the joys have a hard fight 
with a growing cynicism that attends the getting and spending and general 
exploitation of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's because Christmas is so various a collage, contrastingly light and 
dark, and so personal an experience, that the movies, when you think about it, 
have done so relatively little with it. The exhaustive Leslie Halliwell lists 
fewer than a dozen films with Christmas in the title, plus three "Scrooges" 
further back. Memory rather than lists discloses the 1942 "Holiday Inn," in 
which Bing Crosby introduced "White Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
This year's most memorable use of the Christmas season is undoubtedly in John 
Hughes' "Home Alone," in which the extraordinary Macaulay Culkin is left behind 
at Christmastime, to contend not only with accidental abandonment but with a 
couple of dimwit but malevolent burglars. The Christmas timing is symbolically 
perfect, the film having been a rich gift for the distributor and a present for 
audiences who have made it one of the top hits of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Turning the dial a few nights ago, I lit on one of the classic, recurring 
Christmas films, the 1951 Alastair Sim "Scrooge" done in glorious 
black-and-white. What I saw was a colorized version that seemed to leave the 
characters vaguely greenish, suggesting the way your skin looks when you stand 
under a mercury-vapor street light. But, in black-and-white or a kind of 
diseased sepia, the Dickens tale of sentimental redemption from greed and 
indifference is sure-fire stuff. Christmas is still the most indefatigably 
sentimental of holidays, and cynicism hasn't won a round yet. 
</P>
<P>
The classic American Christmas film is, of course, the Frank Capra-James 
Stewart "It's a Wonderful Life," which appears to run on television even more 
often than Cal Worthington commercials, both in black-and-white, as it should, 
and in pallid color, as it shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
When Frank Capra pitched the plot to Stewart just after the end of World War 
II, Stewart listened to Capra's rather stumbling synopsis (it's not easy to 
summarize, at that) and said, approximately, "Frank, if you want me to play a 
guy whose life is saved because his angel hasn't earned his wings yet, I'm your 
man." 
</P>
<P>
It was a way of saying, "I trust you." And never was an actor's trust better 
placed. The script, by Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett and Capra himself, is 
the most sentimental of movies and, thanks to Stewart himself, still one of the 
most appealing in its dramatic insistence on the ultimate triumph of good over 
evil, hope over despair and love (of wife, family, town, country, world) 
conquering all. 
</P>
<P>
By rights, in its all-pervading goodness I suppose the film should make our 
teeth ache. But for most of us it doesn't, especially as it grows year by year 
more encrusted with our associations, and our recollections of seeing it in 
other years and different settings. It is still Stewart's favorite among his 
films. 
</P>
<P>
It is an irony that only a few years later Capra decided that the audience, 
presumably hipper, more cynical and sophisticated than before, had had enough 
of his populist optimism, his repeated vision of the ordinary man 
(extraordinary in the clutch) winning against the odds. Capra quit making 
films. Now "Capraesque" has become a selling point for movies that Capra 
himself might or might not have chosen to make, but say that the world can 
still provide happy endings for the Joes and Janes who have struggled for them. 
</P>
<P>
As against only a year ago, this Christmas is heavily shadowed by fears of war 
and the realities of recession. The plight of the homeless is beyond the gift 
of Stewart's guardian angel, Henry Travers, to solve. 
</P>
<P>
A cynic once remarked that an optimist is anyone who thinks the future is 
uncertain. But it is only necessary to hark back to the darkest Christmases of 
one's own life -- observed amid deaths in the family, disastrous financial 
circumstances and the prospect or the fact of other wars -- to realize that one 
of the gifts of Christmas is hope, distant and uncertain as it may seem. 
</P>
<P>
I can do no more than wish us all that gift of hope.
