"Yuletide" is Christmas in the Park, an exhibit of more than 70 animated
displays of Christmas and childhood fairyland stories. The display was first
shown in 1950 in front of Don Lima's business on Willow Street in San Jose. It
attracted so many drive-by viewers that cars would be backed up for blocks,
causing traffic jams; so Lima donated the exhibit to the city of San Jose in
1970.;   Today, it is presented with 150 decorated Christmas trees, Santa's
Castle, a refreshment booth and a souvenir booth. All are staged for the
season in City Plaza Park, Market and San Carlos streets, downtown San Jose.

Santa are $4. The annual holiday parade in honor of the season will be held at
