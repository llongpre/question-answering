What could be more appropriate for the holiday season than a collection of 
ghost stories? Especially when the ghosts involved are amusing rather than 
frightening, far distant cousins, if related at all, to the ogres that 
terrified us in our youth. In one sense they are descendants of the ghost of 
Marley; for they are all Christmas ghosts, but ghosts of a far more engaging 
Christmas Present than anything seen by Scrooge. And Robertson Davies, modern 
master of magic and creator of this baker's dozen of stories, acknowledges this 
debt in an engrossing tale, "Dickens Digested." 
</P>
<P>
Davies himself reads the introduction to this collection with stylish zest, 
explaining how, when he had been appointed to the first Master of Massey 
College at the University of Toronto, it became established that at the annual 
Christmas party he should tell a ghost story. Few institutions of higher 
learning can enjoy a happier tradition. But one does not, fortunately, need to 
have been exposed to graduate study to enjoy what Davies calls these 
"party-ghosts, emanating from high spirits." On the other hand, if one has 
experienced that dubious privilege, some of these ghosts may seem at times far 
more real than supernatural, and the hearer may go beyond empathizing with the 
central figure of the first story, "The Ghost Who Vanished by Degrees," and 
experience complete identification. 
</P>
<P>
The stories themselves are read with obvious enjoyment by Christopher Plummer, 
who gives just the right tone to each of the characters, whether in the flesh 
or ectoplasm. This is high praise, for the range of Davies' interests is 
enormous, and he makes full use of them here. Among his favorite targets are 
provincialism, manners, dress, and self-pride. He can be both benign and 
biting, sometimes in the same breath. Who else could dream up an encounter 
between the ghosts of Albert Einstein and Little Lord Fauntleroy? 
</P>
<P>
That meeting occurs in "Einstein and the Little Lord," and I give the title 
simply to indicate one of the difficulties of reviewing a collection of ghost 
stories. A recounting of the story itself is out of the question. It could be 
nothing but a condensed, pale imitation of the original, spoiling the real 
thing for the listener. A listing of some of the titles to be heard here may be 
the best solution, especially those titles that give an indication -- even if a 
misleading one -- of the delights to follow. So, in addition to those already 
named, the listener can look forward to "The Great Queen is Amused," "The Night 
of the Three Kings," "When Satan Goes Home for Christmas," and "The Ugly 
Spectre of Sexism." Finally, there is "Offer of Immortality." What more could 
one ask for? 
</P>
<P>
With his interests in Jungian theory and magic, Davies, not surprisingly, has 
himself become a figure of legend and myth. This is a mark of his peculiar 
genius, something that anyone who has heard him speak or even simply looked at 
his current portraits can understand. One of the most enchanting details 
concerning him has been told to me solemnly by more than one admirer, and that 
is that his splendidly full beard is the result of his face having never been 
touched by a razor. 
</P>
<P>
If Davies himself had invented this fiction I would keep my silence. But 
knowing that he has not, I feel free to explode that particular myth. Davies 
and I were contemporaries at Oxford in pre-war days. More than that, we were 
both members of an exclusive club, its membership limited for life to four 
persons. We were all clean shaven when this club was founded, though two of the 
members began to sport mustaches before we went down. Davies was not one of 
these. I have heard Davies' appearance compared to that of Michelangelo's Moses 
and to Freud's. But surely his model in this current role is a seasonal figure. 
Clearly he is the latter-day manifestation of Saint Nicholas.

The name of our club, by the way: The Long Christmas Dinner Society.
