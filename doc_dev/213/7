   When Charles Dickens wrote ``A Christmas Carol''
in 1843, he had no way of knowing that his simple truths would
provide creative fodder for filmmakers, animators, lyricists and
playwrights for generations to come.
   Many holiday-themed movies take their cue from Dickens'
wonderful story of Ebenezer Scrooge and his change of heart.
   Here is an alphabetical list of some, but certainly not all, of
some holiday-spiced videos for the Thanksgiving-Christmas-New Year
season. Many are versions of ``A Christmas Carol'':

<TEXT>
   - ``Alice's Restaurant'' (1969): It's the Thanksgiving Dinner
that couldn't be beat, and the generation that just said ``no'' to
the draft. From Arlo Guthrie's song.
   - ``Auntie Mame'' (1958): Christmas despair leads to Christmas
joy and a new marriage for Auntie Mame in this delightful romp.
   - ``Babes in Toyland'' (1961): A terrible Disney version (if
there is such a thing) of the Victor Herbert operetta, starring
Annette Funicello, Tommy Sands and Ray Bolger.
   - ``The Bear Who Slept Through Christmas'' (1983): Animated
story about a bear who skips hibernation to find out what Christmas
is all about. Not bad, but certainly not great.
   - ``Caspar's First Christmas'' (1987): Any parent who inflicts
this dud on a kid should be arrested for child abuse. Horrible
animation and terrible Caspar voice (it's not the one in the
original Caspar the Friendly Ghost cartoons) help make it
unbearable.
   - ``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' (1965): If you ever wondered
what CHristmas was all about, wonder no more. A magical treat from
the Peanuts characters.
   - ``A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving'' (1973): Linus explains the
true meaning of Thanksgiving. Another Peanuts gem.
   - ``A Child's Christmas in Wales'' (1987): Dylan Thomas'
wonderful story, somewhat lamely done.
   - ``A Christmas CArol'' (1938): A compassionate look at Scrooge,
starring Reginald Owen and GEne Lockhart.
   - ``A Christmas Carol'' (1951): The better version, with often
scary sequences. Stars Alastair Sim as a more broken and evil
Scrooge, whose transformation is all the more poignant.
   - ``Christmas in Connecticut'' (1945): A phony family for an
advice columnist. FAst-paced fun, starring Barbara Stanwyck and
Sydney Greenstreet.
   - ``Christmas Lilies of the Field'' (1984): Sequel to Academy
Award-winning movie that starred Sidney Poitier. This one is rather
Lame, but has its heart in the right place. Stars Billy Dee
Williams.
   - ``A Christmas Story'' (1983): Jean Shepard's marvelous memory
of Christmas in the 1940s and the ultimate gift, a regulation Red
Ryder air rifle.
   - ``A Disney Christmas Gift'' (1982): A real treat. The best of
Disney, with special holiday shorts.
   - ``Dr. Seuss: Horton Hears a Who''; ``The Grinch Who Stole
Christmas'' (1974): Made-for-television animated shorts from the
cartoon master himself, Chuck JOnes.
   - ``A Dream for Christmas'' (1973): A minister moves to
California to start a new church. A slice of American pie, but not
as tasty. Stars Hari Rhodes and BEah Richards.
   - ``Ernest Saves Christmas'' (1988): Ernest P. Worrell, that
down-home obnoxious TV pitchman, helps Santa. You have to be a true
Ernest fan for this one.
   - ``Happy New Year, Charlie Brown'' (1985): That old gang again.
And great as always.
   - ``Holiday Inn'' (1942): With music by Irving Berlin, and
memorable performances by Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby, who could
go wrong?
   - ``It's a Wonderful Life'' (1946): Frank Capra's black and
white marvel, starring JAmes Stewart as the man who made the wrong
wish and was saved from it.
   - ``March of the Wooden Soldiers'' (1934): Wonderful fantasy
feature starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, who save the land of
Old King Cole from the horrible boogeymen.
   - ``Meet Me in St. Louis'' (1944): Family entertainment from
Judy Garland, Margaret O'Brien and Tom Drake.
   - ``Mickey's Christmas Carol'' (1984): That resourceful little
rodent plays Bob CRatchit in this spin of the Dickens' classic.
   - ``Miracle on 34th Street'' (1947): Do you believe in Santa
Claus? A delightful tale, starring NAtalie Wood.
   - ``Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol'' (1962): The near-sighted one
plays Scrooge.
   - ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (and Other Wonderful
Christmas Stories)'' (1944): Four animated featurettes. All black
and white, and all classics.
   - ``Santa Claus - The Movie'' (1985): Dudley Moore plays an elf
in this enjoyable film. How fitting.
   - ``Night and Day'' (1946): CAry Grant portrays Cole Porter.
   - ``The Old Curiosity Shop'' (1975): A British-made version of
``Scrooge,'' the musical adaptation of ``A Christmas Carol.'' This
one is pretty good. Stars Anthony Newly and David Hemmings.
   - ``Scrooge'' (1970): Musical of Dickens tale. Stars Albert
Finney and Alec Guiness.
   - ``Scrooged'' (1988): One of the more disastrous versions of
the Dickens story. Saved by CArol Kane as the ghost of Christmas
Present. Stars Bill Murray doing his usual.
hilarious, as is the entire movie. Co-stars Eddie Murphy, Ralph
Bellamy, Don AMeche and Jamie Lee Curtis.
   - ``A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'' (1945): A sentimental portrait of
a working class family - in Brooklyn.
   - ``White Christmas'' (1954): AN inferior redo of ``Holiday
Inn,'' but it makes good use of the title song. Stars Bing Crosby
again.
