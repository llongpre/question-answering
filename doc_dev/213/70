   A homebuilder has donated $31,000 to keep
this city's Christmas display lit after the city council pulled the
plug and found itself being called Scrooge.
   Bill Milburn, owner of Austin's largest homebuilding company,
said he wrote the check because he and his family have always
enjoyed the brilliant Zilker Park Trail of Lights.
   Mayor Lee Cooke wrote a memo Friday to his ``fellow Scrooges''
telling the council about the contribution. ``This might be the way
to fund a lot of city projects,'' Cooke said.
   Council members cut funds to the annual holiday attraction in
order to pay for a tree-planting position. They were then inundated
with calls in support of the display.
   Council member Bob Larson said he was tired of being called
Scrooge everywhere he went and wanted his colleagues to reconsider
their action.
   Michael Corroccio, who helped design the exhibit 10 years ago,
praised Milburn for the donation. ``It really ensures the future of
the trail. Now we can go full steam ahead,'' he said.
   The ``Trail of Lights,'' featuring displays of various Christmas
themes, attracts thousands of viewers each year.
