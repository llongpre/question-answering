IN RECENT years the Yuletide film release pattern in Britain seems to have
been designed by E. Scrooge. Little for kiddies and not much more for
grown-ups: unless they like oddly-timed horror films like last Christmas's
The People Under The Stairs.
That was all about children being starved and imprisoned under the
floorboards: very seasonal. But this year Home Alone 2 comes to town, an
altogether more children-friendly proposition as young Macauley Culkin
mislays his parents yet again, this time in New York, and fends off the same
pair of wacky burglars (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern).
Sir Richard Attenborough's Chaplin promises us another of his portraits of
small but messianic heroes of the 20th century, to match the director's
earlier Gandhi. America's Robert Downey Jr plays our Charlie with rumoured
panache and a guaranteed British accent. And before Christmas children of
all ages will be able to see The Muppet Christmas Carol, in which Kermit and
Miss Piggy, too long absent from our screens, give Dickens a seasonal
going-over.
For grown-ups there are Kevin Costner's new film The Bodyguard and Tom
Cruise and Jack Nicholson offering power-casting in the ex-Broadway
courtroom drama A Few Good Men. The first I still await; the second woos the
box office with a cunning blend of boy-scout heroics - Cruise as a young
Navy lawyer defending two murder-accused Marines - and pyrotechnic acting
from Nicholson.
None of the other major US Christmas releases, like Coppola's Dracula and
Disney's Aladdin, are set to open in the UK before the New Year. But never
mind. There are still autumn holdovers worth catching. If you were too busy
in recent months watching the real-life dramas all around us, you may now
make up for lost time.
Most festive of all is Beauty And The Beast, Disney's 30th animated feature
and as visually dazzling as any since the first (Snow White). And some
children might enjoy the tinselled absurdism of Strictly Ballroom, a
fleet-footed Australian comedy which my predecessor on this paper, David
Robinson, included in his recent all-time Ten Best Films list for Sight And
Sound.
That is going it a bit. But Orson Welles's Othello, Woody Allen's Husbands
And Wives and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, all still viewable, would be
worthy company in any pantheon. Welles turns the moor's tragedy into a
Shakespearean Ivan The Terrible: white-hot compositions and bold, hieratic
performances. Allen's film is a bitter-hilarious picture of self-destruct
relationships. You have to go back to Annie Hall and Manhattan for an Allen
in livelier form. And Unforgiven, a haunting tale of rough justice in the
Old West (where Eastwood himself looks as old and monumental as the
landscapes), is the best Western of recent times.
Less demanding picture-hunters may settle for one of the gimmick-strewn
entertainment machines trundling across the Atlantic. Sneakers, starring
Robert Redford, is a merry tale of computer hackers hacking into the
political big time. And Death Becomes Her has Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn
being picturesquely attacked by special effects and resembling Henry Moore
sculptures.
As for British film-makers, two have work now on display, though only one of
their films is British. Kenneth Branagh's Peter's Friends trips the bright
fantastic through a Chekhovian script with a cast of young TV comics
(Stephen Fry, Tony Slattery, Hugh Laurie) learning to play straight. And
Ridley Scott's Blade Runner: The Director's Cut shows that you do not have
to be an American to create the definitive vision of urban America in the
next millennium. See, marvel and come out humming the sets.
