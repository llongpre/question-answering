   Two contrasting chronicles of brotherly
relations _ the drama ``Rain Man'' and the comedy ``Twins'' _
commanded 1988's frantic final weekend at the movies, according to
box office figures from Exhibitor Relations Co.
   The No. 1 film, ``Rain Man,'' starring Dustin Hoffman as an
autistic savant on the road with his scheming brother, played by Tom
Cruise, sold $14.4 million worth of tickets.
   ``Twins,'' featuring Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger as
unlikely siblings separated at birth, finished second with sales of
$12.1 million, according to figures released Tuesday.
   With these two films passing the $10 million mark, business
during the four-day New Year's weekend was up sharply from a year
ago. The Top 10 movies this New Year's weekend gathered
approximately $69.8 million, up 24 percent from 1987's Top 10
grosses of $56.1 million.
   The Christmas weekend, however, reflected a 15 percent decline
from a year ago.
   Last year's winter hits were ``Three Men and a Baby,'' ``Throw
Momma from the Train,'' ``Eddie Murphy Raw'' and ``Broadcast News.''
   ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,'' a satirical
look at sleuthing with Leslie Nielsen, came in third over the
weekend on receipts of $7.9 million. It was followed by the animated
``Oliver and Co.,'' the Oliver Twist-inspired tale of a homeless
kitten, with grosses of $7.4 million.
   Two sophisticated comedies, ``Working Girl'' and ``Dirty Rotten
Scoundrels,'' finished in fifth and sixth place, respectively.
   ``Working Girl,'' the Cinderella corporate story featuring
Melanie Griffith as an ambitious secretary, collected $7.3 million.
``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' with Steve Martin and Michael Caine as
dueling con men, claimed box office revenues of $6.5 million.
   ``Tequila Sunrise,'' starring Mel Gibson as a drug dealer trying
to start over in life with restaurant owner Michelle Pfeiffer, was
seventh with receipts of $4.6 million.
   In eighth place was the animated ``The Land Before Time,'' about
a baby dinosaur's travels in a prehistoric world, on sales of $3.7
million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Scrooged,'' Bill Murray's
reworking of the Charles Dickens Christmas classic, with revenues of
$3.3 million, and the horror film ``Hellbound: Hellraiser II,'' with
sales of $2.6 million.
   Of the new holiday films in limited release, the two most
successful were ``The Accidental Tourist,'' with a per-screen
average of $44,033 in five theaters nationwide, and ``Beaches,''
with a per-screen average of $38,435 in seven movie houses.
