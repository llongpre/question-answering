WHAT IS the most potent idea in all drama? Murder? Love? Jealousy? Ambition?
Revenge? No: being lost. It is what happens to the protagonists in The
Odyssey, King Lear and Gulliver's Travels. It is what happens to the
villains in The Tempest and to the title hero in ET. It is what happens when
surefooted men or women - or aliens - find solid ground pulled from under
them and familiar backcloths swapped for terrae incognitae.
We should point all this out to you in preparation for this month's videos.
The great thing about being lost, as biologist Lorraine Bracco finds in
Medicine Man and Anthony Andrews in Lost In Siberia, and the hero of
Murnau's vampire classic Nosferatu and the heroines (more metaphysically
'lost') of The Hand Thats Rocks The Cradle and Les Diaboliques, is that you
re-examine yourself and your values. 'Where am I?' is a natural prequel to
'Who am I?'
Pre-Christmas video releases always do raise these great questions of life
and death, just when we are expecting tinselly escapism. (For that see last
paragraph). The marketing psychology is as follows. Fifty million Britons
will be soon be zonked out beyond resuscitation, gorged on wine, turkey and
pud, unless they the video marketeers provide something to think about,
wrestle with and stay awake for.
So here are Miss Bracco's adventures with Dr Sean Connery, her familiar
urban world upheaved as she swings through the jungle with him seeking rare
cancer-curing bromeliads. (Verdict: silly, but fun). Here is Anthony Andrews
in an Anglo-Soviet cine-Siberia, teeth chattering over the gelid dialogue
and matching direction. (Silly, but less fun). And here, more formidably,
are the towering Gothic disorientations of that horror classic Nosferatu,
released in shrewd synchronicity with the soon-to-engulf-us wave of Dracula
films.
Has there ever been a better film about being lost? The great German
director FW Murnau took the Gothic conventions of his time (1922) and turned
them inside-out, upside-down. Instead of the crazed studio sets of German
Expressionism, he filmed outdoors and in a real castle. And instead of
confronting his young hero adrift in Carpathia with the expected smoothly
handsome vampire, he cast the hideously made-up Max Shreck as the
neck-biter, a bald bat-eared human rat in funerary frock coat.
No wonder the youngster has to readjust his world-view and grow into
premature adulthood. Likewise the young ladies of two delectable horror
films from different aeons. Annabella Sciorra's young housewife in the
recent The Hand That Rocks The Cradle is given a grow-up-fast course by
nanny Rebecca Mornay, a friendly blonde who kills and maims. (Horror films
about home invasion prove you can be lost in your very own dream domicile).
And in the 1954 French classic Les Diaboliques director Henri-Georges
Clouzot pushes his actress wife Vera into the screaming lead role of a
schoolmistress encouraged to murder by a colleague (Simone Signoret). Deadly
stabbings, horrid shadows, corpses rearing from bathwater.
But you are right. It is the festive season and before leaving we should
earmark some videos for the children. Disney's 1950 animated feature
Cinderella, though not quite vintage, has a scene-stealing Fairy Godmother
and several show-stopping songs. Alan Parker's The Commitments is a funny,
generous-spirited comedy about a Dublin soul band. And Laurel and Hardy are
available in a collector's rarity, The March Of The Wooden Soldiers.
As for Alastair Sim in Scrooge, he still presides over the best screen
version of A Christmas Carol, made in 1951. Mr Sim, all teeth, chuckles and
nervous sepulchral chuckles, even makes Scrooge a bit of a charmer. But that
is what Christmas is about. Peace and good will to all men, even to those
above-mentioned video distributors who have an odd idea of what we should
watch at Christmas.
