How do actors relax between matinee and evening performances? Tom Oleniacz, who 
starred as Scrooge in "A Christmas Carol" at the San Diego Repertory Theatre's 
Lyceum Stage, took time out Christmas Eve to marry the actress next door, 
Yolanda Lloyd Delgado, who plays the young bride Beatriz in the Rep's "Burning 
Patience" at the Lyceum Space. The honeymoon commenced with the final 
performance of "A Christmas Carol." "Burning Patience" returns to the Rep for 
one week in January.
