<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Repertory Theatre has produced a bold, challenging, beautifully 
wrought version of "A Christmas Carol" on its Lyceum Stage that will not be to 
everyone's taste. 
</P>
<P>
To bring home Dickens' message about the poor of his day in the show's 15th 
annual year here, directors Walter Schoen and Tavis Ross have contemporized the 
setting so that we can see Charles Dickens' story as it might be discovered by 
the poor of our day. 
</P>
<P>
Dickens himself, a passionate advocate for the overworked and underfed, would 
probably love it. But post-show complaints mixed with praise from an audience 
that seemed divided about having their old-fashioned "Christmas Carol" tampered 
with. 
</P>
<P>
Without changing the words in the faithful adaptation by Douglas Jacobs, the 
company's artistic director, the story begins in a contemporary urban setting, 
not unlike the streets surrounding the theater itself. The actors are dressed 
like our own homeless, crowding around barrels of burning paper for warmth. And 
their varying ethnic backgrounds -- African-American, Anglo, Latino -- hold up 
a mirror to our own multicultural society. 
</P>
<P>
Into this mix, a little boy, played by the adorably precocious 10-year-old Kory 
Abosada, brings a copy of "A Christmas Carol" home to read to his mother. Just 
as he gets started, the police sirens start shrieking and the people run to 
hide. The little boy returns with his book before the others do and encounters 
an old man (Leon Singer) checking the place out. The boy approaches the man, 
and the man slaps him -- hard. The other homeless return and surround the old 
man menacingly. 
</P>
<P>
The old man's punishment as mimed by the company? He has to act out "A 
Christmas Carol" with them, playing the part of Ebenezer Scrooge. The boy plays 
the parts of both Tiny Tim and the youngest of the Ebenezers that Scrooge meets 
in his subsequent journey with the Ghost of Christmas Past. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the story ends, with the cast pulling props from their environment 
and singing haunting Christmas melodies that come out of their variety of 
heritages, the old man who plays Scrooge has had a change of heart. This time 
when the sirens come, he puts his arm around the little boy protectively. Like 
Scrooge, he has learned a lesson about keeping Christmas in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
This year's production is an extension of the contemporary setting explored by 
Schoen as solo director last year. But while the idea seemed unfinished a year 
ago, this time the added pantomimed prologue brings the message home. 
</P>
<P>
One certainly cannot imagine any improvement on the performances. 
</P>
<P>
Singer, an actor who hails originally from Mexico, is a memorable Scrooge -- so 
crusty and cynical that it is all the more moving when he melts. Lance E. 
Nichols is stalwart as Scrooge's good clerk, Bob Cratchit, Richard Ortega 
utterly charming as Scrooge's good-hearted nephew, Fred. Tavis Ross suggests 
pain even as he inspires fear as the ghost of Scrooge's old partner in 
parsimony, Jacob Marley. Osayande Baruti brings charismatic life to the 
high-stepping Fezziwig, the good master Scrooge had as a young apprentice. And 
Cristina Soria lends fine support in her double role as Fezziwig's and 
Cratchit's wives. 
</P>
<P>
Narrators Dana Pere and Alyce Smith-Cooper keep the story flowing as they pass 
the story from hand to hand. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nelson, who plays the oldest of the young Ebenezers, provides the 
spirited choreography that is such a delight in the Fezziwig scene. Musical 
director Linda Vickerman does such a fine job with the arrangements and 
compositions sung by this terrific array of voices, that one wishes more music 
could have been included. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Buderwitz's sets, nicely lit by John B. Forbes, are as they were last year 
-- intelligently evocative of a modern street scene, with props designed to 
look as if they came naturally from such a place. The costumes by Mary Larson 
also seem reminiscent of those from last year, but again cleverly so. The best 
of the pleasing bunch has got to be the Ghost of Christmas Present costume 
which makes the big, hearty-voiced Richard Allen look like a human Christmas 
tree, with tinsel and name brand packaging hanging from his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
But the true completion of the contemporizing concept here is the San Diego 
Rep's Magic Christmas program. Each patron is requested to bring an unwrapped 
present for disadvantaged children and/or their families from the Hillcrest 
Receiving Home, St. Vincent de Paul, Casa de Amaro, Hidden Valley House, 
Southeast Emergency Quarters, Project Safehouse and Casa de Paz. The presents 
will be placed under a tree in the Lyceum lobby and on Dec. 19, the actor 
playing Scrooge will give out the presents after a benefit performance for 
children and families from these shelters. 
</P>
<P>
For that audience, this setting should certainly bring the Dickens' story home.
