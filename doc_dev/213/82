   The holiday box-office sweepstakes is proving
lucrative for comedies as ``Twins,'' starring Danny DeVito and
Arnold Schwarzenegger as the unlikely brothers, debuted at No. 1 at
the nation's movie theaters.
   ``Twins'' grossed $11.2 million last weekend, topping two other
comedies, according to figures released by Exhibitor Relations Co.
   ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,'' a send-up of
law enforcement, finished in second with $6.1 million, down sharply
from its strong opening the previous week.
   In third was ``Scrooged,'' Bill Murray's comic reworking of the
Dickens Christmas classic, which collected $4.7 million.
   The moody drama ``Tequila Sunrise,'' starring Mel Gibson and
Michelle Pfeiffer, claimed fourth place with $4 million. Next was
the animated ``Oliver &amp; Company,'' an Oliver Twist-inspired story
about a homeless kitten, which collected $2.5 million.
   ``Oliver &amp; Company'' appears to be winning the season's animation
battle, as its chief animated rival, ``The Land Before Time,'' fell
to sixth place with sales of $2.14 million even though it is playing
on more movie screens than ``Oliver.''
   The newly formed Weintraub Entertainment Group's string of
box-office flops continued with a very lackluster opening for ``My
Stepmother is an Alien.'' On the heels of Weintraub's failed ``Fresh
Horses'' and ``The Big Blue,'' ``My Stepmother is an Alien,''
starring Dan Aykroyd and Kim Basinger, brought in only $2.07 million
in its first week of release.
   Rounding out the top 10 were ``Ernest Saves Christmas'' in eighth
with $1.5 million, ``Child's Play'' with $1.3 million and ``Cocoon:
The Return,'' with $950,000.
   The holiday movie season continues this week with ``Dirty Rotten
Scoundrels'' and ``Torch Song Trilogy'' opening Wednesday and ``Rain
Man'' opening Friday.
