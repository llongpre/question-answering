<LEADPARA>  Judges ended a tradition of refusing to order Christmastime evictions this
year after criticism that it violated the separation of church and state.;  
But the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department created an informal moratorium
of its own by working extra hard on evictions Monday, so officers would not
have to evict anyone on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     They planned to resume evictions Thursday.;   "It's just not a good thing
to do, to take down (their) Christmas tree and tell them to hit the streets,"
said sheriff's Sgt. James Ganey. "None of us wants to do that.";   Ganey went
home early Tuesday and could not be located to determine how many evictions
the department completed Monday. He said Monday that the county had 10 to 15
evictions daily this time of year.;   Milwaukee's judges decided to end their
traditional two-week Christmas eviction moratorium after the American Civil
Liberties Union said it had the effect of promoting a religious celebration.; 
 Last year, then-Chief Judge Michael Barron refused a request from landlords
to cancel the moratorium.;   The moratorium "prevents a Scrooge-like
appearance on the part of the courts and sheriff's department," Barron said.; 
 "If they don't want the appearance of being Scrooge-like, the county should
develop some plans that would provide for alternative housing for poor people
who are vulnerable to being evicted," said Eunice Edgar, ACLU executive
director in Milwaukee.;   "People think of the terrible landlords throwing
little kids into snowbanks at Christmastime," said Tim Ballering, vice
president of the Apartment Association of Milwaukee.  </TEXT>
