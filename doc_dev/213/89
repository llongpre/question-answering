   The bank tellers of Christmas past are
haunting Charles Dickens.
   Dickens _ a namesake but not a descendant of the author who
wrote of Christmas ghosts in ``A Christmas Carol'' _ was indicted
Tuesday by a federal grand jury on charges of robbing three banks
and trying to hold up a fourth during the holidays.
   Dickens, 36, is accused of taking $1,776 from a PSFS bank on
Dec. 21; $2,316 from a Germantown Savings branch Dec. 26 and $950
from the same branch on Jan. 2; and $1,305 from a Home Unity
Savings and Loan branch Jan. 6.
   He also is charged with unsuccessfully trying to rob the United
Valley Bank on Jan. 2.
   Dickens has been jailed without bail after a teller from an
earlier holdup saw him three weeks ago in front of a bank. Court
records show that other tellers have identified Dickens as the man
who robbed their banks.
