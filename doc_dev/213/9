<LEADPARA>  'A CHRISTMAS Carol" is the holiday tradition I look forward to most, and
American Conservatory Theater does it better than anyone else.;   The original
1843 novella is more than a Christmas ornament, which is why it continues to
move people to tears, year after year. Charles Dickens wrote it as Christian
social protest: a lesson to England's comfortable middle classes, insulated
behind diamond-paned windows from the grime and despair of the Industrial
Revolution.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ACT'S 'CHRISTMAS CAROL' IS STILL THE BEST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Today, after the money-grubbing '80s, as we face recession and unemployment
and pay taxes to support our own post-Victorian workhouses, its powerful
message of responsibility and compassion still rings strong and true.;   ACT's
annual production of this parable is by now a classic, but the company isn't
resting on its laurels (or should we say its green bay and holly?) in its
silver anniversary season. It assigned the show to David Maier, co-founder of
its alumni Encore Theater Company, and he has freshened it wonderfully.;  
Maier has encouraged the actors to revisit the familiar text and add a wealth
of detail, as, for instance, the way Marley's ghost strains against his
fetters -- they're anchored somewhere in the netherworld -- to gain time so he
can warn Ebenezer Scrooge about the consequences of his miserly life. Or the
way a child in the Christmas Past episode puts his hand confidingly in
Scrooge's, causing that "covetous old sinner" to look down with surprise at
this human and loving gesture.;   William Paterson is Scrooge in 13 of the 25
performances, with Ken Ruta in the other 12. Both are past masters of the
role, able to snarl "Bah, humbug!" with panache.;   There are genial
performances from Michael Scott Ryan as the ironic narrator, Richard
Butterfield and Judith Moreland as Bob and Mrs. Cratchit, Kelvin Han Yee as
Marley's ghost, Mark Silence as nephew Fred. Laurie McDermott turns the sweet
integrity of Belle, young Scrooge's lost love, into purest silver, which also
describes the voice of the caroler, Danielle Vinje.;   The production does
tend to run long, by about 10 minutes. That's fixable.;   The whole takes
place on Robert Blackman's enchanting unit set, an Advent calendar with
candelabra, toys, street lamps, door knockers, clock faces and inkwells carved
into its veneer. If you look closely, you can see that it has cash boxes for
steps and piled-up account ledgers for bedposts.;   I was struck, this time
through, to recognize the beautiful recurring song by Lee Hoiby as a true
carol: that is, a strophic song. The story itself is strophic -- Dickens
called its divisions "staves," not chapters -- and each section represents one
stanza in the carol of Ebenezer Scrooge, the grinch stolen by Christmas.;   --
