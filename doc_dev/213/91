   The ratings sweeps are over, so you can't
exactly accuse Ted Koppel of doing a report on s-e-x this week to
boost ABC's Nielsens.
   But you can accuse him of doing a fine, responsible job in ``The
Koppel Report: Sex in the Soviet Union.'' And of going beyond the
old reliables: porn, prostitution and the baring of Soviet bosoms
for Playboy magazine.
   The thesis of Koppel's special, which airs Wednesday, is that
the uproars loosed by the new freedom of sex and expression in
Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union reflect far more profound changes
convulsing that nation.
   As Koppel notes in his preface: ``This is a program about
political, economic and moral problems as seen through the prism of
sex in the Soviet Union.''
   This doesn't mean the one-hour show is a dry recitation of those
problems, though. Far from it.
   An advance look at an unfinished version of the show reveals
some pictures you could call ``wowee!'' shots - even though ABC
says they'll be electronically altered before broadcast.
   These include scenes of dancing, bare-breasted women who are
part of a heavy metal act, and a nude woman starting to put a
condom on a nude man in a sex education film shown right there on
Soviet TV.
   (Speaking of the latter, Koppel wryly notes that this still
would be a no-no here, that ``what is now routinely shown on Soviet
state television has to be sanitized for American TV.'')
   And it's amusing to see Soviet men crowded into a cramped
basement ``Videoklub,'' one of a number of porn theaters now
allowed, avidly watching a soft-core porn movie full of the usual
gasps and heavy breathing.
   But all this aside, Koppel's expedition into Soviet lives, laws
and morals under glasnost is a somber, often sad trip, despite the
occasional side visit to places like the Videoklub or the interview
with a former soldier who now earns his way impersonating Marilyn
Monroe.
   The main stories Koppel reports on: the lack of privacy caused
by housing shortages; rampant divorce; virtually no sex education;
a lack of contraceptive devices, and an abortion rate he says is
six times that of the United States. One woman he interviews claims
to have had nine abortions and her mother, 19.
   In his look at the world's oldest profession, Soviet-style,
Koppel reports that prostitution is seen not as just a profitable
venture. It also is seen as a means of escape, a chance to meet and
marry Western men who will take their ladies of the night from the
Soviet Union.
   AIDS is on the rise and a potential epidemic, he finds, and for
the same reason it has spread in the United States - ``promiscuity
and ignorance.''
   New freedoms may abound, but homosexuality remains a cause for
furtive gatherings; it's still a crime punishable by up to three
years in prison.
   As one Soviet official bluntly puts it, homosexuality should be
a crime ``because most people who are AIDS virus carriers are
homosexuals.''
   Much in the show has been reported on before. But Koppel and his
troops do a first-rate job of putting it all into comprehensive
context.
   They don't always succeed, notably in the closing chapter in
which Koppel tries to sort out the meaning of increasing public
outrage that seems fairly divided.
   One increasingly vocal camp is opposed to the new
permissiveness. The other demands more freedom for sexual
minorities and far better treatment for women who, the show
reports, remain second-class citizens in all aspects of Soviet
life, including employment.
   Koppel's search for the cosmic conclusion to all this doesn't
quite come off. But no matter. His show still is a solid,
well-crafted documentary of the kind that have become a rarity at
the big networks.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   LEND AN EAR: Radio, as old fuds know, is TV without pictures.
Sometimes it even makes you use your imagination. Case in point:
National Public Radio's unique version of Charles Dickens' ``A
Christmas Carol,'' taped for broadcast by NPR stations during the
holidays. In it, Jonathan Winters, the wild man of many voices,
stars as Scrooge - and also is the voice of every other male
character in the show, even Tiny Tim. The womenfolk all are played
by Mimi Kennedy. It's an amazing feat by Winters. The only
drawback: He doesn't play it for laughs. He actually plays it
straight.
   Incidentally, NPR has had a brain wave aimed at helping those
who don't know the dial location of their local public radio
station. Just dial 202-822-2323, NPR says. The party at the other
end will be more than glad to help.
