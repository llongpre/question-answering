<LEADPARA>  I HAVE been a subscriber for quite a long time, as I've lived in California
for eight years, a transplant from the East.;    I have a very serious
complaint. I was ill without being able to keep up with my papers . . . what
happened to Paul Goreniuc's fabulous piece of sculpture, "Space Dance for
Peace IV," that is now in front of Los Gatos' library -- our loss was Los
Gatos' gain! Who voted on it? No one I heard of. Before it was on the
Sunnyvale Community Center lawn, just across from where I live. I viewed it
every day.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     My illness lasted over a year and I'm sure that's why I didn't know about
it until recently. You people and our city aren't encouraging good art.;
Matilda E. Rossiter; Sunnyvale; RESTAURANT'S FORMER LIFE;    I enjoy David L.
Beck's restaurant reporting, but today was a classic on the Los Gatos Chart
House ("The Chart House Chain Has Lost More Than Its Paddles," Weekend, Dec.
21).;    You really painted a perfect picture of the place, but one
interesting historical fact about the old Victorian structure was left out.;  
 I grew up in Los Gatos, where my father had the only jewelry store in town
for many years. Well, we all knew the Place family there, who for several
generations operated the Place Funeral Home at this same location. Since
reading your article, I have started wondering if the Victorian's past could
have anything at all to do with the culinary shortcomings.;    Donald B.
Streepey; San Jose; PASS THE CORN PONE;    "Scrooge unfair to actors!" is my
response to Judith "Scrooge" Green's recent review of "Appalachian Ebeneezer"
at the Santa Cruz Co. Actor's Theater, ("Local Clerks Go On Strike! Scrooge
Unfair to Workers!" Living, Dec. 11).;    These local, non-professional actors
(most of whom play up to four different roles during the show) should not be
held responsible for Green's difficulty in swallowing the script. The cast of
"Appalachian Ebeneezer" should be commended for its ensemble work and for the
many scenes which become magical  because of it. To say the cast used a
"corn-pone accent" is really a tribute to the dialect level achieved.;   
Green's superficial review is obviously reflected by her mention of some of
the "amusing touches," i.e., the unwrapping of the Actor's Theater stage as a
present for the audience then listing the players involved as the Cratchit
children, which they were not.;    Leigh T. Nelson; Santa Cruz  </TEXT>
