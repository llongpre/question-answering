FT  11 DEC 93 / Customs to play Scrooge at the office party

HM Customs &amp; Excise will be playing Scrooge at companies' Christmas parties
this year after an over-zealous attempt by an accountancy firm to claim back
value added tax from their festive celebrations.
Companies will now only be able to receive back up to half of the VAT on
parties for their staff, according to a technical briefing issued by
Customs.
'In the past all VAT charged on employee entertainment costs was
recoverable,' said Mr Tony McClenaghan, a partner with accountants Touche
Ross. 'This is bad news for businesses and employees as it pushes up the
cost of Christmas parties.'
Customs' attention was drawn to VAT rebates on entertainment earlier this
year when tax partners in the Birmingham office of accountants KPMG Peat
Marwick decided to fight for more money.
They appealed against the Customs' rule that companies could only reclaim
VAT on expenses incurred on their employees at parties, and not the money
spent on their staff's guests.
KPMG won the case by arguing that guests were merely sharing the staff's
celebrations for their past efforts, and were not present for business
purposes - which would have made them ineligible for rebates.
Customs - which had been quiet on the subject up until then - has since
appealed against the judgment and issued a retaliatory technical bulletin,
which says it will only accept 50 per cent of the costs of employee
entertainment for any refunds of VAT.
If the appeal succeeds, companies will be left out of pocket for substantial
sums. On parties attended equally by employees and guests, the amount they
will be able to reclaim will fall from half to a quarter of the VAT
incurred.
Last night Customs said: 'People can always make a case to get back more
from their local VAT office. But nobody at Customs gets any VAT back on our
Christmas parties. Staff have to pay their own expenses.'
