Most kids would say their moms are wonderful, but how many can say, "My mom is 
a living doll" without stretching the truth a little? 
</P>
<P>
Jessica Slocum can. She's the heroine of the modern-day fairy-tale A Mom For 
Christmas, an NBC movie about a motherless little girl with a heartfelt 
wish-she wants a mother of her own for Christmas. The magic starts when a 
department store mannequin comes to life, thus granting Jessica and her 
workaholic dad that special someone in their lives. But the two soon realize 
that they'll have to do some very quick thinking to keep their new "mom" with 
them once the holidays are over. Olivia Newton-John stars as mom/mannequin Amy, 
Doug Sheehan plays Jessica's dad, and Juliet Sorcey plays Jessica.
