<LEADPARA>  IN SHOW biz, when they talk about "making it," they mean making it young. That
way, when you mix with the beautiful rich people, you are beautiful and rich
yourself.;    Well, Sydney Walker just joined the crowd. A-n-d, he just turned
70. It's not how he planned it when he began acting 50 years ago. Fame and
fortune were just around the corner, but he always seemed to be on the wrong
street.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Not that Walker didn't manage a theatrical career filled with moments of
great satisfaction, great roles in great plays. He spent a half-century on the
stage, a considerable portion of it in the Bay Area. But as for the gilded
movie business, he had just two tiny roles before this year.;    In Erich
Segal's huge hit "Love Story" (1970), he was Dr. Shapely, the man who tells
Ryan O'Neal the fateful news about Ali MacGraw.;    On the other end of the
spectrum, there was the totally forgotten "The Way We Live Now," a Barry Brown
film.;    "I played a publisher," says Walker, a sly grin on his weathered
face. "The first week the film grossed some pitiful amount, like $1,000. The
second week it was down to $800.";    Things promise to look a whole lot
better around Christmas, when a major new film, "Prelude to a Kiss," opens in
the key markets in time for Academy Award consideration. This time Walker has
the pivotal role of the mysterious old man who comes to the wedding of young
lovers, played by Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan, and transforms everyone's lives.;
   How in the world did "unknown" 70-year-old Sydney Walker go from Bay Area
journeyman actor to one of the most fascinating screen roles in years? How did
he get on the right street and turn that corner?;    The affable Walker, never
one to whine and wonder, has his philosophical response: "Let life find you,"
he says. "It's better that way.";    Our tale today is about how life
suddenly, mysteriously found Sydney Walker.;    WALKER was born in
Philadelphia in 1921. He never went to college, having decided at age 7 1/2 to
become an actor.;    He says there must be something genetic in the decision.
"My grandfather was a fundamentalist minister. There's nothing more theatrical
than that.";    The first acting experience came at the Hedgerow Theater in
Philadelphia. World War II came next, and he served with the Third Army in
Europe. The GI Bill paid for acting school.;    Walker, unable to find work in
Los Angeles, came to San Francisco in 1950. "It was foggy, and I fell in
love." He worked with the Interplayers, a repertory company.;    Walker is a
wonderful raconteur, talking about his career in fascinating detail,
mentioning parts and playhouses. He seems to have approached every role with
delight, or at least it seems so in his telling of it now.;    He laughs about
summer stock in Pennsylvania where he did 15 plays in 15 weeks -- a survival
course, he says.;    He laughs about soap opera roles: Dr. Bruce Benning on
"The Guiding Light" and Msgr. Quinn on "The Secret Storm.";    "They were
going to call that show 'The Storm Within,' Walker says, "but then the prime
sponsor was Alka Seltzer so they thought better of it.";    Anyway, Walker's
character died of pneumonia so Walker could go work with the Lincoln Center
Rep.;    "I loved it all, and soap opera -- that's the last form of authentic
American folklore -- it paid for the down payment on my house.";    Walker
seems to have a perpetual grin, and he had it long before these days of
newfound fame. Everyone talks about him as a "sweet" man. He was a wonderful
Scrooge for the American Conservatory Theater's "A Christmas Carol," an annual
event, turning that nasty gent into a beloved Santa Claus.;    Walker spent
five years in New York in the '60s working with Ellis Rabb's esteemed APA
(Association of Producing Artists) company. The company had a Hall of Fame
roster of actors, including Helen Hayes, Eva Le Gallienne, Donald Moffat and
Nancy Walker. Nancy is not a relative, but Sydney relishes a review by Walter
Kerr that included a laudatory paragraph, beginning: "Now a word about the
Walkers . . .";    Other periods of time in New York were spent working less
creatively with U.S. Customs, checking ship manifestos.;    Then "on my
sister's birthday in 1970," Walker got a call from ACT's William Ball, the
founder and artistic director: " 'Sydney, I don't know if this is the second
or third time I've invited you to join ACT, but I won't take 'no' for an
answer.' ";    Walker has worked with ACT for 16 years. He took breaks to
perform "Nathan the Wise," an 18th-century play by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing
which Walker adapted, at the Sunnyvale Rep. And he played Prospero in
Shakespeare's "The Tempest" with the San Jose Repertory Theater at the Center
for the Performing Arts.;    OK, now about that corner he turned.;    A couple
of years ago, Walker was asked by Berkeley Rep artistic director Sharon Ott to
play the old man in "Prelude to a Kiss" in Berkeley. The Craig Lucas play had
been done successfully at the South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, and
director Norman Rene was reproducing it here.;    Walker says the script
"fused right away -- it's a marvelous part in a marvelous play.";    It's a
naturalistic story that suddenly turns into a mystical fairy tale: Boy meets
and woos lovely girl, but on their wedding day, at which an uninvited old man
is present, the bride's soul and spirit are mysteriously transposed into the
body of this strange, uninvited man. And the man's spirit is transferred to
her body, leaving the young groom confused and distraught.;    As written by
playwright Lucas, this isn't a silly comedy. Lucas is asking us to deal with
the essence of love and commitment in a marriage. What is love, and where does
it go when youth disappears? The affirmation of genuine caring proves to be
quite moving.;    The Berkeley Rep reviews were ecstatic, and the play was
extended. And then it was taken to New York by the Circle Repertory.;   
Walker himself, however, despite the rave reviews, was not invited to go with
the play. It seems the Circle Rep wanted to use its own players, and one was
Barnard Hughes, in the part of the old man. "They said it would insult Hughes
if they didn't use him," Walker says.;    Mary Louise Parker, another standout
as the young girl in both the South Coast Rep and Berkeley Rep productions,
did get the New York opportunity -- and a Tony Award.;    Bad memories; 
Walker later was asked to replace Hughes for various lengths of time as the
play moved from off-Broadway to Broadway. But the money was poor, or at least
not enough to erase Walker's memory of having been mugged a couple of times on
New York streets.;    Another explanation: "After a fine career in New York, I
didn't want to return by sneaking in the back door.";    People from a later
Chicago production also called Walker, but the actor, who loves to tend his
garden, didn't want to face a Windy City winter.;    "I really don't have to
have it," Walker remembers thinking. "Let someone else experience it.";   
When the movie was being planned, Walker was rehearsing last season's ACT
production of "1918." The role of the old man in the film had gone to Alec
Guinness, and there was nothing he could say about that.;    But Guinness'
wife became seriously ill, and the English actor had to bow out of the
project. According to Walker, director Rene told the producers he could now
have the actor he wanted all along. Rene "went to bat for me. The producers
suggested a screen test. But Norman said, 'No, I want Walker.';    "So the
only negotiations were about money. Of course, I wasn't going to get paid what
Guinness was going to get paid. I was told that the way you negotiate is to
ask for twice as much as you hope to get. My agent said we should try to get
$75,000. So we asked for $150,000.;    "We didn't get it. But we got a lot
more than $75,000.";    Another gleeful grin crosses Walker's face. It's a
huge payday for him, though nothing record-breaking for Hollywood.;    Walker
relishes talking about the filming, obviously a unique experience for a
workaday stage actor. He was picked up every morning in a personal limousine.
He was housed each night in a comfy suite at the Ambassador East in Chicago,
where the film was shot because of a New York union dispute.;    "On the set,
there was another sort of role reversal, between Baldwin and me. He's 33, but
he was the daddy, instructing me. He would speak for me and demand my rights
if they asked me to work too hard. He said I had to preserve my energy. If
they asked me to do another take at night, he'd say, 'Sydney can do that scene
in the morning.' He was very protective of me.";    Walker worked three
months, through July 8. There is some "dubbing and publicizing" still to do in
places such as New York, Los Angeles and London. The film promises to get
Walker the kind of attention he has never gotten.;    Indeed, Walker is
delighted with his good fortune. "I feel it's a celebration," he says. "I have
been given a gigantic birthday present.";    A longtime bachelor, Walker was
married from 1952 to 1956, but he says the aspirations were mismatched.;   
"Marriage to my wife was the man coming home every night to a house behind a
white picket fence. You close the door at 6 o'clock. After that you are hers.
For an actor, that doesn't work." There were no children, "thank God.";   
Walker seems a comfortable man, at ease with himself. He comes home when he
can and works in his garden. When his car was vandalized some years back, he
never bought another one. And he says he isn't necessarily looking for another
film.;    "Don't say this film is the culmination of my career. It's been a
wonderful experience, but I don't insist that it happen again and again. Let
the thing be. I'm enjoying it.;    "I don't need a limousine. I have my
(public-transit) fast-pass. This is who I am. I'm a working actor who uses the
bus and the subway.";    Competition fading;  But he grins and says that movie
parts may be easier to get as he ages, "because my competition is dying off.; 
  "I have felt very fulfilled. I enjoy all sorts of things. I enjoy the
Readers Digest videos I have been doing on national parks. I find that, too,
is fulfilling. I like doing commercials. I like doing my gardening.;    "I
keep my oar in the water. Dammit, it was about time for something like this.
But I don't need it, really. Not any more.;    "That's the nice thing about my
age. Let life find you. It's much better that way."  </TEXT>
