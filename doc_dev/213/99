   High interest rates and slumping financial markets
are casting Scrooge's shadow over Christmas for many British
businesses and workers.
   Retailers say high interest rates _ the government's strategy for
fighting inflation _ are depressing sales and prompting pre-holiday
price markdowns.
   Industrial companies say their profits are feeling a pinch too,
and investment firms have made major layoffs in the face of low
trading volumes and fierce competition.
   The good news is that recent economic reports show the higher
interest rates are beginning to slow the overheating economy. That
means rates might not go higher.
   The bad news is that retailers are weathering a slowdown at what
traditionally is one of the busiest times of the year.
   ``Trade is not what it usually is before Christmas. People are
being more cautious with their money because of higher interest
rates,'' said a spokeswoman for the Oxford Street Association, whose
120 members operate stores on London's main shopping street.
   Angela Mostaani, a 36-year-old secretary buying Christmas
wrapping paper, said higher interest rates were affecting her
shopping.
   ``We bought our first house in April, when the interest rate was
8 percent. I'm trying to buy less,'' Mrs. Mostaani said.
   To slow spending, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson pushed
interest rates to 13 percent from June's decade-low 7.5 percent.
Mortgage rates have risen to 12.75 percent from 11.5 percent and are
expected to reach 13.5 percent in January.
   The annual inflation rate has picked up to 6.4 percent from 3.3
percent in January.
   Paul Bayliss, a 30-year-old accountant shopping in the same store
as Mrs. Mostaani, also said he was worried about higher interest
rates, but added: ``We'll not let it spoil Christmas, anyway.''
   Some stores are taking pre-Christmas markdowns to move
merchandise: Liberty and Co., a clothing and fabrics retailer, said
it has reduced some women's designer clothes up to one-third.
   ``It's been a very difficult season for ladies fashions,'' said
Kathryn Dighton, a Liberty spokeswoman.
   But she added: ``We're experiencing a particularly good Christmas
season. We expect (sales) to be up between 12 percent and 14 percent
throughout the store.''
   Meanwhile, investment firms in the City, London's financial
district, are laying off people because of competition and low
trading volumes. The government's tight grip on spending also has
hurt the market in gilts, or British government bonds.
   Morgan Grenfell Group PLC announced Dec. 6 it was shutting its
gilt and equity market-making operations, cutting 450 jobs just
before the holidays.
   It was the biggest single cutback announced since the October
1987 stock market crash and Big Bang, the 1986 deregulation of
Britain's financial markets.
   Separately, the British textile group Coats Viyella PLC warned
Wednesday its pre-tax profit could fall as much as 40 percent in
1988, mostly because of high interest rates and the strong British
pound.
   But some Britons have been encouraged by three economic reports
released this past week which show the government's tactics appear
to be working.
   The government reported last Friday that the annual inflation
rate held steady at 6.4 percent in November.
   Last Thursday, it reported the underlying annual growth of
average earnings fell to 9 percent in October from 9.25 percent in
September. Earlier, it said retail sales fell 0.5 percent in
November.
   ``The retail sales figures we saw at the beginning of the week
were certainly helpful to show that demand is coming off a bit,''
said economist Derek Scott of the investment firm Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Ltd.
   Economists now are expecting inflation to peak at between 7.25
percent and 7.5 percent next year rather than at 8 percent or
higher, Scott said.
   But he added: ``We won't really see evidence (of a slowdown)
until the New Year.''
