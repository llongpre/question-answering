METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUND BARRIER TO BLOCK LAX NOISE TO BE 
STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo will study the feasibility of installing a sound barrier along 
Imperial Highway to reduce the noise from Los Angeles International Airport, 
which has plagued the city for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Airport Commissioners last week allocated $50,000, but no date for 
the start of the study has been set, said Don Harrison, assistant to the city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
The terrain along Imperial is hilly, and Harrison said the city believes that 
an earthen berm or a wall could effectively shield homes in lower-lying 
neighborhoods from the engine noise of aircraft on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Beard, LAX airport noise abatement officer, said a 20-foot-high berm and 
wall combination built several years ago north of the airport has cut noise 
from planes operating on the ground by up to 50% for the first two rows of 
homes near the wall.
