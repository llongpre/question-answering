   A crowd approaching half a
million people, the second-largest ever to witness a shuttle
landing, became mired in a traffic jam of galactic proportions as
they headed home after Discovery's triumphant return.
   An estimated 109,000 cars, motor homes, trailers and trucks
carrying about 410,000 Discovery watchers churned clouds of
talcum-fine dust into the desert air Monday as they inched toward
the only exit from the public viewing area.
   It took vehicles 4{ hours or longer to cover the mile to the
exit from the dry lakebed. From there, traffic crawled along a
two-lane blacktop road at 20 mph.
   In addition to the huge crowd at the public viewing area, Air
Force spokesman Lt. Col. George Neiss estimated another 15,000 to
20,000 viewers watched the landing at a separate VIP section,
bringing the total crowd to 425,000 or more.
   The only larger crowd to watch a shuttle land was on July 4,
1982, when an estimated 500,000 turned out as President and Nancy
Reagan greeted Columbia.
   ``This is crazy,'' said Ellery Sabin, 66, who drove his 33-foot
motor home from Ludington, Mich., to see the landing on the Mojave
Desert floor. ``I've been around crowds, but this is really
something.''
   Like many shuttle watchers, he said Discovery's return would
reinvigorate America's space program.
   ``There's such a sense of pride here,'' Sabin said.
   Two sonic booms announced the shuttle's return at 9:34 a.m.,
eliciting gasps and screams from the crowd.
   ``It sends chills up my spine,'' said 26-year-old Steve Bestwick
of Port Hueneme.
   Vice President George Bush, California Gov. George Deukmejian
and famed pilot Chuck Yeager also were on hand to welcome
Discovery's crew home.
   Commander Rick Hauck noted that since waking up Monday, he had
circled the globe eight times and crossed the coast of California
at 120,000 feet and traveling eight times the speed of sound.
   Then he turned to the first man to break the sound barrier and
said, ``Eat your heart out, Chuck Yeager.''
