<LEADPARA>  Paul F. Bikle, who served as director of NASA's Dryden Flight Research
Facility when technology used in the space shuttle program was developed, has

<TEXT>     Officials said Mr. Bikle died Saturday at a son's home in Salinas, where he
had been staying after suffering a heart attack at his own home in Lancaster,
which is near the base. There will be no service, officials said.;    "The
aerospace community lost a real expert," said Milt Thompson, chief of
engineering at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Tuesday.
"He was the foremost person in flight research.";    Oversaw X-15 programs; 
Mr. Bikle headed Dryden from September 1959 until his retirement in May 1971.
During his tenure, he oversaw such programs as the X-15 rocket, which
pioneered technology later employed to build and fly space shuttles.;    W.J.
"Pete" Knight, an X-15 test pilot who set a world's record of 4,520 mph on
Oct. 3, 1967, said he was saddened by Mr. Bikle's death.;    "On all counts,
he was a great individual," said Knight, who is mayor of Palmdale, another
city not far from Edwards.;    "I was proud to have known and worked with him.
He was one tremendous individual, and it's a great loss.";    Early in the
1960s in a work area called "Bikle's Bicycle Shop," NASA engineers built what
they referred to as a lifting body and nicknamed a flying bathtub. These
lifting bodies proved that an unpowered aircraft returning from space could be
maneuvered to a designated landing site.;    Mr. Bikle "was the one individual
responsible for the success of the X-15 and lifting-body program," Thompson
said. "The X-15 and the lifting-body programs combined provided an enormous
amount of experience and technology that led to the design of the space
shuttle.";    Mr. Bikle also piloted sailplanes and held the world's altitude
record for sailplanes -- 46,269 feet -- for more than 20 years. He made his
record flight near Lancaster on Feb. 25, 1961.;    "I'm like Chuck Yeager in
that I don't think records are that big of a deal," Mr. Bikle said in an
interview with the Los Angeles Daily News in 1987. "I went up because I
enjoyed flying.";    B-29 flight tests; Mr. Bikle was born June 5, 1916, in
Wilkinsburg, Pa. After graduating from the University of Detroit with a degree
in aeronautical engineering, Mr. Bikle went to work in 1940 for Wright
Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, doing flight-testing work on the B-29 bomber,
the aircraft used to drop the atomic bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, officials
said.  </TEXT>
