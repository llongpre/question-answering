   Three ear-shattering booms
mark the flight of an F-111 thundering at supersonic speed just 200
feet above a test range in the Florida panhandle.
   The fighter-bomber drops an experimental bomb, then the pilot
yanks the throttle back to idle, cutting the jet's thrust 90
percent.
   In seconds, the plane's speed drops from 940 mph to just under
600 _ a radical maneuver designed to limit noise and damage from
sonic booms.
   Without it, windows might have shattered in Holley and Navarre,
which lie near the end of the range; with it, residents might not
even hear the booms.
   ``It's such a violent deceleration we are actually thrown
forward in the cockpit, held back by our seat straps,'' said Maj.
Dan Isbell in an interview. ``We try our best to be good neighbors.
We don't want to go around breaking people's windows.''
   Isbell, a test pilot from Chattanooga, Tenn., was describing a
typical mission at Mach 1.2, or just over the speed of sound, at
the Air Force's only supersonic test range in the eastern United
States. The special low-level missions test non-nuclear weaponry
being developed here, including so-called smart bombs that glide to
their targets with pinpoint accuracy.
   Col. Harvey Greenberg, Eglin's chief claims officer, said the
Air Force nationwide received 265 claims for $465,138 in the 1987
budget year, but paid only $67,003 for 160 claims deemed valid
while denying 80. Some claims carry over to the next year.
   Eglin accounted for 27 of the valid claims and $4,931 in
damages, Air Force records show.
   But it has been worse in the past. A single boom in 1984
produced 34 claims that cost Eglin $15,865.
   The only other places where the Air Force permits low-level
supersonic flights are Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., and certain
other desert areas in the West, Isbell said.
   But none is as close to populated areas as Eglin's Range B-70.
Holley and Navarre lie just five to seven miles to the west.
   The 13-mile-long range is in the western half of a
720-square-mile military reservation, about 10 miles northwest of
Fort Walton Beach, once billed as ``Home of the Sonic Boom.''
   Local newspapers and radio stations carry Air Force news
releases about impending supersonic flights so residents won't be
startled if they hear the booms, said George Roberts, a civilian
spokesman in Eglin's public affairs office. He said missions have
been canceled when the releases failed to make the newspapers.
   Predicting the strength of sonic booms is an inexact science
that depends on such variables as aircraft size, speed, altitude
and weather factors including wind, air pressure and temperature,
Isbell said.
   Temperature inversions are the most serious complication,
capable of bouncing the sonic shock waves great distances. Isbell
said inversions have been suspected of breaking windows as far away
as downtown Pensacola, about 30 miles to the west.
   The F-111 is the largest of several types of aircraft used in
low-level supersonic testing and thus produces the loudest and most
damaging booms.
   An aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound generally
creates three shock waves, one by its nose, another by its
midsection and the third by its tail, Isbell said.
   Shock waves are caused when air molecules cannot get out of the
way of a plane flying faster than the speed of sound.
   The booms, however, dissipate rapidly over distance. Those
produced at high altitudes rarely are heard on the ground, and
supersonic flight above 30,000 feet, or almost 6 miles up, is
unrestricted, Isbell said.
   Studies conducted by the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration, which was checking the potential for damage from
space shuttles, indicate window breakage is about the worst damage
that can be caused by an aircraft.
   Some people, however, give sonic booms credit for more.
   A man living just across the Alabama state line about 50 miles
west of Eglin once complained that a sonic boom knocked his mobile
home off its foundation. The man later admitted he hadn't heard a
sonic boom and wasn't even home at the time. He later told Isbell
that he first thought it was caused by dynamiting at a quarry
across the street until he saw a television news report about a
boom causing broken windows at nearby cities.
   The most recent effort to limit boom complaints has been setting
up special meters that register shock waves even if they are
inaudible, Isbell said.
   ``Although arming the Air Force is our mission, we will always
have a responsibility to be good neighbors,'' he said. ``Minimizing
sonic booms is one way to fulfill that responsibility.''
