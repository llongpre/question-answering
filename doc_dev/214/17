<LEADPARA>  Glennis Yeager, a third-generation native of the Grass Valley area and wife of
the celebrated test pilot Chuck Yeager, died Dec. 22 at Travis Air Force Base
after a six-year fight with cancer. She was 66.;    Her husband, friends and
writers had long described Glennis Yeager as a strong-willed, intelligent,
industrious and independent woman. In her husband's autobiography that
included Mrs. Yeager's reflections, she wrote that she developed those traits
growing up on a small Bangor farm.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     An accomplished horse rider, hiker and a crack shot, she was best known to
millions throughout the world for her name that was part of the legend painted
on her husband's World War II P-51 fighter and on the X-1 in which he rode to
be the first man to break the sound barrier: "Glamorous Glennis.";    In the
movie adaptation of "The Right Stuff," Mrs. Yeager was portrayed as a
beautiful, quiet and somewhat mysterious woman.;    In her husband's book
"Press On!" Mrs. Yeager wrote:;    "If you've ever seen the movie 'The Right
Stuff' and you remember those scenes of Sam Shepard, playing Chuck, and
Barbara Hershey, as me, exchanging steamy looks -- well, our exact words may
have been different in real life, but the basic message about us is absolutely
true.;    "We felt very strongly about each other because each of us had just
what the other had been looking for, and I mean not just from the time we'd
reached marriageable age, but all our lives.";    The two met before World War
II when Chuck Yeager walked into the USO office in Oroville where Glennis was
working and arranged a dance for members of his squadron. Later, she
maintained that she hardly understood a word of his West Virginia drawl.;   
As for her role as an Air Force wife, Mrs. Yeager wrote:;    "I did what I
wanted to do and not what somebody else wanted me to do. I worked really hard
for squadron lunches and things like that -- it was a lot of fun putting on
shows and so on -- but I never felt it was necessary to be bored for the sake
of Chuck's career. And he wouldn't have wanted that either.";    In a 1988
interview, Chuck Yeager spoke briefly, and directly, of the chemotherapy and
surgery his wife had undergone since 1984 and of how she continued to work
hard at managing all of his affairs.;    "Man, if you can't do anything about
it, forget it and press on. . . . And she's got the same attitude.";    There
was no public memorial service.;    Besides her husband, Mrs. Yeager is
survived by sons, Mike, of Oregon, and Don, of Colorado, and daughters, Susan,
of Nevada City, and Sharon Flick, of Reno, and 13 grandchildren.  </TEXT>
