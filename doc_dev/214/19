  [Text] The situation in south Lebanon is worrying. We are 
receiving reports every five minutes of Israeli warplanes 
overflying the region. We received a report 10 minutes ago that 
Israeli warplanes are raiding the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights after 
intensive reconnaissance sorties throughout the night and into 
the morning over al-Nabatiyah, Iqlim al-Tuffah, western 
al-Biqa', al-Luwayzah, Jarju', and the central sector. 
  We received a report two hours ago that the Israeli 
bombardment of villages in the south intensified and continued 
until 1300, targeting the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights, Jarju', 'Ayn 
Bu Siwar, and Arab Salim. At about 1330, Israeli warplanes flew 
intensively at low altitude over Iqlim al-Tuffah and 
al-Nabatiyah, staging mock raids. The Lebanese Army confronted 
the aircraft with anti-aircraft guns. Iqlim al-Tuffah areas and 
al-Luwayzah came under artillery barrage at 1100 from the South 
Lebanese Army [SLA] and Israeli positions in al-Zaffatah. 
Resistance men fired at the sources. 
  Israeli aircraft reconnoitered the region up to east Sidon 
and al-Nabatiyah, breaking the sound barrier. Israeli warplanes 
flew low over western al-Biqa' at about 1100, again breaking the 
sound barrier over al-Nabatiyah. 
  The resistance men this morning attacked an SLA position in 
Sujud with rockets and mortar and clashes ensued in which all 
types of weapons were used. 
  At 1350 today, Israeli warplanes raided the Iqlim al-Tuffah 
heights, concentrating on al-Luwayzah, for the second time today. 
  Just in from the south, Israeli military aircraft are flying 
low over the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights and Lebanese Army ground 
anti- aircraft guns are confronting them. The resistance fired 
surface- to-air Strella missiles at the Israeli aircraft, 
causing panic in the region and making the people believe the 
Israeli aircraft had launched a new raid.
