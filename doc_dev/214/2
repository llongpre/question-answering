   Veterans of the pioneering
X-15 program gathered to swap ``Right Stuff'' tales about
edge-of-space flight before the breakthroughs of space shots and
space shuttles.
   Three decades ago the rocket-powered X-15 ``spaceplane'' first
soared 67 miles over the desert and helped usher in a new era in
aeronautics. Fifty miles above Earth was considered the edge of
space, earning coveted astronaut wings for Air Force fliers in the
X-15 program.
   The three X-15 hypersonic research aircraft flew 199 flights in
one of the most successful aeronautical programs ever conducted.
   Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, was among
the dozen or so military and civilian test pilots who flew the X-15
during the program operated jointly by the Air Force, Navy and
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The pilots recalled their adventures Thursday at a reunion
honoring them.
   ``This is kind of our last hurrah,'' said Milt Thompson, 63, an
X-15 veteran.
   Others attending included Scott Crossfield, whose exploits were
chronicled in Tom Wolfe's saga of the Space Age, ``The Right
Stuff,'' and retired Air Force Col. Pete Knight who went on to
become mayor of the nearby desert community of Palmdale.
   Another was Joe Engle, the only X-15 pilot to go on to command a
space shuttle. He made 16 X-15 flights and two orbital missions in
the shuttle.
   ``I like being around pilots,'' Engle said in a telephone
interview on Thursday night.
   ``When I grow up, I'm going to be one,'' he quipped.
   He said his experiences in the X-15 were among the most
professionally rewarding of a high-flying career.
   ``Every time you flew the X-15, you knew you were logging data
for designs (of aircraft and spacecraft) that hadn't even been
thought of yet,'' he said.
   The wicked-looking black needle-nosed rocket plane would arc
across the sky so quickly that the pilot feared he was aiming
straight for the Pacific Ocean, said Thompson, now chief engineer
for NASA at the Ames-Dryden Research Facility.
   ``That was the geometry of it,'' he said. ``It was just flying
that fast.''
   The first X-15 flight was on June 8, 1959 and the final flight on
Oct. 24, 1968, a $300 million program that was the last in a
venerable line of research rocket planes. Chuck Yeager broke the
sound barrier in 1947 in the Bell X-1 that he dubbed ``Glamorous
Glennis'' in honor of his wife.
   After flying the X-15, Thompson said he moved away from flight
test ``because everything was winding down.'' There would not be
another research plane as rewarding to pilot, he lamented.
   A total of three X-15 rocket planes were built and one was
destroyed in an accident in 1967. Air Force Maj. Michael Adams died
in that crash when the X-15 broke up while diving from an altitude
of 265,000 feet
   The original design goal for the X-15 was 4,000 mph, but the
aircraft eventually flew at more than six times the speed of sound,
which is 760 mph. In addition to reaching a maximum 4,520 mph, it
soared to 345,200 feet.
   The flights allowed researchers to perform many experiments on a
repeated basis that aided in developing space technology. The
capabilities and limitations of the human pilot in flying space
trajectories and re-entry maneuvers and conditions were thoroughly
explored.
   The success of the X-15 design, development and flight program
allowed the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo spaceflight programs to
accelerate.
   ``When it became clear that the Space Age was upon us and the
need to put a human into Earth orbit became a matter of national
urgency, a massive backlog of aerospace technology was already at
hand in the X-15 program,'' said John V. Becker of NASA's Langley
Research Center in Hampton, Va.
   Years later, the space shuttle's landing characteristics would be
designed to emulate the X-15.
