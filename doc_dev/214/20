   A fighter plane that combines long-range
supersonic cruise capability with a greatly enhanced ability to
dogfight at and above the speed of sound has long been an elusive
dream of aircraft designers.
   After 5{ years of research the solution to that engineering
enigma may be near at NASA's Langley Research Center, where
aeronautical visionaries believe they have seen the future in
something called the ``vortex flap.''
   The flap, with a distinctive, sharp downward angle, is designed
to improve the agility of swept-wing jets. Highly swept wings
assure the speed needed for sustained supersonic flight, but
unswept wings are preferable for the lift necessary for combat
maneuvers and short takeoffs and landings.
   The vortex flap ``would give you the best of both worlds,'' said
Ronald H. Smith, a 30-year veteran of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration who is flight project engineer for the vortex
flap experiment.
   The acute deflection of the wing's leading edge purposely
detaches the airflow over the wing and forms a tornado-like vortex
on the flap. This creates a suction that reduces drag _ the force
that resists an object's movement through the air _ during
high-speed maneuvering.
   ``This is a way to allow swept-wing airplanes to maneuver
better,'' said Smith, who has worked on X-15 rocket planes, the
YF-12 interceptor from which the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance
plane was derived, and the FA-18 fighter.
   With the vortex flap, maneuverability would be significantly
increased at speeds of .8 to 1.2 Mach, where most dogfighting is
done, he said. Flight tests with a delta-wing F-106B test aircraft,
have found the greatest reduction of drag _ 20 percent to 30
percent _ at .9 Mach.
   With reduced drag, a plane would need less thrust. The payoff
would be a smaller, lighter engine and a plane that could faster
and farther on less fuel. Such planes would not require
afterburners needed by today's fighters to reach and maintain
supersonic flight, but which guzzle fuel.
   ``Fighters today concentrate on maneuvering,'' Smith said.
``They are not aerodynamically efficient in supersonic speeds and
don't have appreciable supersonic endurance.''
   He said the vortex flap could be used on the Navy's F-14 fighter
and the Air Force's F-111 and B-1 bombers, which have wings that
can be swept back. It could not be used on the more conventional
F-15, F-16 and FA-18 fighters.
   Another application would be on swept-wing supersonic transports
like the French-British Concorde or the American SST project that
was canceled in 1971 because of its cost and noise, Smith said.
That ``isn't our main focus but it would benefit from our research.
The vortex flap would translate into noise reduction'' because of
smaller engines and lack of afterburners, he said.
   NASA research pilot Philip W. Brown said the first flight of the
F-106B with the vortex flap last Aug. 2 was about what he expected.
   ``I was thinking it probably would be reasonably well-behaved
because we had done high-speed taxi tests. It turned out it was
better than predicted. The simulator was a lot harder to fly,''
said Brown, a former Navy fighter pilot.
   Some flight stability was lost by adding the flap to the F-106B,
a 1960s vintage fighter, but the plane is only slightly more
demanding to fly than without the flap, he said.
   Flight testing will continue for another 1{ years. It follows
five years of study encompassing nearly 3,000 hours of wind tunnel
tests.
   A fighter with supersonic endurance and transsonic maneuvering
ability would have a clear edge, said NASA engineer James B.
Hallissy, the principal investigator of the flap. ``It would be
able to get to a target faster and the enemy would have less
response time...
   ``If you can fly faster than the other guy, you can catch him if
he's running from you, and he can't catch you. The more speed you
can sustain the better off you are.''
