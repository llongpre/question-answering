   Britain's Prince Andrew waved to
his wife, Sarah, as he streaked overhead in a jet catapulted from
the deck of the aircraft carrier Nimitz on Thursday during a tour
off the California coast.
   The airshow was a highlight of the day at sea for the Duke and
Duchess of York, both pilots, who also inspected one of the
catapults and the massive chains that hold the ship's two
60,000-pound anchors.
   ``This is one of the loneliest walks I've ever done,'' the
prince said moments before he boarded the S-3A Viking
anti-submarine warfare jet while Sarah remained on deck.
   As the engines screamed, an apprehensive duchess, wearing a
flight helmet, clutched a gift teddy bear and watched the jet
hurled off the bow.
   The jet wheeled back for a low fly-by and husband and wife waved
to each other before the pregnant duchess boarded a helicopter for
a flight to Long Beach, where the royal yacht Britannia is docked.
   The couple _ the duchess sporting a USS Nimitz baseball cap _
had arrived aboard a Navy helicopter. It landed on the carrier 60
miles west of Los Angeles as a loudspeaker announced: ``Duke of
York arriving.''
   The duke, a helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy who saw action in
Britain's Falkland Islands war with Argentina, saluted Vice Admiral
John H. Fetterman Jr., commander of Naval Air Forces in the Pacific.
   Trailing Andrew was the duchess, in a blue dress and white coat
with navy blue trim.
   The couple were presented leather flight jackets bearing the
inscriptions ``Duke of York'' and ``Duchess of York,'' then sat
down to watch an air show from the main deck of the nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier.
   Dramatic moisture blasts, an aircraft-enveloping fog caused as a
jet breaks the sound barrier, brought a wide-eyed reaction from the
duchess.
   Helicopters demonstrated anti-submarine warfare techniques and
supersonic jets made frequent fly-bys.
   Jet after jet touched down on the deck at 160 mph, catching one
of four cable arresters on the carrier's stern and stretching them
150 yards before coming to a halt. The planes then folded their
wings and taxied to catapults.
   Fetterman narrated for the duchess while the duke engaged in
spirited conversation with the ship's skipper, Capt. Brent Bennitt.
   All then went below for lunch. The menu included cream of
asparagus soup, marinated mushrooms, Melba toast with grilled
Parmesan cheese, chicken salad on a tomato wedge, cherries jubilee,
mineral water and iced tea.
   ``Spam? No Spam,'' Lt. Tim O'Leary, the ship's spokesman, said
in response to reporters' queries.
   The couple, touring Southern California to promote British
trade, started the day with a visit hosted by the International
Foundation for Learning Disabilities at Park Century School in Los
Angeles.
   British actress Joan Collins, a supporter of the charity, was on
hand for the visit.
   The duke and duchess arrived in Los Angeles last Friday and
depart Sunday.
