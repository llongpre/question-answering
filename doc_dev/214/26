   A company used a videotaped appeal from
famed test pilot Chuck Yeager and the promise that profits from its
sales would fund a veterans park to lure investors into losing
$800,000 in a fake medallion scam, prosecutors said.
   The 37-count federal indictment, issued last week and unsealed
Monday, names seven individuals and two companies, Can-Am Mint and
Trading Ltd., which had offices in Bloomington and Eden Prairie,
and Vets for Vets Inc., which was incorporated in South Dakota but
shared offices with Can-Am.
   ``Many of these victims are very elderly people and a number
have lost members of their families in Vietnam,'' said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Joan Ericksen. ``They are an extremely vulnerable
group of victims.''
   Among the victims, one elderly North Dakota man sent in $81,000
and received nothing in return, Ericksen said. In all, she said,
about 45 investors from as far away as California, North Carolina
and Texas were involved.
   The indictment alleges that since March 1986 the defendants
tried to induce veterans and other investors to buy 3-ounce silver
commemorative medallions for $99 each, and promised that the
medallions would increase in value by 12 percent in a year. Only a
few of the investors received the medallions, Ericksen said.
   The investors were assured that half the profits would be used
by Vets for Vets to fund a veterans park near Mount Rushmore in
South Dakota's Black Hills, according to the indictment.
   The defendants allegedly told investors that 70 acres had been
donated for the park and that groundbreaking would take place on
Memorial Day 1987, according to the indictment. The government
claims that no land was donated or bought for the park and no park
had been built.
   Yeager, a retired Air Force general and the first pilot to break
the sound barrier, withdrew from the project after a short time,
Ericksen said.
   ``It sounds like a really good idea,'' she said. ``You sell
these medallions, build a park in South Dakota, honor these
veterans _ I can see why his agent would be interested in this.''
   ``Obviously, shortly after he got involved with these folks he
figured out what was up and he withdrew his support,'' she said. He
got involved because ``he was simply lied to,'' she said.
   A woman answering the telephone in Yeager's office in Grass
Valley, Calif., said he was out of town and not available for
comment.
   A telephone call to the Can-Am Mint and Trading Ltd. office was
answered by a recording saying the number had been temporarily
disconnected at the customer's request. A call placed to the number
given for Vets for Vets did not go through.
   ``It looked legitimate,'' said Pete Ellingson of Inver Grove
Heights, who said he agreed to buy 10 medallions at more than $80
each after doing some videotape editing and duplicating for one of
the defendants' companies.
   ``Their offices had the fanciest of furniture, the biggest of
layouts,'' he said. ``They kept calling me back and saying, `Pete,
you're going to miss the market. ... These things are really
soaring.'''
   Charged with numerous mail fraud counts are Michael J. Crosby,
39, who is in custody in California on unrelated fraud charges;
James A. Sannes, 43, of St. Paul; Jack P. Cunningham, 52, of
Burnsville; Tamara M. Kesler, 24, of Burnsville; Dale V. Peterson,
39, of Stacy; Martin L. Cheatham, 40, formerly of St. Paul; and
Phillip P. Krzyzaniak, of Irvine, Calif.
   The indictment says Crosby was the president of Can-Am, Kesler
was the company's director of administration and Sannes was
president of Vets for Vets.
   Kesler, Cunningham and Peterson appeared last Friday before a
federal magistrate and were freed after each posting 5 percent of
$50,000 bail. Ericksen said she will ask that Crosby be transferred
from California to Minnesota.
   The three remaining defendants were not in custody as of Monday,
according to federal officials.
