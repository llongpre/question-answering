   Clarence L. ``Kelly'' Johnson, creator of
Lockheed Corp.'s secret ``Skunk Works'' that created America's
first production jet fighter and a generation of spyplanes, died
Friday. He was 80.
   Johnson, who led the design of the U-2, the SR-71 Blackbird and
more than 40 other airplanes and spacecraft, died at St. Joseph
Medical Center in Burbank after a long illness, Lockheed said. The
illness was not disclosed.
   Using titanium and sleek shapes, Johnson's designs broke the
``thermal thicket,'' the high-heat problem of supersonic flight,
said Donald Lopez, a senior advisor at the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington, D.C.
   Use of titanium alloy on the SR-71 rather than standard aluminum
made flight at high speed possible despite 800-degree Fahrenheit
temperatures. The Blackbird flies at more than 2,000 mph and above
85,000 feet.
   ``The skin would glow sometimes,'' Lopez said of the Blackbirds,
recently retired by the Air Force. ``Pilots could feel the heat
coming in.''
   Johnson organized the Skunk Works in Burbank in 1943 to build
the XP-80 Shooting Star, the United States' first production jet
fighter.
   Many designs bore his mark: the P-38 Lightning in World War II,
the Constellation transports, the Hercules cargo planes, the P2V
antisubmarine patrol aircraft, the Agena spacecraft, and the F-104
Starfighter, the first production aircraft to fly at twice the
speed of sound.
   The U-2 was the first plane able to make a sustained flight
above 60,000 feet, and the YF-12 and SR-71 Blackbird remain the
fastest and highest-flying planes in the world. The Blackbird's
maximum speed and altitude remain classified.
   The Air and Space Museum saluted Johnson in its gallery of
pioneers.
   Born in Ishpeming, Mich., on Feb. 27, 1910, Johnson was the
seventh of nine children of Swedish immigrant parents. From his
father, a carpenter and bricklayer, Johnson developed a respect for
tools. According to Lockheed, he knew by the time he was 12 that he
wanted to build airplanes.
   He studied aeronautical engineering at the University of
Michigan, and worked as a consultant on the aerodynamic design of
cars that were to run in the Indianapolis 500.
   He went to work for Lockheed the same year he received his
master's degree, 1933. He went on to head the Skunk Works for 30
years.
   The secrecy of the Skunk Works is so great that even the origin
of the name is shrouded in mystery, although it apparently was
derived from Al Capp's cartoon strip, ``Li'l Abner,'' which
featured a moonshine distillery called the Skonk Works.
   Johnson retired as a senior vice president in 1975 and retired
from Lockheed's board of directors in 1980.
   Tony LeVier, the Skunk Works' former chief test pilot, described
Johnson as a stern father figure with a direct line to the
Pentagon.
   And his planes, LeVier said, ``flew like a dream.''
   ``My God,'' he said. ``They were advanced.''
   Johnson is survived by his wife Nancy, a brother and a sister.
