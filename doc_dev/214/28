<LEADPARA>  Q  I am replacing the fence on two sides of my property. The neighbor on one
side has agreed to pay half the cost of the fence we share. The second
neighbor is a renter, and the property owner is not responding to any pleas to
pick up half of the cost. Since he refused to respond, I picked out the fence
and paid the full amount. Legally, is the landlord (home owner) responsible to
pay half of the fence we share?;    -- E.G., San Jose  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  A  It's a civil matter and the answer to your question must come from a judge.
We talked to Tony La Russa, a supervisor in the city of San Jose code
compliance division. La Russa says normally friendly neighbors pick up the
cost of replacing a common fence. But when one runs across a neighbor who
refuses to cooperate, many homeowners turn to small claims court for a
decision on financial responsibility. Small claims court is at 1675 Lincoln
St., Santa Clara 95050. The court's information recording number is (408)
246-0510. Their office phone number is (408) 246-0511. We're sending you the
informational sheet we have on small claims court procedures.;  Send it air
mail;  Q  Could you get me the mailing address for Charles "Chuck" Yeager, who
I believe lives in Grass Valley?;    -- Gwen Potter, Mountain View; A  You can
write Yeager in care of the companies with which he's associated. The historic
pilot who broke the sound barrier can be contacted in care of David Dempsey at
Electronic Arts, 1820 Gateway Drive, San Mateo 94404-2497. That's the company
that produces Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer and Chuck Yeager's Air
Combat, both of which are computerized flight simulators meant for IBM
computers. Or you can write Yeager in care of Bantam Books, which published
his 1988 biography "Press On!" -- co-written with Charles Leerhsen. Bantam
Books is at 666 Fifth Ave., New York 10103. In general, celebrities' home
addresses are unavailable, so you'll have better luck writing them in care of
their book publishers, album companies, movie production companies or other
businesses which which they're associated. In Yeager's case, that list would
include any of the many products he endorses.;  Staff stumbled on refund;  Q 
On April 18, I purchased a cane from Crest Medical on Hamilton Avenue for my
elderly aunt. She was unable to use the cane, so I called April 22 to ask if I
could return it for a refund. I was told yes. When I returned the cane,
someone took my receipt and told me I would receive a refund in the mail from
the headquarters in a few days. On May 6, I called Crest Medical regarding the
refund. Someone said they'd call me back but never did. On May 17 I again
called and was referred to the business office in Rancho Cordova. I called
there and was promised someone would get back to me on three different
occasions. I still haven't heard from anyone. I paid $27.55 for the cane.;   
-- Carol Laughlin, San Jose; A  Ruth Ann Terramella, branch manager for Crest
Medical, says her staff bungled the incident. Terramella says any refunds
under $50 can be made by the local office, and the check doesn't have to come
from headquarters. She is having a check rushed out to you immediately along
with her apologies. Terramella also says she will conduct a training session
with her staff to make sure they are aware of policies.  </TEXT>
