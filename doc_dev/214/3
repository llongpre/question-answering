   Capt. Jacquelyn S. Parker
is the Air Force's first woman test pilot, and the 28-year-old flier
has her eye on the space shuttle.
   ``The work and the flying was as hard and challenging as everyone
said it would be,'' Parker said. ``Now, I'm looking forward to
putting it to use testing airplanes and hopefully, someday, fly the
space shuttle.''
   Parker was one of 25 navigators, pilots and flight engineers who
graduated last weekend from the Air Force Test Pilot School, which
runs a rigorous program to train personnel to test experimental,
research and prototype aircraft.
   The test pilot school is located about 60 miles north of Los
Angeles at the Mojave Desert air base where the space shuttle lands
and where Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier in the Bell X-1
in 1947.
   Parker, of Wilmington, Del., goes to the 4950th Test Group,
Aeronautical Systems Division, based at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base in Ohio.
   ``You can erase my name, along with many others who were in the
class, and there's very little difference in our backgrounds,'' she
said. ``Women now are getting the experience and education they need
to get into the more exciting programs and I believe we have a lot
to offer these programs.''
   Parker served as a C-141 transport aircraft pilot with the 76th
Military Airlift Squadron based at Charleston Air Force Base, S.C.,
before entering the Test Pilot School in July 1988.
   She entered the Air Force in 1980 after working at NASA's Johnson
Space Center in Houston.
