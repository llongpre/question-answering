   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Smelling salts and artificial intelligence are
just a couple of things researchers are willing to try in an
attempt to stem blackouts among military pilots traveling faster
than sound.

   While the nation's military jet fighter
pilots have been breaking the sound barrier and evading supersonic
missiles, a deadly invader has crept into the cockpit.
   It strikes when they are at the top of their performance, maybe
in the middle of a dogfight, pulling turns that would make the
roughest roller coaster seem like a carriage ride in the park.
   Then they lose to GLOC (pronounced G-lock), gravity-induced loss
of consciousness.
   It begins as a pilot starts to feel the crushing weight from a
sharp turn, or maybe a dive. In a modern fighter such as the F-16,
maneuvers can lead to forces of 9 Gs, nine times the force of
gravity.
   The blood becomes so heavy the heart can't pump it; it drains
from the brain. Things go gray; the pilot may suffer tunnel vision.
Then black.
   ``It's almost always fatal,'' says Maj. Rocky Hill of the Air
Force Inspection and Safety Center at Norton Air Force Base, Calif.
   He says there have been at least 13 GLOC crashes since 1982, all
but one fatal.
   ``We got so smart on it so fast and started running people
through the centrifuge (for training), and we said this is a real
success story. But it never really goes away,'' Hill said during a
seminar on prevention at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.
   It becomes worse with a new generation of planes, the Air
Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter and the Navy's Advanced Tactical
Aircraft, planned for the next decade with more mind-numbing
capabilities.
   Pilots already are overloaded with computer screens, switches,
gauges and dials, and GLOC is just one more worry.
   ``The cockpit is becoming an increasingly hostile area to the
pilot,'' Hill says.
   Robert E. van Patten, leader of GLOC research at the Armstrong
Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson, says
Germans put meters in their Ju-88 dive bombers in World War II to
pull the plane out at low altitudes if the pilot lost consciousness.
   ``All in all, we aren't that far ahead,'' van Patten says.
   Hill says GLOC gained priority again about four years ago when
video cameras were put in cockpits. They captured pilots coming
close to GLOC.
   Susceptible pilots usually have many hours of flying time, but
relatively few hours in very-high performance aircraft. They tend
to be middle-aged and have had little training on the centrifuge,
Hill says.
   ``These profiles very accurately describe our Air Force Reserve
and Air National Guard units that have converted to the F-16,''
Hill says.
   Fatigue also is a big factor, researchers say, which could pose
problems for a pilot flying multiple missions in wartime.
   Beginning in August, the Air Force plans to train about 2,500
pilots per year _ fledglings and veterans _ on a new centrifuge at
Holloman Air Force Base, N.M.
   Part of the training involves exercises that push the blood back
up.
   So does the G-suit, a corset-like garment inflated to keep blood
from pooling in the legs. Soon to come is positive-pressure
breathing that forces air into the lungs and forces a pilot to
exhale.
   But even if a pilot does recover from GLOC, it can take up to
two minutes to regain his bearings. So scientists are looking at
ways to tell the airplane's computer that the pilot is unconscious
so the plane can briefly fly itself to safety.
   McDonnell Aircraft Co. says it is near a system that keys on a
pilot's breathing and voice patterns, combined with a computer
memory of recent sharp maneuvers in the plane, to tell when a pilot
is at GLOC risk.
   Van Patten's group is trying more complicated sensors, possibly
in helmets, that would measure head slump, eye blink, blood
pressure, pulse in head arteries and even the grip on the stick.
Those researchers want to use more extensive artificial
intelligence, including neural networks _ computers based on the
architecture of the brain _ to make more accurate judgments.
   A pilot might someday put a computer disc with his own
characteristics on board to tell the computer how to program the
system exactly for him, van Patten says.
   To revive a pilot, researchers are studying ways to pulsate the
G-suit, administering small amounts of carbon dioxide which dilates
blood vessels and raises blood pressure.
   ``Perhaps even plain old smelling salts,'' says van
Patten.``They have a long and honorable history.''
   But most of all, a recent study shows, pilots want a system that
they won't have to attach each time they get into a cockpit and
that they can override if it starts to malfunction.
   Van Patten estimates a simple prototype system could be built
for $500,000, and could be ready to fly by 1993 with another $3
million. But in the current budget climate, he says, money is hard
to come by.
