   Above, below and on board doomed Delta
Air Lines Flight 1141, people realized something was terribly
wrong. They watched horrified as the plane skidded off a runway,
splintered, crashed and burned.
   Then they marveled that anyone survived the accident Wednesday
at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. The crash killed 13,
but at least 94 survived, authorities said.
   ``I saw it take off and I knew something was wrong,'' said Lon
Might, an airport employee.
   Passengers in a commuter plane arriving at the airport spotted
the Boeing 727 struggling to get airborne and shouted encouragement
to the pilot.
   ``We were cheering this guy to get the plane off the ground,''
said Gene Metzig. ``It was very emotional.''
   Said Michelle Christensen, 25, a Dallas real estate agent aboard
Flight 1141: ``The minute we took off the ground I knew we were
going to crash.''
   From an office building, Edward Leb looked out and noticed the
aircraft was not flying in a normal position, that it was almost
level with the ground and its nose barely was up.
   ``And then it just fell straight down. It fell like a pancake on
its big belly, the back end lower than the front end,'' Leb said.
   At an airport toll booth, Mary Centron, 47, of Hurst, who
witnessed a Delta Air Lines crash here three years ago, knew at
once the plane was flying ``too damn low to be taking off.''
   Sobbing, nauseated and recalling the previous tragedy, in which
137 died, she said: ``The tail disappeared first, and next the nose
disappeared behind a hill, and then there was a humongous fireball.
... I didn't think anybody had made it.''
   Aboard the craft, en route from Jackson, Miss., to Salt Lake
City via Dallas, passenger Peter Wright heard a ``banging noise''
under the carriage and then someone exclaim: ``We're not going to
make it!''
   Within moments of its 9 a.m. takeoff, Flight 1141 dropped like a
wounded bird from the cloudless sky, skidded off the runway,
bounced into a field of waist-high prairie grass and broke apart in
flames, smoke and debris.
   The crash ripped off one wing and two engines, tore three gaping
holes in the fuselage and left the crippled aircraft with its tail
dangling and its nose twisted grotesquely to one side.
   ``It looks like a beached and dying bottlenosed dolphin,'' said
a photographer. Others said it resembled a giant, stricken goose.
   No one could say with certainty what happened, only that the
death toll could have been staggering. Authorities indicated most
of the deaths were caused by burns and smoke inhalation and that
most of the injuries were cuts, scrapes and bruises.
   ``We feel lucky there were only 13 victims,'' said Dr. Nizam
Peerwani, the Tarrant County medical examiner. ``Initially we were
told there would be 60 bodies, so we were prepared for the worst.''
   Jim Hartman, Department of Public Safety officer at the airport,
called it ``incredible'' that so many survived. In fact, early
reports from the control tower indicated the crash was
``non-survivable.''
   Said Norman Newcity, 36, a Georgia businessman hospitalized with
a broken heel: ``It was just like a roller coaster ride with
everything coming apart, everything flying apart.''
   ``We were going down the runway and the sound of the engine
changed,'' said Melissa Lewis, 24, a graduate student at
Mississippi State University. ``There was a different sound.''
   Other passengers said they heard knocking noises or popping
sounds or loud thumps, and Dale Patterson, 36, of Plano, thought it
``sounded like it blew a tire.''
   But Dan Walker, a 40-year-old Dallas veterinarian, said, ``There
was no audible explosion before the crash.'' He said the plane did
encounter ``turbulence'' before it veered out of control and
insisted that the pilot did an excellent job of ``bringing it down
on its belly.''
   Walker suffered a fractured rib but was treated and released.
Two Dallas-area friends with him on a planned fishing excursion to
Montana were hospitalized with more serious injuries.
   Austin attorney Rick Arnett, seated in a plane on the ground,
said he and other passengers saw the wobbly Delta jetliner through
their windows and were hollering: ``Get up! Get up!''
   But it was not to be.
