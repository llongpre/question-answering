   In this tank you'll see pygmy sharks. In
there are walleyed perch. And in this tank you'll find a
gap-toothed talk show host. Yikes! Is that really David Letterman
underwater?
   The late-night comedian is considering taping a segment of his
television show at the Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, but the tourist
attraction isn't sure it can accommodate Letterman's request.
   ``My impression is they want to film a show underwater,'' said
aquarium spokesman George Donnelly. ``We would love to try to do
something about it. But we don't know if we can work out the
logistics of it.''
   Donnelly said representatives for the show called the non-profit
aquarium three weeks ago to ask about filming among the fishtanks.
   ``To be honest with you, I thought it was a crank call,'' said
Donnelly, who said he occasionally watches ``Late Night with David
Letterman'' on NBC.
   Donnelly said two writers inspected the aquarium with the
intention of filming in November or December, but that he hasn't
heard anything else. He said other aquariums also were being looked
at.

   The rock group 10,000 Maniacs, which got
its start in this community 75 miles south of Buffalo, said thanks
to the city with a golden touch.
   The band presented Mayor Steven Carlson with a gold record
symbolizing 500,000 copies sold of their album ``In My Tribe.''
   ``We're thrilled with the publicity you've given Jamestown,''
Carlson said at the Tuesday ceremony.
   Noting that the area is already known as the home of actress
Lucille Ball and the birthplace of renowned bird researcher Roger
Tory Peterson, Carlson said Jamestown might soon be known as ``the
home of the 10,000 Maniacs.''
   ``It's great,'' said the band's keyboardist, Dennis Drew. ``I
never did anything like this. I feel good that we can say thank
you.''

   Saying, ``I don't support cop killers,''
singer Willie Nelson expressed disappointment in a decision by
Austin police not to provide security for a benefit concert next
month.
   Helping Our Brother Out, or HOBO, an organization planning the
Nov. 11 concert in Austin, lined up Ranger security after the
Austin Police Association voted two weeks ago not to provide it,
said HOBO spokeswoman Marion Morris.
   Police officers protested Nelson's participation in a concert
last year to raise defense money for American Indian activist
Leonard Peltier, serving two life sentences for the 1975 murder of
two FBI agents.
   Nelson said in a phone interview he performed at the Peltier
benefit ``not to get this man out of prison but to get money for
lawyers'' who could bring to light withheld information about the
case.
   ``I don't support cop killers. I don't support Indian killers. I
don't support any kind of killers. I just believe this particular
issue of Leonard Peltier, there's more than meets the eye,'' Nelson
said.
   HOBO on Wednesday received a donation of $10,000 from Provident
Development Co. of Austin for concert expenses. HOBO is a
non-profit organization supported by churches and businesses that
works to improve the plight of Austin's homeless.

   The first man to break the sound barrier,
retired Air Force Gen. Chuck Yeager, says he was duped into
promoting a theme park for military veterans that was to be built
in western South Dakota.
   Dressed in cowboy boots, jeans and a windbreaker, Yeager
testified Wednesday in U.S. District Court at the trial of four men
accused of bilking investors and creditors out of more than
$800,000.
   Yeager, 65, who flew faster than the speed of sound in 1947 and
who continues to work as a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in
California, said after testifying, ``When some guy uses you, it
ticks you off.''
   Yeager said he was asked in 1986 by defendant Michael Crosby to
film a commercial promoting the veterans park. The money for the
park was to have been raised through the sale of commemorative
medallions and contributions.
   Officials at Can-Am Mint and Trading Ltd. said they would sell 1
million commemorative coins that were guaranteed to appreciate in
value, but they sold about 5,900 coins for between $80 and $99 to
412 investors. The investors claim they never received the coins.

   The Duchess of York, under attack by
newspapers back home over her absence from her 2-month-old
daughter, sailed into Port Adelaide on Thursday to be reunited with
her husband.
   Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, arrived on the guided-missile
destroyer HMS Edinburgh while, his wife, the former Sarah Ferguson,
arrived on the British supply ship Olwen.
   About 100 anti-nuclear demonstrators and pro-IRA protesters
jostled and shouted slogans at the royal couple, who have been
apart since they concluded an official 10-day bicentennial tour of
Australia on Oct. 7
   The duchess has been criticized by the British media for
delaying her departure home by two weeks. Princess Beatrice, the
couple's first child, was born Aug. 8.
   The duke and duchess will not be attending any official
functions during their four-day stay in Adelaide.

   A candidate's attempt to raise money
and publicity in a state Senate race by having retired Lt. Col
Oliver L. North speak at a dinner may wind up costing the candidate
$4,000.
   Republican Joseph F. Roberts had hoped North's speech here
Thursday night would help him in his fight to unseat Democratic
state Sen. John B. Larson.
   ``It's going to be the most expensive plate dinner I've ever
gone to,'' said Roberts, owner of Roberts Farm and Country Store.
   North's speaking fee is $25,000 and Roberts also had to pay for
the banquet hall and other expenses. He said he had expected as
many as 300 people to buy tickets at $175 apiece. But only 140
tickets had been sold by late Wednesday.
   Although Roberts guessed it would cost him $4,000 from his
pocket, he said doesn't regret the idea because it helps identify
him and supports North's legal fight.
   North and three others are charged with conspiracy to divert
proceeds of U.S. arms sales to Iran for aid for the Nicaraguan
Contras at a time when Congress banned U.S. military aid to the
rebels.
