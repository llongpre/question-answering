<HEAD>Republicans Hire Chuck Yeager For Political Ads</HEAD>

   The Republican presidential campaign
has pulled out heavy artillery in the form of retired U.S. Air
Force Gen. Chuck Yeager to warn Texans that ``liberal Democrats''
will take away jobs from the state's defense industry.
   In a television advertisement airing this week in Texas, Yeager
warns that the 300,000 Texas jobs related to the defense industry
could be jeopardized by Democrats who advocate cuts in defense
spending.
   But Yeager, the first man to break the sound barrier, has worked
for the past six years as a consultant to Northrop Corp. of
California, a competitor of General Dynamics Corp. The Fort Worth
Division of General Dynamics is one of the largest defense
employers in the state, with 27,000 workers.
   Republican National Committee spokesman Kathryn Murray said she
wasn't aware that Yeager was a consultant to Northrop but that it
was irrelevant.
   ``The point of the ad is that General Yeager has first-hand
knowledge of what it takes to have a strong defense and he believes
the policies of the Republicans are more in sync with making that
happen,'' she said. ``He speaks from the heart about the defense of
the nation.''
