  [Text] About forty years ago, an ingenious contraption 
nicknamed ``the flying bedstead'' took to the air at a Rolls 
Royce test facility in the United Kingdom. The name was an apt 
description of an ungainly flying machine heralded as a 
breakthrough in aviation. What made the craft unusual was that 
it could take off and land vertically using downward-facing jet 
nozzles at its four corners. Once aloft, the nozzles could 
rotate to propel it forward. 
  The flying bedstead was the prototype for vertical takeoff 
and landing (VTOL) jet aircraft. The appeal of VTOLs was that 
they would not need runways; theoretically, they could take off 
and land in city centers but fly like conventional jets once 
airborne, carrying the same loads at the same speeds. 



  Over the next 20 years, about thirty different VTOL designs 
were developed and tested. Some used jet engines, while others 
used rotors that could swivel from a horizontal position for 
lift to the vertical for flight. Nearly all the test flights 
ended in disaster. Only one design found practical use--the 
Harrier jump-jet fighter used by the Royal Air Force and the 
U.S. Navy. 
  Not surprisingly, most VTOLs came to grief at takeoff or 
landing, the moments of greatest risk for any aircraft. In a 
normal jet aircraft, aerodynamic lift provided by the wings 
gives a degree of stability as a plane takes off or cruises to 
land. In a VTOL, this type of lift is nonexistent: only the 
vertical thrust from the jets keeps the plane aloft and at the 
correct attitude. The problems lie largely in finely controlling 
the blasts from the downward-facing jets. Even slight gusts of 
wind or variations in thrust from the engines could unbalance 
the craft as it sat on ``pillars'' of air. When this happened, 
the pilot had only seconds to restore the jet's equilibrium 
before crashing. 
  Technological strides over the last two decades have changed 
the outlook for VTOLs, which now might begin to fulfill their 
original promise and meet modern safety standards for civil 
aviation. VTOLs are being reexamined in several countries, 
including several European nations and the United States. In 
Japan, a revolutionary VTOL design from the National Aerospace 
Laboratory (NAL) is now ready for implementation. 
  Progress in three key areas of technology has given VTOLs 
their second chance, according to Dr. Masanori Endoh, who leads 
the NAL team. ``Microelectronics now allow us to incorporate 
very sophisticatedcontrols into the designs, something that 
wasn't possible until recently,'' he explained. ``The 
development of very lightweight composite materials also helps. 
Since a VTOL takes off using engine thrust and not aerodynamic 
wing lift, it is essential for the plane to be as light as 
possible.'' The kinds of materials he is referring to include 
both lightweight, carbon-reinforced plastics and new types of 
ceramics. 
  The third advance is the development of new kinds of 
engines. 
``VTOLs of the fifties were extremely noisy,'' says Dr. Endoh. 
``This alone would be a fatal defect today, because no one would 
tolerate such noisy jets at civilian airports, let alone in city 
centers.'' Dr. Endoh's team has designed a new engine that is 
high-powered, lightweight, and creates no more noise than a 
light helicopter. The new engine is the key innovation in NAL's 
new VTOL design. 
  The aircraft would fly using a unique system of lift and 
cruise fans powered by a trio of rear-mounted jet turbines. 
High-pressure air from these three engines would be piped to 
twin seven-foot cruise fans. At the center of each fan, a 
combustor would ignite a mixture of high-pressure air and fuel. 
The expanding gases would spin a turbine linked to the fan, 
producing 24,000 pounds of thrust a side. 
  During vertical takeoff and landing, high-pressure air would 
be channeled to three eight-foot, 200-blade, one-piece rotors 
that are encased within each wing and shielded by movable 
shutters. Collectively, the six rotors, with their own 
combustors, would generate over 130,000 pounds of thrust. 
  Surprisingly, the lift fans are not noisy. ``Because of 
their 
size their rotation speed is very low, which reduces the 
noise,'' says Endoh. ``The one-piece design also means that the 
sound the fans produce is higher-pitched than in regular rotors, 
where the blades are individually fitted. Our aircraft will be 
quieter than a conventional helicopter!'' 
  As the craft rises, the pilot gradually redirects the 
high-pressure air from the lift to the cruise fans, 
simultaneously closing the shutters in the wings. This increases 
the wings' effective surface area, boosting the aerodynamic 
lift. Should one or more of the lift fans cease working, the 
plane should remain stable as long as at least one fan on each 
side functions. Should all fail, the plane can still land on a 
runway like a conventional airliner. 
  NAL's aircraft isn't on the tarmac just yet. Engine tests 
are 
due this year, but the pace of progress will depend on new 
government funding. Computer simulations and wind-tunnel tests 
using models indicate the plane will fulfill the designer's 
expectations. In Dr. Endoh's most optimistic scenario, the first 
test flights could be taking place around the end of the decade, 
and commercial flights could start early in the next century. If 
all goes well, the new VTOL could then be ferrying over a 
hundred commuters a trip to and from city centers, taking off 
and landing at ``vertports'' no bigger than 200 square meters. 
  Dr. Endoh calculates ticket prices on his VTOL would be 
about 
30 percent higher than on a conventional airliner. He doesn't 
think this will prove a problem, since passengers will save the 
time and expense of lengthy journeys to out-of-town airports. 
``In the past, people have been willing to pay more for easier 
and swifter journeys. The extra cost of traveling by bullet 
train compared with regular trains has not deterred travelers, 
and I think the same will prove true for VTOLs,'' he explains. 
  For urban planners, the VTOL could also prove a boon. The 
small size of vertports makes them easy and inexpensive to 
build. Any city center tract of land, or even the space over 
rail tracks, could be utilized.New vertports could go from the 
planning stage to operational status within a year--very fast 
when compared with the decades it takes to plan and build 
costlier conventional airports. According to Dr. Endoh, VTOLs 
should be ready to put the problems of civil aviation to bed, 
about fifty years after that first flying bedstead took to the 
air.
