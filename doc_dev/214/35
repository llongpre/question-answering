sophisticated aircraft simulators are becoming more like the real thing

Flying conditions around Seattle were far from ideal on the last day of May.
The area was blanketed with snow and a strong wind was gusting as the pilot
lined up his Boeing 777 for a tricky landing at the aircraft maker's
airfield on the outskirts of the city.
The aircraft descended steadily towards the parallel beads of runway lights
blinking in the distance. But just before touchdown, green-grey patches of
ice became visible on the tarmac. Some of the aircraft's tyres failed to
grip the surface. The nose lurched from side to side as the pilot struggled
to bring the aircraft to an unsteady stop.
This story has some obvious flaws. The chances of finding snow in Seattle on
May 31 are almost zero. What is more, the twin-engined Boeing 777 has yet to
fly. Its maiden flight is expected to take place within the next few days,
with customer deliveries due to start only in May 1995. But Boeing's
test-pilots have been notching up flying hours on the 777 for the past six
months thanks to a simulator at CAE Electronics' factory in Montreal.
Without leaving the ground, the pilots have flown in and out of airports
around the world, experiencing the sights, sounds and turbulence of
snowstorms, thunderstorms, air pockets and almost every other flying
condition.
CAE Electronics, a division of CAE of Toronto, claims a 50 per cent share of
the world market for aircraft simulators, including 10 of the 13 orders
placed so far for Boeing 777 devices. The other three 777 orders have gone
to CAE's main rival, Rediffusion, a UK-based division of Thomson, the French
electronics group.
Like the aircraft they reproduce, simulators have grown increasingly
sophisticated. Pilots' experience on a simulator now helps decide which
systems and instruments are installed in a new aircraft. 'We fly our
simulators before Boeing flies its planes,' says Adrian Gale, CAE
Electronics' marketing director. 'We'll pick up bugs on an avionics sweep
before Boeing does.'
But the technological advances have one drawback: as the simulator
experience gets closer to the real thing, so does its price. One of CAE's
full-flight simulators currently costs about CDollars 15m (Pounds 7.2m) to
Dollars 20m.
As a result, airlines are turning to simplified versions, known as flight
training devices (FTDs). These recreate specific parts of an aircraft's
system without the frills and thrills of a real flight. For instance,
maintenance system trainers, comprising little more than two chairs, two
computer screens and a console, reproduce only those instruments needed for
engineers to diagnose an aircraft's inner workings from the cockpit.
Full-flight simulators, which look like windowless space capsules, do much
more than reproduce an aircraft's cockpit and instruments.
Hydraulically-powered struts which form the base of the simulator can propel
the bulbous module in six directions, including a pitch and roll of up to
30'.
Simulator makers go to extraordinary lengths to make flights on their
machines as close to the real thing as possible. One of CAE's helicopter
simulators is fitted with a shaking pilot's seat as well as the normal
banking, pitching and rolling mechanisms. By pumping air into cushions
behind and underneath a fighter pilot's seat, CAE mimics the G-forces felt
in steep climbs and tight turns. Take-offs and landings feature appropriate
real-time bumps and engine sounds.
The biggest advance in recent years, however, has been in the
computer-generated visual systems which project images of airports,
landmarks, scenery and weather conditions likely to be encountered during a
flight.
The latest version of CAE's Maxvue visual system, installed in the 777, has
five separate channels giving a total horizontal field of vision of 210' and
a vertical field of 40'. The pilot and co-pilot can thus see true-to-life
images out of all the cockpit windows. When taxiing, for instance, they can
see another aircraft approaching from the side. The vertical view allows
them to see slightly above and below the plane, which is especially useful
in banking manoeuvres. CAE has fitted its helicopter simulators with two
extra channels to give a straight-down view.
CAE has developed visual-system databases for almost 40 airports around the
world. Each one, taking up 5 gigabytes of disk storage, reproduces the
topography and landmarks within a 15-mile radius of the airport and, in much
greater detail, its runways and terminal buildings.
The database is compiled from digitised satellite and aerial photos and
maps. These are augmented with on-the-spot observations by the software
experts who design the system and suggestions from the pilots who will use
it. Few details have been forgotten. The wind sock at the end of the runway
in Hong Kong billows in the same direction as the wind registered on the
cockpit instruments. The rotors of a hovering helicopter churn up the sea
below.
But computer-generated scenery has its limitations. CAE has yet to master
three-dimensional imaging, and the sharpness of the pictures does not match
the human eye. Although the number of polygons (or shapes) which can be
fitted on each channel has jumped from 1,000 to about 5,500 in the past
three or four years, this is still not enough to cover every detail.
Customers thus have to make choices. The criterion, often a subjective one,
is what is of most importance to the pilot. As the Boeing 777 descends over
Seattle, the city's Space Needle tower and the main highways are clearly
visible from the cockpit. But there are no cars on the roads. The scene may
be surreal, but it is a comforting reminder that no matter how bad the
weather conditions outside, this flight will be landing safely.
