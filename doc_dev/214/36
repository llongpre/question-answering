   The pilot zoomed low between
the pink, craggy peaks of the Sheep Mountains, suddenly twisting
his F-16 Falcon vertically into the desert sky before diving on the
target, a railroad bridge.
   Capt. Kevin ``Omar'' Bradley's plane plunged toward the bridge
as he pushed his ``pickle'' button, simulating bombs away. Bradley
pointed the Falcon's nose up, climbed radically and turned,
eliciting groans from his reporter passenger as the ``Gs''
increased to seven times the force of gravity.
   The lean, 30-year-old pilot from Binghamton, N.Y., didn't seem
bothered. ``We have to do a lot of things to keep in condition,''
he said.
   Bradley pushed the fighter past Mach 1, through the sound
barrier, and with a sonic boom for salute, headed back toward the
Tactical Fighter Weapons Center at Nellis Air Force Base, known in
the Tactical Air Command as ``The Home of the Fighter Pilot.''
   Despite improved superpower relations, with hopes high for
general world peace, professional warriors are still working to
keep a combat edge. ``Gunsmoke'' a biennial competition, decides
the ``best of the best'' in Air Force precision gunnery and bombing.
   ``Peace is breaking out all over, so why maintain the edge?''
asked Maj. Gen. Billy McCoy, a 6-foot-4 Texan who flew 223 missions
in Vietnam and commands the fighter training center at Nellis.
   ``Every kid (competing in Gunsmoke) will tell you today that we
have always dickered best from a position of strength. ... We ought
to have a pair of Russian generals out here. I'd host 'em for the
whole two weeks,'' said McCoy.
   As Bradley soared away from the target area in his fighter, a
formation of A-10 Thunderbolt pilots from the Connecticut Air
National Guard swept by, completing bombing and strafing runs that
were part of the two-week shooting competition, which ends Saturday.
   The Connecticut fliers are joined by guard units from Terre
Haute, Ind., Sioux City, Iowa, and Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M.,
and by reserve units from Luke Air Force Base, Ariz., Grissom Air
Force Base, Ind., and Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas.
   They are competing against regular Air Force units from as far
away as Japan, Alaska, the Philippines and West Germany.
   The fliers at Nellis already have won competitions in their home
units and are vying to be ``Top Guns,'' an Air Force-wide honor
held for two years.
   Maj. Patrick Hoy of Falls City, Neb., who was ``Top Gun'' in his
A-10 Thunderbolt two years ago, said, ``I don't think any rational
individual would wish to be at war, but it can be difficult being a
warrior when peace is breaking out.
   ``The biggest problem the U.S. has to deal with when we are not
in conflict is complacency. ... If you have a garden and you leave
it for a few days, the weeds begin to grow.''
   During competition, Capt. Angus Simpson, an A-10 pilot from
Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, put all 200 rounds in the white
target panel sitting on the arid wasteland that is fighter pilot
heaven north of Las Vegas. It was the first such perfect score,
said Capt. Tom Christie, an Air Force spokesman.
   For Bradley, becoming a fighter pilot was a childhood dream
nurtured by an uncle who took him to air shows. He started flying
single-engine propeller planes when he was 17. Now, piloting the
super-sophisticated F-16 over the Sheep Mountains, he is at the top
end of the Air Force dream sheet.
   ``For me, there is nothing else,'' Bradley said. ``Everything
else is a zero. My family has a business. I had no aptitude
whatsoever for it. The only thing for me was flying.''
   The flier, nicknamed ``Omar'' for the World War II general,
faces the possibility he will never fire a shot in anger.
   ``The slogan for tactical aviation is `Readiness is our
profession,''' he said. ``The military needs to detach itself from
the emotions'' about hopes for relaxed tension between the
superpowers.
   Without the ordeal of combat to provide the ultimate warrior's
test, the fliers use competitions such as ``Gunsmoke,'' the biggest
of its kind, to maintain their adrenaline levels.
   ``Next to my marriage and the birth of my children, it was the
most exciting moment of my life to be able to sit back in a moment
of quiet reflection and realize that on that day, I was the best,''
Hoy said.
