   Navy Capt. Dick Richards,
Discovery's commander, is traveling into space for the second time
in a little more than a year.
   The former test pilot made his first shuttle flight August 1989
on a secret Defense Department mission.
   Richards, 44, said before the flight that he believed a
successful mission would help people forget about NASA's recent
troubles, which include hydrogen leaks aboard the Atlantis and
Columbia space shuttles.
   ``Right now, we don't look so good,'' he said.
   But he denied that NASA's recent misfortunes have put additional
pressure on his crew or the launch team at Cape Canaveral, Fla., to
get a space shuttle into orbit.
   ``They treat us like we're fragile commodities down there,'' he
said, adding he believes the space agency has been quite
conservative in handling mechanical problems in the post-Challenger
era.
   Richards was born in Key West, Fla., but grew up in St. Louis
where he graduated from Riverview Gardens High School. He earned a
bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of
Missouri and a master's degree in aeronautical systems from the
University of West Florida.
   After earning his bachelor's degree, he joined the Navy. He
became a naval aviator and later went to the U.S. Navy test pilot
school.
   Richards served as a project test pilot for development work on
automatic carrier landing systems for F-4 and A-7 aircraft.
   He was on his way to an assignment with a fighter squadron when
he learned he had been selected as an astronaut candidate in 1980.
   Richards is married. His flight experience includes more than
4,000 hours in 16 different kinds of airplanes.

   Marine Lt. Col. Robert Cabana is
making his first trip into space as the pilot aboard Discovery.
   The 41-year-old astronaut said before the launch that he was
looking forward to his first trip into space, calling it ``the
culmination of a lot of years of work on my part.''
   Cabana is quick to defend NASA, attributing the recent rash of
problems to mere coincidence, not carelessness.
   ``I think NASA is going to come through this and do just fine.
... I haven't seen any complacency at all,'' Cabana said. ``There's
no push to do anything unsafely.''
   Cabana was born in Minneapolis where he graduated from Washburn
High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the
Naval Academy.
   He also graduated from the Navy test pilot school and later
served as a test pilot for flight systems and ordnance separation
testing on aircraft.
   NASA selected him as an astronaut in 1986. He and his wife have
three children.
   When the Discovery mission ends, Cabana said he plans to get
back in line and wait for another flight assignment. He hopes to
command his own shuttle mission.
   ``I want to stay here and fly shuttles as long as they let me,''
he said.

   Navy Capt. Bill Shepherd, a veteran
of a previous shuttle mission, is the flight engineer aboard
Discovery.
   Shepherd, 41, first flew into space aboard Atlantis on a secret
Defense Department mission in December 1988. He was a mission
specialist on that flight.
   On this mission, Shepherd is taking on the additional role of
flight engineer, who assists the commander and pilot during takeoff
and landing.
   Shepherd was born in Oak Ridge, Tenn. He graduated from Arcadia
High School in Scottsdale, Ariz., and earned a bachelor's degree in
aerospace engineering from the Naval Academy.
   He also attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
where he earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering.
   After graduating from the Naval Academy, he served with an
underwater demolition team and two SEAL teams. Shepherd, who's
single, was selected as an astronaut in 1984.

   Discovery mission specialist Bruce
E. Melnick is the first astronaut selected from the U.S. Coast
Guard.
   Melnick, a Coast Guard commander, is one of two Discovery
astronauts designated to perform a spacewalk during the mission
should an emergency arise.
   Melnick said he first wanted to be an astronaut as a youth when
he watched Alan Shepherd become the first American to fly in space.
   ``But I didn't think it was a realistic goal,'' Melnick said.
   Melnick was born in New York City, but he grew up in Clearwater,
Fla., where he graduated from Clearwater High School.
   He worked on fishing boats in Florida and became interested in
the Coast Guard planes he saw flying in the area. Being a Coast
Guard pilot, he said, seemed a more realistic goal - ``so that's
the direction I took.''
   After earning a bachelor's degree in engineering from the Coast
Guard Academy, he was assigned as a deck watch officer aboard a
cutter. Sixteen months later, he went to Navy flight training.
   He earned his wings in 1974 and a master's degree in
aeronautical systems from the University of West Florida a year
later. He worked as a Coast Guard rescue pilot and an operations
officer before being selected as an astronaut.
   Melnick is married and has two children.

   Air Force Maj. Tom Akers, who is
making his first trip into space, was assigned to deploy the
plutonium-powered Ulysses sun probe during the mission.
   He also is one of the crew members trained to do a spacewalk if
necessary.
   Akers was born in St. Louis but considers Eminence, Mo., his
hometown. He was the 1969 high school valedictorian from Eminence
High School.
   He earned a bachelor's and master's degree in applied
mathematics from the University of Missouri-Rolla.
   Akers worked as a National Park Ranger at Alley Springs, Mo.,
during the summers from 1972 through 1975. He also spent four years
as a high school principal in Eminence.
   He joined the Air Force in 1979 and attended the Air Force Test
Pilot School three years later.
   Akers, married and with two children, was serving as the
executive officer to the armament division's deputy commander for
research, development and acquisition when selected as an astronaut
in 1987.
