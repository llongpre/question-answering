   The $500 million B-2 stealth bomber
revved its engines and taxied across a desert runway at up to 100
mph Monday, operating under its own power for the first time.
   The Air Force pronounced the tests of the sinister-looking,
black-and-gray flying wing a success and said high-speed tests of
the radar-evading nuclear bomber would be conducted later this week
with a view toward its first flight soon afterward.
   ``You've got a lot of firsts here today,'' said Maj. Pat
Mullaney. ``You have the first time under its own power, you have it
turning. All this has only been done before on computer
simulations.''
   The sleek, boomerang-shaped strategic bomber rolled from its
super-secret research hangar and taxied back and forth on an
11,000-foot runway at Air Force Plant 42, the crucible through which
virtually all Air Force aircraft pass.
   ``I love it,'' said Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Tess Taft, waving
an American flag.
   Three taxi tests at different speeds stopped traffic on Sierra
Highway next to the plant and offered the first unobstructed view of
the craft since it was unveiled for the news media on Nov. 22.
   At approximately $500 million each, the plane is the nation's
most expensive and controversial, joining the nation's arsenal
during a period of increasing Pentagon budget cuts.
   The stealth is designed to drop nuclear bombs and fire cruise
missiles and evade radar and infrared detection.
   Despite delays that have plagued the B-2, Brig. Gen. Richard
Scofield, B-2 program director, said, ``Everybody in the Air Force
is convinced that we are working the schedule the right way. We are
making sure the plane works right for when we do the hazardous
testing, and flight test is hazardous.''
   Tests on the B-2 took place in the Antelope Valley of the Mojave
Desert where the space shuttle was built and where test pilot Chuck
Yeager first broke the sound barrier in 1947.
   For weeks, people fascinated with the eerie manta-like aircraft
have parked nearby, hoping for a glimpse. On Monday, the dozen or so
regulars got an eyeful.
   The plane rolled out of its hangar shortly after sunrise and
stayed in view of highway onlookers for three hours. Periodically,
its engines ran at various pitches and decibels, sometimes blowing a
lonesome whistle across the desert, sometimes accelerating up to a
dull roar.
