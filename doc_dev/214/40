   With its engines spitting fire and its pencil-thin
nose outlined against gray skies, the sleek American spy plane set
down here Wednesday for its debut at the world's most famous air
show.
   The SR-71 reconnaissance jet has never been displayed outside the
United States, but it will be a featured attraction at the Paris Air
Show, where it will stand beside flying machines from the Soviet
Union and other nations.
   More than 365,000 people are expected to attend.
   The air show, which is to be opened Thursday by President
Francois Mitterrand, will include a celebration of the 20th
anniversary of America's walk on the moon.
   The show, held every two years, is to the air industry what the
Cannes film festival is to movies: a glitzy gathering where products
are promoted, aviation stars strut before reporters, deals are
announced and others are made.
   More than 1,000 exhibitors from 34 countries will be at the show
this year, and 140,000 industry professionals are expected. They cut
deals under the roar of aircraft flying nonstop demonstrations
overhead.
   Even before the show officially opened, the rainy skies over
Pari's Le Bourget airfield were filled with jets performing feats
that awed even jaded professionals in the midst of last-minute
preparations for the displays.
   After setting down in the SR-71, known as the Blackbird because
of its two vertical stabilizers and sleek profile, the pilot and
systems officer climbed out of the aircraft dressed like astronauts.
Before a crowd of photographers, they unfurled the blue, white and
red French flag.
   First delivered to the U.S. Air Force in 1966, the plane was
developed by Lockheed Aircraft Corp. as a long-range, advanced
strategic reconnaissance aircraft.
   It is one of the fastest and highest-flying in the skies today.
It cruises at altitudes above 80,000 feet and at speeds of about
3,100 feet per second _ more than three times faster than sound.
   The aircraft carries systems capable of surveying 100,000 square
miles in one hour, placing it in direct competition with newer, more
sophisticated satellites.
   The Soviets also gave a glimmer Wednesday of what their planes
can do.
   Their Soukhoi-27 _ being shown alongside two MiG-29 jet fighters
and the Soviet space shuttle Buran _ swooped, spun, and flipped high
overhead. At one moment, the high-speed plane seemed to stall dead
still, pulled its nose straight up, and flipped over on its back.
   Apollon Systvov, the Soviet Aeronautics Industry Minister, later
told a news conference the relaxation of international tensions and
more openness in his country made it possible for greater
participation by the Soviets at this year's show.
   ``We want to give you an idea of the level of Soviet technology
and the expertise of our pilots,'' he said. ``But we do not deny the
commercial aspects and know there is a market for our aircraft.''
   The Soviet officials said he expected his country's space shuttle
to be the star of the show.
   He said Buran, which made its first unmanned flight last
November, has commercial possibilities as a satellite launcher.
However, he said his government will continue launching its
satellites with rockets.
   Buran's next flight is to be in 1991, he said.
