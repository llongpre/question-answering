Sharp-eyed observers have spotted flocks of the Air Force's most secret fighter 
jets flying over Southern California in recent weeks, providing the first 
in-flight glimpses of an aircraft that has remained shrouded in mystery for 
more than 10 years, according to an authoritative defense industry magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of 10 F-117 "stealth" fighter jets have been seen during daylight hours 
streaking over Mojave, a small town outside Edwards Air Force Base about 90 
miles north of Los Angeles, Aviation Week and Space Technology reported in its 
May 1 issue. 
</P>
<P>
After flying the F-117 for five years, the Air Force last November unveiled the 
aircraft to the public for the first time. The plane uses special designs and 
materials to elude detection by radar. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the service said it wanted to begin daytime flights of the 
bat-like warplane and acknowledged that such training flights would lead to 
sightings by civilians. Until recently, the Air Force had been flying the 
aircraft under cover of night in an effort to keep details of the plane a 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force, which has remained secretive about most details of the plane, 
said Friday that it would not discuss operational matters regarding the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
While the nation's 52-plane force of the stealth fighters is based at Tonopah 
Test Range Airfield in Nevada, the latest round of training flights appears to 
be conducted at Edwards Air Force Base and nearby test ranges in the Mojave 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation Week noted that Edwards Air Force Base traditionally has been used as 
a flying range for experimental planes, rather than as a training site for 
planes already in the force. Practice runs involving 10 aircraft, such as those 
observed on April 12 and 18, are rare in that area. 
</P>
<P>
Overflights of the aircraft have revealed to area residents one its most 
distinctive characteristics -- the faint, high-pitched whine of two engines as 
the jet passes overhead at speeds just below the speed of sound. "This sound 
was definitely different," one observer told the magazine. "There was no doubt 
this was something we hadn't heard before. It even set the dogs off before we 
heard it." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Corp. is to build a total of 59 F-117s at its experimental "skunk 
works" facility in Palmdale.
