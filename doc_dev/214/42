   Two top-of-the-line Soviet fighters
accompanied by the world's largest aircraft made a historic stop at
Elmendorf Air Force Base on Sunday, en route to a ``sales mission''
in Canada.
   It was the first time that MiG-29 fighters and the Soviet An-225
transport had landed on the North American continent.
   ``These are showroom models,'' said Maj. Doug McCoy, an
Elmendorf spokesman who was referring to the pair of stripped-down
MiG-29s that had taxied to within 20 yards of journalists, Air
Force observers and about 250 spectators.
   ``These are factory aircraft. They haven't been delivered to the
Soviet Air Force. Civilian test pilots are flying the MiGs.''
   The Soviets were en route to the Abbotsford International Air
Show in Vancouver, British Columbia.
   There, the fighters and the giant transport will be displayed
and demonstrated as part of the Soviet military's latest and
greatest.
   After a four-hour refueling stop in Alaska they were to be
escorted to the Canadian border by U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagles. They
were to be met by Canadian Forces CF-18s Hornet jet fighters.
   ``This is the first time since 1945 that Soviet fighter aircraft
have flown through Alaska airspace,'' said Lt. Gen. Thomas
McInerney, commander of the Alaskan Air Command. ``It hasn't been
since Lend-Lease when some 8,000 planes left U.S. factories being
flown directly to the Soviet Eastern Front that we've marked such
an occurrence.
   ``Today we are hosting the Soviet military aircraft en route to
a much friendlier event.''
   Capt. Richard Armstrong, one of the F-15 Eagle fighter pilots
who escorted the MiGs through U.S. airspace, said it was thrilling
to be the first American pilot to get so close to the Soviet
frontline fighter.
   ``I'd like to say it was another day at the office, but I'd be
ying,'' Armstrong said. ``It's a pretty airplane. I felt a little
like you do when you have guests in your house. You want to make
them feel comfortable, but you give them some help.''
   The Soviets took time to participate in a news conference Sunday
primarily to express thanks for the welcome they had been shown.
   They were hosted for lunch at the Elmendorf Officers' Club and
invited to shop at the Base Exchange.
   ``We were met by excellent aircraft and excellent pilots,'' said
Anotoly Kvochur, a Mikoyan Test Bureau pilot who does the
demonstration flights of the MiG-29s at air shows. ``I hope our
relations will be just as they are and will improve.''
   Kvochur was forced to eject from a MiG-29 two months ago at the
Paris Air Show when the aircraft sucked a bird into a jet intake
during a low-altitude pass.
   The green, gray and black MiG-29s are twin-engine fighters
comparable in size to the Navy's F-A-18 Hornet.
   The transport has six turbofan engines and plays a major role in
the Soviet space program, in which it shuttles the Buran space
shuttle orbiter and sections of rocket launch vehicles.
   It was unknown to the West until a prototype was unveiled last
year. Fewer than 10 are likely to be manufactured, Air Force
officials said.
