  [Text] Iraq has informed the United Nations of violations 
of its airspace by U.S. aircraft which were on surveillance and 
harassment missions, during which they dropped flares on Iraqi 
territory. 
  In a letter to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Ghali, the 
Iraqi permanent representative to the United Nations said that 
U.S. aircraft continued to violate Iraqi airspace during period 
11-20 April. They conducted 619 hostile air sorties during that 
period. Their flights centered over northern and southern Iraq. 
  The U.S. aircraft also broke the sound barrier over several 
Iraqi cities.
