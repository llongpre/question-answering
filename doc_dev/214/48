   Air Force Col. Richard O. Covey,
who has flown twice in space, is commanding his first shuttle
flight aboard Atlantis.
   Covey has been an astronaut since 1978. He was a pilot on two
previous missions, including the first shuttle to fly since the
Challenger disaster.
   He first flew into space aboard Discovery in 1985 on a mission
to deploy three communications satellites. The crew also repaired
an ailing satellite in space.
   Covey, 44, again was a pilot on Discovery in 1988 on the first
post-Challenger mission. The five astronauts deployed a
communications satellite during the flight.
   He was born in Fayetteville, Ark., but considers Fort Walton
Beach, Fla., his hometown.
   After graduating from Choctawhatchee High School in Shalimar,
Fla., he earned a bachelor's degree in engineering sciences from
the Air Force Academy and a master's degree in aeronautics and
astronautics from Purdue.
   Covey flew 339 combat missions in Southeast Asia and was a test
pilot before becoming an astronaut.

aboard Discovery on a March 1989 flight. During the five-day
mission, the crew's primary goal was deploying a communications
satellite.
   The 48-year-old astronaut also worked on the final development
of the shuttle's robot arm.
   Born in St. Louis, Springer grew up in Ashland, Ohio, and
graduated from Ashland High School. He earned a bachelor's in naval
science from the Naval Academy and a master's in operations
research and systems analysis from the Naval Postgraduate School.
   He went through basic training for the Marine Corps in Quantico,
Va., before reporting to the Navy Air Training Command for flight
training at Pensacola., Fla., and Beeville, Texas.
   In Vietnam, he flew F-4 aircraft, completing 300 combat
