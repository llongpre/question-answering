   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It flies to more than 17 miles high, out of
harm's way, at three times the speed of sound, faster than a bullet.
The SR-71, the original stealth jet called the ``Blackbird,'' is 25
years old now but it still holds world records for speed and
altitude. As one Air Force pilot says, ``The SR-71 excites the boy
in all of us who love to fly.''

   The SR-71 suddenly flashes into view
out of nowhere, like a star ship in the movies. Shaped like a
dagger, black and sinister, it slices cloud puffs in an otherwise
blue sky as it climbs slowly to mate with a refueling air tanker.
   This is the ``Blackbird,'' the original stealth jet that rockets
at 2,100 mph to the edge of space as it spies on global hot spots
out of reach of attack.
   The spacesuit-clad pilot and navigator _ members of an elite Air
Force team _ peer out toward the refueling tanker, where a news crew
is observing a training exercise that wandered 1,200 miles over five
Western states.
   The ``Blackbird,'' the photo reconnaissance jet U.S. Air Force
officials call part engineering miracle, part ghost, is the one that
first employed stealth or radar-evading technology, the one that
still packs top-secret gear and was once so secret that TV news film
of it was confiscated by the military.
   Its crew members, who themselves were the target of an espionage
attempt at their home base in California, say they have been
attacked numerous times by missiles fired from ground forces or jet
fighters futilely trying to cut short the Blackbird's missions,
which involve photographing foreign nations. SR-71s don't return
fire. They're unarmed.
   The twin-engine Blackbird is able to evade the attacks because it
still holds world records for speed and altitude, even though it is
25 years old.
   Its top capabilities remain secret, but the Air Force says it
flies to more than 85,000 feet at over three times the speed of
sound. That's roughly 33 miles a minute _ faster than a bullet, fast
enough to streak from San Francisco to New York in 1 hour, 45
minutes.
   A former SR-71 pilot, Col. Richard Graham, says the aging plane,
which was designed by Lockheed, can still out-perform most, if not
all, of the other operational aircraft in the world.
   ``For the 1960s, it was way ahead of its time. It was at the
leading edge of stealth technology,'' says Graham, who commands the
wing that includes the sole SR-71 squadron, stationed at Beale Air
Force Base, 110 miles northeast of San Francisco.
   Adds current Blackbird pilot, Lt. Col. Bill Orcutt: ``I think the
aircraft still carries quite a bit of mystique ... It looks like
something from outer space. The SR-71 excites the boy in all of us
who love to fly.''
   The pilots say it flies like no other: ``You're so far up you
don't have a sensation of speed and you start to see the curvature
of the earth,'' says Graham. ``It's smooth, serene, peaceful, quiet
_ you hear your own breathing. There's no weather at that altitude
... If you look straight up (into space), it's black.''
   But cutbacks are planned in the Blackbird program because of
budget restraints and the aircraft may soon be replaced by a
super-advanced stealth spy plane that reportedly is under
development.
   The new jet will fly even farther out of reach of hostile forces,
hurtling at about five times the speed of sound _ nearly twice as
fast as the SR-71 _ to more than 100,000 feet, news reports say.
   Moreover, the new plane is so shrouded in stealth technology that
it will go undetected as it careens over other nations, according to
the reports. The stealth technology, still largely secret, has grown
far more sophisticated in the two decades since the design of the
SR-71, which was built with radar-absorbing materials and
beam-deflecting curves on its body.
   With the new jet still under development, along with its F-19
fighter and B-2 bomber counterparts, it is the SR-71 that continues
to collect information for the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence
Agency.
   Recent missions reportedly have included flights over the Persian
Gulf and the Arabian Sea to provide data to U.S. warships operating
in the area. Its cameras can photograph 100,000 square miles an
hour, revealing the terrain in enough detail to, say, make out a
license plate, according to the Air Force.
