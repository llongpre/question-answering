<F P=106> [Article by Igor Yemelyanov: "This Yar Wasn't So Easy to </F>
Come By: Our First Space Launch Facility Hears the Roar of 
Rockets Less and Less Often"] 
  [Text] When the United States got its hands on the German 
V-2s in '45, it was soaring high in the sky. The USSR managed to 
get only the crumbs from the German rocket pie, but we had S. 
Korolev and V. Glushko and the pride of the victors. 
  On October 18 of '47, the first Soviet rocket, the R-1, flew 
its first 207 km. It launched from the top-secret testing 
grounds of Kapustin Yar. Out of 10 proposed sites strewn across 
the Union, a piece of the Volga steppe the size of a small 
European state was chosen. They say that Lawrence Berry 
[Lavrentiy Beriya] himself kept tabs on the project. 
  They didn't allot much time to hammer out the country's 
missile shield, throwing three engineering-construction brigades 
from the front to Kapustin Yar. V. Voznyuk, the katyusha 
specialist who had rocketed from major to general in one year of 
the war, created a super testing ground on the barren spot at 
Stalin's command. The railroad to it from Stalingrad didn't go 
through a single population center. 
  The military watch began with the R-2, the absolute favorite 
of the testers for the 6 tons of alcohol that went in to make up 
the fuel. The R-5 was the first missile with a nuclear warhead 
to rush to the east. They say there that, to this day, no one 
knows whether it exploded or not, or where it could have 
happened. The famous R-12s, which were hauled to Cuba in order 
to settle the Caribbean crisis, stood "cocked" for a full 30 
years and were regarded as the strongest of the fingers of our 
nuclear fist. True, the alcohol in them was long gone, but the 
parity with the Yankees wasn't shaken. The RSD-10 (SS-20), which 
was born in '73 and shocked all our enemies, had no match for 
many years. When the United States got wind of them, it decided 
right then and there to make peace with the "evil empire." 
  The road was carved out for Gagarin by 48 dogs launched from 
Kapustin Yar. The first to go aloft, in the summer of '51, were 
not Belka and Strelka, who were also prepared here, but Dozik 
and Tsygan. Later one pioneer died, and a second lived with S. 
Korolev's family. A dog by the name of Otvazhnaya [Brave] went 
up four times. But not all of them were drawn to the stars -- 
one animal decided to run away just before the launch, right 
from the launch pad, and they had to send the nearest mongrel up 
into space in its place. But it didn't matter, they got the job 
done for the party and the government. 
  At Kapustin Yar, they built the first artificial Earth 
satellite, which was put into orbit from Baykonur. At Kapustin 
Yar, they worked the bugs out of the space television, radio, 
and telephone communications. 
  The heaviest fog of secrecy had barely lifted in '73, when 
we 
helped the Poles lift their first, the Copernicus-500, to the 
proper altitude. We launched the friendly Indian Ariabata series 
in '75, and after that, even the French were allowed to go to 
orbit from there. 
  Buran, which engendered a flurry of enthusiasm when it took 
off and landed in Kazakhstan, was painstakingly built in the 
Volga region under the supervision of German Titov. 
  But in the '80s, we got "caught up," as it were, in big 
space. The USSR had another space jacket -- Baykonur 
  Hit over the Urals on the first of May in '60, the American 
pilot Powers had been quite [illegible] as he bailed out of the 
cozy U-2. His superiors had not warned him that the Russians had 
the Volkhov S-75 antiaircraft missile complex, which laughed at 
the high-altitude jet capabilities of the reconnaissance plane 
from the States. They didn't warn him because they didn't know 
the Russian had it. 
  The antiaircraft testing grounds had broken away from its 
strategic missile brother in '51, and within less than two 
months, it roared with the first vertical-launch surface-to-air 
missile. The multichannel creation was outfitted to protect the 
motherland's capital. Within three years, the surface-to-air 
missile complex was firing at 20 targets at once. In May of '55, 
first Moscow, and then other important centers and borders were 
bristling with the arrows of SAMs. 
  The first mobile SAM unit, the Dvina, was combat ready in 
late '57, near Brest. A version of it, the Volkhov, not only 
interrupted the spy flight over the center of the Soviet 
military-industrial complex, but also let the United States know 
that the USSR was ahead of everyone else on the planet in air 
defense, which meant that it was hazardous to flit about 
perniciously over one-sixth of the land surface. 
  The Volkhov, and later the Pechora, made their way to 40 
countries and didn't do badly in the confrontation with Phantoms 
in Viet Nam and Mirages in the Near East. 
  In just two years at Kapustin Yar, they "rolled out" the 
first automatic system for controlling SAMs. The mid-60s saw the 
appearance of radar systems for detecting enemy aircraft. 
Finally, unique simulator systems were created in the '70s. That 
is, by turning on a computer, but without launching aircraft or 
rockets, they were able to work out the bugs there in combat 
with any air attack that might happen. The Americans were 
gnashing their teeth with envy. And in February of '93, all they 
could do was hold on to a pillar in Abu Dabi: in the Arabian 
sky, Russian-made S-300s on the fly knocked out two cruise 
missiles. The sheiks gave a standing ovation. 
  Do you remember the story about the "submarine in the 
Ukrainian steppes?" It's not altogether a myth. In Kapustin Yar, 
in an immense basin, is a sub in which they used to test 
sea-launched missiles. Generally speaking, Kapustin Yar is 
replete with legends. The burst of myth-making began between '88 
and '91, when 654 intermediate-range SS-20 missiles were being 
destroyed here. 
  Legend No. 1: nuclear explosions occur in the Volga steppes. 
In fact, the warheads have been removed in other places, and 
here they've only exploded batches of airframes. 
  Legend No. 2: as a result of the explosions in Kapustin Yar, 
windows have shattered, walls have cracked, and, in Volgograd, 
homes have been demolished. On August 30 of '90, Academician Ye. 
Velikhov reported in an analysis that the seismic vibrations 5 
kilometers from the explosion site do not exceed 3 on the scale. 
It's 28 kilometers to Kapustin Yar, the windows in the local 
department store shattered only once, when a fighter plane broke 
the sound barrier over the city. 
  Legend No. 3: a massive die-off of sheep was associated with 
the missiles. A commission of the main directorate, 
veterinarians, and a scientific research institute found sulfur 
and arsenic in the wool and livers of the sheep that died. The 
lab head from the All-Union Scientific Research Institute, G. 
Kashfutdinov, suggested that "the main reason for the deaths 
was, apparently, the rocket-fuel combustion products of unknown 
composition." We could brand the fleecing missile-people, but 
the "rocket fuel products" of the SS-20 contain neither sulfur, 
nor arsenic; the emissions of the Astrakhan Gas-Condensate 
Combine, however, does contain those products. 
  The keys to the Kapustin Yar, a city of 32,000 closed off by 
three checkpoints, are held in two hands -- that of the garrison 
leadership and that of the city government. And although the 
small Astrakhan Oblast Council pointed out on May 17 of this 
year that, according to current law, the civilian executive body 
is supposed to reign in Kapustin Yar, the real boss of that 
settlement is Gen. V. Tonkikh. 
  But that doesn't mean that the missile arm of authority and 
the civilian arm of authority are locked in battle under the 
carpet. Last April, the local police, together with the 
military, averted a massive action of youth that was meant to 
"run out of town" Kavkaz people who had been attracted to 
Kapustin Yar to revive trade. It was averted without any 
injuries. Over all of '93, there was only one murder. 
  The initial impression that it's mainly sports figures and 
top models who live there was confirmed in a visit I made to the 
sports complex, which has a pool, a shooting range, and a 
stadium. 
  Today, the leasing of launch pads in Kazakhstan, which may 
be 
seeing their last winter, costs billions, and their equipment 
and people can and should be transferred to a re-outfitted 
Kapustin Yar, where products and fuel don't have to be brought 
in by plane. 
  And if Plesetsk, planted in the northern bogs, can be 
regarded as the Russian equivalent to the Kapustin Yar missile 
testing grounds, then the air-defense testing grounds in 
Zavolzhye is the only one in Russia. We no other sites where we 
can do a professional job of testing antiaircraft systems that 
tomorrow would protect both the country and its interests in 
local conflicts. Where else is it possible to be demonstrating 
to hard-currency buyers, on a permanent basis, new SAM complexes 
in all their glory (China has already bought a batch of S-300s, 
Kuwait is thing about it, although what's there to think about 
-- the Patriots are more expensive and not as good)? In the 
opinion of V. Korolev, the deputy chief for science of the 
air-defense testing grounds, any and all kinds of weapons from 
any of the combat arms could be tested in Kapustin Yar. 
  Whatever the military doctrine, it would be stupid to not 
preserve the Kapustin Yar testing grounds after having made them 
into a base for the country's armed forces and having abandoned 
expensive foreign launch pads.
