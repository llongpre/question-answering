   Navy Capt. John O. Creighton,
commander of the all-military crew aboard Atlantis, was the pilot
on his first trip into space nearly five years ago.
   Creighton, 46, became an astronaut in 1978 and flew his first
shuttle mission aboard Discovery in June 1985.
   Born in Orange, Texas, he grew up in Seattle. After earning a
bachelor's degree from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1966, Creighton
began flight training and received his wings a year later. He
received a master's degree in administration of science and
technology from George Washington University in 1978.
   Creighton has logged about 5,000 hours flying time and has
completed 500 carrier landings and 175 combat missions.
   He was the lead capsule communicator _ the astronaut who talks
to the crew for Mission Control _ on the first four shuttle flights
in the post-Challenger era.
   Creighton married Terry Stanford. He has received 10 air medals
and the Navy Commendation Medal.
