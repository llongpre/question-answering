   The B-2 stealth bomber is a
revolutionary advancement in intercontinental bombers that was in
development for 18 years, Air Force officials say.
   The B-2 was designed to evade detection by sophisticated enemy
air defenses with an unorthodox design of curves and contours.
   The stealth technology does not elude enemy radar so much as
absorb it, reflecting little radar energy back to ground receivers.
   ``We're talking about an aircraft now that basically negates the
air defenses built up in many many places around the world over many
years,'' said Gen. Bernard P. Randolph, who directs research,
development and testing of aerospace systems for the Air Force.
   The flying wing design was first conceived in the 1940s by
Northrop Corp. founder Jack Northrop, although the YB-49 aircraft he
built was scrapped by the government in 1948 in favor of more
conventional bomber designs.
   A factor leading to the demise of the YB-49 was a crash that
killed air force test pilot Glen Edwards. The Mojave Desert air
force base that now bears his name has become a focus of advanced
flight test research.
   The history of the flying wing came full circle Monday, as the
B-2 successfully completed its maiden flight and landed smoothly at
Edwards.
   The bomber is about 17 feet high and 69 feet long, only slightly
longer than an F-15 fighter.
   The wingspan, however, is about 172 feet, almost the span of a
B-52 bomber.
   It is powered by four General Electric engines mounted on top of
the wing. The Air Force says the engines were derived from those
used in F-16 and F-14 fighters.
   The bomber flies at subsonic speeds and is capable of hugging the
terrain closely or flying as high as 50,000 feet, the Air Force said.
   The B-2 has an operational range of more than 6,000 nautical
miles at high altitudes and more than 10,000 nautical miles with
aerial refueling capability.
   The aircraft will carry both nuclear and conventional weapons,
the Air Force said.
   The two-hour test flight was conducted with the landing gear
extended during the entire flight.
   Northrop test pilot Bruce J. Hinds, 50, and copilot Air Force
Col. Richard S. Couch, 42, said they flew the bomber at three speeds
and guided it through numerous turns to test its stability.
   Couch described the B-2 as ``a very nimble aircraft'' and said
the landing approach was ``rock'' steady.
