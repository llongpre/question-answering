<HEAD>Apples, Grapes, Broccoli Apparently Help Body Use Calcium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fruits and vegetables high in boron _ like
apples and broccoli _ appear to keep bones stronger by preventing
loss of calcium.
   ``You could drink milk to kingdom come and never get any
boron,'' said Forrest H. Nielsen, director of the Department of
Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research Center in Grand Forks, N.D.
   Nielsen led a study of five men and 10 women who were given a
low-boron diet for nine weeks, then boron supplements for seven
weeks. When the boron was reduced, the subjects excreted more
calcium _ their bodies weren't using it.
   When boron was increase, ``there was less calcium in their
urine,'' and more calcium and an active form of vitamin D in their
blood, he said.
   Nielsen said nobody knows yet exactly what boron does in the
body; the first studies suggesting that it might be important were
done in 1987. ``Before 1987 there was no evidence that it might be
important in human nutrition. We'd known it was essential to plants
since 1910, but we still don't know what its biochemical role is
(in plants).''
   Nielsen said he isn't suggesting boron supplements. Large
amounts can cause changes similar to osteoporosis _ brittleness of
bones resulting from a loss of calcium _ and a well-balanced diet
will include enough, he said.
   Boron is found in broccoli, cabbage and other leafy vegetables;
nuts, legumes and fruits _ especially apples, pears and grapes, he
said. ``But when you talk about a meat and potatoes and milk and
cheese diet, you're talking about a diet low in boron. I think it's
absent in a lot of diets.''
   Harold Sandstead, chairman of preventive medicine and community
health at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston,
said, ``The findings are extremely interesting and might have
importance for human health. They have to be confirmed by another
researcher. But these are very careful workers.''

<HEAD>Earth Berms Cheaper, More Effective At Highway Noise Reduction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Earth berms on either side of a
highway cut noise levels in nearby neighborhoods better than
barrier walls, a researcher says.
   ``These are even more effective if they are covered with grass
or other vegetation because the carpet of plants absorbs the
sound,'' said Sabih Hayek, a professor of engineering science and
mechanics. Without vegetation, the berms simply reflect most of the
sound back onto the roadway.
   Most trees increase noise to neighborhoods near busy
thoroughfares because sound is reflected off leaves, he said. ``Fir
trees will work better because their needles do not reflect sound.
In fact, they absorb sound.''
   Artificial walls of concrete, fiberglass or wood reflect noise
back onto the roadway or over the barrier, said Hayek, whose
research was sponsored by the National Cooperative Highway Research
Program of the Transportation Research Board, representing 50 state
highway departments.
   ``It is possible to cut as much noise as you want using noise
barriers,'' Hayek said, ``however costs increase dramatically with
the increase in desired noise reduction.'' A 15-foot-high wall
costs $200 to $250 a foot to build.
   ``We have tested noise barriers covered with materials that
absorb sound, but the added cost of construction is notical
compared with the slight increase in noise reduction achieved with
absorbent barriers,'' he said.
   Double walls decrease noise levels behind them three-fold over a
single wall, and horizontal overhangs on vertical walls also can
greatly decrease noise levels, but are very expensive to buildhe
said.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Study Evidence Of Cannibalism Among Anasazi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human bones found in an Anasazi ceremonial
chamberuggest the generally peaceful farmers may have turned to
cannibalism, at least for rituals that likely included prisoners,
an archaeologist says.
   ``My first reaction was, `Oh my God. Soch for our peaceful
farmers,''' said John Cater, a graduate student at
Colorado-Boulder. ``They were so shattered that it was all very
clear what was going on.''
   Archaeologists discovered the bones piled in neat patterns and
some smashed to bits in a ``kiva.'' Near the central firepit lay
stone axes and knives still smeared with microscopic traces of
ancient gore. The wooden ceiling of the kiva was collapsed when the
carnage was compleed, obscuring the evidence for nearly 1,000
years, near what is now the town of Yellow Jacket, Cater said.
   He believes the victims may have been prisoners, and rules out
hunger as a reason for the carnage. ``We've seen too many examples
of when times got rough, people just got up and left. That would be
a bption than eating the next-door '
   Frederick Lange, curator of anthropology at the university
museum, endorses Cater's analysis. But he said evidence at other
sites suggests some desperate Anasazi may have resorted to
cannibalism to ave off starvation.
   The Anasazi started a network of high-rise cliff dwellings in
the Southwest about A.D. 400 and deserted them 900 years later,
presumably after drought or invasion. Barely 10 percent of known
Anasazi ruins in Colorado, Utah, Arizew Mexico have been
excavated. Signs of cannibalism have been found in up to 20 digs,
scattered over thousands of square miles and centuries.
