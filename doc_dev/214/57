   Another barrier fell to glasnost Sunday as the
Soviets revealed to their own people and the rest of the world the
deadliest weapon in their air force arsenal _ the needle-nosed
strategic bomber NATO calls the Blackjack.
   Plagued by a chain of recent mishaps, including plane crashes and
the highly publicized defection of a fighter pilot, the Soviet air
force may have needed some good publicity.
   In a dazzling three-hour air show _ the country's first in more
than 20 years _ it aimed to show Soviet and foreign doubters that it
still very much has the right stuff.
   Although Western air attaches who attended said they saw little
that was new, the ``Aviation-Sports Holiday'' was clearly in line
with the policy of glasnost, or openness, pursued by the Kremlin
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which has also brought an
easing of the once-obsessive secrecy about military affairs.
   Assembled on the grass at Tushino airfield in Moscow's northwest,
more than 150,000 people saw the supersonic Blackjack bomber _ known
here as the Tupolev -160 _ streak by, along with other aeronautics
novelties like the pontoon-winged A-40 floating amphibious rescue
plane, the Ilyushin 96-300 jetliner and the Tupolev-204, called the
Soviet version of the Boeing 757 by Westerners.
   The Blackjack, which the Pentagon says is the largest and
heaviest bomber in the world, flashed out of the north over Tushino
at a height of only 800-1,000 feet, its four thundering jet engines
leaving a yellow smudge of exhaust behind in the sky.
   Flying at about 380 mph, the plane, whose nose resembles that of
the Concorde supersonic jetliner, shot past the airfield in seconds,
then peeled off towards the south and the high-rise towers of a
Moscow residential district.
   Despite its NATO designation, the plane was painted a dazzling
white.
   According to the Pentagon's 1988 study ``Soviet Military Power,''
the bomber has a maximum speed of Mach 2, twice the speed of sound
or more than 1,300 mph, and an unrefueled combat range of about
4,500 miles. It reportedly can carry payloads of bombs or
air-launched cruise missiles.
   Then-U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci was invited to inspect
a Blackjack bomber at Kubinka air base near Moscow in August 1988
and saw it fly, but Sunday's flight was the first before the general
public.
   The official Tass news agency called the Blackjack's flight ``the
main event'' of the air show, which it said was attended by
Politburo members Nikolai N. Slyunkov and Viktor M. Chebrikov and
the Soviet defense minister, Dmitri T. Yazov.
   According to Jane's ``All the World's Aircraft 1988-9,'' the
Soviets are expected to build at least 100 Blackjacks at a new
complex in Kazan. Eleven had been completed by 1988, Jane's said.
   The logic of developing and deploying the bomber came under fire
in the weekly magazine Ogonyok, which again proved that taboos about
criticizing the Soviet defense establishment are much less
restrictive under Gorbachev.
   Ogonyok said the Tu-160 project began long ago as a
``forced-though expensive measure'' to reciprocate for the U.S.
decision to build the B-1B bomber.
   Each Blackjack costs the Soviet people ``millions'' of rubles,
the magazine said.
   The Tushino air show, the Soviets' first since 1967, was
officially held to celebrate Aviation Day, marked every Aug. 20. The
show's cost was pegged by Soviet officials at 800,000 rubles ($1.2
million).
   Western air attaches suggested that one purpose of the show may
have been to give the Soviet people a more favorable image of their
air force. They said that may have been necessary to counter recent
mishaps and problems.
   In July, a pilotless MiG-23 flew halfway across Europe and
crashed in Belgium, killing an 18-year-old man, after its Soviet air
force pilot ejected over Poland.
   The previous month, a Mig-29 fighter crashed at the prestigious
Paris Air Show. A joint Soviet-French commission established that a
bird had been sucked into the engine, causing the crash. Earlier
this year, a Soviet pilot defected to Turkey in a Mig-29.
