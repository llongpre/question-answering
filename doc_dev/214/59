   Here is a look at the crew of the
Columbia space shuttle:
   Col. Brewster Shaw Jr., commander, flew fighter jets in Vietnam
and later was an Air Force test pilot.
   Shaw, 44, became an astronaut 11 years ago. He piloted
Columbia's 1983 Spacelab-1 mission and commanded Atlantis in a 1985
night launch.
   ``If anyone can be said to be the best of the best, Brewster is
up there,'' said former crewmate Charles Walker.
   Shaw worked for the presidential commission that investigated
the Challenger explosion and is the astronaut office's liaison with
the Pentagon for classified payloads.
   Shaw is from Cass City, Mich., and has a master's degrees in
engineering mechanics from the University of Wisconsin. He and his
wife, Kathleen, have three children, ages 19, 12 and 14.
