<LEADPARA>  The Air Force is putting its "right stuff" into fixing up a lot of wrong stuff
at the air base where Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier and where the space
shuttles land.;    The world's most advanced test aircraft are put through
their paces at this sprawling Mojave Desert facility before being ushered into
the Air Force's operational inventory.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Virtually all the Air Force planes that bombed Iraq into submission during
Operation Desert Storm passed their first tests above Edwards' 44-square-mile
alkaline wasteland known as Rogers Dry Lake. The lake bed also provides a
landing strip for NASA space shuttles as they drop in from earth orbit.;   
But billion-dollar, high-tech aircraft such as the B-2 Stealth bomber and the
Advanced Tactical Fighter prototypes are hangared on a frontier-style base
that has seen little improvement since Yeager's test pilot days in the 1950s.;
   "The whole base is a '50s base," said Maj. Gen. John P. Schoeppner,
commander of the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards.;    "What happened
out here is that people got enamored with the test flight business,"
Schoeppner said. "What got ignored was the infrastructure.";    The windswept
facility is plagued by groundwater pollution, sewage problems, collapsed water
pipes, faulty electrical wiring and -- ominously -- large cracks and fissures
in landing zones that threaten to hamper space shuttle operations.;    It also
has dangerous desert roads, outdated barracks and seedy housing that dates
back to the Korean War.;    The infrastructure is so deteriorated that Gen.
Larry Welch, the retired Air Force chief of staff, noted last year that
Edwards would be closed if it were not such a national security resource.;   
Parts of the base "look like a dog's lunch," conceded Schoeppner.;   
Firefighting capability down;  A loss of water pressure in Roman-style
subterranean pipes left the base without firefighting capability except for
the water in the fire trucks. This at the same time that super-sophisticated
aircraft such as the B-2 and ATFs are passing through the crucible of test
operations.;    "I've got multimillion-dollar assets and NASA that I'm
responsible for," the general said.;    Chronic power shortages at Edwards
also have postponed test operations at the facility that is base to 122
aircraft flying 28,000 hours annually.;    Schoeppner and his staff have been
working on remedies and the Flight Test Center commander recently earned a
prestigious "Laurel" award from Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology for the
efforts.;    The condition of the remote desert base imposes hardships and
safety hazards on military families. For example, the road conditions
contributed to 15 "rollover" accidents last year.;    At the time it looked
like the base might erode into the desert sands, the Air Force encountered
moratoriums on military construction because of shrinking defense budgets.;   
But Edwards' role as the prime test facility won it some reprieves.;    Using
a "money mosaic" combining $32 million in emergency military construction
funds and money patched from various programs, the Air Force is laying down
fresh ribbons of asphalt on the desert and installing new electrical and water
lines.;    A major environmental cleanup is under way to heal damage caused by
decades of hazardous waste disposal from aviation fuels and metals.;    Cracks
checked for danger;  Engineers are evaluating the operational danger caused by
cracks and fissures out on the enormous dry lake bed that makes the area a
test pilot's dream for emergency landings.;    Schoeppner said the base also
is partway through refurbishing the ancient housing and barracks and is in the
process of making over "quality of life" sections such as the Base Exchange, a
community center, a youth center and the baseball field named after Challenger
astronaut Ellison Onizuka.;    Edwards is situated far out on the desert,
nearly 100 miles from Los Angeles and 30 miles from the nearest city of any
size. The home of the test pilots celebrated in the book and movie "The Right
Stuff" sometimes compares to Greenland, in terms of its remoteness.;    "My
fiancee hates it," noted 2nd Lt. James Law during a recent tour of the base.
"She's from Maine.";    Law, 23 and fresh out of the Air Force Academy, noted
with pride a landscaping project near the base hospital that combined desert
shrubbery and some fresh strips of greenery.;    "We can't use too much grass,
but people love the grass," the Colorado native said, wistfully. "It almost
looks like a normal base here.";    Schoeppner noted that young military wives
often cry the first time they see the sandy stretches and rocky hills that
form Edwards' dominant terrain.;    "The wives cry when they come on the base
. . . and then they cry when they leave because of the friendships they've
formed and because of the mission we have and the closeness.;    "You have the
whole spectrum of emotions here," Schoeppner said.  </TEXT>
