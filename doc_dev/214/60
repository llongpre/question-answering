   Several large, quiet, triangular wing-shaped
aircraft of unknown origin have been spotted in the air near Air
Force bases in California and elsewhere in the West, reports
Aviation Week and Space Technology.
   A different aircraft whose engines produce a loud roar that
resembles heavy rocket engines also has been spotted, the magazine
said.
   The Air Force declined to confirm or deny that the sightings
were of new warplanes.
   The publication, the current week's edition that became
available Monday, says the triangular aircraft are possibly
prototypes of the Air Force B-2 or Navy A-12 aircraft.
   The A-12 is a new fighter under development, which has not been
displayed. The B-2 is the ``stealth'' bomber, which has been
displayed, and its shape is well-known.
   Aviation Week published what appeared to be pictures of the A-12
without explaining whether they were actual aircraft in flight,
artists' conceptions, models or something else.
   The magazine said the triangular craft did not resemble the
production B-2 with its distinctive sawtooth wing trailing edge.
   It quoted ``well qualified observers'' as reporting that the
aircraft are ``fairly flat'' and triangular shaped with ``a rounded
nose, rounded wingtips and probably no vertical tail surfaces.''
   The observers were not otherwise identified.
   One observer in Nevada was quoted as saying the shape of the
aircraft was ``like a manta ray.''
   The magazine said there have been at least 11 sightings of the
triangular aircraft near Edwards Air Force Base in California and
one near Fresno, Calif. It said there have been other sightings of
similar aircraft in central Nevada near ranges operated by the Air
Force and the Energy Department.
   It described at least 14 sightings of the loud craft, called the
``pulser'' from the pulsating nature of the sound, varying up and
down in intensity once or twice a second, plus other reports of the
sound, often at night.
   It said that typically the pulser aircraft are seen flying a
southwest to northwest track near Edwards Air Force Base and the
China Lake Naval Weapon Center.
   ``This routing would suggest the aircraft are returning from
test ranges or `work areas' off the western U.S. coast where
airline pilots have reported seeing very high-speed vehicles at
altitudes above 50,000 feet,'' the magazine said.
   A companion article said research aircraft flying from Nevada
sites include ``both manned and unmanned hypersonic-capable
aircraft designed to perform strategic reconnaissance and other,
less conventionally defined missions.'' Some aircraft were said to
have ``exotic propulsion and aerodynamic schemes not fully
understood at this time.''
   Col. Joe Purka, an air force public affairs officer, said he
could say nothing.
