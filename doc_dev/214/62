   The $500 million stealth
bomber flew for the first time today, soaring above the Southern
California desert on a two-hour flight aimed at keeping Congress
from scrapping history's most expensive warplane.
   The B-2, designed to evade enemy radar, was arrayed with
reflective material to allow test personnel to keep track of the
plane and its two pilots.
   The sinister-looking, black jet raced down an 11,000-foot runway
at the secretive Air Force Plant 42 at Palmdale and lifted off at
6:37 a.m., with two F-16 fighter jets giving chase through the still
and cloudless desert sky.
   It landed here at 8:30 a.m. after performing test maneuvers over
the Mojave Desert. The plane landed perfectly on the runway's center
line at Edwards, where the space shuttles land after returning from
orbit.
   The bat-winged bomber, 69 feet long with a 172-foot wingspan,
quickly rolled to a stop without a wobble or waver, idled for
several minutes and then taxied into a hangar. The B-2 will remain
at Edwards for further tests.
   The plane's landing gear remained down during the flight, as is
standard practice on test flights in case of malfunctions.
   B-2 test pilot Bruce Hinds later called the bomber ``a very
nimble aircraft'' and said it made a ``rock stable'' landing. Hinds
said the plane handled much the same way it had on a flight
simulator and called it an enjoyable plane to fly.
   The stealth bomber's only previous flights have been on a
computer flight simulation; Air Force and Northrop officials say no
other aircraft has been tested more thoroughly without having been
flown.
   The flight was seen as vital for the future of the bomber, which
is already 18 months behind schedule. At a budgeted price of $500
million each _ the Air Force wants 132 of the planes _ it is the
most expensive warplane in history.
   A key congressional committee voted to withhold further funding
until the plane proves itself in the air.
   ``If that plane doesn't fly, the debate is over,'' Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said Friday. ``It is far too
expensive to be a stealth taxi.''
   As the plane took off this morning, the ``Star Spangled Banner''
was sung on the runway by Alis Clausen, a member of the staff of a
local cable TV station. Air Force Capt. Tess Taft unfurled the Stars
and Stripes, which was held by a tearful Linda Tokish.
   Thousands of civilian stealth watchers gathered among the
tumbleweeds outside the Palmdale plant shouted ``Here they come,
here they come!'' as the great flying-wing's dark shadow passed
over. ``Great God,'' exclaimed Northrop employee Les Holland.
   ``I'm shaking. My legs are shaking. It was going right over my
head,'' said Shari Cutler, who came with her four children.
   ``It feels great. It feels just fantastic. A lot of work has gone
into this. Millions of man hours, with people working seven days a
week, 24 hours a day. We feel just great,'' said Air Force Col.
Douglas Kennett.
   ``I was overcome with emotion. I was so thrilled when I saw the
wheels go up. I'm just so excited to know that it's up there now and
I pray that it lands safely,'' Taft said.
   ``This represents the technology of tomorrow,'' said Maj. Pat
Mullaney. ``It gives us the opportunity to stress deterrence. ... It
represents a new generation of technology and it's the way you're
going to see airplanes look tomorrow.''
   The bomber's maiden flight had been scheduled Saturday, but a low
fuel pressure gauge reading aborted the flight.
   After the flight was canceled, workers checked the aircraft and
discovered a problem in a device called the heat exchanger in the
bomber's fuel system. The problem was fixed, but no other details
were available, said Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry Fergeson.
   The B-2 is designed to carry nuclear bombs, and, along with the
conventional B-1, replace the Air Force's aging fleet of B-52
bombers that have formed part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent since
the 1950s.
   So-called stealth technology combines advanced materials and a
special shape to create a plane undetectable by enemy radar. Though
the bomber is still being developed, stealth fighters have operated
several years.
