The unveiling of the supersonic Franco-British Concorde two decades ago
mortified many in the US aerospace industry.
Although Concorde enjoyed limited commercial success - only a handful are in
operation today - the sleek aeroplane gave the European industry a
tremendous technological base to build upon, and served as a very visible
reminder of the technological competition from the other side of the
Atlantic. The US aerospace industry is determined that it will not be left
on the ground when the next generation of supersonic craft is launched.
At one time, the country had its own supersonic transport programme. But
this ended in 1971, when the US Congress cut off funds for the SST project -
with environmental arguments playing a strong role - after a contract had
been awarded to Boeing.
However, the launch date for the next generation of aircraft built to fly
faster than sound may not be far away. A joint government and private sector
research project in the US - officially known as the High-Speed Research
Programme - has made a significant amount of progress in supersonic design
and is expected to have a product ready for the market in the early part of
the next decade.
If everything turns out as the US aerospace industry plans, the new
aeroplane should represent a substantial improvement on Concorde. The
desired aircraft would probably not fly much faster, but it would be a lot
kinder to the environment. Among the project's goals are a 90 per cent
reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions and much lower noise levels.
According to its architects, the new aeroplane would also be cheaper than
Concorde, would offer much more passenger space and would be able to travel
far greater distances. Whereas Concorde can only be used for medium hauls,
the new supersonic aircraft would be able to travel from Tokyo to Los
Angeles in only four hours, compared with 10 hours today.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), which runs the
supersonic research project, foresees a large market for the new aeroplane.
According to the agency, as many as 2,000 new supersonic craft may be in use
by 2015, generating sales of at least Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.32bn) for the US
sector.
The research project receives financial and personnel support from aerospace
manufacturers McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, as well as from General Electric
and Pratt &amp; Whitney, which participate in engine development. Established
three years ago, the programme is about to move into its second phase, which
will require the testing of large models in flight simulators.
Much research has focused on new materials to help designers achieve the
desired results. High-speed flights generate a great deal more heat than
that produced by ordinary subsonic craft, for instance.
Part of the project's research concentrates on the use of ceramic matrix
composites and other new materials which can withstand extremely high
temperatures.
'The engine will have to stand temperatures 1,000'F (550'C) higher than the
engine in a normal aircraft,' says Richard Hines, programme manager at Pratt
&amp; Whitney. High-temperature resistance - not only within the engine, but
within the airframe as well - will be essential if the new aircraft is able
to travel the long distances hoped for.
The programme is also working on new materials to increase the temperature
tolerance of the airframe to 175'C. Another priority is the development of a
low-emission engine. The project hopes to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by
90 per cent, in a bid to cut ozone depletion.
The key to this, according to Nasa, is to burn the fuel in a way that avoids
excessive flame temperatures, which produce the offending gas at a high
rate. One possibility is to cool the engine by mixing fuel vapour with air
upstream of the burning zone.
Much of the research into emissions and heat resistance feeds into another
key element of the programme - reducing the high sound levels of supersonic
air transportation. Anyone who has been visually impressed by Concorde in
flight knows the technology's downside - the extremely high noise levels.
The new materials with which Nasa has been experimenting should produce an
aircraft up to 50 per cent lighter, according to Louis Williams, director of
the High-Speed Research Division at NASA. The lower the weight, the less the
drag on the aeroplane and the lower the sound level.
Researchers are also focusing on noise at take-off. The faster the aircraft
reaches high altitudes, the less annoyance it will give to people on the
ground. One possibility is an engine that has a lower jet velocity at
take-off than it does in flight.
Another solution to the noise problem may come from new exhaust nozzle
technology.
'The less thrust we have on take-off, the lower the noise,' says Bruce
Bunin, programme manager at McDonnell Douglas. To reduce the thrust, the new
engine may take in slower-moving air from the outside and mix it with the
high-velocity air of the engine. Without substantial progress on the
environmental front - both in terms of noise levels and emissions - the Nasa
programme may have a short life.
'We're not even going to touch this in the final development stage unless
we're sure it's environmentally sensitive,' says Samuel Gilkey, programme
manager at General Electric. 'If we're restricted from flying into certain
airports for environmental reasons, as happened with the Concorde, we just
won't have a big enough market to make it worthwhile.'
Even if the research yields a relatively low-noise aeroplane, noise
pollution worries make it unlikely that supersonic flights will occur over
land. Still, an easy-listening sonic boom would encourage more airports to
open their runways to over-the-ocean arrivals and take-offs. That and the
added improvements in increased space, price, and lower emissions could make
the final product extremely desirable.
