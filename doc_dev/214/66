   Baring a poorly kept secret, the Pentagon today
made public details of a ``Stealth'' jet fighter that has been ready
for five years to slip behind enemy lines in the event of war.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said the
Stealth fighter first flew in June 1981 and was declared operational
in October 1983.
   The Air Force has ordered 59 of the planes; 52 of them have
already been delivered, he said, adding the plane is a single-seat,
twin-engine aircraft.
   The plane, which in some repsects resembles a small space shuttle
with swept wings and a V-tail, was unveiled primarily because the
Air Force needs to start flying the plane during daylight hours if
it is to integrate the fighter squadron's war plans with other
units, Howard said.
   The plane has been restricted, in the interests of secrecy and
national security, to nighttime flying ever since it was declared
operational, Howard said.
   The Stealth fighter ``is officially known as the F-117A,'' the
spokesman continued.
   ``It has been operational since October 1983 and is assigned to
the 4450th Tactical Group at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev. The
aircraft is based at the Tonopah Test Range Airfield in Nevada.''
   Howard and Air Force officials, while releasing a photo of the
plane in flight, flatly declined to discuss how much the program
cost, the plane's dimensions or general capabilities such as speed,
its assigned combat role, the materials from which it was
constructed and the major subcontractors.
   The plane is built by the Lockheed Corp. at a tightly guarded
plant in Burbank, Calif., the Air Force said. Production line
workers at the Lockheed plant have gone to court with charges they
are being sickened by exposure to dangerous chemicals.
   The service also acknowledged that three of the planes have
crashed. The first production model of the plane crashed with a
Lockheed Corp. pilot at the controls, the Air Force said.
   That test pilot survived the accident, for which no date was
given.
   The second crash occurred on July 11, 1986, near Bakersfield,
Calif., and the third on Oct. 14, 1987, at Nellis Air Force Base,
the service said. Both pilots died in those accidents.
   The decision to unveil the plane was prompted in part by Air
Force plans to display publicly its new B-2 Stealth bomber on Nov.
22, said defense officials who asked not to be named.
   The bomber has been built with more recent and advanced
technology than the fighter, so there was little reason to continue
to hide the fighter, the sources said.
   Pentagon officials also had concluded that even if they wanted to
keep the program secret, upcoming court fights were likely to
shatter security, the sources continued.
   According to military sources, the planes are kept at a high
state of readiness for use as ``aerial shock troops,'' capable of
slipping behind enemy lines without being detected and creating
confusion with unexpected bombing runs.
   The picture released by Howard shows a black or dark blue
metallic aircraft without exterior markings. Unlike the new Stealth
bomber, which is being constructed in the shape of a flying wing
without any sharp edges, the fighter resembles a sleek shuttle with
a small cockpit contained in a nose that comes to a sharp point.
   The two engines are grouped together below the V-shaped tail and
are not visible from the top or sides. The wings are swept to the
rear and appear to be fixed. From some angles, the plane almost
looks like a flying sting ray.
   The picture suggests the plane has been fabricated with some
unusual materials, but the Air Force declined to discuss the matter.
