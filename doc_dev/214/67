   The long-delayed Columbia flight is
commanded by Vance Brand, a veteran of three previous missions and
the oldest person to fly in space.
   Columbia's seven-member crew also includes four astronomers who
will take turns manning the $150 million Astro observatory. The
scientists will operate the observatory's three ultraviolet
telescopes, while an X-ray telescope will be managed by computer
commands from the ground.
   Two crew members are payload specialists, non-space-agency
employees who will help operate the observatory. It is the first
time since the Challenger accident that payload specialists have
flown aboard a shuttle.

   At age 59, Brand is the oldest person to fly in space. He said
Columbia probably will be his last flight.
   ``I'll probably move on to a management job, a second career if
you will, at this late day. But, frankly, there isn't anything that
beats flying in space,'' Brand said in an interview earlier this
year.
   Two other astronauts are older than Brand, but neither has flown
for five or more years.
   Brand joined the astronaut corps in 1966 after serving in the
Marines as a naval aviator and working as a test pilot for Lockheed
Aircraft Corp.
   His three previous trips into space included the historic July
1975 Apollo-Soyuz linkup, the first fully operational shuttle
flight in November 1982 and the 10th shuttle flight in February
1984.
   Although some astronauts have left the highflying career to
assume management roles in the space agency or pursue other
interests, Brand has been happy to stay and wait his turn for
mission assignments.
   ``I suppose a lot of people would do this until their 90 years
old if they could,'' he said.
   But he conceded that the problem now is getting back in the long
line again.
   Brand was born in Longmont, Colo., where he graduated from
Longmont High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in business and
in aeronautical engineering from the University of Colorado and a
master's degree in business administration from the University of
California at Los Angeles.
   He is married and has six children.

   Columbia pilot Guy Gardner, an Air Force colonel, has made one
previous trip into space aboard a secret military flight in
December 1988.
   The flight, the second shuttle mission after the Challenger
accident, carried an all-military crew. This time, Gardner is the
sole active military man among the seven crew members.
   During the 10-day mission, Gardner will steer the shuttle while
two other astronauts on his shift operate the Astro observatory.
The crew is divided into two groups so that work can continue
around the clock.
   Gardner, 42, grew up in Alexandria, Va., where he graduated from
George Washington High School. He earned a bachelor's in
engineering sciences, astronautics and math from the Air Force
Academy and a master's in astronautics from Purdue.
   He flew 177 combat missions in Southeast Asia in the early 1970s
and later attended the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif.
   Gardner was selected as an astronaut in May 1980. He is married
and has three children.
   ``I've wanted to be an astronaut since I was a kid because I've
always been interested in outer space,'' Gardner said.
   In elementary school, he read science fiction books and dreamed
of exploring the heavens. Astronauts then were test pilots, and
that fact guided him during his military career, he said.
   After the Columbia flight, Gardner said, he plans to get back in
line for another mission. He hopes to command a flight.

   Mike Lounge, one of three mission specialists aboard Columbia,
has flown in space twice before, including the first
post-Challenger flight.
   Lounge, the crew's flight engineer, will guide the orbiter 12
hours daily while two astronomers operate the observatory. He also
is trained to perform an emergency spacewalk if necessary.
   Although his pilot duties should keep him busy, Lounge said he
hopes to find some time to look out the window.
   ``You never get tired of that,'' he said.
   Lounge, 44, grew up in Burlington, Colo., and graduated from
Burlington High School. He earned a bachelor's in physics and math
from the Naval Academy and a master's in astrogeophysics from the
University of Colorado.
   He joined the Navy in 1969 and spent the next nine years on
various assignments.
   In 1974, he became a physics instructor at the Naval Academy.
Two years later, he transferred to the Navy Space Project office in
Washington as a staff project officer.
   He resigned his regular Navy commission in 1978 and joined the
Naval Air Reserve. He is a lieutenant colonel in the Texas Air
National Guard.
   Lounge has three children. His wife, Kathryn, is a payload
integration manager at the Johnson Space Center.
   He began working at the space center in 1978 as an engineer and
was selected as an astronaut two years later.
   Lounge first flew into space on a 1985 shuttle flight. Three
years later, he was a crew member aboard the first shuttle to fly
after the Challenger explosion.

   Mission specialist Robert Parker, one of four astronomers on
board who will operate the Astro observatory, is making his second
trip into space. He also flew on the first Spacelab mission in
1988.
   The 53-year-old astronaut said in an interview earlier this year
that the most challenging part of the mission will be to get the
observatory working.
   ``I'm especially looking forward to the fun of going observing
(in space) for a whole week,'' he added.
   Parker was born in New York City but grew up in Shrewsbury,
Mass. He earned a bachelor's degree in astronomy and physics from
Amherst College and a doctorate in astronomy from the California
Institute of Technology.
   After being selected as an astronaut in 1967, he served on
astronaut ground support crews for the Apollo 15 and 17 missions
and as program scientist for the Skylab program director's office.
   For a year beginning in 1988, he was director of the space
flight-space station integration office at NASA headquarters in
Washington.
   He and his wife have four children.
