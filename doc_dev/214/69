   For years, Northrop's chief test pilot
had to contain his enthusiasm for the progress of the top-secret
stealth bomber.
   But Bruce J. Hinds emerged Monday from the cloak of secrecy
surrounding the radar-evading B-2, as the aircraft itself left its
giant hangar and took to the air.
   The pilot, and Air Force test pilot Richard Couch, had high
praise for the arrowhead-shaped plane's handling characteristics.
   ``It was meant to fly,'' Hinds said. ``It likes to fly.''
   Hinds, 50, and the 43-year-old Couch applied terms such as
``nimble'' and ``beautiful'' to their sunrise test flight 10,000
feet above the Mojave Desert.
   For Hinds, a former Air Force test pilot who has flown 66
different aircraft including the U-2 spy plane and the F-104
Starfighter, the flight from a Northrop hangar to nearby Edwards Air
Force Base represented a rendezvous with history.
   ``I had always been fascinated with flying wings,'' Hinds said,
referring to the wing-shaped prototypes built by aviation mavericks
in the 1930s and 1940s on which the B-2 is based.
   The Northrop pilot couldn't indulge his curiosity publicly,
however. Little more than a year ago, the stealth bomber, with a
program price tag of more than $70 billion, did not officially
exist. For a decade, it lurked in the shadows of the Pentagon's
highly classified ``black programs.''
   Since Hinds was the bomber's chief test pilot, he had to maintain
the same vow of secrecy as the 32,000 other workers in the B-2
program.
   ``It's often the case with test pilots that they can't discuss
the airplane they're working on,'' said Northrop spokesman Tony
Cantafio.
   Still, Hinds crossed paths with other fliers at meetings of the
Society of Experimental Test Pilots. There, he listened to pilots
from earlier generations discuss test work from flying wings
conceived before he was born.
   As early as the 1930s, aviation pioneer Jack Northrop was
building such all-wing aircraft. Stubbornly, he contended the wings
had great load-carrying capacity, superior fuel economy and
aerodynamics.
   During World War II, the Germans built prototype all-wing
bombers. Today's B-2 shares an eery resemblance to a Horten bomber
built for the Luftwaffe but never flown in combat. According to
William Sweetman's reference work titled ``Stealth Bomber,'' at
war's end, German designers were working on a six-engine all-wing
jet bomber.
   ``With the flying wing, you get the feeling they should have kept
going,'' Hinds said. ``That whole series of planes was pretty
remarkable for its time.''
   Just as remarkable, Hinds said, is the B-2's advanced computer
controls that keep the flying wing stable in flight without aid of a
tail.
   ``It's like flying a conventional aircraft,'' he said.
