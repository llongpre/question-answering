   Twenty years ago, a delta-winged wonder known as the
Concorde 001 took off on its maiden flight, lifting off gracefully
from an airstrip in southern France and becoming the fastest
commercial jet in the sky.
   About 3,000 people gathered in a hangar on Thursday to toast the
event and to promote plans for a second-generation Concorde to carry
passengers into the 21st century at twice the speed of sound.
   Plans for the new jet were unveiled Wednesday at Aerospatiale
offices in the southern French city of Toulouse. The state-owned
company built the Concorde with British Aerospace.
   Sir Raymond Lygo, chief executive of British Aerospace, and Henri
Martre, president of Aerospatiale, said $555 million in government
backing is being sought for developing the new jet, designed to
carry 280 passengers and travel at 1,550 mph.
   British Airways and Air France each owns seven Concordes, which
can travel up to 1,367 mph and carry 100 to 144 people.
   The new design retains the shape of a sleek bird with a
downturned beak, which many aircraft aficionados call the world's
most beautiful high-flying silhouette.
   Rolls Royce, which provides the engines for the present Concorde
fleet, announced this week it could design a new engine that would
be considerably lighter and greatly increase the range and
efficiency of the jets.
   Those celebrating Thursday included Andre Turcat, the test pilot
who flew the Concorde 001 for 29 minutes over dozens of reporters
and thousands of people who had jammed roads around the airfield to
watch.
   Turcat, later elected mayor of Toulouse, said when he landed,
``And so, at last, the big bird flies, and as you can see, it flies
very well.''
   The British Concorde 002 made its first flight, guided by pilot
Brian Trubshaw, on April 9, 1969.
   Six months later, the plane broke the sound barrier.
   Breaking the profit barrier was another matter.
   Between the first commercial flights in 1976 and 1984, the
jetliner flew in the red.
   The plane was expensive to operate, and Air France lost $24
million between 1976 and 1980. Annual subsidies from Britain to keep
their Concordes aloft were estimated at $30 million yearly.
   Passenger traffic gradually increased. Operations were
streamlined and the Concorde showed its first profit in 1986.
   In 1987, Air France showed a net profit of more than $14.2
million from the Concorde's regular Paris-New York run and from
charter flights. Figures for 1988 are not yet available.
   Last year, 42,379 passengers took the three-hour Paris-New York
flight, which got them to New York two hours before they left.
   The flight is $4,856 round-trip, compared to $3,986 for a
regular, round-trip first-class seat.
   Faced with the early unprofitablity of the jet, the high cost of
fueling it and opposition from environmental groups opposed to the
noise, the United States and other countries chose to stay out of
the supersonic marketplace.
   But if U.S. airlines don't fly the planes, U.S. passengers do.
Air France and British Airways say more than half their clients last
year were Americans.
