`Orel': Will the Space Planes Take Off?"] 
  [Text] According to foreign estimates, by the year 2000, 
the annual volume of the world space market will be about $400 
billion. And commercial, economic, and science-related tasks are 
clearly on the rise, while purely military jobs are being cut 
back. 
  At present, all the space vehicles operating to meet the 
ground's needs -- satellites, stations, modules -- are being 
placed in orbit by expendable launch vehicles developed 30-40 
years ago -- the Soyuz, the Kosmos, and the Proton. Plans are 
also calling for their use in handling the tasks associated with 
the Federal Space Program for the period up to 2000-2005. 
  But what's next? The development of new launch systems 
requires 10-15 years. So the question has to be answered today. 
If another five years or so goes by, the gap between us and our 
competitors will become insurmountable. 
  So, based on worldwide statistics, the cost of using 
expendable launchers to place 1 kg of payload into a low Earth 
orbit 200 km high is $8,000-$10,000. The principal expenses are 
associated with the loss of the launch vehicle structure and 
with the use of expensive launch complexes that are serviced by 
a multitude of technicians. Moreover, the situation with the 
environment is becoming more acute, with the ground and space 
being polluted by the remnants of launch vehicles and 
unrecoverable space vehicles. And if the traffic between ground 
and space grows even more (in the world today, it's growing 5-7 
percent a year), all those problems will snowball, requiring, 
among other things, a further buildup of the industrial 
production of expendable rockets. 
  There is only one way out -- develop and build reusable 
space 
transportation systems for the purpose of cutting the cost of 
transporting cargoes by 5- to 10-fold and eliminating virtually 
all the drawbacks associated with expendable rockets. 
  The scientific-research and experiment work, Orel, which was 
begun in 1993 by the Russian Space Agency, is devoted to that 
very problem. In 1995, the report on the Orel must formulate the 
principal areas of development of Russian space transport. 
  A significant place in the Orel operations is held by 
engines. Of course, as test pilots used to say, even a toilet 
could fly if you put a motor on it. The head organizations for 
"motors" in the Orel project are the Central Institute of 
Aviation Engine Building (TsIAM) and the Scientific Research 
Institute of Thermal Processes. 
  TsIAM is studying what is perhaps the most "avant garde" of 
all of today's versions of space cabs. There, they are 
developing prototypes of engines for aerospace planes -- 
vehicles that take off from an airstrip and ascend into space, 
using only atmospheric oxygen as the jet-engine oxidizer during 
their flight in the atmosphere, just as nonspace planes do. But 
the gas in the combustion chamber of such engines moves at 
supersonic speeds --four to five times faster than the speed of 
sound. And there's no turbocompressor that compresses that air 
-- it shoots directly into the combustion chamber from the air 
intake. Hence the name of these engines -- hypersonic ramjet, or 
scramjet. 
  In providing considerably better performance at high speeds 
of flight -- speeds that are 6-16 times greater than the speed 
of sound -- the scramjets also have their drawbacks: more 
precisely, they create certain problems for the designers. In 
order for a scramjet to start working, the airplane must first 
be accelerated by traditional turbocompressor or rocket engines, 
and, upon leaving the atmosphere, it must again switch engines 
-- to rocket engines that do not need outside air. 
  Thus, an aerospace plane requires the use of a combined 
propulsion system that employs all of the best and the advanced 
in aviation-and rocket-engine-building. By comparison with an 
expendable launch vehicle, an aerospace plane lifting the same 
payload mass will have one-third to one-half the launch mass and 
will be able to take off and land at any time and at any place 
on the globe and will be able to enter orbit with any 
inclination. 
  Russia in the early part of the next century will witness 
the 
take off of its Tu-2000 -- a distant cousin of the supersonic 
Tu-144, a single-stage experimental aerospace plane, and a 
"pioneer" in the field of hypersonic aerospace transport. 
  TsIAM and 14 co-implementer/organizations are performing 
simultaneous design operations and tests of prototypes of 
engines -- stand tests and flight tests. Near Moscow right now, 
in Turayev, renovation is about to be completed on the largest 
test stand in Europe for studying scramjets. New structural 
materials and software are being developed and put on line. 
Flight tests got under way in 1991. 
  It was a long road to the world's first flight of a scramjet 
vehicle -- about 15 years. And the fact that the event finally 
took place is to the great credit of the officials and 
scientists at TsIAM and their colleagues from the experimental 
design bureau and the testing services. 
  At one of the rocket testing grounds in the vicinity of Lake 
Balkhash, the Kholod hypersonic flying laboratory -- a fairly 
small axisymmetric scramjet with its own control system and 
hydrogen tank -- was mounted the top of an Angara S-200 
antiaircraft rocket. As the rocket gained the necessary speed -- 
three to five times the speed of sound -- it switched-on the 
engine, which initially operated with a subsonic stream in the 
combustion chamber and then switched to the scramjet mode. In 
the second set of tests in November 1992, the engine operated 
with the gas in the combustion chamber flowing at a supersonic 
speed for 15 of 37 seconds of functioning. 
  Foreign specialists displayed a lively interest in the 
Balkhash tests. "The Russians are roughly two years ahead of the 
United States in the development of the scramjet," declared 
American expert David Bebb late last year. The French firms that 
joined the consortium HYPERSPACE paid 1 million French francs 
(nearly $180,000) for the right to participate in the second set 
of flight tests in 1992 -- in order to study the results that 
were produced. Using Russia's experience, Aerospatiale, 
Dassault, SEP, Onera, and Snekma are counting on saving 
considerably on the flight-related debugging of future vehicles. 
  And the fact is that in the context of the Orel program, the 
TsIAM people, together with the designers and producers, are 
ready to launch, by 1998, the winged flying laboratory IGLA 
(Russian abbreviation for "hypersonic research vehicle"), which 
will be capable of flying at a speed that is 14 times greater 
than the speed of sound. The building of such a hypersonic 
flying laboratory is expected to make use of a decommissioned 
ballistic missile and involved total spending over a five-year 
period of about 40 billion rubles, at the prices for the first 
quarter of this year. By comparison, when the Americans allocate 
$60 million this year for their X-30, that is generally 
considered simply a civilized form of closing the program. 
  International cooperation is a special issue. The Chinese 
and 
the Germans, the Americans and the French -- all of them want to 
fly "the Russian way." To test promising systems on the unique 
Turayev stands. To get data from the flight experiments. But the 
most important thing still is to deal with the "domestic" 
problems involving future space launchers and high-level 
technologies. To get our bearings with the wings of Orel.
