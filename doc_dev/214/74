  [Text] New York, May 16 (TANJUG) -- NATO planes are 
ignoring earlier warnings and continue provoking and violating 
the Yugoslav air space, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic said in a letter to the U.N. secretary general. A 
NATO reconaissance plane and a bomber violated the Yugoslav air 
space on April 24 in the region of the Perucanlake, western part 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, while similar incidents 
have become an increasing practice, Jovanovic said in the letter 
which was published as an official U.N. document on Monday. 
Jovanovic also warned that NATO aircraft frequently break the 
sound barrier over the rural regions of the Bosnian Serb 
republic (RS) in order to frighten the local population. 
  According to the Yugoslav foreign minister, these incidents 
are the more concerning because the United Nations failed to 
react to earlier Yugoslav warnings and take corresponding steps 
with the NATO command. The continuing provocations and 
violations of the Yugoslav air space pose a serious threat to 
peace and security in the entire region the flagrant violation 
[words indistinct] territorial integrity and sovereignty and a 
direct threat to the peace process which aims to halt the war in 
the ex-Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina, Jovanovic said. 
  I call on you once again to take the corresponding steps 
within the U.N. and in the NATO command to end the dangerous 
provocations, he said. 
  In October 1992 the U.N. Security Council adopted a 
resolution imposing a no-fly zone over Bosnia. Its 
implementation is monitored by the NATO air force.
