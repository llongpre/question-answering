<HEAD>IOUIK, Mauritania: bird islands.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The 28 families of Iouik are shark fishermen. A boat taking
tourists to the bird sanctuaries means a boat that won't catch any
sharks. The bargaining is hard.
   Mohammed Zaidan, captain of the lateen-rigged sailboat, eases his
craft out to sea as one of his two crewmen attends to first things
first _ getting the teakettle on.
   Past the huge Tidra island, Zaidan sails on for two hours to a
series of smaller pieces of land. Flamingos wade offshore. Pelicans
too. Several species of stern, cormorants, sea gulls.
   Landing at the flat, sandy Ner island, covered with scrub
vegetation, a huge flock of spoonbills warily edges away from the
approach of humans. The birds don't fly away, but as the barefoot
visitors quietly make their way across the island, whispering and
snapping photographs, the birds,ff at
6:37 a.m., with two F-16 fighter jets giving chase through the still
and cloudless desert sky.
   It landed here at 8:30 a.m. after performing test maneuvers over
the Mojave Desert. The plane landed perfectly on the runway's center
line at Edwards, where the space shuttles land after returning from
orbit.
   The bat-winged bomber, 69 feet long with a 172-foot wingspan,
quickly rolled to a stop without a wobble or waver, idled for
several minutes and then taxied into a hangar. The B-2 will remain
at Edwards for further tests.
   The plane's landing gear remained down during the flight, as is
standard practice on test flights in case of malfunctions.
   ``We were very pleased with the performance of the aircraft,''
Northrop test pilot Bruce Hinds told a post-flight news conference.
   Co-pilot Air Force Col. Richard Couch, said the plane came
smoothly off the ground, was ``very nimble'' in flight and
``rock-steady'' on landing.
   The pilots said the landing was so smooth they had to ask the
tower if they were down. Tests included three different speeds.
   The stealth bomber's only previous flights have been on a
computer flight simulation; Air Force and Northrop officials say no
other aircraft has been tested more thoroughly without having been
flown.
   The flight was seen as vital for the future of the bomber, which
is already 18 months behind schedule. At a budgeted price of $500
million each _ the Air Force wants 132 of the planes _ it is the
most expensive warplane in history.
   A key congressional committee voted to withhold further funding
until the plane proves itself in the air.
   ``If that plane doesn't fly, the debate is over,'' Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said Friday. ``It is far too
expensive to be a stealth taxi.''
   As the plane took off this morning, the ``Star Spangled Banner''
was sung on the runway by Alis Clausen, a member of the staff of a
local cable TV station. Air Force Capt. Tess Taft unfurled the Stars
and Stripes, which was held by a tearful Linda Tokish.
   Thousands of civilian stealth watchers gathered among the
tumbleweeds outside the Palmdale plant shouted ``Here they come,
here they come!'' as the great flying-wing's dark shadow passed
over. ``Great God,'' exclaimed Northrop employee Les Holland.
   ``I'm shaking. My legs are shaking. It was going right over my
head,'' said Shari Cutler, who came with her four children.
   ``It feels great. It feels just fantastic. A lot of work has gone
into this. Millions of man hours, with people working seven days a
week, 24 hours a day. We feel just great,'' said Air Force Col.
Douglas Kennett.
   ``I was overcome with emotion. I was so thrilled when I saw the
wheels go up. I'm just so excited to know that it's up there now and
I pray that it lands safely,'' Taft said.
   ``This represents the technology of tomorrow,'' said Maj. Pat
Mullaney. ``It gives us the opportunity to stress deterrence. ... It
represents a new generation of technology and it's the way you're
going to see airplanes look tomorrow.''
   The bomber's maiden flight had been scheduled Saturday, but a low
fuel pressure gauge reading aborted the flight.
   After the flight was canceled, workers checked the aircraft and
discovered a problem in a device called the heat exchanger in the
bomber's fuel system. The problem was fixed, but no other details
were available, said Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry Fergeson.
   The B-2 is designed to carry nuclear bombs, and, along with the
conventional B-1, replace the Air Force's aging fleet of B-52
bombers that have formed part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent since
the 1950s.
   So-called stealth technology combines advanced materials and a
special shape to create a plane undetectable by enemy radar. Though
the bomber is still being developed, stealth fighters have operated
several years.
