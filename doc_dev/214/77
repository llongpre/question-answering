   The pilot of a Delta Air Lines flight that
crashed last August near Dallas waited at least 20 seconds after a
stall warning before he applied full power, according to documents.
   The documents made public Monday by the National Transportation
Safety Board pointed to no specific cause for the Aug. 31 crash in
which 14 of the 108 people aboard Flight 1141 were killed.
   The NTSB investigation is not expected to be completed for a
number of weeks.
   According to a transcript of the cockpit voice recorder tape on
Flight 1141, an unusual ``snap'' was heard seconds after liftoff,
followed almost immediately by a vibration of the control column _
a warning of an impending stall.
   A normal procedure for dealing with an impending stall close to
the ground such as in a takeoff would be to apply full power and
attempt to fly out of the problem, according to aviation experts.
   But the transcript showed that Capt. Larry Davis, 48, a veteran
Delta pilot, did not call for ``full power'' until nearly 23
seconds after the first sign of trouble and nearly 20 seconds after
the so-called ``stickshaker'' stall warning.
   The call to full power came as the aircraft was about to crash
and eight seconds after Davis could be heard on the tape saying,
``We're not gonna make it,'' according to the transcript.
   Davis, a 23-year veteran at Delta with 17,000 hours of flying
including 6,500 in a Boeing 727, later told investigators, ``In
retrospect, I should have pushed up full power immediately.''
   A summary of the NTSB interview of Davis from his hospital bed
was included among the documents made public Monday without further
comment by safety board officials.
   The documents provided no apparent clear evidence as to
specifically what caused Flight 1141 not to gain proper lift as it
departed the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. The flight was bound for
Salt Lake City, Utah.
   The investigation continues to focus on the possibility that the
flight crew failed to set the plane's flaps properly, inhibiting
the aircraft's lift. The NTSB previously had said that the wing
flaps were found in a retracted position in the wreckage as was the
cockpit lever controlling the flaps.
   But the cockpit tape transcript shows, as also has been
previously disclosed, that co-pilot Gary Kirkland specifically
acknowledged during a pre-takeoff check that the flaps were in the
proper 15 degree extension _ contradicting evidence in the wreckage.
   But that does not necessarily mean the flaps actually were in
that position, sources close to the investigation have said. Among
the documents released Monday were the results of a sophisticated
sound analysis of the tape to determine whether there were any
background sounds to indicate flaps being extended.
   The tests concluded that after an examination of the entire tape
from Flight 1141 no noise pattern could be found to match the
pattern of flaps actually being set on a test Boeing 727 aircraft.
Two ``click'' sounds heard on the tape did not match the pattern of
an actual setting of flaps on the test plane, the document said.
   Kirkland has told investigators he recalls nothing after the
plane departed from the gate.
   Davis has said he does not know whether the flaps were set
properly, although he recalled Kirkland making the acknowledgment.
A third man in the cockpit, flight engineer Steven Judd, 31, said
he believes that Kirkland set the flaps to their proper setting,
but does not recall actually seeing the flap lever in that position.
   According to the NTSB documents, a takeoff alarm that should
have sounded if the flaps were not properly set, was inspected 20
days before the accident and replaced because the horn was ``weak
and intermittent.'' A new alarm was installed.
   Meanwhile, the cockpit tape, which began shortly before the
aircraft pushed back from the gate, revealed that Flight 1141 had
nearly a 30-minute wait before getting takeoff clearance, during
which much of the time the flight crew _ sometimes with a flight
attendant taking part _ engaged in casual conversation, including a
lengthy exchange about the large number of birds at the Dallas-Fort
Worth airport.
   At one point, the transcript refers to nearly eight minutes of
``nonpertinent conversation'' _ omitted from the transcript _ with
a senior flight attendant. The exchange is cut short when Davis
asks Kirkland about requiring to change frequencies to contact a
second ground controller as the plane moved from the east to the
west side of the airport.
   ``Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sitting here talking to the flight
attendant,'' apologized Kirkland.
   Judd, the flight engineer, later told investigators that when
the plane was third in line for takeoff, he announced the plane
would be taking off soon ``in part because of his concern about the
flight attendant's continued presence in the cockpit,'' one NTSB
document said.
