   The infernal racket of urban life can drive
you crazy, but there's only one person left at the Environmental
Protection Agency who can hear your complaints above the din.
   EPA scientist Kenneth E. Feith is the guy who picks up the phone
and listens to lamentations about noisy trucks and trash
compactors, shrieking jet planes and the banshee howl of the
neighbor's lawnmower.
   Feith, 58, says he is the ``institutional memory'' of the EPA's
Office of Noise Abatement and Control, which once boasted a $10
million budget and more than 100 employees working to make America
quieter and saner.
   The office went out of businesss in 1982, the victim of
President Reagan's budget-cutting deregulation campaign. It now
ranks as a ``non-program'' without budget or staff.
   Feith, who once wrote the EPA's anti-noise regulations, has
other duties today, but he answers a couple of dozen phone calls
about noise pollution every week as a courtesy to the public.
   ``I do this almost out of my hip pocket,'' he says.
   The noise, meanwhile, hasn't gone away. If anything, it's
getting worse. Experts estimate that more than 20 million Americans
are exposed daily to noise loud enough to cause permanent loss of
hearing during a working lifetime.
   That level is above 80 decibels, about the intensity of noise
produced by a vacuum cleaner or electrical tools.
   Studies also show that the stress of loud, sustained noise can
cause high blood pressure, ulcers, headaches, insomnia, respiratory
ailments, learning difficulties among children, job absenteeism,
anxiety, irritability and anti-social behavior.
   If the bells of Notre Dame drove poor Quasimodo nearly mad, the
decibels are still giving us fits. To wit:
   _A 69-year-old man living in a trailer home under a noisy
airport flight path was arrested recently in Llano, Calif., after
he allegedly took a 4-foot mirror outside and tried to blind pilots
with reflected sunlight.
   _An angry Bavarian mounted a catapult in his front yard and
launched his wife's homemade dumplings at low-flying jet fighters
from a nearby military base.
   _A Japanese apartment dweller, distraught that a young girl
ignored his repeated complaints about her loud piano playing, went
next door and stabbed the girl, her sister and her mother.
   _A woman was taken into custody in New York City for allegedly
aiming a double-barreled shotgun at a maintenance worker outside
her window, complaining that he was disturbing her and her pets.
   The aggravation may get worse before it gets better, says Dr.
Alice H. Suter, a research audiologist at the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health and a leading expert on noise
pollution.
   ``My guess is that it's somewhat noisier than it used to be,''
she said in a telephone interview from her office in Cincinnati.
   ``The newly manufactured jet planes and heavy trucks are
quieter, but the overall amount of noise is greater just because
there's more of everything _ construction, planes, traffic,'' she
said.
   Ms. Suter said lack of money has prevented accurate measurement
of increased noise levels. The demise of the EPA's noise office
also meant that the pipeline of federal money for research and
technical assistance to states and localities dried up.
   As a result, only 15 state and local anti-noise programs are
still active, compared with 1,100 in the mid-1970s when noise
pollution was a popular environmental cause.
   The EPA's anti-noise regulations remain in effect for trains,
heavy trucks, railroad coupling and switching equipment, air
compressors, motorcycles and labeling of earplugs, but there's
virtually no one to enforce them.
   Meanwhile, despite improved truck exhaust mufflers and highway
sound barriers, vehicular traffic still ranks as the worst
offender. Another source of potentially damaging noise is the
typical American home with its leaf blowers, mowers, power tools,
food blenders, dishwashers and laundry machines, Feith said.
   The experts say noise pollution is easily ignored in an
industrial society concerned with oil spills, garbage, smog and
other more visible forms of pollution, but they say it is no less
hazardous to health.
   ``There's never been a Greenpeace or a Sierra Club for noise,''
Feith said.
   ``People don't get as excited about noise as they do about
cancer-causing agents in the environment. Noise doesn't leave
bodies in the streets. But it can cause physical, emotional and
psychological effects that are just as debilitating.''
