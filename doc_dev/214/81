   Here are brief sketches of the five
military astronauts assigned to Atlantis:
   NAVY CMDR. ROBERT L. GIBSON: Commander. Gibson also commanded
Columbia on a January 1986 flight that was the last mission before
the Challenger explosion and was a pilot aboard Challenger on his
first flight in February 1984.
   Gibson, 42, was born in Cooperstown, N.Y., but considers
Lakewood, Calif., his hometown. He graduated from California
Polytechnic State University with a degree in aeronautical
engineering.
   In 1969, Gibson entered active duty with the Navy and later flew
combat missions in Southeast Asia. He was selected as an astronaut
in January 1978.
   Gibson is married to Dr. Rhea Seddon, who also is an astronaut
and has flown on one previous shuttle flight. He has two children,
Julie 12, and Paul, 6.
   He is a member of an all-astronaut rock 'n' roll band called
MAX-Q, the abbreviation for the point in the shuttle's ascent when
aerodynamic stress is at its maximum. The band does informal gigs in
the Clear Lake area south of Houston.

Alexandria, Va., his hometown. He received a bachelor's degree in
engineering sciences, astronautics and mathematics from the U.S. Air
Force Academy, and a master's degree in astronautics from Purdue
University.
   He flew 177 combat missions in Southeast Asia in 1972 while
stationed in Thailand and later was an Air Force test pilot and an
instructor test pilot.
