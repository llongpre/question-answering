   The Air Force on Wednesday grounded the
nation's fleet of B-1B long-range bombers for a precautionary safety
inspection following a crash of one of the new planes in Texas.
   The Strategic Air Command, which is responsible for land-based
nuclear bomber and missile forces, said the order to suspend flying
was a ``normal precaution'' in the wake of a major accident.
   The flight suspension order will be followed within the next day
or two by specific instructions to B-1B mechanics on what aircraft
systems they must inspect, said Lt. Col. George H. Peck, a spokesman
at SAC headquarters in Omaha, Neb.
   Those instructions will probably reflect the suspicions of the
official board of inquiry that is investigating Tuesday's crash of a
B-1B near Dyess Air Force Base, Texas.
   Peck said he did not know which systems would be checked and
would not speculate on the cause of the crash.
   ``But the inspection is expected to require two to four hours per
aircraft,'' he said. ``This is a one-time special inspection.''
   At Dyess, training flights continued throughout the day
Wednesday. Officials there said the planes had passed the inspection
ordered by the Strategic Air Command.
   Eyewitnesses to Tuesday's crash have said they saw smoke and fire
trailing an engine on the plane. All four crewmen managed to eject
safely from the stricken bomber, which then crashed in a field
outside Abilene, Texas.
   ``The headquarters of SAC has ordered a one-time safety
inspection as a normal precaution,'' Peck said. ``Once the
inspection is completed, the aircraft will return to flying status.''
   The spokesman said the flight suspension order would not affect
the B-1B's currently standing alert, ready for immediate takeoff in
the event of nuclear war.
   In Texas, the Air Force set up a roadblock to seal off the crash
site Wednesday and sent in military investigators, who spent the day
mapping the area and searching through debris.
   The wreckage was scattered over an area seven miles by two miles,
said Al Dostal, an Air Force spokesman.
   Tuesday's crash was the second involving a production-model B-1B
in 14 months, leaving the Air Force with 98 of its original 100
planes.
   The bombers have been deployed at four bases: Dyess; Ellsworth
AFB, S.D.; Grand Forks AFB, N.D., and McConnell AFB, Kan.
   In Omaha, Peck said the vice commander of the 28th Bombardment
Wing at Ellsworth, Col. David C. Dill, has been named to head the
crash investigation.
   The spokesman added the board of inquiry already had begun
interviewing the crewmen at Dyess.
   The Air Force has said the plane's pilot, Capt. Michael E.
Waters, elected to stay with the burning bomber after his three
crewmen ejected to ensure the plane came down in an unpopulated area.
   The four-engine, swing-wing B-1B is the first new addition to
America's manned bomber force in more than 25 years. The plane is
designed to fill the gap between the aging fleet of B-52 bombers and
the new B-2 ``Stealth'' bomber, which is to be publicly unveiled
later this month.
   The Air Force lost the first of the B-1Bs on Sept. 28, 1987, when
a plane based at Dyess ran into a flock of migrating pelicans during
a low-level bomb run at a Colorado flight range. Three crew members
were killed.
   Earlier, before production-model planes entered the inventory,
the Air Force lost a B-1A prototype in August 1984 during a test
flight at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. One crewman died and two
were injured.
   The bomber, built by the Rockwell International Corp., has a
maximum speed of about 1,000 mph and a range of more than 7,000
miles. It is smaller than the older B-52 but capable of carrying
more bombs, and already holds a number of world aviation speed
records for a plane of its size.
   The B-1B is designated as ``a low-altitude penetrator,'' meaning
it is expected to fly at almost the speed of sound at altitudes of
only 200 feet. During a nuclear war, the B-1B would be the bomber
expected to actually fly missions inside the Soviet Union.
   The Air Force has been criticized over the past two years for its
handling of the B-1B program, primarily because of acknowledged
problems in developing the bomber's radar-jamming gear. However, the
service insists the plane is still the best long-range bomber in the
world.
