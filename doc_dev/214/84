<LEADPARA>  Mountain View city staff will continue researching possible solutions to sound
problems at Shoreline Amphitheater with an eye toward implementing a noise
reduction plan before the outdoor arena opens its 1992 season.;   Even so, the
possibility the city will be able to completely eliminate noise coming from
the amphitheater remains questionable. City staff members have identified
three ways that sound from the amphitheater can be completely eliminated --
none of which they consider practical.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Two of the alternatives -- building a dome around the facility or rotating
the amphitheater's stage so that it faces the bay -- are too costly, police
chief Brown Taylor said. At the most extreme, the amphitheater could be shut
down.;   In a marathon session Tuesday night, the city council gave staff
members the go-ahead to continue examining solutions and asked that they
return to the council with their findings Jan. 26.;   Tuesday night's decision
was the first public action the council has taken since angry Palo Alto
residents in September formed a coalition to protest noise coming from
Shoreline Amphitheater.;   Members of the Abate Shoreline Amphitheater Noise
Coalition, mostly residents of the Northeast Palo Alto area, claimed music
from the outdoor facility could be heard in their backyards. The sound, they
said, shook their houses, disturbed their sleep and endangered their
well-being. In late October, trustees of the Palo Alto Unified School District
wrote a letter to the Palo Alto City Council after parents complained that
noise from the amphitheater kept their children awake at night.;   Tuesday
night was also the first time the city council has met face-to-face with
residents on the issue. Coalition members as well as other concerned citizens
crowded council chambers for their chance to speak. It was a long wait. A
heavy agenda pushed discussion on the Shoreline issue back until 11:30 p.m.;  
Once discussion began, it was almost as if it would never stop. For two hours
the council sat, listened and sometimes yawned as person after person stood
before them at the wooden podium.;   Some demanded Mountain View do something
quickly to solve the problem.;   "The noise is an issue," said Palo Alto
resident Todd Smith, whose teen-age son could not do his homework one night
because of concert noise.;   "It's like a pounding headache that just doesn't
go away," insisted Palo Altan Sharon Taylor.;   Palo Alto Mayor Jack Sutorius
urged the council to take action and exercise the authority it has over the
amphitheater.;   Others, like Mary Aharon, also of Palo Alto, insisted a big
deal was being made out of nothing.;   "They're a vocal minority and they
don't represent the majority," she said about the coalition. "I like Shoreline
and I'm glad it's here.";   In the end though, nothing was really said that
hadn't been said before.;   And members of the Mountain View council, not all
of whom have yet spoken publicly about their views on the Shoreline issue,
declined to Tuesday night, citing the late hour of the meeting, which ended at
almost 1:30 a.m.;   Shoreline management and the Mountain View City Council
took several steps earlier this year to "turn down the volume" at Shoreline. A
98-decibel limit was set on concerts, amplifiers were changed and speakers
were strategically re-aimed.;   For a time, it seemed the new measures were
working. Noise complaints were at their lowest number since the amphitheater
opened in 1986. In September, however, complaints rose dramatically due in
part to a weather phenomenon known as the inversion layer.;   The inversion
layer acts as a sound barrier, trapping sound waves below a cool air mass,
bouncing them into Palo Alto neighborhoods. The weather phenomenon occurs
chiefly in the late summer months and early fall. Shoreline officials have
long blamed the weather for the noise problem, claiming that even the quietest
concert could be heard if the inversion layer were low enough.  </TEXT>
