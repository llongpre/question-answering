   The SR-71 Blackbird spy plane ended its
last flight today, apparently shattering at least three air-speed
standards as it crossed the continent on its way to museum display.
Initial calculations put its flight time at 68 minutes and 32
seconds.
   The aircraft, to be displayed by the Smithsonian Institution,
touched down at Washington Dulles International Airport at 10:50
a.m. EST, said Jack Weir of the airport operations office.
   The aircraft had taken off in a fiery blast from its Mojave
Desert airfield at Air Force Plant 42 at 4:30 a.m. PST, or 7:30
a.m. EST. After flying over California for a time, it took on fuel
before officially beginning its flight, and landed at the airport
some 20 miles outside Washington, D.C.
   Weir said officials were still determining whether the spy
plane, which is being mothballed because of budget cuts, broke four
records as intended. ``They're still computing all that,'' said
Weir just after the landing.
   ``Unofficially, it set at least three records,'' Weir said. One
was fastest transcontinental flight, he said. It was not
immediately known what the other two were. Weir said the flight
time was initially determined to be 68 minutes, 32 seconds.
   ``It was awesome,'' said Air Force Col. Tom Hornung of the
liftoff. ``It was a fitting end to a great Air Force program.''
   Flying the ominous-looking black plane were pilot Lt. Col.
Raymond E. Yeilding and his reconnaissance systems officer, Lt.
Col. J. D. Vida.
   At speeds exceeding Mach 3, or three times the speed of sound,
the crew planned to attempt four speed records on the way.
   The crew was trying to best a world record from Los Angeles to
Washington, a world record from Kansas City to Washington, a world
record from St. Louis to Cincinnati and a national record from the
West Coast to the East Coast. Any records must be certified by the
Federation Aeronautique International.
   The Blackbird spy plane was a successor aircraft to the U-2 spy
plane, one of which was shot down on a spying mission over the
Soviet Union during the Eisenhower administration.
   The Blackbird, the world's fastest operational aircraft, has
never been shot down, although it has collected virtually tons of
raw intelligence data from world hot spots during its 25-year
service life.
   Pilots flying SR-71s already hold the world absolute records for
speed, 2,193 mph, and altitude, 85,069 feet.
   After congressional debate late last year, Congress decided to
go along with an Air Force request to mothball the Blackbird fleet.
The Air Force contended that the program was too expensive compared
to other budget priorities, such as the B-2 stealth bomber. It also
hopes to develop a new generation of fighter aircraft for the 21st
century.
   The Blackbird planes remained popular with congressional
intelligence committees and with other consumers of intelligence
such as the CIA and the State Department. The spy plane program has
been carried as part of the Air Force budget.
