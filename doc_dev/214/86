   Scientists at the University of Texas at
Arlington are putting final touches on a new high-speed wind tunnel
that is intended to boost the development of commuter space travel.
   The facility, expected to be in use next month, is being built
to support development of the National Aero-Space Plane, an
experimental aircraft being designed by government and industry
scientists to fly at up to 25 times the speed of sound.
   The aircraft would be able to take and land at conventional
airports, using air-breathing engines to climb through most of the
atmosphere and then switching to rockets to reach Earth orbit.
   Supporters believe the program will eventually lead to aircraft
that can fly from one side of the globe to the other in two or
three hours.
   The speed of sound is about 761 mph at sea level, and officials
say the UT-Arlington wind tunnel will generate brief bursts of air
up to 18 times that fast, far faster than most conventional test
facilities and far greater than the top speeds of conventional
aircraft.
   Frank Lu, an assistant professor of aerospace engineering at
UTA, said scientists will use the wind tunnel to conduct basic
research to see how air flows around aircraft that travel at
hypersonic speeds, five times the speed of sound or more.
   ``With hypersonic, we really don't know too much,'' Lu said.
``We know the interactions will be very severe.''
   The research and development phase of the space-plane program is
expected to run through 1992, when federal officials will decide
whether to build two test planes.
   The new wind tunnel at UT-Arlington cost $200,000, not including
about $150,000 worth of test-chamber equipment donated by the LTV
Corp., according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
