   Country singer Johnny Cash ended a
three-city South Dakota tour here with an unwelcome non-musical
sidekick _ the hiccups.
   ``This is an all-time first for me,'' Cash told his audience in
the Corn Palace. ``It's the first time I've done a show with the
hiccups.''
   Cash, who also had a recent bout with the flu, sipped water
during Sunday afternoon's performance. He even left the stage for a
short time to try unsuccessfully to get rid of his hiccups.
   He and his wife, June Carter Cash, performed to the audience of
2,000 for about two hours.

   Doctors removed singer Dennis Day
from the critical list after he responded to treatment for a head
injury he suffered last week in a fall at home.
   His condition was upgraded to serious Monday after surgery
Saturday relieved swelling of the brain, said Armen Markarian,
spokesman for St. John's Hospital.
   Day, 71, was diagnosed last July as suffering from amyotropic
lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, a progressive nerve
disorder that causes loss of muscle control.
   Day became famous by performing with comedian Jack Benny
starting in 1939. An accomplished Irish tenor, Day also was known
for playing the innocent foil to Benny's irascible character on
television and radio.

   The Rev. Allan Boesak, an anti-apartheid leader,
says productions such as the movie ``Cry Freedom'' and the musical
``Sarafina'' play important roles in publicizing the struggle of
blacks in his native South Africa.
   ``You cannot reach everybody by making a speech, or even by
saying something on television,'' Boesak said in an interview in
April's Essence magazine.
   ``Some other people are more convinced by reading a book, by
meeting someone face to face, by seeing a play, by seeing a movie.
I believe that if you get all these different audiences, and you
speak to them in a medium that they can understand, then so much
the better.''
   Boesak, 41, is a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church and
president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. Under South
Africa's racially restrictive laws, which reserve most power for
the white minority, he is considered of mixed race.
   The magazine said writer and former Black Panther leader Elaine
Brown interviewed Boesak when he and his wife, Dorothy, and four
children were in Los Angeles recently.

   Having a newborn baby won't keep
three-time Grammy-winner Deniece Williams from the recording
studio, her publicist says.
   Miss Williams, 35, who gave birth Saturday, is planning to
record an album next month, press agent Bob Angelotti says.
   ``Mother and child are doing fine'' but will remain in the
hospital for several days, he said.
   Forrest Matthew Westering, who weighed 9 pounds, 3 ounces at
birth, is the first child for the singer and her husband, Brad
Westering, who were married in 1986. Miss Williams has two children
from a previous marriage.
   Miss Williams began her career as a backup singer for Stevie
Wonder. In 1978, she recorded a No. 1 single, ``Too Much, Too
Little, Too Late,'' with Johnny Mathis. She recently won her third
Grammy, best female gospel performance, for ``I Believe in You'' on
the album ``Water Under the Bridge.''

   Retired Brig. Gen. Chuck Yeager, the first
man to fly faster than the speed of sound, will drive the pace car
in the 1988 Indianapolis 500, race officials say.
   The announcement was made Monday at a ceremony in which General
Motors officials presented the keys for 66 black 1988 Cutlass
Supremes to Speedway president Joe Cloutier. The cars are replicas
of the open-top Cutlass that will pace the 72nd Indianapolis 500 on
May 29.
   Yeager, who retired from active duty in the Air Force in 1975,
set his flight speed record on Oct. 14, 1947. He works as a
consultant test-pilot for Northrop Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp.
and the flight test center at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   Yeager also drove the pace car in the 1986 Indy 500.
