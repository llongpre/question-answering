   Discovery's astronauts, working again
at full electrical power, received a call from President Bush and
focused cameras on the wounds inflicted on Earth by man's pollution
and nature's violence.
   Flying upside down 180 miles high, the five-man crew captured
thousands of views of Earth with television, movie and still
cameras. Some of the film will be edited into a study of ecological
trouble spots.
   The president and the crew talked briefly in a combined
television-telephone hookup that let Bush see the astronauts in
their space cabin from the White House.
   Bush congratulated them on their flight _ which nearly had to be
cut short one day because of an electrical-system problem _ and
said, ``I am determined to go forward with an active space program.''
   When Discovery commander Michael L. Coats revealed that the crew
was ``flying something for the new first lady'' it prompted a
presidential invitation.
   ``You better come up here and give it to her personally,'' said
Bush. ``You're invited. When you get back head this way.''
   Asked about a camera used to photograph environmental targets,
pilot John E. Blaha said the crew was ``getting a lot of great film
that will show a lot of people around the world how fragile the
planet Earth is in this big vastness of space.''
   ``There is so much interest today on the global environment,''
replied Bush. ``I think a lot of people will see from just your
important mission the contribution that space exploration can make
to the world's environment.''
   Discovery's crew started the day by pre-empting the usual wake-up
call from Mission Control with tape recordings of their own. They
ended their eight-hour sleep by radioing to Earth the theme music
from ``Star Trek.''
   Then, the recorded voice of William Shatner, who played Capt.
Kirk in ``Star Trek,'' sent congratulations to Mission Control.
   ``Discovery,'' responded a Mission Control communicator, ``tell
Scotty to beam me up.''
   A rousing medley of school songs from the alma maters of the crew
members was the official wake up sound from Mission Control.
   The tape included ``Anchor's Aweigh'' for Naval Academy graduates
Michael L. Coats, James A. Buchli and Robert C. Springer; ``Wild
Blue Yonder'' for Air Force Academy graduate John E. Blaha, and the
Drexel University fight song for Dr. James P. Bagian, a physican who
earned a bachelor's degree from the Philadelphia school.
   Their fourth day in orbit was the first with a trouble-free
electrical power supply system. On Wednesday, they followed special
operating instructions from Mission Control to correct an erratic
flow from a hydrogen tank that supplies reactant to chemical power
generators on the shuttle.
   Flow from the tank became troublesome shortly after Discovery was
launched Monday and Mission Control feared that fuel from the tank
would not be available for use. Engineers asked the astronauts to
dim lights and turn off computers, and said the five-day mission
could be cut short a day if the problem wasn't corrected.
   The fuel cells on the shuttle combine hydrogen and oxygen to make
electricity and pure water.
   Discovery became an orbiting movie studio for part of today. The
astronauts were using a 70mm camera to take high fidelity pictures
of environmental targets on Earth for a joint project of the
Smithsonian Institution and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Photo targets included a coral reef being destroyed by pollution
off east Africa, the scars left by fires in Florida's Everglades and
the forests of the western United States, areas of deforestation in
South Americas and an active volcano in Guatamala.
   ``We got plenty of shots of Florida,'' Bagian reported. ``And we
got some very good pictures of Hawaii.''
   The astronauts also aimed cameras at Indonesian volcanos, the
Great Barrier Reef off Australia, the Andes Mountains in South
America, the Aswan Dam in Egypt and the Baja California portion of
Mexico.
   Mission Control remotely operated television cameras on Discovery
to capture startling views of lightning playing across the skies
over South America and Australia.
   From the Discovery's camera perch, the lightning could be seen
bursting like a string of flashing white lights on a Christmas tree.
Earlier studies from space have shown that lightning bolts seem to
trigger each other in sequence along the front of a moving
thunderstorm.
   The astronauts also tended to their strange collection of
orbiting companions _ four crippled rats, 32 fertilized chicken eggs
and a miniature plot of plants _ that are among the experiments
aboard.
   Four caged rats with intentionally injured bones are being flown
to test how weightlessness can affect healing.
   The chicken eggs will be examined after Discovery lands to
determine how weightlessness affect the embryo development and a
similar study is being made on the roots of a group of plants
growing in a box on board.
   The flight is the first of the year and NASA hopes to have six
more as the agency builds toward a planned one-a-month flight rate
within two years. The mission is third since U.S. flights resumed
following the 1986 accident that destroyed space shuttle Challenger
and killed seven astronauts.
   The astronauts accomplished the main goal on its first day of the
flight _ deploying a $100 million communications satellite. The
satellite is in a high orbit where it completes a network NASA will
use to link communications with shuttles and other satellites.
   The mission is scheduled to end Saturday at Edwards Air Force
Base in California.
