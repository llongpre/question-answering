   Air Force Col. Richard Covey
expects to be flooded with memories of the Challenger astronauts
when he climbs aboard Discovery for the first shuttle launch in
more than 2{ years.
   ``I'm sure as I crawl in, I'll think about the crew crawling
into the orbiter and strapping in and sitting on the launch pad _
what they were thinking, what they were doing,'' said the veteran
astronaut who was picked to pilot Discovery.
   Covey, a former Air Force fighter and test pilot, also guided
Discovery three years ago on a mission billed by NASA as its most
successful flight yet. He said he is confident the upcoming mission
also will be a success but realizes his family is concerned because
of what happened to Challenger.
   ``It would be strange for them not to be. The last time anybody
saw a space shuttle come off the launch pad it blew up,'' Covey
said. ``You don't forget about it.''
   And the 42-year-old Covey said he too will reflect on the
Challenger astronauts.
   ``I'll also be knowing that they would be pleased that we have
gotten back to the point where we are going to fly again.''
   His wife, Kathleen, a real estate agent, and daughters Sarah,
14, and Amy, 12 will attend the launch.
   Coping with the risks of space flight at the Covey household
doesn't involve a lot of talk about it, he said.
   ``They understand that I do these types of things because I want
to do them and that's what makes me the type of person that I am
and they don't really question that.''
   Recently, the five Discovery astronauts talked to dozens of
reporters at the Johnson Space Center for their final news
conference before the flight. But Covey said the ``big'' event that
day was a volleyball game, the season opener for his daughter's
team. They won.
   ``I was there, I made it,'' he added, smiling.
   Covey was born in Fayetteville, Ark., and grew up in Fort Walton
Beach, Fla. His late father was an Air Force lieutenant colonel.
   He earned a bachelor's degree from the U.S. Air Force Academy in
1968 and a master's in aeronautics and astronautics from Purdue
University a year later.
   While in the Air Force, Covey flew 339 combat missions during
two tours in southeast Asia. He has flown more than 4,000 hours in
more than 25 different types of aircraft.
   He was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1978. During his
other shuttle mission, the crew deployed three communications
satellites and repaired an ailing satellite.
   ``I fully intend to stay around and fly as a commander if I get
that opportunity,'' Covey said.
   Although there will be plenty of work to do on the flight, the
astronauts also get a chance to relax.
   ``There's a lot of time for looking out the window,'' he said.
``I just look out a lot (at Earth). That's where the real scenery
is.''
