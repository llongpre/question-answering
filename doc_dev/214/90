   The pilot of an Aloha Airlines jetliner
that blew open at 24,000 feet landed safely even though he had lost
power in one engine and had no indication the nose wheel was down,
a federal investigator said.
   The pilot also was not able to lower the plane's flaps, used to
slow the craft, into normal landing position, so he touched down at
Kahului Airport at a speed of about 195 mph and braked heavily,
investigator Joseph Nall said late Saturday. Normal landing speed
is 155 mph, he added.
   The plane, with 89 passengers, five crew members and an air
traffic controller aboard, was on an inter-island hop from Hilo to
Honolulu Thursday when 20 feet of its upper fuselage peeled away
explosively.
   Flight attendant Clarabelle Lansing, 57, apparently was sucked
from the cabin to her death and 61 others were injured.
   Seven passengers remained at Maui Memorial Hospital Sunday in
stable condition with burns and lacerations, nursing supervisor
Beverly Perreira said.
   Meanwhile Sunday, a Coast Guard helicopter search for the
missing chunk of fuselage in waters off the Maui coast failed to
find any trace of the wreckage, Coast Guard spokesman Dan
Waldschmidt said.
   ``We believe there's a good chance the piece in almost it's
entirety is floating in the ocean,'' Mike Benson, spokesman for the
National Transportation and Safety Board, said earlier.
   Federal investigators have focused on possible structural
failure in the aging Boeing 737 as a cause of the accident.
   Nall, of the NTSB, said at a news conference that investigators
have begun looking at the plane's maintenance records and have
asked Boeing for all safety advisories issued for that model.
   Boeing had issued five service bulletins, including one in
April, warning airlines to check 737s for corroding fasteners that
hold pieces of the fuselage together, company officials said.
   Last Oct. 5, the FAA ordered close inspection of the upper skin
of the early model Boeing 737s because routine inspections had
turned up cracks near where sections of sheet metal overlap,
officials said Friday. The agency warned the problem could cause
rapid cabin decompression, they said.
   Stephanie Ackerman, an Aloha Airlines spokeswoman, said
inspections carried out because of the FAA order turned up nothing
unusual.
   The Federal Aviation Administration barred the oldest versions
of the 737 from flying above 23,000 feet if they have had more than
55,000 landings. The Aloha jet had logged between 85,000 and 90,000
landings.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the order would affect 66 planes
in the 737-100 and 737-200 series. The jets are operated by Aloha,
Piedmont and American airlines, he said.
   Aloha grounded its three planes affected by the order and was
forced to cancel 30 to 40 flights a day, or 20 percent to 25
percent of its schedule.
   According to interviews with the flight crew that were released
Saturday, the craft was traveling at 322 mph to 333 mph with the
first officer, Mimi Tompkins, at the controls, Nall said.
   Suddenly the crew heard a ``whooshing'' sound, Nall said, and
Capt. Robert Schornstheimer took over the controls as the crew
donned oxygen masks.
   The plane bounced as it began its emergency descent, he said.
There was so much noise in the cockpit that Schornstheimer and
Tompkins had to use hand signals to communicate, he added.
   The jet's left engine had no power when the plane began to slow
to 195 mph, and Schornstheimer found the plane became unstable if
it went any slower, Nall said.
   Schornstheimer decided to land the plane even though a green
light that indicates when the nose wheel is down did not function,
Nall said.
   An inspection of the interior of the Aloha jet found no traces
of a fire, and none of the crew or passengers interviewed reported
seeing a fire or smelling smoke, Nall said.
   Overall, however, ``the airplane was extensively damaged,'' Nall
said. ``Few aircraft with damage that extensive have ever been
landed safely.''
   Nall said five beams that run across the width of the plane and
support the floor of the passenger cabin were broken. The beams
carry cables that control the wings and tail of the plane, and one
of those cables also was broken, Nall said.
