   Mark Lee first thought about being
an astronaut when he was a third-grader, growing up in small-town
Wisconsin. The Air Force major is the only space rookie aboard
Atlantis.
   Lee is a mission specialist, whose responsibility was ejecting
the Magellan probe from the shuttle's cargo bay.
   After training at NASA for five years, the 36-year-old astronaut
said he didn't really expect any surprises on launch day.
   Lee was born in Viroqua, Wis., where his parents still live.
He's became the hometown hero, and his name dominated posters,
billboards and T-shirts as residents awaited the shuttle launch.
   He invited about 150 Wisconsin friends and relatives to Cape
Canaveral for his first liftoff. Among those watching were his
wife, Diedre, who is in charge of shuttle procurement at the
Johnson Space Center.
   Lee hopes to stay at NASA long enough to help build the planned
space station, walk in space and fly a high-inclination orbit so he
can ``look down on Wisconsin,'' he said in a pre-flight interview.

   Astronaut Mary Cleave, an environmental engineer making her
second shuttle flight, will serve as a kind of ``test case'' as the
smallest person so far to use the new, heavy escape suits
astronauts must wear during launch and landing.
   The bright orange suit added about 90 pounds to the 5-foot-2,
103-pound astronaut.
   She bristled at suggestions she was blazing any new trail as the
first female astronaut to fly since Challenger.
   ``The reason I get irritated ... is that it tends to negate all
the work that women have been doing up to this point,'' she said in
a pre-flight interview.
   Ms. Cleave, 42, graduated from high school in Great Neck, N.Y.,
and received her bachelor's degree from Colorado State University
in 1969. She earned a master's in 1975 and a doctorate in 1979 from
Utah State University.
   She worked as a researcher at the Ecology Center and the Utah
Water Research Laboratory at Utah State from September 1971 to June
1980. She is single, lives with several dogs and cats and is an
outdoor enthusiast.
   Ms. Cleave took a banner for the 4-H of America to replace the
one that astronaut Ellison Onizuka took with him on the Challenger
flight.

   Norman Thagard, who has flown on two previous shuttle flights,
is the Atlantis flight engineer and an enthusiastic supporter of
NASA's unmanned space missions such as the Magellan probe to Venus.
   ``We do these things (planetary missions) to learn more about
ourselves and our own planet,'' Thagard said in a pre-flight
interview. ``Are there some lessons that we can learn from Venus
that will help us? Those are the questions we'll learn from the
planetaries.''
   Thagard, 45, received a doctor of medicine degree from the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. He and his wife,
Rex, have three sons.
   In 1966, he entered the Marines Corps Reserve and became a
captain. He flew 163 combat missions in Vietnam. On his first
shuttle mission in June 1983 he conducted various medical tests and
collected data on physiological changes in astronauts.

   Navy Capt. David Walker, 44-year-old commander of the Atlantis
mission, said deployment of the Magellan probe is an essential step
in the quest to explore other planets.
   ``There are probes that can do things that we cannot,'' Walker
said in a pre-flight interview. ``We'll go where these probes have
gone one of these days if we do it right.
   ``And I think it's inevitable that we must. We can't continue to
deplete the resources of this planet and not find some other place
to get resources.''
   The Vietnam-era fighter pilot looked forward to getting back
into space.
   ``It's been a long time coming. It's such a marvelous feeling to
be up there,'' said Walker, who first flew on a shuttle as pilot of
a flight that launched in November 1984.
   He and his wife, Stacy, have two sons.
   Walker took with him several items for friends he met while on a
trip to the Soviet Union, including a picture of Yuri Gagarin, the
Soviet cosmonaut who was the first person to fly in space.

   Air Force Col. Ronald Grabe, an astronaut for nearly eight
years, was making his second shuttle flight as the pilot of
Atlantis.
   Grabe, 43, was born in New York and graduated from high school
there. He received a bachelor's degree from the U.S. Air Force
Academy in 1966 and studied aeronautics as a Fulbright scholar in
Darmstadt, West Germany.
   He flew 200 combat missions in Vietnam and was a test pilot for
the A-7 and F-111 aircraft. His first shuttle flight was as pilot
of Atlantis on its inaugural mission in 1985.
   He and his wife, Marijo, have two daughters.
   The Atlantis mission's primary goal, to deploy the Magellan
probe that later will map the surface of Venus, should yield a
``bonanza'' of information to scientists, he said in a pre-flight
interview.
   ``I think it's important that we get this sort of an effort back
off the ground,'' Grabe said. ``It's an area in which the United
States has been at the forefront and we need to maintain our
leadership role in planetary science.''
