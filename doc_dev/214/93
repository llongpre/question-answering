   Unlike an airplane that
can circle an airport for hours, when the shuttle glides to Earth
without power, it gets only one chance to land.
   ``There's no opportunity to go around. You've got to hit it the
first time,'' said Bob Evans, chief of the Air Force research
projects office at this Mojave Desert military base, 80 miles
northeast of Los Angeles where Discovery was to end its four-day
mission at 9:37 a.m. PDT today.
   The task of landing begins half a world away from Edwards Air
Force Base, and re-entry could result in the orbiter burning up in
the atmosphere if it is done incorrectly.
   Here is how NASA says a textbook landing would progress:
   After the astronauts have put on their new emergency escape
suits, the pilot positions the shuttle upside-down and tail-first.
He then fires small rockets in what is called the ``deorbit burn''
an hour before landing. Flight computers fire other thrusters to
flip the shuttle forward again for re-entry.
   The computer guidance system helps keep the shuttle at the
proper angle for re-entry, and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration also has modified Discovery's heat-shielding tiles
and blankets to improve the craft's ability to withstand heat.
   Once the shuttle descends to 75 miles above Earth's surface, it
enters the atmosphere at about 25 times the speed of sound. It is
then about 5,000 miles west of Edwards Air Force Base.
   The pilot monitors computer controls to perform ``energy
management,'' which means making S-turns and other maneuvers to
reduce the shuttle's speed as it approaches the landing site, said
Milt Thompson, chief engineer for NASA's Dryden Flight Research
Facility here.
   ``If he doesn't control his energy accurately enough he may
overshoot Edwards and not have a place to land or undershoot and
land in the water,'' Thompson said.
   Heat from re-entry ionizes atoms of air around the shuttle when
it is about 50 miles above the Earth and about 25 minutes before
landing. That has the effect of blacking out ground-to-shuttle
communications for about 13 minutes until the orbiter is 30 miles
above the planet and heading toward the California coast.
   Once it descends to about 10 miles altitude, thrusters no longer
can move the orbiter, so control depends on flaps, rudders and
speed brakes, which are run by a hydraulic system powered by three
auxiliary power units, or APUs.
   According to a study by an engineering consulting firm
commissioned by NASA and McDonnell Douglas Corp., there is a
one-in-70 chance that all three APUs will fail during landing and
cause the shuttle to crash. NASA contends the risk is far lower.
   At an altitude of about 22 miles, or 115,400 feet, the shuttle
crosses California's coastline near Santa Barbara at a speed 4.37
times the speed of sound.
   From that point until the orbiter slows below the speed of sound
minutes before landing, anyone under the flight path will hear two
loud sonic booms as the shuttle's nose and wings zip through the
air.
   Approaching from the west, the shuttle flies east over Edwards
and circles north, west and then south as it continues to slow and
glides toward its unpaved runway on Rogers Dry Lake.
   It angles downward at about 21 degrees, seven times steeper than
the path of a commercial jet, before leveling out 17 seconds before
landing.
   ``It comes down like a streamlined brick,'' Thompson said.
   The commander usually starts to control the shuttle manually at
this point, pulling the nose up to reduce speed. The pilot opens
doors to deploy the landing gear 14 seconds before touchdown.
   Normal touchdown occurs at a speed between 210 and 225 mph, and
the shuttle rolls to a halt in about 8,000 feet.
   Discovery's commander, Frederick H. Hauck, was asked during a
news conference from space Sunday to describe the final moments of
landing:
   ``We'll be coming in just about between Los Angeles and Santa
Barbara, overhead the coast at about 110,000 feet and circling
around and we hope if the weather permits and the winds permit to
land on Edwards Runway 17.
   ``We'll pass overhead the field at about 40,000 feet, becoming
subsonic. You all can hear as we're supersonic a double sonic boom.
When you hear that, you'll know we're about five minutes from
landing. And then we'll make a standard approach, 300 miles per
hour, coming down to a touchdown at 200 miles per hour on that
lakebed.''
   NASA has modified Discovery's braking and steering systems in
hope of avoiding the brake and tire damage that occurred during
earlier landings.
   The crew once steered shuttles down the runway by applying
differential pressure to brakes, but that caused brake overheating
and damage. Now a backup nosewheel steering system has been
installed so the shuttle could be steered straight in crosswinds or
if tires blew out.
   NASA also installed a thicker main landing gear axle, put holes
in brake pistons to prevent pressure surges, modified controls to
equalize pressure on adjacent brakes and installed thicker brake
discs.
   At the urging of astronauts and the Rogers Commission, which
investigated the Jan. 28, 1986 Challenger launch disaster, shuttles
will land here for the foreseeable future, frustrating NASA's
initial plans to save time and money by landing the spacecraft
regularly back at the Cape Canaveral, Fla., launch site.
   The 44-square-mile dry lakebed at Edwards leaves plenty of room
for safety if brakes fail or tires blow out.
   Eighteen previous flights landed here, five at Cape Canaveral,
and one at White Sands Missile Range, N.M.
