   One of America's worst kept military
secrets, the F-117A stealth fighter, was unveiled Saturday to a
crowd of thousands who cheered a demonstration flight by two of the
multimillion dollar planes.
   The two bat-shaped planes swept in under thin cloud cover and
passed over Nellis Air Force Base, banked sharply against the Las
Vegas skyline and landed to give the public its first closeup of
the once top-secret aircraft.
   There was an eerie whine as the lead craft, piloted by Capt.
Randall Peterson of Rock Island, Ill., made a pass 58 feet above
the runway. The second, piloted by Maj. Steven Charles of
Springfield, Mass., then swept by the crowd, circled and landed.
   Both jets were surprisingly quiet in flight and while taxiing to
an area encircled by several thousand people, including military
families, VIPs and 225 reporters and photographers, including 37
from five foreign countries.
   Viewing was opened to the public later and as many as 150,000
people were expected.
   Foreign journalists represented Britain, France, Australia,
Japan and West Germany. Asked if any Soviet reporters were on hand,
Tech. Sgt. Bobby Shelton, the stealth unit information officer,
replied, ``They didn't ask us.''
   The F-117A costs more than $100 million a copy, according to a
recent report by the General Accounting Office. The Air Force gave
a figure of $42.6 million _ the so-called fly-away cost of one
plane, without counting development costs for the program.
   No performance details were released, other than that the
radar-evading F-117A is a single-seat, twin-engine subsonic jet.
``It is a fighter in every respect,'' Peterson, 30, told the crowd.
   He said the jet has outstanding handling and gives the United
States unprecedented capabilities. Pressed about those
capabilities, he said, ``We're not allowed to discuss any
capability. A lot of the information is still classified.''
   Referring to an F-117A nickname that has surfaced, he said,
``Nobody that flies the stealth aircraft calls it a wobbly goblin.''
   Also off-limits were questions on reports that a stealth fighter
used in the U.S. invasion of Panama last year dropped bombs far
from its target.
   ``The bombs hit exactly where they were aimed,'' Randall said
before another Air Force officer broke in and said, ``We can't
discuss information like that.''
   ``I only wish I could tell you what this fighter can really
do,'' said Ben Rich, vice president of Lockheed Corp., which builds
the jet at its secret ``Skunk Works'' in Burbank, Calif. ``The
performance is awesome and the weapons system is unmatched anywhere
in the world.''
   Though the ``fighter'' designation suggests dogfights with other
planes, the F-117A's main mission is as an attack jet. It is
designed to sneak through enemy defenses and bomb selected targets
such as defensive radar installations. The Air Force only recently
lifted the shroud of secrecy on the F-117A, which long had been
rumored to exist and has been flying for a decade. Previously, only
pictures had been shown.
   The stealth fighters are attached to the 37th Tactical Fighter
Wing at the Tonopah Test Range, a remote airfield 140 miles
northwest of Las Vegas.
   Most of the 2,500 military personnel assigned to the program
live in the Las Vegas area and commute to Tonopah each week. For
their families, the public demonstration was the first view of the
plane.
   The F-117A is a relatively simple aircraft to fly and operate.
said Col. Anthony Tolin, commander of the 37th. With only three
accidents in nine years, it has the best safety record of any Air
Force plane, he said.
   A test pilot survived the crash of the initial plane. Two Air
Force officers were killed in other accidents during operational
training.
   A total of 59 stealth fighters have been purchased and the last
will be delivered this fall. Each costs $42.6 million.
   Lt. Gen. Peter Kempf, commander of the 12th Air Force, said it
took 31 months to develop the stealth fighter, compared to a normal
aircraft development time of 10 to 12 years. The first stealth
fighter flight was in 1981, and the first production aircraft were
delivered to the Air Force a year later.
   The plane was flown strictly at night and over remote deserts
until November 1988, when the Air Force acknowledged the aircraft's
existence.
   Officials said the secrecy was lifted because the plane needed
to start flying in daylight. Tonopah residents have reported seeing
the F-117A in flight for several years.
