   The second test flight of
the $530 million B-2 stealth bomber was cut short today by a low
oil-pressure reading, the Air Force said.
   The radar-evading aircraft lifted off over the Mojave Desert at
7:29 a.m. for a three- to four-hour flight but returned at 8:36 a.m.
because of ``minor concerns'' with its indicators, said Air Force
spokeswoman 1st Lt. Anu Sjaardema.
   ``It was decided to land, which is a normal procedure during any
type of flight. ... The crews were never in any danger,'' she said.
``We don't even know if it's a problem yet. We're concerned with it
and will have to check it out.''
   Nevertheless, ``we did achieve some of the things we set out to
do, so we can't say it wasn't a successful flight,'' she said.
   The black, batwing bomber, whose fate in being debated in
Congress, flew with its landing gear retracted for the first time
and also flew a little faster and higher than on its maiden flight
in July, although the Air Force won't specify the speed and
altitude, she said.
   Each of the B-2's four engines ``has an accessory drive. One out
of the four drives indicated low oil pressure,'' Sjaardema said.
   Tech. Sgt. Donn Clarius said the accessory drives power the
engine turbine startup unit and hydraulic systems, but there was no
failure of the hydraulic system, which on many planes allows pilots
to operate flaps and other control surfaces.
   The flight by Northrop Corp. test pilot Bruce J. Hinds and Air
Force Col. Richard Couch came after a day of delays blamed on wind
and a long list of preflight checklist.
   During takeoff, the plane climbed gradually and looked steady as
it flew with the wind at its tail. Aircraft usually take off from
here heading west, into the wind.
   During the plane's July 17 maiden flight, Hinds and Couch flew
the B-2 nearly two hours at up to 10,000 feet. The tailless,
172-foot-long wing with bulges in the middle was described by Couch
as a ``very nimble aircraft'' and ``a lot of fun'' to fly.
   The Air Force had planned to fly the plane again after dawn
Tuesday, but the test was rescheduled.
   ``There was nothing wrong with the airplane,'' said Air Force
Col. Don Weisert, a B-2 deputy program director. ``We expected winds
to come up and we wanted to make sure we could get in a full day of
activity.''
   The bomber, the most expensive warplane in history, was given a
unique contour and built with radar-absorbing composite materials.
It is designed to carry nuclear bombs and, with the conventional
B-1, replace the aging B-52 bomber.
   Earlier this month, the House voted to put strict limitations on
production of the plane, requiring the Pentagon to come up with a
cheaper program. The Senate made a modest cut of $300 million in the
$4.7 billion President Bush is seeking.
   The government has already invested about $22.4 billion in the
B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule.
