   Israel's air force blasted Palestinian
guerrilla bases in Lebanon on Tuesday, two days after a firebomb
attack in the occupied West Bank that killed a Jewish teacher and
her three children.
   Lebanese police said four people were killed, 15 wounded and
several targets destroyed. They said all reported casualties
resulted from a six-minute raid on the Mieh Mieh refugee camp at
Sidon.
   Israeli leaders had vowed revenge for the attack on the Israeli
bus Sunday, in which five other people were wounded. Israel
frequently responds to attacks on its citizens by hitting
Palestinian targets in Lebanon.
   The raids came as Israelis voted in national elections expected
to influence the fate of Palestinians living under military
occupation.
   Police said the four dead at Mieh Mieh, on the fringe of the
ancient port 25 miles south of Beirut, were three guerrillas and a
civilian motorist driving in the Palestinian refugee camp. Two women
and 13 guerrillas were wounded, they reported.
   Spokesmen for the Palestine Liberation Organization gave the
figures as three dead and 15 wounded. Both the PLO and police said
they had no casualty reports from the other targets.
   Six Israeli fighter-bombers attacked PLO bases at Mieh Mieh, and
positions of Syrian-backed guerrillas in hills above the coastal
town of Damour and at Aramoun, a southern suburb of Beirut.
   Lebanese police said the planes were U.S.-built F-16s and a PLO
military report made available to The Associated Press in Nicosia
said they were F-15s.
   The Israeli command confirmed the raids, but followed standard
practice of not revealing the type of aircraft. It said pilots
reported the targets destroyed, including ammunition storehouses
along the coast.
   Bases of PLO chief Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah guerrilla
faction in Mieh Mieh bore the brunt of the attack, police reported.
   They said the raiders fired eight rockets in four sorties that
demolished four buildings used as bases by Fatah and the PLO's Force
17 security agency.
   Flames shot up from from Mieh Mieh and the nearby hills of Ein
el-Dilb. Ambulances and fire engines raced to the scene.
   Police said four rockets hit positions of pro-Syrian guerrilla
factions in the highlands outside Aramoun, 10 miles south of Beirut,
and two rockets struck a camp of three tents in a forest above
Damour, midway between Beirut and Sidon.
   They said the tent camp belonged to the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine. Its guerrillas and allied fighters of Walid
Jumblatt's Druse militia were seen firing at the raiders, without
success.
   ``We heard the planes bombing Sidon, so we all rushed from the
base to the woods,'' said one guerrilla, who would not give his
name.``That's why we suffered no casualties.''
   Israeli jets broke the sound barrier over Beirut before and after
the raids.
   Tuesday's attack was the fifth inside Lebanon in two weeks and
the 20th this year.
   Thirty-six people were killed and 76 wounded in four raids on
strongholds of Palestinian and Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem
guerrillas in south Lebanon between Oct. 21 and Oct. 26.
   Those raids responded to a suicide attack in which a Shiite
driver detonated a car bomb Oct. 19 in an army convoy in Israel's
self-designated south Lebanon ``security zone,'' killing eight
soldiers.
   By police count, 104 people were killed and 184 wounded in the 19
previous air strikes of 1988.
