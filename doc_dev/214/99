   America's premier spy plane _ the SR-71
Blackbird _ came in from the Cold War after a quarter century of
supersonic snooping, setting a transcontinental speed record
Tuesday before retiring to a museum home.
   In a final fling for the history books, one of the black,
dagger-shaped aircraft flashed from coast to coast in 68 minutes,
17 seconds, arriving at Washington Dulles International Airport
outside the nation's capital to the cheers of hundreds of onlookers.
   The old record was 3 hours, 38 minutes, set in 1963 by a Boeing
707.
   The Blackbird took a running start, refueling over the Pacific
Ocean at 60,000 feet before heading east from the California
coastline and crossing its finish line near Salisbury, Md., said
Malvern Gross, president of the National Aeronatics Association.
The Blackbird then refueled before cruising in to Dulles Airport.
   The flight also set three other speed records certified by the
National Aeronautic Association.
   ``It's bittersweet,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Bruce Liebman, who
flew Blackbirds for the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale
Air Force Base, Calif., in the 1970s. ``I'm happy it set the record
but sad that it has been put to bed.''
   ``Bye-bye, Blackbird,'' said Ben Rich, the Lockheed Aeronautical
System Co. executive who helped design the Blackbird: ``I cannot
honestly say this is a happy day for me.''
   The Blackbird model No. 17972 was donated to the Smithsonian
Institution, which plans to display it at a Dulles Airport wing of
the National Air and Space Museum.
   Against overcast skies, the spy plane ended its flight by
dipping as low as 200 feet above the runway as it whistled past an
official greeting gate, balls of fire trailing its huge engines as
the pilot suddenly pointed the pencil-shaped fuselage toward the
heavens.
   It was one of the few public displays of a Blackbird. And
despite the rush to publicize this final run, most details of the
plane's design and capabilities are still top secret. The Air Force
won't even say how many of the planes exist.
   Maj. Suzanne Randle of the Strategic Air Command's headquarters
at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb., said nine Blackbirds are going to
museums, three are being mothballed at Palmdale, Calif., and three
will be used by NASA for research. Ms. Randle said she could not
say whether that accounted for all the planes.
   The first flight of a Blackbird was in December 1964. It
regularly flew missions over heavily defended North Vietnam and
provided intelligence in many other regions, including the Middle
East and China. In 1982 its photographs revealed the presence of
Soviet MiG fighters in Nicaragua, touching off an international
dispute.
   The Air Force officially retired the Blackbird fleet in January,
saying they were too expensive to keep in the air despite their
technological prowess. Technological advances also enable
satellites to do similar work more cheaply.
   Critics argue, however, the planes should be kept in service
because they are more versatile than satellites, which are locked
into specific orbits and can take longer to pass over a trouble
spot.
   The Blackbird can outrun the fastest fighters and has never been
shot down in 25 years of spying. It remains the fastest and
highest-flying jet aircraft in the world.
   Built to withstand temperatures of more than 800 degrees
Fahrenheit, its skin is a titanium alloy instead of the aluminum
used on most airplanes. Powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney turbojet
engines, it can sustain a speed of Mach 3, or three times the speed
of sound. Its maximum speed is classified.
   On Tuesday's flight, the plane set separate speed records of
2,153.24 mph between Los Angeles and Washington; 2,242.48 mph
between St. Louis and Cincinnati and 2,200.94 mph between Kansas
City, Mo., and Washington. Sonic booms were reported in various
communities along the flight path as the plane completed its race
across the continent.
   The pilot was Lt. Col. Ed Yeilding, and Lt. Col. J.T. Vida was
the reconnaissance systems officer.
   The decision to scrap the Blackbirds still worries some members
of Congress and clearly irks airmen who flew the secret aircraft on
its 65 million miles of spying.
   ``You might ask, `Why retire it'''? said Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., at the Dulles arrival ceremony. ``This is a very vivid
example of what America will go through to scale back defense
spending.'' Later he added, ``This is one of the first victims'' of
the rush to reduce the military as a result of lessened East-West
tensions.
   The Blackbird's retirement has special meaning for the pilots.
Brig. Gen. Harold ``Buck'' Adams, who flew the same Blackbird on a
record-setting speed run from London to Los Angeles in September
1971, appeared to be fighting back tears as he stood several yards
from the plane in addressing the Dulles crowd.
   ``She is a truly magnificent machine, and she's retiring a
winner,'' he said.
