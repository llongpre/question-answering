In the wake of the catastrophic earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay Area 
Tuesday, Orange County's disaster preparedness agencies and the military 
mobilized today to provide relief to the shattered Northern California 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first to go was the California Army National Guard's 143rd Combat 
Support Hospital based in Los Alamitos. At least 11 doctors, nurses and medics, 
along with tents, tables and beds, were loaded onto a C-130 transport Tuesday 
night bound for Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento, where the unit will 
await further assignment. This morning, helicopters and crews from the 140th 
Aviation Battalion at Los Alamitos also was sent to provide medical evacuation 
services for the hospital unit set up at Travis Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 10,000 callers swamped 38 telephone lines at the Orange 
County Chapter of the American Red Cross in Santa Ana, which is seeking 
donations, and local utilities and fire departments have volunteered repair and 
emergency crews. Red Cross spokeswoman Sylvia Stewart said 25 lines are being 
installed to accommodate callers from throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, at least 100 volunteers also arrived at Red Cross offices 
offering to give blood or help in the relief effort. Stewart said 290 pints of 
blood were sent by the Orange County chapter to the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said the Red Cross is suggesting that local residents wanting to help 
in the relief effort donate money to the national organization's disaster fund, 
which was depleted by Hurricane Hugo in September. 
</P>
<P>
Donations can be sent to the American Red Cross, Orange County Chapter, 601 N. 
Golden Circle Dr., Santa Ana, Calif., 92711. Contributors should mark 
"earthquake" on donation checks. Food and blankets also will be accepted, 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Also on standby is Orange County Fire Department's heavy rescue team, a group 
of trained rescue workers and fire engines. It is awaiting word from the state 
Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Fire Chief Ken MacLeod said the department's four-man rescue squad was 
dispatched to Mexico City several years ago during that city's major earthquake 
to aid in finding survivors amid the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Southern California Edison Co. in Orange County contacted 
communities in the Bay Area and offered to provide materials, repair crews and 
engineering assistance to help restore power.
