AT&amp;T's Dollars 12.6bn acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications, which
was approved by US regulators this summer, has set the stage for the
reshaping of the US mobile communications industry as regional cellular
telephone companies and new entrants race to create nationwide mobile
communications services.
The union of the long-distance telephone giant with the leading US cellular
carrier creates an industry behemoth. AT&amp;T invented cellular telephone
technology more than 30 years ago and is a big manufacturer of cellular
equipment, but until now it has been unable to offer mobile phone services.
The megadeal is driving regional phone companies and cellular carriers into
each others' arms as they scramble to get ready to compete with the new
industry force.
Since early July, two regional 'Baby Bell' phone companies, Bell Atlantic,
which serves the mid-Atlantic region, and Nynex, which serves New York and
New England, have decided to unite their cellular operations to create a
giant east coast network, stretching from Maine to Virginia and serving 1.8m
customers.
US West, which serves 14 mid-western states, has agreed to merge its
cellular interests with Airtouch, a recent spin-off from Pacific Telesis,
the west coast regional telephone company. Together they will have 1.7m
customers. Ameritech, the Chicago-based Baby Bell, is reported to be seeking
a similar alliance.
The US cellular market has been fragmented since it began in the early 1980s
when the US government gave out just two operating licences in each region,
one for each of the established local telephone companies and one for a new,
independent rival.
McCaw, which build up a national presence by taking over many of these
independents, is already a tough rival to local phone companies and the
injection of AT&amp;T's long distance resources promises to make it even
tougher.
Although regional telephone companies have bought up cellular licences
outside their regions, this has created a jumble of networks of differing
standards. As a result, cellular telephones purchased in one part of the
country do not always work in other places and charges for accessing
different networks can be prohibitive.
Nonetheless, the US cellular market has grown from virtually nothing in the
early 1980s to more than 16m subscribers at the end of 1993 with some 14,000
new customers signing up every day, according to EMCI, a Washington-based
communications consultancy. The total number of US cellular telephone
subscribers will reach 20m by the end of this year, the researchers predict,
with growth continuing at a rate of 25 per cent a year for the next two
years.
In addition, more than 18m people in the US subscribe to paging services,
which have become very popular as a low cost form of mobile messaging
services among teenagers as well as by business people.
New technology is driving change in the US wireless communications industry.
In December, the Federal Communications Commission will put up for auction
licences to operate new 'personal communications services' - using low
powered, high frequency, digital micro-cell transmitters that promise to
make wireless telephone services price-competitive with conventional
'wire-line' networks.
If the recent auction of licences for advanced two-way paging services is
any indication, demand for the broadband PCS licences will be strong. The
paging licences were sold for Dollars 617m, well above the anticipated
amount.
Killen &amp; Associates, a California market research group, estimates that the
sale of PCS licences will raise Dollars 25bn to Dollars 30bn, well above
government and industry estimates of Dollars 10bn to Dollars 12bn.
'The FCC's recent auction of advanced paging and interactive video data
service licences surprised many economists and financial analysts, who
thought the government would collect only Dollars 50m or so,' says Mr
Michael Killen, the group's president.
'A winning bid at the broadband spectrum auction may be the regional
telephone companies' last chance to maintain some control of their core
businesses,' he adds.
More than 2000 PCS licences will be put up for sale. Some will be for single
metropolitan markets, others for large regions. Companies hoping to put
together enough licences around the US to create a nationwide PCS network
will probably have to bid hundreds of millions of dollars.
Both local and long-distance companies are preparing to bid for PCS
licences, some of them in teams. The looming PCS auctions are another factor
driving industry alliances as companies join forces and figure out where
they need PCS licences to complete nationwide mobile communications
networks.
By the year 2003 nearly one in 10 US residents will be subscribing to PCS
according to Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a Wall Street brokerage firm. The
analysts predict that PCS will not make a significant impact until 1997, but
will then grow rapidly to account for 25.4m users out of a total market for
cellular-type users that will have grown to 103.6m subscribers by the end of
2003.
Yet another challenge to established cellular telephone service providers is
posed by Nextel, a dispatch radio service company with ambitious plans to
create a nationwide mobile communications network combining voice, data,
paging and dispatch radio services.
Nextel has amassed 'special mobile radio' licences, traditionally used for
vehicle dispatch services, from coast to coast through a series of
acquisitions and licence purchases.
But it suffered a setback last month when MCI , the US long distance
carrier, withdrew from plans to acquire a 17 per cent stake in Nextel for
Dollars 1.3bn. MCI was to have been Nextel's marketing partner. The
companies are still exploring the possibility of a strategic alliance, but
on different terms.
Whatever happens, Nextel claims that it will be the first company to offer
advanced wireless voice and data communications services nationwide.
Analysts predict that Nextel will win 15 per cent of mobile communications
subscribers by the end of the decade, by which time PCS systems are expected
to account for about 35 per cent of the total.
