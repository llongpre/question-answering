PACIFIC TELESIS WILL CUT 11,000 JOBS OVER FIVE YEARS; 
</P>

Pacific Telesis Group said Thursday that it will pare 11,000 of its 69,000 jobs 
-- 16% of the work force -- over the next five years to cut costs amid 
increased competition and new labor-saving technology. 
</P>
<P>
The company, the state's largest private employer, said the job cuts will come 
almost entirely from its Pacific Bell local telephone subsidiary. It said the 
reductions will be achieved through early-retirement incentives, retraining and 
attrition, but a job-seeking service will also be set up for employees 
accepting severance pay and leaving the company. 
</P>
<P>
Which jobs will be axed -- and how heavily the cuts will fall on Pacific Bell's 
28,000 Southern California employees -- remains to be determined, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts are among the largest in a series of reductions that have pared 17,000 
jobs from Pacific Telesis since it was created in 1984 as one of seven regional 
holding companies spun off from giant American Telephone &amp; Telegraph as 
part of an antitrust settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Telesis attributed the latest cuts to increased competition from 
upstart telephone firms that are chipping away at its monopoly and taking away 
some of its largest customers. In addition, new labor-saving telecommunications 
technology is making many jobs unneeded. 
</P>
<P>
"One person can do the job of three or four," observed Stuart Crane, an analyst 
with Gruntal &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts also stem from a new California regulatory system that provides 
Pacific Bell incentives to reduce costs to increase profits. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying out the job-reduction program, including costs of early-retirement 
incentives, will not have a significant impact on profits, Pacific Telesis 
said. Analysts also noted that the cutback is not a sign of financial 
difficulty at the San Francisco-based firm, which is among the strongest of the 
so-called Baby Bells spun off from AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
All but 50 of the jobs to be cut will come from giant Pacific Bell. The other 
50 jobs are to be cut during 1990 from Pacific Telesis' present headquarters 
staff of about 400. 
</P>
<P>
"Staffing requirements change over time in this dynamic industry," said Pacific 
Bell President Phil Quigley. "What was appropriate in 1989 clearly will not be 
in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell will lose about 7,600 non-salaried jobs and 3,400 management 
positions, he said. The job cuts do not affect Pacific Telesis' unregulated 
ventures, which are grouped under PacTel Corp. These include PacTel Cellular in 
Costa Mesa, PacTel Paging, Pacific Telesis International, PacTel Business 
Systems and PacTel Properties. 
</P>
<P>
Some layoffs will probably prove inevitable, the company acknowledged, but 
Pacific Telesis will try to minimize that by offering incentives for veteran 
employees to retire early by adding three years to both their service and their 
age in calculating pension benefits. That incentive trimmed a third of the 
management staff of Nevada Bell, a Pacific Telesis subsidiary that serves the 
Reno area. Other employees in jobs identified as surplus will be offered 
training for other posts or assignment to lower-ranking slots, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to operate even more efficiently in the 1990s, so we can deliver 
the maximum benefits to our customers and share-owners," said Sam Ginn, Pacific 
Telesis' chairman and chief executive. "Looking ahead, we remain keenly focused 
on our customers and the need to streamline operations so we can meet the 
challenges of increasing competition." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally welcomed the announcement but said it was no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"The driving force of the telecommunications industry is technology," said 
analyst Crane of Gruntal &amp; Co. "Switches today are gigantic computers that 
are highly automated. They do almost anything. So all you need is people to 
supervise these massive machines and keep an eye on them." 
</P>
<P>
Another incentive to cut costs stems from a new regulatory system in California 
that requires Pacific Bell to lower costs by 4.5% a year to reflect anticipated 
labor-saving improvements from new technology. But the new system also allows 
the company to earn more, if it can, than was possible under the old system, 
which set a tight limit on profits. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, despite their present monopoly in providing local telephone service, 
Pacific Bell and the other Baby Bells already are losing some business from 
major customers, mainly financial services firms. These companies are either 
erecting microwave towers to create their own private phone system, or 
contracting with Pacific Bell or a growing number of newcomers that provide 
private links for them. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, this traffic bypasses the "public network" that most businesses and 
residential customers depend on. 
</P>
<P>
This bypassing was encouraged in California and some other states, including 
New York, when regulators opened one area of the monopoly to competition -- the 
lucrative high-speed transmission of data. Moreover, the California Public 
Utilities Commission this year will consider prying open other areas of the 
local monopoly. And the Federal Communications Commission and Congress are 
re-examining national cable television law, which presently forbids local phone 
companies to carry cable television in their service areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We may see in the next decade, more than one (local) phone company serving an 
area," suggested Steve Sazebari of the Dataquest research firm in San Jose. "In 
any case, they have to be more competitive in price and quality, so basically 
they have to cut costs." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell serve nearly 22 million people in California and 
the Reno area.
