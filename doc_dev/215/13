<LEADPARA>  Mysterious computer software failures Wednesday disrupted telephone service
for millions of homes and offices in the Washington, D.C., area and Southern
California.;    For nearly six hours in the afternoon and evening, 5 million
customers in the Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Cos.' service area --
including the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia --
were unable to complete calls unless they were dialing nearby phones or long
distance.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Bell Atlantic Corp., the parent company of the C&amp;P companies, reported that
by 8 p.m. the system was back up and running, with a few scattered outages.;  
 Initial reports suggested the problem involved computer software, part of a
system that is being installed to complete calls more quickly and to allow new
functions, such as Caller ID, to be added to telephones.;    By a strange
coincidence, a similar problem was occurring on the West Coast. From about
10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. PDT, 3 million telephone lines served by Pacific Bell
broke down, leaving callers unable to dial across town or long distance.;    A
spokesman for Pacific Bell said there was a buildup of calls in its Signaling
System 7 computer, the same type of system used by C&amp;P. Service was disrupted
in the 213, 818, 714 and 805 area codes.;    "It seems like our software just
decided to take the day off," said Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen in
Orange County.;    Officials said most service was restored by midafternoon.  </TEXT>
