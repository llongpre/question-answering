PACIFIC BELL USERS WILL GET $5-MILLION REFUND

Thousands of Pacific Bell's rural customers are expected to share about $5 
million in refunds this summer under a quietly negotiated tentative settlement 
of a complaint accusing the company of charging customers for push-button 
telephone service that it never provided. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission approved the proposed settlement in 
secret session on Friday but issued no press release, apparently at Pacific 
Bell's request. The action comes less than three years after the PUC ordered 
the phone company to refund millions of dollars to customers pressured into 
buying services that they neither needed nor wanted. 
</P>
<P>
For the $5-million settlement, Pacific Bell customers can thank George Sawaya, 
a retired senior auditor in the Downey office of the State Board of 
Equalization. A resident of the Sierra foothill hamlet of Pollock Pines since 
1981, Sawaya has led the three-year battle for compensation for the wrongly 
charged phone customers. 
</P>
<P>
As Sawaya explained Tuesday, he decided to sign up for Pacific Bell's "Touch 
Tone" service in 1985 after the company sent him, along with his monthly phone 
bill, a list of available extra services and their prices. The mailing said 
Touch Tone service "places your calls faster than a rotary-dial phone can," a 
feature that Sawaya wanted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Marketing Abuse' Charged 
</P>
<P>
But after Sawaya paid a $5 sign-up charge for the service and agreed to pay an 
extra $1.20 a month for it, he found no improvement. After calling Pacific 
Bell's local office, he learned that the older, non-digital switch serving much 
of El Dorado County could not provide full Touch Tone service. He cancelled the 
service and Pacific Bell refunded his payments. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Sawaya said, he thought about his neighbors served by the same 
electromechanical switch, along with the 30% of Pacific Bell customers then 
served by similar equipment. So in January, 1986, he filed a class-action 
complaint with the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
At the subsequent hearing, Sawaya described the literature describing Touch 
Tone as "deceptive or misleading." He called it "a form of marketing abuse not 
unlike others which have recently been under consideration by the Public 
Utilities Commission." 
</P>
<P>
Sawaya was referring to a PUC finding in August, 1986, that Pacific Bell had 
intentionally engaged in abusive sales techniques. Among other things, its 
agents, working under a quota system, improperly sold basic telephone service 
with such extras as call-forwarding and call-waiting. Some customers claimed 
that the Pacific Bell sales pitches misled them into believing that such 
services were not available individually or that they could not get basic 
telephone service without them. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC made Pacific Bell offer refunds, at a cost to the company of more than 
$40 million, to affected customers. It also was required to contribute to a 
consumer-education fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sawaya Persevered 
</P>
<P>
A major difference between the marketing-abuse case and the recent one, Sawaya 
pointed out, was that in the first case the company was at least providing the 
services for which it was billing customers. 
</P>
<P>
At Sawaya's 1986 hearing, a senior Pacific Bell engineer, Loren Wedel, 
testified that there was no physical change in Sawaya's service as a result of 
his having signed up for Touch Tone service. Only billing records were changed, 
the engineer confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the PUC dismissed the case on the technical grounds that because 
Sawaya had obtained a refund, he could not intervene on behalf of other 
customers in a class-action complaint. Undeterred, Sawaya asked for a 
rehearing. 
</P>
<P>
That rehearing petition was dismissed behind closed doors on Friday. But in 
exchange, Pacific Bell assured the commissioners that it would submit a plan to 
refund "about $5 million" to customers in Sawaya's circumstances -- a 
settlement Sawaya viewed "positively." It also agreed not to charge them in the 
future for Touch Tone service, which is now available to Pollock Pines 
customers.
