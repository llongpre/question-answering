Striking phone workers set up picket lines outside many of Pacific Bell's 53 
Orange County facilities Monday as a strike by the Communication Workers of 
America union on both coasts entered its first business day with no sign of 
progress toward settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as it takes, we're ready to stay out here," said Mary Balis, an 
operator who had gathered with fellow workers outside a Pacific Bell building 
on Euclid Street in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Cross Picket Lines 
</P>
<P>
A union official said that up to 2,000 striking operators, technicians and 
other workers showed up to picket and that fewer than 100 people crossed picket 
lines. A spokeswoman for Pacific Bell, which serves 731,000 customers in Orange 
County, said that only a handful of union operators showed up for work. 
</P>
<P>
Sign-waving strikers in Orange County reported peaceful protests Monday. 
Company and union officials monitoring the picket lines said there was 
scattered heckling between pickets and people crossing their lines. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the country, there were reports of minor picket-line violence 
among the 157,000 phone workers who walked out over the weekend. A dozen 
striking workers were arrested in Boston Monday and some scuffling was reported 
at a Pacific Bell billing office and switching center in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
The strike is against three so-called "Baby Bell" companies that supply local 
phone service along much of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. The automated 
networks continued working as usual at Pacific Bell, at NYNEX's phone companies 
in New York and New England and at Bell Atlantic, whose subsidiaries serve the 
Mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delays of Up to 5 Minutes 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the strike, which has idled nearly 5,000 workers, slowed 
directory assistance, operator help and other telephone services. Delays of up 
to five minutes were reported on 411 calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Service is not what customers would expect on a day-to-day basis," said Linda 
Bonniksen, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
As the strike goes on, Orange County customers can expect little or no effect 
on direct-dial calls but delays in operator service, directory assistance and 
repair requests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers are postponing calling in for new service," Bonniksen said. "They're 
pretty much realizing our limitations." 
</P>
<P>
The company's 955 managers in Orange County have been trained to replace 
striking workers, Bonniksen said, and 350 other managers from the company's 
Oakland headquarters arrived Monday to pitch in as operators, maintenance 
personnel and coin collectors. All are scheduled to work 12-hour shifts, six 
days a week. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are wages and health care. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said they would like to see the company pay a larger share of 
recent increases in health insurance costs and reduce the compensation gap 
between the highest-paying jobs, dominated by men, and the lowest-paying jobs 
-- such as operators -- most of which are held by women. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Durbin, executive vice president of Local 9510, said that worker 
productivity has gone up but that the company's "retrogressive" offer of a 
10.93% pay raise over the next three years won't match cost-of-living 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a lot of real money," Durbin said. 
</P>
<P>
Bell spokeswoman Bonniksen said Monday that the strike could have been avoided 
if the union had weighed more carefully what the company described as a 
"generous" contract offer that includes increased medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
At the company's offices in Tustin Monday, an emergency operations center 
normally reserved for disasters such as earthquakes handled calls from other 
offices needing help to keep up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
In an emergency, the room has enough food for three months and comes complete 
with cots and ham radios. But on Monday, it took on a quieter pace, as 
supervisors calmly made sure operations wouldn't crumble as just 20% of all 
positions were filled by managers, said Gary Cuccio, Orange County's customer 
services general manager for Pacific Bell. (With managers working 72-hour 
weeks, 40% of total manpower needs are being covered, Cuccio said.) 
</P>
<P>
Cuccio, who traded his desk for a climb on Newport Beach telephone polls 
Monday, said customers can expect repairs to take a day and installation from 
three to five days. They were advised to save time by looking up numbers and 
avoid making collect calls, if possible. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, some newly christened operators wore name tags to get acquainted with 
fellow workers. 
</P>
<P>
Managers who learned the job in one day rather than the usual seven said their 
new jobs give them an opportunity to learn more about the business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been interesting -- a side of the business I haven't worked on," said 
operator Arlene Steinert. "We're all very cautious, though." 
</P>
<P>
Out on the street in front of Pacific Bell's Garden Grove facility, things were 
a little noisier. 
</P>
<P>
During the morning rush hour, many motorists honked and raised their fists in 
support of the striking workers who paraded in front of the building waving 
their signs. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be out here; we'd just as soon be in there," striker Balis 
said. "We'd just like to get a piece of the pie we helped create." 
</P>
<P>
Operator Larry Cain, a single father with two children, said he cannot afford 
to carry on without an additional increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I at least want to stay even with the cost of living," he said, taking a break 
from picketing. 
</P>
<P>
Cain, a three-year employee, said pickets are dedicated and intend to stay out 
on strike as long as possible. Referring to his children, Cain said: "Whatever 
I give here is going to help them." 
</P>
<P>
Wesley Wyscarver, who doesn't work for the phone company but is a friend of a 
striking worker, joined her in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm supporting a local cause," said Wyscarver, lounging on a beach chair next 
to a clump of empty soda cans and signs that read, "Their profits are off the 
chart. Now, it's our turn." 
</P>
<P>
"If they lose, we all lose."
