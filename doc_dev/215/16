<LEADPARA>  Regarding "So go phone subsidies" (Editorials, Oct. 28), competition is not
the enemy here.;   California today is partitioned into 10 regions called
LATAs (Local Access Transport Areas). Calling within these LATAs -- say from
Mendocino to Morgan Hill -- you cannot choose who carries your telephone
calls. Your calls are monopolized by the local carriers like Pacific Bell and
you pay their going rate.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Letters to the editor  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Allowing competition for intraLATA calling would bring about lower prices,
increased consumer choice, and a wealth of new services and technology to the
public.;   Recently, Pacific Bell and GTE-California requested California
Public Utilities Commission approval to increase the rates they charge for
basic local telephone service (the flat charge to provide service to your home
or business), coupled with reductions in their intraLATA toll rates. PacBell
and GTE say these changes are necessary because of the anticipated pricing
pressure that will be brought about by competition in the LATAs.;   That's
simply not true.;   History shows that rates for basic local telephone service
need not increase as a result of intraLATA competition. In the 29 states that
have authorized competition for intraLATA calls, there is no evidence that
competition has caused rates for basic local telephone service to increase.
Meanwhile, in those same states, long distance rates have fallen.;   I am also
concerned about the indictment that long distance carriers are "swiping"
toll-call business from the local carriers. When Pac Bell recently complained
of this; the CPUC said Pac Bell had not proven its case and denied its request
for an injunction against certain long distance carriers.;   The benefits of
true competition are clear. Don't let your freedom of choice for in-state
calling be held hostage in exchange for higher local telephone charges.;   --
