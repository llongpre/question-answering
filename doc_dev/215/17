Top Orange County officials vowed Tuesday night to immediately begin reviewing 
the county's earthquake preparedness plan, acknowledging that the county is not 
ready for a disaster such as the one that hit the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"If that quake had struck Orange County, we'd have similar problems," said 
Christine Boyd, manager of the county's disaster planning agency. "We've taken 
some steps to get ready, but we've got a ways to go. This serves as a good 
lesson, and hopefully it will push to get us going." 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Larry A. Parrish said he told key members of his 
staff by telephone late Tuesday to review the county's preparedness plans. But 
Parrish would not predict whether the 6.9-magnitude quake in the Bay Area will 
mean more local money for countywide emergency preparedness. He would say only 
that the disaster may have a "very sobering effect on our financial 
priorities." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a sweeping plan designed specifically to help the county prepare for 
such a calamity was created. Known as the Southern California Emergency 
Preparedness Project, the plan covers everything from educating the public on 
how to prepare for a major quake to deployment of equipment, medical supplies 
and volunteers during such a catastrophe. But so far, the county has spent less 
than $300,000 on the plan, which Parrish said would cost about $12 million to 
implement fully. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point," Parrish said, "it's not within our capacity. . . . The 
temptation there is to say whatever it takes, we'll spend it. But perspective 
is critical. I just think we need a little time to assess what's worked and 
what hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, while supporting Parrish's 
review of the county's response plans, said that paying for such preparations 
is difficult in light of the county's fiscal condition and pressing needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The amounts of money you're talking about make it very difficult to finance," 
Riley said. "You got jails. You've also got the homeless. You've got 
innumerable projects that are crying out (for county money). These have greater 
appeal to all of us. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess most of us think it can't happen to us. You just hope it doesn't 
happen here," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But Boyd, manager of the county's Emergency Management Division, said the Bay 
Area quake serves as a graphic lesson that she hopes will stir commitment to 
local preparedness efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that if anything constructive can come out of this tragedy, it's that 
people must prepare," Boyd said. "The San Andreas Fault is not exclusive to the 
Bay Area. It can happen here, and we've got to redouble our efforts to get 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
The San Andreas passes about 30 miles northeast of the Los Angeles Basin. But 
many earthquake experts say Orange County residents face an even greater threat 
from the Newport-Inglewood Fault, which travels along the county coast from 
Newport Beach to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
A cadre of county emergency officials, from utility managers to physicians, 
were preparing Tuesday night to lend assistance to the quake-relief effort in 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The National Guard's 40th Division, based in Los Alamitos, has been placed on 
alert, but no troops or equipment have yet been dispatched to aid in quake 
relief, a National Guard spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd's agency sent one of its senior coordinators to the Bay Area to observe 
recovery operations. County fire officials were on alert, prepared to send 
medical and fire equipment as well as volunteers to quake-stricken areas. 
</P>
<P>
The local Red Cross chapter opened its emergency disaster center in Santa Ana 
to answer calls from county residents concerned about friends and relatives in 
the Bay Area. Red Cross Director George Brown said about a dozen volunteers 
answered calls from anxious county residents, many of them wondering how to 
safeguard their homes in event of a similar quake. The Red Cross information 
line is (714) 835-5381. 
</P>
<P>
"It always happens, but it takes pictures of a major disaster on TV to get them 
concerned about their preparedness," Brown said. "In a way, maybe that's good, 
but I just hope people get the message." 
</P>
<P>
County residents were also urged Tuesday night not to phone the Bay Area. 
Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonnekson said the few phone lines still working 
in the Bay Area are overloaded with calls, complicating and slowing relief 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Because phone service is so critical, Bonnekson said that Pacific Bell conducts 
quarterly drills with dozens of employees at its large Tustin operational 
center. The facility employs more than 1,000 workers, including several shifts 
of operators. 
</P>
<P>
"With roads knocked out, the phone becomes a key tool in coping with an 
emergency of this type," Bonnekson said. "We try to train our people how to 
deal with the disaster and keep working at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
For Robert Bade, a county emergency medical physician, the Bay Area quake 
underscored the need to develop a network of private doctors ready to roll 
should a quake strike. Bade has been pushing for six years to establish a team 
of "quake-ready" doctors, a program that has received nearly $25,000 in seed 
money from county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Bade spoke Tuesday to two civic groups in Tustin and Dana Point 
on this very subject. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to the kind of topic that would put a luncheon group to sleep," Bade 
said. "Now, after seeing those remarkable and sad pictures on TV, maybe people 
will start to take this seriously. I think they are."
