<TEXT>     Pacific Telesis, Pac Bell's San Francisco-based parent company, recently
produced an eight-minute video called "First Born" to accompany a lobbying
effort aimed at politicians and regulators.;   Set in the year 2003, "First
Born" is the story of a middle-aged Hispanic couple in Fresno whose daughter
in San Diego is about to give birth prematurely to their first grandchild. As
the wife frantically packs her bag, the husband sits at his small two-way
videophone making plane reservations and choosing a crib from a catalog
display. Meanwhile, a doctor studies a sonogram of the daughter's baby from
home by videophone and gives his diagnosis to the nurse.;   At the
tear-jerking conclusion, the wife -- now in San Diego -- introduces the
family's new grandson to her husband in Fresno through a window-sized two-way
video screen.;   Pac Bell is willing to offer us this wonderful future -- but
there is a catch. The phone company wants to be freed from a long list of
regulatory restraints so it can build the expensive infrastructure required to
support advanced telecommunications services.;   Fiber optics is the key to
this vision -- specifically, putting high-capacity fiber-optic cables at or
near individual homes. Manufacturers of telephone equipment, telephone
companies and regulators are now in the middle of deciding how to engineer
this transformation and how much it will cost.;   These tough issues aren't
getting much public attention, but they are crucial to the future of Silicon
Valley. Dozens of companies in the hardware, software and information services
industries are preparing to make multimillion-dollar gambles on the future of
telecommunications in the home. Products or services that require the larger
capacity of fiber could flop if that capacity is not there soon enough.;   A
bundle of fiber cables no thicker than an adult's finger can carry 96,000
telephone conversations simultaneously -- a feat that would require 27
conventional copper-wire telephone cables, each measuring two to three inches
in diameter. The huge capacity of fiber optics could make possible new
interactive services such as video conferencing and sophisticated home
shopping.;   The biggest hurdle remaining is what telephone companies call the
"last mile" or the "local loop," the huge network of copper wires that
connects individual homes and small businesses to central switching offices.; 
 There is a consensus that copper wire will eventually disappear from the last
mile, but little agreement on when or at what cost.;   Fiber, which carries
brief bursts of laser light, has already taken over the top of the telephone
pyramid. Because fiber is most efficient at carrying heavy volumes of data or
voice traffic, long-distance networks began converting to fiber optics a
decade ago, and they are now almost totally converted. Fiber optics has also
become cheaper than copper wire for connections between local telephone
switching centers and for big companies that need to move large amounts of
computer data.;   But fiber is still more expensive than copper for the local
loop, because the relatively low volume of traffic doesn't cover the high cost
of stringing fiber cable through neighborhoods and installing equipment at
individual homes or curbside units, serving several homes, that convert light
into electronic signals.;   More efficient designs could wipe out that cost
difference within a few years. But copper wire wears out slowly. If fiber is
put into the loop only when copper needs to be replaced, the conversion
process could take 30 or 40 years.;   That leaves telephone companies with a
"chicken and egg" dilemma. The types of advanced services portrayed in "First
Born" would generate extra revenue to cover the cost of installing fiber. But
there isn't any demand yet because there isn't any way to provide these
services today at a reasonable price.;   "To be honest with you, I think if
one looks at this very realistically, there is no mass market 'want' out
there," said Dale Harris, a former Pacific Bell executive who now directs the
Center for Telecommunications at Stanford University. "There is a wish list,
but when you talk about (customers) paying more, it's a different question."; 
 Telephone companies face several other roadblocks.;   A maze of federal laws
and state regulations prevents phone companies that provide local service --
Pacific Bell and GTE in Northern California -- from branching into other types
of telecommunications such as cable television, "electronic Yellow Pages" home
shopping, two-way video and home information services.;   Numerous opponents,
led by newspaper publishers and cable television operators, oppose relaxing
those barriers because they fear the possibility of a monopoly supported by
the phone companies' vastly greater financial resources. In California, the
state Public Utilities Commission is concerned enough about the risks to ban
Pac Bell and GTE -- at least for now -- from putting fiber in the local loop.;
  "If they make a huge investment and it doesn't pay off, it could affect
rate-payers because rates would have to go up to cover the cost," said David
Gamson, a senior analyst at the PUC's San Francisco office.;   The Federal
Communications Commission took the first step toward allowing telephone
companies into the video business with a surprise ruling on Oct. 24 that could
ultimately allow Pacific Bell and other local phone companies to provide
"video dial tone" service.;   Video dial tone would be similar to telephone
dial tone -- the customer would decide whom to call. A smart TV, connected to
video dial tone, would scan available programming from many different sources
and offer a selection to the viewer.;   Rapid changes in telecommunications
technology are also confusing the picture. New ways to compress electronic
signals and increase the capacity of copper wire are raising the possibility
that many advanced services could be offered without replacing copper in the
local loop.;   Cable companies, too, are considering whether to put fiber in
their loop -- a network almost as comprehensive as the local telephone system.
About 90 percent of households in the United States are already passed by a
cable network and about 60 percent of those households subscribe.;   This
network is built on coaxial cable, which has a much higher capacity than
copper wire. Cable television today is dedicated to a single purpose:
providing television signals. But cable operators are studying enhancements,
including increased use of fiber optics, to support new services that could
put them in direct competition with telephone companies.;   John J. Sie, head
of the Encore movie channel in Denver, said cable systems will build fiber
"nodes" within five years that will serve from 100 to 1,000 homes with up to
400 television channels and offer interactive services.;   Sie claims the
cable industry can make this switch for $100 per household, compared with
estimates of $1,200 per household for curbside fiber telephone service.
Telephone companies won't be able to make money with fiber in the loop,
according to Sie, unless they enter the video market -- unfairly competing
with cable companies, which don't have the cushion of regulated rates to
guarantee a profit.;   "We don't see any economic justification for retrofit"
of the local telephone loop with fiber, Sie said. "So we want to see a
business plan (from the telephone companies) that shows how they will get a
return" without unreasonable rate increases.  </TEXT>
