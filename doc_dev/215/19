   SAN FRANCISCO -- Callers who aren't happy with the
baseball scores, stock tips and a host of other California
900-number telephone services can get their money back.
   Pacific Bell made the policy public yesterday; the local
telephone unit of Pacific Telesis Group already had been
arranging refunds on disputed 900 calls on a case-by-case
basis, a spokesman said.

   The move comes amid increasing public concern about
900-number services, which charge high rates that callers
often dispute. It also is part of a recent trend by phone
companies to take a lower profile on the 900 services, many
of which offer pornographic or lewd messages. Many have
recently decided not to provide billing for pornographic 900
services, forcing the providers to arrange their own
elaborate payment systems. Pacific Bell stopped billing last
month after a California court lifted an injunction
prohibiting it from denying billing based on message content.
   Pacific Bell said that it will give customers a full
refund of charges they incur on California 900 or 976
information numbers if they aren't happy with the "quality"
or "value" of the service. Pacific Bell said the terms of
service agreements it has with 900 providers allows for such
customer refunds in cases of disputed calls.
   Jim Coffee, vice president and general manager of Audio
Communications Inc., a Las Vegas-based provider of
general-information and sports-news lines, said he thought
the policy was reasonable. "Our own policy is that if a
caller is not satisfied, we just refund the money," he said,
adding that "reputable" providers such as his have relatively
few refund requests.
