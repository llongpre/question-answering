press for more favourable rules on their access to cable television markets

US local telephone companies still plan a fight over some portions of the
telecommunications bill now making its way towards the Senate floor, even
though they accepted a compromise on some of the conditions it would place
on their entry into the long distance telephone market.
The seven leading local telephone companies known as the Baby Bells, which
were set up by the court-ordered break-up of the AT&amp;T monopoly in 1984,
agreed to a compromise on the long distance market that allowed the
telecommunications bill to be approved by the Senate commerce committee last
week.
But Bell executives are still promising a battle over the bill's rules for
allowing them into the cable television market while cable companies are
allowed into the local telephone market.
'The key problem for us in the Senate bill right now is the sequencing and
timing on cable entry,' said Mr Robert Stewart of Pacific Telesis, the Baby
Bell that provides local telephone service in California and parts of
Nevada.
'The cable companies are basically allowed into our market after a year. The
regulatory barriers in place would probably keep us out of cable for three
or four or five years,' he added.
A similar telecommunications bill passed the full House of Representatives
with relatively little rancour in June. When the full Senate passes its
version, the two bills must still be reconciled before the measure can
become law. Some supporters of reform fear that Congress is running out of
time to complete this before it breaks up for November's elections.
The cable companies represent probably the most serious threat to the Bells'
monopoly over local telephone service.
While some long distance companies have used the argument that the Bells
face no competition in their core market during the debate over the bill, it
is not thought that many of them will want to go to the expense of running
wires into consumers' homes. Cable companies, however, already have a
network on which they might be able to carry telecommunications besides
their current television programming.
The Senate bill agreed by the commerce committee last week would allow the
cable companies to provide telephone service without restriction one year
after enactment. But Bell officials complain that they would have to wait
for the Federal Communications Commission to lay out new regulations for
universal service before they could enter the cable market, which could
delay them for years.
The commerce committee agreed, however, to an amendment that would prevent
the new telecommunications bill from overriding court decisions or state
laws that have already opened the door for Bell companies wishing to provide
video services.
This could have implications for Nynex, the New York and New England Bell,
which is already affected by New York state laws opening up competition, and
for Bell Atlantic and US West, two other regional Bells, which have won
court decisions in favour of their right to own cable companies.
Many senators feel, however, that they promised the cable industry a degree
of protection from the Bells when in earlier legislation they required cable
companies to carry certain types of programming.
'In the Cable Act we did assure the cable companies that because of the
extraordinary regulations imposed on them, we would protect them from the
intrusions of the telephone companies,' said Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii
during arguments over the telecommunications bill last week.
