CENSUS CAN BE A PUZZLE;

<P>
Even for one who commands English with the aplomb of a Laurence Olivier, 
filling out a census form can be tough. 
</P>
<P>
But imagine trying to complete the questionnaire armed only with knowledge of 
the Vietnamese, Thai or Tagalog languages. 
</P>
<P>
That's where people like Chi Duy Do come in. A volunteer for the U.S. Census 
Bureau, Do is one of scores of people in Orange County and across the country 
working to ensure that those who speak foreign tongues will be tallied in the 
nationwide head count. 
</P>
<P>
They are stationed at toll-free telephone lines or ensconced at temporary 
assistance centers in community agencies, churches and other locations. Do has 
the Vietnamese of Orange County as his customers, and his task has not been 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
"They call me and ask me, 'What is census?' " Do said Thursday as he sat in the 
offices of the Santa Ana-based Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a 
social service agency where he usually works as a counselor. "They don't know 
the meaning. After explaining it to them, I ask them to spread the word . . . 
but I fear that many, many Vietnamese people will not be counted." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, problems have already started to crop up. 
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that some newcomers from Southeast Asia have thrown 
their census forms away, figuring that the government documents were junk mail. 
</P>
<P>
"In my neighborhood, I have seen in the trash maybe two or three 
questionnaires," said Do, who has also received phone calls from half a dozen 
other Vietnamese immigrants who mistakenly threw out the census form. "They 
don't understand. They think it is advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the centers have yet to start doing a breakneck business. At the 
Vietnamese community center, for instance, only about a dozen people have 
called or visited since the forms were mailed March 23. Do was able, however, 
to explain the census to about 40 elderly Vietnamese during a meeting of senior 
citizens on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Many non-English-speaking residents may have resorted to ringing up the Census 
Bureau's toll-free telephone network. Nationwide, about 9,000 people have 
called the phone lines serving Asian languages, according to Ken Riccini, the 
bureau's assistant chief of processing centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-language lines have been another matter entirely. Calls have jammed 
the system for days. The bureau has added more lines, but reports persisted 
Thursday of callers getting only a busy signal despite repeated dialings. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Census Bureau are well aware of all the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with large printing costs and various computer-programming difficulties, 
the Census Bureau mails out questionnaires only in English. Each form also has 
a phone number for ordering a copy in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
But those who speak other languages must fend for themselves, seek help from 
census employees on the bureau's toll-free telephone lines, or head to one of 
the more than 75 volunteer assistance centers in Orange County and thousands 
more throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Duy Do and other volunteers use their bilingual skills to translate the 
census for often-befuddled newcomers, many of them from lands that never held 
such a nationwide canvass. 
</P>
<P>
If someone shows up speaking an unfamiliar language, the volunteers employ 
booklets that translate the census into 32 languages. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such efforts, leaders of minority groups throughout the United States 
worry that the language barrier and inherent fears of government intrusion will 
combine to cause an undercount among many of the people who could benefit most 
from the census. 
</P>
<P>
The once-a-decade head count is used to figure political apportionment and 
distribution of more than $70 billion in federal assistance for programs 
ranging from highway construction to social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The census is something that is very unfamiliar to the Southeast Asian 
community in general and the Vietnamese in particular," said Tuong Duy Nguyen, 
executive director of the Vietnamese community center, which serves the 130,000 
to 150,000 immigrants in Orange County. "They don't know how good the census is 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
Some newcomers fear that information gleaned by the census might be used 
against them, he said. In particular, they worry that revelations such as 
several families crammed into one tiny apartment might bring them to the 
attention of housing authorities, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
And many Vietnamese don't trust the Census Bureau's promises of 
confidentiality, he continued, because of their experience with the government 
in their homeland -- a "distrust in the system" that has been carried to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes time to change the philosophy, the way of thinking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said the effort to count the Southeast Asian community has been 
undermined in part by a lack of census employees to spread the word in the 
months before the count and to promote the effort among the Vietnamese and 
other immigrants. The bureau has only a single employee, Vong Ngo, serving as 
liaison to the Southeast Asian community all across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ngo expects that only about half the Vietnamese in Orange County 
will end up returning their census forms. Many of the rest will be counted 
during a post-census effort involving phone calls to non-respondents and visits 
to homes, Ngo said. Even then, he expects only 70% to 80% of the community to 
be counted. 
</P>
<P>
But the short, bespectacled father of two has not given up. Ngo said he plans 
to hold a press conference on Monday with reporters from immigrant newspapers 
in Orange County to spark more articles about the census and its importance.
