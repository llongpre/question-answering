CREW RAZING GAS STATION SEVERS TELEPHONE CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A backhoe operator demolishing a gas station Wednesday morning accidentally cut 
two telephone cables, leaving more than 500 Pacific Bell customers without 
service until evening. 
</P>
<P>
The backhoe was being used by a work crew to unearth the station's three large 
gasoline storage tanks at Del Obispo Street and Camino Capistrano, according to 
telephone company officials. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the cables got really chewed up," said George Travieso, a member of the 
the repair team that worked throughout the day to splice an estimated 1,000 
pairs of broken wires that stuck out of the 4-foot-deep hole left by the 
backhoe. 
</P>
<P>
Service to customers along Del Obispo, between Camino Capistrano and Ortega 
Highway, was restored at about 7 p.m., Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen 
said late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Carnes, another Pacific Bell representative, said the accident occurred 
because the contractor for the Southland Corp., which was supervising the 
demolition, had failed to notify utilities 48 hours ahead of time of its plan 
to unearth the tanks. Carnes said the fine for failing to report digging 
operations can be up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Manos, vice president of MacIntosh Construction, said he had neglected to 
notify the telephone company and conceded that the phone line was clearly 
marked. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just an accident," he said.
