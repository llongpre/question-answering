   The Federal Communications Commission on
Wednesday gave General Telephone Co. of California permission to
build a coaxial cable TV system and permission to test a
state-of-the-art fiber-optic system that will allow customers to
order movies every 15 minutes by phone.
   The ruling, which was watched closely by cable TV operators who
fear entry of huge telephone companies into their turf, affirmed a
preliminary decision last year to let General Telephone build and
operate the coaxial (bundled copper wire) cable system in the Los
Angeles suburb of Cerritos. GTE of California also provides phone
service to Cerritos.
   The FCC said there had been no adequate bids submitted to the
city of Cerritos for cable service except from General Telephone.
GTE is leasing the system to Apollo CableVision to provide
programming.
   A GTE affiliate, GTE Services Corp., will install a fiber-optic
cable network to experiment with services such as near-video on
demand, which will allow customers to phone in orders for movies
that will be running on 30 channels. Some movies will begin every
15 minutes.
   Wednesday's decision was challenged immediately by the National
Cable Television Association, which said it appears to violate
federal rules generally barring telephone companies from the cable
TV business.
   Current rules bar phone companies from generating cable
programming in the same areas where they provide telephone service.
Federal rules also bar the seven regional Bell operating companies
from owning cable services anywhere in the country, but allow
companies like GTE to do so outside their service areas.
   The FCC in July 1988 preliminarily voted to consider
recommending to Congress that telephone companies be allowed into
cable TV in the regions they serve. The FCC also suggested it would
try to encourge telephone companies to enter cable TV, even if
Congress fails to act, by broadly defining ``good cause'' for
waivers.
   The FCC said it probably would grant waivers if telephone
companies wire homes with fiber and allow competitors to use those
wires to sell video programs too.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said Wednesday's ruling did not
presage any final FCC judgment on the cable-telephone company issue.
   ``This grant of this very limited waiver may produce very
valuable information that will be useful to the commssion and the
Congress in evaluating that more generic question,'' he said. ``The
precedent that results is narrow.''
