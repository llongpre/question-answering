<HEAD>NEW YORK: phone numbers.</HEAD>

   Bigger operators use television. Evening television movies are
interrupted with all kinds of invitations, sometimes attractive
young women, purring, ``There's a party on your line whenever you
want. Call as often as you want.''
   Businesses that deal in sex have never been known for truth in
advertising, but the expansion and invasion of the information
telephone services, sanctioned by state and local authorities, is
becoming troublesome to many.
   In California, the state legislature and the Public Service
Commission made it mandatory for the telephone company to block
lines to such calls at the customer's request. Pacific Bell has a
suit pending against a dozen dial-a-porn operators to force them to
cease and desist on the basis that they are damaging Pacific Bell's
reputation.
   New York Telephone says it makes an effort to survey the talk
lines and operators are required to provide monitors who can cut off
disruptive or obscene callers. While this works on some lines, it
doesn't seem to work on others.
   New York Telephone will now block dial-it calls from residences
for free. Until this January, there was a $5 charge. Businesses must
pay $10 and up, depending on the number of lines.
   The company will also cancel the charges the first time, if the
customer complains that a child or teen-ager made the calls without
parental permission. After that, the customer is urged to have the
line blocked, or keep their youngsters off the phone.
   The phone company loses nothing. It gets half the charge whether
the dial-it service collects or not. One West Coast company says
uncollected calls cost it $400,000 a year.
   Southern Bell shut down dial-a-porn services in Miami and Atlanta
in 1984 and so far has been upheld by the courts.
   The option of blocking calls apparently did not reach Vilma
Lantiqua, a 49-year-old mother of a 17-year-old high school dropout
in New York City. Her son, Sergio, had run up a $1,400 phone bill,
calling various party lines. In desperation she put the phone in her
daughter's padlocked bedroom. So one night in January, Sergio broke
into his mother's bedroom, stuffed a sock in her mouth and strangled
her, police said.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case this spring in
which a California dial-a-porn operator, Sable Communications in the
Los Angeles area, is challenging bans on dial-a-porn as abridgements
of freedom of speech.
   The law under contest is a 1988 federal statute that bans
sexually explicit telephone message services. The law prohibits any
obscene or indecent communications for commercial purposes over
interstate lines. It provides for fines up to $500,000 and prison
terms up to two years.
   Whatever course the Supreme Court decides, there are a number of
area phone companies which, fearing adverse reaction will affect the
telephone information business in general, are planning to curtail
or segregate the pornographic and gab lines.
   The revenues are important. One New York state official said the
information services help subsidize the general telephone services.
   Those services which cater to homosexuals are more serious than
other gab lines. They permit callers to talk with a group or
``barhop'' by pressing a designated key on push-button phones. One
operator of such lines says they perform a real service, all the
more critical in the gay community since the AIDs epidemic.
   ``Talking to someone before jumping into bed with him is a good
thing to do,'' he says. ``Gays take this more seriously than do the
straights who tend to goof off and hambone on the gab lines.''
   Most often dial-it profits are illusory, a gamble at best.
Quality equipment is expensive, some devices running $2,000 a line
or more. They force a telephone line, capable of carrying two
voices, to carry six to eight.
   Most operations start with bright ideas, some never come to
fruition, some fail for lack of continuing innovation. It is a
copycat business. Some reserved lines are still vacant. There are
thousands more available.
   The reason, one said, is that the field is littered with dead
bodies, lost fortunes. Yet there are 200 million telephones out
there, each a potential market.
   Like many new ideas these days, this one started in the Western
states. Ominously, that is where some of the harshest controls are
showing up.
   But gab lines are not likely to go away. As one frequent caller
says, ``It's cheaper than going out.''
   Or was.
