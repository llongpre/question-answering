The California Public Utilities Commission granted 32 nonprofit groups nearly 
$5 million Wednesday under a special consumer program financed by a fine levied 
against Pacific Bell for abusive marketing practices in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
Created at the suggestion of Public Advocates, a San Francisco public-interest 
law firm, the program is intended to help, among others, people with low 
incomes and those who speak little or no English. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell was fined after the commission determined that the company was 
guilty in many cases of persuading low-income and non-English-speaking 
customers to sign up for special services without making it clear that these 
features were optional and cost extra. The services included speed-dialing and 
call-forwarding. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the case, Pacific Bell was forced to make $63 million in refunds 
to 495,000 of its 8.5 million residential customers. In addition, Pacific Bell 
was fined $16.5 million by the PUC. Public Advocates persuaded the PUC to set 
aside that money for consumer education for the groups most hurt by the 
high-pressure marketing practices. 
</P>
<P>
The money is to be spent over six years, under the administration of the 
California Community Foundation in Los Angeles. The $5 million granted 
Wednesday was the first allocation of the $16.5-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
"This trust fund will create the best-educated low-income, minority, 
non-English-speaking consumers in the country," predicted Robert Gnaizda, 
founding partner of Public Advocates. The largest single grant went to San 
Francisco-based Consumer Advocates to develop educational materials and work 
with other grantees. California/Nevada Community Action Assn. will get 
$669,000, which will develop training programs for the other participating 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups include the Union of Pan Asian Communities and the Chicano 
Federation of San Diego County, which jointly received $535,000 for programs to 
reach speakers of Spanish, Vietnamese, Hmong, Lao and Khmer. A consortium 
headed by Los Angeles' Korean Youth Center will receive $20,000 to develop a 
telephone referral and information network for Korean, Chinese, Japanese and 
Filipino consumers.
