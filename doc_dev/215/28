For years, Americans have ridiculed Southern California's fabled rootlessness, 
that sense of disconnected ennui, New Age cocooning and traffic-jam isolation 
chronicled by unfriendly East Coast writers. 
</P>
<P>
Californians themselves often have been impatient with such analysis and quick 
to discount it as envy and sour grapes from people bitter about lack of 
sunshine and orange blossoms in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, marketing researchers from the frosty environs of Fairfield, 
Conn., have produced a troubling survey that seems to back up with real numbers 
some longstanding impressions about the self-absorbed West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Survey Sampling Inc. reports that residents of Los Angeles have become so 
disdainful of uninvited contact with the outside world that more than half have 
unlisted telephone numbers, far more than in any major city in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Connecticut company, which sells telephone numbers to market research 
firms, said the 56% figure for unlisted numbers in Los Angeles is exceeded only 
in Las Vegas, whose residents' rootlessness and nighttime schedules have 
produced an unlisted phone rate of 60.3%. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 8 of the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas for unlisted 
numbers are in California. 
</P>
<P>
John Lamb, the firm's client-service specialist, said he is not certain what 
produced this phenomenon but gives some credence to the notion that "a lot of 
people who live in California screwed up something in the East and are trying 
to get as far away from that and from other people as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor may be a high percentage of young adults in the West. The survey 
shows that, throughout the country, two-thirds of those with unlisted numbers 
are under 40. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike older Americans, many of whom apparently consider unlisted numbers 
faintly unneighborly, the younger generation appears to see great advantage in 
keeping its phone numbers secret from salesmen, fund-raisers and rejected 
suitors, even if it costs an extra 30 cents a month. 
</P>
<P>
The average percentage of unlisted numbers for all metropolitan areas in the 
country climbed from 21.8% in 1984 to 27.6% last year, and Lamb said the steady 
growth will continue. 
</P>
<P>
Charlene Baldwin, spokeswoman for Pacific Bell, said her records show a 
somewhat smaller percentage of unlisted numbers. About 45% of the company's 1.9 
million customers in Los Angeles County are unlisted, as are about 40% of all 
Bell customers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once a Sign of Fame 
</P>
<P>
This goes much higher in areas such as Beverly Hills, "where you don't see a 
very large phone book," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlisted numbers once were considered signs of fame and fortune, of people too 
important to be bothered. But the survey indicates a similar reluctance on the 
lower end of the income scale to list telephone numbers, particularly as 
computerized campaigns to sell everything from toothpaste to travel packages 
flood telephone lines around dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
Many people take their numbers out of the book in the hope of preventing such 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
This often does not work, because many firms use random-dialing systems that 
catch unlisted numbers anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting customer distress plants potentially profitable seeds of interest 
in a new device that will let the discriminating resident screen all calls 
while the phone is ringing. 
</P>
<P>
Known as "Caller ID" or "Custom Local Area Signaling Service (CLASS)," the 
system uses a small, $80 box that attaches to the telephone and provides a 
digital display of the number from which the call is placed. If the number is 
unfamiliar or that of an annoying friend or angry boss, the call can be 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said the system is to be introduced in California over the next year 
and will include such refinements as a special ring for calls from special 
friends whose numbers have been programmed into the device. 
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey, where the system is available, initial response was "three times 
what we expected," said New Jersey Bell spokesman James W. Carrigan. 
</P>
<P>
Washington ranks only eighth among major metropolitan areas and 47th overall in 
unlisted numbers, but its 26.2% -- very close to C&amp;P Telephone Co. 
estimates -- is enough to suggest a healthy market for Caller ID. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone surprises, unpleasant or otherwise, then would diminish. Life would 
proceed more quietly in self-sufficient cocoons of automatic telephone 
monitoring, videocassette recorders and shopping by cable, letting 
introspection continue without further interruption.
