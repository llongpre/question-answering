In vacating a 1985 Federal Communications Commission rule Wednesday, a federal 
appeals court handed back to states authority to regulate newer telephone 
services such as voice mail and computer access. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals opinion, which affected seven lawsuits, means 
some telephone companies might have to set up separate corporations for their 
regulated normal telephone services and their unregulated extra options. The 
FCC would have allowed the companies to merge their regulated and unregulated 
services, but now that decision would rest with each state. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed three of the lawsuits 
against the FCC, heralded the appeals court decision, but a spokesman for 
Pacific Bell said it could cost customers more in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"It properly gives the states greater freedom to promote the development of 
enhanced services and the terms and conditions upon which those services are 
provided," PUC President G. Mitchell Wilk said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Harris, director of planning and policy for Pacific Bell, said the 
company supports state regulation. But he said Pacific Bell fears state control 
could lead to a costly corporate division of its regulated and unregulated 
services -- something the FCC required in mid-1984 before it changed its mind 
14 months later, bringing on the 1987 legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear that we are going to have to split off," Harris said. "It's up 
to the states. But we strongly believe that independent subsidiaries are not 
necessary and would make it more difficult to provide the services to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said innovative communications systems, which have developed rapidly in 
the past 10 years, are a multibillion-dollar industry that ranges from voice 
and electronic mail to automatic teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
An FCC spokeswoman said the opinion is a setback for the communications 
industry, which under federal rules had been required to merely keep finances 
separate for unregulated and regulated services but not create detached 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"We adopted the rules because we believed they would be in the public 
interest," she said. "So, of course, we're disappointed in the outcome. We have 
to start from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ordered the FCC to develop new rules to help regulate new 
telecommunications services offered by the Baby Bell companies. Until the 
disputed FCC rule, those smaller firms had been prevented from providing 
information services under a court decree that stripped AT&amp;T of its local 
operating companies in January, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The court said the FCC arbitrarily and capriciously reversed itself without 
showing that cost-shifting between unregulated and regulated services wouldn't 
occur and raise the bills of "captive telephone customers." 
</P>
<P>
"The record yields no evidence that the (Bell Operating Companies) power to 
extract monopoly rents from local telephone customers has diminished," the 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
The complicated set of lawsuits attracted interveners from most 
telecommunications firms that compete with the telephone companies.
