The Brock family in San Clemente kept trying to get through. After 2 1/2 days, 
nerves were frazzled and worn thin. Then, late Thursday afternoon from Santa 
Cruz came the telephone call from Bob Brock's sister, who said: "We're safe. 
No, we didn't get hurt, and Mom's OK." 
</P>
<P>
Brock's sister, Betty Rucker, and his 90-year-old mother, Freda Brock, were 
emotionally shaken but safe after Tuesday's 6.9 temblor, which left much of 
downtown Santa Cruz in rubble. And Rucker herself had escaped injury because 
she left her work at a department store in the Santa Cruz mall about about an 
hour before the earthquake hit at 5:04 p.m. One woman died in the store, and 
another was critically injured when the roof collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Magdalena Ortega's vigil also ended Thursday when the Huntington Beach woman 
finally got word that both her nieces -- Maria Prado of Hollister and Lupe 
Palomares of San Jose, and their families -- were safe. "It was the fear of not 
knowing," a much-relieved Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of other Orange County residents unable to reach relatives in 
quake-devastated Northern California jammed telephone lines to the local 
offices of the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army in hopes of getting 
news. 
</P>
<P>
But Red Cross officials in Santa Ana said Thursday that they have been 
powerless to try to reach loved ones in the San Francisco Bay Area on behalf of 
thousands of people who called them. 
</P>
<P>
"Our volunteers have just been overwhelmed with the flood of people calling in 
here. With no way to communicate to Northern California, we are, essentially, 
helping people wait," Red Cross spokeswoman Sylvia Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
And so the thousands of requests -- called "disaster welfare inquiries" -- from 
local residents to contact loved ones sat untouched in a bin at the Santa Ana 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is try and reassure family members down here. We're giving them 
options," Stewart said. "Like advising them to contact relatives in other 
states on the chance that they may have received word from relatives in San 
Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said contributions for quake relief reached $41,835 Thursday, up 300% 
from Wednesday. And more than 900 pints of blood had been collected in the 
first 24 hours after the quake, prompting the Red Cross to reduce its 
blood-donating hours on Friday and during the weekend, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we have no indication that we will be needing more blood," Stewart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman in Orange County said telephone service 
to the Bay Area had improved Thursday, but many people continued to experience 
difficulty calling the Santa Cruz and San Francisco areas. Pacific Bell 
officials continued to advise customers to call only if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The network was clogged," said Linda Bonnicksen of Pacific Bell. "But the 
network came through OK. It's just that customers began picking up their 
telephones all at the same time and it almost collapsed our system. (But) more 
calls are going through more freely throughout the state." 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, where 80 bilingual Pacific Bell operators handled calls from 
throughout the state from Spanish-speaking customers, volume jumped 25% 
Wednesday, up from an average of 14,000 calls a day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our operators talked to one man who had tried to reach his son in San Jose. 
The minute he heard the voice of one of our Spanish-speaking operators, he 
started crying. Apparently it had been a very frustrating time for him," 
Bonnicksen said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Brocks' days of frantic calls to Santa Cruz, it was Betty Rucker 
who finally reached them in San Clemente, said Rose-Marie Brock, adding: "She 
said that Tuesday's quake was a close call." 
</P>
<P>
"At least we know they're safe," Bob Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, a saleswoman at Ford's Department Store in the downtown mall, told them 
she usually works until 5 p.m. But on Tuesday, she went in an hour earlier than 
usual and left about 4 p.m. When the earthquake struck little more than a hour 
later, the front of the building collapsed, killing one woman inside and 
critically injuring another on the sidewalk, the Brocks said. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister was upset because she couldn't get hold of me," he said. "Is she 
frightened? She doesn't even want to go back downtown to look at the rubble." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Prado told Magdalena Ortega and other relatives in Orange County that to 
call them, she had to drive to Gilroy from Hollister, where telephone service 
had been interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was extensive in Hollister, an older rural community with many 
wood-frame homes, she said.
