A 24-hour telephone message system intended to assist county residents with 
personal and health-care needs and provide up-to-date information about 
countywide educational, recreational, cultural and volunteer opportunities 
began operation Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Recorded in Spanish and English by local and national celebrities, InfoPartner 
features more than 110 audio messages dealing with such topics as health, 
physical and sexual abuse, employment and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"InfoPartner is a very special gift because it will reach so many people with a 
wide spectrum of information over a long period of time," Gary Johnson, United 
Way chairman of the board, told about 200 guests assembled in the Fluor Corp. 
Flag Courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
The system is accessible from any touch tone telephone. Callers need only dial 
(714) 253-7766 then enter a three-digit code corresponding to the message they 
wish to hear. Callers are then given information about other agencies or phone 
numbers to call about their specific area of interest. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in a message entitled "Living With Stress," K-Ocean radio 
announcer Holly Adams spells out the major causes and symptoms of stress and 
tells callers that failure to address problems associated with stress may lead 
to serious physical and mental problems. Another voice then instructs callers 
to contact the Family Service Assn. at (714) 838-7377 to speak with a counselor 
if further assistance is needed.

Funded primarily by a $180,000 grant from the Pacific Mutual Foundation, the 
program has enlisted the support of several businesses and community service 
organizations. It is funded for the first three years but will require 
community support in order to continue, said Tom Sutton, chairman and chief 
executive officer of Pacific Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"InfoPartner is an important community resource for our English- as well as our 
Spanish-speaking community," Sutton said. "We're really fortunate to live in 
Orange County. Many of us were attracted here from somewhere else. It is for 
that reason that many of us are motivated to do things to make sure that those 
attractive features continue and that our problems are addressed and 
minimized." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Watson, board chairwoman of the Volunteer Center of Santa Ana, said the 
message system should have a great impact on her program, which provides 
volunteers for various community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only are there messages from Barbara Bush, Gloria Deukmejian and Whoopi 
Goldberg about the benefits of volunteering, but there are specific messages 
for young people, for seniors, for corporate volunteers," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the changing needs of the community, the program will be monitored by 
United Way on a monthly basis and updated twice yearly, said George Phillips, a 
United Way worker who helped to develop the system. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see between 100,000 and 150,000 calls the first year." 
</P>
<P>
The technical nucleus of the message system was developed by the marketing 
communications firm of Palmer, Sharritt &amp; Company Inc., which has set up 
similar programs in other parts of the country. The firm provided examples from 
users about how those programs have affected their lives.

For instance, a message on teen-age suicide recorded by actor Mike Farrell 
prevented a young boy from committing suicide, Johnson said. In a letter to the 
actor, the boy wrote: "Many things you say seem to be true. I also happen to 
believe that it does not indicate I am insane just because I feel my life is 
not worth living any longer. I will hang in there a little longer." ROBERT E.
