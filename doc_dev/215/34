   Unions representing 157,000 workers went on
strike against three regional telephone companies Sunday, slowing
local phone service in 15 states and the District of Columbia.
   Nine Southeastern states were spared telephone strikes as the
Communications Workers of America and BellSouth reached a tentative
agreement on a new, three-year contract late Saturday.
   But technicians, operators , clerical personnel, sales and
factory workers at NYNEX Corp., Bell Atlantic Corp. and Pacific
Telesis began strikes Sunday after talks failed.
   No talks were scheduled with NYNEX or Bell Atlantic, which
together provide telephone service to the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic regions.
   Informal talks were held Sunday in California between Pacific
Telesis, CWA and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, but no progress was reported.
   ``We are talking but we seem to be making very slow progress,''
said CWA spokeswoman Vira Milirides.
   No formal talks in any of the strikes were scheduled for Monday
but informal bargaining was expected to continue, with resumption
of fomal negotiations hinging on those discussions.
   People who dial direct should find little interruption in
service in the strike areas, company and union officials said.
   But consumers needing operator or directory assistance often
were greeted Sunday with recordings saying heavy call volume had
slowed service _ and that situation would worsen with the start of
the workweek Monday.
   Installations and repairs also would be slowed if the strikes
drag on and the companies try to operate with management personnel
in place of strikers.
   In all three strike situations, the unions and companies
remained well apart on the issues of wages and health insurance,
and a number of local issues remained unresolved in each set of
negotiations as well. The debate over health insurance has been the
major obstacle, with the unions resisting companies' efforts to
shift some costs to workers.
   The greatest differences appear to be between the unions and
NYNEX. That strike was called well before the midnight Saturday
deadline because the differences were so great no formal talks were
held Saturday.
   CWA represents 40,000 NYNEX workers and IBEW an additional
20,000. The company, based in New York, provides local phone
service in New York and the six New England states and went through
a nine-day strike three years ago.
   ``We were prepared for this and got our management teams out
there at midnight,''' said NYNEX spokesman John Bonomo. ``But
things may start to back up as we get the crunch on Monday.''
   At Pacific Telesis, the strike was called at midnight California
time _ 3 a.m. EDT _ but negotiations continued through much of the
night. The talks recessed Sunday morning but were expected to
resume although company officials said nothing was scheduled
officially. The company serves parts of California and all of
Nevada and employs 44,500 union workers, all but 2,500 of them CWA
members.
   The strike deadline at Bell Atlantic was extended as
negotiations continued past midnight Saturday but a walkout was
called just before 7 a.m. Sunday because of a lack of progress.
   Edward G. Grogan, Bell Atlantic's vice president of labor
relations, expressed disappointment the union had rejected a
``progressive settlement with a significant compensation package,
improved health care services and a long list of family care and
employment security provisions.''
   But the CWA's Bill Bickers said the company's offer of
``retrogressive wages and benefits is a slap in the face to all of
our members.''
   Bell Atlantic serves Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the nations capital. CWA
represents 41,000 Bell Atlantic workers, IBEW 11,500.
   The BellSouth agreement provides an immediate 4 percent pay
increase and cost of living adjustments in 1990 and 1991, BellSouth
officials said Sunday. The pact also provides for employees to
receive up to 12 months of child care leave and receive six months
of medical coverage while on leave.
   Three more of the so-called ``Baby Bells'' spawned by the 1984
breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph face strike deadlines at
the end of the week.
   Contracts expire Saturday at Ameritech, US West and Southwestern
Bell. Together, those companies employ 131,000 union workers in 24
states.
