Vietnamese community leaders have been invited by Pacific Bell to help 
celebrate on Wednesday the opening of the telephone company's Vietnamese 
Service Center in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The new center, which is part of the telephone company's Asian marketing plan, 
will have eight Vietnamese-speaking employees taking orders for residential 
telephone service and answering billing inquires in Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties, company spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell will hold an open house at the center, which is in the Pacific 
Bell office complex in Tustin at 1472 Edinger Ave., in Room 2150 of Building 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Service Center is expected to expand its services to include San 
Diego County in February and Los Angeles County in June. By 1990, the center 
expects to serve the estimated 278,000 Vietnamese living in California, said 
Reed L. Royalty, Pacific Bell area vice president.
