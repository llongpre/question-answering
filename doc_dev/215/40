LOCAL PHONE COMPANIES FEELING HEAT

Pacific Bell, GTE California and the state's 20-odd other local phone companies 
still enjoy virtual monopolies in their respective service areas. But that is 
changing -- in ways that promise to revolutionize the way consumers and 
businesses buy and receive phone service. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way that giant American Telephone &amp; Telegraph has lost market 
share to smaller upstarts in the long-distance business, a handful of 
entrepreneurial competitors are asking regulators to open local phone markets 
further to competition. That will enable them to cash in on a growing business 
and chip away at the market shares enjoyed by Pacific Bell and other local 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
So far, such increased competition is minimal. But the prospect of its growth 
was a major factor cited by Pacific Telesis on Thursday in announcing that it 
will cut 16% of its work force in the next five years, mostly in its Pacific 
Bell unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the next five years, it's etched very keenly in everybody's minds 
that we have to do this to remain competitive," said Pacific Telesis 
spokeswoman Amy Damianakes. 
</P>
<P>
An example of the new breed of competitor is Metropolitan Fiber Service, a 
2-year-old private venture that offers local connections to big business in a 
dozen U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Our competition today is in what is designated as special access only, a very 
small part of the total access (provided by) the Bell operating companies," 
said George Tronsrue, a vice president of Metropolitan Fiber Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Its local links connect major telecommunications users, such as brokerages and 
other financial institutions, to the long-distance carriers of their choice, 
bypassing local public networks run by Pacific Bell and other local phone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Fiber Systems, based in the Chicago suburb of Oakbrook, Ill., 
installs its switching system in the heart of a major metropolitan area -- 800 
W. 6th St. in Los Angeles. Then it extends high-capacity, high-fidelity optical 
fiber strands to connect surrounding buildings to one another, creating its own 
local network. This in turn is hooked to the nearby switching machines of such 
long-distance carriers as AT&amp;T, MCI, US Sprint and the more than 100 other 
more specialized long-haul companies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small niche, but a viable business for us," Tronsrue said. "But when 
you look at what else is there, there is a significant portion of local-access 
service that we are precluded from developing." 
</P>
<P>
Building a tiny niche into a big business mirrors the genesis two decades ago 
of MCI, which began by handling private traffic by microwave between St. Louis 
and Chicago and parlayed that into opening the entire long-distance 
telecommunications market to competition. 
</P>
<P>
Now federal and state regulators are begining to lighten their control over 
AT&amp;T, which has watched its former long-distance monopoly shrink to a 
two-thirds share of the market. At the same time, MCI and US Sprint have grown 
into billion-dollar concerns themselves, and both now are also profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Metropolitan Fiber Systems has asked federal authorities to let it broaden 
its entry into local telecommunications. It seeks the right to plug its private 
customers into the Baby Bells' local networks, paying just for the part of 
local service that it needs to complete its own system. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission also has called hearings this year 
on opening the local monopoly. Tronsrue said MFS intends to make its same 
appeal to the state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Doing so would require and the local giants to break down service into "basic 
service elements" and offer these for sale separately. But today, Tronsrue 
said, would-be competitors like MFS must pay for a connection to the local 
switching machine, which they don't need, in addition to the transportation to 
their customer's local phone lines, which they do. 
</P>
<P>
But competition is not a one way street. Pacific Bell and other Baby Bells want 
to get into other markets themselves. They are pressing Congress and the 
Federal Communications Commission to amend the nation's cable television laws 
to let them carry video signals, which they currently are prohibited to do 
within their service areas. An unregulated PacTel subsidiary already has 
entered cable TV in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about 10 years overdue," said Stuart Crane, telecommunications analyst 
with Gruntal &amp; Co. "They should have competition from the Bell companies. 
There is no reason (today) for the (1984) Cable Act." 
</P>
<P>
GTE California, under special FCC authorization, carries cable television for 
ApolloVision in Cerritos, testing the capabilities and qualities of three forms 
of transmission: traditional copper wire, coaxial (or two-way) cable and 
optical-fiber cable. As a part of that test, a handful of Cerritos households 
-- actually only five -- this year will enjoy optical-fiber links to their 
homes that will enable them to sample such services as home banking and 
shopping andcalling up movies to be viewed on demand -- services already 
available to telephone customers in France.
