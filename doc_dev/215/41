THE AVERAGE telephone line in the US is used for only 20 minutes a day. For
the remaining 23 hours and 40 minutes, it is dead. This basic fact underlies
the current convergence between the telecommunications and cable television
industries, which was epitomised by this week's Dollars 22bn bid for
Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television group, by Bell
Atlantic, a large regional telecommunications carrier.
Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications believe that by combining forces they
will be able to sell customers a rich diet of services over a single
network: ordinary entertainment and telephone services to start with, but
eventually home shopping, access to databases, picture telephones and much
else. The same desire to fill the unused hours on the telephone lines with
extra services underlies recent multi-billion dollar investments in cable
television by US West and Nynex, two other US regional telecommunications
carriers.
There are those who are sceptical about the current enthusiasm for
'multi-media' convergence. They point out that attempts to merge
telecommunications and computing companies in the early 1980s failed because
it was impossible to devise products which appealed sufficiently to
customers. Similarly, it has yet to be proved that customers want to buy new
multi-media services.
Cost advantages
But the industrial logic driving the convergence of cable TV and
telecommunications does not rely on consumers showing interest in new and as
yet unproved multi-media services. There are cost advantages in combining
ordinary entertainment and telephone services over a single infrastructure.
This has already been shown in the UK, which has become a telecommunications
laboratory since deregulation in the mid-1980s. British cable TV companies
are successfully offering combined telephone and entertainment services at
lower prices than either service could be provided on its own.
If anything stops the convergence of the two industries, it will be
regulation rather than industrial logic. There are already signs that the
Bell Atlantic/TCI takeover will face tough scrutiny from the authorities.
The reason is concern among politicians and consumer groups that instead of
competing head-on, cable TV and telecommunications operators will join
forces and push up prices for both telephone and TV services.
This argument misses the point that cable TV and telecommunications
companies have in the past not competed at all. Regulations have kept them
out of each others' businesses, so creating local telephone and cable
monopolies. Now these regulations are crumbling. In August, for example,
Bell Atlantic won a legal case allowing it to provide video services over
its main telephone network.
Hasten competition
But barriers still largely remain on cable companies providing telephone
services over their networks. Rather than seeking to use regulations to slow
down convergence, the authorities should press ahead with deregulation as a
means of hastening competition in both industries.
There is one important caveat. Telecommunications operators should continue
to be prevented from linking up with cable companies operating in the areas
where they run telephone services. Such integration would be seriously
anti-competitive, as it would eliminate major potential competitors.
But allowing link-ups with cable companies outside the areas where they
provide telephone services is a different matter - particularly if combined
with a policy of freeing both cable and telecommunications groups to offer a
full range of services over their networks. Such an approach would
eventually mean that customers would have a choice between two integrated
fixed-link operators, instead of facing monopoly suppliers for two separate
services. Further competition will be provided by operators offering
television and telephone services via satellite and radio links.
Restructuring the industry in this way will have considerable benefits for
customers. Far from increasing prices, competition would drive them down.
Meanwhile, the industry would be able to bring the dead hours of the
telephone network to life.
