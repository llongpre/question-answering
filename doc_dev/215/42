   John D. Goeken filed a lawsuit Wednesday
against GTE Corp., one day after he resigned as chief executive of
the Airfone subsidiary he founded.
   Goeken's lawsuit, filed in DuPage County court, contends GTE
breached his employment contract at Airfone, which provides
air-to-ground telephone service to airline passengers.
   Goeken said in a statement he plans to file a competing
application for air-to-ground telephone service with the Federal
Communications Commission once the Airfone case is resolved.
   In the lawsuit, Goeken seeks release from his employment
agreement and his agreement not to compete with GTE. He has an
unpublished number and could not be reached for comment.
   Stamford, Conn.-based GTE would not comment on Goeken's
allegations because of the pending litigation, said spokesman Harvey
Greisman, reached in New York.
   ``But I can tell you we will vigorously contest the lawsuit he
has filed,'' he said.
   When GTE bought Oak Brook-based Airfone in 1986, it contracted
with Goeken to run the company through 1990, his lawsuit says.
   GTE then ``stripped Goeken of his authority'' and ``unjustifiably
removed his right to control the business and affairs of GTE
Airfone,'' the lawsuit alleges.
   ``I am deeply disappointed in GTE's failure to perform as
promised,'' said Goeken, who also helped start the company that
became MCI Communications Corp., now the nation's second-largest
long-distance telephone service.
   Some agency officials have speculated there is not room on the
airwaves for another service, though satellite relay could expand
the available range.
   Goeken said it is technologically and economically possible to
share the limited frequencies available, citing the benefits of
competition.
   Goeken invented the patented technology used by Airfone to
provide telephone service from airliners moving at speeds exceeding
500 mph.
   Airfone began providing telephone service aboard airliners in
1984, when the system was installed in an American Airlines DC-10.
By the beginning of this year, nearly 1,000 aircraft had been
equipped with the phones.
   Since 1987, the company also has offered Railfone, for use in
commuter and interstate train travel.
   Goeken's lawsuit says that since GTE took over, complaints about
Airfone service have increased, equipment repair is slower and the
number of calls per aircraft has dropped.
   Greisman declined to characterize Airfone's performance and said
GTE does not break out earnings figures for its subsidiaries.
   ``We always believed and continue to believe that it is an
important acquisition,'' he said.
   Goeken will be replaced as Airfone chairman and chief executive
by Terry Parker, president of GTE's mobile communications group,
Greisman said, while Sumter Logan was to continue as president and
chief operating officer.
