<LEADPARA>  Moving to protect individual privacy in the face of new telephone technology,
the Federal Communications Commission proposed Thursday that telephone
customers have limited ability to block Caller ID, a service that displays the
phone number of incoming calls before a person answers the telephone.;   But
the move is likely to pit the federal government against some state
regulators, who advocate stricter protections for callers who want to conceal
their identities when using the phone.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  FCC SEEKS LIMITED CALLER ID BLOCKING  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Thursday's action came amid a nationwide debate over Caller ID, which is
already available in many cities and will eventually be available everywhere.;
  Telephone companies are heavily promoting the service as a way for people to
identify unwanted callers, but critics have argued that callers are entitled
to privacy and should be allowed to conceal their identity if they choose.;  
Protection from 900 numbers; In a separate action, the FCC adopted rules
intended to protect consumers from unscrupulous providers of pay-per-call
"900-number" telephone services.;   The new rules would force companies that
provide information over "900" numbers to fully disclose the cost of each call
and give customers a chance to hang up without incurring charges.;   On Caller
ID, the principal concern of a number of politicians and consumer advocates is
that telemarketing companies can learn a person's identity, match it with
other information and then sell it to other businesses without the customer's
knowledge or consent.;   FCC backs limited blocking; In trying to balance the
privacy interests with its desire to promote useful applications of Caller ID,
the FCC proposed that callers be allowed to block the information on
individual calls but rejected the idea that they should be able to have the
identification blocked automatically for every call they make.;   In taking
that stand, the FCC appeared to be moving to pre-empt efforts by some state
regulators to impose heavier protection.;   The New York State Public Service
Commission, for instance, recently rejected plans offering per-call blocking
on local telephone service by New York Telephone and Rochester Telephone. The
commission is insisting on per-line blocking.;   "The FCC wants to get in
there before we act," said Gail Garfield Schwartz, deputy chairman of the New
York State Public Service Commission. "They want to forestall any state,
especially us, from having a higher level of privacy protection.";  
California studying the issue; California's Public Utility Commission is
studying a proposal by Pacific Bell to offer Caller ID in the Bay Area and Los
Angeles; a ruling is expected by the end of the year. Under state law, the
phone company would be required to offer per-call blocking at no charge to
customers. Two bills in the Legislature that would require per-line blocking
are on hold until the PUC makes a decision.;   Commission officials argued
that allowing widespread blocking of Caller ID would make the service less
marketable and could stunt the development of creative new services that most
consumers would welcome.  </TEXT>
