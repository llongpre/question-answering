PACIFIC Bell, the telephone company serving California, yesterday announced
plans to spend Dollars 16bn over seven years to create a multi-media
communications super-highway across its territory. It also awarded American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph a contract estimated at some Dollars 5bn to supply key
parts for the system.
The project is among the largest network modernisations announced by a local
US telecommunications group as both these companies and cable television
operators start to pour capital into the creation of inter-active,
multi-media communications networks.
It is also a coup for AT&amp;T, which will act as systems integrator for the
network and supply much of its hardware. Its contract is said by Pacific
Bell to be the 'single largest network equipment purchase in
telecommunications history'.
Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of the Pacific Telesis telecommunications group,
said the modernisation programme would begin next year and initially
concentrate on the heavily populated centres of San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Orange County and San Diego.
More than 1.5m homes would be hooked up to the super-highway by the end of
1996 and more than 5m homes - or 60 per cent of those it now serves  - would
be connected by the end of the decade.
In addition to advanced telecommunications, Pacific Bell intends to offer
video services, bringing it into direct competition with local cable
television operators.
However, before it can get into the video market it must first overcome a
ban on telecommunications companies entering this area, imposed under the
1984 cable act. Another local telecommunications group, Bell Atlantic, has
already won this right through court action.
The investment is a bold step for Pacific Telesis, which has held back from
the US rush into multi-media services and alliances between programme
providers and communications distributors. It said yesterday it believed it
could obtain programming without taking an equity position in a content
provider.
The company said it could fund the upgrade by cutting Dollars 500m to
Dollars 1bn from its cost structure, with no additional expense to
rate-payers and no additional debt for now.
