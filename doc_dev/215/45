A moderate earthquake gave Orange County a sharp kick Thursday, driving 
students and teachers from their classrooms, shattering windows, tossing 
ceramic artworks from shelves at a crafts festival, and generally spooking 
residents and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The 10:21 a.m. quake, which measured a magnitude of 4.0, caused no injuries and 
only minor damage. The quake's epicenter was in the vicinity of the Orange 
County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa, according to seismologists at Caltech. Costa 
Mesa, Newport Beach and Santa Ana bore the brunt of the temblor's impact, 
though residents from South County to Long Beach reported feeling the jolt. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit like a solid punch," said John Farmer, chief of campus security at 
Orange Coast College, near the quake's epicenter. "The ground started to roll a 
little so you knew it was coming, then it was a big jolt and the building shook 
for a while." 
</P>
<P>
About 150 students and staff were evacuated from the four-story library at the 
college but were allowed to re-enter the building shortly after inspectors 
determined that the structure was not damaged. Two cracks, however, were 
discovered in other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals said they had no reports of injuries, and police and fire officials 
said they received only a few calls from residents inquiring about the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials in Orange County said work crews were dispatched to check 
overpasses for cracks or other damage, but no problems were detected. Pacific 
Bell said telephone service was not interrupted by the quake, but a spokeswoman 
said there was a slight surge in usage, presumably as people rushed to call 
friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The quake occurred on the Newport-Inglewood fault, Orange County's only major 
fault system. The last significant temblor to occur there was on April 7, 1989, 
when a 4.6 quake centered in Newport Beach caused widespread but minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Given, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena, said 
there are many faults within the Newport-Inglewood system. It is difficult to 
determine exactly which fault produces a temblor when it is of such a low 
magnitude, Givens said, calling this quake "a window rattler." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Thursday's quake rattled nerves of those who felt it, and set off 
car alarms in the parking lot of the County Courthouse in Santa Ana and 
elsewhere. Office workers and students in dozens of schools "ducked and 
covered" as the earth began to move. Out-of-town tourists were understandably 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Holst of New York City was attending a computer-software conference at the 
Marriott Hotel in Fashion Island when she felt the earth move. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I thought it was a subway going underneath me, and then I realized I 
wasn't in New York," she said. "I thought, 'Oh, my God, it's an earthquake.' " 
</P>
<P>
Roy Marquez was washing windows at the Jeep-Eagle dealership in Costa Mesa when 
the quake shattered three large windows and cracked a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just starting on the third one when it hit," said Marquez, 26. "I 
thought I had broke it. I thought maybe it was the soap I was using. I just 
ran." 
</P>
<P>
During the rocking and rolling, some storekeepers and shoppers at South Coast 
Plaza kept their eyes on a Rolls-Royce convertible precariously balanced on 
four china teacups -- part of an exhibit for a British cultural festival at the 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
The car did not budge. 
</P>
<P>
But artisans at a British crafts exhibit at the mall weren't so lucky. 
Expensive glassware, delicate ceramic works and pottery were knocked to the 
floor. Damage will probably go over several thousands of dollars, although an 
immediate estimate is not known, said Morris Latham, a spokesman for the crafts 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is housed in a tent structure in the parking lot of the mall's 
Crystal Court annex. "It shook quite badly," Latham said of the tent. "Piles of 
things came down. There were ceramics and glass broken; some were quite 
valuable pieces." 
</P>
<P>
While not all schools in Orange County were evacuated, students at those 
closest to the epicenter initiated emergency procedures, many without prompting 
from teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was very interesting because I had several teachers tell me that when 
the earthquake hit, the kids hit the floor like a shot," said Assistant 
Principal Carla Rush at Marina High School in Huntington Beach. "They knew 
exactly what to do. There was no fooling around." 
</P>
<P>
At the 13-story Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, employees said they felt a 
"bump," but the cathedral's massive glass panes withstood the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
"We just flew out of our chairs," said one employee. "Other than that, we're 
just fine. It's interesting when you are in a tower." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's quake occurred a day after the one-year anniversary of the 7.1 quake 
that caused 67 deaths and massive damage in the Bay Area. The grisly images 
from that disaster -- played repeatedly on television in recent days -- were 
fresh in the minds of some of those running for cover. 
</P>
<P>
"I just looked around and waited to see whether we should get under the table," 
said Huntington Beach resident Inez Cinocco, who was eating in a restaurant. 
"It was frightening, especially because on TV they kept showing the moments of 
silence from last year's (Bay Area) earthquake."
