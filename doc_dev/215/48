CELLULAR PHONE DEALERS SUE FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten Orange County cellular telephone dealers have filed a $6-million lawsuit 
charging Leo's Stereo and Pak-Cell Inc. with predatory pricing and other 
illegal practices in the sale of mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed last week in Orange County Superior Court, alleges that Leo's 
and Pak-Cell are selling the phones at a loss but making the money back by 
requiring buyers to sign up for cellular service. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers get hefty commissions from the cellular service providers for signing 
up new customers, but the "bundling" of phone sales with service orders has 
been ruled illegal by the California Public Utilities Commission.
