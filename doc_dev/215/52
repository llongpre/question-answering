   The Pennsylvania attorney general and consumer advocate offices accused Bell Atlantic Corp.'s telephone subsidiary of using "deceptive techniques" in selling optional telephone services. 

   The state offices said they found that Bell of Pennsylvania sales representatives assigned telephone features -- such as call waiting, speed dialing and wire-maintenance plans -- without explaining prices or informing customers that the services were optional, as required by regulations. 

   If found to be in violation of regulations, Philadelphia-based Bell of Pennsylvania could be ordered to pay $1,000 for each infraction and forced to refund "millions" to customers who got more services than they wanted, according to the attorney general's office. 

   A Bell of Pennsylvania spokesman said there was "no justification for the allegations" and that the telephone company would contest the charges. 
He said sales representatives spend at least "half-an-hour explaining what options are available." 

   However, the attorney general's office said that wasn't the case when its agents inquired about service last fall. 
Of 32 telephone service inquiries placed at various Bell of Pennsylvania centers across the state, there were 23 cases in which sales representatives assigned services without saying they were options, Attorney General LeRoy S. Zimmerman said. 

   In a suit filed in Commonwealth Court yesterday, the attorney general's office, under the state's Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, is asking the telephone utility to refund about $7.7 million to consumers who have subscribed to a wire maintenance plan since January 1987. 
The agency also seeks unspecified penalties. 
Under the wire maintenance plan, Bell of Pennsylvania will repair the customer's inside telephone wire if a problem develops. 

   In a separate but related action, the consumer advocate's office filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission seeking unspecified penalties, to end the alleged illegal marketing practices and refunds for customers who got more services -- excluding wire-maintenance plans -- than they wanted. 

   Since 1984, consumers have spent $176 million on optional telephone services, such as call waiting, call forwarding and speed dialing. 
However, the agency said it isn't clear how much of that total can be attributed to "deceptive sales practices." 

   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic closed at $70.25, down 75 cents. 

   In California, Pacific Telesis Group's Pacific Bell Telephone Co. must refund $35.6 million to customers who were sold optional services they didn't want.
