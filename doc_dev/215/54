BULLY ON THE LINE?;

COMPETITORS ARE ACCUSING PAC BELL OF 'PREDATORY' PRACTICES -- AND STATE 
REGULATORS ARE LISTENING.

<P>
For about two months now, Pacific Bell has offered voice mail, an electronic 
telephone-answering service, to its customers in San Pedro and in the Silicon 
Valley community of Milpitas. But already a competing voice-mail company, Amvox 
Inc., has accused Pacific Bell of "anti-competitive behavior" through its 
monopoly hold on local telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
Amvox pointed out in a complaint filed last month with the California Public 
Utilities Commission that Pacific Bell encourages customers interested in the 
new service to call a toll-free, seven-digit number for information. 
Competitors such as Amvox can match that convenience only by leasing costly 
toll-free service from its competitor, Pacific Bell -- and even then the call 
requires dialing 11 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Pacific Bell is offering a free message-taking service to launch its 
voice mail system -- a practice Amvox called "predatory," or pricing a service 
at below cost to drive out competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I really am not worried about them as an equal competitor," said Harry 
Schwedock, chief operating officer of Amvox, a unit of Amway that claims 41,000 
customers in California. "But I am very worried about them with the playing 
field as tilted as it is." 
</P>
<P>
While Pacific Bell denies Amvox's allegations, many entrepreneurs seeking a 
foothold in emerging competitive areas of the telecommunications business find 
that the complaint has a familiar ring. Critics say that Pacific Bell and other 
regional phone companies have repeatedly abused their monopoly position to 
squeeze potential competitors in unregulated businesses. 
</P>
<P>
And the complaints are growing louder as the PUC considers loosening its 
regulation of Pacific Bell and GTE California, a move that the newcomers say 
would open the door to further competitive abuses as long as they control 
telephone access to customers. Although deregulation proposals have been put 
forward ostensibly to stimulate competition, opponents argue that relaxing 
oversight of Pacific Bell and GTE would free them to bully struggling young 
entrants to the fast-evolving telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they urge adoption of toughened regulations that would require the two 
local giants to keep their monopoly on basic telephone service entirely 
separate from new offerings, such as voice mail and information services, to 
keep the big companies from having an unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who voiced their concerns during a special hearing last week of the 
Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee were: 
</P>
<P>
* Telephone-equipment repairers who groused that Pacific Bell's Yellow Pages 
directories are filled with ads plugging its own repair service, ads that 
competitors would have to pay dearly for. 
</P>
<P>
* Home-security companies, dependent on local phone lines to connect customers 
to the firms' alarm-monitoring networks, which disputed Pacific Bell's claims 
that their phone connections are far below cost and therefore their rates 
should be doubled or more. 
</P>
<P>
* Cable television companies, which cited a long history of "unreasonable" rent 
charged by local phone companies for use of their poles to string TV cable, 
disputes that already have resulted in federal legislation and some state 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Such concerns over the future of competition in the fast-changing world of 
telecommunications are coming to a head after months of PUC hearings examining 
alternative ways to regulate local phone companies. These alternatives seek to 
give Pacific Bell and GTE California greater flexibility in setting prices, to 
shorten the time needed to offer new services and to create stronger incentives 
for innovation by ending limits on profitability. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T Gets Some Freedom 
</P>
<P>
The PUC and the Federal Communications Commission have already given American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the nation's dominant long-distance phone company, 
some freedom in setting its long-distance prices. Similarly, the PUC granted 
Pacific Bell freedom to negotiate rates for certain switching and high-speed 
transmission services with major business customers. 
</P>
<P>
But even AT&amp;T and its chief long-distance competitors -- MCI and U.S Sprint 
-- depend on local phone companies to reach their customers. And they joined 
the smaller and newer telecommunications firms in opposing proposals offered by 
Pacific Bell and GTE California, pointing out that the phone companies' 
monopoly on local connections represents a "bottleneck" through which all 
telecommunications services must flow. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not against competition" from the phone companies, said Jerry O'Brien, 
director of telecommunications for API Alarm Systems in Culver City. "We're 
against unfair competition. A monopoly service should be regulated. But if 
there's competition, if it's not a monopoly, then it should be a separate 
entity." 
</P>
<P>
A separate company would then have to buy and pay for network services on the 
same basis as other companies, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell has proposed scrapping the PUC's present trial-like procedure for 
establishing telephone prices and policies. This procedure establishes service 
costs and adds a maximum profit, then computes the utility's annual revenue 
needs and sets its rates accordingly. The Pacific Bell plan would put these 
"general rate cases" on hold for three years while freezing residential rates 
and giving the company some freedom to increase or lower prices for business 
services. 
</P>
<P>
GTE California's proposal also would suspend rate hearings and impose rate 
caps, although somewhat differently. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC Division of Ratepayer Advocates has developed another alternative -- 
the only one that calls for a general rate cut before any freezing of 
residential prices. "A rate freeze is of no great advantage to rate-payers if 
they are entitled to a reduction," observed division director Terry Murray. A 
rate cut is overdue, she said, because basic telephone costs have been 
declining with improved technology that has been paid for by customers. But 
after "getting the starting point right," she added, the division would 
consider proposals to split with company shareholders and customers what now 
would be designated as "excess earnings" subject to refund. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC's hearing officer exploring these regulatory alternatives, 
Administrative Law Judge Charlotte Ford, said she expects to complete her 
recommendations in midsummer. If so, the commission could decide the issue in 
September. All five PUC commissioners were appointed by Gov. Deukmejian, and 
are considered to be sympathetic toward deregulating telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have a big stake in our state's telecommunications policies," 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) said at the opening of last week's 
hearing by the utilities and commerce committee, which she heads. "They will 
determine, more than we can imagine today, how we will live our lives 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's committee was told repeatedly that competition in telecommunications 
services is essential to bring the full benefits of the so-called information 
age to California. But true competition, those testifying said, hinges on tough 
regulation that prevents anti-competitive practices, such as allowing Pacific 
Bell and GTE to subsidize their new businesses with profits from their phone 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"All the (anti-competitive) problems are resolved by separating" the old 
businesses from the new ones at the big phone companies, asserted Schwedock of 
Amvox. But without strict separation, abuses are inevitable, maintained Dennis 
E. Love, president of Extension Connection in Marin County. 
</P>
<P>
Love formed Extension Connection in 1985 to repair telephone wiring inside 
homes and small businesses when that field was deregulated, but he has seen his 
dream of creating a nationwide franchise of independent repair services fade in 
the face of costly litigation with Pacific Bell. Love's original fleet of nine 
trucks has shrunk to two, and his office now has moved from spacious rented 
quarters to his own home. 
</P>
<P>
Central to his problems, he insists, was the printing of a wrong telephone 
number by Pacific Bell's Yellow Pages subsidiary two years ago in $25,000 worth 
of ads he placed in the utility's Marin County and San Francisco directories. 
After months of negotiations with Pacific Bell's lawyers, Love won a settlement 
for an amount he considers to have been far less than what his publicly traded 
company lost in business and hefty legal expenses. Then this year's directories 
appeared last month with Extension Connection's ad left out, "inadvertently," 
according to Pacific Bell Directory. 
</P>
<P>
Schwedock understands such frustrations among colleagues trying to compete 
against the big regional companies, telling Moore's committee: 
</P>
<P>
"When we have a competitor to whom we pay over 35% of our revenues for services 
essential to our business, when we have a competitor who has no need to raise 
capital, when we have a competitor who has more lawyers than we have employees, 
when we have a competitor who has a long record of anti-competitive abuses, we 
worry."
