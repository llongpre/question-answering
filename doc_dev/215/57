   Pacific Bell said it has stopped billing for dial-a-porn
telephone services, leaving some 50 pornography lines little
choice but to use other billing means such as credit cards or
cease operations.
   The services offer live or recorded messages of a sexual
nature.

   Pacific Bell, a unit of Pacific Telesis Group, San
Francisco, said it would stop billing for dial-a-porn
services after a federal district court in San Francisco
lifted its two-year injunction prohibiting Pacific Bell from
denying billing based on message content. The court action
came in late August and PacBell stopped billing yesterday.
   Most phone service lines offered by third party providers
rely on the sophisticated call-tracking and billing equipment
run by the phone companies to collect from customers who call
their lines. That's because it would be prohibitively
expensive to maintain their own costly facilities.
   "There were 67 companies providing about 198 {dial-a-porn}
programs" in August, a PacBell spokesman said. "That has been
cut to 50 programs today. The company's action follows
similar moves by several other phone companies, including
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
