A nonprofit organization in Anaheim has begun a publicity campaign to make 
handicapped people in Orange County aware of special telephone services that 
may be available to them free. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of good services for disabled people available in the state," 
said Brenda Premo, executive director of the Dayle McIntosh Center for the 
Disabled. "Unfortunately, the people who design these services don't think 
about the importance of marketing these services to the people who need them 
the most." 
</P>
<P>
Premo said Pacific Bell, General Telephone and other companies in the state are 
legally required to offer telephone services to the handicapped but that 
efforts to publicize the services have been poor. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a $45,000 grant, the Dayle McIntosh Center has taken the 
matter into its own hands by starting a publicity campaign called "Dialog," 
which sends telephone company representatives to the community to give 
presentations on equipment and services. The center has also designed 
information posters for speech and hearing centers and rehabilitation hospitals 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Our grant money is helping us to reach out to people with disabilities, their 
families and the people they work with to let them know the kinds of services 
that are available to them," Premo said. 
</P>
<P>
Such services include a speaker phone, which allows a caller to talk into a 
microphone and hear the person on the other end without having to hold a 
receiver. For the visually impaired, large number overlays can be installed. 
Amplifiers are available for the hearing impaired, and for those who are deaf, 
a typewriter device connected to the telephone allows callers to type their 
messages to an operator, who relays it and types back a reply. Those who are 
both deaf and blind may be able to receive a Braille version of this device. 
</P>
<P>
"We have everything from an amplifier for Grandma to a special telephone that a 
person with only head movement can activate by puffing on a switch," said Joy 
Tyo, manager of disabled services at Pacific Bell. "I think this is an exciting 
time. Equipment is now very small and compact because of rapid advances in 
computer technology. I think it's only going to get easier and easier for the 
disabled population to use the telephone and experience that independence that 
we all depend on." 
</P>
<P>
To apply for disabled telephone services, call Pacific Bell, Deaf and Disabled 
Services, 1-800-772-3140 or the General Telephone Special Needs Center, 
1-800-821-2585. 
</P>
<P>
The next Dialog presentation is scheduled for 12:15 p.m. Tuesday at the Anaheim 
Convention Center. Call (714) 772-8285 for details. GREG HERNANDEZ
