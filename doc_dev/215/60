<LEADPARA>  The 7.5 earthquake hit early Thursday morning. Most of the Bay Area didn't
feel a thing, but the temblor shook the Santa Clara County Emergency
Operations Center to its very foundation.;   For 2 1/2 hours, 75 members of
the county's emergency response team crammed into two tiny rooms in the center
atop "communications hill" in South San Jose, where they underwent a dress
rehearsal for the real thing.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Loma Prieta lessons refined; Only three months before the Loma Prieta
quake, many had been here for a similar drill. Thursday was a chance to refine
lessons that quake had taught.;   This shaker, modeled on what the U.S.
Geological Survey expects might happen if the Earth buckles along one section
of the San Andreas Fault, measured roughly five times the magnitude and 15
times the intensity of Loma Prieta. Its epicenter was just south of San
Francisco.;   In 42 seconds, the phantom quake left the response team with a
final exam of terrible proportions: Hospitals had collapsed, buildings
toppled, bridges crumbled, stretches of highways rippled like accordion
bellows.;   In Santa Clara County alone, 163 people were dead and more than
1,300 injured. Morgan Hill, Gilroy, Palo Alto and Santa Clara were hardest
hit, accounting for 107 deaths. Eight-hundred homes were destroyed and more
than 6,500 damaged. The dollar loss: $2.5 billion.;   Worked by specialties;
Grouped around long tables with red telephones according to their specialties,
emergency team members dispatched rescue and fire units to collapsed and
burning buildings, mobilized teams to deal with hazardous chemical spills,
combed area agencies for blankets to deliver to shelters, coordinated the
response of utility repair workers to gas leaks and electrical outages, sent
teams of structural engineers to probe the safety of buildings, dispatched
technicians to check the potability of the county's drinking water, and
quashed rumors of a typhoid fever outbreak.;   With all hospitals full and
forced to assess new patients out of doors, officials used the dirigible
hangar at Moffett Field as a huge field hospital. When people started asking
what they should do with the corpses, logistics chief Paul Sagers advised,
"Tell them to just cover them and leave them alone. We'll handle them when
we're able to.";   For the most part, participants were satisfied with their
response to the emergency, in which "simulators" in an adjoining room tested
the team with messages for help of every imaginable kind.;   Prompt requests
for help;   In fact, emergency personnel from the county's 15 cities assessed
the situation and asked for help so quickly that, had this been a real
disaster, the county might have gotten half of the 22 heavy-equipment rescue
teams around the nation.;   "They're a scarce resource," said Neal O'Haire, a
participant from the state Office of Emergency Services. "Whoever asks first
is going to get them because they're really only effective in the first 48
hours." After that, people are seldom pulled from the rubble alive, he said.; 
 There were problems still to be solved. Even before Loma Prieta, officials
said the size of the room in the county communications building was
inadequate. They're still looking for a facility closer to the civic center,
said Earl Thompson, manager of county emergency services.;   During the Loma
Prieta quake, he said, ham radio operators were invaluable in relaying
messages until telephone service was restored. Thursday's exercise assumed
that the center's phones would be out of commission for 5 1/2 hours after the
quake. But ham operators are still working on hardware that will permit them
to transmit paper copies of radio messages, so incorrect or distorted
information doesn't get passed on.;   A first for county; Barbara Tryon, vice
mayor of Los Altos Hills, an observer of the drill and a member of the
county's Early Preparedness Council, said Santa Clara County was the first to
provide a communications link between the Emergency Operations Center and all
of its cities, and is singled out throughout the state for its preparedness.; 
 In addition to representatives from most county departments and ham radio
operators, there were participants from Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., the Red
Cross, Pacific Bell, Santa Clara Valley Water District and the California
Highway Patrol.  </TEXT>
