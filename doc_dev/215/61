The US administration yesterday offered telecommunications and information
companies a new and simpler regulatory structure in exchange for their help
in building an 'information superhighway' to which every hospital, library
and classroom would have access.
Vice-president Al Gore, in a speech trumpeted by the White House for weeks,
threw the administration's weight behind open competition in the emerging
field of multimedia information services between telephone and cable
television companies.
He promised to introduce legislation to encourage private sector investment
in a new 'information infrastructure' while ensuring 'universal access' for
all Americans to the new services that are expected to develop.
'This administration will not let existing regulatory structures impede or
distort the evolution of the communications industry,' Mr Gore told
communications and entertainment company executives in Los Angeles.
Mr Gore endorsed the principles of legislation already proposed in Congress
that would ease the restrictions imposed by the 1982 court judgment which
broke up the AT&amp;T telephone monopoly into 'Baby Bell' companies providing
local telephone services and a separate AT&amp;T offering long-distance
services.
Separate bills would allow the seven Bell companies, which since the
court-imposed break-up of the AT&amp;T monopoly have operated under tight
restrictions, to start manufacturing telecommunications equipment and
provide long-distance telephone services. Some of the restrictions on
cross-ownership between the telephone and cable television industry sectors
would be repealed.
To achieve 'regulatory symmetry', the administration will propose
regulations that give communications companies greater freedom if they are
willing to guarantee 'non-discriminatory access' to their networks for all
service providers. This so-called 'Title 7' provision would allow companies
offering telephone, television and other services to operate under a unified
code, avoiding conflicts between current regulations which contain separate
rules for cable providers and telephone service providers. No companies
would currently qualify for Title 7's terms, White House officials said.
The plan would transfer regulatory power from the courts to the Federal
Communications Commission and Justice Department.
'Our legislative package will contain provisions designed to ensure that
each telephone carrier's networks will be readily accessible to other
users,' Mr Gore said.
