<HEAD>Dow Jones Plans to Offer Financial News by Phone</HEAD>

   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Tuesday it is
introducing an interactive 900-number telephone service that will
enable callers to get stock quotes, business and financial news,
sports reports and weather conditions.
   Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, plans to charge
85 cents for the first minute and 75 cents for each additional
minute for calls to its service, called JournalPhone.
   The service begins operation Wednesday and will be promoted each
weekday with advertising in the Journal.
   Its creators called the service ``a logical extension'' of the
newspaper.
   ``It picks up where the Journal leaves off and offers an easy,
convenient way to keep on top of the news as it develops throughout
the day,'' said Kenneth L. Burenga, a senior vice president of Dow
Jones.
   Callers who want to find out at mid-morning what the latest
government indicators showed, for example, can hear a recorded
report by dialing 1-900-JOURNAL and pushing the appropriate
telephone buttons as prompted by the service.
   When callers have heard enough, they can push a few more buttons
and obtain 15-minute delayed quotes on any of 6,500 stock prices;
regularly updated reports on the overall stock, bond or currency
markets; information about weather in selected cities; or reports
on sports stories or scores.
   The calls will be charged on regular monthly phone bills.
   Dow Jones is not the first newspaper publisher to provide
telephone services, although its service may offer the widest array
of reports.
   A number of newspapers, for instance, provide sports scores by
telephone for the cost of a local telephone call.
   Gannett Co. Inc.'s USA Today provides four call-in services on
900-numbers, including hotlines for sports information and scores,
weather reports, lottery results and horse racing results.
   Phil Fuhrer, vice president of Gannett New Media, said the
sports hotline receives 2.7 million calls a year at 60 cents for
the first minute and 45 cents for each minute after that. ``It
extends our coverage to 24 hours a day,'' he said.
   Dow Jones executives said they were not sure how many calls to
expect on their new service. It tested the service for three months
this past summer in Atlanta, where about 10,000 Journal readers
were invited to use the system for free. The test showed the
average calls lasted about two minutes.
   The company already provides a more expensive interactive
telephone service for active traders and plans to use the same
staff and facilities for its new service which is geared more
toward average investors.
   Dow Jones expects the new service to be profitable from the
start.
