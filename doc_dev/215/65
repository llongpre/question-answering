</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beware the telephone. TV ads may tease and promise adventure at the fingertips. 
But it is call now, pay later, when the monthly bill shows where late night 
loneliness and the pursuit of romance dug into the wallet. 
</P>
<P>
That once-friendly instrument, masquerading in the colors of the rainbow and 
shapes that range from computer clever to Space Age gothic, is at your service 
with services you never dreamed you would want. 
</P>
<P>
Everything from pay-as-you-talk to Santa to pay-as-you-dream about sex. 
</P>
<P>
A firm in Seattle brought down the wrath of parents with a half-hour Christmas 
show featuring Santa Claus. Children were told to hold their telephones toward 
the screen, whereupon tone-activated signals dialed up that jolly old elf so 
the kids could chat with him, while the computer logged and charged for the 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
Things have changed in the telephone world, not so much because the changes are 
needed, but because they are possible. And profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Today's telephone junkie can have intimate chats with all kinds of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Now a whole new series of 1-900 numbers are opening up. On some you are a quiz 
show guest, answering with your push-button phone to maybe win a prize. But you 
pay for the call, perhaps $2 for openers and more if you stay on the line. 
</P>
<P>
A simple call on one adult sex line in New York City can run $20 or more, 
whether you talk or not. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone has spawned a new business that some say is eclipsing $400 
million a year and growing. An evening of letting your fingers do the walking 
can ring up a $200 phone bill in a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
The same comforting device that gave you grandma's warm and comforting voice 
now gives you everything from strange sex to sexy strangers, from gays in 
search of companionship to high school kids on a high. 
</P>
<P>
It offers up the stock market, the latest interest rates, advice on mortgages. 
Its recorded voices tell you what meetings there are in your community, where 
to shop for an auto loan, when to get up, how to pray, what your biorhythms 
are, when your stars are favorable, when they are not, how to get a date 
whatever your sexual or racial choice, who is going to win the Super Bowl and 
what the point spread is, where to get free money for college. 
</P>
<P>
Dial and get the latest jokes, the top horse racing picks, lottery results, a 
daily diet, skiing bargains, sports scores, government job openings, insults, 
wine choices, movie reviews, soap opera reviews, music trivia, sports trivia, 
trivial trivia. 
</P>
<P>
That's not all. 
</P>
<P>
On the gab lines you can chat with strangers, search for a date, leave your 
number for promised human adventure, dispel in seven push-button digits that 
most universal of all human conditions, loneliness. And if one is too shy, dial 
the adult lines (in New York there are more than 200 of them) and become an 
aural voyeur to kinky sex, erotic fantasy. From their lips to your ear, and 
only the telephone billing computer will know. 
</P>
<P>
It is 5:30 a.m. in New York City and CBS has sandwiched in between its 
late-night rerun and morning business shows a commercial or two showing a 
black-dressed villain and a pretty blonde a la Perils of Pauline urging viewers 
to call a certain 970 number and rescue this damsel from certain boredom. 
</P>
<P>
When the number is reached (after several tries), a woman's voice says the call 
will cost $5 unless you hang up now. Then you are assigned your personal code 
number and given another telephone number to call. After several tries again, 
you enter your code, then push another number as instructed and finally reach a 
young, breathless voice named Linda. She is apparently ready to field your 
favorite fantasy, although she volunteers nothing. 
</P>
<P>
You find that she is a 22-year-old college graduate (political science) from a 
New York state university, is thinking about joining the Peace Corps, and is 
saving money to go to Europe to visit a friend. 
</P>
<P>
You hesitate to ask, "What's a nice girl like you doing in this racket," and 
inquire instead, "Are you well-paid for this?" 
</P>
<P>
She answers no. Then someone steps in and terminates the call. Either time was 
up or the questions were going too far. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later the television invitation to call carries a sotto voce 
addendum: "$10 a call." 
</P>
<P>
This particular operation is offered by one of a group of companies, known 
usually as Omni Phone Inc. of Seattle, although in Texas the name is HDL Inc. 
The marketing and promotion is handled by a firm called the Megaquest Group, 
based in Seattle. The companies employ about 500 people and operate in about 30 
cities domestically, plus all of Canada and in London, Rotterdam, Paris and 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
One of the satellite companies, Phonequest, was the one that engineered the 
Santa calling show. It was syndicated to 30 domestic and four foreign markets. 
When the Seattle station began getting irate calls, it quickly ran a warning to 
children with the printed words telling them to ask Mom and Dad first. Why did 
Phonequest, which has used the program for four years, rely on the electronic 
dialing technique? A spokesman said it was to prevent children from dialing the 
wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
When one of the firm's 970 numbers in New York City was dialed and reached 
after several abortive tries, a pretentiously sexy female voice answered and 
offered to be companionable. When the phone bill came in, it registered four 
calls and two additional minutes. The charge was $79.80, even though three of 
the calls never produced an answer. When the number was called back, post 
billing, this was the conversation: 
</P>
<P>
Hi, welcome to party line. 
</P>
<P>
How much does this call cost? 
</P>
<P>
You didn't hear the recording? 
</P>
<P>
There was no recording. 
</P>
<P>
$19.95. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby. 
</P>
<P>
That number also was advertised on television, with an attractive young woman 
adding under her breathless message, "$19.95 a call." It so happened that 
particular number was another Omni Phone enterprise. Betsy Superfon, known 
erroneously in the trade as "Betsy Superphone," is chief executive officer of 
the Seattle-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
She says the company offers everything from soap opera updates to joke lines, 
from dial-an-insult to group access lines. She outlined plans to go into other 
areas with information storage and retrieval via voice, a kind of telephone 
postal service, as well as interconnections between computers, and varying 
menus available on a single line to get specific data, for instance in sports, 
that the caller desires. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a proposal to acquire her firm from herself and partners Joel and 
Rebecca Eisenberg. They claim a 1987 net income of not less than $4 million. 
The would-be acquirer is a Texas firm called WurlTech Industries of Houston, 
which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange as a billiard table 
manufacturer. It was recently quoted at about a dollar a share. 
</P>
<P>
Of the unanswered but charged-for calls, Superfon said she would refund any 
justifiable costs on receipt of a complaining letter. She said there is a 
quality-control program to prevent such errors. 
</P>
<P>
Would she continue the current gab line and adult services in light of her 
future plans? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely. People are lonely, have been lonely and always will be lonely." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, for many people the phone lines provide a real service for 
companionship, even though many of the people who link up by voice rarely see 
each other. "Telephones are really safe," she says. 
</P>
<P>
There is already the beginning of a second generation of telephone-line dating. 
From New York City comes word of a "Fax," or facsimile-transmitter club, which 
for a few hundred dollars will let you fax your message to someone else's fax, 
and never hear their voice if you don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
Industry-wide, most dial-it entrepreneurs would talk only on a 
not-for-attribution basis. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Elwell, editor of the Information Industry Bulletin, one of the few 
authoritative sources in the dial-it industry, says using the telephone for 
information is nothing new. New York telephone operators have been giving the 
time of day since the late 1920s, with the weather and traffic information 
following. The old operator and the party line were avenues for news and 
gossip. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising is a major expense for today's purveyors. Small operations rely on 
word-of-mouth and matchbook covers to pass on tantalizing phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger operators use television. Evening television movies are interrupted with 
all kinds of invitations, sometimes attractive young women, purring, "There's a 
party on your line whenever you want. Call as often as you want." 
</P>
<P>
Businesses that deal in sex have never been known for truth in advertising, but 
the expansion and invasion of the information telephone services, sanctioned by 
state and local authorities, is becoming troublesome to many. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the state legislature and the Public Service Commission made it 
mandatory for the telephone company to block lines to such calls at the 
customer's request. Pacific Bell has a suit pending against a dozen dial-a-porn 
operators to force them to cease and desist on the basis that they are damaging 
Pacific Bell's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
New York Telephone says it makes an effort to survey the talk lines and 
operators are required to provide monitors who can cut off disruptive or 
obscene callers. While this works on some lines, it doesn't seem to work on 
others. 
</P>
<P>
New York Telephone will now block dial-it calls from residences for free. Until 
this January, there was a $5 charge. Businesses must pay $10 and up, depending 
on the number of lines. 
</P>
<P>
The company will also cancel the charges the first time, if the customer 
complains that a child or teen-ager made the calls without parental permission. 
After that, the customer is urged to have the line blocked, or keep their 
youngsters off the phone. 
</P>
<P>
The phone company loses nothing. It gets half the charge whether the dial-it 
service collects or not. One West Coast company says uncollected calls cost it 
$400,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Bell shut down dial-a-porn services in Miami and Atlanta in 1984 and 
so far has been upheld by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The option of blocking calls apparently did not reach Vilma Lantiqua, a 
49-year-old mother of a 17-year-old high school dropout in New York City. Her 
son, Sergio, had run up a $1,400 phone bill calling various party lines. In 
desperation she put the phone in her daughter's padlocked bedroom. So one night 
in January, Sergio broke into his mother's bedroom, stuffed a sock in her mouth 
and strangled her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case this spring in which a 
California dial-a-porn operator, Sable Communications in the Los Angeles area, 
is challenging bans on dial-a-porn as abridgements of freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
The law under contest is a 1988 federal statute that bans sexually explicit 
telephone message services. The law prohibits any obscene or indecent 
communications for commercial purposes over interstate lines. It provides for 
fines up to $500,000 and prison terms up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever course the Supreme Court decides, there are a number of area phone 
companies which, fearing adverse reaction will affect the telephone information 
business in general, are planning to curtail or segregate the pornographic and 
gab lines. 
</P>
<P>
The revenues are important. One New York state official said the information 
services help subsidize the general telephone services. 
</P>
<P>
Those services that cater to homosexuals are more serious than other gab lines. 
They permit callers to talk with a group or "barhop" by pressing a designated 
key on push-button phones. One operator of such lines says they perform a real 
service, all the more critical in the gay community since the AIDs epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"Talking to someone before jumping into bed with him is a good thing to do," he 
says. "Gays take this more seriously than do the straights, who tend to goof 
off and hambone on the gab lines." 
</P>
<P>
Most often dial-it profits are illusory, a gamble at best. Quality equipment is 
expensive, some devices running $2,000 a line or more. They force a telephone 
line, capable of carrying two voices, to carry six to eight. 
</P>
<P>
Most operations start with bright ideas, some never come to fruition, some fail 
for lack of continuing innovation. It is a copycat business. Some reserved 
lines are still vacant. There are thousands more available. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, one said, is that the field is littered with dead bodies, lost 
fortunes. Yet there are 200 million telephones out there, each a potential 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Like many new ideas these days, this one started in the Western states. 
Ominously, that is where some of the harshest controls are showing up. 
</P>
<P>
But gab lines are not likely to go away. As one frequent caller says, "It's 
cheaper than going out." 
</P>
<P>
Or was.
