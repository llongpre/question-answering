SERVICE WOULD KEEP ID OF A CALLER CONFIDENTIAL

A Beverly Hills lawyer has begun selling a service aimed at circumventing 
controversial "caller identification" systems that reveal callers' phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Such systems are not yet available in California, but Pacific Bell officials 
say they will propose offering a feature that will conceal phone numbers for 
free. Meanwhile, some law enforcement officials see the new private service as 
possibly impeding criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Caller identification allows recipients of phone calls to view the telephone 
number from which incoming calls originate. About 100,000 telephone users on 
the East Coast have signed up for such a service offered by Bell Atlantic, a 
regional phone firm. The owners of 800 and 900 lines also have the option to 
buy such services. 
</P>
<P>
The service can cut down on harassing phone calls and allows users to screen 
out unwanted callers, phone company officials say. Taxi cab companies and 
delivery firms can use the service to verify phone numbers, cutting down on 
false orders. 
</P>
<P>
The systems, however, have been criticized by many for violating the privacy of 
callers who don't want their numbers revealed or who have paid extra to get 
unlisted phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Enter attorney William F. Dwyer II, co-founder of Private Lines, along with 
Marvin Rudnick, a former Justice Department attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Callers who want to remain anonymous dial Private Lines' 900 service: 
1-900-STOPPER for domestic calls or 1-900-RUNWELL for international calls. The 
caller, who pays $2 a minute for domestic calls and $5 for international calls, 
punches in the phone number he wants to reach and is connected via the service. 
</P>
<P>
A caller identification system would display only the Private Lines number, 
said Dwyer, who said his company will will not match incoming and outgoing 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone bill of Private Line customers would only show calls made to the 
900 line and not the number of the person or company that was eventually 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the genius of it," said Dwyer, who noted the service will help 
businessmen shield their telephone calls from corporate spies or attorneys. "I 
think it will make it a tougher job for a litigator to get into the privacy of 
people by subpoenaing their phone records." 
</P>
<P>
But that same feature could also frustrate law enforcement officials who often 
rely on phone records to show relationships between suspects, says Allen Field, 
who heads the major fraud division of the Los Angeles County District 
Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that we have to see what problems it would create," said Field. 
"I can't think of a legitimate reason for this service." 
</P>
<P>
Blocking caller identification does not sit well with the phone companies that 
sell the service. 
</P>
<P>
"We have taken a stand against blocking," said Sandra Granzow, spokeswoman for 
Bell Atlantic. "We believe that all numbers should be passed to the people who 
are receiving the call." 
</P>
<P>
Legislation in California will require phone companies to allow callers to 
shield their numbers from identification systems. Pacific Bell said it will be 
a few years before it can offer call identification and a free sister service 
-- Per Call Privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Per Call Privacy will enable the customers to prevent their phone number from 
being displayed," said Pacific Bell spokeswoman Lissa Zanville. "By pressing a 
combination of three digits, they can decide per call if they can have their 
number displayed."
