VIETNAMESE BILLED FOR UNNEEDED PHONE SERVICES GET HELP

Baffled that their telephone bills seemed astronomical in past months, many 
Vietnamese students enrolled in a job-training program for Southeast Asians in 
San Diego have been showing their bills to their English-speaking instructors 
in hopes of getting an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they shouldn't have such huge phone bills," said Beverley Yip, 
director of the Union of Pan Asian Communities, a San Diego-based support group 
that provides job training. "The students were being billed for things like 
call waiting and call forwarding -- a whole package that they didn't need or 
want. Some had special rates for calling Imperial County, even though they 
didn't know anyone there." 
</P>
<P>
Since Feb. 14, however, eight Pacific Bell service representatives who speak 
English and Vietnamese have been helping Vietnamese customers decipher their 
phone bills and, in some cases, obtain refunds for those who paid for services 
they didn't need and didn't realize they had ordered. Pacific Bell's Vietnamese 
Service Center opened in Tustin in December and began serving San Diego County 
on Feb. 14. Officials plan to begin serving Los Angeles County later this 
spring.

Charged for Unneeded Services 
</P>
<P>
Many of San Diego County's 25,000 to 30,000 Vietnamese residents have been 
charged for the unnecessary services because of poor communication with 
English-speaking service representatives, said Yip, who sits on a Pacific Bell 
special advisory committee for the Asian market. Yip said about half of all 
Vietnamese in the county can speak English fluently. 
</P>
<P>
Many Vietnamese customers who speak English still prefer to speak Vietnamese 
"when it comes to ordering something as complicated and technological as 
telephone service," a Pacific Bell spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The representatives take orders for new service, add or change existing 
features, answer bill-related questions and help customers choose which phone 
package best meets their needs. Vietnamese customers' calls are transferred to 
the Vietnamese Service Center when they call Pacific Bell's general business 
number and indicate they speak Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
The weekday service, which Pacific Bell officials say might begin statewide 
later this year, is part of the Pacific Bell Asian Market Plan, which was 
adopted in 1987 after the company analyzed the demographics, language needs and 
life styles of Asians in California. The company also provides services for 
Spanish, Korean and Chinese-speaking customers. 
</P>
<P>
"This service makes good business sense to Pacific Bell," Yip said.
