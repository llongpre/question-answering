   The state Public Utilities Commission on
Thursday scrapped its 50-year-old system of regulating telephone
rates and adopted a new plan tying rates to inflation, encouraging
new technology and promising Pacific Bell customers a rate decrease.
   ``Local telephone companies are becoming more like competitive
businesses and should be treated that way,'' the commission's
president, G. Mitchell Wilk, said before the new system was
approved on a 5-0 vote.
   Pacific Bell and GTE California, the other company affected,
both praised the plan. A consumer group, Toward Utility Rate
Normalization, called it ``a dangerous ride down an unmapped road.''
   The plan, effective next year, is part of an overall policy by
the current PUC, appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian, to loosen
some of its traditional regulation and scrutiny of management
decisions by utility companies in telecommunications, energy and
transportation.
   Current phone rates are based on the commission's determination
of major phone companies' revenue needs, based on its costs,
efficiency and the state of the economy.
   Under the new system, rates will be changed annually according
to this formula: a federal inflation index called the Gross
National Product Price Index will be reduced by 4.5 percent, based
on the assumption that phone companies can increase their
productivity by that amount each year.
   For example, if inflation was 4.8 percent, the figure shown by
the index this past March, the rate increase would be .3 percent.
   The companies' basic rate of return on investment would be set
at 11.5 percent as of Jan. 1. Carl Danner, an aide to Wilk, said
the result would probably be a rate decrease of $100 million or
more for Pacific Bell next year and probably little change for GTE,
which had a 20 percent rate cut last year.
   If a company increased its efficiency to earn a higher rate of
return, stockholders could keep all amounts up to 13 percent.
Additional earnings up to 16.5 percent would be split 50-50 with
ratepayers, and any amounts above 16.5 percent would belong to
ratepayers.
   Sometime next year, the current $1.20-a-month charge for
touch-tone telephone service would be eliminated, and the free
local calling area would be expanded from eight to 12 miles.
   The PUC said Pacific Bell would be allowed to spend $405 million
to modernize its system over the next three years so that 950,000
customers would have access to services they now lack, including
touch-tone phones and blocking of ``dial-a-porn'' and other
tape-message fee calls.
   The commission will also let phone companies cut prices for some
high-tech and business-oriented services, and require the companies
to assume all financial risks of many new services while keeping
all revenues from those services.
