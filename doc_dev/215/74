GREENLINING: AN EQUAL-OPPORTUNITY, GRASS-ROOTS ANTIDOTE TO REDLINING; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: WITH A LITTLE PRODDING, CORPORATE AMERICA IS FINALLY REALIZING THAT 
IGNORING INNER-CITY COMMUNITIES IS COSTLY TO THE BOTTOM LINE.

Redlining is no stranger to minority communities. It's the equivalent of 
whites-only baseball played by America's corporations and businesses. 
"Greenlining" aims to do to these communities what Jackie Robinson did to 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Like the "Green Power" movement, which appeals to corporate self-interest to 
protect the environment, the Greenlining Coalition aims to promote the economic 
well-being of minorities and the poor by encouraging corporate America to 
abandon redlining and form partnerships with them. Why should corporations, 
after years of cold-shoulder treatment, embrace inner-city and low-income 
communities? Profits and market share. 
</P>
<P>
Started in 1979, the Greenlining Coalition comprises 16 multiethnic 
organizations, among them the California Council of Urban Leagues, the League 
of United Latin American Citizens, the Filipino-American Political Assn. and 
Consumer Action. Its first partnership, also in 1979, was with Glendale Federal 
Savings and Loan. The coalition agreed not to file an action with the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board to block Glendale's merger with another S&amp;L. In 
return, Glendale pledged to develop inner-city lending programs, name minority 
and female representatives to its board of directors and revise its 
philanthropic policies. 
</P>
<P>
Its most recent partnership was announced last month when Security Pacific Bank 
said it was committing $2.4 billion in the 1990s to economic development in 
inner-city and low-income neighborhoods. The bank also plans to retarget its 
philanthropic contributions to reflect the needs of its customer base, almost 
half minority. The program is the result of numerous meetings of the coalition 
and its counsel, Public Advocates, with Security Pacific's chief executive 
officer, Robert Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Other banks also recognize the immense profits to be made by lending in the 
inner cities. The Bank of Tokyo, which owns 77% of Union Bank, reached a 
comprehensive equal-opportunity agreement with the coalition in 1988 to head 
off a potential legal challenge to its plan to merge with a California bank. 
The pact calls for the bank to invest at least $42 million a year in the inner 
city, to name a total of five minority and female representatives to its board 
of directors, to set up a comprehensive multilingual outreach program and to 
offer free checking accounts to the poor. As part of the bank's lending 
program, the Baltic Inn in San Diego was restored and the Mercy Family Plaza in 
San Francisco built to create housing for low-income and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Commendable as Bank of Toyko's action is, Southern California Edison recently 
went further. Last September, after a series of Supreme Court decisions that 
made it more difficult for plaintiffs to prove discrimination and weaken the 
quota system, Howard Allen, Edison chairman, asked the coalition to join him in 
announcing corporate changes that would strive to end economic exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The power company promised to add two female and minority representatives to 
its board of directors, ensure that 30% of its top management be minority and 
female, award roughly 30% of its $1 billion year in contracts to minorities and 
women and increase by tenfold its direct philanthropic contributions to the 
poor and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Allen has been outspoken on the matter of equal opportunity, asserting that it 
is not only morally right, but makes good business sense and can be achieved on 
merit alone. 
</P>
<P>
Other major corporations have also pursued the profit potential of serving all 
segments of California's diverse population. In 1986 and 1987, AT&amp;T, GTE 
and Pacific Bell entered into agreements with members of the coalition to 
provide multilingual telephone services. One expert estimated that the 
introduction of full Spanish-language telephone services could increase Pacific 
Bell's revenue by at least $5 billion this decade. AT&amp;T, impressed by the 
profitability of Spanish-language telephone services, has announced that it 
will voluntarily launch a 140-language phone service throughout the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The Greenlining Coalition has been less successful in dealing with 
foreign-owned banks and the insurance industry in California. Unwillingness to 
lend to minorities in California has prompted legal protests by the coalition, 
Consumers Union and Communities for Accountable Reinvestment. As a result, the 
Federal Reserve Bank is scrutinizing the lending practices of Mitsui Bank Ltd. 
of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Far more notorious are the exclusionary business practices of the insurance 
industry. Two of the state's largest insurance companies virtually refuse to 
sell auto insurance in minority areas of Los Angeles. This has spawned 
administrative legal suits by Consumers Union, Voter Revolt and the Greenlining 
Coalition. Partly as a result, Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie will 
hold hearings next month on redlining. 
</P>
<P>
But the practices of the insurance industry are increasingly out of step with 
more and more economists, educators and CEOs who believe that California's 
long-term economic viability depends on its business community developing 
partnership with its minorities -- which will collectively be the majority by 
the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
These minority-corporate ties are best developed voluntarily. But as the 
civil-rights struggle has demonstrated, government incentives -- and penalties 
-- are sometimes a helpful prod. Two of California's five largest banks -- 
Wells Fargo and Security Pacific -- currently have no minority representatives 
on their boards of directors. The chairman of Security Pacific, however, has 
pledged to have two minority board members by the end of the year. A typical 
major bank or savings-and-loan has less than 1% of its loans in the 
African-American community, less than 2% in the Latino. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the coalition is asking Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) and 
Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) to sponsor legislation that would block any 
takeover or merger unless the acquiring corporation can demonstrate its 
commitment to equal opportunity. If passed, the legislation could break 
corporate resistance to multicultural opportunity. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 
dream of economic parity for minorities and corporate America's dream of 
increasing market share and profitability could both come true.
