   The California Public Utilities Commission ruled that California's two major telephone companies can continue leasing lines to operators of special calling services known as 976 numbers. 

   When dialed, the so-called information access numbers provide callers with recorded messages including sports information, stock market updates, or sexually explicit messages. 
Users are billed on their regular monthly phone statements. 

   Huge bills run up by children calling "Dial-a-Santa," and concerns about youngsters' access to sexually explicit messages, caused some people to seek closure of the service. 
The state legislature recently enacted legislation requiring telephone companies to establish a method that would allow phone customers to delete access to the 976 numbers if they want to. 

   The state panel confirmed an earlier ruling that determined the services to be in the public interest. 
In addition, it ordered Pacific Telesis Group Inc.'s Pacific Bell unit and GTE Corp.'s General Telephone Co. of California unit to continue efforts to find an inexpensive way to block access to 976 programs from their telephone lines. 
The panel said such a system must be in place by January 1988.
