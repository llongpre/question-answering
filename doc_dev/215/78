Major developers and others connected to the building industry in Orange County 
have contributed the lion's share of a $1.8-million war chest amassed by 
backers of Measure M, a proposed half-cent sales tax increase for 
transportation improvements, according to financial statements filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But the hearty outpouring of developer dollars is also sure to provide fodder 
for the measure's opponents, who argue that builders want more roads laid down 
as groundwork for a continued housing boom in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure have collected only about $8,000 and have portrayed 
the contest as a David-versus-Goliath match-up. But supporters of Measure M 
insist that their decided money-raising edge -- and the fact those funds have 
come largely from the development and construction community -- will not prove 
a detriment when voters go to the polls Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to make an individual choice based on the merits of Measure 
M," said Alan Hoffenblum, a Los Angeles-based political consultant hired to 
manage the pro-M campaign. "This is just money to help us communicate. . . . I 
think the lack of funding on the 'no' side shows a lack of support for their 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Citizens for Yes on M have raised $1.73 million in cash and nearly another 
$62,000 in non-monetary contributions through Oct. 21, while spending nearly 
$1.3 million, according to the campaign disclosure statement. Nearly $960,000 
of the cash and "in-kind" contributions were made during the last month alone. 
</P>
<P>
Contributions in excess of $20,000 came from more than two dozen major Orange 
County developers, financing institutions and consultants. The list is topped 
by Presley of Southern California, one of the county's biggest home builders. 
The Irvine-based firm donated $50,000 in the past month and more than $125,000 
overall to the pro-M campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has received a total of $125,000 from the William Lyon Co., which 
donated $25,000 since the current reporting period began in the last week of 
September. Another $25,000 came in earlier this month from the influential 
Lincoln Club of Orange County, one of the major Republican organizations in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffenblum said the pro-M forces are "not on the defensive" over the source of 
their operating funds, but rather are spending "all our time communicating the 
merits" of the sales-tax measure. "What (opponents) should be talking about is 
Measure M, not who's contributing to the campaign," he added. 
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the proponents' money has been spent on producing and 
distributing direct-mail campaign literature and manning phone banks, according 
to the campaign statement. Hoffenblum said the tactics would stay the same for 
the measure's supporters through Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a massive telephone (bank) operation," Hoffenblum said. "We're 
asking people if they support Measure M and, if they do, we're urging them to 
get out and vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, the sales tax in the county would increase from 6% to 6.5% 
on the dollar, raising a projected $3.1 billion to help pay for a far-reaching, 
$11.6-billion program to speed traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Freeways would be widened, car-pool lanes added and city streets streamlined. 
In addition, exclusive bus lanes and commuter rail service would be added, 
promoters promise. The tax increase is estimated to cost the average county 
resident about $50 to $75 a year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, many of the same donors contributed to a big-bucks campaign in support 
of a 1-cent sales tax hike for traffic improvements. Though opinion polls 
indicated it might pass, the measure was defeated by nearly a 3-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the measure say this year will be different, in large part because 
the tax increase is only a half-cent and traffic is worse than in 1984. In an 
effort to attract broader support from historically tax-wary Orange County 
voters, the proponents have included provisions in Measure M for a citizens' 
committee to oversee spending of the money collected. 
</P>
<P>
The list of contributors on the campaign disclosure statement for the pro-M 
forces reads like a Who's Who of powerful local developers, influential 
consultants and well-established financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
A-M Homes of Newport Beach; Bramalea California Inc.; Coto De Caza Ltd.; 
Standard Pacific of Orange County; Taylor Woodrow Homes California, and 
developer Kathryn G. Thompson have contributed $40,000 each since the last week 
in September, the disclosure statements show. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmanson Developments Inc.; Baldwin Builders Inc.; Home Capital Corp. of San 
Diego; the Irvine Co.; J.M. Peters Co. Inc.; Rancho Santa Margarita Joint 
Venture, and Sammis Co. donated $25,000 each during the reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
Contributions of $20,000 each came from Lincoln Property Co.; BCE Development 
Inc.; Birtcher Real Estate Inc.; Costain Homes Inc.; Anaheim-based Kaufman 
&amp; Broad; O'Donnell, Armstrong &amp; Partners Inc. of Irvine; Richmond 
American of Irvine, and Costa Mesa-based Warmington Homes. 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica Corp.; Brinderson Real Estate of Irvine; California Communities 
Inc. of Irvine; Diversified Shopping Centers of Costa Mesa; Hillman Properties 
West of Newport Beach; Hughes Aircraft Co.; the Leaverton Co. of Anaheim Hills; 
Pacific Mutual of Newport Beach; Recreations of California Inc.; Signal 
Landmark and Trammell Crow Associated, both of Irvine, have donated $10,000 
each during the past month, the disclosure statement showed.

WHAT MEASURE M WOULD PAY FOR 
</P>
<P>
Measure M, the proposed half-cent sales tax for transportation projects, would 
raise $3.1 billion over 20 years. Measure M designates which projects would be 
undertaken with passage, including: 
</P>
<P>
Ten-year-earlier completion of Santa Ana Freeway widening from the San Diego 
Freeway interchange in Irvine to the San Gabriel River Freeway in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding the interchange of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways, known as 
the El Toro "Y." 
</P>
<P>
Adding lanes to Interstate 5 in South County, the Riverside Freeway throughout 
the Orange County, the Orange Freeway from Diamond Bar to the Santa Ana 
Freeway, and adding lanes to the Costa Mesa Freeway between the Riverside and 
Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Building a 220-mile network of "super streets," using Orange County's 21 
busiest streets. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding Los Angeles-to-San Diego rail service, planning commuter train 
service between Riverside and Irvine and studying additional train service 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinating traffic signals throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Requiring every city and the county to adopt comprehensive growth management 
plans to link traffic relief with future development. 
</P>
<P>
Creating a citizens' oversight committee to monitor agencies' compliance with 
the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the added freeway lanes would be reserved for buses and car pools. 
Freeway projects would total $1.325 billion; street and road improvements would 
be $650 million; transit projects -- including rail -- $775 million, and 
regional projects such as "super streets" and signal coordination would get 
$350 million. If Measure M passes with more than 50% of the vote, county 
officials intend to use bonds to finance an early start of many projects.
