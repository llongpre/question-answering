<LEADPARA>  Pacific Bell, once part of the tightly knit family known affectionately as "Ma
Bell," is finally cutting its apron strings in a move that could turn
thousands of employees into orphans.;   In a news release today, Pac Bell said
it will eliminate its "employment security policy" for managers on April 1,
1992. That means unneeded management employees could be laid off for the first
time in Pac Bell history.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Until then, Pac Bell said it will seek to eliminate 3,000 management jobs
-- or about 17 percent of the company's 18,400 management positions -- by
offering early retirement packages and enhanced severance benefits.;   "The
plain fact is, we need fewer management employees," said Sam Ginn, chairman of
Pacific Telesis, the San Francisco-based holding company that owns Pac Bell.; 
 Pacific Telesis announced a plan in January 1990 to trim 11,000 jobs from its
total payroll of 62,000 by 1995. So far, the workforce is down by only 3,100
to 58,900.;   "After nearly two years, it is clear to me we are not reducing
as quickly as we must," Ginn said in a prepared statement. "Competition in our
markets is growing faster than ever. We need to pick up the pace if we are to
reach our goal.";   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which controlled almost
all of the nation's long-distance and local telephone service before a
court-ordered break-up in 1984, long had an informal "employment for life"
policy. Workers at the phone company knew that Ma Bell would always take care
of them.;   But the AT&amp;T break-up, which created Pacific Telesis to provide
local phone service in California and Nevada, is gradually forcing Pac Bell
and other phone companies to become more competitive. At the same time, new
technology is greatly reducing the number of employees needed to provide
service.;   The Communications Workers of America, a union representing about
30,000 Pac Bell employees, got an employment security agreement in 1986
allowing Pac Bell to eliminate jobs in exchange for a guarantee that workers
would be retrained and assigned to new positions. Pac Bell then turned around
and offered the same deal to its non-union management employees.;   Now, Pac
Bell is eliminating that protection for managers. Lou Saviano, a spokesman at
Pac Tel headquarters in San Francisco, said he didn't know if the company
would seek to eliminate employment security for union members after the CWA's
current contract expires in August of next year.  </TEXT>
