More than 450 telephones in the northern section of the city were knocked out 
of service Monday, apparently after a construction crew severed an underground 
phone cable, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency phone service to the Fire and Police departments was also severed for 
a short time around 2:20 p.m. until backup systems came on line, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were back on line as soon as we noticed the interruption in phone service," 
said Jack Stubbs, emergency planner for the city Fire Department. "It was just 
a few minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Phone company officials say they believe the accident occurred when a backhoe 
operator doing construction work near the intersection of Avenida Presidio and 
Calle Neblina severed an underground cable. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got (to the construction site) there was nobody there," said Linda 
Bonniksen, a spokeswoman for Pacific Bell. "But it appears as if that is what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Phone service was expected to be restored by midnight Monday, she said. FRANK
