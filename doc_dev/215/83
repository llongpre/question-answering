   A union representing 41,000 telephone workers at Bell Atlantic
walked off the job Sunday morning, joining counterparts at NYNEX
Corp. and Pacific Telesis who had begun a strike hours earlier,
union and company spokesmen said.
   Mary O'Hara, district coordinator in Philadelphia for the
Communications Workers of America, said talks with Bell Atlantic
broke up around 6:45 a.m. and pickets were being set up.
   Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, is parent to local phone
companies in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.
   Talks continued Sunday morning between another union, the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and the Bell
Atlantic subsidiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, said Tom
Duddy, a spokesman for Bell of Pennsylvania. That union represents
11,000 operators and clerical workers at the two subsidiaries.
   Hours earlier, more than 100,000 CWA and IBEW workers walked out
at New York-based NYNEX and San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis.
   A tentative agreement was reached between the CWA and a fourth
regional telephone company, Atlanta-based BellSouth, which employs
64,000 union workers and provides phone service in nine states in
the Southeast.
   Officials have said that most direct-dial telephone calls would
not be affected by phone company walkouts, because they are handled
by automated equipment, but customers could expect delays in
directory assistance calls, operator-assisted calls and in service
and installation jobs.
   In all, 221,000 telecommunications workers were covered by the
talks to replace contracts that expired at 11:59 p.m. Saturday. The
four companies provide service to 24 states and the nation's
capital.
   The regional telephone companies, nicknamed ``Baby Bells,'' were
created by the 1984 breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   Contracts with three of the other ``Baby Bells'' _ Ameritech, US
West and Southwestern Bell _ expire next Saturday. Those three
companies employ 131,000 union workers and provide phone service in
24 states.
   The unions announced the strike against New York-based NYNEX
well before the 11:59 EDT deadline, saying myriad differences
remained. So great were the differences that no formal talks were
held Saturday.
   NYNEX serves seven Northeast states: New York, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and parts of
Connecticut. CWA represents 40,000 NYNEX workers; IBEW 20,000.
   Talks with Pacific Telesis, based in San Francisco, were held
throughout the day but the unions announced the strike there at
midnight _ 3 a.m. EDT.
   Pacific Telesis is parent company of California's Pacific Bell
Co. and Nevada Bell Telephone Co. CWA represents 42,000 Pacific
Telesis workers; IBEW 2,500.
