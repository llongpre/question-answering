<LEADPARA>  One of the last vestiges of the paternal Bell System could go the way of the
party line with Pacific Bell's announcement Tuesday that it will end its
no-layoff policy.;   Pac Bell said it will eliminate its "employment security
policy" for managers on April 1. That means unneeded management employees
could be laid off for the first time in Pac Bell history.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Until then, Pac Bell said it will seek to eliminate 3,000 management jobs
-- or about 17 percent of the company's 18,400 management positions -- by
offering early retirement packages and enhanced severance benefits.;   "The
plain fact is, we need fewer management employees," said Sam Ginn, chairman of
Pacific Telesis, the San Francisco holding company that owns Pac Bell.;  
Pacific Telesis announced a plan in January 1990 to trim 11,000 jobs from its
total payroll of 62,000 by 1995. So far, the workforce is down by only 3,100
to 58,900.;   "After nearly two years, it is clear to me we are not reducing
as quickly as we must," Ginn said in a prepared statement. "Competition in our
markets is growing faster than ever. We need to pick up the pace if we are to
reach our goal.";   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which controlled almost
all of the nation's long-distance and local telephone service before a
court-ordered break-up in 1984, long had an informal "employment for life"
policy. Workers at the phone company knew that Ma Bell would always take care
of them.;   But aftershocks of the AT&amp;T break-up, which created Pacific
Telesis to provide local phone service in California and Nevada, are gradually
forcing Pac Bell and other phone companies to become more competitive. At the
same time, new technology is greatly reducing the number of employees needed
to provide service.;   The Communications Workers of America, a union
representing about 40,000 Pac Bell employees, got an employment security
agreement in 1986 allowing Pac Bell to eliminate jobs in exchange for a
guarantee that workers would be re-trained and assigned to new positions. Pac
Bell then offered the same deal to its non-union management employees.;   Now,
Pac Bell is eliminating that protection for managers. Lou Saviano, a spokesman
at Pac Tel headquarters in San Francisco, said he didn't know if the company
would seek to eliminate employment security for union members after the CWA's
contract expires next August.;   Harry Ibsen, an international vice president
at the CWA office in Burlingame, said it "is certainly a concern" for the
union.  </TEXT>
