MCI Communications, the second-largest US long-distance telecommunications
company which is part-owned by BT, the UK telecoms group, is seeking
permission in five states to provide local telephone services in competition
with Baby Bell regional phone operators.
The decision by MCI to seek to provide local telephone services in Illinois,
Maryland, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington comes days after the sale of
20 per cent of the company to BT was completed.
Some of the Dollars 4.3bn in cash BT spent on the stake is expected to help
finance MCI's drive into local telephone markets, assuming the company
receives the go-ahead from state regulators to compete with the Baby Bells
in offering various telephone services to business and residential
customers.
MCI wants to operate telephone services in the five states, not only because
it wants access to lucrative local markets, but also because it will be able
to avoid the fees it has to pay the Baby Bells to carry MCI long-distance
traffic within their markets.
In some cases, these fees cost MCI as much as 45 cents of every dollar of
revenue.
