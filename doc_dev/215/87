   The day is near when your home telephone line
will be an electronic pipeline to a wide variety of information
services.
   By punching numbers on your phone pad, you will be able to
select the programs you want to watch on cable television, leave
messages for callers when you're not home and, if you have a
computer, tap into a host of databases by dialing just one number.
   The seven regional Bell phone companies went to work quickly to
move their plans off the drawing boards when they got a green light
last week from a federal judge allowing them to offer these
services to consumers.
   Most of the companies say they will begin market trials of some
of the services this year and that some services may become
commercially available in certain areas by year's end, though
nationwide offering is probably several years away.
   Voice mail, which acts like a sophisticated answering machine,
is expected to have the most widespread consumer appeal and will be
among the first of the services to hit the commercial market in
most areas.
   This service would provide a telephone user with a ``voice mail
box'' in which callers could leave messages when the user's line is
busy or is not answered. The user could retrieve messages at his or
her convenience.
   ``It's like a mail box, except the letter is by voice,'' said
Linda Laskowski, vice president of the information provider market
for US West, one of the seven regional Bell companies. ``You can
get and receive information but you don't have to be there to do
it. What it really stops is telephone tag.''
   Users would not have to buy any hardware, like an answering
machine. With the services, all they would have to do is punch
instructions to the phone company on their phone pad.
   Many businesses have this service in their internal phone
systems now, but such private phone systems are not an option for
most households or small businesses because of the cost.
   The Bell companies say they haven't decided how customers will
be charged for voice mail, but Laskowski said, ``It will have to be
low enough for the average consumer to want to use it.''
   Heidi Harris, director of voice mail for Pacific Bell, suggested
that ``to send a single message might be within the range of a
postage stamp.''
   A related service is called voice messaging, which allows
callers to dial a number and reach dozens of recorded messages.
Once they've dialed in, a message would tell the callers to punch a
certain key to hear the weather report, for example, another key
for a stock report and another for sports scores. Another
application of this service would allow organizations to leave
messages for members.
   Both voice mail and messaging by the Bell companies will compete
with answering machines and could shut down many small businesses
that provide live telephone answering services, said Joseph Laseau,
executive vice president of the Association of Telemessaging
Services International Inc.
   ``We see these small businesses losing 10 to 15 percent of their
customers, and that could put them out of business,'' he said.
   The Bell companies also are moving to begin market trials on
services that will make it easier for computer users to send
information electronically to other computers and to dial into
information databases.
   Under U.S. District Judge Harold Greene's order, the companies
can transmit such information services but cannot generate the
information itself. They will be allowed to function as
``gateways,'' providing users with a menu of services they can
reach.
   Greene is the judge who presides over the breakup of American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which was stripped of its local Bell
operating companies four years ago. That led to the formation of
the seven regional Bell companies.
   Dozens of computer information services exist now, but users
must dial each separately to gain entry. The Bell companies will
now be allowed to provide a single phone number these users can
dial to reach many databanks.
   Companies also will be allowed to enable cable television
subscribers to use the touch pad on their phone to tell the cable
operator what channel they want to watch.
   Under such a system, subscribers could choose from among
programs on several channels and pay for what they watch, instead
of subscribing to all the programs on all the channels.
   The companies will have to get regulatory approvals for any of
the services they offer, and in market trials they will be trying
to determine what is easiest for consumers to use.
   They also will be trying to develop designs that will be
compatible from region to region, so that someone who is accustomed
to the voice-mail system in California can make a call in New York
and use the same keys for the same functions to store and send
messages. Compatibility also would allow people to take their
computer to another region and still be able to connect to local
databases.
   ``There has to be a lot of industry cooperation,'' said Gary
Handler, vice president of network planning at Bell Communications
Research, which does research and development for the Bell
companies. ``Widespread use of these services is going to depend on
(common industry) standards.''
   Handler said Bellcore is helping the seven companies coordinate
on technical standards, but each of the seven is developing its own
products.
