Bellcore, the research laboratory in Livingston, N.J., owned jointly by the 
Baby Bell phone companies, is experimenting with the "next generation" of voice 
mail services. 
</P>
<P>
The services being tested by 60 residential and business customers enable users 
to answer calls to their home from anywhere while the caller is still on the 
line, have their telephones ring at more than one location and let through only 
selected callers while directing others to leave a message. 
</P>
<P>
"We're learning how potential new services might be constructed and operated in 
future telephone networks and whether customers will be able to use these 
services easily and effectively," said project manager Maurice Lampell. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell is just starting its effort to sign up residential customers and 
small businesses for new telephone answering and messaging services. And 
California's second-largest local phone company, Thousand Oaks-based GTE 
California, has postponed "indefinitely" its commercial tests, according to 
spokesman Larry Cox. 
</P>
<P>
But out in the hinterlands, Contel of California has offered voice mail 
services for more than a year, though with modest results -- about 2% 
penetration in four markets: its headquarters city of Victorville and the 
resort areas of Big Bear, Mammoth Lakes and Stateline, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
Contel offers two levels of service: Basic answering service at $4.95 a month 
provides capacity to record 58 five-minute messages in a month; enhanced 
service, at a monthly flat rate of $19.95, receives and sends messages, 
automatically "stamping" each with the date and time, and enables customers to 
route a single message to up to 10 local numbers. (With special arrangements, 
Contel can compile message lists of up to 150 parties.) 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell is using Octel Communications' voice-messaging equipment, produced 
in Milpitas; Contel employs four machines from VMX Inc. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The entry of the so-called Baby Bells phone companies into the budding voice 
mail market became possible only in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A federal court in Washington ruled that the local phone companies could use 
their networks to carry voice mail and other electronic information services as 
long as they met two conditions: They could not produce the information 
services themselves and they had to treat all suppliers of information services 
equally. 
</P>
<P>
The court and the Federal Communications Commission required the companies to 
modify their phone systems to assure that all outside vendors offering services 
requiring use of the local networks pay the same prices for equal levels of 
service. BRUCE KEPPEL
