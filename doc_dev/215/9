<LEADPARA>  Mysterious computer software failures Wednesday disrupted telephone service
for millions of homes and offices in the Washington, D.C., area and Southern
California.;    For nearly six hours in the afternoon and evening, 5 million
customers in the Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Cos.' service area --
including the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia --
were unable to complete calls unless they were dialing nearby phones or long
distance.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Bell Atlantic Corp., the parent company of the C&amp;P companies, reported that
by 8 p.m. the system was back up and running, with a few scattered outages.;  
 Initial reports suggested the problem involved computer software, part of a
technology known as Signaling System 7, that is being installed to complete
calls more quickly and to allow new functions, such as Caller ID, to be added
to telephones.;    C&amp;P officials ruled out sabotage, computer hackers or
software viruses.;    By a strange coincidence, a similar problem was
occurring on the West Coast. From about 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. PDT, 3 million
telephone lines served by Pacific Bell broke down, leaving callers unable to
dial across town or long distance.;    A spokesman for Pacific Bell said there
was a buildup of calls in its Signaling System 7 computer, the same type of
system used by C&amp;P. Service was disrupted in much of the 213, 818, 714 and 805
area codes.;    "It seems like our software just decided to take the day off,"
said Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen in Orange County.;    Pacific
Bell officials said most service was restored by midafternoon.;    The
failures ranked among the largest ever to hit the U.S. telephone industry.;   
The Washington region's paralysis, which extended south to Richmond, north to
Baltimore and west to West Virginia, created an eerie interval of isolation
for people accustomed to instant communications.;    Federal government
agencies operating on their own network were able to place calls, but some had
difficulty receiving calls. The White House, the Pentagon, the FBI and the
Capitol appeared to function normally.  </TEXT>
