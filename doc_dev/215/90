Arctic air continued to assault Southern California on Sunday, bringing reports 
of snowfall in low-lying areas from Riverside to Orange County, keeping high 
temperatures at record or near-record low levels and prompting officials to 
issue freeze warnings for some agricultural areas. 
</P>
<P>
The peak reading of 53 degrees recorded at the Los Angeles Civic Center was 
only 1 degree warmer than the coldest high for the date, recorded in 1909. The 
mercury at UC Riverside only reached 47, shattering the old low maximum of 51 
degrees set in 1949.

Snow showers were reported in the San Bernardino Valley, and snow stuck to the 
ground for a time near Rancho Cucamonga, the National Weather Service said.

Temperatures in Mid-20s

<P>
March Air Force Base, near Riverside, reported snow showers at 1,500 feet 
elevation, and snow also fell in the Orange County community of Rancho Santa 
Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures were expected to drop into the mid-20s this morning and Tuesday, 
prompting the weather service to issue a frost advisory for inland valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Cold air moved into San Diego County with the weather service saying that the 
coldest inland areas will drop to the upper 20s. Agricultural interests in 
those areas were alerted to take measures to protect crops from frost since the 
temperature was expected to fall below freezing early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight will be even colder, the weather service said, as lows drop to the low 
and middle 20s. The frost advisory will remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, light snow covered the higher hills of the San 
Francisco Bay Area Sunday after overnight temperatures dipped below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
Snow was also reported at sea level in Marin County for the first time in 13 
years. Two inches fell at Dillon Beach and children made a small snowman at 
Agate Beach in the coastal town of Bolinas. 
</P>
<P>
Record low temperatures were reported in Red Bluff, where the mercury hit 22 
degrees early Sunday morning, the coldest in 100 years. A bone-chilling 21 
degrees, with a wind-chill factor of 16 degrees below zero, was recorded in 
Redding.

California Highway Patrol officers closed the Grapevine section of Interstate 5 
through the Tejon Pass and the Tehachapis on Sunday morning after snowplows 
were unable to keep the highway clear during a steady snowfall. The freeway, 
the main artery between the northern and southern halves of the state, was 
reopened to traffic at 2 p.m. when weather conditions improved. 
</P>
<P>
High temperatures in the Los Angeles Basin will be in the mid-50s today and 
tomorrow, with northeast winds gusting up to 25 m.p.h. below the canyons, said 
Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist at WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts 
for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The mercury will move up a degree or two on Wednesday, Dittmann said, but "the 
rest of the week is unsettled. Storms now over the Pacific are headed toward 
Southern California, and we may see wet weather for most of the region from 
Wednesday through Friday."
