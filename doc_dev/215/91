   In the biggest investment to date by any regional Bell telephone
company, Ameritech and Bell Atlantic are teaming up with two New
Zealand partners to buy New Zealand's state-owned phone company for
$2.4 billion.
   The two Bell companies announced the purchase agreement Thursday
morning in Wellington, New Zealand, and issued a news release late
Wednesday in the United States.
   The Telecom Corporation of New Zealand is the country's
principal supplier of domestic and international communications
services. It is being sold as part of the government's campaign of
selling off state-owned enterprises.
   Steve Ford, a spokesman at Ameritech's headquarters in Chicago,
said the two Baby Bell companies and their New Zealand partners won
the phone company in a bidding contest against other New Zealand
and international companies.
   He said it was the biggest single investment by any of the
regional Bell companies since they were created in the breakup of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. six years ago.
   ``This represents a significant step forward as we look to
become a major global telecommunications company,'' Ford said. The
New Zealand company has good growth prospects in its home market
and serves as a telecommunications gateway to the Pacific Rim, he
said.
   Raymond W. Smith, chairman and chief executive of Bell Atlantic,
said the purchase ``supports our strategy to be a leading
international information and communications company.''
   Under the deal, Ameritech and Bell Atlantic will buy all of the
phone company from the New Zealand government, then reduce their
combined stake to 49.9 percent, with each company owning 24.95
percent.
   The companies' two New Zealand partners _ Fay, Richwhite and
Freightways _ will buy 5 percent stakes each from Ameritech and
Bell Atlantic.
   The two American companies then will sell shares for the
remaining 40.1 percent on the New Zealand stock market and
internationally. The stock offering will be aimed at maximizing
participation by New Zealand investors, the companies said.
   Ameritech's Ford said the companies plan to complete the
purchase within 90 days and begin the stock offering in the first
quarter of 1991.
   Telecom of New Zealand had net income of $148 million on
revenues of $1.31 in the year ended March 31.
   Ameritech teamed up with Bell Atlantic because the two companies
have a similar strategy and their combined financial strength was
needed to make the purchase without affecting domestic operations,
Ford said.
   Ameritech will finance its share of the purchase with its own
cash and short-term borrowings, he said. The purchase won't affect
phone rates in the Midwest, he said. Ameritech owns Bell companies
providing phone service to 12 million customers in Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.
   Bell Atlantic is based in Philadelphia and provides telephone
service in the Mid-Atlantic region.
