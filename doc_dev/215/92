A Fountain Valley organization that helps children with disabilities was among 
eight groups nationwide that received grants from the settlement of a suit by 
Vietnam veterans who charged that Agent Orange had injured them or their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County group -- Team of Advocates for Special Kids, or TASK -- will 
use the $60,000, 1-year grant to teach local families of Vietnam veterans "how 
to meet their (disabled) child's special educational needs." 
</P>
<P>
TASK executive director Joan Tellefsen said she is pleased to represent one of 
the eight groups that received funding from among 147 proposals submitted by 
organizations around the country. "We are all so excited about this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley program provides counseling, legal information, educational 
workshops, telephone advocacy, awareness programs and a newsletter for parents 
who have disabled children. Tellefsen said TASK plans to expand its services to 
include a program tailored to disabled children of Vietnam veterans. TASK, 
which began in 1977, helped more than 3,000 families in Southern California 
last year, Tellefsen said.

The $53-million Agent Orange Class Assistance Program, which funded Thursday's 
grants, was established as part of the settlement of a class-action suit 
brought 10 years ago by veterans claiming that exposure to the chemical Agent 
Orange caused cancer, birth defects and other illnesses. After a long court 
battle, seven chemical companies that manufactured Agent Orange settled out of 
court in 1984 for $180 million, which has grown to $240 million with 
accumulated interest. The $53-million assistance program is part of that $240 
million. The largest portion, $170 million, provides cash payments to disabled 
Vietnam veterans, or the widows and children of veterans. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government sprayed Agent Orange over much of Vietnam during the 1960s 
to destroy fields and deprive communist troops of valuable forest cover. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rhoades, who is in charge of distributing the Agent Orange Class 
Assistance Program funds over the next 10 years, said that the proposal by the 
Orange County group caught his eye because "it was economical, it was well 
written and it was by people who were obviously very committed." 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades said that the grant program is not intended to replace government 
funding for veterans but instead will try to fund innovative ideas and help 
develop a network for existing services. The grants awarded Thursday, which 
totaled $580,000, were the first to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades said the original $53 million in grant money could grow to $75 million 
in the next several years.
