   Southern Bell Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said it will begin a three-year, $1.5 billion capital spending program to upgrade its telephone network in Georgia. 

   The BellSouth Corp. unit, which provides telephone service in four Southern states, said it will improve or replace 97 central offices with new computerized switches. 
In addition, the company said it will install an additional 30,500 miles of fiber optics cable. 

   After completion of the program, all of Southern Bell's 2.4 million Georgia customers will have access to all long-distance carriers on the same basis as they do now to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. 
The advanced central offices will also enable the company to provide all customers with such service options as call waiting, call forwarding and three-way calling.
