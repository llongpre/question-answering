<LEADPARA>  Telephone breakdowns affecting more than 10 million customers in five states
and Washington, D.C., in the past week may have been caused by a computer
virus or other sabotage, phone executives say.;    The latest major outage --
a six-hour disruption Monday affecting more than 1 million customers in
western Pennsylvania -- could be linked to similar breakdowns in California,
Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and the nation's capital, they said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Telephone service in western Pennsylvania was disrupted again late this
morning when some lines became jammed, said Bell spokesman Tom Duddy. He said
an unknown number of customers were having some difficulty placing calls
outside of their immediate area. The problem did not seem to be as widespread
as Monday's outage, he said.;    "We're hoping to nip it in the bud," he
said.;    Bell of Pennsylvania and its parent, Bell Atlantic Corp., said
Monday's disruption of long-distance service probably was caused by a glitch
in recently installed software, but the exact source of the problem was not
known.;    Technicians were looking into several possibilities, including a
computer virus or other sabotage, they said.;    "It looks as though the
triggering events might have been different" in various states, "but once
triggered, the symptoms were very similar," said Bob Valentini, Bell of
Pennsylvania president and chief operating officer.;    The outage in
Pennsylvania began about 11:15 a.m., when lines that relay signals between
computers became jammed, Valentini said. The overload prevented long-distance
calls from getting through until shortly after 5 p.m.;    "What happened today
is still a little bit mysterious. In fact, it's a lot mysterious," said Don
Burns, a Bell Atlantic vice president. "We're looking for common factors.";   
All the affected telephone companies use similar computer switching systems.; 
  A breakdown Wednesday in the Washington area was caused by a faulty circuit
board in a Baltimore switching station, Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co.
said. Service was disrupted in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and
Washington.;    Overloaded circuits interrupted service in Southern California
on the same day, but the cause remains unknown, Pacific Bell said.;    "The
fact that we've had, in the short period of a month, several outages, causes
us to believe that something has been introduced," Burns said.;    The
investigation focused mainly on the new software added in recent weeks, said
Bell Atlantic spokesman Larry Plumb. An inadequately written computer code
could be to blame, he said.;    A software problem also shut down service to
45,000 Greensboro, N.C., telephone lines for about 2 1/2 hours Monday,
Southern Bell said.  </TEXT>
