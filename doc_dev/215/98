Mention earthquakes and Orange County residents look to the notorious San 
Andreas Fault, 30 miles northeast of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Yet 
experts say a greater danger lies underfoot the Newport-Inglewood Fault slicing 
north along the Orange County coast from Newport Beach. It has already provided 
the worst urban quake in Southern California history -- the 1933 Long Beach 
Earthquake that killed 120 people and caused $40 million damage. Yet that 
6.3-magnitude jolt was not the worst this fault can deliver. Geologists believe 
a quake of at least magnitude 7 is possible -- and that would cause more death 
and destruction than an even greater quake along the San Andreas. Based on 
interviews with experts and a scenario recently published by the state, here is 
what Orange County would be like if a 7.3-magnitude quake struck at 7:41 on a 
typical Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
* A major water line snaps near Fullerton Creek in Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
* El Toro Marine Corps Air Station closes for 6 hours, but an inspection of 
runways finds no serious damage because the facility is inland and not subject 
to significant ground settlement 
</P>
<P>
* John Wayne Airport sustains damage to the runway, fuel tanks and other 
structures. Closed for 24 hours, it reopens after repairs are made at the 
northeast end of its runway. But surrounding freeway damage makes it difficult 
to passengers to reach the terminal 
</P>
<P>
* Sewage plant in Fountain Valley, one of two serving 80% of the county's 
2.1-million residents is severely damaged and likely to remain that way for 
weeks or months. Raw sewage overflows into streets and the ocean 
</P>
<P>
* The Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center -- an emergency earthquake 
operations post -- sustains significant damage to runways, fuel tanks and 
structures. Closed for 24 hours, it reopens for landings of C-130 cargo planes 
bearing relief supplies 
</P>
<P>
* Alamitos power plant is shut down for more than 3 days 
</P>
<P>
* Haynes power plant is shut down for more than 3 days 
</P>
<P>
* A major natural gas line to the Huntington Beach power plant ruptures east of 
Bolsa Chica Beach State Park 
</P>
<P>
* Huntington Beach power plant is shut down for more than 3 days 
</P>
<P>
* Sewage plant in Huntington Beach, one of two serving 80% of the county's 
2.1-million residents is severely damaged and likely to remain that way for 
weeks or months. Raw sewage overflows into streets and the ocean 
</P>
<P>
* San Onofre nuclear power plant, 5 miles south of San Clemente, is undamaged 
</P>
<P>
* Storage tanks in Seal Beach are damaged and spill fuel into Alamitos Bay 
</P>
<P>
* Water Supply 
</P>
<P>
Water lines and pumping stations near the fault are damaged, forcing coastal 
cities to rely on local storage facilities and tank trucks for drinking water 
</P>
<P>
* Natural Gas 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of underground natural gas connections are leaking and many have been 
ignited 
</P>
<P>
Phones 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the region, telephone switching equipment is overloaded and 
automatically shuts down a few minutes after the quake. Within 25 miles of the 
fault, phone lines designated for essential services are 25% usable after the 
first day, 50% usable after the second day and 75% usable at the end of the 
third day. The restoration of phone service to the public will be significantly 
slower 
</P>
<P>
'Strike-slip' Fault 
</P>
<P>
* Earthquakes along the Newport-Inglewood and San Andreas fault occur when 
earth on either side of the fault line lurches horizontally in opposite 
directions. In contrast to the "strike-slip" fault, a "thrust" fault -- such as 
the one that caused the 1971 Sylmar-San Fernando quake -- has one sides that 
moves vertically up or down against the other 
</P>
<P>
Richter Scale 
</P>
<P>
In 1935, former Caltech professor Charles F. Richter devised a logarithmic 
scale that grades the severity of earthquakes. Each whole number on the scale 
indicates a quake that is 10-times greater than the number before. A magnitude 
of 5.0, for example, would be 10-times a 4.0, but 100-times a 3.0. The atomic 
bomb dropped on Hiroshima -- about 20,000 tons of TNT -- would amount to a 6.3 
earthquake. So the 7.3-magnitude quake in the Newport-Inglewood scenario would 
exert 10-times the force

Hospitals

Hospitals nearest the fault zone lose the use of 50% of their beds due to loss 
of power and equipment failures. Hospitals further away suffer 25% loss.

* San Diego Freeway, closed through Long Beach due to bridge and pavement 
damage, has one lane open where it meets the San Gabriel Freeway and is partly 
open through Seal Beach. Considerable damage has closed all 10 lanes through 
Westminster, Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley, Costa Mesa and Irvine to just 
beyond Jamboree Road. Some parts are expected to remain so for 3 days, but the 
stretch in Costa Mesa and Irvine will be closed indefinately 
</P>
<P>
* MacArthur Boulevard is closed on both sides of San Diego Creek, near the UC 
Irvine campus, and is expected to remain so for 3 days 
</P>
<P>
* Pacific Coast Highway is closed from Seal Beach to Corona del Mar and is 
expected to remain so for 3 days 
</P>
<P>
* Costa Mesa Freeway is severely damaged at the Pacific Coast Highway 
interchange and no traffic is expected to use it for 3 days. The freeway is 
partly open from there to the San Diego Freeway, but the remaining stretch to 
the Santa Ana Freeway is closed due to heavy bridge and interchange damage and 
is expected to remain so for 3 days 
</P>
<P>
* Garden Grove Freeway is damaged at interchanges with the San Diego Freeway, 
where traffic will be blocked for 36 hours, and Beach Boulevard, where traffic 
will be blocked for more than 3 days. In Garden Grove, there is light damage at 
the freeway's interchange with Harbor Boulevard. But major ground failures 
along the freeway are expected to block traffic for at least 2 days 
</P>
<P>
* Santa Ana Freeway is open but has localized damage from Buena Park to San 
Juan Capistrano 
</P>
<P>
* Artesia/Riverside Freeway is open but has localized damaged from Buean Park 
to Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
* Orange Freeway is open but has localized damage from Brea to the Santa Ana 
Freeway 
</P>
<P>
* Beach Boulevard is open but has localized damage from Buena Park to Garden 
Grove. It is partly closed from the Garden Grove Freeway to the San Diego 
Freeway and around Pacific Coast Highway

A Closer Look 
</P>
<P>
Geologists say the width of the Newport-Inglewood Fault line varies and much of 
it lies beneath the surface
