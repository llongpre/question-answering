The state Public Utilities Commission today scrapped its 50-year-old system of 
regulating telephone rates and adopted a new plan tying rates to inflation, 
encouraging new technology and promising Pacific Bell customers a rate 
decrease. 
</P>
<P>
"Local telephone companies are becoming more like competitive businesses and 
should be treated that way," commission President G. Mitchell Wilk said before 
the new system was approved on a 5-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell and GTE California, the other company affected, both praised the 
plan. A consumer group, Toward Utility Rate Normalization, called it "a 
dangerous ride down an unmapped road." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, effective next year, is part of an overall policy by PUC members, 
appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian, to loosen some of its traditional 
regulation and scrutiny of management decisions by utility companies in 
telecommunications, energy and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Current phone rates are based on the commission's determination of major phone 
companies' revenue needs, based on its costs, efficiency and the state of the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, rates will be changed annually according to this formula: 
A federal inflation index called the Gross National Product Price Index will be 
reduced by 4.5%, based on the assumption that phone companies can increase 
their productivity by that amount each year. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if inflation is 4.8%, the figure shown by the index this past 
March, the rate increase would be 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The companies' basic rate of return on investment will be set at 11.5% as of 
Jan. 1. Carl Danner, an aide to Wilk, said the result will probably be a rate 
decrease of $100 million or more for Pacific Bell next year and probably little 
change for GTE, which had a 20% rate cut last year. 
</P>
<P>
If a company increased its efficiency to earn a higher rate of return, 
stockholders could keep all amounts up to 13%. Additional earnings up to 16.5% 
will be split 50-50 with ratepayers, and any amounts above 16.5% will belong to 
ratepayers. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime next year, the $1.20-a-month charge for touch-tone telephone service 
will be eliminated, and the free local calling area will be expanded from eight 
to 12 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC said Pacific Bell will be allowed to spend $405 million to modernize 
its system over the next three years so that 950,000 customers will have access 
to services they lack.
