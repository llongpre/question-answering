   A group that defends the legend of Billy
the Kid says a computer photo analysis indicates a Texan nicknamed
``Brushy Bill'' who died in 1950 probably wasn't the famed outlaw,
as he had claimed.
   The computer tests compared a photograph of Ollie L. ``Brushy
Bill'' Roberts, who died in Hico, Texas, a week short of his 90th
birthday in December 1950, and a tintype of William Bonney, who
died at age 21 on July 14, 1881.
   Most people, including a coroner's inquest jury at the time, say
Bonney was Billy the Kid and he was shot to death in Fort Sumter,
N.M., by Lincoln Sheriff Pat Garrett.
   But Hico has its share of Brushy Bill believers who maintain the
Kid escaped, perhaps with official help, to survive to a ripe old
age in Texas.
   Billy the Kid was one of the primary players in the bloody
Lincoln County War of the late 19th century. Now, the Lincoln
County Heritage Trust is watching out for the Kid's legend, and it
initiated the photo project.
   Trust director Robert L. Hart said Friday the computer tests
were based on a similarity index of 25 landmarks on the faces.
   The computer also matched Billy to a database of 150 people from
both sexes and many racial groups, Hart said, to show how many
people in the sample, if any, were closer in appearance to Billy
than was Brushy Bill.
   From the 25 landmarks of the face the computer mathematically
derives a single number _ the index of similarity.
   If Brushy Bill and Billy the Kid were the same man, Hart said,
``then in the comparison, Billy is No. 1 and Brushy should come out
No. 2.''
   ``When the comparison was run, Brushy Bill was No. 42.
   ``That means there were 40 other individuals who look more like
Billy the Kid than Brushy does. In short, Brushy doesn't look very
much like Billy the Kid at all,'' Hart said.
   Hico Justice of the Peace Bobby Hefner, a Brushy Bill buff, said
Friday the computer study means nothing.
   ``I don't accept the tintype as being Billy the Kid at all,''
Hefner said in a telephone interview from his Hico home. ``On the
other hand, I don't accept the study. You let me program my
computer, and I guarantee Brushy Bill'd be number one.''
   But Clyde Snow, an Oklahoma forensic anthropologist known for
his work on the remains of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele, said
the computer looks at photographs in a less subjective way than
people do.
   ``As far as Brushy Bill Roberts is concerned, the weight of the
evidence is to the point that if there were a court case, we'd be
willing to go in and say beyond a reasonable doubt the two
photographs are not photographs of the same individual,'' Snow said.
   Hart said the Brushy Bill comparison is the only one that has
been done. But the project plans to look at a dozen or so other
photographs, including pictures of two other claimants, John Miller
of Ramah, N.M., and Walking Henry Smith, and photographs believed
to be those of Billy taken at other times.
   That could take a couple of years.
   Hart called the project a ``marriage of history and technology.''
   ``Historians don't seem to be able to solve the problem of
whether Brushy Bill and Billy the Kid are the same person,'' and
bringing in science was another way to answer the question, he said.
   The photographs, one from a Las Vegas, N.M., collection and the
other owned by a San Francisco family, came to light after the
project began last year.
   Hefner, 54, agreed research would continue into the legend of
Billy the Kid.
   ``The old Texas Rangers had a saying that no one can stand up to
a man that's in the right and keeps on a-comin'. And that's my
approach to this,'' Hefner said. ``I'm in the right. I've enough
evidence in hand to convince anyone that doesn't have a prejudice.
   ``I never met old Brushy,'' he said. ``Maybe it's my sense of
fair play, of being justice of the peace: I want justice done for a
local man. I'd like to see it on through to a just conclusion.''
