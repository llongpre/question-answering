   Children across the country have put up
allowances and revenues from Kool-Aid stands to raise more than
$2,000 for a crippled cub named Billy the Bear, who needs an
operation.
   ``Never have we had this kind of attention with an animal,'' said
Dave Siddon, whose Wildlife Images rehabilitation center cares for
wild animals ranging from pygmy owls to cougars.
   Weighing just 10 pounds, the black bear was found as an orphan a
month ago west of Redding, Calif.
   ``He was caught by a dog,'' Siddon said. ``His legs were
dislocated. He needs an operation to put them back in place.''
   Rushell Ritualo of Renton, Wash., wrote after seeing a story on
television about Billy's plight that she had planned to buy art
supplies with her allowance, ``but I heard about you and I wanted to
give it to you for your operation.''
   Letters also came from around Oregon, California, Colorado, South
Dakota, North Dakota, Kansas, Idaho, Florida and Nevada.
   A boy named Ryan from Denver sent $1. ``It's only a buck but we
care,'' he wrote.
   Locally, a girl contributed $2.85 she raised at her Kool-Aid
stand.
   Siddon said a little more than $2,000 in donations, mostly from
children, have come in for Billy, who drinks from a baby bottle and
wears a pair of toddler's footed pajamas.
   Siddon has contacted a number of veterinarians and physicians
about performing the operation and hopes to have a CAT scan of the
injury. He said he did not know how much the surgery would cost but
expected it would run into thousands of dollars.
   Siddon did not know how soon the operation could be performed,
but he said if all goes well, Billy will be returned to the wild.
