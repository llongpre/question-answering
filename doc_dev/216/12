   Today is Thursday, July 14, the 196th day of 1988. There are 170
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On July 14, 1789, the French Revolution was in full swing as
citizens of Paris stormed the Bastille prison and released the
seven prisoners inside.
   On this date:
   In 1798, Congress passed the Sedition Act, making it a federal
crime to publish false, scandalous or malicious writing about the
U.S. government.
   In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry relayed to Japanese officials a
letter from former President Millard Fillmore, requesting trade
relations.
   In 1881, outlaw William H. Bonney Jr., alias ``Billy the Kid,''
was shot and killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett in Fort Sumner, N.M.
   In 1921, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were convicted in
Dedham, Mass., in the killing of a shoe company paymaster and his
guard. (Sacco and Vanzetti were executed six years later.)
   In 1958, the army of Iraq overthrew the monarchy.
   In 1966, eight student nurses were murdered by Richard Speck in
a Chicago dormitory.
   In 1976, Jimmy Carter won the Democratic presidential nomination
by an overwhelming margin at the party's convention in New York.
   In 1982, baseball's National League scored a 4-1 victory over
the American League in Montreal for its 11th straight All-Star
triumph, and 19th in 20 years.
   In 1986, a federal judge in Los Angeles sentenced Richard W.
Miller _ the only FBI agent ever convicted of espionage _ to two
life terms plus 50 years in prison for spying for the Soviet Union.
   Ten years ago: Soviet dissident Anatoly Shcharansky was
convicted of treasonous espionage and anti-Soviet agitation, and
sentenced to 13 years at hard labor. (Shcharansky was released by
the Soviets as part of a prisoner exchange with the United States
in 1986.)
   Five years ago: Two members of the U.S. House of
Representatives, Illinois Republican Daniel Crane and Massachusetts
Democrat Gerry Studds, admitted having had sexual relations with
congressional pages, and were later censured by the full House.
   One year ago: As Lt. Col. Oliver North concluded six days of
testimony before the Iran-Contra committees, President Reagan told
reporters ``you won't be able to shut me up'' about the hearings
once they end. Also, the National League took 13 innings to defeat
the American League, 2-0, in baseball's 58th All-Star Game in
Oakland, Calif.
   Today's birthdays: Author Isaac Bashevis Singer is 84. Actor
Terry-Thomas is 77. Former President Gerald R. Ford is 75. Former
CBS newscaster Douglas Edwards is 71. Movie director Ingmar Bergman
is 70. NBC News commentator John Chancellor is 61. Football
player-turned-actor Rosey Grier is 56.
   Thought for today: ``Changes (in life) are not only possible and
predictable, but to deny them is to be an accomplice to one's own
unnecessary vegetation.'' _ Gail Sheehy, American journalist and
author.
