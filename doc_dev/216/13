   Lou Diamond Phillips was thrown and
dragged by a horse during filming of ``Young Guns 2,'' and suffered
a broken arm that required 2{ hours of surgery, his publicist said.
   The Philippine-born actor, best known for his roles as singer
Ritchie Valens in ``La Bamba'' and as a defiant math student in
``Stand and Deliver,'' took the fall Friday evening when a noise
startled the horse, said publicist Eddie Michaels.
   Phillips, 28, was dragged across the former set of
``Silverado,'' which is being used in the ``Young Guns II'' sequel,
Michaels said.
   Phillips was airlifted to the University of New Mexico Hospital
in Albuquerque, where he underwent 2{ hours of surgery, Michaels
said. In addition to his broken arm, he suffered a gash on his knee.
   ``He was hurting a little bit but everything was real good as
far as his emotional state,'' Michaels said.
   The film is near the end of production and scenes that don't
require Phillips will be shot first, Michaels said.
   ``He won't be able to do anything for a while, but they'll do
everything they can around him at this point,'' he said.
   Cerrillos, a hamlet about 10 miles west of Galisteo, has been
transformed to represent old Lincoln, N.M., the scene of the bloody
Lincoln County War where Billy the Kid gained notoriety in the late
19th century.
   The ``Young Guns'' movies are based on the Billy the Kid story.
Phillips plays a half-Indian friend of Billy the Kid, played by
Emilio Estevez.
   Galisteo is about 20 miles south of Santa Fe.

   Corey Feldman, who is facing drug possession
charges, has thanked his fans for their support and urged them to
resist drugs.
   The 18-year-old actor is to be arraigned April 4 on two felony
counts of possession. Each count carries a maximum penalty of four
years in prison.
   Authorities said 25 balloons of heroin and cocaine were found in
his car during a March 9 traffic stop. He was released on $5,000
bail the next day.
   ``Corey wants to tell everyone who has been nice enough to wire
and call to keep the faith in him and in God and to stay away from
drugs in any way,'' his publicist, Michael Levine, said in a
statement Friday.
   Feldman has appeared in such films as ``Stand by Me,'' ``The
Goonies,'' ``Dream A Little Dream'' and ``The 'Burbs.''

   Jeff Conaway, who played the role of an
aspiring actor on the TV series ``Taxi,'' has been charged with
felony drunken driving after his car allegedly sideswiped and
injured a bicyclist.
   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office charged
Conaway on Friday with two counts of drunken driving and a
misdemeanor charge of giving false information to a police officer,
said deputy district attorney Allan S. Tyson.
   Prosecutors allege Conaway, 39, was speeding on a city street
when his sports car sideswiped bicyclist Farid Farhan, 31. Farhan
suffered a broken leg and a head wound needing 15 stitches in the
Feb. 23 accident.
   Tests indicated Conaway had a blood alcohol content of .15, or
nearly twice the state legal limit of .08, authorities said.
   Conaway was released on $2,500 bail, and is to be arraigned
April 5.
   He portrayed Bobby Wheeler, a frustrated actor waiting for his
big break. He left ``Taxi'' in 1981, about a year before the show
was canceled. Conaway also co-starred in the 1978 movie ``Grease''
with John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.

   Country singer Rose Maddox is staging a
concert April 1 to benefit her granddaughter, who fell into a coma
after being knocked down by a car last month but recently regained
consciousness.
   Maddox said she will perform with her band, Foggy Notion, and
three other groups at a benefit in nearby Medford to cover medical
expenses for 15-year-old Kelli Lynn Hale, whose family has no
medical insurance. The girl was struck by a car when she ran across
the street while looking for her cat.
   Maddox's career has spanned more than a half-century and earned
her induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville,
Tenn.
   The girl is making a steady recovery at a Medford hospital, said
Maddox.

   Jaime Escalante, the high school math teacher
whose career was profiled in the movie ``Stand and Deliver,'' says
he has changed his mind about leaving Garfield High School.
   The 59-year-old calculus instructor decided to remain for
another two years after receiving more than 500 letters and
telephone calls from former students and supporters.
   ``Everything is cool now,'' he said Friday. ``For the time
being, I will stay here. This is where I belong and the kids
appreciate what I do.''
   Escalante has taught at Los Angeles schools for 16 years. Last
month, he said he would resign because of frustration with parents
who in his view do not value academic achievement and a lack of
administrative support.
   One reason he is staying is the National Science Foundation
program he supervises at East Los Angeles College, he said. The
program teaches accelerated mathematics, science and English, and
trains teachers in Escalante's own methods.
   ``If I left the (high) school, I would lose my recruitment
network,'' Escalante said.
   Escalante said he had received several job offers over the past
three weeks, including unspecified opportunities in education
offered by President Bush and Gov. George Deukmejian.
   He received widespread attention in 1982 when all 18 of his
calculus students at an inner-city school passed national advanced
placement exams for college credit, and test administrators
challenged the results. Twelve students took the test a second time
and passed. The episode was portrayed in ``Stand and Deliver,''
starring Edward James Olmos as Escalante.
