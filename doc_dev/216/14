   Today is Friday, July 14, the 195th day of 1989. There are 170
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Two hundred years ago, on July 14, 1789, citizens of Paris
stormed the Bastille prison and released the seven prisoners inside,
in the symbolic climax of the French revolution.
   On this date:
   In 1798, Congress passed the Sedition Act, making it a federal
crime to publish false, scandalous or malicious writing about the
United States government.
   In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry relayed to Japanese officials a
letter from former President Millard Fillmore, requesting trade
relations.
   In 1881, outlaw William H. Bonney Jr., alias ``Billy the Kid,''
was shot and killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett in Fort Sumner, N.M.
   In 1921, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were convicted in
Dedham, Mass., in the killing of a shoe company paymaster and his
guard. (Sacco and Vanzetti were executed six years later.)
   In 1958, the army of Iraq overthrew the monarchy.
   In 1966, eight student nurses were murdered by Richard Speck in a
Chicago dormitory.
   In 1976, Jimmy Carter won the Democratic presidential nomination
by an overwhelming margin at the party's convention in New York.
   In 1978, Soviet dissident Anatoly Shcharansky was convicted of
treasonous espionage and anti-Soviet agitation, and sentenced to 13
years at hard labor. (Shcharansky was released in 1986.)
   In 1982, the National League scored a 4-1 victory over the
American League in Montreal for its 11th straight All-Star triumph,
and 19th in 20 years.
   In 1983, two members of Congress, Illinois Republican Daniel
Crane and Massachusetts Democrat Gerry Studds, admitted having
sexual relations with Congressional pages, and were later censured
by the full House.
   In 1986, a federal judge in Los Angeles sentenced Richard W.
Miller _ the only FBI agent ever convicted of espionage _ to two
life terms plus 50 years in prison for spying for the Soviet Union.
   In 1987, the National League took 13 innings to defeat the
American League, 2-0, in the 58th All-Star Game in Oakland, Calif.
   Ten years ago: President Jimmy Carter ended his 10-day domestic
summit at Camp David, Md., and returned to the White House to
prepare a speech for the next evening.
   Five years ago: New Zealand's Labor Party, led by David Lange,
won a landslide election victory, ending conservative Prime Minister
Robert Muldoon's nine-year tenure.
   One year ago: Speaking before the U.N. Security Council, Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati denounced the U.S. downing of an
Iranian jetliner over the Persian Gulf on July 3 as ``a barbaric
massacre.'' Vice President Bush replied that the USS Vincennes had
fired in self-defense.
   Today's Birthdays: Author Isaac Bashevis Singer is 85. Actor

CBS newscaster Douglas Edwards is 72. Movie director Ingmar Bergman
is 71. NBC News commentator John Chancellor is 62. Football

   Thought for Today: ``Revolution is not a dinner party, nor an
essay, nor a painting, nor a piece of embroidery; it cannot be
advanced softly, gradually, carefully, considerately, respectfully,
politely, plainly and modestly.'' _ Mao Tse-tung (1893-1976).
