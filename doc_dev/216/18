<LEADPARA>  A modern-day Billy the Kid wanted for alleged kidnapping and cattle rustling
is back on the loose after he and two other men escaped from the Santa Cruz
County Jail on Friday night.;    A statewide search was mounted Saturday for
Brett Miller, 26, who along with John Bolander, 35, and Danny Atkinson, 22,
scaled a 15-foot wall and tore through a chain-link fence to break out of the
jail.  </LEADPARA>

JAIL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Miller, whose rap sheet goes back to his days as a young Watsonville
outlaw, was being held for violating probation. He also is charged with
kidnapping a bank manager in San Luis Obispo County and a host of cattle
rustling counts in the San Joaquin Valley. It was Miller's second escape from
the jail and at least his third from custody.;    Bolander, a Scotts Valley
resident, was being held in a child-molestation case. Atkinson, of Santa Cruz,
faces a weapons charge.;    The three men escaped at about 5:55 p.m. during
the evening meal from an enclosed patio area in the jail, said Sgt. Craig
Little of the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Department.;    The prisoners scaled
the patio wall, probably by helping each other, Little said. They then tore
through an overhead chain-link screen and scrambled across a roof and over a
perimeter fence, setting off a detector alarm on the fence.;    The men were
last seen by a security camera running north along the San Lorenzo River.
Members of the sheriff's department and the California Highway Patrol combed
the river through the night.;    Miller, who Little said was "somewhat of an
escape risk," had been placed under maximum security. Little said he was not
aware of any connection between Miller and the other escapees, and that the
three had not been placed close together in the jail.;    Miller, who grew up
in Watsonville and had been living under an assumed name in a trailer near
Santa Margarita in San Luis Obispo County, was picked up last month by
deputies who wanted to talk to him about the probation violation, the
kidnapping and the cattle thefts.;    The San Luis Obispo County posse found
Miller hidden under the lid of an almost-full water tank sunk in the ground
near his trailer.;    Sheriff's detective Mike Sheridan said Miller and some
associates were wanted in connection with the April 12 kidnapping of Rita Kaye
Roy, 47, of Templeton. He said the woman, operations manager of the Bank of
America branch in Atascadero, was robbed of her bank keys, then was freed in a
remote area, where she walked to a farmhouse and notified authorities.
Sheridan said Miller and his gang had planned on robbing the bank.;    The
cattle rustling, said a Merced County sheriff's investigator, involved calves
stolen late at night from dairies in Stanislaus and Merced counties and sold
at livestock markets around the state.;    In Santa Cruz County, Miller's
criminal history stretches back almost a decade. He once was charged with
conspiracy to kidnap the manager of a Watsonville bank, and with attempting to
extort $500,000 from a prominent Watsonville family.;    In a plea bargain in
that case, Miller entered a guilty plea to the extortion attempt and to
conspiracy to commit robbery, a charge stemming from the alleged plot to
kidnap the banker -- the same scheme Miller is charged with in the San Luis
Obispo kidnapping.;    Miller was sentenced to 12 years in prison on those
charges and several other felonies, including assault. Under state guidelines,
the actual sentence was more like 4 1/2 years, Santa Cruz County District
Attorney Art Danner said.;    "We tried to put him away for as long as we
could," Danner said. "Our prediction, which has proven true, was that he was
going to commit more crimes at every opportunity.";    One deputy recalled
that Miller kept a flock of illegal fighting cocks in a motor home parked in
Watsonville, and once was found in a Southern California motel room with an
arsenal of assault weapons and the body of a friend who had overdosed on
drugs.;    "The kid's a classic," Tony Salatich, a lawyer who defended Miller
in his earlier kidnapping and extortion cases, has said. "I think he sees a
movie of himself running in his head. He sees himself as being somewhere
between Billy the Kid and Bonnie and Clyde.";    Miller first escaped from the
Santa Cruz County Jail in 1986, where he was being held on an extortion charge
and where he set his mattress on fire. He also disappeared from a sheriff's
van at the Watsonville courthouse annex the previous year.;    And as a youth
wanted on several warrants, he fled pursuing officers by jumping into the
Pajaro River.  </TEXT>
