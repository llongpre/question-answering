   Aaron Copland, the immigrants' son from Brooklyn
who used jazz rhythms of the South, folk songs of Appalachia and
cowboy tunes of the prairie to create classical music that was
unmistakably American, has died at 90.
   The composer, who lived in Peekskill, died Sunday at Phelps
Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown of pneumonia. He had suffered
two strokes recently.
   The ``dean of American music'' created such classics as
``Appalachian Spring,'' ``Rodeo,'' ``Billy the Kid'' and ``Lincoln
Portrait.'' Leonard Bernstein once called Copland's 1942 orchestral
composition ``Fanfare for the Common Man'' the ``all-time top of
the hit parade in American music.''
   The son of Eastern European immigrants, he strove to be more
American than most Americans and sought to focus the international
spotlight on his fellow American composers.
   ``He put American music on the map. He decided that there should
be an American sound, a place for the American composer,'' Vivian
Perlis, who collaborated with the composer on his 1984 memoir,
``Copland,'' said Sunday.
   Copland wrote two operas, six ballets and eight film scores,
including his Oscar-winning music for William Wyler's ``The
Heiress'' in 1948.
   He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1945 for the ballet ``Appalachian
Spring,'' based on a Shaker melody played by a clarinet. It was
choreographed by Martha Graham.
   His ballets ``Billy the Kid'' in 1938 and ``Rodeo'' in 1942 make
use of cowboy tunes and folk songs.
   Other works included the score for ``The Red Pony,'' the 1949
movie based on the novel by John Steinbeck, and ``Lincoln
Portrait,'' music performed with narration inspired by the writings
of Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg.
   The Jewish boy from New York who learned to write
cowboy-inspired classical music didn't even travel to the West
until he was 28.
   ``I preferred to imagine being on a horse without actually
getting on one!'' he once said.
   William Schuman, who with Bernstein and Copland formed what
Schuman called a triumvirate of American composers, said, ``Copland
believed in the validity of American music, that we were not
inferior to our European cousins.''
   ``He created the American sound in symphonic music,'' said
Schuman.
   Both Bernstein and Copland ``wanted to incorporate popular music
into concert music. They always wanted the music to be in contact
with people,'' said composer Elliott Carter.
   Copland's storekeeper parents initially were reluctant to pay
for music lessons. ``My parents were of the opinion that enough
money had been invested in the musical training of the four older
children, with meager results,'' he recalled.
   But his persistence prevailed, and Copland eventually studied in
Paris with Nadia Boulanger and sold a composition, ``The Cat and
the Mouse,'' for $32.50.
   ``To finally see my music printed means more to me than any
debut in Carnegie Hall,'' he wrote home.
   In 1925, Boulanger, on organ, premiered ``Symphony for Organ and
Orchestra'' in New York as part of her U.S. debut.
   Afterward, Copland recalled, conductor Walter Damrosch addressed
the audience: ``Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you will agree that
if a gifted young man can write a symphony like this at 23 ...
within five years he will be ready to commit murder.''
   With such jazz-inspired creations as ``Piano Concerto'' in 1926,
Copland once recalled, ``I felt I had gone to the extreme of where
jazz could take me, the audiences and critics in Boston all thought
I had gone too far.''
   During a trip to the West, Copland heard the piece being hissed
during rehearsal and again in concert at the Hollywood Bowl.
   But he forged on, experimenting with even more complex rhythms.
   ``Symphonic Ode,'' which premiered in 1932, was so difficult
conductor Serge Koussevitzky told Copland it took an hour to
rehearse three bars.
   Then, in 1936, Copland did a musical about-turn - to a simpler,
folk-based style in ``El Salon Mexico,'' inspired by a visit to
Mexico City. The work was followed in 1942 by ``Rodeo,'' which
launched Agnes DeMille's dancing career.
   Copland, who never married, is survived by several nieces and
nephews.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.
