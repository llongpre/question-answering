   Gov. Garrey Carruthers has rejected a
writer's request that Billy the Kid be pardoned for his role in the
1878 shooting death of Sheriff William Brady.
   A letter is being prepared telling Las Cruces author Opal Lee
Priestley of the governor's decision, B.J. Wagner-Adam, the
governor's administrator of pardons and extraditions, said
Thursday. Ms. Priestley is the author of ``Billy the Kid: The Good
Side of a Bad Man.''
   Hundreds of living people have clemency cases pending with just
six months left in the Carruthers administration, said Ms.
Wagner-Adam said.
   She said a full investigation of all facts surrounding the case
would be impossible because it happened so long ago.
   ``There's such a volume of information out there and so much we
don't know,'' she said.
   The writer contended that the Kid was denied a fair trial.
   ``It was generally considered by those who attended the trial
that he got token representation, and it was a foregone conclusion
he would be found guilty,'' Ms. Priestley said. ``There was not
much doubt the cards were stacked against him.''
   He escaped after the trial, killing two Lincoln County deputies.
Ms. Priestley said perhaps hundreds of people knew where he was
after that but would not betray him for a $500 reward.
   ``And $500 in those days was a fortune,'' Ms. Priestley said.
   The Kid, whose real name was said to be William Bonney or Henry
McCarty, was shot to death in Fort Sumner, N.M., by Lincoln County
Sheriff Pat Garrett in 1881.
