<LEADPARA>  Watsonville desperado Brett Miller, who escaped from the Santa Cruz County
Jail last June, left his calling card in Healdsburg a few weeks later,
according to authorities.;    Miller, 26, whose lengthy rap sheet includes
charges of kidnapping, robbery, cattle-rustling and extortion,  apparently
tried to rob a bank in the Sonoma County town on July 30. The unsuccessful
holdup attempt closely resembled at least two other bank robbery schemes --
neither of which paid off -- hatched by Miller.  </LEADPARA>

ESCAPEE IDENTIFIED BY BANK EMPLOYEE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     According to Healdsburg police, Miller and another man broke into the
Security Pacific National Bank branch sometime during the night and were on
hand when the first employee arrived on July 30. The woman was confronted by a
man carrying a pistol, said Detective Kevin Young.;    Bank procedure calls
for the employee unlocking the bank to signal her fellow workers, waiting
outside in a parking lot, that everything inside is OK, said the detective.
But when Miller allowed the woman to go to the bank door, she waved --
signaling her co-workers that something was wrong.;    Two bandits escape from
police;    While another employee ran to a nearby telephone, a co- worker
pulled the woman from the bank, Young said. Meanwhile, the two bandits inside
fled through the back door and escaped from police, who arrived on the scene
about a minute later and began a search of the neighborhood.;    Miller's name
was linked to the attempted stickup in Healdsburg after the bank employee and
a police artist came up with a drawing of the man who had held a gun on her. A
San Luis Obispo County detective, who read a Teletype message about the failed
robbery attempt, sent a photo of Miller to Young.;    "The resemblance to the
man in the drawing was startling," Young said. He said the woman subsequently
identified Miller from a photo lineup.;    It was not Miller's first
successful attempt to elude the law.;    He has escaped from Santa Cruz County
Jail twice, most recently on June 14, when he and two other men, now back in
custody, scaled a 15-foot-high wall and tore down a chain-link fence before
vanishing. Another time, he fled from a sheriff's van at the courthouse annex
in Watsonville. As a youth, Miller escaped officers seeking to arrest him on
several warrants by fleeing into the Pajaro River.;    Modern-day Billy the
Kid;    Miller, who apparently fancies himself a modern-day Billy the Kid, was
being held on charges involving cattle-rustling and an attempted bank robbery
in Atascadero at the time of his most recent escape in Santa Cruz. He had been
apprehended near his trailer home in San Luis Obispo County after being fished
out of a cistern by deputies on his trail.;    They wanted him for the
kidnapping of a Templeton woman who was operations manager for the Bank of
America in Atascadero. According to authorities in San Luis Obispo, Miller was
suspected of taking bank keys from the woman, then freeing her in a remote
area. She walked to a nearby farmhouse and phoned the sheriff.;    The
cattle-rustling charges grew out of the thefts of calves in Merced and
Stanislaus counties. Young also said Miller is suspected of trying to sell
stolen cattle in Sonoma County.;    In a Watsonville case, Miller was
convicted after being charged with conspiring to kidnap the manager of a local
bank and of attempting to extort $500,000 from a prominent Pajaro Valley
family.  </TEXT>
