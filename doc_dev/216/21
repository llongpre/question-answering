<TEXT>     Tuesday night in Houston, Oberkfell was "the Kid," helping the Astros rob
Philadelphia of a 1-0 victory when he drew a bases-loaded walk from Roger
McDowell in the 11th inning.;    Craig Biggio struck out to start the 11th,
but Ken Caminiti and Jeff Bagwell followed with singles and Steve Finley was
intentionally walked by McDowell.;    "I was going to make him throw me a
strike," Oberkfell said.;    McDowell walked him on four pitches.;    Houston
had left the bases loaded in the 10th when Casey Candaele took a called third
strike from McDowell.;    It was the Phillies' third loss in a row and their
eighth in 11 games.;  REDS 6, EXPOS 1: Chris Sabo had two doubles and drove in
two runs as Cincinnati won in Montreal.;    The Reds scored two runs in the
fourth with some help from the Expos. Billy Hatcher was on third and Sabo on
second when Glenn Braggs hit an infield single that second baseman Junior
Noboa threw away. Both runners scored.;    The Reds added four runs in the
fifth, sparked by Norm Charlton's leadoff double and Paul O'Neill's two-out
RBI double.;    Reds center fielder Eric Davis left the game with a pulled
right-thigh muscle in the first inning. He was listed as day-to-day.; 
CARDINALS 10, PADRES 4: Milt Thompson's three RBIs helped St. Louis win in San
Diego.;    The Cardinals homered twice in one inning for the first time this
season. Thompson hit a two-run homer and Gerald Perry added a solo shot in the
sixth.;    San Diego's Fred McGriff hit his league-leading 14th home run, a
three-run shot.;  METS 2, BRAVES 1: Kevin McReynolds hit a two-run homer as
host New York beat Atlanta.;  ETC.: Los Angeles' game at Pittsburgh was rained
out and will be made up as part of a twi-night doubleheader Sept. 6.  </TEXT>
