   Elizabeth Taylor, looking regal in a
black sequin gown and smiling broadly during an all-star tribute for
her philanthropic work, called on others to support the needy.
   ``As human beings we must strive to remember that we are all
human beings. We must give of ourselves a compassion, a commitment
and our love,'' said the actress who has raised $14 million for
various charities.
   Miss Taylor, who turns 57 Monday, received America's Hope Award
during a tribute and roast Thursday at the Bob Hope Cultural Center
in Palm Desert, an affluent desert resort 120 miles east of Los
Angeles.
   The tribute was taped for an hour-long ABC special ``America's
All-Star Tribute to Elizabeth Taylor'' to be broadcast March 9.
   ``Elizabeth Taylor is one of the last in the genre known as a
real star,'' said Mickey Rooney, Miss Taylor's co-star in the 1945
movie classic ``National Velvet.'' ``There are few people today who
are stars.''

   Former CBS news correspondent Fred Graham
predicts that network nightly news programs will disappear by the
year 2000.
   ``Network evening news will not exist into the next century,'' he
told members of the Nashville chapter of the Society of Professional
Journalists.
   Graham, former Supreme Court correspondent for CBS, said Thursday
that networks will become more of a news service for local news
broadcasts. He blamed cable TV news, dwindling revenues and mounting
debts.
   Graham left CBS in 1987 to work for WKRN in Nashville.

   The Rev. Timothy Healy, a native New Yorker who
led Georgetown University for 13 years as its president, will become
the next head of the New York Public Library.
   The library board of trustees elected Healy as president and
chief executive officer at a special meeting Thursday. He succeeds
Vartan Gregorian, who is leaving to become president of Brown
University.
   The 65-year-old Healy is expected to take the post in the summer,
said library spokeswoman Lauren Moye.
   ``It's home,'' Healy, a Jesuit priest, told The New York Times
when asked on Thursday why he was taking the job.
   ``I grew up in this town,'' added Healy, who once had a summer
job reshelving books at the main library on Fifth Avenue at 42nd
Street.
   The New York Public Library bills itself as one of the five
greatest research libraries in the world. Each year, 1.3 million
people visit its four research and 81 branch libraries.

   Former major league baseball manager
Billy Martin, whose career has been colored by repeated
controversies, will make his stage debut this weekend as what else _
the bad guy.
   On Saturday, Martin will tell the story of famous outlaw Billy
the Kid while the Binghamton Symphony Orchestra performs Aaron
Copland's ``Billy the Kid Suite.'' It's part of a performance called
``Bernstein, Broadway and Billy.''
   ``You can see the great connection,'' said conductor John
Covelli. ``Billy doing Billy.''
   The former New York Yankees skipper purchased a farm in nearby
Fenton last September after developing an affection for the hilly
and forested region near the Pennsylvania border.
   ``It's kind of our welcome to him and his way of saying hello
back,'' said Nancy Marshall, the symphony's executive director.
   Martin has been fired as Yankees manager five times in a
revolving-door relationship with team owner George Steinbrenner.

   Country western singer Kenny Rogers has
received a humanitarian award from the National Association for
Campus Activities for helping hungry people.
   Rogers received the Harry Chapin Award for Contributions to
Humanity. The award, presented Wednesday, is named for the late
singer.
   Rogers has donated concert proceeds to hunger organizations and
supported charitable efforts such as USA for Africa and Hands Across
America.
   ``Few people in their lifetimes are in a position to do a lot of
good with little time invested. I'm one at this point. I feel like
it's almost blasphemous not to do it on a cause that is this
important,'' said Rogers, who is known for hits such as ``The
Gambler.''
