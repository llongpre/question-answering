<LEADPARA>  AT 48, Billy Kidd is one of the premier ski instructors in the country. His
clientele in Steamboat Springs, Colo., has ranged from former rodeo star Larry
Mahan to Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca.;   Kidd, silver medalist in the men's
slalom in the 1964 Winter Olympics, took time recently to give some
suggestions on how skiers can improve.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  KIDD OFFERS HIS TOP 10 TIPS FOR BETTER SKIING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Venture -- Celebrating the Active Life  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Kidd's top 10 recommendations:;   1. Take lessons -- True, it might be
self-serving, but Kidd was steadfast. "Most people, intermediates or better,
think lessons are only for beginners," he said. "Well, Jack Nicklaus has his
coach, and so does Jimmy Connors. The top athletes all do. If you want to
improve, it's nice to read how in newspapers. But also take lessons.";   2.
Round off turns -- That's why Alberto Tomba and Marc Giardelli fly down the
hills, Kidd said. There's a lesson there for everyone. "The No. 1 way to
improve your skiing -- if you're a first-time skier or you're close to making
the U.S. ski team -- is to make rounder turns," Kidd said. "No matter how well
you ski now, you can still work on rounding out your turns. If you do that,
you use less energy, you're less likely to fall down, you carve turns
better.";   3. Think circular -- "Think of a turn as part of a circle," he
said. "As you go around the circle, put all your weight on your outside ski,
the one on the outside of the circle.";   4. Keep feet flexible -- Austrian
skiers in the 1950s kept their feet close together, but Frenchman Jean Claude
Killy punctuated the '60s with less-restrictive feet placement. "By keeping
your feet apart, and by getting all that weight on the outside ski, and by
purposely lifting the inside ski in order to do it -- all that makes you hold
much better on ice," Kidd said.;   5. Avoid too much shoulder rotation on
turns -- "When you (do that), you can't make the next turn back in a hurry
because you've locked up," Kidd said. "Watch good mogul or slalom skiers, who
have to make one turn every second for 60 seconds. They don't turn their
shoulders. It's too slow. So keep your shoulders facing straight downhill and
just turn your feet.";   6. Plant pole and turn -- "If you train yourself to
always start your turn with a pole plant, that's the physical and
psychological beginning of your turn," Kidd said. "Watch really good bump
(mogul) skiers. The way they time their turns is with the pole plant. You say,
'I want to start my turn here, and then you plant your pole. Then right here,
and you plant your pole. And here. And here.";   7. Be patient -- Meaning,
among other things, that you shouldn't rush your turns. "Most beginners and a
lot of intermediates rush their turns at the beginning," Kidd said. "Then you
make your skis skid, and you have trouble on ice, and you hit a frozen clump
of snow and you're upside down.";   8. Curtail upper-body movement -- "If you
want to turn quicker, try to keep your upper body very quiet, so you use your
skis and feet and knees to turn your skis," Kidd said. "As an intermediate
skier, if you want to keep your balance better, and keep your upper body
quiet, keep your hands out to the side like a tightrope-walker.;   "If you
watch Franz Heinzer winning the gold medal in the Olympic downhill, he's
fighting to keep his hands out in front to decrease wind resistance. But when
the going really gets rough, when he's just thinking about survival, his hands
go right out for balance, just like a tightrope walker.";   9. Use knees to
edge on ice -- If you edge too much with your hips, down you go, Kidd said.
"If you put your skis on edge by rolling your knees over into the hill,
because of stiff boots your skis will go off on edge and you can hold on ice,"
he said. "If you do that, and your skis slip on the snow, you'll skid right
along with them, but you won't fall down.";   10. Simplify and enjoy -- "I try
to tell people to keep skiing really simple," Kidd said. "It isn't that
complicated, basically. You want to get down the hill without falling down.
That's what Franz Klammer wants to do.;   "To do that, keep it simple. Just
think about your hands and keeping them out to the side for balance. Keep them
forward and that'll help round your back and bend your knees. Start your turn
with a pole plant, and that's it."  </TEXT>
