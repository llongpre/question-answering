   It's a late-summer film festival for the
Sheen brothers, with Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen starring in
three films, including one together.
   The two sons of Martin Sheen co-star in Epic Productions' ``Men
at Work,'' which Emilio also wrote and directed. He repeats his
role as Billy the Kid in Fox's ``Young Guns II,'' and Charlie plays
a hot-shot commando in Orion's ``Navy SEALS.''
   Their father changed his name from Estevez to Sheen. Emilio
chose to use the family name in his career.
   The brothers are a strange pair for brothers. Estevez, 27, is
blond, with Spanish-looking features, reflective, serious; Sheen is
taller, dark, more impulsive. Are they truly brothers?
   ``As far as we know,'' said Charlie Sheen in a joint interview.
``But anything can happen.''
   ``I've seen baby pictures of us together,'' said Estevez. ``We
lived in the same house.''
   Who beat up on whom during their Malibu childhoods?
   ``I think we beat each other up pretty equally,'' Estevez said.
``Mine was more of a mental torture on Charlie; I terrorized and
teased him just about all the way around the world (they traveled
to their father's locations). Physical confrontations were few but
memorable.''
   ``Of the Ali-Foreman caliber,'' Sheen said.
   Sheen checked into a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center for
a month on Aug. 9. His publicist, Jeff Barnard said he was
suffering from extreme exhaustion from filming two movies
back-to-back.
   In ``Men at Work'' the brothers play a couple of garbagemen who
find a body in the trash and become involved in a plot of murder
and environmental poisoning. Estevez traces the film's beginnings
to a sleepless night at his Santa Monica apartment in 1984. Hearing
the trash truck outside his window, he started devising a script.
   The project stagnated at a studio for a year until Estevez could
rescue the script. Fifteen drafts later, he made the deal with
Epic. The budget was definitely not in the ``Die Hard 2'' category.
   ``We made it for what is considered by the studios a low-budget
standard,'' Estevez said.
   How low? About half of the industry average of $18 to $20
million.
   Such a budget doesn't allow for Charlie Sheen's $1 million-plus
salary. He dodged the issue: ``I don't like to discuss cash, but
they were very generous.''
   Four years ago, Estevez wrote, directed and starred in
``Wisdom,'' becoming the youngest to perform all three functions in
a major film. It failed to find an audience.
   ``If I learned anything on the first picture, it was to really
open myself up, to include everybody in a community effort,'' he
said. ``If Charlie has an idea or if the crafts-service guy has an
idea, they both come from a place of wanting to make the movie
better. I didn't approach it that I was paranoid and they wanted to
take my movie away from me.''
   ``Oh, he'd listen to me _ if it was a good idea,'' added Sheen.
``I came up with some stinkers now and then, and they didn't make
the movie. They all can't be winners.''
   Did the brothers work well together?
   ``Absolutely,'' assured Estevez. ``You get there on the set and
there's 100 people. They all have a job to do, you have a job to
do.''
   ``You had three jobs to do,'' said Sheen.
   ``Right,'' said Estevez. ``There really wasn't time for any
shenanigans.''
   ``That doesn't mean we didn't have a good time making this
thing,'' his brother said.
   ``We had a lot of laughs. It's tough, though, making a film. My
days were running 18-19-hours. A director maybe gets four or five
hours' sleep.''
   About ``Navy SEALS,'' Sheen commented: ``A long shoot, 16 weeks,
eight in Virginia Beach, the remaining eight in Spain. Very
physical picture. Very dangerous picture. But a lot of time, I had
a great time playing that role. I got to create some situations as
opposed to just reacting to them.''
   He also appeared in ``Young Guns'' but missed the sequel.
   ``We left Charlie back at Blazer's Mill, where the historical
figure was killed. So he didn't follow us,'' Estevez said.
   ``I had no concern about doing this sequel. I felt the second
half of the Billy the Kid story had been left blank, and I wanted
to fill it in. It's a great character for an actor to play.
   ``Also, Charlie's got a pretty good body count in the films he's
done. I had to catch up. He's got 32, and now I'm up to 16 or 17
confirmed kills. So I'm working on it.''
