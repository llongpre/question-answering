There were several good reasons for reading this book, one of which, to anyone 
with a love of the spice of life, is paramount: a first-rate recipe for "Basic 
Texas Red" chili. As Frederick Turner points out in his chapter, "A Lot Like It 
Hot," one must be careful to distinguish between chile, which is the pepper, 
and chili, which is the dish you make from chiles; that, however, is the least 
of the informative tidbits about chiles and chili that can be found here. 
</P>

Turner, whose book "Spirit of Place," published earlier this year, touched but 
briefly on the American West, here turns his attention completely to the spirit 
and place of that expanse whose peculiarities, stark drama and absence of 
visible boundaries altered the consciousness of so many of its immigrants. 
Mustangs, saguaros, the lives of cowboys and Indians (at least as seen by white 
eyes), the Gargantuan proportions of the Czech beseda in Deming, the Horatio 
Alger rise of the Basque sheepherders, cockfighting, Billy the Kid: One cannot 
say: "It's all here," because the legends are endless, but this is as good a 
place as you are likely to find from which to begin a revisitation of the 
American West. 
</P>
<P>
Of course there are changes from "the olden days." Government management (or 
mismanagement, which amounts to the same thing) has wrought ecological 
endangerment everywhere one cares to look. Nor has the situation been markedly 
improved by the well-meaning intervention of environmental groups, equally 
devoted to management though on terms somewhat different than those of the 
local ranchers and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
It would be too easy to devote an entire book to the disasters of a overly 
managed land; it would be too easy to ignore such things altogether also, and 
Turner does not skirt the issue in his essay on the plight of the mustangs. It 
is not an easy issue: The Bureau of Land Management was pretty clearly rendered 
absurd by the Reagan Administration, but the claims -- and worse, the methods 
-- of the environmentalist groups are equally open to criticism. The vast herds 
of wild horses that once roamed the West are severely diminished -- but were 
their huge numbers such a good thing for them? 
</P>
<P>
Government and special-interest groups are not the only instigators of change. 
Boosterism has sufficiently obscured enough of history to leave the story of 
Billy the Kid eternally ambiguous, and the American consciousness itself has 
suffered changes in the passage of time. The festival celebrating the Czech 
community in Deming, N.M. -- that has taken place for nearly 60 years -- may be 
seeing its last days as new generations lose interest in producing klobase, the 
Bohemian sausage of pork and beef that is the staple of the beseda. But the 
tourism that it inspires may be sufficient to keep the custom alive, though the 
intimacy of the earlier gatherings has long been forsaken. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Czechs, the Basques have witnessed change: The way of these remarkable 
sheepherders, who steadily extracted pasturage from the most unlikely places 
(such as the Great Basin of eastern Oregon), has eroded, but without much 
regret. That way was too lonely, too cut off from the mainstream to long 
survive. Yet there are some regrets: The decline of one way of life is seldom, 
if ever, isolated from the culture from which it sprang. When a generation 
begins to think in the language of its surrounding culture, the mind set of the 
mother tongue is doomed. 
</P>

Turner is at his best when writing about people, and his chapter, "Buying the 
West -- and Selling It: Two Versions," is clearly the best piece in the book. 
There he describes the quintessentially wild Western lives of two gifted 
adventurers: James Willard Schultz, who lived among the Blackfeet, marrying a 
Pikuni woman, and wrote "My Life as an Indian"; and the French-Canadian artist 
and writer Joseph-Ernest-Nephtali Dufault, who lived as a cowboy and was better 
known to us all as Will James, the author of "Smoky" and "Lone Cowboy." 
Schultz's and James' stories are as Western as sagebrush, and Turner serves 
them well with intimacy, simplicity and affection. Will James appears little 
known to younger generations, but to my own and that of my parents, his books 
and paintings made the Old West live. It is good to see him remembered so 
fondly. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's American vision is alive: We see through his words. He has found his 
voice, but it is still a question whether he has discovered what he needs to 
say with it. The West is a strongly delineated place in outward form, and this 
can sometimes produce a deceptive impression of depth in those who write about 
it. "Spirit of Place" was a fine book, and this is a good one too, but they are 
not the best that we could receive from Turner, given his abilities. A broad 
vision is not enough; it needs to go deeper.

Meanwhile, try the chili.
