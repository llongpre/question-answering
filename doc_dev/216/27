time at the St. James Hotel.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Twenty-six people died violently there in the late 1880s -- including five
people in one day, according to local legend. Bullet holes pock the dining
room ceiling. Records show that gunfights claimed the most victims, although
there were a few stabbings, too.;   The hallway upstairs is lined with the
pictures and names of famous Wild West figures who stayed at the St. James,
including Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, Bat Masterson, Tom "Black Jack" Ketchum,
Doc Holliday and Buffalo Bill Cody.;   Loree, a former co-owner, no longer
works here. But one night in 1986, she says, she showed Room 18 to Dr. Kenneth
Wright of Fresno and encountered a not-so-friendly ghost.;   "Swirling --
that's too gentle. He was raging," Wright, a gynecologist, said by telephone
from Fresno.;   "It came down at me and passed me on my right and I felt like
I was being struck at," Loree says. "I indeed fell to my knees. . . . I got
back up and at that point it came back at me and knocked me back to my knees
and went up to the corner (of the room) and continued spinning.";   Room 18,
closed to the public, is hardly bigger than a walk-in closet. It holds a dusty
oak bed frame without a mattress. Dozens of dead flies are scattered on a
window sill.;   "We've never had anybody sleep in here -- not with the things
that are going on," said owner-manager Ed Sitzberger.;   Sitzberger keeps
talking birds in the lobby of the 120-year-old hotel and 15 smaller birds in a
coffee shop aviary. He says two birds dropped dead after he showed Room 18 to
five people in 1987.;   Chefs and bartenders report that food and crockery
disappears from under their noses and glassware floats and shatters.;   The
most recent incident occurred last month, as three people came to the front
door. The first two got in, then the deadbolt snapped shut in front of the
third, Sitzberger says.;   Despite its lurid history, the St. James remains an
elegant territorial-style adobe landmark in this rustic northern New Mexico
village. "We have a Halloween party every year," says Sitzberger, who has
owned the place since 1985. "We have a costume contest . . . and we scare the
kids to death" in the hotel's "haunted hallway.";   The Lodge in Cloudcroft,
200 miles south of Albuquerque, also sees its occupancy surge around
Halloween, thanks to a friendly apparition named Rebecca. In the early 1930s,
Rebecca, a chambermaid, was reportedly murdered there by a jealous boyfriend.;
  "We get a lot of unexplainable incidents -- telephones that ring . . . water
turning on at various times of the day and night," Lodge manager Catherine
Cullers says.;   And to those skeptics who say ringing telephones and dripping
faucets are not exactly inexplicable, Cullers responds: "We have a lot of
people who reportedly have woken up in the middle of the night and seen
Rebecca. She's red-headed, young, good looking and very nice. She never does
any bad things."  </TEXT>
