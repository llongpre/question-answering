Two attractive young Dance Theatre of Harlem soloists took over the charismatic 
principal roles in Arthur Mitchell's dance drama "John Henry" on Sunday 
afternoon at Pasadena Civic Auditorium. Each gave a likable performance that 
ultimately proved too soft to galvanize the masses in this saga of a 
steel-drivin' man and his indomitable wife.

More credible as lovers than leaders, both Hugues Magen (John Henry) and Lisa 
Attles (Polly Ann) looked their best in the slinky, hip-rolling mating duet. 
Elsewhere, Magen projected great dignity as the ultimate working-class hero, 
but he only approximated the heroic bravura of the solos defining the 
character's prowess and legendary domination over the steam drill. 
</P>

A delightful tease in her entrance solo, Attles always danced vivaciously but 
didn't achieve much depth or authority. Admittedly, Mitchell sweetens the 
character compared to some of the classic folk ballads (for instance, we never 
see her driving steel "like a man"). But the moment when she changes mourning 
into celebration should have more spiritual power than it did Sunday afternoon.

New casting for "Serenade" found Karen Brown intense but far from ideal in 
classical line as the fallen, abandoned ballerina, and Augustus van Heerden 
undistinguished as her first partner. However, Stephanie Dabney and Ronald 
Perry brought impressive technical suavity and emotional weight to the episode 
involving the "winged" woman and her "blind" consort. Cassandra Phifer danced 
capably as the leader in the apotheosis. 
</P>
<P>
In "Billy the Kid," Christina Johnson's limpid, serenely executed solos as the 
Sweetheart created implications more poignant than the ballet's scenario. 
Contrary to the synopsis, Billy can't be dreaming of a former sweetheart, for 
he never would have known this kind of woman. She's pure fantasy -- a mirage of 
the purity totally beyond his reach.LEWIS SEGAL
