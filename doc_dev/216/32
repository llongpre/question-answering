<LEADPARA>  Birds drop dead, things vanish, the deadbolt snaps shut on the front door,
glassware floats, and Pat Loree says she was knocked to her knees by the
"presence" in Room 18.;   It doesn't take a seer to see why Halloween's a busy
time at the St. James Hotel.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Twenty-six people died violently there in the late 1880s -- including five
people in one day, according to local legend. Bullet holes pock the dining
room ceiling. Records show that gunfights claimed the most victims, although a
few were stabbed.;   The hallway upstairs is lined with the pictures and names
of famous Wild West figures who stayed at the St. James, including Billy the
Kid, Pat Garrett, Bat Masterson, Tom "Black Jack" Ketchum, Doc Holliday and
Buffalo Bill Cody.;   Loree, a former co-owner, no longer works here. But one
night in 1986, she said, she showed Room 18 to Dr. Kenneth Wright of Fresno
and encountered a not-so-friendly ghost.;   "Swirling -- that's too gentle. He
was raging," Wright, a gynecologist, said by telephone from Fresno.;   "It
came down at me and passed me on my right, and I felt like I was being struck
at," Loree said. "I indeed fell to my knees. . . . I got back up, and at that
point it came back at me and knocked me back to my knees and went up to the
corner (of the room) and continued spinning.";   Room 18, closed to the
public, is hardly bigger than a walk-in closet. It holds a dusty oak bed frame
without a mattress. Dozens of dead flies are scattered on a windowsill.;  
"We've never had anybody sleep in here -- not with the things that are going
on," owner-manager Ed Sitzberger said.;   Sitzberger keeps talking birds in
the lobby of the 120-year-old hotel and 15 smaller birds in a coffee shop
aviary. He says two birds dropped dead after he showed Room 18 to five people
in 1987.;   Chefs and bartenders report that food and crockery disappears from
under their noses and glassware floats and shatters.;   The most recent
incident occurred last month, as three people came to the front door. The
first two got in, then the deadbolt snapped shut in front of the third,
Sitzberger says.;   Despite its lurid history, the St. James remains an
elegant territorial-style adobe landmark in this rustic northern New Mexico
village.  </TEXT>
