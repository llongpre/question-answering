MARTIN OUT OF CHARACTER AS 'BAD-BOY' IN 'ILLUMINATIONS'

Douglas Martin is a handsome and technically accomplished young dancer whose 
height and partnering prowess alone would justify his prominence during the 
current Joffrey Ballet season at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
However, casting him in the stellar "bad-boy" roles of the repertory -- first 
Billy the Kid last week and, on Sunday afternoon, the Rimbaud character in 
Frederick Ashton's "Illuminations" -- forces Martin way out of his depth as an 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
He works hard to conquer all the movement challenges and knows how to hold 
attention through sheer presence, but something fundamentally decent in his 
nature undercuts every attempt to seem venal. 
</P>
<P>
When he throws himself on top of the character called Profane Love (a rather 
aimlessly jittery Julie Janus), this Rimbaud arches his back all right, but it 
isn't sex, it's choreography. Significantly, Martin's best moment in the ballet 
is his disgusted final rejection of her. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Daniel Baudendistel in "Lacrymosa" on Sunday night, Martin broods 
superbly -- coming between Jodie Gates and Edward Stierle in a portrayal of the 
enigmatic man in black that suggests hidden depths. But, for now, both "Billy" 
and "Illuminations" are better served with other Joffrey casts. 
</P>
<P>
Several new "Cotillon" principals interacted well with previously reviewed 
artists on Sunday afternoon. Charlene Gehm made an elegant-unto-brittle 
Mistress of Ceremonies: perfect for a ballet with lots of secrets under the 
fancy-dress vivacity. Cameron Basden danced the Young Girl's friend with an 
effective, carefree attack. However, Janus looked strained and listless as the 
glamorous predator in the "Hand of Fate" pas de deux -- another Joffrey dancer 
who's no good at being bad. LEWIS SEGAL
