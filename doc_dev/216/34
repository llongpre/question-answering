   Videos reviewed this week: ``Young Guns,'' ``Five Corners,''
``Midnight Crossing.''
   
   ``Young Guns'' (Vestron Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated R)
   
   As almost everyone knows, William Bonney probably was as twisted
a psychopathic little geek as ever crawled out from under a rock.
   Adenoidal, visibly retarded, stumpy-legged and physically dirty,
Billy the Kid was glorified by the penny press of his day as a
clean-limbed, resolute pistol fighter who killed by the Code of the
West. My, how we've changed.
   ``Young Guns'' casts a twitchy Emilio Estevez as Billy, with
nattering sidekicks Kiefer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Casey
Siemasko, Lou Diamond Phillips and Dermot Mulroney. Terence Stamp
phones in his part as a smarmy British rancher and Jack Palance
plays Jack Palance, his bad-guy antagonist in New Mexico's Lincoln
County war of 1878.
   Guns roar. Ricochets whine. Sutherland murmurs. Estevez whines.
Palance smirks, having picked up another payday. Suffocatingly
directed by Christopher Cain, written by John Fusco, it makes you
want to run out and rent ``The Wild Bunch.''
   The movie's greatest moment is Brian Keith's cameo as a tough,
coarse, filthy bounty hunter who comes within an ace of blowing our
boy heroes off the planet. For a second the movie opens up and shows
signs of life.
   False alarm.

   ``Five Corners'' (Cannon Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)

   Writer John Patrick Shanley, who took viewers to the sweet
streets of Brooklyn in ``Moonstruck,'' moves to the mean streets of
the Bronx in 1964 with ``Five Corners.''
   Unlike ``Moonstruck,'' this 1988 movie was no hit.
   But both Shanley products have an appealing fairy-tale feel with
their roots squarely planted in the mundane.
   Jodie Foster is lovely as Linda, a tough young woman frightened
at the release of a man sent to prison for trying to rape her. John
Turturro is truly terrifying as Heinz, still obsessed with Linda.
Tim Robbins (``Bull Durham'') plays Harry, Linda's savior, who after
his policeman father is killed becomes profoundly affected by the
work and words of Martin Luther King Jr.
   The characters' paths cross in a neighborhood of violence and
poverty. Some escape into a private fantasy world, others by
leaving, like Harry who plans to go South to register black voters.
Heinz cannot escape, and Turturro makes you feel how penned in his
character feels.
   There are drugs and pointless vandalism, penguins in a fountain,
a St. Bernard named The Buddah, dark humor and, mostly, people just
trying to get by in a world that shouldn't be so tough.
   ``Five Corners'' is eccentric and engaging, and above all worth
watching. But the end is less than satisfying, as a world lacking in
peace and order is tied up a little too neatly by the credits.

   ``Midnight Crossing'' (MCA Home Entertainment. VHS-Beta, $89.98.
Rated R)
   
   Flashback: Castro is coming out of the Cuban highlands and
Batista's casino operators are moving their cash out of the country.
Somehow a bunch of U.S. Navy men get hold of $2 million of it and
stash it on this island, see?
   Cut to the present: Daniel J. Travanti was one of the sailors.
The other one who knew where the treasure is has died, so Travanti
wants to go back and get it. (Why did they wait 20 years? Good
question.)
   Travanti's wife, played by Faye Dunaway, is blind, sort of. (``I
specialized in eye diseases. So how did I get glaucoma?'' Good
question.)
   He charters the yacht of his suspiciously deceased shipmate's son
(John Laughlin), whose perky, pouty wife (Kim Cattrall) works in
Capt. Frank Furillo's insurance agency. (Why? Good question.)
   By this point you've sunk 45 minutes in this sucker and nothing's
happening.
   Wait a second! ... Hey, isn't this the perfect bunch to erupt in
jealousy, lust, murderous intrigue and pistols and spearguns and all
kinds of neat-o, bloodiness played out beneath a cruel, cruel
Caribbean sun? Good question!
   Travanti sleepwalks through his role. Dunaway is at her most
brittle, shrewish and shrill. The juve leads are bland as custard.
Phony tension, childish intrigue, unbelievably stupid plot tricks.
Worse, the venerable Ned Beatty is written into the plot _ and just
as quickly written out.
   How did all these clever, handsome people make this bad movie?
Good question.
