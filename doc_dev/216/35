   Bob Hope says he wrote about his life to beat his
kids to the job.
   ``Look what happened to Bing Crosby, Bette Davis, Joan
Crawford,'' he quipped at a bookstore here Tuesday while signing
copies of his autobiography, ``Don't Shoot, It's Only Me.''
   Hope, 87, wrote the book with Melville Shavelson, one of his
comedy writers since 1938.
   The legendary comedian says he does not worry about death.
   I've died many times _ in Philadelphia, Jersey City, you name
it. I generally don't feel anything until noon, then it's time for
my nap.''

   Magic Johnson helped Michigan State
University win a college basketball title 11 years ago. Now, he
would like to help run the school.
   Michigan Democratic Party officials suggested Johnson run for a
seat on the board of trustees for the East Lansing school.
   Johnson, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to five National
Basketball Assocaiton championships, said in a statement Tuesday
that he was ``very interested.''
   Johnson, 30, would return next week to his hometown of Lansing
to re-establish residency and register to vote, said Joel Ferguson,
a Democratic Party activist.
   To run for the board, Johnson must be a resident for at least 30
days and be nominated by the Democratic Party at its state
convention Sept. 8-9 in Flint.
   Gov. James Blanchard hopes Johnson's candidacy would attract
voters to the polls for the Nov. 6 election, in which Blanchard is
seeking his third term.

   Sonny Crockett shot bad guys by the score
on ``Miami Vice.'' Don Johnson, who portrayed the hip undercover TV
cop, says it's harder to shoot par amid scores of fans.
   More than a thousand fans swarmed the Country Club of Jackson on
Tuesday for a glimpse of the actor, who played in a pro-celebrity
golf tournament to benefit a local hospital. Organizers credited
him with doubling the size of the gallery to about 3,000.
   Pro golfer Kenny Perry, who was paired with Johnson, basked
happily in the actor's reflected glory.
   ``I didn't realize I had this many fans in Jackson,'' said Perry.

   Actor Emilio Estevez agrees the movie western
``Young Guns,'' dismissed by critics as a Brat Pack-on-horseback
charade, was a career misstep.
   So why the sequel ``Young Guns 2'' opening this week?
   ``I have been a fan of the western movies since I was a little
kid and I did `Young Guns' in the hope that it would help bring
back the western,'' Estevez, 27, said in an interview this week.
   ``John Fusco wrote a magnificent script, but then it was turned
into what I call Hollywood's first heavy-metal western. It was just
an excuse for a personality piece featuring all these young actors,
and I was very disappointed.''
   Fusco also wrote the script for the sequel, but this time
there's a different director and a bigger scope, Estevez said.
   ``This one has a wide-screen look with a big, glorious musical
score, and the most accurate depiction of Billy the Kid of any film
ever made on him,'' he said.
   ``Young Guns 2'' is the 43rd movie about the legendary gunman.

   Former comedian Dick Gregory has told a federal
court he can't afford to repay an old friend $105,000 because he
has other debts totaling more than $1 million.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Harrington ordered Gregory to submit
a financial affidavit by Friday.
   Gregory, 58, of Plymouth, borrowed $40,000 in 1979 from Frank
Nicholas II. Nicholas sued Gregory in 1987 to recover the loan plus
interest, bringing the debt to $105,000.
   Nicholas urged the court to find Gregory in contempt. However,
Gregory said in court Monday that he can't repay the debt because
he also owes more than $1.2 million to the Internal Revenue
Service, American Express, banks and other creditors.
