   Tarnation, thar's Bat and Wyatt and young
Maverick and The Rifleman's son and a whole passel of Western stars
on the two-hour season premiere of ``Paradise'' on CBS.
   ``I was very excited about playing Bat Masterson again after 25
years,'' said Gene Barry, who comes to the rescue of Ethan Allen
Cord (Lee Horsley) with Hugh O'Brian returning as Wyatt Earp.
   The two-hour show on Sunday is a roundup of old Western stars.
Barry played the cane-carrying dandy in NBC's ``Bat Masterson'' from
1959 to '61. O'Brian was the Dodge City marshal on ABC's ``The Life
and Legend of Wyatt Earp'' from 1955 to '61.
   The Western also stars Jack Elam of ABC's ``The Dakotas'' in 1963
and NBC's ``Temple Houston'' in 1963-64; Johnny Crawford, who was
Mark McCain on ABC's ``The Rifleman'' from 1958 to '63; Charles
Frank, who was on CBS' ``The Chisholms'' in 1979 and CBS' ``Young
Maverick'' in 1979-80; and Charles Napier of NBC's ``The Oregon
Trail'' in 1977 and CBS' ``The Outlaws'' in 1986-87.
   The cast gives new meaning to Old West. The exception is John
Schneider of ``The Dukes of Hazzard.'' He's along for the ride by
horse instead of gravel-spraying roadster, playing Sheriff Pat
Garrett, the man who killed Billy the Kid.
   In ``Paradise,'' the ``over the hill gang'' comes to the rescue
after Horsley is thrown into jail on trumped-up murder charges.
   ``We're a little clumsy at what we did so well 30 years ago,''
says Barry, 67. ``I hope to see it come off because there could be a
future in Bat and Earp. It's a love-hate relationship, like between
Quirt and Flagg in `What Price Glory.' Two old guys who fight and
carry on. I've always felt there's a movie in it.''
   Although Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp both operated in Dodge
City, the twain never met on television, since they were on
different networks.
   ``I would have had him on my show,'' Barry said. ``He had his own
Bat Masterson. But he guarded his show with his Buntline Special.''
   Barry also stars in the NBC movie ``Repeat Performance,'' which
will be telecast in December.
   The movie, a remake of a 1947 film, stars Connie Sellecca as a
woman who kills her husband at midnight on New Year's Eve and
discovers she can relive the previous year. She knows what's ahead,
but can she change the climax?
   Barry plays her business manager, and the story is told through
his eyes.
   The remake Barry is pressing hardest for is ``Burke's Law,'' the
ABC series (1963-66) in which he played a millionaire homicide
detective who drove to the murder scene in a Rolls-Royce. He hopes
to see it turned into a series of movies similar to ``Perry Mason.''
   Barry also starred in ``Name of the Game,'' in rotation with
Robert Stack and Tony Franciosa on NBC from 1968 to '71.
   He recalled that when ``Bat Masterson'' first came up 30 years
ago he didn't want to do it.
   ``Then someone said he wore a derby hat and carried a cane,'' he
said. ``That appealed to the actor in me. If it hadn't been for that
I would have turned it down. I didn't want to be tied down doing a
Western. I went to wardrobe and found the hat and cane and an
elegant swallowtail coat and shiny black boots.
   ``I looked at myself in the mirror and I knew exactly how to play
this man. The costume dictated my performance. It changed my life.
Every role I've done since has been a guy who looked good in
clothes.''
   It was his stint on Broadway as Georges in ``La Cage aux Folles''
that he calls ``the highlight of my life.'' He was in New York for
three years and then spent another year on the road in the French
farce about a gay couple pretending to be straight for the sake of
Georges' son, his fiancee and her parents.
   ``When the role came up it wasn't a surprise because every year
I'd do a play or take off with my one-man musical revue, `Gene Barry
In One,''' he said. ``I'd try to get back to New York for a musical
now and then. That was my `Repeat Performance.' That's where I
started, on the musical stage.''
