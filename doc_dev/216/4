   A retired historian-author who has been
trying to prove that a Texan who died in 1950 was really Billy the
Kid said he'd like to see the identity decided by a federal court.
   William A. Tunstill said a recent photographic study comparing a
tintype of Billy the Kid and pictures of Ollie L. ``Brushy Bill''
Roberts failed to put the isue to rest.
   The study, part of a broader study undertaken by the Lincoln
County Historical Trust, concluded 41 other people in the
comparison looked more like Billy the Kid than ``Brushy Bill'' did.
   Roberts, who died in Hico, Texas, a week shy of his 90th
birthday in December 1950, had claimed to be the legendary New
Mexico outlaw. Most people, including a coroner's jury of the time,
say Sheriff Pat Garrett shot Billy the Kid to death in Fort Sumner,
N.M., on July 14, 1881.
   ``Brushy Bill died a Christian, but I'm not sure of those who
accuse him (of lying),'' Tunstill said.
