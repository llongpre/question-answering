   Audrey Hepburn's recital from the diary of
Anne Frank gave a wondrous glimpse into the young Holocaust
victim's ``hopes, her youthful dreams, her reality,'' composer
Michael Tilson Thomas said.
   The 60-year-old actress, who is goodwill ambassador for the
United Nation's Children's Fund, read from the diary in the first
of four ``Concerts for Life'' Monday night to benefit the world's
needy children.
   The diary chronicled the Jewish girl's feelings as she and her
family hid from the Nazis for two years in the attic of an
Amsterdam office building. Published in 1947, it later was made
into a play and then a movie. Miss Hepburn turned down both roles,
saying they were too emotional upsetting.
   ``I couldn't deal with it, I could not exploit her,'' said Miss
Hepburn, who lived in Holland during World War II and was the same
age as Anne Frank.
   Miss Hepburn finally relented by collaborating on Thomas'
musical tribute, ``From the Diary of Anne Frank,'' which premiered
before an emotionally charged audience of 2,400 at the Academy of
Music.
   ``This is certainly one of the best experiences of my life,''
Miss Hepburn said. ``The words of Anne Frank have lived this long;
and in this music, they will live forever.''
   ``It was as if you were listening to Anne Frank, her hopes, her
youthful dreams, her reality,'' Thomas told reporters.
   Other concerts are planned for Wednesday in Chicago, Friday in
Houson and Sunday at the United Nations.

   Lou Diamond Phillips has been released
from the hospital where he was treated for a broken arm. The actor
suffered the injury after being thrown and dragged by a horse on
the movie set of ``Young Guns 2.'' The Philippines-born actor
received at least 20 floral arrangements, dozens of get-well cards
and phone calls from fans during his weekend stay at University of
New Mexico Hospital.
   Spokeswoman Gail Sutton said Phillips, 28, left the hospital
Monday evening. A gunshot startled the horse Phillips was riding
Friday on a movie set near Galisteo, 20 miles from Santa Fe. His
fractured right arm required 2{ hours of surgery.
   Phillips, best known for his roles as singer Ritchie Valens in
``La Bamba'' and as a defiant math student in ``Stand and
Deliver,'' was returning home Tuesday to Los Angeles, said his
publicist, Eddie Michaels.
   Ms. Sutton said telephone calls to Phillips were carefully
screened, but a few who falsely claimed to be relatives got
through. ``A couple of little kids dropped off cards,'' she said.
   Phillips is playing Jose Chavez y Chavez, a friend of Billy the
Kid, in the ``Young Guns'' movies. Emilio Estevez plays the Kid.

   A judge ordered Billy Barty to pay one of his
former writers $1,300, and the diminutive actor was jubilant.
   The 65-year-old Barty, who has starred in such films as
``Rumpelstiltskin'' and ``Willow,'' said he was happy with Monday's
ruling because he didn't have to award 10 percent of future
syndication profits for his show ``Short Ribbs'' to writer-producer
Bill Winckler.
   ``It went fine, it went very good, I was very pleased at the
judge's decision,'' Barty said being ordered to pay Winckler $1,300
in disputed salary and $28 in court costs.
   Barty said the publicity hadn't hurt his career.
   ``This has gotten about as much publicity as Zsa Zsa and I
didn't even slap anybody,'' he said. ``But I wouldn't slap anybody.
I'd hit them in the knee.''
   Winckler, who sued Barty in small claims court for $2,000, said
he also was satisfied.
   ``I would have liked to have had my 10 percent of the show, too,
but I'm not overly upset about it because I don't know how
marketable the show is now,'' he said.
   Thirteen episodes of ``Short Ribbs,'' described as a ``Saturday
Night Live'' for ``Little People,'' were televised last fall on
Orange County-based cable station KDOC.
   Winckler, a writer for television cartoons, said he agreed to
the relatively paltry fee of $100 per episode because he figured he
stood to make a good deal more with 10 percent of the syndication
fee. But he said Barty wouldn't pay him anything after the two fell
out over creative differences.

   Bill Demby, a Vietnam War veteran who lost
both legs in a rocket attack in 1971, tells youngsters that his
disabilities don't stop him from enjoying life to the full.
   The former army private features in a television commercial by
Du Pont, which manufactures a plastic used in his artificial legs.
He travels around the country, often to cities with Du Pont plants,
to offer hard-earned advice to high school students.
   ``I hope kids can find something in my story that will help them
out when times get hard,'' he said during a visit Monday to Omaha
Northwest High School. ``Maybe when they see my life, they'll
realize that they're not so bad off.''
   Demby said he cannot run as fast as before, nor can he jump as
high.
   ``But I get out there and play,'' he said, ``and if you give me
half a chance, I'll burn the nets off you.''
   After returning from the war, Demby said he fell into a cycle of
drug and alcohol abuse until, one night in a bar, a friend told him
``You don't need this.'' Since then, Demby said, he has made a
slow, steady recovery.
   ``Sometimes you've just got to kick yourself in the rear and get
going,'' he said.
