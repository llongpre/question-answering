   The American Museum of Natural History has
decided that three heads are better than one when it comes to
dinosaurs.
   The museum has revised its opinion of what the head of an
apatosaurus _ commonly known as a brontosaurus _ looked like.
   But because the museum's 17-foot-tall, 66-foot-long apatosaurus
skeleton was assembled in 1905 and contains bones that are 140
million years old, it was too fragile to withstand a head transplant.
   So the museum has created an exhibit featuring three heads. One
is a copy of the head now on the apatosaurus skeleton, another is a
model that scientists now believe more closely resembles the
apatosaurus' real head, and the third is the head of a close
relative of the extinct beast.
   ``We may have to change our minds again once we find a skeleton
with a skull attached, but we think this is the most likely guess
based on the available evidence until we actually find a complete
skeleton with a skull attached,'' said Lowell Dingus, exhibit
coordinator.
   No one has ever found an apatosaurus skeleton with a skull
attached. The skull created for the 1905 model skeleton was based on
that of a dinosaur believed to be close kin, a camarasaurus.
   Since then, paleontologists have changed their minds about the
apatosaurus' likely relatives. A paper published in 1978 argued that
the diplodocus was a closer kin than the camarasaurus, implying the
apatosaurus had a longer, sleeker head than had been believed.
   When the museum tried to behead its apatosaurus in preparation
for a new skull, ``it sent vibrations down the skeleton and a couple
of the ribs fell off and broke,'' Dingus said.

   A 7-year-old who can't get enough baseball
figured a way to get neighborhood kids to come out to his local
sandlot. He bribed them with soda pop.
   ``I like baseball a lot,'' Billy Green said Tuesday. ``I played
little league for Bartonville `Little Dream Hut' this summer. But
the season's over now. I didn't have anyone to play with.''
   He tried to interest some ``big kids'' in a game, but they turned
him down because they considered him too small.
   Not to be deterred in his quest for one last game before he
enters third grade Aug. 24, Billy decided to up his offer.
   With the help of his 10-year-old sister, Angie, Billy passed out
hand-lettered fliers: ``Baseball Game, Held By Billy Green at
Pleasant Vallay School, Friday, Aug. 11, 1989. 3:00.''
   The key to the flier was the fine print at the bottom: ``Water
and cups supplied. Also Coke, 7-Up and Root Beer. Bring your bats,
gloves and balls!''
   Billy stuck fliers under doors in the neighborhood, and got more
than a dozen boys and girls ages 7 to 14 to turn out.
   ``Some of the big kids are kind of lazy,'' Angie said. ``You kind
of need a bribe to get them to play.''
   The game had a story-book ending as well. Billy doubled and his
team won, 5-1.

   Southfork Ranch can claim a real Ewing now.
   Cheryl Lee McClanahan gave birth to the first baby born at the
ranch on Sunday. So she decided to make a concession in naming her
10-pound baby boy: Tory Lee Ewing Crick.
   ``We couldn't fit in J.R.,'' Ms. McClanahan said.
   The Dallas woman was a week away from her expected delivery date,
but she decided to accompany her fiance, Chase Crick, to the ranch
just east of Parker. Crick had won a two-day stay at the ranch,
where exterior scenes for the ``Dallas'' television series are shot.
   When she realized she was about to give birth, she called a
midwife who helped her deliver the child.
