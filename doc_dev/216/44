   After captivating audiences in the Soviet Union
with its magical retelling of the ``Firebird'' and other ballets,
the Dance Theater of Harlem has returned home as part of the First
New York International Festival of the Arts.
   The 20-year-old company opened Tuesday night at City Center
Theater with the world premiere of Arthur Mitchell's ``John
Henry.'' Using various versions of the American folk tune by the
same name, and traditional gospel hymns and spirituals, the dance
retells the legend of the ``steel-drivin' man'' and the times in
which he lived.
   As artistic director and co-founder of the youthful dance
company, Mitchell has staged an energetic dance that utilizes
modern ballet moves and steps with a folk flavor _ there's even a
Texas two-step thrown in.
   Eddie J. Shellman, whose barrel turns and leaps have made him a
stand-out in the company, portrays John Henry. He is a strong
dancer, whose forcefulness does not obliterate his grace. He is
partnered well with Yvonne Hall, who dances the part of John
Henry's perky girlfriend.
   Theara Ward, a young dancer who has a wonderful technical
astuteness in neoclassical ballets, stretches her style as John
Henry's mother. Her moves, though sustained, are nevertheless in
the folk tradition. Lowell Smith is the father.
   Mitchell has placed his musicians, singer and conductor on
stage, which is just fine and supports the folkiness of the piece.
However, when he adds youngsters who gather around to hear Leon
Bibbs sing the legend of John Henry, the stage becomes somewhat
cluttered and some of the dancers and moves are hidden.
   The Dance Theater of Harlem prides itself on preserving American
dance repertory, and does an excellent job of presenting works that
otherwise would disappear because they are not performed. The
company also is good at demonstrating a variety of styles and moods
from the classical ``Swan Lake'' to the neoclassical ``Serenade''
to the contemporary and ethnic ``Dougla.''
   ``John Henry'' is a good addition to the company's repertory,
but it is not necessarily one of its strongest works.
   ``John Henry'' was commissioned by the arts festival, and
Mitchell said it was a tribute to actor-singer-writer Paul Robeson,
``who was a kind of American folk hero, and to John Henry who is an
Amercan folk hero.''
   The company also performed Eugene Loring's ``Billy the Kid,''
with music by Aaron Copland, and the very lyrical ``Serenade,'' a
work choreographed by the late George Ballanchine in 1934 to
Tchaikovsky's ``Serenade for Strings.'' It was the first work
created by the great ballet master in America.
   Mitchell was a principal dancer with Balanchine's New York City
Ballet.
   The company last appeared at City Center in 1984 and made its
Metropolitan Opera House debut in 1985. It toured in Moscow,
Leningrad and Tbilisi, the home of Ballanchine's brother, Andrei
Balanchivadze, in May and June.
   The Dance Theater of Harlem performs at City Center through July
3. The second program includes Michel Fokine's ``Polovetsian Dances
From `Prince Igor,''' originally created for the second act of
Borodin's opera; Valerie Beattis' ``Streetcar Named Desire''; and
John Taras' stunning ``Firebird,'' set to the original Igor
Stravinsky score.
