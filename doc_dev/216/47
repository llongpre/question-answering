   When they found 11-year-old Billy Ruff
hanged from the big maple tree he loved to climb, innocence died in
the hearts of his brothers and sisters.
   They saw his killer everywhere, in anyone. The surviving Ruff
children _ five living when Billy died 33 years ago, three born
later _ lived with a fear so deep it darkened every waking moment,
terror inspired by a real-life bogeyman who preyed on happy,
fresh-faced kids who loved raisin cookies and baseball.
   Kids like Billy. Kids like them.
   ``All of us, at one time or another, didn't think we'd reach the
age of 11,'' said Tim Ruff, who was 3 when Billy died.
   Then one day three years ago, Christopher Ruff glanced up at the
bulletin board in the police station where he worked and into the
face of the man who killed the brother he never knew.
   ``Mom and I knew, as soon as I called her,'' said Chris, at 24
the youngest Ruff, born eight years after his brother's death and
two months after his father's. ``We both started to shake and say,
`This is it.'''
   Last Monday, he saw the man again _ in Albany County Court,
where he was sentenced to life in prison for Billy's murder.
   It was not murder, however, that put Billy's killer on a wanted
poster; it was a sex abuse charge involving a girl about Billy's
age. The awful secret his family had hidden was that Billy Ruff had
been sodomized before he died.
   ``This sort of thing wasn't spoken about,'' Mildred Ruff said,
sitting in her living room surrounded by six of her children.
``People wouldn't talk about child molesting. It was a hush-hush
thing.''
   Smith Avenue, in the northwestern suburb of Albany where the
family lived, was a street full of children in a rural landscape of
fields and trees the day Billy Ruff disappeared.
   He was last seen at 4:30 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 31, 1957, his
pocket full of raisin cookies, in his hand a length of frayed
clothesline he planned to use to steer a homemade go-cart.
   He didn't show up for dinner. Mrs. Ruff remembers wrapping his
plate of lamb chops, boiled potatoes and corn on the cob in wax
paper and putting it in the fridge. At 9 p.m., she called her
husband at work, and he began a search that lasted until dawn.
   In her fitful sleep that night, Mrs. Ruff had a dream or a
vision, she wasn't sure which: ``I saw Billy, on his knees, hanging
by a rope.''
   That's the way he was found the next day by a friend's daughter
_ hanged with his own clothesline in a densely wooded lot where all
the kids played, and played for years after.
   Police interviewed hundreds of people. ``They didn't care how
many hours they put in,'' said Raymond Rasmussen, one of the first
state police detectives put on the case. ``We got to feel very
close and very compassionate for the family and what they'd been
through.''
   What they could not know was that the killer was there, among
them; then, in the noise and confusion of grief and of police work,
he was gone.
   ``The night of the wake, a priest friend of ours said it may
take 20 years, but nobody can keep this thing to themselves,'' Mrs.
Ruff said. ``And I said, if it takes 20 days, I'll lose my mind.''
   Instead, she found strength and faith, enough to last her family
through Billy's death, the death of her husband eight years later,
and her own current fight with cancer. For years, she carried in
her apron pocket a rosary her husband had given her. The black
beads wore to brown from constant fingering.
   Twenty days became 20 months. The investigation died down. The
police stopped coming by with mug shots of child molesters.
   Seven years passed. The police came around one last time to tell
the family a forensics expert had decided Billy's death was
accidental. His family scoffed; they knew the truth would surface,
a belief that never wavered as 10 years became 20, then 30.
   ``We know what it's like to have a lot of unanswered
questions,'' said John, born four years after Billy's murder. ``But
in the back of our minds, there was always the hope.''
   There was also fear _ of the dark, of being alone, of getting
too close to people.
   ``Everybody grew up with a paranoia,'' Chris said. ``We couldn't
have a normal childhood because we were so damn scared. There's not
one time we can walk into an empty house and feel safe. Not one of
us.''
   Regina, the oldest, 13 when Billy died, and Tommy, who was 5,
told their mother they knew there was a bogeyman because he got
their brother. All the Ruffs _ Regina, Tom, Tim, Joe, Lisa, Jay,
John and Chris _ worried he was out to get another of them.
   ``We'd stand at the window, stand there and watch when people
weren't home on time,'' said Lisa, who was 8 months old when Billy
was murdered. ``I remember standing at my bed in the back bedroom,
looking out the window and knowing I was doing the same thing as
Mom was. We were always scared.''
   The fear became something they lived and breathed. In time, they
would pass it on to their spouses, to their children.
   ``I was terrorized by nightmares most of my life,'' Regina wrote
in a recent letter to her mother. ``I had to force myself to go
anywhere. I was afraid of the dark and of the daylight.
   ``All this destruction, all this fear _ and I am only one of
eight. Multiply the damage to me by every other life this touched.''
   While Billy's brothers and sisters struggled with demons, his
killer was finishing a stint in the Air Force and spending short
periods as an Albany police officer and an ironworker. He married
three times and fathered two children by a fourth woman. In the
1970s he wandered the streets, a homeless alcoholic.
   ``I think he was a man that had this on his mind all that
time,'' Rasmussen said. ``Maybe that caused him to become what he
was.''
