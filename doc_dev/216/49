   ``Ghost,'' the Patrick Swayze thriller, has
proved a strong presence at the box office, landing in first place
for the third time.
   Not even ``Dick Tracy'' or ``Die Hard 2: Die Harder'' has been
No. 1 for more than two weeks during a summer that has failed to
produce a blockbuster.
   ``No one would have picked `Ghost' as a top summer picture,''
said John Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co. ``But there it is.''
   ``Ghost,'' about the return of a murdered man's spirit to
protect his lover and solve his own slaying, also stars Demi Moore
and Whoopi Goldberg. It took in $10.2 million at the box office
last weekend.
   ``Presumed Innocent,'' the Harrison Ford courtroom drama about a
prosecutor charged with murdering a former lover, earned $10.1
million and traded places with ``Ghost'' after bumping it from
first place the week before.
   In third with $8 million was the debut of ``Young Guns II,'' a
sequel starring Lou Diamond Phillips, Emilio Estevez, Kiefer
Sutherland and Christian Slater. It is a retelling of the fight
between Billy the Kid and lawman Pat Garrett.
   ``Problem Child,'' despite universally bad reviews, remained in
the top five for its second week, delivering $6.8 million in ticket
sales.
   In fifth place was creepy-crawly ``Arachnophobia,'' capturing
$5.9 million.
   ``Die Hard 2: Die Harder'' sixth with $4.8 million.
   Director Spike Lee's ``Mo' Better Blues'' opened in limited
release and sold $4.3 million in tickets for seventh place. The
movie stars Denzel Washington as a jazz trumpeter playing notes
when not pursuing two women.
   Gone from the top 10 were two of the most touted movies of the
summer, ``Days of Thunder'' and ``Dick Tracy,'' which earned
slightly over $1 million, enough to put it in the six-digit
category with $101 million in earnings over eight weeks.
   ``Days'' earned $2.6 million, and with a total of $73.7 million,
seems hard-pressed to pass the $100 million mark.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
