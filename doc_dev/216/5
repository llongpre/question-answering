   Val Kilmer is well aware that he's part of a
long line of actors who have played the legendary outlaw Billy the
Kid.
   ``I think even James Cagney played him,'' said Kilmer.
   Actually, Cagney is one of the few who never played Billy the
Kid. Cagney was in ``The Oklahoma Kid,'' ``The Frisco Kid'' and
``The St. Louis Kid,'' but he never played Billy the Kid.
   Kilmer, best-known for his roles as Madmartigan in the George
Lucas myth-fantasy ``Willow'' and as the hotshot pilot Iceman in
the Tom Cruise hit ``Top Gun,'' turns in an intriguing performance
as William H. Bonney in the new Turner Network Telvision cable
movie ``Gore Vidal's Billy the Kid,'' premiering Wednesday.
   This latest retelling of the events of the Lincoln County war in
the New Mexico Territory and Billy's slaying at the age of 21 by
Sheriff Pat Garrett in 1881 is Vidal's attempt to make good on the
skewed vision of Bonney contained in the 1958 film ``The Left
Handed Gun.'' Based on a teleplay by Vidal, it starred Paul Newman.
   Others who have played Billy the Kid include Johnny Mack Brown,
Roy Rogers, Robert Taylor, Audie Murphy, Bob Steele, Buster Crabbe,
Kris Kristofferson, and Jack Buetel in ``The Outlaw,'' which
shocked in 1943 because of Jane Russell's cleavage. Most recently,
Bonney was played by Emilio Estevez in ``Young Guns.''
   ``Most writers find their finds in other mythical renditions of
the subject,'' said Kilmer. ``Gore is quite passionate about this.
He got squeezed out as producer of `The Left Handed Gun.' Actually,
Billy used both hands.
   ``I have a special interest, too, because my grandfather came
from Tennessee to mine gold in New Mexico when Lincoln County was
still wild. Once five men rode up to their mine, and my
grandfather's friends opened fire and killed them all.''
   If the new film doesn't beatify Billy, it does portray him as
immensely sympathetic. His story has been open to many
interpretations. Bonney's legend began when he was still alive and
was idolized as the epitome of the Western hero. Others considered
him a common cattle thief and psychopathic killer.
   Canadian Duncan Regehr plays Pat Garrett. The movie also stars
Wilford Brimley as New Mexico's territorial governor, Lew Wallace,
Ned Vaughn and Patrick Massett as Billy's young gang members, Julie
Carmen as his love interest and Michael Parks as a corrupt
prosecutor. Rene Auberjonois (``Benson'') has an offbeat role as a
poet-drunkard who shows up occasionally to comment on the tragedy
of Billy's life.
   ``What Billy represented and the reason for Gore's passion for
the character is that he had a force and a spirit that articulated
very dramatically that part of our history,'' said Kilmer. ``The
view of Billy as a psychopath is a prejudicial account based on Pat
Garrett's book.
   ``Billy was intelligent. He read history. His myth was very
powerful during his own life. You'd have to look at today's rock
stars for a comparison to the idolization he enjoyed. Pat Garrett
represented progress. Billy didn't want things to change, but he
did stand for something. He only became an outlaw, because they
tricked him into believing he would get amnesty (for the revenge
killing of a sheriff) from Gov. Wallace. Billy had a legitimate
cause.''
   Kilmer said he ``prayed real hard'' for the role, having been
disappointed when he missed out on the part in ``Young Guns.''
   ``Billy represents one man fighting alone. He was passionately
loyal to his friends and unrelenting against his enemies,'' he said.
   Kilmer is currently filming ``Kill Me Again'' in Nevada with his
wife, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, who plays Christine Keeler in
``Scandal.''
   Like his cousin, the late Joyce Kilmer, famous for the poem
``Trees,'' Kilmer also writes poetry.
   ``I had a book of poetry published last year,'' he said. ``I
have a lap-top computer and I was compiling it and writing it in my
trailer during `Willow.' I'd write while I was in my muddy armor.''
