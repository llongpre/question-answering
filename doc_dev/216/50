<LEADPARA>  WHY IS CITIZEN KANE CONSIDERED the greatest film of all time?;    PERHAPS THE
REASON IS NOT SO MUCH the film itself as the magnificent, astonishing way that
it was made: A young man arrives in Hollywood, having never worked in film at
any length, and immediately co-writes, directs, produces and stars in a
masterpiece.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     They don't make Orson Welleses anymore. Welles was a prodigy. At the age of
10 he gave public lectures on the history of art. At 23 he was one of the most
famous radio personalities and actors in the country, making the cover of Time
after the notorious War of the Worlds broadcast in 1938. Welles produced
Citizen Kane in 1941. Some reasons for the film's greatness:;    1. "It is one
of the few films ever made inside a major studio in the United States in
freedom -- not merely in freedom from interference but in freedom from the
routine methods of experienced directors," writes Pauline Kael in The Citizen
Kane Book.;    2. There's nothing stuffy about it. Early on, we see the neon
sign of the El Rancho cabaret, and then we slowly travel across the
dilapidated roof and pass down through the skylight to the interior, where the
boozing Susan Alexander Kane is talking to a reporter. Later, the shot is
repeated in the same order, but this time when we reach the skylight we see
that it is broken -- by the camera, presumably. It's a gag!;    3. The movie
is a devastating portrait of a powerful person, William Randolph Hearst, the
tycoon of yellow journalism, who almost managed to stop the film's release.
Welles never again was given carte blanche to make a film. He exiled himself
to Europe and, despite a few triumphs such as Touch of Evil, eventually became
most famous as a funny fat man and a spokesman for Paul Masson Wine.;  GUESS
AGAIN; IF DANCES WITH WOLVES WINS THE OSCAR FOR best picture, it will be the
first Western to win since Cimarron won the 1930-31 Oscar. What famous Western
character did Warner Baxter play when he won the best actor Oscar for In Old
Arizona, in 1929?;    A. Billy the Kid; B. Buffalo Bill; C. The Cisco Kid; D.
Wyatt Earp; E. Jesse James (Answer below).; ANSWER: C.  </TEXT>
