ONE THING BILLY MARTIN DIDN'T MANAGE VERY WELL WAS HIS LIFE

Billy Martin does not, even now, rest in peace. There is tragedy there, and 
irony, too. 
</P>
<P>
If Martin ever sought solitude, he never found it. 
</P>
<P>
He died a violent death at the foot of his home in upstate New York, where he 
had moved a year ago. It was a country retreat, a 148-acre farm, far removed 
from the too-public violence of his life. This was where the circus would end 
and where he could start anew. 
</P>
<P>
But Martin died Monday on an icy road as a passenger in his own pickup truck, 
driven by a close friend who has been charged with driving while intoxicated. 
That the friend owned a bar in Detroit has been well noted. So, too, that 
Martin, a high-wire act to the end, was not wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
A New York county prosecutor has asked for an autopsy to determine the precise 
cause of death. In accordance with the wishes of Martin's wife, however, the 
coroner has refused, noting that Martin was, in this case, a victim -- a 
choice, and perhaps apt word. 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes for Martin, controversy following him to the grave. 
</P>
<P>
He was the dark side of sport. He was the driven man, who needed beyond all 
reason to succeed. And what drove him was rage. It was anger that made him pull 
a Reggie Jackson off the field or punch his own pitcher in the face. Anger and 
usually drink. He was angry at the world, and his anger, along with the drink, 
would prove his downfall. Amateur psychologists will line up to tell us of the 
father who deserted Martin as an infant and the scars it left on him. We know 
for sure only that there were scars, deep and ugly and too often made public. 
</P>
<P>
If he sought solace in drink, he never found it there, either. He was dangerous 
in a bar, to himself and to others. We can only guess he was an angry drunk. 
His long police blotter, which extended, of course, to Baltimore, tells us as 
much. 
</P>
<P>
By the end, he had become a caricature of himself. It was only a year ago when 
Martin, then age 60, described himself as Billy the Kid, with loaded 
six-shooters, we could surmise, at the ready. He wanted everyone to know that 
if the world wanted some of him, he was ready to take the world on. In the end, 
of course, the world won. It was ever thus. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted, too, after all his travails, that his drinking was not a problem, 
which recalled the old joke along the lines: I don't have a drinking problem; I 
drink, I pass out, no problem. 
</P>
<P>
We can recall that he was a brilliant manager, one of the few who could 
actually make a difference. He won in city after city, for team after team, 
only to be exiled when, finally, he would lose control of himself or of the 
players he drove too hard or of both. 
</P>
<P>
He will be most remembered, of course, as a Yankee, first as the over-achieving 
player and finally as the co-star, along with George Steinbrenner, of the 
tragicomedy in five acts that was Martin's managerial career in pinstripes. He 
was the damned Yankee. 
</P>
<P>
If we look closely, we can see that Steinbrenner is the villain of the piece. 
It was Steinbrenner who did the hiring and firing. It was Steinbrenner who kept 
holding the job in front of Martin as if it were a piece of meat and Martin a 
salivating dog. The low point may have been that commercial they cut with 
Steinbrenner firing Martin, who had become, by that time, a marionette. We know 
who pulled the strings, but we don't know exactly why. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Steinbrenner knew Martin might make a difference, if he could last 
long enough without imploding. Steinbrenner also knew of Martin's drinking 
problem and how it was exacerbated by the pressure of managing. By the fifth 
incarnation, which ended when the American League umpires basically led a 
revolt against Martin, it was too sad to watch. This had become an exercise in 
pulling the wings from a fly. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was not an easy person to feel sorry for. He had a nasty, biting temper 
and seemed to take pleasure in the misery of others. He was quick to lash out 
-- one's a born liar and the other's convicted. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, like him or not, he was a tragic figure, hurtling surely toward an 
unhappy end. When the news came of his death, who among us was surprised? 
Alcohol is thought to be a contributing factor, and who would have guessed 
otherwise? He was reportedly coming home from a bar the night he died. All his 
life, he had come to no good in bars. Remember the other beer commercial -- I 
didn't punch no dogie -- that was supposed to make us laugh? There's no more 
laughing now. And there's no one to rage against the dying of the light.
