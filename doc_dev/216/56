   His ``Renaldo and Clara'' didn't
exactly do big box office a decade ago, but Bob Dylan wants to
become a movie producer again, this time backing non-mainstream
productions by other writers.
   ``I'm talking with some people about starting a production
company where people can submit material that they think would not
be considered by the established studios _ young writers who might
have ideas for TV shows and film,'' he said in a recent interview.
``We're going to option books, comedy, dramas, it doesn't matter.
Anything creative.''
   Dylan was producer-director-writer-actor-editor on the 1978
``Renaldo and Clara,'' which marked the film debut of his friend
and sometime collaborator Sam Shepard. The overlong, surrealistic
account of the Rolling Thunder Revue tour also starred Joan Baez,
Arlo Guthrie, Allen Ginsberg, Harry Dean Stanton, Joni Mitchell,
Dylan's ex-wife, Sara, and just about everyone else on the tour.
But Dylan got good notices with an offbeat bit part in the 1973 Sam
Peckinpah film ``Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.'' He wrote
``Knockin' on Heaven's Door'' for the movie.
   ``I had to make that movie with almost a gun pointed at my
head,'' he said with a laugh. ``Originally, I was just going to
write the music and the song and then we got down to Mexico, and it
was impossible to get out. And Sam Peckinpah who directed that
movie was a real tyrant, a lovable tyrant. And he says, `You're
gonna be in this movie,' and I didn't have much choice.''
   Dylan recently did another acting turn, playing a reclusive rock
star in the feature film ``Hearts of Fire,'' but the movie has
never been released. The director, Richard Marquand (``Jagged
Edge''), died not long after its completion.
   ``He wanted me to be in that movie, I couldn't understand why,''
said Dylan. ``But he convinced me that I'd be good in it, and he
wanted me and only me. I had time at that time, and I did it, and I
enjoyed working with some people in there. (Co-star) Rupert Everett
was fantastic. ... We got to just like improvise things. I wasn't
really all that comfortable with standing in front of the camera
and having to give reactions. That made me feel kinda stupid. But I
enjoyed working with Rupert.''
   Dylan said he never saw the completed film.
   In fact, he doesn't see very many movies. But he did like
Pee-wee Herman's ``Big Top Pee-wee.'' This unexpected revelation
draws an expectable response. ``See? You actually laugh. I went
with a friend who said it was a joke,'' he said. ``I thought it was
good, though. It had such a strange perception of reality. First of
all, the guy's got a talkin' pig. Once you get beyond that, that
the pig talks, it's a natural thing, you know?
   ``The circus ringmaster had a wife that could stand in his hand.
I thought that was really incredible. I thought it was really
allegorical, you know, and the color was brightly unreal. You can't
compare it to `War and Peace.'''
