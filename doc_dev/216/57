<LEADPARA>  QUESTION: With the intense popularity of Fox's "Beverly Hills, 90210," I was
hoping you'd be able to tell me a bit about Gabrielle Carteris, who plays
Andrea. Also, where can I send her fan mail?;   ANSWER: Carteris (who plays
Andrea on the series), a San Francisco native, wanted to be an actress even
when she was a little girl -- and began working hard to make the dream a
reality while still in school. She trained at Sarah Lawrence College in New
York, at Britain's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and at the London Academy of
Music and Dramatic Art -- in addition to studying with various instructors in
New York City. She appeared in several off-Broadway productions as well as
compiling TV credits, including a recurring role in daytime's "Another World"
and the award-winning CBS after-school special "What if I'm Gay." When she's
not working, Carteris is an avid amateur athlete who enjoys snow skiing,
swimming, volleyball, martial arts and scuba diving. Fox TV has set up a
special address for all fan mail to the show. It's P.O. Box 5600, Beverly
Hills 90209.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Q: I'd like very much to know more about the career of Duncan Regehr, who
plays the role of Zorro on the Family Channel. What else has he been in?;   A:
Canadian actor Regehr played Errol Flynn in CBS' miniseries "My Wicked, Wicked
Ways" and Pat Garrett in TNT's "Billy The Kid." He also appeared in the
miniseries "The Blue and the Gray," "The Last Days of Pompeii," "Goliath
Awaits" and "V." His feature film credits include "Earthstar Voyager," "The
Last Samurai," "Banker" and "Primo Baby.";   Q: I am sure I recall Shirley
MacLaine starring in a TV series a long time ago, playing a reporter. My
friend insists MacLaine never did such a show. Can you please provide
details?;   A: You're referring to "Shirley's World," a short-lived ABC show
that had its debut in 1971. MacLaine played Shirley Logan, a "mod"
reporter-photographer whose work took her around the globe. It was filmed in
such far-flung spots as Tokyo and Hong Kong.;   Q: The neighbor on "Home
Improvement" looks awfully familiar to me. What shows has the actor done
before?;   A: Tim Allen's sagacious next-door neighbor is played by Earl
Hindman. He was an original cast member of ABC's daytime series "Ryan's Hope"
-- and stayed on the show for nine years.;   Q: Please provide details of the
new version of the series "V." I was a big fan of the original.;   A: There
are no details as yet. "V" star Marc Singer says there is talk of bringing the
sci-fier back, but it hasn't gotten much past the discussion stage at this
point. (box)  </TEXT>
