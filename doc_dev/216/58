WHAT IS IN A NAME? JUST ASK BILLY RIPKEN

Billy Ripken is introduced, and mixed among the cheers are a smattering of 
boos, the only boos any Baltimore Oriole will hear that night. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, in a recent magazine poll asking readers to name their favorite 
Oriole, Ripken finished second to big brother Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem to either love me or hate me," Billy Ripken says. "There's no 
middle ground with me." 
</P>
<P>
Not unlike many of his teammates, the younger Ripken is a struggling player 
with some potential who's trying to shape a major-league career that may or may 
not be there. 
</P>
<P>
In two years in the big leagues, he has had some good moments and bad, but 
none, except a certain episode with an obscene word on a baseball card, to 
engender either particular hostility or affection. Still, both are evident. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because of a few famous relatives. Because he's a Ripken in an 
organization where the name has magic. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always figured that was the reason," Ripken says. "The thing I hear a lot 
is, 'You'll never be as good as your brother.' No joke. That's not debatable. 
That's like the worst line ever. It just makes me laugh. I know I'm not as good 
as my brother. Everyone on this planet knows it. But they still say it." 
</P>
<P>
Billy is not exercised over the question. He got past that long ago, which is a 
good thing, because the problem is not going away. You have only to listen to 
sports radio call-in shows -- bad advice, by the way, for any ballplayer who 
values his sanity -- to understand there is in Baltimore a Billy Ripken factor. 
</P>
<P>
"Even before he got here, everyone was asking, 'Is he going to be as good as 
Cal?' " says his manager, Frank Robinson. "Cal sent a standard here, and people 
were excited about having another Ripken on the club. When Billy came up, he 
did nothing to change that. In fact, he enhanced it. 
</P>
<P>
"But when he went into a slump last year, a lot of people said he was playing 
because of favoritism. Well, his father only managed six games, and I know that 
wasn't true on my part. The half-year he had in '87 earned him a chance to be 
out there in '88." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the concept of Billy getting a break because he's a Ripken began in 
1987, when he was hitting over .300, playing for his father. It continued last 
year, even though his father was fired, and it hasn't stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't stop," Robinson says, "as long as he's in Baltimore. He better get 
used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Brother Cal understands the problem, having lived through something like it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"When I signed, it was normal to hear, 'You're only here because of your name,' 
" Cal Ripken says. "I even heard it from other players' wives. I'd be leading 
the team in hits, runs, everything else and still hear the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy's had a tougher road than I did. He had my dad and he had me in front of 
him. That put a little extra pressure on him. But you don't get to the big 
leagues unless you have ability. You can't get there on your name. It hasn't 
ever happened. It won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Having considered this phenomenon before, Cal has developed a theory to explain 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people parallel a Little League scenario to a big league scenario," he 
says. "Everyone played on a little league team where the dad is the coach, and 
he bats his kid fourth even though he can't hit. And maybe his kid plays the 
most. I guess you can get by in the Little League like that, but it just can't 
happen in the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Billy's status in the big leagues is problematic. As a second baseman, he has 
few peers defensively. He plays the game with what you might call enthusiasm, 
if running through walls is enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe he struts a bit, but he plays hard, too. But after hitting .308 in 
1987, he slipped to .207 last year, the lowest average for anyone having played 
150 or more games since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Answer this: If Ripken doesn't play second, who does? When Billy broke his 
finger in spring training, the job went to Rene Gonzales, another good-field, 
not-much-hit player, who's hitting .194. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Stanicek was expected to get a shot at second, but he has spent his entire 
spring in the whirlpool nursing one in a series of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy doesn't have a stranglehold on the job," Robinson says. "Everyone is 
going to play this year. Gonzo has done a good job, but he isn't exactly 
ripping it up. What do I say to Billy, 'You have to sit when the other guy is 
doing the things you can do'? 
</P>
<P>
"Billy has the potential to have a good career. If he hits behind the runner, 
bunts a runner over, gets a few hits, he can be an effective player. You know 
how well he plays second. When Billy is in the field, you don't have to hold 
your breath and wonder if he's going to make the play. You know he'll make it. 
He's going to play. Gonzo is going to play second and some third. It will all 
work out in the end." 
</P>
<P>
Billy says he's trying to do what the manager wants him to do and hopes that 
last season is just a bad memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, in '88, all the fans forgot about 1987," Billy says. "Well, I can 
forget about '88 as fast as they forgot about '87." 
</P>
<P>
But whatever happens this season, the one thing nobody will forget is his last 
name.
