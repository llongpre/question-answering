<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers has rejected a writer's request that Billy the Kid be 
pardoned for his role in the 1878 shooting death of Sheriff William Brady. 
</P>
<P>
A letter is being prepared telling Las Cruces author Opal Lee Priestley of the 
governor's decision, B. J. Wagner-Adam, the governor's administrator of pardons 
and extraditions, said Thursday. Priestley is the author of "Billy the Kid: The 
Good Side of a Bad Man." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner-Adam said a full investigation of all facts surrounding the case would 
be impossible because it happened so long ago.
