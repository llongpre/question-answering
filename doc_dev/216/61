   Joffrey Ballet founder Robert Joffrey, who died
earlier this year, was recalled for his enthusiasm, good taste and
love of the dance on Tuesday at a memorial service at the City
Center, where his company performs.
   Among the speakers was choreographer Agnes de Mille, who praised
Joffrey's attention to details in recreating lost ballet
masterpieces.
   ``Bob had a strange reverence, curiosity and fervor for the works
of other masters, like a museum curator. He introduced them to
America. This is a gift to our time, to our culture, and Bob did
it,'' Miss de Mille said.
   Kitty Carlisle Hart, chairman of the New York State Council on
the Arts, said that the Joffrey Ballet performed nearly 200 ballets
in 32 years, about half of them created for the company.
   Other speakers mentioned that the company was the first to
commission modern-dance choreographers to create for it. It was the
first to have residences in both New York and Los Angeles. A ballet
that Joffrey choreographed, ``Astarte,'' was the first ballet
pictured on the cover of Time magazine. The last ballet he
choreographed was the full-length ``The Nutcracker,'' which
premiered in 1987.
   Reconstructions for the company include ``Parade,'' by Leonide
Massine, ``The Afternoon of a Faun'' by Vaslav Nijinsky, ``The Green
Table'' by Kurt Jooss and ``Billy the Kid'' by Eugene Loring. He
added many of Sir Frederick Ashton's ballets to the Joffrey Ballet
repertory.
   ``He was more talented, more demanding and more fun than anybody
I've ever known,'' said Alexander Ewing, former general director of
the Joffrey Ballet. ``He wanted exactly his own way because he had
dedicated his life to making himself so well-informed. He had such
good taste, unerring sense of theater and energy. At the end you
wanted it as much as he did.''
   Other speakers were Sally Bliss, former artistic director of the
Joffrey II Dancers; Christian Holder, former Joffrey dancer; Frank
Hodsoll, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, who read a
message from President Reagan; Felisa Vanoff, former dancer and
founding director of the Joffrey's board in Los Angeles; Howard M.
Squadron, chairman of the City Center board; actress Stella Adler,
and Alexander Grant, guest artist with the British Royal Ballet.
   Allan Lewis, Joffrey Ballet music director, conducted the AGMA
Chorus in ``Alleluia.'' Company members Tina LeBlanc and Glenn
Edgerton danced the pas de deux from Joffrey's 1973
``Remembrances.'' Jodie Gates and Edgerton danced a pas de deux from
``Reflections'' by Gerald Arpino, the company's leading male dancer
in 1956, now artistic director of the company.
   Joffrey, who was born in Seattle, died March 25 at 57.
