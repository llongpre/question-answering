Retirement could be the best thing yet for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
On what other occasion would such a basketball legend be the recipient of 
countless gifts and tributes from fans? 
</P>
<P>
Even after his final regular season game Sunday, at which he received a 
Rolls-Royce, the accolades and presents keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
The latest was a black-tie benefit for Athletes &amp; Entertainers for Kids at 
the Century Plaza on Monday night. The organization, which supports and 
provides services for seriously ill children, gave the 42-year-old outgoing 
Laker center a six-hour-long send-off that included a cocktail reception, 
dinner, entertainment (taped to be shown in May on NBC) and an after-dinner 
party. 
</P>
<P>
The charity, however, took a back seat to the Kareem adoration fest. That began 
with a pre-dinner photo opportunity where he was given a watch, a Fender guitar 
and a bronze statue of himself, caught in mid-sky hook. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1,000 Per Ticket 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar never even made it into the VIP reception, where guests who had 
paid $1,000 per ticket (the regular price was $500) mingled to the tune of a 
live jazz ensemble. Those included Esai Morales, Jonathan Prince, Angie 
Dickinson, Scott Valentine, Carl Weathers, Jasmine Guy, Laker coach Pat Riley, 
Billy Crystal and Ryan White, this year's junior chairperson for the event. 
</P>
<P>
White is the Indiana teen-ager who was banned from his school after being 
infected with the AIDS virus from a blood transfusion. Last year his name went 
on the Ryan White National Foundation for AIDS Education. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the dinner speeches explaining the background and purpose of 
Athletes &amp; Entertainers for Kids were lost due to a bad sound system and 
the drone of more than 1,000 guests in the ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the children did benefit. 
</P>
<P>
That's due to the decision of the charity to allow about 250 children from 
hospitals, homeless shelters and rehabilitation centers to see the show. 
</P>
<P>
Said Athletes &amp; Entertainers for Kids founder and executive director Elise 
Kim: "We thought midway through planning the event that, gee, this is a great 
event for the adults, but since this is the only retirement gala in town, we 
wanted the kids we serve to attend." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Guiding Philosophy 
</P>
<P>
Kim admitted that inviting the children meant cutting down on profits. They 
expect to net $100,000 to $150,000; less than half of what they would have made 
had they sold those tickets. "It's more important," she said, "to stick to our 
basic philosophy, and that's trying to include the kids in our events." 
</P>
<P>
The children made use of their opportunity, carrying cameras and programs into 
the center of the room for snapshots and autographs of the Lakers, Farrah 
Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal, Whoopi Goldberg, L.A. Raiders' Howie Long and Marcus 
Allen, Debbie Allen, Bruce Willis, Elliott Gould, Quincy Jones, Martin Mull, 
Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., Patrick Duffy, Michele Greene, Joan Van Ark, 
James Caan and Peter Scolari, almost all of whom had some part in the show. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in the line-up has earned a reputation as a Lakers fan (as one 
guest noted, "Did Joan Van Ark play a big part in Kareem's life?"), and 
conspicuously absent from the roster were die-hard supporters Jack Nicholson 
and Dyan Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Glover recalled meeting Abdul-Jabbar 22 years ago at a student conference 
while he was attending San Francisco State University. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'll Miss the Artistry' 
</P>
<P>
"This was a guy who didn't have to be involved with the students," he said. 
"And ever since that time, I've been a Kareem fan. I've followed him every 
year. And you know, I'll miss the artistry and the beauty (of his playing). You 
remember a run, a sky hook, and it's very succinct in your head. It's more than 
sports. You're just gonna miss it." 
</P>
<P>
Martin Mull described himself as "The ultimate fan" of the Lakers (it's likely 
several people thought they had that distinction) and added, "There is no other 
basketball (team)." 
</P>
<P>
Any spontaneity the show might have had was lost in cue cards, long pauses and 
second takes. But there were some bright spots: Jackee singing "Your Feets Too 
Big" with the other Lakers as backup singers, Billy Crystal's comic 
reminiscences of his stint on his Long Island high school basketball team, a 
humorous biography recited by Elliott Gould and the pre-telecast performance of 
"Kareem's Dream Jazz Band," featuring Herbie Hancock, Stanley Clarke and 
Stanley Jordan. Unfortunately, they only got in one number. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar's thank-yous were quick, and he acknowledged just about everyone. 
"Between yesterday and today," he said, "you guys have worn me out." 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry. There's probably another tribute next week.
