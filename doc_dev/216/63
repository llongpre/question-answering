<LEADPARA>  WELL, it's almost Christmas here on the West Coast. You can tell because the
first of the spring flowers -- the narcissus -- have started to come up. The
last of the fall fruit -- the persimmons -- are still on the trees. And the
last rose of summer continues to bloom its heart out.;   Wacky?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Yep, just like all us folks who live out here. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
At least you'd think we're the fruitcake state if you believe all the rude
things the national media have said about California's sanity in the past two
years.;   First, they questioned the wisdom of our rebuilding in earthquake
country after 1989's World Series shaker. Then they -- our fellow Americans
"Back East," as virtually all West Coasters call any place east of Sparks,
Nev. -- slandered us for continuing to sing California's praises after the
Great Oakland Hills Fire.;   Time magazine devoted one of its apocalyptic
cover stories to us. And some shrew phoned a radio call-in show to gloat, "You
Californians hang yourselves. You live like you are in some Hollywood script,
and now the chickens have come home to roost.";   All those Back Easters
missed the point. Which is -- it takes a certain spirit to live here. You
either got it. Or you don't. In which case you probably didn't emigrate here
to begin with.;   Case in point A: our friends Brenda and Bill. Their
Christmas card this year is one of those photo cards with a preprinted
message. "Somehow 'Joy' just didn't seem quite right," Brenda told me with a
wicked grin. "So I picked 'From our house to yours.' ";   I snapped the
picture for them -- the day their kids came home from college to view what was
left of their house. Or rather, what wasn't left after the firestorm.;   The
family is standing in a row in front of the fireplace -- like many another
Christmas card pictures. Only the fireplace is perched on a column of bricks
about 10 feet above where they are standing -- in what probably had been the
downstairs bath, before the upstairs and roof came crashing down.;   No, "Joy"
wouldn't have been quite right this year, but it wouldn't have been all wrong
either.;   Case in point B: Ethel Golder, a white-haired elder sitting at the
next table at one of those wonderful California neighborhood places where
patrons can lunch outside every day on the deck. Unless it rains. Which it
hardly ever has in the past five years. Which is one reason we had such a
terrible fire.;   "I thought my next adventure would be the great hereafter,"
Mrs. Golder remarked. "Now this." She said it with a wide smile and an even
wider gesture that seemed to embrace the challenges ahead.;   Case C: Fire
victims Valma King, 101, and her 95-year-old sister Iola Imhof lost incredible
things when their house near the Claremont Hotel burned. Newspaper clippings
of their father's shoot-out in Texas with outlaw Billy the Kid. A tintype of
an uncle who served on the Union ironclad the Monitor. A gunpowder horn their
great-great-great-grandfather used at the battle of Lexington and Concord.;  
"It's dirty pool to do this to us at this time of our lives," the elder sister
told the Oakland Tribune, then added, "Ah well, 'gone with the wind.' ";   One
last case: Brenda's next-door neighbor, an octogenarian who had built his
little house more than a half-century ago for his bride.;   All of this is to
say that somehow it has been very reassuring to be a Californian this
particular Christmas season. The nation may be deep in recession, but here we
have rediscovered the resilience of human beings.;   To celebrate life in the
darkest days of winter is an old family tradition -- a human family tradition.
Our pagan ancestors did it with mistletoe. In Oakland this year, we may be
celebrating with poppies and lupines. Within days of the fire, the same
helicopters that scooped water out of lakes to quench October's blaze were
dropping seeds on the blackened hillsides, which now are turning green.;  
Which is a sure sign of Christmas in California.  </TEXT>
