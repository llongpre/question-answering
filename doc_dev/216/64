<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  LONG before "Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey" (opening today) begins, our heroes
are having a most heinous summer.;    Their days at San Dimas High --
chronicled in the totally resplendent "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" --
have ended. And their jobs at Pretzels 'N' Cheese are not sterling. Alex
Winter, who plays Bill, looks like he's wondering why he hasn't gotten any
decent parts since the last film. And Keanu Reeves, who plays Ted, is probably
trying to figure out why "Point Break" stunk so royally.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Then things get worse.;    It starts off normally enough. Bill and Ted are
in their bachelor unit consuming mass quantities of Meister Brau and Doritos
watching "Star Trek" -- the real one with the pointy-eared dude, not the new
one with the bald dude -- and getting into the "Arena" episode where James
Tiberius Kirk fights the Gorn.;    Suddenly another set of Bill-and-Teds
magically arrives. "The evil us-es!" good Bill and Ted chorus. Most
egregiously. Because their evil us-es, robots with really cool rubber faces
they can peel off, have been sent back into time to kill the good Bill and
Ted, take their places, and stop them from establishing the
be-excellent-to-each-other philosophy that will one day sweep the world.;   
No way? Yes way.;    What follows now may not make much sense or seem very
funny if you're an adult, unless you too have been consuming mass quantities
of Meister Brau and Doritos. But that's part of the charm of Bill and Ted.
They don't make much sense either.;    People have compared them to Jeff
Spicoli, the class clown Sean Penn played in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"
but that's bogus. The Ex-Mr. Madonna man would eat these kids for munchies.
People also have compared them to Garth and Wayne on "Saturday Night Live,"
but hey, Bill and Ted were here first. Later, Garth and Wayne.;    They're a
little like Cheech and Chong, except Bill and Ted are naturally dopey. They're
a little like Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall from the Bowery Boys, too -- Bill even
wears a baseball cap -- but they're hipper. Face to face with Satan, the
Bowery Boys wouldn't call him "the dude downstairs." Hell, they weren't even
able to handle running into Bela Lugosi.;    Bill and Ted are basically, no
matter what happens to them, Bill and Ted. How much you like the movie depends
on how much you like them and how long you can smile at people saying
"Excellent!" Sixty minutes seems about right.;    Unfortunately, the movie
lasts about 90 minutes.;    Luckily there are some good jokes along the way.
We won't tell you all of them. That's the job of those people who make the
trailers that run on TV until you know every punch-line by heart. (Yeah, like
the jokes in "The Naked Gun 2 1/2" were really a surprise when you finally
went to see it. Tell us about it.);    But we will tell you Bill and Ted get
to go to heaven (which is really like a bad Steven Spielberg movie, right down
to the stupid cute aliens) and to hell, which is a little like a Yes album
cover. There they confront a most monstrous Easter Bunny. And meet Bill's
88-year-old Granny S. Preston, who wants a kiss.;    All in all, hell is a bit
of a disappointment. The special effects aren't special. And we think Bill and
Ted's real idea of hell would probably be that high school in "Heathers," only
Winona Ryder would totally ignore them and all the other cool babes would be
staring and saying "How very.";    But Bill and Ted also meet the Grim Reaper
dude, who is outstanding. He has a white face and a Swedish accent. You know,
like that guy in the black-and-white movie with the writing on the bottom that
public TV used to show? And just like Death in that movie, the Grim Reaper
challenges these two lost souls to a game.;    Chess? Don't be mental. Ted
probably still can't figure out how the horsey dudes move. No, Death gambles
for their souls over a game of -- Battleship. Milton Bradley, my man.;   
Winter and Reeves are most outstanding as Bill and Ted. They probably could do
this in their sleep by now and maybe they are. William Sadler is a most great
Grim Reaper. Members of Faith No More and Primus appear, and play themselves
convincingly.;    First-time director Peter Hewitt keeps Bill and Ted from
bumping into the furniture, except when they're supposed to, and Ed Solomon
and Chris Matheson's script moves things along for the first hour before it
forgets how to end. The fantasy sequences are the best, and since Matheson's
father, Richard, wrote the original incredible shrinking dude movie, maybe
this is no surprise.;    "Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey" is an astonishing
spectacle of magical mise en scene and Oscar-worthy cinematic wizardry -- not.
But it is good, clean and very dumb fun.;  Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey;
