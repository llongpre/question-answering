Fifth graders from throughout Los Angeles County will be at the Music Center 
today and Friday for the 19th annual Blue Ribbon Children's Festival. They'll 
see the Joffrey Ballet perform "Billy the Kid." More youngsters will attend 
performances next week, with about 26,000 expected in all. Two performances for 
another 6,000 students have been canceled because of the Los Angeles teachers 
strike. ALEENE MacMINN
