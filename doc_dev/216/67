   Martin Scorsese's film ``The Last Temptation of
Christ'' will appear in the Venice Film Festival, despite being
branded by some church leaders as blasphemous and condemned by
Italy's leading political party.
   ``Why not show it?'' asked Genny Fiorin, head of the Cinema
Office, in a telephone interview Monday from Venice.
   The Christian Democrats denounced the movie in which Jesus must
endure the ``last temptation'' _ making love to Mary Magdalene.
   The Italian Roman Catholic organization Reagire (React) also
sent the festival's director a telegram criticizing the film as
blasphemous. The festival begins Aug. 28.
   Fundamentalist church groups also have protested the movie in
the United States. The movie, which stars Willem Dafoe as Jesus and
Barbara Hershey as Mary, is to be released next month.

   ``La Bamba'' star Lou Diamond Phillips says
he's a shoo-in for most ethnic roles, thanks to his multiracial
heritage _ mostly Filipino with a little Chinese, Hawaiian and
Spanish mixed in.
   ``There are a lot of blond-haired, blue-eyed actors out there,
and good ones at that,'' Phillips said recently. ``But in my
category there aren't that many actors in the running.''
   Phillips made his film debut portraying Ritchie Valens in last
summer's hit ``La Bamba.'' Now he's joining other young Hollywood
actors in ``Young Guns.''
   The Billy the Kid movie starring Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen,
Kiefer Sutherland and Phillips will be released Aug. 12. Phillips
stars as Jose Chavez y Chavez of Mexican and Navajo Indian heritage.
   ``I know that for a role like that I'm a shoo-in,'' he said.
``It's something I can do automatically.''

   Police from four states have canceled
plans to protest at a performance by Willie Nelson after the
country singer decided to give a concert that will partially
benefit law enforcement officers.
   ``If everything goes as planned, we probably won't have any
demonstration,'' said Al Leavitt, president of the state Fraternal
Order of Police, of Nelson's concert scheduled for Aug. 27.
   Police nationwide criticized his appearance last October at a
benefit for Leonard Peltier, an American Indian activist serving
two life sentences for the 1975 slayings of two FBI agents.
   Peltier's supporters are raising money to pay for an appeal.
   The West Virginia FOP made plans to protest at Nelson's Aug. 27
concert in Charleston after Rhode Island police said they would
picket the singer concerts last weekend in Warwick, R.I.
   About 800 officers from West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio and
Virginia demonstrated at a Nelson concert Friday in Warwick, R.I.,
but canceled plans for a demonstration Saturday after Nelson agreed
to the new benefit concert.
   Proceeds will go to the American Indian Relief Fund and the
National Police Memorial Fund.

   Pro wrestler Hulk Hogan will roll out the
welcome mat when he plays host to a teen-ager afflicted with
muscular dystrophy.
   Scott Lade, 15, who weighs only 31 pounds, will be flown with
his family to Baltimore on Thursday, attend the wrestling matches
Friday night and then meet Hogan and other wrestlers in the locker
room.
   ``I plan to ask (Hulk) a lot of questions,'' Scott said.
   The trip was arranged and paid for by Make a Wish, a
Denver-based philanthropic organization.
   The teen-ager from southwest Colorado has suffered from the
disease since early childhood. His 17-year-old sister, Heather,
also has the disease.
   ``All their lives I've tried to treat them as normal kids,''
said their mother, Jean. ``Their bodies are shot, but their minds
aren't. We think of every day as a quality day, since they won't
have quantity.''

   Composer and pianist Marvin Hamlisch, a
frequent performer at the White House, has been named by President
Reagan to be a member of the National Council on the Arts.
   Hamlisch has written numerous scores for movies and Broadway
musicals, including ``They're Playing our Song'' and ``Chorus
Line,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award. He often is
host of a broadcast concert series presented at the White House and
is a favorite of Nancy Reagan's.
   If Monday's nomination is confirmed by the Senate, Hamlisch
would succeed novelist Allen Drury on the arts council. The council
is the chief advisory arm of the National Endowment for the Arts,
the independent federal agency that underwrites a wide variety of
artists and arts institutions.
