<LEADPARA>  Brett Miller, the onetime Watsonville outlaw for whom the phrase "living a
life of crime" is no overstatement, is back behind bars.;    The 26-year-old
desperado, whose rap sheet is as long as your figurative arm, is in the Santa
Cruz County hoosegow. He's being held for violating probation.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But Miller probably will not be going back to prison until he faces a
kidnapping charge in San Luis Obispo County and a mess of cattle rustling
charges over in the San Joaquin Valley.;    Miller, who grew up in Watsonville
and had been living under an assumed name in a trailer near Santa Margarita in
San Luis Obispo County, was picked up last month by deputies who wanted to
talk to him about the probation violation, the kidnapping and the cattle
thefts.;    Expecting him to run, the San Luis Obispo County posse came
equipped with a helicopter, according to Detective Mike Sheridan.;    The
investigator said a very cold, very wet Miller was soon fished out from under
the lid of an almost-full water tank sunk in the ground near his trailer.;   
Sheridan said that Miller and some associates were wanted in connection with
the April 12 kidnapping of Rita Kaye Roy, 47, of Templeton. He said the woman,
operations manager of the Bank of America branch in Atascadero, was robbed of
her bank keys, then was let loose in a remote area, where she walked to a
farmhouse and notified authorities. She was not injured.;    "They were going
to rob the bank," said Sheridan, who said he found the banker's keys as well
as ID tags from the ears of stolen cattle when he searched Miller's house
trailer.;    The cattle rustling, said a Merced County sheriff's investigator,
involved calves stolen from dairies in Stanislaus and Merced counties and sold
at livestock markets around the state, including the 101 Auction between San
Juan Bautista and Salinas on Highway 101.;    Merced County investigator Ralph
Dutro said a U-Haul truck that transported stolen calves to a livestock
auction in Sonoma County was traced to Miller under his assumed name.;    The
investigator said the calves were stolen late at night.;    "They'd take 20 or
so at a time, although one time they took 29. The going price for drop calves
(newborns) is $125, and these animals were older and probably brought them
more.;    "They were selling heifers as well as bulls, and you know, dairymen
usually don't sell their heifers. They put 'em back into the herd. So that was
suspicious, and someone up in Sonoma County wrote down the license number of
that truck.";    He said two others were arrested with Miller. Tony Simas, 23,
formerly of Freedom and Prunedale, and Yvonne Leopoldo, 20, of Delhi, were in
custody in Merced County jail.;    Miller's criminal history in Santa Cruz
County stretches back almost a decade.;    Miller, who declined to be
interviewed, once was charged with conspiracy to kidnap the manager of a
Watsonville bank, and with attempting to extort $500,000 from a prominent
Watsonville family.;    In a plea bargain, Santa Cruz County District Attorney
Art Danner said last week, Miller entered a guilty plea to the extortion
attempt and to conspiracy to commit robbery, a charge growing out of the plan
to snatch a Pajaro Valley banker -- using, Danner noted, the same scheme
Miller is charged with using in the San Luis Obispo kidnapping.;    At the
same time, the prosecutor said, Miller received prison time for several other
felonies, including assault, and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Under
state guidelines, Danner said, the actual sentence was more like 4 1/2 years.;
   "We tried to put him away for as long as we could," Danner said. "Our
prediction, which has proven true, was that he was going to commit more crimes
at every opportunity.;    "We thought he should not be at large.";    Miller
escaped at least twice from custody, including once from Santa Cruz County
jail in 1986 and once from a sheriff's van at the Watsonville courthouse annex
the previous year. Another time, he fled pursuing officers by jumping into the
Pajaro River.;    One deputy recalled that Miller kept a flock of illegal
fighting cocks in a motor home parked in Watsonville, and once was found in a
Southern California motel room with an arsenal of assault weapons and the body
of a friend who had overdosed on drugs.;    During one stretch in Santa Cruz
County jail, Miller was charged with arson for setting his mattress afire.;   
A lawyer who defended Miller in his earlier kidnapping and extortion cases
called the man "positively the most colorful defendant I've ever represented.;
   "The kid's a classic," Tony Salatich said. "I think he sees a movie of
himself running in his head. He sees himself as being somewhere between Billy
the Kid and Bonnie and Clyde.";    Once, recalled Santa Cruz County Deputy Kim
Allyn, Miller, wanted on some warrants, fled by jumping into Freedom Lake near
Watsonville. Allyn chased the fleeing youth, then 19 or 20 years old, across a
chain-link fence and into the lake, finally tackling a bedraggled Miller after
splashing across the pond.;    "Brett Miller is a wannabe Jesse James," Allyn
said. "He's a worthy opponent when you're giving him chase.;    "But he's also
a coward. He starts whining and whimpering as soon as he's caught."  </TEXT>
