True, 'Billy the Kid" is a beloved icon of Americana. But that doesn't keep it 
from resembling a stylized puppet show. Especially when the stage, a perfect 
jewel-box setting like that of the Smothers Theatre at Pepperdine University in 
Malibu, cannot provide resonating space for the landmark dance semaphores that 
the late Eugene Loring originated 50 years ago.

It was to this otherwise ideal platform that the Oakland Ballet brought its 
1976 production of "Billy" on Saturday, staged by the choreographer. Again, one 
had to marvel at his invention no less than his intent.

But when Loring's gallery characters of the old West push across the plains to 
meet their destiny, they need a frame large enough to give dimension to their 
pronounced gestures, so clearly symbolic. And when Copland's miracle score, 
with its long lines of wistful tenderness, suggest distance and solitude, we 
want to see what we hear.

The cast compensated, however. In the title role Michael Myers went from the 
truly bereft and horrified youngster who watched as his mother was shot down to 
the defensive outlaw forever marked by that attack. He made Billy Cagneyesque 
-- a small tough-guy, quick to retaliate.

Towering above him was the square-jawed Ron Thiele as the friend, Pat Garrett. 
The size difference between them lent their eventual enmity a touch of pathos 
and underscored Billy's tragic alienation. Michael Lowe, as Alias, met his 
multi-character challenge convincingly and Patti Owen, in the Mother/Sweetheart 
roles stressed simplicity over preciousness.

Other items showed the company to conventionally balletic advantage -- strong, 
supple, fluent and expressive.DONNA PERLMUTTER
