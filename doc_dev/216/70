   Billy Ray, the dude schoolteacher, is reading to
his class from a penny dreadful about the Old West, ``Kid Durango:
The Dust Devils.'' The Kid, of course, is brave, strong and quick
with a gun.
   One of his students, the fair Nettie, sighs at the part about a
terrible band of outlaws from Mexico. Just then, such a band
gallops into her dusty Texas town for purposes of robbing a bank
and killing people.
   The fair Nettie dashes outside to see all this. El Diablo, the
gang's handsome, ruthless leader, rides up and kidnaps her, even
though she's only oh, maybe 17. Billy Ray, although from Boston,
vows to rescue her.
   This, buckaroos, starts Home Box Office's ``El Diablo,'' a
shaggy Western tale arriving Sunday on the pay-cable service.
   It co-stars Anthony Edwards as the dude schoolteacher who
believes the Old West cliches, and Lou Gossett as an ex-sergeant
from the Army's black cavalry. The latter now is a gunfighter hired
to help save Nettie.
   Representing Old West reality, he sort of instructs the dude in
how ride a horse _ he lets the horse drag Billy Ray when he falls
off _ and how to shoot and hit something, such as another man with
a gun.
   Gunnery protocol, he says, includes looking at an opponent's gun
hand, not his eyes, and shooting opponents in the back whenever
possible.
   With a script by a trio that includes John Carpenter of
``Halloween'' and ``The Fog'' fame, such assault on Western
verities should be pretty funny. Well, at times the script is.
   Its early moments include an old codger who smiles at Billy Ray
and the fair Nettie (Sarah Trigger) as they head to school, then
cheerily says, ``Beautiful mornin' for procreation.''
   There also is a scruffy townie who, after El Diablo rides off
with fair Nettie, recalls seeing him hanged once, but ``he wouldn't
die. He just hanged there by his neck, spittin' at the crowd like
they disgusted him.''
   There is a lot to be said for such lines, likewise the lowlife
posse gunfighter Gossett digs up _ a man with a store leg, an
Indian with whose wife El Diablo has consorted, and a preacher who
holds fake hangings with two colleagues in return for donations.
   All have varied motives for joining the chase. They're later
joined by Truman Feathers (Joe Pantoliano), a dusty, but prissy
British author of the ``Kid Durango'' series.
   Upon meeting Billy Ray, now clad in gun and wooly chaps, the
writer is moved to say: ``I love your outfit.''
   Problem is, the ``El Diablo'' script is in dire need of editing.
When the funny lines and situations arise, and there are quite a
few, the authors stretch things out. This tends to fritter away the
funny.
   They also don't seem to realize that shock for comic effect
should be sparingly used, as when the dude accidentally shoots and
kills his horse while trying to ride out of town. Sure enough, it
happens again later.
   And while the show is beautifully photographed, director Peter
Markle usually moves things along at a snail's pace, a mortal sin
for an Old West show.
   The pace does pick up as the posse approaches and enters Mexico,
where El Diablo is keeping both his stolen gold and the fair Nettie
in a town ringed by mountains. Guns go off and bodies fall all over
the place.
   But even with the preceding moments of doom, it takes a while
for the show to get moving. Markle tends to make the proceedings
going downright leisurely, almost an art-film edition of ``Blazing
Saddles,'' minus the fine bean-dinner scene and its ensuing blasts
of hot air.
   Still, ``El Diablo,'' whose title cad is played by Robert
Beltran, has some good performances by Gossett and Andrews. The
supporting players also do fine work, particularly Pantoliano.
   If you have HBO, the movie is worth a look-see, flaws and all.
But it could and should have been a whole lot funnier.
