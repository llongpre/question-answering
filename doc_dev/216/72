   Zookeepers are blaming a kid boom at
the Forest Park Zoo on the escapades of a billy goat who escaped
from his pen.
   Six nanny goats have given birth to 11 kids in the past week and
five more nannies may be expecting, said zoo manager Barbara Lewis.
``We're taking this day by day,'' she said.
   Lewis said the billy goat escaped and mingled with the nannies
for two weeks late last summer while repairs were being made to a
nearby pond. At the time, Lewis said, she did not know the extent of
the goat's exploits.
   One of the kids, Frankie, has been named for the security guard
who found its mother giving birth last week. Lewis said the guard
had never seen a birth and was thrilled by the experience.
