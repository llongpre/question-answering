<HEAD>`La Bamba' Star Sees Ethnicity as Advantage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Actor Lou Diamond Phillips, predominantly
Filipino on his mother's side with a little Chinese, Hawaiian and
Spanish blood mixed in, recognizes the advantage of his ethnicity.
   ``I can play most of the brown races,'' Phillips said in a
recent interview. ``There are a lot of blond-haired, blue-eyed
actors out there, and good ones at that. But in my category there
aren't that many actors in the running.''
   Phillips made his film debut portraying Ritchie Valens in last
summer's hit ``La Bamba.'' Now he's joining a team of young
Hollywood actors in the upcoming western ``Young Guns.''
   The Billy the Kid movie starring Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen,
Kiefer Sutherland and Phillips is being released Aug. 12. Phillips
stars as Jose Chavez y Chavez of Mexican and Navajo Indian heritage.
   ``The truth of the matter is when a Chavez y Chavez character
comes up, I'm on the A List for the part, which is nice,'' he said.
``I know that for a role like that I'm a shoo-in. It's something I
can do automatically.
   ``But luckily I'm not being limited to just those roles. I'm not
becoming the ethnic poster boy for Hollywood.''
