<LEADPARA>  'OH, GOD it can't be prom time already," said my navigator, looking at the
long queue of white stretch-limos choking San Carlos Street in front of the
San Jose Convention Center. The heart of the New Downtown was beating
furiously Saturday night. Glitzy young women in strapless gowns were hanging
out of the limo sunroofs, waving glasses of champagne and carrying on like the
first platoon of tanks to liberate the Champs-Elysees. It was not a high
school prom but the captains of industry and their first mates en route to the
Silicon Valley Charity Ball.;    And they say San Jose is growing up.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  IN SEARCH OF THE HEARTTHROB OF DOWNTOWN SAN
JOSE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Over on Second Street, we saw a remarkable sight: light-rail cars with
riders, all taking a free trip to celebrate the opening of the rail extension
to South San Jose. The city may not have cable cars that climb halfway to the
stars, but now it has a trolley that goes to IBM.;    On the sidewalk in front
of the Pavilion on Second Street, we saw a line of 100 dressed-for-excess
young people. They weren't waiting for a train.;    Heartthrob, downtown's
latest mass-market dance club, has been doing turn-away business since it
opened in January. We asked the doorman tending the velvet rope how long the
wait would be. He said a half-hour. At 10:20, we took our place at the back of
the line and settled in for a wait that would eventually stretch to more than
an hour. Like strangers stranded by chance in an elevator, we'd get to know
our fellow line-standers well by the time the long wait was over.;    The
throng of heavily moussed, heavily perfumed twentysomethings passed the time
by peering through the fish-bowl floor-to-ceiling windows of Casola's, the
club's in-house pizza-and-pasta restaurant.;    The three women behind us
fretted with their coiffures, which had been frozen earlier in the evening
into gravity-defying baroque sculptures. Behind them, two wise guys in
overalls and bright polka-dot shirts were providing continuous play-by-play
and color commentary on everything from passing cars and motorcycles to the
imagined sexual proclivities of women in the crowd.;    In front of us, a
6-foot Cheryl Tiegs look-alike was shivering in a barely-there black
skort-dress. Her boyfriend remained wrapped around her like a greatcoat for
the entire wait. Talk turned to the efficacy of false IDs, the ethics of
"laying down rubber" in the driveway of a former flame and the aesthetic
allure of Vanilla Ice's "Ice, Ice Baby.";    Peering into Casola's, we watched
as a "shooter girl" served a large shot glass of tequila to a waif who looked
21-and-a-day. After the shaky young initiate had downed the noxious substance,
her friends cheered, and the s.g. gave a loud toot on a whistle she wore
around her neck for just such an occasion.;    Not five minutes later, a great
groan went up among the line-standers. "Lookit! Lookit! She losin' it! She
gonna blow chow!" said the color commentator. It was a different young woman
seated alone in a booth off the restaurant. The crowd outside cheered and
pounded on the window as she vomited repeatedly. This time, the shooter girl
did not come to blow her whistle.;    Finally, we passed muster at the velvet
rope and crossed the Rubicon into this wonderland of allegedly adult pleasure.
To attract a wide range of ages, the club plays a mix of music from the '50s
to the '90s, gradually skewing the mix to contemporary sounds as each night
wears on. By 11:30 on Saturday, the music was 100 percent urban groove and
commercial hip-hop, and we saw barely a soul over 25.;    Scattered around the
club's two levels are giant sheet-metal tubs of iced beer the size of
children's swimming pools. And on top of them are young, bright-eyed women
dancing aerobic routines. "Work your way around to a beer tub girl! Do it
now!" implored the unseen disc jockey. And lest anyone feel the need to chase
a couple of tequila shots with a beer and a couple of slices of waxy-looking
pepperoni pizza, a vendor is stationed in the center of the lobby to serve the
latter.;    Over in the well-appointed game area, we found a photo booth,
mechanical basketball games, an arm-wrestling machine, mechanical horse
racing, pool tables and -- bless their souls -- air hockey. Our hand-eye
coordination was still holding up just fine, but we decided to resist the
temptation of a quick puck.;    The sparsely decorated downstairs section of
the 600-plus capacity bi-level club could easily have been the set of
"American Bandstand." Wall-to-wall bodies and lights. The club's designers
apparently thought so, too. Above the dance floor there's a neon sign that
reads: "I give this place a 98, it's got a good beat and you can dance to it."
A few feet away another neon sign reads "Do your parents know you're here?" So
much for decoration.;    The hit parade continued its inexorable march to the
present: The B-52s' extended mix of "Love Shack" gave way to Billy Idol's
"Mony, Mony" and M.C. Hammer's "U Can't Touch This." The sea of steamy, sweaty
flesh began to churn faster. We knew "Ice, Ice Baby" couldn't be far behind.; 
  When we walked out, the Pavilion clock tower said midnight straight up, and
there were still 100 hopefuls shivering in line.;    After all, one man's
angina is another man's Heartthrob.; (hbox);    Our own Top 10: Wherein
