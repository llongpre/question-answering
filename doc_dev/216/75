   A glittering assembly of Kennedys and
other dignitaries saluted Rose Kennedy on her 100th birthday,
although the honored matriarch was in poor health and absent during
most of the celebration.
   The 370 guests attended the party in a large tent on Mrs.
Kennedy's lawn a few yards from Nantucket Sound. Four of her five
surviving children were present, as were most of her 28
grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren.
   Around 5 p.m., after the lunch and speeches were over, a nurse
briefly wheeled Mrs. Kennedy, flanked by a few members of her clan,
out on the porch of her home.
   Earlier, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy had given a testimonial to his
mother but said he didn't expect her at the festivities because of
her frail health.
   ``As she told me just a few days ago,'' he said, ```I'm like old
wine _ they don't bring me out very often, but I'm well
preserved.'''
   The Massachusetts Democrat was joined by his ex-wife Joan
Kennedy; by Ethel Kennedy, the widow of his brother Robert Kennedy;
and by Kennedy sisters Patricia Kennedy Lawford, Jean Kennedy Smith
and Eunice Shriver. Their mentally retarded sister, Rosemary,
remained in a Wisconsin nursing home.
   ``In the chaos of our household, she was the quiet at the center
of the storm, the anchor of our family, the safe harbor to which we
always came,'' said the 58-year-old Edward Kennedy, the youngest of
nine children of Rose and the late Joseph P. Kennedy.
   ``She always stressed the importance of family loyalty and
family strength,'' said Mrs. Shriver, standing before a
photographic exhibit of her mother's life. ``She taught us we were
much stronger as a family than as individuals.''
   The birthday celebration was held a week before Mrs. Kennedy's
July 22 birthday. A smaller group will visit with her next Sunday.
   The guests were seated in a large tent at small tables under a
huge portrait taken of Mrs. Kennedy in 1980, her chin up and
wearing a red hat.
   The family and their guests ate from a buffet of poached salmon,
turkey, lobster and scallop salad and pasta primavera. Each table
held a bouquet of pink roses and a tiny framed portrait of Mrs.
Kennedy in a floral frame.
   Many of the guests wept during the showing of a film of Mrs.
Kennedy's life, narrated by her son. Singer Maureen McGovern
performed a medley of Mrs. Kennedy's favorite Irish songs,
including ``Rose of Tralee'' before the gathering sang ``Happy
Birthday.''
   President John F. Kennedy's daughter, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, attended but her mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
and her brother, John Jr., did not. TV reporter Maria Shriver, 34,
and her husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger, arrived with their baby
daughter, Katherine, dressed in a red polka dot playsuit and red
shoes. Maria Shriver is the daughter of Eunice and Sargent Shriver.
   Members of the Kennedy family spoke prior to the luncheon
ceremony about their contributions to the field of mental
retardation.
   Robert Kennedy Jr., 36, with his son clinging to his side, spoke
of his involvement in an inter-generational home for teen-age
mothers and elderly people in New York's inner city.
   Robert's brother Chris Kennedy, 26, said he has been directing a
model preschool program in Chicago, which mixes mentally retarded
children with average kids.
   ``One of the things that has made the greatest difference to our
mother is the work in which the current generation (of Kennedys) is
involved,'' Sen. Kennedy said. ``Mother told them and us that that
is her greatest birthday present.''
   Many of the guests were specialists in the field of mental
retardation. Also attending were humorist Art Buchwald; Kennedy
historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr.; Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and his
wife, Kitty; Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos; actor Tom Hulce;
and champion skier Billy Kidd, who is involved with the Special
Olympics for mentally retarded children. The master of ceremonies
was Robert MacNeil of ``The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour.''
   Four of Rose's children died in tragic circumstances. Her eldest
son, Joe Jr., was killed flying a secret Navy mission in 1944;
daughter Kathleen died in a plane crash in France. President
Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and in 1968 Robert Kennedy was
shot to death in Los Angeles while he campaigned for the presidency.
