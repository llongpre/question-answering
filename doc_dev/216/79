The Joffrey Ballet's reconstruction of Vaslav Nijinsky's watershed ballet "Le 
Sacre du Printemps" was introduced to Orange County on Thursday, capping a 
program devoted to works created for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. 
</P>
<P>
It was simply sensational. 
</P>
<P>
"Sacre" made dance and music history in 1913 when audiences rioted at the Paris 
premiere. Which had proved more inciting -- Stravinsky's rhythm-mad score or 
Nijinsky's violently anti-classical choreography? For nearly 74 years, the 
answer had to be Stravinsky's music, because the choreography had virtually 
vanished. 
</P>
<P>
But dance historian Millicent Hodson and art historian Kenneth Archer 
painstakingly re-created the work for Robert Joffrey, and the answer to the 
question perhaps shifted to Nijinsky's corner when the provocative results were 
first seen in 1987 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the company has grown only stronger in the chugging steps, foot 
stompings, vertical arm thrusts, massed circlings, hypnotic rituals, visual 
counter-rhythms and eerie delicacy of women floating upon raised toe. 
</P>
<P>
At the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, the company also 
more powerfully projected a sense of inner drama, swooping in response to the 
Old Woman (Carole Valleskey) whose divinations will precipitate events, 
cowering from unseen dread overhead, shuddering spastically at the Old Sage's 
charisma. 
</P>
<P>
Beatriz Rodriguez has sharpened her portrayal as the Chosen One, combining rage 
and swooning weakness in "Petrushka" gestures, and evoking sympathy as the 
character worked to keep her legs from giving way because she seemed to know 
that as long as she could keep moving, she could stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
But "Sacre" is by no means entirely kinetic. Stop-action interrupts impelled 
movement, underscoring parallels with another work on Thursday's program, 
"L'Apres-midi d'un Faune" (to Debussy's score), Nijinsky's first effort at 
choreography, created less than a year before. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Walters was seen as the Faune when the Joffrey danced at the Center in 
September, 1987. Walters has deepened an already fine conception, adding 
nuances to the stages of emotional transition, particularly in transforming 
awakening sensuality into vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
Charlene Gehm again was the warm Leader of the Nymphs. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Narbutus made his first local appearance as the Chinese Conjurer with an 
otherwise familiar cast in Leonide Massine's "Parade" (music by Satie). 
Narbutus hovered weightlessly in impressive bounds, hissed with visceral power 
and uncovered feline aspects of the role. But his leg work was not yet fully 
tensed, crisp or sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Pacific Symphony played securely for John Miner ("Parade" and 
"Faune") and Allan Lewis ("Sacre"). 
</P>
<P>
 The Joffrey Ballet performs through Sunday at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. At 2 p.m. the ballet will dance 
"Parade," "L'Apres-midi d'un Faune" and "Le Sacre du Printemps." A second 
performance, at 8 p.m., includes "Cloven Kingdom," "Billy the Kid" and "Suite 
Saint-Saens." Tickets: $13 to $39. Information: (714) 556-2787.
