The Joffrey Ballet, Dance Theatre of Harlem and Oakland Ballet each brought 
authoritative productions of "Billy the Kid" to Southern California in the past 
six weeks. But all too often, the leading dancer in Eugene Loring's 1938 
morality tale seemed miscast: Billy the Hunk, Billy the Prince, Billy the 
Weird. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Kid finally arrived: Alexander Kolpin of the Royal Danish 
Ballet, appearing as a stellar guest in a 50th anniversary staging at Loring's 
former home base, the Fine Arts Village Theater, UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Short, slender and coltish (he turned 24 Thursday), Kolpin not only looked 
ideally youthful, he danced with the hyperkinetic propulsion of a teen-ager in 
a big hurry. Moreover, he provided a number of sharp insights about the 
character's immaturity: Billy's intent, childlike fascination with the death of 
his victims, for instance, or his sudden pangs of loneliness just before the 
final encounter with Pat Garrett. Meet the Wild West's rebel without a cause. 
</P>
<P>
Kolpin had never danced the role anywhere until Wednesday, and inevitably there 
were unfinished details. However, his performance was obviously world class in 
its originality, eloquence, technique and sense of style. UCI students danced 
all the other roles, but their inexperience showed less in this gesture-based 
story ballet than in other pure-dance vehicles on the program. 
</P>
<P>
For the occasion, Patricia L. Whiteside -- who also supervised Donald 
Bradburn's staging of "Billy" -- mounted a production of Loring's last ballet, 
"Time Unto Time." 
</P>
<P>
Created in 1980 (two years before Loring's death), it resembled "Billy" in its 
imaginative expansion of realistic gestures into formal dance motifs, in its 
emphasis upon processional movement and individuals set against a corps, in the 
theme of a collective destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Danced to Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celeste, it developed this 
premise through situational rather than narrative structures: episodes for up 
to 15 dancers expressing wild anguish and equally desperate hope. A brooding, 
masterfully crafted work, it deserves to be better known. 
</P>
<P>
The evening also offered a shaky but promising run-through of Bournonville's 
"Flower Festival" pas de deux and two works by faculty choreographers: "Sing, 
Sing, Sing" (Donna France's slick, Broadway-style tap extravaganza to music by 
Duke Ellington) and "Nightfall" (Dianne Howe's weighty study of layered, formal 
choric motion to an original score by Paul Hodgins). 
</P>
<P>
The most accomplished of the student dancers included Eileen Ordonez (the 
Mother/Sweetheart in "Billy"), Erin Holmes (the leader in "Time Unto Time") and 
Peter Duerr (prominent in both Loring ballets). Canned music accompanied all 
the dances except "Nightfall." The program continues through Saturday. LEWIS
