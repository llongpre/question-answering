When the Joffrey Ballet returns to San Diego tonight for a four-performance run 
at the Civic Theatre, it will be a homecoming of sorts for the company and an 
opportunity for San Diego balletomanes to renew an ongoing love affair with the 
first world-class dance troupe to include the city on its regular touring 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Joffrey started here (with the San Diego Foundation for the Performing Arts) 
the same year it started the bicoastal arrangement with Los Angeles, so we've 
had a special bond since 1983," said Suzanne Townsend of San Diego 
Performances, local sponsors of the Joffrey. "After the glitz and glamour of 
L.A., and all the rigors of touring, they like to come here. It's like a safe 
haven." 
</P>
<P>
"We've always loved dancing in San Diego," said Joffrey artistic director 
Gerald Arpino by telephone from Houston. "Our romance with 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is an extension of our bicoastal commitment, and the audiences are 
wonderful to us." 
</P>
<P>
When Joffrey began its association with San Diego, Townsend and Danah Fayman 
were the dynamic duo who made it happen. Their pioneer efforts to package 
big-league dance as a series in San Diego are "very special" because of the 
scale and scope of their undertaking, Arpino said. 
</P>
<P>
What's on tap from the Joffrey this week? 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the Joffrey to do an all-Diaghilev evening because that 
reconstruction was so important to Robert Joffrey," said Townsend, who prides 
herself on taking an active role in selecting the repertory shown in San Diego. 
"The company wasn't here last year when it was their major artistic purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, a Diaghilev program is the centerpiece of this visit. Among the 
treasures on the historic program are "L'Apres Midi d'Un Faune" and "Le Sacre 
du Printemps," both by Vaslav Nijinsky, and Leonide Massine's "Parade." All 
three works are San Diego premieres, scheduled for 8 p.m. performances 
Wednesday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's mix (repeated at 2 p.m. Friday) will feature the local debut of 
Eugene Loring's classic, "Billy the Kid," Frederick Ashton's "Monotones II," 
and a pair of works by Arpino never seen in San Diego before: "Sea Shadow" and 
"Viva Vivaldi." 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot of shuffling, but you need to be thinking about growth when you 
plan the programs," Arpino said. 
</P>
<P>
Because he likes to think of his troupe as a catalyst for growth in regional 
dance, Arpino was ecstatic to learn that local troupe Three's Company will make 
its maiden appearance in New York this week, and that newcomers like Malashock 
and Company are emerging on the San Diego dance scene. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why Bob (the late founding director, Robert Joffrey) and I accepted the 
arrangement," Arpino said, referring to the troupe's getting involved with San 
Diego or any community. "Our vision has always been bigger than the company. 
It's about the American dance scene. It had to be." The company was created by 
the only two American directors of a major American ballet company, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe is dedicating this season to Robert Joffrey, who died in March, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Joffrey will enter into an agreement that will keep the company on 
the West Coast for six more weeks each year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had friends at Cal State (Los Angeles) for years," Arpino said, "and 
recently the chancellor, said, 'What if I could offer you a residency here?' So 
they built a magnificent studio for us on campus, and we'll be mounting new 
works there. We won't be working with the students, but they'll have the 
ability to observe and learn and study -- and we'll have the ability to work 
without disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked in Iowa (at the University of Iowa) for four weeks, and we were able 
to mount our 'Nutcracker.' Of course, they helped underwrite it. It's a 
tremendous gift." 
</P>
<P>
As Arpino sees it, this kind of kinship with a university can be a boon to 
under-funded dance troupes. 
</P>
<P>
"Joffrey is always a pathfinder, looking for new ways of raising money for 
dance companies," he said. "Once the smaller companies see us doing it, it 
starts to catch on."
