<TEXT>     Atkinson and John Bolander, who was captured a week after the escape, fled
from the jail with the infamous Brett Miller, a young Watsonville man depicted
by some as a modern Billy the Kid. Miller, 26, who was being held on various
charges ranging from cattle rustling to kidnapping, is still at large.;   
Bolander, 35, was captured June 21 by Watsonville police, who found him hiding
in a local home after they received an anonymous tip about his whereabouts. He
was jailed on a child- molestation charge at the time of the escape.;    The
escape was Miller's second from the county jail near downtown Santa Cruz and
his third from custody in Santa Cruz County.  </TEXT>
