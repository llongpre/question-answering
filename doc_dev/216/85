KALEIDOSCOPE REVIVED AT CAL STATE L.A.

To the isolated, nomadic dancers and choreographers of Southern California, 
Dance Kaleidoscope has become an annual gathering of the clans -- a chance to 
display individual achievement in the context of a community showcase. 
</P>
<P>
For eight years, starting in 1979, the performance series survived its unwieldy 
grab-bag format and wildly fluctuating standards of quality control only to 
vanish with the collapse of its sponsor: the Los Angeles Area Dance Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Cal State L.A., a blue-ribbon selection panel and the city's Department 
of Performing Arts, all working to reconstitute Dance Kaleidoscope as a 
three-program (six-performance) event spread across two weekends. As before, 
the focus is on presenting up-and-coming artists: 24 soloists and groups who 
need a stage. The event no longer takes place at the John Anson Ford Theatre -- 
but that venue was never exactly ideal for dance and, anyway, who needs more 
summer traffic in Cahuenga Pass? 
</P>
<P>
The important thing is that the new, on-campus location, the city money, the 
uniform audition process and the shared commitment to excellence have made no 
difference whatsoever. Dance Kaleidoscope re-emerged over the weekend exactly 
as it used to be: flagrantly, gloriously uneven, boasting some dancers that 
only a mother could love and choreography that amounted to budget knockoffs of 
the era's most celebrated innovations. 
</P>
<P>
On Program A, Saturday night, Naomi Goldberg's new, ad hoc Los Angeles Modern 
Dance and Ballet Company perfectly caught the gestalt of the event with the 
playful Baroque suite "Looking in a Fishtank," in which people of nearly every 
possible age, race, sex, physical condition and level of expertise executed the 
same movement tasks in a procession resembling the epic winning-of-the-West 
sequences from "Billy the Kid." Welcome to the new frontier: dancing as 
variegated as the Los Angeles audience. 
</P>
<P>
This endearing throwback to the anyone-can-dance phase of early minimalism 
found its complement in the sensational contact-style duet that opened the 
lumpy genre piece "Dawg Tired and Dirty," with Karen Johnson boldly lifting and 
swinging Steven Craig as if declaring her emancipation from societal partnering 
stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Liberation of another sort informed Stephanie Gilliland's solo "Sticks and 
Fall," in which involvement in music and formal movement process seemed to 
bring the dancer close to a personal breakthrough -- a mode of direct, 
instinctual expression beyond performing. It didn't happen Saturday, but the 
attempt provided the only genuine risk and experiment on the program. 
</P>
<P>
Recently reviewed, Ferne Ackerman's finely crafted group piece "Flame" looked 
hectic and oversold at this performance, just as Andor Czomp's fluent 
Herdsman's Dance ("Ecsegi Kanasztanc") for Karpatok Hungarian Folk Ensemble 
proved curiously flat. Even more disappointing: the insensitive and often 
unmotivated dancing by California Theatre Ballet of "Sunflowers," the late 
Antony Tudor's masterful 1971 study of shifting emotional alliances. 
</P>
<P>
Though Young-Ae Park's "Da'Mong" (Dream Layers) began in tantalizing 
processional vignettes, it soon dumped dance altogether to emphasize 
play-acting cliches. Still, the solo at least had Park's technical skill and 
concentration to recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
During intermission, the Katja Biesanz Dance Theatre presented the modest, 
whimsical "Chagall's Circus" on a small platform stage outdoors. Problematic 
visibility alone made this a dubious innovation in Kaleidoscope tradition, 
though the piece's artful costumes and body masks (especially the gleaming 
fish) certainly looked alluring close-up in the moonlight.
