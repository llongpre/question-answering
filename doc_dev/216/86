   Despite a more grown-up role as cowboy Newt
in the acclaimed CBS miniseries ``Lonesome Dove,'' Rick Schroder is
still struggling with a transition from his child star status to
adult roles.
   ``So it's hard,'' said Schroder. ``A lot of people say it can
never be done successfuly. Natalie Wood did it. Maybe a few other
actors.''
   Schroder was 8 when he made his film debut in 1979 opposite Jon
Voight in a remake of ``The Champ,'' then spent five years playing
a rich kid in the comedy series ``Silver Spoons.''
   On Sunday, in the CBS movie ``Out on the Edge,'' he plays a
troubled teen-ager who is sent against his will to an institution.
   ``Making the transition is not easy,'' he said. ``In fact, it's
pretty hard. But it's getting easier with each new role. Everything
since `Silver Spoons' has been a role that's helped me grow up. I'm
being taken more seriously for adult roles. I don't want to be 30
and still playing high-school kids.''
   Schroder has been passed over for a few roles that went to older
actors.
   ``I went up for a role in a movie with Robert De Niro called
`The Freshman,''' he said. ``The script calls for a 19-year-old,
which is my age. They cast Matthew Broderick. He's got to be 30. I
said, that's not fair, and it's not realistic.''
   He'd also wanted the lead role in ``Gore Vidal's Billy the Kid''
on Turner Network Television. It went to the older Val Kilmer.
   Mention the names of child stars such as Elizabeth Taylor and
Mickey Rooney who went on to adult careers in show business, and
Schroder says, ``I'm talking about actors. Those are celebrities.''
   In the CBS movie, Schroder plays Danny Evetts, 17, who is
committed to a behavioral treatment center when his divorced mother
is unable to control him.
   The movie also stars Maya Lebenzon as a young patient who
befriends Danny, Mary Kay Place as Danny's mother, Richard Jenkins
as his father and Dakin Matthews as the hospital administrator.
   ``This is a good role for me because I get to be bad,'' said
Schroder. ``I usually play such angelic roles. In this one, I'm
really messed up. Danny's a good guy. He's not a jerk or nothing.
But he's got problems he doesn't know how to deal with. He starts
to hurt himself and those around him.''
   Schroder has let his blond hair grow long and has grown a wispy
beard for an expected role as a basketball player and cocaine
addict. He also had to lose 20 pounds.
   The end of ``Lonesome Dove'' looked like a good jumping-off
place for a story about Newt, and that apparently wasn't lost on
Schroder. He said that on a recent visit to New York he talked to
CBS officials about doing a sequel to ``Lonesome Dove.'' No story
has been drawn up, but it probably would include Woodrow Call
(Tommy Lee Jones) finally owning up to the fact that he is Newt's
father.
   Schroder said he's also writing a CBS Schoolbreak Special about
two young people who fall in love. The boy has a severe case of
acne, and the girl was burned in a fire. They help heal each other
emotionally. He hopes to direct it.
   ``I've never had a directing credit, but I've directed before,''
he said. ``You direct scenes you're in. Sometimes you work with a
director you don't think is good or you don't like. You do your own
thing.''
   Schroder began acting in New York and appeared in more than 45
commercials before ``The Champ.''
   ``Talk about your life changing overnight,'' he said. ``It all
happened so quickly. My sister had also done some commercials, and
I was following in her footsteps. She's now studying to become a
screenwriter at the University of Southern California. I'd like to
take some courses, too, but I don't want take out time to go to
college.''
