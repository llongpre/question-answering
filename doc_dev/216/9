THE FILM: "Young Guns II" 
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE: Billy the Kid, played with gusto by Emilio Estevez, is chased across 
the New Mexico desert by Pat Garrett (played by William Petersen), formerly a 
cattle-rustling compatriot and now a well-dressed sheriff. It's the same old 
story with a sex-appeal spin. Billy's accompanied on this chase to the death by 
his band of Regulators -- Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christian 
Slater (pictured), Balthazar Getty and Alan Ruck. They are the Team 
Testosterone. Their down-and-dirty appeal is enhanced by Dean Semler, the 
director of photography, who knows a few things about heroically depicting 
renegades, having done the "Mad Max" trilogy, and backed with songs by Jon Bon 
Jovi, who is no slouch when it comes to stirring young women into a fever of 
lust.

<P>
THE LOOK: Estevez, Getty and Ruck are dressed prairie style -- bowler hats, 
lumpy wool pants, suspenders, muslin shirts and worn-out boots. Slater's 
character is an aspiring outlaw, Dave Rudabaugh, who would like the same 
notoriety as the Kid. He makes up for his lack of billing by strutting around 
in bad guy-black suede pants and a Stetson (pictured). Sutherland's Doc 
Scurlock wears a period tweed suit that evolves from natty to nasty as his 
character declines from poet and teacher to desperate gunslinger. Phillips as 
Chavez y Chavez wears an ethnic mix that reflects the character's 
Mexican-Indian heritage -- ponchos, feathers and a shearling vest that looks 
decidely as if it was tanned at home, in the tepee.

The fashion victim of the film is Pat Garrett. He is given 50% of his bounty 
payment for capturing the Kid up-front and the first thing he does with his 
new-found wealth is buy new clothes. And such splendid clothes he buys: a black 
ottomon overcoat and a pinstripe three-piece suit. The vest even has jeweled 
buttons. Costume designer Judy Ruskin explained his peacock style, saying: "In 
my research, I found Pat Garrett was quite a fashion plate. He was always very 
well dressed and incredibly vain." 
</P>
<P>
THE LABELS: Ruskin had almost all of the wardrobe for the principals custom 
made, although some of the accessories were bought off the rack. Estevez's 
suspenders are from Perry Ellis Menswear and Getty's are from Cole-Haan. The 
black cowboy hat that Christian Slater wears carries the Outback Trading Co. 
label. Estevez's long-john shirt was also bought and then customized with a 
muslin placket for period authenticity.

THE PAYOFF: So what if "Young Guns II" is a heavy-metal version of the 48-times 
told tale of Billy the Kid? These guys are a visual delight. GAILE ROBINSON
