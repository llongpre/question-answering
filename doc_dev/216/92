Frank Sinatra, Tracy Chapman, Billy Idol and the Bolshoi Ballet will be among 
the acts this year at the Pacific Amphitheatre, according to a schedule 
released Tuesday by the Nederlander Organization, which books and manages the 
18,764-capacity facility. 
</P>
<P>
The venue's season got off to an early start March 3 with a Tom Petty and the 
Heartbreakers concert. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule includes: comedian Andrew Dice Clay on April 25; Eric Clapton on 
May 4; the second annual Pacific Jazz Festival on May 19; Tracy Chapman with 
South Africa's Johnny Clegg &amp; Savuka on May 26; Little Feat on June 3; the 
Benson and Hedges Blues Fest on June 9, and UB40 on July 6. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be: the Allman Brothers Band on Aug. 3; the Judds and Highway 
101 on Aug. 4; the Bolshoi Ballet on Aug. 25 and 26; the Moody Blues on Aug. 
30; K.T. Oslin and Ricky Van Shelton on Sept. 7; Frank Sinatra on Sept. 8; the 
Beach Boys on Sept. 9; the previously announced New Kids on the Block Sept 12 
and 13; Julio Iglesias on Sept. 22, and James Taylor on Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Idol has been signed to appear, but a date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Pacific Jazz Festival and the Benson and Hedges blues event will have 
a mid-afternoon start time. The former will feature the Duke Ellington 
Orchestra led by Mercer Ellington; David Benoit; Larry Carlton; Diane Schuur; 
Andy Narell; Keiko Matsui; Airto and Flora Purim with Dave Valentin, and the 
Timeless All Stars with Billy Childs, Billy Higgins, Bobby Hutcherson, Harold 
Land, Julian Priester and Buster Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The blues show will feature Stevie Ray Vaughan and Joe Cocker, with the rest of 
the roster to be announced April 26. According to its producer, Darlene Chan, 
the lineup will represent blues music from "traditional to pop rock." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for some of the shows, including the jazz festival and the Clapton and 
Clay dates, already have gone on sale. Others go on sale today but only as part 
of a subscription series (call (714) 646-0850 for information). The Pacific 
will announce upcoming general sale dates and will be adding other performers 
through the season. 
</P>
<P>
The small number of contemporary rock acts in the current schedule only 
reflects the tendency of those acts to book their tours later in the season, 
Nederlander publicist Laura Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
The lowest price this season for reserved orchestra seats is $24.75, compared 
to $20.35 for some shows last year. The highest ticket prices this year are for 
the Bolshoi Ballet, which tops out at $55, and the Sinatra show at $50.
