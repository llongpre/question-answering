Are you sitting comfortably? Then off we go. The rattle of horses and traps;
the swish of Edwardian dresses; the tinkle of tea cups; the sight of great
British actors rolling up their sleeves to tackle Great English Literature.
It must be - it is - another Merchant-Ivory adaptation of EM Forster. With
Howards End the producer-director team continue their tradition of treading
angelically where other fools might rush in. Their new film, like A Room
With A View and Maurice, is a triumph of wit and delicacy, of non-obsequious
faithfulness to Forster and of mind over narrative maze.
Howards End, Forster's last major work to be filmed, is a novel with Laocoon
plot coils: the tale of two German-born sisters boldly bearing the banners
of art and moral idealism into the philistine Wilcox family. Margaret
Schlegel (Emma Thompson) befriends the dying Mrs Wilcox (Vanessa Redgrave)
and later marries wealthy widower Henry (Anthony Hopkins). Helen Schlegel
(Helena Bonham Carter), after a brief coup de foudre with young Paul,
declares war on the whole clan when her bank-clerk friend Leonard is ruined
by some casual bad advice from Henry.
But let us not strangle ourselves with plot. For Forster, these events were
narrative tracery hung on a vast arboreal structure of themes concerning art
and humanity. The novel begins with an exposition of Beethoven's 5th
symphony; goes on to baptise that mantric phrase for our time, 'Only
connect'; and sees in its tale of two families a fable about prose versus
passion.
Director James Ivory and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala skip the mantric
phrase and turn the Beethoven passage into a few seconds of knockabout
lecturing by a mad musicologist (Simon Callow). Probably wise. A film is not
a novel, and abstractions like Prose and Passion must be incarnated in real
People.
Here Ivory's cast excels. Vanessa Redgrave, possessed of a seraphic
intensity not seen since the Delphic Sybil, spreads a glow over the early
scenes. She persuades you of her passion for Howards End - the house
talismanically tussled over throughout the book - and her staring-eyed
legato manner is a counterpoint to Hopkins's brusque, emotionally evasive
staccato. Misses Thompson and Bonham Carter make a matching counterpoint:
the first all grace, vivacity and anxious compromise, the second a Dresden
shepherdess turned disappointed romantic who hurls emotional darts from her
black-browed eyes.
The film sometimes slides towards cliche. Every Edwardian Summer gets its
rowing scene, but an idyllic river is the last place to stage Helen and
Leonard's doom-laden mutual seduction. And the music is somewhat
wall-to-wall, as if composer Richard Robbins had been bitten by Philip
Glass. But minor pains like this set off the major pleasure of the whole.
Merchant-Ivory again confound critics ready to deal out the 'lace-hankie'
insults. Their best films, far from being cinema's answer to Emily Post, are
prismatic visions of past times coloured, ironised and toughened by a modern
sensibility.
Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon is about the urban crises that happen around
us daily. You know the kind of thing. You set out to see, say, a new James
Ivory film at your local Odeon and on the way are attacked by muggers,
accosted by Jehovah's Witnesses and shot in the leg by a runaway bank
robber.
These and similar things happen to LA business executive Kevin Kline; and/or
to wife Mary McDonnell, film producer pal Steve Martin and black tow-truck
driver Danny Glover, whom Kline befriends in scene one after being rescued
by him from a band of inner-city thugs.
Kasdan's film is so all-inclusive that it resembles a Which? report on urban
survival. It also has a sickly, messagey ending when the cast gaze out over
the real Grand Canyon and wonder at the beauty of Nature's great divide as
opposed to the great divides that humans place between themselves and -
blah, blah, blah, we get the point.
No need of this to crown a film that displays at best a lithe and likable
wit and a fresco-like breadth. Kasdan, wearing his social anatomist's hat
(The Big Chill) rather than his genre practitioner's (Body Heat, Silverado),
gives us characters pierced through with quiet desperation. Kline's
middle-aged yuppie, guiltily flirting with his nervous-eyed secretary (Mary
Louise Parker), is as much overdue for spiritual counselling as his wife,
who wants to keep the abandoned baby she has found in a park while jogging
there.
Even more of a stretcher-case - literally - is film-maker Steve Martin. He
is shot in the leg by a mugger. Contrite, thoughtful, his limb in plaster,
Martin renounces all idea of returning to the blood-and-gore movies he once
lived off. Then, recovering, he changes his mind.
This too short cameo is the satirical jewel of the film. Kasdan should have
tipped the balance towards him and away from the racial harmony subplot
between Kline and trucker Glover. This is scored for maudlin,
make-the-world-better dialogue worthy of The Cosby Show. But the film, 2 1/2
hours long, pounds persuasively on even over its own potholes and presents
an LA far more convincing than the brainless Lotusland usually immortalised
for us by its denizens.
Mobsters: The Evil Empire tries to do for the truth-based gangster film what
Young Guns did for the Western. For young Billy the Kid read young Lucky
Luciano (Christian Roberts), Meyer Lansky (Patrick Dempsey) and Bugsy Siegel
(Richard Grieco). Growing up from delinquent childhood into arrested
adolescence, these glamorised psychotics carve up New York's organised crime
industry even as they carve up, more literally, their enemies.
In this sepia-hued would-be epic directed by ex-commercials whiz kid Michael
Karbelnikoff, cheeks are slashed, noses bitten off and craniums pierced by
ice picks. A thousand bullets puncture twitching bodies in saunas or
restaurants. A man is dangled from a penthouse before plunging to his death.
(We hear the final crunch, splat).
As if this were not enough for impressionable filmgoers, we have Michael
Gambon sauntering onto screen with an Italian accent: 'When ah keem frahm
Seecily . . .' But Gambon is the most magnetic thing around as a pouchy-eyed
crime kingpin, closely followed by rival capo Anthony Quinn, roaring like a
wounded bull over every tableful of pasta he consumes or destroys. The
younger actors never match the older and there lies the rub. The film is
like watching 'Bugsy Malone: The Next Generation' as, amid the
Godfather-surplus sets, Hollywood's newest brat pack demonstrates it is
marginally duller than the old one and infinitely duller than the veterans
showing off around them.
Ricochet, a crime thriller from director Russell Mulcahy (Highlander), is
never dull even while it is silly. We do not believe one moment of this tale
about a cop (Denzel Washington) being pursued Cape Fear-style by a psycho
(John Lithgow) he once put behind bars. But we have a great deal of fun not
believing it. Especially when the finale defies both gravity and
plausibility atop LA's picturesque Watts Towers.
Or you may prefer Agnes Varda's Jacquot De Nantes. The French film-maker
assembles memories of her late husband, director Jacques Demy, and sticks
them into a moving photo album. Disporting on a beach in Super-8 is the
ageing Demy, grizzled veteran of Lola and Les Parapluies De Cherbourg.
Working behind the scenes to turn him into a fictionalised little boy,
playing in flashback with his first movie camera, is Mlle Varda. Deft,
delicate, touching.
