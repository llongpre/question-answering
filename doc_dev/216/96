BILLY CRYSTAL'S OSCAR joke angers Italians: Comedian Billy Crystal wasn't very 
funny when he "took a cheap shot" at Italians during Monday night's 62nd Annual 
Academy Awards telecast, two major Italian-American organizations charged 
today. 
</P>
<P>
In separate wires, the Coalition of Italo-American Organizations here and the 
National Italian American Foundation in Washington, D.C., charged that Billy 
insulted them when he joked that the proposed purchase of MGM by an Italian 
businessman would mean the famous lion would no longer roar but take the Fifth 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a cheap shot joke against Italian Americans," the Washington-based 
group wired Crystal. "There is a fine line between ethnic humor and negative 
stereotyping. We feel (you) crossed that line." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coalition Chairman William Fugazy said he'd been "inundated" with 
calls from his organization's membership.

NUMBER ONE: Barbara Walters doesn't know it yet but she's the first woman to be 
named recipient of the Lowell Thomas Award from Marist College in Poughkeepsie. 
She's on vacation in the Middle East until April 11. Previous winners include 
Walter Cronkite, Eric Severeid, David Brinkley and Howard K. Smith. The award 
will be presented at a luncheon on April 19 at the Helmsley Palace.

NIXON ON TAPE: Richard M. Nixon now says that he doesn't think he should have 
accepted a pardon from Gerald R. Ford because it was seen by many as an 
admission of guilt, the former President asserts in the three-hour recorded 
version of his new memoir "In the Arena." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon states: "In retrospect, I would say that Watergate was one part 
wrongdoing, one part blundering and one part political vendetta. By far, the 
hardest blow was the pardon. My primary reason for resigning was to avoid 
having a President of the United States in the dock for alleged illegal 
activities."

'GYPSY' TO GET new leading lady? There may be some "Gypsy" in Linda Lavin's 
soul. The Tony Award winner is at the front of the line to replace Tyne Daly in 
the starring role of the hit musical revival at the St. James. Daly is signed 
up until the end of July.
