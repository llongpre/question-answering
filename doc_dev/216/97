<LEADPARA>  YOU want to know how eager Dave Righetti was for spring training with the
Giants? He was so eager he made the ultimate sacrifice. All winter long, he
purposely played golf bare-handed, with no gloves.;    "I wanted to get my
palms callused and in shape to swing a bat," Righetti said Thursday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The corners of his mouth moved upward, slyly. Everyone knows the Giants did
not hire Righetti for his hitting. As a pitcher for 10 seasons with the New
York Yankees, who dwell in the designated hitter half of baseball, Righetti
never had to swing a bat. Now, he must.;    "I'm not one of those pitchers who
brags about hitting .400 in high school," he said. "When I wasn't pitching, I
was a skinny outfielder who could kind of punch it out there or bunt it.
That's all. Right now, when it comes to hitting, I'm mostly just trying not to
get hurt out there.";    Righetti chuckled. He had just finished his morning
workout. A white towel was draped around his neck in the Scottsdale Stadium
dugout. Life was good.;    Back in December, when Righetti cut his free agent
deal with the Giants, the fit seemed perfect. It still seems that way.
Righetti began his baseball life as a Pee-Wee League player at Lincoln Glen
Park in San Jose. Therefore, it only made sense that he should conclude his
career in the Bay Area. Righetti, at age 32, figures he has several years of
smart pitches remaining in his left arm.;    LEAVING behind the tumultuous
Yankees also can't hurt. Righetti's nouveau Arizona experience -- the Yankees
train in Florida -- has been just as free of humidity and controversy as he
had hoped. The workouts aren't much different.;    "It depended on the
manager, and we had a few of those while I was there," Righetti said. "Billy
Martin's camps were the best. You'd think he'd be very intense, but he didn't
believe in staying out there very long. He wanted pitchers to do their work
and go.;    "Billy was tougher on young kids, though," Righetti said. "The
whole place was tough if you were young. I look at a kid like (Giants rookie
catcher) Steve Decker. . . . If he was trying to make our club in New York,
he'd have no chance. The whole experience, the expectations would get to him.
. . . Hey, I went through it myself.";    Righetti's introduction to that
delightful Yankees gestalt occurred shortly after he was traded to New York as
a Texas Rangers minor leaguer in 1978. The Yankees' president at that time was
none other than Al Rosen, now president of the Giants.;    "The first thing Al
said was, 'We've just got the next Ron Guidry,' " Righetti recalled. "And I
thought, 'Oh, thanks.' ";    GUIDRY, at the time, was the Yankees' resident
flamethrower and a Cy Young winner. The New York media leaped like drooling
dogs at Rosen's statement, and Righetti responded by nearly throwing his arm
out of its socket.;    "I could throw my fastball 93 mph, so that's all I
did," Righetti said. "Those stupid radar guns are the worst thing for young
kids. If I'd kept it up, I would have really hurt my arm.";    He eventually
worked himself through that phase, however. And those extra pitches -- the
change-up, slider and curve -- also helped when his velocity began to slacken
a few years ago. Righetti may be slower, but he's smarter. Last season he
saved 36 games in 39 opportunities for the woeful Yankees.;    "On my good
days, I can still hit 93 mph, and on my bad days 88 mph," Righetti said. "Some
people might say I've fallen off. That's what happens when you set a high
standard. Funny, huh? If you're mediocre, people leave you alone your whole
life."  </TEXT>
