Viewers of KTLA's semiannual The Twilight Zone marathon will find much to keep 
them chained to their sets during 13 hours-22 episodes-of the series that begin 
at 9 a.m. on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Classic "Twilight Zone" irony is dished out in: "To Serve Man" (7:30 p...), in 
which aliens want to do more than just chew the fat with earthlings; "I Shot an 
Arrow Into the Air" (4:30 p.m.) about the desperation of a trio of lost 
astronauts, and "People Are Alike All Over" (noon), with a title that proves 
all too accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Evil lives in: "It's a Good Life" (7 p.m.), starring cute little Billy Mumy as 
an unholy terror; "The Howling Man" (1 p.m.), whom good people have a devil of 
a time trying to keep locked up, and "He's Alive" (2 p.m.), with Dennis Hopper 
as a neo-Nazi. 
</P>
<P>
A step into the future provides answers to a World War I coward who gets a 
second chance in "The Last Flight" (1:30 p.m.) and a 19th-century man heading 
West in "A Hundred Yards Over the Rim" (10 a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Soul-selling has unfortunate consequences for "Jess-Belle" (9 p.m.), a woman 
who makes a deal with a witch to win a man, and a newspaperman who hires a 
"Printer's Devil" (Burgess Meredith, 8 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Other typically heavy episodes are "The Purple Testament" (10:30 a.m.), a 
moving story of an Army lieutenant with a rare gift of sight, and "The Masks" 
(6 p.m.), about a group of unenviable heirs. 
</P>
<P>
The marathon lightens up with "Mr. Dingle, the Strong" (5 p.m.), starring 
Burgess Meredith again as a loser who gets a chance to be a big shot.
