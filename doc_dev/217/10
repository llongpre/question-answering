FT  05 DEC 94 / Labour reform plans for royal family prompt Tory outrage

Labour is drawing up a comprehensive constitutional reform package that
would cut the cost of the royal family and prevent ministers from using the
antiquated rules of crown privilege to bypass parliament.
The proposals prompted outrage from senior ministers, many of whom believe
the Conservatives would win a general election fought on constitutional
issues such as the role of the monarchy and the UK's place in Europe.
Labour's proposals, which will be given a preliminary airing tonight in a
BBC Panorama documentary on the monarchy, are being drawn up by a Commission
on Democracy that will report to the party's 1995 conference.
Initial attention is likely to focus on Labour's proposals for a big
reduction in the number of royals carrying out official functions, heralding
a smaller monarchy along Scandinavian lines.
However, the commission is also considering fundamental changes to the
sovereign's residual executive powers, most of which are in practice
exercised by ministers.
The powers include appointment of officials without reference to parliament,
making foreign treaties and binding regulations by executive order, and
exempting government activities from the law.
The democracy commission is also considering the practical implications of
Labour's plans to abolish the right of hereditary peers to vote in the House
of Lords, and to set up assemblies in Scotland, Wales and the English
regions.
It will also confirm Labour's plans for fixed parliaments and propose a new
bill of rights.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, accused Labour leaders of
'trying to placate their leftwing activists with constitutional reform -
downgrading the monarchy, splitting up the UK, subordinating Britain in
Europe.'
However, Mr Jack Straw, the shadow home secretary, said Labour was
contributing to a national debate prompted by public disgust at the
government's failure to uphold high standards of public behaviour.
