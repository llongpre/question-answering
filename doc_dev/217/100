The crown is still important, argues Hugh Dickinson, Dean of Salisbury

THE BULB was gone in the box room, so I had to clamber around in
semi-darkness to find the crown. Each year we dig it out from all the other
inherited junk which seems so useless and yet means so much. It was behind
the box with the seized-up vacuum cleaner and under the carton with the
Christmas tree lights. (Memo: test lights this year before entangling them
in spruce thicket.)
It is a tarnished hoop of filigree brass, part of a redundant electric
chandelier adapted many years ago for an epiphany procession. In fact, it is
far too wide for any human head, and slips down on to the shoulders of
anyone who tries to wear it. By candlelight on a velvet cushion carried by a
solemn child, it looks mysterious and majestic.
I sit at the kitchen table and get to work with the Brasso. My fingers grow
black but the brass begins to gleam like gold. I wonder if it is a magic
crown like Aladdin's lamp? If I rub hard enough will a smokey king
materialise from that empty 'O'? Would he be my royal servant, 'a brisk,
fond lackey to fetch and carry, a true free-hearted slave'? Or would I be
His Majesty's loyal and obedient servant? Risky. . .
Echoes of Shakespeare gather in the back of my memory. After all, this piece
is pure theatre. Shakespeare knew about royalty. Kings are countries; this
isle is sceptred. The monarch carries the land and its people in his soul.
'Upon the King] Let us our lives, our souls, our debts, our careful wives
lay on the King. He must bear all]'
The crown may give its wearer uneasy nights; death may keep his court there,
it encircles not only his head but his kingdom too and holds within its
hollow 'O' the hearts of all his subjects. Or hers, since that paragon of
absolute monarchy caught in the spotlight of Shakespeare's incandescent
imagination was Queen Elizabeth I.
But today, how much of all that heady chivalry and romantic royal ceremony
still holds the hearts and imaginations of the not so loyal subjects of E II
R, when chic hats are more in evidence than crowns? Much odious class
privilege and aristocratic arrogance is kept alive as a poisonous incubus
within the body politic with its tentacles around the not unsullied skirts
of the royal family. Should we sweep away all this royal farrago at the
beginning of a new millennium, admit that Tony Benn is right and elect Sir
Edward Heath the first president of the British Republic?
But something makes me pause. In spite of all the silly goings-on around the
palace, and in spite of the natural human frailty preyed on so pitilessly by
the carnivorous press, it may be that what we have is better than any
alternative purveyed by the republican faction. Inner and outer processes in
the personal and corporate psyche of our people are strangely entangled with
the crown and may contribute to the wholeness of the community in
subconscious but powerful ways. Is this a necessary part of our
self-identity? Was Shakespeare right?
People dream about the Queen. Not just a few, but, if the polls are right,
most people have significant encounters with their monarch. Jung or Freud
will no doubt tell us who she is standing in for in our unconscious world.
Whatever it is, there is some shared community of symbols, values and
longings deep down inside us which this particular ikon, the crown, serves
and represents.
Our society is rapidly losing the inheritance of shared symbols and values
which bind it together. That is - was - the function of religion. But now
'Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold'. The monarch is part of the
sacral centre, that mysterious system of rites and ceremonies which invests
a nation with continuity and without which chaos looms.
Can a president be that centre? Would we dream of Sir Ted? Of Nixon? Of
Amin? I think not (or only nightmares). We need the hollow 'O', a
non-political screen on to which the unconscious projections of a whole
people can be focused.
For that to happen, its wearer must have a certain simple integrity and be
not too clever, partisan or eloquent. Or divorced? Well, time has moved on.
The church might mutter but the public might see it as a sign of common
humanity. It is not just our corporate psyche which needs this outdated but
timeless ikon. Grotesquely the constitution needs it. This hollow 'O' is
constitutionally the precise equivalent of zero in mathematical
calculations.
To play solitaire, you need an empty space before any move can be made. Our
political system uses this empty 'O' as a space into which certain
transactions can be deposited to keep them free from political corruption.
Like the gold in Fort Knox, it legitimises the currency of power, although
it has no intrinsic value. We use a corporate myth to deposit in that sacral
vault the mandate for both our courts and our parliament.
The vulnerability of the Supreme Court in the US to political loading and
the corruption of the presidency should give us pause for thought. Be sure
to keep a hold of nurse for fear of getting something worse. Modernise, by
all means. Get out the Brasso. But pause before you wield the axe. Cromwell.
Remember?
Being British, of course, I think we will not make a decision to abolish the
monarchy. But deliberately or carelessly we may allow it to be eroded and
may not notice until too late what other parts of our heritage may be pulled
down with it when it falls.
I do not know whether the present heir to the throne will ever feel the
weight of this thing I am polishing up on his head, but I do know I feel a
profound moral shame to be part of a nation which can publicly dismember two
human beings and the naked gusto with which we have licked up their blood.
As one who has spent most of the past six years rescuing a priceless part of
our British identity from the effects of acid rain, my first instinct is to
start an appeal. But before that I must go over to the cathedral and
celebrate the arrival of three kings coming to lay their crowns at the feet
of the infant Christ. His was made of thorns. Remember?
