constitution should be used to give Britons the right to choose, through the
ballot box, their head of state

The British constitution, contrary to what is widely believed, is not an
unwritten one but is written down in detail in a network of personal oaths
of allegiance which are imposed on everyone who exercises any responsibility
in the state and binds them, individually, to the crown.
All MPs, peers, mayors, judges, officers, police officers and many others
are required to take such an oath.
Privy councillors, who include all cabinet ministers, have a special and
secret oath administered binding them even more tightly to the crown.
Bishops are required to pay homage to the crown and accept that the monarch
is the only source of 'ecclesiastical, spiritual and temporal power', while
at the coronation the only oath that the Queen gives is to defend the
protestant religion and uphold the rights of the bishops.
The monarchy actually consists of three separate and interlocking parts.
The first, and most public, is to be found in the person of the king or
queen. The Queen has a high profile and symbolises the nation in the minds
of the people, ever present and presiding over parliament and government but
nowadays possessing very few personal powers.
The real powers of the crown are exercised by the prime minister using the
royal prerogatives. These confer an immense amount of patronage, including
the power to make and unmake ministers, appoint peers and thousands of
public officials.
They also include the power to go to war and sign treaties, without the
consent of parliament, and it is under the prerogative power of
treaty-making that all the laws assented to by British ministers in Brussels
gain their legitimacy and override any domestic legislation that might
conflict with them.
The third and most mysterious aspect of the monarchy lies in the existence
of the crown as a legal fiction, for example, when members of the security
services are placed under a lifetime obligation of confidentiality to the
crown, which is a licence for them to do what they like without regard to
the law and then to keep quiet about it, making them a state within a state.
This structure dates back hundreds of years and the only real change came
recently - and from an unexpected source - British entry into the European
Union.
Under the Maastricht Treaty provisions, the Queen and Prince Charles have
become citizens of this union, reducing them to the same level as the rest
of us. Within the European Union, as it moves towards federalism, it is
obvious that many more public officials will be required to transfer their
personal allegiance to the union, as British commissioners have already had
to do.
All these aspects of a monarchical system of government are carefully
concealed beneath the public face of the king or queen of the day. Any
criticism of the system has been fended off by presenting it as an unfair
attack upon the person of the monarch.
So successful has this technique been that it is almost impossible for any
serious discussion to take place on how we might wish to be governed
Some time ago I introduced a Commonwealth of Britain bill which would give
the country a new and democratic constitution providing, among other things,
for the election of a president and disestablishment of the Church of
England.
This bill received a great deal of attention and is on the reading list for
some universities, but the problem has always been the method by which the
process of reform could be started.
For many years I have been working on a method that would make this
possible, intending to disclose it when the throne became vacant, and this
is how I realised that it could be done.
When a sovereign dies or abdicates the successor has to be proclaimed king
or queen and that proclamation, which is then read out in public in various
parts of the country, is the legal basis upon which the new monarch rests
for his or her authority.
This proclamation is agreed at a meeting of the Privy Council, held at St
James's Palace, and the key words in it are as follows:
'We, therefore . . . do now, hereby, with one voice and consent of tongue
and heart publish and proclaim . . .'
This proclamation is then signed by all those present.
There could hardly be a clearer or more precise legal statement of the
requirement of unanimity - and it is virtually identical with the same
principle which applies in the Council of Ministers of the European Union
when the president of the commission has to be appointed.
A few days ago, the prime minister was vigorously defending his use of that
unanimity rule to block the appointment of the Belgian prime minister and
this was one of the reasons why I decided to make my proposal public, by
writing to the Lord President of the Council.
The other reason for doing so was the decision of the Prince of Wales to
recommend the disestablishment of the Church of England, which I have long
advocated, and which would have the most profound constitutional
implications.
If the proclamation of the Prince of Wales as king can be delayed by one
privy councillor registering an objection, then the matter would have to be
referred back to parliament, as it was in 1688 when parliament offered the
throne to William III.
My purpose in all this is very simple and straightforward and involves no
personal criticism of the Prince of Wales.
It is to offer this country a chance to adopt a democratic constitution that
would give everyone the right to choose, through the ballot box, their head
of state and both houses of parliament, as happens in every modern
democracy.
It is my conviction that the problems that face Britain can only be tackled
if we throw off the shackles of feudalism and start to have confidence in
ourselves.
