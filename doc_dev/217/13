of constitution

THE QUEEN would no longer have the power to appoint the prime minister under
a programme for radical constitutional change approved by the conference
yesterday.
Delegates voted overwhelmingly for a wide-ranging motion stipulating that
the prime minister should be elected by an overall majority of the House of
Commons. It also called for the abolition of the royal prerogative which
enables the Queen, acting on the advice of her ministers, to declare war or
sign treaties with foreign governments without the prior approval of
parliament.
While postponing to next year a debate on whether the monarchy should be
abolished, the conference voted to change the law governing the right of
succession to the throne. The Liberal Democrats want to allow the eldest
child of the reigning monarch - whether male or female - to succeed to the
throne. Another change approved by the conference would permit a Roman
Catholic to assume the throne.
Calls for the introduction of referendums which would be binding on
parliament were defeated, but delegates agreed that there should be advisory
referendums.
Newly created regional assemblies, local councils and, as at present,
parliament would be able to stage referendums on controversial issues.
Provision was also made for citizens' referendums to be held when called for
by a stipulated number of voters. Other fundamental changes included in the
programme for were:
A new bill of rights entrenched with a written constitution and upheld by a
Supreme Court.
Home rule for Scotland and Wales, and regional assemblies in England. An
elected second chamber to replace the House of Lords representing Britain's
regions and nations.
The reformed chamber to include a minority of unelected non-voting members
chosen to reflect wider expertise and experience.
The introduction of the single transferable vote system of proportional
representation for all elections.
