FT  12 FEB 93 / Queen will pay taxes on personal income

THE QUEEN and the Prince of Wales are to pay tax on their personal income
'in the same way as every other taxpayer', Mr John Major announced
yesterday.
For the first time, the sovereign will also be liable for capital gains tax
and inheritance tax, with the important exception that inheritance tax will
not apply to the transfer of assets from the Queen to her successor.
The prime minister emphasised the move was at the Queen's initiative. It was
announced in principle in November after public unease over the cost and
behaviour of the royal family.
Lord Airlie, Lord Chamberlain and head of the Queen's household, said the
move would place a 'considerable additional burden' on the Queen's finances.
He said the Queen had acted to ensure the monarchy developed with the times,
particularly during a period of recession. The recent emphasis on royal
wealth had tended to obscure the Queen's contribution to national life, and
this - not the embarrassing publicity surrounding the Queen's children - had
prompted the change.
Commenting on estimates of her private funds ranging from Pounds 100m to
billions of pounds, Lord Airlie said: 'Her majesty has authorised me to say
that even the lowest of these estimates is grossly overstated.'
The prospect of a continental European-style monarchy appears to have
receded. Lord Airlie said the additional costs could 'be met without
compromising the standards and style which are expected of the Queen'. Tory
MPs urged that the change should not amount to a 'cut-price' sovereign.
The new arrangements, set out in a memorandum between the Queen and the
government, follow months of talks between the Treasury, the Inland Revenue
and the Royal Household.
In his Commons statement, Mr Major said the exact tax figures would be kept
secret, but tax would be levied initially at 25 per cent and later at 40 per
cent on the income the Queen used for private purposes.
The arrangements on inheritance tax disturbed some MPs. But Mr Major said
they were needed to protect the monarchy from the risk of the sovereign's
assets being 'salami-sliced' through successive generations.
