president will meet Queen Elizabeth II today / A look at the royal visit

When Queen Elizabeth meets Mr Boris Yeltsin, on her first state visit to
Russia which starts today, she will be greeting a man who is certainly the
last of his line. No future president of Russia will be a former member of
the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
Mr Yeltsin has fought hard to avoid the fate of being 'the Queen of
England', as the decorative presidency to which the former Supreme Soviet of
Russia wished to confine him was popularly known in Russian political
circles.
But in that struggle, which reached its climax a year ago, he exhausted
himself, unable now to muster the consistent energy needed to build
institutions of democracy. That leaves him occupying one of the most
powerful presidential chairs in the world without the appetite or will to
use its power in a way which will fully meet the challenges which press on
him.
From the Queen's point of view, the timing of the publication of Prince
Charles's authorised biography has cast an unfortunate shadow over the
beginning of her visit. That is not the only potential embarrassment. The
last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II, and the Tsarina Alexandra, both close
relatives of the Queen's grandfather George V, were killed on Lenin's
personal orders.
Mr Yeltsin, in his Bolshevik period, levelled the house in Ekaterinburg
where the Tsar's family met their deaths, in order to remove its potential
as a shrine and presumably to advance his career.
The bodies were buried in roadside graves from which they were exhumed only
after the end of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: they have not yet
been reburied, though are due to be, in the Peter and Paul Fortress in
Petersburg, which the Queen will visit.
The last Russian royal family is thus unlikely to come up as a subject of
conversation between the toasts.
Mr Charles Anson, the Queen's press secretary, said yesterday the issue had
been discussed at diplomatic level but 'the question of the reburial of the
Russian royal family and the Queen's visit are entirely separate issues'.
Though President Yeltsin has made at different times before different
audiences denunciations of communism and has apologised directly to the
Japanese for Soviet treatment of their prisoners of war, he has not alluded
publicly to the circumstances of the Tsar's death. Russia is not and perhaps
cannot be a penitent nation as Germany has been.
The British royal house also has a historical black spot which may inhibit
it from pressing the matter. King George V, a man who professed Nicholas II
to be a close friend as well as a relative and so like him physically as to
seem in photographs more a twin than a cousin, personally refused the Tsar's
family visas.
Professor Dominic Lieven, in his biography of Nicholas, says 'the King
 .took the lead in closing off the possibilities of asylum ..fearful of
reaction from British socialists and the labour movement, King George did
not want his dynasty to be associated in the public eye with the hated and
now fallen Russian Tsar, let alone with his half-English wife.'
Awkwardness of a different kind now attends Queen Elizabeth II as she, a
British monarch, comes to Russia for the first time. Still, the visit of
western Europe's most prominent constitutional monarch serves the purpose of
highlighting President Yeltsin's crowning achievement.
Like Mr Mikhail Gorbachev before him, he has realised, in what has been, for
both men, the greatest test of their erratic but high courage, that it is
not possible to take refuge for any length of time in the mailed fist.
The process which Mr Yeltsin inherited from Mr Gorbachev roars on; he rules
over it a little more than the Queen rules over her kingdom, but not much.
