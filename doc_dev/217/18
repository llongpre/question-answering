message to his future subjects - but has it fallen on sympathetic ears

Prince Charles has just found safe haven aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia,
anchored, possibly for the last time, in the Pool of London. It is 100 years
since his great-great-grandfather opened Tower Bridge and the present heir
to the throne has returned from the anniversary celebrations. 'At least I
didn't fall in', he chuckles, acknowledging the potential for more,
extraordinary headlines.
The news media have already given saturation coverage to the previous
night's television documentary in which, before an audience of 13m, he
confessed his adultery, mused on the links between church and crown and
conformed to his own caricature as a thoughtful man trapped by destiny but
compelled to prove his worth.
If the avalanche of publicity and 'expert' opinion had rattled him, the
prince who remains calm under fire (witness the little contretemps with a
pistol-waving student in Sydney's Tumbalong Park) was showing no signs of it
aboard the yacht whose fate at least has been decreed.
Any Lord of the Isles who can prang his 'whisper' jet into a Scottish peat
bog as he did this week, adjust his cufflinks and stick to his schedule is
not going to be shot down by a press he says is hooked on 'prurient
speculation'.
On Britannia, where he urges his guests to 'make the best of it', he is
relaxed, smiles through a healthy tan and shows no hint of what a supportive
Bishop of Durham was this week moved to describe as a 'sinful and struggling
man'.
Immediately ahead of Charles lies a low-key weekend in Wales - today he
visits a Rhondda rugby club - to celebrate 25 years as Prince of Wales. He
knew the anniversary would trigger renewed questioning about his suitability
to be the next king and, in a risky move, decided to present his own case on
film. He has no regrets about the final product and knows that, for the most
part, it will merely endorse the views of those who oppose or support him.
The prince hopes that when the brouhaha over his infidelity has died down,
people will be left with a rounded impression of a man doing his best for
'jolly old Britain' in a job he would not have chosen but which he must
ensure changes with the times.
But while the documentary, with its exhaustive, intimate exposure of a man
who loves every tree and stone but who imagines each one conceals a
tele-photo lens, may have been designed as a definitive response to the
critics, it has inevitably raised as many questions as it has answered.
If the exercise was regarded as an important step in the campaign to restore
his badly-damaged public image and reinforce his claim to be crowned King
Charles III, did it help or hinder him?.
His readiness to be grilled on the most intimate and painful aspects of his
life, like some disgraced Hollywood giant seeking renewed adulation through
abject confession, at once renewed the controversy over whether the British
monarchy's best chance of survival lies in retaining some mystique or in
riding bicycles in St James's Park.
Prince Charles' view is self-evident from his decision to make the
programme. 'Who are all these people who speak for me?', he despaired on
camera. The best response, he decided, was to do his own talking. 'There is
no sense it has backfired. He's said what he wanted to say and he won't be
doing it again', an aide volunteered.
Many would welcome a long silence. 'I'm for a little bit more mystery
surrounding the royal family', says Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the
Institute of Directors. 'I think is it extraordinary that we know much more
about Prince Charles than we do about Margaret Thatcher.'
'Ridiculous decision', claims a senior Tory peer: 'The publicity surrounding
the family's problems was all dying down anyhow and he has re-ignited it. He
said himself we have no right to know everything and he should never have
been exposed in that way.'
His Lordship may be out of touch. Early polls suggest that the prince's
decision to bare all has gone down quite well with the general public, which
is still in favour of a monarchy and which does not appear unduly worried
about having an adulterer on the throne. The Daily Mirror's front-page
banner headline - 'Poll Exclusive - Not Fit to Reign' - omitted to mention
that though one-third of its readership believed Charles should be denied
the crown, two-thirds said he should be king.
His personal performance has won support even among some republicans: 'If we
must have a monarch, then I suppose there is nothing wrong with a rather
curious, inquiring screwball doing the job. If we have to have one, then
let's have him', says Prof Richard Hoggart, the author and historian who
believes monarchy perpetrates patronage, sentimentality and contempt. He
adds: 'It is all based on the idea that you must give the little people
something to wave at. But I accept that the great bulk of the public still
want to press on with a monarchy.'
Prof Hoggart, who refuses invitations to Buckingham Palace, thinks Charles
has managed to project himself as a 'dignified, well-intentioned human being
who is not an intellectual but has a lively, intelligent mind'.
Helena Kennedy, QC, chancellor of Oxford Brookes University and an advocate
of constitutional change, agrees with Prof Hoggart that the British public
is not unduly perturbed by the fact that the prince's marriage has broken up
and that he has been unfaithful.
'People increasingly see the royal family as just another family, with all
the usual failings and frailties. Charles, at least, is much more in touch
with the real world than some of his relations. If this was a relaunch, I
think it has been successful'.
The prince's television performance did not dispel the idea that Charles
still inhabits a world alien to most people. Perhaps it is not unreasonable
that when the Colonel in Chief of eight regiments sits down to dinner at
home with a few old chums they should be clad in enough gold braid to sink
Britannia but it hardly carries the common touch. His use of 'boiling' as an
expletive reeked more of Bertie Wooster than Brookside.
However he may be singing a more popular tune in thinking out loud on the
future relationship between church and state, and the possibility of
widening the remit of monarch to become defender of all faiths. Senior
palace aides insist he is not advocating disestablishment of the Anglican
church.
According to Ms Kennedy: 'He is clearly struggling with things spiritual and
temporal in a way which many people will understand.'
The Anglican church has mostly been cautious in responding both to the
prince's disclosures over his personal behaviour and his thoughts on the
future role as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.
Lord Coggan, former archbishop of Canterbury, is not alone in pointing out
that Charles would not be the first royal to sin and still ascend to the
throne.
But regular critics of the royal family such as Rev Tony Higton, a member of
the Church of England's ruling synod, is more convinced than ever that
Charles is not up to the job. He believes the prince's views on defending
the faith of Catholics, Hindus and Zoroastrians alike will be profoundly
disturbing to many: 'He is a New Ager rather than a Christian and he is
unprepared to be Defender of the Faith,' says Higton.
The IoD's Peter Morgan adds: 'It is one thing to be clearly identified with
your own faith and to open up to others but quite another if you are not
going to be identified, first and foremost, with your own church. The prince
speaks warmly of Islam but can we really expect King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to
become leader of all the faiths in his country?'
In the view of people such as Mr Anthony Barnett, co-ordinator of Charter
88, the group seeking constitutional reform, the prince's anguished
deliberations form a sideshow to the real agenda for change in Britain.
'Charles' objective is to try to resolve the crisis of the monarchy by
attempting to say I love this country, I can't understand why its going
wrong and I'm trying to do what I can to make it better.
'The real problem is not the prince's behaviour. The crisis is not just
institutional but also lies in our failure to maintain consistent, economic
development. The monarchy used to be the authentic representative of a very
successful political, social and economic order. All that has gone. Now it
is the symbol of a rotten, decayed constitutional order.'
Mr Barnett paints Prince Charles as a man now almost entirely isolated from
any of the surviving institutions: 'He is so alone. There is no real
aristocracy, an ineffective church, the army is a poor imitation of what it
once was. They have all dropped away, leaving the monarchy increasingly
adrift.'
Charles himself invariably portrays himself, still more so since his split
with Princess Diana, as a man struggling alone - despite his staff of 62 -
to carry the burden imposed by destiny; the reality is that he remains,
possibly for many years to come, only the deputy. In the meantime, he will
continue his duties for what he so tellingly calls 'the organisation' into
which he was born. He rejects any suggestions that he is somehow trying to
re-define his role but acknowledges the need to make subtle shifts which
will help make him a thoroughly modern monarch. Few people criticise the
prince's involvement in and encouragement for the range of organisations
aimed at extending opportunity to those needing a helping hand. Even fewer
will criticise the unique ability of someone, by virtue of their
extraordinary position, to bang together ministerial heads and painlessly
extract more cash out of a parsimonious government.
He is ready for more 'ghastly' command performances but he also desperately
wants people to realise there is a substance and sense of deep obligation
underpinning his life.
'I am not', says the Prince of Wales, 'very good at being a performing
monkey'. The years ahead will decide whether his subjects-to-be will
ultimately permit him any other role.
