YESTERDAY'S announcement that the Prince and Princess of Wales are to live
separately raises more questions about the future of the British monarchy
than it answers. In essence, it says that since nothing will change except
the living arrangements of the heir to the throne and his wife the couple
should now be left in peace. This is not convincing. Everything will change,
and the prince and princess will continue, however regrettably, to be the
focus of attention.
The statement, issued by Buckingham Palace and read in the House of Commons
by the prime minister, might prove conclusive in a country in which there
was no established church, no popular demand for a family to represent the
crown, no insatiable public thirst for information about all aspects of
royal life and no antiquated structure of law and tradition. Britain is not
such a country. The monarch is head of the Church of England, the Queen is
revered as head of a family, the media reflect public tastes and the essence
of royalty is tradition.
When the time comes for Prince Charles to ascend the throne his putative
subjects may find it difficult to understand how a man who lives separately
from his wife can become head of the church that bears his country's name.
The Archbishop of Canterbury was quoted in aid by the palace yesterday, but
that does not necessarily end the matter.
Like the monarchy, the established church depends for its existence upon the
support of its adherents. Because it is established, there is a sense in
which the two institutions sink or swim together. There is a balance to be
struck between maintaining strict rules of personal conduct and accepting
that social morality has changed. It is not clear that either palace - the
archbishop's or the Queen's - has yet got it right.
Family life
During most of the present century the British people have demanded of their
sovereigns that they symbolise traditional family life. It was because he
could not do so that the Queen's uncle was obliged to abdicate in 1937. The
Duke of Windsor's sin was that he proposed to marry a divorced woman. At
that time such a move was unacceptable to both church and state. It might
not be so today. Yet the highly publicised marital difficulties of the
present Queen's children have unfortunately damaged what Bagehot referred to
as the 'dignified' part of the constitution.
The proposition put forward yesterday that somehow this separated couple can
become King and Queen as if nothing untoward had happened does little to
repair that damage. It is difficult to imagine life under what would be two
thrones, sitting back to back, facing opposite directions.
Sensational stories
The strength of royalty is a matter of perception; if people do not believe
that what they think they see is worthy of respect the monarchy is devalued.
The increasingly intrusive tabloid press, followed closely by television and
some of the broadsheets, has not served the royal family well. An industry
has been created around a single product: sensational stories about royal
persons.
This is a sad comment on an unsavoury aspect of contemporary life. Yet no
industry can exist without customers. If people did not want to read such
stuff, and pay to do so, it would not be produced. The market for palace
scandals is a keen one. Against such harsh reality, the call in parliament
yesterday for a moratorium on stories about the prince and princess sounds
forlorn.
It is therefore possible that the British constitution, which exists in the
mind rather than on paper, will suffer from further destabilisation when the
Queen's reign comes to an end. She has conducted herself with great dignity
and composure over the past 40 years, and would serve her country well if
she could continue for many more decades.
But, in spite of Mr John Major's plea for silent acceptance of yesterday's
news, it cannot now be said that the succession is predictable. For a
constitutional monarchy, it is not a disaster that there should be debate
about the implications of the announcement and the changes in social context
and expectations which form its background. At all events, such a debate is
now inescapable.
