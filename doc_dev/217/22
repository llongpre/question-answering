The long relative decline of Britain will continue until there is a
revolution. What kind of revolution? One answer is given by Professor
Stephen Haseler in a new book entitled The End of the House of Windsor -
Birth of a British Republic*. Our author is professor of government at
Guildhall University, London. 'The dawning truth about Britain in the
post-war period,' he writes, 'is that the country seems to be running out of
options. We have tried virtually every strategy for survival.'
Yes, yes, but what kind of revolution? Well, actually, a cultural
revolution. Back to the professor. ' . . . Our culture - the way we think,
the way we talk, the values we live by, indeed 'the British way of life' -
no longer allows us to compete effectively in the modern commercial world.'
As he sees it, the way to change the culture is by reform of our governing
institutions and indeed the constitution itself. Turning our monarchy into a
republic would certainly achieve that. 'My argument here', writes Professor
Haseler, 'is that, over time, new attitudes and aspirations would follow.'
Ordinarily, none of this would matter. It could be dismissed as academic
pub-talk. Maybe it still can. But it is possible that the professor is
pulling at a loose thread of indeterminate length. His book appears at a
moment when the competence of the government is more deeply in doubt than at
any time since 1945. That would be bad enough, but the opposition is divided
and its largest component, the Labour party, presently inspires little
confidence. We are heading towards a mid-1990s election in which the choice
before us may be between competing B-teams. This is frustrating. It has not
led to marches behind republican banners, but the political atmosphere is
becoming more hospitable to those who propound systemic reforms.
So is the social climate. The behaviour of some of the royal children has
eroded loyalties that once seemed beyond question. The Queen herself remains
popular. Her position is, deservedly, secure. What comes after her is,
however, unpredictable. Visitors to Britain do not have to move very far
from the airport to discover that the House of Windsor faces an uncertain
future. Just pick up any newspaper, or look out for a clutch of books - some
published, some about to be - that seek to catch the tide built up by the
tittle-tattle of the tabloids. Professor Haseler does not shrink from
exploiting this phenomenon. 'It is fitting,' he writes, 'that the travails
of Diana and Charles's marriage should be the catalyst for major change.'
The same series of events has encouraged The Times, once a rock of
allegiance to the throne, to associate itself with the reformist Charter 88
movement in a forthcoming conference on 'The Monarchy, the Constitution and
the People'. This gathering, due on Saturday, will be addressed by staunch
monarchists, moderate reformers, and Professor Haseler. We should not
conclude that Mr Rupert Murdoch, a suspect republican, is using his posh
London newspaper for nefarious purposes. I wouldn't know anything about
that. The pertinent point is that a journal that carries the court circular
every day is facilitating a debate on the monarchy that 20 or 30 years ago
might have been deemed treasonable. That is how far public opinion has
moved.
It still has a mighty long way to go before there is a republican movement
in Britain. In spite of my dreams of a federal republic in these islands I
would stop well before that, and settle for a Dutch, Belgian or Scandinavian
form of dis-established throne. Professor Haseler dismisses such a solution
as certain to fail. But consider the essence of the argument, his and mine,
in favour of constructing a new British constitution by removing the crown,
the keystone, from the arch of the present antiquated structure.
It is the crown that supports, and is supported by, the anachronistic House
of Lords; the crown in whose name ministers feel able to sign treaties, such
as the one concluded at Maastricht, in the absence of parliamentary
approval; the crown that legitimises the thousand and one decisions made in
the dark corridors of Whitehall every day. Replace its authority with that
of a written constitution, dismiss the House of Lords and elect a senate,
and you have quite enough revolution for the average English family to
stomach.
Europe's little northern monarchies have solved the problem. They do not
have hereditary upper houses of parliament, and their constitutions specify
exactly what their kings and queens may do. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark
has 'supreme authority in all the affairs of the realm', but, as with the
conclusion of treaties, only with the consent of the Folketing. Likewise
Queen Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard of the Netherlands. She may appoint her
prime ministers by decree, but does so on the report of a 'formateur' to the
effect that he or she commands a majority.
No such sliver of ambiguity prevails in Sweden, whose constitution provides
for the speaker of the Riksdag to propose a new prime minister. Government
decisions do not require King Karl XVI Gustaf's signature. King Baudouin of
Belgium has far greater nominal powers (he is the supreme head of the
executive). But in practice he does not exercise them.
British subjects who see the need for reform but insist that the person of a
respected monarch is a focus for national loyalties may thus have their cake
and eat it, simply by learning from the Low Countries and the Scandinavians.
These are in essence republics, in which authority is derived from the
people. For reasons of their own they retain their cycling monarchs. We may
have to do the same. Perhaps the Union Jack is not an adequate substitute
for a crowned head, as the stars and stripes are in the US, or the abstract
notion of the state is in France. Perhaps our revolution, when it comes, has
to stop short.
The chances of this happening are becoming real. The Labour party's
proposals for constitutional reform say little about the monarchy, but if
the other parts are enacted, the rest will surely follow. We may be in for
permanent Conservative government, but this seems doubtful. One day an
electable, reforming, alternative will be on offer. With any luck, the
British polity will then become like that of Italy a year or so ago:
pregnant with sudden change.
