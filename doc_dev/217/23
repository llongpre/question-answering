OBSCURE KINGDOMS
by Edward Fox
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 16.99, 240 pages
In this stylish, informative and sometimes very funny book, American-born
journalist Edward Fox recounts his personal pilgrimage to five of the
world's remoter monarchies. He went because he wished to understand what
makes kings and kingdoms tick. His travels took him to Tonga, Oman, Nigeria,
Swaziland and Java. In each he had fascinating and sometimes hilarious
adventures, related in a dry and sharply observant prose which signals the
arrival, in this first book, of a major writing talent.
Fox turned his back on European royalties because he wished to encounter
monarchy afresh, in unfamiliar guises. But he repeatedly found himself 'face
to face with what I was fleeing: the hand of the British, recreating the
empire in their own image.' Were it not for the British none of these
monarchies would be as they are; most would not even exist.
Tonga's King Tupou IV granted Fox an audience, and during it demonstrated a
simplified method of addition for use in primary schools. The King not only
invents things - a joint rugby and soccer goal post, used all over Tonga, is
another example - but conducts agricultural experiments, solves
archaeological problems, and is the holder of his kingdom's pole-vault
record. He is the fattest man in Tonga because he eats the most, a sign of
royal power. It is clear that Fox, although bemused by Tupou, enjoyed
meeting him, and learned an important lesson: that delays and difficulties
are occupational hazards of royalty-watching.
It was much more difficult for Fox to get at His Majesty the Sultan of Oman,
an absolute monarch in the traditional oriental mould. He succeeded in
attending a levee at which subjects queue to shake the Sultan's hand; but
requests for an interview were denied, and when Fox tried to observe the
Sultan on his annual meet-the-people tour, in a Bedouin-style cavalcade with
Mercedes Benzes substituting for camels, he failed. So instead he read the
history of Oman and the 'mirrors for princes' written to instruct rulers,
and pondered on the fact that 'roads and roundabouts are the distinctive
post-oil Arabian art form', explained perhaps by the fact that they
represent an 'ultimate triumph over the former hardships of desert travel'.
Fox did not come away unimpressed; when he went to shake the Sultan's hand
it was in a throne-room that looked like the inside of a gigantic Faberge
egg.
After difficulties of Oman Fox found Nigeria a joy, because it has not one
but hundreds of kings and he was able to interview a number of them - the
Aragbiji of Irigbiji, the Akirun of Ikirun, and even the two greatest
'obas', the Alaafin of Oyo and the Ooni of Ife. In Yoruba religion Ife is
the site of Creation. The exact spot, Fox reports, lies opposite a Total
petrol station, marked by an enigmatic granite pillar. Each oba is a
guardian of the traditional religion. For those who are now Moslem or
Christian this presents difficulties. To become an oba one has to eat the
dried heart of one's predecessor, served in soup. But the benefits, it
seems, usually outweigh scruples; on meeting an oba one says 'Kabiyesi]'
which can either be translated 'May you live long' or 'You cannot be
contradicted'.
Heartened by his successes in Nigeria Fox proceeded to Swaziland, only to be
disappointed again. Young King Mswati III proved unmeetable, hidden behind
layers of suspicious advisers. Fox noted a mysterious empathy between the
Swazis and the British: 'They saw a bit of themselves in each other. Each
had a culture of clenched good manners, restraint, discipline,
understatement and secrecy, arranged in a strict social hierarchy with a
King at the top.' The Swazis have a saying: 'Let the Swazi and the English
deceive each other with politeness, and the Zulu and the Boer have it out
with clubs.'
But all frustrations were compensated in Java, where Fox had a satisfying
encounter with Sultan Hamengkubuwono X of Yogyakarta, whose full name runs
to two dozen words. Here Fox was able to meditate on the secret of monarchy:
its place between the secular and divine, its use of the mysteries of
inaccessibility, its function as a centre for artistic display, political
patronage, and symbolic meanings. It is a privilege of royalty to be
unavailable when it chooses; in Nigeria an oba's henchmen would turn away
petitioners by saying his master was still abed. 'These kings were like
disappointing zoo animals,' Fox remarks, 'always asleep when you wanted to
see them.'
The author of this highly entertaining mixture of travelogue, history and
royal essay appears as a wryly engaging observer. One looks forward to his
next book with great relish.
