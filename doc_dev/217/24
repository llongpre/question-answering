   Britain today celebrated the 300th anniversary of
the bloodless Glorious Revolution that established its democracy
and brought to the throne William and Mary, who founded the royally
chartered American college.
   About 1,500 people filled the Palace of Westminster, seat of the
British Parliament, for a ceremony celebrating the world's most
enduring constitutional monarchy.
   Among the guests were a U.S. delegation from the College of
William and Mary in Virginia, led by former Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger.
   They were joined by Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, Prince William of Orange, heir to the Dutch throne, a
Dutch parliamentary delegation and speakers of many of the
parliaments of Commonwealth countries.
   The ceremony recalled the 17th century abdication of King James
II, the last of England's absolute monarchs, and the arrival from
the Netherlands of William and Mary, who were enthroned as
constitutional monarchs ruling under Parliament.
   William, invited by dissident noblemen to replace James, sailed
to England with 300 ships and 15,000 soldiers.
   The Glorious Revolution and the Bill of Rights that followed in
1689 ``transformed the relationship between the crown and
Parliament. They secured our liberties,'' said Bernard Weatherill,
speaker of the House of Commons, in his address.
   Queen Elizabeth, in her address, said William's accession to the
throne with Mary ``ended almost a century of constitutional turmoil
and uncertainty in the two kingdoms'' of England and Scotland.
   It meant, the queen said, that ``the successive swings between
the arbitrary rule of the king and arbitrary rule of parliament
became intolerable.''
   Some historians argue that the Glorious Revolution entrenched
the rule of the British upper classes and led to the repression of
Catholics under Protestant William's reign.
   Paul R. Verkuil, president of the College of William and Mary,
said in an interview that the controversy ``has not been exported''
to the United States.
   ``For us, the Glorious Revolution is pure and simple, the
precursor of our own revolution. It is truly an important event for
us,'' he said.
   The college, whose chancellor is Burger, was founded in 1693 at
the behest of William and Mary. Congress, with President Reagan's
assent, designated it to represent the United States at today's
ceremony.
