AS KING Lear discovered unhappily, longevity does not necessarily make a
sovereign popular or serene. Indeed, if Queen Elizabeth II contemplates the
history of her forebears on the British throne, she must see that the record
during the past 200 years or so has been decidedly mixed.
Although she is well-loved by her subjects, it does not follow automatically
that the monarchy's reputation is high and unquestioned. Certainly, age by
itself will not assure her of greater dignity and public respect: as old
men, George IV and William IV were neither loved nor admired, while Edward
VIII threw it all away when he married Mrs Simpson.
Yet, the reasons why some monarchs have become venerated patriarchs (or
matriarchs) while others have not are complex and often obscure. George
III's reputation improved immeasurably the older (and madder) he became. At
the end of her reign, Victoria was even more selfish, obstinate and bigoted
than she had been at the start; but none of this mattered to her subjects,
who worshipped her as an imperial icon. Edward VII was scarcely a more
admirable individual than George IV, but the public perception of him was
very different. And while George V became a lovable king, he was never a
particularly lovable man.
So, at one level, royal reputation turns out to be like any other: what
Shakespeare once described as 'an idle and most false disposition, oft got
without merit and lost without deserving.' But it is fashioned also by
broader forces over which the monarchs themselves have had little control
and often have not even understood. In every reign, and in every generation,
the British have projected on to the person of their sovereign their own
collective hopes, anxieties and expectations. In so doing, they have created
and re-created their monarchy in their own self-image.
How far should the Queen be comforted or worried by this as she enters the
fifth decade of her reign? Compared with George IV or William IV she has
enjoyed a relatively good press. Compared with George V and George VI, she
has done rather less well. And compared with George III and Victoria, she
did much better at the beginning of her reign but seems less likely to enjoy
the sunset apotheosis and uncritical veneration of their later years.
Why so? As in previous ages, the answer lies in a combination of individual
royal personality and the broader tissue of national circumstances. In a
society where old age is more a commonplace problem than an unusual sign of
admirable endurance, it no longer guarantees certain celebrity in the way it
once did - witness the almost Pythonesque demise of the Kremlin old guard.
To make matters worse for the present Queen, the slot of apotheosised
matriarch is not yet even available to her. Indeed, if the Queen Mother
outlives her own century, as she seems to have every intention (and
capability) of doing, that slot is not going to become available for many
years.
As to her own personality, we know little more about it now than we did at
the beginning of her reign, despite the BBC's televised attempt on Thursday
to make her more accessible. Like her father, she is reputedly pleasant,
decent, dutiful, conscientious and high-minded. But, like him again, she is
also limited in her education and her social vision, seems lacking
conspicuously in imagination and flair, and is conservative enough to regard
most change as change for the worse. Whether these are the ideal attributes
and attitudes for a head of state in the late-20th century is, perhaps, open
to question.
And then there is her family. As the Queen surveys the tribe of which she is
the hereditary chief, she must often shudder, and it is difficult not to
feel some sympathy. When she acceded to the throne, the royal family
consisted effectively of five people: the Queen herself, her husband, her
sister, her mother and her grandmother (Queen Mary). But during the past 40
years it has developed into an over-extended, multi-generational dynasty,
devoid of any central direction, purpose or justification.
For most contemporary commentators, whose analysis is scarcely more profound
than that of the gossip columnist or the 'investigative journalist,' this is
enough to explain the unhappy state and uncertain prospects of the monarchy
today. But while individual character, the reaction between the generations,
and the creative image of the royal family undoubtedly are important, they
are only part - and perhaps the lesser part - of the whole picture. Now, as
in the past, the monarchy must be viewed in the broader context of national
development and the popular collective mood.
At the time of her Silver Jubilee in 1977, Elizabeth II was anxious to
stress that she had been crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland: that she was, like her forebears, a symbol of
British national identity. But in the course of her reign, that sense of
national identity has much weakened. Scotland wants devolution, Northern
Ireland will surely rejoin the south before the next century is many years
old, and England itself is now a multi-racial society. Where exactly does
that leave the monarchy as the traditional embodiment of Britishness?
A closely-connected subject, which also has important implications for the
monarchy's future, is the fast-changing relations with Europe. It is not
just that the Queen's head might disappear from UK bank-notes, coins, even
postage stamps - it also is difficult to envisage a serious role for
Britain's royal house in any tighter form of continental federation. What
would the British monarchy do then?
In previous times, it could have turned to the Empire or the Commonwealth to
keep it busy. But the independence of the former colonies, and the changing
identities of the old dominions, mean that the Commonwealth is no longer the
royalist, Anglophile community it was at the Queen's accession. Yet, it is
only as the sovereign of her remaining overseas possessions, and as head of
the Commonwealth, that she can lay claim to a genuinely global role. She
herself believes passionately in it - but few others do. It will not last.
Shorn of its international trappings, how would - or will - the monarchy
adjust?
As the British nation itself is re-defined; as Britain's relations with
Europe are re-ordered; as the once-British Commonwealth evolves and
disperses; and as Britain gradually - and painfully - adjusts to the fact
that it is no longer a world power, this is bound to require a fundamental
re-thinking of the monarchy's purpose and functions. The old way of doing
things - ceremonial grandeur, tax exemptions, overseas tours, gracious
smiles - which may have been right at the outset of the Queen's reign, no
longer seem acceptable or appropriate. What is to be put in its place?
This has been made all the more urgent because of the impact of Thatcherism
on popular perceptions of the monarchy. As a symbol of national identity,
Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, upstaged the Queen easily.
Norman Tebbitt, perhaps Thatcher's closest lieutenant, denounced the Prince
of Wales and many Thatcherites regarded the monarchy as just another vested
interest, an unacceptable amalgam of snobbery and frivolity. While the
welfare state consensus prevailed, the monarchy's position as benevolent
referee seemed clear and secure. But now the goal-posts have been shifted,
its position seems decidedly shaken.
There is little evidence that the Queen, or her relatives and advisers, have
recognised the full implications of these developments so far as the
monarchy is concerned. And it is here that we must return to personalities
again. Clearly, there is need for a serious re-evaluation of the monarchy in
the next few decades. Whether the present queen - 40 years in the job and,
thus, hardly likely to change her approach to it - is the person to
undertake such a re-appraisal is not clear. Nor can we know whether Prince
Charles, her heir, would - or will - do any better.
Whoever is responsible, part of the process of the readjustment ought to
involve the dismantling of the old, out-of-date imperial monarchy that
flourished from the time of Victoria's Golden Jubilee until the present
Queen's accession. The tax exemptions, the ceremonial grandeur, the
Commonwealth tours, the endless public appearances, the whole sycophantic
mythology of imperial ornamentality - all this needs to be scaled down or
swept away, and the monarchy brought into line more appropriately with the
diminished nation over which it now reigns.
Described like this, the royal future might seem rather unappealing: a moped
monarchy which is little more than an hereditary, non-elective presidency.
But while the monarchy would be well advised to abandon its recent imperial
past, its lengthy history affords other more positive and encouraging
precedents. It does not have to be like it is: passive, philistine,
bewildered, anachronistic, obsessed with protocol and tradition, and
smothered in a courtly embrace redolent of quarter-deck attitudes and
saddle-soap.
Previous monarchs have been lively, energetic, cultured, even intellectual:
what a refreshing change it would be for that to happen again. Previous
monarchs did much more than make an occasional visit to a concert or the
opera and were involved, actively and creatively, in the promotion and
patronage of the arts: that, too, would be a welcome development. The
present Queen might follow the example of George I and use a small part of
her enormous fortune to found some new university professorships. She might
even set up a Windsor foundation and establish herself as a leader in
creative philanthropy.
The real problem with the British monarchy today is that it is not seen to
be an active, serious or significant part of the life of the British nation.
Doing her boxes, going on stage-managed visits, making speeches she has not
written, meeting people only in wholly-contrived social situations - none of
this brings the Queen into authentic contact with her subjects. Like all
members of the royal family, only more so, she is little more than a tourist
in her own country. If the British monarchy is to have a future, she should
think about taking up residence for real.
These individual suggestions can take us only so far. It is not just that
the British monarchy has lost its way - it is also that the British people
no longer have any real collective sense of what they want their monarchy
for. Just as most societies get the gods they deserve, so most monarchies
get the sovereign they deserve. One reason why the British are so uncertain
with their monarchy is that they are so uncertain about themselves. For both
the Queen and her subjects, there are challenging times ahead.
