FT  15 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Monarchy targeted in Benn proposal

PENSIONING off the royal family, disestablishing the Church of England and
abolishing the House of Lords were proposed by Mr Tony Benn yesterday in an
attempt to push the case for republicanism after the Queen's self-confessed
'annus horribilis'.
The Labour MP for Chesterfield's Commonwealth of Britain Bill was presented
to the Commons for the second time with its author able to claim that one
provision was already in place: the prime minister has announced that the
Queen will pay income tax from next year.
Mr Benn said that if the Maastricht treaty was ratified, the Queen's status
would be further undermined. She would, in effect, become a citizen of
Europe, able to vote in European elections. It would make a further mockery
of Britain's constitution based on 'a network of oaths of allegiance,' he
said.
Mr Benn - an opponent of Maastricht - said that 'to have an oath of
allegiance to another citizen in a European union is quite a big change,
much bigger than I'm proposing.'
He first presented the bill in the last parliament, when it was not even
discussed by MPs. But Mr Benn said it has provoked debate and had become a
set text for some students.
Moreover, in the past few weeks, with the separation of the Prince and
Princess of Wales, 'the magic and mystery' had disappeared from the
monarchy. His bill proposes the transfer of royal palaces to the state and
stripping all power from the monarch but giving her a state pension and
accommodation.
Mr Benn's bill would set up a House of Commons and a House of the People.
There would be an elected president, national parliaments for England,
Scotland and Wales, and a charter of rights. Britain would withdraw from
Northern Ireland.
The bill is extremely unlikely to be debated.
