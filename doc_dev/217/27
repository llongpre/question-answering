   On a continent where kings were once
revered as gods, Asia's half-dozen surviving monarchies include a
diverse clutch of modernizing kings and a sultan who wields absolute
power.
   King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, the world's longest reigning
monarch following the death Jan. 7 of Japan's Emperor Hirohito, has
initiated several thousand rural projects and spends much of each
year in the countryside personally helping peasants to design
irrigation canals, improve crops and combat disease.
   Aside from Thailand and Japan, monarchs also reign in Nepal and
Bhutan in the Himalayias, Brunei on Borneo, and Malaysia in
Southeast Asia.
   Unlike his remote predecessors in Nepal, Harvard-educated King
Birendra criss-crosses his mountainous nation and has set a goal of
fulfilling the basic needs of an impoverished populace by the year
2000.
   In the kingdom of Bhutan, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk pores over
economic development plans and almost daily deals with petitions
submitted by subjects.
   Hirohito, whose funeral will be held Feb. 24, is widely credited
with having helped Japan's postwar economic miracle by preserving
national unity and traditional virtues through his symbolic role.
But the late emperor, who renounced his divinity after Japan's
defeat in World War II, spent most of his 62 years on the
Chrysanthemum Throne behind the walls of Tokyo's Imperial Palace.
   His son and successor, Emperor Akihito, 55, broke with tradition
by marrying a commoner and has travelled with his family by train,
thrown out the first ball at baseball games and mixed with his
fellow Japanese at numerous public functions.
   Though he is expected to breach some of the barriers between
emperor and subjects, Akihito is unlikely to interact as intimately
with his subjects and their daily problems as do the other Asian
royals _ nor wield anywhere near as much tangible power.
   The most powerful and richest of the continent's five remaining
hereditary monarchs is Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, an absolute
ruler who resides in a 1,788-room palace and keeps some of his 200
horses in air-conditioned stables. Fortune magazine in the United
States last year named him the world's richest man, with assets
estimated at $25 billion.
   Besides being head of state, he is also prime minister and
defense minister and has included two of his brothers in the Cabinet
to help rule over the oil-rich nation about the size of Maryland on
the north coast of Borneo island.
   Brunei's sultan harkens back to days when the pomp, pageantry and
proclamations of hundreds of bluebloods _ kings, princes, sultans,
maharajahs, newabs and nizams _ were as vital a part of Asia as its
rice fields.
   But by mid-century, royal ranks had been thinned by communist
revolutions, independence struggles and the spread of Western
democracy. Other crowns have toppled in more recent times.
   The last emperor of China abdicated in 1912. Communists ended
imperial rule in Vietnam at the end of World War II. India's
independence from Great Britain in 1947 sounded the knell for
myriads of royals. Cambodia's kingdom ended amidst war and chaos in
1970, though Prince Norodom Sihanouk, formerly the king, is still
active as an exiled guerrilla faction leader. The last king of
Afghanistan, Mohammad Zaher Shah, was toppled in 1973 and is exiled
in Italy but recently offered to help in a transitional government
in his country.
   Today, there remain but five Asian hereditary kingdoms and
Malaysia, where every five years one of the country's sultans is
elected a constitutional monarch.
   Nine of Malaysia's 13 states have sultans who are constitutional
heads of the state governments. They have no political power. Every
five years these sultans meet to elect by secret ballot one of
themselves to be the national king. By tacit agreement each state
gets a turn at having its sultan king sooner or later. At the
national level the king is the constitutional head of state but
political power rests with prime minister.
   The present king of Malaysia is Sultan Mahmood Iskandar from
Jahore state. His term expires this year.
   Today's Asian monarchies have deep roots and their forseeable
futures appear secure.
   Akihito is 125th in a line of emperors said to stretch back 2,600
years in Japan. Though historians regard the first 14 emperors as
figures of myth, the Japanese imperial line is still the world's
oldest hereditary monarchy, and current public opinion polls favor
its continuation.
   Bhumibol, probably the most respected man in Thailand, is heir to
750 years of monarchy.
   Bolkiah is Brunei's 29th ruler while Nepal and Bhutan both have
centuries-old royal traditions.
   Although a constitutional monarch, the 61-year-old Thai king is
regarded as semi-divine by some and widely viewed as having held the
country together in wake of the coups and abortive power grabs that
have marked recent decades. He openly intervened to stop a serious
student-led uprising in 1973 and has in other moments of national
crisis played a decisive behind-the-scenes role.
   Named king in 1946 and crowned four years later, when he was a
jazz-loving teen-ager, Bhumibol was initially viewed as someone to
be used by military strongmen. Instead, he gradually reversed the
decline in prestige of the throne, largely by by-passing the elite
to work for the mass of have-nots in the countryside.
   Nepal's Birendra, 43, likewise has sought links with the rural
poor, making frequent trips to remote areas to hand out relief
supplies and sound out the problems of villagers. But knowledgable
sources in Nepal and neighboring India say much of the effort is
negated by corruption within the royal family and its retainers _ an
open secret in Katmandu, the capital.
   Birendra has initiated some political reforms during his 16-year
rule but there are quiet critics of both the monarchy and limited
democratic rights. The king himself, seen as a reincarnation of the
Hindu god Vishnu, by law cannot be criticized.
   In Bhutan, the publicity-shy, 33-year-old King Jigme Singye
Wangchuk has continued his father's attempts at political evolution
and improvement in the lives of his 1.4 million, largely illiterate
people.
   ``Development is important but preserving our culture and our
values is equally important,'' Jigme Singye has said.
   Bhutan was only opened up from its medieval seclusion by his
reform-minded father.
   International aid agencies have been welcomed to Bhutan but mass
tourism has not. Tourism is seen as a destroyer of the old ways
upheld by the king, who always wears the traditional, robe-like
``kho'' _ even while playing basketball _ and is married to four
sisters of noble line, another time-honored custom.
   Brunei's politics are said to be among the most sterile in Asia
but the tiny state's 227,000 people have yet to show significant
signs of discontent. Under the 42-year-old sultan, the country
continues to prosper from its oil and natural gas reserves. Medical
care and education are free and the per capita annual income of
$21,000 is among the highest in the world.
   The sultan, who has snapped up hotels, companies and other
investments around the world, moves freely among his subjects and is
credited with a number of civic improvements.
