FT  17 OCT 94 / Royal book prompts ministers to defend monarchy

Senior ministers yesterday tried to quell public anxiety about the future of
the monarchy after the publication of extracts from a controversial book
about the private life of the Prince of Wales.
Amid concern that the book, written with Prince Charles's co-operation,
could undermine the monarchy's authority, two cabinet ministers and a
constitutional expert launched a spirited defence of the heir to the throne.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said recent revelations in books and
newspapers about the royal family had led to the monarchy's detractors
'getting everything out of proportion'.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, said the revelations in
the book posed no threat to the monarchy. 'It is the monarchy, of which
Prince Charles is ultimately the heir, which matters, not the flotsam and
jetsam of journalism about personal feelings, however sincere they may be,'
he told Sky television.
The book, written by Mr Jonathan Dimbleby, the broadcaster, was serialised
in yesterday's Sunday Times and contains a detailed and unprecedented
account of the difficulties of Prince Charles's marriage.
The prince said through his private office yesterday that he had no regrets
about helping to write the book, and that it could be regarded as 'a
balanced and thoroughly researched appraisal' of his development as an
individual and the way he has approached his role.
Buckingham Palace admitted that the timing had been unfortunate, coming on
the eve of the Queen's state visit to Russia today, the first by a reigning
British monarch.
Interviewed on BBC radio's World This Weekend, Mr Hurd, who will accompany
the Queen to Moscow, attacked the determination of the British press to
divulge intimate secrets of the royal family's lives. He said: 'I am worried
about the way in which chattering people concerned with headlines and mass
circulation do chip away at our institutions in this country, of which the
monarchy is perhaps the most important and in a way the most vulnerable.'
Lord St John of Fawsley, former cabinet member and a constitutional expert,
said the book was 'immensely serious' and 'of very great historical
importance'. But he admitted the prince had adopted a 'high risk' strategy
by co-operating with the author of the book.
Mr Barry Sheerman, a front bench Labour spokesman, criticised Prince
Charles, saying the book had merely compounded the debate about the
monarchy.
