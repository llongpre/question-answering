   Soon after security forces unleashed the
bloodiest crackdown in Nepal's modern history, Bijay Bahadur yanked
a picture of King Birendra from his paint shop wall and threw it in
the attic.
   The same day, he also took a handful of rice from his meager
lunch and placed it on a rectangular metal plate as part of a
ritual to feed the king and his forefathers.
   His actions highlight a contradiction in Nepal, the world's only
Hindu kingdom. The monarchy is losing power in a groundswell for
democracy but, for many people, the king remains a living god.
   Bahadur said he pulled down the portrait because he was angry
with the king for the April 6 crackdown.
   ``It was a matter of respect, which had vanished,'' he said.
   On that day, security forces fired into a crowd of 200,000
protesters calling for democracy. Witnesses said police killed
about 200 people. The government claimed only 10 died.
   While gunfire was still echoing through the city, garment seller
Nima Churing, his wife and their four children gathered under
Birendra's picture, lit incense sticks, filled seven small glasses
with holy water and bowed their heads.
   Churing, who like Bahadur also lives in the narrow-laned
Chatrapati area of Katmandu, repeated the prayers the next morning
as soldiers with shoot-on-sight orders patrolled the curfew-bound
capital.
   ``We have done these prayers all our lives. Our forefathers did
it throughout their lives. How can we stop it?'' asked Churing.
   The belief that the king is a living god was propagated early in
the 18th century when snakes prevented King Pratap Malla from going
to a temple of the Hindu god, Vishnu.
   Court astrologers explained the incident by saying Pratap was
the reincarnation of Vishnu and the holy snakes did not want the
king to pray to himself.
   The tradition continued after Birendra's ancestor Prithvi
Narayan Shah vanquished the Malla dynasty and set up his kingdom,
encompassing most of present-day Nepal, in 1769.
   Even today, many people, especially in remote villages, believe
that seeing the king can wash away their sins.
   But while a majority of Nepal's 17 million people _ 75 percent
of whom are illiterate _ worship the king as a god, the educated
and urban population is tearing itself away from the belief.
   ``When I worship the king, it is an inadvertent reaction of my
psyche,'' said Bahadur. ``But I certainly do not believe that the
king is a god.''
   It was this educated and urban elite that led the seven weeks of
pro-democracy protests that forced Birendra to lift a 29-year ban
on political parties. This week, the king agreed to accept his
kingdom's first opposition-led government in nearly three decades.
   During the demonstrations, slogans and graffiti were directed
against Birendra and the royal family for the first time.
   Birendra was depicted as a weak leader, dominated by his wife,
Aishwarya.
   ``Birendra hides behind the queen's petticoat,'' was one chant
that was often heard. ``Birendra thief, leave the throne,'' was
another.
   Many intellectuals believe members of the royal family are
involved in antique and gold smuggling. Queen Aishwarya is often
referred to as Nepal's Imelda Marcos, a reference to the wife of
the late Philippine president.
   There has been little effort to prove the accusations because
criticizing the royalty is illegal.
   Despite the discontent, political observers and newly legalized
political parties agree that the monarchy will remain intact and
that the king will most likely become a constitutional monarch.
   ``It will be a long time before the institution of the monarchy
goes away. The Nepalese people are not ready to sever a part of
their lives suddenly,'' said former Foreign Minister Dilli Raj
Regmi.
   Arbinda Shrestha, a bank clerk who took part in pro-democracy
demonstrations, calls Birendra ``a symbol of unity.''
   ``My political feelings may be there, but I still want the king
to stay,'' he said.
   Many others support Birendra and blame his Cabinet ministers for
the crackdown and mass arrests.
   ``The king was OK. Only his government was bad,'' said Shiva
Manda, a film magazine reporter.
   The people's feelings are echoed by the Nepali Congress party,
which is to head an interim government, and its junior partner, the
seven-party United Left Front coalition.
   With the front's taking part in the government, Nepal becomes
the only country in the world where communists have joined hands
with a monarchy.
