   For a country still with a monarchy after more
than a thousand years many Britains are dunces about their kings
and queens, according to a survey released today.
   The Gallup Poll said six out of 10 people interviewed did not
know who won the Battle of Hastings.
   Half of those questioned did not know how many wives King Henry
VIII had.
   Six out of 10 did not know which monarch was beheaded by
parliamentarians, eight in 10 could not name the king in power
during the American revolution and just three people in 10 knew who
would follow Prince Charles to the throne.
   Comments on the poll results said more men than women knew about
the violent aspects of the monarchy, including beheadings and
battles, but more than half the women knew that Queen Elizabeth I
was known as the Virgin Queen while only four men in 10 had the
right answer.
   Of the 917 people across the country were interviewed last month
for the survey, those who displayed the greatest ignorance were in
the 16-to-24 age group. No margin of error was given for the survey.
   The answers:
   Duke William of Normandy defeated King Harold II at Hastings in
1066 and then had himself crowned King William I in Westminster
Abbey. The modern monarchy is dated from William but he was
preceded by 17 Saxon and three Danish monarchs.
   King Henry VIII had six wives. He divorced two, had two
beheaded, one died and one outlived him.
   King Charles I was beheaded in 1649 by parliamentarians led by
Oliver Cromwell.
   King George III was the king when the American colonies defeated
the British and became the United States.
   Prince William, the elder son of Prince Charles, is second in
line to the throne following his father, who is to succeed Queen
Elizabeth II.
   The survey was commissioned by Royal Britain, a permanent London
exhibition about British royal history. The exhibition opened last
year near the Barbican subway station.
