  [Text] In a significant hardening of his position, Zulu 
monarch King Goodwill Zwelithini has demanded the "complete 
restoration of the Zulu kingdom" in talks with President F.W. de 
Klerk. Sources close to the hush-hush encounters say the king 
has called for a sovereign Zulu state according to pre-1838 
boundaries. This would encompass all of Natal, including 
kwaZulu, and would stretch from the Drakensberg mountains to the 
sea and from Mozambique to the Umzimvubu River in the south. 
  The demand runs directly contrary to speculation that the 
monarch would adopt a less political role with the imminent 
demise of the kwaZulu homeland, in a bid to secure his position 
under a new dispensation. 
  With the failure this week of the trilateral talks between 
the government, ANC [African National Congress] and Freedom 
Alliance to reach agreement on outstanding constitutional 
issues, the king has lost interest in remaining part of the new 
South Africa, the sources say. 
  Arguing that the new dispensation would herald not only a 
new 
government, but a new state as well, one source noted: "Before 
conquest by Britain, the Zulus were a sovereign nation. Now 
that the British are no longer ruling South Africa, we are not 
obliged to remain part of it." 
  Conspicuously absent from last week's pow-wow between 
Zwelithini and De Klerk was kwaZulu chief minister Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi. Buthelezi has clearly begun a strategic retreat from 
the political frontline -- in the hope that an anti-election 
call from his nephew will have wider appeal among Zulus. By 
raising the spectre of a UDF [United Democratic Front]-style 
campaign to boycott elections with the backing of a royal 
decree, Zwelithini has sharpened the battle for his allegiance. 
  The ANC's decision to place its deputy secretary general, 
Jacob Zuma, at the top of its Natal electoral list was in part a 
strategy to win over the king, whom ANC president Nelson Mandela 
last year lauded as the king of all South Africans." But 
efforts by Zuma have so far failed to produce a 
Mandela-Zwelithini indaba [meeting]. Instead, when Zwelithini 
decided to enter the heart of the debate, he arranged for a 
private meeting with De Klerk. 
  Sources say De Klerk went further than Zuma's promise to 
seek 
a constitutional position for the monarch by hinting that a 
post-election arrangement could secure him the constitutional 
monarchy of South Africa. Zwelithini is said to have baulked at 
the suggestion. 
  Said one source: "(Zwelithini) looks over the border at 
Swaziland and Lesotho and says: `They were far smaller than 
(the Zulus) in my grandfather's time and now they have sovereign 
kingdoms. Why should I settle for second best?'" Among 
Zwelithini's representatives in the talks are IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] chief executive officer Joe Matthews and Prince 
Gideon Zulu. The government is represented by Constitutional 
Development Minister Roelf Meyer and his Foreign Affairs 
colleague, Pik Botha. 
  In the clearest reflection that Zwelithini's demands have 
created a dilemma for the ANC and government alike, Meyer said 
this week in an SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
interview that the king's demands were tantamount to a call for 
secession. He declined to give details. A few hours later, 
Mandela responded by calling upon the king to meet him rather 
than De Klerk, who would not be in power after elections. 
  ANC sources this week claimed the king had already agreed to 
meet a delegation of its Natal leaders, but that Zuma's absence 
on an overseas visit had delayed the encounter. 
  Given the probability that the IFP will, together with its 
allies, boycott the coming election, the king's move to centre 
stage is a shrewd strategy. Inkatha leader Buthelezi and his 
negotiators have exhausted their options for obtaining 
concessions from the government and the ANC. 
  Now, faced with the task of organising an effective boycott, 
the party is playing its trump card, observers say. The 
exclusion of the word "kwaZulu" from the interim constitution 
has strengthened Buthelezi's argument that the ANC and the 
government cannot be trusted with the fate of the Zulu nation, 
sources say. 
  It is unclear how Zwelithini plans to rule such a kingdom, 
but it is likely that Buthelezi would retain his position as the 
"traditional prime minister to the Zulu monarch."
