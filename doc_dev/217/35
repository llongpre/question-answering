You may not believe the passage I am about to cite unless you heard it with
your own ears, but here it is: 'The United Kingdom - the greatest cradle of
culture and academic and scientific and artistic and political achievement
in modern times - that's not some trifle to be lightly set at risk.' This
anachronistic fantasy was purveyed by Mr John Major, in a speech written for
delivery at last Friday's conference of Conservative women. An ancient
mirage of national glory was his product, the flag his packaging. 'It is,'
said the prime minister, referring to the country he runs with such
effortless brilliance, 'the highest cause this party knows - and we will
defend it with every fibre of our being.'
There you have it. England beats Graeco-Roman civilisation into a cocked
hat. The Chinese, the Japanese, the French, the Germans, the Egyptians, the
Italians, the Indians, the Persians - oh, why bother to list them, they are
all foreign, and they have nothing to teach the British. Music, painting,
philosophy, science, the very act of learning were all invented here. There
is a certain sadness in the vainglorious, grandiloquent rodomontade with
which some of our politicians express their nostalgia for a faded past.
Thank heavens there are fewer than six years to endure before 2000. Then it
should be clear to everyone, even Mr Major, that the 19th century is over.
Sorry about that moment of passion. I was looking through the prime
minister's address to the Tory ladies when the above-quoted nonsense leapt
out. The business of the day is cool analysis of Mr Major's attack on
Labour's proposals for constitutional reform, and the opposition's response.
The matter can be disposed of quite succinctly. Labour is right on the
merits of the case. The prime minister may be right on where the political
advantage lies. Mr Major believes that his warning that devolution of power
to a Scottish parliament would lead to the break-up of the UK was an
important element in his election victory of 1992; the opposition parties
have nevertheless persisted with their modest proposals for constitutional
change.
These include regional assemblies, the exclusion of hereditary peers from
the House of Lords, a referendum on electoral reform, a bill of rights, a
freedom of information act, and the curtailment of the crown prerogative,
the unwritten law that permits ministers to legislate in the name of the
monarch. Most of these have been propounded in this space, as elsewhere.
Whether or not you agree with any of them or indeed the package as a whole
depends on whether you regard the British executive as sufficiently checked
and balanced by other branches of government - and whether you think our
system is producing good governance.
The argument has been rehearsed many times, principally among the chattering
classes, but also through pressure groups such as Charter 88. This week the
audience may have been further enlarged because Mr Jack Straw appeared on a
TV programme in which he repeated his well-known view that the monarchy
ought to be retrenched, limited to its symbolic functions. That would
protect it from misuse as camouflage for the elective dictatorship. The
Conservatives grasped the opportunity. 'Labour attacks Queen' touches the
nationalist nerve Mr Major hoped to reach when he spoke last Friday. You can
see the Tory train of thought. Never mind the details of the proposals by
the opposition's spokesman on home affairs. They are merely common sense.
Forget the personal life of the Prince of Wales, or the difficulties into
which the minor members of the house of Windsor have stumbled. They are
merely show business.
Concentrate on the Queen herself, the institution, the flag, the nation. Mr
Peter Lilley has done so. 'Labour voters are usually in my experience very
conservative, very pro-monarchy, very pro-Britain,' the secretary for social
security observed at the weekend. There has been plenty of time to get this
kind of thinking into people's heads. It was in 1838 that Peel delineated as
Conservative principles 'the maintenance of the Peerage and the Monarchy -
the continuance of the just powers and attributes of King, Lords, and
Commons . . .' I, and perhaps you, may think that a century and a half later
some rational modifications would improve our polity, but our elevated
opinion may carry little weight when set against bar-room salutes to 'Queen
and Country'.
Yet Labour has no choice but to do battle on this dangerous ground. In
nearly every other area it is the 'me too' party. Privatisation? Labour will
leave untouched whatever it finds in the private sector. Tax increases? Not
us, guv. Schools? We'll do what the Conservatives do, but rename it. Health?
Ditto. Increase public spending? Perish the thought. Changing the nature of
the state is another matter. Labour will undertake what its leader, lovingly
quoted by Mr Major, has called 'the most extensive package of constitutional
reform ever proposed by a British government'. That, said the prime
minister, was a 'sort of teenage madness'.
You could throw in one other small item - the European Union. Broadly
speaking, Labour is for it, the Conservatives increasingly against it. It
was Lady Thatcher who dramatised the connection between Europe, the monarchy
and nationhood when, as prime minister, she spoke of the single currency as
a threat to the Queen's head on the coinage. Conservative Eurosceptics tend
to be Peelites; they view the institutions of England, and the character of
the English, as strengths that 'enabled this country, in her contests and
the fearful rivalry of war, to extort the admiration of the world'.
That may have been stirring stuff in 1838. Today, with the nation in reduced
circumstances, the British constitution clearly needs modernising. To say
that what Parliament ordains is all the law you need is no longer tenable.
If Ulster can have an assembly, why not Scotland? The Crown must adapt to
survive. The Commons should sit for a fixed term. The people should be given
a choice on electoral reform. Labour must counter emotional declarations of
greatness with suchlike reasoned propositions. Alas, bombast usually wins.
Reform sounds sensible to me. But does it stand a chance against 'the Queen,
God bless her'?
