Divisions between the party's two traditions surfaced at Brighton

Everyone thought the disputes had been settled when the Liberals and Social
Democrats merged to form the Liberal Democrats five years ago.
But, as they departed from a near-disastrous Brighton conference yesterday,
the two traditions were struggling to hide their divisions. For former
Liberals it had been a triumphant week. They voted to legalise cannabis and
tried to abolish the monarchy.
'It's been just like an old-style Liberal conference,' said Mr John Tilley,
the new leader of Kingston Council in south London. 'I can't remember the
last time I saw the party's youth and its radical activists in such great
form.'
But for the former Social Democrats it had been a week of torment. The
radicalism of the party's youth groups had been embarrassing, the economic
policies were vague and self-contradictory and the tabloids were
resurrecting the 'loony' image that haunted the Liberals.
A former SDP parliamentary candidate said: 'We've got to do much better than
this to be taken seriously by the public. You can't debate cannabis without
comprehensively discussing crime. Some of these people don't care whether
they get elected or not.'
Several delegates said the divisions between the two groups - above all over
whether to strike a deal with Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour leader - had
turned the conference into the most disorganised for years.
Most Liberals with a tradition of fighting Labour in local elections are
against any rapprochement with Mr Blair. Former SDP members, many of whom
came from Labour ranks, find it easier to envisage a deal with the new
Labour leadership.
Mr Neil Sherlock, a traditional Liberal activist and speechwriter for Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, said: 'The obsession with Blair meant we
completely took our eye off the ball. The party did not bring together the
different views of its policy groups on the economy. We need to work on that
urgently.'
Another delegate, Mr Jonathan Davies, a former SDP member from Hendon in
north London, said the conference had been too pre-occupied with relations
with other parties and had failed to make the most of its electoral
successes.
'We have just won thousands of local authority seats in the council
elections,' he said. 'And yet, the one thing the party did not do this week
is celebrate its new councillors. Any other party would have done so.'
A few MPs were still smiling at the end. Mr Robert MacLennan, the party's
new president, struck a surreal note by telling delegates it had been a
'great week'. Mr Archy Kirkwood, the chief whip, admitted there had been
presentational difficulties, but added: 'The conference must offer a
showcase of our policies in the run-up to the election.'
There was genuine satisfaction, too, that the party had debated issues such
as drugs and the monarchy, in spite of their political sensitivity. 'These
are the issues being debated in the pubs and clubs,' said Mr John Pointon, a
young delegate from St Helens, Merseyside. 'Other parties just avoid them.'
But for all the confidence of Mr Ashdown's closing speech, many departing
delegates were at odds over the biggest issue of all - how to deal with
Labour.
'Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams and all those SDP people should either
get out of the party or shut up,' said Mr Ralph Bancroft, a veteran
campaigner for the Liberals in Harrow, north London. 'They have done us an
enormous amount of damage over the past few weeks. Let's concentrate on our
own policies.'
But Ms Sarah Prentice, a young councillor in Lambeth, south London, said:
'We have got to think about a strategy towards Labour. Their leader is a
very talented, very able personality. We have to be realistic.'
The debate over Labour will run and run. Yesterday the Liberal Democrats
went back to their constituencies and prepared for Tony Blair.
