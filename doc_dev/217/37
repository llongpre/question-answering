Mr Paddy Ashdown was last night struggling to restore his grip over the
Liberal Democrats after the party's Brighton conference again overturned his
efforts to present a more disciplined image to the electorate.
A defeat for the leadership over its approach to a minimum wage was
accompanied by renewed manoeuvring over the party's relationship with the
Labour party. Sir David Steel, a former party leader, added his voice to the
chorus of senior figures calling for the Liberal Democrats to abandon the
pretence that it is neutral between a Labour or Conservative victory at the
next general elections. He suggested that the Liberal Democrats could have
substantial input into a Labour government led by Mr Tony Blair.
With many of the party's activists vehemently opposed to a close
relationship with Labour, Mr Ashdown has resisted publicly endorsing the
stance of the majority of his senior colleagues.
The Liberal Democrat leader sees the potential for much increased
co-operation with Mr Blair but he wants to move slowly to ensure that he
takes his party with him. He is concerned also not to put the Labour leader
in a position where Mr Blair might be forced publicly to renounce the idea
of any partnership.
Mr Ashdown will be looking for signals from Labour that it wants a thaw in
relations. In the longer term, any formal arrangement between the two
parties would depend on Mr Blair embracing a proportional voting system for
elections to the House of Commons.
In yesterday's debate on employment, the conference defied a plea from Mr
Ashdown and his colleagues at Westminster to avoid committing the party to a
minimum wage. Encouraged by Baroness Williams to reject the unanimous
position of the 23 Liberal Democrat MPs, the conference voted to bind the
party to a regionally based system of minimum wage rates to prevent
exploitation of low-paid workers.
The decision marked the second defeat for Mr Ashdown in two days. On Monday
the party voted against the leader to reject a motion to decriminalise
cannabis. Both decisions were seen as a setback to Mr Ashdown's attempts to
present the party to the electorate as distinctive but disciplined. Senior
Liberal Democrats fear they face a third defeat this morning over their tax
and spending proposals.
The leadership, however, was spared further embarrassment when the
conference rejected a motion calling for the abolition of the monarchy in
favour of a republican constitution.
