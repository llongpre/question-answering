which they almost certainly are - the Queen's annus horribilis is going to
drag out through every remaining day of this month until the bells ring out
the old year at midnight on December 31. But it seems inconceivable that
things will end there. For despite the expressions of sympathy and support,
there now appears every prospect that, for both the Queen and her visibly
disintegrating family, 1993 may well be an annus even more horribilis.
Consider the facts. In the course of the past seven days, there has been the
announcement of the Princess Royal's second wedding, which is being rushed
through today with express speed. In between, there has been the news of the
apparently amicable separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales, by
comparison with which all the previous royal exposures, conflagrations and
publicity disasters of this year pale into insignificance.
Despite conservative fears and republican hopes, the monarchy is not
self-destructing. However open to ridicule it is in danger of becoming in
the popular press, the show will go on. But the stage has been reached when
the monarchy is pushing the panic button, loud and clear. For the only
conclusion that can be drawn from the terms of the separation settlement is
that neither the palace nor the government has the slightest idea what will
happen next.
It is being insisted in certain official quarters that this separation
arrangement is itself the solution; that the Prince and Princess of Wales
should now be allowed to live their separate and private lives; and that the
future is assured because they will one day come together again as king and
queen. But the settlement has only to be summarised in this way for it to be
clear that, far from being a solution to a problem, it will only make things
worse.
It might well be the case that, the bizarre nature of these terms and future
provisions notwithstanding, nothing else could have been done at this time.
The royal couple could not have gone on as they were; but neither party
wanted an instant divorce, so what else was there to do? And it is also the
case that, now the long-expected and long-predicted separation has actually
happened, the mood of the public is not as easy to gauge or to predict as
had seemed likely before the event.
The truth is that it is not yet clear - and might not be clear for many
months - just how this latest royal misadventure is going to play out in
terms of the public's reaction and response. Already, though, there are
ominous signs that this settlement is not going to work. For all the claims
that there are no constitutional issues and implications, there seems a real
possibility that the monarchy will suffer grave damage. And if a gravely
damaged monarchy is not a constitutional issue, then what is?
Take Prince Charles first. Whatever the reality of his marriage and its
breakdown, recent press coverage shows he is regarded widely as a man who
has failed spectacularly to do the one thing which, rightly or wrongly,
people still expect the heir to the throne to do: namely, to live his family
life successfully. The prince, so this argument runs, has spent a great deal
of time telling society what is good for it. But what right has he to do
this when he has made such a conspicuous hash of his own life?
This leads us to Princess Diana. She might be the most glamorous woman in
the country - indeed, in the world - combining in a remarkable way the
attributes of mother and martyr, saint and cover girl. And it might also be
that this settlement, in which she keeps both the children and her crown, is
a personal triumph for her which she was able to accomplish only because of
her extraordinary public standing. But the idea that, despite all the
sadness of her marriage to Prince Charles, she might still want - and
expect? - to be queen, seems incredible.
Then there is the question of Charles and Diana as separated spouses. What
is going to happen now? Will they have affairs and take lovers? Is it
realistic to suppose that they will be able to keep it a secret if they do?
The prospect of the heir to the throne and his wife leading separate sex
lives must surely be a tabloid editor's dream. In short, the insatiable
appetite of the media for more scandals and more revelations inevitably will
be stimulated by this separation settlement.
What, then, are the realistic prospects of their joint coronation? Only
royal advisers desperate to find a ray of hope - and completely out of touch
with the public mood - could have expected that this proposal would fly. The
idea that at some future, unspecified date, Charles and Diana will give up
their separate lives and come together once more, however briefly, as king
and queen, is an insult to common sense and to the Church of England under
whose auspices the sacrament of their coronation would take place.
Then there is the unfortunate figure of Prince William: the product, like
his mother, of a broken marriage. Already, he is being seen in some quarters
as the next best hope. If only the Prince of Wales will renounce his right
of succession, the argument runs, the crown can pass on, unimpaired, to his
eldest son and this regrettable interlude can be forgotten. But it is not
clear, despite much speculation on the subject, that William - who must have
suffered much already - can be the person to solve the difficulties caused
by his parents' marital break-up.
In short, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this separation settlement
will not settle or stabilise anything. On the contrary, in many ways it can
only make matters worse, more risky and more uncertain than when the royal
pair maintained an official fiction of marriage. The uncertainties will
last, not just into 1993 but for an unforeseeably protracted future. There
might indeed have been no alternative: but that serves only to show how
intractable things have become, and how miserable the prospects appear.
This brings us to the broader issue to which this latest royal disaster
relates. The separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales will not only
intensify the prurient intrusiveness of the tabloid press: it will also
intensify the debate about the purpose, function and future of the monarchy
itself (a debate, it must be remembered, to which the Queen herself gave her
royal imprimatur recently).
In the long perspective of history, the problem which, it seemed, the
British had solved brilliantly was that of finding something for a monarchy
to do once its traditional functions - as law-giver and warrior - had been
given up or taken away.
The solution which evolved was 'constitutional monarchy' which, essentially,
meant trading power for pageantry, dynastic profligacy for a royal family,
and Germanic accents for an imperial crown.
The fundamental difficulty for the monarchy today is that, during the
present queen's reign, these functions and justifications have been
gradually but inexorably eroded. She herself is among a declining number in
England who believe in the Commonwealth. And the pageantry of which royal
weddings were such an integral part has surely now become questionable: it
certainly has for Princess Anne at Crathie church today.
Deprived of these 'traditional' functions, it is not altogether clear what
there is left for the British monarchy to do. Or, put more depressingly, it
is not at all clear what the sovereign, her relatives and her advisers
believe there is to do. Perhaps the course is set already and a Monaco
monarchy - trivialised and a perpetual scandal-machine - is indeed the only
future function on offer. (After all, in the long run, the British monarchy
has swung repeatedly from respectability to scandal and back to
respectability again. Perhaps what we are now witnessing is merely the next
inexorable swing of the pendulum).
The British monarchy has survived damaging troublesbefore - most obviously
in the time of the delinquent children of King George III - and it could
well be that it will survive the latest scandals as well. But the 1990s are
not the 1820s. Then, Britain was a rigidly hierarchical society and, in the
majority of countries, monarchy was still the natural order of things.
Today, by contrast, monarchy can be seen as an anachronistic relic which, if
it is to survive as anything more than a tawdry and demeaning soap opera,
must do something serious, sensible and substantial to justify itself.
Thus far, that is the challenge to which the embattled and beleaguered House
of Windsor has failed conspicuously to rise this year. What is the British
monarchy for? What sort of monarchy have we got? What sort of monarchy do we
need? Do we need a monarchy at all? As the royal family falls apart before
our curious eyes, these questions are going to become more, not less,
insistent.
If the Queen is serious in wanting debate on the monarchy, she will be well
advised to address the issues in her Christmas message. Platitudes about
peace on earth, happy families and her annus horribilis will no longer
suffice.
