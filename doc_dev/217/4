FT  29 JUN 94 / Benn says 'loophole' will let him block royal succession

Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP for Chesterfield, yesterday claimed to have
found a constitutional loophole that may put an end to Britain's
1,000-year-old hereditary monarchy.
His claim raises the republican flag at Westminster at a time of increasing
controversy over Prince Charles's fitness to inherit the throne.
It coincides with the transmission later today of an ITV documentary in
which the prince is said to admit adultery and to promote the
disestablishment of the Church of England.
The claim caused a storm among defenders of the monarchy.
Mr Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said Mr
Benn's statement was 'of such temerity that, in times past, he would have
been charged with treason'.
Mr Benn said 'years' of research had shown that the succession to the throne
could be blocked by a single objection by a member of the Privy Council, the
medieval eminent body that advises the sovereign.
Mr Benn, a privy councillor since 1964, said it was his 'solemn intention'
to prevent the publication of the proclamation announcing the accession of
the next monarch after the death or abdication of the Queen.
But constitutional experts said that Mr Benn's threat to block the
succession rests on the assertion that the proclamation would be invalid
without unanimous assent.
The traditional wording used in the proclamation asserts that the new
sovereign is proclaimed 'with one voice and consent of tongue and heart' of
the privy councillors and 'gentlemen of quality' present.
Mr Nigel Nicholls, clerk to the privy council, said it was not clear whether
a privy councillor's objection would block the publication of the
proclamation.
Even if it did, that would not affect the accession of the new monarch.
