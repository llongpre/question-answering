FT  06 SEP 94 / Ashdown aims conference to bolster broad appeal

Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, is seeking a formula
which will help his party demonstrate its ability to remain a distinctive
political force when it opens the party conference season at Brighton on
September 18.
Appearances by Sir Brian Nicholson, president of the CBI, and Mr John Monks,
general secretary of the TUC, at fringe meetings will help bolster the
party's claim to have a broader appeal than either the Conservatives or
Labour.
But Mr Ashdown is still at odds with some of the senior figures in the
party, including Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the Liberal Democrat leader in
the Lords, over the desirability of publicly emphasising its readiness to
co-operate with Mr Tony Blair's new-look Labour party.
The difficulties Mr Ashdown faces in staking out the ground on which the
party can exert a dominant influence in the run-up to the next general
election were played down when the conference agenda was published
yesterday.
Party managers want the conference to focus on successes at local government
level and in parliamentary by-elections, which increased the number of
Liberal Democrat MPs in the Commons to 23.
Mr Charles Kennedy, the party president, insisted yesterday that these
outweighed the party's disappointing showing in having only two MPs elected
to the European parliament in June.
Demands for the repeal of the financial services act and the establishment
of a powerful regulatory body to oversee the operation of financial
institutions are also made. Mr Jeremy Hanley, chairman of the Conservative
party, said the Liberal Democrats were showing their 'true colours'in
agreeing to debate the abolition of the monarchy.
He stressed that this followed publication of a 'punitive taxation policy'.
Mr Hanley said: 'How those who voted Liberal Democrat at recent by-elections
must feel cheated and betrayed by what portrays itself as a moderate party
but is in reality more socialist than the socialists.'
