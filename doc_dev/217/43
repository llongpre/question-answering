ROYAL FORTUNE: TAX, MONEY AND THE MONARCHY By Phillip Hall Bloomsbury Pounds

ELIZABETH R By Antony Jay BBC Books Pounds 14.95
Britain's monarchy has been around since the ninth century. It existed four
centuries before parliament, three centuries before the law courts. So
whoever is on the throne should be used to outbreaks of royal unpopularity.
It comes with the job.
Nevertheless, Queen Elizabeth II, who celebrates 40 years on the throne
today, is bound to be conscious that her subjects have become increasingly
vexed of late about the issue of her tax-exempt status. In terms of popular
debate, the question of the Queen's exemption generates far more heat than
equally serious ones such as her support for the honours system, or her role
as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Three new books take up the
issue.
The Monarchy, the Central Office of Information's official handbook on
British royalty, states the position simply: 'As part of the royal
prerogative, the Queen does not pay tax on either her private wealth and
income or her Civil List payments, unless parliament decides otherwise.'
This begs for explanation, particularly since opinion polls show that
three-quarters of the public feel that the Queen should pay tax. Phillip
Hall, a sociology lecturer at a west London college of further education,
does his best to elaborate in Royal Fortune: Tax, Money and the Monarchy.
A big portion of his book 'reveals the long and hitherto hidden history of
royal tax-paying and the devious and secretive ways by which it was brought
to an end'. Of the seven changes in royal tax status since 1910 only two
were made public at the time and one of the crucial files explaining changes
in the king's tax status in the late 1930s was destroyed in 1977.
The thesis is that throughout the 20th century, while more and more people
have been caught in the tax net, British monarchs have lobbied successfully
to escape taxation and to accumulate wealth. The Swedish king pays tax on
his private income, as does the Japanese emperor. Italy ended the Vatican's
tax exemption on its investment income in 1968. According to Hall, the Queen
is Britain's richest person - so why shouldn't she pay her share? Equity
demands that she should, according to Hall.
Partiality harms his case. Despite a heroic trawl through the archives,
Hall's arguments are weakened by his own bias against the monarchy.
When The Economist - which has no obvious anti-monarchical bias - decided to
look into the subject of the Queen's finances, it was taken to task for
suggesting that the Queen's fortune is probably less than Pounds 50m, rather
than more than Pounds 7bn, as is sometimes suggested. The journalist Paul
Foot dismissed the estimate as 'crude establishment disinformation printed
in an establishment newspaper to protect the Queen from (Hall's) critical
book'.
It is tempting to blame outbreaks of royal unpopularity on ill-informed and
ill-disposed members of the media. But, as Antony Jay, author of the
television series Yes Minister, says in Elizabeth R, the press is rather
like the old London mob. 'They may have got hold of the wrong information
and ideas, their demands may be impossible to put into practice and their
methods may be questionable, but the feelings . . . are a reality and it is
dangerous to ignore them.'
The Queen's tax-free life is an example. 'There is something about royal tax
exemption that stirs primitive emotions in the British taxpayer's breast: a
feeling of 'I pay, so why shouldn't she?', which cannot be refuted by
rational argument,' says Jay.
The Queen is not the only public figure with special tax privileges, but she
is the only one who does not pay any income tax or death duties. Clearly,
the tax-free status of her personal fortune is a big perk. But since its
size and rate of growth are unknown, it is impossible to judge the scale of
the privilege.
Jay differs from Hall in his view that the Queen's personal wealth is not in
the same league as the Duke of Westminster's or even the Sainsbury family's.
One way of defusing the controversy would be to release a semi-official
estimate of the Queen's personal wealth. However, putting a figure on the
fortune is complicated by the fact that there is no clear distinction
between what belongs to the state and what is the monarch's own.
Another possibility would be for the Queen to follow the Prince of Wales's
example and pay 25 per cent of income in lieu of tax. But this opens the
issue of whether it would be dignified for the Queen to take steps to
minimise even her voluntary payment. She can hardly go offshore.
And if she starts paying taxes, will she be allowed to vote? In law, the
Queen as a private person can do no wrong. She is immune from civil or
criminal proceedings and cannot be sued. So what happens if there is a
dispute with the tax authorities? Walter Bagehot might turn in his grave,
but perhaps it is time for a Select Committee to look into the whole matter.
