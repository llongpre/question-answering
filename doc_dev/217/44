  [Text] Johannesburg April 8 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini told African National Congress President Nelson 
Mandela on Friday [8 April] morning he would have to distance 
himself from the ANC's shooting of Zulu marchers outside the 
ANC's Shell House head office before their dialogue continued. 
The Zulu monarch met Mr Mandela at an undisclosed venue before a 
meeting between the king, Mr Mandela, President F W de Klerk and 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  The king's presentation to Mr Mandela was released by Mr. 
Buthelezi's office. 
  "Until and unless you personally distance yourself from the 
shedding of the innocent blood of my father's people by means of 
your personal initiative leading to the conviction of those who 
are guilty of this crime, our dialogue will remain difficult if 
not impossible," King Zwelithini said. 
  King Zwelithini said immediate steps were required from Mr 
Mandela to heal the wounds arising from the Shell House 
massacre. He asked that Mr Mandela make available all 
information related to the killings. 
  "I ask that you do whatever is in your power as the 
president 
of the ANC to ensure that all those who plotted, organised and 
executed the massacre are arrested and tried for their crime," 
he said. 
  The Zulu king also condemned ANC statements on the monarchy 
and the kwaZulu government. 
  "The insults that many spokespersons of the ANC, and 
particularly the Natal leaders of the ANC, have hurled at me at 
numerous times, that I am on the payroll of the kwaZulu 
government or that my Prime Minister Prince Mangosuthu is my 
paymaster, is something which is more than just offensive." 
  He said any action taken against the kwaZulu legislative 
assembly would be an action against him as reigning king. 
  He said Mr Mandela and the ANC had repeatedly flouted royal 
protocol in their approaches to the institution of the Zulu 
monarchy. 
  He detailed the failed attempts at arranging a meeting 
between himself and Mr Mandela and said it would be wrong for 
him not to get "these things off my chest". 
  However, he said he did not expect issues of protocol to 
cloud the discussions. "I put them down for the record without 
expecting them to be the cause of any acrimony between us." 
  King Zwelithini said he regarded the state of emergency in 
Natal/kwaZulu as an invasion. "I want to make it clear that I, 
the king of the Zulu nation, consider the declaration of a state 
of emergency in kwaZulu to be an act of foreign aggression, an 
invasion of our territory and a rape of our national dignity and 
pride. 
  "I...shall never recognise the legitimacy of the actions 
taken in terms of the declaration of the state of emergency." 
  He said the stigmatisation of his uncle, Chief 
Kwaphindangene 
(Chief Minister Buthelezi) had also caused offence. "It was he 
who destroyed the South African Government's homeland policy, 
and it was his refusal to accept so-called independence that 
destroyed Mr John Vorster's and Mr P W Botha's dream of 
establishing a confederation of South African states." 
  King Zwelithini said the summit was taking place against the 
background of two direct and intolerable attacks on the Zulu 
nation -- the Shell House massacre and the state of emergency. 
  "I have only done as much as is needed to clear things from 
my heart so that we can talk openly and simply about the prime 
purpose of our meeting". 
  He said the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the 
sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom. He said sovereignty could not 
be negotiated or conferred upon kwaZulu by anybody. 
  "Throughout the period of conquest and subjugation, it was 
Zulu identity which kept the Zulus intact as a vibrant force 
against colonialism and apartheid." The Zulus had never been 
crushed, he said. 
  He said sovereignty forged by history could not be undone 
by political edict or by the passing of a law or by the forcing 
of a constitution on the people of a sovereign kingdom. "Now 
that apartheid has been finally destroyed and a new South Africa 
is being shaped, there shall emerge a sovereign Zulu kingdom. 
  "I am not prepared to talk to you...about whether or not 
there shall be a sovereign Zulu kingdom in the new South Africa. 
  "The only thing to talk about are the modalities of bringing 
the sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom into full recognitio and 
relating the kingdom properly to the rest of South Africa." 
  He said the kingdom would be bounded by the Transvaal in the 
west, Mozambique and Swaziland in the north and Transkei and 
Lesotho in the south and south-west. 
  He said the 1993 constitution, even as amended, extended the 
"greedy arm of Pretoria right across the Zulu kingdom". He said 
he rejected the constitution. He said the kingdom needed a 
militia which the constitution did not provide. 
  King Zwelithini said he had been forced to act decisively by 
the failure of negotiations to deliver a federal dispensation. 
Nor was the negotiators' provision for traditional leaders 
sufficient recognition of the Zulu monarchy. 
  "As things stand now I cannot encourage my father's people 
to 
vote on April 26-28 and thereby lend legitimacy to what will be 
the destruction of the very foundations on which the sovereignty 
of the Zulu kingdom rests." 
  He said Mr Mandela was rushing into an election rejected by 
himself and the Zulu people. 
  King Zwelithini said a constitution had been written for the 
state of kwaZulu/Natal in December, 1992. It set out the Zulu 
nation's bottomline demands. 
  He said he had been hoping for a a federal system in which 
the constitution would be recognised. 
  He called on all Zulus to unite and to defend kwaZulu 
freedom 
and sovereignty. 
  "The road ahead is not going to be an easy one," he warned. 
  "We the Zulu nation convene today on the battleground which 
subjugated the freedom of our forefathers. 
  "We here today proclaim before the world our freedom and 
sovereignty and our unwavering will to defend it at all costs. 
  "Whether we end up as part of one federal state of South 
Africa or as a completely autonomous state will depend on what 
you and others in South Africa do to me and my people. The key 
thing is whether you are prepared to listen to our just 
aspirations or whether, like those who conquered us, you think 
you must trample with your feet on those just aspirations of my 
nation."
