   She's only fifth in line to the throne, but from
the hospital crowds to the headlines, the birth of Britain's newest
princess has shown the royal family working a magic that defies
even the experts.
   ``I can't think why there's such hysterical interest really,''
said Charles Kidd, editor of Debrett's Peerage, which chronicles
Britain's blue bloods.
   ``But it just keeps increasing ... Maybe it's because there's
been a leveling out of social classes _ which is very good, but at
the same time does make for rather boring reading,'' Kidd said in
an interview.
   ``And these characters are supposed to be a bit bigger than
life, or we're led to believe they are,'' he added.
   And so they seemed Tuesday.
   Almost all of Britain's dozen national newspapers splashed
across their front pages the Monday night birth of the Princess of
York to Queen Elizabeth's second son, Andrew, and his wife, Sarah.
   Radio and television networks led bulletins repeatedly with the
news, edging out the cease-fire agreement in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Only the Communist Morning Star and the newest upscale
newspaper, the 375,000-circulation Independent, ignored or paid
little attention to the birth of the queen's fifth grandchild.
   ``We are not much interested in minor royals, but we did record
the event,'' said John Price, news editor of the Independent, which
gave the story three lines on page 2. ``The Independent's view is
that these people don't matter.''
   It was a lonely view.
   Compared with the attention given to Europe's other major
surviving monarchies _ the Spanish, the Scandinavians, the Dutch
and the Belgians _ Britain erupted with royal fever.
   The monarchs of Sweden, Denmark and Norway attract plenty of
attention among their Scandinavian subjects, but not much elsewhere.
   In the Netherlands, by the time former Queen Juliana's youngest
grandchild, also Juliana, was born in October 1981, interest in
royal babies had cooled. The little Juliana was the ex-queen's 13th
grandchild.
   In Sweden, the birth in 1982 of a third child, Princess
Madeleine, to King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia, dominated the
local news but did not make world headlines.
   Royal babies not in direct line to the throne receive scant
attention. Only one newspaper in Norway mentioned the birth in
Brazil last month of Norwegian King Olav's second great-grandchild.
   In Belgium, pictures of King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola seldom
appear in then news. The heir to the throne, Baudouin's nephew,
Prince Albert, keeps even further out of the limelight.
   In contrast, the royal family of the tiny principality of Monaco
has the photographers in hot pursuit, particularly Princess
Caroline and Princess Stephanie, daughters of Prince Rainier and
the late Grace Kelly.
   But even for them, the scrutiny palls compared to the life of
the British monarch's children and their offspring.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage,
attributes the publicity given Andrew's wife, Sarah, partly to what
he says has become an international hobby _ British royal-watching
_ and partly to her unusual background for a royal bride.
   The former Sarah Ferguson had no title, was a commoner, had two
serious romances before Andrew, and pursued her career in a graphic
arts company.
   He believes that historians will credit the former Miss Ferguson
with ``taking the royal family into the 21st century.''
   ``From the literally thousands of letters we get _ from
Americans, Germans, Japanese _ wanting information about the royal
family, it's clear that royal-watching has become as much a hobby
as stamp-collecting,'' said Brooks-Baker.
   The birth of the Princess of York received more publicity in
Britain than did the birth in 1947 of Prince Charles, heir to the
throne, he said.
   ``This interest in things royal is a great snowball ...
interesting and also terrifying,'' said Brooks-Baker.
   ``As this soap opera becomes more and more universal, one
wonders where it is going to end and whether it will crush the very
people it is portraying. I don't know.''
