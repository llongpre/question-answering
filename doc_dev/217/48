Time to put my money where my mouth is and produce a few fearless forecasts
for 1994, even though, on balance, it looks like being a muddling year -
neither memorable nor especially horrible though marked, come autumn, by the
first tangible wisps of PMT (pre-millennial tension).
None of these forecasts is based on econometric modelling or indeed on
anything more highfalutin than hunch and experience. They are serious
predictions, though I am happy to confess - most forecasters never do this -
that wishful thinking has infected most of them.
Off we go:
Stock markets world-wide will endure a nastier ride than most pundits are
predicting. The FT-SE 100 will set a record high of approximately 3,660
before Easter, then endure months of choppiness before falling like a stone
in September or October, finishing the year below 3,000. I myself plan to go
almost totally liquid on February 24, which happens to be my birthday.
Contrary to what the experts say, gold will glitter in 1994 as it dawns on
market-makers that every 15 seconds another 45 people are born on earth and
that 10 of them, at least, are likely to be gold-bugs. In 1994 gold will
again approach Dollars 500 an ounce (Dollars 391 at present) as a prelude to
startling gains at the end of the century.
It will be a good year for Bill Clinton - Washington's dozy columnists will
finally warm to him - and a good year, too, for Hilary Clinton, her
husband's possible successor as US president in seven years' time.
But it will be a cruel and desperate period for Europe's leaders,
particularly John Major, whose days as UK prime minister are - mercifully -
numbered. Major won't be pushed; he will go voluntarily, late in the year,
probably late at night, his poor wife in tow, deciding, not unnaturally,
that enough is enough and that he has already endured more obloquy than
mortal man can bear. (Why should he worry? He will become a rich and
much-loved pensioner). His successor - but only for a short while - will be
Kenneth Clarke, the Mr Blobby of UK politics. Eventually, however, the
present chancellor's astonishing good luck will dribble to an end and he
will be stabbed in the back - with svelteness, of course - by Michael
Portillo.
John Smith will meander through another low-key year as Britain's Opposition
leader and will (or will not) move towards some form of alliance with
Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats. If he doesn't, the Tories
stand a chance of stealing the next election just as they stole the last
one.
Something unpleasant, painful and messy will happen to bossy Virginia
Bottomley, the UK health secretary. I won't say what; it would ruin the fun.
Soccer's World Cup will be tremendously successful, with Norway beating
Brazil 3-1 in the final. The success of the competition will lead millions
of American sports fans to wonder why, all these years, they let themselves
be fobbed off with such girl's-blouse sports as baseball and basketball.
It will be a good year for Prince Charles as more and more people come to
appreciate the attraction of having a divorced heir to the British throne.
What could be more fin de siecle, modern or sophisticated? (The divorce
itself will come next year). Behind the scenes, Queen Elizabeth II will be
informing her less-than-close relatives that the gravy train has departed
and that the monarchy is being downsized while revelling secretly in the
knowledge that she and her heirs are safe.
Correspondingly, the Church of England will stumble ever faster towards
disestablishment and outer darkness.
The Grand National steeplechase will again be a fiasco.
People who hunt animals - big ones, small ones - will feel more and more
like pariahs as revulsion at their activities becomes pronounced.
Newsdesks will realise that people are fed up with coverage of Russia and
China. What people want most is about 30 years' silence from Russia and
China while those two unfortunate countries ponder their mistakes and
smarten up their acts. That is my fondest wish for 1994: that we hear
nothing more from Moscow and Beijing until New Year's Day, 2024.
