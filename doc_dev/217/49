FT  27 NOV 93 / 'Not a salesman but he can do his bit for Britain': The
search for a role for the Prince of Wales

If the Prince of Wales intended this week to refocus debate on more serious
aspects of his responsibilities, he cannot have been disappointed.
His remarks, which made known his frustrations over lack of government
support during overseas royal visits, created an instant stir around
Whitehall and Westminster which seems certain to lead to a reappraisal of
the prince's potential role as an ambassador for Britain.
Ministers were this week quick to acknowledge the value of the prince in
helping promote Britain in important overseas markets. They were equally
ready to accept that more could be done to fully exploit his unique
position.
Within hours of the prince's views becoming known on Monday Mr John Major
was pledging his support for moves to improve the commercial effectiveness
of the heir to the throne's overseas visits.
But when the dust has settled, what is the real scope for ensuring that the
value of the prince, in the context of helping to promote British companies
and products, can be further enhanced?
Both the Foreign Office and the Department of Trade and Industry are anxious
to emphasise the support they already provide for overseas royal visits. But
if the programme of visits has in the past been seen by officials more as a
time-consuming nuisance than a positive opportunity, the prince's remarks
and the political fall-out will bring a renewed effort to consider such
trips in a more strategic light.
With Downing Street 'keen' to do everything possible to help, an improvement
in co-ordination between departments when visits are being planned and the
provision of ministerial back-up during tours is on the agenda.
The DTI is examining ways of better exploiting the prince's apparent
readiness to help wave the flag for Britain and Mr Richard Needham, the
trade minister, will soon discuss ideas directly with the prince.
St James' palace has stressed that it does not see the issue necessarily as
one of financial resources but of a more supportive approach to reflect a
better appreciation of the potential value of overseas royal visits to the
economy.
But some in business were this week anxious to emphasise that the prince
himself will have to demonstrate a greater flexibility and readiness to
participate in more commercially-oriented overseas exercises.
The constraints placed on him by royal protocol were exposed this week, when
it emerged that the prince will be in Australia in January at the same time
as a business mission led by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary. They are unlikely to meet, however, because royal protocol
dictates that the prince cannot be seen to participate directly in trade
promotion in countries which recognise him as heir to the throne.
As one of his aides has emphasised: 'Though he can do his bit for Britain,
he is not a salesman.'
But according to one of Britain's most senior industrialists, who has
participated in numerous overseas trade missions, some of them involving the
prime minister: 'In the past, he (the prince) has proved extremely choosy
about the sort of missions abroad in which he is prepared to participate. He
generally only wants to take part in events directly linked to the
organisations he has helped start or in which he is directly involved. If
that attitude is now a thing of the past, it is very good news.'
Several in business this week quoted the example of the Duke of Kent,
vice-chairman of British Overseas Trade Board, as an example of how a
'hands-on' member of the royal family worked actively to assist the national
exporting effort. The duke, however, will not be the next king.
Another senior industrialist said: 'I see no good reason why the prince
should not head up trade missions in the same way the prime minister does.
He could not be expected to negotiate, but then neither is the prime
minister.
'We are talking about a modern monarchy trying to find a modern role. It
cannot have it both ways, simultaneously trying to cling to past
conventions.'
