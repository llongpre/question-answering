rejected

Liberal Democrats yesterday voted by an overwhelming majority against a
policy of abolition of the monarchy, but called for 'a radical trimming' of
the royal family's budget.
In the first debate at a political party conference on the issue, several
speakers argued that the monarchy should be discontinued after the reign of
the present Queen because hereditary rule was unacceptable in a modern
democracy.
But delegates were strongly swayed by the argument that the party's standing
with the public would be badly damaged if it backed abolition.
Several party MPs had privately expressed concern that, after voting to
decriminalise cannabis, Liberal Democrats risked antagonising public opinion
by passing another unprecedented resolution.
Opening one of the best-attended debates of the conference, Mr Alex Wilcock
of Liberal Democratic Youth and Students said all government posts in a
democracy must be open to everyone, elected by the public and subject to
regular scrutiny.
'The monarchy fails on all these counts,' he said.
Another speaker, Mr Norman Baker, said he could not understand why a member
of the royal family like the Duke of Gloucester should receive an annual
salary of Pounds 100,000. 'You can tell a lot about a country that has a
Royal Mint, but a national debt,' he said.
However, Mr Archie Kirkwood, the party's chief whip in the Commons, appeared
to win over many of the delegates by arguing that they needed to attack the
abuse of power by government ministers rather than royalty.
Deciding not to call for the abolition of the monarchy 'subject to a
referendum', the conference instead called for a cut in the size of the
Civil List and 'the redefining of the roles of members of the royal family
apart from the monarch'.
