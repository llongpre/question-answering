  [Text] Parliament Feb 28 SAPA -- The status and position of 
the Zulu king had to be elevated above party politics, and the 
monarchy secured through effective constitutional safeguards, 
the state president, Mr F W de Klerk, said on Monday [28 
February]. 
  Addressing a special session of Parliament, he said he 
understood the concerns of King Goodwill Zwelithini and his 
people on the future of the Zulu monarchy. The government and 
the National Party supported the view that the Zulu kingdom 
should be given constitutional recognition. "The Zulu kingdom 
is recognised by us as a unique reality. It has a proud history 
and plays an important role in the life of the Zulu nation." 
  Mr de Klerk said the monarchy could be secured either in a 
constitution for kwaZulu/Natal or in the national constitution, 
or both. The government had been involved in serious and 
in-depth discussions on the issue of the Zulu monarchy but no 
specific agreement had yet been reached. However, negotiation 
would continue until agreement was reached.
