FT  27 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Queen taxed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH monarchy has been a remarkably successful institution. It has
also been a highly adaptable one. The adaptability of the monarchy largely
explains the success. The Queen's offer to pay taxes on her private income
and, as importantly, trim the civil list represents an excellent example of
the monarchy's flexibility. These changes, sensible in themselves, are also
more likely to strengthen the monarchy than weaken it.
Rationalists dislike monarchies. But constitutional monarchy has proved to
be an obstacle neither to economic progress nor to democratic stability. On
the contrary, their shrunken numbers include many of the world's richest
democracies: in Europe there are Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands,
Belgium and more recently Spain; in Asia, there is Japan. In these societies
the monarch's role as a living symbol of the state has proved consistent
with political stability and indeed one of its sources.
These monarchies have all changed markedly over time, as has the British. It
has survived a civil war and the decapitation of Charles I. It has outlived
the acquisition and collapse of the British empire. Above all, it has coped
with the transition from aristocracy to democracy.
Now it has to adapt to an age of populist suspicion and popular curiosity.
It has to tackle two specific problems: the all too visible foibles of minor
members of the royal family and the untaxed wealth of the Queen herself. By
yesterday's announcement the monarchy has done what it can, short of a
credible vow of poverty and personal perfection.
Nothing will stop the popular press from probing the private lives of
members of the royal family. But with the compensation for their public
services being reimbursed from the Queen's privy purse they may be
criticised less easily. Similarly, nothing will stop left-wing politicians
from complaining about the Queen's wealth. But properly taxed it becomes
just another inherited private fortune.
The monarch's role is fundamentally symbolic, but scandal and untaxed wealth
are unsatisfactory symbols. There had to be changes. Whether these go far
enough is another matter. A clearer definition of the monarch's role in the
state may be required, particularly if there are wider constitutional
changes. The future of the monarchy depends partly on the royal family
itself, but still more on the changing temper of the British people.
