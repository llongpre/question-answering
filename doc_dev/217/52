Few parties with the name Marxist-Leninist have ever won a free election.
But five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Nepal Communist party
(United Marxist Leninist) has accomplished this rare feat.
The communists are on the verge of forming a government after success in
last week's general election. The red flag has been hoisted in a country
with a constitutional monarch who held power until as late as 1990. Marx
would have been impressed with how quickly Nepal has apparently moved from
feudalism to socialism.
Yet all is not quite as it seems in the mountain kingdom. Despite their
ideologically correct name and the portraits of Marx and Lenin which adorn
the party offices, the Nepali communists bear little resemblance to
Bolsheviks.
Almost the first thing Mr Man Mohan Adhikari, the party leader, did after
his election victory was to call on King Birendra and pay his respects,
telling him he had nothing to fear; the communist party would 'firmly
support monarchy in Nepal as a symbol of unity' and 'pursue free-market
economic policies'.
The communists are much more nationalist than the purer forms of socialist
doctrine would permit. Mr Adhikari made much on the campaign trail of the
conservative Nepali Congress party government's allegedly close ties with
India. But he is hardly the first communist to stoke the fires of
patriotism.
The party has to approach government with caution. With only 88 seats in the
205-member parliament, it plans to rule as a minority government. It will
rely on tacit support from allies either in the Congress party or the
right-wing royalist grouping, the Rastriya Prajantra party. The prospects
seem uncertain.
The election was called after arguments erupted within the party between the
three at its head: Mr G. Koirala, 71, the former prime minister; Mr K.
Bhattarai, party president, 70, and Mr Ganesh Man Singh, 80, party supremo.
After decades of campaigns against royalist domination culminating in
demonstrations that ended royal rule in 1990, the three men had trouble
adjusting to running the government.
By this summer, the country had had enough of the party's record of
in-fighting and nepotism. So when Mr Koirala precipitated a general
election, voters took the opportunity to vote his party out of office.
Mr Adhikari, who at 72 is of the same generation as his Congress
counterparts, started his political career in the Indian independence
movement before moving to Nepal, where he spent several years in jail for
his attacks on the monarchy. For years, his party was split between
pro-Soviet and pro-China factions and received funds from North Korea. As
late as 1989 it supported the coup against Mr Mikhail Gorbachev.
But the international decline of communism and the advent of parliamentary
politics in Nepal after 1990 prompted the party into some long-overdue
revisionism from which it has emerged as more social democrat than
socialist.
A western diplomat in Kathmandu says: 'I think we could work with these
people. They are not guerrillas.'
