Two bulls cannot share the same kraal, runs an old African proverb.
This traditional wisdom is about to be tested in the South African province
of KwaZulu/Natal as yesterday the stage was set for a confrontation between
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party and minister
of home affairs in the government of national unity, and the traditional
monarch of the 9m-strong Zulu nation, King Goodwill Zwelithini, his nephew.
The outcome of the confrontation, triggered by the king's decision yesterday
to dismiss Chief Buthelezi as his 'prime minister', will shape the politics
of the province for the foreseeable future. For it could determine whether
its loyalty shifts from Chief Buthelezi, whose IFP secured 51 per cent of
the provincial vote in this year's election, to Nelson Mandela's African
National Congress.
What tipped the balance in the April election was the overwhelming backing
for the IFP in rural Natal, conservative, traditional and loyal to the king,
for the ANC's strength lay mainly in the towns and cities.
It is over this rural turf that Chief Buthelezi and the king will now be
fighting for control.
By dismissing Chief Buthelezi from the honorary post of traditional prime
minister to the royal house, the King is attempting to deprive the chief of
his most powerful political weapon: the ability to claim to act on behalf of
the Zulu nation.
Political analysts estimate that between 15-30 per cent of Inkatha's vote
was the direct result of the king's entry into the political fray on
Inkatha's behalf.
Although Inkatha's powerful political machine and complex patronage network
will continue to be able to mobilise large numbers of supporters, many
floating voters may now shift their allegiance to the ANC, damaging
Inkatha's prospects in next year's planned local elections.
It may also re-inflame political passions in KwaZulu-Natal, where Inkatha
and ANC-supporters have been in a virtual state of war that has claimed
thousands of lives since the mid-1980s.
Since the election, and Inkatha's decision to serve in the constitutionally
mandated government of national unity with the ANC and the National party,
violence has dropped markedly.
In the ongoing dispute between the ANC and Inkatha in the provincial
legislature on the allocation of cabinet posts and the location of the
regional capital, the king has remained studiously neutral.
However, in recent months there have been persistent rumours that the
relationship between the king and the chief had started to sour, partly as a
result of an apparent thawing of the king's attitude to the ANC.
King Goodwill has also dismissed his former bodyguards, who were political
appointments from the KwaZulu police controlled by Chief Buthelezi,
replacing them with national troops, and also held several personal meetings
with President Mandela.
For his part, Chief Buthelezi has consistently denied reports of a rift with
the king. However in the last two weeks he has lashed out at attempts to
'vilify' him by members of the royal family - an apparent reference to the
growing influence of Prince Mcwayizeni Zulu, a long-standing rival of Chief
Buthelezi's and a member of the ANC's national executive, in the Royal
Household.
The row over President Mandela's planned attendance at Shaka Day
celebrations this weekend, a ceremony central to the Zulu nationalist
tradition as a tribute to the kingdom's founder, appears to have brought
matters to a head.
Although President Mandela announced after meeting with Chief Buthelezi and
the king on Monday night that he had decided not to attend the ceremony, the
king appears to have chosen to use the issue as an excuse to break off ties
with Inkatha.
The roots of the conflict run back to King Goodwill's accession to the
throne in 1971. Before his coronation, the prince had sought to marginalise
Chief Buthelezi in Zulu politics. However after the coronation, the chief
used his newly-formed Inkatha movement to take control of the Zulu
'homeland', forcing the young monarch to follow his lead. The chief also
used his position as the king's uncle to claim the post of traditional prime
minister.
In the late 1970s Chief Buthelezi forced legislation through the KwaZulu
parliament that severely circumscribed the king's political independence and
since then has used his power over the KwaZulu budget, which provided the
monarch's salary, to insure that the king took no action contrary to
Inkatha's interests.
It is ironic that the King's new freedom to speak out against his former
mentor is in part the result of Chief Buthelezi's success in playing the
royal card during negotiations with the ANC earlier this year.
By making recognition of the monarch's status a condition of his
participation in the election, Chief Buthelezi was able to entrench the
position of the king as traditional ruler of KwaZulu in the new
constitution.
As a result, King Goodwill's status and salary are no longer dependent on
Inkatha and Chief Buthelezi has no direct authority over the king.
The king yesterday was reported to have cancelled the Shaka Day celebrations
this weekend. So far Inkatha officials are putting a brave face on the split
and insist that the celebrations will go ahead with or without the king's
participation.
However without the monarch's blessing, Inkatha will find it difficult to
generate the level of support the celebrations have traditionally enjoyed.
'It's a bit like celebrating Christmas without acknowledging the Christian
tradition,' said Mr David Welsh, political scientist at the University of
Cape Town.
