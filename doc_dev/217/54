FT  10 JUL 93 / Superstar route for royalty: John Lloyd has been ploughing
through the torrent of books on the British monarchy

OF THE books about the British monarchy published in the first half of this
year, the majority advertise in their titles that they are diagnoses of
sickness, even death.
Two proclaim the fall of the House of Windsor. One gets 'behind palace
doors.' Another borrows law court language - Diana v Charles - to emphasise
the hectic distaste which the Prince and Princess of Wales conceived for
each other. A fifth sees the crown as 'tarnished.' A sixth boldly
psychoanalyses the family. A seventh homes in upon the royal marriages with
the ruthless eye of the scandal-monger.
The books are themselves a pathology, for the four journalist-authors -
Nigel Dempster/Peter Evans, Anthony Holden and James Whitaker - were all
scribe-courtiers of, even fawners on, their subjects. Now they take the
insouciant high ground of the scornful know-all, seeing 'nothing but
lechery' wherever they look.
For the writer A N Wilson, the most disdainful of them, the behaviour of
Charles, above all, has been a betrayal of trust. Wilson is forced to
suggest an unlikely alienation of the monarchy from the Windsor family in
order to preserve it.
One of the two Ladies writing, Lady Colin Campbell, is a distant relation by
marriage to the British royal family and to 'most of the royal houses of
Europe,' and is bitchily revelatory, whisking aside bedroom curtains across
a continent and four generations.
The one academic, a former Labour politician turned radical, Stephen
Haseler, sees the pass to which sex has brought the monarchy as the starting
point for his vigorous, neo-conservative republicanism.
Other critical books have been published since the second world war - that
is, in the period when the royal family became the Holy Family (a myth
started not by the present Queen but by her mother, that hard nut with a
creamy, sweet coating). But Percy Black's Mystique of Modern Royalty and
Kingsley Martin's Crown and Establishment, for example, were chiding, not
radical.
In the late 1980s, two books were published which, although resigned to the
continuation of popular sycophancy, nevertheless began to strike chords. The
doughty republican Edgar Wilson's Myth of the British Monarchy appeared in
1989. More stylish was the Scots Marxist Tom Nairn's book, The Enchanted
Glass (1988). It was a meditation on royalty and its acceptance in British
public and fantasy life.
It was good stuff, but what else would you expect from a Scots Marxist? The
fact that it attracted attention was not due to left-wing agitation but to
something quite different: to the best impulses of Thatcherism - a
dispassionate and undeferential questioning of the way we organise
ourselves. This questioning left its mark everywhere, and has permitted some
curious alliances in the 1990s - as on royalty. Linked to this was the
growing lack of inhibition of the popular press.
Although they prepared the ground, the Thatcherites retreated from it
because deference was still too strong in their bones. The most radical of
them - Keith Joseph, Norman Tebbit, David Young and Margaret Thatcher
herself - all in the end were too bourgeois to press the logic they had
unleashed. They bowed the knee and took the peerage route into the
decompression chamber of British public life.
Behind them, however, they left a right-radical popular press, led by The
Sun, without the restraining influence of the leader herself. In the past
two years the press has launched attacks more forcefully and promiscuously
than ever before, reaching deep into previously taboo heartland. The medium
for this travel into the forbidden zone was sex. These books, with the
exception of that written by the Roundhead Haseler, are full of it.
This is natural enough. The British monarchy has much more of a duty to
reproduce than to rule. Alone among the state functionaries of Britain, the
monarch's sex life can be reasonably said to be of public interest.
The lamp of the media's attention has been hottest on Charles: he has
melted, though not completely. Most of the books, especially Holden's and
Wilson's, view the prince with real contempt, ridiculing his intellectual
pretensions, his vacillation over marriage and his finally surly resignation
in marrying.
Whitaker, with the wariness of a tabloid reporter who cannot afford to
offend a future king - although he, as the others, doubts that Charles will
now make it - is less censorious. He makes the even-handed, sad comment that
'put at its crudest it came to this: he needed someone to produce a future
king, she desperately wanted to be Princess of Wales.' On balance he prefers
the princess with whom, on his account, he has had a number of
heart-to-hearts, especially just before the wedding - conversations which
were clearly of great value (financially as well as emotionally) to him.
The male authors all agree that the princess was ready to love, but that she
ran up against Charles' desire to carry on with a routine of duty,
philosophising, polo, fishing and, ultimately, adultery.
In a soupy pre-marriage interview, both Charles and Diana were asked if they
were in love. She simpered assent. He gave his, then added: 'Whatever love
means.' Since that was not part of the wedding-of-the-epoch script, it was
made little of. However, today's republicans-come-lately see it as the
emotional viper in the bosom of the marriage.
Diana, already sanctified by Andrew Morton's Diana - a powerful and mythic
work - has a much better time of it from the authors. All note her dimness,
her ambition and, by far her most important characteristic, her
chameleon-like nature.
With tabloid economy, Whitaker puts it best: 'She had a knack for picking up
the gestures that define a personality.' Holden, quoting the US author
Camilla Paglia, says that Diana 'may have become the most powerful image in
the world today, a case study in the modern cult of celebrity and the way in
which it stimulates atavistic religious emotions.' And he lists the
stereotypes at which she now takes a turn: 'Cinderella, betrayed wife,
princess in the tower, mater dolorosa, pagan goddess, Hollywood queen and
beautiful boy.'
Lady Campbell is the notable dissenter from the general view that the
princess is the more sinned against. She has written a magnificent book
whose veracity it is completely impossible to determine, though her blood
ties to the royal families of Britain and Europe would in nobler times have
removed any doubt as to her word.
She is in every bed chamber, including that of the queen and the many
occupied by the Duke of Edinburgh. Of Charles, she believes that a man in
his position will, after the duty is done, take a mistress or mistresses.
Diana's inability to tolerate this appears to her 'irrational and childish.'
She presents the princess as a tantrum-prone bully without the intelligence
to grasp what was expected of her and the stakes for which she was gambling.
Of course, the famous 'Camillagate' (Prince Charles) and 'Squidgy' (Diana)
tapes are represented in both Dempster's and Whitaker's book. The tapes'
contents are well known. I found the Prince's conversation touching to the
point of feeling a stab of sympathy for him, and Diana's deportment while
she was being grossly flattered by James Gilbey unnervingly self-controlled
and narcissistic.
Can the greatest surviving monarchy on earth live through this? As rational
British citizens, we must hope not. But we must also - knowing the depth of
its cunning, the rotundity of its purse and the reserves of popularity it
still commands - fear that it can.
The answer to its survival lies with Diana. In her embrace of stardom and in
her ability to lend herself to a series of pre-determined images  -
especially of the 'caring' sort now so much in vogue - she has mapped out a
route that her sister-in-law, Princess Anne, has already discovered in a
lower-key way.
The British royal family can survive as charity superstars. They must be
ruthless with their ceremonial, trimming it to what is amusing and splendid
on occasion. They must open up not just Buckingham Palace but all the
palaces, including the so-called 'private possessions' like Balmoral and
Sandringham - in reality, as Holden writes, the product of Queen Victoria's
adroit begging for public finance. And they must open all the art and other
collections.
They must create, probably outside London, the largest and best designed
royal museum-cum-funpark in the world - a royal Disneyland. They must accept
that clever accountancy is not the option for them that it is for most of
the rich. They must eschew the marginal controversies which they have
stirred up in the past in favour of being deeply, broadly, constantly
caring.
It will be pretty sickly, but it might keep the show on the road, sparing us
the horror of having to vote for a head of state like lesser races do.
