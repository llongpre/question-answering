  [Text] Durban Feb 14 SAPA -- State President F W de Klerk 
says he does not regard Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's 
declaration of a sovereign Zulu kingdom as secession, and says 
the Zulu monarch's demands are negotiable. Mr de Klerk said the 
government would officially respond to the Zulu monarch's claims 
on Thursday [17 February]. 
  In a joint statement by Mr de Klerk and the king after three 
hours of talks in Durban on Monday, the state president said 
"the new position" of the king and the kwaZulu government could 
be fully accommodated within the interim constitution, and 
possible amendments to it. He was referring to a strongly 
worded memorandum by King Zwelithini on Monday in which he 
declared Natal/kwaZulu an independent sovereign kingdom. 
  The joint statement after Monday's talks said the king and 
his traditional prime minister, Inkatha Freedom Party leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, disagreed that the interim constitution 
accommodated the Zulu nation. They insisted on a distinct 
dispensation for the Zulu kingdom, the statement said. Mr de 
Klerk undertook to examine the king's demands and respond fully 
on Thursday. 
  Clear differences between the respective delegations over 
the 
Zulu monarch's demands were visible at their post meeting media 
conference in the Durban City Hall. 
  King Zwelithini also dismissed a question that he was 
seceding, saying he was claiming what rightfully belonged to the 
Zulu nation. "I am asking for something that belongs to me and 
my people -- no one else," the king said. 
  Asked whether he should not be discussing the future of the 
Zulu kingdom with the African National Congress, the king said 
tersely: "I am speaking to the head of state". 
  Mr de Klerk said he did not regard the king's claims as 
secession, saying room could be created for "specific needs". 
He added that under a federal system of government the needs of 
South Africa's diverse population could be accommodated. Mr 
Buthelezi said later he disagreed with Mr de Klerk, adding that 
there was nothing "federalistic about this constitution". 
  Expanding on his king's demands, Mr Buthelezi said a Zulu 
nation was an historical reality and "we have an identifiable 
territory with the [word indistinct]". 
  Mr de Klerk maintained that negotiations were the only way 
to 
achieve an acceptable solution, saying there was a commitment 
from both sides "otherwise we wouldn't be here".
