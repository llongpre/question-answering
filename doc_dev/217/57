FT  28 NOV 92 / Woman in the News: Exception to the rule - The Queen

Monarchy becomes Elizabeth Windsor. She does the job well. She has outgrown
the natural disadvantages of one who never went to school, never learned to
mix as an equal with others of her own age, and, initially at least, had
little more than formal contact with persons outside the narrow penumbra
that surrounds the royal family.
Five years into her reign, when she was still an apprentice, her speeches
were described by the erstwhile Lord Altrincham (now John Grigg) as prim
little sermons; her style of speaking, he wrote in 1957, was a 'pain in the
neck'. The words that were being put into her mouth were appropriate to 'a
priggish schoolgirl, captain of the hockey team, a prefect, and a recent
candidate for confirmation.'
Mr Grigg's comments caused a furore at the time. An elderly crank hit him.
An Italian monarchist challenged him to a duel. Today that long-forgotten
text should serve the Queen well. The contrast between then and now is to
her advantage. She was a nervous young woman. Her voice and manner were
stilted. Her public demeanour was heavy with responsibility. But 35 years
later she is a mature sovereign, a mother who has suffered as would any
other from the sight of the marital difficulties afflicting her children, a
matron with a long memory and a definite sense of humour.
Her 40 years' experience of public life prepared her for the moment when she
was obliged to come clean, which she did in her celebrated 'annus
horribilis' speech on Tuesday. Yes, she intimated, she did hate it when her
family was pilloried by the media. True, she hinted, it was indeed
unpleasant to be attacked for not paying taxes, or for being so wealthy that
she should have contributed to the cost of rebuilding the burned-out segment
of Windsor Castle.
She was appealing for sympathy but her heartfelt remarks, delivered in the
husky tones brought on by a cold, did not reduce the tabloids to quivering
respect. Those years are gone. Do not blame the messengers: they largely
reflect the sentiments of their readers. In 1952 the young Elizabeth
inherited not only the throne but also the affection in which the nation had
held her father. During the war, class distinctions were forgotten. By his
sharing of their experiences King George VI had won the undiluted allegiance
of the British people. Unexpectedly, he died aged 56. The then Princess
Elizabeth was 26. Not yet ready for coronation, she became Queen-Empress;
her reach stretched around the globe.
Today the Commonwealth means more to its titular head than it does to most
of her subjects. In Britain the monarchy is fondly regarded as a mildly
decaying domestic institution. As such, it is the subject of cartoons, TV
lampoons, commonplace jesting, and, on occasion, the nastier manifestations
of envy. How it is viewed by people in the former colonies, some of which
have discarded it, is a matter of little concern back home. Among the
generality of the Queen's British subjects deference is an outdated notion,
although there is still a tendency to fawn when politicians, or
business-folk, or other distinguished persons are invited to the palace.
Those who seek honour, or recognition, are positively enthralled by contact
with any royal.
The Queen is accustomed to obsequiousness. It is, to her, a natural part of
her life. Yet she shows every sign of enjoying her job, which she takes
seriously. She is proud of remembering many of the names, and recognising
many of the faces, of those of her guests she greets personally. She likes
being flattered, and bowed and curtsied to, and treated as the pivot of the
constitution by a succession of prime ministers, some of whom have sought to
out-Disraeli Disraeli, the Victorian prime minister who wooed his Queen. She
has a strong sense of royal vocation. When there is a matter of state the TV
cameras confirm that her dignity and composure are exemplary.
Her highest duty, as she sees it, is to preserve the monarchy. She had
previously taken advice on how to maintain the affection of the people; this
led to two intimate TV portraits of her family of which the later, a
close-up of the Queen herself, was surely the more appealing. She came
across as a race-horse owner, a countrywoman, a professional monarch with a
twinkle in her eye. But in mid-slump, and with tabloid scandals appearing
every day, that was not good enough. There is no widespread demand for a
republic, but the feeling that people want a less extravagant, less
patronising, less privileged monarchy is palpable. The almost universal
reaction to the Windsor Castle fire last weekend convinced both the
government and the palace that slowly-gestating plans for the Queen to
subject herself to taxation had to be brought forward immediately. She was
ready to be so persuaded by Mr John Major.
The torrent of criticism should now abate, at least for a while. The history
of the monarchy is one of survival by adapting to the pressures of the time.
The events of this week - the Royal cry for help and the Royal decision on
taxation - are fully consonant with that history. Yet the adaptations the
Queen has been obliged to make since 1952 have all served to diminish the
importance, if not the stature, of the institution she personifies. As the
significance of the Commonwealth has shrunk, so has that of the Crown. As
Britain has moved to middle-ranking status, so has its head of state. As the
costs of maintaining a rumbustious extended family have risen, so the esteem
in which the enterprise has been held has dwindled.
During the fifth decade of her reign there may be further changes. The
European Community accommodates monarchies, but the complexities of
membership put into question Britain's highly centralised, unwritten
constitution. Celtic demands for self government may again become vocal. The
Conservatives seem set to hold office indefinitely; single-party government,
exercised in the name of the Crown, cannot be good for democracy. While
Queen Elizabeth is on her throne she will continue to be the British
constitution made flesh. Her successor may be a mere boy on a bicycle.
