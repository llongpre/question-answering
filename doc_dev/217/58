   The chants of Eastern Europe's
pro-democracy protesters as they ousted former Communist overlords
have been sweet music to members of long-deposed royal families.
   The revolutionary changes of the past year have buoyed their
hopes, nurtured during decades in exile, to reclaim their national
stature and perhaps even return to the throne.
   Stifled under decades of Communist rule, their aspirations have
now even gained some support at home. When a crowd spotted Otto von
Hapsburg on a street in Budapest, Hungary, in April, it chanted
``Long Live the King!''
   Romania's King Michael I waits for his people's call, and
Albania's King Leka I would like to come home from South Africa.
   Indeed, von Hapsburg and King Michael appear to have a chance at
public office _ if only honorary _ in their homelands.
   The prospect of restoring royalty, of course, is unthinkable to
many citizens of Eastern Europe. Monarchists seem to be in the
minority.
   Hungary plans to establish a multi-party democracy this year,
and Romania has tentative plans to follow suit.
   In Romania, even the word ``dynasty'' smacks of repression,
reminding most people of the clan of executed dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu. He ruled like an absolute monarch, installing family
members in key positions.
   Bernd Posselt, von Hapsburg's spokesman, seemed to agree with
public speculation that his boss might stand a chance to become
Hungary's state president this year.
   He said ``all options are being kept open, and the matter is
again under review.''
   The aide spoke to The Associated Press in a recent telephone
interview from Strasbourg, France. Hapsburg, the eldest son of King
Karl VI of Hungary _ also Emperor Karl I of Austria _ is now a
Bavarian deputy in the European Parliament.
   After the collapse of the Austrian Empire, the Hapsburg family
had to leave Austria and settled in Switzerland. Two attempts by
Otto's father to restore the kingdom in Hungary in 1919 and 1920
failed.
   During his first official visit to Hungary in February, von
Hapsburg, who is fluent in Hungarian, received a hero's welcome.
   During the April visit, thousands of Hungarians cheered him
again to chants of ``Long Live The King!'' as Otto and members of
his family emerged from a church following a requiem for his mother
Zita, the last queen of Hungary, who died in March at age 96.
   In Romania, the return of 67-year-old King Michael is seen by
some Romanians as a guarantee that the Communist Party will never
again come to power.
   On Dec. 22, the day Ceausescu was overthrown, the exiled king
said he was ready to return to his country as head of a
constitutional monarchy.
   ``I have been waiting for this for 40 years,'' he told a hastily
convened news conference in Geneva, near his home in exile. ``If
people want me to come back, of course, I will come back.''
   Michael was forced to abdicate in December 1947 amid the
prospect of civil war and pressure from the Kremlin and its
Romanian Communist allies.
   Two of King Michael's exiled daughters, Sophie and Margarita,
were privately visiting Romania on Sunday.
   Margarita was asked at a news conference whether she was
surprised by being met at the airport Thursday by a group of
Romanians shouting ``Long Live The King!''
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' she said. ``We were Romanians
coming home _ that's the one thing that struck me.''
   She stressed, however, that she and her sister ``have not come
here in any bid to restore the monarchy _ I want that to be
absolutely clear.''
   ``My father has waited for 42 years to come back to his country
as a Romanian, but as to when or how _ I don't think I can answer
right now,'' she said.
   King Simeon II of Bulgaria, where the monarchy was abolished in
1946, said Wednesday he believes his return to his homeland would
be premature.
   ``I'm no one to dictate or to impose conditions .... It's not up
to me .... Anyway, it's too early for this question.,'' he said.
   ``And in another way I would at this point be much more useful
abroad with my contacts and connections,'' the 52-year-old ex-king
told the AP from his home in Madrid.
   By contrast, the Albanian would-be king is eagerly waiting for
his hour of triumph at his home in a suburb of Johannesburg.
   King Leka, an exile for all his 50 years, believes political
upheaval in the Soviet bloc will ignite an uprising among the
people of Albania, the last hard-line Communist state in the region.
   Reports in Yugoslav and Greek news media about recent unrest and
casualties in Shkodra and other Albanian cities have been denied by
Albanian officials.
   If a revolution comes, Leka says, he would be proud to follow
the footsteps of his father, King Zog I.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, the
British bible of Europe's bluest blood, said last week that ``this
upheaval in Eastern Europe is the last chance, in my opinion, that
these contenders have to re-establish their thrones.''
   ``The fact that King Michael and Otto von Hapsburg are immensely
popular with political groups pushing for their restoration has
moved this from fairy-tale stage to world stage,'' he told the AP
in London.
   Grand Duke Vladimir, 72-year-old head of the Imperial House of
Romanov and heir to the Russian throne, has even urged restoration
of the Russian monarchy.
   On Friday, at a ball the Russian royal family held in London to
raise funds for the Russian Orthodox Church there, Vladimir told a
reporter: ``Russian people would think quite seriously about a
monarchial form of government. A monarchy would be something for
them to rally round.''
   During the ball, the Imperial Russian anthem ``God Preserve the
Czar'' was played _ over and over.
