THE ARTICLE headlined 'The tourist in her own country,' by David Cannadine,
which appeared on the front page of the Weekend FT on February 8, provoked a
strong reaction from our readers. The debate continues here with a selection
of letters from those who disagreed with his views on the Queen and the
monarchy.
Several readers questioned his credentials for writing the article.
Cannadine, who is professor of history at Columbia University, New York, is
in fact an Englishman. He is author of The Decline and Fall of the British
Aristocracy and is writing a book on the constitutional monarchy.

From Mr SL Mayer
Sir, David Cannadine has been living in the US too long. Never since the
latter days of Victoria has a monarch been so popular as the present one.
While it is perfectly true that her extended family may get up to occasional
tricks which neither her people nor Her Majesty approve, it is also fair to
say that members of the Royal family have had a bad press in the past and
now have a very good one, and rightly so, because of continued dedication,
hard work and service to their country such as that given by the Princess
Royal.
During World War II, Stalin enquired how many divisions the Pope had. Less
than 50 years later, the state over which Stalin ruled has disappeared. But
the papacy lives on, having played a rather important moral and ethical role
in the Soviet Union's and the eastern bloc's demise.
The Queen and the institution of the monarchy have this role in the
English-language world; one of moral suasion and example shown by Her
Majesty as well as many of her family, of devotion to duty, dedication to
human and British values in a world which is not necessarily dedicated to
any values at all.
Since these values are shared by the entire Anglophone world, and admired by
many who are not part of it, the Queen, as head of the Commonwealth, is the
living symbol of all that is good which has gone before and which endures
still; among these values are freedom of speech and press, freedom of
assembly, freedom of thought, democratic institutions and human values based
on Christian ideals.
These thoughts are universal and transcend both place and time. The Queen
and the monarchy represent them all. In an ever-changing world, the people
of the world and the people of Britain revere both those ideals and the
sovereign lady who best and most loyally represents them.
This does not mean that the institution of monarchy cannot or should not
change. It may well be that the taxation issue will be altered, as it was in
1936; that the Royal family, now more extended than ever, may be pared down
from public subsidy. But the Queen is probably the best-informed person in
the kingdom and is certainly the longest high-ranking public servant, having
now spent 40 years in the highest office. Far from being out of touch with
her people, she is in constant touch with them and the peoples of the
Commonwealth.
Britain has an influence in the world, even today, which far exceeds its
industrial power or population figures. It has this influence largely
because of its monarchy and its Queen. I would imagine that 50 years from
now, when the armies of Nato are confined to history as much as the power of
the Warsaw Pact is now, and when other empires and great powers have waxed
and waned, the institution of the British monarchy will remain, exercising
its considerable moral influence over both Britain and the English-speaking
peoples.

From Mr AC Teljer
Sir, The article by David Cannadine examining the Queen's role might be
fashionable in certain circles and possibly well-intended as an appraisal.
It is, nevertheless, to a large extent misguided.
If the 'old,' out-of-date imperial monarchy flourished from the time of
Victoria's Golden Jubilee until the present Queen's accession, what of the
profoundly majestic and noble kinship shown by the Queen's late father
during the Second World War, and her parents' obvious involvement in their
nation's sufferings? Kindred spirits, indeed - not lofty imperialists]
The simple point Mr Cannadine has missed and failed to acknowledge is that
the monarch, preferably a compassionate and indulgent one - which the Queen
certainly is, however outmodish or 'limited in her social vision' he deems
her - is there not only to reflect a nation's principles and role in the
world, and to be involved in active and creative patronage.
She is also to be uniquely there in showing her subjects, whether they be
naturally British or of other races from other shores, that nearness of the
state is available to all in her presence; not as a tourist in her own
country (a ridiculous notion), but as an official of destiny within a
dynasty undiluted by common dimensions by co-operating for the nation's
good. Perhaps patriarchy or matriarchy in itself may prove outmoded, or even
undesirable in modern technological society - reverence of one kind or
another never will.
Professor Cannadine may dislike the monarchy, or royalty in general. I
believe he will always be in a small minority and that this particular band
of blue bloods will always be indispensable to certain societies for a very
long time into the next millennium. He asks: 'What is to be put in its
place?' I say, nothing. Better the 'sycophantic mythology of imperial
ornamentality' than the shallow conventionality of republican vapidity.

From Mr Charles Spink
Sir, Who is David Cannadine that you should not only give him the front page
of the Weekend FT, but support him with such insulting caricatures? It is
typical of the British press that probably no other country would print such
disparaging rubbish about the monarchy and the British people.

From Mrs A. Robeison
Sir, 'The tourist in her own country' was in appallingly poor taste. The
aspersions the author casts on the Queen's personality and achievements are
inaccurate, unwarranted and especially disgraceful.

From Sir John Stokes MP
Sir, I am sure I am not alone among your readers in not taking too kindly to
a lecture from a professor in an American university about the British
monarchy.
There are so many misconceptions in the professor's article which show that
he completely misunderstands how ordinary English people feel about the
monarchy. He patronises the Queen for her undoubted virtues, but then says
she 'is conservative enough to regard most change for the worst,' thus
sharing the views of at least half her subjects. Does the Professor think
that a Queen full of radical views would be more appropriate?
I dispute the professor's contention that our national identity has been
weakened. It may have been so among the intelligentsia with whom probably he
mixes, but not among people in pubs, factories etc, where patriotism still
lies deep. Would a nation which is losing its way have undertaken and won
the Falklands War with all the great risks involved? Or sent such
incomparable forces to the Gulf War which earned the unstinted admiration
from our American allies there?
As for 'the old ways of doing things - ceremonial grandeur' - ordinary
people love it. The ceremonies emphasise our long history and cohesion as a
nation. Many continental countries would love to have a history such as ours
and I am quite sure the British people will never agree to the bureaucrats
of Brussels destroying our monarchy.
The professor says that the British monarchy has lost its way, but I fear it
is the professor himself who has lost his way.

Sir, How nice it would be if the Queen were to grant an audience to
Professor Cannadine. I'm sure that he would pretty soon find that, like Mr
Heath, he was 'expendable'.
