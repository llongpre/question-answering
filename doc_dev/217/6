come to resemble a politician running for office, argues Andrew Adonis

Prince Charles is running for office as surely as any politician fighting an
election campaign. That is the inescapable conclusion to be drawn from his
actions in 1994 - yet another turbulent year for Britain's royal family.
The British public and media have been slow to recognise Charles Windsor,
embattled candidate for the throne of the United Kingdom and a collection of
other realms and territories including Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Understandably, they have assumed that Charles will ascend the throne as a
matter of course, unless he chooses to relinquish his birthright in favour
of his eldest son, William - a theme of intermittent tabloid speculation but
little more.
It is now clear that Charles does not see things so simply. His motives for
embarking on a campaign for office can only be speculated upon: insecurity
about his public standing, fear for the long-term damage done by his
separation from Diana, and concern about the steadily declining reputation
of the royal family are the obvious factors.
Whatever the prince's precise motives, the evidence of a
carefully-orchestrated campaign is unambiguous.
The planning stage appears to have been the months immediately preceding the
separation in December 1992. In the summer of 1992 the prince agreed to
allow Mr Jonathan Dimbleby, a senior BBC journalist with impeccable
Establishment credentials, to write an authorised biography.
The arrangement was astonishing for a public figure in mid-career. The
prince gave Mr Dimbleby lengthy, intimate interviews, had him 'shadow' his
private and social engagements, and arranged for friends and some relatives
to be interviewed discreetly. Mr Dimbleby was given unprecedented access to
the prince's private and official papers, including ministerial
correspondence. There was a formal agreement to allow the prince to read the
manuscript and comment on 'inaccuracies'.
The prince's agreement with Mr Dimbleby amounted, in effect, to the
preparation of a manifesto for office. Far from disguising the fact the
author parades it.
In the preface to The Prince of Wales, published last month, he stresses his
growing intimacy with Charles and his efforts to 'accommodate' the prince's
sensitivities. 'I have learnt too much about my subject to be either
indifferent or dispassionate,' he writes, adding the hope that readers 'will
emerge at the other end feeling that they have come to know the heir to the
throne as they never could before - and that he is well worth knowing.'
Like an election manifesto, the book is partly a defence of the prince's
record to date and partly a prospectus for office. The 'defence' recites the
prince's public works, and offers apologias for his shortcomings in which
everything from bullying at school to unsatisfactory relationships with his
father and Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher are prayed in aid. The
prospectus includes a plea for the maintenance of the royal yacht and a
proposal to broaden his future spiritual role beyond the Church of England
(as 'Defender of Faith').
The book has gone hand in hand with a media offensive. In October of last
year, St James's Palace told the FT that the prince was available to be
'shadowed' on a week-long trip to the Middle East. The prince regards the
promotion of British business as an important part of his role, and the FT
was the ideal outlet for his views on the subject. It led to a full-length
profile - which dominated the media - entitled: 'A prince captured: The heir
to the British throne believes he could be used more effectively in
promoting UK plc.'
The FT article was a prelude to the main event: a three-hour television
documentary in June presented by Mr Dimbleby. In campaign terms, this was
equivalent to the party political broadcast, although unusual in attracting
13m viewers. The manifesto was broadcast to the backdrop of appropriate
action shots; and the prince, no doubt advised that it is now fashionable
for candidates to come clean about peccadillos, adopted a suitably pained
expression to confess adultery.
As the first year of the campaign draws to a close, it is time to take
stock. Is the prince a novel royal entrepreneur? And novel or not, is he
wise to be alarmed about his succession prospects?
There is nothing novel in the prince's endeavours. Every century or so since
the Norman Conquest serious efforts have been made to repackage the
monarchy. Some, such as Elizabeth I's bid to become 'Faerie Queene', were
resoundingly successful; others, notably attempts by Edward II, Richard II,
James II, and Charles I to seize power from established elites, were less
so.
The most successful of recent royal redesigns was the creation of the
modern, constitutional and ceremonial monarchy under Queen Victoria in the
mid-19th century. Dubbed by historians the 'invention of tradition', it was
a brilliant ploy to renovate medieval royal pageantry and represent what
were previously the symbols of office as its substance. Disraeli's
proclamation of Victoria as 'Empress of India' was the final triumph,
presenting the monarchy as the emblem of imperial unity.
The monarchy has remained largely stuck in this Victorian groove. Some
changes have been necessary: the Empress of India has become head of the
Commonwealth. But the hallmark of the current reign has been the dedication
of the Queen and her advisers to the Victorian legacy. Indeed, Elizabeth II
does it better than Victoria herself: the aged widow performed few public
duties, rarely even opening parliament in person.
No one with historical sense can doubt that the monarchy will need to be
'reinvented' in the next reign if it is to survive. But, in considering
whether the prince is right to be alarmed, the peculiar feature of his
manifesto is its failure to address two of the institution's greatest
weaknesses: its lack of a European role, and social changes that are making
the public ever less enamoured of royal flummery.
While the monarchy had excellent European credentials until the early part
of this century, with Victoria related to all the Continent's leading
rulers, today's monarchy has barely any European dimension.
The threat to the monarchy is insidious, not immediate. It comes from the
increasing irrelevance of its role, and from steadily eroding popular
respect and support. Should the erosion continue, politicians are bound to
start dabbling in republicanism. A tell-tale sign was the call earlier this
month by Mr Jack Straw, Labour's new home affairs spokesman, for a smaller,
Scandinavian-style, monarchy.
More ominous, perhaps, is the growing republican tide in the former
dominions. Australia looks increasingly set to hold a referendum on the
future of the monarchy at the end of the Queen's reign or perhaps sooner.
New Zealand may follow suit, to judge by the surprise declaration by its
prime minister last March in favour of such a move.
Such referendums are bound to attract notice and stir a debate in the UK. It
is not inconceivable that they would prompt calls for a vote at home too.
Another straw in the wind is the growing political popularity of referendums
on important constitutional issues. If such a vote is held on a single
European currency, for example, the chances of a referendum on the future of
the monarchy could be increased dramatically.
Even if all this were to come to pass, the prospect of the prince losing his
election must be small. However unpopular the royals, the difficulty of
devising arrangements for an alternative head of state, which is currently
dogging Australia's republicans, would powerfully reinforce the status quo.
Yet Candidate Charles might care to ponder the proverb that, in politics,
the expected never happens.
