   It is still a crime to insult the
royal family in the Netherlands, as a 24-year-old Dutchman recently
learned when he was fined 500 guilders ($230) for displaying a
poster depicting Queen Beatrix as a pig.
   Most Dutch frown on insults to the House of Orange, whose fate
and fortunes have been entwined with the Low Countries for 400
years.
   Periodic polls indicate the public overwhelmingly favors
retaining its constitutional monarchy.
   ``The Orange family belongs to the antique furniture that we've
inherited, and it would be unwise to do away with it _ they might
be very valuable,'' said historian Coenraad Tamse of Groningen
University. ``They offer a simple icon of the continuity of Dutch
nationa identity.''
   Since 1898, the Dutch have been led by three queens _ the dour
Wilhelmina, a symbol of hope during the five-year Nazi occupation;
the motherly Juliana, and now the practical Beatrix, who has a
strong sense of her role in Dutch life.
   ``Beatrix has a very strong notion of historic continuity, even
though nothing could be further apart than the role of 16th-century
William and hers,'' said royalty writer Fred Lammers, referring to
Prince William of Orange, who led the Dutch fight for independence
from Spain in the 16th century.
   Although the 51-year-old Beatrix is far from a figurehead, her
official statements are closely tailored to fit the policy of the
elected government.
   An attractive woman with the characteristic ruddy cheeks of her
countrymen, Beatrix is unpretentious in public and dresses like a
prosperous middle-class matron.
   She and her husband, Claus, a former West German diplomat, mix
easily with the public and eschew extravagance.
   But Beatrix reportedly is concerned with maintaining respect for
the monarchy and insists on being called ``Majesty,'' rather than
``Ma'am,'' which her mother Juliana preferred.
   Over the centuries, the House of Orange has survived financial
and romantic scandal, as well as occupation by Napoleon's forces in
1795-1812 and by Hitler's in 1940-45. Both times its members fled
to England.
   Its current hallowed image dates from Wilhelmina, Beatrix's
grandmother, who was ``groomed to fit the mold formed by the
supposed Dutch national traits: virtuousness, diligence, charity,
religiosity, and aversion to violence,'' Professor Tamse said.
   Wilhelmina's bond with her people was irrevocably forged by her
frequent morale-boosting radio speeches from London during World
War II.
   Periodic scandals have failed to tarnish the Orange image.
   During the 1950s there was Queen Juliana's reported dependence
on a faith healer, which the media attributed to her depression
over the near-blindness of her daughter, Princess Christina, born
in 1947.
   In 1964, daughter Princess Irene enraged hard-line Protestant
factions by rejecting the royal family's Dutch Reformed Protestant
faith for Roman Catholicism to marry Prince Carlos Hugo de
Bourbon-Parma, a pretender to the Spanish throne.
   Juliana's husband, Prince Bernhard, was Dutch industry's
unofficial ambassador until his implication in the Lockheed bribery
scandal in 1975.
   He was stripped of his rank as inspector-general of the Dutch
armed forces but is still highly popular and active in conservation
issues.
   Even the royal family's wealth _ reported to range from $80
million to $4.4 billion _ has failed to incite popular resentment.
   Beatrix and her family live in Huis ten Bosch (House in the
Woods), an estate in The Hague visible from the public highway.
Except for state occasions, Beatrix is driven around in a Ford.
   Their three sons study in the state-run university system and
room with friends.
   The heaviest public insult to the monarchy came in 1980, when
Juliana abdicated in favor of Beatrix. During the inauguration _
Dutch monarchs are not crowned _ stone-throwing squatters rioted
outside.
   ``In hindsight, the inauguration riots had less to do with the
monarchy than with anything else _ the housing situation,
unemployment, and the like,'' writer Lammers said. ``But as
national symbols, the royals bore the brunt of the unrest.''
   Despite her circumscribed role, Beatrix's interest in government
is keen, according to sources close to the royal family.
   She meets every Monday morning with Premier Ruud Lubbers and has
at least one extensive policy discussion a week with other Cabinet
ministers.
   The royals draw a line at exploitation of their private life by
the popular press.
   Four years ago, Claus obtained a court-ordered retraction from a
Dutch magazine for an unsubstantiated story alleging that their
eldest son, Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, spent the night with a
``mysterious blonde'' in an Amsterdam hotel.
