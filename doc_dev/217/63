  [Text] The Zulu monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini, said he 
will not enter into any agreements with the ANC which he had not 
been party to in drawing up. King Goodwill, in an interview 
with the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation], 
responded to a draft proposal which the ANC presented to him 
during Friday's [8 April] leaders' summit in the Kruger Game 
Park. According to the agreement, the ANC has undertaken to see 
to it that the king's position, rights, and powers will be 
constitutionally recognized and defined. 
  [Begin Zwelithini recording, in English] I want to put it 
clearly to my people that I was not intent to sign any agreement 
which was not drawn by all political concerns [as heard]. I was 
thinking that everything is going to be supported out, 
especially for the sovereign kingdom, with the Zulu monarchy. 
But I was surprised to see that the ANC's agreement proposals 
were just concerning the status of the king and the royal house. 
All what I need is to see that the sovereign kingdom and the 
Zulu monarchy and the self-determination of the Zulu people 
being looked at before elections. [end recording]
