SOME people are indifferent to the British monarchy; a minority is opposed
to it. What cannot be denied, however, is that it runs through the whole
fabric of British life.
Last year alone the royal family undertook 3,270 official engagements in the
UK - 10 per cent up on 1990. Some of those may be considered largely social,
but they extend across the whole range of charities, health and education.
They also include business. There can scarcely be a businessman in the land
who would not welcome a new plant being opened by a royal - and the more
senior the better. Equally, there are few people in British life who turn
down honours, or even invitations to garden parties.
The definition of the sovereign's role has long been accepted as 'to advise,
to encourage and to warn'. It is not indispensable. Yet if the monarchy were
under challenge, it is unlikely that other institutions would survive closer
scrutiny: the House of Lords, for example, and a whole edifice of patronage
and deference.
The monarchy has been unpopular or the subject of great controversy or both
before and survived. Queen Victoria in mid-reign seemed alienated from her
subjects, but she won back affection in her old age.
Nothing that has happened in the royal entourage in the past few years is
remotely on a scale of the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936. Mr John Major,
the prime minister, has been closely involved in the final stages of this
particular drama but, during the abdication crisis, whole prime ministerial
meetings were taken up with the matter for nearly a year. The difference
then was that the affair was not discussed in the British press.
Without the press, it is arguable that everything would be much smoother
today. Yet it is wishful thinking to believe that the press will draw back.
Moreover, royal watchers argue that they are merely reflecting a popular
mood. When the Prince of Wales married Lady Diana in July 1981, the nation
cheered. It was only 18 months later, however, that gossip columnists began
to report that not all was well.
Initial press comment tended to concentrate on the younger members of the
family, yet gradually the pack began to close in on anyone who could be
exposed. Public opinion began to change. A Mori poll in May 1984 suggested
that only 5 per cent of those polled thought the country would be better off
without a monarchy, while 16 per cent thought that abolition would make no
difference. In May 1992 the percentage of those believing that the country
would be better off had risen to 14. More significantly, as many as 32 per
cent thought that abolition would make no difference. Only 50 per cent
thought that the country would be worse off.
An NOP poll early this year found that 84 per cent of respondents believed
the Queen should pay income tax on her private income. A few months later
the Queen volunteered to do just that, and the formal decision was announced
by Mr Major last month.
The Queen herself can be confident about her future. In the late 1980s there
was much talk about a possible abdication to make way for Prince Charles.
The Queen firmly stamped on that in a Christmas broadcast and recent polls
show that the number who believe that she should stay as long as possible
has risen. The Mori poll in May this year found that 85 per cent think there
will still be a monarchy in 10 years' time, though only 46 per cent in 50
years' time.
Nevertheless, the Queen and Queen Mother, who is literally as old as this
century, have shielded the younger royals and the monarchy itself with their
huge popularity. Yesterday's announcement has dented that shield and will
expose Britain's most famous institution to more, not less, scrutiny.
