third force in politics is fighting

It is the issue on everyone's mind. Most would prefer not to talk about it.
Unsurprisingly, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, was nowhere to be seen as
the Liberal Democrats gathered in Brighton yesterday at the start of the
autumn political season. His shadow was everywhere.
The Labour party's decision to elect as its leader an aggressive and
attractive young moderniser has shifted irrevocably the political ground on
which the Liberal Democrats must fight the next election.
The already threadbare pretence that the third force in British politics
could remain neutral between the Conservatives and Labour has been torn
open. The doctrine of 'equidistance', so cherished by Dr David Owen in the
1980s, when as leader of the now-defunct SDP he flirted with the
Conservatives, no longer has even the pretence of credibility.
Mr Paddy Ashdown's party does have other things to discuss in Brighton. In
other circumstances it would feel entitled to some modest
self-congratulation. It is only five years since the party almost destroyed
itself during the break-up of the old Liberal-SDP Alliance. But it is still
here, and as strong now as it has ever been in post-war politics.
As Mr Ashdown never ceases to remind us, the Liberal Democrats hold a record
4,600 council seats as well as their 23 places at Westminster. After the
heady by-election successes of Newbury, Christchurch and Eastleigh the
European election result in June came as a disappointment. But the party's
two seats in the Strasbourg assembly provide its first representation in
Europe.
More importantly the party, always relatively strong in Scotland, has broken
out of its other bastion in Devon and Cornwall to establish a wider
political base in south-west England. That means it has become more
efficient in turning votes into seats.
The electoral successes have been accompanied by a more mature approach to
policymaking. Compared with their two larger opponents the Liberal Democrats
still occasionally come up with pretty eclectic policies. Activists reserve
the right to debate at length the sort of issues which ensure that the party
is regularly panned in the tabloid press.
The conference will argue whether the monarchy should be scrapped and
whether young girls should have access to contraceptives. Mr Ashdown will
find it hard to win time on television news bulletins for more important
debates on the economy, the constitution and the environment.
In spite of eccentricities Mr Ashdown has shifted the Liberal Democrats'
political centre of gravity.
It is true that some of the specific ideas - a massive shift away from value
added tax to a raft of new pollution levies, hypothecation of income taxes,
curfews for young criminals and local referendums on planning decisions -
frequently owe more to a craving for distinctiveness than to careful
analysis. But taken together the burst of policymaking since the 1992
general election has positioned the party on the hard centre-left.
By and large it has come to terms with an enterprise-based economy, the need
for flexible markets and the need for reform of public services. Mr Ashdown
hopes that this week it will shy away from joining Labour in backing a
national minimum wage and will cut its proposed top rate of income tax to 50
per cent.
More broadly, ideas for constitutional reform now stretch well beyond the
self-serving demand for proportional representation. The party is beginning
to acknowledge that European integration will not solve all of Britain's
problems. And there are signs that the hard-headed realities of Westminster
are starting to be understood by the party's local activists.
So it is understandable that Mr Ashdown should want to spend this week
reinforcing the notion that his party has at last established a mature,
distinctive identity.
Third-party politics cannot, however, operate in a vacuum. The chorus of
acknowledgements from senior party figures yesterday that the Liberal
Democrats could not respond to an inconclusive general election by
sustaining the Conservatives in office was in one sense stating the obvious.
There has never been much logic to the notion that because the party is
frequently a natural home for disgruntled Tory voters it must keep open the
option of support for a Conservative administration.
The Liberal Democrats are committed to pluralist government and
constitutional reform. They cannot sustain in office a party that by the
time of the next election will have governed Britain for 18 years.
Admitting the obvious is one thing. Defining the possible extent of any
collaboration with a Labour administration is altogether different.
There are too many imponderables. The success of Mr Blair's project to turn
Labour into a modern social democratic party is one. The outcome of the
general election is another.
Neither Liberal Democrats nor Labour can envisage pre-election pacts. If Mr
Blair were to win an overall majority at Westminster his present inclination
for co-operative rather than confrontational politics between the two
parties may change.
Mr Ashdown is right to say that the only option facing his party is to
compete on independent ground before the next election. But he will not be
able to hide the fact that there is only one route for the Liberal Democrats
into government - behind Mr Blair.
