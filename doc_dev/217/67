As the doors of Buckingham Palace open to the general public for the first
time, it is a good moment to look at the architectural quality of London's
royal quarter. Visitors who stand in the inevitable queue for their
admission tickets in The Mall will find themselves on the very spot which
was, until the early years of this century, the centre of an architectural
debate about the appropriate metropolitan setting for the British monarchy.
Looking westwards down The Mall today towards the familiar balcony front of
the palace what we see is the solid, unsmiling imperial world of 1913.
King Edward VII's wish to commemorate his mother's reign led to a national
competition and public appeal in 1901 for the Queen Victoria Memorial. This
was won by Sir Aston Webb and there were sufficient funds left over for the
refronting of Buckingham Palace - a cover-up in Portland stone of the
crumbling facade that Edward Blore had designed for Queen Victoria. This
heavyweight axial arrangement at palace end of The Mall is matched by the
re-ordering carried out at the Trafalgar Square end where Sir Aston Webb
built the Admiralty Arch in 1910.
The joyous revelation that has been made possible by the opening of the
palace to the public will be the rediscovery of the world of King George IV
and his architect John Nash that still lies behind the somewhat rigid and
reserved public face of the palace. King George V appreciated Sir Aston
Webb's efforts to make the palace appear shipshape, and knighted Sir Thomas
Brock on the spot for his 13-foot high solid marble figure of Queen
Victoria, but it was the earlier King George who was responsible for
supporting the artistic and architectural achievement of Nash which can now
be shared by the public.
When the Prince Regent became King George IV at the age of 58 in 1820, there
was a sense manifested at his coronation that he represented a victorious
and thriving nation. It was felt that the effectiveness of the monarchy as a
symbol of national pride would be conveyed with more conviction if it could
be associated with a metropolitan palace of distinction. St. James's had
long been considered poverty-stricken, Kensington Place too modest, Hampton
Court and Greenwich too far away, and Carlton House too close to the street
and not grand enough for a monarch.
The nearest thing to a palace was undoubtedly Buckingham House, which King
George III had purchased in 1762 and settled upon his consort. It occupied
large grounds and had important family associations, as all George IV's
brothers and sisters had been born there. This was the house the king
decided to expand and virtually rebuild with Nash's help. There is no doubt
that King George IV and John Nash shared a vision of London as an important
and beautiful European capital. The construction of Regent Street, the
laying out of Regent's Park, and the replacement of Carlton House by the
great stucco Carlton House Terraces, are all part of this vision. The
picturesque arrangement of St. James's Park is largely the design of Nash
and it brought a particular relaxed Englishness to the palatial formality he
was to build on the site of Buckingham House.
Summer visitors to the palace will enter by a side door but will soon find
themselves in Nash's quadrangle which they will cross to enter the state
apartments through Nash's grand entrance portico. The original Nash palace
was a three-sided building open to The Mall, and roughly where the gates are
today stood the Marble Arch as a triumphal entry to the royal domain. It is
worth remembering that the architect had the restraining bones of old
Buckingham House to deal with, which had been added to but was never really
seen as a palace. Also, he was always under financial scrutiny and his
client had the reputation of letting money slip through his fingers with
remarkable ease. Despite all this Nash achieved a suite of state rooms that
is one of the architectural secrets of Europe.
Although some of their decoration has been modified the major rooms (with
the exception of the Picture Gallery) can be seen as largely Nash's
creation. The rooms with their furniture represent the final flowering of
the king's Francophile taste and reflect also the influence of Charles Long,
Lord Farnborough, who was the eminence grise behind all George IV's building
projects. What visitors will enjoy is the very high standard of
craftsmanship and sculpture in all the rooms. Nash rightly brought to the
palace the best carvers, sculptors and craftsmen he could find.
Each room is both dignified and rich: the Green Drawing Room and the Throne
Room on the courtyard side have a ceremonial distinction that sets them
apart from some of the more relaxed but equally rich rooms on the garden
side. Nash was good at smaller rooms, too, and at arranging for a sense of
theatre as visitors progress from the low-ceilinged ground floor rooms to
the grand staircase and the remarkable mirrored enfilade of the state rooms.
Originally George IV had intended Buckingham Palace to be his private London
residence while he used the refurbished state rooms of St James's Palace for
his Court functions and ceremonials. It was his buoyant enthusiasm for
Nash's new palace that brought about the decision to use it as a state
palace. It was this decision that was responsible for the immense enrichment
of the state rooms, especially the elaboration of their gilded ceilings. It
is important to remember that it is the Edwardian redecoration of Buckingham
Palace that gives it that overall air of red, white and gold. When Nash had
completed his work there was more colour, more silk on the walls and a less
institutional feel to much of the palace.
To see the state rooms today is still an immense thrill because they
represent one of the most original architectural achievements in any
European palace; they retain to a degree that particular sense of English
splendour that is both low-key and sumptuous.
