   Queen Elizabeth II opened a new session of
Parliament today by announcing government plans to force political
candidates in Northern Ireland to renounce violence and to impose
new controls on Britain's secret service.
   The monarch, wearing a long white gown and the state imperial
crown, outlined the far-reaching legislative program before
ermine-robed peers, diplomats and other members of the royal family
in the House of Lords.
   By tradition, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose officials
wrote the speech, and the other members of the House of Commons
stood at the back of the chamber.
   The Queen's speech, the 10th written by the Conservative
government since Mrs. Thatcher won power in 1979, also spelled out
plans to sell off the state-owned water and electricity utilities.
   The sales, bitterly opposed by the opposition Labor Party, are
the biggest and most controversial of Mrs. Thatcher's massive
privatization program.
   Crowds gathered in sunshine and cheered as the 62-year-old
monarch and her husband, Prince Philip, traveled to Parliament from
Buckingham Palace in a new horse-drawn coach, a bicentennial gift
from Australia.
   The $218,000 coach, the first new royal coach since 1910,
replaced the Irish State Coach traditionally used for the state
opening of Parliament. The coach, drawn by four gray horses, was
decorated at the queen's request with a kangaroo and the Australian
coat of arms instead of the royal arms.
   Australia is among 17 former British colonies that continue to
recognize the queen as their head of state.
   The 10-minute speech read by the queen outlined 16 new pieces of
legislation the government plans to introduce in the coming year.
   ``A bill will be introduced to put the security service on a
statutory basis,'' said the queen, announcing that formal operating
rules will be drawn up for the first time for Britain's MI5
counter-intelligence service.
   It remained unclear, however, whether the bill will make the
service accountable to Parliament. Officials said the measures would
not apply to MI6, the intelligence-gathering service.
   Some analysts predicted the bill will concentrate on tightening
MI5 agents' oaths of secrecy following the government's failed
attempt through courts in several countries to suppress the memoirs
of retired agent Peter Wright.
   Wright claimed in his book, ``Spycatcher,'' that MI5 tried to
destabilize the 1970s Labor Party government, bugged foreign
embassies and plotted to assassinate Egyptian President Gamal Abdul
Nasser.
   The proposed new laws include a liberalization of the 1911
Official Secrets Act, although critics note the proposals still
would not allow civil servants who leak unauthorized documents to
argue they acted in the public interest.
   On Northern Ireland, the queen said legislation will require
election candidates to make ``a declaration against terrorism.''
   The measure is aimed at the outlawed, mainly Roman Catholic Irish
Republican Army and its legal political front, Sinn Fein. The IRA is
fighting to unite Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic in a
single Catholic state.
   The government will make a new attempt to stop job discrimination
against the Catholic minority in the strife-torn British province,
and propose that all enterprises with as few 10 employees provide
data on the religious composition of its workers.
   The non-violence pledge proposed for electoral candidates follows
a ban this fall on broadcast interviews with members of the IRA and
10 other militant Northern Ireland groups, Catholic and Protestant.
   The government, provoking charges that it is sacrificing
democratic principles in an attempt to wipe out the IRA, also plans
to end the right of suspects throughout most of the United Kingdom
to remain silent under police interrogation.
   Other measures included a proposed bill to force soccer fans to
carry identity cards in a bid to curb the notorious behavior of
hooligan supporters.
