FT  30 JUN 94 / Arts: Charles bares his soul to the nation - Television

I blame Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue. It is their American chat shows,
both screened in Britain, which have set the trend for on-screen
self-analysis - for letting it all hang out. Prince Charles, always one for
a pretty trend, has now fallen for this one and came before the nation on
ITV last night in Charles, The Private Man, The Public Role, pouring out his
feelings like one of Donahue's transvestites or Oprah's food-bingers.
He thinks he's 'quite a sort of private person' and also 'one of those
people who searches'. He was interested in 'pursuing the path through the
thicket'. He happens to be one of those people, he can't help it, who 'feel
very strongly and deeply about things'.
Judged as a piece of television it was stunningly long winded (two and a
half hours) and, throughout many of its travelogue sequences,
narcoleptically dull. If there is anything less interesting in the world
than standing in a desert or on a podium making diplomatic speeches, it is
surely watching somebody else's home movies of the event afterwards, even if
Philip Bonham-Carter's photography was as good as ever.
But of course this was not simply a piece of television, this was the big
push in the charm offensive aimed at winning back ground after the hugely
successful PR campaign staged by Charles' estranged wife, the Princess of
Wales. Will it work? Hard to be sure, but if you consider it as a piece of
modern marketing, aimed at promoting a career, you would have to say that
the film makers faced a tough job.
Their subject, judging from this programme, is a man who on the one hand is
keen to take on the top appointment with all its power and riches, not to
mention a degree of kow-towing from those around him which looks positively
medieval. On the other hand he loathes the limelight, detests the mass media
(accusations of prurience crop up twice in this context) and sulks when
asked to take on public responsibilities which he does not fancy.
Furthermore he manages to combine reticence bordering on modesty in some
respects with remarkable conceit in others. His account of his own
supposedly admirable behaviour after the fatal Klosters accident was
squirm-making.
Boil it all down and there was little that was really new to be learned from
this programme. Prince Charles would rather be defender of all faiths than
one. Yes he was unfaithful to his wife, though we still do not know the
precise ins and outs of the Camilla Parker Bowles story. He favours some
form of national service, military or otherwise, sees nothing wrong in being
a super arms salesman for Britain, and would indeed go further and run the
British armed forces as Global Mercenaries plc.
Those were the revelations, but the significance of the programme lies
elsewhere. This was the latest in a sequence which began in 1953 when the
royals overruled the politicians and allowed the cameras into Westminster
Abbey so that the public could watch the crowning of Charles' mother. The
entire saga might be called 'Monarchy On The Box' or perhaps 'WestEnders'.
It has proceeded via the famous 1969 film Royal Family, and increasingly
'intimate' Christmas broadcasts and other documentaries, to yesterday's
programme.
For nearly four decades the received wisdom, shared by the present writer,
was that the Windsors were masters of the medium, brilliantly exploiting
modern mass communications to extend one of the world's most ancient
monarchies into the 21st century by way of popular acclaim. Yesterday's
monumental commercial must cast deep doubt on that idea.
