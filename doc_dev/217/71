'All happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy
in its own way.' Whether Tolstoy's famous words are true in all cases, the
present unhappy outlook for Britain's Royals contrasts with the prospects
for royal families elsewhere.
While the marriage troubles of Prince Andrew and Prince Charles are dragging
down public esteem for the UK monarchy, in other countries monarchy is on
the upsurge.
The best example is Spain where King Juan Carlos, since taking the
re-instituted throne in 1975, has won wide admiration, particularly for his
firm stand against the attempted coup 11 years ago.
But in Brazil, too, support for a monarchy is growing with the approach of
next year's plebiscite on constitutional change. While the main argument is
between parliamentarians and presidentialists, two sizeable groups are
urging the return of a king from the Braganca family. The last one, Dom
Pedro II, was deposed in 1889.
Alas, typically, the two factions cannot agree on which of his descendants
to promote.
Moreover, in Belgrade, 50,000 demonstrators lately took to the streets
demanding that Serbia's monarchy be restored in place of President Slobodan
Milosevic. Similar calls have been heard in the republic of Georgia. As for
else-
where . . .who knows: before very much longer even the Romanovs may be
preferred to Boris Yeltsin.
