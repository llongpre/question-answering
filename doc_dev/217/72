   An estimated 100,000 people gathered
in this Montenegrin city Sunday to pay homage to the region's last
monarch at a ceremonial reburial 73 years after his exile.
   The state funeral for King Nikola Petrovic-Njegos and Queen
Milena was the first official recognition by Communist Yugoslavia
of the country's royal past.
   Their remains were brought back to his homeland from Italy
Saturday, and the reburial ceremony included pageantry unseen in
this former tiny Balkan kingdom since his coronation.
   An open-air liturgy at Cetinje's monastery was followed by a
colorful procession of Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Moslem clergy
through the city's streets.
   A ceremonial unit of the former Montenegrin Navy, clad in
traditional 17th century uniforms, carried the king's saber and his
many medals, and marched along with Montenegrins in colorful
national costume.
   Nikola ruled Montenegro, now the smallest of Yugoslavia's six
republics, from 1860 to 1916, when he was forced into exile by
advancing Austro-Hungarian troops.
   He died in exile in 1921 and his mountain domain was
incorporated into the newly established south Slav kingdom by his
nephew, Serbian monarch Aleksandar Karadjordjevic.
   The nationally televised burial ceremony provided the first
chance for many Yugoslavs to see members of the Karadjordjevic
family, which reigned until a communist state was established in
1945.
   Tens of thousands lined Cetinje's streets and crowded balconies
and windows to see the cortege pulled by six black horses bearing
the coffins of the royal couple and their two daughters.
   The gun carriage was followed by Nikola's relatives, three
princesses of the exiled Karqdjordjevic dynasty. Other European
aristrocrats in the procession included Prince Vitorrio Emanuele Di
Savoia of Italy, Prince Dimitri Romanov of Russia and Crown Prince
Idriz Senussi of Libya.
   Montenegro's president, Branko Kostic, and other state officials
also attended in what appeared to be an effort by the region's new
Communist leadership to dissociate itself from its predecessors.
   The latest hard-liners were swept out of office in a wave of
popular unrest in January.
   ``The reburial of the royal family in their homeland has long
been put off under the excuse that the appropriate times have still
not come,'' Kostic said.
   Nikola's achievements still evoke pride among the 500,000
Montenegrins, who account for about 5 percent of the Yugoslav
population. In a series of battles against the Ottoman Turks,
Nikola managed to triple the area of his realm and keep it
independent.
