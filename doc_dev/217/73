   The wail of conch shells and the
chanting of monks opened a celebration honoring Bhumibol Adulyadej,
the hugely popular king who on Saturday became the longest-reigning
monarch in Thailand's 750-year history.
   The king's 42 years and 23 days on the throne eclipsed the
tenure of King Chulalongkorn, a visionary monarch who ruled from
1868 to 1910, when Thailand still was an absolute monarchy.
   The king and Queen Sirikit lit candles and incense sticks before
the ashes of King Chulalongkorn to begin the four days of religious
and royal celebrations. Monks chanted and conch shells sounded
during the ceremony.
   The king on Friday signed a decree to free or reduce the
sentences of about 50,000 prisoners charged with minor crimes. Such
royal amnesties are issued periodically to mark special occasions.
   The ceremonies in the Grand Palace _ a walled compound of
glittering spirals and imposing structures _ opened with the
presentation of special ``prayer fans'' to 44 senior Buddhist monks.
   Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, Cabinet ministers and senior
military officers were at the palace for the rites along with
members of the royal family.
   Bangkok buildings have been festooned with lights and
decorations for several days and a display of 29,999 fireworks is
planned. King Bhumibol is the ninth monarch of the current Chakri
dynasty and nine is generally considered an auspicious number by
Thais.
   Public festivities, including movies, concerts and folk dances,
have been scheduled throughout the country.
   The royal family is also to visit Ayuthaya, where they will pay
respects to the spirits of kingly ancestors of the old capital,
which was sacked by the Burmese in 1767.
   The royal seat subsequently was moved to Bangkok, where the
Chakri dynasty was founded in 1782 by Rama I.
   Rama IV, popularized in the West in the book and movie ``The
King and I,'' began changing traditional concepts of absolute rule
and introduced Western know-how to the country. Rama V reorganized
the state machinery, opened Thailand to further Western influence
but adroitly kept colonial powers at bay.
   Bhumibol, who turned 60 in December during another nationwide
celebration, was born in Boston, where his father studied medicine.
   The Swiss-educated prince assumed the throne upon the
still-mysterious death of his brother in 1946. He gradually
restored some of the power and prestige the monarchy lost in 1932
when a bloodless revolution ended its absolute rule.
   The king and his wife were a hit during a series of world tours
in the 1960s. The multi-talented monarch frequently shed his normal
seriousness to pick up a saxaphone and join in jazz jam sessions.
   In the 1970s and 80s, he and members of his family turned their
attention to the country's rural poor, initiating a network of
royal projects in irrigation, reforestation, agriculture and the
replacement of opium by other cash crops.
   The king would spend up to nine months of each year in the
countryside, away from the opulent palaces and elaborate ceremonies
in Bangkok.
   The king has stepped in on several occasions of national crisis,
including a 1973 student revolt against a trio of military
strongmen. The bloodshed was stopped and the trio exiled. He is
widely believed to wield considerable behind-the-scenes power and
is looked upon by Thais as a factor of stability in a modern
history punctuated by frequent military coups and factionalism.
