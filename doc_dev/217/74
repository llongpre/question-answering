<TEXT>     There, Crown Prince Alexander, pretender to the throne of Yugoslavia, holds
court.;    But there are no courtiers, no equerries, no aides -- just a
single, hard-pressed secretary. This is a monarch-in-waiting who has to earn
his living, which he does as a consultant in shipping, insurance and
advertising.;    But since the beginning of this year, the increasing tempo of
constitutional discussion has left him little time for business.;    With
tanks on the streets in Serbia and Croatia, Alexander's friends and advisers
believe the tide could turn suddenly in favor of restoration of the monarchy
as a way of uniting the warring federation of six republics.;    In a poll by
the Slovenian newspaper Mladina, 66.9 percent said they didn't know whether
the monarchy could provide a better solution than the present constitutional
options, but it couldn't possibly be worse. That's the way politics are in
Yugoslavia.;    "Restoration of the monarchy was theoretical until President
Tito's death. When he died in 1980, that created new possibilities," said one
of the crown prince's friends, Nemanja Marcetic, editor of the London-based
South Slav Journal.;    If the monarchy is restored, Alexander will be
stepping into danger. Two of his ancestors were murdered. "Black" George,
founder of the Karadjordje dynasty in 1811 was axed to death on the orders of
a rival, who had his head stuffed. Alexander's grandfather was assassinated in
Marseilles in 1934 by a Macedonian terrorist.;    Alexander has never set foot
in his homeland, although he has flown over it and sailed along the coast. Now
45, he was born in exile at London's Claridges Hotel in 1945.;    Alexander's
father, King Peter II, brought him up to believe that his first duty was to
the country of which he had been dispossessed -- along with the family's land,
castles and fortune -- by Tito.;    For a long time the idea of returning to
Yugoslavia must have seemed a faint dream. In 1948 the family moved to New
York. Alexander, who speaks six languages, had a cosmopolitan upbringing --
schools in Britain, Switzerland, a military academy in the United States,
Sandhurst royal military academy in England, a commission in an elite British
regiment.;    When King Peter died in 1970, Alexander decided not to claim the
title.;    A friend said: "There was a group of people who tried to get him to
become king, but he thought that to be a country-less king would be absurd and
unrealistic. He is a very down-to-earth man. He had to earn a living. He
couldn't afford to just sit around wishing he were king.";    As an ardent
democrat, Alexander wants to be restored only through the ballot box. He
points out the stability provided by constitutional monarchy in Western
Europe. Six of the 12 European Community countries are monarchies.;    "I
think the monarchy provides hope," he has said. (box)  </TEXT>
