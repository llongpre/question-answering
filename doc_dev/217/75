<HEAD>Monarch Has Pneumonia After Paralyzing Stroke</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>

   Norway's 86-year-old King Olav V, partially
paralyzed by a stroke over the weekend, has developed pneumonia,
doctors said Monday.
   The world's oldest reigning monarch suffered the stroke Saturday
while in the Oslo's Rikshospitalet. Doctors called his condition
``unsafe.''
   Earlier Monday, they said the paralysis of his left side improved
slightly but they warned of ``an approaching infection of his
lungs.'' A later statement said it was pneumonia.
   Well-wishers in Norway, a constitutional monarchy, sent a flood
of flowers, telegrams and letters to the popular monarch, often
called ``The People's King,'' said the palace in a statement.
   The king formally installs the prime minister and Cabinet but has
no real political power.
   Churches throughout Norway included prayer for Olav in services
Monday.
   Crown Prince Harald, in line to succeed Olav, stayed with his
father during the weekend. All members of the royal family visited
the king Sunday and Monday. His oldest daughter, Princess Ragnhild,
flew in from her home in Brazil Monday, despite having influenza.
   Olav had been hospitalized last Tuesday for treatment of a mild
infection of his pericardium, a membraneous sac surrounding the
heart. The stroke came one day after Olav was advised to remain in
the hospital for observation through the weekend.
   King Olav, who has ruled Norway since 1957, became the world's
oldest reigning monarch when Japan's Emperor Hirohito died in
January last year at age 87.
   A 1928 Olympic gold medalist in yatching, King Olav spent his
86th birthday last July sailing in an Oslo regatta aboard his
18-foot sailboat. He last sailed in the Oslo fjord a few weeks ago.
   
   Polls regularly rank Olav as Norway's best-liked person. About 90
percent of the 4.2 million people in this egalitarian welfare state
still favor the monarchy, according to surveys.
   
   Queen Martha, his Swedish-born cousin and wife, died in 1954. He
never remarried.
   
   The Norwegian king, born Prince Alexander Edward Christian
Fredrik of Denmark, was two years old when Norway left its union
with Sweden in 1905 to become an independent monarchy. His father,
Danish Prince Carl, took the name King Haakon VII when he was
invited to take the Norwegian throne.
