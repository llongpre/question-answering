   With trumpet fanfare and honor guards, Queen
Elizabeth II celebrated with Parliament on Wednesday the 300th
anniversary of the Glorious Revolution that curbed royal power and
paved the way for democratic freedoms.
   The queen, speaking in Parliament's 11th-century Westminster
hall, told 1,500 lawmakers and guests the bloodless events that led
to constitutional monarchy and a bill of rights ushered in ``an
epoch of freedom under the law.''
   ``It was the beginning of a political process which has
continued to the present day,'' she said, flanked by the bewigged
leaders of the two British houses of Parliament, as well as leaders
of nearly 40 Commonwealth countries which inherited their
parliamentary systems from the British empire.
   Some wore British-style black robes, others turbans, tricorner
hats or tribal skirt and beads.
   ``No one could claim even today that the state has been
perfected. In multi-cultural Britain, there is still a long way to
go,'' she said. ``But after 1688 there were signposts to point the
way.''
   A bevy of royalty including the heir to the Dutch throne, Prince
William of Orange, and a U.S. delegation led by former Supreme
Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger from the College of William &amp;
Mary in Virginia, also sat near the queen during the
pageantry-filled ceremony.
   William and Mary, a staunchly Protestant Dutch prince and his
English bride, took over the throne as constitutional monarchs
ruling with Parliament's consent after opposition to the
authoritarian, pro-Catholic rule of James II, England's last
absolute monarch, drove him to exile. Mary was James' daughter and
William his nephew and third in line to the English throne.
   After the new monarchs arrived from Holland, they accepted a
parliament-made declaration of rights which became law in 1689 and
underlined Parliament's powers, called for it to meet frequently,
and for its members to enjoy free speech and be elected freely.
   It barred the throne from imposing taxes or raising armies in
peace time without Parliament's approval.
   Nearly 100 years later, the restless American colonies drew from
the English bill of rights and its resistance to authoritarianism
in drafting their own Declaration of Independence and Constitution.
   ``It was a good example,'' said Burger, chancellor of the
college which was founded by William and Mary in 1693 and
designated by the U.S. Congress with presidential approval to
represent the country at the ceremony.
   ``The Glorious Revolution was really the concept of `we the
people,''' he said in an interview before the ceremony. ``It was
the beginning of the end of the divine right of kings.''
   Wednesday's ceremony was one highlights of a year of
tercentenary celebrations. The tercentenary, which will be feted
with events from exhibitions to bicyle races, also has raised
controversy.
   Some historians argue that after 1688, power remained with the
upper classes and Catholics were oppressed, most notably in
Ireland, where James tried to stage a comeback and was defeated by
William in 1690 at the Battle of the Boyne.
   Jonathan Clark, an Oxford University professor who has written
two books on the era, said in an interview that freedoms evolved
slowly.
   ``(They) must be defended, but I don't think they can be
safeguarded by pointing to one document. It's dangerous to deal in
illusions,'' he said.
   Addressing Wednesday's gathering, Speaker of the House of
Commons Bernard Weatherill said, ``Some have questioned the
significance of the revolutionary settlement of 1689 and the
motives of those involved.
   ``But the facts are plain. Before the bill of rights was passed,
those rights often had been set aside or denied. Since 1689, they
have never been successfully challenged.''
   The queen, her husband the Duke of Edinburgh and the Dutch
Prince William were spending the night at Torbay in southern
England, near the spot where William landed. On Thursday they will
watch 400 Dutch and British boats re-enact William's arrival.
