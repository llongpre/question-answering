   Vice President George Bush is a distant cousin of
Queen Elizabeth II and has blood ties with every other European
royal family on or off the throne, according to the publishing
director of a blueblood directory.
   Going by precedent, that bodes well for Bush in November's
presidential election, predicted Harold Brooks-Baker, an American
who has made a name for himself analyzing royal lineages,
especially where they link up with the White House.
   ``Without any shadow of doubt, Vice President George Bush is
connected to more imperial, royal and noble houses than any
previous president,'' he said.
   ``No other American running for office in the primaries in the
Republican or Democratic Party is of European royal descent. Every
time there has been an election in the United States where a man of
royal descent was featuring, the man with royal descent won,''
Brooks-Baker said.
   On Tuesday, he released a copy of Bush's family tree traced by
his directory, Burke's Peerage, back to the 1400s.
   It found that Bush is a long-lost relative _ 13th cousin twice
removed _ of Britain's current monarch, and is a direct descendant
of King Henry VII, of one of Charles II's mistresses and of Henry
VIII's younger sister, Mary, who married King Louis XII of France.
   Charles' mistress, Barbara Villiers, who lived from 1641 to
1706, was a sixth cousin of the vice president's
great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother, Elizabeth
Wellington Fay, he said.
   Miss Villiers' liaison with the king lasted 12 years, during
which she bore seven children, of whom only five were publicly
acknowleged as his.
   Bush's American roots were planted by Dr. Richard Palgrave, his
grandfather seven times removed, who crossed the Atlantic in 1630,
Brooks-Baker said.
   Bush is related to all 60 royal families on the European
Continent, including the children of Monaco's Prince Rainier and
his late American wife, Grace Kelly, in five different ways, he
said. He is also a distant cousin of the King of Albania and the
pretender to the French throne.
   Brooks-Baker said that while very few Americans are descendants
of European monarchs, ``an unbelievably high proportion of American
presidents are connected to the `Blood Royal.'''
   ``Mr. Bush is without doubt connected to more great royal
families than any reigning head of state today except His Serene
Highness Prince Franz Josef of Liechtenstein.''
   The vice president also is related to 21 of Britain's 26 dukes,
he said.
   Brooks-Baker said Burke's Peerage traced Bush's family tree
without his official approval, but a copy has been sent to him.
   ``Because Mr. Bush is so determined to be ... sort of the common
man, he shies away from this sort of thing,'' he said in an
interview.
   ``After documenting every president from George Washington,
Burke's Peerage felt that to have a possible president who was as
royal as this and who is basically related to everyone you could
imagine is too good a chance to show our genealogical strength.''
   It was Burke's Peerage who discovered that President Reagan was
a descendant of Ireland's 11th century warrior king, Brian Boru.
   Former American presidents with royal connections include
Richard Nixon, a descendant of Britain's Edward III; William Henry
Harrison and Benjamin Harrison, descended from Henry III; Ulysses
S. Grant, whose forefathers were of Byzantine nobility; and
Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt who were descended from Dutch
nobility.
