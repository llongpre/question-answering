A group of Conservative backbenchers is threatening to deny the government
greater powers to repeal legislation.
The threat emerged as the de-regulation bill last night gained its second
reading. The bill would allow the government to repeal primary legislation
by statutory order.
A Liberal Democrat amendment depriving ministers of the proposed new powers
was defeated by 320 votes to 287, a government majority of 37.
However, a number of Tories said they were likely to vote against the
government when the bill reached the committee stage. Mr Richard Shepherd,
MP for Aldridge-Brownhills, said he was concerned about the constitutional
implications: 'One day we may form the Opposition. I urge a very cautious
rethink of this measure.'
Mr Edward Garnier, Tory MP for Harborough, said he had 'constitutional
concerns' over the bill's provisions relating to ministers' powers. He said
such concerns 'are well meant and sincere'.
Government whips fear difficulty in overturning any Lords amendment aimed at
diluting the powers ministers seek.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the industry minister responsible for de-regulation, last
night said the powers were mainly designed to repeal uncontroversial
legislation. He made it clear that 'every regulation in place is under
review'.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, played on Conservative
fears that the government was trying to weaken parliamentary procedure by
suspending acts of parliament using statutory instruments which only need a
90-minute debate. This was 'a Henry VIII clause', he said, because of 'that
monarch's tendency to absolutism'.
He went on to say that of 3,500 regulations being examined by the
government, 71 per cent had been introduced since the Tories came to office
in 1979. 'It is not our regulations they are complaining about, it is their
regulations,' he said.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said he
recognised the case for shedding regulations that were 'a genuine barrier to
efficiency and understanding'. He added: 'But there are clear concerns as to
how this can be done, what the mechanisms should be and how we can ensure
that this is properly addressed and properly debated.'
