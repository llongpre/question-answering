  [Text] Durban Feb 14 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini 
hinted strongly at secession on Monday, saying he was preparing 
to promulgate a constitution for kwaZulu and Natal to establish 
an autonomous monarchy. 
  King Zwelithini said in a memorandum to be delieverd to 
State 
President F. W. de Klerk in Durban later on Monday [14 February] 
that with the adoption of the national interim constitution, and 
after failed negotiations to amend it, "a situation has emerged 
which brings back into existence the kingdom of kwaZulu and its 
full sovereignty". 
  "I am preparing myself to promulgate the constitution of 
kwaZulu and Natal which will establish a monarchy modelled after 
the best examples of democratic and pluralistic monarchies in 
the world." The current national constitution "is not the 
constitution of the Zulu nation, which will neither now -- nor 
at any time in the future -- be bound by this constitution". 
  He said the Zulu nation retained its inalienable right to 
self- determination and "if the society expressed by the Zulu 
nation cannot co-exist with other societies in a united South 
Africa, then it becomes necessary and ineluctable that the 
society expressed by the Zulu nation exists on its own, with its 
own territorial bases and with its own government". 
  King Zwelithini said the Zulu nation had always been a 
sovereign one. Although his nation had been conquered, its 
sovereignty had not been eliminated. "Those who conquered us, 
namely the white nations of Afrikaner and British, are now 
relinquishing their sovereignty over the land of South Africa. 
The nation which was exercising sovereignty over the land is 
abdicating its power to open the door for new nations to 
exercise their sovereignty over the land. Under this set of 
circumstances, I take the position that the sovereignty of the 
Zulu nation is revived, and I am advised that this position is 
also supported by the international law of decolonisation." 
  The Zulu nation had not been defeated in war or conquered by 
"those who are preparing themselves to exercise their 
sovereignty over the land". 
  "Therefore we take the position that they have gained no 
right for themselves to rule over our nation, and their rule 
cannot force us to merge with all other nations of South Africa 
in a unified government." 
  The Zulu nation did not want to be ruled by a government of 
a 
unitary state but would be ruled only by its own government for 
its own people. "I demand that you, Mr President, give the Zulu 
nation the opportunity to become free once again and to choose 
their own destiny for themselves." 
  The Zulu monarch charged the interim constitution did not 
offer space for his nation's survival. Referring to the 
rewriting of the interim constitution by a constituent assembly 
after the April elections, King Zwelithini said the Zulu 
monarchy and nation "cannot walk this road". 
  The king rejected the notion of a referendum in 
Natal/kwaZulu 
on the future of the region, saying it would become an intensely 
fought party political contest between those who wanted to 
"subjugate kwaZulu to Pretoria, and those who want the 
expression of sovereignty in kwaZulu to be a healing of the 
divisions in kwaZulu". 
  Earlier, kwaZulu chief minister and Inkatha Freedom Party 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi told about 20,000 Zulus packed 
into King's Park soccer stadium that he wanted peace, and for 
that the issues raised by the king would have to be addressed.
