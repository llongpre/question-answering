Lesson one for managing a colony of bees is that they are in charge and you
had better not forget it.
Lesson two is that you begin at the top of the hive and work downwards,
otherwise you disturb all the bees at once which may annoy them.
Lesson three is that you are entering a political economy of considerable
sophistication and a copy of Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan might come in handy.
Inside the hive, communal life is hectic with the sap now coursing through
the Pennines and bright yellow or purple flowers are suddenly abundant.
Aubretia tumbles out of stone walls and each patch of spare ground offers a
welcome mat of dandelions and daisies. There is pollen to be had in sackfuls
and nectar flowing in even the least prized of flowers. After long months of
icy standstill, the hive's economy is booming so vigorously that it can
support 60,000 workers, which is 10 times its winter population.
As you look down on them at work, the wide image is of a bewildering mass
seething with bustle and muddle, like maggots in a fisherman's tin. But each
close-up reveals a skilled worker carefully side-stepping her neighbours as
she goes about her task with calm efficiency, and the pattern soon appears
of a densely-staffed Fordist workplace in which the ceaseless activity of
individual cell-polishers, guards, foragers and brood nurses contributes
precisely to the survival and welfare of the whole.
If you lift out the frames of comb one at a time and search long enough, you
may find one bee whose task never changes throughout her life. She is the
queen, the supreme economic decision-maker, the sole egg-layer, the absolute
ruler with power to ordain success or failure for the communal effort. It
can be difficult to spot her because, apart from her extra length, she looks
identical to the workers around her and tends to move in a cluster of
attendants who keep her hidden from view. But once you find her and follow
her apparently random progress, you can observe the policy of the hive
being, literally, laid down.
She glides over the face of the brood-comb, occasionally stopping to shimmy
her long abdomen backwards into an empty cell and lay a tiny white egg at
the bottom. She can, at will, lay up to 3,000 in a day. Or she can lay none.
It is a critical judgment and if she gets it right, then the changing size
of the workforce through the season will match the needs of the hive. There
are dangers on either side - if she lays too few eggs, she will leave the
hive understaffed during the honey-flow and unable to build up its stores;
while if she lays too many eggs, she will produce a surplus of mouths to
feed. It is a difficult balance to strike and in Buxton, Derbyshire, at the
very margin of survival, there is almost no room for error.
So while the hive is looking fine economically, there must be doubts about
the resilience of its political constitution which places all responsibility
on one pair of shoulders. Are the checks and balances in order? To put it
bluntly, what happens if the old girl loses her touch?
The answer is reassuring, except for the old girl in question. The social
contract among bees provides for absolute monarchy during a queen's reign
but permits her no part at all in the succession.
Exactly as set out in Leviathan, the sovereign's enjoyment of total power
may be brought to an abrupt end at any time by a deadly uprising of the mob.
It does not require a tumbril, merely the levelling stings of a dozen worker
bees and, once the deed is done, the mob turns from regicide to the
immediate production of a new queen of its choice.
It is a triumph of constitutional ruthlessness which rids the hive of
ineffective monarchs and spares it the embarrassment of useless heirs to the
throne. You do not need a microscope to see that honey bees are born without
forelocks.
