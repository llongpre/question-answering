FT  22 MAY 93 / Ireland's president to take tea at the palace

AFTER seven decades during which British monarchs seemed to overlook the
existence of the neighbouring Irish Republic, the royal frost has now thawed
a little. Ireland's President Mary Robinson has been invited to London for
tea with the Queen.
Buckingham Palace did not announce next Thursday's visit, but it confirmed
leaks from Dublin. It will be a private visit, a courtesy call, a palace
official said yesterday. There is no question of a state occasion.
The Queen went to Germany last year, hoping to heal wounds of the second
world war. She visited Spain in 1988, shrugging off the UK's territorial
dispute over Gibraltar. In the US, once a British colony, the Queen draws
crowds. The French have been known to wave flags for her.
But historical divisions between Britain and Ireland live on. No British
king or queen has met an Irish president. The last monarch to visit southern
Ireland was Edward VII in 1903 - almost 20 years before the partitioning of
Ulster and the creation of an Irish Free State.
Next week's visit illustrates the improvement in UK-Irish government
relations which - even as late as the 1980s - were punctuated by
ill-tempered outbursts over the extradition of Irish terrorists, or the
quality of British justice.
The neighbourliness is not reflected, however, in Northern Ireland.
Yesterday local election results in the province set back hopes of Irish and
British ministers that 'round-table' political talks on the province's
political future would be re-started soon.
The better-than-expected performance of the Rev Ian Paisley's hard-line
Democratic Unionist party will only encourage him in his pledge not to
resume negotiations until Ireland compromises on its territorial claim on
the north. Also faring well was Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA
which is excluded from talks by both the Irish and the British governments.
The territorial dispute over Northern Ireland remains the unofficial reason
why diplomats in London and Dublin continue to advise their respective heads
of state against a formal meeting.
But there are, perhaps, personal memories too; the Queen's cousin Lord
Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA in 1979.
