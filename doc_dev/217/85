<F P=106> [Article by Farouk Chothia and Ann Eveleth] </F>
  [Text] A break has opened up between Zulu king Goodwill 
Zwelithini and Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, as the 
monarch moves to adopt a non-partisan stance in the continuining 
conflict between Inkatha and the ANC in KwaZulu/Natal. 
  Sources close to the Royal House and the ANC leadership in 
the province revealed this week that Zwelithini, freed of his 
economic dependency on Buthelezi, had already taken several 
concrete steps to publicly demonstrate his independence. 
  This puts Buthelezi's self-style role as the king's prime 
minister -- and thus his traditionalist power-base in 
KwaZulu/Natal -- under threat. 
  Sources say Zwelithini has indicated Buthelezi will not be 
included in the Royal Council the king will form to advise him 
on political and other issues. 
  Zwelithini's absence from a ceremony last Friday in Ulundi, 
in which Buthelezi was to present the provincial cabinet to the 
monarch, was seen as a snub to Buthelezi. The ceremony went 
ahead in the presence of Prince Reginald. 
  Zwelithini was said to be ill. But Minister of Public Works 
Jeff Radebe said the king's absence had been no accident in the 
context of the ongoing cabinet crisis: Zwelithini had wanted to 
demonstrate his neutrality and aloofness from party politics. 
  In other shows of independence, the king has also: 
  -- Avoided attending public functions with Buthelezi since 
the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] announced its participation in 
elections. While Buthelezi held a victory rally two weeks ago, 
the monarch was locked in top-level talks with the ANC 
leadership in Nongoma. 
  -- A week after the election he attended the inauguration of 
a chief in Mthunzini without Buthelezi. 
  -- After a brief meeting with Mandela at the presidential 
inauguration in Pretoria, Zwelithini held another meeting with 
him the next day. The two reached an agreement which saw the 
KwaZulu Police [KZP] being replaced by the South African 
National Defence Force as Zwelithini's security personnel. 
Sources say Zwelithini believed the KZP "were spying" on him 
for the IFP. 
  Zwelithini's journey to Pretoria to meet Mandela without 
Buthelezi was interpreted as another act of defiance. Acting on 
advice from the Inkatha leader, the king had previously insisted 
that Mandela meet him in Ulundi. Zwelithini had ignored 
Buthelezi's appeals to him not to meet Mandela. 
  -- At Zwelithini's request, defeated ANC premier candidate 
Jacob Zuma and other ANC leaders in the province visited the 
Royal Palace in Nongoma two weeks ago. Several royal princes 
were also present, although those who have played a key role 
under Buthelezi's government were absent. 
  Sources said Zwelithini was being encouraged to break away 
from Buthelezi and the IFP by several members of the Royal 
House. These included non-IFP princes, some of his wives and 
some of his children. The Mail and Guardian is aware of the 
identities of those involved. Prince Petros Zulu, who was seen 
as an ANC sympathiser, was gunned down at his home in Ulundi 
last year. Sources said Zwelithini was deeply disturbed by his 
death. 
  In his strongest statement indicating ruptures within the 
Royal Household, Buthelezi appealed at last Friday's ceremony 
"to members of the Zulu Royal Household not to sabotage what we 
are trying to achieve for His Majesty, the institution of the 
monarchy, and the kingdom. I know that it was members of the 
Zulu Royal House who ended the life of our founder king, King 
Shaka ka Senzangakhona. 
  "It is strange that throughout history there are always 
coteries of the Royal House who take it upon themselves to try 
and undermine what is being done for the king and the kingdom. 
Your Royal Highnesses, do not allow history to repeat itself." 
  Two weeks ago Buthelezi said: "I am sad to tell you 
concerted efforts are being made to drive a wedge between me, as 
the king's traditional prime minister, and the king."
