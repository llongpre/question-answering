   A Conservative Party leader criticized Prince
Charles' outspokenness on social issues, saying the 39-year-old
future monarch's ``problem'' is he's never been allowed to take
responsibility for anything.
   Norman Tebbit, former chairman of the governing party and seen
as a potential successor to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said
the prince sympathizes with the jobless, for example, because ``in
a way he's got no job.''
   Tebbit made the remarks during a British Broadcasting Corp.
documentary called ``Charles, Prince of Conscience,'' broadcast
Monday, which outlined the controversy surrounding the prince's
forthright comments and his reported dissatisfaction with a life of
protocol and polo.
   The monarch is constitutionally barred from political
involvement, and other members of the royal family traditionally
refrain from commenting on politically sensitive topics.
   The eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II, however, often has spoken
out about inner-city decay, conditions of the poor and jobless, and
architecture. His stands on stimulating inner cities have
reportedly differed from the government's and irritated Mrs.
Thatcher.
   Opposition Labor Party politicians criticized Tebbit's remarks
as ``foolish,'' saying they indicated Mrs. Thatcher's government
was trying to stifle criticism.
   Two major newspapers, in editorials Monday based on
pre-broadcast reports of the interview, also defended Charles.
   In the BBC program, Tebbit said Charles' outspoken comments
would be dangerous only if ``he went too far, if he advocated a
socialist solution, a Labor Party solution.''
   But when asked if he saw a risk in Charles' outspokenness,
Tebbit said, ``Perhaps it is a sign of his own impatience with his
own life, which is very restrictive in what he can do and say.''
   ``Now, whether his judgment is always right or not, well, we all
have our opinions about that,'' said Tebbit, who left the Cabinet
to care for his wife. Mrs. Tebbit was severely injured a 1985 Irish
Republican Army bombing.
   He said, ``any criticism (by Charles) of the world as it is
sounds like a criticism of the government.''
   ``I suppose the Prince of Wales naturally feels extra sympathy
towards those who've got no job,'' Tebbit said, ``because in a way
he's got no job and he's prohibited from having a job until he
inherits the throne.''
   Although approaching middle age, the prince has ``not been able
to take responsibility and authority for anything,'' he said. ``I
think that is really his problem.''
   Charles, in a BBC interview last year, said ``it would be easier
to lead a quieter life'' but that he was ``driven'' to try to help
the poor.
   ``I don't need to do this, but I feel strongly about a lot of
these things and I cannot do nothing about it,'' said Charles, who
heads several programs to help the poor and disadvantaged youths.
   On architecture, Charles called one planned museum addition ``a
monstrous carbuncle'' and dubbed another planned building ``a glass
stump.'' In both cases the plans were scrapped.
   While many have applauded Charles's criticisms, some architects
have complained that as a man who is neither elected nor possessed
of any architectural qualifications, he has no right to make such
attacks.
   Most recently, he rekindled controversy surrounding his position
by telling journalists he ``was determined not to be confined to
cutting ribbons,'' The New York Times reported in February.
   Palace officials have stoutly denied that the 62-year-old queen
will abdicate to allow her son to become king.
   Jack Cunningham, Labor Party spokesman on the environment,
called Tebbit's comments ``clearly foolish and almost offensive.''
   He said he believed the public wanted their future monarch to
understand their problems and the prince ``is demonstrating a real
concern for the people of this country.''
   Opposition lawmaker Bruce Grocott accused Tebbit of trying to
silence such voices of opposition as trade unions and local
government and ``it seems now he is trying to intimidate'' the
monarchy as well.
   Public opinion polls have shown support for the prince's action
and some desire even more outspokenness. A February survey in The
Mail, a London newspaper, found 57 percent of the 1,086 adults
asked said Charles should spend most of his time speaking out on
controversial subjects.
