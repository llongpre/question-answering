<HEAD>Government Acts to End Annual Row Over Royal Finances</HEAD>

   In an attempt to end yearly budget-time rows over
the royal allowance, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Tuesday
the royal family will receive a fixed annual increase for the next
decade.
   Such an arrangement was used for about 200 years before 1975.
Then, the government began granting the royal allotment on an
annual basis as part of the national budget.
   The Civil List, as the payment is known, will rise at about 7.5
percent per year for the next decade, Mrs. Thatcher said.
   She said the royal family is ``a focus of patriotism, loyalty,
affection and esteem. It is a rare combination and we should value
it.''
   Behind her move was the wish to avoid the annual budget-day
``pay rise'' announcement, which both politicians and the royal
family found unseemly. Anti-monarchists used the budget
announcement as a chance to attack the expense of maintaining the
royals.
   Under the 1990 budget, the royal allowance totalled about $12.1
million. Queen Elizabeth II received the lion's share at $9.26
million.
   The Civil List officially repays the monarch and 10 other
members of her family for official duties. About 70 percent of the
money goes to salaries and employment costs for royal staff.
   The queen has 250 permanent full-time employees, including those
in her private office, the Buckingham Palace press office staff and
those responsible for ceremonial duties.
   Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, is not on the Civil
List. He receives undisclosed income from royal estates.
   Opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock applauded the new
arrangement and said it would ``provide for greater continuity and
more effective planning in the financing of the royal household.''
   Meanwhile, the queen has recruited a leading London accountant
to help run her households more efficiently.
   Michael Peat, 40, a partner in the accounting firm of Peat
Marwick McLintock, was named the royal household's director of
finance and property services. He will oversee the management of
Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, St. James Palace and Kensington
Palace.
