   The 3,000 princes of the ruling Saud
family are the cement that holds the kingdom together. Most experts
agree any effective rebellion would have to be led from within the
family.
   The royal family controls every aspect of life, and has remained
united on the critical succession issue and important policy
matters.
   It has produced the Arab world's first astronaut, Prince Sultan
bin Salman, who flew on the U.S. space shuttle Discovery in 1984.
   Saudi Arabia's current rulers are descendants of King Abdulaziz
ibn Saud, who founded the kingdom in 1927 by conquering the desert
tribes of the Arabian Peninsula.
   The Saud family has been largely responsible for guiding a
tribal society of impoverished nomads into a cohesive modern state
whose oil wealth has made it a financial superpower.
   King Fahd, who has ruled since 1982, is believed to be the
world's second- richest person. Fortune Magazine estimated his
fortune in 1988 at $18 billion. The Sultan of Brunei is said to
worth several billion more.
   Fahd has a lavishly furnished Boeing 747, a $60 million yacht
protected by Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and luxury homes in
Spain, Britain and France.
   Secrecy surrounds the private life of the chain-smoking monarch,
who in his youth was a playboy prince known in Europe's gambling
clubs.
   He is 69, the fourth son of Abdulaziz to succeed his father, who
had 43 sons by 22 wives.
   After Crown Prince Abdullah, 67, and Defense Minister Sultan,
63, the succession is expected to go to the eldest of 20 younger
brothers who is considered able.
   The last son of Abdulaziz sons will have the job, with his inner
circle of princes called ``those who tie and untie,'' of selecting
the eldest, most respected from among the hundreds of male
grandchildren.
   Family members who break the rules are dealt with quickly and
firmly.
   One of Fahd's younger brothers, Prince Mishari, then 19, was
imprisoned in 1951 after shooting the British vice-consul in Jiddah
to death while drunk.
   In 1965, when King Saud's regime was discredited by widespread
corruption and the king's profligate and irrational decisions, the
family supported his overthrow in favor of the respected Faisal.
   After Faisal was assassinated by a deranged nephew on March 25,
1975, the crown passed quietly to Khaled, Fahd's half-brother. The
nephew was beheaded. Khaled died in June 1982.
   The only significant, independent move against a Saudi ruler
since the state was founded occurred under King Saud.
   A group of his younger brothers, critical of his misrule, were
influenced by Egypt's revolutionary leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser.
   Led by Prince Talal, they organized the ``Free Princes''
movement to dump Saud and create a constitutional monarchy. The
movement failed and the princes were exiled in 1962.
   Prince Turki, another of Fahd's brothers, was fired as deputy
defense minister in 1978 for drunkenness and an embarrassing
marriage to the daughter of Mohammed al-Fassi, a doctor.
   Al-Fassi relatives used Turki's money to buy a Hollywood
mansion, which was then painted lime green. They shocked even
Californians by highlighting the sexual organs of classical
statuary in bright orange.
