The 'Charles and Diana' story is the opium of the people. It attracts
immense interest in most countries, but at home it does more. In Britain,
gossip about the private life of the scions of the House of Windsor is an
obsession of the tabloids, a quick-seller for the serious newspapers,
dominant on the airwaves, an easy topic of conversation, the stuff of
fantasy and scribblers' invention, marginal, fluffy, inconsequential - and,
as such, a substitute for thought, a painkiller for a bewildered national
psyche. It is, in short, a constant distraction from genuine problems of
governance, evidence of a polity thrashing around for a sense of purpose.
The latter is the serious element in an essentially unserious flow of media
pap. It may be that this flow has latterly been stimulated by the heir to
the throne and his estranged wife, but that is beside the point. The British
people approach the end of the 20th century as uncertain about their role in
the world as at any time since the end of empire. Historians will be
justified if they label it the century of moral decline.
The final decade is already looking inglorious. A prize for literature is
awarded to a 'novel' widely acknowledged to be illiterate. A fund is set up
to spend the proceeds of a national lottery on celebrating the millennium,
but no one, not even the minister in charge, has articulated a clear idea of
what that means, or what there is to celebrate. At a conference of the
governing party, a yob makes a successful bid for the front pages by lifting
his kilt for the cameras.
We affect to be shocked, but our sensibilities are numbed. Nothing is
sacred, least of all religion. There is some tut-tutting when a clergyman is
dismissed for professing a lack of belief in God. Several of our television
comedians appear to be motivated by a militant, even spiteful, atheism. The
end of deference may be welcome, but in its place has come - a void. We
revel in titillating accounts of the sexual misdemeanours of this or that
government minister and affect surprise when we hear that various officials,
elected and appointed, appear to have been lining their own pockets, or
allowing their relatives to do so. We live in the kingdom of Grab, an empty
commonwealth in which, when financial fiddles are revealed, some wonder
whether the misdemeanour lies in the act, or the getting caught.
In such a world, prattle about whether the monarchy will survive the war of
the royal books is mere escapism. Prince Charles and Princess Diana have
been subsumed into the production line of the media; they have become its
primary raw material, second only to paper. They are the prince and princess
of publishing. Their original image, that of the shyly spooning couple, was
a romantic fiction in the preparation of which they connived. They are now
assisting in the manufacture of the salacious prose that may diminish or
possibly even destroy one or both of them.
Does it matter? At the Conservative party conference in Bournemouth last
week the senior minister at our dining-table was asked what he made of it
all. 'You are addressing the wrong person,' came the reply. 'I give little
thought to these things. All we need to know is that most voters are
monarchists. Nearly all of them hold the Queen in high regard. End of
story.'
Mr John Major concurs. 'I think the monarchy has got its roots sunk so deep
in the affairs of the people of this country that it is very sound and
secure,' the prime minister said yesterday. His confidence is supported by
precedent. Two centuries have passed since James Gillray's caricatures
savagely attacked the extravagance and promiscuous behaviour of the
'voluptuary', the then Prince of Wales. The crown survived. Nearly 60 years
have flown by since the abdication of Edward VIII was forced upon him when
he declared his intention of marrying Mrs Wallis Simpson, the American
divorcee. His niece is still on the throne.
There is no constitutional reason why the Queen's eldest son should not
succeed her. That he shall do so is, as it happens, the essence of the
British constitution. The Prince's qualification for the job is that he is
of his mother born. His private behaviour is irrelevant. This is not a
change of mind on my part. I have long advocated the setting up of a federal
republic of Britain, on the ground that the executive hides behind 'crown
prerogative' as an excuse for misgovernment. Hanging everything on the tag
of the supposed royal command is a licence to print honours, a permit for
the exercise of patronage.
Yet I would cheerfully salute the accession of Prince Charles if the throne
were first to become detached from the executive, made contractually
subservient to the people, and defined in a written constitution. It might
then usefully be slimmed down, becoming a 'bicycle monarchy' as in northern
Europe. It would certainly benefit from a period of reticence about itself,
as the Duke of Edinburgh intimated yesterday. In such clearly-defined
circumstances, the role of an hereditary king as a focus of loyalty to the
nation - that is, of all of us to one another - could as well be fulfilled
by Prince Charles as anyone. Better that, as they said at the recent Liberal
Democrat conference in Brighton, than President Tebbit or, heaven help us,
President Thatcher.
Meanwhile Queen Elizabeth II is more likely than not to reign well into the
next century. The first queen bearing her name ruled during a flowering of
English culture; hers were years of national glory. The second Elizabeth,
possessed of few powers, has been less fortunate. She has been able to
reign, but not rule. She has been steadfast and dutiful, but her governments
have not covered themselves in glory. They have left the nation uncertain
about whether it belongs to the continent to which it is attached.
As a nuclear power and permanent member of the security council, Britain
retains the vestiges of its 'great' past, but lacks the self-confidence to
participate wholeheartedly in the affairs of the European Union. We cling to
illusory 'certainties', such as 'sovereignty' and the idealised Victorian
royal family. We know that reality lies elsewhere. Some - perhaps most - of
us cannot bear the knowledge. To get through the night, we tune in to
'Charles and Di,' and go back to sleep.
