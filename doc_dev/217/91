FT  06 JUN 94 / Arts (Openings): Royal Court Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal family comes to the London stage on Saturday when Sue Townsend's
theatrical and updated version of The Queen and I, her novel about a deposed
monarchy transplanted to a council estate, arrives in the main auditorium of
the Royal Court (previews from tomorrow). Doon Mackichan plays Princess
Diana. In the Theatre Upstairs, from Thursday, there is blood, guts, and
violence from the Roman playwright Seneca. His Thyestes, adapted here by
Caryl Churchill, combines macabre gore and stern moralising.
