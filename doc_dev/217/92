the monarchy

ONE HUNDRED and three years after the abolition of Brazil's monarchy, a
growing band of citizens wants to see a return to the days of empire.
Brazilians vote in a referendum next April on, among other things, whether
to restore the monarchy. Helped by the public outrage over the corruption
scandal surrounding President Fernando Collor and the country's stubborn 25
per cent a month inflation rate, a restoration campaign is gathering
support.
Political analysts think Brazilians are likely to vote for change, but in
favour of a parliamentary system, with the president becoming a figurehead.
However, many have been surprised by the growing support for the monarchy.
In the most recent opinion poll, 23 per cent supported the restoration,
compared to just 3 per cent a year ago.
A member of the royal family lecturing the Rio Chamber of Commerce on the
economic advantages of a monarchy received rapturous applause this month
from Rio de Janeiro businessmen as he blamed the presidential system for
inflation and corruption.
Dom Bertrand Orleans e Braganca, a more charismatic speaker than most
Brazilian politicians, spoke of the prosperity and international respect
that marked the 48-year-reign of Dom Pedro II, the second and last emperor
of Brazil - a title established in 1822 by his father, the son of the King
of Portugal, who declared Brazil independent.
Dom Bertrand was speaking for his older brother, Dom Luis, pretender to the
Brazilian throne were it to be restored. There is, however, a flaw in the
monarchists' campaign. The House of Braganca is divided: two of the
emperor's descendants claim the throne.
Dom Luis's rival is his uncle, 88-year-old Dom Pedro Gastao Orleans e
Braganca, patriarch of the House of Braganca and brother-in-law to King Juan
Carlos of Spain. Although Dom Pedro is directly in line as Dom Pedro II's
great-grandson, Dom Luis argues that Dom Pedro's grandfather gave up his
right to accession to the grandfather of Dom Luis in order to marry an
eastern European countess who was not of royal blood.
Characterised by his floppy grey Spanish hat, Dom Pedro divides his time
between Seville and Petropolis, a mountain city above Rio which was the
imperial summer capital. He has four sons and 14 grandsons, and his
supporters say that Dom Luis, who is 52 and a bachelor, is not fit to be
emperor because he has not produced an heir and has political connections.
Dom Luis is a member of an ultra-conservative Catholic organisation, Family,
Tradition and Prosperity, which he says is apolitical.
Family feuding has not hindered the move for a return to the empire.
Pro-monarchy propaganda has only been allowed since a constitutional
revision in 1989, and proponents include congressmen, prominent businessmen,
academics and even military officers. They can be spotted by tell-tale
crown-shaped lapel pins or emblems on their ties.
Much of the campaign's success is due to the achievements of Dom Pedro II.
After taking power in 1840 at the age of 14, he oversaw a rapid expansion in
the Brazilian economy, reducing dependence on sugar cane and diversifying
into rubber, coffee, tobacco and cacao. A promoter of science and education,
he was such an accomplished negotiator that US President Abraham Lincoln
apparently said he was the only man he would trust to mediate between North
and South in the American civil war.
By contrast, presidentialism has a poor record in Brazil. A leaflet produced
by the Parliamentary Movement for Monarchy (MPM) describes the republic as
'synonymous with lack of credibility of institutions' and catalogues its
progress as 'seven different constitutions, 12 states of siege, 19 military
rebellions, four deposed presidents and two long periods of dictatorship'.
It points out that, in the last 67 years, only one civilian president
finished his mandate. Mr Collor seems unlikely to improve the balance.
