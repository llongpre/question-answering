From Leicester via a national tour and the Royal Court, Sue Townsend's
comedy has passed to the West End. As you must know, both the play and the
original 'novel' are about the present royal family, imagined as reduced by
a newly republican Britain to a grim council estate in Leicester. And why
not?
Ms Townsend chooses, however, not to explore many questions. I do not mean
that she ought to have explored any of them; only that her leaving them
untouched (why has the republic treated the royals so brutally? do they
learn anything significant in their exile? do their neighbours?) restricts
her play to a simple, homely vein in a never-never land.
The time of its notional future must be just weeks away, since the royals we
meet here have done nothing newly ridiculous since the ludicrous things we
think we know about already. Though there are mischievous little sallies
about those, none is followed up, and no character develops. For the guiding
premise is only this: wouldn't it be funny if the Queen and her clan were
stuck in a council estate?
Here I should declare a disability, from birth. All Brits, one gathers,
sometimes dream about meeting the Queen (often in unlikely circumstances,
but most often over tea) - even hard-Left Brits. That suggests that she
occupies a special place in your national dream-world, somewhere far beyond
ordinary assessment. When Ms Townsend brings her on to the stage in the
Celia Johnson-ish persona of Paula Wilcox, she comes ready-made as an icon;
you can then be titillated by hints of lese-majeste, and reminders of recent
'misconduct', and by the royals' supposed incomprehension of council-estate
demotic.
Those account for nearly all the comic substance of The Queen and I; those,
and a steady dribble of knowing references. For example, Prince Philip
insists on having his tea 'in my World Wildlife Fund mug]' Ha ha. Later the
Queen remarks that she has 'never met a butcher - except Bomber Harris, of
course.' Ha ha. But I liked the stuffed but lively corgi and the baby, both
in Spitting Image style.
Thanks to television, we expect stage-royal figures to be good
impersonators. Miss Wilcox makes a shy, engaging Queen, with glints of
something shyly aggressive. There is crepitating charm from Gillian Hanna's
Queen Mum (and Crawfie); David Horovitch's Philip is a testy but kindly soul
out of sit-com, and Toby Salaman's Charles a sympathetic, full-blooded
impersonation. Lizzy McInnerney's Di looks good, though the accent is more
striving-toward-Sloane-from-below than upper-class drooping Sloanewards;
Carole Hayman's Margaret is a creature from Noel Coward's stage milieu.
Pearce Quigley is outstandingly gormless as Prince William, two other chaps
and a Mrs Newman.
Their caricatured speech betrays scarcely any common ground, so we get no
sense of an aristocracy collectively at bay in an unfamiliar real world. In
Ms Townsend's 'novels', there is something steady and unwinking behind their
cute prose surfaces. Here, that is dissipated among all the actors' turns
and the continual one-joke vignettes. But the amiability-factor is pretty
high; and if you can top it up with your own monarchical kink, you should
enjoy the show.
