'royals' as the country votes on whether to restore the monarchy

AN EIGHTY-year-old man with caterpillar eyebrows, bushy moustache and a
floppy felt hat, living in a candy pink and white palace in the mountains
above Rio de Janeiro and speaking Portuguese with a thick French accent, Dom
Pedro Gastao de Orleans e Braganca seems an unlikely threat to the Brazilian
republic. But the great grandson of the country's last emperor, together
with a radical right-wing recluse and a former surfer, is one of three
eccentric candidates campaigning for Brazilians to vote for the restoration
of the monarchy in a bizarre plebiscite on Wednesday.
Dismissed by most politicians as 'maluco' or crazy, the so-called 'royal
option' is drawing astonishing support from Brazilians fed up with a
presidential republic which has left Latin America's biggest country with
the world's worst income distribution, 1,500 per cent annual inflation and
rampant corruption.
Only one elected president has completed a mandate in the past 65 years, the
rest opting out through suicide or resignation, dying before taking office,
forced out by military coups or impeached, as in the case of the last
President Fernando Collor. By contrast, the 67-year-long monarchy, cut short
in 1889, is regarded as a golden era of stability and glory.
After a century of prohibition of monarchist politics, tell-tale gold crown
lapel pins are being sported by public figures as diverse as Paulo Protasio,
the head of Rio's Chamber of Commerce, Mario Henrique Simonsen, a
conservative former finance minister, Sandra de Sa, a left-wing folk singer
and Dona Neuma, the first lady of Rio's oldest samba school.
'It's a natural choice for a country where social groups and events such as
carnival always use 'king' to refer to something good and dignified,' says
Roberto da Matta, one of Brazil's best-known sociologists and himself a
monarchist. But the chances of Brazil reverting to its ancient title of
kingdom are being weakened by a split in the House of Braganca, the
Brazilian royal family. At the last count, there are a dozen imperial
relatives with claims on the throne and little in common except for the
Braganca name and bright blue eyes.
Of the three leading contenders, Dom Pedro is the most senior member of the
family and most direct descendant of the last emperor, Dom Pedro II. He
divides his time between Seville in Spain and Brazil's royal winter capital
of Petropolis, where he lives surrounded by oil paintings of his ancestors
in a palace that used to be the emperor's guest house. Riding horseback
along the cobbled streets, where he has long been a tourist attraction, Dom
Pedro is also a popular figure among locals, who shout 'Long live the king]'
as he passes.
'It is not that I am asking to be king but if it is my duty to save my
people then I will,' says Dom Pedro, in between complaining about the
difficulty of finding blacksmiths to shoe his English thoroughbred.
Stressing that 'a monarch should protect his people against the government,'
Dom Pedro refers to his nephew, Spain's King Juan Carlos, as providing who
an 'extraordinary example'.
Dom Pedro denies that monarchy would be a step back, asking: 'Is there a
greater example of modernity than Japan, one of the most traditional
monarchies in the world?' But his claim is jeopardised by the fact that his
father renounced his rights to the then-defunct throne in 1908 in order to
marry a Czech countess of non-royal lineage.
His most serious rival is his cousin, 54-year-old Dom Luiz, whom Dom Pedro
describes as 'a crazy fanatic who thinks going to the beach is a sin.' The
oldest of 12 brothers, Dom Luiz is a member of a right-wing militant group
called Tradition, Family, Property, which allegedly lit candles in support
of military dictatorships in the 1960s and '70s.
Although he ventures rarely from his modest apartment in Sao Paulo, Dom Luiz
promises to break his vow of chastity and marry 'if it is necessary to
produce heirs.' His eloquent lawyer brother, Dom Bertrand, who acts as his
spokesman, says: 'The republic has brought nothing but political chaos and
economic decadence. Under the monarchy, we were a first-world country with
the world's second telephone and postage systems.'
He claims that monarchy would be a cheap option for Brazil, and says: 'The
running of (Britain's) Buckingham Palace costs only 20 per cent of Brazil's
presidential palace running costs.'
The most active candidate is 38-year-old Dom Joao Henrique, Dom Pedro's
favourite nephew. Known as Little Prince Johnny, the glamorous former beach
bum has swapped his surfing gear for European suits, and riding the waves of
Bali for a hectic programme of talk shows and speeches. A regular figure in
Rio's social columns, Dom Joao runs a hotel, the prince's guesthouse, and is
a leading environmental photographer.
Surrounded by royal memorabilia in his rented sea-front flat, where ancient
leather-bound tomes jostle with modern art and jazz books, Dom Joao argues:
'The system is totally rotten. Even if you put an honest man in the
presidency, it will not work because the president is elected and prisoner
of political parties and economic interest groups. A king, by contrast, is
impartial.'
He adds: 'Restoring the monarchy will not achieve immediate miracles, such
as reducing inflation or making food appear in the mouths of the hungry
millions, but at least it would give stabilisation.'
Were the royal option to prevail in the plebiscite, it would be left to the
nation's congress to decide on who should be crowned - and it is there that
Dom Joao's chance lies. Several political parties have already asked him to
run for senator or congressman. But the mere fact that a big industrial
country should, in the 1990s, even be contemplating restoring a monarchy
that was unseated more than a century ago reflects tremendous disillusion
with the present system.
Public disgruntlement has increased in recent months as those named in the
Collorgate corruption scandal continue to stay free to enjoy their wealth,
Meanwhile, the new president, Itamar Franco, has got through a record three
finance ministers in six months.
With so many other problems to tackle, and a largely illiterate population,
the farcical nature of the plebiscite was highlighted by an poll last week
which found that 52 per cent of those questioned did not understand what
they were voting for. Apart from choosing between monarchy and
republicanism, Brazil's 90m voters must also decide between
parliamentarianism and presidentialism, begging the question of what would
happen if they vote for both presidentialism and monarchy. The level of
confusion is illustrated by Marcia, the cleaner of the Financial Times'
Brazil office, who says: 'I am going to vote for the king as president.'
