  [Text] Durban Feb 17 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini 
would not be prevented from promulgating a constitution for his 
kingdom, despite it being an unprecedented act, a kwaZulu 
government spokesman said on Thursday [17 February]. "It is 
unfortunate that we have been so subdued by apartheid that we 
think we can do nothing that has not been done before. This is 
slave mentality," said a statement from kwaZulu Deputy Minister 
of Works Velaphi Ndolvu. "That no other king in the world has 
promulgated the constitution of his kingdom, if this is true, 
will not prevent the king of the Zulus from promulgating the 
constitution," he said. 
  The monarch said on Monday he was preparing to promulgate a 
constitution for a sovereign kwaZulu and Natal kingdom, but 
declined to elaborate at a later media briefing. 
  Mr Ndlovu's remarks were in response to various African 
National Congress statements on the king's demands. On 
allegations the king was an IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
mouthpiece, Mr Ndlovu said these were was based on the fact that 
kwaZulu Chief Minister and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
regularly accompanied the monarch at public functions. "The 
people of South Africa must accept once and for all that Dr M B 
Buthelezi is the traditional prime minister to the king and when 
he appears with the king he does so as both prime minister and 
chief minister and not as president of the IFP." 
  Mr Ndlovu further rejected charges that the king had 
intervened in South Africa's constitutional impasse on behalf of 
the Freedom Alliance. He said King Zwelithini had made a demand 
for the return of his land and the recognition of the "kwaZulu 
kingdom" as a sovereign state as far back as in July last year, 
at his imbizo (traditional gathering) at the FNB Stadium outside 
Johannesburg. The king's demand for the "reinstatement of the 
kwaZulu kingdom emanated form the king himself and not from the 
Freedom Alliance". 
  To allege the king was being used by the IFP was an insult, 
said Mr Ndlovu. "It is the IFP which has supported his majesty 
and not the other way around." 
  The king was genuinely concerned about all Zulus, no matter 
what their political affiliation, and had never expressed 
himself in favour of the IFP with regard to violence, Mr Ndlovu 
added.
