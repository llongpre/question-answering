   King Birendra proposed Friday a
constitutional reform commission be set up and that monarchy be
institutionalized in Nepal along with a multiparty democracy.
   The move drew fire from the Nepali Congress Party, which led a
movement that forced Birendra to accept democratic changes in the
Himalayan kingdom and on April 6 propelled to power an interim
government made up of pro-democracy forces.
   Party General Secretary G.P. Koirala said, ``We are for a new
constitution. A reformed constitution is out of question.''
   Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai said the king did not
consult him _``It was a surprise.''
   A statement from the royal palace said the proposed commission
would have seven members, with Supreme Court Chief Justice
Biswanbath Upadhyay as chief. ``The constitutional commission will
make recommendations institutionalizing constitutional monarchy and
the multiparty democracy in the interest of Nepal and the well
being of the Nepalese people,'' it said.
   On April 6, police fired into a crowd of pro-democracy activists
marching to the palace, and witnesses said at least 200 people were
killed.
   The outcry forced Birendra to lift a 29-year-old ban on
political parties, dismiss a rubber-stamp government and disband a
partyless system of government known as the Panchayat.
   Nepali Congress is the largest group in the interim coalition
government. A seven-party United Left Front, two independents and
two Birendra nominees complete the Cabinet.
   Bhattarai's government took office April 19, ending 29 years of
rule by the monarch and the Panchayat.
