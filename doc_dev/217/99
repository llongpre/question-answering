  [Text] Pretoria Feb 22 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini on Tuesday told President F W de Klerk he was not 
dependent on multiparty approval for the recognition of a 
sovereign Zulu kingdom. He was "simply claiming it". He said 
he and his people would resist the election, which was being 
forced on them. 
  Addressing Mr de Klerk at the start of their meeting in 
Pretoria, the king said the impasse between the government and 
kwaZulu had begun when Mr de Klerk had pandered to the African 
National Congress and had ignored the call for a delegation from 
the Zulu monarchy to be included in the multiparty talks. 
  In a copy of his remarks sent to SAPA, King Zwelethini said 
furthermore that the Zulu people would not be satisfied with the 
area north of the Tugela River, as had been suggested by some 
analysts. The Tugela boundary between what was Natal and the old 
Zululand was established by colonialism and not by history. 
Great Zulu generals of the past and some of the larger Zulu 
clans had come from south of the river. "In fact...our great 
founding king, King Shaka...lies buried south of the Tugela. 
Most of my subjects live in the area south of the Tugela." 
  King Goodwill said any constitutional clauses, "any interim 
authority and any legislation which denies the reality of the 
Zulu kingdom is for me not worth the paper it is written on". 
The interim constitution did not even allow even for "a kind of 
homeguard" to protect the Zulu kingdom's integrity, and the 
"vaunted powers of provinces" were "glorified municipal powers". 
  "This we will not accept." 
  The king said he was not waiting until after the elections 
to 
clarify issues that were impeding the emergence of a sovereign 
Zulu kingdom. "The only thing we can talk about, Mr. President, 
is how the Zulu kingdom will be relating to the new South Africa 
which will emerge from the politics of people elsewhere." 
  He said their talks should be about how the administrative 
structures of the Zulu kingdom and South Africa could be 
mutually beneficial, how to rationalise them and how to remould 
them into what they should be. "My father's people will resist 
the election which you and political South Africa are attempting 
to force on us. 
  "It will be folly in the extreme to think that the election 
tank and the constitutional tank of the World Trade Centre 
and...parliament can roll over and flatten opposition to 
constitutional developments now taking place. 
  "I am not dependent on any multiparty approval for the 
recognition of the sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom. I am simply 
claiming it." 
  An earlier statement by a government spokesman said the 
necessity of assuring the proper recognition and constitutional 
accommodation of King Goodwill and the kwaZulu kingdom had been 
discussed at the meeting. The spokesman said after the 
three-hour meeting the two sides had agreed to extend the 
mandate of their joint working group to give urgent 
consideration to all aspects of this question and to report back 
as soon as possible. 
  Mr de Klerk was accompanied by ministers and senior 
officials. King Goodwill was accompanied by Inkatha Freedom 
Party President and kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
and members of the kwaZulu royal family.
