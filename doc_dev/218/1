   The New York Post hired Jane Amsterdam as editor, the top news position. 

   Ms. Amsterdam, an editor with book publisher Alfred A. Knopf Inc., will succeed Frank Devine, New York Post Co. officials confirmed privately. 
The Post didn't comment on Mr. Devine's plans, but several reporters said it was their understanding he would stay on for a time to assist in the transition. 

   The paper, which New York real estate developer Peter Kalikow purchased earlier this year from Rupert Murdoch, is expected to announce the change today. 
The Post courted Ms. Amsterdam, who is expected to take over in mid-June, for several weeks. 
Mr. Kalikow wants to create a new image to counter the tabloid's sensationalist image; Ms. Amsterdam's experience as an editor and reporter has been with such publications as New York magazine, the Washington Post, and Manhattan inc. magazine. 

   Mr. Kalikow and Post publisher Peter O. Price have made only minor changes since they came aboard in March, but Mr. Kalikow has said he would like the paper to appeal to a more upscale audience. 
In its last months under Mr. Murdoch's ownership, the Post sustained steep declines in circulation and advertising, but the paper says it has regained about 15% of the lost ad revenue. 
Circulation has increased to 630,000 from 465,000 since the sale. 
At the time of the ownership change, Mr. Kalikow and other Post officials had indicated Mr. Devine would remain on board for a considerable time to come. 

   Neither Ms. Amsterdam nor Mr. Devine could be reached for comment. 

   Ms. Amsterdam is best known as the original editor of Manhattan inc., a New York business magazine started in 1984 that has won several awards for editorial excellence. 
The magazine, considered one of the more successful start-ups in recent years, attracted wide readership among the city's business elite. 
Ms. Amsterdam left the magazine last year after a dispute with its owner, Herbert Lipson. 

   Ms. Amsterdam "comes with credentials that will reinforce us in a variety of areas," Mr. Price said last week, confirming the Post was wooing her. 
"Above all, she understands how New York City works. 
That's her most impressive credential."
