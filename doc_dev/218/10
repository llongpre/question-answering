   Jerry Nachman, a columnist for the New York Post
and a veteran of the city's media wars, was named the newspaper's
editor Wednesday.
   Nachman, 43, spent most of his career in broadcast journalism
before joining the Post as a columnist early last year.
   He succeeds Jane Amsterdam, who was relieved of her duties
Tuesday by Post owner and publisher Peter Kalikow after 50 weeks in
the position, Kalikow said in a statement.
   Nachman will be a vice president of the New York Post Co. and is
expected to be elected to the newspaper's board of directors, the
statement said.
   Before joining the Post, the New York native was general manager
of the NBC-owned television station in Washington, news director of
WNBC-TV, vice president for news for the NBC-owned stations and a
reporter for WCBS-TV and WCBS-AM.
   Nachman worked for newspapers in Ohio before returning to New
York and beginning his broadcast career.
   Ms. Amsterdam's departure, according to Post spokesman Howard
Rubenstein, was brought on not by any specific problem but by
Kalikow's desire to ``take the Post to the next level.''
