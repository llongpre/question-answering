   On Feb. 15, 1986, the Amsterdam News printed a
front-page editorial calling upon Mayor Edward I. Koch to resign.
   Koch ignored it.
   He also ignored the next week's editorial, and the one after
that. He has now ignored 110 consecutive editorials on the front
page of New York's oldest black newspaper, each broadside demanding
that he leave office.
   The Amsterdam's weekly diatribe has become as much a part of New
York's clockwork as Billy Martin's hiring and firing as Yankee
manager, as the daily ebb and flow of commuters, as
alternate-side-of-the-street parking.
   ``Mr. Koch is incredible. Every week he gives me something new,
something outrageous, something wrong'' to write about, says
Wilbert A. Tatum, author of the editorials and editor-in-chief of
the 40,000-circulation weekly.
   While the Amsterdam News generally comes down on the left side
of the political spectrum, it is considered the establishment black
newspaper, less radical than some others published in the city.
   Tatum has written anti-Koch editorials while traveling in
Zimbabwe, Sweden, Britain, Ethiopia. He has focused on corruption,
racial tensions, homelessness _ all of them blamed on the ``weak
and fading'' Koch.
   Koch is ``mean-spirited and vindictive,'' Tatum wrote (March 8,
1986). He ``postures, preens and pontificates as he poses and
pretends to be mayor of all the people of New York City,'' Tatum
declared (Jan. 3, 1987).
   ``Certainly the business and social leadership in this town must
realize that this city is going to hell in a basket under the
leadership of Koch. How long will this outrage be allowed to
continue?'' he asked (Dec. 6, 1986).
   Koch plays it cool. ``The mayor's not commenting. He's just
going to let Tatum have his say,'' said a Koch spokesman, Larry
Simonberg.
   But in the course of a letter to the editor of the Amsterdam
News, written earlier this year, Koch mentioned the newspaper's
``incoherent diatribes against me each week `written' by a
non-journalist.''
   The first editorial was occasioned by the start of corruption
scandals just months after Koch's overwhelming re-election to a
third term.
   Tatum, along with much of the rest of the black community,
already had a difficult relationship with Koch. They had repeatedly
accused him of insensitivity to the poor and minorities; in 1984,
Tatum debated the mayor on the radio in a confrontation that
generated more heat than light.
   But Tatum said he was so shocked by the scandals that he was
forced to take a stand on the front page. When Koch was still mayor
a week later, he wrote another editorial, and resolved to keep
writing them until Koch left office. He said he did not think he
would still be doing it 109 issues later.
   ``I thought it would take three weeks for the Times, the News
and the Post to realize there was a real danger of what would
happen to this city due to the polarizing tactics of the present
mayor,'' Tatum said.
   Tatum is saddened by the failure of the city's major dailies to
join him; he speculates that the ``awesome power'' of the mayor has
something to do with it, alluding darkly to tax abatements, city
contracts and the like.
   Though the common wisdom is that Koch is safely ensconced in
City Hall, Tatum is convinced that he is making headway. He says
the citywide papers seem to be edging his way; he says he is often
accosted by people of all races who say, ``Keep it up.''
   He writes his editorials each Wednesday at 5 a.m., 2{ hours
before his deadline. ``I am not able to do other things like this.
... I type it myself and it's done in a matter of minutes. It's
that powerful.''
   He intends to keep at it. ``I can't allow any fool to destroy
what little relationships remain between the people of this city,''
he says.
   How long will he do it? ``For as long as it takes,'' he says.
