Columnist Jerry Nachman has been named editor of the New York Post, replacing 
Jane Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
Nachman, 43, also was made vice president of the New York Post Co. and was 
expected to be elected to the newspaper's board, owner Peter Kalikow said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-year veteran of the news business, Nachman became a Post columnist in 
early 1988 after spending most of his career in broadcasting in New York, San 
Francisco and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Kalikow announced Tuesday that he was relieving Amsterdam of her duties after a 
year on the job, praising her work but saying the tabloid "has new heights to 
achieve to assure its future strength and success." 
</P>
<P>
Amsterdam departed with the reduction of the Post's new Sunday edition, whose 
originator, Peter Price, resigned earlier as publisher.
