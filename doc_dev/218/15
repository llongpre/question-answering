   Jane Amsterdam, editor of Manhattan inc. until she resigned in a dispute, was named a senior editor at Alfred A. Knopf Inc. 

   Ms. Amsterdam, 36 years old, was founding editor of the Manhattan business monthly. 
She and two top staffers quit in March following a dispute with D. Herbert Lipson, the magazine's owner and publisher. 

   Manhattan inc. is published by Manhattan Magazine Inc., which in turn is a subsidiary of Metrocorp., Philadelphia. 

   In her post at Knopf, effective in January, she will concentrate on general nonfiction and contemporary affairs, according to A.S. Mehta, Knopf's president and editor in chief.
