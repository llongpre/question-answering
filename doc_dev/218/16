<HEAD>Trump Lays Into Kalikow, NY Post; Cries, `Rupert, Come Back!'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A laughing Donald Trump accused New York Post
publisher Peter Kalikow on Thursday of beating up on him in the
newspaper, persuading Trump to buy advertising while his reporters
write unflattering stories.
   ``You son of a gun, you're killing me,'' Trump said at a
breakfast at the Republican National Convention. ``Rupert, come
back!''
   Trump was called to the microphone by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who
was being honored by the New York GOP delegation. Kalikow, who
bought the financially ailing paper in March from publisher Rupert
Murdoch, was sitting nearby.
   When Trump launched into a comical monologue about the Post,
aiming his comments at Kalikow, he sounded half-serious. Kalikow
laughed but looked uncomfortable.
   Post editor Jane Amsterdam said Trump had not tried to
strong-arm the Post into going easier on him.
   ``I don't think the Post can be muscled,'' she said from New
York City. ``He's entitled to react to the New York Post any way he
wants to. The Post is fair and it's tough and it's generally very
good. ... And he's a big boy.''
