   The editor of Manhattan, inc. magazine and two top staffers resigned yesterday after disputes with the magazine's owner and publisher, D. Herbert Lipson. 

   A spokeswoman for Jane Amsterdam, editor since the monthly's launch 2 1/2 years ago, said Ms. Amsterdam resigned along with the managing editor, Duncan Stalker, and the art director, Nancy Butkus. 

   None of the three could be reached for comment, and the spokeswoman declined to elaborate. 
But Ron Javers, vice president of Mr. Lipson's company, Metrocorp, said, "It was really a clash of management styles between Jane Amsterdam and Herbert Lipson." 
He also declined to elaborate, and he said successors would be named shortly. 

   Mr. Lipson is a big player in the city magazine business. 
He owns Philadelphia and Boston magazines and recently acquired Atlanta magazine. 

   Manhattan, inc. is considered among the more successful new city business publications. 
The magazine has won a number of editorial awards, including a 1985 National Magazine Award, and has had a steady growth in advertising revenue, according to Media Industry Newsletter's editor, Steven Cohn. 
The magazine's advertising revenue is currently up 11% from last year's level. 

   "It's been going great guns from the start," Mr. Cohn said, adding that the news of Ms. Amsterdam's departure "is very surprising."
