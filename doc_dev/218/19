   John Canning, managing editor of the New York
Post since 1980 and a journalist for more than 35 years, died while
on vacation in Ixtapa, Mexico. He was 56.
   Friends said Canning died Sunday of complications from a bleeding
ulcer after suffering a heart attack in his hotel room, according to
Eric Fettmann, assistant city editor.
   Canning was on vacation with his wife and another couple.
   Canning got his start in journalism in his native New Zealand. In
1955, he moved to Australia and worked for the Sydney Sun before
joining Rupert Murdoch's Sydney Daily Mirror in the 1960s.
   Canning was named editor of the Daily Mirror in 1978 but before
the appointment took effect he was sent to New York temporarily to
work on Murdoch papers and wound up staying here. He was named
managing editor of the weekly tabloid The Star before taking the
same position at the Post in 1980.
   The Post was sold to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow
earlier this year.
   ``John Canning was a great editor and beloved friend to all of
us,'' said New York Post Editor Jane Amsterdam. ``His contribution
to this paper was enormous. John's intelligence and wit were
displayed to our readers each day on the front page. He will be
sorely missed.''
   As managing editor, Canning's major responsibility was designing
the paper's daily front page.
   Canning, who lived in Guttenberg, N.J., is survived by his wife,
Odette, and by a son, Simon, from a previous marriage.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.
