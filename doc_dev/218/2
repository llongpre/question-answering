<HL> New York Post Considers Amsterdam for Senior Job </HL>

   Jane Amsterdam, a magazine and book editor best known for her work at Manhattan inc. magazine, is being considered for a senior position at the New York Post. 

   Post Publisher Peter O. Price said he has talked with Ms. Amsterdam in recent weeks about a number of jobs, but he declined to be more specific. 
A source, however, said Ms. Amsterdam would be a candidate for the editor's job, the top news position, held by Frank Devine. 

   The Post's talks with Ms. Amsterdam are a further indication that Peter Kalikow, the paper's new owner, wants to change its image as one of the country's most sensationalistic daily tabloids. 
Mr. Kalikow purchased the Post earlier this year from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ms. Amsterdam had been editor of Manhattan inc. magazine since its founding in 1984; she resigned in March 1987 after a dispute with its owner and publisher, D. Herbert Lipton. 
The magazine is considered among the more successful city business publications and has won a number of editorial awards. 

   Last November, Alfred A. Knopf Inc., the book publisher, named Ms. Amsterdam a senior editor. 
She also has worked at New York magazine, another weekly city publication, and the Washington Post. 
Ms. Amsterdam declined to comment.
