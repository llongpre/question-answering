   The new owner of the New York Post spent Sunday
talking with advisers about how to improve the prospects for
survival of the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper, his spokesman said.
   One Post employee called it ``the $22 million question'' _
whether multimillionaire businessman Peter Kalikow, aided by
financial concessions by the Post's unions, will be able to stem
the tabloid's flow of red ink.
   Equally intriguing was whether the real estate developer would
tone down a sometimes sensationalistic style of journalism that has
titillated, outraged, amused and generally entertained readers for
more than a decade.
   Kalikow will take over the Post for $37.6 million on March 7,
pending rank-and-file ratification of the concessions and
verification by his accountants of the details.
   The sale of the paper by owner Rupert Murdoch cleared its final
hurdle early Saturday when leaders of the newspaper's 10 unions
agreed to the $22 million in concessions to keep it alive. Union
members were expected to ratify the agreements this week.
   Now Kalikow has to do is figure out how to turn around one of
the biggest money losers in the newspaper business.
   The Post lost about $17 million before taxes last year, and
about a quarter of its advertising in the last few months.
   Its circulation has dropped from 700,000 to 500,000, partly
because of a retrenchment in areas outside metropolitan New York.
   Kalikow spent the day talking to advisers about ways to improve
the Post's prospects, according to Howard J. Rubenstein, his
spokesman.
   The 45-year-old businessman, estimated to be worth about $500
million, has approved a $2 million promotional campaign for the
newspaper and is scheduling luncheon meetings with leading
advertisers and community and business leaders, Rubenstein said. He
also plans meetings with Mayor Edward I. Koch and Gov. Mario Cuomo
to discuss his plans for the Post.
   Despite Kalikow's many other business interests, ``He's going to
be a very active owner,'' Rubenstein said.
   Under his contract with Murdoch, Kalikow promised to operate the
paper for at least one year.
   Rubenstein said Kalikow was considering making the Post strictly
a morning paper, and denied that Kalikow was leaning toward an
afternoon-only paper with a smaller circulation and a higher price.
   Despite its down-scale reputation, a $1 million marketing study
commissioned by Kalikow ``shows the paper already appeals to a
fairly well-to-do audience,'' Rubenstein said.
   Kalikow is widely thought to want to back away from the paper's
emphasis on stories of sex, crime and scandal. The Post will remain
a tabloid, but ``there will be a change in format,'' Rubenstein
said. ``There'll be changes in headlines, in the front page, in the
emphasis of the paper.''
   But, Rubenstein added, the paper's new owner ``still wants it to
be feisty and provocative.''
   The specifics, he said, were being worked out by Kalikow and
Frank Devine, who is staying on as executive editor.
