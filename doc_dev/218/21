   The publisher of TV Guide, Valerie B. Salembier,
has been named president of the New York Post, Post owner Peter S.
Kalikow said Wednesday.
   Peter Price quit as publisher to become a partner in an
international television and radio company, Kalikow said Monday.
Kalikow, who bought the money-losing paper a year ago from Rupert
Murdoch, noted that during Price's tenure the paper added a Sunday
edition.
   Ms. Salembier, a former senior vice president of advertising at
USA Today, will assume Price's responsibilities, said Emory
Edwards, a spokesman for the Post. She will supervise business,
advertising and circulation.
   Ms. Salembier takes over Kalikow's former title of president,
while Kalikow assumes the title of publisher and retains his
position as chairman of the board, Edwards said.
   Ms. Salembier, 43, became publisher of TV Guide in October when
the magazine was acquired by the News Corporation of America.
   ``I am thrilled with the opportunity to go back into the daily
newspaper business,'' Ms. Salembier said in a statement. ``The
potential for growth at the Post is terrific, and it's the perfect
vehicle for a great many new advertisers.''
