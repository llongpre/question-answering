   The New York Post has officially become the
property of real estate developer Peter Kalikow, who paid $37.6
million for the tabloid that has been losing money and circulation
for years.
   ``It is my intention to stop the financial losses of the New
York Post,'' Kalikow said Monday in a statement after the papers
transferring ownership were signed. ``The paper will be a winner
financially and editorially.''
   Kalikow acquired the Post after the paper's 10 unions agreed to
a $22 million in concessions, which included a last-minute $3
million gift from then-owner Rupert Murdoch.
   ``The rescue of the Post is nothing less than an historic
moment,'' Kalikow said.
   ``There was not one person involved in negotiations that did not
go the extra mile in an effort to keep this great New York
institution from disappearing. I want to thank all of our unions
and employees for their heroic efforts.''
   Union leaders were to sign formal papers today and planned to
meet with Kalikow on Thursday to ``get to know each other,'' said
George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council,
which represents eight of the unions.
   ``We're delighted, really delighted, glad it's all over.''
   Murdoch, who sold the paper to comply with federal regulations
barring ownership of two media outlets in one city, claimed he was
losing $100,000 a day on the Post and lost $150 million in the 12
years he owned it.
   Kalikow has pledged $2 million to promote the newspaper.
   ``I am committed to expanding its readership base through
millions of dollars in promotion, adding features to the paper,
greatly expanding its investigative reporting and strengthening its
advertising revenues to make the paper profitable on a long-term
basis.''
   Under Murdoch, whom Kalikow called ``one of the great
contemporary publishers,'' the tabloid had a reputation for
sensational coverage, with blaring headlines and plenty of gossip.
   New publisher Peter Price said ``my role is to make it work.
   ``I think Peter Kalikow has made an enormous financial
commitment and it's my challenge and opportunity to put the pieces
together and make a real business out of the Post and not just a
good newspaper,'' Price said.
   Spokesman Howard Rubenstein declined to say what specific
changes Kalikow and Price would make in the appearance and content
of the Post, the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper, founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton.
   Price, however, noted that ``the big difference between what we
are able to do versus what others before us have tried to do is
that Peter Kalikow and I share a sense of the city.
   ``We are both single-minded about the New York Post. We are both
single-minded about making this paper a permanent fixture in the
New York City scene.''
