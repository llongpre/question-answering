   Publisher Peter Price has left the New York Post
just one year after joining a team that saved the morning tabloid
from the threat of closure.
   The paper's owner, real estate developer Peter Kalikow, said
Monday he accepted the resignation ``with regret'' and was taking
over the duties of publisher. A spokesman wouldn't say how long
Kalikow planned to serve as published.
   Price said he would be forming a partnership with Univisa, an
international company that produces and distributes television and
radio programming.
   Kalikow named Price as publisher last year after buying the
morning tabloid from Rupert Murdoch, saving the money-losing paper
from closing.
   Price said he was leaving the Post in good shape. The paper
started a Sunday edition last month.
   ``The financial losses have been stemmed and the paper should be
profitable by the end of 1989,'' Price said in a statement. ``Daily
circulation has increased by over 100,000 since the paper was
acquired'' and advertising linage is up.
   Kalikow said Price ``played a key role in taking a nearly
defunct afternoon newspaper with a circulation that had dropped as
low as 2 million a week and bringing it back to a strong newspaper
with a Sunday edition and a weekly circulation of over 4 million.''
   Price joined Time Inc. in 1965 and rose to assistant to the
publisher of Life magazine, circulation manager of Sports
Illustrated and director of corporate development for Time Inc. He
created the upscale Manhattan magazine Avenue in 1976.
