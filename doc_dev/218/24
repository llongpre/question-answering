<HEAD>Price Quits New York Post To Join TV-Radio Company</HEAD>

   New York Post Publisher Peter Price said Monday
he has quit the morning tabloid to become a partner in an
international television and radio company.
   The move came one year after the Post was saved from a
threatened closing, when real estate developer Peter Kalikow bought
it from Rupert Murdoch and named Price publisher. Four weeks ago
the paper began a Sunday edition.
   Kalikow said in a statement that he accepted the resignation
``with regret'' and said he would immediately assume the duties of
publisher, but a spokesman would not say whether that move was
permanent.
   Kalikow said Price ``did a fantastic job and played a key role
in taking a nearly defunct afternoon newspaper with a circulation
that had dropped as low as 2 million a week and bringing it back to
a strong newspaper with a Sunday edition and a weekly circulation
of over 4 million.''
   Price, who created the upscale Manhattan magazine Avenue, said
he would be forming a partnership with Univisa, an international
company that produces and distributes television and radio
programming.
   ``I have been in the communications business for most of my
professional life,'' his statement said. ``This opportunity will
allow me as a partner in the enterprise to explore a range of new
media ventures.''
   Univisa is the American sister company of Televisa, a Mexico
City-based conglomerate with wide business holdings. It is
privately held and has estimated revenues of more than $600 million
annually, the statement said.
   Price said he was leaving the Post in good shape.
   ``The financial losses have been stemmed and the paper should be
profitable by the end of 1989,'' his statement said. ``Daily
circulation has increased by over 100,000 since the paper was
acquired'' and advertising linage is up.
   Price, a graduate of Princeton University and Yale University's
law school, joined Time Inc. in 1965 and rose to become assistant
to the publisher of Life magazine, circulation manager of Sports
Illustrated and director of corporate development for Time Inc.
   From 1970 to 1976, he and partners formed Media Networks, which
provided advertising services to newspapers, magazines and cable TV
companies.
