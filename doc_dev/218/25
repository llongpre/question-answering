   The New York Post, the nation's oldest
continuously published daily newspaper, announced Tuesday it would
start a Sunday edition, just months after it narrowly averted
extinction.
   The tabloid newspaper is to begin a Sunday edition March 5. It
will sell for $1.
   Plans to launch it came after ``repeated requests and offers of
support from our major advertisers and dealers,'' said Peter S.
Kalikow, who bought the Post from Rupert Murdoch in March.
   Kalikow also predicted the Post, after years of losing money,
would begin to show a profit sometime next year. Current losses are
``in a range that are acceptable to me,'' he said, but declined to
provide specifics.
   Kalikow, a real-estate development millionaire, said he would
invest $25 million in the new Sunday edition next year and increase
the paper's staff by about 60 people, including 30 reporters and
editors. He said he expected an initial press run of 500,000 copies
per Sunday.
   The Post was on the verge of ceasing publication until Kalikow
and Murdoch, its owner since 1976, negotiated major concessions and
buyouts from the paper's unions.
   Union reaction to the Sunday edition was favorable, said Tom
Pennacchio, secretary treasurer of the Newspaper Guild, which
represents the Post's editorial staff.
   Although New Yorkers already have their choice of The New York
Times, the Daily News and New York Newsday on Sundays, Kalikow and
Post Publisher Peter Price say there is room for another. The Sunday
Times sells for $1.25 while the Daily News and Newsday sell for $1.
   Kalikow said the Post's losses were a ``minor fraction'' of the
$650,000 per week the tabloid was losing when he purchased it from
Murdoch and that advertising was expanding. Average daily
circulation was about 600,000 during October, he said.
   Eric Philo, an analyst who follows the newspaper industry for the
investment firm Goldman, Sachs, said he didn't see a place in the
city's highly competitive newspaper market for another Sunday paper
and predicted it would only increase the financial drain on the Post.
