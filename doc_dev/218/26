   The New York Post says it will intensify New
York's heated newspaper competition by launching a Sunday edition.
   The owner of the spirited morning tabloid that came close to
extinction earlier this year said Tuesday he wants to compete seven
days a week with The New York Times, the Daily News and Newsday.
   The Sunday edition, complete with color comics and a magazine
supplement, is scheduled to make its debut March 5 and sell for $1.
   The decision for the project came after ``repeated requests and
offers of support from our major advertisers and dealers,'' Post
owner Peter S. Kalikow said.
   The millionaire real estate developer also predicted that the
Post, after years of losses, would show a profit next year.
   Current losses are ``a minor fraction'' of the ``$650,000 a week
when we bought the paper last March'' from Rupert Murdoch, he said
at a news conference. He declined to provide specific numbers.
   Kalikow said he would invest $25 million in the Sunday edition
and increase the paper's staff by about 60, including 30 reporters
and editors.
   An initial press run of 500,000 copies was expected, he said.
   Newspaper analyst John Morton called it a ``bold move, but one I
think they had to make if they want to make the Post a viable
enterprise.''
   ``In successful newspapers _ which the Post is not _ Sunday
papers account for 40 to 50 percent of revenue,'' he said. The
danger is that advertisers won't increase their Post advertising
budgets, but spread them thinner to cover an additional day, he said.
   However, Eric Philo, an analyst for the investment firm Goldman,
Sachs, said he didn't see a place for another Sunday paper in New
York and predicted it only would increase the financial drain on the
Post.
   Union reaction was favorable.
   ``I get the impression that (Kalikow's) here to stay over the
long haul,'' said Tom Pennacchio, secretary treasurer of the
Newspaper Guild, which represents the Post's editorial staff.
   Pennacchio said he earlier joined others in believing Kalikow was
more interested in the Post's valuable lower Manhattan property than
the paper itself.
   The Post, the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper, was on the verge of ceasing publication when Kalikow and
Murdoch negotiated major concessions and buyouts from the paper's
unions.
   Since then, Kalikow said, ``Both the financial as well as the
editorial aspects of the paper have improved far beyond our
expectations, and therefore we've moved up the Sunday publication
from a date some time in our original plans of 1991 to 1989.''
