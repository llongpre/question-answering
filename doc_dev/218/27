   The scrappy New York Post, colorful chronicler
of a troubled city, survived its own brush with extinction Monday
after its biggest union agreed to concessions to save the publisher
money.
   Members of the Newspaper Guild, representing 350 editorial,
advertising and clerical employees, voted 242-45 to approve
concessions including eliminating dozens of jobs and cutting the
workweek to four days with a 20 percent pay cut. A last-minute
sweetener offered by Publisher Peter S. Kalikow would boost
severence pay for those who agree to resign.
   Kalikow had said he would close the nation's oldest continuously
published daily and put nearly 1,000 people out of work if the
Guild rejected the offer.
   ``Let's go to press,'' Kalikow said after the vote.
   ``This is not a management victory,'' he added. ``It is not a
labor victory. It is a victory for all New Yorkers who deserve the
honesty and diversity offered in the pages of the New York Post.''
   The Guild was the last of the paper's 11 unions to reach
agreement with Kalikow on a total package of $27 million in cost
cuts.
   The vote followed a 90-minute meeting punctuated by boos,
applause, and speeches.
   ``You feel like the executioner has loosened the noose,'' said
Jill Brooke, who reports on TV and radio issues. ``But we still
have a life sentence: a 20 percent pay cut.''
   ``We accepted a package that none of us liked, we accepted a
package that made no sense to any of us and we accepted a package
that makes us less than middle class,'' said reporter Peter Moses,
who nonetheless voted for approval. ``We went from the outhouse to
the tree.''
   Editor Jerry Nachman said he was overwhelmed by gratitude.
   ``They have taken a great sacrifice in order to preserve their
careers in New York journalism, their colleagues' careers and an
important New York institution,'' Nachman said.
   Union members said sentiment swung in favor of the plan Monday
afternoon when Kalikow offered to ``buy out'' those who agreed to
resign. The publisher said employees could approve the plan, then
resign by Wednesday night and receive the same termination and
severance pay as if the paper were shut down.
   Some employees had argued earlier that they might be better off
voting against the deal and taking the severance and termination
money that would come with the newspaper folding.
   ``That takes away the principal reason for a no vote,''
metropolitan editor John Cotter said of the sweetened offer before
Monday night's meeting.
   Theodore Kheel, an adviser to the unions, also said the Post
would not stick to its requirement that 43 jobs be severed, but
would settle for whatever number of resignations were forthcoming.
   At a news conference after the vote, Guild president Barry
Lipton said he didn't know how many would resign.
   Kalikow also has promised the unions 20 percent of the company's
stock and a representative on the board of directors.
   Kalikow said he had to have the union concessions to cut back on
losses now running at about $27 million on an annual basis. He is
believed to have lost more than $100 million personally on the
paper.
   By Friday night, negotiators for the Post's 10 other unions had
reached agreement with the company. The Guild's negotiating
committee rejected Kalikow's offer 7-3, but local president Barry
Lipton endorsed it and had it put up to a vote of the members.
   The package includes about $19 million in union concessions and
$8 million in other cost reductions, including management wage
cuts.
   Monday's front page asked: ``WILL THE POST PRESSES EVER RUN
AGAIN?''
   On the street before the vote, New Yorkers thought about life
without the city's feistiest tabloid.
   ``I love the Post. I don't like to see it go,'' said Joseph
Yedid. But he sympathized with Kalikow: ``This is New York. You
always look out for your own interests.''
   The Post was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton and a group
of merchants. The paper had money troubles from the start, but its
fortunes seemed to have dimmed for good in the 1970's as much of
its audience moved to the suburbs.
   Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch took over in 1976 and
transformed the Post from a liberal into a politically conservative
tabloid, albeit one that featured sexy pictures, racy headlines -
like the famous ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' - and lots of
crime stories.
   Murdoch said the paper lost $150 million before he sold it in
1988 for $37 million to Kalikow, a real estate developer who also
acquired the paper's valuable waterfront land on South Street in
lower Manhattan.
   Under Kalikow, the paper has never made money and suffered heavy
lossess on an ill-fated Sunday edition launched for a brief period
in 1989. Recently, the slump has deepened as an economic decline in
the New York City further cut advertising revenues.
