   The New York Post will add some panache to its
blue-collar image built on sex and crime, the tabloid's new
publisher promised Friday.
   ``We don't want to emasculate the New York Post,'' Peter O.
Price told the City Club, a civic group. But he added: ``Our
challenge is to make the New York Post noticed for the right
reasons and not for the wrong reasons.''
   The improved Post, he said, will aim for depth in its writing, a
Manhattan focus, an even beefier sports section and more positive
stories about education and race relations. It might also launch a
Sunday edition, he said.
   The Post, the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper, officially became the property of developer Peter
Kalikow on Monday.
   Australian-born newspaper baron Rupert Murdoch, who had owned it
since 1976, sold the money-losing tabloid to comply with federal
regulations barring ownership of a TV station and a newspaper in
the same city. Murdoch owns WNYW.
   ``Murdoch's Post was loud, lively and controversial. His British
tabloid style relied heavily upon sex, crime and violence,'' Price
said. ``Many advertisers ... refused to place ads in the newspaper,
which they considered out of step with the image they were trying
to portray.''
   Price said the emphasis on what some regard as ``terribly lurid
things'' is ``perhaps not so bad as people may think.''
   ``The pulse of journalism in the New York Post is that sense of
the city, that savvy, provocative, bold quality that's very often
talked about pejoratively because of Rupert Murdoch,'' he said.
   ``It very often gets people upset. But it certainly does not go
unnoticed. Our challenge is to make the New York Post noticed for
the right reasons and not for the wrong reasons.''
   Kalikow paid $37.6 million for the paper, which has been losing
money and circulation for years. It was founded in 1801 by
Alexander Hamilton.
   Kalikow acquired the Post only after the paper's 10 unions
agreed to a $22 million package of concessions, including a
last-minute gift of $3 million from Murdoch.
