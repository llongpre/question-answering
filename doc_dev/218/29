   New York Post owner Rupert Murdoch and the newspaper's labor unions agreed after tense negotiations to cost cuts, clearing the way for sale of the severely ailing tabloid to Peter S. Kalikow for $37 million. 

   But the 45-year-old real estate developer, who has no publishing experience, faces a difficult task of rebuilding the Post's readership and attracting advertisers when he assumes ownership in two weeks. 
On Friday, Mr. Murdoch said the tabloid was posting daily losses of $100,000. 

   The accord reached by Mr. Murdoch and the unions will make Mr. Kalikow's labor costs $22 million lower over the next three years compared with what Mr. Murdoch is paying now. 
The plan will remove 130 workers from the Post's work force of 1,200. 
In addition, the unions agreed to a pay cut for the remaining workers in the first year followed by raises in the second and third years. 
But Mr. Murdoch, to win union approval, agreed to reimburse them for their pay cuts at a cost to him of $3 million. 

   Under the sales agreement, Mr. Kalikow could abandon his efforts in a year and shut down the 187-year-old daily. 
But Peter O. Price, whom Mr. Kalikow has named as publisher, predicted yesterday, "It can be turned around and made profitable within a few years." 
The new owner plans to "redefine" the tabloid's look with bolder graphics and pay big-name magazine sports, entertainment and news reporters to contribute articles, said Mr. Price, chairman of Avenue magazine, a tony magazine distributed for free in New York's affluent upper East Side. 
"We're going to provide more depth to the news" and retain the Post's "feisty, street smart kind of image," he said. 

   Mr. Price said Mr. Kalikow will spend $5 million annually to upgrade and promote the paper. 
It will be marketed largely as an afternoon paper for yuppies: middle-class to upper-middle-class younger men and women who, said Mr. Price, "are looking for information that is alive, immediate, bold and provocative." 

   Mr. Murdoch had to sell the Post to comply with a federal rule barring single ownership of a paper and broadcasting outlet in the same city. 
He owns WNEW-TV in New York. 

   Mr. Kalikow agreed to buy the Post only if Mr. Murdoch extracted the concessions. 
The Australian-born publisher had vowed to close the paper at 2 p.m. Friday if the unions hadn't agreed to concessions by then. 
He backed down, however, when the deadline came and the unions had agreed to only $19 million and were insisting on a wage increase. 
Talks continued into the wee hours of Saturday before the two sides reached the settlement. 

   "The agreement isn't perfect, but it assures that the paper will exist for at least another year," said Barry Lipton, president of the New York branch of the Newspaper Guild. 

   Mr. Kalikow is already preparing to spend $2 million to promote the Post on TV and perhaps on the exterior of New York transit buses, said Mr. Price. 
The new owner and Mr. Price also plan to draw on their extensive contacts in the business community, particularly the real estate industry and retailers. 
"Real estate advertising can be very significant," said a spokesman. 
"And the brokers earmark a great deal of money on each project for advertising."
