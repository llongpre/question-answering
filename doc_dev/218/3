   Jane Amsterdam, founding editor of
Manhattan,inc. magazine, will become editor of the New York Post,
owner Peter S. Kalikow announced today.
   Ms. Amsterdam, 36, will start work June 13 and be listed
officially as executive editor until the departure of the current
editor, Frank Devine, Kalikow said in a statement. Devine is
returning to Australia by year's end.
   He stayed on after Rupert Murdoch sold the paper in March to
real-estate developer Kalikow, who made Peter O. Price publisher.
   ``We are delighted to be bringing in an editor of Jane
Amsterdam's caliber,'' Price said today in a statement. ``Her
reputation for editorial integrity and excellence is well-known.''
   Ms. Amsterdam was an editor in the Style section and the
investigative unit of The Washington Post, and executive editor at
New Times, American Lawyer and New York magazines.
   She is generally credited with making a success of
Manhattan,inc., which was founded in 1984 as an upscale city
magazine that treated top business executives as celebrities.
   She resigned in March 1987 after a disagreement over editorial
autonomy with the owner of the magazine, D. Herbert Lipson. In
January, she joined the publishing house of Alfred A. Knopf as a
senior editor.
   According to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Ms.
Amsterdam would become the sixth woman holding the position of top
editor at a newspaper with a circulation of more than 100,000.
   The Post is the nation's oldest continually published daily
newspaper.
