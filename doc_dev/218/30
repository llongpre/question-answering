   British press baron Robert Maxwell, publisher-developer Leonard Stern, two New York real estate tycoons and the owner of a newspaper aimed at blacks submitted formal offers for the New York Post last Friday. 

   But owner Rupert Murdoch, who faces a March 6 deadline to dispose of the tabloid, said the bidders were interested in the paper's real estate and not in continuing its operations. 
He has vowed to close it if he doesn't get an acceptable price. 

   The real estate is the property and building where the paper is published. 
The site is on the East River in lower Manhattan and has been valued in the area of $38 million. 

   Separately, Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan (D., N.Y.) is expected today to introduce legislation to give Mr. Murdoch more time to sell the Post. 
Also, a Washington federal appeals court set a schedule to consider Mr. Murdoch's appeal of a rejection by the Federal Communications Commission of his request to extend the deadline. 

   The bids apparently ranged from $30 million to $35 million, significantly below the $45 million to $50 million Mr. Murdoch wants. 
In a statement, Mr. Murdoch said they were all "highly conditional and include requests for unspecified further reductions in labor costs." 
The prospective buyers "have so far expressed an interest in the real estate value . . . where the newspaper is published," he said. 
"If the value of the real estate were removed, there would be no offer of significance for the newspaper alone. 
We are still hoping to receive such an offer." 

   Mr. Maxwell made an offer through his financial adviser, Rothschild Inc. 

   Peter Kalikow, a real estate developer, submitted a bid, said his spokesman Martin McLaughlin. 
Real estate developer Arthur Cohen said he and real estate developer Philip Pilevsky jointly bid. 
And Wilbert A. Tatum, chairman of the New York Amsterdam News, which circulates primarily among blacks, also made an offer, said his adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 

   "We made a very serious offer," said Mr. McLaughlin, the spokesman for Mr. Kalikow. 
"We intend to run the Post as a New York daily for a long time to come." 

   Leonard Stern, president of Hartz Mountain Corp. and owner of the Village Voice, said yesterday that he plans to contact union officials today for discussions. 
Mr. Stern said yesterday, "We have absolutely no interest in the real estate." 

   The FCC's cross-ownership rule prohibits a person or company from owning a newspaper and broadcast outlet in the same city. 
Mr. Murdoch also owns a TV station in New York. 
Under an existing waiver, he has until March 6 to sell the Post, which had a deficit last year of $17 million. 
In Boston, he owns the Boston Herald and a television station. 
He must shed one of the properties by June 30.
