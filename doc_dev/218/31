   The New York Post will launch its Sunday edition on March 5 with a budget of $30 million and an additional 60 employees. 

   At a news conference, Post owner Peter Kalikow also said the Post, which he acquired in March from Rupert Murdoch, should move into the black at some point next year. 
But Mr. Kalikow, a New York real estate developer, said he didn't know if the paper would post earnings for the full year. 
The Post's publisher, Peter O. Price, said he expects the Sunday edition to increase total revenue by 20% to 30% in 1989. 

   Mr. Kalikow said he had originally planned to introduce a Sunday edition in 1991 but moved up the launch date because of the tabloid's performance since he acquired it last March. 
Total advertising linage climbed to 16,000 inches in September from 10,000 last March, Mr. Kalikow said. 
He added that weekly losses have shrunk substantially from the $650,000 weekly deficits the paper was posting in March, but Mr. Kalikow didn't provide details. 

   The Post said its Sunday edition will include expanded news, sports and arts coverage; a TV and entertainment guide; and USA Today Weekend, a Sunday supplement magazine. 

   Currently, the Post has about 1,000 employees.
