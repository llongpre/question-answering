   The publisher who threatened to close the New
York Post unless unions accepted $19 million in job and wage cuts
predicted Tuesday that profits will soon begin rolling in.
   More than 30 employees resigned and took sweetened severage
packages the day after the union holding up the concession deal
voted to take the cuts. Those leaving will get standard severance
pay, along with two months pay they would have received if the
189-year-old paper had shut down.
   Publisher Peter S. Kalikow, surrounded by union leaders and Post
managers, said he expected the tabloid known for racy headlines and
focus on urban crime to turn a profit by Oct. 1. If his prediction
is correct, it would be the first time since the 1970s the paper
became profitable.
   Kalikow said the Post has been losing about $27 million a year.
To secure $19 million in union concessions, he promised the unions
20 percent of company stock and a representative on the board of
directors.
   The remaining $8 million will be saved by other operating cost
reductions, including management wage cuts.
   At a news conference in his office, he thanked those assembled
for helping him save the nation's oldest continuously published
daily paper.
   ``We sat in meetings with these guys, we sat in halls, we sat in
bathrooms with them. They did a fabulous job,'' Kalikow said, also
thanking more than 100 departing employees and the hundreds who
will make less money.
   ``It's in no small part that we owe these people some thanks for
the sacrifices they made,'' Kalikow said. ``The mortgage rate
didn't go down. The price of food didn't go down. The price of gas
didn't go down.''
   The Newspaper Guild, which represents 350 news, advertising and
clerical staff, voted Monday to accept job reductions and a 20
percent pay cut by switching to a four-day workweek. Top pay for
reporters had been $853 a week.
   Ten other unions accepted concessions Friday.
   Kalikow said all the unions had to agree to concessions or he
would shut down the paper. Two years ago, Kalikow won $24 million
in concessions from the unions as a condition of his purchase of
the Post.
   Some Guild holdouts had said they would rather see the paper
close because they would get severance money and 60 days shut-down
pay. Kalikow countered by offering severance and shut-down pay to
anyone who resigns before 5 p.m. Wednesday.
   Daniel F. Cremins, Post executive vice president, said that in
addition to the Guild offer, four other unions will receive a
similar enhanced departure package.
   More than 30 Guild members had resigned by Tuesday afternoon,
Kalikow spokesman Howard Rubenstein said, adding that an
undisclosed number of executives would be let go and others face
pay cuts.
   ``I can't see going through this again,'' said Henry Scott, 61,
a publications clerk at the Post for 18 years who said he resigned
although his wife is fighting cancer. ``I think it's my best bet to
get out now. I can't take it anymore.''
   He expects to get more than $30,000 plus the 60 days pay.
   Some Post reporters were in tears Tuesday and refused comment.
Colleagues said they were upset because they were resigning.
   ``I have a morale problem right now. They're angry and they have
a right to be,'' said editor Jerry Nachman. In the news business
these days, he said, ``You learn sadly that the operational word is
'business.'''
