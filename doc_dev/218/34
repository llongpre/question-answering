<HEAD>Post Faces Uncertain Future Under New Owner</HEAD>

   Now that the New York Post has been saved,
readers and employees wonder what the nation's oldest continuously
published newspaper will look like under the new owner, and whether
he'll stop its money-losing ways.
   Peter Kalikow, who is buying the tabloid from Rupert Murdoch for
$37.6 million, spent Sunday talking with advisers about what
direction to take the Post.
   The paper's 10 unions agreed Saturday to $22 million in
concessions that Murdoch and Kalikow said were necessary to keep
the paper alive. That includes eliminating 130 of the Post's 1,200
jobs.
   Kalikow is widely thought to want to back away from the paper's
emphasis on stories of sex, crime and scandal.
   It will remain a tabloid, but ``there will be a change in
format,'' said his spokesman, Howard Rubenstein. ``There'll be
changes in headlines, in the front page, in the emphasis of the
paper.''
   But, Rubenstein added, Kalikow ``still wants it to be feisty and
provocative.''
   Murdoch bought the paper in 1976 and fashioned it after the
British tabloids. Soon readers were seeing such headlines as
``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR,'' which ran above a story about a
homicide in a tavern.
   They saw a photo of Prince Rainier of Monaco looking into, and
making an obscene hand gesture at, a Post photographer's lens. The
caption read: ``THE PRINCE GIVES US THE FINGER.''
   And then there was the story about Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi's reported psychological problems, featuring a photograph
doctored to show readers what he would look like dressed as a
woman, complete with lipstick and earrings.
   Kalikow, a real estate developer and businessman worth an
estimated $500 million, has approved a $2 million promotional
campaign for the newspaper, said Rubenstein.
   According to his agreement with Murdoch, Kalikow promised to
keep the Post in operation for at least one year after he takes
over March 7.
   The Post lost about $17 million before taxes last year, and
about a quarter of its advertising in the last few months. Its
circulation has dropped from 700,000 to 500,000, partly because of
a retrenchment in areas outside metropolitan New York.
   A $1 million marketing study commissioned by Kalikow ``shows the
paper already appeals to a fairly well-to-do audience,'' Rubenstein
said.
