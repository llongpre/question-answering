   The New York Post screamed the good news.
``AIN'T OVER YET'' read the front page in what could have been the
final edition of the nation's oldest continuously published daily.
   The Post got a temporary reprieve Friday night when all but one
union agreed to $19 million in concessions after more than 12 hours
of negotiations.
   The ultimate fate of the 189-year-old newspaper depends on a
vote Monday by members of The Newspaper Guild. Its negotiating
committee voted 7-3 against the settlement agreed to by bargainers
for 10 other unions.
   ``If the choice is death or three days to live, I'll take three
days,'' said Jerry Nachman, the newspaper's editor.
   Publisher Peter Kalikow is demanding massive concessions to make
the tabloid break even. The newspaper is losing about $27 million a
year.
   The more than 850 Post workers represented by the 10 unions must
ratify the the agreement. The Guild represents 352 reporters and
members of the advertising staff.
   A cheer went up in the newsroom when Kalikow announced in a
televised news conference that the newspaper had at least another
three days.
   Eric Breindel, editorial page editor, said Kalikow had written
two columns for today's newspaper: one celebrating its survival,
one lamenting its demise. On Friday, some Post reporters worked on
``Live Post'' issues while others worked on ``Dead Post'' issues.
   ``We've been through a wringer all day long for a few days and
we're going to have to go through it again,'' said metropolitan
editor John Cotter.
   Cotter said a prepared farewell edition that included
reminiscences from past Post columnists was ``terrific ... but
hopefully it'll never be read by the public.''
   Money troubles are not new to the Post, founded in 1801 by
Alexander Hamilton.
   In 1939, heiress Dorothy Schiff bought the Post and made it one
of the nation's most liberal newspapers. But the Post also became
known for making do with a small staff and old equipment.
   In 1976, Schiff sold the newspaper to Australian media baron
Rupert Murdoch for $31 million. At the time, the newspaper was
losing $500,000 annually.
   Under Murdoch, the Post went conservative editorially and began
running sexy pictures, racy headlines - including the famous
``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' - and a steady diet of crime
stories.
   Murdoch said the newspaper lost $150 million before he sold it
in 1988 for $37 million to Kalikow, a real estate developer who
also acquired the newspaper's valuable waterfront land in Lower
Manhattan.
   The Post said today that Kalikow is demanding that the drivers
union give up 100 of 263 jobs; the 70 printers cut their work week
to four days and the 17 paper handlers give up five jobs.
   The Guild was asked to give up 43 jobs and to agree to a
four-day work week for four days' pay.
   ``I feel optimistic that when the members see it they will
approve it,'' said Kalikow. ``If they turn it down, the paper will
stop publishing immediately.''
   The Daily News, which also is losing money and is in the midst
of a labor conflict, has demanded that any concessions the unions
give the Post must be extended to the News under ``me-too''
contract clauses.
   The New York Times said it would seek union concessions related
to the same economic conditions that have affected the Post and
News and led to declines in ad revenues.
