   Manhattan inc. publisher D. Herbert Lipson named Clay Felker editor of the monthly magazine that focuses on business life in the city. 

   Mr. Felker, 58 years old, succeeds Jane Amsterdam, who resigned in March along with two top staffers after a dispute with Mr. Lipson over editorial independence. 

   Mr. Lipson, who also owns city magazines in Philadelphia, Boston and Atlanta, said he wouldn't expect Mr. Felker to make "massive radical changes" in the magazine. 
But he said Mr. Felker, who started work yesterday, may "want to broaden the focus, but always through the lens of Manhattan." 

   Manhattan inc., with a circulation of 85,000, is considered among the more successful new city business publications. 
The magazine, nearly two years old, has won a number of editorial awards and has had steady growth in advertising revenue. 

   Mr. Felker created the prototype city magazine, New York, but has had mixed results with publishing projects since selling that magazine to Rupert Murdoch in 1976. 
Among other ventures, he bought Esquire magazine, which he sold after heavy losses. 

   He was editor of the short-lived Tonight edition of New York's Daily News. 
Recently, he was consulting editor to U.S. News &amp; World Report magazine. 

   Mr. Felker said he wouldn't have any problems working with Mr. Lipson. 
Mr. Lipson concurred. 
"My relationship with Clay will be same as with Jane. 
The editor will have total control."
