   The New York Post trumpeted ``YES!'' one day
after its front page had asked: ``Will the presses ever run
again?''
   The affirmation in today's editions of the saucy tabloid came
after Newspaper Guild members voted 242-45 Monday night to accept a
four-day work week, which will mean a 20 percent pay cut.
   Publisher Peter S. Kalikow had threatened to close the nation's
oldest continuously running daily immediately if the 350 Guild
members - news, advertising and clerical workers - rejected the
concessions. The paper is losing $27 million a year.
   Today, speaking in his office, Kalikow praised the unions for
accepting his conditions and predicted a bright future for the
paper. The Post should begin turning a profit next month, he said.
   ``Of the three tabloids in New York, you're now standing in the
only profitable one,'' Kalikow told reporters at a news conference.
   ``You feel like the executioner has loosened the noose,'' said
Jill Brooke, a Post TV and radio reporter who voted for approval.
``But we still have a life sentence: a 20 percent pay cut.''
   Nearly 1,000 people would have lost their jobs had the
505,000-circulation paper known for dishing up stories of sex,
murder and mayhem under screaming headlines had gone under.
   ``Let's go to press,'' Kalikow said after the vote. ``This is
not a management victory. It is not a labor victory. It is a
victory for all New Yorkers who deserve the honesty and diversity
offered in the pages of the New York Post.''
   The Guild was the last of 11 unions to approve concessions
designed to help Kalikow break even. He is said to have lost more
than $100 million personally since buying the paper from media
baron Rupert Murdoch in 1988. Two years ago, Kalikow won $24
million in concessions as a condition of the purchase.
   Monday's vote was taken by hand after a 90-minute meeting
punctuated by boos, applause and speeches for and against the
proposal. ``There was some blood on the floor,'' said reporter
Kieran Crowley.
   Reporter Peter Moses voted for the pay cut despite reservations.
``We accepted a package that none of us liked, we accepted a
package that made no sense to any of us and we accepted a package
that makes us less than middle class,'' he said.
   Before the pay cut, top salary for reporters was $853 a week.
   Kalikow promised the unions 20 percent of company stock and a
representative on the board of directors. In exchange he got $19
million in union concessions and $8 million in other cost
reductions, including management wage cuts.
   Sentiment swung in favor of the concessions when Kalikow also
said employees could approve the plan, then resign by Wednesday and
receive the same severance and termination pay as if the paper had
shut down.
   Theodore Kheel, an adviser to the unions, said Kalikow also
dropped his demand that 43 jobs be eliminated. Instead he will
settle for how ever many resignations he gets, Kheel said.
   ``A diversity of editorial voices is important in a democratic
society,'' Daily News publisher James Hoge said in a statement
congratulating the Post.
   That diversity may be diminished yet, however. A regional
economic slump has hurt advertising revenue at all the city's
papers. Newspaper analysts say that in the long haul there aren't
enough ads to keep all four major dailies alive.
   The New York Times is in the black but turning less of a profit
than a year ago. Times spokesman William Adler said the newspaper
would seek some of the concessions the Post got.
   The Daily News, a tabloid like the Post, said it has a ``me,
too'' clause in contracts with its unions that entitles it to the
concessions the Post got. Talks at the money-losing News have
stalemated and unions are urging advertisers to boycott it.
   New York Newsday, the city's third tabloid, is losing money
also, but its profitable parent, Times Mirror Co., is keeping the
paper alive.
   The Post has a long history of money woes - and owners with the
deep pockets and the patience to take heavy losses. Its founder,
Alexander Hamilton, was in debt in 1801 when he persuaded a group
of merchants to finance the paper.
   Banking heiress Dorothy Schiff bought the Post in 1939, turned
it into one of the nation's most liberal newspapers and brightened
it up with a tabloid format. It was losing money when she sold it
to Murdoch in 1976.
   The Post's fortunes seemed to have dimmed for good in the 1970s
as much of its audience moved to the suburbs. Recently, the slump
has deepened as an economic decline in the New York City further
cut advertising revenues.
   Murdoch transformed the Post into a politically conservative
paper, albeit one that featured sexy pictures, racy headlines -
like the famous ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' - and lots of
crime stories.
   In the past year, the Post ran such headlines like ``BASTARDS''
over a photo of a hanged hostage and ``BEST SEX I EVER HAD''
accompanying a picture of a smirking Donald Trump.
   Murdoch said the paper lost $150 million before he sold it for
$37 million to Kalikow, a real estate developer.
   Post Editor Jerry Nachman on Monday likened the Post to a
bumblebee.
   ``Aerodynamically, bumblebees ought not fly; the ratio of their
body weight to wingspan would make it physically impossible,'' he
said. ``But they absolutely refuse to understand that. So they fly.
That's the Post.''
   ``And like the bumblebee,'' he added, ``we keep stinging
people.''
