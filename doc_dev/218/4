   Jerry Nachman, a columnist for the New York
Post, was appointed today as the newspaper's new editor.
   Nachman succeeds Jane Amsterdam, who was relieved on Tuesday of
her duties as editor by the tabloid's owner and publisher Peter
Kalikow.
   Ms. Amsterdam, former editor of the magazine Manhattan, inc.,
was the paper's editor for 50 weeks.
   Before Nachman joined the Post, he had worked as general manager
for the NBC-owned television station in Washington and news
director at WNBC-TV in New York.
   His appointment was announced in the paper's newsroom.
   Kalikow's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said no specific
incident precipitated the change. ``It's been under consideration
for a while, and Kalikow felt he needed someone new to take the
Post to the next level,'' he said.
   It had been reported that there was friction between the editor
and publisher over a decision to cut back the size of the tabloid's
Sunday edition, which has lost millions since it was introduced in
March.
   In a statement issued by Rubenstein, Kalikow said he was pleased
with the progress the Post had made under Ms. Amsterdam. She ``has
worked hard and intelligently and she leaves the Post with many
achievements. She will always have my respect and high regard,'' he
said.
   In the same statement, Ms. Amsterdam was quoted as saying that
she departs ``with great sadness. The paper came a long way,
achieving new energy and respectability.''
   Rubenstein said Ms. Amsterdam had not decided what she would do
next.
