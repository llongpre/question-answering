   The New York Post fired the latest salvo in the
Big Apple's four-way newspaper war, trying to lure both the brainy
and the brawny in a new Sunday edition combining savvy with sports.
   The tabloid, which has a third-place circulation of about
600,000, pushed its eclectic new image with a front-page article on
George Steinbrenner by literary journalist Nora Ephron.
   If sophistication was not a draw, there was Dennis the Menace and
Uncle Art's Funland, in color. The cartoons formerly ran in black
and white on Saturdays.
   For those hooked on the weekday Post's fare of politics and
crime, the front page headlined an exclusive in three-inch letters:
``Koch `Hit Men' Booted,'' on the secret deportation of two
Colombians believed to have been sent to kill Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   And there were sports, sports and more sports.
   Post President Peter Kalikow pushed the button that started the
presses for the Sunday edition of the nation's oldest continuously
published daily at 7:55 p.m. Saturday.
   The Tuxedo-clad Kalikow uncorked a bottle of New York champagne
and poured glasses for cheering pressmen in ink-stained coveralls
and paper hats. Later, Kalikow led them into the area where 575,000
Sunday papers were bundled and packed off for delivery.
   Publisher Peter Price handed out free copies of the paper Sunday
to travelers arriving at La Guardia airport.
   A year ago, Kalikow, a developer, saved the 188-year-old
newspaper from extinction by buying it from media mogul Rupert
Murdoch for $37 million. Murdoch threatened to close the
money-losing paper if he couldn't find a buyer.
   The Post now competes seven days a week for readers and
advertisers with the Daily News, The New York Times and the New York
edition of Newsday, the Long Island daily.
   The Post is third in the city circulation race, trailing the News
(1,281,706) and the Times (1,038,829) and leading New York Newsday
(176,043 in the city, and 706,440 overall), according to the Audit
Bureau of Circulations.
   Kalikow is trying to lure the more than 300,000 people who read
both the daily Post and The New York Times, but who may not want to
carry home the slicker Sunday version of his paper, said George
Lois, who created an advertising campaign for the Post.
   The Post, which like many newspapers expects to obtain most of
its advertising revenue from its Sunday edition, ``is fully booked
with ads for the next four weeks,'' said Kalikow.
   Kalikow said he expects to spend $22 million to $25 million on
the Sunday Post in the first year. He said it would be months before
he knows if the move has paid off.
   Many media analysts have said they are skeptical that the New
York market can support a fourth Sunday newspaper.
