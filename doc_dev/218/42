THE New York Post seemed as good as dead on Sunday, but the smallest and
most sensational of the Big Apple's three leading tabloids received a
last-minute reprieve after a weekend of intrigue and frantic negotiations.
Last weekend Mr Peter Kalikow, the Post's owner, found himself facing a
crisis when Bankers Trust, his chief backer, threatened to pull the plug on
a Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.9m) credit line that had jumped to Dollars 6m in
recent weeks.
The newspaper ran a deficit last year estimated at about Dollars 5m.
Mr Kalikow thought he had resolved his problems by arranging for Mr Leon
Black, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert executive, to invest in the Post.
But advisers close to the deal say Mr Black lost interest, which led Mr
Kalikow to warn last Friday that the Post faced closure by the end of the
weekend if no one else could be found.
A 20 per cent wage cut for the newspaper's 719 employees plus a cover price
rise from 40 to 50 cents were rushed through on Sunday afternoon as a
supposed alternative solution, but proved inadequate for Bankers Trust. That
is when New York's big guns stepped into the fray.
It was Ms Cindy Adams, the Post's gossip columnist, who got most heavily
involved in the search for a buyer. She worked the telephones throughout the
weekend, ringing 'my rich friends or my smart ones who know rich ones'.
By late afternoon on Sunday Mr Kalikow was telling staff he feared the paper
would have to shut down. But behind the scenes Ms Adams and Mr Howard
Rubenstein, king of the New York public relations world, were in touch with
Mr Bill Fugazy, the limousine mogul, searching for an angel. Mr Fugazy, in
turn, contacted Mr Steve Hoffenberg, a little-known 48-year-old financier
who owns Towers Financial, a factoring and accounts receivable business.
'Everybody who was anybody was calling everybody else on Sunday to try to
save the Post,' said one investment banker whose client turned down the
deal. And that included Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York.
When Messrs Rubenstein and Fugazy could not find Mr Hoffenberg it fell to
Governor Cuomo to send out a state trooper to track down the financier. The
police could not find him, but Mr Vincent Tese, the state director of
economic development, talked to Mr Hoffenberg.
Mr Hoffenberg eventually surfaced and a series of conference calls resulted
in a last-minute agreement on Sunday night.
The deal called for Mr Hoffenberg to provide an immediate Dollars 300,000
and to guarantee the Post's Dollars 6m line of credit. In exchange he is now
in pole position to spend the next four weeks deciding whether to go ahead
and become the newspaper's new owner.
The reprieve could still fall apart, but that did not stop the tabloid from
plastering yesterday's front page with the words 'NEVER SAY DIE]'
