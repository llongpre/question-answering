   Saturday's edition of the New York Post, the
nation's oldest continuously published daily, could be its last if
its unions do not come up with millions in concessions demanded by
the publisher.
   Publisher Peter S. Kalikow told the unions Sept. 4 that he is
losing $27 million annually on the tabloid and that he wants the
unions to relinquish $17.4 million in payroll and $1.9 million in
benefits by Saturday.
   But because he wants to write an editorial either saying goodbye
to New Yorkers or telling them of the Post's survival, Kalikow
changed the deadline on Tuesday to 8 p.m. Friday.
   ``Whatever the decision, he wanted it clearly explained to the
public,'' said Kalikow spokesman Howard Rubenstein.
   The Allied Printing Trades Council, a group of newspaper unions,
says that Kalikow has always been honest with the unions and
therefore they are willing to renegotiate the contract that ends
next March.
   Formal talks began Tuesday night with a 90-minute session
covering ground rules, following confirmation by the unions'
auditors that the Post was fighting for its financial life.
   The Allied also is negotiating over contracts that expired in
March at the Daily News, the nation's second largest metropolitan
daily. Talks there have been intense but fruitless since January in
what both sides say is a fight for the newspaper's life.
   The News management demands rights to eliminate rules it says
force it to pay for excess production workers. The unions claim the
News is seeking to eliminate the unions and either sell or shut
down the paper.
   The unions are asking retail advertisers to boycott the News
until a settlement is reached.
   The News has been losing money also and has been hit by an
industrywide advertising decline.
   News management told the Newspaper Guild on Tuesday that it
demands the same concessions the Guild makes to the Post.
   Guild President Barry Lipton said the News' demand was ``a naked
attempt to collapse these negotiations.''
   John T. Sloan, News vice president for human resources, said a
provision in the expired contract guaranteed that concessions made
to one publisher be made to others contracting with the same union.
