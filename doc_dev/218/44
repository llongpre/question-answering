   Rupert Murdoch agreed to sell his deficit-ridden New York Post to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow for $37 million -- if labor unions grant millions of dollars in cost savings. 

   But the unions representing 1,200 Post employees may propose seeking another buyer on their own if they deem the cost-cutting proposals too harsh, said a union official. 

   In addition to the sale price, Mr. Kalikow agreed to assume the costs of closing the paper -- such as severance and pension liabilities -- if that becomes necessary after he becomes owner. 
Those costs could exceed $40 million, said people close to the talks. 
In return, Mr. Kalikow would get the Post and its assets, largely waterfront property on New York's lower East Side. 

   The property was valued at about $37 million in documents circulated among prospective buyers. 
But Mr. Kalikow, who owns about a dozen buildings in New York, reiterated he isn't acquiring the Post for the property. 
"I firmly believe we cannot allow yet another newspaper to shut down its presses. . . ," he said. 
Mr. Kalikow, who has no publishing experience, has said he plans to name as publisher Peter O. Price, chairman of Avenue magazine. 

   The sale depends on eight unions "accepting a sweeping cost-reduction plan," said Mr. Murdoch, who plans to present a detailed cost-cutting proposal to union leaders today. 
The tabloid had a loss of $17 million last year. 
Advertisers have fled, and circulation has shrunk to about 500,000 from close to one million several years ago. 
Aides to Mr. Murdoch said the Post's financial decline worsened recently in the wake of uncertainty over its ownership. 
Mr. Murdoch, who owns WNYW-TV in New York, must sell the Post by March 6 to comply with government regulations forbidding single ownership of both a newspaper and broadcast outlet in the same city. 

   Mr. Kalikow said he is willing to take "a very considerable financial risk . . . only if we have the cooperation of all the unions." 
The Post "is close to the edge," added the 44-year-old conservative Republican, whose fortune is estimated at $500 million. 
If granted the concessions, Mr. Kalikow would spend "millions of dollars on promotions in an effort to attract more advertisers," said a spokesman. 
Without them, the spokesman added, prospects of the Post's continued publication are "almost nil." 

   Mr. Kalikow, however, refused to agree to continue publishing the tabloid for at least three years, a commitment that Mr. Murdoch sought from all prospective buyers, the spokesman said. 

   Under the agreement, people close to the talk said, Mr. Kalikow could close the paper in less than two years. 

   Mr. Murdoch didn't disclose details of the plan that he will present to union officials today. 
The Associated Press quoted a source as saying the concessions would include eliminating the newspaper deliverers for the Post, which then would be distributed by independent wholesalers for an estimated savings of $6 million a year. 
Unions representing reporters and press operators also are likely to be targeted, union sources said. 

   If Mr. Kalikow "is out of line" in the concessions he wants, "maybe the unions can ask Mr. Murdoch to give us 30 days to shop the paper around," said George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, a union umbrella group. 
In addition, union officials said they will want to determine whether Mr. Kalikow intends to seek a "joint operating agreement" with the Daily News, a competitor, to publish both papers more economically. 

   Separately, Lawrence Kessler, general counsel of Mr. Murdoch's U.S. media holding company, said the media owner intends to press his suit challenging the media cross-ownership ban. 
Sens. 
Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) and Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) backed a law banning the Federal Communications Commission from extending waivers or from reconsidering the ban. 
In Boston, Mr. Murdoch owns the Boston Herald and WFXT-TV.
