   The New York Post got a temporary reprieve
Friday night when all but one of its unions agreed to concessions
designed to save the feisty but unprofitable tabloid.
   ``Ain't Over Yet'' declared Saturday's front page headline when
it rolled off the presses early Saturday, hours behind schedule.
Post Owner Peter Kalikow had threatened to close the paper after
Saturday's editions without the cuts.
   Ten unions at the paper agreed to concessions during marathon
negotiating sessions. Kalikow said he needed $19 million in
concessions to keep publishing the newspaper, the nation's oldest
continuously published daily. The paper is losing about $27 million
a year.
   The last union, The Newspaper Guild, will vote on his offer
Monday night, Kalikow said. The Guild represents 350 editorial and
advertising employees. The union's negotiating team voted 7-3
against the offer.
   ``I feel optimistic that when the members see it they will
approve it,'' Kalikow said of his offer.
   If the Guild members reject the offer, the Post will cease
publishing immediately, he said. The newspaper has a circulation of
505,000.
   ``It was the best offer we could make under the circumstances,''
he said.
   Barry Lipton, president of Local 3 of the Newspaper Guild, said
he recommended his members accept the package. Details were not
disclosed.
   ``It's up to the members. It's the very best we could do. ... I
hope that the sense of the membership is to swallow what may be a
bitter pill,'' he said.
   Members of each union must ratify the agreements, but it
appeared the Guild vote was the key because its negotiators didn't
support the pact.
   The reprieve was announced after talks stretched for more than
12 hours and passed two deadlines. The paper had planned to print
its history, including reminiscences of former employees, if
Saturday's edition was its last.
   ``It's a terrific farewell edition we prepared but hopefully
it'll never be read by the public,'' metropolitan editor John
Cotter said.
   Talks had resumed Friday morning between the paper and the Guild
and other unions representing more than 850 of the Post's 960
employees. The newspaper's contracts with the unions expire in
March 1991.
   Kalikow said the concessions included pay cuts and layoffs. He
said workers would be given stock in the newspaper under the
agreements.
   ``It was a bitter pill for these people to swallow but they
realized it was important to save the Post,'' he said.
   A source involved in the Guild negotiations, who requested
anonymity, said that the Post had roposed a cut of 43
Guild-covered jobs. Previously, the newspaper had favored pay cuts
rather than job cuts, while the union has called for attrition
through resignations and buyouts.
   The situation was complicated by the plight of the Daily News,
which also is losing money, and which also is in the midst of a
labor conflict. News executives say any concessions the unions give
the Post must also be given the News under ``me-too'' contract
clauses.
   And The New York Times said it would seek union concessions to
the extent that they were related to the same economic conditions
that have affected the Post and News and led to declines in the
papers' ad revenue.
   Money troubles are not new to the Post - even its founder had
them. Alexander Hamilton was heavily in debt in 1801 when he
persuaded a group of merchants to finance the paper.
   His was merely the first of many famous names to be associated
with the paper.
   In the 1820s, New England poet William Cullen Bryant began a
50-year tenure as editor. Poet Walt Whitman covered the Civil War
for the Post. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was briefly a co-owner in
the 1920s.
   Heiress Dorothy Schiff bought the Post in 1939 and tried to
attract more readers with comics, features, a tabloid format,
strong sports stories and nearly 50 columnists.
   Schiff also made the paper one of the nation's most liberal. Her
self-described formula: ``honest unionism, social reform and humane
government programs.''
   But the humane reformer also was a bit tightfisted. The Post
became known for making do with a small staff and old equipment.
   By the mid-1970s, much of the Post's liberal, middle-class
readership had moved to the suburbs. In 1976, Schiff sold the paper
to Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch for $31 million. At the
time the paper was losing $500,000 annually.
   Under Murdoch, the Post took on a conservative voice and began
dishing out sexy pictures, racy headlines - including the famous
``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' - and a steady diet of crime
stories.
   Murdoch said the paper lost $150 million before he sold it in
1988 for $37 million to Kalikow, a real estate developer who also
acquired the paper's valuable waterfront land on South Street in
Lower Manhattan.
