   Valerie Salembier has resigned as president of
the New York Post after 17 months at the newspaper's helm, the
Post's owner announced Thursday.
   No replacement was announced. Post owner and publisher Peter
Kalikow said he would reassume the title of president.
   Salembier, a former publisher of TV Guide, was named to the post
in April 1989.
   Kalikow spokesman Howard Rubenstein said Kalikow had not asked
Salembier to resign. He added that she was not leaving for a
specific position elsewhere. ``They parted very amicably,'' he said,
   Salembier, who supervised business, advertising and circulation,
said in a written statement that she felt it was time ``to move
forward to new challenges and opportunities.''
   Kalikow praised her performance.
   ``She has successfully structured a business operation which has
effectively positioned the New York Post for sales and profit
growth in the 90s,'' he said in the statement.
   Kalikow in 1988 bought the newspaper, which was losing money,
from Rupert Murdoch.
   Under her tenure, the Post discontinued in November its
8-month-old Sunday edition, which failed to attract sufficient
advertisers or readers and lost millions of dollars.
