   New York Post employees cheered and uncorked
champagne Saturday after news that owner Rupert Murdoch reached
agreement with 10 unions to save the nation's oldest continuously
published daily newspaper.
   ``It has been a nightmare, but thank God, we're still in
business,'' said Lenny Higgins, president of the Newspaper
Pressmen's Union.
   The deal will enable Murdoch to sell the Post to real estate
developer Peter Kalikow. It involves a $22 million cost-reduction
package that fell into place just before 2 a.m. when Murdoch said
he would provide $3 million to the unions to satisfy the terms of
his sale agreement.
   The unions had already agreed to concessions totaling $19
million and said they could not give any more.
   Cheers, deep sighs and the fizz of champagne filled the Post's
fourth-floor newsroom when the agreement was announced. Some
employees had worn black to mourn the paper's possible death.
   ``I feel great,'' said Jerry Cronin, head of the drivers' union.
``I feel we salvaged something that at five (minutes) of two
(o'clock) was gone.''
   Murdoch had set a 2 p.m. Friday deadline for closing the paper,
and extended it with time almost out.
   Kalikow will take over the Post for $37.6 million on March 7
pending rank-and-file ratification of the concessions and
verification by his accountants of the details.
   His spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said Kalikow was considering
editorial changes that could tone down the Post's brassy style and
was committed to keeping the paper operating.
   ``There will be some changes in the format and appearance of the
paper but he's not yet ready to discuss the changes in detail,''
Rubenstein said. Many of the expected changes come from suggestions
by Post employees.
   The new owner will meet with union leaders immediately to
discuss his plans, Rubenstein said.
   ``He wants to assure them he bought the paper so it could
continue being a powerful voice in New York City and that he did
not buy it for the real estate,'' Rubenstein said. ``He will try to
make it a very New York paper.
   ``It seems his whole life now is involved with the Post. He's
gone into it with great vigor.''
   Kalikow faces stiff problems in a highly competitive market. The
Daily News and New York Newsday are also fighting for tabloid
readers and The New York Times maintains a strong leadership in
advertising revenue.
   The Post was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton and other
investors and during its long history has come close to folding
several times. The latest threat came from a federal law that
forced Murdoch to sell the financially troubled tabloid because he
also owns a New York City television station, WNYW-TV.
   He had said the Post was losing $100,000 a day and that he had
lost $150 million since he bought it in 1976 for $31 million.
   After Saturday's agreement was announced, Murdoch said, ``I
would do it all again. I ... hate to leave it.''
   The $22 million package presented to Kalikow will eliminate 130
of the 1,012 union jobs at the Post, some immediately and some
later over the three-year life of the deal. The paper has about
1,200 employees.
   ``I don't think there's any question that without Murdoch's
contribution of $3 million, the paper would have definitely shut
down,'' lawyer and mediator Theodore Kheel said. ``I would give him
the lion's share of the credit.''
   The package to keep the Post afloat consists of $22 million in
lost jobs and pay cuts and $3 million from Murdoch's News America
Corp. to restore the pay cuts. Because of that contribution, no
paycheck will be smaller for the employees who remain.
   Kheel said Murdoch referred to the $3 million he put into the
settlement as his farewell gift to the Post and its employees.
