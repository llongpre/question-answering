   A group of middle-class men, concerned that
friends were dying and nothing was being done, met in Greenwich
Village eight years ago.
   They called themselves Gay Men's Health Crisis. They had little
money and less clout; there was no name for the disease that
brought them together.
   Today, Gay Men's Health Crisis has a $10 million budget, its own
six-story Manhattan building and 2,000 volunteers, and the disease
has a name: acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   After years of hectoring politicians and public health officials
to address the problems of people with AIDS, GMHC and its cohorts
are themselves being challenged to cope with the changing face of
that population.
   Nationwide, more than 87,000 cases of AIDS have been reported,
about two-thirds of them among homosexual or bisexual men. But in
many cities, especially along the East Coast, someone diagnosed
with AIDS today is about as likely to have become infected by
shooting up with dirty needles as through sex.
   In New York City, intravenous drug abusers comprised an
estimated 45 percent of all newly reported AIDS cases last year.
``These projections bear out what we have long known, that the
spread of AIDS is fueled by drugs (and) that AIDS is accelerating
its onslaught upon poor, drug-ravaged neighborhoods and minority
communities,'' said city Health Commissioner Stephen Joseph.
   In New Jersey, IV drug abusers comprised 59 percent of new AIDS
cases.
   What this means to AIDS-service providers is only now being
addressed.
   San Francisco, with the most people with AIDS per capita of any
U.S. city, wins praise from all quarters for its response to the
epidemic.
   Its Shanti Project, a peer-counseling group for the terminally
ill, had one staffer in 1982 and was nearly defunct. Now it has a
$3 million budget and a paid staff of 70, directing counseling
groups and a housing program geared toward independent living for
people with AIDS.
   But Greg Day, Shanti's education director, notes that about 96
percent of AIDS cases in the city are among gay males ``who used to
lead relatively normal lives,'' were employed full time and have a
firmer footing in society.
   ``I think that because the impact of AIDS has been primarily,
overwhelmingly, on the gay community thus far, we have succeeded so
far in developing our resources along with the epidemic,'' he said.
``We don't have the answers yet on how to best serve the IV
drug-user population.''
   The situation is similar in Los Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis,
and other cities where the number of IV drug users is relatively
small, experts say.
   In Chicago, things are more difficult.
   ``What we're dealing with here in Chicago, particularly when
we're dealing with the issue of homelessness and destitution, is
not the gay community, but blacks, minorities, IV drug users,
prostitutes and their families _ people of the streets basically,''
said Al Mascia of Travelers and Immigrants Aid, a private group
that helps house homeless people with AIDS.
   ``While we want to adopt some of the programs or utilize some of
the models that San Francisco has, we're talking about working with
a different population for the most part,'' Mascia said.
   Part of the problem is that an IV drug user does not
automatically kick the habit when diagnosed with AIDS. But most
AIDS organizations require infected drug abusers to enter treatment
before they are accepted as clients.
   ``It's fine for us to deal with you as someone with ARC
(AIDS-related condition) or AIDS,'' said Tim Sweeney, GMHC deputy
director for policy. ``But the truth is if you're just leaving our
front door and going out and sticking another needle in your arm,
we're really not doing you any big favor.
   ``You've got two illnesses to be dealt with.''
   Programs such as GMHC and the Shanti Project depend on
volunteers, but Sweeney said, ``We are finding now that ... the
volunteer model really doesn't work with them. They need much more
direct, intense case management, much more involvement, usually by
a professional staff person to help them set up the structure of
their life, so that they're independent.''
   The drug abuser also is more likely to be homeless, yet shelters
are no place for someone infected with AIDS. Several cities run
apartments for people with AIDS capable of independent living, but
demand far outstrips supply.
   People with AIDS who no longer need hospitalization but have no
place to go often are sent to single-room-occupancy hotels, where
they have no medical supervision and must contend with seedy
surroundings and crime.
   Many are ``discharged from the hospital and can sit on the bench
out front,'' said Larry Ellis of Lifelink, a Washington-based AIDS
organization.
   In New York, a lucky few find room in the highly praised,
privately run Bailey House, the city's only supervised AIDS
residence. It opened in 1986 with rooms for 44 people and hopes to
add nine more rooms by the summer of 1990.
   For Lawrence Conklin, 38, a 20-year heroin and cocaine addict
diagnosed with AIDS about two years ago, a clean, nicely furnished
room at Bailey House and a treatment program ``was the only thing
that saved me.''

<HEAD>TV Guide Publisher Named President of New York Post</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also moving on general news wires.</HEAD>

   The publisher of TV Guide, Valerie B. Salembier,
has been named president of the New York Post, Post owner Peter S.
Kalikow said Wednesday.
   Peter Price quit as publisher to become a partner in an
international television and radio company, Kalikow said Monday.
Kalikow, who bought the money-losing paper a year ago from Rupert
Murdoch, noted that during Price's tenure the paper added a Sunday
edition.
   Ms. Salembier, a former senior vice president of advertising at
USA Today, will assume Price's responsibilities, said Emory
Edwards, a spokesman for the Post. She will supervise business,
advertising and circulation.
   Ms. Salembier takes over Kalikow's former title of president,
while Kalikow assumes the title of publisher and retains his
position as chairman of the board, Edwards said.
   Ms. Salembier, 43, became publisher of TV Guide in October when
the magazine was acquired by the News Corporation of America.
   ``I am thrilled with the opportunity to go back into the daily
newspaper business,'' Ms. Salembier said in a statement. ``The
potential for growth at the Post is terrific, and it's the perfect
vehicle for a great many new advertisers.''
