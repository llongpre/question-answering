   In an attempt to boost circulation and advertising revenue, the financially troubled New York Post plans to publish a Sunday edition. 

   The move by the Post is likely to heighten the long-running competition among the three New York City tabloids: the Post, the Daily News and New York Newsday. 
The latter two already publish seven days a week. 

   The Post's initiative also reflects the continued expansion of Sunday editions in the newspaper industry in response to circulation and advertising trends. 
While daily circulation is largely stagnant, Sunday readership is surging. 

   Total industry circulation increased slightly less than 1% from 1970 to 1980, while Sunday circulation jumped 22.4%, according to Presstime, a publication of the American Newspaper Publishers Association. 
During the same period, the number of newspapers with Sunday editions increased to 820 from 586. 

   Moreover, successful newspapers garner as much as 50% of advertising revenues from their Sunday editions. 

   Still, the Sunday edition is an expensive gamble by the Post's wealthy new owner, real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow, who acquired the loss-ridden paper this year from Rupert Murdoch. 
The Post must attract enough advertising revenue to at least cover the high cost of increasing publication to seven days from six. 
"The danger is that the fairly small amount of retail spending they now get will be spread over another day," said analyst John Morton of Morton Research. 

   Mr. Kalikow and other Post officials either couldn't be reached for comment or declined to discuss the move yesterday. 
But a spokeswoman said the launch date, reaction of advertisers, staffing and other details will be disclosed today. 

   Despite the risks, the Post has little choice but to proceed if it is to have an opportunity at long-term viability, some analysts believe. 
Without a Sunday paper, "readers are drawn to a competitor and are more vulnerable to being drawn away," said Leo Bogart, executive vice president of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau. 

   Patrick Purcell, Post publisher under Mr. Murdoch's ownership, said Mr. Murdoch explored launching a Sunday edition. 
"It was something that was essential from the point of view of circulation and ad revenue," he said. 
If the Post can draw revenue from advertising inserts and from classified and retail ads, "it could help their overall financial position," said Mr. Purcell, who now publishes Mr. Murdoch's Boston Herald. 

   Mr. Murdoch was forced to sell the Post because of federal rules that bar single ownership of a newspaper and broadcasting outlet in the same city. 
Mr. Purcell noted that publishing a Sunday edition, however, could have imposing costs, depending on the extent of the plans. 
"Having comics, a TV book and a magazine could have a serious impact on the economics of the whole project," he said. 

   Moreover, it will face competition from formidable Sunday editions by the New York Times, New York Newsday and the Daily News. 
"The difficulty is shelf space," Mr. Purcell said. 
In addition, he said, the company will have to cut an attractive arrangement with unions. 
Still, Mr. Purcell noted, the Post has a substantial following for its sports and entertainment coverage and for its columns. 

   A spokeswoman for the Post, which is owned by closely held New York Post Co., said daily circulation is about 600,000 and Saturday circulation, about 450,000. 
Some analysts said they would expect the Sunday edition to have circulation of 400,000 to 500,000. 

   Officials of New York Newsday, the city edition of Long Island-based Newsday, couldn't be reached for comment. 
Newsday is owned by Times Mirror Co. 
A spokesman for the Daily News, a unit of Tribune Co., said it was too early to react to word of the Post's planned move.
