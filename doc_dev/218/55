   Dorothy Schiff, the heiress who molded the
historic New York Post into one of the nation's most liberal dailies
during her 37 years at its helm, died of cancer today. She was 86.
   Peter Faris, a vice president at the Post, said Schiff died at
her Manhattan home. She had been sick since May.
   The Post, Schiff once said, advocated ``honest unionism, social
reform and humane government programs.'' Her paper was a
middle-class tabloid, packed with columns and features, restrained
only by Schiff's legendary tight fist.
   The Post is the oldest continuously published newspaper in
America, first published by Alexander Hamilton in 1801, and was one
of the few metropolitan newspapers owned by a woman.
   She was credited with saving the Post when she broke with other
publishers during a long newspaper strike in 1963 and resumed
publishing under the old contract. The paper gained circulation
during that period, and within a few years became the city's only
afternoon paper.
   ``Often voted least likely to succeed in New York's competitive
journalistic climate, she outmaneuvered such moneyed rivals as
Hearst's Journal-American, Scripps-Howard's World Telegram and Sun,
and John Hay Whitney's Herald Tribune, and in the end outlasted
them,'' noted Newsweek.
   On Nov. 19, 1976, after years of turning down potential buyers,
she sold the Post to media magnate Rupert Murdoch, reportedly for
$31 million. Murdoch transformed the Post into a racier and more
politically conservative tabloid before selling it to real estate
developer Peter S. Kalikow last year.
   Dorothy Schiff, known to many as Dolly, was born on March 11,
1903, in New York City to Mortimer and Adele Neustadt Schiff. Her
grandfather was financier Jacob Schiff, a founder of the Kuhn, Loeb
banking house and a prominent philanthropist.
   The heiress studied at New York's exclusive Brearly School and
attended Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.
   ``I was a rich kid of the right kind _ not the robber baron type
_ and had been to the right schools,'' she said in a diary entry
quoted in a 1976 biography by Jeffrey Potter called ``Men, Money and
Magic.'' ``I remember being furious whenever it (her wealth) was
mentioned. People even said, not entirely joking, `Come on, give me
a million. You won't even miss it.'''
   But Schiff's thrift at the newspaper was legendary. The Post
always seemed to do more with less _ the smallest staff, the most
decrepit equipment.
   ``I don't know if it's fear of being self-indulgent or a
puritanical guilt, but spending just isn't easy for me,'' she once
said.
   In the early 1930s, Schiff became involved in social welfare
efforts _ a settlement house for immigrants, several hospitals, a
club that provided lunches to women looking for jobs in New York.
   She became a confidante of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and
his wife, Eleanor. At one point, she declined Roosevelt's invitation
to run a program in his administration for farm women.
   Her involvement in politics escalated, however. George Backer,
her husband, was appointed to the City Council and then ran
unsuccessfully for Congress. Schiff was a Democratic candidate for
the state Constitutional Convention in 1938, losing to city Parks
Commissioner Robert Moses.
   In 1939, Schiff bought the Post at Backer's request. At first,
Backer served as editor and president; she served as director and
vice president and her ownership was not public knowledge.
   Financial losses led Schiff to believe that the paper needed
comic strips, columns, features and a tabloid format. When Backer
disagreed, Schiff promoted Theodore Olin Thackrey from feature
editor to executive editor.
   In 1942, Schiff became president and publisher. She divorced
Backer in 1943 and married Thackrey.
   She and Thackrey differed in print in 1948. Thackrey supported
Progressive Party candidate Henry Wallace; Schiff backed Republican
Thomas E. Dewey. By 1950, Thackrey was out, both as Post editor and
as Schiff's husband. In the 1950s, under James Wechsler, the Post
became known for investigative reporting.
   The Post eventually found an audience among the city's liberal
middle class.
   After years of profits, the paper's fortunes dimmed in the 1970s
as much of its audience moved to the suburbs. Ultimately, Schiff
sold it to Murdoch. ``It was a terrible headache,'' she said.
   Schiff's four marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was
Richard B.W. Hall, followed by Backer, Thackrey and Rudolf Sonneborn.
   She is survived by her two daughters, Adele Hall Sweet and
Sarah-Ann Kramarsky, her son Mortimer H. Hall, 15 grandchildren and
nine great-grandchildren.
   Faris said a private burial was planned, with a memorial service
later.
