   The New York Post, the nation's oldest
continuously published daily, gained a new lease on life today with
approval by its unions of $22 million in concessions.
   Owner Rupert Murdoch had said unless he was given $24 million in
concessions he would close the paper. But he contributed $3 million
to the deal, calling it a farewell gift.
   The agreement clears the way for Murdock to complete a $37
million sale of the financially troubled tabloid, founded in 1801
by Alexander Hamilton, to real estate developer Peter Kalikow.
   The agreement was reached at 1:50 a.m. after nearly 16 hours of
bargaining.
   ``I want to say at this time that I wish Mr. Kalikow great,
successful publishing of the New York Post,'' Murdoch said in
announcing the agreement. ``I ... hate to leave it.''
   While Murdoch had said the paper would close unless he obtained
the concessions, he agreed to stop the clock as negotiations
continued past his 2 p.m. Friday deadline.
   Kalikow agreed to a package that would save $2 million less than
originally sought on condition the unions agreed to all other
terms, according to Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for both Kalikow
and Murdoch.
   Under the agreement, Kalikow would save $10 million in the first
year, $8 million in the second and $6 million in the third, minus a
$2 million bonus in the final year, said Theodore Kheel, an adviser
to the unions.
   In each of the three years, Kalikow saves $7.5 million through
employee buyouts and $2.5 million through employee pay cuts, Kheel
said. In all, 130 jobs from a work force of 1,200 will be
eliminated.
   However, in the first year employees will not lose anything
because Murdoch will give them $2.5 million to restore the pay
cuts, he added.
   In the second year, Kalikow is to restore $2 million of the pay
cuts and Murdoch make up the difference with $500,000. Kalikow
agreed to provide $4 million in raises and $2 million in bonuses in
the third year, Kheel said.
   ``I don't think there's any question that without Murdoch's
contribution of $3 million, the paper would have definitely shut
down,'' Kheel said.
   Kheel said Murdoch referred to the $3 million contribution as a
farewell gift.
   Union leader George McDonald thanked Murdoch for the $3 million.
   The unions achieved their goal ``to save our jobs for our people
and our families,'' said McDonald, president of the Allied Printing
Trades Council, an umbrella group for Post unions.
   The agreement, to take effect March 7, is subject to
verification by Kalikow's auditors and union ratification, but
Murdoch said those were only formalities.
   Murdoch said of Kalikow: ``He's a very ambitious man, as well as
being a wealthy one. I know that he is determined to make it (the
newspaper) successful.''
   The Post faced financial problems from its earliest years but
held on as paper after paper in the city merged, then shut down.
   Murdoch bought the afternoon tabloid, the nation's oldest
continuously published daily, from Dorothy Schiff in 1976 for about
$31 million as he expanded his worldwide media holdings from
Australia and England into the United States.
   Under Murdoch, the paper turned from liberal to conservative on
the editorial page, became splashy and at times racy.
   His efforts failed to turn the paper around. Murdoch says he has
lost nearly $150 million in 11 years of operating the Post. He said
Friday that current losses were running $100,000 a day.
   Earlier this month, Murdoch announced he had reached agreement
to sell the Post to Kalikow.
   The sale was prompted by congressional action late last year
that blocked the Federal Communication Commission from granting him
another waiver to its rule against owning a newspaper and TV
station in the same market. Murdoch also owns WNYW-TV in New York.
   In Boston, where he faces the same situation, Murdoch has
indicated he'd sell his TV station and hold on to the Boston Herald.
