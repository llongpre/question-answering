   News and advertising employees at the New York
Post vote tonight on whether the nation' oldest daily will live or
die.
   Owner Peter Kalikow says if members of The Newspaper Guild don't
agree to a four-day week - less one day's pay - he will close
immediately, putting 960 people out of work. The
505,000-circulation paper is losing $27 million a year.
   On Friday, 10 unions at the paper known for its screaming
headlines agreed to $19 million in concessions. Guild negotiators
rejected Kalikow's offer 7-3, but the guild president endorsed it
and decided to let the members decide.
   The union's 352 editorial and advertising workers vote on
whether to accept a 20 percent pay cut and the elimination of 43
jobs.
   Punctuated by a big question mark and a picture of the presses,
the front page headline today was possibly the 189-year-old
newspaper's last: ``WILL THE POST PRESSES EVER RUN AGAIN?''
   Editor Jerry Nachman in today's edition was asked how he would
feel if the Post folded. ``How did the captain of the Titanic
feel?'' he asked.
   ``I think we will get through this tonight because the
alternative is unthinkable,'' Nachman said.
   ``It's more than a job,'' said a 23{-year composing room veteran
who declined to give his name as he arrived at work Sunday. ``It's
part of your life. It's part of the life of the city.''
   If the Post lives, workers will get 20 percent of company stock
and a representative on the board of directors, union leaders said.
   Kalikow bought the money-losing tabloid from media baron Rupert
Murdoch two years ago after wringing $24 million in concesssions
from the unions.
   As Kalikow's Friday evening deadline for reaching agreement on
still more concessions approached, the Post braced for the worst
and reportedly readied the headline: ``BANG, WE'RE DEAD.''
   ``AIN'T OVER YET!'' the Post trumpeted Saturday.
   Alexander Hamilton founded the newspaper in 1801. His was the
first of many famous names associated with the Post. In the 1820s,
New England poet William Cullen Bryant began a 50-year tenure as
editor. Walt Whitman covered the Civil War for the Post. Franklin
D. Roosevelt was briefly a co-owner in the 1920s.
   Heiress Dorothy Schiff bought the Post in 1939. While other New
York papers withered and died the Post profited under Schiff's
politically liberal format and tight budgeting. But its fortunes
dimmed in the 1970s as much of its audience moved to the suburbs
and it lost $500,000 annually.
   Schiff sold it in 1976 to Murdoch for $31 million. Murdoch
turned the Post politically conservative and into a steamy tabloid
with sexy pictures, racy headlines - ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS
BAR'' - and a steady diet of crime stories.
   Murdoch said he lost $150 million on the Post before selling it
for $37 million in 1988 to Kalikow.
