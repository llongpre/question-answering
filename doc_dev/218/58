   Some 12 to 14 potential buyers are studying financial data on Rupert Murdoch's unprofitable New York Post in preparation for possible bids that must be submitted in two weeks, said senior associates of the media magnate. 

   One of those said to have looked at the Post is Ronald Perelman, chairman of Revlon Group Inc. Mr. Perelman declined to comment, but three other individuals, or their aides, confirmed they are reviewing the information. 

   The three are: Peter Kalikow, a New York real estate developer; Wilbert A. Tatum, chairman and chief executive officer of the Amsterdam News, a New York weekly circulated largely among blacks and other minorities; and Arthur Carter, owner and publisher of the Nation magazine and New York Observer, a four-month-old weekly newspaper. 

   But the Post isn't considered an attractive media property. 
Martin Singerman, president and chief executive officer of Mr. Murdoch's News America Publishing Inc., said two potential bidders, after reviewing the so-called offering memorandum, have already bowed out. 
News America is the holding company for Mr. Murdoch's U.S. media properties. 
Despite prospective buyers for the paper, Mr. Singerman said, "we aren't confident that we'll find a buyer for it." 
He noted that the Post has had annual losses of $10 million to $20 million since Mr. Murdoch purchased the newspaper in 1976. 
Stanley Shuman of Allen &amp; Co., News America's investment banker, said preliminary bids are due by Jan. 20. 

   Mr. Singerman detailed efforts to dispose of the Post in interviews following his appearance at a congressional hearing on the future of newspapers in New York. 
The hearing was convened by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan (D., N.Y.) in the wake of a controversial budget provision passed by Congress two weeks ago. 
The measure forces Mr. Murdoch to sell or close media properties in New York and Boston. 

   The provision, passed at the behest of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), bars the Federal Communications Commission from ending a rule that bans companies from "cross-ownership" -- owning a newspaper, television or radio station in the same market. 
It also prohibits the FCC from extending any current waivers from the ban. 
Mr. Murdoch is the only individual with such a waiver, FCC officials have said. 

   Mr. Murdoch owns the Post and WNYW-TV in New York and the Boston Herald and WFXT-TV in Boston. 
Under his FCC waivers, he has until March 6 to sell or close one of his New York properties and until June 30 to shed one of his properties in Boston. 

   During a Wednesday night appearance on Cable News Network's "Crossfire" program, Mr. Murdoch said he intends to sell the Boston television station and keep the marginally profitable Herald, which has been a frequent critic of Sen. Kennedy.
