<HEAD>AP Board Approves 3.9 Percent Rate Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of The Associated Press
has approved a general assessment increase of 3.9 percent for its
1,538 daily and weekly newspaper members and 5,800 broadcast
members, effective Jan. 20, 1991.
   William J. Keating, chairman of the AP board of directors and
chairman and publisher of The Cincinnati Enquirer, said the
assessment increase, in percentage terms, was the lowest in three
years.
   ``Mindful of the difficult times that confront much of the
industry at this stage, the board approved a rate increase that is
well below the projected inflation rate for 1990 and 1991,''
Keating said.
   The 3.9 percent increase will not cover all of the increases and
new costs faced by AP. AP will continue to meet the growing demands
of the news industry through a vigorous cost control effort and by
increasing non-traditional revenue sources, Keating said.
   Non-traditional sources now make up 24 percent of AP's revenue.
Eleven years ago that figure was 7 percent.
   ``Of the new money that AP needs to fund 1991 operations and
continue to improve services, only 31 cents of every dollar will
come from the assessment increase,'' Keating said.
   ``It is vital to all of us that our cooperative remain strong
and able to meet the challenges in news coverage and technology,''
Keating said. ``Even as some members reduce their own activity to
absorb the impact of a difficult year in the industry, demands on
the AP grow as we look to AP to do things that, in a healthier
time, we might not have relied on AP to do.''
   The general assessment increase will be combined with another
step in the phase-in of the circulation-based newspaper formula for
those members that have not reached their appropriate assessment
level. The 1991 assessment also will reflect any circulation
changes at the member newspaper.
   The assessment increase applies to all basic services for both
newspapers and broadcasters and to all supplemental services except
for the rates for financial market tables, which are being adjusted
downward in two steps in 1990 and 1991 to reflect savings achieved
in producing computer-generated stock lists.
   AP members will receive their new weekly assessment figures by
early October, Keating said.

<HEAD>New York Post Faces Live-or-Die Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News and advertising employees at the New York
Post were to vote the evening of Sept. 17 on whether the nation'
oldest daily would live or die.
   Owner Peter Kalikow said if members of the Newspaper Guild did
not agree to a four-day week - meaning a loss of one day's pay - he
would close immediately, putting 960 people out of work. The
505,000-circulation paper is losing $27 million a year.
   On Sept. 14, unions at the paper agreed to $19 million in
concessions. Guild negotiators rejected Kalikow's offer 7-3, but
the guild president endorsed it and decided to let the members
decide.
   The union's 352 editorial and advertising workers were voting on
whether to accept a 20 percent pay cut and the elimination of 43
jobs.
   Punctuated by a big question mark and a picture of the presses,
the front page headline Sept. 17 was possibly the 189-year-old
newspaper's last: ``WILL THE POST PRESSES EVER RUN AGAIN?''
   In a story inside, Editor Jerry Nachman was asked how he would
feel if the Post folded. ``How did the captain of the Titanic
feel?'' he asked.
   ``I think we will get through this tonight because the
alternative is unthinkable,'' Nachman said.
   A 23{-year composing room veteran, who declined to give his name
as he arrived at work, said: ``It's more than a job. It's part of
your life. It's part of the life of the city.''
   If the Post lives, workers will get 20 percent of company stock
and a representative on the board of directors, union leaders said.
   Kalikow bought the money-losing tabloid from Rupert Murdoch two
years ago after wringing $24 million in concesssions from the
unions.
