   The New York Post's publisher confirmed Tuesday
that he had relieved the tabloid's editor of her duties.
   Reports of the change circulated last week.
   In a statement, publisher Peter Kalikow said he was pleased with
the progress the Post had made under Jane Amsterdam in the past
year, but said he wanted someone new to take the paper to another
level.
   Ms. Amsterdam ``has worked hard and intelligently and she leaves
the Post with many achievements,'' Kalikow said. ``She will always
have my respect and high regard.''
   Kalikow spokesman Howard Rubenstein said no specific incident
precipitated the change. ``It's been under consideration for a
while, and Kalikow felt he needed someone new to take the Post to
the next level,'' Rubinstein said.
   It had been reported there was friction between the editor and
publisher over the newspaper's Sunday edition, which has lost
millions since its introduction in March.
   In the statement, Ms. Amsterdam was quoted as saying that she
had had ``a terrific year here and depart with great sadness. The
paper came a long way, achieving new energy and respectability.''
   Ms. Amsterdam, 37, came to the Post 50 weeks ago. She had been
the editor of Manhattan, inc., which she had launched and helped
make a success.
   Rubenstein said Ms. Amsterdam had not finalized her plans for
the future.
