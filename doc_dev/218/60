   Is it a conflict of interest to own seven
television stations and TV Guide? Rupert Murdoch is about to find
out.
   But his $3 billion agreement to buy the weekly magazine,
Seventeen magazine and the Daily Racing Form is just the latest
deal by a man with media holdings on three continents, a dozen
newspapers, a half-dozen magazines and two publishing houses.
   Murdoch was known internationally before making his move into
the United States. Starting in Australia in the 1950s, he began
assembling his media empire there and in Britain, eventually
acquiring $2.2 billion in holdings.
   He assumed ownership of his father's paper, the tiny Adelaide
News, and built from there. His wife, Anna Murdoch, met him while
working as a reporter at one of his Australian papers.
   In 1969, he purchased The Sun, a London-based tabloid, and
showed Britain the Murdoch method of running a newspaper. In
addition to sensationalist stories, Murdoch added daily photos of
topless women. Circulation soared from 950,000 to 4 million.Later
he took over the staid London Sunday Times.
   Murdoch's early U.S. acquisitions included the San Antonio
Express and News, a daily newspaper, and the National Star, a
weekly gossip magazine. He owned both when he paid $30 million for
the New York Post in 1976.
   Once again his style became quickly evident: conservative
editorial stance, screaming headlines, outrageous stories. Although
the Post became a severe financial drain, its circulation increased
under Murdoch.
   And while he lost millions at the Post, the rest of his empire
flourished: profits for the News Corporation Ltd., his worldwide
company, were 32 times higher when Murdoch sold the paper than when
he bought it.
   While running the Post, Murdoch also purchased the Village
Voice, which he has since sold, and New York Magazine; his
aggressive posture earned him Adweek's 1982 Publisher of the Year
award.
   In February, Murdoch sold the Post to real estate developer
Peter Kalikow.
   Murdoch moved to Manhattan during the mid-1970s. In 1985, he
became an American citizen and began buying television stations.
   But an enemy made with his stance at the Post came back to haunt
him. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., introduced legislation setting
an imminent deadline for Murdoch to end his dual ownership of
newspapers and television stations in Boston and New York.
   Kennedy, during his presidential run in 1980, was hammered
repeatedly by the Post in its coverage. Murdoch papers also
delighted in running photos of an overweight Kennedy with headlines
like ``Tubby Teddy.''
   Murdoch also developed a reputation as a ruthless handler of
unions. His decision to automate the printing process at British
newspapers infuriated labor leaders there, but Murdoch is not
bothered by that.
   ``You seldom achieve big things in life without making some
enemies on the way,'' Murdoch said in an interview earlier this
year.
   Murdoch still owns the San Antonio paper; his other U.S.
newspaper holding is the Boston Herald. His efforts these days are
focused on converting Fox Broadcasting into the nation's fourth
commercial network.
   Murdoch has promised to keep looking for new deals.
   ``Now you're going to see joint ventures and start-ups _ new
newspapers, magazines and television services,'' Murdoch promised
five months before swinging the $3 billion deal with Triangle
Publications Inc.
