   Dorothy Schiff, the ``rich girl'' who for 37
years ran the New York Post with a liberal editorial stance and a
tight rein on finances, died Wednesday of cancer. She was 86.
   Schiff, who had been ill since May, died at her home, said Peter
Faris, a vice president at the Post.
   Schiff bought the Post in 1939 at the behest of her husband. She
sold it to media magnate Rupert Murdoch in 1976 for a reported $31
million.
   In between, she commanded the fortunes of a newspaper which, in
her words, advocated ``honest unionism, social reform and humane
government programs.''
   Under Schiff the Post was a middle-class tabloid known for its
features, columns and liberal views.
   While other New York newspapers withered and died _ the
Journal-American, the World Telegram and Sun, the Herald Tribune,
the Mirror _ the Post survived, and eventually became the only
afternoon paper in the city.
   ``Often voted least likely to succeed in New York's competitive
journalistic climate, she outmaneuvered'' and outlasted rivals,
Newsweek once wrote.
   Dorothy Schiff, known to many as Dolly, was born in New York City
in 1903. Her grandfather was financier Jacob Schiff, a founder of
the Kuhn, Loeb banking house and a prominent philanthropist.
   The young heiress studied at New York's exclusive Brearly School
and attended Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.
   ``I was a rich kid of the right kind _ not the robber baron type
_ and had been to the right schools,'' she once observed.
   As an adult, she was thrifty: ``I don't know if it's fear of
being self-indulgent or a puritanical guilt, but spending just isn't
easy for me.''
   In later years, Schiff's tight fist was legendary. The Post
always seemed to do more with less _ the smallest staff, the most
decrepit equipment.
   In the early 1930s, Schiff got involved in a number of social
welfare efforts _ a settlement house for immigrants, several
hospitals, a club that provided lunches to women looking for jobs in
New York.
   By birth, Schiff was a Republican. But the Depression, and the
response of the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, led her to
change her affiliation. She became a confidante of both the
president and Eleanor Roosevelt, and at one point declined
Roosevelt's invitation to run a program for farm women.
   In 1939, Schiff bought the Post at the request of her husband,
George Backer, an appointee to City Council who ran unsuccessfully
for Congress. At first, Backer served as editor and president; she
served as director and vice president, and her ownership was not
public knowledge.
   Financial losses led Schiff to conclude that the paper needed
comic strips, columns, features and a tabloid format. When Backer
disagreed, Schiff promoted Theodore Olin Thackrey from feature
editor to executive editor.
   In 1942, Schiff became president and publisher. She divorced
Backer in 1943 and married Thackrey.
   ``When I took on the Post, I didn't have much faith in myself or
the paper, and I didn't really think I could pull it out. Now, it's
part of me _ we are part of each other,'' Schiff said in a 1976
biography, ``Men, Money and Magic,'' by Jeffrey Potter.
   Her notion that features would build readership paid off _ the
Post's magazine-style stories and pages of columns (at one point in
the 1940s, the Post had nearly 50 columnists, including Schiff
herself) had faithful followers.
   The Post also became known for its sports coverage, although
Schiff confided later, ``I never read a sports page in my life.''
   She and Thackrey differed in print in 1948. Both opposed Harry
Truman, but Thackrey supported Progressive candidate Henry Wallace
and Schiff backed Republican Thomas E. Dewey. By 1950, Thackrey was
out, both as editor and as Schiff's husband.
   In the 1950s, under James Wechsler, the Post became known for
investigative reporting. Wechsler eventually relinquished control of
the news department and took over the editorial page, and in the
1960s the newspaper's features became softer.
   After years of profits, the paper's fortunes dimmed in the 1970s
as much of its audience moved to the suburbs. Ultimately, Schiff
sold it to Murdoch. ``It was a terrible headache,'' she said.
   Murdoch transformed the Post into a racier, more conservative
tabloid before selling it to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow
in 1988.
   Schiff's four marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was
Richard B.W. Hall, followed by Backer, Thackrey and Rudolf Sonneborn.
   She is survived by her two daughters, Adele Hall Sweet and
Sarah-Ann Kramarsky, her son Mortimer H. Hall, 15 grandchildren and
nine great-grandchildren.
   A private burial was planned.
