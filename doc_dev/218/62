   Developer Peter Kalikow took ownership of the
New York Post from Rupert Murdoch on Monday, calling it a historic
moment and pledging to make the money-losing tabloid ``a winner
financially and editorially.''
   The papers transferring ownership were signed Monday afternoon,
according to Post spokesman Howard Rubenstein. Last month, after
marathon bargaining, the Post's 10 unions agreed to concessions
required by the new owner, and the last of the unions officially
ratified the concessions Sunday.
   ``The rescue of the Post is nothing less than an historic
moment,'' Kalikow said in a statement, thanking the unions and
employees ``for their heroic efforts.''
   Union leaders will sign formal papers Tuesday and meet with
Kalikow on Thursday to ``get to know each other,'' said George
McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, which
represents eight of the 10 unions.
   ``We're delighted, really delighted, glad it's all over,''
McDonald said.
   Kalikow bought the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper for $37.6 million from Murdoch, who sold the paper to
comply with Federal Communications Commission regulations barring
ownership of two media outlets in the same city. Murdoch owns
WNYW-TV in New York.
   The sale was contingent upon the union concessions, which
totaled $22 million and eliminated 130 jobs.
   Murdoch, who was in London on Monday, has said he was losing
$100,000 a day with the Post and had lost $150 million in the 12
years he owned it.
   Kalikow said he intended to stop the Post's losses and added:
``I am committed to expanding its readership base through millions
of dollars in promotion, adding features to the paper, greatly
expanding its investigative reporting and strengthening its
advertising revenues to make the paper profitable on a long-term
basis.''
   ``The paper will be a winner financially and editorially,'' he
said.
