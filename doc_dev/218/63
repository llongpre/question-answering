THE New York Post yesterday filed for bankruptcy protection and failed to
publish amid a newsroom mutiny.
The seemingly indestructible tabloid has bounced back from the verge of
death several times in recent years, but the latest crisis may prove fatal.
It was triggered by a staff revolt following plans to sack about 270 people
by the Post's latest potential publisher, Mr Abe Hirschfeld.
On Friday, a bankruptcy court judge ruled that property investor Mr
Hirschfeld could acquire the paper. He immediately ordered dismissal of the
editor and threatened to fire about a third of its staff.
Although the paper's current owner, property developer Mr Peter Kalikow,
filed for protection from creditors in 1991, the paper was not part of his
bankruptcy petition. Mr Kalikow continued to run the paper until January,
when bank pressure forced him to put it up for sale. The Post lost about
Dollars 5m last year.
