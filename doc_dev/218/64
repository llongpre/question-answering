   A union official whose cooperation was
considered crucial to saving the New York Post boycotted
labor-management negotiations Wednesday, with a deadline for
closing the paper two days away.
   Jerry Cronin, president of the 350-member drivers' union, did
not join the negotiations. Both sides had said agreement was
impossible without the cooperation of his union.
   Late in the day, the Post announced that arbitrator Thomas G.
Christensen, a labor law professor at New York University, had
denied a petition by the drivers' union to stop the paper from
closing Feb. 19.
   The union argued that the Post was required by contract to give
30 days' notice of any change in work rules, Rubenstein said.
Christensen decided that the rule did not apply if the paper was
closing.
   ``The newspaper hopes that the drivers will now work with them
in reaching an agreement,'' said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for
the Post.
   Cronin could not be reached for comment.
   Earlier, labor lawyer Theodore W. Kheel, who is advising the
newspaper's union, had said ``there's no chance of a settlement
before Friday.''
   The talks between management and nine Post unions at the Grand
Hyatt Hotel were scheduled to continue around the clock until the 2
p.m. Friday deadline set by Post owner Rupert Murdoch, who has
demanded $24 million in union concessions over three years.
   After meeting for 35 minutes, both sides broke for lunch and
consultations. George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing
Trades Council, said they had discussed the concession figure and
told reporters, ``I feel optimistic. We all had smiles in there, I
think.''
   If the unions refuse to go along with the concessions, Murdoch
has said his $37 million sale of the paper to real estate developer
Peter Kalikow will collapse and the paper will close.
   Participants in the talks included Post publisher Patrick
Purcell and other Post executives, McDonald and leaders from most
of the eight unions which constitute the trades council.
   Purcell had no comment after the brief meeting.
   One union leader, Lenny Higgins of the pressmen's union, said
one goal was to extend the deadline. ``If he (Murdoch) stays with
the Friday deadline, I don't know what'll happen,'' he said.
   Under the terms of his contract with Kalikow, Murdoch has until
Monday to negotiate the union concessions.
   Murdoch opted to sell the Post after Congress passed legislation
preventing cross-ownership of a newspaper and a television station
in the same city. Murdoch also owns WNYW-TV in New York. He faces a
similar cross-ownership situation in Boston.
   Murdoch claims he has lost nearly $150 million since purchasing
the Post 11 years ago.
