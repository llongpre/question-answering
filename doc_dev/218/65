   Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings said he vehemently opposes efforts by publisher Rupert Murdoch to extend a March 6 deadline to sell the New York Post, almost assuring the defeat of any legislative effort in Mr. Murdoch's behalf. 

   "That fellow is a manipulator," the South Carolina Democrat said of Mr. Murdoch in Washington. 
"He got one extension already (to sell the Post); he's not getting any waivers." 

   Sen. Hollings's support is crucial for the success of any legislation to extend the deadline to sell the New York Post. 
Sen. Hollings and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) last month pushed through a little-noticed measure that blocked the Federal Communications Commission from reconsidering its rules forbidding companies from owning newspapers and broadcast outlets in the same market, and from extending any existing waivers. 

   Any legislation to repeal the measure would have to pass through Sen. Hollings's Commerce Committee. 
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.), who is expected to introduce a bill to allow the FCC to extend waivers, has said that as a practical matter he needs unanimous support to pass the bill by March 6. 
Asked whether he would fight such legislation, Sen. Hollings said, "Hell, yes." 

   Meanwhile, several real estate developers have emerged as potential bidders for the Post, raising fears among some union officials that prospective buyers may be more interested in the newspaper for its real estate value. 
According to an associate of one potential bidder, Mr. Murdoch values the real estate on which the Post is located at some $30 million and that he is seeking $50 million for the Post. 
The source said the potential buyer values the property much lower. 

   Mr. Murdoch is under FCC orders to sell either the New York Post or WNYW-TV in New York. 
He also has until June 30 to sell either the Boston Herald or WFXT-TV in Boston. 
Mr. Murdoch has said he would try to sell the Post or close it, while keeping the Herald and selling WFXT. 
Both newspapers have been critical of liberal politicians, such as Sen. Kennedy, whom the Herald has accused of waging a "vendetta." 
Sen. Kennedy denies that. 

   Earlier this month, Mr. Murdoch asked the FCC for an indefinite waiver to keep the Post, because he might have to close it otherwise. 
The commission dismissed the petition this week. 

   Sen. Kennedy, who met yesterday with union officials representing New York Post workers, said he doubted Mr. Murdoch was making a "good-faith effort" to sell the Post. 
He said he would support "a little more time" for Mr. Murdoch if the publisher needs it to complete the sale of the Post, but the senator continued to oppose a permanent waiver. 

   In New York, Mr. Murdoch said, "The New York Post has been losing as much as $17 million a year, and those extraordinary losses pose great difficulty in finding buyers." 

   Union leaders expressed optimism that Sen. Kennedy didn't rule out providing relief if the March 6 deadline becomes the only hurdle to completing the sale of the Post. 
"We do think there are legitimate buyers," said George McDonald, chairman of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the coalition of all of the unions. 

   However, that view wasn't shared by all union officials. 
"We aren't satisfied there are legitimate buyers who aren't interested in the Post only for real estate purposes," said Jerry Cronin, head of the Newspapers Delivers Union. 

   Potential bidders include Peter S. Kalikow, president of H.J. Kalikow &amp; Co., which builds luxury rental apartments in Manhattan, and Arthur G. Cohen and Philip Pilevsky, two major New York developers, who this week said they were considering a joint offer. 

   Mr. Kalikow told Mr. Murdoch this week that he plans to install Peter O. Price, chairman of Avenue magazine, in "a major role" at the Post if he acquires it, said a spokesman for the developer. 

   The FCC established the newspaper cross-ownership rule in 1975 to limit the concentration of local media power in one company. 
But critics of the rule say it has become outmoded because of the vast expansion of broadcast stations, cable television and other electronic media.
