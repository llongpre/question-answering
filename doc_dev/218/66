   In 1986, Herb Lipson, chairman of Philadelphia-based Metrocorp, had a hold on one of magazine publishing's hottest tickets: Manhattan, inc. 

   Today, five years after its start, there are signs the slick monthly is cooling off. 
Still recovering from the October 1987 stock-market crash, the magazine is struggling not only to recover lost advertising pages -- they peaked in 1986 at 912 pages -- but also to reassert itself in arguably the most competitive magazine market in the country, New York City, which is crowded with such magazines such as New York, Avenue, 7 Days, and New York Woman, all vying for retail, real-estate and financial advertising. 

   "I think the feeling among agency media people is that the magazine has stalled," says Michael Drexler, national media director at Bozell Inc. "New York is already cut up too much. 
There are so many magazines competing for segments. 
Manhattan, inc. has a preferred audience, but can they demonstrate they can make that grow?" 

   Publisher Lipson rejects the notion his magazine is slipping, and on the surface, at least, circulation figures back him up. 
Manhattan, inc. was able to pass the 100,000 mark this year, an essential hurdle for any consumer magazine attempting to attract major advertisers. 
"When you get over that 100,000 circulation hump, the ad community's perception of you improves considerably," said Paul Ducharme, director of print media at Grey Advertising. 

   But other ad executives wonder whether Manhattan, inc.'s charter to follow the lives of New York's movers and shakers isn't too narrow. 

   Editor Clay Felker and editorial director Peter Kaplan are stretching the boundaries of the magazine somewhat with the introduction in September of "Man, Inc.," a new monthly feature section celebrating what business people do when they aren't working. 
The section takes a breezy tone more reminiscent of Gentlemen's Quarterly or Esquire than Manhattan, inc.'s traditional behind-the-scenes probings of the New York business world. 

   Mr. Felker, however, staunchly defends the innovation. 
"We aren't a business magazine, we are a life-style magazine, and that's how we should be sold," he says. 

   Publisher Sandra Ourusoff is pure business about selling advertising, and has achieved some success with a 24-page travel section called "Power Trips" in the September issue and a 16-page section featuring yacht manufacturers snootily entitled "The Way You Wear Your Yacht." 

   The September issue pulled in 130 ad pages, well above the 85 pages in the September 1988 magazine. 
But for the first six months of 1989, Manhattan, inc.'s ad pages dropped 25% from the same period in 1988. 
Although circulation rose to 110,000 in the first half of this year, newsstand sales were off by 70%. 
Moreover, while subscriptions rose 68%, the rise was partly due to costly subscription drives offering the magazine for as little as 50 a copy. 

   Promotion director Theodore Kruckel says a national subscription drive two years ago was an expensive flop and that current efforts are being directed closer to home. 
The magazine now spends about $36 to get each new subscriber, he says, down from $60 in the past. 

   One way to build circulation cheaply would be to send the magazine for free to a targeted group of the demographically desirable -- so-called controlled circulation. 
But Manhattan, inc. has no such plans. 
The magazine has ended a two-year campaign of using "qualified circulation" -- sending copies free to top executives who request it. 
About 5,000 copies were going out free to Fortune 500 company executives in a bid to convert them into paid readers. 

   Mr. Lipson says he doesn't have any interest in selling the magazine even though, according to industry sources, he has been offered as much as $20 million. 
Media scuttlebutt aside, he also says he's solidly behind Mr. Felker, who replaced editor Jane Amsterdam in 1987. 
Some early Felker touches such as business fiction weren't hot favorites of the owner, but Mr. Lipson says Mr. Felker "has started to click and he's clicking now." 

   As a business venture, though, Manhattan, inc. hasn't started to click. 
Though Mr. Lipson once thought it would be profitable by now, it is losing money and is being carried on the backs of Metrocorp's successful city magazines, Philadelphia and Boston. 
But Mr. Lipson is optimistic. 
He vows Manhattan, inc. will be profitable in another two years.
