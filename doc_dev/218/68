   New York Post owner Rupert Murdoch today
re-entered negotiations seeking union concessions and stopped the
clock on his deadline for closing the nation's oldest continuously
published daily newspaper.
   Just after his 2 p.m. deadline, Murdoch slipped out of
negotiations and told reporters in a hallway that the clock had
been stopped for 15 minutes.
   The extension continued for two hours with no word from either
camp, as Murdoch and his management team went to a separate room
for discussion.
   At 4 p.m., union leaders and Murdoch spokesman Howard Rubenstein
said both sides were breaking for food.
   But union leader George McDonald said Murdoch was using the time
to meet with Peter Kalikow, the prospective buyer of the Post.
   ``They're on their way over to see him to talk about something
we discussed,'' McDonald said, without elaborating.
   At the same time, at the Post's offices, reporters and editors
were working on a Saturday edition.
   As recently as this morning, Murdoch had vowed he would not stop
the clock.
   Murdoch has demanded the unions make $24 million worth of
concessions over three years so that he can close a $37 million
deal to sell the paper to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow.
   Murdoch has said that without the savings, he was folding the
paper, whose ownership has put him in conflict with federal
regulations barring anyone from running a newspaper and television
station in the same city.
   The Post's unions have put forward a savings package they say
amounts to $33 million, a figure management has called overstated
by $12 million.
   Two major sticking points have been union insistence on a raise
for workers and the gap between the total savings management
demanded and what it agreed to recognize of the unions' proposed
concessions, according to Theodore Kheel, a consultant to the
unions.
   The Allied Printing Trades Council, an umbrella group for Post
unions, and the delivery truck drivers' union met separately to
consider how to come up with the difference.
   ``I am very optimistic'' about reaching agreement by 2 p.m.,
said Council President George McDonald. ``If we fall short, either
side, it would be really a disgrace and a disservice for the
employees and also the people of New York for losing another
paper.''
   The council offered a package Wednesday that union leaders said
would save $33 million over three years _ $9 million more than
Murdoch demanded. The unions proposed using the difference to fund
a wage increase.
   But management rejected a $12 million plank of the plan _
abolishing pre-shift overtime _ as non-negotiable under the terms
of Murdoch's contract with Kalikow, leaving the two sides in
agreement on just $21 million in savings.
   ``I would not call this negotiation,'' Kheel said. ``This is
more of an exercise in trying to fit results to preordained
criteria, an ultimatum.''
   The Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union proposed saving $3
million by cutting 30 jobs, part of 116 job buyouts at the paper,
and extending the work week by a half-hour, said Jerry Cronin, the
union's president.
   The unions, meanwhile, lost a bid to have the National Labor
Relations Board issue a complaint or block the threatened closing.
   In his contract with Kalikow, Murdoch has until Feb. 22 to
negotiate the union concessions, three days past his stated
deadline.
   Murdoch chose to sell the Post following congressional action
that blocked the Federal Communications Commission from granting
him a continuation of a waiver of its rule against owning a
newspaper and a television station in the same city. Murdoch also
owns WNYW-TV in New York.
   He faces a similar situation in Boston, where he owns the Boston
Herald and WFXT-TV. He has said he would sell the TV station if
forced to choose.
   Murdoch says he has lost nearly $150 million since purchasing
the Post 11 years ago. The paper was founded by Alexander Hamilton
in 1801.
