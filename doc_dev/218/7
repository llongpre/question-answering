   Jane Amsterdam, a magazine and book editor, will
be the next editor of the New York Post, the newspaper's owner,
Peter S. Kalikow, announced Tuesday.
   Ms. Amsterdam will be the sixth woman at the editorial helm of
an American newspaper of greater than 100,000 circulation,
according to the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Ms. Amsterdam said she felt ``probably the way that filly felt
on Saturday,'' a reference to Winning Colors, the third female
horse ever to win the Kentucky Derby. ``I think it's great.''
   Ms. Amsterdam will join the newspaper officially on June 13 and
be listed as executive editor until the departure of the current
editor, Frank Devine, who is returning to Australia for personal
reasons by year's end, Kalikow's announcement said.
   Ms. Amsterdam was founding editor of Manhattan inc., a
business-oriented city magazine, in 1984, but left three years
later in a disagreement with the owner, D. Herbert Lipson.
   She joined the publishing house of Alfred A. Knopf as a senior
editor in January.
   Previous positions include deputy editor of investigations at
the Washington Post and assignment editor in the paper's style
section. Before that she was executive editor at The American
Lawyer, New York magazine, New Times magazine and the New Jersey
Monthly.
