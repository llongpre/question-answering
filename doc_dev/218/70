<HEAD>GAO: U.S. Information Agency Overrated Viewership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has vastly overestimated
the viewership of TV Marti, whose broadcasts since March have been
marked by Cuban government jamming, according to a congressional
report Aug. 25.
   The U.S. Information Agency had estimated 1 million to 7 million
Cubans watched the new station, which broadcasts American
entertainment and news shows to the communist-ruled island from
Florida.
   But the General Accounting Office, in an unpublished report
obtained by The Miami Herald, cited notes by U.S. diplomats who
estimated an audience of only 50,000 to 70,000.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, faulted the USIA's
methods in two viewership surveys, which polled Cuban refugees and
emigres arriving at Miami International Airport between March 28
and May 12.
   The survey subjects ``would be more interested in and aware of
TV Marti than the general population'' because they were leaving
Cuba, the GAO said.

<HEAD>TV Studio Goes Off the Air as Police Search for Pizza Robber</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television station went off the air the night
of Aug. 25 when police evacuated studios to conduct their third
search of the day for an armed robber.
   After 25 minutes of dead air, Chicago station WLS-TV resumed
broadcasting at a jury-rigged studio in the Sears Tower. It issued
a special newscast to let viewers know what had happened.
   The station went off the air again 15 minutes later as police
using scent dogs searched the 13-story studio building.
   A man thought to be armed with a pistol was seen entering the
building that morning, not long after a nearby pizza restaurant was
robbed, police said.
   Two daytime searches failed to locate the man, but repeated
sightings by station employees prompted the studio evacuation and
third search at about 8:30 p.m., Lt. Frank Kehoe said.

<HEAD>Ted Turner Enters New Arena _ Books</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ted Turner is about to take his first step into
the world of book publishing, but he isn't assuming the role of
giant-slayer this time out.
   Turner Publishing Inc. is beginning as a modest venture with
little of the brashness that has accompanied other Turner projects.
Turner's startup of Cable News Network 10 years ago, for instance,
included a prediction that newspapers would die out.
   ``We don't have any intention of becoming a Random House or
Simon &amp; Schuster. Publishing is not the main business of TBS, and
it never will be,'' said Michael Reagan, vice president and
publisher of Turner Publishing.
   Turner Publishing, a subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting System,
releases its first book, a coffee-table volume of Reagan's
photographs, next month. The book, ``Portrait of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland,'' is tied to a TBS mini-series.
   Most of what follows also will be tied to TBS programming,
especially the company's vast movie library.
   Set for a Valentine's Day release is ``Kisses,'' a photo
collection of silver screen smooches ranging from Clark Gable and
Vivien Leigh in ``Gone With the Wind'' to Groucho Marx and Margaret
Dumont in ``A Night at the Opera.'' TBS will show a one-hour
``Kisses'' special to coincide with thet book's release.
   The publishing company is the latest _ and smallest _ venture of
TBS. Its initial budget is less than $2 million, Reagan said.
   Turner Publishing evolved from the TBS chairman's creation of
the Turner Tomorrow Award, in which a $500,000 prize is offered for
a novel that addresses positive solutions to global problems.
   The award carries a promise to publish the winning manuscript
and, Reagan said, ``it became apparent we'd need a publishing
company.''

<HEAD>Miss America 1989 Hired as TV Reporter</HEAD>

   Miss America 1989, Gretchen Carlson, has
been hired as WRIC-TV's ``Neighborhood News'' reporter.
   She previously worked as a free-lance reporter and talk show
guest host for KSTP-TV in Minneapolis.
   ``Certainly Miss America helped bring (Miss Carlson) to our
attention, but I hired her as a reporter,'' said Wayne Lynch,
WRIC's news director. ``She certainly got a lot of on-camera
experience last year, but we're really trying to stay out of the
Miss America business here.''

   CBS News President David Burke said Aug. 23 he

<HEAD>Salembier Resigns as New York Post President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Post announced the resignation of
Valerie Salembier as president Aug. 23. Post owner and publisher
Peter Kalikow said he would reassume the title of president.
   Howard Rubenstein, spokesman for the newspaper, said Kalikow had
not asked Salembier to resign. He added that she was not leaving
for a specific position elsewhere.
   Kalikow bought the newspaper, then losing money, from Rupert
Murdoch in 1988. He hired Salembier, the former publisher of TV
Guide, the next year.
   Last November the Post discontinued its 8-month-old Sunday
edition, which failed to attract sufficient advertisers or readers
and lost millions of dollars.
