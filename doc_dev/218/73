   Agreement was reached Saturday on a $22 million
package of union concessions that will keep the New York Post
publishing and clears the way for owner Rupert Murdoch to sell the
paper.
   The agreement was reached at 1:50 a.m. after a final bargaining
session that began around 10 a.m. Friday.
   Murdoch had said the paper would close Friday unless the paper's
unions provided concessions he needed to sell the money-losing
paper to real estate developer Peter Kalikow.
   ``I want to say at this time that I wish Mr. Kalikow great,
successful publishing of the New York Post,'' Murdoch said in
announcing the agreement.
   ``He's a very ambitious man, as well as being a wealthy one. I
know that he is determined to make it successful,'' Murdoch said.
   ``He's getting the newspaper now in better shape, getting a
newspaper with a fine staff, wonderful executives, and I'm sure
that he needs nothing more than a new start under new leadership
and he goes ahead with that with my full blessing.''
   The agreement, slated to take effect March 7, is subject to the
auditing of the savings by Kalikow's company and fast ratification
by each of the 10 unions involved, officials said.
   The cost reductions amount to $10 million in the first year, $8
million in the second and $6 million in the third, with a $2
million across-the-board bonus for employees in the third year,
officials said.
   Murdoch had demanded concessions totaling $24 million over three
years to meet conditions of a deal to sell the Post for $37 million
to Kalikow.
   According to the agreement, the paper will save $22.5 million by
cutting 130 jobs, officials said. Murdoch contributed $3 million to
the package, raising the total beyond the $24 million mark and
allowing for the employees' raises, officials said.
   Union leader George McDonald thanked Murdoch for the $3 million
``to sweeten the pot.''
   Murdoch said the agreement resulted from good will on both sides.
   ``It has been a very difficult 12 days for all of us,'' he said.
   At the Post's offices, editors were preparing the Saturday
edition.
   Murdoch met earlier Friday with Kalikow, said union leader
George McDonald.
   The alternative was to fold the paper because of a federal
regulation barring Murdoch from owning a newspaper and TV station
in the same city. Murdoch owns WNYW in New York.
   On Friday morning, Murdoch had declared flatly that he would not
stop the clock to save the newspaper.
   On Wednesday, the unions put forward a proposal they said would
save $33 million, $9 million more than Murdoch demanded, and asked
that the extra money go into pay raises. On Thursday, management
knocked down $12 million of the package as non-negotiable under
terms of the deal with Kalikow.
   After 10 minutes with the negotiators at the Grand Hyatt Hotel
on Friday morning, Murdoch said the gap in the concessions package
amounted to $4 million over three years.
   The exact size of the gap was a major sticking point, along with
the union demand for raises for those workers who survived the cuts.
   Barry Lipton, president of The Newspaper Guild of New York, said
another problem was that management had increased the number of
jobs that would have to be pared. Initially the negotiators said
they were dealing with 116 reductions from a workforce of 1,200.
   While other union leaders went into small working groups to seek
a solution, the leader of the paper's drivers' union, Jerry Cronin,
said he was done talking unless he heard from management.
   If the Post went under, he said, ``it died at the hands of Mr.
Murdoch.''
   The union leaders consistently called on Kalikow to join the
talks, but he said the concessions had to be made with Murdoch for
the sale to go through.
   The contract with Kalikow gave Murdoch until Feb. 22 to
negotiate the union concessions.
   The Post, founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton, faced financial
problems from its earliest years but held on as paper after paper
in the city merged and then eventually shut down.
   Murdoch bought the afternoon tabloid from Dorothy Schiff in 1976
for about $31 million as he expanded his worldwide media holdings
from Australia and England into the United States.
   Under Murdoch, the paper turned from liberal to conservative on
the editorial page and became splashy and racy. The early edition
of Friday carried the front-page headline: ``Only Hours to Live
...'' to promote a story about the release of photographs taken of
Jennifer Levin a short time before she was killed in Central Park.
   Murdoch says he has lost nearly $150 million in 11 years of
operating the Post. He said Friday that current losses were running
$100,000 a day.
   Murdoch chose to sell the Post following a congressional rider
engineered by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., that blocked the Federal Communications
Commission from continuing to waive its rule barring ownership of
both a television station and a newspaper in the same city. Murdoch
owns WNYW-TV in New York.
   In Boston, where he faces the same situation, Murdoch has
indicated he'd sell his TV station and hold on to the Boston Herald.
