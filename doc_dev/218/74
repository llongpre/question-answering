   Noted sports columnist Peter Vecsey and 78 other
New York Post employees will leave the newspaper under a buyout
plan that was part of a $19 million union concession package
designed to keep the paper alive.
   The Newspaper Guild resignations, which were voluntary, mean the
Post will lose close to 200 of its 960 workers.
   Agreements reached last week called for 100 forced resignations
from the 263-member drivers union and five from the Post's 17 paper
handlers.
   All are to receive the same buyout package, which includes full
severance and an extra eight weeks pay they would have been
entitled to if the paper had closed.
   Post Editor Jerry Nachman said about half of the Guild
resignations were from the newsroom, which translates to about a
third of the news staff.
   ``It's not a number I like, or I'm happy with,'' he said.
   The newspaper had sought only 43 resignations from the Guild -
plus a 20 percent pay cut - to keep the paper running.
   But owner Peter Kalikow agreed in a last-minute compromise to
accept however many voluntary resignations were tendered. Anyone
choosing to resign by 5 p.m. Wednesday would get the same
termination and severance pay as if the paper had closed.
   The Guild resignations included people from editorial,
advertising, circulation, and accounting, although a breakdown by
department was not immediately available.
   The total cost of the 79 resignations to the Post was being
tabulated, Post spokesman Howard Rubinstein said.
   ``Some highly talented individuals have elected to depart,''
Post spokesman Howard Rubinstein said.
   But, he added, Kalikow ``is extremely confident that they will
continue to turn out an exciting newspaper that will have a major
impact on the city.''
   Thomas Pennacchio, Guild secretary-treasurer, said the newspaper
most likely would have to hire more people to replace any
overabundance of buyouts.
   ``The sense is that some people want to leave because they can't
afford the 20 percent cut,'' Pennachio said. ``Some are leaving
because they think the Post won't last long.''
   The Guild had been the holdout among 11 unions that gave Kalikow
more than $19 million in concessions he demanded from them to
eliminate his $27 million worth of annual red ink.
   Vecsey, whose gossipy, acerbic column was closely followed by
fans of professional basketball, will begin a sports column at USA
Today on Oct. 1.
   Post vice president Peter Faris said Vecsey's contract expires
in November and the Post did not match other offers he received.
   He said Vecsey's resignation was ``divorced from the buyout
scenario although as a Guild member he is availing himself of the
opportunity.''
   Vecsey also recently signed to be a reporter on NBC's NBA
pregame show, ``The Insiders.''
