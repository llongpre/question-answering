   A law that barred publisher Rupert Murdoch
from continuing to own television stations and newspapers in the
same city was struck down today as unconstitutional by a federal
appeals court.
   The divided panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
voided a provision passed by Congress late last year that would
force Murdoch to sell the Boston Herald or WFXT-TV in that city by
June 30 to comply with rules that forbid single ownership of a
newspaper and a television station in one city.
   The 2-1 court decision does not affect Murdoch's $37 million
sale of the New York Post to real estate developer Peter Kalikow, a
deal that was spurred by the law's enactment as part of a massive
spending bill.
   In his contract to sell the Post, Murdoch retained the right to
make the first offer for the paper if Kalikow should decide to
sell. Howard J. Rubenstein, spokesman for both men, said the
contract obliges Kalikow to allow Murdoch to make a ``first offer''
for the paper, but does not oblige Kalikow to accept it.
   But Lawrence Kessler, general counsel for News America, said
Murdoch was not contemplating repurchasing the Post, which Kalikow
says he is committed to turning into a profitable newspaper.
Kessler also said he was ``heartened and encouraged that the Court
of Appeals shared our concern for the protection of publishers'
constitutional rights.''
   The court's ruling could enable Murdoch to retain temporarily
ownership of both his Boston media outlets if the Federal
Communications Commission extends his waiver from the enforcement
of the common-ownership rule.
   The court ordered the FCC to consider Murdoch's application to
extend the temporary waiver that he has held since 1986.
   Murdoch charged that the law forbidding the FCC to extend his
temporary waivers for both the New York Post and the Boston Herald
was politically motivated and amounted to an unconstitutional
attempt to silence criticism of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., by
the Herald.
   The court ruled that the provision of a massive spending bill
was unconstitutional because it singled out Murdoch's News America
Inc.
   While the court declined to inquire into Congress's motives, it
concluded that the provison ``strikes at Murdoch with the precision
of a laser beam,'' and therefore violates the equal protection
clause of the Constitution.
   The amendment to the spending bill prohibited the FCC from
extending temporary waivers to the common-ownership rules. It was
sponsored by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. and supported by Kennedy.
   The court did not rule on the merits of any claim that Murdoch's
News America Publishing Inc. should retain ownership of both the
Herald and WFXT-TV. But the judges cleared the way for Murdoch to
seek an extension of the June 30 deadline for complying with the
common-ownership rules.
   Murdoch has indicated he wanted to retain the Herald and sell
the television station if forced to do so.
   The court ruled that because Murdoch's company was the sole
holder of temporary waivers specified in the Hollins amendment, the
law was aimed solely at him.
   Because the law appears to serve no legitimate purpose except to
prohibit Murdoch from obtaining extensions of his waivers, it
unconstitutionally singled him out, the court said.
   ``Congress's exclusive focus on a single party clearly
implicates values similar to those behind the constitutional
proscription of Bills of Attainder,'' Judge Stephen Williams wrote
in an opinion joined by Judge Laurence Silberman. Such bills are
aimed at specific individuals.
   ``The safeguards of a pluralistic political system are often
absent when the legislature zeroes in on a small class of
citizens,'' he wrote.
   ``Nowhere are the protections of the equal protection clause
more critical than when legislation singles out one or a few for
uniquely disfavored treatment,'' Williams said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who had the legislation
attached to the spending bill, said in a statement that the court's
decision does not mean Murdoch should retain ownership of his
Boston newspaper and television station.
   ``Nothing in the Constitution or even the court's decision says
that Rupert Murdoch is entitled to be the only newspaper owner in
American who can buy a broadcasting station and keep his newspaper
in the same community,'' Kennedy said.
   He said he continues to believe ``that Congress was on sound
constitutional grounds when it adopted the provision, and that the
right of Congress to take this action will be vindicated by the
Supreme Court if the parties appeal today's decision.''
