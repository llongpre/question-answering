   Rupert Murdoch vowed to scrap the sale of the New York Post to Peter S. Kalikow and close the newspaper on Feb. 19 unless workers accept a demand for $24 million in pay cuts, a three-year salary freeze and staff reductions of 77. 

   Mr. Murdoch presented the demands at a meeting here yesterday morning with union officials. 
Following that meeting, union leaders said that workers will try to acquire the tabloid through a trust in partnership with another publisher who had sought to buy the Post from Mr. Murdoch. 
They also vowed to file unfair labor practice charges against Mr. Murdoch with the National Labor Relations Board. 

   Theodore Kheel, a labor lawyer and adviser to the union, said one bidder earlier proposed to share any future profits with workers in return for concessions. 
Another possible buyer proposed giving workers a 20% stake in the Post, said Mr. Kheel. 
He declined to identify the parties. 

   In a statement, however, Village Voice owner Leonard Stern, who also was a contender to buy the Post, said, "If the facts or circumstances change, we would reconsider the situation." 

   But Mr. Murdoch ruled out an offer from workers. 
"It's too late," he said in a statement. 
"The door is closed." 

   As previously reported, Mr. Kalikow refused to agree to operate the paper for at least three years, a commitment that Mr. Murdoch had sought. 

   Mr. Kheel, the unions' adviser, said an Employee Stock Ownership Plan would have a better chance of acquiring the paper, were it not for the Feb. 19 deadline. 
He said Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust Co. have said it is feasible to raise the necessary financing. 
Any publisher who became a partner with the employee trust would be asked to repay the loan. 
The publisher would receive certain tax advantages, Mr. Kheel said. 

   The rapid developments came a day after Mr. Murdoch announced an agreement to sell the Post to Mr. Kalikow, a real estate developer, for $37 million, if the unions granted concessions. 
At yesterday's meeting, Mr. Murdoch presented details of the concessions. 
He told labor officials that the agreement gives Mr. Kalikow the right to drop the transaction if workers don't agree to accept the cost-saving moves by Feb. 19. 

   The concessions would be granted over three years. 
The wage cuts would total 12%, with pay cuts of $8 million a year. 
Production workers and newspaper deliverers who agree to leave would receive bonuses of $35,000. 
Employees represented by the Newspaper Guild, including reporters and advertising salespeople, who agree to leave would receive severance pay. 
During the third year of the labor contract, full-time regular employees would share in a bonus of $2 million. 

   "At this point, whether or not the Post survives is entirely up to cooperation from our unions," Mr. Murdoch said. 
In December, the publisher received a one-year wage freeze and other cost-savings measures from the Post's unions that one labor official said totaled $8 million. 

   Mr. Murdoch, who also owns WNYW-TV in New York, must sell the Post to comply with federal regulations barring a single owner of a newspaper and broadcast property in the same city. 
He had been granted a waiver to dispose of one of the holdings by March 6. 
Mr. Murdoch, who also owns a newspaper and TV station in Boston, is proceeding with a federal lawsuit to challenge the cross-ownership rule. 

   "I felt very strongly that the unions would be blamed," if the paper eventually closed, said George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, a union umbrella group. 
He said workers, who had lobbied politicians to give Mr. Murdoch more time to sell the Post, had been betrayed and "used by him to get his price." 

   Mr. Kheel, the unions' adviser, said labor laws require unions and management to bargain on wages, working conditions and similar matters in good faith. 

   Jerry Cronin, president of the newspaper deliverers union, walked out of the meeting with Mr. Murdoch. 
Standing on a loading platform addressing newspaper truck drivers, he said, "Given an opportunity to bargain, I think we can cut a deal." 
He added: "I'd endorse anything that puts a real publisher here who showed a commitment." 
From the crowd, the truck drivers yelled, "You're absolutely right, Jerry! 
We're with you."
