IN A desperate attempt to save two struggling New York tabloids, the
bankrupt owner of the New York Post yesterday offered to buy the New York
Daily News.
The News is owned by Maxwell Communications, and filed for the protection of
US bankruptcy laws last year soon after the death of Mr Robert Maxwell.
Mr Peter Kalikow, the millionaire property developer and owner of the Post
who filed for personal bankruptcy in August 1991, would not reveal whether
he would merge the two newspapers, but said that 'the surest, and perhaps
only, opportunity for the Daily News' survival lies in combination with the
New York Post'.
Details of Mr Kalikow's offer were not available.
The Post's publisher said he would not discuss terms and conditions until he
had reviewed the financial information available to prospective buyers of
the News.
Any acquisition would have to be approved by Mr Kalikow's main bank lenders
and creditors.
