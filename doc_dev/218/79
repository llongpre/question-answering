   It's crunch time in New York's newspaper wars
and thousands of jobs and some long journalistic traditions hang in
the balance.
   The economy, combined with the competition, is threatening two
of the city's tabloids.
   The no-holds-barred New York Post, which has suffered losses for
years, says that the hemorrhaging must end and that it will shut
down with Saturday's edition unless its unions agree to more than
$19 million in concessions.
   At the money-losing Daily News, months-long labor negotiations
appear stalemated. Management has made extensive preparations for a
strike. The unions continue working but are urging advertisers to
boycott the paper.
   ``There is an adequate market here for at least one (tabloid)
paper, possibly two,'' said Ken Noble, a media analyst with Paine
Webber.
   Which would be fine for the two newspapers if New York Newsday,
a third tabloid also losing money, did not have a profitable
parent, the Times Mirror Co., patiently waiting for the market to
sort itself out.
   The city's fourth major daily, The New York Times, is
profitable, though less so than a year ago.
   The Times also will seek concessions from the unions to the
extent that they involve the same economic conditions that have
affected the Post and News, said William Adler, a Times spokesman.
   All four newspapers are suffering from an unofficial recession
slamming the Northeast that has retail advertising down.
   The Post _ founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton _ has the worst
economic problems. Three owners in the past two decades have lost
millions of dollars. Now its already slim ad linage is down.
   ``They're the most likely to go out of business,'' Noble said.
   On Sept. 4, Post Publisher Peter S. Kalikow told the paper's
unions that he was losing $27 million a year on the tabloid and
that he needed concessions from them of $17.4 million in payroll
and $1.9 million in benefits.
   He set an 8 p.m. Friday deadline for an agreement. Otherwise, he
said the paper would report in its Saturday editions that it was
closing and 960 employees would be out of work.
   ``He did not want to read about the future of the New York Post
in another newspaper,'' said Howard Rubenstein, a Post spokesman.
   With headlines like ``READ MY LIPS: I LIED'' and ``UP YOURS!''
to Saddam Hussein, and its all-time classic about a tavern killing
_ ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' _ the Post strikes a chord that
summons readers to newsstands. But its circulation is now about
505,000, down from 900,000 in the past decade.
   ``The New York Post has been very honest in coming to us with
this economic problem,'' said George McDonald, president of the
Allied Printing Trades Council, an umbrella group representing nine
unions at the Post. ``We're going to do everything possible to help
the Post stay in business.''
   The News too is claiming losses _ $115 million from 1979 to 1989
on revenues of $4 billion _ but also is trying to undo what it says
are archaic work rules that result in overstaffing on the presses
and among drivers.
   In the last decade, its circulation has dropped about 700,000 to
1,180,000.
   The News has said it needs new color presses to replace its
30-to 40-year-old equipment and stay competitive. While the unions,
which represent about 3,000 workers, recognize the need for new
presses, they claim the News' parent, the Tribune Co. of Chicago,
is out to break them in order to sell the paper.
   Daily News unions point to the hiring of King and Ballow, a
Nashville, Tenn., law firm they say has a reputation for
union-busting; the hiring of replacement workers, and the training
of management to run the presses if workers strike.
   Management at the News has already told the unions that it
expects concessions equal to anything granted the Post. To put on
the pressure, the unions are urging advertisers to boycott the News
until a settlement is reached.
   ``It's a fight to the death over at the New York News right
now,'' said Noble.
   New York Newsday, meanwhile, has trucks ready to roll if the
News folds or goes on strike or if the Post expires, he said.
Newsday, with its circulation of 225,000, ``would leap into the
breach. They sure would,'' Noble said.
