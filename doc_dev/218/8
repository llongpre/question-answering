   Jane Amsterdam, editor of the New York Post for
11 months, has quit her $200,000-a-year job, two of its competitors
reported today.
   A source close to the paper, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press today that no formal action
had been taken but was expected early next week.
   ``She is not yet not the editor,'' the source said.
   A spokesman for the Post, Howard Rubenstein, would neither
confirm nor deny the reports. He said a statement by Post owner
Peter S. Kalikow may be issued later today or Tuesday.
   ``She's still working for the paper, there's no question about
that. She's still the editor'' today, Rubenstein said. He would not
comment on her plans.
   Amsterdam's secretary at the Post said Amsterdam was not in the
office today and was not expected. The secretary said all calls on
the subject were being forwarded to Rubenstein.
   Amsterdam, 37, became one of six women editing a U.S. newspaper
with a circulation larger than 100,000 on June 13. She had a
three-year contract.
   She previously was editor of Manhattan, inc. magazine and worked
for The Washington Post.
   ``There is a parting of the ways, but Jane has not been fired,''
a source closely connected with the Post told New York Newsday.
   The Daily News also quoted a source as saying, ``There was a
mutual parting of the ways.''
   Both reports said Amsterdam's resignation may have resulted over
the decision to scale back the newspaper's 11-week-old Sunday
edition.
   The Post announced it was reducing the paper to a single section
and cutting the price from $1 to 40 cents due to a lack of
advertising in the Sunday section.
   Amsterdam was heavily involved in creating the Sunday edition.
   She would be the second top news executive to leave the Post
recently. Publisher Peter Price, 48, left the newspaper last month
to begin a national sports newspaper.
