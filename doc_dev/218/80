   Unions representing New York Post workers proposed cost-saving steps that the publisher called "a significant move" toward reaching a settlement that would result in the newspaper's sale to developer Peter S. Kalikow. 

   Under the proposal, which the unions presented yesterday, the work force would be reduced by 116 for a saving of $19 million over three years, a Post spokesman said. 
The paper has about 1,200 employees. 

   The unions also proposed eliminating certain overtime payments for an additional saving of $12 million over three years. 
In return for the overtime change, the unions requested a wage increase, the spokesman said. 
He said the Post wouldn't accept the overtime proposal. 

   Rupert Murdoch, the paper's owner, has agreed to sell the Post to Mr. Kalikow for $37 million, but the agreement depends on union concessions totaling $24 million over three years. 
Mr. Murdoch had proposed a wage cut of 12% and a reduction of about 80 jobs, and vowed to close the paper tomorrow if an agreement on concessions isn't reached. 

   The spokesman said that if the union's job reduction proposal is accepted, the wage cut would likely be much smaller than 12%. 

   Patrick Purcell, the Post's publisher, called the proposal a "hopeful sign" and said the paper is considering it.
