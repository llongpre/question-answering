   The New York Post is losing $25 million a year
and could close unless its unions agree to cost-cutting measures,
union and management representatives say.
   Post general manager Richard T. Nasti said after a meeting with
leaders of the paper's 10 unions Tuesday that the paper has set
Sept. 15 as a deadline for reaching agreement. He added that he is
optimistic the deadline will be met.
   Nasti said there is ``a $25 million annual gap that must be
filled to allow (Publisher) Peter Kalikow to continue publishing
the paper.'' But, in a statement, he did not say what would happen
if the deadline were not met.
   Theodore Kheel, a labor mediator and adviser to the unions'
Allied Printing Trades Council who was at the meeting, said it was
his understanding that ``if they are not able to reach agreement
with the unions on savings of some $17 million, they would suspend
publication and give employees a 60-day notice.''
   Kheel said workers would be paid during the 60 days, but the
paper could cease publication immediately on Sept. 15.
   He said $17 million is the amount the Post hopes to save through
cost-cutting measures affecting its unions, with the rest to be
made up in other ways.
   The Allied is an umbrella group for the 10 unions representing
900 employees at the Post, which is the nation's oldest daily. The
tabloid, founded in 1801, has a circulation of 505,000, behind the
Daily News and The New York Times.
   The Post offered to open its books to its unions, and meetings
were scheduled for today and Thursday to discuss cost-cutting
proposals.
   Kalikow bought the Post from Rupert Murdoch in 1988 when the
paper was losing about $3 million a month. Concessions from the
unions were part of the package that Murdoch had to achieve to meet
Kalikow's terms.
   The unions also are involved in negotiations with the Daily News
over cost-saving measures the newspaper says are crucial to its
survival.
