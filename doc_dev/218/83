   The New York Post announced it will stop
publishing its seven-month-old Sunday edition after Nov. 26 because
it hasn't attracted enough advertisers or readers.
   The Sunday Post first hit the stands March 5 amid a blitz of
television ads and other promotions billing the paper as ``a cure
for the common Sunday.''
   The first issues included supplements devoted to books, travel
and television, and long feature stories in the news section. Owner
Peter Kalikow said the first four weeks of ads for the Sunday Post
were sold out.
   But advertising quickly declined and the Sunday Post lost
millions of dollars within a few months.
   On May 28 the paper was reduced to a single section and the
price was slashed from $1 to 40 cents.
   In announcing the decision to cease publication of the Sunday
Post, Kalikow said Thursday the Sunday paper attracted 250,000
readers.
   ``This is still nowhere near the over 500,000 readers who
purchase the paper on a daily basis,'' Kalikow said in a news
release. ``The circulation and advertising revenue mix on Sunday
simply does not lend itself to continued publication of this
edition. The economics just aren't there.''
   Kalikow also said he wanted to ``focus our attention and
resources on ensuring the long-term profitability and viability of
our six-day product.''
   The city's other daily newspapers, The New York Times, the Daily
News and New York Newsday, all publish Sunday editions.
   Kalikow bought the Post from Rupert Murdoch in 1988.
