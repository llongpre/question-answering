   The rumored tabloid headline ``BANG, WE'RE
DEAD'' was shelved for ``AIN'T OVER YET!'' as the nation's
longest-running daily newspaper dodged a bullet with help from its
unions.
   Post owner Peter Kalikow said the 505,000-circulation paper
known for its racy headlines would have to close Saturday without
union concessions because it has been losing $27 million a year.
   Ten of the New York Post's 11 unions agreed late Friday to a $19
million concession package that would eliminate jobs and shorten
work weeks.
   The holdout was the Newspape Guild, which represents 352
white-collar employees, mainly reporters and advertising staff. Its
negotiating committee voted 7-3 to reject the concession deal.
   ``They were saying, `Shut it down,''' said Thomas Pennacchio,
secretary-treasurer of Guild Local 3.
   Kalikow said the paper would publish until the Guild's members
voted on the concessions. A vote on whether to accept elimination
of 43 jobs and four work days a week was scheduled for Monday.
   ``I feel optimistic that when the members see it they will
approve it,'' said Post owner Peter Kalikow. ``If they turn it
down, the paper will stop publishing immediately.''
   The Post said in Saturday's editions the concessions from its
960 employees include 100 fewer truck driver jobs, down from 263;
its 70 printers cutting to a four-day work week and five fewer
paper handlers, cutting from a staff of 17.
   After the agreement was announced, a cheer erupted in the Post's
newsroom, where workers had gathered for what might have been their
final edition. Two versions were prepared and newsroom scuttlebutt
predicted the ``BANG, WE'RE DEAD'' headline if no agreement had
been reached.
   The Post, founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1801, was sold to
heiress Dorothy Schiff in 1939. Australian media baron Rupert
Murdoch bought it in 1976 and sold it to Kalikow in 1988.
   The possible salvation of the 189-year-old paper aside, one
writer chafed at the idea of a four-day work week.
   ``What am I supposed to do, drive a cab on the fifth day?''
Peter Moses said.
   Guild president Barry Lipton, who supported the offer, said ``It
was the best we could make. ... I hope that the sense of the
membership is to swallow what may be a bitter pill.''
   Drivers gathered at the Post loading dock Saturday, angry over
looming cuts and Kalikow's tactics.
   ``Today is no celebration,'' said driver Stan Infante. ``People
are losing jobs.''
