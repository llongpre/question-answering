   NEW YORK -- Two troubled tabloid newspapers, the Daily
News and the New York Post, made reassurances that they will
keep publishing, at least for the short-term.
   At the Daily News, Kevin Maxwell, son of the late Robert
Maxwell, met with about 150 representatives of advertisers in
New York to assure them the paper was on firm footing. Two
weeks ago the Daily News, part of the crumbling Maxwell
family empire, filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

   The Daily News said it had $6 million in cash on hand, and
would have $8 million by the end of the month, excluding
receipts from December advertisers. A spokesman said the
paper also had successfully renegotiated several of its
suppliers' contracts at lower rates.
   The paper also released a letter from Bank of New York,
showing that the paper's employee pension funds and group
insurance plans hadn't been tampered with or looted. The late
Mr. Maxwell is suspected of looting at least $500 million in
pension funds from his two public companies.
   At the New York Post, owner Peter S. Kalikow, a real
estate developer whose personal holdings are also in Chapter
11, said the paper had received a $5 million line of credit
from Bankers Trust Co., which originally financed his $37
million acquisition of the Post in 1988.
   He said the money would be used to operate the daily
newspaper. While the Post is carrying more advertising now
than at any other time this year, advertisers won't pay their
bills until January, he said. Mr. Kalikow also said the Post
would be profitable in 1991 and that he hopes to restructure
$20 million of Bankers Trust debt related to the acquisition.
Bankers Trust couldn't be reached for comment.
