   The unions at the New York Post conditionally
agreed Friday to yield $17 million in concessions that the Post
says it needs to stay in business through next week.
   The unions said they believed the Post needs concessions and
agreed in principle to negotiate them. They also asked for and got
an outside audit of the Post's books and urged the paper not to
change its contracts with labor.
   ``We are going to do everything possible to help the Post stay
in business,'' said George McDonald, president of the Allied
Printing Trades Council, an umbrella group for unions at the
tabloid. ``If we happen to fail, neither side is going to blame the
other.''
   Post spokesman Howard Rubenstein said changing the contract
would not be necessary as long as the newspaper got economic relief.
   ``We continue to be optimistic that working with our unions will
lead to a resolution,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, Post Publisher Peter S. Kalikow said the paper was
running an annual deficit of $25 million to $27 million and that he
needed the unions to kick in $17 million in concessions or the
paper would close by Sept. 15.
   If the unions are satisfied with a weekend audit by Peat Marwick
Main &amp; Co., negotiations could begin Monday or Tuesday. Any cuts
would be effective for the life of the current contracts, which
expire March 30.
   Since Tuesday, the unions have been meeting with Post officials,
learning what each group would have to sacrifice.
   The Newspaper Guild, which represents 337 reporters, editors,
sales and clerical workers, was asked to take a 30 percent pay cut
and drop about 40 jobs from its jurisdiction, union members said.
   Guild President Barry Lipton said the pay cut actually amounted
to a 46 percent cut: a 30 percent cut, a 2{-hour increase in the
work week (equalling an 11 percent cut) and a 5 percent hike in
workers' out-of-pocket health costs.
   At a raucous membership meeting Thursday night, 300 members
unanimously rejected the package as ``obscene and degrading,''
Lipton said.
   Michael Alvino, president of the drivers' union, said his union
was asked to take $8 million in cuts or 54 percent of its payroll,
the largest hit asked of any union. He said the Post asked for
personnel cuts and slashed overtime.
   After assessing the proposals each union was given, the Allied
met Friday with Daniel F. Cremins, Post executive vice president,
and Richard T. Nasti, vice president. Lipton said the 40-job
jurisdiction cut was dropped.
   The unions told Cremins and Nasti that they, too, wanted certain
concessions in order to negotiate.
   Aside from Peat Marwick's audit and the contract remaining
intact, the unions also want stock in the Post and at least one
seat on the board of directors, said Theodore Kheel, an unpaid
legal adviser to the unions.
   ``I think the Post will agree to this. There was no violent
reaction'' at Friday's meeting when the items were brought up,
Kheel said.
   Kheel said they wanted the stock and board seat because they
would expect The New York Times, which is financially healthy, to
seek concessions equal to any the unions give the Post.
   Kheel said it would, in effect, block the Times from asking for
concessions since the Times is unlikely to place any union members
on its board.
