Photo, N.Y. Post President: TV Guide Publisher Valerie B. Salembier has been 
named president of the New York Post, the money-losing tabloid that was bought 
a year ago by Peter S. Kalikow. She will replace Publisher Peter Price, who 
left to become a partner in an international television and radio company. 
Salembier, 43, a former senior vice president of advertising at USA Today, will 
assume Price's responsibilities. She takes on the title of president from 
Kalikow, while Kalikow will assume the title of publisher and retains his 
position as chairman. United Press International
