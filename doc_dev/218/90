   New York Post management told its unions Tuesday
that the paper had to have a cost cutting plan by the end of next
week and indicated the continued publication of the nation's oldest
daily was at stake.
   Post Vice President and General Manager Richard T. Nasti said
after a meeting with leaders of the paper's 10 unions that the
paper has set Sept. 15 as a deadline for reaching agreement. He
said he was optimistic the deadline will be met.
   Nasti didn't say specifically what would happen if the deadline
weren't met.
   Theodore Kheel, a labor mediator and unpaid adviser a union
group who attended the meeting, said he understood that management
would suspend publication Sept 15 if it couldn't reach agreement
with the unions on $17 million in savings.
   The paper's 900 employees and 10 unions are represented by the
Allied Printing Trades Council.
   The council's president, George McDonald, said management ``told
us they are losing money, and they are looking for some relief from
the unions.'' The losses have been blamed in part on the city's
slumping economy.
   Publisher Peter Kalikow called the meeting and said through a
spokesman the session was ``very cordial, not a hostile meeting,
with both sides trying to work it out.''
   The Post offered to open its books to its 10 unions, and
meetings with individual unions are scheduled throughout Wednesday
and Thursday.
   In a prepared statement, Nasti said management officials would
meet with each union ``for lengthy and detailed explanations of
their cost saving proposals.''
   ``This newspaper has served New York for 190 years and through a
cooperative effort between labor and management it will continue to
serve New York for another 190 years,'' he said.
   Kalikow must find $25 million in annual savings to continue
publishing the paper, Nasti said.
   Kheel said the $17 million figure is the amount the Post hopes
to save through cost-cutting measures affecting its unions, with
the rest to be made up in other ways.
   Kalikow took over the Post from Rupert Murdoch in 1988 when the
paper was losing about $3 million monthly. Concessions from the
unions were part of the package that Murdoch had to achieve in
order to meet Kalikow's terms.
   Those same unions are now involved in intense negotiations with
the rival Daily News of New York. The News is seeking contracts
that would allow management to institute a variety of cost saving
measures that the News says are critical to its survival.
