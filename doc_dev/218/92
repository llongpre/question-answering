MR CONRAD Black, the Canadian publisher who owns the Daily Telegraph, has
been given one month to see if he can forge a deal to buy the New York Daily
News, the paper said yesterday, Reuter reports.
The Daily News, currently under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law, has been
seeking a new buyer since the publishing empire of Mr Robert Maxwell, its
last owner, collapsed last year.
Mr Black, who has extensive interests in Canada and also owns the Jerusalem
Post, was given the go-ahead to begin negotiations to buy the paper at a
meeting with the Daily News management, unions and creditors on Tuesday.
The paper said the go-ahead did not constitute approval of Mr Black's
proposal to buy it, but one member of the 'working group' at the meeting was
quoted by the paper as saying that the decision meant that the Canadian
publisher has now become the front-runner.
Mr Black was given four weeks to see if he could fashion a deal through
Hollinger, his Vancouver-based company. If he fails, the working group said
there were other alternatives.
One was to turn to Mr Mort Zuckerman, a real estate developer who has also
made a bid for the paper. Also there was speculation that Mr Black might be
interested in a joint deal with Mr Peter Kalikow, the owner of the New York
Post. But it is thought that Mr Kalikow and Mr Black's discussions have
ended.
New York newspaper industry sources said a deal to buy the Daily News could
total about Dollars 100m (Pounds 56.4m) - about Dollars 30m to pay off
creditors, another Dollars 30m to buy out staff and Dollars 40m in working
capital to modernise the paper.
