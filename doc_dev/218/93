   Two ranking editors at the New York Post left
the newspaper last week.
   No replacements have been named for James A. Fabris, one of the
paper's two managing editors, and Metropolitan Editor Dick Belsky,
said Post spokesman Gary Lewi. ``It is my understanding that is was
mutually agreed that it was time for them to pursue other careers
outside the Post,'' he told The New York Times.
   Fabris came to the Post under the ownership of Rupert Murdoch,
who sold the paper to its current owner, Peter S. Kalikow, last
year. He shared the managing editor title with Lou Colasuonno.
Belsky had worked 19 years for the newspaper.
