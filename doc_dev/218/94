<LEADPARA>  Peter S. Kalikow, one of New York's biggest real estate developers and the
publisher of the New York Post, is fighting to keep control of his empire.;

<TEXT>     Under a plan that Kalikow said he intended to head off even if it meant
seeking protection in bankruptcy court, the lenders are trying to force
Kalikow to put the newspaper and nearly everything else he owns into a pool
that would be controlled by the banks.;    The pool would be used to shore up
uncollateralized and undersecured loans to the developer, some of which he has
failed to pay off.;    Kalikow, who has been regarded as one of the richest
men in the country, owes more than $1 billion to more than a dozen lenders
including banks like Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and Manufacturers Hanover.  </TEXT>
