Dorothy Schiff, the heiress who bought and then masterminded the New York Post 
for 37 years, molding it into a showcase of liberal thinking, died of cancer 
Wednesday in her New York City home. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
Granddaughter of banking magnate and philanthropist Jacob Henry Schiff, she 
bought the Post in 1939 at the request of her second husband, George Backer, 
and sold it to Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch in 1976 for $31 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Post, sold again to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow last year, was 
begun by Alexander Hamilton in 1801. 
</P>
<P>
The tabloid owes its longevity partly to "Dolly" Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survived Strike 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, the Post survived a lengthy strike that spelled the demise of all but 
three New York dailies -- the Post, the Times and the Daily News. Miss Schiff, 
after a punishing 86-day shutdown, broke with her colleagues in the New York 
Publishers' Assn. and resumed publication. 
</P>
<P>
"Often voted least likely to succeed in New York's competitive journalistic 
climate," Newsweek observed, "she outmaneuvered such moneyed rivals as Hearst's 
Journal-American, Scripps-Howard's World Telegram and Sun, and John Hay 
Whitney's Herald Tribune, and in the end outlasted them." 
</P>
<P>
One of the world's few women to own a newspaper and New York's first woman 
publisher, Miss Schiff was considered a model for the character Margaret 
Pynchon, publisher of the fictional Los Angeles Tribune on the 1977-82 
television drama "Lou Grant." 
</P>
<P>
Although from a traditionally Republican family, Miss Schiff became a New Deal 
Democrat, working for social welfare organizations and befriending Franklin and 
Eleanor Roosevelt. At one point, she persuaded Mrs. Roosevelt to write a column 
for the Post. 
</P>
<P>
Although she publicly denied any romance or affair with the Depression-era 
President, Miss Schiff stated for a 1976 authorized biography called "Men, 
Money and Magic" that F.D.R. "was a warm, sexy guy who was in an isolated 
position and was looking for a turn-on" and "probably saw me as a sex object." 
</P>
<P>
She told the book's author, Jeffrey Potter, that her then-husband Backer was 
"proud" of her seven-year relationship with Roosevelt, which ended in 1943 when 
she decided his "sun-god quality wasn't working for me all of a sudden." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Honest Unionism' 
</P>
<P>
Miss Schiff described the Post's editorial policy, which created a following in 
New York's liberal middle class, as advocating "honest unionism, social reform 
and humane government programs" and speaking out for "the causes of civil 
rights and civil liberties." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her wealthy family's charitable philanthropies, she embraced New Deal 
programs, commenting: "Taxes seem to me to be far less demoralizing than 
private charities. I am glad to be taxed because it is the least devastating 
way to meet social needs both for the underprivileged and over-privileged." 
</P>
<P>
Her penurious policies with the newspaper were legendary, and the Post became 
known for producing the most with the smallest staff and the most antiquated 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced," she said, "that a newspaper must make its own way. Kept 
organs are just no good." 
</P>
<P>
When the paper suffered financial losses shortly after she bought it, she 
advocated comic strips, columns, features and a tabloid format. Backer's 
objections led eventually to his replacement on the paper and in her life. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Schiff was born March 11, 1903, in New York City to Mortimer Leo Schiff, 
who was a banking partner of his father in Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co., and Adele A. 
Neustadt Schiff. She attended the private Brearley School, but after one year 
at Bryn Mawr College was asked not to return because of her low grades. 
</P>
<P>
She debuted in 1921 and two years later married the first of her four husbands, 
broker Richard B. W. Hall. She divorced him in 1932 and married Backer, a 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, Miss Schiff divorced Backer, assumed the titles of owner and publisher 
of the Post, and married the career newsman whom she had promoted to the 
paper's executive editor, Theodore Olin Thackrey. 
</P>
<P>
That marriage ended because of political differences stated strongly in print. 
In 1948, the couple both opposed Harry S. Truman as President, but Thackrey 
touted Progressive candidate Henry Wallace and Miss Schiff went with Republican 
Thomas E. Dewey. 
</P>
<P>
"A competent and fairly liberal Republican," she wrote, "will make a better 
President than an incompetent and inconsistent Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
From 1951 to 1958, Miss Schiff wrote a column called "Publisher's Notebook" and 
later "Dear Reader," but told an interviewer: "I write scared, with a 
dictionary beside me." She abandoned the effort as too time consuming. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dabbled in Radio Stations 
</P>
<P>
Before buying controlling interest in the Post, Miss Schiff dabbled in radio 
stations in the 1930s -- WLIB in Brooklyn, KMTR in Los Angeles and KYA in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, she married her fourth husband, petroleum executive Rudolf G. 
Sonneborn. That marriage also ended in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Schiff is survived by a son and daughter from her marriage to Hall, 
Mortimer W. Hall and Adele Hall Sweet, and a daughter from her marriage to 
Backer, Sarah-Ann Kramarsky, 15 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.
