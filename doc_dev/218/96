<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of the New York Post's nine labor unions were briefed today on the 
financial records of the newspaper before beginning round-the-clock 
negotiations to save the paper from closure next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Post management opened its financial records to the accounting firm of Peat 
Marwick over the weekend so the unions could verify publisher Peter Kalikow's 
claim that he is losing $27 million a year on the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Kalikow has said he expects the unions to make concessions totaling $17 million 
to $20 million so he can continue to publish the 189-year-old Post, the 
nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper.
