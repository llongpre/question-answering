   The owners of the New York business magazine
Manhattan, inc. and the men's fashion magazine M said Thursday the
publications would merge, with the first issue due in September.
   The new magazine will be called M inc. and is expected to sell
for $3, the cover price that M and Manhattan, inc. each sell
separately for now.
   ``This merger combines the lifestyle features of M with the
business orientation of Manhattan, inc.,'' said Michael Coady,
president of Fairchild Fashion and Merchandising Group, which
launched M in 1983.
   Coady said the readership ``will deliver the best upscale male
democraphics in publishing today.''
   D. Herbert Lipson, chairman of Metrocorp, Manhattan, inc.'s
publisher, said the merger makes sense from the point of view of
readers and advertisers.
   ``It brings together all interests of the successful,
well-heeled man, and it combines two groups of advertisers whose
demographic targets are similar,'' he said.
   A joint announcement said Lipson will be president of M inc. and
Jane F. Lane, currently M magazine's editor in chief, will be the
editor. The present editor of Manhattan, inc., Clay Felker, will
serve as editor at large and will work with Ms. Lane to develop the
magazine.
   The staffs of the two magazines will be joined and located at
the offices of Fairchild, which is a division of New York-based
Capital Cities-ABC Inc.
   Patricia J. Matson, a Cap Cities-ABC spokeswoman, said all
operations of the two magazines will be reviewed over the next few
months. She couldn't say whether any staff cuts are anticipated.
   The base circulation rate for the new magazine has been set at
200,000. The average circulation at launch is expected to be
245,000. Currently M has a circulation of 160,000 and Manhattan,
inc.'s is 115,000.
   Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. The announcement
said all ad contracts will be honored at the current rates.
   Some other Fairchild titles include Women's Wear Daily and W.
   Metrocorp, which began Manhattan, inc. in September 1984, also
publishes Boston Magazine and Philadelphia Magazine.
