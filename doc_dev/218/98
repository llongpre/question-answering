   News Corp.'s proposed $37.6 million sale of the New York Post to developer Peter Kalikow may have hit a snag, with one union contending that Mr. Kalikow "reneged" on certain guarantees to pay any future costs of closing the newspaper. 

   Guild members refused yesterday to ratify a labor contract with Australia-based News Corp., which is scheduled to relinquish ownership of the paper next week, said Joy Cook, head of the Post unit of the Newspaper Guild. 
The contract includes language from the sale that is said to pledge Mr. Kalikow to guaranteeing with his personal fortune the cost of closing the paper. 
Those costs have been estimated as high as $40 million. 

   The proposed contract with the Guild included certain concessions. 
It is understood that at least two other unions at the Post have accepted new contracts. 
A spokesman for Mr. Kalikow said last night that the issue isn't settled but that a settlement is close.
