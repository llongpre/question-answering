   Real estate developer and New York Post owner Peter
Kalikow filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code, in a move to thwart a
lender's aggressive tactics.
   Mr. Kalikow, once one of New York City's most successful
real estate men, ran into trouble when plunging property
values led his banks to refuse the rollover of several
personally guaranteed loans as they came due. He had been
negotiating with about a dozen banks to restructure $350
million in loans to real estate projects. The negotiations
were derailed this week, bankers said, when European American
Bank, a subsidiary of Dutch bank ABN Amro Holding N.V.,
indicated it would enforce a judgment against Mr. Kalikow and
seek to put a lien on his assets.

   With the Chapter 11 filing, Mr. Kalikow, in effect,
protects himself from such an action, gaining a 120-day
period to work out a reorganization plan with his creditors.
Before the filing, any reorganization had to be approved by
all Mr. Kalikow's lenders. Now, only two-thirds of the
creditors need to approve. The filing therefore gives Mr.
Kalikow breathing room, said Mr. Kalikow's attorney Ronald
Orr, of Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher. "The banks that caused this
have used up their threat," Mr. Orr said.
   In a statement, Mr. Kalikow stressed that his action
wouldn't affect the operations of the Post, or the majority
of his other assets. Mr. Kalikow's holdings include about a
dozen New York City buildings, hundreds of apartments and an
unfinished downtown Manhattan hotel.
   But media analysts said the Post, which is in a newspaper
war with the New York Daily News and New York Newsday, could
be hurt by negative perceptions of Mr. Kalikow's filing.
   Mr. Kalikow said in his statement, "I do this reluctantly
because I believe an equitable settlement plan could have and
should have been worked out since my assets still
substantially exceed my liabilities by $400 million." He
added, "Today's action has been forced by one banking
institution owed approximately $25 million."
   Bankers involved with the negotiations identified that
institution as EAB. In a statement, the Uniondale, N.Y., bank
cited a Nassau County Supreme Court finding in its favor,
adding, "However, Mr. Kalikow elected to voluntarily file for
personal bankruptcy in response to the decision."
   In the New York federal court filing, Mr. Kalikow claimed
a net worth of $491 million, with assets of $841.4 million
and liabilities of $350.2 million, of which $195 million is
unsecured. Mr. Kalikow's largest unsecured creditor is listed
as Bankers Trust New York Corp., which has $46 million
outstanding to the developer. That money is believed to have
helped fund Mr. Kalikow's investment in the Post.
   Other unsecured creditors include Manufacturers Hanover
Corp. ($31 million), Citibank, a unit of Citicorp ($26
million), EAB ($26 million), National Westminster Bank PLC
($15 million) and Marine Midland Bank Inc. ($15 million).
