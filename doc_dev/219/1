  [Abstract] The microbicidal effect of macrophages is 
primarily due to the functioning of lysosomes, and many 
researchers consider an elevated lysosome content and 
intensified secretion of lysosomal enzymes signs of macrophage 
activation. The participation of lysosomal enzymes in the 
intracellular killing process depends not only on their 
synthesis, however, but also on processes ensuring their contact 
with absorbed microorganisms, which is to say on the fusion of 
lysosomes with phagosomes. Evidence exists that fusion of 
lysosomes with phagosomes does not always guarantee 
intracellular killing. In particular, the reports regarding the 
relationship of the plague microbe Yersinia pestis 
with lysosomes have been contradictory. Consequently, a study 
was conducted to examine the effect of a vaccine strain of 
Yersinia pestis on the fusion of lysosomes with 
phagosomes in peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. Nonpedigree 
guinea pigs weighing 250 to 300 g each were immunized either 
subcutaneously or aerogenically with a vaccine strain of 
Yersinia pestis (10 guinea pigs were immunized in 
each case). Peritoneal and alveolar macrophages of the immunized 
animals were studied on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 after immunization 
to determine their lysosome content and the fusion of the 
lysosomes with phagosomes. The experiments established that the 
frequency of fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes in the alveolar 
macrophages was only half that in the peritoneal macrophages. 
Subcutaneous immunization stimulated the fusion of lysosomes and 
phagosomes in the peritoneal macrophages but not in the alveolar 
macrophages, whereas aerogenic vaccination stimulated the fusion 
of lysosomes with phagosomes in both types of macrophages. A 
correlation between the macrophages' ability to kill 
Yersinia pestis and the frequency of fusion of 
lysosomes with phagosomes was established. It was hypothesized 
that during endocytosis of plague microbe in unvaccinated guinea 
pigs, there occurs a suppression of the fusion of lysosomes with 
phagosomes that is much more pronounced in the case of alveolar 
macrophages than in the case of peritoneal macrophages. Figures
