   Two experimental vaccines protected lab animals
against a lethal dose of the bacteria that cause Legionnaires'
disease, raising hopes for a vaccine to protect humans, a researcher
says.
   Between 600 and 1,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease are reported
to the federal Centers for Disease Control each year. Estimates of
the actual number of cases range as high as 100,000 a year, said the
vaccine's developer, Dr. Marcus Horwitz of the University of
California, Los Angeles.
   ``It's clearly a major problem in hospitals,'' Horwitz said
Tuesday at a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology.
``It's a major cause of death from hospital-acquired pneumonia.''
   The first vaccine Horwitz developed consisted of a weakened,
mutant strain of the bacteria Legionella pneumophila, which causes
the deadly disease.
   Then Horwitz developed a vaccine consisting of a single chemical
from the virus. The single-molecule vaccine protected 21 of 26
guinea pigs from a lethal dose of Legionella bacteria.
   None of 26 unvaccinated guinea pigs survived after the same dose,
Horwitz said.
   Guinea pigs were used because they develop a disease similar to
Legionnaires' disease in humans, he said.
   Dr. Robert Breiman, a Legionnaires' disease expert at the CDC,
said the vaccine, if it ultimately proves successful in humans,
could be especially useful for the transplant recipients, cancer
patients, the elderly and people taking steroids.
   They all have weakened immune systems and are especially
susceptible to Legionnaires' disease, he said.
   Horwitz and his colleagues ``have very nice results,'' Breiman
said. The vaccines ``look like they protect animals very nicely
against Legionella.''
   ``It remains to be seen whether this sort of vaccine would
protect these people'' who are especially at risk, said Breiman, who
worked with Horwitz before going to the CDC. ``It's a long way to a
vaccine in humans.''
   Horwitz said it would be at least two or three years before he
was ready for a trial of the vaccine in humans.
   He said he was surprised that ``you can immunize an animal with a
single molecule.'' Such a vaccine should be safer, easier to use and
cheaper than the mutant bacteria vaccine.
   The molecule is called the major secretory protein, and its
function in Legionella infection is not understood, Horwitz said.
   He does have a good theory of how the vaccine works, however.
Legionella bacteria infect certain white blood cells called
monocytes and then hide inside where the body's immune system can't
find them.
   The immune system, primed by the vaccine, secretes substances
that change the monocytes in such a way that they lose most of their
ability to absorb iron as they normally do.
   Legionella bacteria depend on iron, and when they don't get it,
they stop growing.
   The next step in the research will be to show that the vaccine
can protect animals against various strains of Legionella
pneumophila, and against other species of Legionella.
   Legionella pneumophila is responsible for 90 percent of
Legionnaires' disease, but five or six other species of Legionella
also cause disease, Horwitz said.
   Another question to be answered is how long the immunity induced
by the vaccine will continue to protect against disease, he said.
   Legionnaires' disease takes its name from its first known
outbreak _ at the Pennsylvania American Legion convention in
Philadelphia in July 1976.
