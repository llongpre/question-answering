   Jesse Abney, a chemical worker at the Fernald
nuclear weapons plant, says he doesn't want to see the Ohio
facility close down because it will mean a loss of jobs. But he
feels a sense of betrayal.
   It is at Fernald, he told a congressional hearing Wednesday,
that he became contaminated with plutonium and uranium despite
assurances over the years from supervisors that health risks were
minimal.
   David Day, another worker and union official at the Fernald
plant _ where investigators have documented widespread abuses in
environmental and health safeguards _ says he too relied on those
assurances.
   ``We were told the levels (of contamination) were too low to
harm us,'' he told the Senate Government Operations Committee.
Superiors told him a decade ago the radioactive substance he
handled ``was like working with lead'' and involved no more risk
than crossing the street, he said.
   ``We are the guinea pigs,'' added Abney, 55. ``We perform
important and dangerous work, but are made to feel expendable.''
Recent tests showed unhealthy levels of plutonium in his body and
uranium contamination in his lungs.
   Workers and union officials said there are similar stories at
the other major 17 weapons plants in a dozen states. Government
investigations are probing violations of safety and environmental
laws at a number of plants. The cleanup effort and bringing the
plants into compliance nationwide may cost more than $100 billion
and take 30 or more years.
   ``Contractors have ignored safety rules with the complicity of
(Energy Department) officials. Information documenting radioactive
releases and poor safety practices has been withheld from the
public and the extent of the hazards covered up by DOE,'' Margaret
Seminario, a health expert with the AFL-CIO, told the Senate panel.
   Other union officials said some workers are still reluctant to
complain.
   ``The cloak of secrecy (which kept workers for years unaware of
safety hazards) for the most part has disappeared and been replaced
by the threat of unemployment,'' said Day, who is head of a union
local at Fernald.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins acknowledged in separate
testimony Wednesday that the department's program to track health
risks at the weapons plants is ``a mess'' and that the department
has given workers past assurances of safety without an accurate
reading of the health risks involved.
   When he took over the department in March, Watkins said he found
the program for monitoring and evaluating health risks ``buried
deep within the bureaucracy ... understaffed, under-funded and
under-utilized'' with no outside scrutiny.
   ``The historical record provides little comfort,'' said Sen.
John Glenn, D-Ohio, committee chairman.
   The committee produced a list of 30 reports and studies over the
years that describe health problems among workers and residents
near the Energy Department facilities since the 1950s.
   Robert Wages, a union official representing 5,000 atomic weapons
plants workers across the country, said the Energy Department's
record on worker health and safety issues at the plants has been
``one of denial, coverup, inefficiency and betrayal.''
   Wages, a vice president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
Union, said concerns about worker exposure to radioactive materials
and wastes at the plants were debated in Congress nearly two
decades ago, but little was improved.
   Watkins promised a shakeup in the department's health monitoring
program and said it will be opened to review by an outside
committee of experts.
   Watkins told the senators he plans to rely heavily on outside
review panels because he can't trust internal department
statistics. ``Sometimes the reports coming in from the field are
not really true,'' said the secretary.
