   Some drums of chemical waste aboard a
freighter dubbed the ``ship of poison'' are damaged, and guinea
pigs will be used to see if any dangerous substance is leaking, the
port commissioner said Tuesday.
   More than 2,200 tons of unidentified wastes from Italian
chemical companies are in about 12,000 drums aboard the freighter
Zanoobia, which docked in Genoa on Sunday after spending more than
a month anchored off the coast of Carrara.
   The wastes were originally shipped from Italy 15 months ago but
were rejected by four countries before officials in Genoa agreed to
let them unload.
   Genoa port commissioner Giuseppe Francese said the guinea pigs
will be lowered into the ship's holds to see if they suffer any
toxic effects.
   Francesco Rizzuto, a lawyer for the ship's owner, Tabalo
Shipping, said a chemical analysis of the wastes must be completed
before the unloading begins.
   Francese said the entire process, including unloading, transport
and incineration of the wastes, could take two months.
   The Zanoobia is the last of three freighters used to ship the
wastes to ports in Djibouti, Venezuela, Syria, Greece and then back
to Italy.
   ``We could have vetoed docking of the ship in an Italian port,
but it looked like an unfair decision since the waste had
originated from Italy,'' Francese said.
   Lawyers for Tabalo Shipping say two people have died, possibly
after being contaminated by the wastes. A boy in Venezuela died
after playing near the cargo, and a Zanoobia crewman died during
the voyage to Italy from Greece.
   Five crewmen were hospitalized last month with symptoms possibly
caused by exposure to the wastes. Three others were treated and
released Monday.
   Dock workers walked off the job Monday to protest the smell and
fumes spreading from the Zanoobia, but they returned to work
Tuesday because the ship was moved to a more isolated part of the
port.
   The wastes originally were shipped from the Tuscan port of
Marina di Carrara in February 1987.
   Rizzuto said a group of Italian chemical companies paid the
Milan-based company Jelly Wax about 40 cents a pound to dispose of
the waste. He said the company instead shipped it out of the
country.
   The first ship took it to Djibouti, then to Venezuela, where it
was unloaded. After the boy died, the government ordered the wastes
shipped out of the country.
   It was loaded on a second ship bound for Syria, where it was
transferred to the Zanoobia. That ship made one stop in Greece
before it took the wastes back to Carrara.
