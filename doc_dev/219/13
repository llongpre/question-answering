   A World War II conscientious objector who
spent the war in a ``human guinea pig unit'' aiding medical
research plans to donate $1 million to further the study of peace.
   Peter D. Watson, 64, a retired Vermont real estate broker, wants
the money to be used to establish a center for peace studies at the
University of Rochester, at whose medical school he volunteered
during the war.
   ``We have plenty of places like West Point and Annapolis where
war is promoted,'' Watson told the Democrat and Chronicle of
Rochester on Monday. ``We need a place where we can work on
eliminating war.''
   University spokesman Robert Kraus said an announcement about how
the donation would be used would be made in a few weeks.
   The center, he said, would be used mainly for research and could
mean new courses for undergraduates. Conferences and invitations to
visiting scholars are also possible.
   The university must raise an additional $5 million from
foundations or other sources to receive the full $1 million
donation.
   Watson's experiences in Civilian Public Service Unit 115-R (for
Rochester) were on his mind this Memorial Day weekend as he played
host to a group of fellow veterans from the volunteer human
experimentation program.
   Seven of the 15 living members of the guinea pig unit gathered
at Watson's home in Greensboro, Vt., where he said they they
reminisced about and reaffirmed their decision to serve both
country and conscience through medical research.
