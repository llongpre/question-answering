   A young man whose body was used for a
medical experiment while he was in a deep coma died on Sunday,
family members said.
   The revelation last Tuesday that an anesthesiologist had
performed an experiment on Pacal Louette, 24, considered at the
time clinically dead, touched off a scandal about the ethics of
using human beings as guinea pigs.
   Louette, injured in an auto accident earlier this year, died
Sunday morning at Amiens North Hospital, his father-in-law, Emile
Collard, said.
   It was not immediately known whether there was a link between
the death and the experiment in which Dr. Alain Milhaud of the
Regional Hospital Center of Amiens placed Louette on a sabotaged
medical device.
   Milhaud was trying to see if the effects would match those of a
similar case which has resulted in a trial of three doctors.
   Last Wednesday, Health Minister Michele Barzach suspended
Milhaud from his duties as chief anesthesiologist at the hospital
center.
   President Francois Mitterrand condemned such medical exercises,
saying neither scientific progress nor the search for truth could
justify them.
   Milhaud had told his superiors about the experiment, which he
videotaped.
   It was the second time Milhaud said he had used a comatose human
being for an experiment. In 1985, he experimented on a 20-year-old
comatose man in a chronic vegetative state, setting off a scandal.
That person also died, but no link was established between the
experiment and the death.
   At the time, Milhaud called such patients ``almost perfect human
models, who constitute intermediaries between animal and man.''
   The latest experiment was made public in testimony Tuesday by
Dr. Jean Lassner, a medical expert at a trial in the town of
Poitiers where three doctors are charged in connection with the
1984 death of a 33-year-old woman.
   The woman, Nicole Berneron, died after the removal of a tumor.
She apparently had received nitrogen oxide instead of oxygen during
resuscitation. A report showed that the tubes of the resuscitation
system had been switched.
   Milhaud had informed Lassner of his experiment but has refused
all comment since the court testimony.
