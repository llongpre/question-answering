   Return with us now to May 1939 and the Batman's
debut in Detective Comics No. 27.
   Our story opens as handsome, young socialite Bruce Wayne chats
with his old friend, Police Commissioner Gordon.
   Wayne, his smartly tailored suit a lively orange window-pane
plaid, asks if anything exciting is happening these days.
   ``No,'' Gordon replies. ``Except this fellow they call the
`Bat-Man' puzzles me!'' Indeed!
   It seems a grim, costumed ``Bat-Man'' has taken up crime
fighting. Always one step ahead of the police, he tosses thugs about
like throw pillows.
   A bizarre series of burglary-murders ensues. The Batman
investigates. Conflict! A struggle. The Caped Crusader is subdued!
... Trapped!
   Villain sneers: ``This is the gas chamber I use to kill guinea
pigs. To experiment with _ but now YOU are my guinea pig (Heh! Heh!)
When this glass lid covers you entirely, gas will come through the
jet and kill you (Heh! Heh!)''
   Victim comeback: ``You fiend.''
   ``Bat-Man'' comment after slugging criminal mastermind to
horrible plunging death in acid vat: ``A fitting end for his kind.''
   Wayne casually reappears for the denouement, and Gordon reflects,
``Bruce Wayne is a nice young chap _ but he certainly must lead a
boring life. ... Seems disinterested in everything.''
   Ha! The story ends as Wayne ``returns home to his room ... a
little later his door slowly opens ... and reveals its occupant. ...
If the commissioner could see his young friend now ... he'd be
amazed to learn that he is the `Bat-Man!'''
   ``Watch for a new thrilling Bat-Man story next month.''
