  [Text] Majuro, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Top Marshall Islands 
government officials have criticised what they say is the 
failure of the United States to release information about the 
effects of its nuclear test program here. Officials said they 
believed the lack of data had led to inadequate compensation 
being paid to Marshall Islanders. 
  In the wake of US Department of Energy (DOE) admissions that 
US citizens were used as unwitting guinea pigs for nuclear 
experiments, Foreign Minister Tom Kijiner said Monday that the 
United States had failed to release full information about its 
nuclear test program in the Marshalls. His comments followed a 
recent medical study confirming that the Marshalls had a rate of 
thyroid tumours dramatically higher than in other parts of the 
world. 
  The study indicated health problems were not confined to the 
atolls of Rongelap, Utirik, Bikini and Enewetak, which the 
United States said were the only radiation-exposed areas in the 
Marshalls. 
  During the early 1980s, Marshall Islands negotiators sought 
detailed information about the 66 announced nuclear tests, 
Kijiner said in an interview. 
  "But US officials told us there was no further information 
to 
provide to us," he said, adding that the US statements had 
proved to be false. "The United States wasn't fair to the 
Marshall Islands during the negotiations (of a treaty known as 
the Compact of Free Association between the two nations)." 
  Last month, the DOE released previously classified 
information about the size of a majority of its nuclear tests in 
the Marshalls, information Kijiner said the Marshalls first 
requested more than a year ago. 
  The foreign minister said the United States released only 
selected information during the negotiations on the Compact of 
Free Association so that nuclear compensation would be minimised. 
  Marshall Islanders had brought lawsuits in US courts seeking 
about five billion US dollars in compensation for damages from 
the nuclear tests. 
  The United States provided a 150 million dollar trust fund 
to 
yield about 270 million dollars over 15 years in the compact 
that was negotiated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
  Marshalls Washington ambassador, Wilfred Kendall, said here 
that the matter of US compensation "needs to be revisited." 
  He concurred with Kijiner, saying that "all the details 
(about the nuclear tests) were not on the table during the 
negotiations." 
  Their contention is supported by a leading US congressman, 
California Democrat George Miller who is chairman of the House 
Committee on Natural Resources. 
  In a letter to US President Bill Clinton earlier this month, 
Miller wrote: "This committee has long been concerned that the 
entire story of the testing done in the Marshalls Islands has 
not yet been told and that the health and well-being of a 
significant number of Marshallese may depend on a look at all 
the facts." 
  Miller said some Rongelap islanders, who were engulfed in a 
cloud of radiation from a 1954 hydrogen bomb test at Bikini, 
have charged that they were used as guinea pigs to further US 
understanding of the effects of radiation. 
  "In the light of the recent disclosures regarding actual 
radiation experimentation in the United States during this 
period, that possibility cannot be ignored," he wrote. 
  He called on the Clinton administration to declassify 
information on the nuclear test program in the Marshalls.
