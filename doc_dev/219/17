  [Abstract] The broad range of human diseases caused by 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well various plant and 
animal ailments induced by numerous pathogenic factors in the 
pseudomonads, primarily enzymes with a toxic effect, and the 
resulting immunodeficiency prompted a study of the 
immunosuppressive action of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
extracts with respect to the cell immune response and an attempt 
to find the origin of the immunosuppressive factors. To this 
end, typical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains separated 
from the sputum of pneumonia patients (Nos. 140 and 3,990) and 
strains which had been cultivated for a long time in nutrient 
media under lab conditions (Nos. 1,961 and U-1) were examined. 
In so doing, the effect of water-phenol, trichloracetic, and 
salt extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the 
delayed hypersensitivity of mice to the guinea pig antigen is 
studied. The study reveals that the salt extracts of the wild 
strains contain thermostable immunosuppressive factors of a 
lipid origin with a high mass (over 800 kD) which may be 
inactivated by trichloracetic acid and phenol. On the other 
hand, salt extracts of museum strains as well as water and 
phenol trichloracetic extracts produced from wild and museum 
bacteria strains do not display immunosuppressive activity. It 
is speculated that these factors may be a pseudomonad 
lipopolysachharide component and that the biological properties 
of pseudomonads are not related to impairments of the 
oxygen-dependent processes in macrophages. Figures 2; tables 2;
