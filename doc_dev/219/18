  [Text] Majuro, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Top Marshall Islands 
government officials have criticised what they say is the 
failure of the United States to release information about the 
effects of its nuclear test program here. 
  Officials said they believed the lack of data had led to 
inadequate compensation being paid to Marshall Islanders. 
  In the wake of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) admissions 
that U.S. citizens were used as unwitting guinea pigs for 
nuclear experiments, Foreign Minister Tom Kijiner said Monday 
that the United States had failed to release full information 
about its nuclear test program in the Marshalls. 
  His comments followed a recent medical study confirming that 
the Marshalls had a rate of thyroid tumours dramatically higher 
than in other parts of the world. 
  The study indicated health problems were not confined to the 
atolls of Rongelap, Utirik, Bikini and Enewetak, which the 
United States said were the only radiation-exposed areas in the 
Marshalls. 
  During the early 1980's, Marshall Islands negotiators sought 
detailed information about the 66 announced nuclear tests, 
Kijiner said in an interview. 
  ``But U.S. officials told us there was no further 
information 
to provide to us,'' he said, adding that the U.S. statements had 
proved to be false. 
  ``The United States wasn't fair to the Marshall Islands 
during the negotiations (of a treaty known as the Compact of 
Free Association between the two nations).'' 
  Last month, the DOE released previously classified 
information about the size of a majority of its nuclear tests in 
the Marshalls, information Kijiner said the Marshalls first 
requested more than a year ago. 
  The foreign minister said the United States released only 
selected information during the negotiations on the Compact of 
Free Association so that nuclear compensation would be minimised. 
  Marshall Islanders had brought lawsuits in U.S. courts 
seeking about five billion U.S. dollars in compensation for 
damages from the nuclear tests. 
  The United States provided a 150 million dollar trust fund 
to 
yield about 270 million dollars over 15 years in the compact 
that was negotiated in the late 1970's and early 1980's. 
  Marshalls Washington ambassador, Wilfred Kendall, said here 
that the matter of U.S. compensation ``needs to be revisited.'' 
  He concurred with Kijiner, saying that ``all the details 
(about the nuclear tests) were not on the table during the 
negotiations.'' 
  Their contention is supported by a leading U.S. congressman, 
California Democrat George Miller who is chairman of the House 
Committee on Natural Resources. 
  In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton earlier this 
month, Miller wrote: ``This committee has long been concerned 
that the entire story of the testing done in the Marshalls 
Islands has not yet been told and that the health and well-being 
of a significant number of Marshallese may depend on a look at 
all the facts.'' 
  Miller said some Rongelap islanders, who were engulfed in a 
cloud of radiation from a 1954 hydrogen bomb test at Bikini, 
have charged that they were used as guinea pigs to further U.S. 
understanding of the effects of radiation. 
  ``In the light of the recent disclosures regarding actual 
radiation experimentation in the United States during this 
period, that possibility cannot be ignored,'' he wrote. 
  He called on the Clinton administration to declassify 
information on the nuclear test program in the Marshalls.
