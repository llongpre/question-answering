  [Abstract] The declining efficacy of antibiotics at the 
late stages of plague, especially at the stages of marked 
intoxication, necessitated a study of the detoxicating action of 
antibiotics and their efficacy during the marked intoxication 
stage of experimental plague. To this end, an experiment is 
carried out on 18-20 g albino mice and 250-300 g guinea pigs 
infected with plague by injecting them with a mixture of 
fraction II of the plague microbe (according to Baker) and 
plague microbe's lipopolysachharide (LPS) obtained by Westphal's 
method. The joint toxicity of these two agents was examined. The 
plague infection was experimentally induced by subcutaneous 
injection of the Yersinia pestis 231 virulent strain, 
and treatment began 48 h after infection for mice and 72 h--for 
guinea pigs. Statistical data processing involved an assessment 
of the confidence of various relative survival indices of mice 
in experimental and control groups. The detoxicating activity of 
polymyxin B relative to the plague microbe toxin and the 
efficacy of a combination of antibiotics in starting treatment 
of experimental plague in albino mice 48 h after infection are 
summarized. The study shows that polymyxin has a detoxicating 
effect and facilitates albino mice survival at the early plague 
intoxication stage; this is attributed to the ability of 
polymyxin B to inhibit the biological activity of 
lipopolysachharide in the external membrane of gram-negative 
bacteria. The use of a single antibiotic, such as amikacin, 
rifampicin, doxycyclin, or cefotaxime, which are efficient at 
the early treatment against the background of polymyxin therapy 
at the stage of marked infection generalization increases the 
animal survivability compared to the individual use of each 
preparation. As for the guinea pigs at the same stage of 
disease, a certain therapeutic effect is observed under the 
combined use of gentamycin with trenthal or dipromonium whereby 
the life span and survival of individual animals increase. The 
conclusion is drawn that the proposed treatment is promising for 
comprehensive treatment of generalized plague infection and is 
capable of increasing the therapy efficacy. Tables 2; references
