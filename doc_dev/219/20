   The family of a comatose man who was used
as a human guinea pig filed suit Tuesday against the doctor who
carried out the experiment.
   Pascal Louette, 24, who went into a deep coma following an auto
accident, died Sunday after Dr. Alain Milhaud placed him on a
sabotaged medical device to see if the effects matched those of a
similar case, currently the subject of a trial in Poitiers.
   Louette was considered clinically dead at the time of the
experiment, which was performed at the Regional Hospital Center of
Amiens.
   News of the experiment was made public a week ago and touched
off a furor in France.
   Health Minister Michele Barzach suspended Milhaud on Feb. 24
from his duties as chief anesthesiologist at the hospital center.
   The Louette family's lawyer, Alain Lhote, said his clients filed
suit against Milhaud for ``willful injury of a person unable to
defend himself because of his mental or physical state.''
   ``One can't treat a human being in the way Pascal was treated,''
said Lhote.
   He said Louette's parents were not properly informed about the
medical care their son was receiving and suffered ``a double
traumatism: the loss of a loved one and also the theft of a soul
which was stolen from them.''
   The exact date of the experiment hasn't been made public. It was
announced Feb. 23 in court testimony at the Poitiers trial. Louette
was injured late last year and transferred to the Regional Hospital
Center on Jan. 19. He fell into a deep coma shortly thereafter and
was kept alive on a respirator.
   Milhaud's experiment was prompted by a trial of three physicians
in Poitiers, accused in connection with the 1984 death of a woman
following an operation to remove a tumor.
   The woman, Nicole Berneron, received nitrogen oxide instead of
oxygen during resuscitation after the operation. A report later
showed the tubes supplying the two gases had been switched.
   The state prosecutor on Tuesday asked for 15-year prison terms
each for Drs. Bakari Diallo and Denis Archambeau, both
anesthesiologists. He did not ask for a specific sentence for Dr.
Pierre Desforges-Meriel, charged with involuntary homicide.
