<LEADPARA>  IN THE middle of this community's modest central business district are the
offices of an organization unlike any other in the world. The sign on the
front door says: "Nuclear Claims Tribunal.";    The three-member tribunal has
a mandate to distribute $45.75 million to the thousands of residents of the
Marshall Islands who contracted cancer or other devastating afflictions
following exposure to atmospheric nuclear tests conducted by the United
States. (The money was contributed by the United States.)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But that sum is not likely to satisfy Marshallese victims who have filed
civil suits seeking approximately $7 billion in compensation for death and
illness suffered as a result of the 66 nuclear weapons detonations above
Bikini and Eniwetok Atolls between 1946 and 1958.;    Moreover, the United
States has never fulfilled its commitment to make a serious effort to protect
the health and safety of those weapons test victims. Indeed, there is
considerable evidence that many of them have been used, without their
knowledge or permission, as human guinea pigs by scientists and physicians
employed by the federal government to study the effects of radiation
exposure.;    A 1977 study of Bikini conducted by the U.S. Department of
Energy concluded that radiation levels exceeded federal guidelines decades
after the nuclear tests were concluded, but the department was unwilling to
evacuate the atoll because it is "possibly the best available source of data
for evaluating the transfer of plutonium across the gut wall after being
incorporated into biological systems.";    In other words, DOE officials
wanted to examine the Marshallese after they consumed crops grown in
radioactive soil and fish caught in radioactive waters.;    At a 1956
briefing, an official of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission noted that the
Marshall Islands are "by far one of the most contaminated areas of the world,"
then suggested that the indigenous people were preferable as test subjects to
the mice usually used in laboratory experiments for cancer:;    "While it is
true that these people do not live, I would say, the way Westerners do,
civilized people, it is nevertheless true that they are more like us than
mice.";    That policy has produced dreadful outcomes. Because of
radioactivity's inter-generational genetic effects, some women in the
Marshalls still give birth to "jellyfish babies" -- grotesque, shapeless,
spineless collections of fluid and unformed organs wrapped in skin that are
lifeless when they emerge from the womb.;    No people have suffered more than
those who were on Rongelap Atoll in the pre-dawn hours of March 1, 1954, when
a 17-megaton thermonuclear device -- a hydrogen bomb at least 1,000 times more
powerful than the atomic bombs exploded over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki in 1945 -- was detonated in an AEC atmospheric test.;    The
dreaded mushroom-shaped cloud rose 25 miles into the sky and spread until it
was 70 miles wide. A radioactive storm produced ash and powder that fell on
Rongelap's people and covered the ground to a depth of 2 inches.;    AEC
radioactivity monitors went off their scales, but the residents of Rongelap --
vomiting, losing their hair and suffering from severe burns -- were not
evacuated until more than two days later. The AEC deceptively claimed that the
largest hydrogen bomb detonation in the world's history was a "routine" event
and "all (Rongelap residents) were reported well.";    Even though radiation
levels remained dangerously high, the Rongelap residents were returned to
their homes three years later. "The habitation of these people on the island
will afford most valuable radiation data on human beings," said a secret AEC
report.;    Now, the tribunal here in Majuro is processing claims from
residents of Rongelap and other atolls suffering from leukemia, lymphomas,
multiple myeloma, hyperthyroidism and cancer of the thyroid, breast, pharynx,
esophagus, stomach, ovaries, colon, pancreas, small intestine, bile ducts,
gall bladder and brain.  </TEXT>
