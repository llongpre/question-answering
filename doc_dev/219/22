   In 1922, Urvan Ubben's parents had his
``funeral picture'' taken, certain he'd be the next family member
to die of diabetes.
   Today, the 77-year-old laughs at the childhood photo and how he
cheated death by being one of the first people to test insulin.
Experts say he may be the world's oldest surviving diabetic.
   ``I was one of the guinea pigs when Eli Lilly was trying to
mass-produce insulin in Indianapolis back in 1922,'' Ubben said.
``In those days, they figured that if you had diabetes, you didn't
have a chance. And my parents were highly skeptical of insulin.
   ``So when I came back from the experimental treatments in
Indianapolis, my parents still thought I was going to die and they
wanted a picture of me. So they had my picture taken.
   ``Years later, I was looking at my mother's old pictures with an
aunt. When we came across that photo, she said `Urv, there's your
funeral picture.' We just laughed about it.''
   Diabetes, a disease caused by excess sugar in the bloodstream,
was no laughing matter when Ubben developed it in 1922.
   Earlier that year, Ubben's sister Theola died after slipping
into a diabetic coma. Ubben already had lost an aunt, an uncle and
his great-grandfather to the disease.
   ``It was quite scary for my parents and they were pretty
discouraged,'' Ubben said. ``Insulin had just been discovered
earlier that year; no one knew anything about it.
   ``Of course, now we know it's wonderful stuff. It's kept me
alive all these years.''
   A spokeswoman at Eli Lilly and Co. in Indianapolis confirmed
Ubben's 1922 diagnosis and his testing of insulin after its
discovery in Toronto.
   The pharmaceutical company isn't sure if one other member of the
first test group is alive. Ubben may be the oldest surviving
diabetic, said Gene McCormick, retired Lilly historian.
   Ubben suffered frequent bouts with diabetes-related illnesses
brought on by ignoring doctors' orders to maintain a strict diet.
He became partially blind from an attack in 1938.
   He and his wife of nearly 53 years, Wilma, raised three children
and worked a small farm. He later ran a coin-operated machine
business and worked as a furniture maker and wood sculptor.
   Ubben learned the dangers of insulin overdose when he
experienced one of the first documented insulin reactions. After
his treatment in Indianapolis, he was in a Peoria hospital for
observation when he passed out.
   ``The doctor didn't have any idea what was wrong,'' said Ubben,
who described the episode in an autobiography 10 years ago.
   Because the hospital had no facilities to analyze Ubben's blood
for sugar content, a specimen was raced to a doctor's laboratory by
police.
   The lab technician was at the movies. While Ubben's parents were
summoned to their ``dying'' son's bedside, every theater in Peoria
flashed an emergency message on the screen to locate the technician.
   The message worked.
   The technician raced back to her lab to study Ubben's blood and
found the lowest blood sugar she had ever seen.
   But the hospital had no glucose to counter the insulin
overpowering Ubben's body.
   So his doctor pried the unconscious boy's teeth apart, shoved a
rubber hose down his throat and poured a bottle of corn syrup into
his stomach in a crude effort to raise his blood sugar. Ubben was
revived.
   ``My parents were racing to the hospital to see me shove off,''
Ubben said. ``They thought I was going to die. But I fooled them.
They got there in time to see me wipe syrup off my face.''
