   A Navy technician accused of having sex
with his fiancee without telling her he was infected with the AIDS
virus was acquitted of assault Wednesday by a military jury.
   Petty Officer 2nd Class John E. Crawford, 27, of Magnolia, Ark.,
stood at attention in the packed courtroom as the seven-member jury
delivered the verdict after 4{ hours of deliberation.
   The sailor was convicted of a minor charge of having a visitor
in his room after hours and was given 15 days in the brig and
reduced in rank one grade. He could have received up to two years
in the brig for the offense.
   ``It was what I felt was right,'' Crawford, accompanied by his
present fiancee, Karen Skavdahl, said of the verdict.
   Crawford could have been stripped of his rank, dishonorably
discharged and sentenced to a decade behind bars had he been
convicted of assault.
   The jury also acquitted him of adultery and of exposing his
former fiancee, Jeannie Elmer, to the AIDS virus. Elmer is a
civilian.
   The case was unprecedented in the Navy, although there have been
similar cases in other branches of the military.
   Crawford was accused of having unprotected sex with Elmer in
1987 without warning her he had tested positive for the AIDS virus.
He was charged with adultery because Elmer was separated, but not
divorced, from her third husband.
   Crawford, an avionics technician, testified he told Elmer about
his test results and wore a condom when the couple made love in his
barracks room.
   But Elmer said that she didn't learn Crawford had been exposed
to the virus until the next day, when her housemate _ who also had
been Crawford's lover _ told her about the sailor's test. Elmer has
tested negative for the AIDS virus.
   Five of the seven members of the jury had to agree to reach
verdicts.
   ``The government is attempting to explore how far the Uniform
Code of Military Justice can be applied against an individual ...
with the AIDS virus,'' defense attorney Lt. Ron Richman charged as
the case went to the jury. ``The government seeks to hold out Petty
Officer Crawford as a guinea pig to see how far it can go on the
AIDS issue.''
   Lt. Cmdr. Jane Gilliland, prosecutor in the case, said in her
closing statement that Crawford, depicted as caring and concerned
by the defense, simply didn't care enough about Elmer to tell her
about the tests.
   ``She had no idea that the act of sex which she engaged in with
Petty Officer Crawford was potentially fatal to her,'' Gilliland
said.
   Crawford has said Elmer was bitter that he had broken off their
brief engagement and filed charges for revenge.
   Meanwhile, in Arizona, the AIDS-related court-martial of Adrian
G. Morris Jr. resumed for the hearing of motions after a nine-month
delay.
   Morris, a 28-year-old Army private from Caseyville, Ill., is
accused of having threatened the health of three soldiers by not
using condoms during sex and failing to warn them he had tested
positive for the AIDS virus.
   Judge Raymond D. Cole set a July trial date after denying
motions for dismissal of charges. Cole will hear the case without a
jury at Morris' request.
   He is charged with aggravated assault, conduct prejudicial to
the good order and discipline of the Army and sodomy.
   The proceedings were adjourned Aug. 5 by Cole to allow the Army
to appeal his ruling barring the Army from introducing Morris' AIDS
blood test as evidence. Cole's ruling was later reversed.
   The national Centers for Disease Control estimates that 20
percent to 30 percent of those who show antibodies to the AIDS
virus will develop the fatal disease within five years.
