   A Justice Department official urged a House
subcommittee on Friday to reject ``ill-conceived'' legislation to
compensate some cancer victims among southwestern uranium miners
and people who lived downwind of 1950s U.S. atomic tests in Nevada.
   ``The bill does not require that causation between exposure to
radiation and cancer be established or that any legal theory of
liability on the part of the United States be proven,'' said Steven
Valentine, deputy assistant attorney general in the department's
civil division.
   Valentine, restating opposition voiced by Justice officials for
more than a decade, said the department does not believe a link has
been proven between radiation and cancers in miners and people
receiving fallout from the atmospheric weapons tests.
   ``The assumptions underlying this ill-conceived proposal are
either subject to serious dispute or demonstrably erroneous,'' said
Valentine, adding that the department would recommend a veto of
legislation being pushed by lawmakers from Utah to compensate
victims or their survivors.
   ``I am incredulous,'' responded Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and
government relations. Frank said radiation victim compensation
``will be high on the (subcommittee's) agenda next year. It won't
go away.''
   Frank's hearing centered on bills introduced by Rep. Wayne
Owens, D-Utah, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, to pay compensation
similar to what Congress has voted in recent years to military
people who participated in the tests and to Marshall Islanders
injured by U.S. nuclear tests in the Pacific.
   Their proposal would give $50,000 each to people who lived in a
designated downwind area of Nevada, Utah and Arizona during the
Nevada tests and who developed cancers that studies show had a high
probability of being caused by the radiation.
   Payments of $100,000 each would go to people who worked for
minimum periods in underground uranium mines in Utah, Colorado, New
Mexico and Arizona between 1949 and 1971 and who developed lung
cancer and other respiratory problems.
   The lawmakers say the legislation is needed because a U.S.
appeals court has overturned a circuit court ruling that awarded
damages to some 1,200 downwind residents on grounds that the
government had failed to warn them of the tests' dangers.
   Owens, who as a private attorney represented some of the
plaintiffs, said that he also has had personal experience with
health problems of former miners.
   ``Last year, my brother-in-law died from lung cancer,'' Owens
testified. ``He worked in the Marysvale uranium mine in Utah for
less than six months _ a healthy man who never smoked a single
cigarette in his life dies from lung cancer.''
   Owens said payments to the miners are justified because the
government knew of high levels of radiation in the mines but failed
to warn the miners or force the mine owners to install proper
ventilating equipment.
   ``The government demonstrated a reckless disregard for the lives
of these uranium miners,'' he testified. ``The uranium miners
became mere guinea pigs in a government death watch.''
   Arden Higgins, who worked in the Marysvale mine from 1953 to
1959, told the subcommittee that although he never smoked, he lost
his right lung to cancer in 1983.
   ``I've watched my partners and my friends die of lung cancer,''
Higgins said. ``It seems that each year another one dies.''
   He said federal inspectors took radioactivity readings in the
mine and that physicians tested the workers. ``They never mentioned
once what the radiation was doing to us,'' he said. ``They told us
we were all right.''
