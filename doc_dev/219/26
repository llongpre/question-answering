<HEAD>Groups Go To Court To Protect Lab Rats, Mice and Birds</HEAD>

   Two animal welfare groups have sued the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to try to force officials to regulate
treatment of laboratory rats, mice and birds.
   In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, the Humane
Society of the United States and the Animal Legal Defense Fund
claim that the department misused its discretion in excluding rats,
mice and birds from the protection of the Animal Welfare Act.
   The two groups filed a petition with the department last year,
formally asking for regulations to cover rats, mice and birds. It
was denied in June on the grounds that Agriculture Secretary
CLayton Yeutter has legal responsibility to decide which animals
are covered, aside from those specified in the text of the law:
dogs, cats, monkeys, guinea pigs, hamsters and rabbits.
   Kelly Shipp, spokeswoman for Yeutter, said she was aware of the
groups' concerns but could not comment on the lawsuit because she
had not seen it.
   Martin L. Stephens, the Humane Society's director of laboratory
animals, said rats, mice and birds make up nearly 85 percent of all
animals used in research, testing and experimentation in the United
States.
   ``If these animals are needed in research, surely they deserve
minimum standards of care,'' Stephens said.
