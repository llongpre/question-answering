  [Abstract] It has been shown that Macaca rhesus monkeys 
injected with the Mozambique virus, which is closely related to 
the Lassa virus in terms of antigens, are protected against 
subsequent infection with a virulent strain of the Lassa virus. 
Owing to the fact that Mozambique virus is not pathogenic to man 
or monkeys, some researchers feel that Mozambique virus is a 
candidate for use in the preparation of a live vaccine designed 
to prevent Lassa fever. Before that can be done, however, 
convincing evidence must be produced to the effect that the 
virus is definitely not pathogenic to man, and it must be 
certain that the virus would not persist in the human body. Data 
published in the late 1980s reported testing of a recombinant 
Lassa vaccine on guinea pigs and monkeys, all of whom survived a 
lethal dose of Lassa virus after being vaccinated with the 
recombinant vaccine. Protection was not total, however, as they 
developed short-term fever and virusemia. That prompted the 
researchers here to study an inactivated vaccine against Lassa 
fever. The vaccine they tested protected Papio hamadryas monkeys 
against intramuscular infection of Lassa virus after both two 
immunizations and one immunization in doses of 1.1-2.1 mg and 
0.5-1.1 mg. The percentage of those protected dropped to 50 
percent when infection was via the aerogenic route and 
immunization was performed only once, in a dose of 1.1 mg. The 
protective effect was observed against the backdrop of an 
absence of specific virus-neutralizing antibodies. References
