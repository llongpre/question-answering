   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
announced Thursday it plans to distribute material in the United
States, England, Italy, West Germany, Mexico and Canada in a
campaign urging Avon, the cosmetics products company, to stop using
animals for tests.
   ``Images from my 1986 visit to Avon's laboratories still haunt
me,'' said Susan Rich of the animal-rights group. She said annual
reports and letters to consumers say Avon puts out 90 percent of its
formulas without testing on animals. ``But, in 1989, no animals
should suffer to test yet another shampoo, perfume or mascara,'' she
said.
   Jim Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer, said
that ``no company in the beauty industry has done more to reduce
animal testing than Avon.'' He added that Avon hopes to eliminate
all animal testing within three months.
   A company statement said Ms. Rich was told by Preston last week
of the progress the company has made. ``The company can only assume
that PETA called this boycott in a self-serving attempt to take
credit for Avon's plans to eliminate testing,'' the statement said.
   Preston said the safety of the company's consumers is its
paramount responsibility. ``PETA values human lives on a par with
the lives of rats, mice, guinea pigs and rabbits,'' Preston said.
``We do not.''
