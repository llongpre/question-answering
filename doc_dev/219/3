<LEADPARA>  GUINEA PIGS, it turns out, may not make good guinea pigs.;    That's because
the gentle, furry pets and accommodating lab animals are not what you, or
scientists the world over, thought they were -- rodents.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A new research study that analyzed the animal's genetic code shows that it
is not even closely related to rodents such as mice, rats and squirrels, as
was previously thought.;    One important consequence is that the guinea pig
-- whose name is synonymous with scientific experimentation -- may actually be
a lousy animal for the testing of drugs and medicines.;    These are the
conclusions of a team of scientists whose findings were reported in Thursday's
issue of the science journal Nature.;    They believe that guinea pigs and
possibly porcupines belong to a whole new category of mammals -- alongside
such orders as carnivores, primates and lagomorphs (rabbits and hares).;   
"Undoubtedly, these findings will be controversial," said Winston A. Hide, a
postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, who is a
co-author of the study. "A lot of preconceptions are being shaken. . . . Every
single (biology) textbook on the planet may have to be rewritten.";    The
authors' findings are based on the sophisticated new techniques of molecular
biology, which can analyze the billions of chemical subunits that make up the
genetic codes in the DNA of all plants and animals. These techniques are
causing scientists worldwide to rethink how animals and plants evolved, and
stirring up scientific debate on how they should be classified.;    But not
all researchers are convinced.;    "Yes, molecular biology offers powerful new
tools that will help us redraw the lines separating different plants and
animals," said Alfred Gardner, a wildlife biologist at the Smithsonian
Institution.;    "But do guinea pigs belong in a new order of mammals? I don't
think so," said Gardner, saying he needed more evidence to be convinced.;   
In the study, the scientists used a computer to analyze genetic data about the
proteins in more than 30 animals, including chickens, kangaroos, ostriches,
hamsters, camels, giraffes, cows, pigs, opossums, mice, rats, humans and
guinea pigs.;    Based on those comparisons, they concluded that guinea pigs
evolved separately, and far earlier, than rodents did.;    The other
co-authors of the paper are Wen-Hsiung Li, of the University of Texas at
Houston, and Dan Graur, of Tel Aviv University in Israel.;    TRADITIONALLY,
scientists who work in the field of taxonomy, the classification of living
things, have relied on the study of bones, muscles and other parts of the
anatomy.;    But in recent years, as molecular biology has developed,
scientists have learned how to study the genetic blueprints that direct the
development of plants and animals. By comparing the similarities and
differences between these codes, they have been able to learn more about how
the different species evolved, and propose different classifications.;   
"These studies are having a major impact on taxonomy," said Hide, who did his
graduate studies at Temple University from 1984 to 1990. "Scientific
classifications dating back to Linnaeus may have to be overturned.";   
Carolus Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, developed the method of naming plants
and animals in the 18th century. Many of his principles are still used today.;
   Hide said scientists have known for many years that guinea pigs have
different physiologies than mice, rats and other rodents, which are
characterized by sharp, gnawing teeth. "Their bodies process fats differently.
They lack the ability to synthesize vitamin C, which rats can do," he said.;  
 Because guinea pigs evolved far earlier than either rodents or humans, and
have different physiologies, Hide said, their use as models for testing
medications may be more limited than previously thought.;    "In fact, I think
they may be terrible animals for this purpose. Their physiology is weird.
Their genetic code is very different. We're saying, 'Hey guys, this is not
such a good animal to be doing experiments on after all.' ";    Guinea pigs,
which are in no way related to pigs, are native to South America and were
domesticated by the Inca civilization of Peru in the 1500s. They are a common
household pet because they are docile and clean.  </TEXT>
