PRISONS: The government yesterday agreed to a narrower definition of the
proposed new offence of prison mutiny, as the prison security bill
progressed through its final Commons stages, David Owen writes.
The move followed Labour claims that the original wording could have
resulted in prisoners engaged in peaceful protests about minor issues being
charged with the offence, which will carry a maximum sentence of 10 years.
The revised bill states that mutiny occurs when two or more prisoners
'engage in conduct which is intended to further a common purpose of
overthrowing lawful authority in that prison.'
ANIMAL WELFARE: The use of animals for the testing of lipsticks, shampoos
and other cosmetic products would be banned under a private member's bill
introduced by Mr Jimmy Dunnachie (Lab Glasgow Pollok) yesterday.
He said guinea pigs and rabbits had been used for most of the 4,000
procedures for testing cosmetics and toiletries carried out in 1990.
Mr Dunnachie appealed to Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, to refuse to
grant new licences for such tests.
The Animal Experimentation (Cosmetics) Bill will come before the House for
its second reading on February 14, but is unlikely to make significant
progress due to time restraints.
