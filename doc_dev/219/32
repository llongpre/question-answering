   A third U.S. company says it will
begin human testing of a prototype AIDS vaccine designed to protect
people not infected with the deadly virus.
   Chiron Corp. said Wednesday that tests on humans will start in
Switzerland in the initial step in clinical studies that could last
10 years.
   The tests are being conducted by Biocine Co., a joint venture of
Chiron and Ciba-Geigy Corp., a New York subsidiary of a Swiss
pharmaceuticals giant.
   The first clinical trial will involve 20 to 25 healthy Swiss men
who do not carry the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and AIDS-related complex. Biocine said it is now selecting
the participants.
   It is the first human testing of a prospective AIDS vaccine in
Europe and may expand to the United States within a year, said
Ginger Rosenberg, a Chiron spokeswoman.
   Two other companies in the United States _ Oncogen in Seattle
and MicroGeneSys of Connecticut _ already have begun human trials
on AIDS vaccines in the United States.
   Chiron said it has already conducted tests on chimps, goats,
rabbits and guinea pigs.
   But ``since animals do not get AIDS, animal studies provide
limited information about the ability of a vaccine to generate a
protective immunity against the AIDS virus,'' said Dr. Dino Dina,
director of Chiron's virology program. ``Much of what we nee to
know about the vaccine's effectiveness must await the results of
our initial human studies.''
   Typically, it takes five to 10 years to test a prospective
vaccine, he said.
