The bacteria that cause food poisoning can be altered to make improved vaccines 
that may be able to ward off a wide variety of infections, perhaps including 
AIDS, scientists reported. 
</P>
<P>
To develop the new vaccines, Stanford University researchers genetically 
modified the thin, corkscrew-shaped filaments or propellers, called flagella, 
which the salmonella bacteria use to swim. 
</P>
<P>
These flagella can be changed into vaccines to protect against infections for 
which there are no current immunizations, the scientists reported recently in 
the journal, Science. The method is an important step toward developing better 
medications that program the body's immune system to recognize and prevent 
disease.

One test vaccine stimulated an immune response to cholera toxin in mice, the 
researchers found. In addition, other vaccines produced by the novel method 
stimulated immune responses in mice, rabbits and guinea pigs to antigens -- 
proteins that stimulate antibody production -- of several disease-causing 
microorganisms, including the AIDS virus, malaria parasite, hepatitis B virus 
and a hemolytic streptococcus, which results in strep throat.
