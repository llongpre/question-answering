The 3rd District Court of Appeal in Sacramento has ordered a halt to an 
experimental program run by Cal State Northridge in which dental hygienists 
worked independently, without the supervision of a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
The court said state authorities did not follow proper procedures when they 
approved the pilot program in 1987. Sixteen Southern California dental 
hygienists are participating in the experiment, which is designed to determine 
whether hygienists can clean teeth safely and profitably without the 
supervision of a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
All other dental hygienists are required by state law to work under the 
supervision of a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruled Friday that the Office of Statewide Health Planning and 
Development should have held a public hearing before approving the experiment. 
Four more hygienists have applied to work in the program, which comes up for 
review in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Dentists, who sued state regulators in an attempt to shut down the program, 
applauded the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not opposed to research. We are opposed to experimentation on 
unsuspecting patients," said Dr. Dale Redig, executive director of the 
California Dental Assn. "Programs that have the potential to threaten public 
health should be put through the most rigorous scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
Hygienists, 90% of whom are women, have long labored as employees in dental 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
"They got us on a technicality," said Phil Perry, assistant director of 
external affairs for the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. 
State regulators reviewed the experiment during an open meeting attended by 
dental association members but failed to keep proper transcripts or meet other 
criteria required for a proper public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to take this lying down," Perry said. Regulators will seek a 
delay while trying to appeal the court's ruling, he said, or schedule a public 
hearing on the dental program, which has operated at offices in Reseda, Van 
Nuys, La Canada and in Central and Northern California. It is directed by a 
public health specialist at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good program. It's a viable program," Perry said. "They're taking 
X-rays and cleaning teeth. If they find a cavity, they call the doctor they're 
working with." 
</P>
<P>
He said association members were "guarding their turf" and "trying to remove 
any perceived competition" because unsupervised hygienists might provide some 
dental care at a lower price than dentists charge. 
</P>
<P>
All the hygienists are licensed, and most have been practicing for 10 years or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruling was the latest setback for the experiment, called the Dental 
Hygiene Independent Practice Prototype. It was created as a result of a 1972 
law authorizing experiments in health care that would otherwise be illegal in 
an effort to find novel ways of treating patients. The hygienist project took 
six years to get under way, delayed by lack of financing and the opposition of 
the dental association, which represents more than 14,000 dentists. 
</P>
<P>
The association, saying the project amounted to a declaration of war on 
dentistry, filed suit against the program in 1987. A Sacramento Superior Court 
judge refused to halt the project, but the association appealed, leading to 
Friday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Lombardo, an attorney for the association, said hygienists are not 
educated or licensed to diagnose dental disease or serve as primary health-care 
providers. Dentists characterized the patients as guinea pigs. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to court because this is an experimental program that necessarily 
involves human subjects," Lombardo said. "It should be scrutinized very 
carefully and in an open setting." 
</P>
<P>
But the hygienists have responded that patients of the independent hygienists 
are no more guinea pigs than patients of dentists are when the dentist is on 
vacation or takes a day off, leaving an hygienist unsupervised. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ordered the Sacramento Superior Court to require the Office 
of Statewide Health Planning and Development to halt the program.
