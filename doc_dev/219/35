THE humble cowpea plant is nurturing a potentially far-reaching medical
advance which could help prevent Aids and other infectious diseases.
The plant, which produces the black-eyed bean, is being used to produce
animal and human vaccines.
The first experimental vaccines, against foot-and-mouth disease and Aids,
are growing in a greenhouse at the John Innes Centre in Norwich.
If these experiments are successful, the manufacture of vaccines for a wide
range of diseases could be transformed.
The drugs industry would make immense savings because growing plants is far
cheaper than today's methods which use live animals or cell cultures.
Patients would also benefit from cheaper plant-grown vaccines, especially in
developing countries, because, being more stable, they could be stored for
years without refrigeration.
The plant vaccine system has been developed by Agricultural Genetics Company
(AGC) of Cambridge in collaboration with Prof Jack Johnson of Purdue
University, Indiana, and Dr George Lomonossoff of the John Innes Centre.
Details will be announced at a scientific meeting of the Royal Society in
London next week.
The scientists hope to be able to use it to produce vaccines for other
diseases, including hepatitis and the common cold.
The first vaccine, for foot-and-mouth disease, is already giving promising
results on guinea pigs at the Institute of Animal Health in Surrey. Tests on
a second plant-grown vaccine - against HIV - are now under way.
The system is based on the cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV). The scientists
discovered that its structure is particularly well suited to genetic
engineering. They have hooked antibody-stimulating proteins from animal
viruses on to exposed 'loops' on the surface of CPMV.
In animals, natural CPMV produces the strong immune response that is
essential for successful vaccination. But, as a plant virus, CPMV cannot
actually infect animals. This should make it safe for use in humans.
AGC's production system involves infecting cowpea seedlings with genetically
activated CPMV and harvesting the plants after two weeks to extract viral
particles, which are then formulated into a vaccine.
Each cowpea leaf contains enough material to make 200 doses of
foot-and-mouth disease vaccine.
