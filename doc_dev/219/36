<LEADPARA>  UNDERNEATH the usual assortment of foods on the grocery list pinned to the
fridge -- milk, bread, chopped meat, tomatoes and the like -- my 6-year-old
son has written the word CAT. He doesn't know how to spell many words, but CAT
is one of them. Last week's list contained the word DOG, to which his twin
sister had added RABBITS. (She's more interested in reading and writing than
he is.);    What they're trying to tell me in an unusually subtle way is: Mom,
get us a pet.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Each time I see their pleas, I cringe. Truth be told, I've been trying to
forget about pets ever since the subject was first raised a year ago.;    In
the world of pets, I would have favored a dog, but the lease on our rented
house forbids such an addition to the family. That reduces us to the feline
level, but their father is allergic to cats and I've never managed to form a
satisfactory relationship with a cat anyway. That leaves us with the rodent
family, not a world that appeals to me.;    We have had a couple of rodents in
the house, but never for very long. The first to arrive was Marty, the school
hamster. Marty stayed for a weekend and he was such an unassuming guest that I
forgot all about him. He never asked for anything, never even made a sound the
entire time he was with us.;    He was so unassuming, I panicked. I woke with
a start about 2 a.m. on Monday. "Marty!" I shrieked.;    "Who?" said my
husband.;    "Marty!";    "Who the hell is Marty?" he asked suspiciously.;   
"The hamster.";    "Oh." He went back to sleep.;    I got up, fearing the
worst, and ran down the hall to make sure Marty was still alive. He was. And
quite active, too -- running around on his little hamster wheel all by himself
in the middle of the night. It was a depressing scene, somehow encapsulating
the general angst I was feeling.;    "I know just how you feel," I told the
small creature soothingly.;    Marty was taken back to school a few hours
later and I thought of him fondly over the next several weeks. We had a
connection. But then, without warning, he died. The kids had a service for him
at school and he was buried in a small grave in the corner of the playground.;
   The next rodent to come to our house was Blackie, the class guinea pig. I
had been warned about Blackie from some neighbors who had taken him the
previous weekend and had finally put him and his cage in the bathroom. Blackie
smelled something awful, but the kids didn't seem to notice.;    At first, we
kept him on a table in the kitchen, but gradually the smell began to fill the
room, making it impossible to eat with relish. This was during that freezing
spell, and I was sorely tempted to put Blackie outside -- but not knowing
enough about rodents, I was uncertain he'd survive. Two rodent deaths so close
together might do psychological harm to the children and their teacher might
finger me as a crazed serial killer of rodents.;    So instead, we changed his
shavings several times a day and held our noses until Monday morning when I
gratefully carried Blackie and his cage back to school.;    My mind was set:
no guinea pigs. Hamsters were too depressing and also too fragile.;   
Rabbits. Hmm. Rabbits, maybe not. They involve a lot of equipment, such as
large hutches and chicken wire. Besides, rabbits are always escaping in our
neighborhood, burrowing out of their hutches and into the great outdoors to
mate. The possibility loomed that we might wind up with many more rabbits than
we had anticipated.;    So that leaves us with slimy things. A snake? No way.
I couldn't sleep, thinking of it curled up in one of my rooms, its body
pressed against its glass cage.;    What about fish? Too boring. We tried fish
a year ago and they died very quickly, their limp bodies floating on top of
the water within a week of their arrival. We didn't even have the decency to
give them a proper burial. I simply flushed them down the toilet when the kids
were at school, hoping they wouldn't notice. They didn't.;    I reconsider the
options. Hamsters appear to be the least amount of hassle. I tell the kids
they can have one. "When? When? One or two?" Two can easily become a dozen.
Next weekend we'll go to the pet store and they can each choose a hamster.;   
I'll just have to remember whenever I see these rodents on their wheels in the
middle of the night that they're just getting exercise. It's not a comment on
the human condition.  </TEXT>
