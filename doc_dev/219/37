   A veterinarian employed by the Ministry
of Defense escaped injury when a bomb exploded underneath her
vehicle, and police said Friday that their investigation centered on
animal rights groups.
   The explosion occurred Wednesday as Margaret Baskerville, who
works for the Chemical Defense Establishment, was backing her car
away from her home at Winterslow, a suburb of Salisbury.
   ``It has now been established the explosion was caused by a
device fitted underneath the vehicle,'' Inspector Graham Chivers of
the Wiltshire police said Friday.
   No group claimed responsibility.
   The Chemical Defense Establishment uses animals _ primarily mice
and guinea pigs _ in tests of protective measures against chemical
and biological agents.
