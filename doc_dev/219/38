   A group identifying itself as the Animal
Liberation Front claimed responsibility for two early-morning arson
fires that caused an estimated $100,000 damage and may have
unleashed a potentially deadly disease.
   The group claimed in a letter sent to news organizations that it
freed more than 1,000 animals from three research facilities at the
University of Arizona and set fire to a diagnostic lab and a
converted house near the medical college campus.
   Charles Sterling, a professor of veterinary science, said 30
young mice infected with what he described as a Third World disease
were among those taken.
   The mice carry the disease cryptosporidium which Sterling said
cause severe diarrhea lasting two to four weeks. He says the mice
will overcome the disease in a week to 10 days but they and their
fecal matter are infectious until then.
   Sterling said the disease has been known to be fatal to AIDS
patients, other immuno-suppressed individuals and malnurished
children, and he said there is no known treatment for it.
   Fire Capt. Keith Richter said no one was injured in the fires,
one on the main campus and one near the medical campus. Two
laboratories were gutted and two others partially damaged and
classrooms were damaged in the first fire, he said.
   Richter said there was about $10,000 in damage to ceilings and
walls in a hallway area at the second site.
   He said the fires were intentionally set.
   The group's statement said 950 mice, 50 rats, 16 rabbits, 14
guinea pigs, 10 frogs and other animals were freed ``from certain
torture and death at the hands of U of A students and researchers.''
   Sharon Kha, director of public information for the university,
said researchers were being asked to inventory their animals. There
was no immediate comment as to how the animals were being used.
   Graffiti on walls and doors of one building included ``Nowhere
is Safe _ A.L.F,'' ``A.L.F. We Shall Return'' and ``Vivisection
Will End.''
   The group said the animals, ``many of whom were found with open
sores and wounds and dying from overdose injections of various
substances, are being placed in good homes around the country where
they will live free from the invasive curiosity of researchers and
vivisectionists.''
   It also claimed that arguments that animal research benefits
human health are ``blatant lies spread by the research industry to
protect itself from the truth. Animal research never has and never
will benefit human health'' because of radically different
physiological makeup from that of humans, it said.
   ``Concrete and steel doors will not stop us,'' the statement
said. ``We will be back and will keep coming back until all animal
torture at U of A is stopped.''
