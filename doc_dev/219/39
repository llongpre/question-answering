A TRIP TO THE zoo is a favorite outing, but weekends often bring capacity 
crowds. Parents who have elbowed their way in for a glimpse of the chimps once 
too often will probably like to know that there are several Southern California 
colleges where animals are regularly on view -- usually without the crowds.

Because Moorpark College in Moorpark offers courses for would-be zookeepers and 
animal trainers, the college keeps more than 350 exotic animals on campus. 
Although the stalls are not open to the public, people are welcome to observe 
the animals from a walk that encircles the compound. Animals in residence 
include tigers, lions, wolves, coyotes, water buffalo and ocelots. There is 
also a petting zoo with goats, sheep, rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as a 
weekly animal show at the wildlife theater.

Cal Poly Pomona maintains barns that house sheep, pigs and cattle, as well as 
the stables of its renowned Kellogg Arabian horses -- all of which can be 
visited. During the school year there is also a monthly horse show at the 
state-of-the-art Arabian Horse Center, a tradition that dates back 63 years to 
founder and breakfast cereal magnate W. K. Kellogg. The show includes jumping, 
vaulting (gymnastics on horseback), trick horses and costumed riders.

Time was when most youngsters either lived on a farm or knew someone who did. 
Today's urban and suburban kids can get a idea of agricultural life from a 
visit to the Pierce College Farm in Woodland Hills. This working farm is home 
to chickens, horses, sheep, pigs and cattle. Because these are farm animals, 
not pets, children are able to observe but not touch the animals. The walking 
tour of the farm lasts about 2 hours (no strollers; backpacks OK). The Pierce 
College Farm is also the site of an annual rodeo each May.
