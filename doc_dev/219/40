   First lady Barbara Bush dedicated the first
school named after her husband, then met ``George Bush,'' the guinea
pig and ``Dan Quayle,'' the hermit crab, in kindergarten.
   It was Mrs. Bush's first visit since the election to the city
where she and the president spent 11 years in the 1950s and 1960s.
   Mrs. Bush was in Midland on Monday to dedicate George H.W. Bush
Elementary School.
   After a brief ceremony, she visited the 36 children in the
school's two kindergarten classes.
   ``What's his name?'' Mrs. Bush asked one of the kindergarten
students as she pointed at a brown and white guinea pig in a glass
tank. A little boy told her the name.
   ``Oh!'' she said, raising her eyebrows in feigned shock. ``George
Bush!''
   Then she walked over to another tank containing a hermit crab and
said, ``I'm not going to ask who the crab's named after.''
   She was told that the crab's name was ``Dan Quayle.''

   Television correspondent Barbara
Walters says women cannot have it all _ career, marriage and
children _ and she pointed to herself as an example.
   ``You can have a great marriage and great children; great
marriage and great career; great career and great children. But I
think it is so hard to have a great marriage, a great career, not a
job but a career, and great children,'' Ms. Walters told the
``Virginia Woman '90s'' conference sponsored by Sen. John W. Warner,
R-Va.
   She advised the 2,100 women in the audience Monday not to feel
guilty if they have trouble meeting the demands of career and
family, and admitted it hasn't been so easy for her.
   ``I've been divorced. I have a daughter, who, thank God, is 21
and out of her adolescence,'' said the 57-year-old ABC correspondent
and star of the ``20-20'' show.
   Ms. Walters advised the women to have a life beyond getting up in
the morning and going to work, ``although that can be pretty
wonderful and intoxicating.''

   Actor Todd Bridges got engaged to his

   Dave Dravecky, the baseball pitcher who came
back from cancer in his throwing arm, has won the 1989 Willie Mac
Award as the San Francisco Giants' most inspirational player.
   The award, voted by the Giants' players, was announced Monday.
   Dravecky, 34, underwent surgery in October to remove a cancerous
tumor located in a muscle near his left shoulder. After months of
therapy and a minor league rehabilitation stint, he returned to the
mound Aug. 10 at Candlestick Park and pitched eight innings to earn
a 4-3 victory over Cincinnati.
   Five days later in Montreal, Dravecky broke a bone in his upper
left arm while making a pitch to the Expos' Tim Raines. He got the
victory to finish the year with a 2-0 record and a 3.46 earned run
average.
   Dravecky, the 10th winner of the award named for Giants Hall of
Famer Willie McCovey, will receive this year's plaque from McCovey
on Sunday. The award recognizes inspiration, courage, leadership,
character and dedication in the tradition of McCovey.

   Ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, who recently leaped
into the musical theater with ``The King and I,'' said he has no
qualms about taking over a role dominated for years by one actor _
the late Yul Brynner.
   ``I've never been intimidated by anything,'' Nureyev told
reporters Monday.
   ``I danced `Giselle.' Nijinsky danced `Giselle,''' he said,
referring to the late Russian dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, considered one
of the best dancers of all time.
   Nureyev, 51, plays the role of the king of Siam in the revival of
the Rodgers and Hammerstein hit, with British actress Liz Robertson
playing his Anna.
   Ottawa is the second stop of a tour that began in Toronto last
month.
   Nureyev, who has been artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet
since 1983, said he's enjoying the musical, in which he sings a
couple of songs and must pretend he doesn't know how to polka for
the famous ``Shall We Dance'' number.
   ``I enjoy it very much, yes, I do. It's not as hard as dancing.''
