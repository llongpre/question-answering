<HEAD>Grapefruit Not Poisonous After All, Ministry Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>

   Health officials said Thursday that the blue
substance injected into some grapefruit in Rome was not poisonous,
and they revoked a nationwide ban on sales of the citrus fruit.
   The Health Ministry had ordered a seizure of all grapefruit in
Italy and triggered an alert in 11 other Common Market countries
when they reported Tuesday that they found six grapefruit poisoned
in an apparent act of sabotage aimed at Israeli exports.
   But the ministry said Thursday that lab tests determined the
substance was methylene blue, a non-toxic biological stain also
used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning.
   None of the other grapefruit seized was found to be tainted. It
was not known whether the six tainted grapefruit actually were from
Israel.
   Authorities found the six tainted fruit in a Rome supermarket
after a caller warned a Rome newspaper that grapefruit there had
been poisoned. The caller claimed responsibility for the
``Organization of Metropolitan Proletarians and Oppressed People,''
a group not previously heard of.
   A poster pasted on the outside of the supermarket urged a
boycott of Israeli products.
   The week before, an organization that said it supported the
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip claimed to
have poisoned Israeli grapefruit on sale in Milan and called for a
boycott of Israeli products. Laboratory checks found no trace of
poison.
   Health Minister Donat Cattin ordered the nationwide seizure when
three laboratory mice died after eating blue pulp from some of the
grapefruit.
   But officials began to doubt the grapefruit had been poisoned
because all the other rats, mice and guinea pigs used in additional
tests on Wednesday survived.
   Health officials speculated that the first three mice may have
died from the fiber in the fruit.
   ``Grapefruit is not a food for mice,'' said Israel Adato, an
Israeli Ministry of Agriculture official sent to Italy to assist in
the inquiry.
