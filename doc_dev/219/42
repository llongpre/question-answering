   A veterinarian has developed a dog
collar he says can silence chronic barkers with a high-frequency
beep.
   ``It's not an electric shock collar. It will not hurt the dog,''
said Jon Hunter, 48, an associate professor of veterinary
physiology and pharmacology at Texas A&amp;M.
   The device needs fine-tuning and its effectiveness is uncertain,
he said. But the principle is simple.
   When the dog barks, a miniature microphone in the collar emits a
burst of high-intensity sound, startling the animal into silence.
The sound is inaudible to most humans.
   ``It will not be so effective that it will stop dogs from
barking completely,'' Hunter said. ``Many people want their dogs to
bark in order to warn them of intruders.''
   ``The people who have tested the collar have said the collar has
had an immediate effect,'' Hunter said. ``It causes the dog to
become distracted from its barking.''
   Hunter's invention was inspired by his experience as an
11-year-old Missouri farm boy.
   ``We were milking cows and a thunderstorm occurred,'' he said.
``When the thunder occurred, the cattle and dogs would seek
shelter.
   ``Later, in attempting to modify the behavior of animals, I
thought of different sounds that would change an animal's
behavior,'' he said.
   In three years of research, Hunter tried electronic simulation
of thunder, explosions and gunfire. But a high-pitched sound few
humans could hear turned out to be the best antidote.
   Hunter said his collar is more humane than other solutions
owners employ. Some fit their pets with electric-shock collars or
subject them to vocal cord surgery. Others may give them away or
even destroy the animal.
   Hunter said he has a contract with a manufacturer whose name he
wouldn't disclose and hopes to have a model on the market in six
months.
   But, already, Hunter said he has been besieged by pet owners
offering their yelping dogs as guinea pigs to test the collar.
   ``I have people call me and say, `Please give me a collar or
I'll have to put my dog to sleep,''' Hunter said. ``We're trying to
help people as quickly as we can, but they want the collar
tomorrow.''
