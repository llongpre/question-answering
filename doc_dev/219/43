HAZARDS OF RADIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is, of course, outrageous as you pointed out in your editorial "They Were 
Told There Was No Danger" (Oct. 1) that 500 uranium mine workers, an estimated 
150,000 civilians living downwind of atomic bomb tests that were conducted 
during the 1950s and 1960s and the military personnel who were used as guinea 
pigs during those same tests were lied to by the U.S. government regarding the 
hazards of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to note, though, that we are still being lied to by our 
government and the nuclear industry regarding the safety of nuclear power 
plants and the effects of low-level radiation. 
</P>
<P>
In "Nuclear Witnesses -- Insiders Speak Out," author Leslie J. Freeman 
interviews medical researcher Dr. Rosalie Bertell, medical physicist Dr. John 
W. Gofman and physicist Dr. Ernest J. Sternglass regarding their many years of 
research on the health effects of low-level radiation. All three researchers 
have concluded that there are no "safe" levels of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the nuclear industry continues to promote the use of radiation in food 
irradiation and medicine, nuclear reactors continue to vent radiation into the 
water and air, and consumer products containing small amounts of radioactive 
materials continue to be introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most insidious and outrageous of all is the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission-approved plan to allow the nuclear industry to petition the NRC for 
permission to dispose of as much as one-third of its low-level radioactive 
waste as "below regulatory concern." This radioactive waste could then be 
disposed of as regular garbage and sent to landfills, incinerators and even 
recycling plants instead of to a properly regulated nuclear-waste disposal 
site.
