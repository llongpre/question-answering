   Dorothy Spangenberg's laboratory is
jammed with 20,000 jellyfish - four times more than usual - because
of NASA's delay in launching the space shuttle Columbia.
   The biologist from Eastern Virginia Medical School plans to send
2,700 tiny, young jellyfish on a research mission to study their
metamorphosis in a gravity-free environment. Originally scheduled
for August, it was pushed into 1991 when the shuttle sprung
hydrogen leaks.
   Those leaks are fixed now, and NASA plans to launch Columbia in
early December on an astronomy mission. The flight with
Spangenberg's jellyfish, Columbia's next trip, is targeted for May.
   Spangenberg said she needs a large jellyfish supply so there
will be plenty at the right stage of development when it comes time
for the mission. She expects to have more than 25,000 jellyfish by
spring.
   ``I'll just keep growing them until we have enough, although I
don't know how to gauge how much is enough,'' she said. ``We're
going to get as many as we can between now and then.''
   Jellyfish polyps, an early form of the animal and about as long
as the lead tip of a pencil, occupy aquariums, dishes and flasks in
Spangenberg's Norfolk, Va., laboratory. The dishes and flasks are
inside incubators.
   Each container is filled with artificial sea water that lacks
iodine and thus prevents metamorphosis. Polyps can live
indefinitely at that stage in the laboratory and reproduce
continuously.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has sent up
monkeys, chimpanzees, rats, flies, bees, moths, spiders and fish.
The Soviets have carried a wider variety of animals into orbit,
including dogs, tortoises and guinea pigs. Neither country, though,
has ever flown jellyfish in space.
   What makes the marine creature so suitable for a nine-day
shuttle mission is that polyps develop into the more mature ephyra
stage in five to six days when iodine is added to their water.
   Ephyrae mature within four to six months into the final
developmental stage, called medusa. It's the form familiar to most
people - the 4- to 5-pound animals have bells, or humps, tentacles
and long mouth arms.
   Columbia's astronauts will videotape the jellyfish during the
flight, add iodine to the water of some of the specimens, and track
their growth. Spangenberg will analyze the data.
   ``We need a range of organisms to begin to put together a
picture to see if the response (in space) is similar from one
organism to the next,'' said NASA's Gary Jahns, the mission's
payload scientist. ``Jellyfish are a single point in that
picture.''
   The Spacelab life sciences mission, which will include a rat
study and 18 other experiments, originally was scheduled for late
1986, then early 1987. A month after NASA approved Spangenberg's
experiment application in December 1985, Challenger exploded and
the shuttle program ground to a 2{-year halt.
   The delays have proved beneficial for Spangenberg. In October,
she discovered another kind of jellyfish cell in the ephyra, a
gravity receptor that helps the creatures maintain direction and
balance somewhat like the human inner ear.
   Each jellyfish gravity receptor has a sac of calcium sulphate
crystals, just as each inner ear has calcium-containing crystals.
Spangenberg is sending up about 150 ephyrae to see if any calcium
is lost in the weightlessness of space. Thirty white rats on the
shuttle will be observed in a related study.
   Such knowledge is expected to improve scientists' understanding
of calcium loss in astronauts during flight.
   ``The cells of the jellyfish are basically very similar to cells
of higher animals,'' Spangenberg said. ``I look at them as a good
model system for the study of a variety of biological problems.''
