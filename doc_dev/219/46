   The American Medical Association today urged
doctors to take a more active role in their communities to ensure
fairness in the debate over the use of animals in research.
   In a commentary in the Journal of the AMA, the association
cautioned that erosion of public support for the use of research
animals poses as great a threat as pending legislation or
regulatory efforts.
   ``When people are given the entire picture, when they're
reminded that research animals played a crucial role in the
development of vaccines ... and heart transplants and antibiotics,
there is clearly backing for this position,'' said William Hendee,
AMA vice president for science and technology.
   ``But those opposed to the practice are starting now at the
local level, aiming programs at schoolchildren. It's in those
situations that we're appealing to doctors and scientists to come
forward, to make sure both sides of the debate are presented,''
said Hendee, who wrote the commentary with Stephen Smith, a senior
scientist with the association's Department of Drugs.
   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimates that
17 million to 22 million animals are used annually in biomedical
experiments, and that 75 percent to 90 percent of them are rodents:
rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbits.
   Dogs, cats and primates make up less than 5 percent of the
remainder.
   Primates are obtained from breeders or, in some cases, are bred
by research facilities. Dogs and cats are obtained from pounds or
from special breeders.
   Sixty percent of the experiments each year do not result in any
suffering by the animal, and animals receive painkilling drugs or
anesthesia in 32 percent of the cases, Smith said. Pain is
inflicted on the experimental animal in 8 percent of the
experiments, he added.
   Spokeswoman Jeanne Roush of People for Ethical Treatment of
Animals, a Washington-based animal-rights organization, said the
appeal shows ``the AMA is running scared.
   ``They simply realize animal-rights groups are gaining momentum
... that medical students and even doctors are less and less
inclined to take part in these experiments,'' Ms. Roush said.
   ``They should begin seriously looking at alternatives (to
animals) and phasing this practice out completely,'' she said.
``That's what people want.''
   The AMA authors said researchers are barred from using pound
animals in some places, and that such prohibitions are being
considered elsewhere.
   A complete ban would drive up research costs by $90 million
annually, they estimated.
   Most of the millions of animals consigned to pounds are
destroyed, he said. Less than 3 percent of those are research
animals, according to the commentary.
