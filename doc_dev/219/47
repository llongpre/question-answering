   Scientists have found specialized nerve sites
where a natural pain-causing substance attaches itself, adding
evidence that the substance plays a key role in the body's
perception of pain.
   Molecules of the substance, bradykinin, bound to the nerve sites
in experiments with dog and guinea pig nerve tissue, scientists
said in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
   Bradykinin is released from bodily tissues when they are
injured. Researchers reported last year that drugs designed to
block the binding of bradykinin to nerve sites could relieve pain
in rats.
   Scientists in the new study included Solomon Snyder and Donald
Manning of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore,
Larry Steranka of Nova Pharmaceutical Corp., and Raymond Vavrek and
John Stewart of the University of Colorado.
   Researchers incubated slices of animal spinal cord and other
nerve tissues with bradykinin that had been labeled with a
radioactive isotope for easy tracking. Tests showed the bradykinin
bound to particular sites, called receptors, on sensory nerves that
carry pain messages.
