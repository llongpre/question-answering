<HEAD>Survey: Three-Fourths Of Public Favor Animal Research For Medical
Progress</HEAD>

   The head of an animal rights group says she's not
impressed by a poll which found that 77 percent of Americans
believe medical progress depends on the use of animals in research.
   ``It's hardly an unbiased survey, I must say,'' said Ingrid
Newkirk, director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
   Ms. Newkirk considers the poll, commissioned by the American
Medical Association, a public relations ploy, saying the money
could have been put to greater use by improving the living
conditions of laboratory animals.
   Results of the survey, conducted in February by Tarrance-SRI of
Houston, were reported in today's edition of American Medical News,
the weekly newspaper of the AMA.
   Of 1,500 adults surveyed nationwide, 77 percent said they
believed the use of animals in medical research is necessary, while
17 percent disagreed and 6 percent weren't sure, the AMA reported.
   Support of animal research appeared to grow with education and
income level, the poll found. Of respondents with annual incomes of
at least $30,000, 83 percent approved of the research.
   Respondents were surveyed by telephone in a random sample of
residential listings in the United States. The margin of error was
plus or minus 2.5 percent, the AMA said.
   ``The overwhelming positive response to our survey question
indicates to me that a vast majority of the American public
recognizes the benefits their families enjoy with today's modern
medicines, which were made possible by animal research,'' said Dr.
James H. Sammons, AMA executive vice president.
   ``The American Medical Association has been and will continue to
be a very vocal proponent of responsible _ and let me emphasize
responsible _ use of animals in medical research.''
   Ms. Newkirk said the poll was nothing but an attempt ``to turn
back the growing tide of public opinion that animals need some
protection in the lab.'' Her private, not-for-profit group, based
in Washington, D.C., has 150,000 members.
   She accused the AMA of leading ``the fight to defeat all
legislation on Capitol Hill, no matter how minimal, that would
affect the living and dying conditions of animals.''
   Dr. M. Roy Schwarz countered Newkirk's charge that the poll was
biased, saying ``we certainly would stand behind'' the findings.
   Schwarz, the AMA's assistant executive vice president for
medical education and science, also denied that the AMA has tried
to thwart efforts to protect laboratory animals.
   He said the organization is supporting revision of Department of
Agriculture guidelines to set higher standards and force
improvement in animal facilities.
   Newkirk said the immediate goal of her group is to eliminate
``gratuitous cruelty'' to animals, including the testing of
cosmetics, and eventually hopes to end all animal lab testing.
   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimates that
between 17 million and 22 million animals are used annually in
biomedical experiments, and that 75 percent to 90 percent are
rodents _ rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbbits.
   Dogs, cats and primates make up less than 5 percent with fish,
amphibians and birds making up the rest.
   Sixty percent of the experiments cause no suffering to the
animal, and in 32 percent of cases, animals receive pain-killing
drugs or anesthesia, according to Stephen Smith, a senior scientist
with the AMA Department of Drugs division of drugs and toxicology.
In 8 percent of cases, the animal does suffer pain, he said.
