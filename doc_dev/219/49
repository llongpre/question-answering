  [Abstract] Experimental trials were conducted on 80-100 
guinea pigs with interscapular wounds infected with 10E9 E. coli 
K-11 cells to assess the therapeutic efficacy of a special 
surgical dressing. The latter consisted of dioxydin or 
terrilytin impregnated hydrophilic materials (HM; Ekran 
Scientific Industrial Association). Actual treatment consisted 
of application of the terrilytin-HM on the wound surface, 
followed by an overlay of the dioxydin-HM dressing. The results 
showed that the special combined HM dressing led to wound 
sterilization in 3 days (0% mortality) , vs. 14 days in 
control 
animals (33% mortality) managed in a conventional manner. 
Clinical benefits with the combined dressing also exceeded those 
of dioxydin-HM dressing alone. However, although the length of 
time required for complete epithiliazation did not differ in the 
control and experimental groups, these observations suggest that 
the combined HM may have application in human medicine in 
controlling wound infections. Tables 3; references 3 (Russian).
