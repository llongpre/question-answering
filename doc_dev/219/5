   A Utah congressman appealed to a House panel
Wednesday to approve a $100 million trust fund to pay damages to
``forgotten guinea pigs'' of the West whose health was destroyed by
radiation from government uranium mines and atomic bomb tests.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, said several victims or their
survivors won federal suits in which the judges concluded the
federal government was negligent, only to have the decisions
overturned on appeal because of a law that protects the government
from being sued except in the rarest of instances.
   Republican Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who is sponsoring the
legislation in the Senate, said the cost ``will amount to only a
fraction of what the downwinders and miners have spent because of
the problems that the government his caused.''
   Hatch and others have been pushing similar legislation for years
without success.
   Proponents are more hopeful now in the wake of recent
legislation setting up a trust fund for Japanese people locked in
U.S. camps during World War II and another bill providing
assistance to U.S. servicemen exposed to the harmful effects of
atomic radiation while in the line of duty.
   Hatch reminded the House Judiciary subcommittee on
administrative law and governmental relations that Senate approval
in 1985 of a compact with the governments of Micronesia included a
trust fund for victims of fallout from atomic testing in the
Pacific Ocean.
   If the government is willing to provide such treatment for
foreign residents, how can it do less for its own citizens, Hatch
asked.
   Referred to as ``downwinders,'' the people exposed to fallout
from open air nuclear testing in Nevada in the 1950s live mainly in
southern Nevada, southern Utah and northwestern Airzona.
   ``Even more appalling than the plight faced by the downwinders,
if such is possible, is the case of those who mined uranium in
Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah from 1947 to 1961,'' said
Hatch. ``Even though the government had adequate warning of the
hazards involved, these miners, most of whom were native Americans,
were sent into inadequately ventilated mines with virtually no
instruction regarding the dangers of ionizing radiation.''
   Owens referred to the mining and testing as ``an unnoticed part
of this nation's nuclear Cold War with the Soviets'' and said
earlier congressional investigations concluded that ``the residents
of this region were used as `guinea pigs' in a deadly experiment.''
   He noted that the House Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations recommented a decade ago that ``sufficient evidence
exists for the federal government to accept at least compassionate
responsibility.''
   ``Then, after wringing its hands over the suffering of these
`forgotten guinea pigs,' Congress unfortunately forgot again,''
said Owens, who told the subcommittee his brother-in-law, a former
uranium miner, recently died of lung cancer.
   Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Gerson, head of the Justice
Department's civil division, said the administration opposes the
legislation ``because it would dramatically change current law by
making the United States subject to unprecedented liability for
implementing policy decisions and functions.''
