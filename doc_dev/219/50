<HEAD>Group Asks: Who Killed The Easter Bunny?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An animal rights group, pegging its protest to
the Easter holiday, said Friday that more than half a million
rabbits are killed annually in cosmetics testing laboratories.
   Volunteers from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
clad in hooded black robes representing the ``grim reapers'' of
companies they say slaughter rabbits, carried a bloodied toy rabbit
in a satin coffin and shouted, ``Have a cruelty-free holiday!''
   The 20 PETA protesters marched outside the headquarters of the
270-member Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association in downtown
Washington, but police did not allow them to enter the building.
   ``Consumers don't realize that 530,000 cute, cuddly rabbits ...
our symbol of Easter ... are abused by industry, especially
cosmetics industries, every year,'' said Kathy Snow Guillermo,
PETA's Compassion Campaign director.
   Irene Malbin, a CTFA spokeswoman, said her organization believes
PETA is missing the point.
   ``We put human health and safety before anything else,'' she
said in a telephone interview. ``We don't believe our children
should be guinea pigs.''
