Hargreaves on a novel approach to genetic engineering

Bathed in artificial light in a sealed room at the headquarters of Axis
Genetics near Cambridge in the UK, several humble cowpea plants are making
their contribution to the search for an Aids vaccine.
The plants are infected with a common cowpea virus, but to that virus
scientists have attached proteins containing parts of HIV, the virus
believed to cause Aids.
This virus-protein combination will later be injected into mice to see if
they produce antibodies to the virus. If this is successful, clinical trials
of the resulting vaccine could begin on humans as early as next year.
Axis Genetics is the hi-tech arm of Agricultural Genetics, a biotechnology
company which hopes to come to the UK stock market next year. 'In some ways,
this is really whacky science - there are so many different applications,'
says Iain Cubitt, Axis's managing director, of the plant viruses.
Other vaccines Axis is 'growing' in this way include a medicine for foot and
mouth disease and one for mastitis in cattle. The foot and mouth disease
treatment is currently being tested on guinea pigs with cat-
tle trials due to start next
year.
'We've chosen applications where a huge amount is known about the viruses
already and where we can grow different proteins on the plant,' Cubitt says.
The benefit of producing vaccines in this way is that the resulting
treatments are very stable and do not need to be refrigerated.
This gives them a long shelf-life making it easier to transport them to
remote places. Since one leaf can produce hundreds of doses, large amounts
of vaccines can be grown in quite a small, enclosed area.
One of the biggest problems facing the company is the lack of public
sympathy for genetic engineering. Cubitt stresses that public fears about a
'rogue' virus escaping from field trials are misplaced.
'This whole room could produce 1bn doses of HIV vaccine,' he says of the
small laboratory where the cowpea plants are growing. 'There will never be
any need to grow them in the field.'
In addition, the production process is simple: the leaves are ground up in a
solution which is then placed in a centrifuge at a very high speed to
separate the particles.
Axis, the pioneering part of the company's business, is also working with
another arm of the company, Cambridge Plant Breeders, to manipulate the
genes in crops so that they become resistant to certain pests. This
eliminates the need to use expensive pesticides.
Farmers are under increasing pressure to restrict their use of chemicals and
improve their environmental practices. This is likely to lead to increasing
demand for bio-pesticides which the company also produces.
The agrochemicals industry currently totals around Dollars 26bn a year
worldwide while organic pesticides account for less than 1 per cent of that.
Analysts suggest that the bio-pesticides market could grow into sales of at
least Dollars 2bn in the next 10 years.
That would be a huge leap for many of the small biotechnology companies
involved in developing these products. But they will probably move into
alliances with the big chemicals groups such as Ciba, Bayer and Norsk Hydro
to distribute the products.
MicroBio, another arm of the company, has developed a way of rearing tiny
worms called nematodes, which prey on slugs - a product which has huge
applications in the gardening and agricultural markets. The product sold out
when it was released to the home and garden market earlier this year.
One reason for the planned stock market launch is to raise funds for
expansion. Agricultural Genetics' production of organic pesticides, along
with its programme of manipulating genes in crops to make the plant
resistant to certain insects, are projects which have created a lot of
interest as farmers try to cut back on their use of agrochemicals.
