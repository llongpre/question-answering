<LEADPARA>  The National Institutes of Health has shut down the government's
longest-running AIDS vaccine collaboration after discovering that NIH
researchers repeatedly ignored regulations to protect subjects in other
countries on whom vaccines were tested.;    The move, which NIH officials
believe to be unprecedented, has halted research being conducted by Robert C.
Gallo, the government's best-known AIDS researcher, in collaboration with
French immunologist Daniel Zagury, according to an NIH report obtained by the
Chicago Tribune.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The report said the sweeping restrictions preclude any NIH scientist from
continuing to collaborate with Zagury, who made headlines four years ago by
injecting himself with an untested AIDS vaccine, and the various institutions
in France and Zaire with which he is affiliated.;    The restrictions also bar
Gallo and other scientists in the National Cancer Institute's division of
cancer etiology, of which Gallo's huge laboratory is a part, from continuing
human-subject research with any other foreign scientists.;    The actions,
taken last month in the midst of a continuing investigation of NIH's
human-subject research, were prompted by what the report called the "apparent
inadequacy of NIH's system to ensure protections for human subjects in foreign
settings.";    No comment;  An NIH spokesman said the agency would have no
comment on the suspensions until the investigation was completed. Gallo's
lawyer, Joseph N. Onek, also would not comment.;    Medical research on human
subjects in this country is the most closely regulated in the world. To
prevent NIH scientists from participating in human experiments abroad that
would not be permitted here, federal regulations require that proposed
experiments involving foreigners be reviewed for ethical considerations by
NIH.;    In their so-far-unsuccessful quest for an AIDS vaccine, Gallo and
Zagury have exchanged a continuous stream of biological materials and
co-written a number of scientific papers. But the NIH report notes that,
during the six years the two scientists have been collaborating, "only two
projects of very limited scope" were presented to NIH ethics committees for
review.;    According to the report, the investigation was begun in July after
the Chicago Tribune posed a number of questions about Zagury's scientific
relationship with Gallo, who heads the cancer institute's AIDS vaccine task
force, in a letter to NIH officials.;    In seeking answers to the newspaper's
questions, investigators from the NIH's Office for Protection from Research
Risks uncovered what the report calls "a material failure to comply" with
federal regulations on the part of cancer institute scientists and
administrators.;    Zagury experimented on self;  Zagury created a sensation
in March 1987 when he disclosed that, in keeping with medical tradition, he
had used himself as a guinea pig to test a possible AIDS vaccine made from a
virus isolated in Gallo's lab.;    But the NIH report states that Zagury
actually began testing a similar preparation, also made with AIDS virus from
Gallo, on AIDS patients in Zaire four months before his self-inoculation.;   
No NIH approval was obtained for either set of experiments, the report said.
It also noted that the AIDS virus used to make the second preparation, which
Zagury used on a group of 10 Zairians, had been obtained from NIH on the
pretense that it was intended for monkeys.;    Zagury's account of those
experiments, later published in the British journal Nature, failed to note
that the Zairian "volunteers" on whom he tested the second vaccine were all
children.;    According to the NIH report, which said the subjects ranged in
age from 2 to 12 years, the ethical justification for Zagury's use of children
in the study "is not clear.";    Except for an emotional two-hour phone
conversation in April, Zagury has refused to answer questions about his
vaccine collaborations with Gallo.;    In a letter to the Chicago Tribune in
July, Onek, Gallo's lawyer, described as "utterly false" any suggestion "that
Dr. Gallo has improperly provided materials to other researchers for tests in
human subjects.";    Cancer institute records obtained by the newspaper show,
however, that over the past four years Gallo's lab has sent Zagury large
quantities of AIDS-related biological materials, including samples of viral
DNA, proteins and antibodies.;    Gallo's lab is also the target of at least
two other investigations. One, by the NIH's Office of Scientific Integrity, is
examining the veracity of some of his most important AIDS research, including
his original isolation of the virus that causes AIDS.;    The other, by the
House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, has
uncovered serious financial irregularities in Gallo's lab.  </TEXT>
