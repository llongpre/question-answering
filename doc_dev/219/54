   A barn that housed 2,000 rabbits and 2,000
guinea pigs being grown for research was burned, killing all the
animals, authorities said.
   The fire Thursday also destroyed the barn.
   Gerald Kuiper, owner of Kuiper Rabbit Ranch, said he and a
worker were cleaning the barn when they noticed some hay on fire.
   ``I tried to grab a hose to put it out. Everything was filled
with smoke, and it just started to go up in flames. It just seem
seemed to start on its own,'' said a tearful Kuiper. ``I don't know
what I am going to do now.''
   Kuiper, who has raised animals at the farm for 26 years,
estimated his loss at $100,000. But he said he has other barns
where he raises animals. The animals are sold, for $3 to $10, to
laboratories around the Midwest.
   Officials were investigating a cause for the blaze.
