   The injuries that occurred in the McDonnell Douglas
aircraft-evacuation drill were unfortunate, but such testing
brings employees closer to the products that make their
paychecks possible ("Use of Staff Guinea Pigs Causes Squeals
About Safety of Firms' Product Testing," Dec. 31). Would we
prefer the injuries be suffered by the paying customer? One
of the problems of U.S. industry is that products are being
designed and built by people who do not use them.
   Rest assured that the parachutes made in the U.S. are
tested repeatedly and continually by employees. These
employees are close to their products, they believe in their
products and they want to deliver the very best to their
customers.
