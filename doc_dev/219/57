<TEXT>
The human immune system can, given time, fight off just about any
microscopic invader. But the body is sometimes overwhelmed by an invader
before it can muster its defences, writes Daniel Green.
At a conference in Vancouver, Canada, yesterday, UK biotechnology company
Cantab presented the results of animal experiments that promise to overcome
this problem: it has developed a way of genetically disabling a virus so
that it stimulates the immune system but does not reproduce and cause
illness.
The Disabled Infectious Single Cycle virus seems to work by preventing and
curing herpes in mice and guinea pigs.
Cantab's manufacturing plant should be ready by the end of the year.
