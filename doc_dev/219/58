   A bomb placed on an animal researcher's
car exploded Sunday in this western English city and seriously
injured a nearby 13-month-old boy, police said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility, but authorities said
they were investigating any connection with a bomb attack Wednesday
on the car of a veterinarian near Salisbury.
   After the first attack, a telephone caller claimed
responsibility for an animal rights' group.
   The baby injured Sunday was identified as John Cupper. He
suffered burns, shrapnel wounds and a partially severed finger,
police said.
   The boy's father, James Cupper, and the driver of the car,
Patrick Headley, escaped injury.
   Headley, a psychologist at Bristol University, has been involved
in research projects on sheep, according to Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency.
   Deputy Chief Constable John Harland of Avon and Somerset Police
said detectives were investigating links with Wednesday's bomb
attack on the veterinarian's car.
   In last week's incident, a bomb set fire to a car driven by
Margaret Baskerville, a veterinarian employed by the Ministry of
Defense's Chemical Defense Establishment at Porton Down, near
Salisbury in southern England.
   That facility uses mice and guinea pigs in experiments on
countermeasures for chemical and biological warfare agents, the
Ministry of Defense said.
   Mrs. Baskerville escaped injury.
   Chief Inspector Bryan Saunders, a spokesman for Avon and
Somerset Police, said police were warning all people involved in
animal research to ``take every precaution, in particular to check
their vehicles for suspect devices.''
   Sunday's attack came the same day up to 50,000 animal rights
activists rallied in Washington to promote the humane treatment of
animals in the wild, on farms and in research laboratories.
   Many marchers advocated an end to using animals in medical
research.
