   An aging, foul-smelling Syrian freighter
anchored in this northern Italian port is at the center of a storm
over the dumping of chemical wastes.
   Caught in the middle are 18 crewmen who have been stuck aboard
the ship for four months with 2,100 tons of unidentified toxic
wastes.
   Six crew members from the cargo carrier Zanoobia, known in Italy
as the ``ship of poison,'' have been hospitalized. Other crewmen
say they only dream of getting paid and leaving the Zanoobia.
   ``We have been aboard for about four months, breathing the fumes
and the bad smell from the leaking drums,'' the Zanoobia's captain,
Ahmed Tabalo, said Wednesday.
   ``We all are weakened, depressed. We are only thinking of
returning home, even at the cost of leaving the ship and all our
belongings here,'' Tabalo said.
   Francesco Rizzuto, a lawyer for Tabalo Shipping, the owner of
the freighter, called the Zanoobia ``the tip of an iceberg of
illegal shipping of industrial wastes all around the world.''
   The waste on board the Zanoobia has been rejected by Djibouti,
Venezuela, Greece and Syria.
   Controversy over the ship and the cargo that nobody wants has
raised questions about whether industrialized nations are using
Third World countries to dispose of their wastes.
   Some Italian lawmakers have alleged in the European Parliament
that a group of U.S. companies offered $120 million annually to
dump about 3 million tons of industrial waste a year for five years
in Guinea Bissau, in West Africa.
   A joint statement issued Thursday by Libya and Nigeria denounced
agreements to bury nuclear and industrial wastes in Africa as a
``criminal and immoral'' act and urged African governments to bar
it.
   During a visit to the ship by a reporter, liquid leaked from
some of the 12,000 drums of waste, and crew members put sawdust on
the deck of the hold to keep it dry. The drums were secured in the
hold with frayed ropes, which posed risks in rough seas, Tabalo
said.
   The cargo's odyssey began in February 1987 when the waste from
Italian manufacturers left the Italian port of Marina di Carrara on
a Maltese freighter for Djibouti in East Africa. Djibouti officials
refused to accept the waste.
   It then went to Venezuela, where it was unloaded. But residents
raised a protest and a boy reportedly died after playing near a
leaking drum, so the waste was put aboard a Cypriot freighter.
There was no independent confirmation of the boy's death.
   The freighter took the cargo to Syria, where port authorities
ordered it out, claiming it might be contaminated by radioactivity.
It was transferred to the Zanoobia.
   The Zanoobia and its crew of 16 Syrians and two Lebanese brought
the waste back to Italy. The freighter was allowed to dock in Genoa
on Sunday after being anchored off Marina di Carrara for a month.
   The cargo will now be unloaded and disposed of in Italy, a job
that could take up to two months, according to port officials in
Geneva. No date has been set for the unloading to begin.
   Genoa health and port officials, who have been monitoring air
and water around the ship, lowered four guinea pigs into the hold
to test the toxic level. They said a test of 40 drums did not turn
up signs of radioactivity.
   Five Zanoobia crewmen were hospitalized in Carrara but were
later released. Rizzuto said Friday that a crewmen remains in a
Genoa hospital suffering from nausea and stomach pains. No results
have been released from their medical examinations, he said.
   The Italian government has appropriated $3.3 million to
incinerate the waste. The money will be repaid by Jelly Wax, the
Milan firm contracted to dispose of the chemicals.
   A Genoa judge, Marco Devoto, announced he has opened an
investigation into the activities of Jelly Wax. Rizzuto contends
that Jelly Wax has sent at least five other cargos of industrial
waste to unidentified destinations this year.
   The firm has refused comment on the case.
