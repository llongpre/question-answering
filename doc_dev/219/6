   Sen. Orrin Hatch says if the federal
government can give money to residents of Pacific islands affected
by atomic testing, there's no good reason not to do the same for
residents of western states.
   Hatch and Rep. Wayne Owens, both of Utah, called Wednesday for a
House panel to set up a $100 million trust fund for what Owens
called the nation's ``forgotten guinea pigs'' in the development of
nuclear weapons.
   The Republican senator and Democratic congressman have teamed up
on similar measures before but have never been able to get
legislation out of committee.
   They are more optimistic this year, pointing out Congress
created a special fund for Japanese people who were locked in U.S.
camps during World War II and also voted assistance for veterans
exposed to atomic radiation while on duty.
   Several civilians exposed to fallout from the Nevada Test Site
during the 1950s have won judgments in federal courts only to have
them overturned on appeal because of a federal law that generally
shields the government from lawsuits.
   The House Judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and
government relations is considering broader legislation that would
expand the right to sue the federal government if negligence can be
proved.
   But there was no indication how soon the panel will act on that
or the one-purpose, Hatch-Owens bill.
   Hatch said the Senate made history in 1985 by acknowledging in
its approval of the Marshall Island Compact that atomic testing
fallout damaged the health of Pacific islanders and by authorizing
payments for the residents.
   Hatch said he fell eight votes short at the time of winning
similar treatment for residents of the United States.
   Called ``downwinders,'' the people exposed to fallout from open
air nuclear testing in Nevada in the 1950s live mainly in southern
Nevada, southern Utah and northwestern Arizona.
   Hatch said the trust fund he is proposing would ``amount to only
a fraction of what the downwinders and miners have spent because of
the problems that the government has caused.''
   He said the cases of those who mined uranium in Colorado, New
Mexico, Arizona and Utah from 1947 to 1961 may be even more
appalling.
   ``Even though the government had adequate warning of the hazards
involved, these miners, most of whom were native Americans, were
sent into inadequately ventilated mines with virtually no
instruction regarding the dangers of ionizing radiation,'' he said.
   Owens called the mining and testing as ``an unnoticed part of
this nation's nuclear Cold War with the Soviets.''
   ``The residents of this region were used as `guinea pigs' in a
deadly experiment,'' he said.
   He noted a House subcommittee concluded a decade ago
``sufficient evidence exists for the federal government to accept
at least compassionate responsibility.''
   ``Then, after wringing its hands over the suffering of these
forgotten guinea pigs, Congress unfortunately forgot again,'' said
Owens, who said his brother-in-law, a former uranium miner,
recently died of lung cancer.
   Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Gerson, head of the Justice
Department's civil division, said the administration opposes the
legislation ``because it would dramatically change current law by
making the United States subject to unprecedented liability for
implementing policy decisions and functions.''
