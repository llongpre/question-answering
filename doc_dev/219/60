FT  07 JUL 92 / Observer: Bitter harvest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Non-alcoholic fumes could soon be wafting Japanese businessmen into the land
of nod. Suntory, the country's leading drinks producer, seeking a solution
to the problem of sleeplessness caused by stress, has stumbled on a new
nightcap.
Scientists at its Institute for Fundamental Research in Osaka put a number
of human guinea-pigs under pressure by giving them a maths test and keeping
them 'in a state of arousal'. Their rooms were then filled with six
different smells to see which most quickly soothed them to sleep.
Although a slug of Suntory Royal whisky ought to have done the trick, a
sniff of bitter orange proved most effective.
