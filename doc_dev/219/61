  [Text] Thailand's first official vaccine trial on HlV/AIDS 
prevention is likely to begin in April by the Thai Red Cross 
Society on non-HlV/AIDS carriers. 
  Thai Red Cross Society AIDS Program director Praphan 
Phanuphak said the AIDS preventive vaccine developed by United 
Biomedical Inc of the United States would be tried on volunteers 
of a low-risk group, after formal approval is received from the 
National AIDS Committee, chaired by Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai, on February 14. 
  He said the Public Health Ministry had finally accepted the 
need for development of vaccines to prevent HIV infection in 
Thailand and had therefore given the green light. 
  The vaccine, already tested on people in the United States, 
Australia, and China, had proved to be satisfactory, he said. 
  Dr. Praphan said the first phase of the trial would require 
24 volunteers, to observe the side effects that could be caused, 
and 100 to 200 volunteers to test the vaccine. 
  The results of the first stage of the trial would be known 
after eight months, whereas that of the second stage would be 
known within two years. 
  The vaccine trial would be publicized widdy [as received] 
because volunteers, non-HlV carriers of the lower risk group, 
would have to be carefully screened, he said. 
  Dr. Praphan said the volunteers would have to be given full 
details of the trial because out of the 24 volunteers, some 
would be given 100 micrograms of vaccine, some 500 micrograms 
and some would be given placebos, without making them aware of 
what injection they have received. 
  He said the volunteers would have to be told that the 
vaccine 
might be of benefit or might be of no use at all to them. 
  "The drawback of the vaccine trial is that during the 
initial 
trial period volunteers will have anti-HlV positive antibody in 
their blood," Dr. Praphan said. 
  However, after some time this could be separated from the 
HIV 
positive infection that caused AIDS. 
  According to Dr. Praphan, the Public Health Ministry is 
opening up to the vaccine trial because the AIDS problem is 
rapidly increasing in Thailand. 
  "Even though the news media criticizes Thailand for using 
its 
people as guinea pigs, the ministry will ignore it because no 
time can be wasted on this problem." 
  Other than the vaccine, Dr. Praphan said a new type of 
medicine, known as "protease inhibitor", was being developed in 
the United States and it was hoped it would be used by Thais by 
the end of the year. 
  He said this new medicine would be different from AZT 
because 
it would not allow the virus to become active and would allow 
only the production of a defective virus. 
  Dr. Praphan called on the Public Health Ministry and 
researchers of the country to encourage vaccine trials -- and 
not to bother whether the medicine had been licensed -- in order 
to obtain vaccines at a reasonable cost.
