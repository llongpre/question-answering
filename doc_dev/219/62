   When last seen, a wandering wallaby that
escaped from its pen was hopping toward the business district of
this suburban Chicago community.
   ``I almost came to a complete stop as it hopped by my car like he
knew what he was doing,'' said resident John Lyons.
   Apparently it took a detour, since police say the reports on
Sunday were the last they've heard of the wallaby, a kangaroo
relative, that escaped from its owner, Paul Marchetti.
   Marchetti, who keeps four of the marsupials on his farm southwest
of Chicago, said the animal escaped from its pen.
   ``If it was chased it will not find its way back,'' Marchetti
said.
   The errant wallaby, which does not have a name, is female, 3-feet
tall, with brown and white fur.
   Marchetti said the wallaby is not dangerous to those who come
near her, but she may be difficult to catch.
   ``They're not cuddly animals; they're aloof,'' he said. ``It
would not come up to you like a dog would.''
   He said the animal can survive the cold but it might not find
food. He feeds it guinea pig chow.
