   A federal judge here awarded $702,044 to the family of a mental patient who died during a 1953 drug experiment conducted by the Army. 

   The judge awarded the sum to the estate of Harold Blauer after finding he was used as a "guinea pig" to test potential chemical-warfare agents. 
Mr. Blauer died after being given one in a series of injections of Army-supplied mescaline derivatives at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. 
The chemical that killed him was a hybrid of mescaline and amphetamine. 
Mescaline is a hallucinogen that is similar to LSD, and was explored widely by the Army in the 1950s for its possibly disabling psychological effects. 

   At a jury trial last October, two Army officers were dismissed from the case and two state doctors were found not liable, leaving the U.S. government as the only defendant. 

   Federal Judge Constance Baker Motley, in a 109-page opinion that caps a decade of litigation, called Mr. Blauer's death "a sad episode in the conduct of the U.S. government and a personal tragedy for an unsuspecting victim and his family." 
She criticized the government for having "covered up its involvement in the affair." 

   Mr. Blauer, who was 42 years old when he died, was a ranking tennis professional whose psychiatric problems, the judge said, "were not permanent" and who "would have been released soon" from the psychiatric institute. 

   Government attorneys who handled the case said they hadn't fully reviewed the award or decided whether to appeal.
