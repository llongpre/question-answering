<LEADPARA>  HEAR the one about the two rubes who run afoul of a crooked developer, take it
on the lam and then be-come the unwitting guinea pigs of a Pomona quack who
freeze-dries them for 29 years?;   The kicker: When the guys return home
everybody's 30 years older and fast food, cellular phones and rap are all the
rage.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Even if you haven't heard this side-splitter, you'll want to pass on "Late
for Dinner" (opening today), another cockeyed comedy from W.D. Richter, the
man behind "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai.";   Richter has a standing as
cult hero. As the writer of "Slither" and the writer-director of "Buckaroo,"
he's shown himself a master of loopy, deadpan satire.;   In the past, you
could dismiss the guy as an industry aberration or an acquired taste.;   No
longer.;   "Late for Dinner" tries to bring hangdog humanism to the "Back to
the Future"/"Bill &amp; Ted" formula. Intricate special effects? Forget about
them; Richter has. He's more interested in tragicomic fallout when a couple of
'60s homebodies return home to discover life has droned on without them.;  
Richter's is a noble pursuit, to be sure. Unfortunately, he again mistakes
idiocy for charm, the mundane for the wry and affable. His idea of funny:
Willie, who resembles Richard Gere, introduces himself as Richard Gere in the
present. Only Willie hails from 1962, and wouldn't know who Gere is. Huh? Did
the lead-in to this joke end up on the cutting-room floor?;   The plot doesn't
bear repeating, much less remembering. It has something to do with Santa Fe
brothers-in-law Willie (Brian Wimmer) and Frank (Peter Berg) being hoodwinked
by a sleazy developer (Peter Gallagher) who's injured in a kidnapping that's
not really a kidnapping. Willie is wounded, the police give chase, and the
simpleton Frank says yes to a cryogenics researcher named Dr. Chilblains
(another knee-slapper).;   As everyone from H.G. Wells to Robert Zemeckis has
discovered, time travel is an ideal means of juxtaposing past and present and
thereby pointing up how, in the future, we will forfeit humanity for
"progress." Richter waylays his heroes in a present ruled by AIDS and
post-Reaganomics. What really throws them? Overpriced burgers, fancy bathroom
fixtures and rap music. Not what one would call original targets.;   Half the
time Willie and Frank seem like discombobulated versions of George and Lenny
in Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men"; the other half, they come on like a Mad
magazine parody of John Travolta in "Grease." You're expected to be charmed by
their innocence and directness.;   Don't be fooled. "Late for Dinner" is as
poorly played as it is constructed. The end credits are backed by grainy video
footage meant to tie up loose ends. The perfect ending for a dopey home movie
that somehow finagled a big-deal theatrical release.;   Late for Dinner;
(star); Rating: PG; Cast: Brian Wimmer, Peter Berg; Director: W.D. Richter;
Screenwriter: Mark Andrus; Running time: 1 hour, 39 minutes  </TEXT>
