   Two months of freedom were
apparently all Fatlip the capybara could take.
   On a dark and stormy Friday night, the 130-pound Amazon rodent
slipped back inside the fence around Palm Beach County's Dreher
Park Zoo, using the very hole from which she fled.
   ``It's not surprising,'' general curator Sally Lieb said
Saturday. Capybaras at the zoo are secure and well-fed.
   Fatlip, who resembles an overgrown guinea pig, got the nickname
from an accident that gave it a swollen lip.
   The animal escaped May 10, getting out of the capybara pen by
swimming under a fence in a canal bodering the enclosure, then
finding a hole left by vandals in the park's north fence.
   She was spotted many times while roaming free, but zoo officials
soon stopped trying to capture her, saying a capybara's watery
lifestyle made it difficult.
   Park officials didn't mend the outside fence in hopes Fatlip
would return, and footprints indicate she'd been casing the zoo for
a month.
   And although Fatlip is back in the zoo, she's still not back in
her pen.
   ``It's real hard to sneak up on her,'' Ms. Lieb said.
