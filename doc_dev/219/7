  [Abstract] Capsaicin is a naturally occurring 
physiologically active substance that has until recently 
remained little studied despite the fact that it is used widely 
in everyday life and in medical practice. Studies conducted in 
the past few years have demonstrated that capsaicin reacts with 
the C-fibers of the autonomic nervous system, facilitates the 
removal of substance P from the latter, and thereby lowers a 
patient's sensitivity to pain. Capsaicin has also been shown to 
affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and smooth 
musculature. Toxicity studies have established that capsaicin 
has a DL[.sub]50[/] of 1.1 to 120 mg/kg, guinea pigs being 
most sensitive to it (DL[.sub]50[/] = 1.1 mg/kg) and hamsters 
being least sensitive to it (DL[.sub]50[/] &gt;  120 mg/kg). Its 
toxicity is highest when injected intravenously [IV] and lower 
when administered rectally or applied cutaneously. Three minutes 
after IV injection into Sprague-Dawley rats, capsaicin is 
already detectable in their brain, spinal cord, and liver in 
amounts several times higher than in their blood. When injected 
subcutaneously, capsaicin reaches its maximum levels in the 
tissues and blood after 5 hours. After 48 hours, rats that had 
received capsaicin in doses of 20 mg/kg had excreted 8.7 percent 
unchanged and in the form of eight metabolites. Capsaicin has a 
lasting antinociceptive effect. When administered in an aerosol 
(2-5 æmol/l), capsaicin stopped coughing in test subjects 
without altering the depth or frequency of respiration. When 
used as an inhalant, it has been shown to increase the minute 
volume and average frequency of respiration. In anesthetized 
dogs, capsaicin injected IV in doses of 10 to 300 mg/kg has 
induced a short-term increase in mean arterial pressure followed 
by a long-term decrease. Its hypotensive effect in dogs and 
rabbits has been attributed to cholinergic mechanisms but not 
linked to any effect on the heart. Capsaicin has also induced 
relaxation of an isolated band of porcine coronary artery that 
was accompanied by hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle only 
in the presence of endothelium and has had various effects on 
isolated segments of guinea pig ileum depending on the 
concentration in which it was administered. Capsaicin's main 
targets are the central and peripheral nervous systems. When 
injected intraperitoneally into guinea pigs in doses of 0.125 to 
0.15 mg, it attenuates behavioral responses to irritants in 
areas such as the eye and nose. Practical application of 
capsaicin is based on its predominant reaction with the 
peripheral receptors of formations of sensory nerves. It is 
highly selective, and it maintains its stimulating properties 
when diluted to concentrations as low as 1:11,000,000.
