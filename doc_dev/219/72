   Some infants living near the Hanford
nuclear reservation in the 1940s may have received more radiation
than people living near Nevada nuclear weapons testing sites, a
scientist said today.
   John Till, chairman of a panel trying to estimate doses of
radiation to people living near the federal weapons production
reservation, said some infants may have received 2,900 rads of
radioactive iodine over three years.
   A rad is a measure of radiation exposure to human tissue and is
roughly equal to the radiation in 12 chest X-rays. The Nuclear
Regulatory Commission requires that facilities it licenses limit
yearly radiation exposure from airborne emissions to 15 thousandths
of a rad.
   Release of the study came one day after the Department of Energy
acknowledged for the first time that Hanford leaked radiation at
levels that endangered the health of nearby residents.
   ``Now that they've admitted what they've done, I think they
should make restitution and they should provide medical help for
the rest of our lives for anything the radiation has caused,'' said
Betty Perkes, whose family farms near Pasco, Wash. ``I feel like
they used us for guinea pigs, and I don't feel like they cared one
iota what happened to us either, or our families.''
   However, it would be very difficult to prove a long-term illness
was caused by exposure more than 40 years ago and the law prohibits
lawsuits against the government, said Jim Thomas of the Spokane,
Wash.-based Hanford Education Action League.
   The study was not intended to identify health risks from
radiation exposure. But Till said the numbers were high enough to
strongly justify a study of thyroid diseases among so-called
``downwinders'' who lived near Hanford during periods when it was
spewing radioactive particles into the atmosphere in large
quantities.
   The study of 270,000 people living in 10 counties of Washington
and Oregon near the reservation in south-central Washington
indicated that 13,500 people received cumulative doses greater than
33 rad in the years 1944-47.
   ``These numbers are significant because that is a lot of
folks,'' Till said at a news conference before the actual release
of the study. ``That dose level is significant enough to strongly
justify a thyroid dose study.''
   Radioactive iodine was released when spent reactor fuel rods
were chemically dissolved to separate weapons-grade plutonium and
uranium. When it concentrates in the thyroid gland, iodine-131 can
cause cancer and other diseases.
   Till said that by comparison, doses downwind from the Nevada
nuclear weapons testing site ranged from a few rad to 500 rad.
   The Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project uses
computer models to estimate how much radiation escaped when
plutonium was produced for nuclear weapons.
   ``I know of no other releases of this magnitude from any other
U.S. facility,'' Till said of the 1944-47 period, noting that
modern releases are extremely small.
   A small number of infants may have received as much as 2,900 rad
during that time, Till said. Infants were particularly vulnerable
to radioactive iodine because their thyroids were not as developed
as an adult's, and they likely drank more milk produced by cows
that grazed on grass contaminated by radioactive iodine.
   Of the 270,000 people studied, half received doses of less than
1.7 rad over the three years, and half received doses greater than
that. Of the upper half, 13,500 got doses greater than 33 rad, Till
said.
   Because of prevailing west-to-east winds, the affected area lies
roughly east of Hanford, with larger radiation doses affecting
those who lived closest to the reservation, Till said.
   The 10 counties covered in the study were Yakima, Kittitas,
Grant, Adams, Benton, Franklin, Walla Walla and Klickitat in
Washington state, and Morrow and Umatilla in Oregon. Some of the
counties are included entirely, others only partly.
   The panel also studied radiation doses to 70,000 people exposed
through water in the Columbia River, which borders part of the
reservation, and found that the average dose to the
gastrointestinal tract was 1.7 rad during a three-year period from
1964-66.
   The study is the first part of a five-year, $15 million project
that is the first major research into accidental and intentional
release of large amounts of radioactive materials that drifted from
Hanford.
