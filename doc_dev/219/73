<DESCRIPT>  OPINION; LETTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Am I to understand that, if the Maryland law offered no special liability
exemptions for physicians performing abortions, Cal Thomas (Perspective, Feb.
24) and other pro-life activists would finally accept this reasoned and
reasonable piece of legislation? Or will we again be treated to the usual
extremist tirades of this same faction that no such law would be acceptable?
Somehow, hoping for the former, I expect the latter.;    As for the question
of informed consent, I must admit that Thomas has come a long way. But, golly,
where was he when an uproar from the pro-life right prevented family planning
clinics, which receive federal funding, from even mentioning the A-word? A
pity that his belief in informed consent did not not extend quite that far.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Thomas' artful dodge may soothe his adherents, but it will leave his
critics unconvinced.;    -- William F. Bailey; Santa Clara;  PATRIOTISM MAKES
A HANDY BLINDFOLD; I feel anger and disgust at Americans' overwhelming support
for the gulf war. One need only wave the flag and cry "support the troops" and
all doubts, questions and reservations disappear. Patriotism is truly a
magnificent blindfold.;    Americans are intent on supporting our troops, and
thus the gulf war, out of concern that veterans of this war be treated better
than veterans of the last war. The saying goes that those who do not learn
from the past are doomed to repeat it -- and no one wants "another Vietnam."
The problem is that we are so concerned with past lessons that we are ignoring
our present situation.;    Let's take a break from the patriotism and the
past, and give ourselves a dose of reality. Instead of providing support for a
new generation of veterans, let's care for the ones we already have -- the
ones we're trying to make feel better by supporting this war. Let's focus our
efforts on making "veteran" an outdated concept.;    -- Kris Spencer; San
Jose;   COSMETICS AREN'T CRUCIAL; HEARTS ARE; I take great umbrage at your
Feb. 26 editorial, "Test rabbits, not humans." Over the past few years, you
have lumped all animal rights activists into one cumulative heap of
fanaticism. All who oppose hunting suffer from the "Bambi syndrome." Opposing
mascara testing condemns medicine testing. I am appalled!;    There is quite a
distinction between the frivolous and the crucial in experimentation. The
cosmetic industry in general, and the Draize eye test in particular, is not
analogous to open heart surgery. The physical make-up of a rabbit's eye does
not exactly mirror that of a human. Skin erosion of guinea pigs and rabbits is
not necessary to conclude that toddlers must be kept away from corrosive
elements. Mascara and hair spray are not necessities for survival. Valve
replacements are.;    In sum, I find your position an example of mixing the
ridiculous and the sublime. It is time for you to present this issue more
equitably.;    -- Jo Kearley; San Jose  </TEXT>
