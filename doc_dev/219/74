  [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--AL-AHRAM newspaper says that 
developments in the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue indicate the 
failure of the U.S. plan to increase pressure on the Serbs by 
normalizing relations between the Muslims and Croats and pushing 
them into a confederation which the Serbs would later be 
compelled to join. 
  In today's editorial, the paper notes that since an 
agreement 
was signed between the Muslims and Croats in Washington in 
March, fighting between the Muslims and Serbs has intensified, 
and it seems obvious that NATO's ability to intervene militarily 
against the Bosnian Serbs has limitations. 
  The paper says the Russian Federation foiled the first 
ultimatum by deploying its forces on the hills above Sarajevo, 
while the Serbs foiled the second ultimatum by signing an accord 
with the United Nations on a withdrawal from Gorazde. Before 
they withdrew, however, they burned most of the city. 
  The paper concludes that it is necessary for the 
international community, represented by the United Nations and 
the European Union, to agree on a formula acceptable to the 
three parties by which they will return to the negotiating table 
in order to produce a cease-fire and then unconditionally 
discuss solutions. 
  The newspaper expresses its belief that the arena must not 
be 
left for the United States to use as a guinea pig to test its 
relations with the Russian Federation.
