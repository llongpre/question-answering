   A teen-ager accidentally set fire to his
family's home while trying to kill bugs on a porch, officials said.
   The fire started when the 14-year-old boy lit insect repellent
after spraying it on the bugs, said Boulder County Sheriff's Capt.
George Epp.
   The flames ignited bushes, then shot up and covered the front
porch and its roof and burned into the wall of a second-floor
bedroom. Thursday's fire caused about $40,000 damage to the
Frederick McGehan home, said Epp.
   No one was injured. A cat, two dogs, a parakeet and a guinea pig
were saved from the smoke-filled house, officials said.
   The boy was not identified.
