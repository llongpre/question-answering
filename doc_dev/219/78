<HEAD>Government Says Treatment Makes Pigs Eat More, Get Bigger</HEAD>

   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that
scientists have invented a vaccine to make pigs piggier.
   Pigs immunized with the experimental vaccine ate an average of
22.5 pounds more feed and gained 11 pounds more weight than pigs
without the treatment, the department's Agricultural Research
Service reported.
   ``If a commercial product results from this venture and is
approved by regulator agencies, it could mean more quality pork
produced at lower cost and in less time,'' said animal physiologist
Jerome C. Pekas.
   The USDA agency has signed a three-year cooperative agreement
with Codon, a San Francisco biotechnology firm, for development and
further testing of the vaccine.
   Pekas, who works at the agency's meat animal research center in
Clay Center, Neb., said the vaccine is made partly from a fragment
of cholecystokinin, a natural appetite-limiting hormone made in the
upper intestinal tract of pigs and humans.
   When the fragment, called CCK-8, is joined to a larger foreign
carrier protein, the animal's immune system recognizes the fragment
as a foreign molecule and produces antibodies that block the
natural CCK hormone, he said.
   When that happens, there is nothing to tell pigs when they've
had enough to eat. So they keep on eating.
