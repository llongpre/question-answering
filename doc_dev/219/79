   A hormone that may play a key role in
developing the most common form of diabetes has been discovered by
University of Minnesota and Swedish researchers.
   The hormone, islet amyloid polypeptide, or IAPP, appears to
impair the ability of insulin to regulate the level of sugar in the
blood, causing the development of Type 2 or adult-onset diabetes,
the researchers said in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   IAPP and insulin are secreted by the islet cells in the tail of
the pancreas, the researchers said.
   With the discovery, the researchers hope to find better ways to
treat Type 2 diabetes, which affects an estimated 10 million
Americans and often leads to blindness, nerve and kidney damage, and
amputations as the result of gangrene of the feet.
   The researchers are Drs. Kenneth H. Johnson and Timothy O'Brien,
who are University of Minnesota veterinary pathologists, and Drs.
Per Westermark and Christer Betsholtz, Swedish diabetes researchers.
   Johnson and Westermark first mentioned their discovery of the
hormone in the 1987 Proceedings of the National Academy of Science,
subject to official confirmation by other laboratories.
   Johnson said Wednesday that other researchers quickly replicated
the findings.
   The hormone was isolated from amyloid, a protein often found
around degenerating human and animal tissue, Johnson said. The
researchers found amyloid in microscopic quantities surrounding the
insulin-secreting islet cells of pancreases of diabetic humans and
cats.
   He said the amyloid tissue around the pancreases of diabetics was
reported in the early 1900s, but that researchers were puzzled about
its role for more than 80 years because amyloid also was found
around the pancreases of people who were not diabetic.
   Johnson began looking at the amyloid of diabetic cats 20 years
ago, and 12 years ago he and Westermark, who worked with human
cadaver pancreases, began collaborating.
   They found there were differences between the amyloid of
diabetics and the amyloid of non-diabetics.
   Three years ago, Johnson and Westermark were able to purify IAPP
from the amyloid surrounding insulin-secreting cells.
   IAPP, like insulin, is produced by normal pancreatic cells, but
O'Brien said the researchers have evidence that an excessive amount
is produced in adult-onset diabetics.
   It is likely that IAPP is just one of many hormones secreted by
the islet cells of the pancreas involved in balancing the level of
blood sugar, he said.
   ``We've found IAPP in virtually every species we have looked at _
humans, dogs, cats, guinea pigs,'' O'Brien said. ``Presumably it has
an important role in healthy, normal people.''
