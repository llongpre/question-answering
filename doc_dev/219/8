and chips - One thoroughbred specimen can now serve four hungry people

A QUARTER guinea-pig and chips is an increasingly common menu item in the
small towns of the high Peruvian Andes. Nothing remarkable in the protein
source - local inhabitants have been eating guinea-pig for thousands of
years. A whole animal has traditionally been the portion, as the creatures
tend to be small.
Now a well-researched programme of genetic improvement plus an imaginative
initiative by international aid agency Care are starting to bear fruit - and
provide much-needed animal protein in the Andean diet.
'Guinea-pig meat is excellent food value,' says Mr Jose Sarria, head of the
research programme at Lima's national agrarian university of La Molina.
'It's higher in protein and lower in fat than beef, pork, lamb or chicken.'
The Andean farmers and their families, who are primarily responsible for the
millions of guinea-pigs that Peruvians consume each year, know it's
delicious.
Even though the guinea-pig, or 'cuy' as it is most commonly known in Peru,
is first cousin to the rat it has a different number of chromosomes. Mating
between the species is impossible, experts assure the squeamish.
Cuyes are traditionally to be found scurrying about the dirt floors of
Andean kitchens, eating whatever scraps of food and vegetable peelings come
their way. Always handy, they get plucked and thrown into the pot whenever
there is reason for a party - Andean weddings, local saints' days and visits
from relatives are never celebrated without cuy.
But this type of small animal management, or mismanagement, has caused
genetic deterioration in a species native to the Andes. When animals of all
ages and sizes and both sexes run free, in-breeding swiftly becomes a
problem, which the exceptionally short biological cycle of the cuy
exacerbates. Females can come on heat as early as 25 days old, but they will
produce small and often weak litters that their own underdeveloped bodies
are incapable of feeding adequately.
Standard Andean grasses, maize stalks or potato peelings, while convenient,
do not produce what the locals term 'the giant cuy'. Mr Sarria says the
improved guinea-pig needs a diet of 18 per cent protein. Even alfalfa
provides only a small percentage of that.
Finally, traditional management means that a process of inverse selection
occurs. For celebrations since the times of the Incas, the best animals have
found their way to the table, while the punier are left to continue the
race.
In the mountains of the Callejon de Huaylas, known as 'Peru's Switzerland'
for its eternally snow-covered, 22,000 ft peaks, Care has been sponsoring a
cuy breeding programme in conjunction with the regional government since
1989. It is estimated that 45 per cent of local children in the beautiful
but poor valley are chronically under-nourished.
So far nine local communities are proud owners of a model breeding shed
where 400 animals mate, are properly fed, weighed and watched over. Another
70 communities benefit from technical advice at an individual family level.
Most of the community projects are run by the 'mothers' clubs' of village
women. In the small town of Tingua, a countrywoman shows off her animals.
'See, this one we'll keep for breeding. She has short hair and dark, bright
eyes. This one here does not look so good - it will be sold for the pot.'
The animals are kept in separate concrete-built 'pens' holding about ten,
where they can be better monitored, selected for breeding and quickly
isolated if they fall sick. A prize specimen tips the scales at 1.75 kg, the
weight of a good-sized chicken.
In Cruz de Mayo, another Andean village, high above Caraz, lloking after the
community's rotating stock of 400 cuyes is a new job for a villager who
admits that he is now 'useless for hard labour in the fields'.
He is proud to pass on his new-found expertise, showing how young animals
are sexed and separated at one month old. Ten females are put to one male,
'but not until they are 90 days old', he explains. 'That way they make
better, fitter babies.'
Eighty villagers share management of the Cruz de Mayo 'cuy-house'. There is
a rota for cleaning out the pens, for cutting and transporting the alfalfa
or maize stalks. A separate room contains a small stock of veterinary
products for treatment of occasional skin diseases or parasites.
'A little bit of technical help makes a huge difference,' says Tulio
Triveno, Care's local director as he distributes simple illustrated leaflets
explaining the basics of cuy care. 'But the cuy is a hardy beast, much more
resistant to the tough climate, the altitude and infections than the
rabbit.'
There's still a long way to go. Ninety-nine per cent of Peru's estimated 22m
guinea-pigs are still reared in the bad old ways. Mr Sarria's goal is to
raise production to a minimum of eight healthy young per female per year.
And it is just possible that this traditional Andean staple could become a
delicacy for jaded palates abroad. The cuy is already kept for food in
several North African countries and the Agrarian University has recently
dispatched samples of the 'improved' animal to Cuba and parts of the US that
have large colonies of Peruvian exiles.
'We think that the guinea-pig, kept in most developed countries for
laboratory experiments, is a real food option in many countries of the
world,' says Mr Sarria.
