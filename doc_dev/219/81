<LEADPARA>  While the war in the Persian Gulf has already become a proving ground for
Tomahawk cruise missiles, surveillance satellites and other high-tech
weaponry, the conflict may soon bring the first wartime use of another breed
of U.S. know-how: biotechnology.;    A spokeswoman for Xoma Corp. said Tuesday
the Berkeley biotech company is in discussions with the Army to supply
military hospitals and M(*)A(*)S(*)H units with its treatment for septic
shock, a potentially fatal bacterial infection.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In septic shock infections, bacteria and their toxic byproducts leak into
the blood from abdominal wounds, contaminated catheters or during surgery.
Using antibodies made in mouse cells, Xoma has developed a treatment, called
Xomen E5, to neutralize the bacteria.;    Septic shock, the 13th leading cause
of death in the United States, affects about 400,000 people each year, mostly
among hospital patients, and results in up to 100,000 deaths.;    The use of
Xoma's drug in the Persian Gulf would fall under a recent change in policy by
the Food and Drug Administration that makes it possible for U.S. armed forces
to be given experimental drugs without their consent.;    But U.S. troops will
not become human guinea pigs for Xomen E5. While technically still an
experimental drug, Xomen E5 has completed the extensive human trials process
to test for safety and effectiveness and is awaiting final marketing approval.  </TEXT>
