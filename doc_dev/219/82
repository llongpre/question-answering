   The leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
group was quoted Saturday as saying he would accept Syrian troops
in south Beirut to end fighting between his fighters and the rival
Amal militia.
   ``For the safety of residents, we have accepted that the Syrians
deploy in the suburbs,'' the Barcelona daily La Vanguardia quoted
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's spiritual leader, as
saying.
   ``But ... there is still no decision on the form, how and with
what guarantees the Syrian troops are to move into the area,''
Fadlallah told the newspaper's correspondent in Beirut.
   More than 250 people have been killed and 850 wounded since May
6 in south Beirut fighting between Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
the Syrian-supported Amal. Both are Shiite Moslem militias.
   Most of 18 foreign hostages kidnapped by Moslem extremists in
Lebanon are believed held in the slums. Nine of the hostages are
U.S. citizens.
   Asked whether he thought the presence of the foreign hostages
created obstacles to ending violence, Fadlallah said: ``I have no
information to give an opinion on this matter.''
   Fadlallah said his party and Syrian troops have gotten along
together before in the Bekaa Valley and that the Syrian army aids
Hezbollah in its ``struggle against Israel.''
   ``But I can't deny that in these moments there is a certain
feeling of apprehension among our people'' over entry by Syrian
troops, he said.
   Syria massed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks on the edges of the
embattled southern slums.
   Asked whether he thought Syrian troops would move into the slums
peacefully or by force, Fadlallah said ``there has been no decision
by any party (to the conflict) to oppose their entry.
   ``Lebanon is a testing ground for all political powers in the
world. Foreign influences are so great that no local force has any
autonomy. The peeple of this country are the guinea pigs, the
scapegoats of international politics.''
