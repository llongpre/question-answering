RUSSIA will begin auctioning off shares in state-owned enterprises not this
month but next, starting with the sale of 40 per cent of the stock of a
producer of transistor radios and television sets.
Mr Dmitry Vasiliev, deputy chairman of the Committee for Managing State
Property, said that legislation requiring notice of between two weeks and
one month for share auctions made it impossible to hold trial auctions in
November as planned. The first auction of shares will be held on December
15, using Elex, a radio producer based in Vladimir outside Moscow, as a
guinea pig. Elex, which has already sold 60 per cent of its shares to its
managers and 7,000 workers, says it is profitable and would like to attract
foreign investors.
The authorities claim only 10-20 per cent of state-owned enterprises are
potentially bankrupt, as opposed to bigger figures quoted by the opponents
of mass privatisation.
