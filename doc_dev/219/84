   Legally barred from suing the government,
people whose health may have suffered because of huge radiation
releases from Hanford nuclear reservation began considering other
ways to get compensation.
   Scientists today were to start trying to determine just how much
radiation people who lived downwind from Hanford were exposed to by
releases into the air in the 1940s and into the Columbia River in
the 1960s.
   The federal government disclosed the magnitude of radiation
releases Thursday, revealing for the first time that people and
farmland were exposed to significant levels of potentially
cancer-causing nuclear contamination.
   ``We really believe we're getting the truth now,'' said Tom
Bailie, a farmer and spokesman for people living east of the
southern Washington reservation.
   Residents are legally barred from suing the government for
damages suffered by radiation exposure, but could win compensation
through congressional action, Bailie said.
   Pending legislation in Congress would pay uranium miners for
radiation-related illnesses, though they also are blocked from
suing the government by the so-called doctrine of sovereign
immunity, he said.
   ``The federal government owes something if folks have been
harmed by these early releases of radiation,'' Rep. Sid Morrison, a
Republican whose district includes the reservation, said in
Washington, D.C.
   ``While these estimates are preliminary and they will change,
the potential for harmful side effects is with us to stay,'' he
said.
   An independent panel of scientists was scheduled to meet here
today to begin the second phase of a five-year study. They will try
to determine individual radiation exposure and health risks for
those who lived downwind from the 560-square-mile site.
   The first phase studied airborne radioactive iodine emissions
from 1944 to 1947 and radioactive cooling water poured into the
Columbia River from 1964-67.
   The five-year, $15 million study is being paid for, but not
directed, by the U.S. Department of Energy, which operates the
reservation.
   Hanford was established late in World War II as part of the
Manhattan Project to build atomic bombs.
   Fuel rods irradiated in as many as nine nuclear reactors at the
site were taken to several top-secret plants where plutonium and
uranimum were extracted to fuel nuclear bombs.
   The iodine and other radioactive materials was released into the
air through unfiltered stacks, officials said.
   A few infants were hit hardest, with doses as high as 2,900 rad
over three years. One rad is the amount of radiation a body organ
would absorb from about a dozen chest X-rays.
   The panel concluded that most people living near the Hanford
site from 1944 to 1947 were exposed to low doses of radiation. The
study covered 270,000 people living in 10 Washington and Oregon
counties.
   In releasing the first phase report, John Till, a South Carolina
scientist and nuclear consultant, cautioned that the results should
not be used to make health risk estimates.
   But as many as 13,500 people, or 5 percent of the population,
may have received doses of more than 33 rad in milk after cows
grazed in contaminated pastures, he said.
   About 1,400 infants and children living in the area received 15
to 650 rad, with only a small number suffering the 2,900-rad doses,
Till said.
   When it concentrates in the thyroid gland, radioactive
iodine-131 can cause cancer and other diseases.
   Scientists hope that within a year they will be able to tell
people who lived in the area what their highest potential radiation
doses likely were.
   Such information would greatly help doctors treat affected
residents, Dr. George Laramore, professor of radiological oncology
at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.
   Bailie led an impromptu press conference of downwind residents
angered by the report that came decades after radiation was
routinely released in the rural agricultural area.
   ``I feel like they used us for guinea pigs, and I don't feel
like they cared one iota what happened to us either, or our
families,'' said Betty Perkes, a farmer in Pasco.
