   In a sprawling warehouse-like building,
Jerry Oleksiw presides over machines that simulate sweat, test-rip
bluejeans and generally perform the industrial equivalent of trying
to gauge how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.
   Oleksiw recently recounted what he called a perplexing incident
at the J.C. Penney Co. Quality Assurance Center, set in an
industrial park on the outskirts of Dallas.
   Pink plastic bags containing ladies' imported raincoats had left
a residue of a powdery pink substance on the garments.
   Penney inspectors went to work, knowing that if any of the
30,000 coats reached customers in that condition the company's
reputation could be soiled. Their first thought was dry cleaning
but _ oops _ the cleaning chemicals damaged the water-resistant
fabric coating.
   Plan B went into action. All the coats would have to be
laundered and pressed. Little labels would have to be sewn inside
advising proper care.
   Such is a typical headache for an arbiter of quality standards.
   ``To many suppliers, this place is known as the graveyard of
many hopes,'' said Oleksiw, manager of quality assurance and
product service for J.C. Penney and a 28-year veteran of the
retailer.
   Members of his domain include white-coated laboratory
technicians who measure almost every conceivable thing that can go
wrong or wear out.
   They stretch and tug jeans to the ripping point. They plunge
boots into a sub-freezing chamber to simulate winter's worst. They
suck oil out of shoe leather, toast toast in toasters and zap food
in microwaves.
   There are devices to duplicate everyday conditions that can
cause problems for clothing, appliances and other goods. Simulated
sweat and fake pollution are just two of the hazards these testers
throw at merchandise guinea pigs.
   One machine has been designed to measure the durability of
clothing material in an unprecedented way, Oleksiw said during a
tour. It could be said to place Penney on the cutting edge of
fabric tearing.
   Elsewhere, overall-clad mechanics scrutinize gardening tools and
other gear. They've rigged a strobe light to calculate how fast the
tip of a lawn mower blade spins, because a federal safety
regulation requires blades to rotate less than 19,000 feet per
minute.
   Outside, a lush acre of fescue and Bermuda grass stands ready to
put the mowers through their paces.
   Much of the work that goes on here duplicates testing done by
manufacturers. Penney has developed a reputation in the retail
industry for being unusually scrupulous about testing, outside
analysts say.
   The quality control center is due to move to Plano, Texas, in
late 1992, when Penney's corporate offices are scheduled to leave
intermim headquarters in Dallas to take up residence at a new
429-acre site. There will be plenty of grass for lawn mowers to mow
and a pond with ducks to feed the toast.
