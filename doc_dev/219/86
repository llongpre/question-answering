   School reform sounds great, but teacher union
leaders from three cities in the forefront of change say they've
learned the headaches may be as numerous as the gains.
   Turf wars with principals and other administrators, lack of
training and planning, a shortage of money and even flak from
fellow teachers are a few of the pitfalls reformers have been
encountering.
   So said teacher union members Tuesday from Dade County, Fla.,
Rochester, N.Y., and Hammond, Ind., districts that have gotten high
marks for their reform efforts.
   Addressing a workshop at the American Federation of Teachers
annual convention meeting here this week, local union president Pat
Tornillo of Dade County said an added problem is that the public
expects a quick fix.
   For three years, teachers in Dade have gained authority over a
wide range of issues in 155 of the 275 schools.
   ``Have we turned test scores around? Has there been some kind of
miracle as a result of these reforms? No. It takes more than three
years,'' Tornillo said.
   Adam Urbanski, president of the AFT local in Rochester that two
years ago obtained a contract instituting numerous reforms and
raising salaries for top teachers to over $70,0000, warned that
``in search of reform, you're likely to encounter shortages of
ideas more often than shortages of money.''
   He told teachers to expect ``tremendous turf wars.
Administrators believe they have less leadership if they share it.''
   In Rochester, Urbanski said, poor parents were sometimes
mistrustful of reform. They wanted the kind of education rich kids
get; they didn't want to be the guinea pigs for the latest reform
fads, he said.
   In Hammond, a district with chronic money problems that 10 years
ago was among the first to try school-based governance, AFT
president Patrick O'Rourke said that perhaps one-third of the
teachers have grown so cynical and powerless they resist change.
   ``Having said all that,'' Tornillo said, ``come on in, the
water's fine. If we don't try reform, the public schools as we've
known them won't survive.''
