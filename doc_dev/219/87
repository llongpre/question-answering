   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., Chicago, said shareholder rights
activist Robert A.G. Monks received about 12.3% of the votes
cast in his unsuccessful bid for a board seat, according to
preliminary tallies supplied by its inspector of election.
Mr. Monks needed at least 25% of the votes cast to win.
   Still, the showing was within the range that Mr. Monks had
said he would be happy with, and he has vowed to run again
next year. Mr. Monks contends struggling Sears needs a truly
independent director, who will question, among other things,
whether the retailing and financial services giant should be
broken up.

   Management contends that Mr. Monks just wants to use Sears
as a guinea pig for an experiment in corporate governance.
Allowing him to join the board, Sears officials have said,
would distract the company from its crucial job of improving
earnings. Management also opposes a breakup. Sears said the
vote is subject to a final tabulation.
