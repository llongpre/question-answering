   A 15-mile antenna strung out like a giant
cross in the Chequamegon National Forest quietly sends radio
messages to missile-equipped submarines patrolling deep waters
around the world.
   The Navy began using the $400 million ELF system last fall,
replacing smaller transmitters that had been sending messages to
missile-equipped submarines since the late 1960s.
   The earlier project went through despite years of protests based
on fears that the low-frequency radio waves would fry fish in
nearby streams and produce two-headed squirrels.
   ``In the last two years, we have had only two protests of any
significance. Those folks were strictly anti-military,'' said Lt.
John Smythe, project commander. ``I think the biological,
ecological and safety issues have all been addressed.''
   At one point, demonstrations occurred almost weekly at the
fenced-in transmitter site in northwestern Wisconsin.
Nuclear-weapons opponents argued the system would make the forest a
target for Soviet missiles and environmentalists called for more
studies.
   ELF, or extremely low frequency, is the only system of its kind
that sends radio waves that penetrate water. The system permits
submarines to prowl undetected by radar while receiving messages
several hundred feet under water.
   The antenna _ two strands of cable strung on wooden poles _ and
a transmitter are tucked into the forest atop 20,000 feet of buried
rock near Clam Lake, a quiet tourist wayside.
   Bears frequently climb on the poles and snowmobiles glide
through a corridor carved in the trees.
   Jerry Holter and his wife, Tish, both 60, live about a mile from
the antenna and have watched the project unfold since 1969.
   ``They brought in peace activists by the busloads,'' Holter
recalled. ``You won't find anybody in the area that ever thought
the project would do all the things opponents claimed, including
make you sterile if you walked under the lines.''
   Mrs. Holter served as a ``human guinea pig'' for researchers
monitoring the medical effects of the system on nearby residents.
   ``We are both so darn healthy, it's funny,'' she said.
   But Mark Peterson, executive director of the Sigurd Olson
Environmental Institute of Northland College in Ashland, said the
project still has its skeptics. They point to studies that indicate
milk production of cows that graze near high voltage electrical
lines drops off, he said.
   The system _ and a companion one near K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base
south of Marquette, Mich. _ use a total of $60,000 worth of
electricity each month and employ about 75 people, mostly
civilians, Smythe said.
   ELF is scaled down considerably from the original plan, which
included a grid of 6,200 miles of buried cable and 100 transmitters
built to survive a nuclear war.
   Independent researchers spent years studying possible
environmental and ecological problems the giant antenna and its
radio waves might cause, Smythe said.
   Scientists checked to see if sparrows laid the same number of
eggs each spring. Offspring of birds and bees were measured and
weighed.
   ``There have been no squirrels with two heads and six legs. We
have not been able to detect any negative effects in the
biological-ecological system,'' Smythe said.
   But monitoring of homes and other testing in the area will
continue through 1991, Smythe said.
   Former Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., raised the first
environmental questions about the project in the late 1960s.
   ``I would say that they had resolved 90-plus percent of the
concerns I had at the time, perhaps 98 or 99 percent,'' said
Nelson, now an adviser with the Wilderness Society in Washington,
an environmental group that specializes in public lands' issues.
   Holter, a wood carver, said ELF, which looks like a small radio
station, is preferable to other alternatives.
   ``I think I feel more secure with that sitting in my backyard
than tons of battleships.''
