FT  31 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time for more circumspection

<TEXT>
Sir, It's a bit late in the day for Joe Rogaly to shed crocodile tears ('It
is a moral issue', January 13). His apparent revulsion at the vulgar
materialism resulting from 14 years of Thatcherism and the concomitant lack
of morality in British politics would have sounded far more convincing had
he taken a more critical attitude towards the Tories throughout the 1980s.
Mr Rogaly is lucky. With the benefit of hindsight he can take the moral high
ground without the loss of his job. However, no amount of preaching will
eradicate the misery of the millions whose misfortune it was to be guinea
pigs in a 14-year experiment in naive laisser faire economics.
I hope Mr Rogaly will not hesitate to use his column to be more circumspect
when the Tories begin expounding their next zealous conversion to whatever
economic religion they discover from books written long, long ago.
