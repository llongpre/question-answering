   In "Use of Staff Guinea Pigs Causes Squeals About Safety
of Firms' Product Testing" (Dec. 31), you describe a
McDonnell Douglas Corp. test in which numerous people were
injured in an airline-evacuation simulation. Your
prescription: computer simulations.
   The real conclusion is that airplanes are inherently
unsafe, even in a survivable crash, because too many people
are crammed into a space without adequate exit capabilities.

   Those of us who travel on the nation's commercial airlines
are totally at their mercy -- and we have precious little
clout. A test in which real people are injured is far more
dramatic and difficult to conceal (or rig) than a computer
simulation. Instead of decrying the use of human "guinea
pigs," you should be decrying the airlines' disregard for
their passengers' safety.
