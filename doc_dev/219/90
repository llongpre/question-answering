  [Text] The United Nations and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] may be optimistic about the 
outcome of the Lusaka peace talks, but the same cannot be said 
concerning the Luanda regime. Now that Eduardo dos Santos has 
lost every hope of turning UNITA into a pliable tool that he 
could easily manipulate, he has pulled the militarism trump out 
of his sleeve. The latest statements by [Angolan Armed Forces 
Chief of General Staff] Joao de Matos bear proof of that. 
  Under orders from Eduardo dos Santos, Joao de Matos 
yesterday 
told the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor 
Party [MPLA-PT] media that, quote, the Lusaka peace talks were a 
mere propaganda exercise, unquote. That is a very serious and 
irresponsible statement by Gen. Joao de Matos, and it reflects 
the [word indistinct] that has become so much part of the 
Futungo de Belas radical wing, which only cares for profits 
from its deals with foreign multinational companies, thereby 
forgetting completely about the Angolan people's suffering and 
famine. The Angolan people, who are closely following 
developments in Lusaka, are apprehensive and have repudiated the 
People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA, chief 
of General Staff's thoughtless remarks yesterday. Joao de 
Matos yesterday called on the Angolan people, who are fed up 
with the war, to arm and prepare for even more difficult times 
ahead. 
  Those remarks, which were seen in Angola as an insult to the 
fatherland, were made by the FAPLA chief shortly before he left 
Luanda for Brazil, where he will try to establish new military 
contacts. 
  According to a military source contacted by the Voice of the 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel yesterday, Brazil is today, 
along with the Russia, Cuba, and the DPRK, one of the main 
forces working for a holocaust in Angola. That military source 
also noted that Brazil is looking for a place where the war 
materiel it produces can be tested and sold, thereby turning 
into guinea pigs the people who live there. Brazil sees the 
MPLA-PT as fertile ground for testing its armament industry. 
  Our source also said that in past the MPLA-PT had received 
support from Russia, Cuba, Poland, the former Yugoslavia and 
GDR, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. Adding that such cooperation 
from opportunists and adventure seekers will not threaten the 
Angolan people's desire to achieve freedom, that source noted 
that, quote, the Angolan people will defend themselves until 
justice has been done in this country, unquote.
