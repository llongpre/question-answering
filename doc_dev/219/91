   Weight loss clinics need closer scrutiny by
the Federal Trade Commission, a congressman said today as he opened
hearings to investigate the growing fat-fighting industry.
   ``Most lay counselors and specialists in commercial diet clinics
are undertrained lay people operating without any medical
supervision,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   He said products sold in such clinics are untested, with little
or no scientific proof of their safety and effectiveness.
   Officials of major commercial weight-loss programs declined to
testify, the subcommittee staff said before the hearing.
   Wyden told FTC chairwoman Janet Steiger that he wanted her
agency to check weight-loss clinics for possible fraud and to work
with state attorneys general and other consumer fraud agencies to
police them.
   Steiger, who was the first witness before Wyden's House Small
Business subcommittee on regulation, said her agency has been
trying to weed out the most outrageous of the weight-loss schemes _
diet pills that are supposed to make you thinner while you sleep,
for example.
   ``Now we're taking a closer look at the weight loss clinics,''
she said.
   She advocated consumer education and said a task force within
her agency is trying to find ways the federal government can
coordinate with state government.
   ``We are encouraging state criminal enforcement where it is
appropriate,'' she said.
   Witnesses included women who had had medical problems after
going to weight loss clinics.
   A subcommittee staff report on the diet industry said that
despite optimistic claims, an estimated 90 percent of all dieters
who lose 25 pounds in a diet program regain the weight within two
years.
   It said Americans spent $33 billion on weight loss in 1989,
one-third of it for diet clinics alone. It cited a warning by the
American Medical Association that some diet formulas could lead to
complications and even fatalities among dieters.
   ``The worrisome trend is away from exercise and toward liquid
protein diets, virtually all of them sponsored by physicians and
hospitals, and so-called fast diets, which ignore nutritional
safety,'' the report said.
   Much of the growth in the industry has been due to heavy
advertising, which the FTC has largely ignored, the report said.
   The Food and Drug Administration has authority to regulate the
diet products.
   ``But in reality, few if any of these diet gadgets, drugs or
food have been tested for safety and effectiveness before patients
and consumers become unsuspecting guinea pigs,'' the staff report
said.
   It contended that many so-called diet experts, including
physicians, have little knowledge about how to treat obesity. The
products are often sold by people whose principal training is in
sales, not nutrition or medicine, it said.
   The report cited industry research estimating the nation has 65
million dieters, including half of all women. It said 60 percent of
all women are usually dieting in some form, and 18 percent of all
adults are constantly dieting; 25 percent of American adults are
obese and 13 percent are severely overweight.
