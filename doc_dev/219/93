   Cotter today is cleaning up the mill site as part of an $11
million environmental damage settlement reached in 1988 with the
state of Colorado.
   Phil Stoffey, the on-site cleanup coordinator for the state
health department's Radiation Control Division, estimates it will
take Cotter 20 years to clean up the site under the remedial action
plan.
   The company also faces a major lawsuit filed by Lincoln Park
residents. In August 1989, their anger over what they believe is a
high cancer rate and over Cotter's pollution problems spilled over
into a $550 million lawsuit filed in federal court in Denver. The
lawsuit claims uranium waste from the mill polluted the ground
water and was carried on the wind, causing damage to residents'
health and property.
   Nard Claar thinks Cotter was given too much leeway in how much
uranium waste it could discharge into the air - 30 tons per year.
   ``What happens to that? It blows over my house and my neighbor's
house,'' he says. ``To my knowledge, the Cotter Corp. didn't use us
as guinea pigs. But with 30 tons of uranium being allowed, there
was a radioactive cloud over this valley.''
   The state cancer register does not show an above-average
incidence of the disease among Fremont County residents, and the
state does not keep data on individual cities or neighborhoods.
   State health officials say it is difficult to assess the cancer
risk from exposure to Cotter's uranium mill wastes.
   ``It's long-range and low-level,'' says Ken Weaver of the
Radiation Control Division. ``We're not talking about the kind of
radioactivity ... where spending a few hours or days in front of
the uranium pile will cause cancer. It's the long-range, long-term
effects on health.''
   A 1981 federal study found evidence of kidney damage in 29 men
who worked at Cotter. And a 1987 attorney general's report said
Lincoln Park residents are ``receptors at risk'' if they drink
contaminated water, eat food irrigated with contaminated water or
grown in contaminated soil, or inhale dust or radon from mill
sources.
   The state in 1988 issued a warning that said Lincoln Park
residents face a potential health risk by drinking water
contaminated by the mill. Many Lincoln Park residents got their
water from wells whose water later was found to be contaminated
with uranium and molybdenum, a byproduct of uranium processing.
   While Lincoln Park residents press their concerns in court,
opinion is more divided among other Canon City residents.
   ``Everybody living in Fremont County is not cowering and
concerned that they will get cancer,'' says Pat Sherwood, executive
director of the Canon City Chamber of Commerce. She says the media
have implied that the entire community is concerned about becoming
ill, ``and it's just not true.''
   Jack Rothfleisch, the Cotter mill manager who is supervising the
site cleanup, does not think the cancer rate is any higher in
Lincoln Park than anyplace else.
   ``I think those people would have cancer if they were in the
middle of Nebraska, too,'' he says. ``As far as I'm concerned, I
don't think anybody has been harmed in any way by the exposure to
what we've done out here.''
   Cotter officials would not discuss the lawsuit, but they were
willing to speak about the company's special relationship with
Canon City.
   ``The relationship of the Cotter Corp. with the community has
been a close, enduring one in which the company and the community
have shared in some good times and some bad times,'' says Joe
McCluskey, Cotter vice president and general manager of the
company's Lakewood office.
   ``The company and its employees have always appreciated the
support of the community, and, likewise, the community has enjoyed
the support of the Cotter Corp. over many years.''
   Meanwhile, Sara Claar is seeking treatment in Denver for her
undiagnosed illness. Nard and Sara say one of their greatest
frustrations is not knowing what they face.
   ``I cannot say that Cotter made me sick,'' Mrs. Claar says.
``But I'd like to know what did. We've never been able to get a
definite answer. Now, at least they're testing.''
