   A human guinea pig says she made friends
with mice and learned some English during her 130 days in an
underground cave to help researchers study the effects of isolation.
   Stefania Follini of Ancona, Italy, smiled and waved at reporters
and well-wishers as she emerged Tuesday afternoon from Lost Cave,
ending an experiment that began on Jan. 13.
   Would she do it again?
   ``Sure,'' said the 27-year-old interior decorator, who
volunteered for the experiment.
   Miss Follini, who lost 17 pounds during her solitude and now
weighs 90 pounds, appeared healthy and happy as she answered
questions from reporters.
   Although she had no contact with humans, except through
computers, Miss Follini said she didn't feel lonely during the
experiment and adopted two cave mice as pets. She named them
Giuseppe and Nicoleta.
   ``There was some difficulty in communicating with the mice,''
she said through an interpreter. ``But I was always right.''
   The experiment was designed to resemble interplanetary travel.
The University of Ancona in Italy, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and several U.S. universities took part in the
experiment.
   Miss Follini's only contact with the outside world was through
computer terminals linked between her 10-foot-square
plastic-enclosed underground habitat and the researchers' house
trailer above the cave.
   She had no clocks, her menstrual cycle stopped, and she lost
track of how many days had passed. When she was told Monday the
experiment was almost over, she thought she had been in the cave
about 80 days. She tended to sleep about 10 hours and stay awake 20
to 25 hours.
   Three video cameras and microphones monitored Miss Follini
constantly. Only the bathroom was out of sight of cameras. She said
she didn't mind the lack of privacy.
   ``I rarely thought about it,'' she said. ``Sometimes I felt it
was a strong presence, but generally I was not bothered by that.''
   When Miss Follini climbed out of the cave into the midday sun,
she appeared disoriented for a few seconds. But she quickly donned
sunglasses handed to her, then grinned and waved at the 60
onlookers.
   At the news conference, she said she thinks her isolation will
make her more thoughtful, outgoing and decisive. And she said her
outlook has improved.
   ``I consider myself more important,'' she said. ``I love myself
more and consequently I can love people and the world more.''
   Scientists plan to examine her intensively during the next few
months to find out if her isolation affected her mentally and
physically.
   For example, project coordinator Maurizio Montalbini _ who spent
210 days in a cave two years ago _ believes the isolation will help
Miss Follini's concentration. A NASA-affiliated research team at
the University of Texas Medical School in Houston plans to test
that Monday by monitoring Miss Follini's brain waves while she
solves computer-generated problems.
   Other scientists will be drawing blood and checking her immune
system, bones, muscles and coordination. Some believe her immune
system was suppressed, her bones lost calcium and her muscles
weakened.
   But Montalbini said he thinks Miss Follini might surprise
researchers. He said she kept her strength and flexibility by doing
calisthenics and judo and maintained her poise by keeping busy by
reading and decorating her living area.
   The researchers chose Lost Cave because it maintains a constant
climate of 74 degrees and 99 percent humidity and is relatively
close to Houston, home to NASA and many researchers.
   Before the experiment began, Miss Follini said she was taking
English textbooks with her and would answer questions in English.
She did understand simple questions and was able to answer in short
English phrases, but she didn't master the language in 130 days.
   ``When she was down there, she had English and Spanish books to
learn,'' said translator Rita Fraschini. ``But the English one was
difficult and boring, so she switched to the Spanish one, which was
funny.''
