   Workers at government nuclear weapons plants
told a congressional panel Wednesday they were deceived for decades
by superiors on the health hazards of working with radioactive
materials such as plutonium and uranium.
   ``We were told the levels were too low to harm us,'' said David
Day, a worker and union official at the Fernald uranium processing
plant in Ohio. He said superiors told him over the years that
handling the radioactive materials ``was like working with lead''
and no more a risk than crossing the street.
   The testimony came before the Senate Government Affairs
Committee, which said there have been at least 30 studies over the
years describing various health problems among workers and
residents near the Energy Department facilities.
   ``The historical record provides little comfort,'' said
committee chairman Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio. He said workers at
plant sites must be assured they are protected from health and
safety dangers and be provided accurate information on health risks.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins acknowledged the department's
program to determine the health hazards facing weapons plant
workers is ``a mess.'' He said the department has no clear picture
of how much physical harm workers have suffered over the years from
exposure to radioactive materials and wastes.
   Watkins said that when he took over the department in March, he
found the program to follow such health effects ``buried deep
within the bureaucracy ... understaffed, under funded and under
utilized.''
   But he balked at suggestions by Glenn and other senators that an
outside agency should oversee the department's monitoring program.
``I now it's a mess. I need people to clean it up more than I need
oversight right now,'' Watkins testified.
   The department's own information is so bad, said Watkins, he has
relied heavily on outside scientific review panels.
   ``Sometimes the reports coming in from the field are not really
true,'' said the secretary.
   He said statistical information on past worker exposure to
radiation at and near the plants is being examined again to more
accurately guage the health risks. He also said information on the
health of 600,000 present and past plant workers is being assembled
and will be made available to outside scientists, but the central
data bank is not expected to be completed until 1995.
   The secretary promised a shakeup in the department's health
monitoring program and said it would be opened to review by an
outside committee of experts.
   A panel of plant workers and union representatives voiced
similar concerns.
   The history of the Energy Department on health and safety issues
``is one of denial, coverup, inefficiency and betrayal,'' declared
Robert Wages, a vice president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers Union. The union represents 5,000 workers at various
nuclear weapons facilities.
   Wages said questions about worker safety and exposure to
hazardous materials was raised nearly two decades ago in
congressional hearings and elsewhere, but nothing changed.
   Wages and other union officials, as well as several present
employees at plants, said too often workers have kept silent for
fear of losing their jobs and because of repeated assurances that
the health concerns were being exaggerated by critics.
   ``We are the guinea pigs. We perform important and dangerous
work, but are made to feel expendable,'' said Jesse Abney, 55, a
chemical operator at the Fernald plant in Ohio.
   Tests have shown Abney to have plutonium in his body and uranium
in his lungs.
   ``Despite my precautions (at work over the years) I am
contaminated,'' he told the senators and noted rumors the
government may close the Fernald plant in the near future.
   ``Will I be able to find another job and still support my
family? Would another company be willing to cover me under their
health insurance?'' he asked.
