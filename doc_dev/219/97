   A judge assigned Monday to the case against
a man accused of killing two women kept chained in a basement with
four other women promptly ordered attorneys to stop answering
reporters' questions.
   Common Pleas Judge Lynn Abraham was given the case of Gary
Heidnik and immediately met with Assistant District Attorney
Charles Gallagher and Heidnik's lawyer, A. Charles Peruto Jr.
   ``I've been gagged,'' Peruto said after the meeting.
   Heidnik is accused of capturing women he lured to his north
Philadelphia home, where police said he raped them, fed them dog
food and eventually killed two of them. Police said Sandra Lindsay
died of asphyxiation while hanging from a sewer pipe and Deborah
Dudley was electrocuted when touched by wires while she stood in a
water-filled basement pit.
   Testimony a a preliminary hearing alleged Heidnik used a power
saw to cut up Ms. Lindsay's body, stored parts in his kitchen
freezer and allegedly cooked pieces of the flesh.
   Pending before Abraham are Peruto's requests to have a jury
selected from outside Philadelphia, or to move the trial.
   Abraham said she has other cases pending and might be able to
hold hearings on the motions Friday or Monday.
   Peruto said before he met with the judge that he could see no
way his client could get a fair trial in Philadelphia.
   ``I don't think there is a Philadelphian around who doesn't know
about the case and wants him to'' die for the deaths, Peruto said.
``I'd like it tried in Nome, Alaska, or even further away.''
   ``Our defense will be insanity,'' he added.
   Gallagher is seeking the death penalty.
   Ms. Dudley's body was found by police in a wooded area in
southern New Jersey, after they were led there by a woman who
managed to escape from Heidnik's basement torture chamber.
   Heidnik financed his house of horrors by playing the stock
market, and accumulating more than $500,000 as the self-styled head
of a religious order he founded called United Church of the
Ministers of God. Peruto insists the financial success has no
bearing on whether his client is sane.
   Peruto claims that Heidnik's mental condition was aggravated
during Army service in the 1960s when he allegedly was the subject
of LSD hallucinogenic tests.
   ``I found that my client was a guinea pig for the U.S. Army and
it will be proven beyond any doubt,'' the lawyer said earlier.
