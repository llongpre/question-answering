The opening edition of Channel 4's great egg race, which is called Beat That
Einstein, did not resist the temptation to talk down to us. Simple
scientific ideas were explained as to a four-year-old, and the presenter
proved willing to do anything - lie in the bath, fall in the sea - to appear
matey. So here is one viewer who will not be watching when today's guinea
pigs attempt to build a tree house and a flying machine (8.00). Last week
Ludovic Kennedy argued a revisionist version of the Lucky Lucan story, this
week it is ITV's turn. The Trial Of Lord Lucan brings the evidence to a
courtroom setting and a 'real' jury tries him (8.30). Dawn French takes the
title role in BBC1's new comedy series The Vicar Of Dibley, thus adding a
new dimension to the 'All Gas And Gaiters' school of comedy which has, so
far, been all-male (8.30). The X-Files carries on a tradition of fantasy
drama for grown up audiences which has always been stronger in North America
than in Britain. Today agents Mulder and Scully investigate scientists who
have been driven to suicide in Alaska (9.00 BBC2).
