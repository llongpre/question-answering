   The crowd was smaller, the musicians amateur
and Saabs replaced sandals as the favored form of transportation,
but hundreds of people donned tie-dyed shirts to conjure the spirit
of Woodstock anyway.
   Twenty years after Richie Havens opened the Woodstock festival
before 400,000 people, the late Max Yasgur's old farm filled with
revelers Tuesday to celebrate one of rock 'n' roll's most sacred
anniversaries.
   ``It was a deeply spiritual experience and certainly people would
want to come back,'' said comedian Wavy Gravy, the only one of
Woodstock's original performers.
   Gravy, wearing a beanie with a propeller and carrying a walking
stick topped with a pig's snout, waved to festival veterans before
being ushered into a forest of satellite dishes for one of dozens of
interviews.
   More free enterprise than free love was evident at the upstate
New York meadow as tourists could choose between T-shirts emblazoned
with ``I survived the Woodstock Reunion'' and ``Was I Late?''
   ``I really honor the people whose spread this is for allowing
this to take place,'' Gravy said. ``It's very folksy.''
   It wasn't without a price. A man who said he was a relative of
the field's new owners, Louis Nicky and June Gelish of New York
City, asked a $5 ``field restoration'' donation from each carload.
Police said the owners squabbled with merchants who tried to sell
their wares.
   True to the spirit of the original Woodstock, when fans swarmed
over fences to transform it into a free concert, some motorists just
waited until the landlord looked the other way and snuck their
vehicles onto the field.
   Police were on hand to make sure traffic kept moving. There were
no arrests, said Sgt. Charles Kulick of the Sullivan County
Sheriff's Department. He estimated the crowd at about 600, the
largest of a celebration that had been building for a week.
   The most tension came when television reporters, nervously
approaching 6 p.m. deadlines, competed for space near the
commemorative plaque that is the only permanent fixture on the
alfalfa field.
   ``I didn't really know what to expect,'' said Ralph Corwin, a
resident of upstate New York who said he attended the original show
and has returned every year since. ``I'm just thankful that they let
us go back. The numbers have fallen down but the spirit hasn't
died.''
   On the same corner where Jimi Hendrix, the Who, the Jefferson
Airplane and the Grateful Dead performed 20 years earlier, a
makeshift stage was built for stray amateur guitarists. One singer
replaced Country Joe McDonald's infamous ``Gimme an `F''' cheer with
the more modest L-O-V-E spellalong.
