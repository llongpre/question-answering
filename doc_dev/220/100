<LEADPARA>  THE media seems intent these days on coining words to pigeonhole "new" ideas.
Movies such as "Rain Man" that combine comedy and drama are "dramedies."
Fictional recreations of real events are "docudramas." And "lite news" shows
such as "Entertainment Tonight" are "infotainment.";    It's about time video
got in on the fun. And so we herewith unveil the latest buzzword:
"docutainment," short for "entertaining documentaries."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CALL IT 'DOCUTAINMENT,' OR SOMETHING
NEW TAPE RELEASES HEAVY ON LIGHT DOCUMENTARIES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Let's define docutainment as theatrically released documentaries designed
more to amuse than to educate. This week and next, we'll suggest a total of 10
such entries -- any one of which is an adequate Saturday night substitute for
the latest Hollywood blockbuster.;    And if you learn something along the
way, we apologize in advance.;    (box) "The Thin Blue Line" (1988; HBO;
unrated). On the night of Nov. 29, 1976, a Dallas police officer was shot to
death, allegedly by one Randall Dale Adams, who was subsequently tried, found
guilty, and sentenced to death for the crime. But was he really guilty?;   
Using little more than filmed interviews and dramatic re-creations, director
Errol Morris presents a spellbinding story of justice gone horribly and
obviously awry. This mesmerizing movie plays more like a murder mystery than a
dry documentary; furthermore, it prompted a reopening of the case, which
established the innocence of Randall Adams and resulted in his release from
prison: a factual finale rivaling the best of Hollywood's fictional happy
endings.;    (box) "Roger &amp; Me" (1989; Warner; rated PG). When General Motors
closed its hometown plant in Flint, Mich., a large portion of the town's
population found themselves out of a job, resulting in the virtual economic
collapse of Flint. This made filmmaker Michael Moore, one-time resident of
Flint, angry and confused, so he set out to confront GM Chairman Roger Smith
with a camera and a question: "Why?" During his convoluted quest, Moore gets
sidetracked -- frequently, humorously, and often ironically -- as he
satirically chronicles the effects of the town's collapse on its suffering
citizens, and the desperate attempts at revitalization.;    (box) "For All
Mankind" (1989; Voyager/Superior; unrated). No documentary on the space
program understands its awesome appeal better than "For All Mankind."
Thousands of hours of crystal-clear film footage from NASA's vaults were
edited into a single, representative moon mission and complemented with an
understated narration by most of the handful of astronauts who made the trip.
The result is a vicarious voyage: a distilled description combining visual
majesty, otherworldly wonder and quiet excitement.;    (box) "Woodstock"
(1970; Warner; R). While straight society pushed outward into space in the
'60s, the counter-culture was busy on a similar trip, exploring the vast
uncharted regions of inner space, as during this quarter-million-strong
"gathering of the tribes" in upstate New York for a three-day festival of
peace, love, music and too few toilets. Once a social document of a social
phenomenon, "Woodstock" endures as non-threatening nostalgia, full of great
tunes and fascinating filmmaking.;    (box) "Gizmo!" (1977; Warner; unrated).
In his PBS series "Connections," writer James Burke explains the fascinating
links between basic discoveries and successful modern products. "Gizmo!"
(which might be titled "Disconnections") illustrates the other side: the
flops, failures and dead-end devices that cranks and crackpots have tinkered
together over the years. This parade of goofy gadgets, culled mostly from
black and white newsreels, includes a host of ingenious machines destined for
(and deserving of) oblivion. If invention is trial and error, "Gizmo!" is a
whimsical tribute to the latter; a paean to misguided gearheads whose
eccentric visions surpassed their common sense.  </TEXT>
