   Most Woodstock-anniversary revelers left the
site of the 1969 concert Sunday, ending a week-long celebration and
leaving behind the mud and memories of yesteryear, as well as mounds
of empty beer cans.
   Despite the lack of big-name entertainers, the unsanctioned
gathering swelled to 20,000 as people came to mark the 20th
anniversary of the rock 'n' roll concert that has become a symbol of
the '60s youth movement.
   Like its predecessor, the celebration of the Woodstock Music and
Art Festival was mostly peaceful, but it was marred by a fight late
Saturday night in which a man was stabbed.
   Joseph Basto, 39, of Newburgh, N.Y., was stabbed in the abdomen
by an unidentified man at about 11 p.m. Saturday, according to
Sullivan County Sheriff Joseph Wasser. Basto was reported in
critical condition Sunday at Harris Community General Hospital.
   Wasser said no arrest has been made and police were still
interviewing witnesses to the incident Sunday.
   ``When you have 15,000 people, you can have anything,'' Wasser
said of the stabbing. ``When you go into a bar with 20 people you
can have an assault.''
   The gathering began early last week with a handful of people and
mushroomed to about 20,000 people Friday night.
   Revelers were packing up their tents and makeshift camps, and
Wasser said only about 3,500 remained Sunday in the sloping alfalfa
field in the Catskill Mountains 110 miles northwest of New York
City. Despite its name, the festival actually took place in Bethel,
about 50 miles southeast of Woodstock.
   As it was 20 years ago, the late Max Yasgur's farm was turned
into a muddy mess by celebrants and by a cold, hard rain that began
Saturday evening and lasted into Sunday morning.
   About 400,000 young people converged on the farm Aug. 15-17,
1969, to listen to music by some of rock 'n' roll's biggest stars.
   Local musicians supplied most of the entertainment this time,
although Melanie, who performed here 20 years ago, showed up early
Friday morning and sang two songs on a makeshift stage.
   The lack of big-name stars didn't discourage many celebrants.
Though the town of Bethel staunchly refused to sanction any
organized event commemorating the concert, traffic was backed up
along several of the roads as people poured in to set up camp and
party.
   Though there were about a dozen drug-related arrests over the
weekend, alcohol _ mainly beer _ seemed to be the drug of choice
among the crowd, which ranged in age from 6 to 60. Some brought
kegs, others hauled in truckloads of cases.
   ``A lot of people here are heavy beer drinkers,'' said Joe Rogers
of Queens. ``Drugs are rare.''
   Crime was rare, though someone did make off with Rogers' spare
clothes, leaving him standing in a cold rain wearing shorts, a
long-sleeved shirt and running shoes. He said he had $4 left to get
him home.
   ``It's kind of disappointing. It kind of misses the point of all
this,'' Rogers said. But, he added, ``I have never had so much fun
in my life.''
