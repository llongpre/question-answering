   In the spirit of the concert it's
commemorating, an unofficial Woodstock reunion is slowly coming
together with borrowed gear and donated services.
   By late Friday night cars were lining all the roads leading to
the farm where 400,000 people spent three days _ Aug. 15-17, 1969 _
listening to music, getting high and enduring shortages of food,
water and hygienic outlets.
   Unlike the original Woodstock concert, no rock stars were within
miles, but thousands of people were still pouring onto the site
regarded as sacred ground to those nostalgic for the rock culture of
the 1960s.
   Police estimate this weekend's gathering will attract up to
100,000 people, and by Friday some 35,000 had descended on the
49-acre farm 60 miles north of New York City, said Sgt. Charles
Kulick of the Sullivan County Sheriff's Department.
   Most people were willing to pay a $5 ``donation'' to gain
entrance to the farm, although there was no guarantee of
entertainment. By Friday evening local musicians were performing on
a makeshift stage using donated sound equipment powered by a donated
generator.
   ``We had no idea it would grow into this,'' said Richard Pell, as
he stood on the stage and gestured toward the crowd spread about the
sloping field.
   Pell, the unofficial coordinator of the unofficial event, said
the project started earlier in the week with a handful of guitarists
playing for a few dozen people.
   A three-day reunion concert, held 12 miles away at the Imperial
Resort in Swan Lake, flopped Thursday when only 250 people showed up
to hear performers like Edgar Winter and Woodstock veteran John
Sebastian. Bruce Taylor, the vice president of the Imperial Hotel,
offered to move Friday night's concert to the Woodstock field, but
Bethel city officials wouldn't allow it.
   ``It's not going to happen,'' said town supervisor Allan Scott.
``There's enough frenzy here already.''
   Authorities had made one drug arrest by Friday night and two
people were hospitalized, one for a drug overdose and another for
acute alchoholism.
   The urge to celebrate history's most famous rock 'n' roll concert
at its actual site and not at a Catskill Mountain resort drew a
cross-section of American culture: hippies and ex-hippies, bikers,
legions of Grateful Dead followers known as Dead-heads, businessmen
on their lunch hour, middle-aged tourists, housewives and Hasidic
Jews from nearby Catskill communities.
   ``My husband went to the first one and said we should go every
day this week and we have,'' said Lorrie Maus, a 33-year-old mother
from nearby Youngsville who brought her two children.
   Around them other children played, dogs chased each other and
music from hundreds of car stereos and acoustic guitars filled the
natural amphitheater, which was ringed by cars, buses, tents and
vendors.
   Trevor Boustead, a veteran of Woodstock, fondly recalled the late
Max Yasgur, on whose farm the original festival was held.
   ``That Yasgur, he was a good dude,'' Boustead said, recalling how
the dairy farmer gave out free milk during the concert.
``Everybody's doing the same thing now. Everybody's still friendly.
The only thing that's different is all the cars and tents.''
   Yasgur's farm now belongs to brothers Jeff And Charlie Gelish,
who were paying for half of the cost of providing water and portable
toilets for the reunion gathering.
   ``This is not a commercial venture,'' Jeff Gelish said.
   Proceeds from the entrance donation will go toward cleaning and
reseeding the field, he said. A local garbage company and a
volunteer ambulance corps are lending their services free of charge,
Gelish said.
