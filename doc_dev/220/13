   It was raining in Queens when two of my friends and I began what
normally is a two-hour drive to Bethel, N.Y., a spot on the map
that didn't exist to most people before the early summer of 1969.
   ``It's in the middle of the Catskills,'' I mentioned knowingly,
having spent most of my childhood summers in that area. ``Near
White Lake, not far from Monticello.''
   Right. In a couple of hours, we'd be jamming with Joe Cocker,
cruising with Crosby, Stills and Nash.
   As I headed to the concert that would attract nearly half a
million people and the attention of the world, all I could think
about was the music. The Who, the Airplane, Janis Joplin, Jimi
Hendrix, Creedence, Sly.
   The first inkling that this wasn't going to be your normal
weekend came from the radio as we drove north.
   ``The concert at Bethel already is a disaster,'' the newscaster
said. ``Local law enforcement officials are warning people to stay
away. Traffic is backed up for miles, there aren't enough supplies
at the site, tickets are useless because the fences surrounding the
area have been torn down and the weather forecast calls for heavy
rain.''
   Time to speed up. Don't want to miss any of this.
   About 90 minutes later, we approached the beginning of the
Catskill region. We noticed dozens of hitchhikers with backpacks,
coolers, even collapsed lean-tos. But no traffic jams; no rain.
   The exit ramp we needed was uphill. You don't see Route 17B
until you're practically on it. We never got on it. It was blocked
by state troopers, who were detouring all cars _ away from the
Band, Richie Havens, Canned Heat and Arlo Guthrie.
   Damn.
   ``Don't worry,'' I said with too much smugness. ``I know the
back roads.''
   ``All roads to Bethel are closed, blocked by hundreds of cars
filled with frustrated rock 'n' roll fans,'' the radio man was
saying, with nearly as much smugness as I displayed moments earlier.
   ``Not these roads, baby,'' I replied.
   We drove almost to the foot of the great meadow on Max Yasgur's
farm. All we needed was to get around a bend that would lead
directly to the site. Except there was no road left. It had become
a parking lot. So we pulled into a ditch, locked up the car and _
minus blankets, spare clothes and, I guess, our senses _ we headed
toward the music.
   After walking less than a mile, it began to rain.
Four-and-a-half miles further, we climbed a short hill and ...
   People.
   And more people.
   The music had stopped in deference to the weather. But the waves
of humanity didn't stop within my field of sight.
   And nobody was complaining. They were soaking wet, hungry,
disappointed that the stage was, for now, empty.
   They didn't yell about it. They didn't fight. They shared what
they had. One group let us crawl underneath a makeshift tent of
plastic and gave us beer and potato chips, which wound up being the
bill of fare for the weekend.
   The storm ended early enough for the concert to resume. We were
at least one-quarter mile from the stage, back near the concession
stands that were closed. There was a distinct aroma in the air, but
it had nothing to do with barbecues.
   Late Friday night, Joan Baez sang ``We Shall Overcome,'' and
anyone who had something they could light did so.
   We found space under one of the closed concessions and slept the
best we could. That afternoon, I got my introduction to Santana, as
did thousands of others who would make ``Soul Sacrifice'' an anthem
for Woodstock. It could have been 200 degrees in the shade and it
wouldn't have been as hot as the set Santana played.
   And Creedence Clearwater Revival, the group I most wanted to
hear. The four-member band put a spell on the crowd from beginning
to end with probably their best live performance ever.
   At night, there was Joplin screaming her way through ballads,
Sly getting everyone up to dance to the music and The Who
presenting the rock opera ``Tommy'' until dawn.
   Sunday morning _ and the Jefferson Airplane was just starting
its set.
   I must have been sleeping when Joe Cocker got started. I had
heard of him but didn't expect the near-spastic movements, the
gravelly voice, the lack of all conventions. I loved it.
   By now, however, the lack of substantial meals, the squalor of
the portable bathrooms and the general discomfort were more than
annoying. By early Sunday evening, a lot of people had left.
   As Cocker was finishing, it began to rain.
   A chant of ``No Rain, No Rain,'' began. Instead, we got more
rain, more rain.
   When it stopped, we thought of leaving. But Country Joe and the
Fish came on stage. The festive mood was long since gone, but the
music wasn't.
   Later Sunday, Yasgur made a speech and got a tremendous ovation,
the kind you heard when Joe Namath threw a touchdown pass.
   That night, Crosby, Stills and Nash performed. They would become
megastars, but they were awful at Woodstock. The crowd was getting
antsy to hear Hendrix and go home, and the out-of-synch vocals of
this new group were bothersome.
   I fell asleep.
   I remember waking up and hearing ``Teen Angel'' playing on
someone's radio, except there weren't any nearby. So I walked
toward the stage and saw these guys dressed in gold lame outfits
dancing around, posturing and singing hits from the '50s. Sha Na
Na. Somehow, they seemed to fit just right.
   By the time Hendrix appeared, the crowd had thinned to a more
manageable 100,000 or so. I knew this was the end and, for the only
time I can remember, it didn't matter if Hendrix played five songs
or five hours.
   As he played the ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' I took my watch
from my pocket and looked at it for the first time all weekend.
   A few years later, I went back with my fiancee. Jimi was gone.
So was Janis. It was nothing more than a big, lush cow pasture. No
crowds. No music.
   ``It didn't seem special then,'' I said. ``It was just a great
concert.
   ``But if I ever get the chance to go back and relive one
experience, this would be it.''
