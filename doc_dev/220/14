   Twenty years after it rocked the nation, the Woodstock festival reverberates
in America's consciousness, a
national poll has found. But people say Woodstock's hallmark, rock 'n'
roll music, has lost its tune.
   Most Americans have heard of the three-day counterculture concert,
three in 10 of them wish they'd been there and nearly six in
10 say it has had a lasting effect on society, the Media General-Associated
Press poll found.
   But the view of Woodstock was not idealized. Only half those who saw
a lasting impact said it was a positive one, and just a
quarter of the 1,163 respondents said the Woodstock era was a better time
than today.
   Featuring many of the top rock 'n' roll bands of the day, Woodstock
drew half a million people to a muddy farm in upstate New
York from Aug. 15-17, 1969. The term ``Woodstock Nation'' soon came to
describe young people demanding an end to the Vietnam War and
the loosening of social mores.
   Of the eight in 10 respondents who had heard of Woodstock, 70 percent
said they regarded it more as the expression of a social
movement than simply a music festival. And half of them said that social
movement continues today.
   Woodstock-era rock 'n' roll did well in the test of time: Rock music
of the Woodstock days was rated twice as highly as today's
rock 'n' roll, and nearly half of all respondents said they still listen
to Woodstock rock.
   The poll, conducted by telephone among a random sample of respondents
July 7-16, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
   It found a distinct generational split in views of Woodstock. Forty
percent of the respondents younger than 45 would have liked
to have attended, for example, compared with just 10 percent of the older
respondents.
   Moreover, among people who said the festival had a lasting social impact,
more than 60 percent of the younger group said it was a
positive effect, while only about a quarter of older respondents agreed.
   Interest in rock music followed similar lines. More than 60 percent
of those under 45 said they listen to Woodstock-era rock 'n'
roll now, evidence of the sizable audience for ``classic rock'' radio programming.
Of those 45 and older, just 22 percent were tuned
in to Woodstock rock.
   Overall, half rated rock music of the late 1960s and early 1970s as
excellent or good, while just 27 percent gave favorable
ratings to today's rock 'n' roll. Among respondents under 45, seven in
10 gave high ratings to Woodstock rock, while only four in 10
approved of newer rock.
   Twenty percent of the respondents said they knew someone who attended
the Woodstock festival, and 2 percent, or 25 of the 1,163
people polled, said they were there.
