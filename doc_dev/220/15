   About 500 people marked the approaching 20th
anniversary of the Woodstock music festival by camping in the rain
Saturday at the late Max Yasgur's farm.
   A mix of original festival-goers, teen-agers, yuppies and
remnants of the hippie days set up camp in the field nearly 75
miles northwest of New York City to mark the coming anniversary of
Woodstock.
   Rain turned parts of the farm into mud reminiscent of the Aug.
15-17, 1969, festival, which about 400,000 people attended.
   The land's current owners, Charley and Debbie Gelish, allowed
scores of people to camp out on a field without charge, but asked
vendors selling food, T-shirts and souvenirs for donations to
repair the field and spruce up the property.
   Traffic was moving along smoothly, Bethel Supervisor Allan Scott
said. Roads near the site had been converted to one-way trafic to
improve trafic flow.
   A Woodstock commemorative concert is scheduled for Thursday,
Friday and Saturday at the Imperial Resort Hotel in nearby Swan
Lake. The resort hopes to draw 4,000 people to the event.
