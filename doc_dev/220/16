   About 150 people kept vigil Monday at the
site of the Woodstock concert on the eve of the legendary event's
20th anniversary, police said.
   Police said campers on the farm once owned by Max Yasgur were
quietly milling about Monday as people strummed guitars, bought food
from vendors and watched movies on videocassette recorders powered
by portable generators.
   ``It's very quiet and orderly. No problems,'' Sullivan County
Sheriff Joseph Wasser said.
   Wasser said police have been keeping watch around the clock since
Saturday, but there have been no incidents or arrests.
   A mixture of original festival-goers and other people _ some not
even born when the original concert was held Aug. 15-17, 1969 _ have
been camping out since Saturday at the site of the festival that
drew about 400,000 people.
   The 500 or so people who showed up at the field Saturday found at
least one thing the same from 20 years ago _ the weather. Rain
discouraged revelers and by Sunday only about 200 people were
camping on the farm now owned by Charley and Debbie Gelish.
   The weather improved Monday, police said.
   Wasser said police expected more people to arrive through the
rest of the week in the tiny Sullivan County town of about 3,000,
but not too many.
   ``It's not like we're expecting an onslaught,'' Wasser said.
   Still, roads near the site had been converted to one-way to
improve traffic flow and will stay that way until Sunday, Wasser
said.
   While Bethel is planning no official remembrance on Woodstock's
20th anniversary, the Imperial resort hotel in Swan Lake is staging
a ``Remember Woodstock'' concert Aug. 17-19 featuring such Woodstock
alumni as Bert Sommer, Melanie and John Sebastian.
