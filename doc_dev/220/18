   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The name ``Woodstock'' evokes musical memories,
and not just of the long-ago '60s. To a new generation of
musicians, the upstate New York hamlet is still among the best
places to make records, with all the equipment and none of the
exhaust fumes of Los Angeles or New York.

   Record producer Bob Clearmountain is used
to the skeptical looks he gets when he invites musicians to this
upstate New York hamlet to make records.
   ``They get this picture in their minds of a gang of hippies
running around,'' says Clearmountain, producer or mixer for Bruce
Springsteen, the Pretenders and dozens of other artists.
   Woodstock may always be synonymous with the festival that bears
its name, the last great party of the flower children before the
'70s set in.
   But to a new generation of musicians, this town of boutiques and
endless back roads has a growing reputation as one of the best
places to make a record outside the music capitals of Los Angeles
and New York.
   Like Max Yasgur's farm, the Bearsville Studio is not actually in
Woodstock. It's about two miles west, atop a hill reached by a
winding, unmarked dirt road that in winter sometimes takes two or
three attempts to climb by car.
   Despite the location, Suzanne Vega found Bearsville to record
her breakthrough hit, ``Luka.'' Robbie Robertson returned to the
site of ``Big Pink'' to mix his comeback album. Artists as diverse
as Simple Minds, Cher, Allen Ginsberg and Loudness have laid down
tracks at Bearsville in the last year.
   The big draw? A country ambiance and equipment that makes
technicians like Clearmountain marvel.
   ``It's one of my favorite studios,'' Clearmountain says. ``It's
very versatile. The recording room is very large and it's very good
for recording drums and guitars. It has a lot of air and a lot of
space ... The other room is one of the best mixing rooms that I've
ever worked in.''
   The studio is part of the late Albert Grossman's mini-empire in
the village of Bearsville, a hundred miles north of Manhattan. The
one-time manager of Bob Dylan, the Band and Janis Joplin bought a
restaurant, homes and offices and built the studio before his death
two years ago.
   The Bearsville record label, whose best-known client was fellow
resident Todd Rundgren, has been inactive since Grossman's death.
But the studio, once used almost exclusively by Bearsville artists,
has seen more action.
   ``We just kind of intensified it,'' says Grossman's widow,
Sally, who now runs the company.
   Sally Grossman may talk eagerly of the Greenwich Village clubs
she grew up around in the '60s, but her studio has the air of a
corporate retreat.
   Fresh-smelling wood paneling and blackened windows blend the
modern and rustic. Framed pictures of the cover art of albums
recorded in Bearsville during the past year line the walls of
second-floor offices.
   Halfway down the hill is one of a handful of private homes
Grossman has converted into apartments for clients to use while
recording. A second house, separated by a Catskill mountain stream
and wooden bridge, has been converted into a rehearsal studio.
   ``It's in Woodstock, not in downtown Manhattan, and if you want
to get some air you just walk outside,'' Clearmountain says. ``You
don't walk outside and get hit by bus fumes.''
   A producer with deadlines also doesn't have to worry about
distractions that cause musicians' minds to wander. Outside of a
ping pong or pool table and a nearby vegetable stand, there's not a
whole lot to do in Woodstock.
   And groupies? They'd have to be pretty determined.
   ``A lot of the groups prefer working here because of the
privacy,'' says Mary Lou Arnold, a former backup singer to Rundgren
who's acting manager of the studio. ``We maintain very strict
security. I can count on one hand the number of times fans have
been able to find this place. And when they do, they quickly go
away.''
   Of course, the isolation can quickly grow old. Clearmountain
says artists on extended projects like to split their time between
Bearsville and the city. Musicians who need to rent equipment also
have to wait longer for it to arrive.
   Bearsville's studio is also the beneficiary of the current trend
toward spacious rooms _ the better for bands to set up and run
through songs live.
   ``The people who built it, I don't think they knew what they
were doing. But the way it was built works very well,''
Clearmountain says. ``Most studios are very claustrophobic, with
lots of wires, amplifiers and drums lying around that people can
trip over. That studio is so big, you can either set up everybody
tight in a corner or spread everybody out.''
   Bearsville's growing appeal is more than technical. When a hit
record is produced there, it sets in motion music's infamous herd
mentality.
   ``We get a lot of calls from people who are new who think if
they just come in here, they'll get a hit record,'' Arnold says.
   A long walk away from the studio, the town of Woodstock is a
jumble of small shops and restaurants. Even on a brisk winter's
day, a long-haired, middle-aged man or two stands idly in a small
park, watching traffic go by.
   Woodstock already had a long history as an artist's colony
before musicians discovered it in the '60s. When Dylan moved here
from New York City, it instantly became a magnet for hipsters and
aspiring hipsters.
   It was in Woodstock, in a house dubbed ``Big Pink,'' that the
Band recorded some of its best music, including the famed
``basement tapes'' with Dylan. At the time, Dylan was recovering
from a near-fatal motorcycle accident.
   Woodstock's singular event, the three-day concert that attracted
450,000 people and such artists as Joplin, the Who, Jimi Hendrix
and Sly and the Family Stone, took place in 1969. Its actual
location was several miles away in Bethel.
   The area's musical history comes alive in cans of tapes that
fill shelves in a narrow storage room of Bearsville Studio.
Scrawled black magic markers identify the master tapes of work by
the Band, Rundgren and dozens of others.
   It's the foreign bands who are usually most interested in
Woodstock's history, Grossman says. She'll often give away books
that describe past events, and once gave an impromptu tour to a
Japanese heavy-metal band that wanted to see the sights.
   ``I think it means something,'' Clearmountain, who attended the
festival, says of the Woodstock mystique. ``Originally, people are
curious about it.''
   But it's the reputation of the studio, not the community, that
ultimately keeps musicians coming back, he says. ``It reinforces
how current we are.''
