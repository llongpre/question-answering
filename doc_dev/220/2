   Arthur and Marion Vassmer ordered a shipment
of Woodstock key chains and cigarette lighters for their general
store in plenty of time for any crowds this year.
   It's what they didn't order 20 years ago this summer that still
causes a few pangs of regret.
   The shelves of their country store were nearly stripped bare
that August 15-17 when about a half million youngsters camped out
nearly two miles away at the Woodstock music festival.
   For one long weekend Vassmer's, open since 1901 on the shores of
White Lake to serve residents of this 6,000-population town,
operated like an exclusive nightclub. Bouncers stood at the front
door and let customers in a few dozen at a time to shop.
   ``If I'd known, I would have had 50 cases of peanut butter up
front and said, `there you go, take all you want,''' said Arthur
Vassmer.
   The Vassmers never made it up to Yasgur's farm during the
Woodstock festival in 1969 when flower children frolicked in the
mud and listened to The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Santana and others. They
were too busy.
   But they could hear the music wafting through the air at all
hours of the day and night. ``I didn't believe it would come off,''
Marion Vassmer said, ``and I still don't believe it was here.''
   The Vassmers remember kids abandoning their cars in town late
Thursday night, sitting on hoods and playing guitars and camping
out in the streets and nearby fields at night.
   Vassmer's, the closest store to the festival site, hadn't even
ordered any extra provisions. All of their canned goods were prized
items, along with the peanut butter. Despite the crowds, Arthur
said he doesn't remember any shoplifters and none of the 25 checks
he cashed bounced.
   ``They didn't bother anybody,'' Marion said. ``They were no
problem. I'm sure a lot of them were on drugs, but they helped each
other out. If one kid didn't have enough money, someone else would
give him some.''
   Arthur Vassmer said he dropped about 12 pounds over three days,
mostly because he couldn't bear to turn on his light and cook
something in his apartment above the store with so many hungry kids
on the street below.
   The couple love reminiscing about the festival with visitors,
but they know enough not to bring up the name ``Woodstock'' to
longtime Bethel residents.
   ``It's not a good topic for conversation because people who were
against it, they still feel the same way they did then,'' said
Marion Vassmer.
   Bethel and the surrounding Catskill Mountain region has let it
be known they're not particularly sentimental for the 20th
anniversary. Bethel refused offers from promoters to be host to an
anniversary concert, even when businessmen dangled enticements such
as paying for a new town sewer system.
   Town officials are expecting several thousand people to show up
at the former Yasgur farm for the anniversary.
   The concert was originally planned for the town of Woodstock,
about 50 miles away, but moved when promoters couldn't get
permission to hold it. At Woodstock today, cynical store owners
sell T-shirts with a map of the area making clear the festival took
place in Bethel, not in the famous arts colony.
   The Vassmers are part of a contingent of Bethel residents who
wish the town could cash in on its place in history by more
actively seeking tourists, but anti-festival opinion has held sway.
   Arthur Vassmer said some people still wander into the general
store and recognize him from the movie ``Woodstock,'' in which he
was interviewed. Some even ask for autographs, which still leaves
him tickled. His store, with the worn wooden floorboards, hasn't
changed much since 1969.
   Times have, though, and that's why he can't see a repeat
performance of Woodstock.
   ``Today you couldn't do it,'' he said. ``It's a different
attitude. These people were the peace people. They came up here for
love and peace and music and that's what they got.''
