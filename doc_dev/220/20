   If you were part of the throng at the Woodstock
music festival 20 years ago this summer, Life magazine wants to
know.
   More specifically, Life wants to know what happened to people
who appeared in photographs in its special issue published a few
weeks after that three-day celebration in August 1969.
   Life's editors spent about $37,000 for a full-page advertisement
that ran in the New York Times earlier this week asking
``Woodstock: Were you there?''
   The ad included a photo from the 1969 issue of a scraggly couple
posing in a clearing among the trees during the festival and a
coupon which readers were asked to complete and mail in if they
were there a generation ago.
   ``What do you remember about those three days of peace and love
and mud? Did the experience change you life? Where are the people
you went to Woodstock with?'' the coupon asks.
   A promotional trick to boost circulation? It won't hurt.
   But Life's managing editor, Patricia Ryan, said she hopes the ad
will attract as many as 20,000 replies that her staff will use in
assembling a special Woodstock anniversary section for the August
issue.
   She said she hopes to run some of the old photos from the 1969
issue next to current ones and include a few stories about what has
happened to those folks since Woodstock.
   ``We were just sitting around looking at pictures and we started
wondering where are they today? Are they bankers, brokers, junk
bond salesmen, farmers?'' she said.
   The Woodstock Music and Arts Festival, which featured
appearances by some of the biggest rock music performers of the
day, ran from Aug. 15-17 on a farm in Bethel, N.Y. The event, which
suffered soaking rainstorms and mud, attracted an estimated half
million people and became a symbol for a generation of how people
can coexist peacefully in trying circumstances.
   Life, a Time Inc. publication, won't be alone in marking the
event.
   Rolling Stone asked its own readers in January to send along
their reminiscences about Woodstock for inclusion in the bimonthly
magazine's issue that goes on sale Aug. 8. Spokesman Stu Zakim said
the magazine got more than 1,000 replies.
   MTV Networks is planning special programming over the next
several months ranging from periodic ``Woodstock Minutes'' to
showing the three-hour Warner Bros. movie ``Woodstock'' on its MTV:
Music Television and VH-1: Video Hits One cable networks.
   Neither Life, with a monthly circulation of 1.8 million, nor
Rolling Stone, with circulation of 1.175 million, increased their
ad rates for the anniversary issues, which the companies expect to
be big sellers.
   Why did Life wait until late May to ask for additional material
for an issue that is expected to be completed in early July?
   ``Sometimes you get good ideas late,'' said Ms. Ryan.
