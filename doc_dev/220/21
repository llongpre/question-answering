   Drug czar William J. Bennett sounded a
distinctly negative note Tuesday about the nostalgia that has welled
up around the 20th anniversary of Woodstock.
   Bennett emerged from a White House meeting on anti-drug strategy
with President Bush to complain about ``memory distortion'' going on
about the rock concert in upstate New York that captivated a
generation in 1969.
   The 45-year-old Bennett, a onetime guitar player and fan of early
rock 'n' roll, recited what he called ``the casualty list from
Woodstock'': rock performers, including singer Janis Joplin, who
died in later years from drug overdoses.
   Bennett, who as a graduate student at the University of Texas in
the late 1960s had a blind date with Joplin, complained about the
torrent of publicity marking the anniversary of the three-day
counterculture festival.
   He said ``part of the legacy of Woodstock was tolerance of drugs
and let us be glad that is over rather than wishing it were back. We
do not want 1969 back in terms of its view of drugs. We've come too
far.''
   People ``have been hearing today and probably will hear ad
nauseam over the next couple of days fond memories and nostalgia
about Woodstock, and there's a lot of memory distortion going on,''
he said.
   ``The next time you hear somebody gushing about Woodstock and
`Why can't it be that way today?' remind them of the casualty list
from Woodstock.
   ``In order of performance:
   ``_Janis Joplin, who died in 1970 of a drug overdose;
   ``_Jimi Hendrix, dead, 1970 drug overdose;
   ``_Keith Moon of the Who, dead of a drug overdose in '78;
   ``_Paul Butterfield Blues Band _ Butterfield died of a drug
overdose in '87.
   ``Woodstock was a time of a great deal of tolerance for drug use
and it was also a time of a great deal of death, because of the
tolerance of drugs,'' said Bennett.
