   Leaders of little Woolstock, Iowa, say
they're not about to allow a concert in the town park on the
anniversary of the Woodstock rock festival because they're worried
about drugs and undesirables.
   But the radio station sponsoring the event said the show will go
on whether the city likes it or not, on private land if need be.
And besides, how many undesirables are going to show up at supper
time on a week night? Even if there are free hot dogs?
   The City Council in the north-central Iowa town of 230 people
voted 4-1 Friday to prohibit radio station KRIT in Fort Dodge,
about 20 miles from Woolstock, from holding a two-hour concert at
the park Tuesday night to observe the 20th anniversary of Woodstock.
   In 1969, a long list of leading rock groups attracted more than
500,000 people to a dairy farm in the Catskills of New York state,
actually about 45 miles from Woodstock.
   KRIT officials said they were inspired to hold the concert
because Woolstock is just a letter away from Woodstock, but despite
that similarity they said the town really doesn't have to fear it
will be overrun.
   Woolstock officials said they didn't want to take a chance.
   ``We're not an anti-social town,'' said Councilman Norval Story,
who voted with the majority. ``We like to have these gatherings.
But we were kind of concerned about the element that might come in.
The drug problem is bad enough as it is.''
   Story and Woolstock Mayor Kenneth Spellmeyer said the event
could have been sponsored at the park if KRIT had given the town a
little time to plan. Instead, they said, town officials learned of
the event in newspaper accounts last week.
   ``I think they're blowing it up a little,'' said KRIT news
director Amy Alberts.
   ``Look, it's from 6 to 8 p.m., no alcohol will be allowed and
it's in a fairly remote area on a Tuesday night, so you're not
going to have that many people,'' she said.
   Instead of Jimi Hendrix or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, the
musical talent is Scott Dohrmann of Barnum and Kevin Lind of Fort
Dodge, both guitarists.
   ``They're the most wholesome guys in the whole world,'' Ms.
Alberts said. ``Sure, there will be music from the '60s and a sound
system, but there won't even be any drums.''
   ``And there can't be all that many people. If anybody has to
work the next day, they certainly aren't going to drive too far.
It's Tuesday night, after all.'' However, there will be the
attraction of free hot dogs and soft drinks, courtesy of KRIT.
   Dorhmann does not have a telephone listing and no one answered
the telephone at Lind's residence.
   As for the failure to notify town officials in advance, Ms.
Alberts said the radio station didn't know it needed to ask for
permission. Besides, she said, the town didn't have to do anything.
   ``It's up to KRIT to do all the planning. It was our event. If a
family were planning a reunion in the Woolstock city park, it's the
family that puts it together,'' she said.
   Ms. Alberts said the radio station is determined to hold the
event regardless of whether it has the blessing of the Woolstock
council.
   ``This is going to happen no matter what,'' she said. ``Before
the council met, an area farmer called us and said he suspected
they would vote it down. He said we could use some of his land.
   ``And we got a call from a person in Woolstock who said he had a
big lot where we could hold it.''
   She said radio officials will visit the proposed sites and make
a decision on where to hold the show by Monday morning.
