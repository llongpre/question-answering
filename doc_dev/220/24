   It was a three-day festival dedicated to
peace, love and music, and there was plenty of long hair and mud as
well.
   But it wasn't Woodstock, not even close. It was the Creation '90
festival, an annual gathering of born-again Christians in the heart
of the Pennsylvania mountains.
   ``We don't mind people calling it a Christian Woodstock, as long
as people understand it's not centered around drugs and rock stars
who are not Godly,'' said the Rev. Harry Thomas, a Beach Boys
look-alike who runs the show with a Bible in his hand.
   Stage right are food booths and record stores and straight out
from the arena is a tent for Christian seminars. To the left is the
Agape Farm baptismal pond.
   ``Music for us has a message in itself, but we want it to lead
somewhere,'' Thomas said Friday, the middle day of the festival.
``First we want it to lead to the word of God, and then to action.''
   One path seldom taken is to the barber shop. Steve Pannier of
The Altar Boys, Southern California's Bad Boys of Gospel, has
spiked hair that would put Billy Idol to shame _ and apparel and
jewelry to match.
   ``We all grew up in a rock 'n' roll atmosphere. We gave our
lives to the Lord and didn't feel like changing our clothes,'' he
said.
   Christian rock began moving toward the mainstream with Larry
Norman in the late 1960s and 70s, and later with Randy Stonehill.
Much of today's Christian sound comes from the rock music classics.
   ``I grew up listening to Jimi Hendrix, The Who, The Beatles and
The Byrds and after I became a Christian I listened to Jimi
Hendrix, The Who, The Beatles and The Byrds,'' said Mike Stand,
another Altar Boy.
   The gospel market today has caught the eye of mainstream record
companies. Several of the 28 groups featured Thursday, Friday and
Saturday have big-label contracts.
   ``We're sold as a pop act to Warner Bros., but there's no doubt
where we're coming from,'' said Dave Mullen, lead singer of One
Blood and a former radiation physicist from Florida.
   Christian music festivals in the late 1970s and 1980s most
resembled Woodstock because the only goal seemed to be fun and
music, Thomas said. He and his co-producer, Tim Landis, want more
from this year's 35,000 campers.
   ``I see a depth in the crowd today that wasn't there in the
Jesus Festival days, when people were turning from drugs to
Jesus,'' Thomas said. ``Our people are being challenged to do
things.''
   For example, some groups are invited in to share stories and
attract support from the festival-goers. One of the biggest is
Compassion International, a Colorado group fighting world hunger.
   ``They've put a special emphasis on our programs ... put
together an all-star band and sold record albums nationally and
internationally to help sponsor children,'' Thomas said.
   Like Woodstock, Creation '90 even had rip-off artists, stealing
from the record and book store adjacent to the concert field.
   ``Not everybody here is born again,'' said Ed Kabakjian,
supervisor of the bookstore.
