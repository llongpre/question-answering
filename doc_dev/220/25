   Plans are being laid for the 20th
anniversary of the Woodstock festival, but community leaders here
are not excited at the prospect of being included in any
commemoration of peace, love and rock 'n' roll.
   The New York festival in August 1969 came to symbolize the 1960s
for a generation of Americans. But for some people here, 50 miles
north of Chicago, Woodstock evokes thoughts of trouble.
   ``This is a small, mid-Victorian town that's trying to stay that
way,'' said Mayor Jim Shoemaker.
   ``We've had a lot of events where there was a good-sized number
of people but they were ones that we planned, ones the town
wanted,'' he said Thursday night.
   ``We don't go too much for these pre-packaged things were they
add water, mix it up and serve it to you.''
   WCKG-FM, a Chicago radio station that plays classic rock, has
hired a company to plan a two-day anniversay festival, one of
several planned around the country.
   The McHenry County Fairgrounds, part of which lies in Woodstock,
population 15,000, is one of eight sites being considered for the
WCKG event, said Tom Drilias, vice president of Festival Events,
Inc.
   Organizers hope to attract 25,000 people to hear singers on
three stages perform folk and rock music of the late 1960s. There
would be arts and crafts displays, carnival rides, food booths and
beer tents.
   The original three-day peace and love fest, held on a farm near
Woodstock in upstate New York, drew some 300,000 people who swayed
to the sounds of Jimi Hendrix, Joan Baez, Sly and the Family Stone,
The Who and others.
   The event was plagued by heavy rain, lack of food and sanitation
facilities, drug overdoses and massive traffic jams.
   ``I think it's the memory of 20 years ago that makes people say
`we don't want that here,''' Shoemaker said.
   Some local merchants, however, would welcome the visitors.
   ``Being a small carry-out, the business would be appreciated,''
said Kathy Dugas, who owns Ma Bill's Snack Spot on the town square.
   To hold such an event, organizers would be required to get
permits from the county.
   ``I don't think they've got too much of a chance,'' Shoemaker
said.
