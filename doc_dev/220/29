   Although much has been made of the Woodstock
generation's aging, the heroes of the festival are for the most
part doing now what they did then.
   In the order they appear on a monument at Yasgur's farm, here's
who are and what became of them:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Richie Havens: Still performing, still an activist. Currently
on a 20th anniversary tour with several other Woodstock veterans.
   _ Arlo Guthrie: The son of legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie
is still performing.
   _ Joan Baez: Her activist work continues unabated. She appeared
at Live Aid. In 1987, she released her memoirs ``And a Voice to
Sing With,'' and a new album, ``Recently.''
   _ Joe Cocker: His career took off after Woodstock. Still
performing; nominated for an Academy Award in 1983 for ``Up Where
We Belong,'' his duet with Jennifer Warnes for the movie, ``An
Officer and a Gentleman.''
   _ Ravi Shankar: The sitar player who introduced George Harrison
to Eastern music is still performing. He is 69.
   _ Janis Joplin: Died on Oct. 4, 1970, of a drug overdose. She
was 27.
   _ Jimi Hendrix: Died on Sept. 18, 1970, of a drug overdose. He
was 27.
   _ Johnny Winter: The original (and only) albino blues guitarist
enjoyed his greatest success after Woodstock; still playing.
   _ Creedence Clearwater Revival: Broke up in October 1972. Lead
singer John Fogerty's latest solo release was 1986's ``Eye of the
Zombie.''
   _ Mountain: Split in 1972. Guitarist Leslie West released a solo
album last year; bassist Felix Pappalardi was shot and killed by
his wife in April 1983.
   _ Santana: The band has flourished for two decades with a
variety of line-ups. A Carlos Santana retrospective, titled ``Viva
Santana!,'' was released last year.
   _ John Sebastian: Also on the 20th anniversary tour. His last
hit was 1976's theme for ``Welcome Back, Kotter;'' his name is
misspelled on the Woodstock memorial plaque as ``Sabastian.''
   _ The Who: Singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend and
bassist John Entwistle are on a 25th anniversary tour, ending a
seven-year layoff. Drummer Keith Moon died of an overdose on Sept.
7, 1978. He was 32.
   _ Canned Heat: Broke up in 1976. Two of its founders died:
guitarist Al ``Blind Owl'' Wilson on Sept. 3, 1970, and vocalist
Bob ``The Bear'' Hite of a drug-related heart attack in April 1981.
   _ The Grateful Dead: Touring again this summer. A new album is
due in September from the band, which has repeatedly called its
Woodstock performance mediocre. Keyboardist Ron ``Pigpen'' McKernan
died of a liver ailment in May 1973. He was 27.
   _ Paul Butterfield Blues Band: The pioneering white blues band
started the blues explosion of the 1960s and broke up in 1972.
Butterfield died on May 5, 1987, of a drug overdose. He was 44.
   _ Sly and the Family Stone: Despite a brilliant Woodstock set,
the group's success was short-lived; by 1973, their heyday was
over. Leader Sylvester Stewart has been plagued by drug problems
and last released an album in 1983.
   _ The Jefferson Airplane: After years of in-fighting, personnel
switches, lawsuits and a divorce, the Airplane reformed this summer
with original members Grace Slick, Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Casady,
Paul Kantner and Marty Balin.
   _ The Band: The only act whose members lived in Woodstock. They
disbanded after ``The Last Waltz'' in 1976. Pianist Richard Manuel
committed suicide on March 4, 1986; its other members are still
performing.
   _ Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young: Reunited last year for
``American Dream,'' their first studio album since 1971's ``Deja
Vu.'' All four continue to perform separately and together. Crosby
detailed his drug addiction last year in a best-selling
autobiography, ``Long Time Gone.''
   _ Blood, Sweat and Tears: Their string of hits ended abruptly in
1971. They have continued to play, with and without vocalist David
Clayton Thomas.
   _ Melanie: Her career slowed down after such early '70s hits as
``Brand New Key.'' Also on the 20th anniversary tour, and has an
album due out this year.
   _ Ten Years After: Guitarist-vocalist Alvin Lee's band
dissembled in May 1975. Reunited this year with new LP, ``About
Time,'' their first in 15 years. During split, Lee has been
performing, while bassist Leo Lyons, keyboardist Chick Churchill
and drummer Rick Lee have stayed in music, producing, engineering
and managing. Last summer a German promoter offered to hire Ten
Years After for four festivals.
   _ Sweetwater: The Los Angeles group released three albums and
broke up in 1971. Lead singer Nancy Nevins de Johgh is now a
short-story writer.
   _ Sha-Na-Na: The '50s revival band has enjoyed continued success
(including a brief network television show) since Woodstock. Their
tour schedule includes shows in Las Vegas.
   _ The Incredible String Band: The Scottish group mixed Indian
music with rock 'n' roll. They split in the mid-'70s, although
co-leader Bruce Williamson still performs in Los Angeles.
   _ Country Joe and the Fish: The stars of the Woodstock movie and
soundtrack album split after the festival. Country Joe McDonald is
on the 20th anniversary tour.
