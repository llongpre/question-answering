   Nearly two decades after the Woodstock rock
festival became a symbol of peace and love for the Baby Boom
generation, the music has been replaced by bickering over whether
there should be an anniversary concert.
   Promoters are squabbling. Neighbor is pitted against neighbor
and bucolic Bethel is still trying to come to grips with its place
in history.
   ``This town doesn't want to forget it,'' said Allan Scott,
Bethel's supervisor. ``The town just doesn't want to get into the
same thing it got into 20 years ago.''
   Max Yasgur's old farm, where 300,000 people converged for three
days in August 1969 to hear musicians like the Who, Jimi Hendrix
and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, isn't a tourist trap, largely
because many people still think it's in Woodstock, 45 miles away.
   The only clue along Route 17B is a small wooden sign advertising
the ``Woodstock Camp Ground'' that points down narrow Hurd Road.
About a mile down the road is a large, sloping field, empty except
for a concrete and steel plaque that identifies its historic past.
   ``Every year more and more people have been assembling at the
site. It's virtually become a shrine,'' said Stephen Davis, lawyer
for the current owners of Yasgur's Farm, Brooklyn auto glass shop
owner Louis Nicky and his wife, June Gelish.
   The Nickys offered the town $200,000 for the right to be host
for another concert in the summer of 1989. Bethel would have to
waive its ordinance forbidding gatherings of more than 10,000
people, passed in 1970.
   No thanks, said the town board.
   ``I walked through it. Besides the drugs, there were sex orgies
all over the place,'' said George Neuhaus, town supervisor during
the original festival. ``I'm 100 percent against (another concert)
and I will do everything I can to prevent it.''
   Other townspeople aren't so harsh.
   ``Of course there was a lot of noisy music and nude people, but
there were a lot of good things too,'' said Marion Vassmer, who
runs a general store that sold supplies to famished concertgoers 19
years ago.
   The small community two hours from New York City, surrounded by
farms and out-of-the-way vacation homes, simply can't handle large
crowds, Scott said.
   The supervisor said he's heard from ``five or six'' promoters
about an anniversary concert. One even offered to pay for a new
sewage and water system for Bethel, but Scott said that after he
asked the promoter to post a letter of credit he never heard from
him again.
   Gelish said the people blocking a concert are simply
old-fashioned.
   ``My husband worked hard all his life, he never had a chance to
be famous,'' Gelish said of 61-year-old Louis Nicky. ``This is his
chance to be famous.''
   Yasgur, who allowed promoters to hold the concert on his farm,
died of a heart attack in 1973 at age 54.
   Joel Rosenman, one of the four promoters of the original
concert, says the Nickys, who bought the property seven years ago,
just want to cash in on a piece of history they had nothing to do
with.
   Rosenman, not coincidentally, wants to promote his own series of
commemorative concerts, but somewhere other than the Catskills.
   Gelish, who vows to continue fighting for a concert, said she
has no other plans for the land. Asked if she could envision a
tourist attraction with the magnitude of Graceland, Elvis Presley's
home, her eyes lit up.
   ``This is really hallowed ground,'' she said.
   Back at the site one afternoon, a man in a tie-dyed T-shirt and
dirty jeans sat cross-legged in the field. A grey-haired man took
video pictures of trees and tall grass swaying in the wind. Mark
Duncan drove up, his North Carolina license plates reading
``WOODSTCK.''
   Duncan, who works at a bank in Charlotte, didn't attend the
original show but drives up each summer because ``it's a nice
feeling around here.''
   Speaking above the blare of 1960s hits from his radio, Duncan
said he's ambivalent about a Woodstock anniversary concert.
   ``If it happens it would be fine,'' he said, ``but I don't think
it would ever be the same.''
