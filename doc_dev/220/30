   Parked amid the tents and trailers littering
the alfalfa field, the site of rock 'n' roll's most memorable
concert 20 years ago Tuesday, was a jeep with the license plate ``TV
Junkie.''
   It was in the right place. Woodstock's 20th anniversary party was
a premier media event, with dozens of reporters elbowing each other
to find out if the peace and love generation had lost its way in the
1980s.
   A forest of satellite dishes surrounded a plaque that
commemorated the epochal three-day concert that attracted some
400,000 spectators. Woodstock veterans and wistful ``wannabes''
barely had the chance to formulate their reminiscences before being
asked to share them with the world.
   ``You want my favorite quote?'' Debbie Armstrong, of Montgomery,
N.Y., called out as a reporter wandered by a tent thick with tattoos
and tie-dyed shirts. ``We feel like we're at the Orange County Fair
_ only we're the attraction.''
   Much to some people's disappointment, there was no organized
celebration of Woodstock's 20th anniversary at the late Max Yasgur's
one-time farm. Rather, it was a free-form party, as tourists mingled
with campers staking their turf under the watchful eyes of dozens of
cameras.
   Armstrong and her friends said they'd been interviewed about a
dozen times. Their favorite came Monday night, when they crowded
around a campfire and shouted ``Goodnight from Woodstock'' on cue to
a cameraman from Scranton, Pa.
   ``This has turned into such a media event,'' she said. ``Back
then, they (reporters) weren't even into the heart of it. It took 20
years for the spirit to sink in.''
   But the attention has its downside, she said.
   ``A lot of people are drawn toward the cameras,'' she said. ``A
lot of people are behaving because the press is looking.''
   That didn't stop one man with a cast on his foot from holding up
a marijuana cigarette. When questioned by a reporter, his companion
said she was from Venus.
   Twenty-year-old Denise Frangipane of Bethel said she'd been
camping at the site for the last four days, ``because we weren't
there last time. I'm getting tired of saying that.'' She said she
made the same statement the day before to a German television crew,
or was it a French team?
   A makeshift stage crammed with speakers stood at the bottom of
the natural amphitheater where Richie Havens launched the original
Woodstock with a three-hour show.
   ``Anybody who has anything just gets up and plays,'' Frangipane
said. Despite hopeful rumors spreading through the crowd that the
Grateful Dead would make a return engagement, the stage was empty
Tuesday afternoon.
   Makeshift hot dog, souvenir and T-shirt stands lined the country
road leading to the field, where several hundred people were
gathered Tuesday.
   A representative of the field's current owners, June Gelish and
Louis Nicky of New York City, collected $5 from each carload for
``field restoration.''
   Ron Anderson, 42, put a guitar in the back of his car and drove
up from Coventry, Conn., for the day. He'd already been interviewed
by reporters from enough channel numbers to make up a lottery card.
   He wasn't at the original concert, but said he was glad to
experience it this way.
   ``I didn't really know what to expect. I found it to be quite
interesting. We've met some pretty nice people,'' he said.
