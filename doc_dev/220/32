   Soviet fans jumped, danced and wrapped themselves
in giant American flags Saturday as some of heavy metal's biggest
stars made their Soviet debut in Moscow's biggest-ever hard rock
concert.
   The benefit concert, a two-day extravaganza billed as the
``Moscow Music Peace Festival'' and likened to the Woodstock
festival of 20 years ago, features Western musicians Motley Crue,
Bon Jovi, Scorpions, Cinderella, Ozzy Osbourne, and Skid Row as
well as the Soviet groups Nuance, Gorky Park and Brigada S.
   Proceeds will go to programs that fight drug and alcohol abuse
in the United States and the Soviet Union.
   About 100,000 fans filled the Lenin Stadium in central Moscow
Saturday, many of them reclining on mats or jumping and screaming
near the stage, painted in the psychedelic style of the 1960s.
   Some fans wrapped themselves in giant American flags and formed
human pyramids.
   ``We're athletes, we need some psychological relaxation!'' a
member of the Soviet junior fencing team shouted after the pyramid
he was forming with teammates toppled.
   The concert's Soviet organizer, impressario Stas Namin, told a
news conference Friday the concert would be as important to his
generation as Woodstock was to American youth in 1969.
   ``We will show that rock is not just negative,'' he said.
``After so many years of stigmatization, this is something
positive,''
   At $16 a ticket, the concert was exorbitantly priced by Soviet
standards. However, organizers said it quickly sold out.
   ``This is the first time we've ever had such a concert,'' said
23-year-old Yelena Viklova, who came with her husband. ``There was
no way we could pass up the chance. We came to see the foreign
groups.''
   Rock promoter Alexei Kisilev said the concert represented a
major step forward from two years ago, when Soviet authorities
banned a proposed anti-drug concert because ``they said we didn't
have a drug problem, and our rock was not developed enough.''
   Soviet authorities no longer emphatically condemn rock music as
a decadent Western force, but officials still occasionally express
disapproval of rock culture.
   Few hard rock albums are put out in the Soviet Union, and groups
have generally had a hard time making arrangements for concert
halls and tours. They have, however, gained ground under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's cultural thaw.
   Any parallel with Woodstock, the outdoor festival at a farm in
New York state that became a symbol of the 1960's, escaped many of
Saturday's fans. One 18-year-old Muscovite asked whether Woodstock
had been held in Moscow.
   Kisilev said the weekend's concert could change the Soviet rock
scene and serve as a precedent for more such events.
   One fan at the concert was U.S. ambassador Jack Matlock, who
gave an impromptu press conference wearing one of the ``Just Say
Nyet'' buttons promoters had distributed. The buttons mirrored the
U.S. anti-drug slogan ``Just Say `No.'''
   ``These contacts show we have common goals and common
problems,'' Matlock said as he posed for photos with long-haired
rockers Eric Brittingham and Fred Courey of Cinderella.
   The concert will spawn an album dedicated to rock stars who died
of overdoses. American viewers will be able to see four hours of
performances on cable television Sunday, organizers said.
