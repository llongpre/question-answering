   Twenty-two years after they began, 14 years
after they broke off and 20 years after they played at Woodstock,
Ten Years After is back together.
   A Chrysalis album, ``About Time,'' will be released in August,
15 years after their last one, and a seven-week fall U.S. tour is
planned. The quartet, one of the major bands to emerge from the
1960s blues revival in England, known for its fast and furious
blend of blues and medium-heavy rock, has not mellowed out.
   Guitarist-vocalist Alvin Lee has been performing, while bassist
Leo Lyons, keyboardist Chick Churchill and drummer Rick Lee have
stayed in music, producing, engineering and managing.
   In an interview with Alvin Lee and Lyons, Lee said that the band
didn't so much split up as wind down. ``We'd had some degree of
success and we'd all got nice houses and families. There was a bit
of pressure to stay at home.''
   He said that before Ten Years After split, ``Critics said I was
a fast, tasteless guitar player. That was bothering me a bit. I
shouldn't have let it, now I realize.''
   So he put together the seven-piece In Flight. ``Critics said it
was wonderful and I was playing better than ever. I missed the roar
of the crowd and the loudness after a while. That band wasn't
capable of playing heavy rock. I went back to playing from my blues
and rock roots.'' He formed Ten Years Later for a year, then Alvin
Lee and Company, which played some Ten Years After favorites.
   ``When we played together last summer, suddenly it sounded like
Ten Years After, right from the first note. It was obvious Ten
Years After had its own sound,'' Lee said.
   Reception at the festivals was so enthusiastic, Lyons said, that
the four decided to stay together. Lee and Lyons, each working with
other people, wrote 40 songs. The band recorded 15. Unable to
decide on 10, they put 11 on ``About Time.''
   In July, Ten Years After played before 80,000 in East Berlin.
   Asked about Woodstock, which took place 20 years ago on a farm
in Bethel, N.Y., on Aug. 15, 16 and 17, Lyons says, ``It's all a
bit hazy now, to be honest.''
   Still, memories come back.
   ``We were set to go on and a thunderstorm appeared,'' Lee said.
``Nobody could play for two or three hours. Sparks were flying on
the stage. I thought it outdid the music by far. God's light show.
   ``In a way it was fortunate. I went for a walk around the lake
and joined in with the audience. Nobody knew I was one of the
musicians. Half a million people can't all run under trees. They
sat there and started singing. People were playing on mud slides.
It was a wonderful thing to see that happening. Everybody was
making the best out of the ridiculous sitation. I think it brought
the best out of everybody.
   ``People were offering food and drink. It was very idealistic,
very nice. I think had it not been for the storm, probably I would
never have seen much.
   ``One of the reasons I went out was because in the backstage
area there wasn't a single cigarette. I came back with 10 marajuana
cigarettes, no regular cigarettes.''
   Lyons said, ``They said the food backstage was spiked with acid.
Whether it was true or not, it dims the appetite. The drinks were
supposed to be dodgy. In those days you never used to drink from an
open can anyhow.''
   Neither can remember what Ten Years After played, except for
``I'm Going Home,'' the high-energy rocker used in the
``Woodstock'' movie and, they think, the jazzy ``I Can't Keep From
Crying Sometimes'' and ``Love Like a Man.''
   ``I remember we did `Good Morning, Little Schoolgirl,''' Lyons
said, ``because the tuning went out because of atmospheric
conditions. We had to stop the song, apologize and retune. We did
`Going Home' as an encore.''
   ``We were the first on after the storm,'' Lee recalled.
``Everybody was worried. Sparks were still flying off the stage and
it was very wet. Somebody had to do it. Think how many of our
records would have sold if we'd been electrocuted.''
   ``It was definitely the movie that made Woodstock the memorable
thing it was,'' Lee said. ``Toronto was probably as good a festival
as Woodstock. It got forgotten.
   ``We carried on in 3,000 to 5,000-seat halls. A year later the
movie came out and we're into 20,000 seaters.''
   The night before their Woodstock appearance, Ten Years After was
in St. Louis at a jazz festival before a primarily black audience.
   ``Nina Simone went on,'' Lyons said. ``Four white hippies went
on afterwards. When we walked on stage, an uproar was starting. It
was frightening. But we played a bit of jazz and blues and we were
OK then.''
   Lee sais that in one way Woodstock was a statement against
racial prejudice. ``It was even more about the peace movement and
the Vietnam War. We thought the peace movement was very real and a
good thing to be doing. Woodstock tended to make it into a
fashionable thing. The fashion grew old and it was no longer cool
to be a hippie.''
   Lyons added, ``Woodstock was anti-establishment, a peace and
love thing, anti-violence. It was for tolerance, let people do what
they want, help one another. I think it had a lot of long-term
benefits.''
   But they didn't know what Woodstock symbolized before they got
there. Lee said, ``It was just another line on the sheet.''
   They flew from St. Louis to New York and drove until they came
to blocked roads.
   ``They took us in an Army helicopter,'' Lee said. ``I was
hanging out on a safety strap over all the audience. It was a
mind-blowing experience.''
