   ``People seem to have a high sense of drama about me. Maybe they
can enjoy my music more if they think I'm destroying myself.'' _

   Hair bristling about her shoulders in an untidy
nest, the blowsy high priestess of the blues stumbled to the stage,
spitting and cursing. With two whiskey bottles in each hand, Janis
Joplin faced Woodstock Nation like a drunken gunslinger.
   Even through her fog, she knew she didn't like this gig. No way,
no how. Too many people. Hippies, she managed to slur to the
audience at the Woodstock festival on Aug. 16, 1969, had become a
``whole new minority.''
   Many of the performances at Woodstock were disappointing or
strange or just plain bad, but Joplin's was all three.
   ``She was tortured and crying in the microphone,'' recalls Henry
Diltz, the official Woodstock photographer, in ``Woodtock: The Oral
History,'' a recently published book by Joel Makower.
   ``I don't know really how to describe her. I mean, she really
screamed in agony in those songs. She really meant it. You could
see that in the way she contorted her face and her body and
everything.''
   John Morris, production coordinator for the concert, summed up:
``It was an awful performance.''
   Joplin had been partying strong since her arrival in the Bethel
area. She hung out with Country Joe McDonald at the Holiday Inn
dining room, and they turned it into a bar. She and Country Joe had
once been lovers, and he wrote and performed ``Janis,'' a song
about their romance.
   ``When she walked offstage ... she went into a tent and, I am
sure, shot up instantly,'' recalls Myra Friedman, Joplin's
biographer, in ``Woodstock.''
   ``So it was sad. And her behavior that weekend was indicative of
her depression and addiction and booze. The other thing was that
Janis was not real thrilled by the size of that crowd at all.
   ``She said, `I can't relate to a quarter of a million people.' ''
   Joplin had been in the business barely three years, and when she
hit Woodstock, she was somebody. A personality. A happening. A
rock-blues star who raked in $30,000 for every concert appearance.
And also by Woodstock, she'd had three years of boozing, drugging
and burning out.

   ``When I get scared and worried, I tell myself, `Janis, just
have a good time.' So I juice up real good and that's what I have.''

   A homely soul from Port Arthur, Texas, Joplin took her talent
and guts on the road and hitchhiked with her three-octave voice to
San Francisco just in time for the flowering of Haight-Ashbury.
   She strutted through clubs in North Beach, and on June 11, 1966,
the 23-year-old whiskey-soaked mama from the little Texas town
joined Big Brother and The Holding Company, the house band at San
Francisco's Avalon Ballroom, on stage.
   ``I couldn't believe it _ all that rhythm and power,'' Joplin
later recalled. ``I got stoned just feeling it, like it was the
best dope in the world. It was so sensual, so vibrant, loud, crazy.
   ``I couldn't stay still. I had never danced when I sang, but
there I was moving and jumping. I couldn't hear myself, so I sang
louder and louder. By the end, I was wild.''
   The Avalon is gone now. So is Joplin. She was found at the
Landmark Hotel in Los Angeles four years after her debut with Big
Brother, fresh needle marks in her arm. The coroner's report called
it an accidental overdose of heroin.
   From that day in June until her death Oct. 4, 1970, Joplin
grabbed a generation and held it in her thrall with her raspy,
plaintive voice, her coarse vulnerablitity and her tough
independence.
   A self-avowed beatnik _ not, she would caution, a hippie _ she
became an icon for the Woodstock generation. Hippies, she said,
believed the world could be a better place. ``Beatniks believe
things aren't going to get better ... and say to hell with it, stay
stoned and have a good time.''
   Fame came fast for Joplin. It happened the moment she screamed
her way through Josh White's ``Ball and Chain Blues'' at the
Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967.
   Joplin loved the blues, and her personal hero was Bessie Smith.
On Aug. 8, 1970, she bought a headstone for Smith's grave at the
Mount Lawn cemetery in Philadelphia. The great blues singer died in
1937 after being refused admission to a whites-only hospital.
   ``Black people have the blues because they can't have this and
they can't have that,'' Joplin once said. ``Me, I was brought up in
a middle-class family; I could have had anything. But you need
something more in your gut, man.''
   She covered many artists' songs, including Barry and Robin
Gibb's ``To Love Somebody,'' and Rodgers and Hart's ``Little Girl
Blue.'' But she also wrote songs, including ``Mercedes-Benz,'' and
with organist Gabriel Mekler, ``Kozmic Blues.''

   ``Time keeps moving on
   ``Friends, they keep moving on or turn away
   ``But I never find out why ...
   ``I keep trying to make it right to another day.''

   Joplin released the ``Cheap Thrills'' LP in 1968 with Big
Brother. She left the band later that year because they just
``weren't growing together anymore.''
   Then The Kozmic Blues Band was formed in 1969, and disbanded
shortly after their one LP, ``I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again
Mama!'' shot to the top of the charts.
   Joplin appeared with Big Brother at Fillmore West and Winterland
in 1969 before putting together her new group, the Full-Tilt Boogie
Band.
   At the time of her death, she was working on a new LP. ``Pearl''
was drawn from unfinished sessions and released in February 1971.
It had the plaintive ``Cry Baby'' and Kris Kristofferson's ``Bobby
McGee'' with its telling refrain: ``Freedom's just another word for
nothin' left to lose.''
   Freedom was hard for Joplin to define. She had fame, she had
talent, she had a lot of time and independence. But she was lonely.
   ``Somehow you lose all the old friends,'' she said. ``The travel
circumstances pull them away. It's hard to make new ones. When
we're not onstage, we rehearse, lay around in bed, check in and out
of motels, watch television. It really is lonely.
   ``I live for that one hour on stage. It's full of feeling. It's
more exciting than you'd expect in a lifetime. It's a rush, honey.''
