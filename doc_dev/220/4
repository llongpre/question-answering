   Woodstock, the rock festival that came to
symbolize the 1960s for a generation of Americans, is again at the
center of a controversy, this time over how big its 20th
anniversary celebration should be.
   On one side is the Bethel Town Board, which meets tonight to
discuss whether to allow voters decide what to do about next
August's anniversary. If a referendum is agreed upon, it would be
placed on November's ballot, Town Supervisor Alan Scott said
Tuesday.
   On the other side are concert promoters who want to re-create
the original Woodstock, which wasn't actually held in that Ulster
County town but miles away on Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel, Sullivan
County.
   Scott said his town is against any rock extravaganza on the
scale of the first Woodstock, which drew nearly a half million
people and endured heavy rains, lack of food and sanitation
facilities, drug overdoses and massive traffic jams.
   Scott said the town wants to recognize the anniversary, but in a
low-key manner. The problems created during the 1969 festival are
still fresh in the minds of residents, he said.
   ``It really raised havoc in this area,'' Scott said. ``It was a
thorn in the side of many, many residents at the time.''
   He said that as a result of the three-day concert held Aug.
15-17, 1969, the town passed a mass assembly law that prohibits
gatherings of more than 10,000 people.
   In August 1986, town officials did erect a roadside marker at
the site of the concert.
   Scott said at least five promoters have approached the town
board this year about staging another Woodstock festival.
   Some have talked about bringing back such Woodstock performers
as Country Joe Fish and Richie Havens, Scott said.
   Other performers, such as Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, and Santana,
still draw large concert crowds today.
   ``The general feeling is that we certainly don't want any
massive gathering anywhere near the proportion of what we had,''
Scott said.
   Scott said the board already has rejected a promoter's offer of
$200,000 to allow the concert to be staged.
   ``We recognize the importance of the event, we realize the
historical significance, but we are looking for something tasteful,
not more than a one-day event and not more than 10,000 people,'' he
said.
   In August 1984, the 15th anniversary of Woodstock was celebrated
at the posh Grossinger's Resort and Country Club in Grossinger,
N.Y., about 5 miles from Yasgur's farm.
   About 700 people showed up, including Abbie Hoffman and
Woodstock performers John Sebastian and David Clayton Thomas.
