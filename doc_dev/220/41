<P>
The massive official name of the Saturday-Sunday rock spectacular at 
75,000-capacity Lenin Stadium here is the Moscow Music Peace Festival. 
</P>
<P>
But several of the organizers and musicians have another name for the most 
ambitious Western rock event ever staged in a country where the American-bred 
music was once denounced as bourgeois decadence. 
</P>
<P>
Their name: the Russian Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Belov, lead guitarist for the Soviet rock band Gorky Park, likes the ring 
of the term. But Belov, whose band will be on the bill with such Western acts 
as Bon Jovi, Ozzy Osbourne and Motley Crue, believes that the connection with 
Woodstock is more than simply a convenient media term on a weekend that happens 
to be the 20th anniversary of that landmark U.S. rock event. 
</P>
<P>
Belov says the Moscow concerts may come to represent the same revolutionary 
turning point in this country's rock development as those three days and nights 
on Max Yasgur's farm had on rock in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
Despite occasional appearances here over the last 10 years by such mainstream 
pop-rock figures as Elton John and Billy Joel, Soviet officials have been 
reluctant to open the door to Western acts, especially the rebellious, 
high-energy "bad boys" who compose much of this weekend's lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Belov, 31, said the government has also discouraged the development of Soviet 
bands by "forbidding" any group that was deemed unacceptable for any of a 
number of reasons, including themes. 
</P>
<P>
But all that has changed greatly in the age of glasnost, the guitarist said 
Thursday as his band walked in a light drizzle from the Ukrainia Hotel to the 
van for the ride to the stadium for an afternoon sound check. Not only are 
there signs of greater flexibility in allowing foreign bands to play here, but 
Soviet bands are also being given increasing freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Grebenshikov, a veteran singer-songwriter who has been called the Bob 
Dylan of the Soviet Union, has recently made an album produced by British 
rocker Dave Stewart for Columbia Records and is now on a U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
Belov's Gorky Park, a harder-rocking group whose sound has been likened to that 
of '60s power trio Cream, is something of a Soviet supergroup, formed two years 
ago by the leading musicians from several competing bands. 
</P>
<P>
The group has spent much of the last six months in the United States and Canada 
recording an album due soon from PolyGram Records. Belov said that most Soviet 
bands are "too inexperienced" to mount a serious challenge against Western 
groups, but feels the loosening of restrictions will change that. Seeing 
Western bands this weekend should inspire more young Soviets to start dreaming 
their own rock dreams -- a difficult, nearly impossible dream for many until 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, our music scene is just beginning because it was held back for 
so long," said Belov, who was once in a band that was declared "forbidden." But 
he added proudly: "There has been a new government attitude the last three 
years and this concert should give our bands confidence and inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
Doc McGhee, who manages several of the bands on the weekend bill including Bon 
Jovi and Motley Crue, also likes the "Russian Woodstock" image, but for 
different reasons. McGhee, 38, hopes that the shows' anti-drug message will 
erase much of the Woodstock legacy of permissive drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"The musical aspect of Woodstock was very important, but there were some sad 
consequences of the social aspects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The message many people came away from Woodstock with was that drugs were OK, 
even a necessary part of the rock 'n' roll experience. A lot of lives have been 
lost because of that over the last 20 years, and we are trying in these 
concerts to say that drugs don't have to be part of rock. You can still have 
fun and you can still be rebellious without drugs -- and the bonus is you will 
have a better chance of living." 
</P>
<P>
McGhee said the concerts are designed to raise money for and promote the goals 
of the Make a Difference Foundation, which he started last year with a $250,000 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to raise between $6 million and $10 million from the festival and 
such related events as a pay-per-view telecast in the United States (5 to 9 
p.m. Sunday in Southern California), a syndicated radio broadcast (on KQLZ-FM 
(100.3) in Los Angeles) and an album. Rather than simply featuring songs from 
the festival, the album will feature new studio versions of songs by artists 
who were drug casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the shows were $15 to $22 -- high by local concert standards, some 
teen-age rock fans said Thursday. But, they quickly added, "there has never 
been anything like this," so it is difficult to compare. At any rate, the shows 
are sold out and dozens of fans hung around the hotel most of the day, taking 
photos of the musicians and getting autographs. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee, who has offices in Los Angeles and New York, started the Make a 
Difference Foundation last year as part of a community service provision on 
probation given him after he pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to "aiding 
and abetting" in the distribution of an estimated 40,000 pounds of marijuana in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
The manager said he has experimented with drugs but had sworn off them long 
before last year's court action and was involved in anti-drug campaigns before 
the community service order. 
</P>
<P>
Several musicians on the bill, including Jon Bon Jovi, Osbourne and Vince Neil 
of Motley Crue, have also acknowledged drug or alcohol use, but now say that it 
is in their past and warn young people about its dangers. 
</P>
<P>
The bands landed here late Wednesday after a flight on the "Magic Bus," a 
chartered 757 that left Newark, N.J., and stopped near London to pick up 
additional passengers. In keeping with the concerts' theme, no alcohol was 
served on the plane and there was no apparent drug use. 
</P>
<P>
The latter observation was confirmed -- perhaps unexpectedly -- when uniformed 
officials brought a dog on board during the 45-minute stopover in Britain. Most 
of the estimated 175 passengers were off the plane while the dog roamed the 
aisles, stopping here and there to sniff the area. 
</P>
<P>
But some members of the tour party saw the dog enter the plane and, even with 
the drug-free policy, at least one member of the group became momentarily 
anxious. 
</P>
<P>
"My first thought was, 'Oh my God, are they going to find anything?,' " the 
tour member said. "Then I realized I had flashed on the old days when a dog on 
a plane could have been a disaster. I guess times really do change." 
</P>
<P>
After a press conference at the airport in Moscow, the musicians were taken on 
a brief tour of the city, stopping only for a glimpse of giant Lenin Stadium, 
scene of many of the activities in the 1980 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
The band members -- many in their unmistakable hard-rock attire -- caused a 
flurry of interest among tourists when buses stopped to let them view the 
stadium from a scenic point near the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Various American and European tourists who had been shooting pictures of the 
landscape suddenly turned and began snapping photos of the visiting musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Because many of these bands don't have as much of a profile with the non-rock 
audience as mass-media stars like Mick Jagger or David Bowie, the tourists 
scrambled about asking members of the tour party just whom they were taking 
pictures of. 
</P>
<P>
Informed that the tall fellow with the row of tattoos was a member of Motley 
Crue, a woman from Indiana all but gasped. "I made my son throw away some of 
their posters. I couldn't stand looking at them in his room. What are they 
doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
Most surprised, however, were the local residents who happened to be in the 
area. Though punk touches -- rainbow-colored hair, an occasional Mohawk, 
leather jackets with skull and crossbones, biker boots -- can sometimes be seen 
here, seeing all these bands together was something of a culture shock. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are these people?" one local woman asked in halting English. She didn't 
show any signs of recognition of the visiting bands, but a mention of Gorky 
Park did cause a reaction. It wasn't that she had heard of the Soviet band. She 
thought the American visitor was asking how to get to the real Gorky Park, a 
combination recreation area and theater zone similar to Griffith Park in Los 
Angeles. After a brief huddle in Russian with her husband, she started pointing 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
Before getting back on the bus for the ride to the hotel, a member of the New 
Jersey-based band Skid Row band showed that even on a drug-free journey there 
is room for some old-fashioned rock tomfoolery. As he neared the bus, singer 
Sebastian Bach lowered his pants and mooned the crowd of onlookers, including a 
pair of Moscow policemen sitting in a parked squad car. 
</P>
<P>
One woman put one hand over her eyes and pulled her young daughter away. The 
Moscow police? They just seemed to shake their heads in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
How did this rambunctious bunch ever get into the Soviet Union? Driving force 
McGhee said that his stress on the anti-drug message was a key, because drug 
and alcohol abuse is a growing problem in the Soviet Union. The word peace in 
the title also made it more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it wasn't easy. McGhee made nine trips to the Soviet Union to set it up 
and had to deal with several government agencies. He was aided by Soviet 
musician Stas Namin, whose grandfather was formerly a high Communist Party 
official. McGhee also introduced the Soviet officials to Jon Bon Jovi, the most 
diplomatic and acceptable-looking member of the rock roster. McGhee didn't 
detail the background of all the other acts, especially Ozzy Osbourne, who 
seems to attract controversy -- he has been accused of everything from 
advocating satanism to inspiring suicide to intentionally biting the head off a 
dead bat (he did do the last, but it was an accident). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Western concert organizers speculated that the concerts may be 
another gamble by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in his continuing effort 
to sustain the glasnost spirit and renew the spirits of disaffected youth. They 
believe that Soviet officials will be watching the shows closely to see what 
happens when they ease up after repressing rock for so long. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't help but think what happens here this weekend is going to be pretty 
historic," Jon Bon Jovi said seriously. Then, referring to the weekend's 
biggest example of culture shock, he quipped, "I imagine Mr. Bush and Mr. 
Gorbachev are both going to be aware of who Ozzy Osbourne is."
