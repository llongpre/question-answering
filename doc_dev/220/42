   Twenty years after a pop festival took
over this Dallas suburb, a beer company is sponsoring a rock fest
that shows the Woodstock era is long past.
   Organizers put together the 1969 Texas International Pop Festival
in Lewisville in seven weeks with a shoestring budget, but Miller
Brewing Co. has pushed this weekend's concert series for more than a
year with television ads and other promotions.
   At the shows, the psychedelic drugs of yesteryear will give way
to drinking arrangements for designated drivers.
   ``The whole tone of the two shows 20 years apart is remarkably
different,'' Angus Wynne, who promoted the Lewisville festival, said
Tuesday.
   Just three weeks after the Woodstock rock festival in New York
state, about 120,000 people spent three days on a field outside
Lewisville to hear the Chicago Transit Authority, Janis Joplin,
Santana, Sly and the Family Stone, B.B. King, Grand Funk Railway,
Led Zeppelin and others.
   This weekend, Miller hopes to draw 500,000 people to concerts in
six Texas cities, including performances by the Who in Houston and
Dallas. The concerts culminate a 16-month campaign by the company.
   In addition to the Who, performances by Jerry Jeff Walker, Kool
and the Gang, Natalie Cole and many others are planned in Dallas,
Houston, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen and Midland-Odessa.
   It took Wynne seven weeks and $120,000 to line up all 30 acts.
Promoters of the Lewisville festival said they lost $100,000.
   Miller hasn't disclosed its budget, but the Who grossed $1.04
million at a concert before 47,000 fans in St. Louis three weeks
ago. Miller has pledged to give at least $1 million in proceeds to
the Texas Special Olympics.
   The company and promoters have made elaborate security
arrangements. People will need wristbands to gain access to the
concerts. Designated drivers will receive different colored bands
entitling them to free soft drinks and baring them from buying beer.
   Twenty years ago, drugs were common, but the crowd behaved. There
were only 36 arrests, most for public intoxication.
   ``Psychedelics and pot, I believe, were the prevalent stimulants
of choice,'' said Sam Houston, a Denton judge who was mayor of
Lewisville from 1969 to 1973.
   When it was over, residents were surprised by the long-haired,
easygoing rock fans. Some concertgoers mowed lawns and babysat for
residents during their stay.
   ``That was part of the mind-blow thing that went on here,'' Wynne
said. ``People expected all these folks to be real nasty, and here
they were handing them flowers, just as polite as they could be. It
disarmed them totally.''
