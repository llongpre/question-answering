   The Protestant cry of ``no
surrender'' had echoes on the Roman Catholic side as Northern
Ireland today marked 20 years of living with British troops.
   ``We have a lot to be proud of because we have come a long way
in 20 years. Our opponents have failed to defeat us,'' Gerry Adams
told thousands of cheering supporters who marched up the Falls Road
in West Belfast on Sunday.
   Adams is president of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army, and he praised the IRA as ``the
real freedom fighters.''
   The republican parade came a day after a big Protestant parade
in Londonderry to mark the 300th anniversary of the breaking of the
Catholic King James II's siege of the city.

   Four congressmen plan to accompany Rep. Mickey
Leland's body back to the United States after it is retrieved from
the wreckage of a plane crash in Ethiopia, while President Bush
says he is ``truly saddened'' by ``this tragic accident.''
   The president said Sunday the Texas Democrat and his 15
companions were ``engaged in a noble cause _ trying to feed the
hungry'' when their plane crashed after taking off from Addis Ababa
for a refugee camp near the Sudan border.
   After learning that the plane was found Sunday on a remote
Ethiopian mountain 100 miles from its destination, Bush asked two
White House officials to accompany a congressional team that will
bring the bodies of Leland and eight other Americans back to the
United States.
   An administration official said a decision on when the
delegation would leave Washington would hinge on the identification
of the bodies.

   More than 190,000 telephone employees were on strike nationwide
today after workers in five Midwestern states joined the walkout.
But two regional telephone companies reached settlements to keep
83,000 workers on the job.
   About 35,000 members of the Communications Workers of America
went on strike Sunday against Chicago-based Ameritech, which serves
12.3 million customers in the Midwest.
   They joined more than 156,000 operators, installers and other
employees at three other ``Baby Bells'' _ NYNEX, Bell Atlantic, and
Pacific Telesis _ who entered the second week of their walkout
today.
   There were few signs of progress in resolving any of the
disputes, which center on wages and company plans to cut back
health benefits.
   Nevertheless, the CWA reached agreement Sunday with U S West,
which serves 14 western states, and with Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co., which has 11 million customers in Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas.

   Echoes of the Woodstock festival reverberate in
American society 20 years after the counterculture concert rocked
the nation. But when it comes to rock 'n' roll itself, most people
say the tune's gone flat.
   Eight in 10 American adults have heard of the Woodstock
festival, held Aug. 15-17, 1969, on a muddy farm in upstate New
York _ and three in 10 of them wish they had attended, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   That high level of awareness was rooted in a view of Woodstock
as more of a historical milestone than simply a show. Most regard
it as the expression of a social movement, and half of them said
that movement continues today.
   Yet the view of Woodstock was not an idealized one. While nearly
six in 10 of those who knew of the festival said it has had a
lasting effect on American society, only half of them said the
effect was a positive one.

   A total lunar eclipse will occur after sunset
in five continents on Wednesday when the full moon orbits into the
shadow of the Earth and slowly turns from a bright silver into a
copper or orange disk.
   More than a billion people in the western hemisphere will have a
chance to watch as the moon appears to be slowly nibbled away,
changing from the normal bright reflected light of a full moon into
the colorful glow of eclipse.
   The celestial show starts at 8:23 p.m. EDT over the United
States and will end about 5{ hours later. The eastern United States
will get the best viewing and Alaska will miss the eclipse
altogether.
   Visible eclipse phases will vary for the central and western
parts of the country because of the difference in sunset and
moonrise. In Los Angeles, for instance, the eclipse will have
started before the sun has set or the moon has risen. By the time
the sky has darkened completely in California, the moon will
already be in the deepest part of its eclipse. For Seattle, the
moon will still be below the horizon at mid-eclipse, but will rise
during the totality phase.

   Postal workers who tested positive for drug
use were more prone to absenteeism and getting fired, according to
a new study that could give private employers an indication of the
cost of workers' drug use.
   The analysis, one of the first studies of its kind, found that
drug users had a 41 percent higher absence rate and about a 40
percent higher rate of being fired, said researcher Jacques Normand.
   Results suggest that by spending about $1.8 million a year to
screen job applicants for drugs, the post office could avoid about
$3.1 million in costs related to absenteeism and firing in the
first year, he said. Over three years, the avoided costs would
surpass $17 million, he said.
   For private employers, the study provides hard data showing that
drug screening results are related to later job performance, he
said.
