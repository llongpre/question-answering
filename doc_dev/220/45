   A concert broadcast ``live'' from a tiny town
called Livestock, featuring dead rocker Jimi Hendrix and a Beatles
reunion, turned out to be a mirage.
   As many as two dozen people called state police in Hagerstown on
Saturday night and Sunday, asking about the concert in the
non-existent town, said Sgt. Kenneth Frick. Others called state
police in Cumberland.
   Baltimore radio station WGRX-FM was promoting appearances by Led
Zeppelin and the Eagles at an outdoor concert billed as attracting
huge crowds like those that appeared near Bethel, N.Y., for the
Woodstock songfest in 1969.
   And despite disclaimers and radio accounts of lines a mile long
for portable toilets and people sleeping in trees, fans wanted to
be there.
   When Tony Colter came on the air Sunday afternoon, he asked
listeners to stop calling police and said, ``Stay home. The concert
is sold out. We'll bring it to you live on WGRX.''
   And then he promised: ``Coming up at 7 o'clock, live on stage
Jimi Hendrix.''
   The concert was ``just a way of having fun over Memorial Day
weekend,'' said WGRX general manager Bill Hopkinson. ``Every famous
group in the world was there. It was a nice escape for our
listeners.''
   ``Obviously, Jimi Hendrix has been dead for a long, long time,''
Colter said. ``It's supposed to be a fantasy fun weekend.''
