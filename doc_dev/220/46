   Woodstock alumni John Sebastian, Bert
Sommer and Melanie will join Papa John Creech, former Byrds
guitarist Roger McGuinn and at least 10 other bands for a
``Remember Woodstock'' concert next week.
   The concert, billed as another three days of peace, love and
music in celebration of the Woodstock concert held 20 years ago, is
scheduled Aug. 17-19 in this Catskills Mountains resort town, said
promoter Elliott Schneider.
   Other acts scheduled are The Woodstock All-Star Band, Willie
Nininger and Family, Futu Futu, David Massengill, The Lisa Best
Blues Band, Cliff Eberhardt, The David Earle Johnson Latin Jazz
Band, Savoy Brown, and The Nichols Company Band, Schneider said
Friday.
   Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Johnny Winter and the duo of Edgar Winter
and Leon Russell are also expected to play, and clown Wavey Gravy
will repeat his role as concert emcee on the first day of the
concert, the promoter said.
   State health officials approved the concert Thursday, saying
promoters had complied with all health requirements.
   Authorities rejected an earlier proposal for the concert, saying
it didn't adequately plan for congestion of traffic and people.
Promoters then limited the number of tickets to 4,000 _ a far cry
from the estimated 450,000 people who inundated the tiny town of
Bethel in August 1969.
   ``The local people are afraid that Woodstock is going to happen
all over again, so they want to make sure that it doesn't,''
Schneider said.

   Millionaire industrialist Victor Posner
has decided to build five 30-story condominium buildings on his
oceanfront property after rejecting a state offer for a land swap.
   The Florida Department of Natural Resources had been trying
since March to persuade the Miami Beach executive to swap his 13
acres of oceanfront property for 67 acres of state-owned land near
the Doral Country Club in Miami.
   The Posner tract, the city's only undeveloped oceanfront land,
is wedged between a strip of high-rises and would have made a
perfect setting for a park, state officials said.
   But Posner thought the swap would not have been profitable for
him, said his attorney, William J. Roberts.
   The Miami land, formerly owned by the Federal Aviation
Administration, is worth $8 million while Posner's land is worth
$15 million, state officials said.
   Roberts said Posner would proceed with plans to build the
condominiums with 1,500 units on the site. Posner faces one more
hurdle: state approval for two of the five buildings that would be
built near the ocean.

   San Francisco Giants pitcher Dave Dravecky,
who made a remarkable comeback from cancer surgery, also made a
pitch for a 6-year-old boy suffering from leukemia.
   Alex Vlahos of Hillsborough sat in the stands Thursday as his
friend tossed eight strong innings in his first major-league
appearance since surgery on his pitching arm 10 months ago.
   Dravecky won the game, 4-3. His pitching performance also helped
raise tens of thousands of dollars for Alex, who desperately needs
a bone marrow transplant to beat leukemia.
   Dravecky and radio station KNBR in San Francisco launched a fund
drive this week in an effort to find a bone marrow donor for Alex.
Listeners could pledge any amount on Dravecky's pitching
performance, with the money going to offset the $75 it costs to
screen each of the potential bone marrow donors.
   The response was overwhelming.
   It may be several days before KNBR knows how much was raised,
but the station said Thursday night that pledges finally came to
$500 to $1,000 for each Dravecky pitch _ totaling between $46,000
and $92,000.

   Country music singer Janie Fricke canceled a
performance in favor of a spot on a Canadian television show, and
promoters want their $3,500 back.
   Ms. Fricke was to perform Sept. 8 in Enid at the Garfield County
Fair, but she canceled the appearance and three other shows to
accept the spot on the anniversary special in Canada.
   ``We've had tickets printed and posters made,'' said Karen
Koechel, fair secretary.
   The board had already paid her $3,500 _ 20 percent of the
$10,500 cost.
   ``We want that money back,'' Mel Spencer, fair board chairman
said. ``She broke a signed contract. I think we should see the
district attorney about filing a lawsuit.''
   Ms. Fricke was not available for comment.

   U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J.
Brennan Jr.'s name will remain on the Hudson County courthouse
despite protests by veterans who object to his opinion allowing the
burning of the American flag.
   The county Board of Freeholders on Thursday unanimously agreed
to name the 83-year-old building after Brennan, who served as
Hudson County's assignment judge from 1947 to 1951.
   Brennan authored the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion that said
burning the American flag was protected by the Constitution.
   Ten veterans, wearing their military caps, attended the meeting,
and said they were upset over the vote.
   ``It's wrong,'' said Joseph Duffy, vice commander of American
Legion Post 52 in Jersey City. ``Anybody can burn the American flag
at this moment and nothing will be done to them.''
