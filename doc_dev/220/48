   Police at the original Woodstock music
festival arrested only about 80 people, on drug charges. At the 20th
anniversary celebration, there have been four citations issued _ on
tax charges.
   Agents from the state Department of Taxation and Finance raided
vendors selling memorabilia during celebrations around Bethel on
Thursday night and accused four of not collecting the required state
sales tax, said spokesman Paul Rickard.
   The vendors were hawking T-shirts, hats, beads and other items to
10,000 people gathered on the site of 1969 festival.
   The four were charged with failure to have a certificate of
authority, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of a year in
jail and up to a $10,000 fine.
   Rickard said the state would dispatch three or four tax agents to
the site Friday night.
   ``We'll be going in for the big one tonight,'' Rickard said. ``We
anticipate that tonight, because of many more vendors coming, we'll
be giving out more citations.''
