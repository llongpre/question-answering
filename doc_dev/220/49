It was 20 years ago today that Nancy Nevins de Jongh walked on stage during the 
opening hours of Woodstock and began to sing. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the epochal festival on a farm in Upstate New York has taken on 
a burnished glow in rock lore: a gathering of peaceful tribes. The high-water 
mark of the '60s counterculture. The birth of the commercial giant and 
mass-media force that rock was to become. 
</P>
<P>
For de Jongh, whose band, Sweetwater, was the third act on the bill, Woodstock 
was nothing so lofty or enduring. It was a weekend that began with no great 
expectations, unfolded with worry, discomfort and frustration, devolved into 
farce and ended with regret. Twenty years on, de Jongh and Sweetwater have 
subsided into virtual oblivion, despite having played rock's most famous show. 
</P>
<P>
But as de Jongh sat the other day in her sunlit apartment overlooking the ocean 
in Laguna Beach, relating a tale that she seldom has been called upon to tell, 
there was nothing melancholy in the recounting. In the words of those more 
famed veterans of Woodstock, the Grateful Dead, a rock 'n' roll life brings the 
prerogative of being able to sit back and smile over "what a long, strange trip 
it's been." De Jongh's story certainly qualifies. 
</P>
<P>
Today she is a tall, trim woman whose appearance combines a professional look 
with an art-colony aesthetic: conservative, pastel-colored clothing, reddish 
hair worn in a neat, fashionable cut, an array of silver rings on her hands, 
and large, geometric metal shapes dangling from her ears. 
</P>
<P>
When she walked out in front of all those people late in the afternoon of Aug. 
15, 1969, she was Nansi Nevins, a tall, willowy 19-year-old with long, brown 
hair, a flowing peasant dress and a pure, forthright voice not unlike Grace 
Slick's. With her were the seven other musicians -- all men -- who made up 
Sweetwater. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Los Angeles, Sweetwater was notable for an ethnic makeup that included 
a black, two Latinos and a Czech, and for a musical lineup that de-emphasized 
guitar while making room for a folk-jazz-rock fusion featuring cello, piano, 
conga drums and flute. 
</P>
<P>
By the summer of '69, the group was making its way eagerly in the rock world, 
having released "Sweetwater," the first of three albums it would record for 
Reprise Records in 1969-71. The album notes heralded the band as "eight 
high-octane musicians who met and jammed in the great peanut butter octopus 
that is Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
When Woodstock rolled around, Sweetwater was an established touring attraction 
that had played the Fillmores East and West and shared bills with the likes of 
the Who, the Doors and Janis Joplin. 
</P>
<P>
Nansi Nevins' trip through '60s rock had begun with coffeehouse blues shows, 
played when she was still a Glendale high school girl. Early in 1967, she 
stepped on stage with an unwieldy, 26-piece jam band called Jay Walker and the 
Pedestrians and sang "Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child." In 
concentrated form, that group coalesced as Sweetwater. 
</P>
<P>
They were taken in hand by a well-connected manager, Bruce Glattman, who got 
them a record deal and set them up with prominent bookings. "Bruce was a good 
friend of Bill Graham," de Jongh recalled. "Graham booked us in the Fillmore 
all the time -- East and West. We had a following, and we were a draw. I 
suppose that's how we got the Woodstock booking." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater figured it was nothing to get too excited about. "We were on the 
circuit of pop festivals," she said. "They were generally just hot and sweaty, 
and the music was hard to hear. We thought it was just another festival." 
</P>
<P>
On the Friday that began Woodstock, Sweetwater checked in at the Holiday Inn in 
Liberty, N.Y., which was a staging ground and nerve center for the festival's 
performers and organizers. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like everyone was running around with their heads cut off," de Jongh 
said in a modulated, soft-textured voice. "I thought, 'Now, this is a mess.' I 
hadn't seen that before (at festivals). Usually they were a lot more 
controlled. This one was really chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
"We just plunked our bags in our rooms and threw on some clothes. It was a 
muggy, hot August day. We figured we'd jump in the car and just go out there to 
the stage. And then immediately the car stopped on this one-lane road, and 
anxiety set in. Just total gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers sent out helicopters to ferry stranded musicians to the festival. 
Having never flown in a helicopter, de Jongh had a frightful ride during which 
she thought of a harrowing plane flight Sweetwater had taken during a snowy 
tour of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
When the band arrived backstage, Richie Havens had already finished the 
festival-opening set that pretty much made his career. On stage was act number 
two: a band of Hare Krishnas chanting in a circle. 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh said: "I thought, 'What could this be? This is ridiculous.' I had a 
cynical outlook at this point. It was really crazy." 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh saw more signs of disorganization at the festival site. Amid the 
scurry, she picked up bits of discomfiting information: Organizers had lost 
control of the entrances, and people were pouring in without tickets. And a 
storm was blowing in. 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh has few distinct memories of Sweetwater's performance, other than that 
she was disappointed to find that there was a 15-foot-wide photographers' pit 
separating the stage from the audience. Sweetwater's act usually involved lots 
of close-range interaction with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a standard 45-minute set. I remember thinking that the other band 
members seemed really far away. We were spread out (on the large stage). It 
sounds hokey, but the crowd had really good vibes. It was hard not to just 
stare back at them, because it was so big." 
</P>
<P>
Even with good vibes from the audience, de Jongh and the other members still 
had deep misgivings about what they perceived as the lack of organization 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt kind of dangerous," she said. "I felt real harassed. And you felt real 
powerless and out of control. But if I was in the crowd, I probably would have 
thought 'What a great party!' 
</P>
<P>
"It always seemed while we were there that everything was on the edge of 
falling apart. By Saturday, everything probably got calmer because they knew 
what was going on by then. But Friday, nobody knew, and it could go either 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater had already played on bills with many of the famous acts that were 
to follow, so band members thought that they would not be missing much by 
leaving right away. But leaving was not. Helicopters were coming in regularly 
at the backstage landing area, but there was a crush of people who had the same 
idea as Sweetwater and wanted to get back to the Holiday Inn. De Jongh recalled 
running repeatedly to catch a copter, only to be frustrated when someone else 
got there first. 
</P>
<P>
After several hours passed, she and three others from Sweetwater were airborne. 
But within minutes, the helicopter was dropping in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
"We started to go down," she said. "I remember thinking, 'We're gonna die!' " 
But the pilot managed to set the helicopter down at a tiny airfield somewhere 
near the festival. From there, he drove off in a car with two field attendants, 
abandoning the rockers to fend for themselves. They used a pay phone to summon 
help, but no help arrived until 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
When they got back to the Holiday Inn, de Jongh said, they found that other 
band members who had driven there from the festival had smashed the roof of 
their U-Haul truck into the hotel's entrance overhang. 
</P>
<P>
"What could happen next? We decided we'd better get out of there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The band drove to New York City, got on a plane and returned to Los Angeles. By 
the time they got back, "it was all over the news" that Woodstock had been a 
landmark event. 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh said: "We were thinking, 'Gosh, you're kidding.' We flew home, only to 
discover it was Woodstock we'd fled from. All I've heard for 20 years is what a 
great time everybody had. Sometimes I feel real sorry for myself. It was like 
missing a party." 
</P>
<P>
But missing out on history was soon the least of de Jongh's problems. In 
December, 1969, a few days after Sweetwater had played on national TV on the 
Red Skelton Show, a drunk driver rammed into her car on the Ventura Freeway. 
The wreck put her in a 10-day coma and caused permanent damage to her vocal 
chords. 
</P>
<P>
She worked to rehabilitate her voice, which took on a rougher, tawnier hue. But 
de Jongh's injury and the layoff that followed were the first in a series of 
internal strains for Sweetwater that led to its breakup in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so determined to keep going," de Jongh said. "I moved into a little room 
in Laurel Canyon with a piano, and I started to learn more about the music 
business and about writing a tune." She emerged in 1975 with a solo album for 
Tom Cat Records, a subsidiary of RCA. But the label folded, de Jongh said, and 
her career became nebulous again. 
</P>
<P>
Her last public performance was a charity show at a veterans hospital in 1977. 
"I got real, real tired and stressed out," she said, and decided to try family 
life instead. She married in 1978 and moved to Laguna Beach. By 1980, she was 
divorced and scraping for money. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no job skills," she said. "I started housecleaning for a living. I was 
real confused. I didn't know if I could make it in music again." 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh stopped telling most people about her rock 'n' roll past: "I got real 
quiet. Housecleaning is real good for your humility. Would you believe it if 
your housecleaner came in and said, 'I used to have a Mercedes and four 
albums?' It was real character-building." 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh turned to writing in her spare time, while putting herself through 
college with her earnings as a housekeeper and a tutor. Now, no longer cleaning 
house, she is working toward a master's degree in English at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, 20 years after Woodstock, she will step onto a smaller stage 
for a performance that may ultimately prove more significant in her personal, 
long, strange trip through life. The stage will be a classroom at Cal State 
Fullerton, where de Jongh will tackle her first regular teaching assignment as 
a part-time instructor in the college's basic writing program. 
</P>
<P>
Fiction writing is her main creative outlet these days. Although she still 
keeps an upright piano in her apartment, the prominent spot with the ocean view 
belongs to a computer terminal and printer. 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh has fallen out of touch with her former Sweetwater band mates: August 
Burns, Alex Del Zoppo, Fred Herrera, Albert B. Moore, Elpidio Cobian, R.G. 
Carlyle and Alan Malarowitz. 
</P>
<P>
"I generally don't tell people about it," she said of her life as a '60s 
rocker. But with the much-publicized festival anniversary upon us, de Jongh 
decided it might be time to recall Sweetwater's comic-ironic footnote in 
Woodstock history. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting for 20 years for somebody to ask me what happened," she 
said.
