   Curiously, Martha Bayles seems to have developed her impressions of the Woodstock Music and Arts festival and the people who attended from the very media whose romantic reminiscences she deplores in her article, "Unliberating Memories" (Leisure and Arts, Aug. 7). 
As one who attended the three-day event, I was offended by her cynical characterizations of the festival goers as into romanticism, socialism and transcendence and find that her analysis serves only to further distort the already distorted collective memories of Woodstock. 

   Along with most of those in attendance, I went for the music. 
I purchased tickets well in advance only to find they weren't collected. 
There was nothing romantic about abandoning one's car and hiking to the festival site -- but with the complete lack of planning by festival organizers, there was no other choice. 
The only nudity I saw was in the film version issued by Warner Bros. in the 1970s. 
I brought plenty of food and was appalled when food drops were made by the National Guard. 
I couldn't wait to escape the mud, the heat and the garbage. 
In fact, none of the people with whom I went to Woodstock nor any I have met since are nostalgic for this festival or ever thought for a minute that the Woodstockians' "nation," as Ms. Bayles describes it, "was a viable alternative to 'the system' . . ." 
When the festival was over, we all returned to our jobs on Monday, glad to be home. 
The fact is, even the music wasn't that good.
