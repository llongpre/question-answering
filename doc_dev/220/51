   CASH-FLOW DISCLOSURE for annual reports stirs debate. 

   A year ago, the Financial Standards Accounting Board started requiring that annual reports break down assets and investments by streams of cash. 
A recent survey says most securities analysts feel the rule helps them but won't help individual investors. 
Patricia McConnell of Bear Stearns says the rule results in "a more level playing field." 
Stuart Sheppard of Ketchum Public Relations says, "Companies are being bought, sold and ripped apart on the basis of cash flow and breakup values." 

   Quaker Oats Co., Chicago, an ardent believer in increasing cash flow, analyzed it in its annual reports before the FASB requirement. 
Rorer Group Inc., Fort Washington, Pa., says the rule doesn't go far enough, noting it doesn't permit stating cash flow on a per-share basis. 
Train Trailer Co., Chicago, says operating cash flow is important but too complex to explain. 
"Very few people would end up understanding it," says Robert Zimmerman, chief financial officer. 

   Financial institutions find gathering cash-flow data costly, so the FASB proposes to ease the disclosures for them. 

   WOODSTOCK MEMORIES are profitable -- for big business anyway. 

   It began as an "Aquarian Exposition." 
It ended as a symbol of the '60s. 
The Woodstock Music and Art Fair in August 1969 left a Bethel, N.Y., farm in a shambles, but Warner Communications may yet clean up. 
The firm, which still co-owns rights to the original event, will re-release two albums and home-video version of the film, but the three-day festival won't be repeated this year. 
"Maybe a 21st anniversary concert," says John Roberts of Woodstock Ventures. 
Seven original acts band together for a "69/89 20th Anniversary Celebration Tour." 

   The Woodstock logo -- a dove perched on a guitar neck -- is selling on T-shirts and mugs, among other things. 
Meanwhile, merchants in Woodstock, N.Y., say business is slow. 
"Either they're all waiting for August or they envision mud and long lines of traffic," says Jean Gaede of the local Chamber of Commerce, adding that no special event is planned. 
"The media is making a lot of hype and scaring our customers away," complains Albert Hoffman, an innkeeper. 

   OFFERING THE BEST PRICE won't by itself win and keep customers. 

   The quality of salesmanship is crucial in buyer-seller relationships, but it often falls short of the buyer's expectations, according to a study by Learning International, Stanford, Conn., a sales and management training firm. 
When asked what caused a buyer to drop a supplier, buyers in the survey indicated the fault often lay with the sales person. 
"The driving issue was breach of partnership," says Edward R. Del Gaizo, who directed the study. 

   The hottest trend in buyer-seller strategies is "partnerships," says Robert J. Bretz, materials-management director at Pitney Bowes Inc. 
The goal: reduce cutthroat bidding based solely on price "and get serious about negotiations that go way beyond price considerations." 
In such partnerships, the buyer gives the supplier more internal data than is typical in the course of a bidding war. 
William A. Bales, a Union Pacific Corp. unit purchasing executive, says, "How suppliers serve you depends on how closely you track their performance." 

   When Union Pacific Railroad started tracking suppliers' on-time performance in 1987, it found 40% of orders arrived late. 
Now it's only 14%, Bales says. 

   BETTOR HALF: Just 5% of all adults account for half the spending on state lotteries, says a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Mass. 
That group wagers about $1,100 each annually. 
Most likely lottery players: males, Hispanics, blacks, the middle-aged, Catholics, laborers and people lacking college degrees. 

   THE DISABLED ACHIEVER is the theme of new ads for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, New York. 
Instead of portraying the disabled as helpless, the ads feature, among others, a quadriplegic marine biologist and a paraplegic model. 

   BAD DEBT in 1989 will cost each U.S. resident $250 in the form of higher consumer-goods prices needed to recover related losses, says the American Collectors Association, Minneapolis. 

   VENTURE-LEASING DEALS proliferate as a way to nurture start-ups. 

   Since 1986, equipment-leasing companies have provided $329 million in financing for new companies that couldn't get bank loans, says Lloyd Mintz of Venture Economics, a Wellesley Hills, Mass., consulting firm. 
A total of $154.9 million was invested in 1988, up 69% from 1987. 
To compensate for the risk of lending to a start-up, leasing companies also take an equity position. 
The total returns: 22% to 24%, some leasing firms say. 

   A lessor typically will take equity in return for leasing such gear as computers or machinery and providing a line of credit. 
"Venture leasing is attractive to young, cash-poor companies because it removes equipment debt from their balance sheets," but the strategy is still "a relatively new, unproven investment vehicle," Mintz says. 

   Geoff Woolley of Dominion Ventures, a San Francisco venture-leasing firm, says the field is destined to be a profitable but small niche business. 

   BRIEFS: The average supermarket loses a steak a day from the meat case, says Knogo Corp., a Hauppauge, N.Y., maker of anti-theft systems. . . . 
Fertil-A-Chron Inc., Deer Park, N.Y., guarantees conception in six months using its computerized fertility indicator or your $145 will be refunded.
