   A former Boeing Co. executive is facing
charges he stole and reproduced classified Pentagon and National
Security Council documents.
   Richard Lee Fowler, 64, was indicted Tuesday on charges that he
stole secret Pentagon planning documents while he was selling Boeing
products to the military from 1979 to 1985.
   Reached at his Springfield, Va., home Tuesday night, Fowler
declined to comment.
   The classified documents described the Pentagon's Planning,
Programming and Budgeting System, which is used to plan future
weapons purchases.
   ``Possession of these documents would provide a competitive edge
to anyone in the business of supplying the (Defense Department) with
tactical and strategic weaponry,'' Pentagon Inspector General June
Gibbs Brown said in a statement.
   Fowler, who had been a senior marketing analyst with Boeing, was
charged with 39 felony counts, including a charge he removed the
``secret'' classification stamp from some documents and reproduced
them for other Boeing executives.

<NOTE>US Hopes to Work on Anti-Apartheid Discussions</NOTE>

   The State Department says it hopes to conduct
an ``active dialogue'' with the new South African leadership to
press for an end to apartheid.
   However, the department declined comment Tuesday on the
resignation of President P.W. Botha, calling it an internal South
African affair.
   ``We look forward to an active dialogue with the new South
African government as part of our efforts to promote real
negotiations leading to a non-racial democracy in South Africa,''
department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   Asked whether acting President F.W. de Klerk would be invited to
visit the United States, Boucher said that ``will be determined
mutually in our discussions.''
   De Klerk, who is expected to be elected president in September,
was to be the first South African leader to visit the United States
in 30 years. But he postponed his summer visit, citing a heavy
campaign schedule, under pressure from Congress.

serve 1,200 hours of community service. He is proceeding with the
community service while appealing the three felony convictions.

<NOTE>Drug Czar Says Nostalgia for Woodstock Mistaken</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug czar William J. Bennett says part of the
legacy of Woodstock was tolerance of drugs and that Americans should
be glad that times have changed.
   Bennett emerged Tuesday from a White House meeting on anti-drug
strategy with President Bush to complain about ``memory distortion''
going on about the rock concert in upstate New York that captivated
a generation 20 years ago.
   The 45-year-old Bennett, a onetime guitar player and fan of early
rock 'n' roll, recited what he called ``the casualty list from
Woodstock'': rock performers who died in later years from drug
overdoses.
   They included Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Moon of the Who
and Paul Butterfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band.
   ``Part of the legacy of Woodstock was tolerance of drugs and let
us be glad that is over rather than wishing it were back,'' Bennett
said. ``We do not want 1969 back in terms of its view of drugs.
We've come too far.''
