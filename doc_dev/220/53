Drug policy director William J. Bennett complained Tuesday about the "memory 
distortion" in the nostalgia that has welled up around the 20th anniversary of 
the Woodstock festival. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old Bennett, a one-time guitar player and fan of early rock 'n' 
roll, recited what he called a "casualty list from Woodstock" of rock 
performers, including singer Janis Joplin, who died in later years from drug 
overdoses. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who as a graduate student at the University of Texas in the late 1960s 
had a blind date with Joplin, said "part of the legacy of Woodstock was 
tolerance of drugs, and let us be glad that is over, rather than wishing it 
were back. We do not want 1969 back in terms of its view of drugs. We've come 
too far."
