   The town is non-existent and some of the star
performers are dead _ but people were roaming the hills of western
Maryland looking for a rock concert being broadcast ``live'' by a
Baltimore radio station.
   In the tradition of Orson Welles' electrifying ``War of the
Worlds'' broadcast in 1938 of Martians landing in New Jersey, radio
station WGRX-FM sponsored a ``fantasy'' rock concert over the
weekend in the fictitious Livestock, a la the legendary Woodstock.
   The concert featured headliners such as Jimi Hendrix, Led
Zeppelin, the Eagles, and a reunion of the Beatles. Who wouldn't
skip the traditional Memorial Day weekend picnic for a chance to
witness rock history? Especially if the concert sponsors could
bring Jimi Hendrix back among the living.
   It was billed as attracting crowds on the scale of those who had
trooped to the now-legendary love-in and songfest in New York state
in 1969.
   One man stopped at the State Police barracks in Hagerstown to
ask directions. ``He came into the barracks, right to the front
desk. `I'm up here for the concert. Can you direct me to Livestock?
I been listening to it on the radio all the way up here,''' Sgt.
Kenneth Frick said.
   Livestock doesn't exist, Frick told the man, who sheepishly got
back into his car and drove away. ``I don't think he wanted to tell
me who he was after he realized he had been duped,'' the police
officer said.
   As many as two dozen people called the Hagerstown barracks
Saturday night and Sunday about the concert, Frick said. Others
called the state police in Cumberland.
   And despite radio accounts of less-than-desirable conditions at
Livestock, lines for the port-a-pots a mile long, people sleeping
in trees, and sweaty concertgoers cooling off in a muddy creek,
people still wanted to be there.

   For $30 a day, aspiring cowpokes can
saddle up and have the pleasure of falling off horses and dodging
bulls at the Lazy C Rodeo Ranch.
   For nearly 30 years, owner Ray Cox, 55, has been teaching the
hardy how not to get killed by a bucking horse or bull.
   ``He's had every bone in his body broken,'' said Lazy C Rodeo
secretary Debbie Dodd of her boss.
   ``He broke his foot about a year ago when he got throwed by a
bull. (The foot) was broken in two places. He limped around about a
half hour, said `that's enough sympathy,' and went on like nothing
happened,'' Dodd said.
   Saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, bull riding, barrel
racing and bullfighting are all taught at the ranch.
   The cowboys and cowgirls at the Lazy C come from all parts of
the country, including Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee,
Arkansas, Michigan and even some city slickers from Chicago.
   Dodd says Cox doesn't tell students when they've done something
right, but points out their mistakes.
   ``Because as soon as you think you're good, you lose you're fear
and then you can get killed,'' she said.
   Cox said he has ridden almost every breed of horse.
   ``I always say, if he walks on the ground, I can get him
ridden,'' Cox said.

   You've got to wield a hefty
hatchet to win the woodchopping championship of the world, and
you've got to do it in Webster Springs, where sideshows to the
annual timber titles include tobacco-spitting and ax-shaving
contests
   ``This is an excellent competition,'' said Cliff Hughes of
Auckland, New Zealand, one of several woodchoppers who traveled
from overseas for this year's nine-day Webster County Woodchopping
Festival.
   Arden Cogar, 54, a veteran logger who founded the Webster County
Woodchopping Festival in 1960, estimated there are ``about 50 to 60
woodchopping shows held each year in the United States now.''
   But perhaps nowhere in the United States is woodchopping as
appreciated as it is in Webster County, a lumbering region that's
home to the world's tallest sycamore tree.
   At least 25,000 people attended this year's festival which ended
Sunday, according to festival director Randall Underwood.
   The festival includes nine categories of woodchopping, in which
the winners are determined by how fast they fell their trees. This
year's winner of the all-around grand champion title was Melvin
Lentz of Oregon.
