   Thursday, Aug. 3, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Out of Mind." 
This segment of "48 Hours" spotlights the problems of the severely mentally ill, now that we are accustomed to seeing them adrift on our city streets. 

   Saturdays, Aug. 5-19, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on A&amp;E (repeated at 1 a.m.): "The Rainbow." 
When it was first published in 1915, D.H. Lawrence's strange, intense novel about a young woman's conflicting needs for love and liberation was suppressed. 
Now it's a BBC-TV miniseries. 
Not to be confused with the recent feature film by Ken Russell, this three-hour TV film is the most successful screen adaptation of Lawrence to date. 

   Sunday, Aug. 6, 1-4 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "American Bowl '89." 
The Cleveland Browns and the Philadelphia Eagles meet in London's Wembley Stadium as the NFL kicks off its exhibition season. 

   Monday, Aug. 7, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and times vary, so check local listings): "Dawn's Early Light: Ralph McGill and the Segregated South." 
The first film to document the life of the famous editor of the Atlanta Constitution who took a stand against segregation in the 1960s while also trying to understand and communicate with his fellow white Southerners. 

   Wednesday, Aug. 9, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "Fatal Addictions." 
This NBC News special will remind us that the inner-city crack epidemic is not the only calamity of its kind. 
A week later, "Gangs, Cops &amp; Drugs" (Tuesday and Wednesday, Aug. 1516, 10-11 p.m. EDT, also on NBC) will remind us that the problem of the inner city is nonetheless the worst. 

   Thursday, Aug. 10, 9-11:30 p.m. EDT, on A&amp;E (repeated at 1 a.m. and Aug. 13): "The Rivals." 
Watching reruns of "All in the Family" just to hear Archie Bunker's malapropisms? 
This BBC production of Sheridan's classic farce revives the original Mrs. Malaprop -- a shrewd awakening, if ever there was one. 

   Thursday, Aug. 10, 8:05-9:05 p.m. EDT, on TBS (repeated on Aug. 12 and 17): "Comin' Home: A Rockin' Reunion." 
Instead of paying to see Dennis Quaid lampoon Jerry Lee Lewis in "Great Balls of Fire," watch this documentary about the real good ol' days of rockabilly. 
Dick Clark interviews Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and the late Roy Orbison. 

   Friday and Saturday, Aug. 11-12, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on VH-1: "Woodstock." 
The 1960s generation may now relive its greatest gathering via this broadcast of an edited version of the Warner Bros. film. 
VH-1 will also air a special on Woodstock on Friday, Aug. 11, 8-9 p.m. (repeated Aug. 12, 13 and 15). 

   Saturday, Aug. 12, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on Showtime (repeated Aug. 16, 21, 27, 31 and Sept. dates to be announced): "The Turn of the Screw." 
Despite the presence of Amy Irving, this film of Henry James's psychological/supernatural thriller has two flaws. 
First, it was shot in Beverly Hills in 100-degree heat -- not Victorian enough to be convincing. 
Second, it portrays a young governness driven to evil visions by the presence of nude paintings -- too Victorian to be convincing. 

   Sunday, Aug. 13, 8 p.m.-midnight EDT and 5-9 p.m. PDT (repeated at midnight EDT and 9 p.m. PDT) on Pay Per View Cable TV: "Moscow Music Peace Festival." 
Presented on MTV, this hard-rock concert from Lenin Stadium claims the mantle of Woodstock. 
The negative difference is in the music -- instead of Sly Stone, the Band and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, this concert has Bon Jovi, Scorpions and Motley Crue. 
The positive difference is in the message -- instead of being blissed out, this concert is rhetorically sober. 
In fact, it's a benefit for the anti-drug Make A Difference Foundation, which was founded by Doc McGhee as part of his community service probation for a minor drug conviction. 
Oh -- did I mention that Doc McGhee manages Bon Jovi, Scorpions and Motley Crue? 

   Monday, Aug. 14, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "James Baldwin: The Price of the Ticket." 
This "American Masters" film offers a fascinating look at the brilliance, self-indulgence and self-righteousness of the late writer.
