   News stories about the airliner crash in Sioux
City, Iowa, were followed closely by more than half of the American
public, but most readers and viewers paid scant attention to the
anniversary of Woodstock, a survey released Wednesday showed.
   The latest in a series of news indexes by the Times Mirror Center
for Press &amp; Public Policy showed that 53 percent of those responding
followed ``very closely'' the news reports about the crash July 19
of the United Airlines DC-10, which killed 111 of the 296 on board.
   By contrast, 9 percent said they followed very closely the
stories about the anniversary of Woodstock, the upstate New York
rock festival that got under way 20 years ago Tuesday and is being
marked as a cultural milestone.
   The latest survey, conducted by the Gallup Organization Inc., was
done over a four-day period ending Sunday.
   The second-ranking story in the survey was the killing of Marine
Lt. Col. William Higgins by his Lebanese captors, with 49 percent
saying they followed it very closely.
   Third, with 26 percent, was the passage in Congress of
legislation to bail out failing savings and loan institutions.
   The percentage of readers and viewers who said they were
following very closely the investigations of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development rose from 15 percent a month ago to 21
percent.
   Only 6 percent could identify Samuel Pierce as the Cabinet
officer in charge of the department at the time covered by the
investigations.
   But 17 percent could correctly identify Felix Bloch, the diplomat
under investigation as a suspected Soviet spy.
   Of 55 news stories included in surveys beginning in 1986, only
the explosion of the space shuttle challenger with 80 percent, the
rescue of a little girl who fell into a well in Texas with 69
percent and the U.S. air strike against Libya with 58 percent were
followed very closely by more Americans than was the Sioux City
crash.
   The only news story, of those selected for use in the surveys,
that was followed very closely by fewer viewers than Woodstock was
the coverage in May of the scandal that brought about the
resignation of the Japanese prime minister and other officials. Only
6 percent said they paid very close attention to it.
   Interviewers questioned 1,250 adults, 18 and over, by telephone.
Times-Mirror officals said the reported percentages might be off by
four points or so, as a reflection of the general population,
because of sampling error.
