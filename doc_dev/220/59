   Former Chicago Bears running back Walter Payton
and movie star Chuck Norris are out to make names for themselves in
a new field _ power boating.
   The pair will roar across Lakes Michigan and Huron on Thursday
in a 46-foot power boat in an attempt to break a speed record set
in 1983 by another celebrity boater, Michael Reagan, son of Ronald
Reagan.
   On a 605-mile course that begins and ends in Chicago, the beefy
stars and two crew members will try to best Reagan's time of 12
hours, 34 minutes and 41 seconds.
   Norris set a record for diesel-powered boats in a 440-mile race
from San Francisco to Los Angeles last August. Payton has been
racing automobiles since retiring from the NFL after the 1987
season.
   The record try is a benefit for the United Way.

   Valerie Harper was among more than 50
celebrities backing a planned march on Washington to demand that
the goverment put up more money for the homeless.
   ``I think America's had it,'' the actress said Tuesday at a news
conference Tuesday in Los Angeles. ``There is a deep need and
desire that homelessness end, and that people have houses or
apartments that they can afford.''
   Among those joining Miss Harper in announcing the Oct. 7 march
were actors Jon Voight, Ally Sheedy, Jean Stapleton and Harry Dean
Stanton and musician Quincy Jones. The marchers will demand
restoration federal funding for affordable housing that they say
was lost during the eight years of the Reagan administration.

   Moody Blues bassist John Lodge says
he's happy young people are joining the '60s nostalgia crowd at the
group's concerts, but he finds the music must be tailored a bit to
today's teens.
   The songs have to be shorter to appeal to 1980s audiences, Lodge
said as the band prepared for a weekend concert.
   ``You have to have a lot more instat music today,'' Lodge said.
``Perhaps people don't want to find out for themselves what a song
means.''
   Of the baby-boomers, he said: ``Older audiences are nostalgic so
you don't know if they're listening and thinking of what the song
means to them and their memories, or if they are listening to
what's coming off stage.''

are among the musicians who have signed up to perform at a
Woodstock reunion concert, the promoter says.
   The concert is planned for Aug. 15-17 at the Imperial Resort,

gathered for rock music's main event 20 years ago.
   Others who have agreed to join the reunion concert are Ravi
Shankar and Johnny Winter, said Bruce Taylor, vice president of the
resort, when he announced the concert plans Tuesday.
