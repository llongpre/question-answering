   A Woodstock reunion concert drew just a
handful of people, and promoters offered cut-rate tickets to
thousands who came to the site of the original concert on the
event's 20th anniversary.
   State police estimated 10,000 people Thursday night were at the
farm, once owned by Max Yasgur, where more than 400,000 young people
gathered Aug. 15-17, 1969, for Woodstock.
   At the Imperial Hotel in Swan Lake, about 10 miles away, the
audience of 250 attending the opening of a three-day ``Remember
Woodstock'' concert was almost outnumbered by security guards,
vendors and reporters. Promoters had hoped for a crowd of 4,000.
   Thursday afternoon, ``Remember Woodstock'' promoters sent buses
over to the Bethel site, hoping to entice customers with cheap
tickets and a free ride to the hotel and back. There were few takers
for the $5 tickets, which originally had been priced at $30,
promoters said.
   Some people who attended the Imperial concert left the hotel to
go to the original site, where free music was offered on a makeshift
stage.
   Richard Pell, the unofficial master of ceremonies in Bethel, said
Imperial Vice President Bruce Taylor was booed from the stage when
he tried to entice people to go to the hotel.
   ``They had six buses up here,'' Pell said. ``They asked $5 a
ticket and they bus you up there. Four people left. The music is
here.''
   Concert promoter Elliott Schneider blamed the small turnout in
part to rumors that major rock groups were going to appear at the
Bethel site.
   Schneider said the concert could break even if about 6,000 people
attend the three-day event. He said he expects attendance to
increase considerably Friday and Saturday.
   ``All my business sense told me not to try it,'' said Imperial
owner Michael Chung. ``But I tell you now, we're going to make this
thing an annual event.''
   The Imperial concert started about 5 p.m. when Woodstock's
original master of ceremonies, Wavy Gravy, shirtless and wearing
tie-dyed shorts and a propeller beanie, came on stage.
   ``I challenge William Bennett to a debate,'' he said, responding
to federal drug czar Bennett's lament earlier this week that the
press was glorifying the memory of a 1969 concert well-known for
rampant drug use.
   Gravy introduced Thursday's performers, who included Woodstock
veteran John Sebastian and David Massengil, Futu Futu, Willie
Nininger and Family, the Woodstock All Star Band, Leon Russell and
Edgar Winter.
