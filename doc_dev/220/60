   Richie Havens, the folk singer whose politically
oriented songs helped define the Woodstock generation, said after a
rally Thursday near the Democratic National Convention that he's
never voted and probably never will.
   Havens performed three songs during the rally for independent
presidential candidate Lenora B. Fulani.
   In an interview after the rally was interrupted by a sudden
heavy rain, Havens said his political focus is on the millions of
people who do not vote and are unhappy with both major political
parties.
   ``For about 11 years now, I've been working with trying to
figure out why it is the majority of people don't vote,'' Havens
said. ``It isn't apathy, as the press might say, or it isn't that
they don't care about the country.
   ``They don't find anything to vote for, just like me. I'm a
non-voter myself. I never voted and I probably won't until an
individual can get a chance to vote for his country, and not for a
party.''
   Havens, remembered by many for his emotional performance at the
Woodstock festival in 1969, said he performs year-round and
recently completed his 20th tour of Europe.
   He said he continues to find an audience for his style of music,
and said more young people are discovering the music from his 1960s
heyday.
   Havens added that wherever he goes, people still ask him about
Woodstock.
   ``It's a big boom, it's a big return to a consciousness of music
going on in the world, actually,'' he said. ``Most of my friends
who were screaming about their kids listening to heavy metal a few
years ago are glad now that they're stealing their 1960s records.''
