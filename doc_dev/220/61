   Joe Cocker, the hell-raiser of rock 'n'
roll, has unchained his heart and says he's a reformed man.
   Though its been almost two decades since he performed a
memorable rendition of ``With a Little Help From My Friends'' at
the Woodstock music festival, Cocker is riding a new wave of
popularity with his album ``Unchain My Heart,'' and is proving he
is no fading star.
   On his eighth tour to Australia this month, the 44-year-old
rocker is playing 15,000-seat venues amid huge publicity.
   His consumption of booze and drugs is legendary, as are his
rasping voice and twitching body moves. But he's best remembered
for his appearance at Woodstock in 1969, and the Mad Dogs and
Englishmen tour, with its huge entourage of 40 musicians, wives,
girlfriends, children and hangers-on. Recordings and movies were
made of both. He's also known for many ``comebacks.''
   
   ``With a Little Help From My Friends'' was Cocker's first big
hit single in Europe and the title of his first album in 1969.
   
   His hit singles in the United States include ``The Letter'' and
``Cry Me a River'' in 1970, ``You Are So Beautiful'' in 1974 and
the 1982 duet with Jennifer Warnes, ``Up Where We Belong,'' from
the soundtrack of ``An Officer and a Gentleman.'' The duet has been
his only No. 1 hit in the United States and won both Cocker and
Warnes their only Grammy.
   Cocker's three most recent albums are on Capitol: ``Civilized
Man'' in 1984; ``Cocker,'' 1986; and ``Unchain My Heart,'' 1987, an
LP inspired by Ray Charles who originally recorded the title cut.
   He's come through some tough times and ``made and lost baby
fortunes,'' but his appetite for life remains undiminished. The
calm, contented Cocker of 1988 is vastly changed from the raw,
rampaging singer of more than a decade ago.
   He once was known as one of the most unreliable people in show
business. Nowadays, Cocker treats his business very differently.
   ``I still go a bit nuts once in a while _ everybody does,'' he
said. ``But I take my performing very seriously now. I don't like
to get wrecked before a show.''
   Moderation is his keyword _ he's aware he took himself to the
brink, and survived.
   Cocker, born in working-class Sheffield in the north of England,
began working as a musician at the age of 16, playing drums and
harmonica for a band known as the Cavaliers. He switched to vocals
in 1961 and the group changed its name to Vance Arnold and the
Avengers, supporting such acts as the Hollies and the Rolling
Stones.
   Cocker quit his job as a gas fitter in 1964 for a music career,
but he wasn't very successful and returned to life with the East
Midlands Gas Board.
   His big break came when he assembled the Grease Band in the
1960s. The group recorded a cover of the Beatles tune ``With a
Little Help From My Friends,'' which became a No. 1 hit in Britain.
   After Woodstock, Cocker went on to team with Leon Russell for
the legendary Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour of 1970, which produced
a film, a double LP and the hit songs ``Delta Lady'' and ``The
Letter.''
   Then his career went downhill. His drunkenness increased, and he
was arrested in Australia for possession of marijuana.
   ``I had times when I went on very bad down trips,'' he said.
   His output, despite the 1974 hit, ``You Are So Beautiful,''
became decidely patchy.
   ``There are things about the mid-'70s that I dont remember at
all,'' he admits.
   His career revived in 1982 when he teamed with Warnes for ``Up
Where We Belong.'' His recent hits include ``A Civilized Man,''
``Shelter Me,'' ``Dont You Love Me Anymore,'' ``You Can Leave Your
Hat On'' and the rhythm and blusey ``Unchain My Heart.''
   Cocker says that while he has mellowed and become more
disciplined, his stage performance has not.
   ``Im still a pretty wild performer,'' he said. ``I feel
re-energized recently.''
   But he now shuns drugs: ``At 44, how many times can you beat
yourself against a wall without it hurting?
   ``I had a taste of just about everything out there,'' he said.
``I feel grateful I came out of it.''
   In 1979, he moved to Santa Barbara, Calif., and married last
year for the first time.
