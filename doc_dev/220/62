   Jimi Hendrix is dead and selling jeans in Britain.
   Still selling records, too, 20 years after his death; still
unmatched by all would-be imitators of his furious, blazing mastery
of the electric guitar.
   ``The Hendrix phenomenon has never really gone away,'' says
George McManus, marketing executive at Polydor Records.
   Two decades gone, Hendrix is a briskly moving product. Polydor's
``Cornerstones'' album hit the top five and will shortly go
platinum in Britain. Wrangler adopted ``Crosstown Traffic'' for a
jeans commercial.
   Bass player Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell, the
survivors of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, each published books this
year.
   ``Jimi's death was the most lucrative act of his sad career,''
according to Redding, whose book is partly a diatribe against the
Hendrix estate.
   The U.S. Army, which counts Hendrix as an alumnus, kicked off
the year by including his ``Voodoo Chile'' as part of its amplified
get-out-of-that-refuge concert in Panama for Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The anniversary may be a melancholy event for anyone who
remembers the first ear-boggling encounter with ``Foxy Lady,''
``Manic Depression'' or ``Purple Haze'' - ``'Scuse me, while I kiss
the sky'' - from the ``Are You Experienced?'' LP in 1967.
   Serious craziness was the Hendrix experience: a stoned banshee
swathed in psychedelic foppery, caressing and bullying and
battering his guitar; bending ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' into
weird shapes at Woodstock; amazing the plaster casters; fleeing a
concert in Denver in a cloud of tear gas; taking too many downers
and choking to death on his own vomit.
   Born in Seattle in 1942, Hendrix found fame in Britain, and
Britain is where he died, in his London apartment on Sept. 18,
1970.
   His records have always sold well, but his impact wasn't widely
recognized until the Wrangler jeans company commissioned a survey
into British teen-age musical tastes. Hendrix's name ranked high
alongside living rock stars.
   Wrangler decided to feature Hendrix's ``Crosstown Traffic'' in
what became a highly effective TV commercial. Filmed in New York,
it showed a handsome young taxi driver who dumps his cab in the
middle of Manhattan and takes off to Miami. Wrangler followed up
with another commercial including footage of Hendrix in concert.
   ``His appeal is partly his rebel image and partly his short
life, the James Dean factor,'' Polydor's McManus said. ``But deeper
than that, I believe it is because he is the source of so much of
today's music. People like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard will readily
admit to the debt they owe him. You can hear 20 seconds of a guitar
and know it is Jimi Hendrix. Very few people had that ability.''
   One of the most successful new British bands to cite Hendrix as
an influence is The Stone Roses from the thriving Manchester scene,
whose ``indie dance'' music combines psychedelia with disco-derived
``house'' music.
   Hendrix's influence can be detected on their two recent Top 10
singles, ``One Love'' and ``Fools Gold''
   ``Hendrix is top for me,'' says Stone Roses guitarist John
Squire. ``He was trying to expand peoples' minds in the '60s and
we're trying to do the same thing for the '90s. He had an extrovert
approach which we share. He is one of the few people we can relate
to.''
   The two men most closely related to Hendrix have contrasting
stories to tell.
   Redding, who was sacked from the band, emphasizes financial
matters. His book, ``Are You Experienced?'' is about the millions
of dollars worth of royalties he claims to be owed.
   Mitchell's book, ``The Hendrix Experience,'' is full of pictures
and generally happier.
   Hendrix, according to Mitchell, ``was far from a tragic
character. For one thing, he had a wicked sense of humor. That's
why the women, in particular, really liked him, because we're
talking about a man who was funny.''
   One of Hendrix's secrets as a guitar technician, Mitchell
writes, were his thumbs, ``nearly as long as his fingers.''
   Mitchell also complains about his treatment by the estate, but
he had one lucrative gift from Hendrix: a Fender Stratocaster that
sold for $350,000 at auction in April.
   One important figure who has not written his memoirs is Chas
Chandler, former bass player of The Animals who saw Hendrix in a
Greenwich Village club, brought him to England and formed The Jimi
Hendrix Experience.
   ``I considered writing a book now and again, but I never had the
time, and anyway I enjoy books too much,'' Chandler said in a rare
interview.
   He has returned to his roots in a coastal village in the
northeast of England where he lives with his family and manages a
local rock outfit, The Steve Graham Band.
   Chandler produced the first two Hendrix albums, ``Are You
Experienced?'' and ``Axis: Bold as Love,'' but quit halfway through
``Electric Ladyland,'' frustrated with the hangers-on and endless
rerecording of tracks.
   ``My only obvious regret is I wonder if I didn't walk out maybe
he would still be alive. He is a loss; he was a good friend.
Otherwise, I certainly have no regrets,'' Chandler said.
   ``I do think there is a death cult around Jimi. There is
something black about all this brooding over his death. He is
typified as some sort of brooding genius. But when he was alive he
was a very funny guy, full of laughter. He was quite a gentle lad,
quiet but witty and a good mimic.
   ``You would have thought he went everywhere and burned his
guitar. But he only did it twice.''
   Chandler said that when he met him, Hendrix hadn't written a
song. ``But I knew there was a place in England for him through the
sheer potential of his guitar. The music audiences in England had
become quite sophisticated. ... The Beatles were pushing the
boundaries of what was acceptable and audiences were quite willing
to grasp something that was experimental.''
   Chandler also believes Hendrix's appeal endures because of his
imitators.
   ``Most of the riffs played by a lot of guitar bands have their
origins in Hendrix. He was an originator of sounds, the greatest
guitar player to have lived,'' Chandler said.
