   My, my, my. 
You were unusually cranky on Aug. 17 in your "Bad Acid" editorial -- perhaps you were having a flashback from some bad stuff. 

   Well, I guess it's time we owned up. 
We Woodstock "radicals" and "veterans" really were responsible for damaging the social fabric: We did cause racial, ethnic and sexual discrimination, poverty, affordable-housing shortages and hopelessness, environmental degradation, and, probably as well, insider trading, stock-price manipulation and S&amp;L fraud. 
We did kill Janis, Jimi, Keith, et al. 
We did cause, if not invent, promiscuity and divorce, and men's irresponsibility toward the children they helped create. 
And we are responsible for those in the ghetto who use crack to figuratively escape by getting high or literally escape by getting rich. 
And, as I recall, we also instigated the Newark and Watts riots (although I was in Boston at the time). 

   Wow] That's an awful lot of power, particularly for a group that by any measure was statistically nominal. 
The Woodstock generation was a minority, even of the solidly middle-class kids who populated it. 
Rather than feel a hint of shame, we should be embarrassed that we failed. 
Nobody followed us. 

   You're darn tootin' its "impossible to link definitively the counterculture to today's social pathologies." 
But how about the following as candidates for the causes of the pathologies that afflict us: serious environmental problems and real health risks; no substantive improvement in the dead-end futures of the poor; the moderately dead-end futures for people in our robust service economy (all those great job opportunities at McDonald's and Wendy's); housing costs that have destroyed the American dream through the next generation; eight years of a callous federal government; and a middle class that works a substantial part of each year just to pay taxes. 
The causes of the pathologies you site are frustration and dashed expectations.

   "Bad Acid" was on target in its characterization of the hedonism of Woodstock, but it failed to acknowledge that the counterculture had its root causes in some of the most heinous sins of our society: the war in Vietnam, the racism of our society that was evident during the civil-rights movement, the pollution of our environment by industry, and the threat of nuclear war hanging over everyone. 

   All that certainly contributed to the desire of youth to find an escape -- paradise. 
That in this quest young people become hedonistic might be regrettable, but the sins of Woodstock still pale in comparison to the sins that gave the counterculture its genesis. 
In retrospect, the important question is: Have we learned anything? 
As long as our society is plagued with racism, pollution, greed, warmongering attitudes and, ultimately, apathy about these problems, young people will continue to become disillusioned, rebel, commit suicide, do drugs and look for other ways to escape or make revolutionary statements. 

   What young people needed then and still need today is unhypocritical leadership, not lectures about morals from those who tolerate the scourges mentioned above.

   There certainly was a big crowd at Woodstock. 
But we should remember that Woodstock represented only a very small portion of those particular age groups. 
Most members of those groups were otherwise occupied. 
Some were working, some were in school or preparing to return to fall studies and, lest we forget, a goodly number could not make the commute from Southeast Asia.
