   County officials are asking a judge to bar a
weekend rock concert for white supremacists and skinheads billed as
an ``Aryan Woodstock.''
   While Napa County officials had a court date today, the leader of
a militant Jewish group said he would lead hundreds of protesters in
a demonstration at the concert site at a ranch about 35 miles north
of San Francisco.
   ``We're going to rally with our people. (We want) such a large
number of people that the skinheads will show their colors and
scamper away like cockroaches,'' Irv Rubin, national chairman of the
Jewish Defense League, said Thursday.
   He vowed to ``take whatever consequences, including arrest,
including hospitalization and, if I have to, I'll give my life in
this battle.''
   County officials hope to block the event on the grounds that no
permit was issued and that the concert would pose a public nuisance.
   At a hearing in Napa County Superior Court Thursday, District
Attorney Jerry Mautner said the county couldn't issue a permit for
an event restricted according to race.
   Judge W. Scott Snowden scheduled another hearing for today to
give concert organizers time to respond to the county.
   Tom Metzger, leader of a group called the White Aryan Resistance,
said the concert was being organized on private land and on an
invitation-only basis. He said about 2,000 people had been invited
to listen to such bands as the Boot Boys and Hammerhead in what has
been billed as an ``Aryan Woodstock.''
   ``We're going to have some speeches, we're going to have some
music, and we're going to go home,'' Metzger told the board of
supervisors on Tuesday.
   If the court blocks the concert, Metzger said his group ``takes
no responsibility for the hundreds of skinheads walking aimlessly
through the streets of Napa County.''
   Rubin appealed to residents of Northern California to demonstrate
against what he called a ``rock for racism concert.''
