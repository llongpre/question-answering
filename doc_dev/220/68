DAVID PECK'S BUSHEL OF ROCK FOOTAGE IN HEAVY DEMAND

David Peck picked up a program from last January's annual Rock 'n' Roll Hall of 
Fame induction ceremony in New York City and proudly pointed to his name in the 
production credits. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave them footage of Simon and Garfunkel, the Four Seasons, the Kinks and 
the Platters," Peck said. "They called me up a few weeks before the show; I 
guess they got my name from somebody who'd heard of me and told them I'd 
probably have what they were looking for." 
</P>
<P>
None of this is very surprising. After six years of avid collecting, the 
23-year-old San Diegan is considered one of the foremost rock 'n' roll video 
archivists in the country. He's got more than 1,000 hours of vintage tapes, 
ranging from TV appearances and movie outtakes to promotional films and concert 
footage. 
</P>
<P>
Peck trades with, and occasionally buys from, collectors all over the world. 
From time to time, he puts on public screenings -- in San Diego and other 
cities around the country -- focusing on a particular era, genre or artist. 
</P>
<P>
Coinciding with the Warner Brothers Records release on compact disc of several 
old Jimi Hendrix albums, Peck has assembled a 90-minute program of the late 
guitar master's infrequent TV appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"Hendrix Live on TV: 1965-1970" will screen Thursday and Friday at San Diego 
State University's Backdoor. Among the dozen-plus clips included are a 1967 
performance on Belgian television of "Stone Free," a promo film of "Burning the 
Midnight Lamp" that aired on a French music show in 1968, and an eight-minute 
interview on the Dick Cavett show from 1969 in which Hendrix defends his 
controversial rendition of the national anthem three weeks earlier at 
Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to start out with a rare clip of Hendrix playing guitar with 
Little Richard's band on a 1965 episode of 'Night Train,' a local Memphis rock 
show," Peck said. "That was before anybody knew who he was. He was a nobody, so 
they didn't really focus on him, but still, there are a few good shots." 
</P>
<P>
"Another rare clip is his appearance in 1969 on a British TV show, in which he 
refused to stop playing. It was a live broadcast, and he was told he could only 
perform 'Voodoo Child' and 'Hey Joe.' 
</P>
<P>
"But in the middle of 'Hey Joe,' he stops and goes, 'Hey, we're gonna stop 
playing this rubbish and dedicate a song to Cream,' and then he goes right into 
'Sunshine of Your Love.' 
</P>
<P>
"Now, you can't see the cameramen waving him off, but they are, and at one 
point he looks right into the camera -- you know he's making eye contact -- and 
says, 'Na.' He keeps playing, and then he leans over to (drummer) Mitch 
Mitchell and you can see him mouth the word slow." 
</P>
<P>
Peck's first public video show, "Rock on TV," took place in July, 1987, at the 
La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. The program consisted of TV footage of the 
Beatles, the Kinks, the Who, the Rascals and other 1960s bands on such 
long-gone series as "Shindig," "Hullabaloo" and "The Ed Sullivan Show." 
</P>
<P>
Peck has since produced six more shows at the museum: "Soul on TV" in December, 
1987; "The Beatles: Rare Tapes" the following April and again in June; "Rare 
Stones: 1964-1974" in September, 1988; "Progressive Rock" last April, and 
"Troubadours of Rock" last June. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the museum's film curator, Greg Kahn, and Reader pop music 
writer John D'Agostino, Peck has put on three rock-video shows at the Northwest 
Film and Video Center in Portland, Ore., and one at the Scottsdale Center for 
the Arts in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Peck recently decided to go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The museum isn't really that much into doing the shows anymore, because 
they're primarily an art museum, and John's real busy doing writing and stuff," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peck said he already has several shows lined up, including a Rolling 
Stones-James Brown double-header at Webster University in St. Louis, a James 
Brown show at the Kennedy Center in Washington, and a blues and "Rock on TV" 
shows at the Athens (Ohio) Center for Film and Video. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sending out resumes right and left, and once they read my resume, they're 
usually interested on the spot," Peck said. "I'm also getting a lot of calls 
from TV production companies, asking for footage. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only so much of this stuff around, and I'm fortunate to have as much 
as I do." 
</P>
<P>
