   Echoes of the Woodstock festival reverberate in
American society 20 years after the counterculture concert rocked
the nation. But when it comes to rock 'n' roll itself, most people
say the tune's gone flat.
   Eight in 10 American adults have heard of the Woodstock
festival, held Aug. 15-17, 1969, on a muddy farm in upstate New
York _ and three in 10 of them wish they had attended, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   That high level of awareness was rooted in a view of Woodstock
as more of a historical milestone than simply a show. Most regard
it as the expression of a social movement, and half of them said
that movement continues today.
   Yet the view of Woodstock was not an idealized one. While nearly
six in 10 of those who knew of the festival said it has had a
lasting effect on American society, only half of them said the
effect was a positive one.
   Even more striking was the widely held opinion that times have
changed for the better. Just a quarter said the Woodstock era was a
better time than today, while half viewed it a worse time than now.
   But respondents were critical of the course of rock 'n' roll
music, the raucous hallmark of the Woodstock era: Rock music of the
Woodstock days was rated twice as highly as the rock 'n' roll of
today. Nearly half of all respondents said they still listen to
Woodstock-era rock.
   The poll, conducted among a random sample of 1,163 adults
nationwide, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
   As could be expected, it found a dramatic generational division
in views of Woodstock. For example, 40 percent of those younger
than 45 would have liked to have attended, compared with just 10
percent of the older respondents.
   Moreover, among those who saw a lasting social impact of
Woodstock, more than 60 percent of the younger group said it was a
positive effect, while only about a quarter of the older group
agreed.
   Interest in rock music followed similar lines. More than 60
percent of those under 45 said they listen to Woodstock-era rock
'n' roll now, evidence of the sizable audience for ``classic rock''
radio programming. Of those 45 and older, just 22 percent were
tuned in to Woodstock rock.
   Overall, 50 percent rated rock music of the late 1960s and early
1970s as excellent or good, while just 27 percent gave those
favorable ratings to the rock 'n' roll of today. Among respondents
under 45, seven in 10 gave high ratings to Woodstock rock, while
only four in 10 approved of newer rock.
   The Woodstock festival, featuring most of the top rock bands of
the day, drew half a million people to Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel,
N.Y. The term ``Woodstock Nation'' soon came to refer to young
people who were agitating for an end to the Vietnam War and the
loosening of social mores.
   Twenty percent of the poll's respondents said they knew someone
who attended Woodstock, and 25 of the 1,163 people polled said they
were there.
   The survey was conducted July 7-16. Media General Inc., a
communications company based in Richmond, Va., publishes the
Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa (Fla.)
Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, and operates TV
stations WXFL in Tampa, WCBD in Charleston, S.C., and WJKS in
Jacksonville, Fla.
