   One Rolling Stone says the ``Steel Wheels'' will
spin for only a year; his Glimmer Twin says he hopes the band will
stay together longer.
   Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, the quarrelsome frontmen for the
Rolling Stones _ the band _ revealed their disparate views to
Rolling Stone _ the magazine _ in an interview for its Sept. 7 issue.
   ``If you asked me what I wanted to do for the rest of my life,
Keith and I would probably disagree,'' said Jagger, lead vocalist
for the group. ``When it's good, it's really good. And when it isn't
good, it's boring. It's very hard to keep doing the same thing with
the same people over and over again.''
   Richards, predictably, disagreed.
   ``I can never think about starting something up again in order to
make it the last time,'' said the Stones guitarist. ``This is the
beginning of the second half.''
   Jagger said one of the reasons he decided to reunite with the
band for the ``Steel Wheels'' album and tour was that it would all
be done within a year. The tour begins Aug. 31 in Philadelphia.
   ``So we just have to put up with each other for a year,'' Jagger
said.
   Richards, who bad-mouthed Jagger in interviews and on his album
in the past year, said he knew the Stones would be able to work
together again after he and Jagger spent some time in Barbados.
   ``I did have to take Mick to a few discos _ which are not my
favorite places in the world _ because Mick likes to go out and
dance at night,'' Richards recalled. ``So I did that. That was my
sacrifice. I humored him. And that's when I knew we could work
together.''

   Woodstock veteran Richie Havens, the man who
made ``Freedom'' a hippie anthem, will offer his heady brand of folk
Saturday at the Organ Mountains Festival.
   Havens will perform at the all-day music festival to promote the
mountains as an environmentally protected area.
   The Organ Mountains Festival benefits the Bureau of Land
Management and the New Mexico Nature Conservancy, groups that work
to protect endangered plants and animals in the state.
   As the country celebrates the 20th anniversary of Woodstock this
month, Havens says the event is still being woefully misrepresented
by the media. The truth about the festival has nothing to do with
sex, drugs and music, Havens said; it has to do with numbers.
   ``So many people came that they had to write about us and our
ideas,'' Havens told the El Paso Times.
   He said he is convinced another wave of youthful rebellion will
rise: ``The kids today are Woodstock. They just don't know it yet.''

   Actor Brad Davis, nominated for an Academy
Award in 1978 for ``Midnight Express,'' is asking people to leave
their porch lights on during National POW Week to honor missing U.S.
prisoners of war.
   The gesture, coupled with using vehicle headlights in the daytime
the week of Sept. 11, is part of a campaign to get governmental
acknowledgment of war prisoners still unaccounted for, Davis said
Thursday.
   The campaign, ``Operation Bright Light: POWs ... Release In
Sight,'' will kick off with flag-raising ceremonies in Southern
California, said Joe Romo, a spokesman for a coalition of veteran's
groups.
   Romo said thousands of U.S. servicemen and women who fought in
wars dating back to World War II remain missing. ``They're our
brothers and sisters,'' he said. ``Why have they been abandoned?''

   Up-and-coming country music singer Clint
Black says he acquired neighborhood notoriety as a teen-ager in
Houston because he could play the harmonica while riding on a
skateboard.
   ``I played the harmonica at age 13, and I was always the kid on
the skateboard rolling along with my harmonica,'' he said in an
interview in The Nashville Banner Friday. ``You could hear me
coming.''
   Black, 27, has been nominated for three 1989 Country Music
Association awards, two for his hit record ``A Better Man'' and the
other for the Horizon Award honoring career advancement. The awards
ceremony is Oct. 9.

   Boxer Mike Tyson is trying to sell the
mountaintop mansion he once shared with actress Robin Givens for $8
million, an adviser for the heavyweight champ said.
   Tyson, who recently bought a house in Cleveland to be near his
promoter, Don King, moved to the small Somerset County borough in
March 1988, shortly after marrying Ms. Givens.
   They bought the five-bedroom, stone Victorian Gothic revival
mansion for $4.3 million and spent another $1.9 million acquiring
adjoining property, said Frank Petrozzo, a friend and financial
adviser to Tyson and resident of this borough 30 miles southwest of
Newark.
   Petrozzo said Tyson discussed selling the home after he and Ms.
Givens were divorced in June.
   Bernardsville Mayor Peter Palmer said that since Tyson's breakup
with Ms. Givens, he had not been spotted much in the area.
   ``The fact is, he's really already gone,'' Palmer said. ``Things
seemed to have been going quite well until whatever it was that
happened between him and Robin.''
