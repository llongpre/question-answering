   There were mobs of teen-agers, pounding
music and not enough toilets, but Pope John Paul II's World Youth
Day was far from your usual rock concert.
   The celebration _ which actually lasted most of the weekend _ was
intended as the highlight of a three-day papal visit to Spain that
ends today with Mass at a mountain shrine in the northern town of
Covadonga.
   On Sunday, the pontiff made his second call in five days for an
end to 14 years of sectarian fighting in Lebanon. He appeared to
refer to Syrian soldiers and Moslem militias when he said: ``It
seems that the intention is to destroy the city of Beirut, and in
particular, the zones inhabited by Christians.''
   His comments came at the end of a Mass at the Vatican-sponsored
4th World Youth Day celebrations near Santiago de Compostela.
Thousands of the estimated 400,000 participants from 55 countries
signed an appeal for peace in Lebanon that was to be sent to the
United Nations.
   The pope on Sunday also visited a cathedral in the northern
mining center of Oviedo and spoke at a Mass at a field outside the
city.
   World Youth Day marked one of the Roman Catholic Church's most
spectacular efforts ever to reach young people, featuring a
glittering show with long-haired rock singers and an audience in
blue jeans that clapped and danced. Most eventually camped out on
big rectangles of plastic covering the orange clay of Gozo Mountain.
   One participant from Chicago, 24-year-old John Kurt, noted that
Americans marked the 20th anniversary of the Woodstock concert in
the same week as the huge papal gathering at an ancient pilgrim site.
   ``People are going from dope to pope,'' he quipped.
   Indeed, many of those at the fourth World Youth Day celebrations
came for one reason: to see John Paul.
   ``He gives us such happiness, it's incredible,'' remarked Ramon
Verra, 16, of Mexico City.
   In his far-flung travels, the 69-year-old pope tries to use the
force of his personality to convince young people of the importance
of Catholic values _ especially such unpopular ones as chastity.
   But John Paul had nothing less in mind this weekend than
inspiring a ``new Christianization'' for Catholicism's third
milennium and its estimated 860 million followers worldwide.
   He reflected the church's increasing emphasis on young people as
protagonists in an effort to turn back secularization. John Paul
urged young people to hold Christian values rather than seeking
economic success, power or sexual gratification.
   The pope's message seemed popular with the crowd at Gozo
Mountain, which ranged from parish groups to conservative
political-religious organizations to students trying to strengthen
their religion.
   ``He tells it like it is,'' said Mary Sheehan, 23, of Washington.
   Vatican officials were trying to contact Lebanese leaders to
press John Paul's peace effort, but there were no announcements
Sunday about the pope's earlier offer to visit Lebanon.
   More than 750 people have been killed since fighting broke out
between the Syrian-led fighters and Christian troops in March.
   The pontiff's trip is his third to Spain and the 43rd foreign
voyage of his 11-year papacy.
