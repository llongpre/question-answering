Iron Butterfly never made it to the stage at Woodstock -- its helicopter 
couldn't land in the sea of humanity. But the band has been added to the "20 
Years After" festival being held nearly two decades to the day after Woodstock, 
Aug. 19-20 at the Cal State Dominguez Hills Velodrome. Woodstock vets Blood, 
Sweat &amp; Tears and Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company also have been 
added to a lineup that includes Richie Havens, John Sebastian, Country Joe 
McDonald, Canned Heat and Melanie. To enhance the mood, the event will feature 
a '60s-style arts and crafts fair with tie-dyed shirts and body painting.
