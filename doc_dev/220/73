<HEAD>Utility Chief Says Nuclear Managers Ignored Warning of Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Managers of a Maryland nuclear plant whose
performance has plummeted ignored warnings that complacency was
jeopardizing safety, the owner's chief executive told federal
regulators.
   George McGowan, chairman of Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., said he
had told supervisors at the Calvert Cliffs plant on Chesapeake Bay
that he saw ``a slippage setting in'' that threatened the plant's
reputation for efficiency and safety.
   ``I'm not so sure they believed what I had to say,'' McGowan on
Wednesday told members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   The NRC last December declared Calvert Cliffs one of the nation's
worst-run plants and intensified monitoring of its operations.
   The commissioners summoned McGowan and the utility's other top
officers to find out how Calvert Cliffs had fallen to the bottom of
the performance pile after long being considered one of the best-run
plants in the country.
   The plant's sudden fall from grace has raised new questions about
the NRC's ability to detect drops in plant performance levels before
serious accidents occur.
   Both of Calvert Cliffs' nuclear reactors were shut down last May
because of mechanical problems. A series of earlier mishaps at the
plant culminated in the accidental death last September of an
employee who drowned in a water storage tank.

<NOTE>Readers Tune Out Woodstock Anniversary</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans paid little attention to the
anniversary of Woodstock, but more than half closely followed news
stories about the airliner crash in Sioux City, Iowa, a survey says.
   The latest in a series of news indexes by the Times Mirror Center
for Press &amp; Public Policy, released Wednesday, indicated that 53
percent of respondents followed ``very closely'' the news reports
about the crash July 19 of the United Airlines DC-10, which killed
111 of the 296 on board.
   By contrast, 9 percent said they followed very closely the
stories about the anniversary of Woodstock, the upstate New York
rock festival that got under way 20 years ago Tuesday and is being
marked as a cultural milestone.
   The latest survey, conducted by the Gallup Organization Inc., was
done over a four-day period ending Sunday.
   The second-ranking story in the survey was the killing of Marine
Lt. Col. William Higgins by his Lebanese captors, with 49 percent
saying they followed it very closely.
   Third, with 26 percent, was the passage in Congress of
legislation to bail out failing savings and loan institutions.

<NOTE>Skinner Asks Action on Air Accident Treaty</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner is
asking the Senate to move swiftly to ratify a 14-year-old treaty
that would increase compensation for victims of international air
accidents.
   Skinner, in a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Wednesday, said the bombing last December of Pan American World
Airways Flight 103 ``serves to highlight the gross injustices that
exist'' because current treaty provisions limit compensation to
$75,000.
   The Senate has wrestled with the compensation question for more
than a decade.
   In 1975, the United States signed the so-called Montreal
Protocols to the Warsaw Convention, which would allow an increase in
compensation for international air accidents by establishing
supplemental compensation plans.
   While the Foreign Relations Committee twice has recommended the
Montreal Protocols be ratified, the Senate has failed to do so
because of criticism that proposed plans still did not provide for
enough compensation to international air travelers.
   Last year the Transportation Department offered a revised
supplemental compensation plan. It cast aside the proposed maximum
compensation of $317,000 and proposed an essentially unlimited
recovery plan per passenger that would be subject only to an overall
limit of $500 million per accident.
   The awards would come from a special fund established through a
$5 per passenger fee on round trip tickets for international air
travel.
   But the Senate never held hearings on the proposal before
adjourning.
