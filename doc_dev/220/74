A leader in the white supremacist movement hopes to host a two-day "White 
Power" rock festival on private land in Northern California next month, 
according to United Press International. Flyers that have turned up in some San 
Francisco Bay Area communities recently said the festival, billed as an "Aryan 
Woodstock," will feature at least four "skinhead" rock groups, with firearms 
among the door prizes. "It's simply going to be a gathering of like-minded 
people for music, relaxation and fun," said Tom Metzger, a former Ku Klux 
Klansman and founder of White Aryan Resistance. A message on the answering 
machine at Metzger's Fallbrook, Calif., organization said the festival would be 
the "first in a series of concert-rallies that will take place around the 
world." "This is a whites-only gathering," the taped message warned. "All you 
race mixers, stay home." The event supposedly will be on a private farm near 
Vallejo, although details were sketchy. Richard Hirschhaut, director of the 
local Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which studies white supremacists 
and other hate groups, said his group and others opposed to the neo-Nazis would 
hold a counter-demonstration near the proposed festival. SHAUNA SNOW
