To mark the 20th anniversary of Woodstock, KNX Radio (AM 1070) will broadcast a 
15-part series of reports Saturday and Sunday. "Woodstock: Generation of 
Change" will include a recap of events of that era, plus interviews with such 
performers as Richie Havens, John Sebastian and Graham Nash and with promoters 
and concert attendees. CBS News correspondents Harry Smith and Judy Muller will 
anchor the two-day schedule that starts Saturday at 8:41 a.m. with an overview 
of the events that led up to Woodstock. Sunday's schedule will start at 8:39 
a.m. with " '60s Hippies Turned '80s Conservatives." After Saturday's 8:41 a.m. 
and 9:41 a.m. broadcasts, the short reports will air at 39 minutes after each 
hour. ALEENE MacMINN
