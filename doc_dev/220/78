The critically praised band Metallica has (almost) given speed-metal rock a 
good name -- especially among video dealers, who have sold an astounding 
175,000 copies of the group's "$19.95 Home Vid: Cliff 'Em All." Those same 
video dealers -- along with fans -- will be happy to hear that June will bring 
another Metallica cassette from Elektra Entertainment: "Metallica: 2 of One," 
consisting of two versions of the song "One," one of them about 10 minutes and 
incorporating scenes from the film "Johnny Got His Gun."

<P>
If Metallica is a little too, uh, '80s for you, you might prefer this news: 
"Woodstock" is coming out on video June 28 (August marks the 20th anniversary 
of the festival). Warner will put out a letter-boxed version for $29.98 
(laserdisc, $39.98). Cable channels MTV and VH-1 will also be showing the film 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
"Rain Man" arrives Aug. 30 from MGM/UA with a Buick commercial attached but 
(uh-oh!) no price break for buyers ($89.95). Other coming releases: "Twins" 
(June 15), "The Accidental Tourist" (June 28), "Bird" (June 21), "Talk Radio" 
(July 13), "My Stepmother Is an Alien" (June 8), "Crusoe" (July 12), the Marx 
Brothers' first movie "The Cocoanuts" (July 13) and, turning back to music, 
"New Order: Substance" (June 6).

The Bargain Bin: "Beetlejuice," "Innerspace," "Barfly," "Dancers" and "The 
Mosquito Coast" will be reduced by Warner from the $80-$90 range to $19.98 on 
July 19.

The 1989 American Film Institute Video Festival will be held Oct. 26-29 in Los 
Angeles, and the deadline for submitting videos is June 1. Meanwhile, tonight 
AFI is hosting the L.A. premiere of "Motorist," a 70-minute video by Chip Lord 
(co-founder of Ant Farm). Information: (213) 856-7787.

Like to add a videodisc player to your home-tech equipment but you've been 
scared off by the high prices? Pioneer Electronics may have the answer -- it 
will soon be marketing the cheapest combination laserdisc/CD machine yet. The 
CLD-1070 retails for $600, which means it should sell for maybe $100 less when 
it reaches stores in the next few weeks.

MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
"Coming to America" (Paramount, no suggested retail price) came to video stores 
Wednesday with a soft-drink commercial. Eddie Murphy plays an African prince 
who chooses Queens, N. Y., to search for a bride. Arsenio Hall plays the 
prince's best friend. John Landis directed this R-rated 1988 comedy, which 
grossed about $130 million at America's theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The sexy "Stealing Heaven" (Virgin, $89.95) came to theaters very recently, but 
also arrived at video stores Wednesday -- in both its R-rated version and a 
more explicit unrated version. The Clive Donner-directed film concerns the 
legendary 12th-Century romance of Abelard and Heloise. 
</P>
<P>
Other new movies-on-tape, all from CBS/Fox: "Halloween 4: The Return of Michael 
Myers" ($89.98, 1988, R), "The Other" ($59.98, 1972, PG), "Spellbinder" 
($79.98, 1988, R).
