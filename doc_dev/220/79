<LEADPARA>  IN A business where foul-ups are accepted as inevitable, Bill Graham was the
guy who bridged continents and made sure the doves flew on time -- no matter
what. The peerless 60-year-old rock 'n' roll impresario, who died along with
two others in a helicopter crash Friday night, approached his craft the way
NASA engineers approach rocket launches -- with absolute zero-tolerance for
mistakes. But unlike the engineers, his larger-than-life accomplishments were
often powered by sheer force of will. If Graham were running NASA and a rocket
was stalled, he would probably walk out on the launch pad and scream at it
until it flew. And if Graham were running the show it would fly.;   Of all the
stories from his 25 years as pop music's top concert promoter, here are two
that sum up what Bill Graham was about:  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In 1976, Graham staged the Last Waltz, a mammoth project that included
putting more than a dozen of the pop world's biggest stars on the same small
stage on the same night, feeding 5,000 people Thanksgiving dinner, making a
movie and a live three-record album. The story goes that when a reporter
pointed out that the apple juice was still frozen, Graham went berserk and had
the man ejected. The apple juice was the only glitch of the night.;   In 1987,
Graham staged a massive concert in Moscow, the likes of which the Soviet
bureaucracy had never imagined possible. When told that the 200 doves
scheduled to be released at the end of the program would be asleep, Graham
reportedly said, "We will adjust our schedule to accommodate the lifestyle of
the doves." Schedules were changed. The doves flew on time. When Soviet
soldiers in blue warm-up suits massed in front of the stage with just an hour
to go before the concert, Graham demanded they be moved immediately. When they
were not, he told his stage manager to pull the plug. Five minutes before the
show, the soldiers were moved. Graham had called the Red Army's bluff and
won.;   GRAHAM'S legacy was twofold: He conceived concerts on a scale that
dwarfed anything that had come before, and he set quality standards for a
business that had been run mostly by amateurs and fly-by-nights. Graham was
the first promoter to understand that the concert experience was more than
just music. Through his standards for security, sound and lights, on-time
performance, parking and a thousand other details, he developed a
service-driven company decades before that term became a buzzword. And a
decade before Lee Iacocca and other top executives entered the public eye,
Graham pursued front-line management in his own inimitable, confrontational
style. Even in recent years it was not uncommon to see him supervising the
installation of portable toilets or arguing with angry customers.;   Graham
didn't nosh at the table of commerce -- he devoured it, pursuing everything
from T-shirt merchandising and nightclub operations to personal management and
film production. But his reputation as a ruthless competitor was balanced by
his penchant for benefits. From the very beginning of his career (a benefit
for the San Francisco Mime Troupe) to the very end (he was to begin work today
on a benefit for victims of the Oakland hills fire), Graham almost never met a
good cause he couldn't help.;   Graham produced a set of historic concerts --
mammoth in either scale or significance -- that will probably never be
matched. His greatest hits included:;   The Fillmore Auditorium, 1966-68: More
than 300 concerts that established San Francisco as the epicenter of the
psychedelic-rock revolution. Using innovative, often downright weird sound and
light technology, Graham's shows by the Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead,
Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana and Big Brother and the Holding Company were
unlike any that came before or after. Otis Redding's performances in December
1966 and Hendrix's concerts after the Monterey Pop Festival in '67 are
mentioned often as possibly the best live shows the artists performed.;   The
Acid Tests and the Trips Festival, 1966: Although these multimedia events at
the dawn of the hippie era were mostly the work of Ken Kesey and his Merry
Pranksters, Graham was involved in the running of most of them. They were not
mass events on the scale Graham would soon undertake, but their importance to
the spread of psychedelic culture can't be overstated.;   Janis Joplin with
Big Brother and the Holding Company, Albert King and Tim Buckley, the Fillmore
East, March 8, 1968: This was the first concert in the club that would become
as important to the New York City scene as its western counterpart was to San
Francisco's. The 2,800-seat hall was the place for cutting-edge music,
overshadowing everything else in Greenwich Village and frequently competing
even with Madison Square Garden. Graham closed both Fillmores in '71, citing
increased operating expenses and outrageous financial demands on the part of
bands and talent managers.;   The Watkins Glen Summer Jam, July 28, 1973:
Graham pulled off what had been considered impossible in the post-Woodstock,
post-Altamont age -- a massive outdoor show. This concert featuring the
Grateful Dead, the Band and the Allman Brothers set a one-day attendance
record that still stands: 600,000-plus. (The 1983 US festival drew 725,000
over several days.);   The Bob Dylan tour, Spring 1974: Dylan, in a move that
stretched logistics to the absolute limit, decided to perform indoor shows
only. Nevertheless, he played to 650,000 people in seven weeks, a major
triumph for tour-producer Graham.;   The S.N.A.C.K. Concert, March 23, 1975:
This youth benefit at San Francisco's outdated Kezar Stadium (the acronym
stood for Students Need Activities, Culture and Kicks) was another triumph
over tremendous logistical obstacles. The show featured Tower of Power,
Santana, Joan Baez, the Grateful Dead, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, the Starship
and, curiously, Willie Mays and Marlon Brando.;   The Last Waltz, Nov. 25,
1976: Almost universally revered as one of the greatest collections of rock
talent ever to be assembled on one stage. The Thanksgiving feast-and-farewell
show for the Band, held at San Francisco's Winterland, featured: Bob Dylan,
Van Morrison, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Neil Diamond, Muddy Waters, Ronnie
Hawkins and many others.;   The Rolling Stones tours, 1981-82: The European
and American concerts were the most lavish and technically ambitious
productions ever put on the road. Also, they represented a triumphant comeback
of sorts for the Stones, who had spent most of the previous decade in an
artistic holding pattern.;   The US Festival, September 1982: The series of
three concerts staged in Glen Helen Regional Park near San Bernardino over the
Labor Day weekend was an attempt by Apple Computer co-founder Steve Wozniak
and others to integrate technology, art and top-flight rock music in a sort of
community festival celebrating the ascendance of a new, less-selfish
generation. Philosophy aside, the shows, featuring the Police, the Talking
Heads, Tom Petty, Santana, Fleetwood Mac, the Grateful Dead and a dozen other
top acts were among the few mass gatherings of the decade to go off relatively
trouble-free. The following year, the Unuson group put on a second and final
US Festival without Graham. It was not nearly as successful as the first and
was plagued by transportation, crowd-control and financial problems.;   Live
Aid, July 13, 1985: Another logistical first for Graham, who coordinated the
American half of this bi-continental 40-band fund-raiser for African famine
relief. Graham's segment at Philadelphia's JFK Stadium (staged simultaneously
with another segment in London's Wembley Stadium) went perfectly. The 14-hour
show, which depended on split-second timing and a video link across the
Atlantic, ran three minutes over schedule.;   The Conspiracy of Hope Tour,
1986, and the Human Rights Now Tour, 1988: These benefits for Amnesty
International were testaments to Graham's ability to package eclectic acts.
The opening concert of the six-city '86 tour, at the Cow Palace, featured U2,
Sting, the Neville Brothers, Jackson Browne, Joan Baez and Lou Reed and was
widely acclaimed as one of the best Bay Area concerts of the decade.;   The
Peace Concert, July 4, 1987: This outdoor mega-show for 25,000 fans in a
Moscow stadium was probably the crown jewel for Graham, who had tried (and
failed) to persuade Soviet officials to allow a similar project nine years
earlier. After the concert (the first American-Soviet joint rock event),
Graham would liken the achievement to "going to the moon." At times, the
atmosphere in Moscow probably seemed as daunting as that of the moon. Graham
triumphed over seemingly insurmountable language and transportation barriers,
telecommunications problems and entrenched layers of Soviet bureaucracy to
stage the show -- which featured James Taylor, the Doobie Brothers, Bonnie
Raitt, Carlos Santana and four top Soviet acts.;   "It's like World War II
when soldiers wore hash marks for where they'd been," Graham told Mercury News
music writer Harry Sumrall, who had accompanied him on the trip. "In 20 years
of doing this sort of thing, I've had a few of those hash marks, but this
concert is a mark of its own, on my heart and soul," said Graham, whose long
tour of duty made its own mark on millions of hearts and souls.  </TEXT>
