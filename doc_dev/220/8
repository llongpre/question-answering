   Pop singer Melanie, who appeared at the
Woodstock rock festival here 20 years ago, gave a repeat performance
Saturday for about 10,000 people who came to commemorate the epic
event.
   ``Twice in one lifetime, what more could you want?'' Melanie, 42,
asked the audience during her 45-minute appearance at the farm once
owned by the late Max Yasgur.
   The crowd had been waiting all week for a performance by a
musician who appeared at the original Aug. 15-17, 1969, Woodstock
Music and Art Festival, which drew more than 400,000 young people.
   Sporadic showers sent thousands scurrying for cover, and some
left. Rain turned the original Woodstock into a muddy mess, but
concertgoers two decades ago endured it to hear and see their idols.
   Melanie, whose full name is Melanie Safka, sang from a makeshift
stage Saturday. She appeared the night before at a show billed as a
Woodstock reunion concert being held at a Catskill Mountains hotel.
   But the last of the three-day ``Remember Woodstock'' concerts at
the resort, which featured such Woodstock veterans as John Sebastian
and Johnny Winter, was canceled Saturday after drawing less than 400
people in two days.
   ``I think she (Melanie) wanted to be here because the vibes are
here,'' said Will Hoppey, who was helping coordinate this weekend's
entertainment at the original Woodstock site.
   ``This is where it's happening,'' he said.
   Until Melanie's performance, the closest thing at the original
site to a 1969 performer was Al Hendrix, father of late guitarist
Jimi Hendrix. Al Hendrix appeared Friday and signed autographs,
Hoppey said.
   An estimated 20,000 people converged on the site Friday night.
The celebration has attracted old hippies, their younger
counterparts, college kids and the curious.
   ``I'm fascinated by it,'' Walt Helhowski of West Milford, N.J.,
said as he videotaped the event. Helhowski, 55, and his wife had
planned a camping vacation at Swan Lake months ago, unaware of its
close proximity to Woodstock.
   Tess Tenbus, 32, who grew up 15 miles away, was selling copies of
newspaper articles detailing the events of 20 years ago. One copy, a
front-page blowup of the Aug. 17, 1969, Daily News of New York was a
reminder of what could happen if the rains continue.
   ``Hippies Mired in Sea of Mud,'' read the tabloid's headline.
   One thing different from the original concert, other than its
size, was the overall lack of garbage.
   ``Everyone is picking up their trash,'' said Tenbus.
