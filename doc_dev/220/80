   The 1980s was a time of little experimentation or adventure in
mainstream pop music. But rap came into its own, as did ethnic
music from around the world. Folk-rock also re-emerged after taking
a siesta during the '70s.
   Here is an alphabetical list of 20 top albums of the '80s, as
compiled by the editors of The Associated Press:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION,'' Guns N' Roses@ _ Heavy metal with
   something to offend everyone.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``BORN IN THE USA,'' Bruce Springsteen@ _ Patriotism and
rebellion from the promised land.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``CAN'T SLOW DOWN,'' Lionel Richie@ _ Every track 
easy-listening hit for lovers and dancing.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``CENTERFIELD,'' John Fogerty@ _ Old time rock 'n' roll from
the force behind Creedence Clearwater Revival.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``GET HAPPY,'' Elvis Costello@ _ A year after his notorious
racial slurs against Ray Charles, Costello's tribute to soul music,
and it's a winner in every way.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``GRACELAND,'' Paul Simon@ _ Grace and beauty from the land of
apartheid, and a showcase for African music and musicians. The
album by one of our most enduring artists heralded the
international sound of the '90s.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``IT TAKES A NATION OF MILLIONS TO HOLD US BACK,'' Public
Enemy@ _ Rappers pushed over the edge. A tough, rhythmic and
political sound that galvanizes.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``LONDON CALLING,'' Clash@ _ The purest punk sound of the '80s
with a classy hardness.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``MAKING MOVIES,'' Dire Straits@ _ AOR guitar flash. Great
innovations and great sounds.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``NEW YORK,'' Lou Reed@ _ A soundtrack of the meanest streets.
It's tough, real rock.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``PICTURE BOOK,'' Simply Red@ _ A remarkable debut LP from a
hot pop, rock, jazz, reggae crew; ``Holding Back the Years'' is a
classic.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``PONTIAC,'' Lyle Lovett@ _ A magnificent mix of songs _ from
high drama to low comedy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``PURPLE RAIN,'' ``1999'' and ``SIGN 'O' THE TIMES,'' Prince@ _
If Jimi Hendrix had lived, there'd be dueling guitars with Prince.
All three are winners from one of the most creative forces in rock.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``RAPTURE,'' Anita Baker@ _ Languid rhythm and blues with jazz
as a bonus made her the flavor of the month for a long, long time.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``REMAIN IN LIGHT,'' Talking Heads@ _ Adrian Belew's guitar
work alone earns it a spot in any Top 20.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

with quite a beat.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``SYNCHRONICITY,'' The Police@ _ World music and personal
anguish with excellent arrangements and performances.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THRILLER,'' Michael Jackson@ _ A shot heard 'round the world;
even MTV couldn't resist.

<TEXT>
``TRACY CHAPMAN,'' Tracy Chapman@ _ Big ideas softly spoken.
Stirring songs of love and social conscience for a distinctive new
voice and original songwriter.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``WAR'' and ``THE JOSHUA TREE,'' U2@ _ On those rare occasions
when the radio sounds as good as in the '60s, U2 is usually the
reason. Wouldn't they have been great at Woodstock?
