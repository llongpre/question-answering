   Napa County supervisors voted Tuesday to seek
a court order halting a so-called ``Aryan Woodstock,'' an outdoor
concert on private land planned for Saturday by white supremacists
and skinheads.
   After an emotional hearing attended by about 150 people, the
board decided to ask county District Attorney Jerry Mautner to seek
a temporary restraining order blocking the event.
   Mautner's office said the district attorney may seek the order as
early as Wednesday.
   Tom Metzger, director of the White Aryan Resistance, told the
board the event would be on private land and would be by invitation
only. He said some 2,000 people have been invited to listen to such
bands as the Boot Boys and Hammerhead.
   The issue, he said, is simple: ``Shall we have freedom of speech
and assembly or shall we not?''
   Choking back tears, Golda Lerman of Napa told the board she lost
much of her family to the Nazi Holocaust of World War II.
   ``I grew up with the legacy you people caused,'' she said,
referring to the concert sponsors. ``I have no aunts, no uncles.
   ``I believe in the freedom of speech and the right to assembly,
but not the right to violence against minorities,'' she said.
   Legal opposition to the concert is based on a rarely-used 1971
county ordinance requiring a permit for outdoor concerts. No permit
has been issued for Saturday's event.
   The concert is set to be held on a 70-acre private ranch being
leased from Dr. Howard Lonsdale, a prominent physician in nearby
Vallejo. He has declined comment on the event, and his receptionist
said he ``doesn't want to be bothered about this issue.''
   Sheriff's spokesman John Volpe said a stage is under construction
at the concert site, which he said was ideal for such an event
because it's out of the way and the noise will not disturb anyone.
   ``It's just another day in the battle,'' said Metzger. ``We just
go from one step to another.
   ``If you block (such events) from private land, where else is
there but the streets?'' he said, adding that he dislikes marches.
   ``But what alternatives do you give people?'' Metzger asked.
``We're going to have some speeches, we're going to have some music,
and we're going to go home.''
