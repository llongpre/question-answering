<TEXT>     These aren't rock shows; they are rock 'n' roll spectaculars. The first,
Tribes (on Sunday) has 11 acts. Operation Rock (July 14) has five. And
Lollapalooza (July 26 and 27) has seven. Great. Fantastic. The rock consumers
are finally getting their money's worth, right?;    Well, yes. But don't start
thinking that those old softies in the music biz are doing you any favors.
They're stuck at the moment with a concert season that is only a feather or
two short of being a real turkey. Attendance and revenues are down; big acts
like Bruce Springsteen and Prince are staying away in droves. To counter this,
the promoters and agents have come up with the touring festival to entice the
concertgoers.;    But of all these festivals, one is different. It wasn't born
of financial desperation; it isn't a marketing trick. It is a different
concert animal, one that has its roots in -- what was that word again? --
idealism.;    That festival is Tribes.;    While there is about the others
that faint smell of crinkled greenbacks, Tribes comes with the sweet aroma of
Flower Power, of that time in the '60s when music was a unifying force.;   
That was the purpose of the first Tribes, which was staged in Mountain View
and Los Angeles last year. Tribes founder Ian Astbury of the Cult attempted to
prove that music fans of all colors and aesthetic stripes would gather to hear
the vast and varied array of the pop of the day.;    With the ingeniousness
and intrepidity of a '60s shaker, he invited the folkies of Indigo Girls to
share a stage with the rappers of Public Enemy and the rockers of the
Charlatans and on and on. And on the Shoreline grounds that day, there were
exhibits of art (most of it crummy, but that's beside the point) and street
performers and stands where social activists paraded their ideas and ideals.
It was a wonderful event, not because of the individual groups or other
participants, but because of the idea Astbury was promulgating: that openness
to new and different ideas and music could be a possibility; that people could
be unified in their differences instead of being separated by them.;    "It's
amazing that it worked at all," Astbury enthused backstage that day.;    Now,
Tribes is back. This show's lineup is as varied and vibrant as that of the
original. There is the roots rock of X and the '60s rock of the Mighty Lemon
Drops; the rap of Yo-Yo and the thrash punk of Primus. The rest reads like a
handy catchall of today's pop: Hoodoo Gurus, King's X, EPMD, John Wesley
Harding, Fishbone and Steve Earle.;    People who come to this show have to be
open-minded -- or they will be once they've heard it all.;    And like the
original, the fans will be confronted with issues as well as sounds. Activist
groups like Amnesty International, Greenpeace, Rock The Vote and hosts of
others will be on hand to make fans think as well as listen.;    No one has
to, but they'll have the opportunity if they want it.;    Yes, the business
types have gotten involved. Tribes is no longer a unique event, it's a tour
like all the rest now. And it's true that, individually, none of these acts
could draw nearly as many fans as they can collectively. And while Astbury has
given this tour his blessing, he's no longer involved (there's a new Cult
album to be worked on).;    But Tribes is infused with his message: no matter
how commercial and demographed and segregated the rock scene is at the moment,
rock fans can be open to new sounds and to new creative experiences if they
are given the opportunity.  </TEXT>
