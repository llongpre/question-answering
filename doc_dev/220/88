   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it settled charges of commodity fraud by accepting an agreement that includes $490,000 in fines against Woodstock Inc., a now-defunct New York commodity firm. 

   Eight men, including seven former Woodstock officials, also were charged by the CFTC with commodity-law violations, and two of those officials agreed to settlements involving combined penalties of $62,500, the regulatory agency said. 

   Kenneth Grossfeld, former manager of the company's Miami Beach, Fla., branch office, agreed to pay a $52,500 fine, and Ronald Sciepko, a former Woodstock vice president, agreed to a $10,000 penalty. 
The company and Messrs. 
Grossfeld and Sciepko agreed to the settlements without admitting or denying guilt regarding the commission's allegations. 

   In addition to the fines, the company agreed to refrain from any such violations of commodities law. 
In one case, Woodstock was charged with fraud in soliciting trades and with excessive trading in accounts at its Miami Beach branch office, along with unauthorized trading, filing false reports with the CFTC, and failing to adequately supervise the Miami Beach operation. 

   Mr. Grossfeld agreed to a six-month trading ban; to refrain from handling managed accounts for 18 months; a 30-day suspension of his current commodity-brokerage registration; and to refrain from future violations. 
He was charged with fraud in making misleading oral representations to customers, excessive trading, unauthorized trading and failing to supervise sales solicitations of the Miami Beach office employees. 
Mr. Grossfeld, of Miami, couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Mr. Sciepko, a former Chicago vice president of Woodstock, was charged with failing to properly supervise the Miami Beach office. 
He agreed to cease and desist from such violations. 
Mr. Sciepko, Winnetka, Ill., declined to comment. 

   Two former account executives in Woodstock's Miami Beach office, Mitchell J. Deckelbaum and Robert Rymar, were charged with making misleading oral representations to customers. 
Mr. Deckelbaum couldn't be reached; Mr. Rymar declined comment. 

   In a separate case, the CFTC charged the company with fraudently allocating trades from an account of a North Carolina savings and loan association to the personal account of Ricky Reynolds, a former officer of the association. 

   Also charged with trade-allocation fraud in the case were J.C. Pentecoste, a former Woodstock Chicago-branch account executive; James O'Connell, a former independent floor broker on the Chicago Board of Trade who had been Woodstock floor manager at that exchange; and Mr. Reynolds. 

   Mr. Reynolds also was charged with fraud in conducting unauthorized trading in a commodity-futures account he set up for the S&amp;L without its knowledge. 
Accounts he established for the firm took losses in commodity trading, which forced the association into receivership, the CFTC said. 

   Mr. O'Connell also was charged with failing to register as a floor broker and with trading after the market closed. 
As part of the case, the company also was charged with failing to time-stamp office orders properly, and with failing to adequately supervise the Chicago branch office and the Woodstock floor operation at the Board of Trade. 

   Donald Voigt, former manager of the company's Chicago office, was charged with failing to supervise the office properly. 

   Messrs. 
Reynolds, Pentecoste, O'Connell and Voigt couldn't be reached.
