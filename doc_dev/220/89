   Rock music fans in upstate New York may
soon be finding their heroes in a decidedly unusual place _ the
Ulster County Legislature.
   John Hall, formerly of the 1970s pop group Orleans, and Ed
Sanders, of the 1960s satirical band the Fugs, will both be watching
ballot boxes instead of musical charts this November.
   ``Why should California be the only area of the country with
celebrities (in politics) like Clint Eastwood and Sonny Bono,'' said
Rich Mathews, chairman of the county Legislature.
   Democrats Hall and Sanders are attending zoning meetings, shaking
hands and going door-to-door to meet voters in the generally staid
Republican county about 100 miles north of New York City.
   Politics aren't new to either man, but their previous experiences
were a tad different.
   Hall, with his wife, Johanna, was the author of Top 10 hits
``Still the One'' and ``Dance With Me'' in the mid-'70s. With fellow
artists Jackson Browne and Graham Nash, he organized the
anti-nuclear Musicians United for Safe Energy benefit concerts in
Madison Square Garden 10 years ago.
   Sanders' band was known more for its antics than its music. The
Fugs satirized sex and politics with profane shows. Sanders authored
a best-selling book on Charles Manson and once published a literary
magazine with an obscene title.
   They got into local politics for the same reason: the county's
plan to consolidate 15 landfills into a huge trash-burning facility
about four miles from Hall's home in Saugerties.
   ``I tend to have all these grandiose plans, wanting to stop
nuclear power and things like that,'' Hall said. ``It's kind of
ironic that a dump and an incinerator would get me involved in
this.''
   The balding, 41-year-old singer-songwriter wore a ``stop the
dump'' T-shirt to a recent interview. Talking at length of the
intricate inner workings of local politics, he joked that he and his
wife were planning to celebrate their 20th anniversary by crashing a
closed Republican caucus.
   After initially rejecting the town committee's request to run for
office, Hall changed his mind, figuring it would give him another
platform to campaign against the dump.
   Hall dismisses talk that his pop music background could hinder
his political career.
   ``I suppose some people might think that musicians are frivolous
or that artists of any kind are less substantial people than the
lawyers and accountants who make up the political mainstream,'' he
said. ``I don't think that's true, and I think my involvement in
issues concerning Saugerties for the last 10 years shows that.''
   Hall is one of six people running for four open seats in his
district. Saugerties is Republican territory, but Hall's name
recognition and local anger over the proposed incinerator give him a
better than even chance of winning, said Republican leader Mathews.
   It also doesn't hurt when an old friend such as Bonnie Raitt
comes in for a fund-raising concert. Hall now has nearly $20,000 for
himself and other Democratic candidates.
   ``What can I do?'' quipped Mathews about having to counter
appearances by famous rock stars. ``I can play the radio.''
   Sanders' background has attracted more attention. One of the
Fugs' better-known antics was unsuccessfully trying to enter
Czechoslovakia to masturbate in front of invading Soviet tanks,
according to the Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll.
   Russell Roefs, Sanders' opponent, has run radio advertisements
noting that he was fighting in Vietnam at the same time Sanders was
demonstrating against the war and being arrested for distributing
obscene literature. The charges were later dropped.
   At a time in which Judge Douglas Ginsburg's U.S. Supreme Court
nomination was scuttled because of past marijuana experimentation, a
politician's history is fair game, Roefs said.
   ``A person's background usually predicts his views for his entire
life,'' Roefs said. ``I can't believe that we have people in this
society that constantly change and become good guys and bad guys
overnight.''
   Sanders said he's 50 years old now and mainstream enough to get
federal grants for poetry during the Reagan administration. He said
he's always voted as a Democrat.
   ``I've always been an American,'' Sanders said. ``I'm proud of
it. It's just that I could not support the war in Vietnam.''
   Some of his satirical work would be considered tame today, he
said.
   ``Go listen to Rodney Dangerfield, go to a George Carlin
concert,'' Sanders said. ``What I did in my wild youth is nothing
compared to what you can hear at a Catskills resort.''
   Sanders won an early test in September by finishing first in a
three-way Democratic primary. His task in the general election is
generally considered tougher, even though his district includes the
artsy enclave of Woodstock.
   Both Sanders and Hall are trying to crack a 33-member Legislature
that has 28 Republicans.
   Hall still performs music, but he has no record contract. He and
his wife concentrate on writing songs for country artists such as
Juice Newton, Chet Atkins, the Oak Ridge Boys and others.
   He still earns about $20,000 a year in royalties for each of his
two hit songs and is constantly considering offers to use the songs
in commercial endorsements. That makes it easier to swallow the
$8,000 annual salary of an Ulster County legislator.
   ``My main job for the last year and a half has been community
organizing,'' Hall said. ``I've spent many more hours working on
zoning and illegal junkyards than I have writing and performing.''
   As for political ambitions beyond the Ulster County Legislature,
he said, ``It's really too early to speculate about that. First I've
got to get elected and stop the dump.''
