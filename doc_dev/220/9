   Twenty years ago today 400,000 people
descended on Max Yasgur's farm for a giant celebration of music and
youth, but residents near the site of the rock festival say this
time they're being invaded by reporters.
   ``Swedish national radio just interviewed me,'' said Arthur
Schubert, 62, who worked as a security officer at the festival.
``That makes Hong Kong, Brazil, London and some guy from Germany,
too, today. That doesn't even count the Americans.''
   Schubert is doing media relations for a Woodstock reunion
festival this weekend in nearby Swan Lake, and reporters made up a
big part of the crowd at the Woodstock site in upstate New York.
   Besides reporters, about 200 people were camping at the site,
Sullivan County sheriff's deputy Paul Pratti said Monday.
   Campers strummed guitars, bought food from vendors and watched
movies on videocassette recorders powered by portable generators.
   Police were expecting more people to arrive through the rest of
the week in the town of about 3,000, but not too many, County
Sheriff Joseph Wasser said.
   ``It's not like we're expecting an onslaught,'' Wasser said.
   The Aug. 15-17, 1969, concert is seen by many as marking the peak
of a decade of social change in the United States. The crowd
gathered at the site since Saturday included some original
festival-goers and others not even born then.
   The weather was the same as 20 years ago _ rainy _ as were
conditions on the field now owned by Charley and Debbie Gelish _
muddy.
   While Bethel is planning no official remembrance on Woodstock's
20th anniversary, the Imperial resort hotel in Swan Lake is staging
a ``Remember Woodstock'' concert Thursday to Saturday featuring such
Woodstock alumni as Melanie and John Sebastian.
