<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; SHOW; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  PERRY Farrell sits in the headquarters of a Los Angeles record company,
touting his latest venture with the exuberance of a child. As lead singer for
the notorious post-modernist rock band Jane's Addiction, Farrell has raised
eyebrows with his dabblings inmysticism, and for advocating drug use and
casual sex.;    But the source of Farrell's delirium nowadays isn't some
consciousness-expanding substance or unconventional religion. Rather it's
Lollapalooza, an ambitious concert tour that's scheduled to hit 21 North
American cities by summer's end. The show rolls into Shoreline Amphitheater in
Mountain View today and Saturday. Today's show is sold out; a few reserved
tickets and lawn seating are still available for the Saturday show.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I'm so jazzed, I'm clean," the singer says, jokingly suggesting that
coordinating Lollapalooza has replaced psychedelics as his preferred drug.;   
If the singer and the tour's other organizers are successful, they just might
make the history books. Farrell says he hopes Lollapalooza will be the event
that awakens today's youth from an apathetic slumber.;    Lollapalooza
attempts to compress all of Woodstock's good intentions into a daylong
concert. Aside from headliners Jane's Addiction, the bill features Siouxsie
and the Banshees, Living Colour, Nine Inch Nails, Ice-T, the Butthole Surfers
and the Rollins Band. Also featured at the Shoreline show will be local bands
playing on a side stage and displays from local artists. There will be a
head-shaving booth, and information booths where environmental, governmental
and human rights groups will distribute their literature.;    "I think you're
going to see a youth movement in America. All of a sudden things are going to
accelerate," Farrell says when asked what he hopes Lollapalooza will
accomplish.;    "It will be nice to see kids coming to a facility not just to
get the art exposure, but also to be informed about important things like
environmental issues," says Don Muller, a booking agent who helped coordinate
Lollapalooza.;    "It isn't just national organizations we're dealing with
here. We'll be trying to get kids to pay attention to regional environmental
issues, too. It's not like we're going completely one wing or the other. We
just want to give people a choice.";    Of course, Lollapalooza isn't the
first time musicians have sought to bring about world peace through rock 'n'
roll. The No Nukes concerts of the late 1970s brought acts like Bruce
Springsteen and Jackson Browne together to heighten awareness about the
potential hazards of nuclear power.;    A few years later, Apple Computer
wunderkind Steve Wozniak sponsored the US Festivals. The loosely coordinated
shows promoted racial harmony through concert bills featuring rock, pop and
R&amp;B acts.;    Just last year a multi-act, politically oriented event dubbed
Gathering of the Tribes attracted moderate-size crowds in San Francisco and
Los Angeles. But when promoters tried to take the concert nationwide this
summer, turnout was so poor that the jaunt was canceled. (At the tour's Bay
Area stop, July 7 at Shoreline, just about 7,500 showed at the 20,000-seat
venue.);    The failure of the US and Gathering of Tribes tours would prompt
skeptics to look askance at Lollapalooza. But Farrell insists "skepticism is a
thing of the past" where his show is concerned.;    "If anyone's skeptical,
it's because of jealousy," says Farrell. "I think people have lost all the
skepticism about this. We're selling out just about every place we play.";   
Though Farrell is exaggerating slightly, his point is well taken. Lollapalooza
shows have sold out in Orange County, San Diego, Detroit and Boston.;    Marc
Geiger, a Triad Artists booking agent, helped organize Lollapalooza. He says
there is a difference between Lollapalooza and the ill-fated Gathering of the
Tribes tour.;    "The difference is that one of the festivals pulled it off,
and one didn't," says Geiger. "The key is in the executing.";    Geiger's
execution began at last year's Redding Festival in Britain. Jane's Addiction
was scheduled to perform, but was forced to cancel after Farrell came down
with laryngitis.;    But Geiger and Muller attended the Redding Festival
anyway, and were impressed by the size of the crowd and the ambiance of the
event.;    "There were 40,000 kids going crazy over the Pixies," says Geiger,
referring to a popular alternative-rock band. "The kids weren't being hassled,
and everybody was having the time of their lives.";    The two booking agents
asked Farrell to draw up a blueprint for a fantastic festival of his own. The
singer jumped at the chance, challenging Geiger and Muller to realize his
wackiest concepts.;    "I'd call someone at 3 in the morning and say 'I want
helium balloons surrounding the crowd,"' recalls Farrell. "I'd say things like
'We need Lollapalooza-sized burritos served in buckets, with buckets of
Sprite.' It all had to be different.";    Whether Farrell is successful in
ushering in a new era of political awareness, creativity and racial concord
remains to be seen. But the singer is optimistic.;    "We're bringing the
museum to the kids, and one of the things I'm confident will happen is that
young artists are going to become superstars," says Farrell. "Sometimes you
just get a vibe that something's going to happen. That's the vibe I get about
this.";     Lollapalooza Festival; Jane's Addiction, Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees,
