   Skinheads and white supremacists refused to
back down from a rally on a private ranch today, but they abandoned
plans for a whites-only ``Aryan Woodstock'' rock concert that a
judge said required a permit.
   ``We can sing, we just can't play instruments,'' said Bob Heick,
the San Francisco head of a white supremacist group called American
Front who represented concert organizers in court Friday.
   ``I'm not angry,'' he said. ``I expected this, obviously.''
   Napa County Superior Court Judge W. Scott Snowden, describing the
issue as ``politically and emotionally charged,'' deemed the event a
public gathering. He issued a restraining order prohibiting the
concert because organizers had failed to obtain a permit required by
county ordinance.
   But Snowden allowed a public gathering, rejecting the county's
argument that the assembly would be a public nuisance and saying it
``demonstrated no clear and present danger to the public.''
   Six skinheads linked arms around Heick and escorted him out of
the courthouse, using lighted cigarettes to make their way through a
throng of reporters. Heick vowed to ``get a concert going''
elsewhere.
   Leaders of the groups said they would gather today to party and
discuss their ``white liberation movement.'' The site is a private
ranch about 40 miles north of San Francisco.
   The physican who owns the land and leased it for the gathering
said he was told the meeting was to be about environmental concerns.
   The skinhead subculture and style of dress emerged in London in
the 1960s. Segments of the movement later took on Nazi overtones and
since have been associated with the white supremacist groups.
   County attorney Robert Westmeyer said the ruling didn't surprise
him, adding that it might prompt the county Board of Supervisors to
change the law.
   ``I think (they) may consider revising the ordinance to apply to
large public gatherings, rather than just rock concerts,'' he said.
   Before the hearing, an NAACP official warned that the gathering
was an effort to win support for an unpopular cause which advocates
racial violence.
   However, Regional Director James L. Martin said the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People would not
``dignify the existence of this group or their planned event with
our presence tommorrow.''
   ``We can ignore a rock concert by skinheads, but we cannot ignore
what they represent in terms of potential danger,'' he added.
   The Jewish Defense League and the anti-crime Guardian Angels
civilian patrol group indicated they would demonstrate at the rally.
   Heick, who sports 16 tattoos, including SKINS inked inside his
lower lip, said during Friday's hearing that, ``Our intention was to
comply with the law.'' He said a check with the county some time ago
indicated no permit was needed.
   ``In no way would we want a public event,'' he said. ``We wanted
to keep out of people's way, where we could all be alone and have a
little party.''
   The concert was to feature skinhead bands Midtown Boot Boys from
Oklahoma, the Hammerheads from Wisconsin and Hakenkreuz from Detroit.
   Organizer Tom Metzger, a former Ku Klux Klan leader and currently
head of a group called White Aryan Resistance, argued earlier that
since the concert was to be held on private property and admission
was by invitation only, no permit was needed.
   Although Metzger earlier had predicted as many as 2,000 people
might attend the concert, Heick on Friday said he expected about 200
attendees.
