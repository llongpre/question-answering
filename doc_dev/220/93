   Paul McCartney sang old Beatles
hits for 130,000 fans jammed into Rio's Maracana soccer stadium
Saturday to end a scheduled 33-city tour.
   McCartney performed a number of his own songs, before launching
into ``The Long and Winding Road'' and ``Hey Jude.'' Fans lit
cigarette lighters, cheered wildly, and sang along in ecstasy as
McCartney performed.
   The huge crowd was described as the largest ever to see a
McCartney concert, breaking the previous mark of 80,000. Some
60,000 Brazilians saw McCartney's first Rio show Friday night,
which was marred by heavy rains.
   The show cost $2.9 million, and featured a 100-foot-long stage
packed with more than 20 truckloads of sound equipment, a huge
screen where Beatles scenes and parts of the concert were shown,
and sophisticated laser cannons.
   McCartney said Friday he might extend the tour to Liverpool,
England, in May.

   Flash! A bulletin crackles over Dick
Tracy's two-way wrist radio: ``Dick Tracy is coming home.''
   The chisel-chinned cartoon character and radio message will go
up next week on billboards around this northern Illinois community,
advertising a special premier of the ``Dick Tracy'' movie in the
hometown of the character's creator, Chester Gould.
   On June 13, the film starring Madonna, Warren Beatty, Dustin
Hoffman and Al Pacino will be shown in the century-old Woodstock
Opera House in this town of 13,000 about 50 miles northwest of
Chicago.
   The movie opens around the country two days later.
   Gould began drawing Dick Tracy in 1931 and took up residence at
a farm outside Woodstock four years later. He retired in 1977 and
died in 1985.
   Mayor Jim Shoemaker, who's lived there 30 years, says locals
tell him stories of their children biking to the Gould house and
returning home with cartoons on their clothing.
   ``He would draw right on their T-shirt, and it was just a great
thing he did,'' Shoemaker said in a telephone interview Saturday.
   Woodstock is a town that cherishes its history. Three Academy
Award winners _ Paul Newman, Orson Welles and Geraldine Page _ got
their start in summer stock at the opera house, Shoemaker said.
   So after Gould died, Shoemaker decided to establish a Chester
Gould Memorial Library that would chronicle the cartoonist's career.
   When news of the upcoming ``Dick Tracy'' film was out, some
Woodstockers suggested that a local premier could raise money for
the library, the mayor said. Residents lobbied the Walt Disney
organization, and the premiere was eventually set.

   Author Janet Dailey has written 84
books, but don't thking that means it's easy for her.
   ``Writing is like having a baby ...,'' she said ``I hammer out
every word. ... None of them flows.''
   The best-selling author says she never expected fame. In fact,
she hoped only for two readers, she said Friday during a
book-autographing session.
   ``When I wrote my first book for Harlequin 15 years ago, I
thought only two people would read it ... my husband and my
mother,'' she said.
   ``At the time, the only serious thing I'd ever written before
was a business letter,'' she said.
   Ms. Dailey's current book, ``Masquerade,'' is No. 4 this week on
The New York Times best-seller list. It's about a New Orleans
heiress who gets involved with a masked man at a carnival.

   Folk singer Peter Yarrow said he felt honored to
be performing in the King County Jail.
   About 100 male inmates heard one concert and 20 women another on
Friday, clapping and tapping their feet to ``Puff the Magic
Dragon,'' ``Leaving on a Jet Plane,'' ``Day Is Done'' and
``Blowing' in the Wind.''
   Rather than Paul and Mary, Yarrow was accompanied by a nun who
serves as a jail chaplain.
   Nursing a cold, the balding veteran of the 1960s group Peter,
Paul and Mary said it was at least as important to sing in the jail
as at his concert later Friday, where tickets cost $19 to $25.
   ``It is a privilege for me to sing in special circumstances,''
Yarrow said.
   ``I wish you all, when you get out, a sense of what these songs
say,'' he said. ``It is not just dumb words that fall to the floor
without meaning.''

   Author Hunter Thompson, sporting a green
baseball cap emblazoned with a badge, bemoaned his legal problems
and said he is crusading against improper police power.
   ``I'm a kind of fugitive from justice,'' Thompson said in a
30-minute speech at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
   ``I've been anointed as the point man to carry the ball for a
lot of people in the country who thought the police didn't have a
right to come search your home on the word of any informant,'' he
said.
   Thompson faces felony charges in Colorado of possession of
cocaine, LSD, valium, marijuana, dynamite and blasting caps. In a
separate case, Thompson faces a felony charge of using cocaine and
misdemeanor charges of third-degree sexual assault and third-degree
assault.
   Thompson sipped bourbon and smoked cigarettes from a holder
throughout the disjointed address Friday night.
   He rose to fame in the '70s through his books ``Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas'' and ``Fear and Loathing on the Campaign
Trail'' and his articles in Rolling Stone magazine. The author, 52,
is a long-time proponent of the legalization of marijuana and other
drugs.
   After reading the results of an ABC News poll that indicate wide
support for President Bush's anti-drug policy, Thompson repeatedly
urged the crowd to vote and participate in the democratic system to
try to counter law-and-order hysteria.
   But he admitted he has not followed his own advice.
   ``I didn't vote last time. I was way too insulted to vote for a
party of professional losers,'' Thompson said. ``In a democracy, we
do deserve a two-party system, a loyal opposition. But the
Democrats aren't going to do it.''
   Thompson also reflected on his old nemesis, former president
Richard Nixon.
   ``He was fun. He was a crook in his genes, but Nixon was a
player. George Bush is not a player, he's a manager. Bush is not
fun.''

   Former Dallas Cowboys running back Walt Garrison,
who serves as a spokesman and executive for a smokeless tobacco
company, said he much prefers the joys of roping cattle to watching
football these days.
   Garrison and his wife, Debbie, a former Miss Rodeo America,
enjoy watching and competing in roping competitions.
   Although a pair of his football shoes is bronzed and he has six
game balls in his trophy case to remind him of his playing days,
Garrison said recently he'd rather not wander over to Irving these
days to watch the Dallas Cowboys.
   ``How many retired bricklayers do you know who go watch people
lay brick?'' he said. ``Especially on Sunday.''
