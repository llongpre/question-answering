   A few years ago town selectmen took up the
task of repairing the sagging, century-old covered wooden bridge
over the Ottauquechee River. The result _ complete with greenish
plastic glass windows in the roof _ has townspeople and
preservationists aghast.
   Purists say there was something magical about the darkness in
the Lincoln Bridge, built in 1877.
   ``One old farmer told me he liked the darkness of the bridge
because he'd kiss his wife every time they drove through it,''
recalls Harry Francis, owner of the neighboring Lincoln Inn. ``Now
I'm cheek to jowl with this tragic atrocity.''
   When they assigned the repair task to state engineers, the
selectmen suggested that a few skylights might be included.
   ``It was a safety issue, not just for drivers but for the
pedestrians milling about on the bridge,'' said Woodstock Town
Manager Phillip Swanson. ``We had tourists from all across the
country walking around in the dark.''
   But when the bridge reopened last month after the long
renovation, there were six pea-green plastic glass skylights
installed in a corrugated, baked-enamel roof.
   ``What bothers me is if you are going to put all of this money
into restoring it, why does it have to look like a McDonald's
hamburger stand?'' one resident, William McDonald, said at a recent
town meeting.
   ``There is nothing historical about the bridge anymore. It's
just a wooden bridge in the same location,'' said Frank Teagle, a
Woodstock preservationist.
   Even town officials concede the plastic skylights aren't quite
what they had in mind.
   ``There are greens and there are greens,'' says Selectman Thomas
Debevoise III.
   The controversy has prompted plenty of finger-pointing.
   ``It would have made things a lot easier if Mr. Gilbertson had
said `No' when the plans came in,'' said Debevoise, a reference to
the director of the state Division of Historic Preservation.
   Eric Gilbertson said he wishes his office had caught the
skylights, but they somehow slipped by.
   Engineer Peter Gratiot, of nearby Pomfret, who has had an office
in Woodstock for 35 years, has fought for an all-wood restoration
since 1986. He said he mistakenly overlooked the skylights while
concentrating on what he called ``the real battle'' _ the fight to
keep the bridge authentic from a pure engineering standpoint.
   Gratiot and members of the National Society for the Preservation
of Covered Bridges wanted restoration as the original planner, T.
Willis Pratt, would have designed it: free of steel girders and
using mostly wood.
   ``But state engineers are not trained in wood,'' said Gratiot.
Now the bridge has both steel supports and the skylights.
   Swanson, who drives over the bridge every day to work, dismisses
the charge that the historical value of the bridge has been
damaged. ``It's just as old as it ever was.''
   Woodstock, a town of about 3,500, is one of Vermont's leading
resort communities, thanks in large part to the efforts of the
Rockefeller family, which bought and restored several historic
buildings in the village, paid to bury utility lines and took other
measures aimed at recreating a 19th-century New England village.
   The bridge is one of three covered wooden structures in
Woodstock. The other two bridges are illuminated by either lattice
work or window notches in the walls.
   In addition to the skylights, the non-wood roof is another sore
point. Officials say it is easier to maintain.
   Francis, McDonald and others are petitioning for another roof.
The Board of Selectmen will decide by May 1 whether to allow a
group of private citizens to raise enough money _ $20,000 by some
estimates _ to install traditional cedar shingles.
   If the selectmen reject the wood shingle idea, resident Dennis
DePaul said he will petition again.
   ``The quality of life is high in Woodstock because the
forbearers of the town had the intelligence and generosity to
create beauty,'' he said. ``We are the stewards of that beauty and
history. It's important that we hang on to it.''
