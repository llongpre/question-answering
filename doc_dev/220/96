   Where were you the second week of 1969?
   A few baby boomers are bound to suffer mental gaps, but ``Try to
Remember'' on CBS, with host Charles Kuralt, refreshes the memory
Thursday with an hour of reminiscence about Woodstock, Apollo 11,
Hurricane Camille and riots in Belfast, among other events.
   The program is a compilation of archival footage but also
features present-day interviews with everyday people who
experienced or were changed by those events: a lab worker who was
quarantined along with the astronauts when she was exposed to
moondust, an Episcopal rector who clung to life as his church
flooded around him, two women who were tots when soldiers and guns
became a way of life in Ulster, and a member of the first black
commission in Green County, Ala., who was elected that week.
   ``Try to Remember'' is a one-hour pilot for a possible half-hour
series.
   There are obvious similarities to ABC's defunct ``Our World,''
the hour-long program of two seasons ago that looked back on
particular parts of certain years each week. Linda Ellerbee is
trying to resurrect it on public television.
   ``We just aren't trying to do the same thing,'' said executive
producer Shad Northshield. ``Notably, we have Kuralt, and that
makes it different. We aren't resting with explaining what happened
that week, but what happened with individuals, non-famous people,
and how their lives were changed by what happened that week.''
   ``Try to Remember'' is not a clone if for no other reason than
Kuralt and Northshield, the team largely responsible for the
distinctive style of the highly praised ``CBS Sunday Morning.'' A
show like ``Try to Remember'' is perfect for their thoughtful
eloquence.
   For instance, one segment of the hour consists of a long, silent
scan of the portion of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that bears the
names of the soldiers who died that week.
   The highlight for those who remember 1969 as a time of peace,
love and rock 'n' roll is previously unshown footage of Janis
Joplin performing at Woodstock.
   Kuralt interviews Martin Scorsese and his long-time collaborator
Thelma Schoonmaker about their documentary, ``Woodstock.'' Joplin's
set was not included in the movie, Scorsese said, partly because of
poor lighting, but mostly out of agreement with Joplin's
management, who for vague reasons didn't want it shown. It makes
great TV almost 20 years later.
   Northshield said the program will concentrate on the '50s, '60s
or '70s. ``The best week is one in which there was someting very
memorable and famous, but only maybe one thing, and then the rest
of the week has a lot of important and interesting things nobody
remembers,'' he said.
   One half hour has already been shot, and the staff is hard at
work researching, even though there is no series commitment as yet
from CBS. The network already has three hours of news in prime time
_ ``60 Minutes,'' ``West 57th'' and ``48 Hours'' _ and is under
pressure to get out of third place in the ratings.
   But the Writers Guild of America strike, in its third month, has
already forced CBS to delay the start of its fall season until
October, so a news show, whose writers are not covered by the
Guild, might get a lucky break in the fall.
   ``That's our only hope,'' said Northshield, ``that so-called
`miniseason' that will be in August, September, October. The summer
is going to last longer than usual. Even if the strike ended today,
it would be late October before they (the entertainment division)
could get anything on.''
   Northshield ideally would like to see the program as a periodic
short-run series of eight or 10 episodes.
   NBC will begin the TV season with wall-to-wall, prime-time
coverage of the Summer Olympics, and ABC plans to rerun its
midseason replacement shows. ``Try to Remember'' would not be a bad
alternative for CBS or its viewers.

   Elsewhere in television:
   PROGRAMMER'S PLAYHOUSE _ Concerned viewers can rest easy. ``CBS
Summer Playhouse'' is back on the air. The ``anthology'' made its
debut last summer with a series of decidedly unmemorable pilots
developed for the next season that didn't make it. CBS thinks the
series is educational because it gives viewers ``insight into the
programming process.'' In other words, if you think what they put
on is bad, you should see the ones that didn't make it. ...
   `FRANK'S PLACE' BACK _ One show that deserves to make it is CBS'
acclaimed ``Frank's Place.'' Viewers can get another chance to
catch this superb half-hour comedy when it begins repeats July 16.
The series is not on the fall schedule, but CBS promises it will
return midseason. This summer, it will follow ``Kate &amp; Allie'' on
Saturdays, replacing ``High Mountain Rangers.''
