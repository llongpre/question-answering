   When the Saratoga Performing Arts
Center opened 25 years ago, operators had a difficult time
persuading rock and pop artists to play at the amphitheater.
   No such problem now. This granddaddy of summer amphitheaters can
now pick and choose among the music business' biggest names to fill
out a schedule of more than 40 summer shows.
   In the last decade, outdoor amphitheaters have become a staple
of the concert business. Only this year, new outdoor arenas are
opening near Chicago and Pittsburgh, with Cher hosting the
inaugural shows in both places.
   The ``shed circuit'' has resurrected dormant careers and given
consumers such a huge array of choices that it has some industry
leaders worried about overkill.
   Among dozens of artists on the road this summer are David Bowie,
Eric Clapton, the B-52s, Sinead O'Connor, Tears For Fears, James
Taylor, Jimmy Buffett, Fleetwood Mac, Tracy Chapman, Bonnie Raitt,
Little Feat and those summer perennials, the Beach Boys.
   ``I think it will be a good musical summer _ a good mix of
styles,'' said David Hart, who books acts at amphitheaters in
Detroit, Chicago and Washington for the Nederlander Organization.
   Most amphitheaters are built the same way, with a section of
covered seats surrounded by an expanse of lawn for picnickers. In
Saratoga, for example, there are 5,300 seats protected from the
weather, but up to 25,000 people can sprawl on the lawns.
   Their growing popularity coincided with the aging of the '60s
generation. Woodstock nation still likes its rock 'n' roll
outdoors, but with a lawn chair and wine instead of mud and drugs.
   ``It's more a part of the show to be outside, sitting out on
blankets, enjoying yourself and enjoying the weather,'' said
Buffett, who's selling out sheds across the country this summer.
``The weather's definitely part of the show.''
   Amphitheaters have sprouted like mushrooms in recent years.
Along with its Pittsburgh shed, the Pace Entertainment Group has
opened facilities in Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Nashville and
Memphis within the past five years.
   ``It's a natural setting for music,'' said Louis Messina,
president of Pace. ``They're built for music, unlike an arena that
is built for basketball and hockey.''
   From a business point of view, musicians like the combination of
covered and lawn seats. In Saratoga's opening years, their managers
worried that a rainy night would wash out all their business, until
they realized that at least some patrons would be kept dry, said
Herb Chesbrough, the arena's president.
   The sheds _ with many booking acts that appeal heavily to young
adult whites _ have helped keep alive the careers of '60s and '70s
acts that otherwise might not do much business.
   James Taylor, years from his latest hit, is a summertime
favorite. So are the Beach Boys, just as much annual fixtures in
Saratoga as the thoroughbred racehorses that trot through each
August.
   ``Their audiences feel more comfortable in a place like this
than they do in an arena,'' Chesbrough said. ``If you took an
artist like James Taylor and put him in an indoor arena, he'd
probably sell about half the tickets.''
   Buffett's taken a band on the road during the summer for 16 or
17 years now. It's reached the point where the ``Margaritaville''
man rarely performs during the other three seasons.
   Even Buffett, whose songs have been absent from the top of the
charts since the late '70s, admits he's surprised at how well his
concert tickets are selling this year.
   ``It shocks me,'' he said. ``I figured I might have two or three
more years and then reach a cap.''
   He's not alone in preferring to hit the road in the summer. Some
industry experts are worried that the concert business is getting
too reliant on the warm weather months.
   ``Because of the sheds, touring has become a four-month business
primarily,'' said Carl Freed, executive director of the North
American Concert Promoters Association. ``It's created a glut in
the marketplace. You have more acts than the public can pay to see
at the same time. Therefore, the ticket sales suffer for the
borderline acts.''
   Chesbrough said he doesn't mind having a lot of acts from which
to choose. However, Chesbrough, who used to try and entice
musicians into an area that was relatively unique, now said he's
worried that amphitheater operators will be fighting among
themselves for acts.
   A glut can be good news for consumers. To be competitive,
promoters must specifically package together acts for the sheds.
Ringo Starr, who went on the road last summer with an all-star band
of musical vets, is an example.
   This year, Bonnie Raitt is taking along John Lee Hooker, the
Jeff Healey Band, Dr. John and others on a blues extravaganza tour.
Fleetwood Mac is teaming with British popsters Squeeze; the B-52s
bring along up-and-coming reggae star Ziggy Marley; and Rickie Lee
Jones and Lyle Lovett join on an eclectic bill.
   It's too early to declare winners and losers for the summer.
Privately, promoters are especially bullish on the Stevie Ray
Vaughan and Joe Cocker double bill, Bowie, the B-52s, the Allman
Brothers and George Thorogood, Kenny G and Michael Bolton, and
O'Connor.
   Some promoters said they were worried that Chapman, Australian
rockers Midnight Oil and the Fleetwood Mac-Squeeze bill are some
that could get lost in the shuffle.
   Other acts, such as Madonna, Paul McCartney and New Kids on the
Block, are touring stadiums this summer. Amphitheater operators say
these big-name shows are more a help than a hindrance, since they
create interest in music.
