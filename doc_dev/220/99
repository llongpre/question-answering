For the youth of China, the past month's events in Tian An Men Square are 
certain to assume a mythic status exceeding even that of the famed Woodstock 
music festival for Americans who came of age in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Music has been secondary to politics in what will be known as the great 1989 
democracy rallies of Tian An Men Square. But two songs have played important 
roles in protests that appear on the verge of toppling Premier Li Peng from 
office: China's national anthem and the revolutionary socialist hymn, "The 
Internationale." Both songs call for oppressed people to rise up in revolt, and 
the students sing them with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
Softer tunes have been heard as well. One day, to entertain the crowd a 
guitarist stood and played atop a bus parked at the square. At night, people 
huddled in small groups and sang. 
</P>
<P>
There has also been time for some romance during those long days and nights at 
the square. 
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, a couple decided that they wanted to get married, and they and 
their friends put together an impromptu wedding ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
In place of ribbons, red strips of cloth were knotted and pinned to the blouse 
of the bride and shirt of the groom, who stood in the midst of their friends 
for the brief event. 
</P>
<P>
Someone wrote up a wedding certificate -- lacking legal force but surely issued 
with love -- and it was presented to the happy couple as the students around 
them cheered. 
</P>
<P>
Motorbikes are relatively rare on China's streets, but they do exist. During 
weeks filled with high political drama and extraordinary street scenes, one of 
the most gripping sights has been the Flying Tiger Team, consisting of about 
500 young owners of motorbikes and light motorcycles and, in many cases, their 
girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
Two helmeted riders per bike, with those in the lead carrying streaming 
banners, the Flying Tiger Team has raced through the streets of Beijing in 
search of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"Block the army trucks!" screamed the riders as they roared toward the city's 
outskirts one recent night to help blockade the advancing People's Liberation 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
The Flying Tigers are themselves a symbol of the new, uneven prosperity that 
senior leader Deng Xiaoping -- himself a major target of the protests -- has 
brought to China with market-oriented reforms over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Motorbikes, in addition to being in short supply, are too expensive for most 
Chinese. It is primarily the class of prosperous private entrepreneurs who can 
afford them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little strange that they've been some of our strongest supporters," 
said one student as he watched the Flying Tigers roar off into the darkness. 
"Students often complain about unfair distribution of money. The Flying Tiger 
Team, in some sense, represents all that." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that the students have welcomed the bikers' support. 
</P>
<P>
"We can all benefit from democracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the fascinating, and in a sense tragic, aspects of the current 
demonstrations is how so many people have turned against a leader, the 
84-year-old Deng Xiaoping, who has done so much for them. 
</P>
<P>
Deng has freed China from the irrationality and severe political controls of 
the Maoist era and set it on the path of economic reform and growing 
prosperity. But today's protesting youth, and many of their elders, now view 
him as an aging emperor, unable to understand China's current needs and 
clinging to power past his time. 
</P>
<P>
"Xiaoping, the People of Sichuan Welcome You Home," declared a hand-scrawled 
cardboard poster held by a man standing along the parade route during a recent 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
With some pride, the protester displayed the opposite side of the sign. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Live the Respected Xiaoping. Long Live! Long Live!" it declared. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by several passers-by whether the two sides of his sign did not conflict, 
the man explained: "We want him to go back to Sichuan and pass good days, have 
an idle, very peaceful and quiet life, and live for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
A poster carried in another march captured the feelings of the vast majority of 
protesters: 
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping -- Thank You. Goodby."
