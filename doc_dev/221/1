   The Grinch was pinched from a hotel display, giving
the storybook character a taste of his own medicine.
   The downtown Quality Inn has put up an eggnog reward for
information leading to the return of the lanky larcener.
   ``We're missing a 6-foot green Grinch. AWOL in Boston,'' Jeff
Hilary, manager of the downtown Quality Inn said Friday.
   No leads turned up Friday, although Hilary said an ice carver
would be bringing in an ice sculpture of the cold-hearted Grinch to
replace the missing statue.
   Police were aiding in the search for the statue, said department
spokesman Jim Jordan.
   ``We have a report of stolen property, a 6-foot papier-mache
statue from the famous Dr. Seuss children's story,'' he said. ``We
have no information as to its whereabouts.''
   Hilary said the theft was detected early Thursday after a party
in a hotel ballroom where the Grinch was on display.
   ``There can't be that many gangly green Grinches wandering around
Boston,'' Hilary said. ``He's quite tall _ got a Christmas hat on.''
   The Grinch was part of a Christmas display worth about $800,
Hilary said. Thieves left the sleigh on which the Grinch had perched.
   According to the children's story by Dr. Seuss, ``The Grinch That
Stole Christmas,'' the dour green character makes off with a town's
Christmas decorations and presents after becoming enraged by the
sounds of Christmas cheer. But the Grinch relents and returns the
booty to Whoville.
   Hilary said hotel staff hope the heist is the work of a prankster
who will decide to restore the decoration.
   ``We're offering a reward of a substantial amount of eggnog for
anybody with information leading to the reapprehension of our
friend,'' he said. ``I don't know what the insurance company's going
to say about it.''
