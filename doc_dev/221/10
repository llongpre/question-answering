<TEXT>      Who? Dr. Seuss, that's who.;   Oh, my. Whimsy went out of the world.;  
Theodor Seuss Geisel was the writer-illustrator who stole -- and kept -- the
hearts of three generations of children.; He was 87 when he died about 10 p.m.
at his home in La Jolla, his family at his bedside. He had been suffering from
a jawbone infection that had become acute in recent months, said Jerry
Harrison, who oversees Random House Books for Young Readers, Geisel's longtime
publishers.;   From his first Dr. Seuss book in 1937 to his 47th last year,
Geisel made "Read to me" the most important part of the day for millions of
children, when Mommy or Daddy or Grandpa or Sis opened the cover on the world
of Horton, Yertle, the Lorax or the Grinch.;   Barbara Bush, whose cause as
First Lady has been improving literacy, knew that well when she said
Wednesday: "All of us are grateful for the laughter and the love shared by
parents and children every time we read one of Dr. Seuss's classic tales
together.";   Perhaps the most famous was "The Cat in the Hat," but readers
the world over might name "Horton Hatches the Egg," "Yertle the Turtle" or
"Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You?" along with a smile and the part they had
memorized as a child -- or adult. More than 200 million copies of his books
were sold. They; were translated into 20 languages.;   "If you asked people
today to name one children's author, I'd venture it would probably be Dr.
Seuss," said Julie Cummins, the New York Public Library's coordinator of
children's services.;   Geisel's 48th book, "Six by Seuss," was a collection
of his own favorites -- "And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street," "The
500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins," "The Lorax," "Horton Hears a Who!" "Yertle
the Turtle" and "How the Grinch Stole Christmas.";   Many felt the archetypal
Seuss hero was Horton, the conscientious pachyderm who was duped by a lazy
bird into sitting on her egg. Horton stuck to the job for many weeks, despite
dreadful weather and other harassments, saying, "I meant what I said and I
said what I meant; an elephant's faithful 100 percent.";   Conversely, the
Grinch became the universal villain, and Geisel's television production about
his awful deeds made him even more reprehensible. "How the Grinch Stole
Christmas!" and "Horton Hears a Who!" both won TV's Peabody Award. Geisel was
also awarded a 1984 Pulitzer Prize for his contribution to children's
literature.;   Geisel was an illustrator first and writer second. He'd tack
his drawings onto the corkboard of his studio walls in storyboard fashion,
muse over them and then write the accompanying couplets. Sometimes an
illustrated story line would befuddle him for two years before he could marry
it to words; other times, he'd crank out his verses in just a few days.;   "If
all our authors were as he was, we wouldn't need editors," said Janet
Schulman, his editor at Random House. "Occasionally he'd give us a rhyme that
was a little off, or a word that might not work. He'd think about it and
sometimes he'd change it -- but usually he wouldn't, and that was fine.;  
"There will never be another Ted Geisel.";   Friends said Geisel painstakingly
separated his social life from his work -- a self-disciplined 9:30 a.m. to
5:30 p.m. job where he would sequester himself in a studio that provided him
with a 180-degree view of the Pacific coastline, from Mexico to Oceanside.;  
But what linked Seuss and Geisel was humor.;   "He never . . . told jokes, but
he's funnier and more spontaneous than anyone I've ever known," said close
friend and fellow-author Jeanne Jones. "If he had the inclination, he could
have been the world's greatest stand-up comic.";   But if Geisel enjoyed
entertaining his friends, he took perhaps his greatest satisfaction in helping
introduce a new order to traditional children's literature.;   In an interview
in 1984, Geisel pulled off the shelf "The Riverside Reader," a dusty,
dog-eared primer he used in 1909 when he was in the first grade. As he turned
the pages, he pointed out the dull passages and mundane story line.;   "I
wanted to get rid of primers like this," he said. "I feel my greatest
accomplishment was getting rid of Dick and Jane, and encouraging students to
approach reading as a pleasure, not a chore.";   Geisel was born and grew up
in Springfield, Mass., and attended Dartmouth. He contributed cartoons to the
campus humor magazine, Jack-O'-Lantern, and became its editor. He graduated
with a bachelor's degree in English in 1925. Then followed a year of graduate
work in English literature at Lincoln College of Oxford University, after
which he spent a year traveling in Europe.;   In 1927, Geisel married Helen
Marion Palmer of Orange, N.J., a teacher he had met when they were studying at
Oxford. It was she who persuaded him to give up thoughts of teaching and make
drawing a career.;   "Ted's notebooks were always filled with these fabulous
animals," she later recalled. "So I set to work diverting him; here was a man
who could draw such pictures; he should be earning a living doing that.";  
Geisel was childless himself -- after Helen's death in 1967, he married Audrey
Stone Dimond, a mother of two -- but had an unrivaled gift for delighting
children.;   "You make 'em, I amuse 'em," he once said.;   Geisel had a full
career "writing for adults" before he began writing Dr. Seuss books full time.
He was a political cartoonist for the New York newspaper PM, and during World
War II was attached to Frank Capra's documentary film-making unit.;   After
writing and directing indoctrination movies for American troops, he won an
Oscar for best documentary short for a troop film that was released after the
war by Warner Bros. Geisel won another Academy Award in 1947 for "Design of
Death," a documentary film about Japanese warlords. He won a third Oscar in
1951 for an animated cartoon -- "Gerald McBoing-Boing." Many of the techniques
Geisel learned in Hollywood were useful when he began writing children's
books.;   Geisel began using his middle name as a pen name for his cartoons
because he hoped to use his surname as a novelist one day. But when he got
around to doing a grown-up book -- "The Seven Lady Godivas" in 1939 --
grown-ups did not seem to want to buy his humor, and he went back to writing
for children, becoming famous and wealthy.;   "I'd rather write for kids," he
later explained. "They're more appreciative; adults are obsolete children, and
the hell with them.";   When asked two weeks ago whether he had any final
message, Geisel told the San Diego Tribune: "Whenever things go a bit sour in
a job I'm doing, I always tell myself: 'You can do better than this.' The best
slogan I can think of to leave with the U.S.A. would be: 'We can do and we've
got to do better than this.' "  </TEXT>
