   Christo, the unconventional artist whose
creations have included fabric-wrapped islands and a 24{-mile cloth
fence, now wants parts of Japan and southern California to blossom
with 3,000 huge umbrellas.
   ``A big part of it is a comparison of differences and
similarities between places and people with a lot of affinities,''
Christo, 52, said recently by telephone from his studio in New York.
   His plan calls for about 1,500 yellow umbrellas, 19.8 feet high
and 26.4 feet in diameter, to blossom like California poppies in
the Tehachapi Mountains 60 miles north of Los Angeles. At the same
time, he wants to unfold 1,500 umbrellas _ identical except blue _
in the lush rural valley of Japan's Ibaraki prefecture, 72 miles
north of Tokyo.
   ``The project has two parts and will happen only like that,''
Christo said of ``The Umbrellas: Joint Project for Japan and the
USA.''
   That's assuming he gets all the necessary government permits and
permission from scores of landowners, and raises an estimated $8
million to $10 million. The California Legislature already backs
him.
   ``Like always, the permits is the most unknown,'' he said.
``Nobody can assume how, in what direction they will move. And they
probably are the most consuming in time.''
   For decades, Christo has created art on an epic scale.
   In 1985, he wrapped the almost-400-year-old Pont Neuf bridge in
Paris with 440,000 square feet of champagne-colored fabric. Two
years earlier, he surrounded 11 islands in Florida's Biscayne Bay
with 6 million square feet of shocking pink polypropylene. In 1976,
he used a white translucent fabric to create ``Running Fence,'' an
18-foot-high fence that ran like a ribbon across 24{ miles of Marin
and Sonoma counties in northern California.
   Each of his big projects, Christo said, aims to create ``a
gentle disturbance of space, to create new boundaries, new
territories and a new type of range limitation of very routine
space that everybody uses.''
   ``I see these projects as a poetical scream _ a scream of
freedom,'' the Bulgarian-born artist said.
   Not everyone shares his vision. For more than 15 years the West
German government has refused to let him wrap fabric around the old
German parliament, the Reichstag.
   Christo hopes to bring The Umbrellas to fruition in October
1990. Like his other works, the umbrellas will be exhibited for a
few weeks and then removed.
   At Christo's insistence, financing must be arranged privately,
backed by the sale of his preparatory drawings, studies, collages,
scale models and early works.
   ``And of course this part of my work, these projects are very
anti-materialistic,'' Christo said. ``They are very linked to huge
poetical freedom. They deal with art, not like a commodity, but art
very personal, relaxed, a very open experience on many levels.''
   Christo has discussed his proposal with officials in Los Angeles
and Kern counties, and a resolution of general support was adopted
last Sept. 9 by both houses of the California Legislature.
   In California, Christo said his team must obtain the permission
of 51 private property owners on the 18{-mile-long site, from
Gorman along Interstate 5 over the Tejon Pass and down the
Grapevine grade.
   In Japan, there are 750 private landowners on the proposed
12{-mile-mile site.
   In California, the largest single landowner whose permission
will be needed is the Tejon Ranch Co.
   Tejon vice president and general counsel Dennis McCarthy said
there are concerns about public use of ranch property and
liability, but added that it's hard to buck the groundswell of
support Christo has gained among public officials.
   ``It leaves landowners in a situation _ I don't know exactly how
to say this _ but you don't want to be a wet blanket, or `The
Grinch Who Stole Christmas,''' McCarthy said.
