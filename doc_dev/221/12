<LEADPARA>  THEODORE Seuss Geisel has died; Dr. Seuss is going to be alive a long, long
time.;   Already a third generation of children is tirelessly demanding "read
it again, Mommy" after hearing "Green Eggs and Ham" or "one fish two fish red
fish blue fish."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The cat in the hat, the Lorax and Horton the elephant are part of our
common cultural heritage. The Grinch is as infamous a spoiler of Christmas as
Scrooge.;   Dr. Seuss' books combine whimsical happenings, wordplay, and
curious drawings to entertain children and teach basic moral lessons: Live
peacefully, "The Butter Battle Book." Respect and preserve nature, "The
Lorax." Be forthright and steadfast, "I mean what I said and I said what I
meant. An elephant's faithful 100 percent," said Horton in "Horton Hatches the
Egg." Trust your own experiences, the message of "Horton Hears a Who." Above
all, have fun with words and imagination.;   Only Charles Schulz, creator of
"Peanuts," ranks with Seuss in bringing to life the wisdom and humor of
innocence.;   Such was Geisel's effect on children's books that he became an
education reformer. With "The Cat in the Hat" and other books for beginning
readers, Seuss wrote books to help children learn to read.;   His novel
approach, which slowly won the acceptance of educators, was giving children
books with simple words that were fun to read. Compare "The Cat in the Hat" to
being tortured by Dick, Jane and Spot.;   "That is what I am proudest of; that
I had something to do with getting rid of Dick and Jane," Geisel said in
1982.;   It is hard to stay sad about the death of Theodore Geisel, because he
invented so many antidotes for the poison of sadness.;   Says the cat in the
hat:;   I know today's wet;   And the sun's lost its sunny.;   But we could
have;   Lots of good fun that is funny.;   And we do, whenever we think of Dr.
Seuss.  </TEXT>
