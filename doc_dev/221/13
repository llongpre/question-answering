<P>
The school board of a tiny Northern California logging town has unanimously 
voted to continue requiring its second graders to read a Dr. Seuss book that 
two prominent local families charge is a thinly veiled attack on the timber 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Amid a flood of television lights and national press attention, the Laytonville 
School Board rejected the request to remove from its second grade core reading 
list "The Lorax," a 1971 book about a fuzzy-headed creature who fights a 
fruitless battle against the devastation of a make-believe forest. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was greeted by thunderous applause from the more than 200 
onlookers and students who jammed the cafeteria of the elementary school in 
this town 150 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

La Jolla Author 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Seuss is the pen name of Theodor Seuss Geisel of La Jolla, who for decades 
has charmed young readers with his rhyming whimsy. He is the author of more 
than 40 books such as "The Cat in the Hat" and "How the Grinch Stole 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
In September, Judith Bailey, the wife of a wealthy Laytonville lumber supplier, 
petitioned the board to remove "The Lorax" from the required reading list, 
instead making it alternative reading. 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing controversy struck at the growing tension in Laytonville between 
established logging families and newcomers from urban areas, many of whom 
believe Northern California's forests are a precious commodity and should be 
preserved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compared to Book Burning 
</P>
<P>
Some residents claimed the loggers' actions were tantamount to book burning. 
Others snickered that the woodsmen wanted to "Ax the Lorax, lynch the Grinch." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, school board President William Webster spoke of the divided 
community when he opened the meeting by quipping, "Welcome to 'Family Feud.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later -- time that included sometimes heated remarks from board and 
community members alike -- Webster summed up the board's sentiments to a chorus 
of appreciative hoots and hollers. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to go into the classroom . . . to say which book you can teach . . . is 
about as appropriate as a group of teachers going into the woods" to decide 
which trees to cut down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an exercise in power and ignorance and futility. We are insulting our 
children -- who do we think we are kidding? We are telling these children 'We 
need to protect you from certain ideas.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's in conflict with everything the United States stands for. Let's let the 
teachers teach. Let's let the students learn." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers believed the loggers' efforts were a dangerous strike at their 
professional integrity. Their numbers included teachers' association members 
from as far away as the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
At first, things did not look good for either "The Lorax" or the concept of a 
core reading list for second graders as board members discussed alternatives 
for the book -- talk that included moving it to the core literature list for 
seventh graders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Ordered 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the board voted to keep the book on the reading list but assigned 
School Supt. Brian Buckley to review the use of core and extended literature 
lists as part of the district's language arts curriculum and report back at a 
later date. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, parents who object to any literary work used in the classroom 
can ask for a comparable book to be used by their child, board members said. 
</P>
<P>
Kristen Burgess, a Laytonville high school senior, told the board, however, 
that the town's children at least had no problem with the book. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of students polled said they wanted to keep the book on the 
reading list, she said. 
</P>
<P>
One angry parent told the board that if the book went, he would take his two 
children out of the public school.
