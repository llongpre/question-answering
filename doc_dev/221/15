   With fewer than 70 shopping days till Christmas, millions of Americans are avoiding long lines, bad weather and crowded parking lots by doing some or all of their Christmas shopping by mail. 
Many people find mail order more convenient and sometimes cheaper, since state sales taxes aren't charged if the recipient is out-of-state. 
But if Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) has his way, mail-order firms will have to collect sales taxes on all their transactions. 
The House Ways and Means Committee will vote on his bill next month. 
If it passes it will be just in time to give consumers an unwelcome holiday present. 

   Mail-order and direct-marketing sales are booming. 
Interstate sales top $100 billion a year and represent as much as 14% of all retail business. 

   Rep. Dorgan's bill would cost mailorder consumers up to $1.5 billion. 
Several business groups support the measure; they argue that the companies that send tax-free merchandise through the mails are unfair competition for local retailers. 
Mail-order firms respond that the Dorgan bill would impose enormous compliance costs. 

   L.L. Bean, a catalog store in Freeport, Maine, claims that just printing the different tax rates and exemptions in its catalog would cost $10 million a year. 
Studies indicate it costs direct marketers three to 10 times as much money to collect sales taxes as it does for retail companies. 
The 45 states and 7,000 localities with sales taxes have never agreed on a coordinated plan of collection, so the only way to enforce payment of mail-order taxes is to allow dozens of different auditors to inspect catalog companies' books. 

   In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled that states would violate the Constitution's commerce clause if they levied a sales tax on out-of-state retailers that had no presence in the state beyond advertising. 
Since the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, Rep. Dorgan wants Congress to define what a minimum business presence in a state is in a way that allows out-of-state sellers to be taxed. 

   But even if that argument is upheld by the Supreme Court, taxing mail-order firms may also violate the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment because the firms being taxed won't benefit from state government activities. 
The Treasury Department is concerned about the bill because it would require the Internal Revenue Service to share sales-tax data filed by merchants with state tax collectors, thus inviting public suspicion about the confidentiality of federal tax returns. 

   Retail merchants that back the Dorgan bill, such as J.C. Penney, are correct in saying that mail-order companies are at a competitive advantage in not having to charge sales taxes, which can range as high as 9%. 
But that isn't an argument for creating an enforcement nightmare that could drive some mail-order merchants out of business. 
It is an argument for states to consider reducing any sales taxes that are so high that they induce people to shop out-of-state for goods. 

   In Dr. Seuss's tale, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," a dour figure swept down on Whoville and made off with all of the Christmas presents in the town. 
But, in the true spirit of the season, the inhabitants celebrated anyway. 
Christmas would also still be the same if Rep. Dorgan's bill passes, but that is no reason to make consumer goods more expensive for people by chasing their dollars across state lines and slapping a constitutionally dubious tax on them.
