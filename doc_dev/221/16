   The Grinch began the Christmas season
almost as early as retailers this year, stealing a load of trees
from the Boy Scouts.
   Thieves stole 180 bundled Christmas trees from a parking lot
Wednesday. Independence Boy Scout Troop 747 had planned to begin
selling the trees on Friday and use the proceeds to send its
members to camp next summer.
   ``We're just sick at heart,'' said Debbie Camerlynck, the
director of the scouts' Christmas tree project and mother of one of
the scouts.
   The trees were bought for $4,200, she said.
   A witness said two men loaded the trees into a pickup and drove
off. Police said the thieves must have made several trips to steal
the 180 trees.
