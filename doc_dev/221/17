   Every Christmas season for 15 years,
the Hernandez family adorned the pine tree on their front lawn with
garland, tinsel and more than 200 festive ornaments.
   That is until a Grinch chopped it down and made off with the
12-foot Monterey pine that had become a neighborhood landmark.
   On Wednesday, Ricardo Hernandez walked out the front door and
saw only a stump with pine needles scattered about. The 36-year-old
welder took to the trail of needles like a hunter takes to
footprints in the snow.
   The path eventually led to an apartment complex, where Hernandez
found his tree sitting on a porch.
   But the Grinch didn't live there.
   ``It was some old man with six kids,'' Hernandez said Thursday.
``He said he had bought the tree a little earlier for $7 from a
wino.''
   Hernandez didn't have the heart to take the tree back to his
distraught family.
   ``The kids were upset that somebody could steal a Christmas
tree,'' Hernandez said. ``I tried to convince them that they
couldn't steal the Christmas spirit. I tried to tell them that they
can steal a tree, but not the spirit.''
   Police say they are looking for the tree chopper.
   Neighbors who have looked forward every year to seeing the
brightly decorated tree joined in the family grief.
   ``It's awful. Especially at this time of year, and to steal that
kind of thing,'' Luis Frias said. ``Everybody around here is real
depressed.''
