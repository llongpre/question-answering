<TEXT>  (With the ragweed in bloom; and the gophers at play; And the aphids he
cultivates chomping away); With a book tightly clutched; in his long-fingered
grabber; And a leer on his mug as his heart, old and drab,; Is warmed (to a
temperature lower than normal); by tellers and tattlers, scandal informal,;
Bluster and beeswax applied with a trowel.; Conduct most foul! It delights the
old ghoul.; Why, a sleazy biography just makes him drool.; There's a game that
he likes to play, this time of year; As he slurps at his supper (fish tails
and beer,; with a vinegar sauce and an order of okra).; He pictures himself as
that wheezy old joker; In white beard and red suit, hitching his sleigh.; Who
would he put in the traces that day?; Well, there's Stalin(s1) of course;
("The First Glasnost Bio"); And "Dead Elvis"(s2) beside him, slathered in
mayo.; Geraldo(s3) comes next, exposing himself; -- You can't keep a true
scuzzball up on a shelf --; And speaking of which, here's a wonderful
twosome:; Mses. Reagan(s4) and Kelley(s5). . . .; The vision was gruesome.; He
laughed a Grinch laugh, like rusty doors creaking,; As he mentally added the
words, "Frankly speaking."; Now, the Grinch will admit to a passion
irrational; For books that delineate madness gone national.; "Is it my fault,"
he'd cry, grabbing Max by the snout,; "If they've opened asylums and shoo'd
'em all out; So that stories that once would be called economics; Are nigh
indistinguishable now from the comics?; On Boesky! On Milkin!" he'd cackled
with glee; As he sat down to read by his cold, smoky fire; Of the looting of
Wall Street; (the book's "Den of Thieves"(s6)).; And the old Grinch himself,
no slouch as a liar,; no novice at taking, the Ace of Acquire,; Had to take
off his hat and shout hoo-ray!; At the Algerish tale of the Prince of Pay(s7)
--; At Time-Warner, he learned, for Ross, Steven J.,; Christmas lasts 365 days
a year.; How can a green-blooded Grinch help but cheer?; "What a season!" he
snarled.; "Here's a history of 'Mad.'(s8); Here's a law book for
landlords.(s9); Here's Paul Fussell's 'BAD,'(s10); In which everything
everyone everywhere does"; -- here the Grinch cackled, his tongue all a-buzz
--; "Is marshaled to prove that the whole; country's dumb.; A man could do
worse than that Grinch; rule of thumb."; "I like a good laugh," said the
Grinch in one breath,; "Especially when there's a rattle of death.; The year
that began with that faux pas of Saddam's; Ends with a splendid collection of
Addams.(s11); Those six-fingered children! Those murderous plants!; The
undertaker who gives Green Stamps!; And the joy as the kids, evil writ on
their maws,; Lay a log on the fire to await Santa Claus."; That's the kind of
a Christmas that brings; the Grinch pleasure.; And this year he's even got
nature to treasure.; Yes, the Grinch, that old softy, he even likes birds,;
Which now he can recognize by just their turds.(s12); The bob white! The
pheasant! The falcon and jay!; Each has its own unmistakable "splay."; A book
with the manner of pure ornithology; That tackles a subject not far from
scatology; Had that Grinch in a grin, from ear to ear --; "Why, they take it
up there,; and then drop it back here!"; And he slipped off to sleep in the
dark of his cave --; The sort of a cave that a Grinch soul might crave --;
With the book in his hand and a smile on his mouth; As he dreamt of the
reindeer splay; Santa brought south.; (s1) Stalin: Triumph &amp; Tragedy, by
