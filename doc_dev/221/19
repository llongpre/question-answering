   The Grinch who stole Ricardo
Hernandez's Christmas tree couldn't steal Southern California's
Christmas spirit.
   Hernandez walked outside one day last week and found that
someone had chopped down the 12-foot-tall pine tree growing in his
front yard that the family had decorated every Christmas for the
past 15 years.
   On Friday, he walked out and found that someone had planted a
new one, standing 7 feet tall.
   And, thanks to actor Richard Dreyfuss' wife, Jeramie, the
children in the neighborhood have Christmas toys.
   Hernandez thought he was on the trail of the first tree's thief
when he tracked its scattered needles from his house to a nearby
apartment. But the apartment's occupants turned out to be a poor
family who had thought they had gotten a good deal on a Christmas
tree.
   ``It was some old man with six kids,'' Hernandez said. ``He said
he had bought the tree a little earlier for $7 from a wino.''
   Hernandez didn't have the heart to take the tree back.
   But word of the incident spread.
   Then Mrs. Dreyfuss arrived with a carload of gifts. She had
included gifts for the three Hernandez children, for the six
children whose porch now houses the tree and for other youngsters
in the neighborhood.
   ``The kids were upset that somebody could steal a Christmas
tree,'' Hernandez said. ``I tried to convince them that they
couldn't steal the Christmas spirit.''

   Was it an invader from outer space?
   Joe Hendricks said he was in the crawl space of his home to do
some wiring when he spotted a heart-shaped, grayish mass hanging
about 3 feet from the low boards overhead. It was about a yard at
its widest point and roughly 16 inches deep with streaks of colors
that almost seemed to pulsate.
   ``I turned around and saw that and I thought, `what in the name
of God is that,''' he remarked. ``I thought it was a blob from
outer space.
   ``It really scared the living daylights out of me.''
   A closer look, and one or two stings, revealed it to be an
unusually large wasp nest.
   ``It's one of the biggest ones I've ever seen,'' said Lyle E.
Klostermeyer, owner of Lyle's Entomological Service in Walla Walla.
