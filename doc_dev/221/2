<LEADPARA>  The people of Who-ville thought it was time -- for mean Mr. Grinch to pay for
his crime. But the Grinch said his holiday theft had a reason -- to restore
some spirit to the Christmas season.;   It's been 34 years since the Grinch
descended on Who-ville and maliciously stole Christmas presents, trees,
decorations and food, down to a crumb too small for even a mouse. On Thursday
he was on trial.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GRINCH NOT GUILTY, S.F. JUDGE RULES
'CHRISTMAS DOESN'T COME FROM STORE'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The tongue-in-cheek Court of Historical Review &amp; Appeals heard the case of
"The Grinch who Stole Christmas," the holiday story written by the late Dr.
Seuss. The Grinch, still pasty green with a mischievous grin, testified on his
own behalf.;   "I've been Seussed," he claimed.;   In the end, it was the
Grinch who prevailed. Municipal Judge George T. Choppelas found the Grinch not
guilty of charges of breaking and entering, grand theft and trespassing
because the statute of limitations for those crimes had passed.;   Choppelas
also found the Grinch not guilty of stealing Christmas, borrowing as his
inspiration a quote from the book: "Christmas doesn't come from a store.
Christmas means a little bit more."  </TEXT>
