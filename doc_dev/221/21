It's easy to make this a video holiday season. Christmas videos for children 
can be inexpensive and the great majority are animated. 
</P>
<P>
Many are put together poorly with lazy animation and silly songs. There are, 
however, some grand exceptions: 
</P>
<P>
Mickey's Christmas Carol (Disney tape and disc) has become a perennial 
favorite. It is a clever adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic retelling 
the story of Ebenezer Scrooge in amusing Disney terms: Scrooge McDuck (who 
else?) is the repentant miser; Mickey Mouse is Bob Cratchit; Goofy is Marley's 
Ghost; Black Pete is the Spirit of Christmas Future. 
</P>
<P>
You can't go wrong making it a Disney video Christmas. Very Merry Christmas 
Songs (Disney tape) is a genuine crowd pleaser with Mickey and the gang singing 
12 holiday favorites including "Deck the Halls" and "The 12 Days of Christmas." 
Other Disney releases include A Disney Christmas Gift, a collection of Yuletide 
scenes from a variety of Disney's animated classics; Jiminy Cricket's 
Christmas, a celebration with Pinocchio's pint-sized conscience and his friends 
(including Mickey, Peter Pan and Snow White), and A Walt Disney Christmas, six 
vintage Disney cartoons including "The Night Before Christmas" and "Pluto's 
Christmas Tree." 
</P>
<P>
After Disney's classic animation, everything seems to go downhill, although 
some may prefer the bite of Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, a 
faithful adaptation of the children's classic (MGM/UA tape). 
</P>
<P>
There's also a collection of seven classic cartoons from the 1930s and '40s 
called Christmas Comes but Once a Year (Shokus tape, less than $13), including 
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." A vintage 1952 "Howdy Doody" TV program, in 
which Howdy and Clarabell rescue Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, is an added 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Don't dismiss other feature-length cartoons because the animation seems 
amateurish next to the Disney product. Some are worth your children's time: 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (Paramount tape) is an unexpectedly superior 
adaptation of the Dickens tale with an original musical score by Jule Styne. 
This animated special should keep you and your children satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
George and the Christmas Star (Paramount tape) is an amusing story about a 
lonely man who wants to get a star out of the sky for his Christmas tree and 
comes back with a lot more than that, including the gift of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
A Charlie Brown Christmas (HiTops tape) is one of the popular TV productions 
based on Charles Schulz's cartoon strip. Poor Charlie Brown will make any child 
feel good about being him or herself. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas on Sesame Street (Random House tape) Big Bird, Bert, Ernie and the 
rest of the gang offer intelligent commentary, and there is a surprisingly 
moving adaptation of O'Henry's classic Christmas story "The Gift of the Magi." 
</P>
<P>
You're on your own with many animated specials featuring familiar cartoon 
characters (listed below). Only choose them if your children are particular 
fans of the character. Forget any of the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Casper's First Christmas" (Worldvision tape) has the friendly ghost joined by 
Yogi Bear, Boo Boo and Huckleberry Hound; "The Berenstein Bears' Christmas 
Tree" (Nelson tape) is typical stuff with Papa Bear trying to find the perfect 
tree; "Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Great Santa Claus Caper" (MPI tape); 
"B.C.-A Special Christmas" (Nelson tape) lives up to the cartoon strip's 
potential; "Glo Friends Save Christmas" (Vestron tape) is pretty routine stuff 
only for those who bought the toys featured in the made-for-TV special; 
"Christmas Comes to Pac-Land" (Goodtimes) has Pac-Man helping Santa Claus; 
"Rudolph's and Frosty's Christmas in July," "Frosty's Winter Wonderland and the 
Leprechaun's Gold" and "Rudolph's Shiny New Year" (Lightning Vestron tape) 
feature the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Snowman in pretty silly stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Other animated videos: "Silent Night" and "The Night Before Christmas" with the 
voices of the Obendorf Boys Choir (Media tape); "Pinocchio's Christmas" 
(Vestron tape) features the voice of Alan King; "Christmastime for Teddy 
Bears," a read-along video musical; "A Star for Jeremy" (Lorimar tape) explains 
why there is a star at the top of Christmas trees; "Snow White Christmas" 
(Prism tape) brings back a poorly animated Snow White who battles a poorly 
animated Evil -ueen so the kingdom can have a Merry Christmas; Calvin, Santa's 
elf, stars in "Santa's Christmas Elf" (United Entertainment tape); "A Christmas 
Tree" and "Puss-'n'-Boots" (Prism tape) and "Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny" 
(United Entertainment tape) are more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
If you are looking for the perfect Christmas present, one that reaffirms the 
closeness of family in the best holiday tradition, then there is really only 
one to choose: A Child's Christmas in Wales (Vestron tape). This is a 
sensitive, intelligent rendering of the Dylan Thomas memoir of a Christmas Eve 
spent with parents and grandfather. Denholm Elliott is a perfect guide, and the 
cast captures Thomas' words and memories with special grace and tender ness. 
It's a home video present for the entire family to view during the holidays 
because it affirms values of family, love and the spirit of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Another live-action Christmas video is Shari's Christmas Concert (Fries tape). 
This is a one-woman tour de force by ventriloquist Shari Lewis (with an 
important assist from puppet Lamb Chop). If adults sometimes believe that Lewis 
seems at times to suffer from a terminal case of cuteness, children still adore 
her. JOE SALTZMAN
