   The grinch that stole Christmas from a local
child this week also had a few beers and bologna sandwiches.
   Billy Felingiere told police someone broke through a rear window
of his apartment between 3:30 p.m. and 6:45 p.m. Monday.
   The intruder ate several bologna sandwiches, drank three 16-ounce
beers and left through the front door.
   The only other thing stolen was a child's Splish-Splash set from
beneath the Christmas tree.
   ``Burglary is not baloney,'' mused police Sgt. Steve Haines.
``But we suspect a hungry and thirsty thief who likes Bobby Darin
music.''
   Darin recorded the 1950s hit, ``Splish, Splash.''
