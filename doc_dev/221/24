<HEAD>Police Officers Play Santa After Grinch Steals Christmas</HEAD>

   Police didn't catch the Grinch, so they
played Santa instead.
   Christmas Day dawned dark and awful for Neona and Dan Calovich
when they returned from her parents' home to find a thief had
kicked in a door to their house.
   The home was ransacked. Thieves even took gifts placed under the
Christmas tree for the couple's two young sons.
   But then officers, dispatchers, jailers and other police
employees arrived bearing gifts.
   ``It has been a very emotion-filled day, a most overwhelmingly
happy Christmas,'' Mrs. Calovich said.
   Officer David Gilgour, who had taken the family's burglary
report, thought of the couple's sons, ages 3 and 18 months, and of
his own 4-year-old boy.
   ``I know how hurt he'd be without any presents,'' Gilgour said.
``And how I would feel myself if I couldn't provide a Christmas for
him.''
   Gilgour radioed police dispatcher Jane Smitka and suggested the
department help the family. By the time he returned to the station,
teddy bears, toy trucks and cars, turkeys, cash and other gifts
were pouring in.
   ``The stuff came from their individual homes,'' police Capt. Don
Huntsinger said. ``In some cases, I suspect, from their own
Christmases.''
