<TEXT>  Today is your day.; You're off to Great Places!; You're off and away!; From
"Oh, the Places You'll Go!"; by Dr. Seuss, 1990, Random House; THEODOR Seuss
Geisel sent millions off to great places in five decades of fanciful
storytelling. Forays into a house stained pink by the antics of a cat in a
hat, trips into a jungle where an elephant named Horton hatches an egg, visits
into a town where a Grinch steals Christmas . . .;   And despite Geisel's
death on Tuesday, the tongue-twisting tales of this literary trail-blazer will
no doubt delight generations to come.;   "He's constantly popular," says
Cherry Lyon, owner of the If Wishes Were Horses bookstore in Palo Alto. "His
books are classics. People want to buy them for their kids because they
enjoyed them as children.";   "He was really a pioneer," says Betsy Hearne,
editor of the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books at the University of
Chicago. "He brought a lot of levity to children's literature. That was his
great gift."; (hbox);   You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.; 
 You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.; (hbox);   Geisel's
books were not always highly thought of by the literary establishment. Geisel
once said his first book, "And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street," was
rejected by 28 publishing houses because it was too different from other
children's books then on the market.;   "He went through a long period of
being a bit condescended to by the children's-literature critical
establishment," says John Donovan, president of the Children's Book Council, a
New York-based national trade association of children's book publishers. "For
a long time, there was a kind of dismissive view of him because he was too
popular . . . and because his vocabulary was so simple. But as time has worn
on, they've done a complete about-face.";   Susan Denniston, in charge of
children's services for the Sunnyvale Public Library, credits Geisel for being
one of the first to bring causes such as ecological awareness to children.;  
" 'The Lorax,' which is about the felling of trees, was written at the
beginning of the environmental movement," she says of the book first published
in 1971.;   Lyon, owner of If Wishes Were Horses, agrees that Geisel's
strength was delivering important messages in a light-hearted, even silly,
way. But she says other Dr. Seuss books were great as first readers.;   " 'Hop
on Pop' is terrific for teaching reading," she says. "The words rhyme, the
type is big, and the pictures are very descriptive of what the words are
saying. It teaches reading in a very fun way."; (hbox);   I'm sorry to say so;
  but, sadly, it's true;   that Bang-ups;   and Hang-ups;   can happen to
you.; (hbox);   Even Geisel's fans admit that not all his works were
masterpieces. "The Butter Battle Book," an anti-nuclear-war fable, is often
criticized for being too heavy-handed.;   Others have criticized the
cartoonish artwork, with glob-like, goofy creatures that might seem scary to
young children.;   But Shirley Skellenger, a children's librarian at San
Jose's main library, says most kids enjoy the trademark Seuss surreal images,
the plays on words, the constant repetition.;   Of course, part of Geisel's
success lay in his ability to enthrall adult readers as well as youngsters.
Those interviewed say Dr. Seuss -- ever popular for half a century -- no doubt
will be remembered for sending anyone who was willing off to great places.;
(hbox);   And will you succeed?;   Yes! You will, indeed!;   (98 and 3/4
percent guaranteed.)  </TEXT>
