   The grinch didn't steal Christmas, just
the decorations on mailboxes in a neighborhood here.
   ``It's not so much the value, it's just the time that went into
it,'' said C.J. Redmond, who lives in the Cherokee Village
subdivision.
   A small, ceramic Santa Claus that Redmond and his wife, Louise,
had used for their children nearly 40 years ago was one of the
decorations yanked from their mailbox.
   Thieves struck Sunday night or early Monday, snatching bows,
candy canes and other trinkets decorating mailboxes and trees,
police said.
   ``Instead of being angry about it, you get sick. The whole
neighborhood is trying to ... show camaraderie,'' said Judy Petty,
whose candy canes and red bows were stolen.
   Decorating mailboxes for Christmas was the idea of the Cherokee
Village Garden Club, a member said. The neighborhood mail carrier
was to have judged the decorations this week.
