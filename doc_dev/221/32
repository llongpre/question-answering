   Ah, December. Time to turn on the television and
get set for those wonderful, warm-hearted holiday specials.
   But what's this? Pee-Wee Herman and Grace Jones? The Brady Bunch
with gray hair? John Denver schmoozing in upscale Aspen?
   It's not that bad, really. Selective viewers can pick through the
junk like so much wrapping paper to find some gems this month.
   For instance, Jason Robards and Julie Harris star in ``HBO
Showcase: The Christmas Wife,'' a different kind of Christmas story
about two lonely strangers. And for those who like holidays with
wry, there's ``Season's Greetings,'' a comedy on the Arts &amp;
Entertainment Network written by British playwright Alan Ayckbourn.
On PBS, the King's Singers from England appear in concert with the
Kansas City Symphony in what promises to be a very special special.
   Here is a list of December holiday fare:
   Various times throughout the month: ``The Nutcracker,'' PBS. The
Tchaikovsky ballet performed by Mikhail Baryshnikov and the American
Ballet Theatre premiered in 1976 and has become a TV classic.
   Dec. 10: ``The Care Bears' Nutcracker Suite,'' The Disney
Channel. The Care Bears go to Toyland to rescue the Sugarplum Fairy.
Strictly for those who prefer jelly beans to Christmas dinner.

Burton are reunited as Fiddler and Kunte Kinte for whom Christmas
means a chance for freedom.
   Dec. 12: ``HBO Showcase: The Christmas Wife,'' HBO.
   Dec. 12: ``I'll Be Home for Christmas,'' NBC. Eva Marie Saint and

   Dec. 13: ``Miss Ruby's Southern Holiday Dinner,'' PBS. Pearl
Bailey, Annie Potts, Roy Blount Jr. and Craig Claiborne join New
York restaurateur Ruth Adams Bronz of Miss Ruby's Cafe for down-home
cooking and conversation.
   Dec. 17: ``Bob Hope's Jolly Christmas Show With the All-America
Champs,'' NBC. Hope's annual holiday special, this time from Florida
and featuring the usual oddball array of guests: Dolly Parton, Don
Johnson, Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith Joyner, Dodgers
pitcher Orel Hershiser and The Associated Press All-America Football
team.
   Let it wash over you, or try going out.
   Dec. 18: ``A Very Brady Christmas,'' CBS. Reunites the family
that has achieved cult status in syndicated reruns. Snap out of it!

surprisingly good movie starring Keshia Knight Pulliam (``The Cosby
Show'') in the title role.

it from the BMW, dahling.
   Dec. 20: ``Frosty the Snowman,'' CBS. The 1969 animated

Schwarzenegger, Danny De Vito, Barbara Mandrell, Mike Tyson and
members of the Kennedy family celebrate Christmas with retarded
children who participate in Special Olympics.

   Elsewhere in television:
   MORE SETS, SETS ON MORE; OR, END OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION,
CONTINUED _ Americans average seven hours of television viewing a
day, or at least that's how long the average set is on, according to
a recent report by the A.C. Nielsen Co. Ten years ago, the set was
on an average of 6 hours and 13 minutes a day. In 1951, when only 9
percent of U.S. homes had televisions, the sets were on an average
of 4 hours and 43 minutes a day. Today, Nielsen estimates 904,000
U.S. households have televisions.
