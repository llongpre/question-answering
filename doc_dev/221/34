   A dispute is wending its way through the German courts on the question of stollen. 
This is a German Christmas cake. 
The lumpy loaf full of raisins, butter and almonds -- and covered with white powdery sugar -- holds an incontestable place on tables in Germany during the Christmas season. 
Now East German bakeries are going to West Germany's top court to argue that capitalist competitors have stolen their stollen. 

   Stollen's traditional source is the Saxon town of Dresden, whose ovens for six centuries have produced the loaves. 
Stollen grew scarce during the war, when Germany lacked the butter to produce it. 
The cake's revival has been brought about not only by the new state bakers in Dresden but also by West German bakers, who make what they call "Dresden stollen." 
Germans have given the item a world-wide popularity -- the West German baker B. Wendeln sells 150,000 of the calorie bombs each yule. 

   An East German baking cooperative, Backwaren Kombinat Dresden, is charging that West German firms mislead when they call their product "Dresden stollen." 
They've moved to stop the old Munich bakery Rischart from producing the cakes. 
They've also challenged five other Western stollen makers, though cookery lore shows Dresden stollen has been made outside Dresden since 1650. 
A 1936 standard work describes stollen as "baked goods from German regions." 
Some East German dictionary publishers recognize that the word "Dresden" is more a part of the cake's name than an indication of its origins. 

   The East Germans could be raising queries they don't want to carry to the logical conclusion. 
If stollen really is a trademark, who is the rightful owner? 
Maybe it's the original inventor's heirs. 
In short, if anyone has stolen stollen it may well be the Marxists. 
And if that's the case, someone ought to see whether they're the ones who also stole East Germany's Christmas.
