Dylan Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales" is not a Yule postcard, dripping 
with sentiment. It's a poet's vivid evocation of a jubilant boyhood Christmas 
Day spent with his large family in Swansea, South Wales. But you would reap 
many more rewards if you read the story this season rather than endure Troupe 
America's touring production. 
</P>
<P>
This bus-and-truck company from Minneapolis is faithful to the story but not to 
its spirit. Christmas here leaves you logy, as in too much turkey. The 15 
actors and the handful of props -- a hearth, a huge Christmas tree, a piano, a 
bar -- get lost on a cavernous stage. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the story's lure is more apparent at other theaters. But Beckman 
Auditorium at Caltech, where the show was seen Saturday, is not a dramatic 
venue. It's an orchestral and concert stage. A feast like "A Child's Christmas 
in Wales" gets swallowed up there, nullifying its ebullience. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset the production seemed chilly, and it only recovered near the 
end when the actors playing Thomas' family, his chums and colorful relatives, 
captured for a warm moment your own cheeriest Christmas memories. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' literary achievement is a Puckish menu of language and imagery 
embracing a morning's frolic in the snow, the unwrapping of presents and the 
gathering of the clan and the family dinner. Everyone is indeed a character. 
</P>
<P>
The story's language is painterly, suggesting those vibrant Christmas scenes 
with the family racing through the vast decorated house in Ingmar Bergman's 
"Fanny and Alexander." 
</P>
<P>
But proceedings at Beckman had the sluggish pace of real life -- that meant 
lots of dead spaces and pauses that deflated the work's buoyancy. Also some of 
the accents and the diction were unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Troupe America, for the most part, did catch the flavor of the '20s. The 
singing was fetching, and the actors playing the Dylan Thomas roles were 
convincing (Bernard Marks as the older Dylan looking back on his childhood and 
Larry Dean Birkett as young Dylan). But too many grinches stole Noel. Even the 
tree seemed bare of ornaments, and Dylan's dearly longed-for new red bike was, 
of all things, a contemporary model.
