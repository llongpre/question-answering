   Barbara Bush ascended 35 feet aboard a bumpy
hydraulic boom on Thursday and placed the crowning ornament atop the
National Christmas Tree, a Colorado blue spruce just beyond the back
fence of the house she'll move into next month.
   It was the eighth consecutive year the wife of the vice president
has performed that task, and one she apparently doesn't want to give
up when husband George's title is shortened. ``It's the only thing
I've done more than anyone else,'' she told a guest in a reception
line afterwards. ``I love it.''
   To a separate guest she said ``I would be offended if someone
else did it.''
   President Reagan is to light the live national tree for his last
time Dec. 15, after which a pageant featuring 57 trees, each
decorated with ornaments from a different state or territory, will
be opened. More than 700,000 people visited the exhibit last year.
   The tree was transplanted to its spot on the Ellipse, a park
betwen the White House and the Washington Monument, in 1978 after
two earlier trees died before taking root.
   Two classes of Washington first-graders applauded and cheered as
Mrs. Bush had an animated chat with puppet dinosaurs Rex and Rita
Readasaurus and Pageant Director Joe Riley as they rode the boom
basket skyward.
   ``It was a shakey ride,'' said Lynn Hippen who was crouched down
in the boom box with puppet designer Brad Williams, ``but everyone
maintained their balance and poise.''
   The puppets, Williams said, were ``hatched'' at the National Zoo
in May to promote the national Reading is Fundamental program. He
said they and Mrs. Bush talked about the ride and the children
below, who included two of Mrs. Bush's grandchildren, twins Barbara
and Jenna Bush.
   ``Has anyone read `The Grinch Who Stole Christmas?''' Mrs. Bush
asked the youngsters after coming down from the tree.
   ``I saw it on TV,'' one child said.
   ``It's better if you read it,'' Mrs. Bush said.
