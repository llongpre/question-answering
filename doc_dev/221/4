<LEADPARA>  MAKING HOUSECALLS: Theodor Geisel, a.k.a. "Dr. Seuss," died last week at age
87, after publishing 47 books in a career spanning more than half a century.
Many of his wonderful, wacky works were converted to cartoons over the years,
and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Doctor even created a couple of items
specifically for film.;   Here is a checklist of his inspired insanity
available on tape, listed in order of personal preference. And as a final
tribute, let us suggest that these videos be used as a starting point, to
return kids to the books the Good Doctor himself helped us learn to read.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  VIDEO  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     (box) "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" (MGM/UA). Boris Karloff narrates
this animated holiday evergreen about the conversion of a reverse Santa --
"Anti-Claus"? -- which was directed by Chuck Jones. A masterful collaboration
of three top talents, and a seamless blending of cartoon comedy and serious
sentiments. (This half-hour entry is available individually for sale, and also
can be found for rent on the earlier cassette, "Dr. Seuss: Horton Hears a Who
&amp; How the Grinch Stole Christmas.");   (box) "The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T."
(1953; MGM/UA; rated G). Seuss' only feature film, this fantasy concerns a
young piano student and his sinister teacher Dr. Terwilliger (Hans Conried).
Dr. S. wrote the script for "Dr. T." and influenced the art design of this
off-kilter comedy.;   (box) "Gerald McBoing-Boing" (1951; on the Columbia Home
Video cassette "Columbia Pictures Cartoon Classics"). Seuss won an Oscar for
this animated short, an allegory about uniqueness, featuring a youngster who
speaks only in sound effects. Very difficult to locate, but worth the effort.;
  A number of other Seuss stories currently are available for sale on tape,
including a 30-minute adaptation of "The Butter Battle Book" (Turner), an
allegory about the arms race, and an entire series of "Beginner Books" videos
from Random House Video, each of which features a well-known book ("Hop on
Pop"; "One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish") and two lesser-known shorts.;
  Older titles still available for rent at some video stores include:;   (box)
"The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat/Pontoffel Pock" (MGM/UA), the first a
lesson in manners; the latter, the story of a boy and his magical piano.;  
(box) "The Lorax/Hoober Bloob Highway" (MGM/UA), two made-for-TV cartoons. The
first concerns the environment, the second, a lesson in self-worth.;   (box)
"The Cat in the Hat/Dr. Seuss on the Loose" (MGM/UA), a collection of animated
entries, featuring Seuss' primer for young readers and a series of shorts
(including my own favorite, "Green Eggs and Ham").;   HOME ALONE -- AND SAFE:
Congratulations to Movies to Go, a Des Moines video store chain, for turning
the video release of "Home Alone" into an opportunity to provide a helpful
community service.;   In conjunction with the Iowa State Patrol, the
nine-store chain is distributing 5,000 copies of a "Tips for When You're Home
Alone" checklist for latchkey kids. The card has spaces for important
emergency phone numbers as well as a list of safety rules, including "Never
tell a caller your parents aren't home" and "Never open the door for a
stranger."  </TEXT>
