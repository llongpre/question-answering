<TEXT>
   A grinch stole Easter in this
western Colorado city by swiping 300 eggs that had been hidden in
three city parks for egg hunts sponsored by two local businesses.
   ``There were all these little kids and their mothers walking
around with empty Easter baskets,'' said Marilynn Sinclair, who
took her young nephew to Hawthorne Park Friday morning. ``It was
sad.''
   The sponsors planned to try again with egg hunts at the same
three parks today and Sunday morning.
   They set a maximum age limit of 13 and decided to be on the
lookout for early egg thieves.
