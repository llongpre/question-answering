   A decision to enforce an 11-year-old health
ordinance on a charitable group's functions has members scrambling
to provide a Christmas meal for thousands of hungry Houston
residents.
   Last week, the Health Department started requiring the Citywide
Club of Clubs to follow an ordinance that requires food served to
the public to be prepared at a city-approved kitchen, just in time
to cause problems for the group's annual Thanksgiving feast for the
needy.
   The private, non-profit community service organization has
relied heavily in the past on donations of home-prepared food _
turkey, hams, dressing, vegetables, desserts, relishes _ to pull
off its annual Thanksgiving and Christmas feasts, club Director
Leroy Woodward said Tuesday.
   Last week, because of the new enforcement, volunteers faced with
a record 60,000 people for Thanksgiving ran out of food three or
four times, and only the hasty barbecuing of 500 chickens saved the
day, he said.
   ``Now you can't get through our main telephone lines because of
all the needy people calling up to make reservations for our annual
Christmas feast on Dec. 23,'' said Woodward. ``And we're scared.
We're afraid we're not going to be able to feed all these folks.''
   Joe Zuchlewski, a health department official, was unable to
explain why the group wasn't required to meet the ordinance until
this year.
   ``We appreciate all the work that the Citywide Club is doing in
feeding all these people but, by the same token, we want to make
sure the food is safe,'' said Zuchlewski. ``We're just trying to
protect the public.''
   Health department officials will gladly work with club members
to make sure they know how to conduct their feast according to
regulations, Zuchlewski said.
   ``There are all kinds of items that can be donated that will
satisfy people on the street and satisfy the health code,''
Zuchlewski said. The department cited such things as canned
vegetables or frozen turkeys.
   Woodward is worried, but he hesitates to slam the health
department.
   ``They gave us their reason and we understand. If people even
put harmful things in trick or treat candy, we understand the
potential problem of letting people bring prepared food,'' he said.
   ``But even though we understand, we're still left with the
problem of feeding all those hungry people.''
   In addition to feeding the hungry and needy, the club last year
distributed 12,000 donated toys to children and registered more
than 7,000 people for jobs and housing.
