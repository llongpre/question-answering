<LEADPARA>  IT IS the day before Christmas, 1991, and most of us are again involved in our
annual delusion that giving gifts and whooping it up make us better people.
This is a time for reflection for a society that finds it necessary to pass
out condoms to high school students, to mass-produce handguns and refuse to
increase control of them, and to wallow in ugly accusations against a nominee
to the Supreme Court of the United States.;   We remain a society rich with
contradiction and poor in resolve. If one man is murdered, the perpetrator is
a villain. Murder a dozen, the military decorates you as a hero. Murder a
million and you go down in the annals of history as a world leader.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I suppose that we should all be thinking happy thoughts because it's
Christmastime. But what are we supposed to do with truth? Are we to deny
reality for a week? During the rest of the year they put people in mental
hospitals for doing that.;   Even a filmed message from President Bush or the
mayor does not fill me with joy at what I see. No, I am not suggesting that we
all walk around with our heads hanging in despair. What I do suggest is that
we hold our heads up high and return to the real meaning of Christmas.;  
While we are collecting new clothes, flashy toys and fine cars, we should
pause to recall that this should be the season for renewed dedication to the
principles of love and respect for all of us.;   This is the time to resolve
to end child abuse, wife-battering, worldwide hunger and corruption. This is
the moment to commit to the handicapped, to recall the great teachings of
Mohandas Gandhi, Henry David Thoreau and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
The way to renewal is to begin with our individual selves.;   Christmas has
become no more than an opportunity to broaden our materialism. Many families
strain their budgets each December because they are too embarrassed or too
insecure to face their loved ones with empty hands even though their hearts
are full.;   Long ago my family abandoned gift-giving at Christmas. What
provided us with greater pleasure was the meaning of the gift of life and the
inherent value of every man, woman and child on this planet.;   For several
years we rebelled at the encroaching commercialism of Christmas. Though my
children, now adults, did not join the celebration through gift-giving, they
are slipping back into that flawed routine. Now that they are on their own I
suppose the magnetism of holiday merchants is too irresistible, the lure of
pipe organs too great for them to withstand. But Christmas means far more to
me than a new football, a fancy camera or an outrageous tie.;   All year long,
we offend one another's deepest sensibilities. We engage in unkind deeds,
dishonest acts, and then at Christmas we rush out and spend billions on toys,
household furnishings, fancy automobiles and other gifts, while not far from
our homes, our neighbors exist yearlong on starvation diets.;   In our
kindness we seldom forget the poor entirely. Generally, we remember by sending
a $5 toy to some child languishing in loneliness in some institution. Too
often such a child spends time hoping he or she will be adopted and finally
have a family, a hug and a home.;   Each year, with predictable regularly, we
learn of those delivering food baskets to the poor and hungry. This is a kind
act, but who helped those same needy families on March 1, or June 20, or Aug.
6, when hunger was just as real and Christmas was many months off?;   All year
long we step over men and women and children lying on sidewalks and steam
vents as we hurry off to nowhere. Many of us have grown so used to these
prostrate forms, we no longer even see them.;   I can no longer rejoice over a
wrapped gift at Christmas while blacks and whites, Asians, Hispanics, Indians
and others -- all Americans -- are at each others' throats. It is also
difficult for me to put aside the problems of world hunger, the violence
between nations, the deadly trap of drug and alcohol addiction, the ineptness
of the White House and Congress and of local government and the transgressions
we have grown used to.;   I am not religious but I am very respectful. And it
is because of this respect that I no longer dwell on materialism. It pains me
that every year most of us go off on a commercial binge on the birth date of a
man named Jesus Christ who was born in a stable, offered Is life to those who
would accept it and died in a plain garment on a rough wooden cross.;   I
refuse to trade what he represents for Santa Claus, Rudolph the reindeer, or
"The Grinch Who Stole Christmas."  </TEXT>
