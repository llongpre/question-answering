   Stung by cries of ``grinch,'' planning
commissioners are trying to write some yuletide spirit into an
ordinance that inadvertently made lawbreakers out of most of the
city's Christmas tree dealers.
   The city's building inspections department presented eviction
notices earlier this month to 14 of the 17 outdoor Christmas tree
dealers in this Grand Rapids' suburb, including the Wyoming Park
High School Band Boosters.
   The evictions resulted from an ordinance enacted last summer to
ban outdoor sales.
   ``When we passed that ordinance, frankly, no one thought about
Christmas trees,'' Gerald Mears, head of Wyoming's planning and
inspections departments, told planning commissioners Tuesday.
   The dealers were told to clear the trees off their lots or pay a
$110 application for a zoning variance, prompting Councilman Edward
Frederick to call Mears a ``Grinch.''
   At their latest meeting, the council ordered that all Christmas
tree dealers should be left alone this year and that new language
allowing their continued operation be written into the law.
   ``It was not our intention to stop Christmas,'' said Councilman
Michel Hill.

   How do you wrap a Christmas pickle? And
what about the pressing problem of wrapping an ironing board in a
pretty holiday package?
   Those were just some of the dilemmas that faced the volunteers
this year at a gift-wrapping booth in the North Platte Mall.
   ``We've done a dill pickle, an ironing board, a boat ladder and
an ornamental yard windmill,'' said Eva Weber, a volunteer at the
booth run by the North Platte Church of God.
   By the time the booth closes on Christmas Eve, the 15 volunteers
from the tiny congregation of 35 will have wrapped an estimated
2,000 packages.
   ``We use about 6,000 bows over Christmas,'' said Sheri Clark,
whose husband, Bob, is the minister of the church.
   Proceeds from the booth provide the church with money for
community and mission work.
   The volunteers said an important part of their job is to
``scrounge the Dumpsters'' for odd-sized boxes.
   ``We want the finished product to look professional. We take a
lot of pride in how we do the job,'' Mrs. Weber said.
   Even that special Christmas pickle.

   Roy Collette will need a jackhammer and a
torch this year to open the annual Christmas gag gift of a
2-decade-old pair of moleskin pants from his brother-in-law Larry
Kunkel.
   The gift was delivered to his home Saturday in this southeastern
Minnesota city via flatbed semi-truck in a concrete-filled container
resembling a space capsule.
   As the truck moved slowly up the street, Collette acknowledged he
was in for a heavy job of unwrapping.
   ``There are three axles underneath the trailer. That tells you
something,'' he said, calling the whole business ``foolishness.''
   Kunkel and his crew of six volunteers spent 45 minutes unloading
the gift by crane and setting it upright in the driveway.
   Collette merely repeated: ``He's gonna pay for this one.''
   The ``package'' weighs several tons, stands more than 12 feet
high, measures 8 feet in diameter and comes with a U.S. flag.
Printed on the capsule, which is actually the barrel of a concrete
mixer, are the words ``United States Command Module Roy ``88.''
   The moleskin pants, circa 1964, are in a gas can somewhere inside.
   They've plagued the brothers-in-law for more than 20 years. They
originated as a gift to Kunkel from his mother. He discovered the
cotton, fake suede pants stiffened in cold weather and gave them to
Collette, who found them just as unappealing.
   Collette wrapped them up and returned them to Kunkel one
Christmas and the exchange continued each year until Collette
packaged them in a bucket of cement. But Kunkel managed to extract
them.
   The packaging has become increasingly elaborate as the men try to
out-wrap each other.
   Last year, the brothers-in-law agreed to end the prank. They were
going to tie the pants to the trunks of their vehicles, split them
in half and burn them. But Collette added a twist. With a slip of
the rope, the pants went sailing off, fully intact, behind Kunkel's
vehicle.
