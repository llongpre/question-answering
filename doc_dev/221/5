Stole Christmas," has died. He was 87.;   Geisel died Tuesday night at his
home in La Jolla, and his family was at his bedside, said his 33-year-old

<TEXT>     He wrote and illustrated 47 books, selling more than 100 million copies in
18 languages. He was awarded a 1984 Pulitzer Prize for his contribution to
children's literature.;   His works seemed like journeys into nonsense,
magical worlds of truffula trees, green eggs and ham, ziffs and zuffs and
nerkles and nerds, where top-hatted cats run rampant through youngsters' homes
while goldfish scold.;   But they often included subtle messages on issues
important to him, from internationalism to environmentalism.;   When asked two
weeks ago whether he had any final message, a valedictory, Geisel told the San
Diego Union: "Whenever things go a bit sour in a job I'm doing, I always tell
myself: 'You can do better than this.' The best slogan I can think of to leave
with the U.S.A. would be: 'We can do and we've got to do better than this.' ";
  In his 1984 best-seller, "The Butter Battle Book," Geisel offered a parable
for the atomic age. It chronicled the escalating arms race between the Yooks,
who eat their bread butter side down, and the Zooks, who do just the
opposite.;   It ends with the two sides at the Yook-Zook border, each armed
with the ultimate weapon -- a Big-Boy Boomeroo bomb.;   A boy asks his
grandpa, "Who's going to drop it. Will you? Will he?";   "Be patient," grandpa
says. "We'll see. We will see.";   Geisel was childless himself -- after his
first wife's death in 1967, he married Audrey Stone Diamond, a mother of two
-- but had an unrivaled gift for delighting children.;   "You make 'em; I
amuse 'em," he said.;   Born March 2, 1904, in Springfield, Mass., son of a
brewer who ran a zoo for a time during Prohibition, Geisel graduated in 1925
from Dartmouth, where he drew cartoons for the humor magazine, Jack-O-Lantern.
He later studied in England and drifted to Paris, where he mingled with Lost
Generation writers such as Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce and Gertrude Stein.; 
 He returned to the United States in 1927 to marry Helen Palmer and to pursue
his hope of being a novelist. But the Great Depression forced him to put the
great American novel on hold, and he went to work writing two-line gags for
Judge and Life, both humor magazines at the time.;   It was on a spoof of
scientific developments that he first used the name that would become his
trademark. He added "Dr." to his middle name to sound more scientific.;   "I
wrote my first children's book because my exclusive contract forbade me from
doing virtually anything else in the world," he said. That book was ". . . And
to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street," penned on a ship crossing the
Atlantic. He said that the words, strung together in the sing-song style that
became his trademark, were written to the rhythm of the ship's engine.;  
"Mulberry Street" was published in 1937, the same year as his first adult
novel, "The Seven Lady Godivas." The children's book, rejected by 27
publishers before being accepted by Vanguard Press, became a spectacular
success. His novel was a commercial dud.;   Children liked his writing because
he treated them as equals, Geisel often said. His illustrations were another
matter. His creatures often looked like stuffed animals missing much of their
sawdust.;   Through the 1950s, he wrote a couple of children's books a year,
capped in 1957 by the publication of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas and "The
Cat in the Hat.";   "Grinch," made into a cartoon with Boris Karloff reading
the title role, was a stark critique of the commercialism that had befallen
Christmas, a 20th century version of Dickens' "A Christmas Carol.";   "The Cat
in the Hat" revolutionized children's reading habits.;   "That is what I am
proudest of; that I had something to do with getting rid of Dick and Jane,"
Geisel said in 1982.;   Of all his books, though, "The Lorax" was his
favorite.;   Written in 1971, "The Lorax" was about a brown mossy creature who
tries in vain to protect the truffula trees from the Onceler, who chops them
down with abandon to make "thneeds." Then one day, relates the Onceler, "all
that was left 'neath the bad-smelling sky was my big empty factory, the Lorax
and I.";   Geisel ended the environmental saga, however, with a message of
hope to his readers -- a single truffula tree seed survived.;   Geisel is
survived by his wife, Audrey, two stepdaughters, Lea and Lark, his niece,
Peggy Owens, and her son Theodore Owens, of Los Angeles.  </TEXT>
