   Some of New York's toniest eateries got a taste of
Christmas past this week, a reminder of days when Scrooge was
fiction, not economic reality.
   The restaurants, which include such famous dining spots as
Tavern on the Green, the Palm and Cafe Des Artistes, are
members of a group of about 200 businesses that were never
reimbursed for $5.5 million of Visa and Mastercard receipts
from December 1986.

   Under a settlement approved this week by a New York state
judge, the businesses will be getting $4.5 million from
Bowery Savings Bank, the New York bank through which the
credit card receipts were submitted to Mastercard
International Inc. and Visa USA Inc.
   The grinch that almost stole the 1986 Christmas season was
Chargeit Inc., a now-defunct New York ticket agency that also
served as a credit-card clearinghouse for the 200 firms.
According to court papers, Chargeit cashed the credit card
receipts at Bowery Savings Bank. But the checks Chargeit in
turn wrote to the businesses, which also include Radio City
Music Hall, the Philadelphia Academy of Music and Mama
Leone's Inc., bounced.
   In December 1986, Chargeit filed for bankruptcy court
protection. After secured creditors were paid, there wasn't
any money left to cover the bounced checks. So, in 1988, the
restaurants and other businesses sued Bowery, which is based
in New York, even though the bank had already paid Chargeit
for the receipts.
   "The legal theory was that the Bowery was responsible for
its agent," said Howard Comet, the attorney for the bank. He
said that the settlement wouldn't affect his client
significantly.
   The settlement is "a nice Christmas present," said Steven
W. Scher, an attorney at Anderson Kill Olick &amp; Oshinksy who
represented the businesses.
   The present comes when restaurant business in New York and
other cities is off.
   "The end of the '80s were better days," said James Longo,
chief financial officer of Palm Management Corp., which runs
the Palm restaurant, a steakhouse near the United Nations.
Mr. Longo said the Palm was owed about $42,000, the
equivalent of about three days' business, from the December
1986 receipts.
