   Far from getting into the holiday spirit, Wall Street traders these days are behaving like the grinch that stole Christmas. 

   It used to be common to find investors with spare cash taking a flier on stocks that might gain from the seasonal shopping frenzy that overtook even reasonable people. 
Makers and merchants of Atari video games, Tiffany jewelry, Sony videocassette recorders and Moet &amp; Chandon champagne all found boosters in Christmases past. 
Even now, one money manager argues that jet-set leather goods and the bubbly might be good Christmas plays. 

   But there's little bullishness around. 
Retailers generally expect sales only 2% to 3% above 1987's post-crash levels, adjusted for inflation. 
It seems that about the only investors seeking Christmas plays are short sellers: They're monitoring selected retailing bonds and stocks for signs their prices might fall. 

   Petrie Stores would have been a good short. 
Yesterday, the stock dived 3 1/2 to 15 1/2 after Milton Petrie, the chairman, decided not to take the company private. 

   In a season bereft of blockbuster toys, popular short candidates include shares of Toys 'R' Us, Mattel and Universal Matchbox Group. 
With women's clothing in the doldrums, some investors are shorting junk bonds of Federated Department Stores, Allied Stores, Carter Hawley Hale and R.H. Macy. 

   Investors are watching retailing chains for "signs of pre-Christmas discounting or deeper discounting on regular sales," says Edwin McClendon, a junk-bond analyst at Dean Witter. 

   Of course, for Christmas shorts to work, there must be nasty surprises. 
But apparel retailers appear less vulnerable to slow sales than in 1987 because inventories are low, says Joseph Ellis, a Goldman Sachs analyst. 

   Still, bears think 1988's Christmas might be highly "promotional," with steep discounting that would hurt profit. 
Even now, the cash flows of Federated, owned by Robert Campeau, provide relatively thin coverage of debt charges, says one analyst. 
"The last thing they need is a complicated Christmas. 
They're going to have to sell assets in this weak environment and make big cost reductions." 

   Traders say the best retailing bonds to short are Federated's 16% debentures due 2000, which had a troublesome birth recently and have since slipped below par value. 

   Michael Murphy, publisher of San Francisco's Overpriced Stock Service, says Toys 'R' Us stock is "a reliable short every Christmas" although "they don't have bad sales." 
Management imposes a sort of "news blackout" on analysts in the Christmas season, he says, so nobody knows what's happening and "there are always rumors" that hurt the stock. 
For instance, "Somebody goes and counts cars in the parking lots outside their stores and says there are fewer cars than last year," he says, giving shorts "a chance to cover" their exposure at lower prices. 

   There's a theory that in the absence of any standout toys, more parents will roam the well-stocked aisles of Toys 'R' Us supermarkets. 
But some people think it's a bearish sign that Toys 'R' Us managers sold company stock this fall. 

   Yesterday, Standard &amp; Poor's analyst Paul Valentine put sell recommendations on shares of toy makers Mattel and Universal Matchbox, which have had good gains. 
The companies "don't have any major hits this year" to sustain the momentum, he says. 

   Overall, he thinks holiday toy sales will be disappointing. 
Kids' emerging passion for "low-tech" toys -- such as Hasbro's Dolly Surprise, with hair that grows -- won't completely offset soft video-game sales, he says. 
"Big losers" from the waning of video games are Atari and Tonka, which distributes Sega products, he says. 

   No matter how Christmas sales go, Mr. Ellis likes Gap Inc., which reported strong third-quarter profit last week. 
It's drawing crowds since switching from unisex to "more feminine and stylish" women's wear, "with rayon and sheer fabrics and special collar details on cardigan sweaters," he says. 
New merchandise will show up soon in Gap's lagging Banana Republic unit, he adds. 

   Gap, at 36 1/4 yesterday, has a price-earnings multiple about 25% higher than the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 shares. 
But Mr. Ellis thinks its 1989 profit might be surprisingly strong. 
He thinks Limited, after stumbling, "may be back on its long-term growth track." 

   Mr. Murphy is touting Good Guys, which retails consumer electronics. 
It's among the cheaper retailing stocks, has high sales per square foot and might be a buy-out candidate, he says. 
He thinks VCRs, big-screen televisions and headphones might ensure "a good Christmas for electronics." 

   Mr. Valentine likes Lewis Galoob Toys' Bouncin' Babies that crawl and Micro Machines, miniature cars and planes. 
"They're rebounding from a disastrous 1987 with two of the hottest products."
