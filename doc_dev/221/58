<LEADPARA>  CHANCES are you know someone whose home has been ransacked and robbed by
burglars during a holiday season. And, chances are, the homeowner's neglect
helped the burglar pull it off.;   'Tis the season for punks to prowl and
homeowners to get carelessly preoccupied with the holidays. The recession also
has led more people to burgle, rob and steal what they can't buy.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     San Jose police blame a 34 percent increase in burglaries this year on the
recession, but suggest that residents can do their part to help prevent
criminal Grinches from stealing Christmas.;   "It does go up this time of year
just because people aren't careful. They leave boxes and presents under the
tree and don't keep them out of sight. Especially if they are away from home,"
says Sgt. Art Flores of the department's Crime Prevention Unit.;   Give your
home a low profile;   Burglars are opportunists who target easy pickings. To
discourage them:;   (check) Keep valuables out of plain sight at home and lock
them in the trunk of your car while shopping.;   (check) Don't set up
expensive gifts such as computers or other equipment next to a window or in
another highly visible, easily accessible area.;   (check) Don't advertise
your new gifts to burglars by leaving empty boxes in plain view for disposal.;
  Fortify your home;   (check) Burglars would rather walk into a quiet,
darkened home than break in. Make your home difficult to enter and they'll
often go elsewhere.;   (check) Install one- to three-inch horizontal dead-bolt
door locks with heavy strike plates, secured with three-inch screws, in all
doors. A peephole in the door enables you to view visitors from inside.;  
(check) Track locks or slide-bolt locks fastened to a sliding glass door's
frame at the floor prevent it from being lifted from its frame. Use window
locks. Lock up even when you are leaving for a few minutes. Burglars work
fast.;   (check) Use timers to turn on indoor and outdoor lights and perhaps a
small radio when you expect to be away for extended periods. Turn down the
ringer on your phone so no one hears it ringing without being answered. If you
have an answering machine, check it occasionally for suspicious calls.;   Find
out neighbors' patterns;   (check) Talk to your neighbors and learn what is
"normal" for your neighborhood. Learn faces, cars, routines. Regard with
suspicion departures from routines and report them to police. Ask a trusted
friend or neighbor to park his or her car in your driveway occasionally while
you are away. Also ask someone to accept packages and other deliveries.;  
(check) Contact your police department's crime prevention unit or neighborhood
watch program for home security measures. Gather neighbors and a police
official will conduct a meeting to help you establish a watch program and
evaluate the security precautions in homes in your group.;   (check) Consider
installing an alarm system, which can scare burglars away. Alarms come in two
basic varieties. Professionally installed hard-wired systems are considered
more reliable than wireless systems because the signal, encased in wire, is
protected. However, do-it-yourself wireless radio-signal systems, once easily
triggered by other sources of radio signals, now use "dual-frequency" or
"digital" transmitters that have reduced the problem substantially. (You can
be fined for too many false alarms.);   Don't forget the yard signs and door
stickers that security companies install with their systems. Police say they
deter burglars.;   (check) To be able to recover lost valuables, engrave or
scratch your driver's license number on valuable items. Engrave the numbers
twice, on the outside of the case and again on the inside, where a thief might
not look. Many police departments or sheriff's offices lend a simple engraving
tool without charge. Some insurance companies give them away with the policy.;
  Insure your valuables;   All the added security, including dead-bolts and
alarm systems, can also give you a break on your insurance -- the final line
of defense to protect your home's contents.;   Burglars can be relentless.
There's always a chance that the most secure home can be penetrated by a crack
burglar determined to make off with a pillowcase full of your belongings.;  
Homeowners' and renters' insurance policies cover losses from burglaries. The
coverage for personal possessions is normally half the coverage on the
dwelling. A policy that covers the home for $300,000, for example, insures
your possessions for up to $150,000.;   But be aware that most policies cover
only the "market value" of stolen goods, replacing them at a depreciated
value. There are full replacement value insurance policies that cost more but
allow you to replace stolen goods at current prices. Some belongings are also
covered at lower limits.;   Special policies may be needed for personal items
including professional equipment used or stored at home, such as business
computers, musical instruments and medical equipment. There are also coverage
limits on coin collections, securities and other valuable papers, jewelry,
precious stones, expensive watches, furs, silverware, firearms and other
valuables.;   Whatever policy you choose, maintain photographic and receipt
inventories of both purchases and possessions.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; (box) The
