In sickness and in health, until Election Day do they part, should read the 
wedding vows of Maine Rep. Olympia J. Snowe and Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., who 
credit politics with cementing their decade-long courtship. The two Republicans 
will marry Friday at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Lewiston 
and will then divide their time between Washington and the executive mansion in 
Augusta. "What holds our relationship together is the fact that we love 
politics," said Snowe, now in her sixth term in Congress. "For some, that 
becomes a dividing factor, but in our case that obviously hasn't been the 
situation." Says McKernan, a former two-term congressman who was elected 
governor in 1986: "We understand the pressures that are on each other." The 
romance blossomed while the two were in Washington, serving as Maine's 
delegation in the House. Their private joke on their trips home: "Your district 
or mine?" Their honeymoon will be a weekend in New York, as McKernan must be in 
Washington next week for a meeting of the nation's governors.

 -- His culinary tastes are suspicious (he prefers green eggs) and his villain 
(the Grinch) is as nasty a character as you'd ever hope to meet in a Brothers 
Grimm tale. But one can't dispute the influence of the ubiquitous Dr. Seuss on 
children worldwide, says Ruth K. MacDonald, who has become an expert on the 
literature of Theodor Seuss Geisel. While her colleagues painstakingly pick 
apart Shakespeare and Chaucer, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, 
MacDonald, head of the English and philosophy department at Purdue 
University-Calumet in Indiana, pores over "The Cat in the Hat" and "Horton 
Hears a Who." MacDonald lauds the playfulness of Geisel's language, and notes 
that his books' themes let children be children. "He has loud and rowdy 
stories. You don't get rewarded for being good but for being outrageous," she 
says.

 -- Speaking of storybook endings, Popeye, the pugilist who first weighed 
anchor as a minor character in a now-forgotten comic strip, is still going 
strong at 60. Popeye, who appears in 250 newspapers worldwide and speaks 25 
languages, first appeared in 1929 in the "Thimble Theater" comic strip -- 
featuring Olive Oyl and her family -- when two of the characters were going on 
a boat trip and needed a sailor, said Carl Langrock of King Features, which 
syndicates the comic strip. "He was written in and out several times during 
1929," Langrock said. "But people responded so strongly to his character, 
because Popeye is really Everyman fighting back against bullies and tyranny."
