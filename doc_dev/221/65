   The latest weekly top 10 in video sales doesn't include
such popular action movies as "The Terminator" or "Hunt for
Red October." Instead, "The Little Mermaid," "The Jungle
Book" and "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" are on the list.
   In fact, videos aimed at children account for at least
half of the best sellers in any given week. Last year,
children's videos made up about 37% of all videos sold. Unit
sales jumped 75% between 1988 and 1990, when an estimated 92
million children's videos were sold, according to Alexander &amp;
Associates, a New York marketing firm. This Christmas, stores
are cramming their shelves with a variety of videos aimed at
children ranging from infants to 10-year-olds.

   There are plenty of reasons for the phenomenon. For
instance, while adults generally watch a movie once or twice,
making it more economical to rent than buy, their children
watch the same programs over and over. And by controlling
what their youngsters see, experts say, parents don't feel as
guilty when they resort to the boob tube as the babysitter of
last resort.
   Moreover, with prices as low as $5 and rarely higher than
$25, videos have become price-competitive with most toys and
books.
   Some longtime critics of children's television programming
are even encouraging the trend. "The VCR and video is where
it's at," says Peggy Charren, president of Action for
Children's Television, a child advocacy group.
   Walt Disney Co., which dominates the business with its
library of animated films, will spend about $75 million in
this quarter alone to promote video sales of such
feature-length films as "The Rescuers Down Under," old
cartoon classics like Rocky and Bullwinkle and dozens of
short collections, like Sing Along Songs and Cartoon
Classics. In fact, the company's distribution is so strong
that Jim Henson Productions Inc., creator of the Muppets,
last week signed a multiyear distribution agreement with
Disney despite previous disagreements between the companies.
   Disney has kept demand for its product high by limiting
supply. For instance, the company halted shipments of "The
Little Mermaid" and "Peter Pan" in March -- though not before
they sold about 9.8 million and 7.2 million copies,
respectively. Once distributors and retailers exhaust their
supply, which takes up to two years, the films won't be
available until the studio re-releases them to theaters in
several years. "Fantasia," the studio's latest release and
last week's hottest-selling video, was introduced Nov. 1; the
company will halt shipments on Jan. 13.
   David J. Londoner, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.,
estimates that video sales will produce $925 million in
revenue for Disney in 1991, including about $160 million from
Fantasia. "This is a phenomenally successful business," he
says.
   Though smaller video producers can't begin to match
Disney's marketing muscle, several have found niches catering
to certain age groups or educational interests. Backyard
Productions of Los Angeles, formed by two women in 1984,
produced "Baby Songs" in 1987 as a kind of toddler MTV aimed
primarily at the infant to two-year-old set. The company
recently rolled out its seventh video and has sold more than
700,000 units.
   Lyons Group, founded by two women in Allen, Texas, created
an oversized, costumed dinosaur named Barney who, with a
group of singing and dancing children, hit it big with
preschoolers, becoming the first "star" to be discovered on
home video. Neiman Marcus opened Barney boutiques in a dozen
stores last summer and featured Barney dolls and a video in
its Christmas catalog, the first video the retailer has sold.
Lyons Group, which has produced eight different tapes, has
sold about 600,000 videos in all and is now filming a
television series called "Barney &amp; Friends" scheduled to air
in April on PBS.
   Some of the non-Disney best sellers have been videos by
the creators of Wee Sing, whose publisher, Price Stern Sloan,
estimates that it will sell $5 million in videos this year,
up from $4 million last year. Playing to parents' sensitivity
about what their children watch, Wee Sing and other videos go
to great lengths to offer an educational or moral bent along
with entertainment. Wee Sing's latest release, for instance,
promises to take viewers to the Big Rock Candy Mountains, a
land of "ice cream mountains and flowing lemonade streams,"
but also purports to teach "important lessons about
friendship, recycling and healthy eating."
   Despite the proliferation of titles, many video insiders
still expect tremendous growth in the children's market.
Time-Life Video &amp; Television recently mailed a test catalog
to hundreds of thousands of homes, offering more than two
dozen home video collections, including "Sesame Street,"
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle" cartoons, wildlife shows, video
flashcards and video math tutors. If successful, the catalog
mailing could be expanded next year. And Nancy K. Jones,
marketing director, says Time-Life is in the "preliminary
planning stages" of developing its own video series, which
will be marketed directly to consumers.
   In the meantime, retailers are promoting the videos
heavily. Target Stores, a division of Dayton Hudson Corp.,
this holiday season has run a four-page section advertising
family videos and featured children-oriented videos several
times on the cover of its Sunday newspaper insert. Children's
videos make up about 40% to 50% of its video sales, which
have doubled each year for the last five years. The videos
are "perfect demographics with our customers," says Lisa
Carlson, senior marketing assistant.
