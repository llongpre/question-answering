<LEADPARA>  The bad news for Gov. Pete Wilson is that his proposed ballot initiative to
slash welfare benefits -- a cleverly disguised but pathetic holiday appeal to
prejudice -- makes comparisons with Scrooge and the Grinch inevitable.;   The
good news is that Scrooge and the Grinch recognized the error of their ways on
Christmas Eve, which gives Wilson four days.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The real news is that this attack on the 2.2 million Californians receiving
Aid to Families with Dependent Children -- 1.6 million of whom are children --
has little to do with California's budget problems, nothing to do with sound
public policy, and everything to do with politics.;   Simply stated, the
governor believes the new legislative districts created by the Supreme Court
give the Republican Party an opportunity to take control of the Legislature,
perhaps as early as next November. Borrowing a page from the David Duke
playbook, the governor has decided his best bet is to play upon the fears of
the many people affected by the recession, unemployment, and state and federal
budget shortfalls, and then identify a scapegoat. And who better to blame than
welfare moms and kids; they don't vote, they don't organize, most don't even
work.;   Never mind that this recession follows 10 years of Republican
leadership in Washington and Sacramento. Never mind that the AFDC caseload has
grown less than the state's population in the past 20 years. And never mind
that the governor's proposal to reduce grants by 25 percent would address less
than 10 percent of California's budget problem and ultimately increase future
budget problems by increasing the ranks of the homeless, the sick and the
dangerous.;   Why bother with reason or compassion when the polls tell you
that people are scared and angry and looking for someone to blame? Why worry
about the pain of innocent children if exporting them might get you a win at
the polls in November?;   And the pathetic way Wilson did it -- scapegoating
California's poor women and children in front of the Glendale Chamber of
Commerce -- makes me long for my hero Robert Kennedy, who had enough guts that
when he called for an end to college draft deferments in 1968 he did it on a
University of California campus, not in front of an American Legion Hall.;  
"Preventive Pete," who so inspired us in his inaugural and State of the Union
addresses last year has metamorphosed into "Punitive Pete.";   Adding insult
to injury, and to be sure he gets his way, Wilson's proposed initiative would
also radically reduce the power of the Legislature by giving us less time to
evaluate his proposed budget and less freedom to fight when we disagree. The
governor could simply declare a fiscal emergency and make budget cuts with no
legislative review or approval.;   I do have some sympathy for my old friend.
He inherited a bankrupt state, courtesy of Republican Gov. George Deukmejian,
amid a national recession, courtesy of Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and
George Bush. He began his administration speaking boldly and nobly of
prevention and cooperation. One year later, however, facing massive economic
and political problems as a result of a decade of disastrous trickle-down
Republican economics, with apparently no constructive solutions, he panics and
picks on the poor.;   Reactionary politicians often have used hard times as an
excuse to divide us by appealing to fear. Believe me, it isn't the poor of
California who have been robbing the middle class.;   While our governor has
taken pains to explicitly distance himself from Duke, it is easy to see why he
feels vulnerable since he's preaching the same gospel: Get them, get those
immigrants, get those people on welfare.;   How about something creative,
courageous, compassionate -- and effective?;   Let's dump the divisive
demagoguery and instead convene a gathering of Californians on AFDC to find
out how they got there.;   How are they faring in terms of providing basic
food, housing, health care and education to their children, our future?;  
Should we redesign all of our public assistance programs to include the
development of healthy self-esteem and responsibility of every recipient?;  
Let's commit, once we are out of this recession, to restoring the Greater
Avenues To Independence program, which requires people on welfare to go to
school and to work.;   Together we can identify real solutions to real
problems and still invest in these children, enabling all of them to realize
their full potential.;   Think about it this Christmas. Maybe a miracle will
happen on N Street.  </TEXT>
