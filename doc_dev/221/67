<LEADPARA>  FOR years, I was convinced that Christmas was dead.;   The trees were plastic.
The store decorations went up in October. Ted Turner bought the Grinch and
yanked him off network television.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But I was wrong. Christmas lives. Its spirit rides inside a Ford Econoline
350 that stops at a little bus shelter on North First Street in San Jose.;  
Last week, I stood in the aisle of the red and white van as "The Little
Drummer Boy" played on the radio and Jean Russo told me why she likes driving
her shuttle bus around and around and around in circles for 11 hours a day,
five days a week.;   "I don't even think of it as work," says Russo, 54. "I
enjoy it because I meet people.";   Meeting them isn't enough. She wants to
make them smile.;   They do. And they laugh. And they ooh and they aah.;   
THEY wonder what would possess Russo, an $8-an-hour working stiff, to decorate
the inside of the van that shuttles people from the Metro Drive light-rail
stop to San Jose International Airport and back.;   She decorates all year
long, but Christmas is special. At Christmas, the 15-passenger van -- which
Russo calls a bus -- becomes a self-contained Macy's Day parade. It's draped
with red, green and silver garland. Santas hang in the window. There are teddy
bears stuffed in stockings, angels, a Christmas tree with blinking lights,
ribbons, bows, reindeer, Christmas mice, a big stuffed Santa that plays carols
when you squeeze its arms, and bells, bells and more bells.;   Russo doesn't
deck out her bus for money. She doesn't do it to stir up those fuzzy feelings
that make us spend, spend, spend. She does it for those who ride with her
through the maze of office buildings between North First and the airport.;  
"People get on plain buses all the time and they dread getting on the bus,"
Russo explains. "But if they get on something different . . . it starts their
day right. And if you have a long day at work, to get on something that makes
you smile, that's nice.";   The people who ride Russo's bus could use a smile
every now and then. These are not the executives who arrive for business
flights in stretch limos or a taxi. They're not people who drive to the
long-term lot in their BMW, Mercedes or Lexus automobiles.;   No, these people
take the light rail to Russo's bus, which runs under county contract. They go
to jobs as rental car clerks, skycaps. Some work at the Red Lion Hotel on the
way to the airport or at the county social services office nearby.;   They are
hard-working people in a time and place where hard work doesn't really
guarantee anything. But they can all be sure of Jean Russo. Every 10 minutes
she makes her loop, and every day there is something interesting to see on her
bus.;   "Kind of like my mom's house," says Eddie Sanchez, 35, on his way to
his new job at the Red Lion Hotel. "It's kind of like sitting in your living
room.";    MAYBE a little. People on the bus actually look at each other. They
do not bury their heads in newspapers, magazines or books. They talk to each
other. One woman even took her Walkman headphones off to join a conversation.
They bring Russo gifts, often Christmas decorations to hang on the walls,
windows or sun visors.;   A week or so ago, a man visiting from England rode
the bus in the morning and returned to the bus stop with his wife later in the
day. They took pictures.;   One chilly morning last week, Colleen Bushaw
stepped into the bus and laughed. She didn't say anything. She just laughed.
Then the woman next to her laughed too.;   Russo knows these people, which
says a lot considering few ride longer than five minutes at a time. She's had
tough times herself. A husband of 22 years who committed suicide. Jobs as a
bank clerk, a charter bus driver. Repeated surgery to correct a broken leg
that simply wouldn't heal right. The need to work overtime now, just to keep
up with the cost of living here. She's up at 3 a.m. and on the job at 5:30.
She takes a couple of breaks, but doesn't end her day until 7 p.m.;   But
Russo doesn't talk to her passengers about all that. Mostly she just listens.;
  And every now and then, without saying a word, she reminds them that
Christmas is still alive.  </TEXT>
