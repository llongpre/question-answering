   It is a solemn moment in the show. Hodding
Carter III, a top official during the Carter administration, is
puzzled why the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House
won't comment on Santa Claus.
   When he was in the State Department, he adds, ``not once did I
hear somebody say, or did I read anything, suggesting that Santa
Claus did not exist.''
   But then, the show, anchored and narrated by former NBC
correspondent Jack Perkins, is about Santa Claus, a syndicated
one-hour special called ``There Really Is a Santa Claus.''
   Airing on various nights this month on stations in 123 cities,
it's a light-hearted ``documentary'' about various facets of the
man in the red suit and white whiskers, all of it an effort to
prove he exists.
   Celebrities like Edward James Olmos, Mickey Mantle and Loretta
Lynn are participants, as are men of learning, one of whom believes
in the possibility of flying reindeer.
   Even police in Fairbanks, Alaska, get in the act. One,
responding to a call, asks a homeowner, deadpan: ``He actually was
on your roof? In a sleigh?''
   And, of course, kids periodically get a say in all this.
   The men of learning include a Dartmouth University professor,
John Rassias, a Santa Claus expert, and a Santa's helper, Dr. Carl
Anderson, a psychologist who wrote his University of Texas
dissertation on Santa Claus.
   The reason he did that, Anderson explains, is that ``I was
struck by the intensity of the children's belief and the joy and
excitement that they experienced when they visited Santa.''
   Conceived and produced by David Lowe Jr., a former ``60
Minutes'' staffer, the show examines the matter of Santa from all
angles _ his origins, his flying reindeer, how he knows if you've
been naughty or nice, and so forth.
   In a section dealing with how Christmas toys get to less
fortunate kids, it also slips in a gentle plug for the Marine Corps
Reserve's Toys for Tots campaign, founded 42 years ago by retired
reserve Col. Williams Hendricks.
   The show has its faults, mainly that it gets a bit too cutesy
now and then. But on balance it's a pretty good holiday special,
particularly for tykes, who may find its findings reassuring in a
world that sometimes seems populated by Grinches with souls of
garlic.
   As Anderson, quoting a little boy, puts it: ``That there's
somebody somewhere in this cruel world who loves children and cares
about them _ that's what Santa's all about.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   BAH, HUMBUG TO ADS _ Home Box Office subscribers facing a
barrage of Yuletide appeals from urchins to buy those toys the
little ones see advertised on TV might have them watch a half-hour
HBO special, ``Buy Me That!''
   Produced by Consumer Reports, and airing Monday and four other
nights, it takes an on-the-mark look at those deftly edited ads
that exaggerate what you actually get when you buy toys that the
ads suggest fly or talk. It also gives the gimlet eye to ads in
which the announcer furtively mumbles ``parts sold separately,'' or
worse, ``some assembly required.''
   The show does a very mean thing. It gets kids to try some toys
advertised on TV. That some emerge disillusioned is indicated by
one girl who, having grappled with a some-assembly-required toy,
says, ``You have to be some kind of architect or professional
engineer to know how to put these things together ... it's really
confusing.''
   COSBY SALUTES AILEY _ Bill Cosby will headline a Christmas Eve
NBC special saluting dance pioneer Alvin Ailey, who died last
Friday of a blood disorder. The one-hour show will include some of
Ailey's most memorable choreographic creations, performed by the
dance company he founded.
