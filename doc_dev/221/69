<TEXT>  And Bartholomew Cubbins, it's true,; Are sad-eyed and weeping; Today and
tonight; As folks give the doctor his due.; It's even brought tears; To the
eyes of the Grinch; (And he never mists up at all),; And now there's an ache;
Steep, deep in his heart; Which once was two sizes too small.; There have
always been two brothers Grimm,; And even a motherly Goose,; But to children
in countries all over the world; There was simply just one Dr. Seuss.; He
taught us to read,; And kept us amused,; And made us all giggle and sing,; And
when he was done; He taught our kids, too,; Which was the most wonderful
thing.; They learned about trying to do what was right,; And telling the truth
'cause they should,; And then came the very best lesson of all,; That it could
be fun to be good.; Because in the end,; And after the jokes,; There was
always a moral to see:; Clean off your plate; (even green eggs and ham?); And
treat everyone quite equally.; You see a person's a person,; No matter how
small,; Or grown-up or young in the end,; And this morning all; Of the persons
who read,; Are missing a very dear friend.  </TEXT>
