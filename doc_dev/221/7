<TEXT>     The five-foot tree, worth $35, was yanked from the ground last week, one
month after it had been planted and three days before it was to be decorated
and lighted.;   Residents plan to replace the tree, but many are angry because
they worked for five years to build the new park.;   "It's a terrible world,
I'll tell you, when people would steal a Christmas tree," said Susan Tenney.; 
 "This is a community park, and even though the tree hadn't been there very
long, a lot of people were outraged that it was taken," added Mike Campbell,
president of the Clarksburg Community Civic Association.;   Campbell believes
the tree is in the living room of someone who passed through Clarksburg in the
night.;   "It was a beautiful tree, and it would make a beautiful Christmas
tree for someone's home," Campbell said.;   The park would have cost about
$100,000, Campbell said, but instead was about $45,000 because so much effort
was donated by residents of the town of 350 along the Sacramento River 10
miles south of Sacramento.  </TEXT>
