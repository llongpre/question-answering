   Something will be missing when Americans open
their mailboxes Wednesday. The annual greeting from the Internal
Revenue Service will not be included in the post-holiday deluge of
late Christmas cards.
   The IRS did not forget. It's simply that the agency no longer
wants to be the Grinch who stole Christmas.
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. decreed the mailing of 108
million tax packages should take place on Dec. 28, not on the day
after Christmas as it has for more than a decade.
   ``We wanted to move it away from the Christmas holiday to allow
folks to enjoy that period of the year as long as they possibly can
before we throw a wet blanket on them,'' said Arthur Altman,
director of the IRS tax forms division.
   The reprieve is brief. The IRS still seeks to get the forms
delivered by the first week in January to insure plenty of
preparation time before the April 15 filing deadline.
   The mailing is the biggest and most expensive the government
does each year, costing $29 million for printing and postage.
   For the second year in a row, Americans will find few changes.
   The amounts for the standard deduction and personal exemption
have been adjusted to reflect the effects of inflation; the
self-employed will find a new deduction replacing the
self-employment tax credit.
   Otherwise, the forms look much like last year's.
   A major difference is not in the forms themselves but in the
type of form each taxpayer receives.
   Some 4.5 million elderly taxpayers used to getting Form 1040
will get the shorter Form 1040A. The change was made possible when
the IRS added lines allowing the elderly to report retirement
income that previously could be reported only on the longer 1040.
   Among other changes from last year:
   - The personal exemption, the amount you may exempt from
taxation for yourself, your spouse and each dependent, increases
from $2,000 to $2,050.
   - The standard deduction, claimed by people who do not itemize,
rises to $3,250 for a single person, up from $3,100. The exemption
for a couple increases to $5,450, up from $5,200.
   - Families with income as high as $20,264 may qualify for an
earned-income credit, up from a limit of $19,340. The maximum
credit available is $953.
   - The basic tax rates remain at 15 percent, 28 percent and 33
percent, but the tax brackets have been widened so that more income
will be taxed at a lower rate, thus compensating for the effects of
inflation.
   Once again this year, the IRS is encouraging people to file
their returns electronically - 4 million taxpayers did it last
year. Tax preparers normally charge between $25 and $50 for this
service but the taxpayer gets his refund check sooner - normally
within two to three weeks, versus five to six weeks for paper tax
returns.
   The IRS expects 113 million returns will be filed with refunds
going to 70 percent of all taxpayers. Last year, more than 76
million refunds were issued averaging about $900 each.
   The IRS is making an effort to debunk a myth concerning the
pre-printed mailing labels, which cut down on IRS processing
errors. Some people have refused to use the labels, believing they
contained secret codes that targeted some returns for audits.
   By explaining what each letter and number in the labels means,
the IRS hopes to boost their use.
   ``We are trying to assure taxpayers that none of the numbers in
the label are a secret code that says, `Audit this return,' ''
Altman said.
   Troops stationed in Saudi Arabia will be among those receiving
tax packages but they, like all Americans living overseas, have
until June 15 to file.
   The IRS expects two-thirds of all taxpayers to file Form 1040.
The remaining one-third will use either the shorter Form 1040A, for
people who do not itemize and whose income is below $50,000, or the
nine-line Form 1040EZ, which can be used only by single people who
do not itemize and who earn less than $50,000 with interest income
of less than $400.
   Those who need tax forms other than those included in their
package can call a new IRS toll free number, 1-800-TAX-FORM
(1-800-829-3676). Forms will also be available at many banks, post
offices and libraries.
