<LEADPARA>  John Williams of Campbell considers himself a practical man. Because of the
recession, he says he won't exceed his holiday shopping budget, and he decided
against buying a men's shirt carrying an $80 price tag.;   And yet, there
still seems to be some room for impulse shopping, judging from the $50 pepper
mill he splurged on last week at Crate and Barrel at Valley Fair.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Oh, well, you gotta do it," he said without a trace of regret.;  
Retailers would like to clone shoppers like Williams by the hundreds. This is
the year of the no-frills, buy-necessities-first holiday season, and there
seem to be few like him out there.;   But that doesn't mean the tree is going
to be surrounded only by underwear, socks and sweaters. Shopper after shopper
last week said that they were stingier than usual with their money but that
they would cough up the money for the right gifts.;   "You don't compromise on
Christmas," said Noel Carpenter of San Jose, who was toting a couple of bags
she had filled while shopping with her daughter Carolyn Korbel.;   When Keith
Vander Tuig of San Jose ran into friends at Valley Fair, he was showing off
"The Board Game Book" he had bought at Eddie Bauer for $14.06, including tax.
It contained playing pieces, game boards and instructions for about a dozen
games from tick-tack-toe to Go. It's not an essential gift, he said, but "I
hate shopping for underwear. . . . I'd almost always rather buy toys.";   But
the most determined shopper encountered was Sheri Sampson of Milpitas, who had
splurged on some pricey, non-essential gifts she's sure will tickle her
relatives. (Sorry, she let me peek in the bags she and her daughter Peri were
carrying only if I promised not to spoil the surprise.);   "We're getting
Christmas gifts just like we always do," Sheri Sampson said. "You only live
once. Air pollution will kill us, so we might as well buy what we want."  </TEXT>
