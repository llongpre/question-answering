   Uncounted numbers of teen-agers and children
who this year filed their first tax returns are about to get a
message from the IRS: Pay your overdue taxes or your bank account
may be seized.
   The Internal Revenue Service, weary at being equated with the
Grinch that stole Christmas, is going out of its way to avoid
carrying out that threat.
   Almost six months after the April 15 deadline for filing 1987
returns, the IRS is completing a series of mailings to more than 15
million taxpayers of all ages who filed but failed to pay all or
part of their taxes.
   Because as many as 8 million young people were brought onto the
tax rolls in 1987, the IRS believes the number of taxpayers who
didn't pay up includes many first-time filers. And the agency is
trying to impress on them the importance of paying up.
   ``We assume these younger taxpayers are not too sophisticated
about the tax laws and we are trying to make them aware of their
obligations,'' IRS spokesman Frank Keith said Monday.
   The young people at risk could be a 1- or 2-year-olds with
interest or dividends on investments given to them, or a
19-year-old college student with a part-time job. Each could have
become liable for taxes in 1987 because of the big tax overhaul
enacted a year earlier.
   ``With several million new filers as a result of this new law,
there's no question but that there are some folks who filed returns
without paying,'' said Charles Hoyle, deputy assistant IRS
commissioner for collections. ``The notices (of taxes due) are out
there and we're hoping they will contact us and try to resolve this
without having to resort to any type of collection action.''
   Any taxpayer who files a return on time but fails to pay the
taxes due is likely to receive one or more comnputer-generated
notices from the IRS. There usually is a series of four letters,
three or four weeks apart, each sounding a little tougher than the
last. The fourth letter cautions that the IRS will take legal
action to collect the tax unless it is paid within 10 days.
   That action, Hoyle notes, can include seizing the bank account
of a child with interest income or the wages of one who is on a
payroll.
   Past-due bills are subject to 10 percent interest plus a penalty
that climbs to 1 percent a month after the fourth notice is sent.
   Under the 1986 law, any child must file a return if he or she
has any combination of earnings and unearned income _ including
interest and dividends _ over $500. The unexpected tax bite on many
young people comes from another change: Any child who can be
claimed as a dependent by a parent is denied a personal exemption
on his or her own return.
