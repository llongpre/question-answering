   Several children broke into a
neighbor's house in this Florida Panhandle town, stole presents from
underneath a Christmas tree and placed them under their own tree,
authorities said.
   Donald and Dixie Shumpert returned from a shopping trip Wednesday
evening to find a window broken, their Christmas tree toppled and
three presents missing, police said.
   A broken cane fishing pole and a brick were on the floor near the
tree. Deputies say they believe the brick was thrown through the
window and the fishing pole was used to reach inside to pull the
gifts within grabbing range.
   Walton County Sheriff's deputies said they followed three sets of
child-size footprints to a mobile home across the street and
confronted the mother of two of the children.
   ``The deputies knocked on the door and she was kind of surprised
when she saw the presents under the tree,'' Donald Shumpert said
Thursday.
   When the children couldn't explain to deputies or their mother
where the presents came from they admitted they had taken them from
the Shumperts' home, rewrapped them and put them under their own
tree, said sheriff's Sgt. Rick Sutton.
   Also, he said, two bathroom rugs missing from the neighbors' back
porch were wrapped as a Christmas gift.
   The culprits were two boys, ages 9 and 11, and a 12-year-old
girl, Sutton said. The two older children were charged with
burglary, petty theft and criminal mischief and then released to
their parents pending an appearance before a juvenile judge. No
charges were filed against the youngest child.
   The Shumperts said the stolen gifts were intended for their
daughter and two grandchildren.
