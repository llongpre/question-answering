Pity the poor oyster farmers of the Bassin de Thau. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas was coming. All over France, people were preparing for their annual 
holiday feasts that traditionally include huge platters of the shellfish as a 
first course. 
</P>
<P>
The 8,000 French oyster farmers sell nearly half of their annual production in 
the Christmas-New Year's season. According to lore, if a Frenchman eats oysters 
at no other time during the year, he will have them for the midnight Christmas 
supper. 
</P>
<P>
What a blow then for the 300 oyster farmers in the Bassin de Thau, an estuary 
in the Mediterranean Sea southwest of Montpellier, when a government laboratory 
discovered traces of salmonella bacteria in oyster beds during a routine test 
at the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
For the Thau ostreiculteurs, it promised to be the bleakest Christmas ever with 
the French government cast as "le grinch who stole Noel." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, French President Francois Mitterrand came to their rescue this week, 
saying he was "touched by the drama of the oyster farmers in which a whole 
year's labor has been ruined." 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand, an inveterate oyster-eater himself, instructed the government of 
Prime Minister Michel Rocard to speed up compensation payments to the oyster 
farmers so they will have relief before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Salmonella poisoning is a common problem with shellfish taken from polluted 
waters. Eating the contaminated food can result in acute gastroenteritis and 
even death among the young or elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Health specialists theorized that a severe drought this past fall in the 
Languedoc plateau above Montpellier caused animal waste to build up in the 
fields. Heavy rains at the end of November washed it to the sea, polluting the 
shallow Thau estuary. 
</P>
<P>
Acting quickly, the Ministry of Marine Affairs in Paris ordered the Thau 
oysters, which account for nearly 10% of the annual national crop of 120,000 
tons, taken off the market. 
</P>
<P>
Enraged by the government ruling, which they claimed contradicted reports from 
other laboratories showing their waters to be clean, the Thau oyster farmers 
went on the warpath. Gangs of them attacked the government laboratory at Sete, 
at the mouth of the Thau estuary, where the salmonella had been discovered. 
Using clubs and oyster trays, they broke windows and smashed computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
The rampaging oyster farmers and their families then blockaded the highway 
leading into the coastal town of Meze. Behind the barricades were 2,400 tables 
heaped with more than 5,000 tons of oysters ruled uneatable by the French 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"It is these kinds of ministerial edicts," fumed Rene Couveinhes, a Gaullist 
opposition member of Parliament from the Herault region that includes the Thau 
estuary, "that during The Terror of the French Revolution sent people to the 
scaffolds." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the generally held view that the Thau oysters are not among the first 
rank of French mollusks -- that honor is reserved for the famous fines de 
claires from Marenne and Oleron on the Atlantic coast -- the plight of the Thau 
oyster farmers won the sympathy of many in France. 
</P>
<P>
Food crises are taken very seriously here. People remember with horror the 
Vacherin cheese scare two years ago. Vacherin, a runny unpasteurized cheese 
from Switzerland and the French Jura region, is also a special Christmastime 
treat. In 1987-88, the Swiss brand Vacherin Mont d'Or was found to contain 
listeria, a potentially fatal bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, it was the American horse-meat scandal that had people talking after 
trichinosis-causing worms were discovered in meat imported from Connecticut. 
There are also dozens of recurring wine and spirits flaps usually involving 
someone mixing a common table wine with some pedigreed appelation controle such 
as Bordeaux or Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Oyster farming in France dates from the late 18th Century when the Baron 
Bellevert built an oyster park on the Normandy coast at Etretat. The oysters 
were delivered to Queen Marie Antoinette at Versailles in carriages pulled by a 
dozen horses. 
</P>
<P>
Oyster raising became a major food industry under Napoleon III in the next 
century. Today, France ranks fourth behind the United States, Japan and South 
Korea in oyster production. In 1988, the French consumed more than 76 million 
dozen oysters, or about 18 oysters for every man, woman and child in the 
country. About half of these are eaten during the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
To the French, oysters are as much a part of Christmas as an evergreen tree and 
the chocolate buche de Noel, or Yule Log. The slimy bivalves are extolled in 
French poetry and literature. The novelist Honore Balzac described himself as a 
"fat man with an incredible passion for oysters." 
</P>
<P>
Author Guy de Maupassant praised oysters as "sweet and fat, resembling little 
ears locked inside shells, melting in the mouth between the palate and the 
tongue like salted candy." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, oyster farmers are held in high regard in France in spite of their 
penchant for violence, as exhibited in the recent Thau oyster riots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unusual profession," commented Antoine Minaud, director of a 
government maritime office that was also attacked by the oyster farmers. "The 
shellfish farmers are restless people, difficult and traditionally very 
individualistic. Perhaps it is because they are half-sailor and half-farmer." 
</P>
<P>
With the plight of the Thau oyster farmers on the front pages alongside the 
massacres in Romania and the American invasion of Panama, it wasn't long before 
the politicians began to react. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Couveinhes, the Gaullist legislator from Herault, was making 
trouble for the Socialist government by defiantly eating the Thau oysters 
despite the ban. "I eat oysters and mussels from Thau waters every day," he 
said, "and I'm in good health." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on Wednesday, during a meeting of the French council of ministers, 
President Mitterrand expressed his heart-felt concern for the Thau oyster 
farmers. He urged that compensation and other benefits, including government 
subsidized interest payments on agricultural loans, be given immediately, 
"before Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, leaders in the French oyster industry feared the Thau oyster scare 
would severely hurt the key holiday market. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, restaurants in the immediate Mediterranean coastal area have been badly 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"This is breaking the local economy," said Pascal Jacquinot, chef of the 
respected Cote Bleue restaurant in Meze. "Our menu is mainly known for its 
shellfish. In this season we normally have 120 customers a day. We have 30 
employees and 12 cooks. But today we had only seven customers and no one for 
dinner." 
</P>
<P>
But as the Christmas feast, known as le Reveillon, draws near, most people in 
France are apparently discarding their fears and ordering their holiday 
oysters. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a slight decline of about 15% because of all the publicity over the 
Thau oysters," said Pascal Mousset, director of La Coupole, one of Paris's more 
famous oyster restaurants. "But as the holidays approach, people have begun to 
forget."
