<TEXT>     The idea was John Lee Hooker's, and he says he expects to bring his friends
Carlos Santana and Gregg Allman along. They'll be backed by the Michael Osborn
Band, and others likely to perform include Elvin Bishop, Chris Cain, Roy
Rogers, Norton Buffalo and Hooker's daughter, Zakiya Hooker.;   It could be
the jam of the year.;   Why did Hooker, patriarch of Bay Area blues, want to
do this show for June and Max Stanley, who run the JJ's clubs?;   "Well, No.
1, they're good friends of mine. No. 2, they're very loyal people; they're
good for the blues," says Hooker by phone from his Peninsula home. "They have
three blues clubs in the area; they're the ones who keep the blues alive.;  
"They're trying to stay alive.";   Like many other club owners, the Stanleys
are hurting. Opening the third JJ's club in the middle of a recession -- the
club opened in September -- hasn't been easy. The Stanleys say they're on the
edge financially. The other clubs are on Stevens Creek Boulevard in San Jose
and on El Camino Real in Mountain View.;   Tickets for the JJ's benefit are
$20. Organizers are asking for clubgoers to bring canned food or clothing to
donate to local charities. Details: (408) 286-3066.;   (hbox);   GRINCH BLUES
-- South Bay blues guitarist Dave Gonzales' Christmas was trashed when someone
broke into his Santa Clara apartment Dec. 4 and stole his musical equipment --
guitars, amps, drum machine, synthesizer and stereo gear.;   Gonzales, who
played with Andy Just and the Shapes and many other bands, was having a hard
enough time already. His day job is connected with the construction industry,
which is in decline, but he'd been hoping to tour Europe with Just in a new
band.;   He's been sending descriptions of the gear and serial numbers to
music stores and pawn shops. Calling all cars: Be on the lookout for a black
1978 Les Paul Pro with Floyd Rose tremolo; "about a 1968" Fender Mustang; a
'68 red Fender Mustang with a competition stripe; a black and white polka-dot
copy of a Gibson Flying Vee guitar; and a 1973 Fender Jazz bass.  </TEXT>
