Will Not Ban All Religious Shows

   The Federal Communications Commission swears it isn't about to ban Christmas carols on television and radio. 
But a lot of people don't believe it. 

   So far this year, the FCC has received 1.1 million letters imploring it to abandon plans to do away with religious shows year round. 
"I protest any human effort to remove from radio or television any programs designed to show faith in God," declares a photocopied petition that accompanies many of the letters. 

   The FCC says it not only hasn't any plans to ban religious shows, it hasn't any power to do so. 
Rather, the agency claims it is a victim of a continuing hoax launched a dozen years ago. 

   This much is clear: On Aug. 1, 1975, the FCC turned down a petition by two public-broadcasting advocates to suspend licensing of new television and radio stations to religious groups. 

   But the rest is mysterious. 
Over the years, rumormongers have falsely spread the word that the petition is still alive, that it would ban all religious programming and that it is the handiwork of atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair. 
Since 1976, the FCC has received more than 20 million letters opposing a proposal that doesn't exist. 

   Who's behind it all? 
Bill Thomas, an official at Pacifica Foundation Inc., a noncommercial radio chain, says Lorenzo Milam, who co-sponsored the original FCC petition against religious broadcasters, egged on the controversy, apparently as a lark, by publishing a book, "The Petition Against God," under the pseudonym Pastor A.W. Allworthy. 

   "We have learned that if the forces of government ever try to defy our Divine Authority, we will erupt to sanctify our cause," the book proclaims. 
Mr. Milam couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Mrs. O'Hair, who says she isn't involved, blames religious broadcasters for spreading rumors. 
Benjamin Armstrong, executive director of National Religious Broadcasters, a Morristown, N.J., trade association, blames rural preachers. 
"People in the hinterland don't get the word" that the rumors are false, he says. 

   The FCC hasn't a clue who is at fault, but one staffer suspects the Post Office. 
"It sure would generate some income," she says. 
But the FCC must share some of the blame. 
The agency routinely throws out letters about the petition without answering them -- feeding fears that it may yet become a grinch that will try to steal Christmas carols.
