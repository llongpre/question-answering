<LEADPARA>  There it is, under the tree next to the kids' Nintendo game cartridges and the
sweater Aunt Martha knitted for you, the ultimate Silicon Valley toy: a brand
new personal computer.;   If you're lucky, your dream will emerge from its box
with its software loaded and configured and only a couple of obvious cable
connections to make, ready to crank out personal finance records, recipes, the
kid's book reports and Christmas thank-you form letters.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     If you're not, get ready for what can often be a most frustrating
experience: setting up the machine. From printers that won't print to screens
that won't display to software that won't load, Christmas cheer can quickly go
the way of the Grinch.;   "One of the most frustrating things in setting up a
computer these days is that there are so many possible ways it can act when
you turn it on," said Russ Walter, a Sommerville, Mass. computer expert and
the author of "The Secret Guide to Computers.";   What to do if you can't
figure out the difference between a data bus and a diesel bus?;   "The first
thing to do is try and find instructions," said Walter, who provides free
computer assistance by telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week ("I will be
available on Christmas, as far as I know," he said). Many problems can be
overcome by following instructions in the manual, which generally provides the
telephone number of the manufacturer's "hot line" where you can call for
assistance.;   Most hot lines are unlikely to be staffed on Christmas day,
however, and on December 26 they are likely to be frustratingly busy. "If you
try calling on Thursday, you'll probably have a lot of company," Walter said.
Some retailers will also provide assistance for those whose computers they
sold, but they, too, aren't likely to answer the phone today.;   Walter
suggests that computer illiterates who can't wait a day or two call neighbors
who know the difference between a laser disc and a laser printer, "feed 'em
some turkey and see if they can bail you out." Once a problem is diagnosed, it
can often be fixed in a few minutes.;   Sometimes, gift-givers with hearts
bigger than their wallets will inadvertently cause the trouble, notably when
they buy a computer and a splashy game to go with it. The newest computer
games frequently are voracious consumers of hardware features -- precisely the
ones you won't find in the least-expensive computers.;   The only solution is
to either exchange the game for one that works on your new machine, or buy the
needed extra hardware, such as memory chips or larger hard disk. (Note that
some stores won't exchange software where the inner envelope containing the
disks has been opened, since it could mean the buyer has made an illegal copy
of the program.);   Fixing many problems, however, may require some technical
knowledge, best acquired when the experts go back to work.;   "It's Christmas.
You must have something better to do with your time than computers," Walter
said. "The best thing to do is be patient and wait until Thursday."; IFYOU'RE
INTERESTED; Russ Walter can be reached by phone at (617) 666-2666.; What you'd
better watch out for; A few common problems plague new computer owners setting
up their machines, according to computer expert Russ Walter:; (box) About 30
percent of the time, a faulty cable is the culprit. Swap the suspect cable
with one you know works. If the problem disappears, it was the cable, if not,
something else is wrong.; (box) Today's software often comes on high-capacity
floppy disks, which can't be read by older, cheaper low-density disk drives.
Most publishers will, upon request, supply you with the necessary floppy
disks, sometimes charging a nominal fee.; (box) Plugging cables into the wrong
sockets, or "ports," means the necessary electrical signals never reach a
printer or modem. Try switching them. More complex problems involve two ports
whose electronic "addresses" conflict. Leave this one to the experts.; (box)
Incorrectly copying software from a floppy to a hard disk could erase data the
computer needs to function. Use a supplied installation program, or carefully
follow all directions in the software manual.  </TEXT>
