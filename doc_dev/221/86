Ah, holiday memories. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the year we couldn't afford a turkey, so Pa had to go out and shoot 
one? 
</P>
<P>
Or was that the Thanksgiving we visited "The Waltons"? 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the time those children got sick on Christmas Eve, so we all 
gathered at the orphanage and sang carols. 
</P>
<P>
Or was that the Christmas we spent with "Doogie Howser, M.D."? 
</P>
<P>
And what about that New Year's Eve we all got together and blew up the cruise 
ship that was holding Father Time hostage? Or was that "The A Team"? "Ozzie and 
Harriet"? 
</P>
<P>
Like much in our culture, American holiday traditions have become inextricably 
entangled with their televised versions. From the moment Grandpa clicks on the 
Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade till a bleary-eyed Aunt Ethel passes out during 
the Rose Bowl wrap-up, the American family is bombarded with video images of 
jive-talkin' turkeys and sincere sitcom Santas. Between today and the first of 
the year, the networks will broadcast an estimated 743,000 football games, and 
everyone from the New Kids on the Block to Dolly Parton will assault the nation 
with good cheer. 
</P>
<P>
So pervasive is this saturation, that holiday rituals themselves have changed; 
in some cases TV has become the ritual. And that's not always so merry and 
bright. 
</P>
<P>
The Zemlicka family of Manhattan Beach began a new holiday rite several years 
ago. Now, each Thanksgiving morning, Kellie Zemlicka gives her husband, Brian, 
a card that celebrates this meaningful new tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The card depicts a Thanksgiving table. At one end, a woman sits eating turkey. 
At the other, a man wearing a football helmet stares at a small television. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some of Kevin Aucello's fondest holiday moments radiate from 
the electronic hearth. "At Christmas, you're so psyched by all the shopping, 
all the wonder, all the products -- and TV shows are a part of that. They get 
you into the mood for all the good feelings." 
</P>
<P>
When he returns to his hometown in Florida this Christmas, he and his family 
will probably gather to watch "Miracle on 34th Street" or "Babes in Toyland." 
But the "big three" events of the holiday season remain "Rudolf the Red-Nosed 
Reindeer," "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas," and "Frosty," the 31-year old San 
Diego banker says. 
</P>
<P>
And since he doesn't go home until Christmas week, he has had to modify his 
holiday ritual a bit. "Now I call up one of my buddies and say, 'Rudolf's' on 
tonight. What are you doing?.' " 
</P>
<P>
The TV set has become as integral as the Thanksgiving turkey or the Christmas 
tree to America's holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
"Television does not reflect culture any more, it is our culture. It's at the 
center of everything we do," says Neil Postman, author of "Amusing Ourselves to 
Death" and chair of the Department of Communications at New York University. 
"Every tradition, every icon, every personage that is central to the culture 
really comes to us through television now, and television, of course, 
transforms them in the process." 
</P>
<P>
That's what happens in the current film "Avalon," which follows a large 
inter-generational family of immigrants over the course of several decades. 
</P>
<P>
As the movie unfolds, the family celebrates three Thanksgiving dinners, 
separated by untold years. The first scene, before television, is a cacophony 
of family chatter, laughter, and the sort of storytelling that binds people 
with a shared mythology. At the second Thanksgiving, some years later, a 
television flickers in the living room as the huge clan, already beginning to 
unravel, shares its meal in the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
And at the third dinner, the cluster of cousins and aunts and nephews and 
grandparents that once held regular family circle meetings has disintegrated, 
and a lone young couple and their children silently eat Thanksgiving dinner on 
TV trays, transfixed by a glowing television screen. 
</P>
<P>
Family therapists who have seen that scene find it rich with significance. But 
none is willing to point the finger directly at television as a holiday 
home-wrecker. Nor are most families. 
</P>
<P>
"In my family, if there's a holiday meal, and say, the Rose Bowl game is on, 
it's a tossup as to whether to eat around the table or eat in the family room 
and watch the game," says Kenneth Sereno, an associate professor of 
communications at USC, and an expert on family communication. 
</P>
<P>
That contrasts sharply with the holiday meals Sereno, 55, recalls from his 
childhood. Back then, the family, like the family in "Avalon," would converse 
and share stories. 
</P>
<P>
"But I didn't think we had much sparkling conversation. We ate, and there was 
routine small talk. It wasn't particularly exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schreiner, a Mt. Washington screenwriter and former director of the 
Groundlings improvisational troupe, has seen television change the dynamics of 
his large Catholic family. But not necessarily for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
Each holiday season, he and his wife Dana and their son join his parents and 
his seven brothers and sisters and their spouses and their children at the 
family home in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that the big dinners, Thanksgiving, and all those holidays were 
very much oriented around traditional things: Thinking back over the year, 
discussing accomplishments. . . , " he says. 
</P>
<P>
The one family ritual that hasn't changed is Christmas Eve. The Schreiners 
still attend midnight Mass en masse, and then return home to sing Christmas 
carols around a fire. 
</P>
<P>
But when his father retired from his practice as a physician, he also retired 
his lifelong disgust with televised football. Now "the holiday season is 
oriented around what the NFL teams are doing that day," Schreiner says. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't bother Schreiner, even though he isn't a big football fan. 
Because at least it gives the family another reason to congregate. "That 
ballgame is going to be watched come hell or high water, and if you want to 
hang with the gang, you've gotta watch. It hasn't really displaced anything in 
our holiday proceedings, it's a new event," Schreiner says. 
</P>
<P>
But some observers lament the passing of un-mediated traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, virtually every human tribe would gather around the campfire at 
important moments to sing and dance and tell stories, says Michael Real, chair 
of the Department of Telecommunications and Film at San Diego State University. 
These gatherings allowed them to feel each other's presence and share what the 
particular event was about -- whether it was preparing for battle or the 
harvest or a religious holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at traditional holidays -- and created ones such as the Super Bowl -- 
folks gather around their surrogate fires in huge numbers, Real says. But while 
that experience may create a sense of mass solidarity, it doesn't foster deep 
connections between people, nor does it instill the same rich mythology. 
</P>
<P>
In his book "Prime Time Society," University of Michigan anthropologist Conrad 
Kottak examines the way the rise of television can change the way a society 
celebrates holidays -- in one example, the way Brazil celebrates Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
There, as here, Kottak found, television's effects are "comparable to those of 
humanity's most powerful institutions -- family, church, state, and education." 
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, Christmas was traditionally an intimate religious holiday, 
celebrated locally and without much razzmatazz. Since television spread into 
the majority of households, though, Christmas has become a national event -- 
"an occasion for spending large sums of money on gifts and feasting," Kottak 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
And while sales statistics suggest that this new tradition has made Brazil's 
retailers jolly, older citizens lament the loss of more private rituals. 
</P>
<P>
The motivations behind the ho-ho-hoopla are easy to guess, however. "It is 
easier for manufacturers to plan products to appear at a particular season than 
to stagger production and distribution," Kottak writes. Also, "fads, which 
stimulate sales, are easier to sustain for a few weeks than a year." 
</P>
<P>
So it's little wonder that instead of menorahs and mangers, Brazilian families 
now encounter popular Christmas icons each time they turn a channel -- 
including one department store's team of Santas, who fan the holiday spirit by 
clapping wildly and bounding around on trampolines. 
</P>
<P>
Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
In America, says Postman, "There still exist family and regional traditions 
that have little to do with television, but they're increasingly on the 
periphery of the culture. The main events occur on television. Television 
really gives us the images of what Thanksgiving and Christmas should be like. 
It tells us what we should eat, what we should wear, if we should sing songs. 
It defines what family means." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the pervasive media celebration has sandblasted away the 
finer edges of families' unique rituals. One often-cited example is the Jewish 
holiday of Hanukkah. Historically a relatively low-key event, it is 
increasingly accompanied by distinctly Christmas-like hype and fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
In a country as ethnically diverse as the United States, this homogenization is 
troublesome, says Janine Roberts, associate professor of family therapy at the 
University of Massachusetts. Most cultures have a unique way to mark the winter 
solstice, for example. Yet some of her clients, including immigrants from 
Puerto Rico and Vietnam, complain that the televised flurry of American holiday 
images excludes their less mainstream traditions and obliterates the quiet 
power of old-fashioned storytelling. Children in particular, begin to doubt the 
validity of their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all the ersatz warmth and good will emanating from the set can 
injure more than a family's aesthetic sensibilities, some therapists warn. 
"Holiday blues," for instance, can be triggered or exacerbated by all those 
perfect families laughing and singing and sharing expensive gifts on the tube. 
</P>
<P>
Dysfunctional families, lonely widows, divorced men, just about anyone who 
doesn't have a Cosby Christmas can "feel like like they're pressing their nose 
against the glass, looking at a life they can't share," says John Murray, the 
head of the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at Kansas State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Thoman, executive director of the Center for Media and Values at USC, 
suggests that families turn the tables on their television, using a video 
camera to record their family rituals in the form of a story, rather than 
letting the tube dictate their holiday rites. 
</P>
<P>
She also advises families that watch commercial television to "Be picky. Don't 
let it dominate the whole day like video wallpaper." And finally, she suggests 
that the family use the holiday season to examine and challenge the 
commercialism and materialism with which the media indoctrinate them 
year-round. "Don't just be recipients of the messages that we're nothing unless 
we have something else." 
</P>
<P>
In America, the television "has become a member of the family that has to be 
dealt with like any other member," she says. Most people, however, never 
acknowledge the new member, let alone examine how it affects them. "We'd like 
to see people take advantage of this new member of the family, and encourage it 
to be disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, there are an increasing number of Baby-Boom types who seem ready 
to pull the plug on their television-tied holiday traditions. 
</P>
<P>
In the '50s and '60s, "people were into streamlining everything," including the 
holidays, says Maureen O'Hara, a San Diego-area family therapist. Parents 
didn't have time to pass on recipes for plum pudding, or to teach the proper 
way to make Christmas wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
But now, O'Hara frequently encounters people of Baby Boom age and younger, who 
are eager to recapture those old pre-TV recipes and rituals. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the young families tend to botch things a bit, she says. It's 
not really their fault, though. 
</P>
<P>
If sister's singing around the Christmas tree has the odd inflections of a 
young Susan Dey, if decorating the tree evokes images of Hoss and Adam and 
Little Joe; if a heartfelt gift exchange resonates with the Dick Van Dyke 
Christmas scenes in "thirtysomething," it's no coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking the storytelling rituals that transferred information through 
generations, today's families get their nostalgia for pre-TV holiday 
traditions, as well as their information concepts of what those traditions 
should be, from their newest but most trusted family member: the television.
