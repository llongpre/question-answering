   Consumers wandered the nation's malls and Main Streets on
Friday, starting a Christmas shopping season that retailers fear
will be their worst in years because of the twin grinches of a weak
economy and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In keeping with a tradition that's as much a part of
Thanksgiving weekend as leftover turkey, shoppers lined up early,
some standing in the rain before stores opened.
   By midmorning, many an aisle was crowded, from midtown
Manhattan's swank department stores to the State Street Mall in
Chicago to the shops that ring San Francisco's picturesque Union
Square.
   ``We're having a phenomenal year, a record year,'' said Rebecca
Schulz, store manager for FAO Schwartz on Union Square. ``We opened
at 9 a.m. and there was a line waiting to come in past the toy
soldier. We're seeing everything fly out the door - the basic toys,
games, cuddly toys, electronic goods.''
   Other San Francisco merchants were similarly ebullient about the
1990 holiday season.
   But elsewhere, lines at some cash registers were ominously
short, substantiating fears of retailers who had predicted they
would host browsers, not buyers.
   Many shoppers are trimming holiday budgets because they already
have been squeezed financially by higher fuel prices, while talk of
an economic downturn has unnerved them.
   ``I'm going to cut mine at least in half,'' said Sharon Stowe of
Cary, N.C., who with her daughter-in-law was eyeing a model train
display at a mall in Raleigh.
   Wanda McNamara of New Cumberland, Pa., said she has not been
personally threatened with a layoff or loss of income. Still, she
is taking recession talk seriously.
   ``I'm watching my dollars,'' she said while waiting for Boscov's
department store to open in Harrisburg, Pa. ``I'm more careful,
more selective. I'm looking for sales. I'm cutting down on the
Christmas list.''
   The first few days of Christmas shopping season are scrutinized
by retailers because they're considered a barometer of what to
expect in their most critical time of year, when they make about
half their annual sales.
   No one is expecting this to be a great - or even very good -
Christmas shopping season.
   Some pessimists, including retail industry analyst Daniel Barry
of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. in New York, have even said it will be the
worst holiday season since the 1974 recession.
   The Thanksgiving weekend has lost some significance in recent
years because more consumers shop later in the season. But it still
helps stores decide when to offer sales and what items they must
restock.
   Gary Ebel, assistant general manager of Skagway department store
in Grand Island, Neb., said he had no idea how the holiday retail
season would turn out once the day after Thanksgiving had passed.
   ``Normally, it's one of the biggest days of the year for us,''
Ebel said. ``That's proved to be false for us for several years.
Our biggest day is the last Saturday before Christmas, and it seems
to be moving toward that trend.''
   Still, Ebel and other merchants resorted to gimmicks to lure
buyers.
   ``We gave away poinsettias to the first 300 customers, and we
got rid of those in 15 minutes,'' Ebel said. ``We had books of
stamps at 25 cents off today for two hours.''
   Consumer spending, which slipped as the economy weakened this
year, dropped precipitously after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Not only were consumers shaken by prospects of war, but they
suddenly found themselves paying more for gasoline and heating oil.
   The Middle East turmoil, however, has inspired some merchants. A
Florida discount store offered ``Put a Stain on Hussein'' toilet
paper, featuring pictures of the Iraqi leader, for $1 a roll.
   ``It's flying out of here,'' said Jack Rohn, manager of the
``Everything's A $1.00'' store at the Sawgrass Mills shopping mall
near Fort Lauderdale.
   The scenario is particularly grim for retailers hurt last
season. Many were forced to slash prices to bring in sales and
several suffered earnings drops or losses.
   Their hope to avoid a repeat this year is faint.
   At the giant Glendale Galleria mall in suburban Los Angeles,
many shoppers said the foot traffic looked lighter than usual
Friday.
   At D. Laurenti, a boutique specializing in $725 Italian suits
and $195 shirts, assistant manager John Tawlian said sales were off
as much as 30 percent as the holiday season began.
   ``We don't have big hopes,'' he said as shoppers strolled by his
empty store. ``Things could change, but if you ask me it's not
going to be as good as last year.''
