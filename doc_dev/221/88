<LEADPARA>  'Twas the night before Christmas, the state budget battle remote. But
politicians still went for their opponent's throat.;   In a duel of holiday
greetings, aspiring poets in both parties borrowed from a famous Christmas
verse to poke fun at political foes.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A card from the California Democratic Party started:;   " 'Twas the week
before Christmas and all through the state, discontent had begun to
proliferate.";   That inspired Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's press
secretaries, in a Christmas Eve release, to attempt their own rewrite of the
same poem. Theirs began:;   " 'Twas the week before Christmas, when all
through the house, not a whitefly was stirring, nor even a mouse.";  
Predictably, the Democrats' card took swipes at Wilson. Democratic Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown of San Francisco was the main target of the Wilson
verse.;   The Democratic version attacked Wilson for his proposed spending
cuts, particularly in welfare benefits. One refrain read:;   "The governor
showed that he just didn't care, for all of those poor kids who rely on
welfare. While visions of sugarplums danced in their heads, Pete Wilson ran
off with their hospital beds.";   But the governor's spokesmen portrayed
Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown as a sort of Grinch who's thwarted in
an attempted burglary by the Supreme Court's reapportionment panel.;   "They
spoke not a word, but drew district lines, that gave voters power, and
incumbents land mines."  </TEXT>
