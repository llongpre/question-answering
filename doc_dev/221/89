   A Key West-style celebration of Halloween
attracted cave dwellers, Romans and Greeks and some people who
apparently interpreted the festival theme of ``B.C.'' as meaning
``Before Clothes.''
   The island town's historic district was jammed with
costumed-revelers for the Nighttime Fantasy Parade that stretched
well into the wee hours of Sunday, said Michael Whalton, director
of the 10th annual Fantasy Fest.
   The parade, whose theme was ``Fantasy B.C.,'' brought out Fred
and Wilma Flintstone and all their friends to mix and mingle with
ancient Greeks and Egyptians and some bizarre space creatures,
along with a few who caught more eyes for what they weren't wearing.
   ``My costume? I'm a caveman, of course,'' said Larry Fleischman,
a retired Internal Revenue Service officer who wore only a
itsy-bitsy loincloth. ``Actually, I'm a dirty old man with very
little on.''
   More than 100 fundamentalist Christians mingled with the 40,000
revelers, passing out pamphlets and trying to keep things in check.
Fest organizers have cut out the too-titillating outfits worn by
some in the parade's early years.
   ``It's a chance to let your hair down and be crazy.'' said
Barbara Sheckler, a resident of Miami who has been to two other
Fantasy Fests.
   The parade culminated seven days of masquerade balls, costume
contests and other zany events. Even four-legged masqueraders got
into the party spirit with a pet costume contest.

   Cathy May Sliker has reason to believe more
than one person was behind the theft of her family's pumpkin. It
weighed 246 pounds.
   The pumpkin was snatched last week from the front porch of the
family's home in northwest Pennsylvania.
   Sliker said she and a friend had to use a wheelbarrow to bring
the pumpkin her home. She said she used a bathroom scale to
determine the weight of the pumpkin, which was 2{-feet in diameter.
   Her four children had planned to carve the pumpkin into a
jack-o'-lantern and put a flashlight inside to display it for
Halloween.

   Trick-or-treaters are going ape over the
mighty Kong in this northeast Connecticut town.
   Once the terror of New York City, King Kong glares down on
passers-by, fangs bared and a likelike paw clutching a terrified
Fay Wray against the roof of Dawn and Kenneth Wilkinson's house.
   Dawn Wilkinson, 27, is delighted that people appreciate her
50-foot replica of the sinister simian.
   ``We've had kids out here with their hands over their mouths,
jumping up and down on the sidewalk,'' she said. ``A school bus
stopped to let the kids look, and we've had elderly people taking
family portraits in front of him.''
   Using molding plaster, 80 feet of pipes, 800 feet of wire
fencing and $150 worth of black garbage bags, the Wilkinsons worked
on King Kong for more than a month and spent $700 on their
Halloween decorating project.
   They had planned to hoist King Kong, but he had other ideas.
   ``We were using pulleys to stand him up when the face started to
come crashing down,'' Flagg said. ``All of a sudden, he sat down as
if to say, `there, that's good enough.'''

   The Grinch who stole Halloween apparently had a
change of heart and returned a 19-foot inflated jack-o'-lantern
stolen from a residence for families of children being treated for
cancer.
   The lighted orange balloon, financed by a gift from a California
family, was inflated and tethered to stakes in the lawn outside the
Ronald McDonald House late Friday but was gone by Saturday morning.
   The balloon reappeared on the doorstep Sunday and was reinflated
to the relief and renewed delight of staff, patients and their
relatives.
   ``I guess they felt guilty and brought it back,'' said officer
Jeff Bray.
   The balloon weighs about 100 pounds and is valued at about
$2,500.
   ``I can't believe someone would steal it from a place like
that,'' said Shad Dean of the Elliott Bay Balloon Co., who helped
set up the great pumpkin. ``When we got it set up, the kids were
down there loving it and carrying on. I'm not an emotional guy, but
I was touched.''
