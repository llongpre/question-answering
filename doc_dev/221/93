<LEADPARA>  It's a lonely campaign for the folks in Fremont who oppose the $80.4 million
school bond measure on the Nov. 5 ballot. Speaking against it is like slamming
mom and apple pie.;   "It's very difficult for people to take a public stand
against something that's perceived to be pro-children," said Fremont attorney
James Fallon, one of the few who have publicly opposed the measure. "I don't
want to seem like the Grinch who stole Christmas . . . but this (measure) was
slapped together hastily without thought to the long-term planning."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Proponents say the bonds would provide long-awaited funding to repair
Fremont Unified School District's rundown campus buildings, reconstruct the
most dilapidated ones and finally put an elementary school at Ardenwood Forest
in the north part of town.;   The measure has the ringing endorsement of
parent-teacher associations, the Fremont Unified District Teachers
Association, the school board, district administrators and most students. No
argument against the proposal was submitted for the official ballot pamphlet.
And nearly 3,000 residents have agreed to put signs on their lawns supporting
the measure.;   But there are a few who have spoken against it.;   Fallon, who
served on the original bond committee, calls the measure a short-sighted
"Band-Aid" that provides too little money for needed repairs and lacks
provisions for preventive maintenance. Though the measure would provide $80.4
million, the district has identified more than $100 million worth of needed
repairs.;   "It would provide for some repairs, but as soon as you do repairs,
maintenance is needed and there is no provision in the bond measure for that,"
Fallon said. He said the measure also fails to safeguard against the
possibility that administrative costs could swallow the funds.;  
Superintendent Ralph Belluomini said, however, that the district is legally
bound to spend bond money solely on construction projects; the only
administrators that could be paid with that money are building inspectors
working on those projects.;   And school officials said the district plans to
set up a maintenance fund, using money from the sale of district properties.; 
 Fallon and Richard Ahern, a Fremont member of the national watchdog group
Citizens Against Government Waste, said they were concerned the measure fails
to mandate exactly how the money would be spent.;   "The needs are there,
there is no doubt about it," Ahern said. "But I am concerned whether the money
is going to be allocated for what it is intended to be used for.";   The
measure provides about $33.9 million for elementary schools, $12.3 million for
junior highs, $28 million for high schools and $6 million for other district
projects.;   A school-bond-proposal committee has drafted a list of specific
projects earmarked for funding -- including rebuilding Washington High School,
installing ventilation at Kennedy High, rebuilding Warwick Elementary and
building an Ardenwood Forest elementary school.;   But that list is only
advisory, and nothing in the measure requires that those projects be funded.; 
 The school board, however, is slated to appoint a citizens oversight
committee to ensure that those projects are done.;   "This school board
certainly is committed to these projects," Belluomini said. "They'll be done,
unless an earthquake knocks everything down."  </TEXT>
