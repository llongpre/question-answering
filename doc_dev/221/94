Klepto was sitting on his front stoop. "I'm waiting for the mailman," he told 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"You must be expecting an important letter." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually on the lookout for Christmas packages. The more I get, the 
happier I'll be." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us feel that way," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"The gifts are not for myself -- they are for other people." 
</P>
<P>
I looked confused. 
</P>
<P>
He explained, "As you know, we're having a conservative holiday and are being 
frugal. So Ruth and I came up with this idea. Instead of buying any new gifts, 
we'll just pass along the ones that are sent to us, minus the card, of course." 
</P>
<P>
"But if you give away everything you receive, you won't have anything for 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter. Most of the presents we get aren't anything to write home 
about. Look at this Ratatouille Popcorn in a can. Many folks couldn't do 
without it, but we can. Believe it or not, Ruth and I have spent eight or nine 
Christmases without Ratatouille Popcorn." 
</P>
<P>
"What will you do with it?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'll send it to my brother-in-law, Toady. He mailed us a pound of goat's 
cheese last year which, I am certain, his boss gave him. We've been very lucky 
this December. The Rapps sent us a letter-opener, which we immediately passed 
on to the Ludwigs after they mailed us a Christmas washcloth." 
</P>
<P>
"Who got the washcloth?" 
</P>
<P>
"We can't decide. We still haven't received a gift from the Lyons or the 
Porters." 
</P>
<P>
"The system is great as long as you don't get the presents mixed up," I said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"We did that last year. The Constantines gave us garden shears. By mistake we 
sent the shears back with our card attached. Damned if we didn't get a rave 
note from Fitzi Constantine saying that they were the most beautiful garden 
shears she had ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
"That must have made you feel good," I told him. 
</P>
<P>
"Sending other people's gifts for Christmas isn't as cheap as you might think. 
There is the cost of wrapping paper, ribbon and postage." 
</P>
<P>
"Why can't you use the same wrapping paper that it came in?" 
</P>
<P>
"That would be cheating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Suppose you pass along a gift to someone, and that person doesn't send you 
one?" 
</P>
<P>
"You mean like you?" 
</P>
<P>
"OK, like me." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't keep score. You can still hold on to the cactus plant from Mary Ellen 
Clarkin with no questions asked." 
</P>
<P>
"If I mail something to you, Klepto, can I designate the person I want you to 
send it to?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, because you may not know what he or she likes -- and when it comes to 
gift-passing, the most important thing is to do it with love." 
</P>
<P>
"You certainly have taken the Grinch out of Christmas," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone has to support the economy."
