<TEXT>     Well . . . it isn't quite empty, but it may as well be for the children who
may not get toys on Monday, when low-income and homeless parents are allowed
to choose two toys for each child.;   "We need 3,544 toys by Monday, and we
only have about 1,500 new toys," said Barbara Zahner, executive director of
Sacred Heart Community Service.;   "We just think it's real important for each
child to have something new at Christmas. The children of the poor ordinarily
do not receive new things. They get hand-me-downs and other people's
leftovers.";   Children of the poor also rarely get to receive presents from
their own parents, many of whom have to spend 50 to 80 percent of their income
for rent, according to volunteers at Sacred Heart.;   As one way of trying to
help parents regain a little dignity at Christmas, the community service
agency started a Christmas Toy Box five years ago. It's a day when parents can
select toys to give to their children, as if they had bought them.;   The
staff also makes available any new blankets or warm clothing received.;  
"Often, parents will choose a piece of clothing or a warm blanket rather than
a toy because their children are sleeping on the floor or they can't afford to
pay for heat.";   New toys are preferred for the Toy Box, but volunteers were
overwhelmed with what Zahner calls "previously loved toys" this year.;  
Sister Esperanza Jasso, coordinator of children's and mothers' education
programs, takes old stuffed animals home to wash. She then hangs them up to
dry and puts new bows on them.;   Sacred Heart Community Service has seen a
major increase in demand for food and toys this year.;   With the opening of
the Christmas Toy Box only a day away, the shortage of toys still does not
compare with the tragedy of 1988, when thieves picked through all of the
donated toys and clothing and stole only the new playthings.;   Response from
the community helped refill the shelves, and Zahner and others hope it can
happen again -- for the children.;   "We had a family in here Friday, a mother
and two children," she said. "The mother was dressed in a cotton shift and the
children were not dressed warmly. At the same time, somebody brought in a
rusted tricycle, and I thought, 'Oh no, can we fix that in time?';   "But the
little 4-year-old girl's eyes lit up and she asked if she could have the
tricycle. I was so struck by the joy of children and their beauty."; IFYOU'RE
INTERESTED; A staff member will be available at Sacred Heart Community Service
from 12:30 to 5 p.m. today to accept donations of new toys, warm clothing,
food and Christmas wrapping paper. They may be dropped off at the service's
offices at 803 S. First St., San Jose. For more information, call (408)
283-5800.  </TEXT>
