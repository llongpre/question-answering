LIGHTS OUT: FOR 35 YEARS, RESIDENTS ON TELOMA DRIVE HAVE MADE THEIR BLOCK THE 
MOST BRIGHTLY DECORATED IN THE COUNTY. BUT THE MAN WHO BUILT THE STREET REFUSES 
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ANNUAL TRADITION.

The man who literally built the street that has become the county's most 
brightly decorated neighborhood block during the Christmas season is the only 
resident on his block who refuses to decorate his house. 
</P>
<P>
But 81-year-old Al Faoro insists he is not the Grinch of Ventura's Candy Cane 
Lane. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to put some lights out when they first started," Faoro says. "Then I 
just decided I didn't want to do it anymore. Now, of course, I'm 81 and I have 
arthritis. It's just too much for me." 
</P>
<P>
While some of Faoro's neighbors on Ventura's Teloma Drive say they're puzzled 
at his refusal to participate in what for many of them has become the premier 
neighborhood event of the year, they insist they have no ill feelings toward 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Long ago, the neighbors say, it became clear that Faoro and his wife, Jean, 
were not going to take part in what one resident calls "a two-week-long block 
party." At this time of year, the residents of Candy Cane Lane are really too 
busy to worry about one holdout on their block. 
</P>
<P>
Featuring giant candy canes, outsized Christmas cards, Santa's sleighs and 
Nativity scenes, the Candy Cane Lane light show will begin next Sunday and 
conclude on Christmas night. For two weeks, the lights will blaze on Teloma 
Drive from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the 35th time the residents of the comfortably middle-class street 
just east of Ventura College have entertained long lines of visitors from as 
far as 100 miles away. The event, which was first staged in 1955, has been 
canceled only once, in 1973, when the lights were turned off because of the 
energy crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, nearly four decades ago Faoro, who lives at 166 Teloma, was the 
prime developer of the block between Telegraph and Loma Vista roads that has 
become a living Christmas card during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Faoro, a retired Shell Oil Co. engineer who took up home building as a 
sideline, says he has nothing personal against the neighborhood project. It 
simply isn't for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the others do it if they want to," he said. "It's perfectly all right with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the Faoros did not attend a recent meeting of residents at the house 
of Candy Cane Lane residents Bob and Carol Cole to plan and assign duties for 
this year's show. 
</P>
<P>
"They're always invited, but I can't recall that they've ever attended," said 
Carol Cole, who has lived on Teloma for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of her neighbors, Cole says she doesn't resent the Faoros for not 
taking part. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no hostility toward them at all. Whatever anybody feels like doing is 
OK with the rest of us. A few years ago, several people didn't decorate because 
they were ill. We all understood. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, one year the vote was 50-50 as to whether we'd have Candy Cane Lane 
at all. But then we decided to go ahead with it, and everybody pitched in." 
</P>
<P>
Cole said that besides the Faoros, another resident of the street, a widow, 
does not feel up to decorating, so Glenn Gooss of 57 Teloma usually decorates 
her house for her. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't pressure anybody," said Gooss, who was among Candy Cane Lane's 
original organizers. "A project like this involves some expense and work, and 
it makes you stick pretty close to home during the holidays, but we feel it's 
worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Another of Candy Cane Lane's residents, Ruby Montgomery, who lives next door to 
the Faoros at 174 Teloma, described Faoro as "a very easygoing, delightful man" 
and joined her neighbors in saying she sees nothing wrong with his refusal to 
decorate his house. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Montgomery, whose husband died early last year, has some reservations 
of her own about being part of the neighborhood effort this year. 
</P>
<P>
Last Christmas, Montgomery decorated her house with the help of her son, who 
also lives in Ventura. But this year, she says that she, too, may leave her 
house dark. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the other people won't resent it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The age of many of Candy Cane Lane's residents is a growing factor in 
determining whether more holiday lights will be dimmed on the street in future 
years. In fact, most of the original residents who still live on the street are 
now in their 70s or 80s. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get as old as I am, it's a burden," said Marion E. Smith, 78, of 126 
Teloma. "Still, I'm going to put the manger scene and the big cross on my front 
lawn as usual." 
</P>
<P>
The 28 houses on Candy Cane Lane don't change hands often, but when they do, 
Smith and his wife, Virginia, are among those who are glad to see younger 
people move in. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Jeff and Lisa Schmoll, both 30, bought their home at 84 Teloma in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Candy Cane Lane was one of the main reasons we moved here," said Jeff Schmoll, 
a Texaco Inc. engineer. "My wife and I have come down this street and enjoyed 
all the lights for years. Now we're a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Al Faoro says he enjoys the lights as much as anybody -- those put up by the 
newer residents as well as the old-timers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
But when he talks about Teloma he obviously prefers to recall the time when he 
helped bring the street into existence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the one who thought of the name, you know -- it combines Telegraph and 
Loma Vista," he said. "And one reason it's so nice here is because I gave the 
houses wide lots -- they're 70 feet wide." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he doesn't light up his house for Christmas, Faoro notes, he did 
help decorate the neighborhood in another way. 
</P>
<P>
"This area used to be a lemon grove, you know. I made a point of leaving lemon 
trees in the back yard of every house I built."
