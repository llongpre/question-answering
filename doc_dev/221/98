A group called "Grinch" has started circulating leaflets in the south San 
Francisco Bay Area urging AIDS activists to disrupt the holiday season this 
year in an attempt to draw more attention to the deadly disease. The Gay 
Retaliation for Inexcusable Negligence and Criminal Homophobia is urging 
activists to participate in "Operation Grinch" beginning Nov. 24 by blocking 
traffic, planting stink bombs in department stores, flooding airline 
reservation lines and shutting down automatic bank teller machines.
