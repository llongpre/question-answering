<HEAD>Pioneer Modernist Architect Is Dead At Age 88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Berthold Lubetkin, an architect who played a
leading role in founding the Modernist school in Britain in the
1930s, has died at age 88, his family said.
   Lubetkin died Tuesday at Bristol in western England, the family
said Wednesday. No cause of death was given.
   The son of an industrialist, he was born in Tblisi in what is
now the Soviet republic of Georgia.
   He was reticent about his early years, saying ``there is no such
thing as a fact.'' But news reports said he was educated in Moscow
and St. Petersburg, now Leningrad, witnessed the Bolshevik
revolution of 1917 and absorbed the progressive ideas of
Constructivism prevalent at that time.
   In 1922, he accompanied an exhibition of Soviet art to Berlin
and went on to pursue architectural and engineering studies at
various European centers.
   In 1925, he went to Paris, then the focus of the European
avant-garde movement, and acted as site supervisory architect for
Konstantin Melnikov's dynamic Constructivist Soviet pavilion for
the Paris Exhibition of Decorative Arts of that year.
   In the French capital he met among others the Russian-born
writer Ilya Ehrenburg and the painters Georges Braque, Fernand
Leger and Pablo Picasso and worked with Jean Ginsberg, with whom he
designed an apartment block in the Avenue de Versailles.
   By then a glamorous and exotic figure, Lubetkin came to London
in 1931 and the following year set up Tecton, a co-operative of
young architects committed to radical ideas.
   Modernism was named after the Modern Architecture Research Group
which Lubetkin helped found in 1933. But Lubetkin's first buildings
in Britain were designed not for people but animals.
   In 1932, thanks to the influence of scientists Sir Solly
Zuckerman, later Lord Zuckerman, ad Sir Julian Huxley, brother of
writer Aldous Huxley, he was commissioned to design the gorilla
house at London Zoo and in 1937 the penguin pool.
   The famous pool's composition of curved planes of reinforced
concrete still draws acclaim from students of architecture.
   His first opportunity to build for humans came in 1933, when he
was commissioned to design a luxury apartment block at Highgate in
north London, the capital's highest point.
   Highpoint One, as the block was called, was the most conspicuous
statement of the so-called new ``white architecture'' in Britain.
Many of its details, like the S-curved front to the balconies, went
on to become cliches in the 1950s.
   Lubetkin's London monument to Vladimir I. Lenin, unveiled by the
Soviet ambassador in 1942, was later removed because of repeated
attacks by anti-Communists.
   After World War II, the architect concentrated on designing
homes for blue-collar workers.
   Tecton broke up in 1948 and Lubetkin abandoned architecture to
take up farming in Gloucestershire in western England.
   An often impatient man and an inveterate gambler, Lubetkin
radiated cosmopolitan charm and had an engagingly mischievous sense
of humor. But he was unable to conceal his anger at the direction
taken by post-war architecture.
   In 1982, in belated recognition of his pioneering work, the
Royal Institute of British Architects presented him with its Royal
Gold Medal for Architecture.
   In his acceptance speech, he attacked the architectural style
known as Post-Modernism that flourished after the war as a
``transvestite'' aberration, the ``mumbo jumbo of a hit-and-miss
society.''
   He was equally critical of the style dubbed High-Tech.
   Lubetkin married architect Margaret Church in 1936. She died in
1978. They had two daughters and a son, who survive him.
