  [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- Foreign investors are 
working to make inroads into the peripheral businesses for the 
air transportation industry in Taiwan, trade sources said 
Saturday [28 May]. 
  The sources made the remark after the ministry of economic 
affairs approved an investment plan by Hong Kong's Alde Burgh 
Ltd. to open a flight kitchen company here. Alde Burgh is an 
affiliated firm of the Swire Group, a business conglomerate in 
the British colony. 
  The project calls for a total investment of NT [new Taiwan)0 
$2.27 billion (US$84.07 million), half of which will come from a 
bank loan. 
  This is the second such project to get the green light here. 
Earlier this month, the ministry approved a similar investment 
plan by an American company. 
  The sources forecast that a growing number of foreign 
enterprises will join domestic air freight peripheral businesses 
as Taiwan aims to become an Asia-Pacific air transportation 
center. 
  Moreover, they pointed out, Lockheed Aircraft Corp. of the 
United States has decided to increase investment in its Taiwan 
subsidiary by NT$610 million (US$22.59 million) to open a 
production as well as repair and maintenance center for flight 
control systems. 
  The capital increment plan has already been approved by the 
ministry, they added.
