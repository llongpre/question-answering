The notion that governments should seek to mould the behaviour of citizens
is somewhat chilling. It conjures up images of Aldous Huxley's Brave New
World, where the social and genetic conditioning was so absolute that even
the subhuman 'deltas' were perfectly content with their menial lot. Yet this
seems to be the direction in which US social policy is moving. Many poverty
experts argue that the obstacles to self-advancement in the inner city and
elsewhere are internal rather than external: psychological rather than
economic.
Modern society may be moving into a third phase. In the first pre-capitalist
phase, only an aristocratic elite enjoyed high living standards. The
industrial revolution ushered in a second 'progressive' phase during which
the mass of working people improved themselves, partly through the
opportunities created by free markets and partly by pressing successfully
for a host of social reforms, such as government pensions, healthcare and
jobless benefits. In this phase, reformers of all political stripes made a
critical assumption: the poor are no different from anybody else and will
respond readily to market incentives and government programmes.
Yet entrenched poverty in an economy as wealthy and open as the US perhaps
indicates the start of a third social phase. Here, the bulk of the
population lives comfortably because obstacles to personal advancement,
while real, are minor by historical standards. However, a significant
minority - most visible as a disaffected urban underclass - is dependent:
either unable or unwilling to grasp new opportunities. Poverty experts see
policies aimed explicitly at changing behaviour as the only way to energise
the passive, non-working poor and hence propel them into the social
mainstream.
Mr Lawrence Mead, an academic at New York University, is one of the most
articulate exponents of such theories, known as 'the new paternalism'. In a
recently published book*, he argues that conventional social policies fail
because they take for granted people's competence to respond positively to
incentives. By competence, he means all the qualities that allow a person to
get ahead economically - not only intelligence but foresight, energy,
discipline, and the ability to sacrifice for the future. He believes the
challenge is no longer to alter the economic or social structure of society,
but to change the personal psychology of dysfunctional adults.
Controversially, Mr Mead blames poverty squarely on lack of work effort, not
low wages. If the poor worked as hard as the middle classes they would not
be poor. On his figures, only 16 per cent of the heads of poor families work
full-time; less than half work at all. The top fifth of the income
distribution works seven times as many hours as the bottom fifth. He claims
that most barriers to work are largely imaginary: there are still plenty of
unskilled jobs; most women can arrange childcare quite cheaply; welfare
benefits are too low to provide a rational alternative to employment. The
problems lie mainly in people's heads.
It is not that the poor are social rebels. Surveys indicate that welfare
claimants share the same values as the rest of society: for example, they
affirm the importance of steady employment and law and order. On many social
issues, the poor are actually more conservative than the better off: 'They
value external controls on behaviour exactly because their internal controls
are less secure.' For Mr Mead, the core problem is that the poor have
difficulty organising their lives and responding constructively to the
opportunities that do exist. They are 'dutiful but defeated', unable to put
good intentions into practice.
The solution is not more incentives or opportunities but - horror of horrors
 -enforcement. Mr Mead strongly supports workfare, or policies that make
welfare benefits conditional on work or training. Mandatory requirements are
necessary to 'overcome the defeatism of the clients, to engage their own
energies in the quest for employment'. He claims that workfare is much less
resented by the poor than intellectuals suspect, mainly because the aim is
to enforce values that clients already possess. Indeed, some clients are
gratified to be chased up by officials because it indicates an interest in
their lives. The main purpose is not to force people unwillingly into jobs
but to ensure they organise themselves for regular activity outside the
home. 'Authority thus operates as the midwife, not the antithesis, of
freedom,' he claims.
New paternalism is still a sideshow. But as states implement the 1988 Family
Support Act, workfare requirements will become more common. It is likely to
mark the beginning of a new trend, in which government agencies demand
rather than merely encourage changes in behaviour.
The reliance on authority leaves a sour taste. But market liberals who put
freedom first should remember how much their philosophy takes for granted.
Those who flourish under capitalism have usually been subject to heavy
psychological moulding during childhood, both at school and in the home.
They have been trained to respond to the right incentives. The new
paternalists are no more authoritarian: they merely want to tackle
dependency by providing a little extra training for those who missed out in
childhood.
