   The psychedelic drug LSD is 50 years old this
year, and the Swiss chemist who discovered the now-illegal drug
that influenced a generation is trying to help raise money to
spruce up its image.
   Albert Hofmann made the first batch of lysergic acid
diethylamide-25 in 1938. But it wasn't until April 19, 1943, that
he took the first LSD trip, by accident.
   ``Some trace entered my body,'' he said. ``I don't know by which
way, maybe a drop of the solution came on my fingers.''
   While riding his bicycle home from the lab, Hofmann started to
feel like he was losing his mind.
   But as the dosage dissipated, he said, he started to ``enjoy the
experience. Then I realized it was an important discovery.''
   The mind-altering drug eventually fueled millions of trips and
inspired a new wave of poets and musicians, before a government ban
on LSD filled the streets with rivers of bad acid.
   Hofmann, 82, is touring Southern California to raise money for a
foundation that is seeking to improve LSD's image and hopes to
build a Los Angeles library in his name, dedicated to LSD and the
psychedelic movement.
   Dr. Oscar Janiger, a professor at the University of California,
Irvine, who has taken the drug 13 times, is the founder of the
Albert Hofmann Foundation.
   He said his research between 1954 and 1962 on LSD and creativity
showed the drug has important scientific applications.
   ``It was a very valuable tool because it allowed us to make some
inferences about how brain chemistry works and how the mind really
functions in perceiving things around us,'' said Janiger. ``It was
a very important adjunct to neuroscientific research, and it was
used in that way.''
   The foundation's board of advisers include poet Allen Ginsberg,
who first took LSD in a 1959 government experiment; Ram Dass, once
known as Harvard professor Richard Alpert; neuroscientist John
Lilly; and Laura Huxley, widow of author Aldous Huxley.
   Janiger envisions the library as a ``world information center''
for the study of inner space, complete with lectures, seminars,
workshops and a newsletter.
   Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the library as Janiger.
   ``If it is strictly a research thing, you can't have enough of
that,'' said Michael Pavlick, head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration's Dangerous Drug Unit in Washington. ``But with the
people involved, I hope they are not going to glorify it.''
