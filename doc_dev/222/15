FT  09 JAN 93 / Lucky seven cut their literary teeth: A look at the work of
the new novelists that WH Smith is launching this month

ONE of Aldous Huxley's characters says: 'No publisher would ever publish a
first novel if he could possibly avoid it.' This is not quite true. One or
two exceptional first novels, such as Donna Tartt's The Secret History,
published earlier this year, are fiercely competed for and reap huge
pre-publication advances.
But for the most part, taking on first novels is to publishing what planting
oak trees is to forestry: you do it more for the benefit of your successors
than yourself. A first novelist may take 10 years or more to mature into a
steady, profitable seller. WH Smith, sometimes criticised in the literary
world for its alleged indifference to the existence of worthwhile
non-bestselling novelists, is taking an initiative to try to remedy this.
It has got together with a number of fiction publishers to select seven
first novels which will all appear as paperbacks and will be given the same
high profile promotion in its shops as is currently afforded to the likes of
Danielle Steel, Catherine Cookson, Robert Ludlum and Stephen King.
Although none of the lucky seven has had a novel published before, several
of them have experience in other forms of creative writing or in working for
publishers. Valerie Windsor, whose psychological thriller Telling Stories
comes from Sinclair Stevenson, cut her dramatic teeth as one of the writers
on the Channel 4 Brookside team and has had plays broadcast.
American Jane Stanton Hitchcock is also a playwright turned novelist. Her
play, Vanilla, caught the attention of Harold Pinter, who put it on at the
Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith, London, where it rapidly came off. But it
seems she will have better luck with her novel Trick of the Eye (Penguin),
where the investigative heroine is an artist who specialises in illusion.
The assignment to re-design the ballroom of a grand Long Island home plunges
her into a world of illusion and counter-illusion that for once is not
entirely of her own devising.
Anne Billson has lived professionally in a world of illusion as the film
critic of New Statesman and, clearly, her novel Suckers (Pan) is an attempt
to cut through all the pretence this engenders, especially that surrounding
the affluent young financial high-livers of contemporary London.
Elizabeth Palmer began her professional life as a graphic designer in a
publishing house. She moved from there to the Financial Times, where she met
her husband David, now its chief executive, and then became a freelance book
designer. Two years ago, she began writing The Stainless Angel (Arrow) and
on submission of the manuscript was rewarded not just with acceptance but
also a forward-looking deal for further novels.
The story she tells is of Camilla, a widowed Englishwoman with a small son
living in Rome. She marries a fellow member of the British set. His roots
are in upper-class rural England where she finds herself obliged to live -
far from permissive Rome. How she comes to terms with his background - and
it with her - is developed in a traditional linear narrative.
Ben Woolfenden was for eight years deputy manager of a bookshop in Covent
Garden. He saw for himself all too well what shifted and what stuck on the
fiction shelves.
The model for his The Ruins of Time (Black Swan) is the Penelope Lively type
of novel which begins with an investigation of the past, after which the
trail loops disconcertingly forward into the investigator's present. In this
case, the past is that of a late 19th artists' colony in Newlyn, of which
the hero's grandfather was a member - an attractively bohemian setting.
In the case of Joanna Hines, the model is even more illustrious. Hines's
heroine in Dora's Room (Coronet) becomes the chatelaine of Chatton Heights,
where a sequence of revelations and painful remembrances awaits her in
shades of Daphne du Maurier. To underline the comparison, Hines has lived
with her Canadian husband and children in Cornwall for the past 18 years.
And, finally, Marika Cobbold is Swedish, married to an Englishman whom she
met when he was part of a Royal Naval helicopter squadron visiting
Gothenburg. Her father was the editor of a leading Swedish newspaper. But
Nordic Strindbergian gloom is the last epithet to be applied to her Guppies
for Tea (Black Swan). It is in that vein of domestic social comedy beloved
of English women novelists from time immemorial.
Martin Lee, WH Smith's product group manager for adult books who is putting
his muscle behind the launch of these seven new novelists on January 7,
said: 'We do not see the hardback as the natural format for these titles and
believe that they can become more successful as paperbacks.'
That may be so, but it does not, surely, entirely preclude their eventual
hardback publication, and indeed at least one of the titles - Dora's Room -
is being published in both formats simultaneously by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. The
fiction hardback is dead. Long live the fiction hardback]
