Zambia is the subject of the last of BBC2's series Out Of Darkness (7.50)
which has been looking at efforts to reshape African societies. The
programme considers Frederick Chiluba's chances of reversing the effects of
Kaunda's 26-year presidency which was marked by widespread corruption.
Perhaps we should be relishing current affairs programmes in peak viewing
time since many may be pushed to the margins in January when ITV comes under
the government's new whelk-stall philosophy of broadcasting. World In Action
must be a prime candidate. Today's programme records recent cases in which
American children (well, American lawyers on behalf of children) have used
the law to oppose their parents' smoking habits. Shades of Huxley's 'Brave
New World' (8.30 ITV).
The second of C4's documentaries Animal Squad Undercover (9.00) finds the
RSPCA's Special Unit investigating organised dog fighting. Panorama looks
for once at the EC from the vantage points of France and Germany, asking
whether they will create a European 'premier league'.
