HYPERMEDIA IS the product of the collision of electronic cultures; radio,
television, voice telephony and computing. It includes futuristic concepts
like hypertext, a variety of automated, electronic encyclopaedia, and
virtual reality, where the subject is transported into an electronic dream
world via a video visor and sensory gloves. A more mundane example is the
interactive video programmes extensively used in education and training.
Understanding Hypermedia: From Multimedia to Virtual Reality by Bob Cotton
and Richard Oliver (Phaidon Pounds 19.95, 160 pages) sets out to explain,
through a kaleidoscope of text and images, how individual electronic media
can be combined to yield a new and revolutionary technology which can be
controlled through language and physical gestures.
The authors believe it will dominate mass culture in the next century.
Pioneers like Ted Nelson and Vannevar Bush have argued that the hypermedia
approach to a topic is closer to the way humans think than the sequence of
information presented in books or films. Aldous Huxley would have felt
vindicated.
