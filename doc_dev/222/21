From Alexis de Tocqueville to ALF, foreigners traditionally have offered the 
most insightful comments on American mores and foibles. During the early '60s, 
Indian novelist R. K. Narayan traversed the United States, carefully recording 
his bewilderment at such curious American phenomena as cafeterias and the New 
York subway system. He's bemused by the cheerful vulgarity of a woman who 
expects facile answers to complex metaphysical questions, dismayed by the 
crudely made brew American restaurants call coffee and charmed by the reclusive 
Greta Garbo. A chapter on Los Angeles includes notes on meeting Aldous Huxley 
and various studio executives, descriptions of the vanished charms of Pershing 
Square and dismayed reactions to the smog and traffic. Highly entertaining 
sketches of the United States as seen through Indian eyes.
