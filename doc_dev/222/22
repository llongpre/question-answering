<LEADPARA>  IF "Hudson Hawk" (opening today) is half as juicy as the gossip that
surrounded it during production, we're in for one helluva ride. Bruce Willis,
fresh from his villainous turn in "Mortal Thoughts," plays the legendary cat
burglar of the title, a guy named Eddie Hawkins. Eddie is just back from a
10-year stretch in stir, and he's telling everybody he's a reformed man. Of
course no one believes him, and before you can say "To Catch a Thief -- 1991
Style," our hero is pressed back into service for a round-the-world heist that
involves three works by Leonardo da Vinci.;    "Hudson Hawk" reportedly ran
into trouble with test audiences, who couldn't tell whether it was supposed to
be arch or straight-faced or both. With Michael Lehmann ("Heathers," "Meet the
Applegates") in the director's chair, we're predicting an elaborate
cat-and-mouse number with lots of quirky twists.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Hudson Hawk" was kept from local press until the last possible moment,
leaving us to surmise: 1) the producers don't feel Lehmann pulled off his
first big-budget assignment, or 2) Eddie Hawkins shares more in common with
Steven Seagal than Peter Ustinov and the other debonair felons of "Topkapi,"
still the prototype for this kind of thing.;    - Glenn Lovell; THE ROCKING
SOUND OF NEO-FOLK SONGS;    JOHN WESLEY HARDING, last year's hands-down
favorite for Rock Rookie of the Year, is back with further proof that the age
of the neo-folkie-singer-songwriter is not over yet. The Cambridge-educated
Englishman with the rapier-sharp wit and the rather presumptuous stage name
has a second hit album on college radio ("The Name Above the Title"), a full
band and the dubious distinction of sounding more like Elvis Costello than
Costello himself.;    Saturday, Harding and the Deceivers have a 9:30 p.m.
show with the Judybats at the Catalyst, 1011 Pacific Ave., Santa Cruz.
Tickets: $6 advance, $7.50 at the door. Call (408) 423-1336. Sunday, they'll
roll into Slim's, 333 11th St., San Francisco, for a 9 p.m. show, also with
the Judybats. Tickets: $12 advance and at the door. Call (415) 621-3330.;    -
David Plotnikoff; SACRED MONSTERS AND TRIALS BY FIRE;    COLLEGE theater
rushes in where angels fear to tread -- quite literally, this week, with "The
Devils" at the University of California, Santa Cruz.;    Based on a novel by
Aldous Huxley, "The Devils of Loudun" (1952), it was adapted for the Royal
Shakespeare Company in 1960 by the brilliant playwright John Whiting, who died
in 1963 at the tragically young age of 45.;     It was drawn from a historical
incident, the 1623 witch trials in Loudun, France, where an innocent priest,
Father Urbain Grandier, was burned at the stake after he was accused of
sorcery by a convent of Ursuline nuns. Huxley clearly intended his novel to
comment on the witch trials of the McCarthy era. So does Michael Edwards,
director of Shakespeare/Santa Cruz, who is staging "The Devils" as a
commentary on Moral Majority politics.;    "The Devils" plays at 8
tonight-Saturday and 3 p.m. Sunday in the Performing Arts Theater. It repeats
next weekend on the same schedule. Tickets: $8, $4.50 for students and
seniors. Call (408) 459-2159.;    - Judith Green; TERRIFYING IMAGES OF A
LUNATIC WORLD;    WITH his smooth surfaces and hallucinatory realism, Bay Area
painter Alonso Smith gives us images that reflect the madness of our times,
the tyranny of technology and war.;    Smith takes on big issues in his
retrospective spanning the years 1943-90 at the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum.
In "Cornucopia," an abundance of trinkets that dazzle and bind consumers to a
"no-win game" emerges from a Pentagon wheel-of-chance. In "Medical
Malpractice," the surgeon, knife in hand, is about to remove a peace symbol
from his patient's brain.;    The exhibition continues through June 9. The
museum is at Rosicrucian Park, Park and Naglee avenues, San Jose. Hours: 9
a.m.-5 p.m., Tuesdays-Sundays. Tickets: $4, $3.50 seniors and students, $2
children. Call (408) 287-9171.; - Dorothy Burkhart; WOLFGANG HELPS EAST MEET
WEST;    THERE are countless performances of Mozart's "Requiem" around this
year, but none is like Wednesday night's 7:30 p.m. concert in St. Joseph
Cathedral, San Jose.;    The singing will involve an international
brotherhood: the San Jose Symphonic Choir joined by the Washu Citizens' Chorus
from San Jose's sister city, Okayama, Japan. Leroy G. Kromm will conduct with
orchestra.;    In addition, the Japanese choir will perform traditional
numbers under director Yasukazu Kondo, including "Sayonara" and, for female
voices only, "Aru Kazu ni Yosete.";    Tickets: $10 at the door. Call (408)
280-0265.; Paul Hertelendy; SACRAMENTO LETS THE GOOD TIMES ROLL;    Forget the
Big Easy. If it's jazz you want this weekend, go to the Big Tomato. The 18th
annual Sacramento Dixieland Jubilee -- the largest such festival in the world,
with 118 bands playing at 46 sites -- is expected to draw more than 100,000
from today through Monday. But that's no reason you should stay away.;   
Getting into one of those jazz sites isn't that hard. Head to a ticket trailer
at one of the six centers (free shuttles run between them): Old Sacramento,
Cal Expo, the Clarion, the El Rancho, the Radisson, the Convention Center.
Badges run from $20 for half a day to $65 for the full weekend. (For more
information, call 916 372-5277.);    Old Sacramento is the festival's home
base, but the hotels offer more comfortable seating and dance floors and the
parking is easiest at Cal Expo. For jazz with a foreign accent, listen to the
Allotria Jazz Band from Germany or the Budapest Ragtime Band from Hungary. For
country-western jazz, it's Igor's Cowboy Jazz Band. The Bay Area's polished
Royal Society Jazz Orchestra specializes in early '20s jazz.;    Other crowd
favorites to check out are Mr. Jack Daniel's Original Silver Cornet Band and
Big Tiny Little. And when you've heard "Do You Know What It Means to Miss New
Orleans" 57 times, you'll know it's time to head home.;    -- Linda Zavoral  </TEXT>
