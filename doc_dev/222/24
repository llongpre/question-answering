   Naguib Mahfouz, winner of the 1988 Nobel
Prize for Literature, is a habitue of bazaar coffee shops and once
called his writing ``fourth or fifth rate.''
   Although he ranks among Egypt's most popular writers, Mahfouz's
realistic, almost Dickensian portrayals of the wretched conditions
under which his country's poor live have made his popularity less
than unanimous.
   One book of his was banned from Egypt, and another attacked
then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser's domestic and pan-Arabist
policies.
   Widely translated, he writes in Arabic but has little respect
for Arab writers, including himself. Once asked to rate his work,
Mahfouz said: ``Probably like the rest of modern Arabic literature,
fourth or fifth rate.''
   He spends an hour a day in the coffee shops of Khan Khalili,
soaking in the ambiance of one of the Middle East's oldest and
largest bazaars.
   He is widely popular throughout the region but does not relish
public acclaim.
   Mahfouz was born in Cairo in 1911, the youngest child of a
lower-middle-class family. He showed no interest in foreign
literature before he entered the King Fuad I University in 1930,
but his strongest influences in college became the
turn-of-the-century British social realist novelists and Victorian
writers.
   Scholars generally place Mahfouz's writing in three periods:
   The first featured ``Trilogy,'' a 1,500-page partly
autobiographical work he completed in 1952. That period entailed
three historical novels and then a series on social themes,
detailing the struggles of Egyptian society.
   Mahfouz's second period began in 1959, when he turned away from
social realism toward metaphysical allegory. The specialists
Marsden Jones and Hamdi Sakkut wrote in 1978 that in this period
Mahfuz ``forsook ... man in society for man in time.''
   Beginning with ``Miramar'' in 1967, which took aim at Nasser's
domestic and pan-Arabist policies, Mahfouz's third period shows a
synthesis of the first two periods.
   Mahfouz's novels are more historical chronicles than political
treatises, their only political meaning being a tangential
reflection of conditions that politics cause.
   Nevertheless, after Nasser's Free Officers Movement overthrew
the Egyptian monarchy in 1952, Mahfouz showed his displeasure by
stopping writing for seven years.
   His 1959 allegory ``Children of Gebelawi,'' which included
characters based on Adam and Eve, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed and a
modern scientist, was banned because it contained religious themes
deemed unacceptable in Arab society.
   Although he writes in Arabic, his knowledge of ancient Arabic
literature is slight. He much prefers writers of the English
language _ Joyce, Huxley, Orwell, Faulkner, Hemingway _ and Balzac,
Sartre, Proust and Camus in the French.
   He once told an interviewer that William Shakespeare, James
Joyce and Leo Tolstoy are examples of first-rate writers;
second-raters were H.G. Wells, Dickens, Thackeray, Shaw,
Galsworthy, Huxley and D.H. Lawrence.
   But he said he never had read doesn't want to read lesser
European writers than those, ``adding that he did not suppose many
Europeans would be interested in modern Arabic literature, as it
has produced only such writing.''
   John Rodenbeck, a professor of literature at the American
University in Cairo who as head of the university press was
Mahfouz's publisher for nine years, called him ``the greatest
novelist of the Arab world, living or otherwise.''
   He said Mahfouz's ``impact on prose narrative will probably be
everlasting in the Arab world.''
