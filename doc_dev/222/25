   Lady Ashton, better known as Madge Garland, who
was fashion editor of English Vogue in the 1930s and founded the
Royal College of Art's Fashion School, has died, according to news
reports Wednesday. She was 92.
   She had been cared for at a London convent in recent years and
died Sunday, The Times of London reported. It gave no cause of
death and funeral details were not announced.
   She was born Madge McHarg on June 12, 1898, in Melbourne,
Australia, where her father was in business. She grew up in London
and became a journalist in the 1920s, first working for English
Vogue with novelist Aldous Huxley and photographer Cecil Beaton,
and later free-lancing for Women's Wear Daily in the United States.
   Her friends included the couturier Paul Poiret and the sculptor
Brancusi. She chose clothes for Virginia Woolf. Artists Marie
Laurencin and Edward Wolfe painted her and she was one of Beaton's
earliest subjects.
   She returned to English Vogue as fashion editor from 1933,
bringing readers the best of Paris fashion until World War II.
   She became merchandising manager for London's main department
store, Bourne and Hollingsworth, during the war and designed some
fashion. After the war, she visited the United States to study
ready-to-wear marketing methods for the British fashion industry.
   In 1947, Sir Robin Darwin of the Royal College of Art invited
her to found the first British school of fashion. As Professor
Garland, she opened the school the following year and remained at
its head until 1956. Designers David Sassoon and Gina Fratini were
among her students.
   During the 1960s, she produced five books on fashion, beauty and
the history of costumes.
   She was married briefly in the 1920s to Capt. Ewart Garland. In
1953, she married Sir Leigh Ashton, then director of Victoria and
Albert Museum. The marriage lasted less than a year although they
were not divorced until 1962. She retained the name Lady Ashton for
formal purposes.
   She had no children.
