LAST Sunday, Radio 4, determined to ease us out of the distress we must all
have felt at the Merseyside news, showed us lives of restraint. First, the
start of Goodbye to All That, where Simon Parkes visits artistic
communities. His first was Deya in Majorca, famous as the retreat of Robert
Graves. Even in its best days it was evidently not without its faults; the
poet Brian Patten recalled 'screaming drunks'. But quiet and, in those days,
hard of access.
An hour after this came In Search of Utopia, also about life in communities,
but of a different kind. Presenter Felicity Goodall dealt mainly with the
feelings of children in such places, where (at Bruderhof, for example)
child-care, meals and property are all communally organised, and no intimacy
is allowed until a couple are engaged. At Findhorn in the north of Scotland,
perhaps the oddest of the visits, there is communication not only with
plants but with fairies and elves, and this a religious foundation. It seems
to work; cabbages grow there up to 40 lb] More communities next week.
Until the end of March, Radio 3 is reviewing the arts of the 1920s. Here is
some of what is to come: archive recordings of literary grandees on their
contemporaries; popular music of the time, English, American, German and
even Russian; today's critics on new views of the then-current novelists;
Maria Jolas, wife of the founder of Transition, on Paris figures like
Picasso, Stravinsky and Joyce; a reappraisal of Aldous Huxley, with readings
of some of his stories. Last Sunday's talk by Vita Sackville-West on Orlando
and tomorrow's by Prince Antoine Bibesco on Proust make a good start. But
Radio 3 listeners who complain about too much talk will be very cross.
Fay Weldon's The Hole in the Top of the World on Radio 3 on Sunday is
basically a romantic piece. Matt, a famous scientist, studies the ozone
layer from a lab in the Antarctic with Nina, a young female scientist and
rival to his wife Simone, but Ms Weldon does not write basic pieces. Simone
thinks Matt to be in danger, not only from Nina, sharing his work and
contemplating marriage, but from 'the UVs' through the hole in the ozone.
The hole, Simone believes, is due not to CFCs but to all our illusions
breaking out into space. This theory is more interesting than Simone's trip
to the Antarctic lab with her toy-boy Andrew, soon seduced by Nina. Perhaps
it is basic, after all. The cast are all American, with Walter Matthau as
Matt, not one of his great performances. The co-production with LA Theatre
Works was recorded in Santa Monica under Shaun MacLoughlin.
On Thursday Radio 4 gave The Architect's Dream by Neil Rhodes. The dream was
to build a two-mile-high city, clearing all the neighbouring land, but
Ashley, the architect, retired first, and is now just building an extension
to his retired neighbour Eric's house. Eric's wife, Mildred, is as silly as
Ashley's wife Kay is bossy, and the two dislike one another within
neighbourly bounds. Eric, making a model of Ashley's dream, sensibly bashes
Mildred with a hammer. Disputes are forgotten when Ashley visits him in the
prison hospital. Kay and Mildred become mates too, and that's about all
there is. I thought the characters boring and the dialogue dull. Richard
Wortley directed.
