ROBERT BRIDGES: A BIOGRAPHY
by Catherine Phillips
Oxford Pounds 25, 363 pages
LARKIN gave Bridges five entries in The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century
English Verse and that seems about right compared (say) with Yeats's 20. 'A
Passery-By' and 'April 1885' show Bridges at his solemnly rhetorical best;
the much anthologised 'London Snow' reveals his skill at delineating
landscape and in matching sound to sense; and 'Poor Poll' his humorous
virtuosity with the long syllabic line, incorporating sentences in Latin,
Greek, German, Italian and French into its texture.
Then Larkin ends with 'Ethick,' part of the final section of The Testament
of Beauty containing Bridges' thoughts on prayer. That poem in four parts -
an extended paean as much to Reason as to Beauty, published in 1929 - was
Bridges' swan-song. By then, he was a vigorous 85-year-old poet laureate,
awarded the OM by King George V to whom the Testament is dedicated.
Its sales took the Clarendon Press at Oxford by surprise. They originally
printed around 2,000 copies, but 19,000 had been sold by January 1930 and it
went through edition after edition until the mid-1940s. It went out of
fashion as Eliot's Four Quartets, a similar kind of poem, came in.
The face Bridges presents to us in his work, and in the photographs
contained in this biography, is that of a Georgian man of letters par
excellence. He belonged to the last generation of poets before modernism
took over and subversion of the social order through literary work became
the norm. In Bridges, we have a supreme example of the writer, not as any
kind of rebel, but as a respectable member of society helping to prop up its
foundations.
Bridges combined this with deep concern for the purity of the English tongue
and a zeal to reform our language's illogical spelling. That campaign, which
involved the Oxford Press trotting out several new typographical symbols in
order to print his Society for Pure English pamphlets in his private
alphabet, came to nought.
Ezra Pound, who was a contemporary, admired one or two of Bridges' lyrics.
The two men met and Bridges - of whose charm of manner Catherine Philips
gives examples - went through Pound's Personae and Exultations helpfully,
commenting on the style.
Afterwards, though, Pound could not resist putting in the boot. 'I spose,'
he wrote in a note to TS Eliot, 'I can cite what I once said of Britches? I
managed to dig about 10 lines of Worse Libre out of one of his leetle
bookies.'
It is characteristic Poundage: highly amusing and grossly unfair. Bridges
was not a particular champion of vers libre and his 'leetle bookies' are
full of examples of a consummate use of rhyme and other meticulously
executed metrical forms. As a poet, Bridges was not in the least complacent;
he experimented continually, at one stage taking classical prosody as his
model.
Beginning in 1912, Bridges' reign as poet laureate was long and prestigious,
but he has had bad luck since. He is remembered by the literary world not as
a poet in his own right but as the friend and literary executor of Hopkins,
especially as the individual responsible for preventing Hopkins' work from
seeing the light of day fully until the end of the First World War.
Many years after Hopkins' death. Bridges wrote to Hopkins' mother and
explained that it was because he himself was trying to write poems in sprung
rhythm that he did not wish the poetry-reading public to have - for the
present, at any rate - the confusing example of Hopkins' eccentric use of
it.
Was Bridges merely being self-seeking in this most controversial decision of
his life? Bridges' latest biographer has a foot in both camps, being also
the editor of the Oxford Authors' edition of Hopkins and of his selected
letters. Phillips suggests, somewhat tentatively, that it was more a case of
Bridges being naive and perhaps a little arrogant than of anything else.
Bridges admired the work of his old Oxford contemporary and friend but,
having rescued it from the Jesuits, did not see just what a poetic bombshell
he was sitting on. It was only after the great success of Bridges' wartime
anthology The Spirit of Man (1916) - a fascinating insight into Bridges'
eclectic taste in literature and philosophy, in which he published some of
Hopkins' poems alongside Rimbaud's - that he felt the time was ripe for an
edition of them.
Phillips does not allow the relations with Hopkins to take up a
disproportionate share of this carefully written life. She traces Bridges'
early years - after his education at Eton and Oxford - as a doctor,
including a spell in the casualty department at a top London hospital. There
followed his happy marriage to Monica, daughter of Alfred Waterhouse, the
architect.
Bridges met his wife through living on Waterhouse's estate at Yattendon,
near Newbury. After that came Bridges' decision to give up medicine and
become a full-time poet and essayist. Like Maugham's similar decision, it
eventually paid off.
When Waterhouse died, the couple used some of their inheritance to build a
permanent home they called Chilswell on Boar's Hill. Once they were
established there (surviving a disastrous fire), Oxford welcomed Bridges
back into the academic and musical fold with honorary fellowships, recitals
and dining rights. Bridges' early friendships with late Victorians like
Henry Newbolt, Digby Mackworth Dolben and Canon Richard Watson Dixon are
balanced at the other end of the scale by his exchanges with Bloomsberries
like EM Forster and Clive Bell.
Let us leave him entertaining Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley and Ottoline
Morrell on Boar's Hill. Woolf writes that Bridges 'sprang from a
rhododendron bush, a very lean tall old man with a curly grey hat and a
reddish ravaged face, smoky fierce eyes, with a hazy look in them; very
active, rather hoarse, talking incessantly.' This book serves him well in
the quiet, painstaking, scholarly way he would, surely, have appreciated.
