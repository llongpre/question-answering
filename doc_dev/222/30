On April 10, 1920, Virginia Woolf noted in her diary, "Mrs. Ward is dead; poor 
Mrs. Humphry Ward; and it appears that she was merely a woman of straw after 
all -- shovelled into the grave and already forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ward had been dead two weeks. Seventy years later, although largely 
unread, she is not altogether forgotten, and John Sutherland's bold 
disinterment of this prolific writer and prodigious personality who towered 
over Victorian and Edwardian England makes enthralling reading. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of her fame, Mrs. Humphry Ward, as she always styled herself 
(less a gesture of matronly modesty than a claim to masculine authority), 
commanded vast readerships and vast advances on both sides of the Atlantic. 
From 1888, America was swamped by competing pirate editions of "Robert 
Elsmere," her mammoth novel of religious doubt. To her horror, free copies were 
given away with Maine's Balsam Fir Soap, described by Sutherland, with typical 
dryness, as "a newly launched product which wished to impress on consumers the 
literal truth of cleanliness being next to godliness." 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland compares the novel's American success to that of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" 
in Britain, both nations being virtuously fascinated by problems they did not 
have to face. The issue now raised, in Oliver Wendell Holmes' words, was the 
long-needed purging of "the obstructed channels of the decrepit theological 
system," and even, so it was thought, the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the excitement was caused by the reaction of Gladstone, the British 
prime minister to whom the book represented a dangerous national trend toward 
agnosticism. He wrote a long, vehement, essay, "Robert Elsmere, and the Battle 
of Belief," and, obsessed by the book, demanded a private interview with its 
author on the evening after her mother's death. Their passionate argument was 
resumed at breakfast; she left "the wonderful old man" white-faced, leaning on 
the table, while she, trembling but unbeaten, went to follow the hearse. 
</P>
<P>
The encounter typifies more than Mary Ward's love of a good fight. She wrote, 
Sutherland suggests, precisely to prove herself to men of authority and power 
like Gladstone; the heirs of her grandfather, Thomas Arnold of Rugby: Jowett, 
Pattison and Pater at Oxford and J. R. Green in London; and above all, her own 
errant, backsliding father, Tom, and her uncle, Matthew Arnold. Her best novels 
-- "Robert Elsmere," "Marcella" and the fine "Helbeck of Bannisdale" -- 
re-worked not only her own experience but the religious rifts that drove her 
parents, and her age, apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Uncle Matt" memorably dismissed Mary's first novel, "Miss Bretherton," 
published in 1884: "No Arnold can write a novel; if they could, I should have 
done it" -- doubly cruel, since she so wanted acceptance as a true Arnold. 
Nonetheless, she went on to become, in Sutherland's phrase, a "fiction 
machine," churning out novels to support her family. 
</P>
<P>
Her earnings were high, and her fiction was serialized for top prices in 
America in the Century, Harpers and the Ladies' Home Journal (whose cheap 
presentation galled her pride while it filled her purse). But rather than 
helping her family, she may have crushed them instead. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband Humphry, art critic of the Times of London, took refuge in buying 
old masters (often fakes) and playing billiards at the Athenaeum. Refusing to 
enfranchise her clever daughters, Mary heaped her ambitions on her son, the 
ominously christened Arnold: Ineffectual in politics, disgraced in the army, 
his gambling debts absorbed all she had so laboriously gained. 
</P>
<P>
Irony also marks Mary Ward's other achievements. A founder of Somerville, the 
first women's college in Oxford, in 1879, she went on to become the tireless 
leader of the Anti-Suffrage Movement and to write a virulently anti-suffragist 
novel, "Delia Blanchflower." She opened two settlements for the London poor 
(University Hall and the Passmore Edwards Settlement), started the day-center 
movement and introduced schools for the physically handicapped, but spent her 
last years among the Hertfordshire gentry, a staunch Conservative and 
imperialist. 
</P>
<P>
A final flourish of transatlantic fame followed her vivid, jingoistic accounts 
of life in the trenches. The first of these, "England's Effort," was written in 
response to a suggestion made in December of 1915 by her friend, former 
President Theodore Roosevelt, that articles from Mary Ward, who was at the 
time, Sutherland says, "the best-known Englishwoman in America," might help him 
to swing American opinion in favor of entering the war. 
</P>
<P>
What lay behind her urgent, swerving career? In 1856, when she was 5, her 
family returned to England after Tom Arnold's first swing to Catholicism had 
put an end to a promising career as education secretary in Tasmania. When her 
parents, with her younger brothers and sisters, decamped to live under John 
Henry Newman's wing in Dublin, Mary was left stranded in Westmoreland with her 
Arnold grandmother. Lonely and fiery-tempered, she struggled through grim 
boarding schools for the next 10 years until she rejoined her family, by now 
established in Oxford. From then on, Sutherland portrays her as driven by a 
desperate need to be "at the center" -- of Oxford, London, the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Steely self-will and hidden vulnerability were blended in her dealings with her 
family, her publishers and her political allies. All are meticulously 
chronicled here. 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland's approach, though cool and unblinkered, is consistently 
sympathetic; yet even he sometimes displays an appalled fascination at his 
subject's monstrous energy, all the more striking since she was wracked by 
constant, devastating illnesses (which, like those of Josephine Butler or 
Florence Nightingale, often proved strategically useful). She battled on 
against all odds, dosing herself with remedies that would make a pharmacist 
pale, including a cherished hoard of "cocaine lozenges." 
</P>
<P>
As the Great War ended, younger writers -- Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, H. 
G. Wells, Rebecca West -- attacked or ridiculed "Mrs H. W." as the embodiment 
of the most stifling Victorian values. Their hostility was a measure of her 
power. Even 16 years after she died, her nephew Aldous Huxley drew her as the 
smothering Mrs. Foxe in "Eyeless in Gaza." 
</P>
<P>
She left no literary heirs, and in that sense she was, as Woolf said, "a woman 
of straw." But "splendid" was Mary Ward's favorite adjective -- and splendid, 
in an awesome, even tragic way -- is exactly what she was.
