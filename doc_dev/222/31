<TEXT>
<P>
1989 was the year George Orwell was proved wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Television, it has turned out, is not the ultimate tool of repression. 
</P>
<P>
In the year that Eastern Europe surged toward democracy, communications 
technology served the cause of liberation. The stories trickle in from country 
after country -- of Solidarity videotapes secretly screened in Polish church 
basements, of Cable News Network broadcasts picked up by satellite dishes in 
Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as Europe reshapes itself, the question is whether the opposite is true: 
</P>
<P>
Is technology actually democratizing? As the Eastern Bloc moves further toward 
economic modernization, does democracy become inevitable? 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate answer may be long in coming. The information revolution has 
barely begun in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, some believe Orwell's only mistake in his novel "1984" was 
thinking that television exercises control by inflicting pain. Maybe, as Aldous 
Huxley suggested, TV controls by inflicting pleasure -- a notion that might 
produce the advertising expert as political kingmaker and the pitchman as 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
But what is clear, and still largely unappreciated, is that the fall of the 
Iron Curtain was at least in part a revolution of technology. 
</P>
<P>
It was the need to modernize in the technological age that forged Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms in the first place. The act of 
modernizing then granted people access to the outside world that fueled their 
discontent -- and later helped their underground movements escape detection. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Gorbachev's challenge now is largely technological: How can he 
maintain political control while embracing technology that will decentralize 
information and undermine central authority? 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa asked the question differently: "Is it 
possible for a new Stalin to appear today who could murder people?" In an era 
of computers and satellite TV, he concluded, "It's impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly technology is not the single cause of change in Eastern Europe. 
Events of such sweep require a confluence of factors, from the talents of 
Mikhail Gorbachev to the aging of the postwar generation that embraced 
communism, from mounting ethnic strife to -- perhaps most critically -- the 
growing economic gap with the West. 
</P>
<P>
But today economic opportunity goes hand in hand with technology. "These 
reforms are a result of civilization -- of computers, satellite TV (and other 
innovations) that present alternative solutions," Walesa told a recent luncheon 
gathering of journalists from the Washington Post and Newsweek. Gorbachev and 
he, Walesa said, "just happen to be people in the right time in the right 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
He is right that throughout the last decade, technology seemed the servant of 
revolution, not of repression. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first cases actually was in Iran. The Islamic revolutionary 
underground used audio cassettes to circulate the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 
speeches throughout Iran, where one in four citizens was either working for or 
informing to the shah's secret police. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the use of technology for revolution spread to the very medium 
Orwell had seen as the ultimate tool of suppression -- television. 
</P>
<P>
Orwell feared the medium because it was centrally controlled, perfect for an 
authoritarian regime he called Big Brother. But in the 1980s the nature of the 
medium changed, at least in degrees, with the spread of satellite technology 
and videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irresistible Machines 
</P>
<P>
Videocassette recorders gave people some choice over what they could watch and 
allowed them to interact, even record their own images. So irresistible did the 
machines become to Eastern Europeans that they were allowed even in the most 
closed societies, such as Romania. In 1988, the Soviet daily newspaper Izvestia 
talked about "the currently fashionable passion for videotapes." 
</P>
<P>
The effect was distinctly political, even if people were mainly watching 
Western films on videotape. "Blue jeans and rock music and the message of 
possibility . . . the underlying message of being an individual," these were 
the subliminal political cues of the VCR, said Jessica Lipnack, whose 
consulting firm, the Networking Institute, studies the impact of technology on 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, where the opposition was better organized, the VCR became a way of 
sustaining an underground, not merely fueling dissent. Solidarity kept itself 
alive from 1981 to 1988, among other means, by making video documentaries -- 
everything from biographies of Solidarity leaders to documentaries about 
demonstrations the official media tried to dismiss -- and screening them in 
secret in church basements and community centers. 
</P>
<P>
Another force undermining government control of television was satellite 
technology. Those who had satellite dishes -- some of them homemade -- could 
receive programming from anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Channel 
</P>
<P>
One of the most watched channels was the U.S. Cable News Network, which CNN 
executive vice president Ed Turner said was received in government offices in 
several East Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Even second-level and third-level managers and clerks can see another way of 
life," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
And when CNN correspondents arrived in such capitals as Bucharest, Sofia and 
Budapest, they were viewed as celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
The political impact of satellites was most profound in Hungary and Poland, 
where the manufacture and purchase of satellite dishes were legal. 
</P>
<P>
The effect, even if only the elite class had the dishes, was to force Polish 
and Hungarian official television to either become more open or become 
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
When Poland instituted martial law in 1981, media-savvy Poles were already 
disgusted enough with official media that they moved their TV sets to face out 
of their windows as a silent protest. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, the Polish media had changed so much that the government signed a 
contract to air a nightly half-hour newscast from CNN. Among other things, that 
program forced Polish television to dump its longtime anchor for someone more 
telegenic. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was what experts have taken to calling "spillover" viewing. 
</P>
<P>
People in East Berlin could watch West German TV. They watched Austrian TV in 
Hungary, Finnish TV in Soviet Estonia and the liberalized Polish TV all over, 
in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and parts of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The spillover viewing forced the "democratization of official Soviet TV," said 
Adrian Karatnycky, research director for the AFL-CIO, which was instrumental in 
supplying technology and funding to Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
In Timisoara, Romania, ethnic Hungarians saw the liberalized Hungarian 
television and could watch news each night about the changes elsewhere in 
Eastern Europe. That was one reason, some think, that the Romanian revolution 
started in Timisoara. 
</P>
<P>
And so the media became the force behind the domino, as the Poles inspired the 
Hungarians, the Hungarians inspired the East Germans and the East Germans 
inspired the Czechoslovaks. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened in Poland could not be kept silent. Everybody saw it," said 
Gordon Schultz of the Walker Center, an ecumenical group working to support 
democratic change in China and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the power of the video and satellite underground was that, unlike 
Western radio broadcasts such as Radio Free Europe and the British Broadcasting 
Corp., it offered visual proof that made its message undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
And it was indigenous. It did not bear the stigma of originating with the 
American government. 
</P>
<P>
Less important in Eastern Europe were fax machines. But they played a major 
role in China. 
</P>
<P>
The Walker Center estimates that during the democracy movement last spring, 
there were 30,000 fax machines in China, many of them in private businesses, 
and 3 to 4 million phone lines in Beijing alone. Schultz said the fax machines 
provided a crucial way for reformers to communicate with the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't think people in the rest of world know or care that you are 
giving up your life," Schultz said, "you are much less likely to give it up." 
</P>
<P>
And in some countries there were even computers. 
</P>
<P>
John Micgiel, assistant director of the Institute on East Central Europe at 
Columbia University, estimates there are now 1.5 million personal computers in 
Poland, probably the highest number in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, Solidarity even tried to transmit lists of technical needs to the 
West on computers in secret code, according to Karatnycky of AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, technology aided the surge toward democracy by offering people 
"knowledge that there was a better life beyond their borders," said Richard 
Perle, a former assistant secretary of defense who is now at the American 
Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Technology offered people hope by letting them know they had support in the 
West. It gave them the power to communicate, without detection by the 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catch-22' Seen 
</P>
<P>
And on a deeper level, technology also proved to be a fundamental cause of the 
democratic movement. Laurien Alexandre, director of global studies at the 
Immaculate Heart College Center in Los Angeles, sees a "Catch-22" in the 
Eastern European Communist regimes' need for technology to compete economically 
with the West. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as you integrate these technologies into your economy and make them 
available to a larger range of people, you develop an information middle class 
who are not part of your leadership," Alexandre said. "And this stuff you can't 
control. You can't close down the fax machines because your economy will stop." 
</P>
<P>
S. Frederick Starr, the Soviet scholar who is president of Oberlin College, 
calls the result "technocratic glasnost." 
</P>
<P>
"Privatized information stimulates the formation of public opinion" and 
"induces individuation," Starr has written in an essay still unpublished. 
Subjects became citizens. Their world became more international. 
</P>
<P>
Technology, in other words, bred pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
And once the technology became decentralized, controlling it would have exacted 
a high price, economically and politically. As Wilson Dizard of the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies put it, "You don't pull out the phone 
system." Thus, Dizard said, "whether Gorbachev lasts or not, it will last." 
</P>
<P>
But if technology is not inherently suppressive, it is also not perfectly 
democratizing. 
</P>
<P>
If it were, logically television and computers would have improved democracy in 
America. Instead, they seem to have brought on an era of media consultants, 
negative campaigning and the science of sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
Even apart from the American experience, not all technology is inherently 
democratizing. The fax machine, for instance, is actually no more secure from 
being monitored than any phone line, said Kenneth Flamm of the Brookings 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
Monitoring fax machines requires technology to record and then decode the fax 
transmissions. And in China, where technology is scarce, that was difficult. 
Still, about two weeks after massacring protesters in Tian An Men Square, the 
Chinese government managed to quash the fax underground by stationing a guard 
near most of the fax machines in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
More complex is television. While it was made more democratic and interactive 
by satellites and videocassettes and small cameras, it is still largely a 
centrally controlled medium. In most countries in the world, indeed, television 
is government-run. 
</P>
<P>
So some analysts say one factor that will determine the new face of Eastern 
Europe is which factions control the television stations, and whether they will 
allow open and pluralistic programming. 
</P>
<P>
"That fight is going on now," said Dizard, who has written extensively about 
the information revolution. 
</P>
<P>
And the outcome, he said, will be determined by internal politics more than by 
technology. The strong tradition of a healthy underground press in Poland, for 
instance, was one of the reasons that Solidarity was able to survive in secret, 
experts said. The same traditions are not nearly so strong in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
If any technology possesses intrinsically liberating qualities, those who study 
politics and communications believe it is the computer. 
</P>
<P>
Computers empower the individual, granting access to vast resources of 
information. "You can crunch a hundred pages onto a floppy disc, reproduce it 
cheaply and disseminate it to thousands," said Flamm of Brookings. "Compare 
that even to a Xerox machine." 
</P>
<P>
To date, however, there are not enough computers in Eastern Europe even to help 
modernize those countries' economies, let alone to dictate democratic social 
organization, those familiar with technology there report. 
</P>
<P>
And the other forms of communications technology are also in short supply. A 
month ago, Karatnycky of the AFL-CIO tried to fax some information to the 
Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry, only to find that "there are no fax machines in 
the Foreign Ministry in Czechoslovakia." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a long way to go," conceded Eric Chenoweth, who is studying the 
information revolution in the Eastern Bloc for the American Federation of 
Teachers and who believes that democracy is inevitable if technology advances 
quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does technology eliminate the other sources of authority. 
</P>
<P>
Even if communism can no longer demand total conformity, said Walter Raymond, 
assistant director of the U.S. Information Agency, "that doesn't mean you don't 
have a state power structure that keeps the troops in line." 
</P>
<P>
And not everyone is convinced of the microchip's democratizing qualities in the 
first place. Karatnycky of the AFL-CIO believes technology may have abetted 
reform in the 1980s simply because "these guys are much more clever and 
technology-oriented than the ossified elites they were confronting." 
</P>
<P>
Technology can still be used to maintain central control, he said. "Computers 
can be used to keep track of dissidents." 
</P>
<P>
Orwell's only mistake may have been in predicting the means by which television 
controlled the population, argued Neil Postman, author of "Amusing Ourselves to 
Death," a scathing critique of the social impact of televison in America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trivial Culture 
</P>
<P>
"In Orwell's book," Postman said, "people are controlled by inflicting pain." 
The truth, he said, may be closer to Aldous Huxley's vision, in which people 
are controlled by inflicting pleasure. "Huxley argues that you can control 
people by making their culture essentially trivial," Postman said. 
</P>
<P>
The experience of the United States supports Postman's argument. As the power 
of the centralized political parties has waned, individual politicians have 
learned to use the media to practice a more subtle form of influence and 
manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
Thus "spin control" could replace the old Communist technique of airbrushing 
people out of photographs -- a technique rendered obsolete by satellites and 
VCRs. Conducting sophisticated studies of survey research to better manipulate 
public opinion could replace the old-fashioned technique of registering 
typewriters. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, that is the path Gorbachev seems to be following, scholars such as 
Dizard and Starr argue. Gorbachev's great insight, said Postman, is that "he 
understood at some level that it was no longer possible to have a closed 
society," thanks to forces in place long before he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
That is one explanation of why he founded two major institutes, complete with 
25 regional centers, to study public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
They even measure Gorbachev's popularity rating now. 
</P>
<P>
But the tools of modern pluralistic politics do not guarantee success. Poland's 
leaders founded an institute to study public opinion in 1983 -- two years 
before Gorbachev came to power. Czechoslovakia and Hungary started public 
opinion institutes in 1988. Yet the governments of all three countries fell in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's "calculated gamble," said Dizard, is that Soviet leadership can 
move toward a pluralistic society "and still keep essential control." 
</P>
<P>
Dizard, for one, does not like the Soviet leaders' odds: "The long-term answer 
is they are not going to be able to."
