You cannot escape themes these days. This is British Science Week and Radio
3 is having a 1930s season. One programme manages to fit under both
headings: Yesterday's Tomorrows looks back to a time when, it is claimed,
'there was no science fiction but there was scientific romance' from HG
Wells to Aldous Huxley (9.30 R3). Before that Radio 3 offers an opportunity
to hear Let 'Em Eat Cake, a musical by George and Ira Gershwin, first
performed in 1933. This production stars Denis Quilley, Kim Criswell and
Joss Ackland (7.30).
There is more evidence of British Sience Week on BBC2, which is mounting
four discussions on successive nights at Bristol's science museum, The
Exploratory which is also the title of the series. Today's subject is why
some people win Nobel Prizes while others are ostracised (11.15).
Earlier Horizon looks back to the extraordinary hullabaloo which followed
the claim five years ago that fusion had been achieved in water by
Fleischmann and Pons in a test tube in an ordinary lab (8.00 BBC2).
