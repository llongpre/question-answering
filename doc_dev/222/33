<LEADPARA>  THOUGH the great Soviet experiment lasted a little less than 75 years, few
political systems have so changed a people in so short a time.;   We will be
sifting through the political and economic rubble of the former Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics for decades as those republics break apart and
regroup. But whatever its deficiencies as a social system, the Soviet Union
made an indelible mark on our cultural history and identity.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Theater in Revolution: Russian Avant-Garde Stage Design 1913-35" (opening
Saturday and running through Feb. 16 at the California Palace of the Legion of
Honor) tackles the important contribution of early Soviet artists to
contemporary theater, where their work was truly revolutionary.;   Futurists
all, they saw art as the way to betterment, an upward vector in the maelstrom
of civil war, political turmoil, revolutionary splinter groups and economic
chaos that characterized the first years of the new Bolshevist state.;   "Art
is a powerful means of infecting those around us with ideas, feelings and
moods," said Anatolii Lunacharsky, the new Soviet republic's Commissioner of
Enlightenment, in a proclamation quoted in the exhibit catalog. "Agitation and
propaganda acquire particular acuity and effectiveness when they are clothed
in the attractive and mighty forms of art.";   Especially in theater, as well
as the related disciplines of opera and ballet, these artists turned the world
upside down -- a masculine inversion sorely needed after the woolly femininity
of the Mauve Decade. Theater has never looked back.;   Except in the Soviet
Union. Less than 25 years later, the artistic establishment, held in the
brutal grip of politics, turned on itself in an unprecedented act of
self-hatred. Repudiating its former brilliance, it instituted a system as
reactionary as it had been progressive, as trivial as it had been profound, as
simplistic as it had been intelligent.;   It was easy to fix the bracketing
dates of the exhibit, explained its organizer, Nancy van Norman Baer of the
Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. "Victory Over the Sun," a 1913 opera with
music by Mikhail Matiushin and design by Kazimir Malevich, was virtually a
manifesto of the new Soviet art: forward-looking, aggressive, complex and
bold. As for the ending: By 1935, the creeping petrifaction of socialist
realism, whose doctrines had been first set forth by the Union of Soviet
Writers three years earlier, reached the theater.;   THE premise of "Theater
in Revolution" would be striking enough if the art came from Western museums.
(In fact, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco's substantial holdings of
work by Russian emigre designers who created for Serge Diaghilev and the
Ballets Russes were shown in 1986 and 1988.) But the 260 pieces showcased here
come from the Bakhrushin State Central Theatrical Museum in Moscow, a
bittersweet irony that viewers will only half savor.;   The museum is itself a
metaphor of the course of Soviet art over 7 1/2 decades of Soviet politics.
Established in 1894 by Alexei Bakhrushin, an avid collector of theatrical
memorabilia, it became a government institution in 1913 and a Soviet one in
1919, when Lenin renamed the museum for its founder.;   But by 1924, the witch
hunt that followed Lenin's death found Bakhrushin, who had indulged his hobby
with money inherited from his merchant family. A workers' commission called
him "a class enemy of the worst kind," and the collection was apportioned out
to other museums.;   Despite the popular success of Bakhrushin's landmark 1927
exhibit "Theaters of the October Decade," which partly rehabilitated him, the
collection was reassembled only with great difficulty. Over succeeding
decades, while the art it contained was out of official favor, it has kept
very quiet about its holdings, though the museum is officially a central
repository and archive for all the republics of the USSR.;   "They could sell
but not display" the art, said Baer, who first became aware of the magnitude
of the collection 2 1/2 years ago, when John E. Bowlt, a professor of Russian
studies at the University of Southern California, brought word of its
existence after a sabbatical in the Soviet Union. Cautiously testing the
waters of glasnost, the museum wanted to exchange exhibits with a Western
institution, and it was especially interested in the Fine Arts Museums because
of Baer's 1986 show of Nijinska memorabilia and designs.;   Baer said a
disastrous fire in the late '40s wiped out part of the collection. But it also
showed the staff's faithfulness to the museum's mission, for many of the
pieces were literally snatched from the flames. A drop-curtain rendering by
Alexandra Exter for a 1921 production of "Romeo and Juliet" at the Kamerny
(chamber) Theater has been mounted for the show with its burned edges proudly
untrimmed.;   THE show includes costume and set renderings (and 12 tabletop
scale models) by 39 artists: some as well known as Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir
Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko, the prime movers of Suprematism; some, like
Exter, known primarily to dance historians; but most erased from the
collective memory by the shifting winds of politics.;   And there are some
surprises, such as Sergei Eisenstein, the great Soviet film director who
invented the art of montage -- itself a technique he learned from his studies
in Kabuki theater. He got his start as a designer and director at the
Proletkult (Theater of the People) in Moscow, where his first major production
-- a 1920 adaptation of Evgenii Zamiatin's "We," a dystopian novel that
inspired both George Orwell's "1984" and Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" --
was banned.;   As Russia fought its way into the 20th century through repeated
uprisings and reform movements, its theater, as one might expect, followed
suit. In the first seasons of the Moscow Art Theater, naturalism ruled:
Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard," a sweet farewell to the old order, strove with
the bitter verismo of Gorky's "The Lower Depths.";   Soon enough, as
governments fell and the censors changed sides, the theater pieces became
strident, exuberant, sardonic: Vladimir Mayakovsky's "Mystery-Bouffe" (1918),
a parody of a medieval mystery play; "Victory Over the Sun," in which the
Strongmen of the Futurity capture and subjugate the sun; "Good News for
Horses" (1922), a revue that began as a maudlin ode to a fallen equine
comrade, then turned into a series of fast-paced, jazzy cabaret acts. Gogol's
"The Inspector-General," a savage 1836 satire, was not only a favorite
candidate for revival but the inspiration for such Gogolesque take-offs as
Mayakovsky's "The Bedbug" (1929).;   Pollination of styles;   But where the
progression of themes, from naturalism to caricature, was straightforward and
bold, the mutation of style was more complex.;   Until the start of World War
I, artists traveled freely between Russia and Paris, the center of avant-garde
art. Cubism, which broke down the image into its planes and solids, and
especially the machine-worship of Italian Futurism entered the Russian
artistic bloodstream and traveled like a virus through the system.;   Exter,
for instance, rendered the costume designs for "Famira Kifared," a 1916
classical erotic tragedy, in rich swirls and cones of brooding expressionistic
color. By 1917, for the Kamerny Theater's "Salome," the geometric drapery
shows she had reworked the canons of cubism into something uniquely her own.
For "Romeo and Juliet" (1921), she reverted guiltlessly to expressionism. When
she returned to Paris and London after the war, she was far ahead of her time
in the flat, bright, cut-out geometry of her designs for the late
collaborations with choreographer Bronislava Nijinska.;   Tatlin, to cite
another, looks positively Ibsenesque in his Sturm und Drang set design for
Richard Wagner's opera "The Flying Dutchman." (Because it was never produced,
we will never know whether its crow's-nest and spars were to be real elements
of a three-dimensional, multi-level set, or a painted fantasy.) But he, too,
heard the siren song of the Futurists, and his designs for his performance-art
piece, "Zangezi" (1923), are flat, funny cartoons.;   And Rodchenko's costumes
for Eisenstein's doomed production of "We" (1920) are no more than block
prints, hardly legible to the cutters and stitchers in a costume shop. It's as
if, knowing they would never be constructed, he felt free to play with
abstraction.;   In set design, the Russians far outpaced their European
contemporaries. Until the stage experiments of Vsevolod Meyerhold and
Eisenstein and Vladimir Tairov's Kamerny Theater, theater was performed
against painted drops, literally as well as aesthetically dusty.;   The young
Soviet designers exploded tradition with glorious geometric fantasies
(Alexander Khostenko-Khostov for "Mystery-Bouffe"), fairy-tale frontispieces
(Exter's curtain and portal for the Kamerny Theater) and busy folk art
paintings in what Baer calls "molecular" style, so colorful and complicated
that actors must have disappeared right into them (Rebekka Leviton's mural for
a 1927 revival of "The Inspector-General" in Leningrad).;   The idea of a
constructed, three-dimensional set was born in the new Soviet Union's
theaters. Some of the more idealistic designs probably could never have been
built; but Tatiana Bruni's elaborate, funhouse factory for Dmitri
Shostakovich's worker's ballet, "Bolt" (1931), was produced to great acclaim,
as was Liubov Popova's stark fantasy machine of interlocked wheels for "The
Magnanimous Cuckold" (1922).;   Exter may have been the first designer to rake
the stage, and she did it for purely democratic reasons: so those sitting at
the back of the house could see. And Eisenstein was among the first to play
with environmental art, issuing gas masks to his audience and walking them
around a chemical factory that made poison gas for the scenes of "Gasworks."; 
 The dizzy sense of freedom, the idea that anything was possible, came
directly from Russia's bumpy, even dangerous political climate. Even as the
Communist Party centralized its power and the doors of progress were brutally
slammed in the faces of the Russian people, artists looked through them for
tantalizing glimpses of the future.;   Imagining the unimaginable;   As
Stalin, Zinoviev and Trotsky snarled over the bones of Lenin, the yeasty
experiments of Nikolai Foregger's MASTFOR workshop were just beginning. As
Stalin consolidated his gains and the purges began, the artists of the new
Russia continued to imagine the unimaginable long after common sense should
have told them it was time to stop. Some died not knowing the tide of history
had turned against them; others became worker ants in the new Soviet
bureaucracy.;   Saddest of all may have been what happened to Shostakovich,
whose beautiful Symphony No. 5, written after an official censure by the Union
of Soviet Composers, is defiled by the crow-eating subtitle: "A Soviet
artist's practical, creative response to just criticism." Or to Kasian
Goleizovsky, the mentor of George Balanchine, who made jazz ballets in the
'20s, saw the handwriting on the wall and in 1931 produced "One-Sixth of the
World," a rah-rah revue about the death of capitalism. If Balanchine had not
fled Russia with the Ballets Russes, he might have ended up like Goleizovsky
or the even-more-forgotten Mikhail Dyskovsky: making politically correct
propaganda like "The Red Poppy," an uplifting ballet about life on a
collective farm.;   But for a few heady years in the new Russia, nothing was
impossible.;   The art in this exhibit ranges from the very practical to the
joyously impractical. Some artists didn't know the difference; others knew and
didn't care. Their pieces are, in a real sense, limitless. They looked toward
the horizon and saw the sun rise. For them, the future was then. (box);
