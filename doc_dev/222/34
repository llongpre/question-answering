FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: The Sitwells' influence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chief aim of the three Sitwell siblings - Edith, Sacheverell and Osbert
 -was, according to Aldous Huxley, 'to REBEL'. But, he added, 'though a
charming idea, the steps which they are prepared to take are so small as to
be hardly perceptible.' The National Portrait Gallery's new exhibition and
accompanying catalogue (Pounds 14.95 pbk, Pounds 19.95 hbk, 240 pages)
chronicles in paintings, photographs, music, literature and letters the
Sitwell's influence in the arts of the early 20th century and leaves us
lamenting the decline of the Great English Eccentric.
