   Old Etonians thronged ``ye distant spires,
ye antique towers, that crown the wat'ry glade,'' and Queen
Elizabeth II came for lunch Tuesday to mark the 550th anniversary
of Eton College.
   The queen praised the school as ``second to none,'' though she
sent her three sons to Gordonstoun in Scotland. She told students
she had asked the headmaster to give them an extra holiday each
October.
   Why October? Because the actual 550th anniversary of the
foundation of Eton College by King Henry VI falls on Oct. 11.
   Eton celebrated Tuesday, a school official explained, because it
was the day before the annual June 4 holiday in honor of King
George III _ which Eton chose to celebrate on May 30.
   Eton's calendar, like its modes of speech and dress, is all its
own.
   The school long ago disposed of top hats, flogging, and the
humiliating ``bum freezer'' jackets for its shortest boys, but it
remains its own world.
   Masters are still ``beaks,'' classes are ``divs,'' rowers are
``wet bobs,'' cricketers are ``dry bobs'' and students are either
``tugs'' (King's Scholars) or ``oppidans'' (fee-paying students).
Students wear long-tailed black coats, white ties and stiff collars
in class.
   The myth of Eton is that the school, nestled in the shadow of
Windsor Castle, inculcates superiority of mind, grace and social
status.
   ``The thing Eton majors in is arrogance _ so deep-rooted it is
totally unselfconscious. It's ugly and unappealing, and I've spent
the past 30 years trying to unlearn it,'' said Mark Fisher, a Labor
Party lawmaker.
   Lord Longford says he once was interrogated by King George VI
about why he, an old Etonian, became a socialist. It came down to
``the conviction that we are all equal in the sight of God,''
Longford said. ``Well, I think Eton stands for something far
removed from that.''
   Fisher and Longford were among 50 ``old boys'' interviewed by
Danny Danziger for his recently published book, ``Eton Voices.''
   George Orwell, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Henry Fielding, Aldous
Huxley, the economist John Maynard Keynes and the poet Thomas Gray,
who wrote about ``ye distant spires,'' all attended Eton. So did a
score of prime ministers and three members of the current Cabinet.
   The Old Etonian Association had hoped to lure 8,000 old boys for
the festivities, including fireworks and a ``supper box'' priced at
about $105 but sold half that many tickets.
   John Butterwick, chairman of the Old Etonians, blamed an out of
date mailing list, and a computer that couldn't deal with titles or
the strings of honors behind some former students' names.
   Derek Malcolm, film critic of The Guardian newspaper, left Eton
feeling equal to any occasion. ``I mean, there's no higher you can
go socially,'' he told Danziger.
   Pish and tosh, says Philip Howard, literary editor of The Times
of London. ``You should see some of the diffident, insecure ...
boring Etonians I meet, if I don't see them coming first,'' he
wrote in the newspaper.
   ``I do get irritated by people who think that because we look
traditional and old-fashioned, the Establishment is hidebound and
backward-looking,'' the headmaster, Eric Anderson, told the Daily
Express.
   ``Underneath all that, it's a very modern school.''
   Nine out of 10 Etonians go on to universities, a quarter to
Oxford or Cambridge. The school has two dozen science labs, a
``beak'' for every 9.5 students and even a golf course among the
famous playing fields where, as it's said, the Battle of Waterloo
was won.
   The school has at least three applicants for each of its 1,260
places, and parents pay $14,450 a year for an education, plus those
incomparable intangibles.
   ``Being known as an Etonian is a handicap, because of false
expectations of snobbery and wealth it arouses,'' wrote Howard, who
said one of his old school companions wound up managing a bus
station.
