<LEADPARA>  THE literary output of one of this century's most prolific authors will be
increased even more by the decision of the Enoch Pratt Free Library, the
financial and literary executor of the H.L. Mencken estate, to publish a
collection of the Baltimore writer's recently unsealed papers.;    Ashbel
Green, a senior editor at Alfred A. Knopf, said the publishing house expects
to choose an editor in a few weeks for the four-volume collection of papers,
titled "My Life as Author and Editor." That selection is expected to be
announced Sept. 14, during Mencken Day observances at the Enoch Pratt library,
according to library spokeswoman Averil Kadis.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I see 'My Life' as a very worthwhile, publishable book," Green said. "My
guess is that we'll publish sometime in 1993.";    "My Life as Author and
Editor" and a three-volume memoir, "Thirty-Five Years of Newspaper Work," were
unsealed at the Pratt Jan. 29 -- 35 years after the writer's death -- as he
had instructed in a memorandum to the library. They are thought to be the last
unpublished papers by "the Sage of Baltimore" and thus could have particular
literary importance, considering Mencken's status as probably the pre-eminent
American literary critic and editor in the first three decades of the 20th
century.;    Mencken himself thought so. "I knew so many American and English
authors during the 1914-1930 period that my account of them should be of
interest and use to future historians of the national literature," he wrote in
an April 1946 entry in "The Diary of H.L. Mencken," published by Knopf in
1989.;    As co-editor of the influential magazine Smart Set from 1914-1923,
he published such authors as Aldous Huxley, Somerset Maugham, James Joyce,
Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson, Willa Cather and F. Scott Fitzgerald. As
a critic, Mencken championed such authors as Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis when
it was not popular to do so.;    Green said that of the four crates of papers
that compose "My Life," "two represented his text and two were appendices." He
added: "The body as a whole runs over 2,000 pages. A lot of appendix material
is not of particular interest.";    He said the time frame "ends sometime in
the 1920s." As for the contents, not surprisingly, "There's some very pungent
commentary.";    Only a handful of people have seen the papers. They were read
by a four-person committee at the Pratt before it voted to offer the papers to
Knopf, and only a few scholars will be permitted to view them at the library
before their publication, Kadis said.;    No publisher has been found for
"Thirty-Five Years of Newspaper Work," which covers much of Mencken's career
as writer and editor with the Baltimore Sun and Baltimore Evening Sun. Green
said those papers were not offered by the library to Knopf.  </TEXT>
