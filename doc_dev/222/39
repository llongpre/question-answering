Last week's Assignment reported on malaria in countries such as Cambodia and
Thailand, and showed that the disease was killing 20 times as many as Aids,
yet receiving much less research money. This week's programme quotes what it
calls 'Asia's leading Aids prevention campaigner' saying that Aids is
'Asia's largest non-military security threat'. It seems that Aids spreads
through Thai brothels and 95 per cent of Thai men are said to use the
brothels (7.45 BBC2). We progressed from de Quincey to Aldous Huxley in last
week's survey of artists and drugs in Without Walls. Today (9.00 C4) we move
on to the 1960s and such characters as Ken Kesey, Timothy Leary and JG
Ballard. 40 Minutes finds nine young men from north-east England packed into
a Benidorm flat intended for four. 'Loud, aggressive, abusive, they drink
too much and leer at the topless girls', we are told. 'It looks like an orgy
of loutish behaviour but, for them, the excesses are an escape from the
drabness of life in everyday Britain'. Surprising really that they are not
all mass murderers given the unique horror of the drabness (9.50 BBC2).
