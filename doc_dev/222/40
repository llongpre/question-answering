FAMOUS for Fifteen Minutes, that began on Radio 4 on Thursday, is typical of
Radio 4, where folk of transient fame are constantly held up for us to
wonder at. The point in this series is that the fame has worn out. Mark
Lester, the first exhibit, was the universally-loved Oliver in the film of
Oliver] in 1968, when he was eight. In an interview with Jenni Mills, he
told how he went on in films for ten years more, until the offers ended. He
spent his unexpected money, he says 'irrationally', has since done various
jobs, is now a trainee osteopath. Next week Jenni Mills talks to Diana
Gould, a PE teacher who once flummoxed Mrs Thatcher on a TV programme.
It is like clearing the wardrobe of old coats you thought so smart before
they wore out. And there are other coats on other hangers. On Sunday we had
Jack's Last Tape, an autobiographical tape made casually in his last days by
Jack Trevor Story, the successful hack writer - nothing much that he had not
told us already, it just had that Story label in it. In Thursday's Radio
Lives there was the player Jimmy Clitheroe whose 15 minutes are over. Radio
2's Star Quality coat on Tuesday, formerly worn by Evelyn Laye, was kept
happily wearable by the electronic mothballs that preserved its charm as
new.
Soundtrack (Radio 4, Thursday) dealt with fine people who will never make
any 15 minutes. The Bill for Service dealt quietly with the effect on the
police of the stressful events they meet on duty - a prisoner hanged in his
cell, the Lockerbie disaster, the Clapham rail crash and so on. There was a
plea for some kind of psychiatric debriefing. I thought the arguments
important and the police reactions admirable.
Not all drama comes from the BBC. On Sunday, Clyde 2 in Glasgow gave A Case
of Legionary's Disease, by Ewart Hutton, a police tale with a plot as
complex as a tartan. Gordon, a known crook, is given a new identity by the
police, so that he can lead them to the Miami Mafia folk who have Dollars
100,000 for him to launder. They also lend him Morag, a woman police escort.
In a quiet country place, they see a skull, said to be a Roman legionary's,
with a little hole in it and a used pistol round inside. Why was the skull
not smashed when this was fired into it? Because the skull's owner had been
no Roman, a former German, now Scots, explains. He was the pilot of a German
bomber that crashed near-by; he had baled out but been shot. The Miami Mafia
get an occasional look while the skull problem is examined, and then they
are shopped by Morag, by now pretty fond of Gordon. She was nicely played by
Louise Beattie, Gordon by John Bett, and Finlay Welsh directed. Good fun.
LBC's Images for the End of the Century (Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, 10
minutes each), by Damien Chalaud, was different. In a suite of recorded
chat, documentary extracts and archival recordings, it tries to map the 20th
century. But the instant images were not sharp enough; all we had was a
pincushion of events that did not relate to one another.
Curiously, what I have enjoyed most in Radio 3's 20s season is the Hindemith
Composer of the Week. It is not for me to analyse it, but I find much of it
lively and as individual in its way as Mozart - good material for Classic
FM. The Aldous Huxley stories I heard were good magazine stories, no more.
Of course there were good magazines then, where informed stories about the
arts might be expected. On Saturday, Richard Mayne's Dancing on a Tightrope,
an account of Cocteau, spread widely over the 1920s, taking in Stravinsky,
Les Six, Picasso, even Genet. He may have been considered as much a showman
as an artist in his day; but the plays and films remain as much part of our
time as of his.
