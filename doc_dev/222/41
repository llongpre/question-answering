FOR SUCH a fashionable lady 75 is quite an age to admit to. But yes, it is
true, Vogue really is 75 years old this year. The first British issue was
published during the First World War, on September 15 1916. Most of the
editorial matter was supplied from New York, although there were some sops
to local British interests. It sold for just a shilling. Wartime
restrictions meant that it carried no advertisements.
Times may be hard now in glossy magazine advertising circles but even so the
current issue sells for Pounds 2.50 and there are at least 89 pages of
glossy advertisements keeping apart the 204 pages of editorial. At the
height of the boom times, in October 1988, the fattest issue of all carried
333 pages of advertisement and 170 of editorial. If Conde Nast himself could
have lived to see it]
For a magazine which sells just 172,387 copies it has always had an
influence that goes way beyond size. As Peter York, that subtle interpreter
of current trends and attitudes puts it: 'It's a big little circulation. It
is the biggest, most glamorous, full-tilt, paid for, glossy there is. It has
a huge pass-on readership and is read by far more people than those who pay
for it. It doesn't appeal to a single class more it unites an attitude
group, people who think clothes and fashion are important.'
Vogue was always intended to be a very classy number. Conde Nast, who
founded one of the world's most famous magazine empires, never started a
magazine himself. He bought them all, from Vanity Fair and House and Garden
through to his flagship Vogue. 'Class not mass' was the company motto and
the culture has hardly changed. Circulation was never of prime importance
but Conde Nast is not in the business of running loss-making operations for
the sake of prestige. Daniel Salem, chairman of Conde Nast Publications,
makes it very clear that 'Vogue is the flagship not just in terms of
prestige but also in terms of profit.'
Nobody is talking precise figures because nobody has to. One Vogue strength
is that Conde Nast is answerable to nobody but itself - Si Newhouse, his
brother Donald and other family members own Advance Publications, the parent
company. There are no outside shareholders, nobody whose opinions they are
obliged to listen to. If the Newhouses want to do something, it is done.
According to a recent Time magazine article, the Advance empire is one of
the largest family fortunes in the US, probably worth Dollars 11bn.
Si Newhouse's father was the man who bought the Conde Nast empire back in
1963 after Conde Nast himself had suffered a series of complicated financial
reversals.
Rather like the man who liked the razor and so bought the company, rumour
has it that in 1959 Si Newhouse's wife Mitzi asked him to go out and buy her
Vogue. Some Dollars 5m poorer he came back with Conde Nast.
Vogue has always generated a mythology of its own. To those whose
journalistic lives were spent outside its glossy environs it always seemed
an infinitely frothy place. It always seemed a centre of happenings, of much
weeping as fearsome editors conducted their reigns of terror, of top editors
hired for mouth-watering sums and, above all, as home of the mysterious
breed universally known as Voguettes. These were the numerous junior
assistants or reporters who followed in the wake of their high priestesses,
the section editors. They were rumoured to be paid a pittance but always had
a way of making everybody else's designer clothes look like last year's
rejects.
Georgina Howell, in her book Sultans of Style, describes how she won Vogue's
annual talent contest and was initiated into the Voguette's code. She was
given 'a small red paper-bound book entitled So You Have Joined Conde Nast.
It told her to 'wear a plain dark costume to the office, not to wear
jewellery other than a string of pearls, and to have a hat and gloves for
the journey to and from the office.' It warned her on no account to discuss
her salary. This, remember, was in the early 1960s when Biba, Mary Quant et
al were just about to burst upon the scene.
Her reward for winning the talent contest was to water the plants and take
messages for Peter Coats, the distinguished garden editor. 'Tell Peter,'
commanded the Duchess of Westminster, 'that I must have my feather boa back
by Saturday.'
But even Vogue has to change. Once upon a time, so legend had it, Vogue had
only to decree that it was a beige and cream year and every shop in town did
its windows in beige and cream and lo and behold the people did wear beige
and cream. These days it does not try to dictate. It edits, refines and
presents a variety of the best options. Or, as Daniel Salem would put it,
'it sets a mood.'
It changes, as all things must, to survive. It has always been primarily a
visual magazine but Vogue and Conde Nast have always nurtured and supported
a range of talented people.
Looking back over the years the list of contributors is impressive. It
ranges from famous photographers such as Cecil Beaton, Bailey, and Snowdon,
writers like Gertrude Stein, Aldous Huxley, DH Lawrence and Colette, and
food stars such as Boulestin, Robert Carrier and Elizabeth David.
Designers like Mary Quant, Ossie Clark, Foale and Tuffin, Zandra Rhodes were
all given spreads and exposure. Most of went on to become household names
but they were unknowns when Vogue spotted them.
There have been times, though, when the opposition has given Vogue quite a
run for its money. Queen under Jocelyn Stevens in the 1960s gave it quite a
fright. The Face and Arena gave it pause for thought and it is no accident
that Conde Nast now owns 40 per cent of them. 'Buying into those magazines
magazines gives us a foothold in the future and access to a hothouse of
talent,' says Daniel Salem.
'There is no doubt that times now are tough - I personally have never known
them so bad in 35 years in publishing but we have the resources to see them
out. Sometimes it is much more interesting to improve the bottom-line than
turnover. The key, above all, is to be number one in your field. There can,
after all, be only one bible.' There Vogue seems secure.
