THE 1960s, it seems, are always with us, at once so ambiguous and so
positive, so hopeful and so meretricious, so stylish and so vulgar. How we
believed then, in that false dawn, when we would throw off the shackles of
the stuffy, academic past, reform the art schools and so move forward into
that brave new world.
Up to a point we did, forgetting that it was precisely that old formal
academic grounding, with its emphasis on observation, understanding and
technique, that allowed us the luxury of our precocious posturings. If last
autumn's Pop Art Show at the Royal Academy taught us anything, it was that
the British variety was so much the better made than the American, richer
and more complex in its references and associations, for all the superficial
gloss.
For Ready Steady Go at the Royal Festival Hall (until February 23, then on
an extensive tour well into 1993), the South Bank Centre draws upon the Arts
Council's own collection of work of the 1960s, bought at the time, cheap and
cheerful. The title may naturally evoke the generality of Pop, but it does
so with a gentle, perhaps unconscious irony. What it offers is another look
at those supposed Pop artists in company with those of their contemporaries
similarly engaged with the currency of American art, albeit the nouvelle
vague of hard-edge and post-painterly abstraction.
There on the one hand are Blake, Hockney, Kiff, Hodgkin, Caulfield, on the
other Hoyland, Huxley, Ayres, Riley, Moon, Denny, Irwin and Sedgely; and
somewhere in between come Tilson and Smith. What comes through is a sense of
a well-mannered and thoughtful engagement, responsive to what was going on
in the world but still its own creature, an authentic national school,
distinct in its sensibility from any other, and certainly no worse. As such
it was the staple of our official representation in major shows and
festivals at home and abroad throughout the period.
But it was never the whole story, and the absence here of such artists as
Auerbach, Freud and Kossoff, to say nothing of that far larger group of
older figurative artists centred upon the Academy, the Royal College and the
Slade - Weight, de Grey, Coker, Middleditch, Symons, George, Buhler,
Greenham, Coldstream, Gowing and the rest - is conspicuous. Perhaps other
shows are mooted to put the record straight, but serious questions remain
about the nature of our public patronage, that at every period would seem to
celebrate quite arbitrarily work of a certain kind above all others, a
matter not of merit at all, though that may be high enough, but of pure
luck.
Figurative painters were by no means the only ones to suffer, then or later.
A positive response to American abstract expressionism in the late 1950s was
all very well, but the fashion soon changed. The awkward fact is that some
of our very best painters suffered long neglect in consequence. The Pomeroy
Purdy Gallery (at Jacob Street Film Studios, Mill Street SE1, until February
22) is showing the work of four of them, dating not from the 1960s but from
the years either side of 1980.
Two are in Ready Steady Go, but then John Hoyland had yet to evolve from the
colour-field towards actual expressionism, and Gillian Ayres was to be all
but ignored for the next 15 years. Here her paintings are at their most
mysterious and atmospheric, the surfaces dense and impacted, the colour rich
and deep, the spaces unspecific. They are neither better nor worse than her
more recent work, that is more open, graphic, more particular in its
suggestion of landscape: only different, and very beautiful.
Basil Beattie, who has lately emerged as among our most authoritative
painters, seemed then to be painting the paintings one might almost hope
Hoyland would paint now, for being freer in the gesture, less dry and flat
in the paint itself, and more open in imagery and surface. Here Hoyland's
prints are so much the more confident, integrated and expansive in the
handling.
And there is Brian Fielding, who died in 1987. He showed seldom, and so
slipped through the net, but to his peers and students he was a constant
standard and abiding influence and example. His paintings here are in the
true character of his work, the sensibility at once oriental and occidental,
the surfaces flat yet deep, the statement painterly yet calligraphic. He
held such contradictions in perfect balance, with deceptive ease and true
conviction.
