THE MODERN BRITISH NOVEL by Malcolm Bradbury Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 20, 512
pages
AS I read this survey of the British novel over the past 100 years, I have a
picture before me from the silent movie screen. Our hero, played by Buster
Keaton, running for all he is worth in the middle of the railroad track, is
in hot pursuit of a moving train; just as he seems to be reaching it, the
train accelerates and pulls away from him. Clamping his hat firmly on his
head, he makes a superhuman effort and struggles on top just before the
train reaches the tunnel. He emerges clinging to the outside of the last
carriage covered in grime and soot.
No ingratitude is intended for a book from which I have benefited
enormously, and that has already acquired an honoured place on my reference
shelves, but there seems something similarly farcical and heroic in
Bradbury's attempt to discuss, or at least mention, every novel of some
significance by a British novelist published since the 1870s. Bradbury has
peppered his pages with an overwhelming plethora of names. At the conclusion
he appends a further List of Major Works from 1876 to the present that, he
says, 'reaches well beyond the authors it has been possible to cover in the
text but, though full, remains personal and selective.'
An idea of the extent of ground covered may be seen from two successive
entries in this list:
'DOYLE, ARTHUR CONAN (1859-1930). A Study in Scarlet (1887), The Sign of
Four (1890), The White Company (1891), The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
(1892), The Memoirs of Sherlock Homes (1894), The Return of Sherlock
Holmes(1905) DOYLE, RODDY (1958- ) The Commitments (1988), The Snapper
(1990), Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha (1993).'
Roddy Doyle is one of six favoured novelists on another list - the short
list of this year's Booker Prize for fiction to be awarded next Tuesday and
Doyle's novel on that list is the last one mentioned above by Bradbury. It
consists of an Irish schoolboy's random thoughts at a time when his parent's
marriage is breaking up. If it wins it will be very good going on Bradbury's
part to have got it in.
After Joyce and Beckett whom he deals with at length, Bradbury is
surprisingly weak on the Irish contribution. It is where the master-word
'British' in his title poses problems. He glances only summarily at major
writers like Brian Moore and William Trevor, and as for more recent ones he
is content with a quick round-up in his final chapter, '1979 to the
Present':
'Ireland (he writes) had of course long been a major centre of important
fiction in the English language, to the point where its tradition now seemed
distinct and independent. Still, a significant part of the best fiction read
in Britain came from there. To the work of well-established notables . . .
were now added the novels of John Banville . . . John McGahern . . . Claire
Boylan . . . Deirdre Madden . . . Neil Jordan . . . Patrick McCabe . . .'
It is not by such scrambles against the time-control that the book must be
judged but by the earlier chapters where the story is told of the novel's
fluctuating fortunes from the days of Hardy, George Moore, Kipling through
the two world wars and the decades that followed. These chapters are
exemplary, models of clarity and compression. Not only does Bradbury deal
with the various clusters of novelists who give a period its distinctive
tone, he sees well beyond them to the historical events, the main influences
from abroad and the critical theory to which they reacted.
Bradbury starts his survey in 1878 because it was around then that the
Modern (in the opposite sense to Victorian) novel began to emerge; it was
then that Henry James, recently settled in London, went to what he thought
was tea with George Eliot whom he revered. No tea was served and as James
was leaving her lover GH Lewes handed him a couple of books. They were the
two volumes of his The Europeans that had been sent on in advance of the
visit.
In that put-down of the emerging Modern by the declining Victorian, Bradbury
finds an emblem of the great fictional take-over. In The Portrait of a Lady
published two years later James canonised his debt to Eliot in the use he
made of the feminine consciousness in his novel. From then on Bradbury's
survey is sign-posted by words like modernism, realism, surrealism,
post-modernism, post-post-modernism, utopianism, and dystopianism (a word
that crops up more and more as the century progresses and describes a novel
like Orwell's 1984). The familiar names - Ford Madox Ford (whose complex
novels are excellently expounded), Forster, Lawrence, Woolf, Dorothy
Richardson, Evelyn Waugh (still underrated, Bradbury thinks), Huxley, Green,
Greene, Isherwood, Koestler, Angus Wilson, Iris Murdoch, Anthony Burgess,
remain in their predictable places in an intricate chronological tapestry.
As an example of the amount of critical punch Bradbury can pack into a
couple of sentences take this comment on the world of Ivy Compton-Burnett:
'The time is that less of late-Victorian life than the late-Victorian novel,
which Compton-Burnett does not reject but subverts, preserving it in an
eternal stasis, for repeated decoding. This is the eternal world of Samuel
Butler's The Way of All Flesh and Edmund Gosse's Father and Son, and
Butler's deep irony and Gosse's sense of patriarchal crisis are both
essential elements of her method.'
An old stager like CP Snow gets his due as a traditional realist and there
are comparisons between him and his 'saga novel' - the Strangers and
Brothers sequence - and others who have written novels on the instalment
plan, Henry Williamson, Anthony Powell, Doris Lessing in her Martha Quest
sequence. In further comments on Lessing Bradbury underlines the importance
of The Golden Notebook.
As the train moves closer to the present we become curious to see who is on
board and who is not. Muriel Spark and Margaret Drabble are both comfortably
esconced in a first-class compartment and so are AS Byatt and Angela Carter,
the latter with an amazing amount of luggage. John Fowles gets in at the
West Country, and we find the two Amises, pere et fils in the restaurant car
with Peter Ackroyd.
The fils whom Bradbury rates as highly as the pere and whose style derived
from Saul Bellow he discusses, is described as 'a pained post-modern
ironist'. Salman Rushdie has a carriage to himself; good to see his work
assessed on its true artistic merits for a change. John Le Carre, JG
Ballard, Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes, Graham Swift, Iain Banks, are
all aboard, and so are Beryl Bainbridge, Elaine Feinstein, Alice Thomas
Ellis (but not AE Ellis), Penelope Fitzgerald, A L Barker, Bernice Rubens,
Emma Tennant, Rose Tremain . . . but I could go on for ever. The reliable
old locomotive called the novel continues to pull this lot steadily along
and shows no sign even now of running out steam.
