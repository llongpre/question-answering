Imagine Art-World Man: surely a dyed-in-the-wool aesthete? Scrutinising a
Donatello bas-relief he is surely a veritable work of art in himself.
Perhaps he wears a three-piece suit in dove-grey, shot with lilac? It is cut
from a vicuna-mink super 120 cloth and its high waist is undoubtedly styled
a little too emphatically. His lavender silk shirt, buttoned in blonde
tortoise shell, is fastened at its promiscuous cuffs by links set with
Mesopotamian curios. His delicate, mauve-gloved fingers probably lean on a
cane carved from a narwhal tusk topped with a hand-painted glass eye.
Dream on] Sadly, the average Art-World Man cuts an unmemorable figure. In
spite of being surrounded by a richness of aesthetic stimuli, he tends to
subscribe to one of two visually bland dress codes: the formulaic
conservatism associated with lawyers and civil servants or the
thigh-slapping 'wit' of bond dealers and TV personalities who guffaw over
loud ties and conversation-piece cufflinks from Tiffany and Cartier.
Fausto Calderai, an art consultant in his late 30s, steers between the two.
His Anglepoise lamp figure is clad in matt wool and reminds me of the
centenary-celebrating images we have recently seen of Aldous Huxley's
beautiful attire. Calderai's sartorial efforts are widely acknowledged -
last year he was selected as one of the 'exhibits' in the self-laudatory
exhibition organised by the Italian fashion body Pitti Immagine, entitled
'One Hundred Years of Italian Male Elegance'.
Calderai's style communicates sobriety but not temperance. His slender,
dry-wool suits are easy on the eye and apparently unremarkable until closer
inspection yields pleasing details. The fine electric-orange thread lighting
up the grey cloth of his suit, like a kinetic flicker dancing across a flat
grisaille, and the shaved tufts protruding from his plain white cotton
shirts, are virtually undetectable as he strides by along Bond Street.
You will not catch him wearing a 'daring' Jeremy Paxman tie, or a 'novelty'
waistcoat. 'They don't work,' he says emphatically. 'They highlight a part
of your body when the whole figure should be a melange which is harmonious
to the eye. And if you're tall (more than 6ft 6in) they look ridiculous.'
His other pet hate is baggy clothes, on men or women.
Calderai runs a Florence-based art consultancy which offers independent
valuations. He advises, rather than trades and enhances his scholarly
reputation by occasionally writing articles and books on furniture made by
architects and artists.
His dress is extremely measured, for he regards it as an eloquent
communicator to his potential clients. He strives to project a balance
between discretion and aesthetics.
'The typical client wants a valuation on house contents which will be split
between the heirs, for in Italy we don't have primogeniture. As most of my
clients are afraid of academics and wary of dealers, they will turn to
consultants.'
Compromise between elegance and practicality is his goal. Passing many hours
in private homes, rather than public places, he must melt into the setting
and take part in their social occasions.
One moment he will be crawling on his hands and knees across a parquet floor
to inspect the underbelly of a table, the next scaling a step ladder to
reach a painting hung high up under the ceiling of a quattrocento palazzo.
Roomy pockets are essential for a lens, a measuring tape and a notebook. Dry
wools from English mills serve him well as they do not look shiny or creased
after a few climbing or crawling sessions, and he prefers their dated mood.
He loathes the faddish taste for cashmere - coats, jerseys, socks - which he
thinks are both impractical and expensive.
He keeps his luggage modest, for 'it would be considered far too vain to
turn up at a house with too many suitcases'.
Unlike British professional clothing, in Italy it is incorrect and
overdressed to wear a dark suit and black shoes in the morning, so Calderai
wears dry brown or grey suits, with a matching, high-buttoned waistcoat and
brown shoes for the day, and the same suit, with a low-cut waistcoat and
black shoes for dinner.
Most of Calderai's suits are made to measure by Di Preta whom he considers
superior to the better-known Italian tailor Caraceni because he prefers his
suits cut relatively close to the body and 'unstructured so they follow you
easily. I don't like very structured suits with big shoulders - like' . . .
sniff, sniff . . . 'those body guards you see in Los Angeles.'
He despises the florid and attention-seeking style of many, typically
Italian, art dealers. 'They look like shop window dummies aping London or
New York gents,' he says. He allows himself two areas of 'fantasy' - coat
linings and cufflinks.
Calderai's cufflinks are by and large costume jewellery rather than family
heirlooms: characters from Disney, lewd parts of the anatomy by Vivienne
Westwood, kitsch from the 1950s. Pride of place goes to a series of silicon
cufflinks made by the Spanish artist Joaquin Blanco in the shape of insects.
The delicate turn of his ankle is caressed by knee-high socks so fine that
you can almost count the freckles up his instep.
Calderai is also opinionated about women's wear. Emphatically out is the
modern taste for all-black: 'It can't be beautiful if 99 per cent of women
look the same. It's a kind of security and they all end up looking like shop
assistants which is rather sad.'
Other hates are big furs, though he is not an animal rights supporter, flat
shoes - 'so sad and unfeminine, don't you think?' - and the fad for going
about stocking-less in the city because 'I just think that a woman without
stockings doesn't care and looks dirty'.
His biggest criticism of Italian women is their taste for too much gold
jewellery during the day and 'those awful tailored gilt earrings favoured by
so-called smart Americans'. He loves feathers - 'a woman in feathers, wow]'
His advice for a young professional man starting out with a limited budget
is to seek good quality second-hand clothes and to have one or two well-made
classic suits.
'Have very few things. The most difficult lesson when you're young is to
stop buying bits and pieces - you need very few things. Only buy what you
really love and wear it all the time. I still wear the two suits I had made
when I started out - one of them is my favourite.'
There they hang, 18 years later, alongside a dozen others in his dressing
room which is styled like a faux-Regency shrine to external sensibilities.
