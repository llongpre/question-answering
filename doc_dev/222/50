<LEADPARA>  TRY to get Roberto Burle Marx to expound on his Brazilian gardens while
pictures of his most famous works are being hung in New York's Museum of
Modern Art and photographers are asking for one more photograph and assistants
are discussing the effect of towers of bromeliads ("more than 500 but less
than 1,000," said Robert Jungles, a landscape architect who installed the
jungle).;    It's a bit like asking Aldous Huxley to unravel "The Doors of
Perception." Or the caterpillar to explain the mushroom.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     His words, almost maddeningly elliptical, seemed always to be answering
some question that had not been asked. Yet perhaps all were clues to the one
big question: "What is Art?";    "Creating a garden must be a work of art,"
said Burle Marx, who in his 81 years has created nearly 3,000 gardens, from
the Spartan city rooftops of Brasilia to the sprawling old coffee plantations
of the rich.;    "The medium is different . . . but if you cannot think in
such terms, of Shakespeare, of Debussy, of the more important moments in life
. . .";    He stopped, as if the listener had already completed this epic
thought, and then flowed seamlessly on to another: "A plant is an actor in the
garden, but you have many plants acting together . . . as in a painting with a
big surface, but also like a sculpture seen from different sides. In a garden,
you have to have volume. You need to work with time and space.";    Roberto
Burle Marx, who was trained as a painter, has been called the greatest
landscape designer of the 20th century. Ten of his most significant works,
illustrated by plans, models, photographs and a video, are on view through
August at the museum.;    "It's put together with cleverness and abundance of
heart," said Burle Marx, gazing about the room, his shock of wavy white hair
as invincible as the bromeliads.;    "Roberto Burle Marx: The Unnatural Art of
the Garden" was assembled by a guest curator, William Howard Adams. A garden
historian and Jeffersonian scholar, Adams left his own Virginia farm for a
month last year to immerse himself in the artist's work, in Rio's mountains
and clouds, in the exuberant life of the Brazilians.;    "Roberto just takes
you into his life," Adams said. "And his energy . . . he could kill anybody.";
   Burle Marx is the first landscape gardener -- and that is the term he uses
more than "architect" -- whose work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern
Art.;    An odd situation, if one thinks of the ancient gardens of Persia and
China, of Versailles in the 17th century, of England in the 18th, when
Capability Brown "improved" on everything by tearing down walls for lawns.;   
Growing a whole world;    These were artists who used water like music and
placed plants with stone and earth and buildings to form one complete whole.
The minds who made them were trying to understand, and embody, the world in
its entirety. And all were controlling Nature. By definition, there is no such
thing as a natural garden.;    "People ask me influences," said Burle Marx,
who grew up in Rio de Janeiro when its coastline was still more a wild sweep
of mountain and sea than high-rise city. Such shapes get into the bones.;   
"I have influences of what I saw during my whole life," he said. "The
influence of man going to the moon, of what Einstein told people, of
Donatello, of Braque, of Piero della Francesca and Picasso.";    He went on.
"Today we are in contact with everything in the world. Yesterday I was in
Brazil. Today I am in New York. Many gardeners don't understand this. They
think it is not necessary to know about music, painting, literature, social
problems.;    "But everything is together: the man walking on the moon, the
war in the Persian Gulf, the disaster in Bangladesh. And certainly, we express
this agony.";    Why, Adams was asked, don't North American landscape
architects speak of artistic agony?;    "I don't know why," said Adams, whose
history of gardens, "Nature Perfected," will be out this fall. "It's
downplayed in this country. If you can draw, you're told to go to architecture
school, because landscape designers are just gardeners. Just sort of
decorators, you know. I could not name a single landscape architect in the
United States who would call this an art form.";    He gestured toward a stand
of tall elegant pines framing the flat wilderness surrounding an estate
outside Sao Paulo. "Imagine planting those trees when they were five feet high
and envisioning them 90 years later, at their maturity," Adams said. "Unlike
any other art form, a garden is designed for the future, and for future
generations. Most of us today want a garden to look good in 10 minutes because
we're going to move next year.";    Burle Marx revolutionized the gardens of
Brazil when his mother was still tending roses and boxwoods in Rio, when the
New World was still imitating the Old.;    In the late 1920s, Brazilians were
pioneers beating back the jungle. They saw their own exuberant plants -- their
rugged palms and bromeliads, their wild orchids and lily pads, their boat-size
philodendron leaves -- as lowly weeds.;    It wasn't until the 19-year-old
Roberto Burle Marx stood in the Dahlem Botanical Garden in Berlin that he
realized the weeds were treasures.;    Gardens fit for city sizzle;    He
returned to Rio to study painting, architecture and landscape design at the
Escola Nacional de Belas Artes. He rubbed shoulders with Lucio Costa, Oscar
Niemeyer and Le Corbusier, and soon he was designing gardens to complement
their bold lines and forms, and the electric quality of city life.;    Yet his
designs also spoke of sky and mountain and sea. And unlike most landscape
architects, he was a botanist. He apprenticed himself to the botanist Henrique
Lahmeyer de Mello Barreto, head of Rio's zoological garden. He knew plants
intimately: what survived in a dry wind, what needed the shade of the jungle.;
   The two forayed into the Amazonian rain forest, finding plants no one had
yet discovered. Burle Marx became one of its most outspoken defenders. And his
tropical collection at his home south of Rio is one of the largest in the
world.;    So when Roberto Burle Marx put a plant on the hot windy roof of the
Safra Bank in Sao Paulo, it lived.;    "You know you're in a tough urban
setting," said Adams, staring at a picture of the garden's curving patterns of
artificial stone. "You feel it in the material, in the plants: big ferocious
things that look like they could take down the satellite antennae next door."  </TEXT>
