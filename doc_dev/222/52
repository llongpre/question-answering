   Today's highlight in history:
   Fifty years ago, on Nov. 30, 1939, the Russo-Finnish War, also
known as the Winter War, began as Soviet troops invaded Finland.
Although the Finns mounted a spirited defense, they were eventually
overwhelmed by the Red Army and forced to sign a treaty the
following March. (War between the two countries broke out again in
1941, and became a part of the overall global conflict.)

   In 1782, the United States and Britain signed preliminary peace
articles in Paris, ending the Revolutionary War.
   In 1803, Spain completed the process of ceding Louisiana to
France.

when an 8{-pound meteorite crashed through the roof of her house.
   In 1962, U Thant of Burma was elected Secretary-General of the
United Nations, succeeding the late Dag Hammarskjold.
   In 1966, the former British colony of Barbados became
independent.
   In 1967, Julie Nixon and David Eisenhower announced their
engagement.
   In 1981, the United States and the Soviet Union opened
negotiations in Geneva aimed at reducing nuclear weapons in Europe.
   
   Ten years ago: During a pilgrimage in Turkey, Pope John Paul II
participated in an Orthodox Mass honoring the feast day of St.
Andrew, becoming the first pontiff in several centuries to attend.
