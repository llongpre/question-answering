"Unknown Disease Blights Alder Trees"] 
  [Text] Britain's riversides and wetlands are threatened by 
a disease which may be killing the alder trees that grow there. 
Scientists fear the plague may prove as devastating as that 
which wiped out most of England's elm trees 20 years ago and is 
now killing the new elms that sprung from the root systems of 
the old. 
  Fungi is believed to be attacking the alders' roots and 
causing the branches to die back, but experts disagree over the 
seriousness of the disease. The most alarming case is at the 
National Grid Company's environmental education centre near 
Canterbury, Kent, which includes a 20-acre nature reserve built 
around a water filled former gravel quarry. 
  Tony Harman, the centre's manager, began noticing two years 
ago that the tips of alder branches were dying, particularly at 
the top of trees. "Since then it has got a lot worse," he said. 
"We reckon we have now lost about 40 percent of our alders." 
  Some of the trees, their roots weakened, toppled over into 
the water and others have been turned into leafless skeletons. 
Some had to be cut down because falling branches endangered 
school children visiting the reserve. 
  Alders account for up to 30 percent of tree cover on 
riverbanks. Georges Dusart, a senior lecturer in ecology at 
Christ Church College in Canterbury, said: "Alders not only look 
attractive; they are also important for fish life by providing 
river shade and food in the form of insects that fall from their 
leaves. 
  "I have been walking along riverbanks for 25 years and I 
have 
never seen so many alder deaths before." 
  In an article in Farmers Weekly earlier this 
summer, Dr. Dussart asked farmers with diseased alders to 
telephone him. He soon received calls from all parts of England. 
  The Forestry Commission is more cautious about the extent of 
the disease. David Rose, a tree pathologist at the commission's 
Alice Holt research station near Farnham, Surrey, said: "There 
does appear to be a recurring fungal problem with alders. It is 
locally serious, but there is nothing yet to indicate we are 
facing a national epidemic on the scale of Dutch elm disease." 
The preliminary results of analysis of tree samples from the 
Canterbury site suggest that the fungus attacking the roots of 
the alders belongs to the phytophthora family, which 
also cause potato blight, Mr. Rose said. The fungus may have 
migrated northwards from sub-tropical climes. 
  Dutch elm disease destroyed 25 million elms, including 90 
percent of those in southern England in the 1970's. The fungus 
which attacked them was spread by bark beetles. The fungus is 
still present in the roots of the destroyed trees and new elms 
that have grown from the remains of the old are now mature 
enough to sustain populations of the beetles which renew the 
attack.
