   ``Horse Feathers'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $29.95. No Rating)
   
   Even in this era of glasnost, ``Horse Feathers'' proves that Marx
still reigns supreme: Marx a la Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo.
   Marxism according to Minnie's Boys was always more akin to
anarchism, of course, starting with the title of this 1932 classic
which naturally bears no relationship whatsoever to the film's
goings-on.
   ``Horse Feathers'' takes us to Huxley College, a school so
desperate for a winning football season that it names Professor
Quincy Adams Wagstaff as its president. The good professor, played
by Groucho, quickly spells out his program for the school's revival
in one of the funniest musical bits ever filmed:
   ``I don't know what they have to say,
   ``It makes no difference anyway,
   ``Whatever it is, I'm against it!
   ``No matter what it is or who commenc'd it,
   ``I'm against it!''
   As with all Marx Brothers movies, it gives away nothing to say
that insanity prevails, Huxley whips the bad guys on the football
field and Groucho, Harpo and Chico commit trigamy with the campus
femme fatale known as ``the college widow.''
   For trivia collectors, said widow is played by Thelma Todd, a
comedian who in real life died a violent underworld-related death
three years after this movie was made.
   With the madcap S.J. Perelman as scriptwriter along with Bert
Kalmer and Harry Ruby, ``Horse Feathers'' was destined to be one of
the funniest Marx Brothers films, which is to say, one of the
funniest by anyone at anytime. It easily ranks with the Marx's
``Monkey Business'' and ``Duck Soup.''
   Groucho, always at the center of the antics, is perhaps a little
nastier than usual and that's just how we like it. Watch his scene
in the canoe, for example, wooeing the comely Todd with his guitar.
   Enough said. ``Horse Feathers'' is 69 minutes of non-stop
hilarity.

   ``Slipping Into Darkness'' (Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $79.95.
Rated R)
   
   This movie is so bad there isn't a funny way to review it. And
there's something scary, too. Read the box:
   ``Three bored college girls are looking for excitement in a
one-horse town when a careless joyride ends in the gruesome death of
a young boy. Because no one admits responsibility, the boy's brother
swears to solve the crime.''
   Right.
   You get this odious piece of anti-female trash thinking, ``Well,
hey, it looks schlocky and stupid but at least I'll see shock horror
beach party sex biker bimbos on parade.'' And pasteboard characters,
ludicrous situations and unrealistic behavior that's kind of a
savage ``Carry On...'' movie.
   This utterly mean, nasty, hateful movie reeks with contempt for
women and sullen hatred for men. The objects of its sexual violence
are stupid or perverse women and the objects of its mutilating
butchery are men.
   Then you find out that a woman, Eleanor Gaver, wrote and directed
it.
   This movie is pornography without the dignity of honest exercise.
