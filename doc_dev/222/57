<HEAD>Cyclists Complete 10-Day Trip Over Pony Express Route</HEAD>

   Two cyclists who completed a 10-day ride
from California over the original Pony Express trail said they
encountered many of the same problems that faced pony riders of 1860.
   ``We still had to contend with the weather. There were mud bogs
where our cars got stuck, hail storms and at one point we had to
rebuild the road. The elements haven't changed,'' said cyclist Matt
DeWaal said.
   ``I have great respect for the pony riders who rode month after
month without so much as a hot shower,'' he said.
   DeWaal and Jay Aldous arrived in St. Joseph at noon Friday to
complete a journey that started in Sacramento, Calif. Aldous and
DeWaal, both from Salt Lake City, pedaled through a ribbon at the
finish line in front of Patee House Museum, the 1860 Pony Express
headquarters.
   ``It felt neat to cross the bridge into Missouri and realize we
were finally here,'' Aldous told the crowd of 200 who watched the
arrival. ``The Pony Express trail was about 1,938 miles long, but we
rode 2,041 miles with detours.''
   It was the first time bicyclists had traveled the original trail
in the same 10-day time covered by pony riders 129 years ago.
   Joe Nardone, trailmaster and Pony Express historian, said Aldous
and DeWaal managed to cover 400 miles of original Pony Express trail
that remains almost untouched because of the rough and primitive
terrain.
   ``At one point they even had to help rebuild the trail road to
get through,'' Nardone said. ``Their ride helped call attention to
the Pony Express at a time when Congress is considering whether to
make the route a part of the National Trails system.''
   The support crew made daily health checks of the riders, and
filmed a documentary of their trek, which included camping at
original stations as they crossing the dusty trail.
   The ride was not the longest made by Aldous and DeWaal. They set
a world record in 1984, circling the globe by bicycle. They covered
14,290 miles on four continents and 22 countries in 106 days.
