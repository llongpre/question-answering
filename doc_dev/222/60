<TEXT>     The Mac users, the IBM users and the hopelessly anachronistic.;    Guess
which part I belong in?;    Having decided to dip my toe into the brave new
world -- I did get that get-your-messages-from-anywhere answering machine,
you'll remember -- and having resolved to take myself more seriously in this
brave new year, I decided to enter the home-computer market.;    And so I went
computer shopping. It was like Alice in Dunderheadland.;    Knowing I'd need
an interpreter for this journey, I did what I always do first.;    I went
crying to a man.;    The man, my future former husband, is an IBM type of
guy.;    I, or so I've been told, am a Macintosh type of gal.;    Hence the
fact that this man is my future former husband. He is still, however, my
friend, and promised not to get annoyed at my freak-outs and frustrations in
the computer store.;    Oh, I've changed, I told him. I'm sort of computer
literate now. And I have far more patience.;    The computer salesman pegged
me for a Mac gal right away.;    Not without hints. I told him all I wanted
was something a moron could learn to use.;    He told me serial numbers and
said "byte.";    We left empty-handed.;    No matter which system you decide
to go with, my -- oh, let's just call him X -- said it will take commitment to
learn to use it.;    Ooh. I had already been wrestling with another word
they'd been bandying about.;    Compatibility.;    Commitment and
compatibility; these are not some of my favorite things.;    We took a little
side trip to the software store.;    Every clerk there was shaped like a
Bartlett pear. One of the dangers of being too computer-friendly, I'm afraid.;
   The only software package I was even mildly interested in was the one that
came with a stuffed bunny.;    A clerk was working on a program where an
animated talking moose head was affixed to the corner of the screen.;    This
moose announced -- in a most grating voice -- every command the computer guy
gave him.;    I announced that I was having a nervous breakdown.;    I thought
you said you'd changed, X said.;    Oh, I forgot to tell you, I said. I'm a
liar now, too.;    I was too overwhelmed to go on. I went home and drank 500
beers.;    The next day, I woke up thinking "laptop.";    I have my most
inspired moments in bed, after all.;    Why not take advantage of those
moments where they happen and type while I'm on the recline?;    I called a
writer friend to discuss this prospect. She said she knows a woman who will
figure out just what I need and get it for me cheap.;    I am picturing that
lady who came to help that girl get out of the TV in "Poltergeist.";    And
then my friend Kelly called. He's an artist. He belongs somewhere in the
future or the past, but steers pretty clear of the '90s. (He didn't know what
that noise was when my call-waiting went off.);    I told him I was going to
get a computer.;    Why, he asked. I had to wonder.;    Let's face it. I'm not
an IBM person! I'm not a Mac person!;    I'm a Taurus.  </TEXT>
