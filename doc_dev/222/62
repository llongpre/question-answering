The opening programme of the Rambert season on Tuesday night was a
convincing portrait of the company as it has been shaped by Richard Alston.
Two new works, from six the troupe has created during the past year; design
by Richard Smith and Paul Huxley that marks a continuing involvement with
distinguished painters; serious modern scores - Nigel Osborne, David Sawer,
Frederic Rzewski - that inspire movement no less varied and intriguing. The
image is bright, fresh, and we are braced by what we see.
The evening opened with Alston's Wildlife. Dating from 1984, it is one of
his best pieces. Beneath the luminous shapes of Richard Smith's pendant
kites, the choreography explores activities - watchful, sportive, erotic -
that belong to the fauna of some other world. Nigel Osborne's score is
varied in texture, and Alston responds with vivid incidents: a serene
nocturne for Amanda Britton; a sensual duet for Alexandra Dyer and Paul Old;
a group dance that buoyantly matches the gamelan echoes of the score. Here
is an abstraction of animal behaviour that seems all the more potent, and
true, for not being specific.
Alston's newest work is Cat's Eye, with a score by David Sawer whose punchy
rhythms are well suited to dance, and with handsome design by Paul Huxley -
rectangles of solid colour, flown against a midnight blue cloth, that make
the stage area seem vibrant. The dance is as plotless as the decor, but Gary
Lambert is a master of its ceremonies, dancing with ebullient energy, and
marking the score's jazzy nuances with just the suggestion of a shimmy. I am
not sure, after one viewing, how the choreography holds together - if it is,
indeed, intended to cohere - but its varied incidents are pleasing, and
offer a melting, pretty solo to Jacqueline Jones, which she shows off with
great charm.
Siobhan Davies' creation for the company is Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues.
Industrial life has rarely inspired choreography. Foregger's optimistic
machine dances in early Soviet days; Gertrud Bodenwieser's fascination with
'The Demon Machine' at about the same time; Massine's picture of urban
proletariat in Le Pas d'acier for Diaghilev, were hardly concerned with
industry itself. Even the Marxist spectacles staged by workers' dance groups
during the Depression in New York were more protest than explanation. What
Davies has done is to make a subtle, compassionate comment upon an
industrial community.
Her starting point is Frederic Rzewski's eponymous piano score, which
develops from an rhythmic mimicry of machine noise into a touching 'blues'.
Alexandra Dyer and Amanda Britton first appear, in a prelude that evokes
physical exhaustion as well as companionship, and they will similarly
provide a postlude to the work. They are joined by eight dancers whose
movements tell of the routine of factory production, of the tedium of
repetitive industrial action, even - in the way the dance crosses the stage
 -of the movement of shuttle across loom, as if the machine conditioned its
operators. Gabrielle McNaughton is shown as a physically buoyant figure, but
the idea of blues as lament imbues the choreography with an elegiac mood.
Without literalism, and with a characteristic finesse, the dance speaks of
the human - and the industrially dehumanising - condition.
In her finest work, Siobhan Davies offers something of the visual integrity
we see in Gwen John's painting. In this new piece the matching of score,
inspiration and imagery is acutely judged. As a musical note, I salute John
Sweeney's performance of the Rzewski blues, and the excellent account of the
Osborne and Sawer scores by the Mercury Ensemble under Roger Heaton. The
ballets were very well lit, by Peter Mumford and Michael Hulls. The Royalty
Theatre has one of the most hideous of theatrical interiors, but its stage
is well suited for troupes of Rambert size, and the dance looks good.
Rambert Dance Company continues at the Royalty Theatre until June 27 with
varied programmes.
