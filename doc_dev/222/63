   ``March'' (RCA) _ Michael Penn
   
   Yes, Michael Penn is you-know-who's younger brother, and critics
looking for an easy hook are quick to note his music is as sweet as
Sean's temper is frequently sour.
   Despite the connection, there's no evidence of nepotism here.
Penn's debut album is a pleasing slice of pure pop and if he errs,
it's only on the side of boyish enthusiasm.
   ``No Myth,'' the first single and the album's lead cut, sets an
immediate light-hearted tone. Penn sings Beatlesque melodies in a
slightly ragged tenor, centering most songs around his acoustic
guitar and building from there.
   What takes the songs out of the ``Rubber Soul'' era are pounding
drums emphasized in the mix, a reflection of the current scene's
preoccupation with the beat. Drum machines handle part of the load,
but Jim Keltner's outstanding performance on ``Brave New World''
shows how the real thing can never be completely duplicated.
   Penn collaborates with keyboardist Patrick Warren on most of the
music. Although there's an occasional dud, Penn hits more often
than he misses. ``This and That'' and ``Bedlam Boys'' are the
strongest after ``No Myth,'' and ``Evenfall'' brings the album to a
rollicking close.
   Penn tries hard lyrically, and his Dylan-like wordplay on
``Brave New World'' works well. Sometimes he tries too hard, as
this couplet from the turgid ``Cupid's Got a Brand New Gun''
attests: ``It glitters like a viper, readies its attack, tears your
flesh and soul apart, then clings to your back.''
   ``March'' also sounds a tad overproduced. Bragging you've got
studio pros like Keltner and Kenny Aronoff dueting on drums may pad
an industry reputation, but their work doesn't mean anything if the
song isn't there. The songs are there, but sometimes too much
window-dressing is added.
   If he can retain his ability to write catchy melodies and hack
some of the unnecessary verbiage from his writing, Penn has a
promising future.

   ``All the Way'' (Solar-Epic) _ Calloway
   
   The proper way to listen to Calloway's first album is with your
feet.
   Dance floor stompers and toe-to-toe swayers mix together on
``All the Way.''
   This record is funky and soulful, but it's Funky Soulful Lite.
Nothing hits too hard. There's a bit of rapping, but Public Enemy
it ain't. It's thrown in as a little sample of contemporary sound.
   ``Sir Lancelot,'' the album's opener, is the groove-i-est cut.
It and ``All the Way,'' the hardest-hitting track, are dance
rave-ups. They won't burn down the house like a Bobby Brown or
Janet Jackson cut, but they're warm enough.
   The duo's ballads slide along cozily, without getting too deep
or urgent.
   On the first single, Calloway sings ``I Wanna Be Rich,'' but
unlike the 9-million-pounds-of-gold-necklaces bad attitude of some
rappers, Calloway sings to be rich in ``love, peace and happiness.''
   The energy level on ``All the Way'' jumps up and down like a
confused thermometer.
   Both sides start with pumped-up tunes, but then flatten out into
ballads.
   Another dance track, ``Freaks Compete,'' pops up between ballads
on the first side.
   ``All the Way'' is brothers Reggie and Cino-vincent Calloway's
debut effort as Calloway. Their recording history includes seven
years, one platinum album and two gold albums with the dance-soul
group Midnight Star, and writing and production credits for several
other artists, including Levert (the dance floor smash
``Casanova''), Gladys Knight and the Pips (the Grammy-winning
``Love Overboard''), Natalie Cole (``Jump Start My Heart'') and
Teddy Pendergrass (``Joy'').
