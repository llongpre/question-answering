   An archaeological team is sifting through
a Sierra Nevada campsite for remnants from the final days of George
and Jacob Donner, whose dreams of life in sunny California ended
near here in icy disaster.
   The two brothers from Illinois and most of their party died 144
years ago when a raging October snowstorm halted their westward
trek and sealed their fate.
   Donald Hardesty, an archaeologist at the University of Nevada,
Reno, is leading a team of students and volunteers in an effort to
pinpoint the exact whereabouts of the brothers' last camp at Alder
Creek.
   ``This camp is not nearly as well known or understood through
written accounts,'' he said Thursday.
   The Donner families stopped at Alder Creek when a wagon axle
broke. The rest of the party continued to a lake about five miles
away, now known as Donner Lake.
   Incessant snow trapped both groups for six months in 1846-1847.
As starvation set in, they ate boiled hides for nourishment. When
those were gone, they turned to the flesh of their comrades who
died of weakness.
   Of the 87 people who became stranded, 39 survived. Nine of the
12 adults and nine children with the Donner families lived to see
the spring. The Donner brothers did not.
   Hardesty said it is believed George Donner used tree limbs
propped against a giant Ponderosa Pine that still towers over the
site, and covered them with animal hides and quilts for a shelter.
Jacob Donner created a similar lean-to for his family about 200
yards away.
   Hardesty hopes to uncover the location of a third camp believed
to have been used by teamsters traveling with the families.
   Armed with buckets, brushes, trowels and sifters, 19 students
and 10 volunteers sifted the soil near the two sites on Thursday in
the joint venture of the university and the U.S. Forest Service.
   As the excavating team worked in the warm June sunshine, yellow
and purple wildflowers bloomed in a nearby meadow and the sweet
scent of sagebrush perfumed the air. But almost as a reminder of
the task, gray clouds hugged the snowcapped peaks of the Sierra.
   Hardesty said the group hopes to find small items and fragments
at Alder Creek.
   He said diaries were kept by those at the Donner Lake cabins,
but no writings have been found near the Alder Creek site.
   Hardesty participated in a 1984 excavation of the Donner Lake
site, where bone fragments, cloth remnants, chips of pottery and
hardware were uncovered. The most significant find there, he said,
was a bronze, Roman Catholic medallion.
