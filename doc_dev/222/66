or rather with Mr Rochester - when I was 12. I used to talk with Mr
Rochester on the way to school. 'My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic
prayer are all nothing to you?' 'I am going, sir.' 'Withdraw then; but
remember, you leave me in anguish.' Years later, reading Muriel Spark's The
Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, I discovered her adolescent character Sandy
chatting to Alan Breck, the hero of Kidnapped, and realised that generations
of bluestocking teenagers fantasise about literary heroes as others idolise
pop stars.
Jane Eyre was an overwhelming literary experience. I read it almost
non-stop, day and night, over 72 hours. It was the first classic novel that
I enjoyed and the one that suggested what literature was about. It is a
compelling story, but reading it, I suddenly saw that there is more to a
great book than a good yarn; that fine original language and the brilliant
artistic cohesion of form, words, images, create the pleasure of the text. I
re-read it obsessively, for the joy of its highly wrought language and
fevered emotional pitch. Charlotte Bronte's near Biblical cadences thrill
with romance. Jane Eyre is the perfect teenage novel.
Jane Eyre closed the door on children's books and opened up a brave new
world of Victorian fiction. Many people recall the frenzy of adolescent
reading - Graham Greene wrote of 'the missed heartbeat, the appalled glee,'
at a new discovery on the library shelf.
For me it was evoked by each Bronte novel, then by Pride and Prejudice, The
Mill on the Floss, Tess of the D'Urbervilles where romantic satisfaction was
denied - in Madam Bovary, say - I wilfully misread the book, inventing happy
endings or lovers of Rochester-like machismo and fidelity.
Indirectly, Jane Eyre sparked off many cultural pleasures. Its intense
vision was so enticing that it tempted a search for other ways of losing
oneself in an artist's imaginative world, in drama, opera. In museums, there
was the chance to seek Rochester or D'Arcy lookalikes among 19th century
portraits.
All this was a mixed blessing. While most teenagers in the 1970s were out
disco dancing, I was locked into Victorian England. It was a shock to find
that there was more to life than prim governesses, and that men were not
like Mr Rochester.
Yet I still find Jane Eyre a great love story, as consoling and satisfying
as Cinderella, the archetypal tale on which it is unconsciously based.
Cinderella talks to the wronged child in all of us, and makes us feel
special and redeemed; so does Jane Eyre.
