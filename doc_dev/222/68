AN EMPLOYEE of Lehman, the US finance house, yesterday challenged an order
that he submit to oral examination by the joint liquidators of Bishopsgate
Investment Management, the company from which hundreds of millions of pounds
of Maxwell group pension funds have disappeared.
Mr Mark Haas, a manager in Lehman's fixed income division and an executive
director of Lehman Brothers International, asked the High Court to discharge
or vary the order, made under the Insolvency Act. His examination has been
provisionally fixed for tomorrow.
Mr Charles Aldous QC, for Mr Haas, told Mr Justice Hoffmann that Mr Haas was
not seeking to have the order discharged with a view to withholding
information from the liquidators.
He had not been involved in the introduction of any Maxwell companies to
Lehman, nor in the establishment of a stock lending agreement entered into
with BIM in November 1989. He had not become involved in the agreement until
about August 1990.
The liquidators believed that pension fund assets had been charged under the
agreement as collateral for loans which, although ostensibly for the benefit
of BIM, had in fact gone to other Maxwell companies or interests.
Mr Haas was willing to answer written questions but objected to an
'oppressive' oral examination in which questions could be put ranging over
the whole of the operation of the stock lending agreement.
Mr Aldous suggested that the 'sole or predominant' purpose of the oral
examination was not to get Mr Hass's assistance about the agreement but 'to
seek to establish by admissions a case against a third party or the company
which employs him'.
Lehman had already provided an enormous amount of documents, Mr Aldous said.
It was estimated that since April 1 about 10,000 had been made available.
Mr John Brisby, counsel for the liquidators, said all questions that could
sensibly be dealt with in writing had been dealt with. 'We are now down to
the rump of things we say can only be dealt with by oral examination,' he
said.
The hearing continues today.
