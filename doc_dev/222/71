<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ray Nestor, a onetime Kenyan farmer whose first
book of art was published on his 100th birthday, died June 5 in
Crowborough, a Sussex town 40 miles south of London, a friend said
today. No cause of death was given for Nestor, who would have been
101 in October.
   ``An African Sketchbook'' demonstrated watercolors and drawings
of Kenya's landscape, animals and people made during Nestor's years
in Kenya when he farmed in the Nandi hills. His pictures were
accompanied by extracts from his memoirs and those of his wife,
Dorothy.
   Elspeth Huxley, the novelist and writer on Africa who knew Nestor
wrote in The Independent newspaper that his drawings depicted an
Africa ``that has gone forever.''
   Nestor was an early conservationist, banning shooting, terracing
his land to prevent erosion and protecting his trees.
   Nestor went to Kenya from England in 1912 as a government
surveyor before taking up farming. He was badly wounded in the 1916
Somme battle in France in World War I. Nestor returned to England in
1949.
   Survivors and funeral arrangements were not immediately known.
