   Paranoia produces profits in the dark, dangerous
world created by Eric Overmyer's ``In Perpetuity Throughout the
Universe,'' a strange, sinister comedy that arrived over the
weekend at off-Broadway's Hudson Guild Theater.
   Much of it is set in a lunatic-fringe publishing house whose
owner collects what she calls conspiracy theorists of the left and
right _ the kind of authors who believe Jimmy Hoffa is alive and
well and living in Brazil, or who whisper that the Catholic Church
killed Abraham Lincoln or who write books about Washington D.C. and
refer to it as the Zionist Occupation Government.
   The title of the play comes from book-contract lingo, having to
do with the publishing rights being wrapped up ``in perpetuity
throughout the universe.''
   Overmyer is a dazzling verbal acrobat as well as a serious
student of pop culture. Both linguist and cultural anthropologist
get a workout here. The play's language is sly and sharp, and the
comedy a mixture and appreciation of high and low brow. Sort of
like Tom Stoppard meets TV Guide.
   The heroes of ``In Perpetuity Throughout the Universe'' are the
ghostwriters employed to turn the crazy, conspiratorial ideas into
best sellers. The play focuses on three of these editors,
particularly a young woman named Christine who has been hired to
incorporate anti-Asian propaganda into a fictional potboiler called
``Yellow Emperor: the New Fu Manchu.''
   Christine's Chinese boyfriend, Dennis Wu, also works for this
publishing house. They spend their off-hours playing ``list'' games
_ people they would kill after the revolution, such as landlords,
mimes and Andrew Lloyd Webber; famous B movies like ``Faster
Pussycat, Kill, Kill'', or the names of people who have disappeared
but may not be gone, like Hoffa or D.B. Cooper.
   Dennis also becomes Christine's fantasy as she dreams about the
novel she is ghostwriting and conjures up the Fu Manchu of movie
fame, the familiar villain with long red nails and sneering smile.
   Another editor, an intense man named Lyle Vial, is obsessed by
chain letters that threaten doom for anyone who breaks the chain.
It is the ultimate paranoia. Vial at last discovers the first chain
letter, written during the Norman invasion of England, and what
happened to such medieval doubters as Thomas the Confessor when
they interrupted its good luck.
   There is a serious underpinning to all of Overmyer's high and
low-flying wit. It's expressed by Dennis in several speeches about
his past and his Chinese heritage which has either been ignored or
disparaged by the white man.
   Most of the cast has been able to negotiate Overmyer's difficult
script. Particularly successful are Carolyn McCormick as the
ghostwriter who develops a conscience and Arthur Hanket as the
chain-letter freak.
   Director Stan Wojewodski Jr. of Baltimore's Center Stage has
given the play a fluid, cinematic feeling as the short scenes blend
quickly into each other. The cold, hard-edged setting by
Christopher Barreca mirrors the play's strange, chilly world, an
environment harshly but appropriately lighted by Stephen
Strawbridge.
   In ``On the Verge,'' Overmyer's most successful play, three
Victorian ladies begin an exhilarating journey through time and
space that eventually brings them to the Brave New World of 1955.
The three editors in this play travel, too, but they are on a
darker expedition, probing the fears and prejudices of society.
Overmyer makes it a wild, unnerving ride.
