THE DESCENT OF MANNERS: ETIQUETTE, RULES AND THE VICTORIANS by Andrew St
George Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 20, 330 pages
THIS IS a highly learned and acutely perceptive book about a little-studied
aspect of Victorian history - the esoteric yet powerful codes of conduct
that ruled society in the 1850s and 1860s. As the century wore on these came
to be relaxed. 'Personality for the mid-Victorians functioned on the public
stage, lit by moral certainties and prompted by etiquette books. As the
scientific 1870s began to explore the mind's workings . . . the relation of
the public acting to the private thinking self began to alter.'
The world of Oscar Wilde was very different from that of Martin Tupper or
Samuel Smiles, whose relentless moral preaching was supplanted by that
combination of romance, candour and cynicism associated with the fin de
siecle. This was itself a reaction against another blow to mid-Victorian
certainties - Darwinism, with its implications for faith and religion. The
Decadents and the Scientists did not agree with each other but neither group
had any use for the intellectual culture of the days of the Great
Exhibition.
This is a subtle and somewhat discursive book which needs to be read with
care and with some previous knowledge of 19th century history - American as
well as British, for one of the author's six chapters is devoted to
'American Manners and Transatlantic Attitudes'. It is one of the most
interesting sections of a fascinating book.
In discussing the Ladies Pocket Book of Etiquette (1838), published in
Liverpool and convenient for the boat to New York, St. George defines the
difference between manners and the subject of that book. Manners is 'the way
we relate to everyone else and etiquette the way an individual relates to
others in the same class or narrow 'society''. In a recent interview on
Radio 4 with an abrasive Australian woman, St. George made the point that
good manners are a matter of putting yourself in the place of the people you
are meeting and behaving accordingly with civility, courtesy and tolerance.
It is for example customary in American etiquette (ie arbitrary usage) first
to cut up the meat on your plate and then to eat it with fork only, or in
China to put your guest of honour on your left, not right. But good manners
in any society forbids noisy interruption of other people's conversation, or
barrack room expletives in mixed company, or symptoms of boredom with your
neighbour. As Lord Chesterfield observed in his famous Letters, 'Be
therefore, I beg of you, not only really, but seemingly and manifestly
attentive to whoever speaks to you'. Chesterfield long pre-dated the
Victorians but their books on manners were largely based on his, with the
addition, as St. George puts it, of 'popular morals and stringent religious
conformism appealing to a system which lay outside that of class or social
relations'.
In this book he uses 'manners' in an even wider sense, more like the OED
definition as 'conditions of society'. He takes as his text John Stuart
Mill's observation: 'The English, more than any other people, not only act
but feel according to rule.' The successive gurus of this attitude were
Tupper first and then Smiles. Tupper's Proverbial Wisdom is written in a
cringe-making prose/poetry. Shelley maintained that poets were 'the
unacknowledged legislators of the world' (though one can doubt whether any
Bill drafted by him would have got very far with the Clerks of Parliament).
Tupper really did for a time lay down the moral law for the British middle
class. He was not as silly as his critics later made out. A man who defeated
Gladstone for the Theology Prize at Christ Church, Oxford, could not have
been a fool.
But fashions change. The evangelical simplicities which conditioned his
outlook faded away and a spiteful sonnet on him referred in its last line to
his works as 'A monstrous pile of quintessential ROT]' Smiles never became a
comparable figure of fun. He wisely stuck to prose. His best-selling
Self-Help used biographical examples rather than flowery admonitions to make
his point. He continued to be widely read well into the 1880s.
Andrew St. George has written a book which will be obligatory reading for
students of Victorian history. He covers a wide range of subjects -
furniture; the 1851 Exhibition; the Contagious Diseases Acts; financial
successes and frauds; the effect of Darwin and Huxley on thought and
religion; the details about calling and leaving cards; clothes, clubs and
courtship. I was left with one question mark. If Mill was right about the
English being unusual in feeling as well as acting according to rule, why
did they differ from other European countries? Perhaps in some later work
the author will give us an answer.
