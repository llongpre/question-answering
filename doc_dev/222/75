<LEADPARA>  A COLLEAGUE who says he's having "this midlife crisis kind of thing" discusses
a symptom. "All during the holidays, I'd see little kids and ask them what
they want to be when they grow up. I was looking for ideas.";    Chances are,
the kids didn't understand his motive. "What will you be when you grow up?" --
irresistible for adults -- can be a burden for children. Especially children
like Jeremy and Hattie, the stars of "Jeremy's Decision," by author Ardyth
Brott and illustrator Michael Martchenko (A Cranky Nell book/Kane Miller, 32
pp., $12.95) and "Hattie and the Wild Waves" by Barbara Cooney, (Viking, 44
pp., $14.95).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Jeremy Brodski likes classical music and loves staying up late, but he has
grown tired of going to concerts because fancy-dress bores persist in asking
him, "Are you going to be a conductor like your father?";    One memorable
night, when a fellow concertgoer notices what really engages Jeremy's
attention, Jeremy makes his decision. "I'm going to be a paleontologist when I
grow up, NOT a conductor." Even his sister, Allegra, is stunned by his
decisiveness, but maybe that's because she knows she'll provide the book's
surprise ending.;     This book is a winner in the Robert Munsch tradition
(Martchenko has illustrated for him, too): caricature that's tuned in to kids'
frustrations and clever enough to inspire some remedies. Almost any kid will
like it, and children of the famous and high-achieving may consider it an
answered prayer.;     Barbara Cooney is a tradition unto herself, and fans of
"Miss Rumphius" will be wild for "Hattie and the Wild Waves," a story based on
the life of Cooney's mother. Hattie is the youngest child of German immigrants
who strike it prosperous in Brooklyn. As Hattie grows, the family moves to
ever more Vanderbilt-ish locales, and Hattie contemplates her future.;     The
book hints that Hattie's decision to paint is not exactly what others expect
of her. ("Dummkopf!" chides her brother, the one who's destined to take over
the family construction empire. "Girls don't paint houses!") But Hattie knows
her heart from an early age, and there's little doubt that she'll answer her
muse.;    As always, Cooney's work epitomizes charm, but just as surely it
captures complexity. Hattie's best friend, a servant girl, has aspirations of
her own. Little Mouse (Cooney is unflinching even about the girl's nickname)
is shown in her apron, her hair unribboned, serving at table or withdrawing
discreetly from the bright parlor. Cooney manages to be faithful to the
unmistakable comfort of her mother's life without unthinkingly glamorizing an
"Upstairs/Downstairs" world.; QUEST BETS: Finding your true path is more than
a career choice, as a legion of Joseph Campbell fans remind us. These
mystical, mythical aspects of coming of age are explored in "Gwinna" by
Barbara Helen Berger (Philomel, 147 pp., $18.95) and "Crow and Weasel" by
Barry Lopez (the National Book Award-winning author of "Arctic Dreams") and
illustrator Tom Pohrt (North Point Press, 63 pp., $16.95). Both are
magnificently illustrated books that mimic ancient tales and aim to provide
contemporary sustenance. As author Barry Lopez says in "Crow and Weasel," a
book that zoomed to best-sellerdom during the holiday season, "The stories
people tell have a way of taking care of them.";    In "Gwinna," a childless
couple asks the Mother of the Owls for a baby. Then they thoughtlessly bind
the girl's back when it appears that she's growing wings. They are punished by
being turned to stone, and the flame-haired daughter will endure quite a few
trials and enchantments (of the magic mountain and harp variety) before
sorting things out.;    In "Crow and Weasel," two young braves (of an
imaginary, but derivative, North American tribe) go walkabout. Their
destination? "Farther north than anyone had ever gone, farther north than
their people's stories went." Their conversation? A great deal of quotes we
doubt ever got quoted, like "Do you think the trees will be like cottonwoods
and alders, slender and all growing together, their leaves fluttering in the
wind?";    It's a book-reviewing cliche, but it's accurate nonetheless: If you
like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing you'll like.;    But "Crow
and Weasel" made me smirk. (Crow and Weasel -- who are really a crow and
really a weasel -- ride horses and wear elkskin robes? I was reminded of the
problem with Disney cartoons: How can Goofy and Pluto both be dogs?) "Gwinna"
put me to sleep. Real fairy tales, real myths make me snap to attention.;   
You have to be extraordinarily good to out-classic the classics. Stephen
Sondheim is, in "Into the Woods," but he had a lot of out-of-town tryouts
first. Both "Gwinna" and "Crow and Weasel" might have been better stories, had
they been annealed by a few skeptic listeners.; IS THIS THE PERFECT PLOT FOR
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OR WHAT? Girls today might be incredulous to learn this,
but there was a time when females could aspire only to become teachers or
nurses. I'm sure that's not true now, because two recent young-adult novels
star sensitive middle-school girls who want only to be authors.;    In "Libby
on Wednesday," by Marin County author Zilpha Keatley Snyder (Delacorte, 196
pp., $14.95), the heroine is a precocious home-schooled child who gets a dose
of "socialization" by enrolling in Morrison Middle School. She falls into a
writers' group with four other students who are interesting in a "Breakfast
Club" variety of ways.;    In "Author! Author!" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux,
167 pp., $14.95), San Franciscan Susan Terris opens with her heroine's first
book signing. A family friend -- the "moody, difficult poet Tekla Reis" -- has
shown Valerie Myerson's work to a fancy agent. One story completed at age 7
has been published as a children's book now that Valerie is 12. Valerie,
somewhat worried that she'll be a has-been before she's out of Oxy-10, is
casting about for new writing projects. They center on the apparent
estrangement between Reis and her parents.;    Neither book is especially good
or especially bad (although I preferred the subtler "Libby on Wednesday").
Taken together, as a comment on adolescent literary careerism, they make me a
little nervous. Valerie, seeking writing advice, is told she should "observe
ruthlessly." Telling adolescent to do that seems about as unnecessary -- and
maybe as risky -- as telling a toddler to climb things. Not surprisingly,
Valerie becomes a pain in the butt to everyone she knows.;    Snyder and
Terris, both well-established young-adult authors, must know what pleases
their audience, but as a book review editor I'd feel happier if the coming
generations weren't encouraged to get a 10-year head start on their workshop
fiction. There are problems enough in junior high without writer's block.  </TEXT>
