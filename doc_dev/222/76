<P>
When a reviewer asserts that a writer's work "is marred by factual errors," he 
or she had best scrutinize his or her notes. 
</P>
<P>
In Tom Dardis' piece on my new biography, "Huxley in Hollywood" (Book Review, 
Oct. 22), he suggests that I have incorrectly married Bertolt Brecht to 
screenwriter Salka Viertel and misdated Weill's "Johnny Johnson." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I wrote that Brecht used Viertel's garage as a studio, and that the 
1936 "Johnny Johnson" was newly topical in 1939. Dardis, who consistently 
misspells Viertel's name -- and mine -- should be more careful.
