A GLIMPSE of the brave new world of American television was offered
yesterday by Tele-Commmunications the biggest cable television operator in
the US. TCI said it could provide as many as 500 television channels by
1994.
TCI said within the next two years it planned to introduce digital
compression technology, which allows one standard cable channel to become 10
channels, to as many as 1m homes in the US. TCI could expand the service to
as many as 10m household subscribers.
Most cable subscribers in the US now receive 30 to 40 channels. But the TCI
move is likely to cause other cable operators in the US to follow.
Time Warner, another of the big US cable operators, has begun an experiment
offering 150 channels to subscribers in the Queens section of New York. But
the experiment is a limited one, so far.
The new technology means American television viewers could soon find
themselves with a bewildering panoply of special interest stations,
pay-per-view services, sports, movies and inter-active services that bring
together computers and television.
Inter-active television is a priority among cable operators. The new TCI
multi-channel system is expected to offer inter-active services, allowing a
home viewer to press a button to vote in an opinion poll, order dinner, shop
for consumer goods or play a computer game.
'Television,' said Mr John Malone, president of TCI, 'will never be the
same.'
