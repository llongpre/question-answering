   Actor and announcer Vic Perrin, who provided
the spooky voice that told viewers of ``The Outer Limits'' TV show
that their sets had just been taken over by mysterious forces, has
died of cancer. He was 73.
   Perrin, who died Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was
known to millions in the 1960s for saying at the beginning of each
``Outer Limits'' show: ``There is nothing wrong with your television
set. ... Do not attempt to adjust the picture. ... We are
controlling transmission.''
   He would come on again at the show's conclusion to ``return
control'' of the set to the viewer and leave the audience with a
moral for that week's episode of the science fiction anthology
series.
   Perrin, born in Menomonee Falls, Wis., graduated from the
University of Wisconsin before moving West in 1940. In Hollywood, he
embarked on a career in radio that was to make his voice, if not his
face or name, known to millions.
   His worked as a radio announcer for both ABC and NBC and was a
regular on such shows as the radio version of ``Gunsmoke,'' ``One
Man's Family,'' ``Fort Laramie'' and ``Yours Truly Johnny Dollar.''
   In 1956, Perrin joined ``The CBS Radio Workshop'' a short-lived
but critically praised series that broadcast experimental dramas and
classics, including a narration by Aldous Huxley of his ``Brave New
World.''
   Later, Perrin appeared regularly on such TV shows as ``Dragnet,''
``Mission Impossible,'' ``Gunsmoke,'' ``Star Trek,'' ``Big Valley''
and ``Maverick.''
   He also was the announcer on several commercials, but refused to
go before the cameras to sell products, saying that ``if they see me
in a commercial, they can't believe me as an actor.''
   Perrin's voice can still be heard on reruns of ``The Outer
Limits,'' which originally aired form 1963 to 1965, and at Disney
World's The Spaceship Earth and Exxon Energy Pavilion attractions.
   He is survived by his wife, Rita; a son; and a stepson. A
memorial service was scheduled for Wednesday in Studio City.
