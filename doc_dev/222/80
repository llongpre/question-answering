<F P=106> [Interview with Janusz Korwin-Mikke, chairman of Union for </F>
Real Politics, by correspondent Barbara Szczepula; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Szczepula] To begin with, let us talk about money. 
About our money. A few days ago, Minister Modzelewski announced 
his intention to increase the real estate tax to 10 percent.... 
  [Korwin-Mikke] That announcement was simply unbelievable. I 
even suspect that Minister Modzelewski did it to spite the 
government coalition and expose it to ridicule because, as we 
know, they want to dismiss him and have already given him his 
notice. Ten percent! No one imposes real estate taxes of such 
magnitude, not even an occupying force. It is a forced 
contribution levied on a nation, and a very high contribution at 
that. It is dreadful! 
  [Szczepula] Not everyone sees it in the same way. During a 
meeting at the "Zak" club, a young man pointed out to you that 
the proposed tax applies exclusively to tenement-house owners, 
and, because he did not own a tenement house, he was not at all 
affected by the thing. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] And I asked him: And where do you live? 
Under a bridge? Because, unless the youth in question lives 
under a bridge, the real estate tax will affect him as well. 
This is because the owner of the house where our hero lives 
will naturally include the costs of the tax in his tenants' 
rents. And that will happen regardless of whether the owner is 
an individual, a housing cooperative, or a local authority. You 
must understand the simple truth that that tax will not be paid 
by the wealthy tenement house owners, land owners, and so on. 
The tax will be paid by the consumer. It will be factored into 
the costs of bread, rent, shoes, and gasoline. And one other 
thing. I recall an exchange of correspondence with a reader 
resident in California, published a while ago by one of our 
weeklies. It concerned a referendum on lowering the real estate 
tax in California. Our inquisitive compatriot, who was a 
correspondent of the weekly in question, asked a 
none-too-affluent-looking local resident whether he had voted 
for or against the lowering of the real estate tax. "I voted for 
it," was the reply. "Do you yourself own any real estate?" our 
inquisitive reporter wanted to know. "I don't, but I could," 
was the reply. 
  [Szczepula] But, considering that it has not yet been 
decided when the tax in question should be imposed, we can still 
hope that we can last out until then. Just as in the story 
about the man sentenced to death by the sultan, who, in exchange 
for having the execution of the sentence postponed for a year, 
undertook to teach a monkey to speak. When asked how he 
proposed to make good his undertaking, he answered that he would 
worry about that later because, in the course of the year, the 
sultan could die--or the monkey or himself. Consequently, we 
can still cherish the hope that the sultan or the monkey will 
die before the new tax on real estate is brought into practice, 
and that we will outlive them. "Lower taxes" is the standard 
motto of your movement, but not all of your proposals have met 
with the same public approval. I am thinking here of the 
recommendation that the price of vodka be drastically lowered. 
People are rather shocked by such proposals. They reason as 
follows: "Cheaper vodka will be tantamount to more extensive 
alcoholism in society." 
  [Korwin-Mikke] That kind of reasoning is erroneous. Just as 
an increase in the price of vodka does not cut its consumption, 
so its decrease will not raise it at all. On the other hand, we 
should indeed examine the reasons that vodka is so expensive. 
It is 10 times more expensive than it should be. Well, it is 
because of the monopoly tax. Which is truly horrendous. 
  In any case, what is the result of the fact that the price 
of vodka is so high? Smugglers bring liquor to Poland 
illegally, while our own distilleries stand idle. This is 
because farmers are unable to sell their potatoes or rye grain. 
The industry suffers. The bureaucratic machine rakes in the 
money for the vodka. As a result, the poor families--because 
the families of alcoholics are always poor--suffer. If vodka 
were cheaper, perhaps our alcoholics would be able to put some 
money aside rather than spend it all on alcohol and, in this 
way, keep it for their wives and their children. Please note 
how many people profit from the organized smuggling of vodka to 
Poland. On the other hand, if we were to lower the price of 
alcohol, smugglers would take our vodka out of the country, and 
so the distilleries would profit and the farmers would 
profit.... In other words, a normal situation would prevail. 
  [Szczepula] You insist that taxes are the true measure of 
our freedom. The lower the taxes, the more freedoms available 
to the citizens. This kind of reasoning would suggest that the 
Swedes are the most captive nation in our world: After all, 
they pay as much as 80 percent of their incomes in taxes. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Precisely. The Swedes and the Poles. Seen 
from the inside, Sweden presents a horrific picture. 
  [Szczepula] What do you mean by this? For many of our 
compatriots, Sweden is the nearest equivalent to a paradise on 
earth. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Swedish society is a captive society. 
Something along the lines of Huxley's Brave New 
World. However, there is one fundamental difference 
between Sweden and Poland. Sweden is a wealthy country, having 
made its fortune by selling iron ore abroad during the two world 
wars. So it has enough money to be able to afford to lose some. 
On the other hand, we do not have the resources from which to 
finance socialism. 
  [Szczepula] The Union for Real Politics [UPR] wants to do 
away with socialism and introduce capitalism on a large scale, 
but the latest election showed that people do not want 
capitalism. After all, they voted for the left-wing orientation. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] But why did they do so? Because the people 
who ruled Poland recently were akin in their views to the U.S. 
Democrats. They claimed that they were building capitalism in 
Poland. But, in fact, they took as many loans as they could, 
they got rid of their Syrena cars and bought Volvos instead, and 
they kept on traveling toward socialism. Or, rather, 
Eurosocialism. So it was a ride in a larger and better vehicle, 
but it was still a ride in the wrong direction. Therefore, 
people got confused. In any case, after 45 years of life under 
real socialism, it is very difficult to accept the truth that 
there is no such thing as a free lunch. 
  [Szczepula] On the other hand, UPR proposes the introduction 
of capitalism, and people are afraid of that. For example, your 
plans to privatize all schools make people recoil in horror. 
Teachers are afraid that they will lose their jobs; parents are 
afraid that they will not be able to afford to pay for their 
children's educations. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] You are now citing a classical example of 
demagoguery promoted by the Polish Teachers Association. There 
will be smaller classes in private schools, which means that 
there will be a need for more teachers. 
  [Szczepula] But parents have their fears, too. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Statistically speaking, parents spend on 
average some 700,000 zlotys [Z] per child per month in a 
publicly owned school. This money is not paid directly to the 
school but is hidden in taxes: in gasoline, electricity, vodka, 
and so on. Out of that sum, about Z300,000-400,000 reach the 
school. The rest is swallowed by the bureaucratic machine. If 
parents could keep that sum of Z700,000--or even Z600,000--in 
their pockets, they would be able to pay Z500,000 in school fees 
and still have Z100,000 with which to buy, say, books for the 
child. At the same time, the school would still be getting much 
more money than it gets nowadays. At the moment, parents 
support huge crowds of officials from the Ministry of Education 
and local education authorities with the money they pay in 
taxes. In addition, that money is spent on supporting people 
who make controversial decisions about their children's 
educations contrary to the parents' wishes. 
  [Szczepula] Let us now talk about values and principles. 
The blue cross of St. George, which figures on your party's 
flag, is said to symbolize your fight for principles. What 
principles are these? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] St. George gave his energies to fight the 
dragon. The fact that in Polish the words "dragon" [smok] and 
"socialism" start with the same letter "s" is, of course, 
coincidental. As a symbol of our fight, St. George has one 
obvious advantage: According to the Vatican, he never existed 
at all. So no one will be able to accuse us of anticlericalism. 
The principles for which we fight are as follows: freedom, the 
right to own property, and justice. 
  [Szczepula] Do you mean social justice? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Oh, no, anything but that. 
  [Szczepula] But what is the difference between social 
justice and plain justice? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] There are two ways of looking at it. Either 
social justice is the same as plain justice, and then the 
adjective "social" becomes superfluous, or social justice is 
something different from plain justice, which would indicate 
that it is, in fact, injustice. For example, justice would 
dictate that Kowalski be remunerated for his work on the one 
hand and punished for the crime of homicide by hanging on the 
other. In turn, injustice, which is another word for social 
justice, would insist that all of the Kowalskis who earn, say, 
Z1.4 million per month, receive benefits and privileges just 
because they are low-paid. But, among all of these Kowalskis, 
there may be some who try but just cannot earn more and some who 
do not even feel like trying. Justice cannot be collective. 
  [Szczepula] The abortion issue has returned to the Sejm 
again. The ruling coalition intends to take advantage of 
it--for political reasons--in the forthcoming local 
self-government election. UPR is against abortion. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Yes, we are. We believe that there should be 
a clear provision in our legislation stating that the Polish 
state is not in favor of abortion. UPR supports women. We are 
interested in securing a law that will stop men blackmailing 
women by saying: "If you do not have an abortion, I will leave 
you." At present, thanks to the law on protection of the unborn 
child, men find it more difficult to force women to make such 
decisions. In the meantime, life itself has shown that the 
infanticide statistics have not gone up as predicted by 
feminists. Of course, pathological cases do happen still, but 
these have always happened regardless of legislation. 
  Let me make myself clear. We do not propose that women be 
punished for abortion. Definitely not. We recommend that the 
Israeli model be adopted in our practice. In Israel, abortion 
is a punishable offense, but the courts almost never resort to 
making use of the relevant paragraph of the penal code. But 
they still call evil by its name. 
  [Szczepula] Let us turn again to current political issues. 
Most observers would nominate Aleksander Kwasniewski as the 
Left's principal candidate for the office of president. You, on 
the other hand, claim that the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
will officially nominate Jozef Oleksy. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] I am convinced that that is what will happen. 
Mr. Oleksy is simply a more suitable candidate for the function 
of "the father of the nation": He genuflects in churches and 
has a generally winsome personality.... On the other hand, Mr. 
Kwasniewski, with his ladder-climbing feats [reference to 
Kwasniewski's recent attempt at avoiding media attention after a 
major political meeting] is surely a less serious candidate. 
  [Szczepula] Does Oleksy stand a chance? 
  [Korwin-Mikke) He does, provided some disaster occurs--such 
as Mr. Walesa's decision to run in the election. 
  [Szczepula] Would that be a disaster? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Of course, because it could happen that the 
Right's votes will become fragmented, and then both Mr. Walesa 
and Mr. Oleksy will enter the second round of the election. And 
then Mr. Oleksy will be certain to win. 
  [Szczepula] So, will the whole camp representing the former 
democratic opposition mobilize itself and nominate their own 
candidate? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Let us not believe in mirages. But I can 
tell you that UPR does have a candidate--a man from outside all 
of the present political configurations--who is certain to win 
once he agrees to run in the election. 
  [Szczepula] Who is that? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] It is too early for me to tell you. 
  [Szczepula] Is he a well-known figure? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Yes, of course. 
  [Szczepula] Thank you for talking to us.
