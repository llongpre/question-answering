   A massive mudslide closed the main road
to Cedar Breaks National Monument and stripped off a half-mile
section of pavement, and it continued to ooze downhill Monday,
authorities said.
   The slide, roughly half a mile long and half a mile wide, sent
mud and boulders cascading across State Road 14 sometime during the
night and was discovered Monday morning, said Utah Department of
Transportation spokesman Kim Morris.
   No injuries were reported. The highway had been heavily traveled
during the Easter weekend, the Utah Highway Patrol said.
   No one was stranded at the monument because other roads lead
from the monument back to main roads.
   The slide pushed an unoccupied road grader off the road. Morris
said it also blocked a section of Coal Creek, which runs through
the canyon eight miles east of Cedar City, but no serious flooding
was reported.
   The slide continued to move but did not appear to be a threat.
The movement was ``barely perceptible to the eye,'' said Jeff
Tippetts, communications supervisor for the Utah Highway Patrol
office in Cedar City.
   State road crews expected to open a detour around the slide area
Tuesday after plowing snow from two sections of rural roads that
been closed through the winter, Morris said.
   The area received heavy rain and snow during the weekend, said
meteorologist Bill Alder at the National Weather Service in Salt
Lake City.
   It wasn't immediately known if the precipitation triggered the
slide, but Alder said ``that's probably what loosened the soil.''
   A weather gauge at nearby Navajo Lake reported 10 inches of
snow, while Zion National Park, 15 miles to the south, reported
0.54 of an inch of rain, Alder said.
   Cedar Breaks is a natural amphitheater a half-mile deep and two
miles wide, with cliffs eroded into pinnacles and ridges in a
variety of colors. It was named by Mormon pioneers, who called its
rugged topography ``breaks'' and mistook its juniper trees for
cedars.
