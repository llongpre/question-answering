BEYOND THE CULTURE WARS by Gerald Graff W W Norton Pounds 13.95, 244 pages
IN 1985 at Harvard I spent Wednesday mornings at the graduate symposium
denying the existence of authors and texts and Wednesday afternoons teaching
an undergraduate seminar on Melville and the books he wrote. Then, such
schizophrenia could be assuaged by lunch at the Faculty Club. Now, since the
late 1980s, a chasm between theory and practice has opened and become home
to legions of academic settlers.
One of them, Gerald Graff, has written a sane, readable and immensely
stimulating book. Beyond The Culture Wars maps the difficulties which
universities now have in deciding what is to be taught. Old-established
values are challenged, but new ones threaten to fragment the syllabus into
an unwieldy number of subjects.
These disagreements about what should be taught in Humanities faculties
oscillate between extremes. Traditionalists want a collective body of
knowledge to constitute the subject, while radicals want minutely
representative coverage of social and literary diversity, past and present.
Graff's book is an elegant example of the academy outflanking dissent by
making dissent a real subject. Graff calls it 'Teaching the conflicts.'
Beyond The Culture Wars continues a growing tradition of academy watchers.
First was Secretary of State William J. Bennett's 1984 paper 'To Reclaim a
Legacy'; then Allan Bloom's 1987 hit The Closing of the American Mind; the
New York Times and the Washington Post have carried the flame sputtering
into the 1990s. Graff thinks it is time to mediate by meditating.
He makes three observations, born of his experience at Northwestern and
Chicago. First, the curricular malaise results from the communicative
disorders within the academy and between academics and the rest of the
world. Humanists find it risibly easy to see their worst imaginings
realised, and hard enough to understand each other. The Proceedings of the
Modern Language Association (October 1992) offers this: 'Women write from
the breast, with their own fluids for ink . . . the female character puts
the burgeoning male author into an impossible position: he cannot master
what she represents unless he switches gender . . . female metamorphosis
challenges androcentric Bildung.' Que?
Second, Graff tackles the view that the academy is the victim of
multiculturalism. This, George Will claimed (Newsweek, April 22, 1991) is
assaulting 'the common culture that is the nation's social cement.' Why
teach Hawthorne and not Garcia Marquez when 15 per cent of Americans are
Hispanic? Because to cater to minorities meant Black, Korean, Chinese,
Italian and Irish literature on the syllabus; the centre could not hold. In
1984 William Bennett called for 'a clear vision of what is worth knowing and
what is important in our heritage that all educated persons should know.'
Graff highlights the professional dilemma: 'The university is expected to
preserve, transmit and honor our traditions, yet at the same time it is
supposed to produce new knowledge, which means questioning received ideas
and perpetually revising traditional ways of thinking.'
Third, for Graff, nowhere is reading 'innocent'; and since college is not
kindergarten, students should not be sheltered from debates about the
curriculum, but should study them as part of the curriculum. Graff is right
to see debate as a sign of health and longevity.
There have been crises in the humanities before. JH Plumb edited an
excellent 1964 essay collection on the same theme, five years after his
colleague CP Snow's Two Cultures; the tradition goes back to AN Whitehead's
The Aims of Education (1929) and the 1880s science-literature debate between
Matthew Arnold and TH Huxley. In the 19th century, the decline of classics
and in the 18th the rise of science have all altered the shape of the
academy. The academic curriculum derives from political bargaining rather
than commonly shared educational philosophy. Now, under the contraction of
Higher Education funding, there is less, and therefore more, to fight over.
Graff's views work in practice, since discussion benefits from a
juxtaposition or interchange of agenda, and as a teacher it is greater fun
to convene than hector. I evolved a solution to my Harvard dilemma while
teaching at Columbia University in 1989. For a class on Keats' Odes and the
usefulness of the arts I asked students to see Spike Lee's prescient film,
Do The Right Thing, showing that Truth and Beauty are not the only game in
town. It was a thinner solution than lunch at the Faculty Club.
