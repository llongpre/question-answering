<LEADPARA>  AS THE ground war begins in the Persian Gulf, it is increasingly apparent that
President Bush's much-touted "new world order" is not just a gimmick or a
rhetorical flourish but rather the early formulation of a new American foreign
policy doctrine that will provide a framework for U.S. activity around the
globe in the aftermath of the Cold War.;    Largely undebated by leading
Democrats, peace-movement theoreticians or even foreign-policy experts, this
new Bush Doctrine would establish the United States as the world's policeman.  </LEADPARA>

WHAT BUSH DOCTRINE MEANS FOR AVERAGE AMERICAN
FAMILY  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Whether Bush truly envisions a United States acting only in concert with
United Nations authority or whether he intends, as Charles Krauthammer argues,
"unilateral action in multilateral clothing," is yet unclear.;    Either way,
the implications are enormous for the average American family -- from the
potential tax burden to the long-term demand for a large, ready mobile
military force.;    In a world where it is easier to go to war because there
is no nuclear threat, maintaining a military force capable of acting swiftly
and powerfully to contain regional despots could be every bit as costly -- and
even more demanding in terms of manpower -- than the nuclear war-fighting
machine constructed following World War II.;    It is critical then, to open a
wide debate on the future of American foreign policy, and that demands a hard
look at the Bush Doctrine as outlined by the president, Secretary of State
James Baker and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.;    The essential
thoughts in their emerging geopolitical strategy appear to be these:;    1.
The Soviet Union is in disarray, and the Soviet bloc has disintegrated, thus
posing no strategic threat to the United States or the survival of Western
capitalism.;    2. As a result, the theory of containment that underlay U.S.
foreign policy for about 45 years -- demanding the posting of armies in Europe
and Asia, a huge Navy and strategic nuclear arsenal, all aimed at the Soviet
Union -- has outlived its usefulness.;    3. The principal contradiction in
the world today, as Mikhail Gorbachev explained in the 1988 speech to the
United Nations, is between the civilized nations of the world and the problems
of disease, poverty, environmental degradation, terrorism, nuclear danger,
etc.;    4. Only the United States -- the single superpower in the world -- is
economically, politically and militarily capable of enforcing the regional
balances of power that ensure commercial and diplomatic stability.;    5.
Consequently, the United States must be prepared to act as policeman of the
world, but will take military action only where vital interests coincide with
international principle. Or as foreign policy expert Michael Mandelbaum put
it: "We are going to police the high-class neighborhoods and leave the slums
alone.";    Where does Cuba fit in?;  One ironic effect of this line of
reasoning -- which Bush et. al have yet to assimilate -- is that if opposing a
perceived Soviet threat is no longer a cause of action, and the United States
truly intends only to meddle where strategic issues are at stake, then there
is logically no rationale for opposing indigenous socialist revolution in such
places as El Salvador or Nicaragua or maintaining the embargo against Cuba.;  
 Debate over the last watershed in American foreign policy -- the post-World
War II creation of containment theory and its implementation under the Truman
Doctrine -- was stifled by the rampant anti-communism of McCarthyism.;    No
such constraints are upon us today. Yet despite the partial critiques offered
by Democrats from San Nunn to Patricia Schroeder, despite the emotional
argument of the peace movement and the anti-war left, only a few brave souls
have begun to offer an alternate, cohesive vision of foreign policy doctrine
that challenges the Bush Doctrine.;    "It may be out there, but I haven't
seen any foreign policy intellectual treat the new world order as a serious
new vision for American foreign policy to replace containment theory," said
William Schneider of the American Enterprise Institute. "Generally people
think of it as image-mongering. It's not. It is a doctrine.";    There are
rumblings. The recent issue of Foreign Affairs, published by the Council on
Foreign Relations in New York, included three wildly contradictory articles
that begin to analyze the Bush Doctrine. The Defense Monitor, published by the
Center of Defense Information in Washington, recently dedicated an issue to
the topic, "The U.S. and the World's Policeman? Ten Reasons to Find a
Different Role.";    "President Bush's vision of a 'new world order' seems to
mean that the U.S. military's mission is shifting from 'fighting communism' to
capturing drug lords and stopping dictators," the CDI said. "It is shifting
from defending half the world against the other half to defending the entire
world against new 'threats' sometimes identified by the Pentagon simply as
'instability, uncertainty and unpredictability.' ";    'Brave New Gimmick'; 
Nevertheless, the temptation to dismiss Bush's "NWO (pronounced new-wo)," as
it has been dubbed by Washington insiders, remains great. Fred Barnes of The
New Republic, for instance, last week reported that the concept was just a
haphazard creation of a lazy fishing outing of Bush and Scowcroft off the
coast of Kennebunkport, Maine. The article was headlined "Brave New Gimmick.";
   Stronger evidence -- and the mounting war dead -- suggest that Bush, Baker
and Scowcroft ought to be taken seriously.;    It is now becoming clear that
they understood, before most of their critics, that the fall of the Berlin
Wall merely dramatized the need to re-analyze the world. Their old ways of
understanding the great conflicts in the world -- as a titanic struggle
between West and East, between capitalism and communism, between Good and Evil
-- were, to use a Nixonian term, "no longer operative.";    As foreign policy
analyst William Pfaff explains the current context, the collapse of communism
deprived the United States of its "national mission and self-justification."; 
  The country, he wrote recently, "finds itself compelled to reconsider not
only what it must do but, in a significant respect, what it is. The
assumptions that underlie its conduct of foreign relations are poorly adapted
to the changed conditions of international life; but more important, thought
is disoriented.";    Bush, Baker and Scowcroft appear less disoriented than
their critics. They seem to have concluded that where American strategic
interests -- control of 40 percent of the world's oil supply and the balance
of power in the Middle East -- coincide with League of Nations
internationalist ideals of their patrician upbringing, the United States must
act.;    Admitting we were wrong;  In the past, they and their predecessors
fought what were perceived to be instances of Soviet expansionism or creeping
influence -- from Korea to Vietnam to El Salvador. There is ample evidence to
suggest that this was a misguided analysis of the world. Henry Kissinger,
Robert McNamara and others have admitted as much in recent years.
Nevertheless, opposing communism was the rationale that underlay American
foreign policy in virtually every sphere.;    Today, as Krauthammer argues,
the United States is not counterpoised against the Soviet Union. "Now is the
unipolar moment," he wrote recently. "There is but one first-rate power and no
prospect in the immediate future of any power to rival it.";    We have won
the Cold War. Now what?;    "My vision for a new world order foresees a United
Nations with a revitalized peacekeeping function," Bush told the Economic Club
of New York earlier this month.;    But Krauthammer and Pfaff scoff at the
notion that Bush intends to submit to U.N. discipline or direction.;    How
U.N. fits in;  "There is much pious talk about a new multilateral world and
the promise of the United Nations as guarantor of a new post Cold-War order,"
Krauthammer writes. "But this is to mistake cause and effect, the United
States and the United Nations. The United Nations is guarantor of nothing . .
. In the gulf, without the United States leading and prodding, bribing and
blackmailing, no one would have stirred . . .;    "What we have today is
pseudo-multilateralism: a dominant great power acts essentially alone, but,
embarrassed at the idea and still worshipping at the shrine of collective
security, recruits a ship here, a brigade there and blessings all around to
give its unilateral actions a multilateral sheen," he said.;    Adds Pfaff:
"This vision of a new international order led by the United States presumes
that the United Nations' opinions will prove consistent with American opinion,
so that enforcing the U.N. judgments would be acceptable to the American
public.;    "There seems little reason to expect this to be so. . . . For four
decades the United States has opposed U.N. majority opinion on Israel,
terrorism, other matters of Third World interest and on its own policies in
Vietnam, Grenada, Panama and so on.";    Although the president has yet to
clearly articulate his doctrine -- and indeed, it is likely still being
formulated -- it now appears clear that under the Bush Doctrine, the United
States will intervene where what might be called the "strategic peace" is
threatened. In other words, where the United States perceives that it has a
vital interest in maintaining order -- in the Persian Gulf, the Asian
subcontinent and Central America, for example -- Bush is prepared to take
whatever means are necessary to balance power, maintain open markets and halt
expansionism.;    To those who are not comfortable with giving a free hand to
an American government that has proved itself willing to overthrow other
governments to assure its economic and national self-interest, this is a cause
for grave concern. Nor are the "new isolationists" pleased by the implied
disappearance of their much hoped-for "peace dividend.";    Seeking opposing
views;  Yet while they complain about being the world's 911 number, while they
chant "U.S. Out of the Gulf" and other isolationist themes, critics have yet
to spell out a coherent vision of American foreign policy to rival the Bush
Doctrine.;    If there is only one superpower left in the world, what is its
responsibility? Must it be part social worker to the world and part policeman?
If the United States is going to enforce the new world order and if deterrence
of a Soviet threat is no longer justification for action, by what consistent
set of measurements will the country determine that military intervention is
called for?;    Sanctions versus war is a squabble about tactics. What is
called for is a genuine national debate over strategy, over doctrine. Until
they take Bush seriously, until they begin to articulate a new foreign policy
vision in the new world, the peace movement, the Democrats and the critics of
George Bush are not in the real game.  </TEXT>
