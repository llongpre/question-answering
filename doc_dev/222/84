   Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., saying
it wanted more "shelf space" for its television programs in
an increasingly crowded market, is resuscitating its TriStar
Television unit and has purchased some assets of New World
Entertainment Ltd.
   Terms weren't disclosed. Under the agreement, Columbia
Pictures Television would acquire all production and
distribution rights to four shows currently in production.
Two of the series are hardly hits: NBC's "Adventures of Mark
and Brian," the lowest-rated show in prime time, and Fox
Broadcasting Co.'s "Get a Life." The other series, "Boys of
Twilight" for CBS Inc. and "The Brave New World of Charlie
Hoover" are mid-season replacements.

   Two other series produced by New World, "The Wonder Years"
on Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s network and the soap opera
"Santa Barbara" on NBC, a unit of General Electric Co.,
aren't included in the deal.
   Jon Feltheimer, head of Los Angeles-based New World
Entertainment, will become president of TriStar Television,
which will inherit many of the projects already in
development at New World Enterprises, which is owned by New
York financier Ronald Perelman through Andrews Group Inc.
   Columbia said approximately 40 proposed TV series and
movies are in development at New World.
   In an interview, Gary Lieberthal, chairman of Columbia
Pictures Television, said New World was the "first and only
company" Columbia negotiated with. Despite New World's spotty
record in television production, Mr. Lieberthal said Columbia
approached it because "it was the one company we could strike
a deal with on Friday and turn TriStar Television into a
full-blown operation on Monday." The deal was completed in
only four days.
   "We wanted to bring the TriStar logo back into the
television business," said Mr. Lieberthal. Mr. Feltheimer
will report to Mr. Lieberthal.
   In its previous incarnation, TriStar Television, which
folded in 1989 when Columbia was owned by Coca-Cola Co.'s
entertainment unit, produced two mediocre shows: "Werewolf"
on News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting and "My Two Dads" on NBC.
   Columbia Pictures Television currently has seven shows on
the networks: "Designing Women" and "Teech" on CBS, "Who's
the Boss?" "Sibs" and "Baby Talk" on ABC, and "Parker Lewis
Can't Lose" and "Married . . . With Children" on Fox.
