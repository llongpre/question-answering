PLEADING GUILTY
by Scott Turow
Viking Pounds 15.99, 386 pages
IN BRITAIN we have dear old Rumpole and John Mortimer's convivial,
best-selling, TV-mounted intrigues at the Old Bailey. From America we have a
very different kettle of fish - the eruption of a new genre of
lawyer-procedural thrillers.
There have of course been innumerable police-procedurals and private
eye-procedurals and spy-procedurals: the thriller seems to need a bedrock of
expert and ostensibly realistic detail on which to build its fantasies. But
the latest fashion has swept aside all rivals. The best-seller lists on both
sides of the Atlantic have recently been dominated by John Grisham and his
master, Scott Turow.
Both Grisham and Turow are, or were, practising American lawyers. They write
about what they know about, and they are not particularly interested in
writing, that is to say in the precise alignment of words so as to achieve a
higher end than a memorandum. But they are both convinced that their subject
and their expertise - the procedures of the American courtroom and the
investigations that precede those court hearings - are dramatically
compelling. If their sales figures are anything to judge by, they are right.
No doubt they benefit from the American awareness of the drama of the law,
established on the small screen from Perry Mason to LA Law. That is not a
British tradition, where cameras are denied entry to the courtroom.
Scott Turow showed the way with his 1987 novel Presumed Innocent. This
brilliantly-achieved thriller takes off from the extreme detail of the daily
workload of a deputy prosecuting attorney in a Midwest city who is
investigating the murder of a female colleague; suddenly, the hunter becomes
the hunted and finds himself charged with that same murder, a classic
reversal which produces a truly suspenseful denouement and an ingenious
final twist.
Turow followed this three years later with The Burden of Proof (also
available in Penguin paperback) in which he extended the legal thriller into
the murkier areas of the financial world. The plot revolved around
jiggery-pokery in the Futures markets: although not an entirely successful
book, it became an impassioned assault on the nonsenses of this particular
world and was a warning that Turow had messages to put across.
Another lawyer, John Grisham, had meanwhile entered the field. He now has
four books to his name; the best-known is The Firm, currently doing the
rounds as a successful film. Grisham is to Turow like a mere Follett to Le
Carre: Turow can write well when he wishes, Grisham never tries, though both
are good at dialogue (it is startling to observe how rarely Grisham attempts
a descriptive passage). The Firm has an ambitious young lawyer joining a
small Memphis law firm which he discovers to be working for the Mob: his
dilemma is one of conscience.
With The Pelican Brief Grisham discovered, like Turow, that law naturally
interlinks with big business, and in this case with investigative
journalism, Watergate-style. Again, the apparently realistic detail is
all-important, the novelist's traditional skills are discounted. But it
cannot be denied that both these novelists have a superb narrative gift in
the old-fashioned sense that you simply have to keep turning the page. Hence
their well-deserved success.
Turow's latest, Pleading Guilty, is a good example of his qualities and also
of his superiority over Grisham. It is an over-long and complicated story
about a middle-aged lawyer's investigation into the corruption that he
discovers inside his own respectable firm. A partner is on the run; Dollars
5m has been siphoned off to a Yucatan tax shelter; the firm is nervous
because it has secretly made a Dollars 20m profit out of a big air-crash
case; a bookie has been murdered, ball-games have been fixed, the missing
partner turns out to be gay; there is a trio of smooth senior partners, a
tough girlfriend, a tougher black woman in the Accounts Department, a
dangerous cop called Pigeyes, a vivid portrait of the ethnic mix of the
American Midwest.
The higher achievement of Pleading Guilty lies in its portrait of the
protagonist, Mack Malloy (the device of framing the narrative as his
dictation is a mistake, but no matter). Here is a memorably credible
burnt-out case of an ex-policeman, a fading lawyer pushing 50, an alcoholic
still prone to fall off the wagon, a failed husband, a despairing father of
a useless teenager ('Children are savages - egocentric little brutes who by
the age of three master every form of misconduct, including violence, fraud,
and bribery, in order to get what they want. The one who lived in my house
never improved'.)
Malloy is assigned to track down the missing money and his missing
colleague. He is a mess of a man who is trying to behave honourably while
discovering that he is operating in an utterly immoral environment: what is
he to do? Turow, unlike Grisham, is interested in the big issues: 'What kind
of ethical social system takes as its fundamental precepts the words 'I',
'me' and 'mine'?'
The drama at the end is not whether Mack Malloy will find the money but what
he will do with it. Like Grisham, Turow shows us a world of ferocious greed
in which the lawyers (surely unlike our own Rumpole]) are obsessed with
their take. And Turow has a nightmare of a brave new world run by the
multinationals: 'Your corporate types are soon going to be a stateless
superclass, people who live for deals and golf dates and care a lot more
about where you got your MBA than the country you were raised in. It's the
Middle Ages all over again, these little unaffiliated duchies and fiefdoms,
flying their own flags and ready to take on any vassal who will pledge his
life to the manor . . . '
Turow is an ambitious writer and deserves to be read. Grisham is a good
read. They are a phenomenon.
