<TEXT>  Viking, 235 pp., $18.95;  HOW easy it is to see the obvious ways our society
needs improvement, how cheering to imagine a whole new social order -- a world
that would function so smoothly, so equitably, so much like a perfect machine
that even the small gritty human frailties couldn't jam its gears. Utopian
visions and human failings are very much at the center of "Darcy's Utopia,"
and the themes that have run through many of Fay Weldon's 17 previous books of
fiction -- morality, manners, the unpredictable working of fate and, most
notably, the power for good and evil of female intelligence and anger -- reach
an apotheosis in the story of Eleanor Darcy.;    Born in the '60s to an
alcoholic milk-deliverer and malcontent banjo player, raised on some
inhospitable margin where the working class chafes against bohemia, Eleanor
lives a sort of mini-history of the past 30 years in Great Britain. As a '70s
faculty wife, she follows her husband Bernard from earnest academic
Catholicism to more earnest academic Marxism and then down the dreary sinkhole
of the Thatcher years. But Eleanor bobs triumphantly to the surface as the
wife of Julian Darcy, university vice chancellor and brilliant economic
theoretician. Before long, Darcian Utopianism ("the multiracial, unicultural,
secular society the world must aim for if it is to have any hope of a future")
has, at least for one historic day, changed the world, and Eleanor has become,
almost as briefly, a media celebrity.;    The plot advances on multiple
levels, and much of the novel's playfulness derives from its jumps among
subplots. Several of these involve the fact that Eleanor is being interviewed
by two writers. Hugo Vansitart, a cerebral political journalist, is getting an
earful of "Darcian Monetarism," while Valerie Jones, Features Writer of the
Year, endeavors to give Aura magazine's female readers the scoop on what
Eleanor "gives her friends for Christmas." Meanwhile, Valerie and Hugo are
constructing a dream world of their own; after falling madly in love at the
Media Awards dinner, they sequester themselves in a room at the Holiday Inn.
Valerie's dispatches from her love nest alternate with chapters of the
"fictional biography" she has decided to write about Eleanor Darcy.;    All
this is rather less convoluted than it sounds, and immensely entertaining. In
Valerie and Eleanor we have two smart, chatty women with voices bright enough
to sustain the narrative -- even without a generous profusion of event. (There
are hauntings, incest, adultery, bigamy -- the full range of mayhem we have
learned to expect from Weldon.);    Trickier complications arise as we attempt
to follow the roller-coaster logic of Eleanor's social theory. Much of what
she says -- on the tainting effects of money and privilege, the dangers of
fundamentalism, the inadequacy of contemporary education, the insidiousness of
television -- is not only irreverent and subversive, but so irresistibly
sensible that the status quo appears even more needlessly inadequate than one
might have supposed.;    As the novel progresses, however, many Darcian
notions are revealed as decidedly cuckoo. Eventually we realize that we are
meant to take seriously Eleanor's warning that wherever "people are gathered
together in the interests of the better and more humane organization of
society, there the Devil lurks. The greater the striving for good, the nearer
the approach to it, alas, the harder and sharper the fall.";    Fay Weldon is
too sophisticated a writer to ground a novel, without irony, in a utopian
program. Rather, in "Darcy's Utopia," she has given us a barbed, provocative
book infused with admiration for the will to bring about political change, a
belief in its necessity and a prudent suspicion of those who would offer a
Master Plan, a simple panacea for all our societal ills. (box)  </TEXT>
