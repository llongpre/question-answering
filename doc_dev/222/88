   The chairman of Symbion Inc., maker of the Jarvik-7 artificial heart, is resisting a bid for control of the company while other directors remain neutral. 

   Robert Jarvik, co-inventor of the heart and Symbion's chief executive officer, said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that he opposes a bid of $3.50 a share, or about $8.8 million, for 2.5 million Symbion shares by Warburg, Pincus Capital Co. 
In the filing, Dr. Jarvik said the price is too low and the bid should be withdrawn. 
He declined to comment on the filing. 

   In a separate SEC filing, Symbion's board said it won't express an opinion on the bid. 
According to the filing, three of the company's five directors, including Richard Alder, Symbion's president and chief operating officer, decided to remain neutral on the bid. 
Rodman Moorehead III, a Symbion director who works for Warburg Pincus, didn't participate in the decision. 

   Mr. Alder said "only time will tell" what effect the dissension would have on the company, but declined further comment on Dr. Jarvik's filing. 
The other directors couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Dr. Jarvik asserted in his filing that he also disagreed with Symbion's decision to remain neutral because Warburg Pincus has access to material confidential information which can't be made public. 
However, Mr. Alder said "all relevant material has been disclosed." 

   "The difficulty in realistically evaluating the company is the primary reason" the board is remaining neutral, according to the board's SEC filing. 
The directors said the company is still in a development stage, making appraisal difficult. 
However, Symbion said its financial adviser, L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, concluded that the bid is fair to shareholders. 

   Dr. Jarvik said he has entered into a severance agreement with Symbion requiring the company to make certain payments to him if he is fired without cause within two years of a change in control of the company. 
A Warburg Pincus spokesman said the New York-based investment group, which is affiliated with E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co., doesn't plan to change Symbion's management if it gains control. 

   If Warburg Pincus is successful in acquiring the 2.5 million shares, it would control 59.3% of Symbion, which makes artificial organs. 
Warburg Pincus currently holds about 26%. 

   While noting Symbion's "potential high returns," a Warburg Pincus spokesman said the price reflects the "speculative nature and high risks generally associated with development-stage companies." 

   In 1986, Symbion had a net loss of $1.5 million on sales of $7.4 million. 

   The Warburg Pincus spokesman said a predecessor of Warburg Pincus was one of the early venture capitalists for Symbion, and that the predecessor or Warburg Pincus has held a stake in the company since it was founded. 
Of Dr. Jarvik's assertion that the price is too low, he said: "It's pretty clear that is one man's opinion. 
The board doesn't agree with him, and obviously, we don't either." 

   Symbion shares closed yesterday at $3.375, unchanged, in national over-the-counter trading.
