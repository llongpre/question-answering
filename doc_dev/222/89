Sapling number 26, on a windy Welsh hillside, looks deceptively like any
other young alder. With a spindly trunk and only a few leaves it struggles
to survive. Yet it is part of a project which challenges conventional
thinking on land reclamation.
The project, in the heavily-mined Blaenavon area in south Wales, is
experimenting with an ecological approach to reclaiming derelict land -
rather than the traditional approach of employing machinery and civil
engineers. If successful, it could prove applicable not only to Wales, but
around the world.
The idea is to use trees to generate self-sustaining soil in what is now
mostly impermeable clay. The engineering approach currently adopted involves
reshaping land with bulldozers. Channels and drains are created to control
running waters and a thin carpet of soil is added, seeded and fertilised.
The process produces green fields but time shows that such reclaimed land
eventually deteriorates, requiring re-reclaiming at great expense.
The Blaenavon project is the brainchild of Martin Haigh, lecturer at Oxford
Polytechnic and vice-president for the World Association of Soil and Water
Conservation. He has been monitoring the reclaimed mining and industrial
land in Wales for the past 21 years, examining soil erosion, soil evolution
and hydrology. His work has shown that the soil in former mining areas is
dying; shales brought up to the surface by mining break down into clays
which clog up the imported topsoil with water and prevent plant growth.
Green fields of grass become water-logged and replaced by moss and algae,
unsuitable even for grazing. Some mined land in Wales has been devoid of
vegetation for more than 40 years.
Haigh's search for a solution has resulted in a surprising form of east-west
technology transfer - from the environmentally-ravaged eastern bloc to
Britain.
Bulgaria has been experimenting with ecological land reclamation for the
past 50 years to tackle its problems. Research has shown that planting
alders and other trees helps rejuvenate the soil; the tree roots bring in
micro-organisms which create organic material, and that helps build up an
active soil ecosystem which is self-sustaining.
Bulgaria has been forced to adopt such an approach because the country's
best energy reserves lie under prime agricultural land, hundreds of acres of
which are dug up every year. Reclaiming such land is a national priority,
receiving the attention of Bulgaria's best scientists and research
institutes.
In Wales, the long-term future of reclaimed land is a taboo issue for land
reclamation agencies, says Haigh. He has had little encouragement from such
established groups. 'This project is at the forefront of a change in
philosophy in soil reclamation,' he says. Bulgarian experiments found that
ecological reclamation costs one-tenth that of the UK approach because
topsoil is so expensive to buy and transport. But the new method takes 10
times as long because the trees do the work naturally in their own time.
'Cost is important but it's not the whole question, sustainability is,' says
Haigh.
Haigh expects still to be working on his project in another 21 years - his
saplings will take at least 10 years to mature to the point where he can
begin monitoring the soil underneath for changes.
Meanwhile, he relies on funding from a number of organisations. The BOC
Foundation - a company set up by the UK industrial gases group to initiate
and fund research into pollution - has committed Pounds 40,000 over two
years. Earthwatch, the environmental charity, has also committed resources
and manpower. Its 'volunteers', who pay to spend their holidays helping out
on conservation projects, have been working with Haigh, monitoring soil and
sapling growth.
