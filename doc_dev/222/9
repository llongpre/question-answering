THE RISE AND FALL OF THE SWEDISH MODEL by Hans de Geer Carden Publications
Pounds 25, 208 pages
THE Swedish Model seduced the outside world for a long time. For many
overseas admirers the paradigm of the good society - rational, efficient,
progressive - to its enemies it was Aldous Huxley's Brave New World of
stifling conformity and well-meaning authoritarianism.
Swedes themselves saw the Model less as an abstraction or prototype and more
as a way of life in which a dynamic free market economy coexisted
harmoniously with a huge and generous public sector based on high taxes.
This corporatist system worked impressively for nearly 30 years and helped
make Sweden one of the world's most prosperous economies.
Today the Model appears to be drowning beneath the stormy waves of global
recession. Sweden's mounting unemployment, its huge foreign debt and
economic stagnation have combined to undermine faith in the country's
exceptionalism. Now it is having to adjust painfully to outside pressures
with its social and economic integration into western Europe.
But adapt it will. The value of Hans de Geer's book lies in its focus on a
neglected part of the Model, namely its dependence on the active role of SAF
 -The Swedish Employers' Federation. Without the consent of capital it is
difficult to see how the Model could ever have grown to maturity.
Formed in 1902 in reaction to the rise of the LO manual worker union
federation, SAF grew rapidly into a formidable association. With centralised
sanctions over its disparate members and a firm commitment to the absolute
right of employers to manage, it established a common fund to fight strikes
and impose lock-outs. But SAF was never really an anti-union organisation.
On the contrary - as De Geer shows - it agreed to recognise trade unions and
collective agreements from its early days, while in return the trade unions
gave up the principle of the closed shop.
Sweden's industrial consensus was never a flabby middle way but a
hard-headed bargain between capital and labour on their mutual
self-interests. While SAF wanted 'unchanging labour costs' out of it, the LO
favoured solidaristic deals based on wage equality. As the author
emphasises, it was not until the mid-1950s that the central bargaining
system emerged. Over the following 15 years SAF and LO often toured the
world together selling the virtues of the Model they created.
But by the end of the 1960s Sweden's Labour Movement had launched a
workplace reform programme based on legislation, not negotiation, that
brought an end to employer prerogatives, while the rapid growth of the
public sector and arrival of an organised white-collar salariat weakened the
symmetry of SAF-LO bargaining. Wage drift undermined national pay deals and
labour costs grew uncompetitive.
The strain this imposed on SAF was considerable. It brought a clear
ideological shift with a more robust defence of free markets. In more recent
years SAF began to shed its corporatist ways and champion decentralised pay
bargaining. Its leaders talk more boldly today than they used to do about
competition and private enterprise.
But this is all a matter of degree. What de Geer calls Sweden's 'negotiation
culture' remains intact beneath the surface of its industrial life. The
power balance has shifted more towards employers and away from unions, but
not dramatically so. As the book makes clear, continuity remains as strong
as change in Sweden. The Model may after all just be having a face lift.
