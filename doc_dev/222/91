<LEADPARA>  LAST AUGUST, when the war debate on the right was raging, I wrote, "It is time
we put our cards on the table. The war for which the neo-cons pant has
quagmire written all over it." From the new world order desk at National
Review came the clever riposte: A quagmire in the desert would violate all
"meteorological precedent.";    Har, har, har.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Commentary
Patrick J. Buchanan is a nationally syndicated columnist.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In the latest NR, John O'Sullivan writes: "Saddam back in power, thirsting
for revenge, vast refugee camps in neighboring states, anti-government
enclaves inside Iraq protected by Western troops -- welcome to the quagmire."
Hopefully, Editor O'Sullivan can be persuaded to keynote the next "Second
Thoughts" conference.;    Belatedly, George Bush did the right thing in
sending U.S. troops to help the famished and dying Kurds. But, so doing, he
has put us into the middle of an ancient ethnic quarrel, extrication from
which is likely to be neither easy nor soon nor bloodless.;    Clearly the
president did not anticipate the vast tragedy -- millions of fleeing,
starving, dying Kurds and Shiites -- that his war and his bellicose call on
the Iraqi people to take arms and oust Saddam Hussein would cause. But America
will bear a permanent stain for having let Saddam slaughter these people with
impunity as the statesmen of Desert Storm wrung their hands and pleaded lack
of U.N. sanction to interfere with the massive blood-letting our own call to
arms had unleashed.;    Where previously Bush had sounded like Churchill with
his anti-Hitler rhetoric, in those three weeks, our leaders sounded like
petty-fogging shysters in Municipal Court insisting to the judge their client
had never used those exact words -- and hence no verbal contract with the
Kurds had ever existed.;    None of the above detracts from the brilliance of
U.S. generalship, or the professionalism and bravery of U.S. troops who
flawlessly executed the war plan, and are coming home to deserved heroes'
welcome.;    But, it is time to look at the other side of the balance sheet.; 
  Yes, we liberated half a million Kuwaitis, and restored the emir to his
throne, but consider the cost:;    A hundred thousand pathetic Iraqi
conscripts are dead; tens of thousands of civilians may have perished in our
bombing; thousands of Shiite and Kurdish rebels have been massacred. Two
million refugees are on the move, dying of famine, exposure and disease. Iraq
has been bombed back to a "pre-industrial age.";    In the great Arab city of
Baghdad, electricity has been off for months; sewage is backed up in the
streets; old men, women and children are drawing water from gutters, mud
puddles and polluted rivers. Cholera and dysentery are rampant. And the allied
blockade remains in place.;    The half million Iraqi children who now have no
fathers -- will they grow up to love the America that broke up their families,
destroyed their country, and left them to Saddam Hussein?;    What is going on
in Iraq is what went on in Germany after World War I -- when the British
tightened their hunger blockade to force Berlin to admit total war guilt at
Versailles. Out of those broken German families, from those malnourished
children who saw brothers and sisters die of starvation and disease, mothers
selling themselves to buy milk, came the most fanatic of Hitler's followers
who would one day throw the British off the continent at Dunkirk.;    Those to
whom evil is done do evil in return.;    Defending his decision to go to war,
President Bush invoked the just war theory of St. Augustine. But one of the
requirements for a just war is proportionality. One cannot kill the family of
a thief to retrieve a stolen wallet. One cannot kill a thousand innocent
people to liberate a hundred from a despot.;    In Kuwait today, our beloved
emir is polishing his chandeliers, as the uniformed heroes of the Kuwaiti
resistance wait outside Catholic churches to grab Filipino girls after Mass to
rape them. A "rape epidemic" is under way, says the Washington Times.;    The
president was rightly sickened by reports of what Iraqi troops did to
Kuwaitis. But why are we not protesting what the emir's bully boys are doing
to Asians and Palestinians?;    Excuse me, but these Kuwaiti plutocrats owe
us. Why doesn't Bush send his ambassador to the palace, and tell the emir to
get his heroes under control or get the hell out?;    Once again, after a
"good war," a terrible aftermath.;    This war, the president said, will bring
"stability and security" to the gulf; it will usher in a brave new world order
that our critics simply lack the vision to see.;    Well, where is the
security and stability? Where is the order?;    Kuwait is a blazing pyre of
ruined oil wells, its worst elements raping at will in Kuwait City. Iraq, a
modern nation of 18 million, is a wasteland of civil war, terror, famine,
disease and death. Jordan is now a slum. The Palestinians have lost
everything, even hope. Yitzhak Shamir and Ariel Sharon are turning the West
Bank into a trailer park for the crazies of Gush Emunim, a messianic Jewish
settlement movement. And thousands of U.S. troops are moving into Kurdish
regions of Iraq, temporarily, you understand, until "something can be worked
out.";    And we are only six weeks into the postwar.;    As I said, this
thing "has quagmire written all over it."  </TEXT>
