Ground''</HEAD>

   President Bush, responding to criticism of his
global warming policy, told an international conference Wednesday
he has ``never considered research a substitute for action.''
   The president's remarks at the close of the 18-nation White
House conference were warmly received by many of the same delegates
who a day earlier criticized the administration for failing to deal
directly with global warming.
   ``We came here to find common ground and we've found common
ground _ that research and action are inseparable,'' Padraig Flynn,
environnment minister from Ireland and an official of the European
Community, told reporters.
   Bush opened the conference Tuesday saying more research is
needed before costly programs are set up to fight global warming.
But he closed the conference by challenging his critics _ many of
them European delegates and environmentalists observing the
conference _ over global warming.
   He said the United States is ``leading the search for response
strategies and working through the uncertainty of both the science
and the economics of climate change.''
   ``But there is one area where we will allow for no uncertainty,
and that is our commitment to action, to sound analysis and sound
policies,'' he said.
   ``Above all the climate change debate is not about `research
versus action' for we have never considered research a substitute
for action,'' Bush told the senior government officials from around
the world.
   ``To those who suggest we're only trying to balance economic
growth and environmental protection, I say they miss the point,''
Bush said. ``We are calling for an entirely new way of thinking, to
achieve both while compromising neither.'
   The two-day conference was marked by discord over whether there
should be specific commitments to reduce so-called greenhouse
pollutants, especially carbon dioxide. The United States maintained
the conference was aimed at focusing on the need for additional
research into global warming and its economic impact, not on
developing action plans.
   But after Bush's remarks, many of the European delegates
expressed hope that the U.S. position emphasizing research had
shifted closer to their own views: that industrial nations along
must reduce the manmade pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, which
scientists fear are causing a warming of the Earth.
   Hans Alders, the Dutch environment minister and one of the
strongest critics of the U.S. policy, said he was heartened by
Bush's closing remarks.
   ``At the beginning, there were remarks only about the need for
more scientific research and economic knowledge,'' said Alders.
``Now you get the impression he is saying we need action now and we
need more information. And I agree with that.''
   Rafe Pomerance, an environmentalist observing the conference for
the World Resources Institute, said the administration ``got a very
strong message from the European governments.''
   Senior administration officials called the two-day conference a
success because it allowed a frank exchange of ideas on the
scientific uncertainties about global warming and the question of
economic cost of both action and inaction was discussed.
   But disputes over the narrow focus of the conference agenda and
other matters prevented agreement on a conference summary report
and left a U.S. proposal for an ambitious international research
effort, including creation of a special institute for global
warming, not even considered.
   A draft of the U.S. proposal was briefly circulated Wednesday
morning, but then quickly withdrawn when it raised the ire of many
of the delegates. Michael Deland, chairman of the president's
Council on Environmental Quality and a conference co-chairman, said
the document was distributed by mistake.
   ``That was a complete misunderstanding,'' said Allan Bromley,
the president's science adviser and another conference co-chairman.
But Bromley prior to the conference had said the United States had
hoped such a proposal would win the endorsement of the conference.
