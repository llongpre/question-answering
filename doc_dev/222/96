<F P=106> [Article by V.P. Bhatia: "From Arm-Twisting to Leg-Twisting </F>
of India Over Kashmir"] 
  [Text] In his The Story of Philosophy, rated as 
"one of the best loved works of our time", the celebrated 
American author Will Durant relates the following incident from 
the life of a Roman philosopher Epictetus as a classic example 
of stoicism or quiet acceptance of pain and defeat as one's 
pre-ordained lot in life: "Story has it that Epictetus' master, 
who treated him with consistent cruelty, one day took to 
twisting Epictetus' leg to pass the time away. `If you go on', 
said Epictetus calmly, `you will break my leg'. But the master 
went on, and the leg was broken. `Did I not tell you', said 
Epictetus mildly, "that you would break my leg?" And that was 
the end of the matter. [quotation marks as published] 
  It is some such sort of mystic philosophy of tolerance, we 
are told by historians, that the Hindus had been practising in 
medieval times to survive the Islamic onslaught. And it is again 
some such sort of secular philosophy of surrender to Islamic 
subversion and crossborder terrorism that the nation is being 
advised to put up with in order to prove our civilisational 
superiority to Islamic theo-political offensive again so that 
our rulers can enjoy the fruits of freedom in undisturbed calm 
even while bartering away vital national interests at every step. 
  However, to cover up rank cowardice, mealy-mouthed sermons 
are delivered to the nation, reminding one of a heartless 
judge's advice to rape-victims that when they can't do anything 
about rape, it is better to relax and enjoy it! 
  No wonder, as the self-serving secular hypocrisy strikes 
more 
and more weird poses of servility, Pakistan's arm-twisting of 
India turns to leg-twisting. As the wager of Islamic 
jehad is fully backed and encouraged by its 
patron-in-chief with a new cowboy, Bill Clinton, in White House, 
the proxy war threatens to take the shape of an atomic holocaust 
of India unless the secularists offer the whole of Kashmir on a 
platter to propitiate the Islamic Moloch. It is another matter 
that the people of India are still quite capable of facing the 
multiple threats. 
  Obviously and no Government even offers to surrender Kashmir 
unless bent on hara-kiri. But then you can bank on 
secularists to devise new foxy ways of covering up surrender 
under grandiose terms like "autonomy" and "self-administration", 
as the secular opinion-makers and writers mount a surreptitious 
pro-Paki and pro-American campaign for "timely solution" of 
Kashmir problem to avoid disintegration of India, although such 
a "solution" would hasten disintegration. 
  So we are told by Kuldip Nayar in his column in THE 
STATESMAN 
(December 29, 1993): Fortunately there is a sea-change in Indian 
opinion. Whether it is because of unending militancy or the 
growing feeling that force is no solution to people's 
alienation, the climate in India is in favour of making 
concessions provided it does not mean the secession of the 
Valley. There is also the realisation that the country cannot 
progress without peace in the continent." [quotation marks as 
published] 
  The so-called opinion-makers are obviously happy that the 
secular gangs have successfully alienated the Kashmiris and now 
urge de facto "Azadi" for them. After expulsion of all Hindus 
they are all for creating a new Islamic nation. So why not cut 
the head to get rid of the chronic headache. 
  This reminds one of Urdu poet Ghalib's oft-quoted verse: 
  Ab to ghabra ke yeh kehtay hai ke mar jayen ge, Mar ke bhi 
chain na paya to kidhar jayen ge. 
  -- That is, "In a fit of life's frustrations, we yearn to 
seek escape in death, but where shall we go if even death does 
not bring the coveted peace." 
  So what if even a constitutional regression in Kashmir from 
the quasi-independent status of Article 370 to semi-independent 
status of Nehru-Abdullah agreement of 1952 or three-subject 
accession of October 1947 does not prove to be the final 
solution? What if the crusaders continue the battle for full 
Islamic independence and accession to Pakistan of which there 
should be no doubt if one remembers what even Nehru had said 
that Kashmir is only a symptom of Pakistan's religious disease 
and it will find some other pretext to badger India if it gets 
it on a platter. Even Kuldip Nayar has reported in his book 
Distant Neighbours, that Hate India is the very basic 
creed of Pakistan and superiority of Islam and hatred of Hindus 
as kafirs the very sheet anchor of its existence. 
  However, just now the stand of the worshippers of terrorist 
force and opinion-makers like Nayar that "climate in India is 
favourable for making concessions" because of "unending 
militancy" is no different from Bhutto Government's at the 
recent Indo-Pakistan talks in Islamabad that India should 
"swallow the bitter pill" of secession of Kashmir because of 
"changed ground realities" -- changed by the Pakistan-directed 
proxy war, of course. The only difference between two stands is 
that while Pakistan wants to amputate the leg, the Indian 
secularists would like to keep it dangling to the Indian body 
after breaking it. 
  Many would however call it head-hunting if you remember that 
Kashmir is always projected as the head of Bharat Mata. 
Meanwhile, the progress of arm-twisting to leg-twisting to 
head-hunting by Pakistan and its American godfathers forms a 
great success story of Nehruvian secularism, which though a 
totally failed remedy, is being administered with ever bigger 
doses to the sick nation. 
  There is much song and dance, meanwhile, that China has 
changed its stand of all-out support to Pakistan on Kashmir 
issue whereas fact is China is against only the third option of 
independent status of Kashmir as it would become an American 
base against it, otherwise it has forged even stronger defence 
ties with Pakistan to checkmate India. Besides supplying 
missiles, it has pushed lakhs of AK-47 rifles at damn cheap 
rates for terrorists' use in the region. Clinton's controversial 
letter to Ghulam Nabi Fai, President of a pro-militant and 
pro-Pakistan Kashmiri outfit of USA, is no less significant as 
it makes the American stand all the more a pro-Pakistan. So now 
you may hear more hue and cry on Plebiscite and 
self-determination even in UNO. 
  However, the real solution of the problem still lies in the 
hands of India, only if it sheds the secular blinkers. There 
will be no respite to it unless it learns to look grim realities 
in the face. The back of secessionist militancy has to be broken 
swiftly and ruthlessly, even as Pakistan did in Baluchistan even 
by bombing of rebel areas. But the pity is that the Centre goes 
about everything touching Muslim intransigence in a 
circumlocutory and dilatory fashion, painfully prolonging the 
agony of everybody by avoiding the hammer-stroke of determined 
army action, without political interference. 
  What is needed is a clear signal to Pakistan that it would 
destroy itself if it insists on annexing Kashmir. For 
Kashmir-fixation is bound to spell the destruction of Pakistan, 
whatever the price India has to pay for its nuclear toys. A dire 
signal is also needed for Kashmiri politicians to agree to full 
integration by abrogation of Article 370 or face imposition of 
Union Territory status for the valley and merger of the rest of 
the state to Punjab and Himachal. In any case, militancy in the 
state is kept alive as much by Pakistan as by the pampered 
crypto Pakistanis of the valley. This phoney secularism needs to 
be unmasked and secessionism punished instead of being rewarded 
with massive bribes. 
  In any case, people of India will never accept what Kuldip 
Nayar dubs as public opinion but is really the official opinion. 
India has to stop behaving as "a poorman's wife who is the 
common property of all neighbours". For that is the unenviable 
status "progressively" achieved by India since the leftist 
inspired Chinese aggression of 1962. The outraged nation's 
long-oppressed spirits are waiting to be uplifted with a 
cataclysmic fury. There are enough silver-linings in the dark 
clouds. 
  Till then, Pakistan's spirits are hugely uplifted by the 
Dutch courage of its nuclear toys. 
  Meanwhile, Pakistan's notorious secret agency ISI is 
operating freely from our territory, treating the whole of India 
right up to Assam and other states in the North-east as its 
happy hunting ground and creating secure bases in all big cities 
to set off new serial blasts. Using even Bangladesh and Nepal 
and maybe Sri Lanka also, it has given the latest signal of its 
omnipresence from Hyderabad in the south where a big gang 
engaged in another dangerous plot, a foretaste of which was 
given by five train explosions on December 6 last, the first 
anniversary of Ayodhya demolition, is said to have been busted 
by Indian intelligence. 
  Meanwhile, despite all hue and cry about ISI's [Pakistani 
Intelligence Service] hand in the last March's mayhem in Bombay, 
Pakistan is not the least harmed or bothered about our impotent 
rage. On the other hand, it accuses our own politicians of being 
hand in glove with the arch culprits, Dawood and Memon brothers 
who are alleged to have been allowed to escape soon after the 
car bomb blasts of which clear hints were available by unusual 
activity on the preceding night. So like Dogberry and Verges, 
the classic models of stupid policemen in Shakespeare's 
Much Ado About Nothing, the Congress regime seems to 
be happy to be rid of the botheration of arresting the villains 
of the piece. While the suspicious of politician-mafia nexus is 
strengthened by the Sharad Pawar-Chavan tussle over the handing 
over of the whole enquiry to the centre, the sense of relief 
over the villains' timely exit seems to be palpable. It is such 
stuff that Indian secularism is made of. 
  No wonder, the Pakistanis, apart from our own 
crypto-Pakistanis are the most ardent admirers of our 
self-defeating secularism. A Pakistani editor actually expressed 
surprise over this strange phenomenon. Perhaps he did not know 
how the visiting Mohajirs themselves have been feeling green 
with jealousy at the licence enjoyed by their co-religionists 
whose leaders never tire of wailing about genocide of Muslims in 
India even while claiming five to eight-fold increase in their 
population since independence as against three-fold increase in 
general. They also have reason to gloat over the ethnic purge of 
Hindus from Kashmir even while welcoming massive infiltration 
from Bangladesh to inflate their vote-bank. 
  Meanwhile, to frighten the Hindu population in general and 
pseudo-secularists they keep threatening the Bosaniasation of 
the whole of India by communal flareups, bomb-blasts, terrorist 
violence on the plea that the Muslim youth was getting impatient 
of constitutional ways. 
  No wonder, the hard-pressed Hindus administered a shock 
therapy by way of demolition of the Islamic imperialist totem at 
Ayodhya. More shocks treatments may follow as a logical 
corollary if the Islamic sins go on piling up further with 
secular connivance. Their BSP-SP [Bahujan Samaj Party-Samajwadi 
Party] Trojan horses are unlikely to help them as the Hindu 
psyche is basically the same in this matter among the backwards, 
forwards and the Dalits. 
  No wonder, even intellectual giants like V. S. Naipaul and 
Nirad Chaudhuri have welcomed it as a Hindu mass upsurge. This 
reminds one of Huxley's description of D. H. Lawrence's attack 
on conventional morality in Lady Chatterley's Lover 
as shock treatment. The hue and cry raised over it, said Huxley, 
showed that it had successfully gone home. So, he urged more and 
more such shocks so that now we find no modern novel respectable 
without fierce attacks on "Grundyism". 
  Thus it is that the Hindu temperature rises as Islamic 
votebank is relentlessly propitiated and appeased with ever new 
baits despite a clear writing on the wall about its 
fundamentalist mission. And again, thus it is that every 
Pakistani blackmail and breach of diplomatic norms is swallowed 
as mother's milk by our philosopher-kings despite open 
declarations of Jehad not only to annex Kashmir but 
to terrorise and blow-up the rest of India. For, to finish the 
unfinished business of partition, is their openly proclaimed 
aim. And as co-fathers and creators of the Islamic state of 
Pakistan, with touching paternal love for its stability and 
welfare, our Congress rulers treat even its most dangerous moves 
as no worse than the pranks of a spoilt child.
