   Willard and others preoccupied with the future think that small
wars are more likely than big wars in the next century. They think
that terrorists from the countless ranks of the have-nots are more
apt to create world tension than the major powers; that hunger is
more likely to bring war than ideology.
   For most other people, bursting technology will provide a new
world in the new century. According to Marvin Cetron, Arthur C.
Clarke, John Diebold, Isaac Asimov and other diviners of the future
in fact and fiction, we may expect...
   Homes and places of work will be computerized, robotized and, if
we're not careful, completely homogenized. Automated housekeepers
will heat, cool, ventilate, dust, vacuum, wash and take out the
garbage at the press of a button or voice command. Mood makers will
provide music, wind noises, thunder cracks and filmed images on the
wall of a crackling fire, falling snow or pelting rain.
   Appliances will hear and, unless choked, talk. At the moment,
though, in this century, talking machines are not selling. Buyer
resistance.
   ``My husband talks back to me,'' said one shopper. ``My kids talk
back to me. I don't want my dryer talking back to me.''
   Designers, however, are not giving up. They think the next
generation of consumers, now growing up with talking computers in
school, will be less intimidated by babbling machines.
   With small high-speed computers for brains, with TV cameras for
eyes, hydraulic manipulators for arms and grippers for hands, robots
will take over much of the heavy, dangerous or dull work now
performed by men and women. They already hobnob with radioactive
reactors, visit the bottoms of deep mine shafts, explore ocean
bottoms and defuse explosives.
   Homo mechanicus also paints, welds, grinds, mills, cuts, runs a
lathe and drill press, works on appliances, autos and planes without
a coffee break, says Cetron. A robot now in the works will be able
to return wrenches scattered on a workbench to a rack on the wall.
   Japan now leads the world in the production of robots. One of the
latest from Nippon is called King Kong. lt picks up a hospital
patient, places him or her in the bathtub and then returns him-her
to bed freshly bathed.
   It is hard to picture more national change than our century
produced. Nations rose and fell, disappeared and reappeared. Empires
and ideologies spread and shrank.
   But change there will be. By 2100, the population of the world is
expected to double from 4.9 billion to 10.4 billion. The poorest
nations will have the most people, in Africa, Asia and Latin
America, and the richest will have a hard time enjoying their dinner.
   The developed countries will drop from a quarter to a seventh
share of the world population. The United States will drop from
fourth to seventh in population rank, behind India, China, Nigeria,
the Soviet Union, Indonesia and Pakistan. The U.S. share of
something called the gross world product will drop from 22 percent
to 10 percent but, at that, the United States and Japan will have
the largest slices.
   Following cheaper labor, not the sun, the Hong Kong shirt-maker,
who took business away from the United States and Europe, will lose
it to the Mexicans and Thais, who will then lose it to the
Bangladeshi and Egyptians. So says Marvin Cetron.
   Economically, the center of gravity of ``Western civilization''
will shift from the United States and Europe to the United States
and the Pacific. U.S. trade with Asia will double that with Europe.
Stripped of empire, Europe's share of world commerce has already
shrunk to a fraction of what it was in 1900.
   In the quickening march of medicine and science, we are told, the
blind will see better, paraplegics will step from their wheelchairs,
new drugs will dissolve blood clots, and prevent or reduce heart
disease, ulcers, cholesterol buildup, hardening of the arteries,
hepatitis and some forms of cancer.
   Human tissue ``farms'' will provide everything from single cells
to lungs and hearts, and transplants will become as common as
tonsillectomies. Unless stopped, gene tinkerers will slow down the
aging process and make possible blond, blue-eyed babies on demand.
   ln that brave new world, with controlled drugs and hormonal
manipulation, basketball players will be 6 inches taller and baskets
will have to be raised; baseball pitchers will throw harder, batters
will hit longer and outfield fences will have to be moved back,
maybe as much as 100 feet.
