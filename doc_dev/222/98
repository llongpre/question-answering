<LEADPARA>  IN THE village of Ruan Lenihorne, we met an old Cornishman sawing tree limbs.
He gave tourniquet handshakes all around while explaining that he was cutting
pieces of hazel. He would fashion the hazel into walking sticks he would later
sell.;   "Holly is the best and ash is more flexible," he said, kneeling back
to his task, "but this hazel is good. And the best walking sticks are cut
right here," he said, leaning back to show us, "where the root meets the
ground. It makes a lovely handle."  </LEADPARA>

WALKING IS AS MUCH OF A TRADITION AS AFTERNOON

A WALK IN CORNWALL  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     He refused to sell us any sticks, because they still needed numerous coats
of varnish before they would be "proper" -- although, he sniffed, there are
those who would sell such unfinished goods. Indeed, he said, there are so many
walking-stick makers in Cornwall that most of the trees are claimed and marked
off in advance.;   There are shops in England that sell only walking sticks,
because walking is the English national pastime, having supplanted fishing,
according to a recent survey. It is a nation with about 100,000 miles of
public rights-of-way -- footpaths, bridle paths and byways that traverse
hills, mountains, farmlands, seaside and fields. Many of these walkways are
ancient public paths blazed long before the invention of the automobile.;  
Walking became popular in England after World War I as residents sought an
inexpensive refuge from the grime of the Industrial Revolution. And today
walking is still as much a part of English life as afternoon tea. The
government estimates that 38 percent of the population, or about 21 million
people, walk in the countryside regularly.;   Among the most avid British
walkers is Chris Hague of the Wayfarers, one of several companies that offer
organized walks through the English countryside. Hague gave up a career as a
commercial artist in 1983 to become a professional walker. "I've walked all my
life," he said, "and now I'm making a living doing what I've always dreamed of
doing.";   Under Hague's guidance, our walking group learned what the Britons
already know: The best way to see the countryside is on foot. We spent five
days walking in Cornwall along the Coastal Path, a 562-mile national trail
around England's western peninsula. Routes off the Coastal Path would take us
into the interior.;   Cornwall is well-suited for walking because it offers a
varied topography and is isolated. It is the tail of England, at the southwest
tip, aloof and detached -- a rocky claw thrusting out into the Atlantic. "You
won't see any bus loads of tourists here," said Hague, referring to the
southern coast of Cornwall. "Americans who want to see one pretty village
after another usually go walking in the Cotswolds (200 miles northeast).
There's really not much to do in this part of Cornwall but walk and sail.";  
Hague, who looks to be in his 30s but is 51, described these assets of a
Cornwall walk when we began our tour in Truro. The nine who joined Hague for
the walk in Cornwall included my wife, Susan, and me; two couples from
Baltimore; two Chicago women (a teacher and a computer programmer) and a
retired electronics executive from the Isle of Guernsey.;    Fields, farms,
cliffs, coves;   Although we never ventured more than 50 miles from our
starting point over the next five days, we saw a lot of Cornwall. We walked
through villages steeped in medievalism, across fields, along beaches, down
cliffs, up grassy hills dotted with sheep and cows, along sandy coves, past
lone farms in the center of high-walled fields and through forests thick with
legends. It was here in Cornwall that Tennyson chased King Arthur's legend and
wrote of "wind-hollowed heights and gusty bays.";   In pretty villages we
learned about the long Cornish history of superstition and magic spells. Along
the estuaries and little coves that followed the coastline we would hear tales
of smuggling, pirates and shipwrecks. While the natural elements caused
thousands of shipwrecks, the Cornish, it seems, had a hand in more than a few
of these disasters. The locals would set beacons on cliffs over the rocks and
feast on the leavings of the dying vessels.;   Of course, that is history; the
Cornish people today are friendly and eager to talk about the past. And one
can easily and safely walk around Cornwall (and other parts of England)
without guidance. But there are several advantages of organized walks.
Logistical problems of luggage, accommodations and restaurants are handled for
you. And you have the benefit of experts such as Hague in selecting the
routes. This leaves the visitor free to savor the walk.;   Pub dining;  
Between walks, we took morning coffee, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner at pubs
and restaurants in towns that were never far from the sea and with
distinctively Cornish names such as Philleigh, Trewortha, Gerrans, Veryan,
Portloe, Portscatho, Mevagissey and Bohortha.;   Every day we walked about 10
miles. We carried only small backpacks for sweaters, rain gear, water bottles,
cameras, maps and other necessities. Twice a day, Malle Adkins, the walk
manager, rendezvoused with us to offer refreshments and a ride in the
Wayfarers' station wagon for anyone who was tired, blistered or otherwise
indisposed. She also transported our luggage to the next night's lodging.;  
Our accommodations were at village inns that were family owned and tended. The
rooms were neat, clean and modest, and you had the feeling of staying at
someone's house rather than a hotel. Each inn had a lively pub where we met
Cornish villagers who were unaccustomed to talking to Americans and who
grilled us about our lifestyles, politics, even NFL football.;   Sleep came
early and easily, and each morning we awoke ready for a new adventure. Along
our walks we chatted with shepherds, refuse collectors, schoolteachers and
assorted eccentrics and amiable bucolics. At the village of St. Mawes, a
worker was painstakingly thatching the roof of a cottage. We yelled up and
asked him how long it would take him. "I don't know, but when I'm finished it
will last 30 years.";   More often we found ourselves in the company of only
each other as we walked the cliffs, ablaze in yellow gorse, high above the
English Channel.;   It was on these walks that Hague and his nine amateur
clients engaged in an exchange of walking lore that would go on all week.;  
For instance, the leg muscles are the largest and most powerful muscles in the
human body. Hippocrates prescribed walking for nearly everything, and walking
was Freud's personal route to mental health. Albert Einstein ranged for miles
and miles through the pretty countryside around Princeton. And much of English
literature was shaped by such prodigious walkers as Wordsworth, Carlyle,
Shakespeare, Jonson, Keats, Stevenson and Dickens.;   Local residents added to
our cache of information, as on the day we detoured from the Coastal Path down
the steep trail to the fishing village of Portloe. At the old Lugger Hotel,
the barmaid expertly downshifted a foam-free pint of bitter and told us that
when Percy and Mary Shelley eloped, they walked the first 100 miles. In
exchange we told her that Aldous Huxley once was stopped and questioned by Los
Angeles police because he was out walking at night.;   But as we walked across
a farm field, rife with the odor of earth and cattle, we found that there are
problems of a different kind walking in England. Hague said that walking
enthusiasts were constantly battling attempts to restrict walking rights along
public paths.;   "There are running disputes between the walkers and certain
individuals who would like us to go away, like farmers, moorland owners and
water officials worried about pollution," Hague said. "We are constantly
taking landowners to court to force them to open rights of way, and there are
a lot of petty harassments. Occasionally, a farmer will dump a load of manure
right in front of his gate." But we never encountered such opposition on our
treks off the Coastal Path.;   Fifteen minutes from the roar of the sea, the
sounds became bovine, porcine, equine. The hogs were indifferent to this
strange group of two-legged walkers, the horses almost friendly, the young
bulls downright curious.;   Then the countryside gave way to thatched-roof
villages such as Veryan, with church steeples jutting into the sky like
admonishing fingers, and cemeteries with tombstones jockeyed by the frosts of
a hundred or more winters. We wondered about Veryan's round houses and then
learned they were so designed because their 19th-century architects believed
that if there were no corners there would be no place for the devil to hide.; 
 Veryan, like most of the villages, is so small that entering and leaving
amounted to almost the same thing; soon we'd be in a pasture again within
earshot of the channel waves pounding the shore.;   Back on the Coastal Path,
we might see a dozen or more black gulls holding an important meeting on a
foam-flecked rock, each one earnestly seeking the attention of the chair. A
half-hour later, we were climbing over yet another stile, a set of steps over
a farmer's fence or wall.;   With this rhythm of landscape, we fell into a
pleasant dailiness. It began with a full English breakfast (juice, cereal,
eggs, toast, grilled tomatoes, bacon, sausage and kippers) about 8, walking
from about 9 to 12:30. We'd stop for a leisurely pub meal (perhaps a plowman's
lunch of cheese, ham and bread) and then walk till about 4. Then it was rest
and recuperation until 7, and a long, voluble dinner followed by conversation
and reflections on the day's walk while the fire crackled in the hearth.;   We
met some delightful people on our walks. One day, Hague led us down a dirt
lane near Portscatho to a farmhouse and the beckoning odor of warm scones. In
Cornwall scones come not only with jam and marmalade, but also with clotted
cream. Jean Curd -- she swore that was her name -- poured steaming cups of
Earl Grey and explained how she makes clotted cream.;   "You let the milk
stand over for 24 hours until the cream separates and rises to the top. Then
you steam it over boiling water for about four hours, until it forms a crust
at the top. It ends up at about 55 percent butterfat. There's a difference of
opinion in Cornwall over just how long it should be steamed. We make it thick
and runny, but others steam it until it's as thick as butter and you can slice
it.";   Near St. Keverne we met a woman along the Coastal Path with a black
dog. She wore boots, a handsome tan coat and a brown cap from which wisps of
gray hair protruded. "Have you seen any adders?" she asked, and as we shook
our heads she continued. "Well, it's wet and that brings them out, you know. I
expect I shall walk across the field.";   She smiled a goodbye. "Come on,
Jane. I don't think you need any more grass. She's a gun dog, but she's
gun-shy, so I said, 'I'll take her, I don't mind.' Cheerio.";   Hague noted
that "cheerio" as a word of parting is fading from use. "The younger
generation thinks it's too square, and they've taken to using 'cheers' as a
substitute. I think it's a damn shame. So is that." He pointed up the
hillside, where workers were dismantling a stone wall. "Small fields are
inefficient, you see, and that's why the walls and fences are coming down. It
took a thousand years to shape the English countryside, but bulldozers can
come in and tear it down in a day.";   On the fifth and last day, I descended
steep cliff steps to a sheltered, sunny beach near Bohortha. The waves fought
their way onto the shore in a melee of foam, and I walked along the beach
between surf and cliff. As a walker, I felt like a traveler rather than a
tourist. I remembered that Paul Theroux, walking around the British coast in
1982 gathering material for "The Kingdom by the Sea," became convinced he was
engaged in travel because "I was looking hard and because I had no other
business there.";   Walking is the way for the traveler to savor what poet
Gerald Manley Hopkins called "the dappled things" -- a flower, a bird's song,
a scrap of conversation with a stranger.;   In the end I felt attached to
Cornwall, both the people and the place. Walking was a powerful antidote for
the isolating patterns of conventional tourism. I came to know what the
British know: that the real charm of their landscape is best seen from the
public footpaths.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The Wayfarers is one of several
