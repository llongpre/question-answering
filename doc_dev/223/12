   Playwright August Wilson on Thursday captured
his second Pulitzer Prize for drama in four years when he was
honored with the 1990 award for ``The Piano Lesson.''
   Oscar Hijuelos' book, ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,''
won the 1990 Pulitzer for fiction. Hijuelos' novel detailed the
lives of three brothers from Havana who become minor celebrities as
musicians in New York nightclubs.
   ``I had no idea it was even being announced this week,''
Hijuelos, a Manhattan resident, said in a telephone interview from
a friend's house in Ulster County.
   ``I wasn't sitting around chewing on my nails. I came up here to
really cool out. Now, I may have to turn around and drive back into
the city. But worse things can happen.''
   It was only the second novel written by Hijuelos. Pultizer
Administrator Robert Christopher said he believed Hijuelos was the
first Hispanic winner of the Pulitzer for fiction.
   Stanley Karnow's book, ``In Our Image: America's Empire in the
Philippines,'' won for history. Karnow is a long-time foreign
correspondent for several news organizations. He also wrote
``Vietnam: A History,'' which later won six Emmy Awards in its
television incarnation.
   The Pulitzer for general non-fiction went to ``And Their
Children After Them'' by Dale Maharidge and Michael Williamson.
Maharidge is a reporter and Williamson a photographer for The
Sacramento (Calif.) Bee.
   Their book was a 50-year follow-up on the descendants of three
tenant families in Alabama who were made famous by James Agee and
Walker Evans in the book, ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.''
   ``Machiavelli In Hell'' by Sebastian de Grazia won the biography
Pulitzer. The Chicago native has been a Rutgers University
professor of political philosophy since 1962.
   Charles Simic's ``The World Doesn't End'' won for poetry. The
Stratford, N.H., resident had been nominated for a Pulitzer once
before for his ``Selected Poems: 1953-83.''
   The Pulitzer for music went to ``Duplicates: A Concerto for Two
Pianos and Orchestra'' by jazz and classical pianist Mel Powell.
   Powell, 67, started playing with the Benny Goodman Orchestra as
a teen-ager, later joining the Glenn Miller Air Force band. He
currently heads the composition faculty at the California Institute
of the Arts.
   Wilson's ``The Piano Lesson,'' which takes place in Pittsburgh
in 1936, concerns a sharecropper who wants to buy the land his
grandfather worked on as a slave and is willing to sell the family
heirloom, a piano, to pay for it.
   The play, which was one of the finalists last year, opens Monday
on Broadway. Wilson won in 1987 for ``Fences.''
   The prizes, recognizing outstanding work in journalism and the
arts, are awarded by Columbia University. Pulitzer winners receive
$3,000 in each category.
