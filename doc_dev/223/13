   Julius Lester has written 19 books, many for
children. His early works include a paean hymn to black power. His
latest book, ``Lovesong,'' caused an academic uproar and his exile
from the Afro-American studies department at the University of
Massachusetts.

   Julius Lester wrote the book on black
power in 1968 with a title he meant to be funny: ``Look Out,
Whitey! Black Power's Gon' Get Your Mama!''
   The title, however, was taken seriously by at least one
newspaper, which headlined the story: ``White Mamas in Danger, Says
Black Militant.''
   That same year Lester was branded an anti-Semite for having a
teacher read a student's poem on his radio show, beginning: ``Hey,
Jew boy, with that yarmulke on your head@You pale-faced Jew boy _ I
wish you were dead.''
   Twenty years later, the maverick Lester is again provoking
controversy, much of it related to his conversion to Judaism.
   ``There's a feeling among some that by becoming a Jew I am now
to be considered a traitor to black people,'' said Lester, 49.
``I've had black people say to me that they don't consider me to be
black, which is news to me, since I look in the mirror and very
clearly I'm black.''
   The man who was once, in his own words, ``anathema to Jews'' now
exchanges his cowboy hat on Saturdays for a skullcap and prayer
shawl and leads a conservative synagogue in song.
   ``There's a kind of intellectual climate in black America today
that really demands a conformity of thought,'' he says. ``If you
are critical of certain things, Jesse Jackson for example, then
people really treat you like a pariah.''
   Ironically, his book about his conversion, ``Lovesong,'' has
made him anathema to another group, the Afro-American studies
department at the University of Massachusetts, where he has taught
for 17 years.
   In the book, published in February, Lester accused writer James
Baldwin of making anti-Semitic remarks in a 1984 lecture. But
Lester refused to debate the matter with members of the
Afro-American studies department who said he was misinformed about
the speech.
   Colleagues saw the charge as pernicious and called Lester, in a
preface to a transcript of Baldwin's speech that they sent him, an
``anti-Negro Negro ... seeking compulsively to slay the
birth-people enemy who exist in his malicious and unforgiving
imagination.''
   ``He will blow in any wind that comes,'' says Michael Thelwell,
who recruited Lester into the department in 1971. Thelwell was
among 15 department members who signed a letter suggesting Lester
would be ``infinitely more comfortable'' elsewhere.
   At the center of the storm is a lanky, long-faced man who loves
playing pool, baking loaves of hallah for Sabbath dinners and
collecting stamps with the youngest of his four children, David, 9.
   ``I guess I just don't care that much about how I appear to
others,'' he says, sitting cross-legged by a field where David
plays ball. ``What's important to me is, whom does God see when God
looks at me?''
   The writings that land Lester in such hot water are only a
sideline to his teaching, he says. His classes are always
over-booked and he is the only faculty member to have earned the
university's top three teaching awards.
   He also is studying to be a cantor and writes children's books,
which make up more than half of the 19 books he has written so far.
His latest project is the fourth volume of the retelling of Joel
Chandler Harris's ``The Tales of Uncle Remus'' in a modern dialect.
   ``A lot of people just know me for children's books,'' he says,
chuckling.
   Lester was born in 1939 to a Methodist minister who was a pillar
of black parishes in Tennessee and Kansas and who would race away
from a gas station rather than accept the services of a white man
who called him ``boy.''
   Lester's great-grandfather was a Jewish immigrant from Germany
who married an ex-slave in the late 1800s and built a house that
stood apart from both the white and black neighborhoods of Pine
Bluff, Ark.
   In his will, his great-grandfather pledged his love to his wife
and wrote that he considered her ``my true and honest wife''
despite the anti-miscegenation laws of the time.
   Lester grew up a model minister's son, learning the Bible better
than some of his teachers.
   As a child, he was fascinated with ``Kol Nidre,'' a Hebrew
melody played on the eve of Yom Kippur, and with Shakespeare's
Shylock in ``The Merchant of Venice.'' He later wrote that he
identified with Shylock in ways he could not with black leaders.
   Lester graduated from Fisk University in 1960 and headed for New
York. Even then, the lure of Judaism was strong. Although Lester,
who has been married twice to whites, made a living as a folk
singer, the black spirituals he played failed to move him as
powerfully as Jewish songs did.
