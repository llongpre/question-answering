   When tango fans call 84-year-old
composer and pianist Osvaldo Pugliese ``the master,'' it is a
tribute to the man and the musician.
   A composer, arranger, pianist and band leader, Pugliese has
recorded hundreds of songs. His own classics include ``Recuerdo''
(``Memory'') and ``Malandraca'' (``Ruffians'').
   In August, his band of 12 musicians and two singers celebrated
its 50th anniversary. There were two performances to accommodate
all the fans. The following month, the band toured Holland and
Belgium. Last year, it played for two months in Japan.
   Pugliese fans say tango may be divided into before and after
``Recuerdo,'' a tune he wrote in 1924 that featured bandoleon riffs
which elevated the accordian-like instrument from the periphery to
the heart of the music.
   At the time, Pugliese was 19 - too young to legally register the
song in his own name. So his father, a leather cutter in a shoe
factory and an amateur flutist, took credit.
   Pugliese's signature piece, ``Yumba,'' was first performed in
1946. It showcases his distinctive style of a simple melody, a
one-three beat and the violent stops and starts of the instruments
- bandoleon, piano, violin and cello - that get feet tapping and
hearts pounding.
   In comparison, tango's other main exponent, bandoleonist and
composer Astor Piazzolla, revels in complex scores that are meant
to be listened to rather than danced. Sixty-nine and in poor
health, he acquired his own legion of fans by fusing tango and jazz
rhythms, and experimenting with instruments such as the clarinet
and the vibraphone. His followers compose songs on computers and
play them on electric guitars.
   But there's more to Pugliese than music. He's a communist who
never renounced his beliefs, a labor leader punished for promoting
workers' rights, a government critic who refused the safety of
exile, a factory worker's son who won fame but never turned his
back on his roots.
   The grade-school dropout and self-taught pianist also is a
forgiving man who accepted public apologies from President Gen.
Juan Peron and others who threw him in jail and denied him work
over four decades.
   ``His music is great because the man is a giant in every sense
of the word,'' Isidoro Gilbert wrote in the prologue to a 1985
book-length interview of Pugliese. ``He is the high priest of
tango, the soul of the city.''
   ``Pugliese is one of the few people who represent something
special about Buenos Aires,'' said theater promoter Lino Patalano.
``You will never hear anyone say a single bad word about him.''
   Pugliese's story is well known in this South American capital
where tango was born a century ago in bars and brothels by the
docks, and thrives today in nightclubs, dance halls and, when
Pugliese plays, theaters that seat several thousand.
   Jailed or barred from performing more times than he can
remember, Pugliese once persuaded a jailer to enroll in the
Communist Party. In 1961, he composed ``Milonga Para Fidel'' for
Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   During his enforced absences, Pugliese's orchestra would place a
red rose atop his black piano. The words, ``Tango Is Prisoner, Free
Osvaldo Pugliese,'' would appear as graffiti on the downtown
Obelisk, symbol of the city.
   In 1936, he helped found the Argentine Musicians Union so
colleagues might get a greater share of proceeds from concerts and
recordings. He still splits earnings with his band, and is not a
wealthy man.
   ``I enjoy good health and many friends,'' he said with a smile
at Tango House, a foundation he helped set up to promote the music.
He often can be found at the two-story building, playing truco (a
card game), sipping mate (bitter tea) and telling jokes in lunfardo
(Buenos Aires slang).
   Success seemed unlikely for Pugliese. He dropped out of school
after fourth grade and hired on as a printer's apprentice, learning
to play the piano on the side.
   But he had a natural gift and tremendous yearning. By age 14, he
was helping family finances by playing piano from 6 p.m. until 1
a.m. in cabarets. And practicing, practicing, always practicing.
   Asked his secret of composition, he once said, ``These things
just come out in an instant. ... They appeared in my head, they
appeared in my heart and, bruuuuuum, I wrote it.''
   At 84, Pugliese is hard of hearing, physically frail and sees
the world through thick lenses. But the passing of years has not
weakened his cheery good nature, unbreakable spirit or his touch.
   At his anniversary performance, the notes were clear and his
left-hand mightily swept down the keys. Between songs, he chatted
with fans who shouted out tunes they wanted to hear next.
   ``One thing surprised me,'' he said afterward. ``When I
finished, everyone was quiet and, I thought, asleep or bored? Then
came the applause. I almost had a heart attack.''
