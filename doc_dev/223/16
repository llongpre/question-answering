by Toni Morrison

TONI MORRISON'S fifth novel, Beloved, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1988,
explored the immediate psychological aftermath of slavery in the US during
the post-Civil War Reconstruction era. Conceived as a sequel, Jazz is set in
Harlem in 1926 among the burgeoning community of African-Americans who fled
north after emancipation to escape landlessness and lynchings.
While the novel's unnamed narrator hymns 'the City' in confiding, colloquial
tones, relaying snatches of melody from street-corner musicians and
ubiquitous Victrolas, the Jazz Age and the Harlem Renaissance are only
obliquely evoked. Jazz is present principally as a motif, signalling a new
freedom and sensuality alongside an overwhelming compulsion to forget. 'Here
comes the new. Look out. There goes the sad stuff. The bad stuff . . .
Forget that. History is over, you all, and everything's ahead at last.'
The vision proves illusory for Joe Trace, a door-to-door beauty produce
salesman and his wife Violet, who arrived from Virginia 20 years earlier on
a 'dancing train'. The novel begins as Joe has shot dead his young lover,
Dorcas, whose face Violet has attempted to slash with a knife at the
funeral. It is the complex motivations behind this melodrama that unfold
through the fragmented narrative, with its shifting viewpoints and its
flashbacks to the south, of families dispossessed, houses burned, men hanged
and mothers absent or suicidal.
Through Morrison's fictional 're-remembering' of forgotten black histories
she suggests the delusory nature of free action where the determining demons
of the past have been neither exhumed nor exorcised. The music that
expresses freedom's 'sweet desolation' also contains a 'complicated anger',
disguised as 'flourish and roaring seduction', that can trigger
self-destruction.
Yet, in a narrative twist, Jazz reaffirms the possibility of freedom, of
transcending rather than succumbing to the past as 'an abused record with no
choice but to repeat itself at the crack'. In place of the sensational
events initially promised the reader, Joe and Violet opt for a healing, even
cloying, reconciliation, for 'figuring things out'. The storyteller
confesses both her power and her inadequacy, her characters having been
'busy being original, complicated, changeable, human . . . putting their
lives together in ways I never dreamed of'.
While Jazz displays Morrison's supreme ability to illuminate social process
and the sweep of history through character, those seeking the emotional
authority of Beloved or the visionary intensity of The Bluest Eye, Sula or
Song of Solomon, are likely to be disappointed in Jazz's preoccupation with
its own construction; the self-consciousness of the telling has perhaps been
at the expense of the tale
Morrison, a revered chronicler of the African-American experience, in a
collection of essays on the work of white American writers, challenges
'American Africanism': the 'disabling virus' of myths, stereotypes and
misconceptions of African peoples, to which her own fiction is a powerful
antidote. In Playing in the Dark she argues that, just as the
Enlightenment's concept of freedom was parasitical on the reality of
slavery, the rights of man yoked inevitably to the assumption of racial
hierarchy, the concerns of a nascent American literature were shaped by the
white relationship to a 'dark, abiding, signing Africanist presence'.
Developed with illustrations from Poe, Twain, Melville, Hemingway and
others, Morrison's argument provocatively extends critiques of colonial
literature (notably Edward Said's Orientalism, or the Nigerian Chinua
Achebe's dissection of Conrad) to white American writing in its relation to
its own subordinate black population. In doing so, she challenges the
'universalist' or 'race-free' pretensions of a literature whose habitual
resort to shorthand constructions of blackness marks it out as the product
of white writers with an assumed white readership.
More crucially, her sombre conclusion that racism 'is as healthy as it was
during the Enlightenment', its utility as a metaphor having outstripped its
ideological purpose in justifying economic exploitation, lays down a
challenge to others to share her own project as a writer: to 'free-up' the
language from the 'sinister, lazy, predictable racial codes' that pervade
and impoverish it.
