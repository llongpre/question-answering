   The Charlotte Observer's dogged coverage of the
PTL financial scandal, scorned by Jim and Tammy Bakker and many
readers, earned the Pulitzer Prize for public service, journalism's
highest honor.
   In the arts, Toni Morrison's novel of a former slave,
``Beloved,'' won the Pulitzer for fiction, a category closely
watched after the book failed to win two other prestigious awards
for which it was nominated.
   Alfred Uhry's first non-musical play, ``Driving Miss Daisy,''
won the drama prize and Richard Rhodes was awarded the non-fiction
prize for his book, ``The Making of the Atomic Bomb.''
   The Charlotte Observer, The Wall Street Journal and the Miami
Herald each won two awards.
   The Knight-Ridder newspaper group won six in all, with the
Observer's two, the Herald's two and one each for the Philadelphia
Inquirer and the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch. A total of 21
Pulitzers were awarded Thursday for achievement in the arts and
journalism.
   The Observer revealed misuse of funds by the PTL ministry
``through persistent coverage conducted in the face of a massive
campaign by PTL to discredit the newspaper,'' the Pulitzer board
said.
   The Observer's Managing Editor Mark Ethridge III said the real
reward was winning over readers who had denounced the newspaper's
efforts.
   ``The thing that gratifies us the most of all about PTL are the
folks who have written us and said, `Two years ago, I wrote you and
said you all were going to hell. ... Now, I want to say I'm wrong
and keep up the reporting,''' Ethridge said.
   The paper won the public service award in 1981 for its coverage
of ``brown lung'' among textile workers.
   The Miami Herald's Michel duCille won the feature photography
prize for photographs of the decay and rehabilitation of a housing
project inundated by the drug crack. He also won a prize for spot
news photography two years ago.
   The Herald's humor columnist, Dave Barry, won the prize for
commentary for his ``consistently effective use of humor as a
device for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns.''
   ``It's fun to win a Pulitzer, everybody should do it,'' Barry
said.
   The Wall Street Journal's two prizes came in explanatory
journalism and specialized reporting.
   The paper's Daniel Hertzberg and James B. Stewart won for
stories about an investment banker charged with insider trading and
about the day after the October stock market crash. Walt Bogdanich
won the specialized reporting prize for a series on faulty testing
by medical laboratories.
   Winners generally sounded giddy.
   ``Several people in the newsroom just took a champagne bath,''
said Jacqui Banaszynski of the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch, who
won the prize in feature writing for her series on an AIDS victim
in a farm community.
   ``There was a lot of dancing and yelling and singing when the
announcement came over the wire _ but that's not unusual for the
Journal newsroom,'' said Jim Tharpe, managing editor of the Alabama
Journal in Montgomery, which won in general news for its
investigation of the state's unusually high infant mortality rate.
   The Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune also won in general news for
stories that showed flaws in the Massachusetts prison furlough
system.
   Tom Shales of the Washington Post won the criticism award for
his writings on television.
   Ms. Morrison acknowledged the controversy surrounding her book
after it failed to win the National Book Award and the National
Book Critics Circle Award last fall. In January, 48 black writers
and critics signed an open letter deploring the lack of national
recognition of her book.
   But the chairman of the Pulitzer fiction jury, Rutgers
University professor Julian Moynahan, said jurors made their
recommendations six weeks before the letter was published and felt
no pressure to recommend Ms. Morrison's book.
   ``I am glad that the merits of the book were allowed to surface
and be the only consideration of the Pulitzer Prize committee,''
Morrison said.
   Other awards in journalism:
   _ National reporting, to Tim Weiner of the Inquirer for a series
on a secret Pentagon budget used to sponsor defense research and an
arms buildup. He was part of a Kansas City Times and Kansas City
Star team that won a Pulitzer in 1982 for general news reporting.
   _ Investigative reporting, to the Chicago Tribune's Dean Baquet,
William Gaines and Ann Marie Lipinski for stories on ``the
self-interest and waste that plagued Chicago's City Council.''
   _ International reporting, to Thomas L. Friedman of The New York
Times for what the Pulitzer board termed ``balanced and informed
coverage of Israel.'' _ Editorial writing, to Jane Healy of The
Orlando Sentinel for editorials that protested overdevelopment of
Florida's Orange County.
   _ Editorial cartooning, to Doug Marlette of the Atlanta
Constitution and the Charlotte Observer.
   _ Spot news photography, to Scott Shaw of the Odessa (Texas)
American for his pictures of little Jessica McClure being rescued
from the well into which she had fallen.
   Other arts awards included:
   _ History, ``The Launching of Modern American Science
1846-1876,'' by Robert V. Bruce.
   _ Biography, ``Look Homeward: A Life of Thomas Wolfe,'' by David
Herbert Donald.
   _ Poetry, ``Partial Accounts: New and Selected Poems,'' by
William Meredith.
   _ Music, ``12 Etudes for Piano,'' by William Bolcom.
   Winners are selected by the Pulitzer board, which is guided by,
but not obligated to restrict itself to, a series of finalists
submitted by nominating juries in the various categories.
   Except for the award for public service, which brings with it a
gold medal, Pulitzers carry a cash prize of $3,000. The winners are
announced by the president of Columbia University, which
administers the competition.
