   It requires a special talent to take an obscure
wedding dance by Edvard Grieg and turn it into a Hit Parade smash
like ``Strange Music'' or transform the exotic themes of Borodin
into songs like ``Stranger in Paradise'' and ``Baubles, Bangles and
Beads.''
   For much of their careers, George Forrest and Robert Wright have
used that talent, adapting someone else's music, usually a
classical composer, and spinning it into something new.
   They did it in Hollywood, working on dozens of films like
``Maytime,'' ``Sweethearts'' and ``I Married an Angel,'' and on
Broadway with shows like ``Song of Norway,'' ``Magdalena'' and
``Kismet.''
   ``Writing original music is 10 or 20 times easier than the
things for which we are best known,'' Wright was saying the other
day. ``The first thing you have to do as an adapter is learn
everything a composer ever wrote. Then you have to assemble and
assimilate the music. And finally, think the way he did.''
   At 75, Wright is the talkative member of the songwriting team.
Forrest, one year younger, nods in agreement. Their partnership has
lasted some 60 years. It began at Miami Senior High School where
they wrote their first song _ ``Hail to Miami High!'' _ and has
continued into the present. Their latest musical, ``Grand Hotel,''
currently is on view at the Martin Beck Theater.
   ``Grand Hotel,'' directed and choreographed by Tommy Tune,
focuses on the guests at a large luxury hotel in Berlin. It's based
on the 1920s best-selling Vicki Baum novel that later became a
successful movie starring Greta Garbo and John Barrymore.
   The musical, using an original Wright and Forrest score, takes
place in 1928, a year its composer and lyricist remember very well.
   ``We were both working musicians by that time,'' Wright says.
   ``I had won an amateur contest playing the Rachmaninoff `C Sharp
Minor Prelude' when I was 9 and went into vaudeville. I found out
very young that there was money in music, so I never touched the
piano unless I was paid.
   ``I played for Helen Morgan, Leonard Rose and Sally Rand, all in
the same year. I think it was 1933.''
   Two years later, at ages 21 and 20, Wright and Forrest went to
Hollywood and found work at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., the studio
associated with the classiest of the movie musicals. They were
signed to write original music and lyrics. But the team found
little work until a disaster nearly derailed a film version of
Sigmund Romberg's ``Maytime,'' starring Nelson Eddy and Jeanette
MacDonald.
   Irving Thalberg, the legendary producer, died with only half the
film musical completed. A new director started over, and Wright and
Forrest were assigned to come up with new musical material. Much of
it was taken from music already in the public domain, pieces like
Tchaikovsky's ``Fifth Symphony'' and pieces of operas. The movie
was a big success, and Wright and Forrest stayed in Hollywood for
seven years, participating in some 50 movies, often anonymously.
   ``We worked on anything they asked,'' Wright says. ``You're
slaves in Hollywood, very happy slaves, but they owned us body and
soul. We always did our very best and worked as artistically as we
possibly could.''
   Finally, they quit. Herbert Stothart, MGM's famous musical
director and their mentor, told them: ``They'll keep you forever.
People will never know who you are.''
   Before they left they wrote a small musical revue called ``Thank
You, Columbus,'' that opened _ and closed _ in Los Angeles. But
through it, they met producer Edwin Lester who vowed to put on
their next show.
   ``Once you write anything for the stage and you put it in front
of an audience and you hear them react, then the movies become very
dreary and dull,'' Wright says.
   The team traveled to New York to write for cabaret, nightclubs
and radio. The work included special club material for performers
like Jimmy Durante, Ella Logan, Sophie Tucker, Joe E. Lewis, Jane
Froman and Carmen Miranda.
   Lester reappeared in their lives in 1944, with an idea for a
stage musical based on the life of Edvard Grieg, using the
composer's own melodies. The idea became ``Song of Norway.'' It was
a big success for Lester in California, and he brought it to New
York where it ran for over two years.
   Lester also was responsible for ``Kismet,'' the team's other big
New York hit. This musical, a sort of Broadway meets the Arabian
Nights, won them a Tony Award in 1954. Besides ``Stranger in
Paradise'' and ``Baubles, Bangles and Beads,'' the songs included
``This Is My Beloved'' and ``Rhymes Have I.''
   The musical version of ``Grand Hotel'' has had a 20-year
history. It began in 1958 with Luther Davis who adapted the book
for the great Yiddish comedian Menasha Skulnik. It was called ``At
the Grand.''
   But by th time the musical went into production, it starred Paul
Muni and Joan Diener. Muni got sick, and the musical never got
beyond tryouts in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   Two years ago, Davis resurrected the idea and took it to Wright
and Forrest.
   He told them, ``I would like to start all over again and really
do Vicki Baum's novel,'' Wright recalls. ``Our other version was
set in Rome and was about movies and opera. We went back to the
original.''
   Wright and Forrest began reworking their score, and Davis
extensively revised the book.
   ``The most important part of a musical is the book, not the
music and lyrics,'' Wright says. ``Once the book tells a story that
is interesting, then the music and lyrics have something to say. Up
until then, they are just songs.''
   ``The book is more important because most of the critics are
literary critics; they are not music critics,'' Forrest adds.
``What they criticize is the book.''
   At ages when most people have been retired for a decade, Wright
and Forrest keep writing.
   They are revising ``The Anastasia Game,'' a new version of their
1965 musical ``Anya,'' which recently had a production in
Massachusetts, and working on ``Uncle Daniel,'' a musical based on
the Eudora Welty novella ``The Ponder Heart.''
   ``You can't stop working,'' Wright says.
   ``Besides, most of our working consists of sitting and
thinking,'' Forrest adds. ``You sit and you wish.''
