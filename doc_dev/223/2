   Toni Morrison felt ``kind of a redemption'' when
she won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction for her spellbinding and
searing song of slavery, ``Beloved.''
   ``I thought it was quite possible that the value of the book
would not be allowed to be the only consideration that the
(Pulitzer) committee would have to consider, and that saddened
me,'' Morrison said Thursday.
   The editor, playwright and author had been the epicenter of a
literary earthquake and controversy.
   After ``Beloved'' did not win either the National Book Award or
the National Book Critics Circle Award, 48 prominent black writers
and critics signed a statement deploring the celebrated writer's
lack of recognition.
   Morrison's ``Song of Solomon'' did win the National Book Critics
Circle Award for 1977, but the two other awards are considered more
prestigious.
   The statement, published as an open letter in the New York Times
Book Review in January, was signed by such literary figures as the
writers Maya Angelou, Amiri Baraka, John Williams and John Edgar
Wideman, the poet June Jordan and critic Henry Louis Gates Jr.
   ``Beloved,'' they said, was ``a gift to our community, our
country, our conscience.''
   The statement said Morrison ``has yet to receive the national
recognition that her five major works of fiction entirely deserve.''
   Although Morrison said she didn't know a campaign was being
mounted on her behalf, when she read the letter, she felt wonderful.
   ``It says you're valuable to us. It doesn't say you're flawless;
it just says we esteem you. It's kind of obit information _ the
kind of thing you never expect.''
   However, Morrison said she was hurt by charges that she had
manipulated other writers.
   ``The only manipulations are between the covers of the book,''
she said. ``There was an article some one read to me on the phone
about `affirmative- action prizes.' That's depressing.
   ``Somebody told me that I should simply come out and declare
that I did not want the Pulitzer,'' she continued. ``So I dismissed
all of it very happily from my mind until today. And I had genuine
astonishment that the committee made a decision on the merits of
the book.''
   The fiction committee consisted of Julian Moynahan, critic and
professor of English at Rutgers University; critic Richard Eder, a
former Pulitzer winner; and the writer Alice Adams.
   Moynahan said the jurors made their recommendations six weeks
before the letter was published and felt no pressure to recommend
Morrison's book.
   ``I think her book is one of the greatest American novels I've
ever read in my life,'' he said.
   The best-selling ``Beloved,'' published by Knopf, is partly
based on a true account of an escaped slaved named Margaret Garner
who decided to kill her child rather than see her returned to
bondage. It was a chilling choice faced by many during the horrors
of slavery; many Africans chose suicide in the Atlantic during the
crossing on slave ships, and others killed their children or wives
before leaving the continent.
   In language rich and riveting, Morrison tells the tale of Sethe,
who escapes from Kentucky and struggles to survive in post-bellum
Ohio in a house haunted by her dead baby.
   The 57-year-old Morrison, who grew up in Lorain, Ohio, had heard
the Garner story and found herself curious and puzzled by the woman
herself.
   ``In spite of all the political furor about her, the woman was
elusive,'' the writer said. ``She was described always as being so
serene, so calm. But she said very little. The mystery was not the
situation but what goes on inside a woman like that; what was she
feeling?''
   Morrison, a former Random House editor whose other works include
the novels ``Tar Baby'' and ``Song of Solomon,'' and the play
``Dreaming Emmett,'' said ``Beloved'' is the best writing she's
ever done.
