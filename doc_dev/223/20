   It's been months since Oscar Hijuelos has looked
at his novel, ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' a nominee for
the National Book Award.
   He remembers love scenes and music, but certain passages have
slipped his mind; picking up the book again will be like reading it
for the first time.
   It always works that way. Faces of old friends become blurred
over the years. Listen to your favorite song 100 times and a note
or turn of phrase will still surprise you. Only the most fanatical
Lucy fan can anticipate every joke.
   Memory, music, ``I Love Lucy'' _ they all matter in ``The Mambo
Kings Plays Songs of Love'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $18.95), in
which Desi Arnaz briefly drops in on the world of brothers Cesar
and Nestor Castillo, and to their astonishment, transports them to
the living room of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo.
   ``Arnaz was always one of the essential, successful Cubans,''
said Hijuelos, the son of Cuban immigrants. ``He didn't have a down
image. When you think about how Latins are portrayed in the media,
even today, they're either hoods or they're cops.
   ``He was a middle-class man, very successful. He had a
whacked-out life, but he had a real relationship, a real life, and
that image really enchanted me. He also a slight melancholic
streak. He had a lot of qualities that I related to.''
   Try to remember this ``I Love Lucy'' episode: Two Cuban
brothers, old friends of Ricky's, arrive at the apartment one day.
They exchange chitchat with the Ricardos, and later appear at the
Tropicana, crooning ``Beautiful Maria of My Soul'' with the
bandleader himself joining the brothers on stage. (Lucy, naturally,
is upset because she wanted to appear in the show instead).
   Sound familiar? Well, it never really happened, but that's the
point. ``Mambo Kings'' is a song of invented memory, a mournful
melody of events distorted by nostalgia and loss.
   ``The one thing you don't lose is memory, and memory nags you,''
Hijuelos said. ``Look at Jewish writers who write about things that
have happened, internally things go around and around and around.
   ``If you're hung up on the past you can't move forward. Nestor
tries to get courage from the American notion of discarding the
past and move forward.''
   Loss of youth, love and country run through ``Mambo Kings.'' In
the late 1940s, Carlos _ gregarious and ambitious _ and Nestor _
moody and romantic _ arrive in New York as aspiring mambo
musicians. The end comes 30 years later, in a rundown hotel room
where Carlos drinks himself to death.
   Women inspire their songs and their songs inspire women. Love
affairs for Carlos are as intense, and short-lived, as the latest
dance craze. For Nestor, heartbreak is timeless, a haunting ballad
undiminished by repeated listenings.
   And memories of home are inescapable for both Castillos. No
amount of rum, women and song can replace their simple, easygoing
life in Cuba.
   ``I think most immigrants are basically homesick,'' Hijuelos
said. ``You can't imagine losing something like your country unless
you've really lost it. It's just a dream of something lost, which
you can never really retrieve.
   ``You meet Cubans in Miami who have made a million bucks, but
they will never have what they had before.''
   Hijuelos was born in 1951 and grew up on 118th Street on
Manhattan's Upper West Side, a neighborhood remembered in his first
novel, ``Our House in the Last World,'' published in 1985.
   He first wanted to be a musician, but was turned off by the rock
'n' roll drug scene and drifted into writing in his mid-20s.
Hijuelos nearly quit that as well, finding authors no more
appealing than rock stars.
   ``I went to a writers conference in 1978 and I found it the most
sexist, hierarchal, opinionated, prejudical place I've ever been on
Earth. If you don't write their way, you don't write. If you're a
woman and pretty, you get invited to parties, if not, forget it.''
   Meeting author Donald Barthelme, who died recently, provided
Hijuelos with a valued friend and mentor.
   ``He sort of took me under his wing and pointed me in the right
direction,'' Hijuelos recalled. ``He wasn't narrow-minded in his
view of literature and exposed me to a lot of writers. And even
though I was writing quite differently from him, he never held that
against me.''
   ``He was a really nice man and a top-notch editorial adviser.''
   Barthelme helped with ``Mambo Kings,'' and Arnaz and some
not-so-famous musicians provided inspiration. Hijuelos recalled
working in a downtown office where the elevator operator would come
up to his floor and sing. A Cuban musician who died in a London
hotel room made a lasting impression.
   And, of course, there were songs, hundreds of them. ``Mambo
Kings'' is like a greatest hits album, complete with Hijuelos'
favorite dance songs, boleros and ballads.
   Hijuelos urges readers to start where they wish, open at any
page, like dropping the needle in the middle of a record, or tuning
in ``I Love Lucy'' at intermission and quickly filling in the plot.
   ``Barthelme was like that. Instead of thinking of a chapter as a
chapter, you think of it as an atmosphere, a state of
consciousness,'' he said. ``I wrote this book where you can open it
up anywhere and get an idea of what's going on in the book.''
