   James Lamont ``Haven'' Gillespie, who wrote
the lyrics for ``Santa Claus is Comin' To Town,'' will no longer be
without honor in his hometown.
   City officials unveiling a historical marker Thursday at Goebel
Park said there was no better time than Christmas to honor Gillespie
on the 100th anniversary of his birth. He was born Feb. 6, 1888, in
the northern Kentucky city and died in Las Vegas on March 14, 1975.
   Gillespie, author of some 1,000 songs, wrote the lyrics to his
most famous song on the back of an envelope in 1933 and collaborated
with J. Fred Coots on the music. Eddie Cantor made it famous when he
sang it on his radio program in 1934.
   City Commissioner Irvin Callery said Thursday he became
interested in 1984 in having the city recognize the songwriter
``because I couldn't find anything to honor him,'' Callery said.
   Callery said Gillespie's famous Christmas song has ``brought joy
to millions of people. Anyone who hears it remembers childhood.''

   If President-elect George Bush has some
free time, he is welcome to revel in his victory over Masachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis at the home of a third-grader in northern
Illinois.
   ``I would like him to come to my house and rub it in to my dad
that he won and Dukakis lost,'' said Patrick Yanez.
   Patrick and the other students in Nancy Sandberg's class at
Gregory School in Rockford, 75 miles northwest of Chicago, did not
forget their own agendas in essays providing advice to the next
president.
   ``I would like him to force my parents to buy me a horse.'' said
Kari Morgan.
   Kristina Bernard wrote, ``I want Mr. Bush to help my grandma
because she is in River Bluff Nursing Home. She had a stroke and I
felt sorry for her. I want her to get better.''
   But she had other plans for two siblings.
   ``I would really like it if he would take my 20-year-old brother
and my 18-year-old sister away. I will really like him if he does
this.''
