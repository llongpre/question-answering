<LEADPARA>  WE INTERRUPT this mundane existence to remember Cole Porter.;    In case you
haven't circled the date on your calendar, note please that Porter was born
June 9, 1891, to Kate Cole and Samuel Fenwick Porter. Cole was the first of
the Porter children to survive his early infancy. Two earlier children had
died as babies.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It took Cole Porter 10 years to write his first song, "Song of the Birds."
It was not a hit.;    But after that, the songs came hot and heavy. At 11,
Cole Porter wrote "The Bobolink Waltz," which was actually published
(privately) and 100 copies were printed, thanks to Mom.;    In the 73 years of
his life, Cole Porter was to write more than 800 songs, more than half
unpublished. There are few writers who were more prolific.;    Today Cole
Porter occupies a musical niche all his own. He's still the backbone of
cabaret performers the world over, not to mention the cocktail lounge
pianists. He represents a style and an age that has all but disappeared, but
that just adds nostalgia to his material.;    Porter came out of a time when
songwriting was a youthful sport, much like stand-up comedy is today. Musical
shows were everywhere. Broadway, in a season, might have four or five dozen.; 
  Young lyricists and composers had college shows and college revues to learn
their craft, and Porter took advantage of that at Yale, where he composed (and
wrote his own lyrics for) many campus hits. ("Bulldog, Bulldog, Bow Wow Wow"
is still played at football games.);    Robert Kimball's hefty book, "The
Complete Lyrics of Cole Porter" (Knopf) has collected the songs, including the
ones at Yale. One begins:;    "First select a small canoe/ Where there's room
for only two . . .";    Little turns of phrase and wit. In our own age, where
rock lyrics cannot be heard or understood without special effort, Porter's
lyrical sophistication seems quaint. But his words are as well remembered as
that of any poet and, in concert with his melodies, serve as a backdrop for so
many private memories over the years.;    Speaking of rock lyrics, where
profanity seems commonplace, it's interesting to note that Porter was
considered risque in his time, and such songs as "I Get a Kick Out of You" had
to have such lines as "I get no kick from cocaine" censored.;    The beautiful
ballad "Love for Sale" could not be sung on radio or television for years.;   
Porter was a rich kid who spent many years in Europe. His career developed
slowly and is replete with flop shows and abandoned songs. A riding accident,
wherein a horse fell on him and crushed both legs, left him in pain the rest
of his life. Six years before his death, one leg was amputated.;    Today,
Porter is part of a select group of American songwriters who are considered
literary and musical treasures. Yale University has a collection of his
manuscripts. So does the Library of Congress. A discovery at a Warner Bros.
warehouse of unseen Porter lyrics in 1982 was front-page news everywhere.;   
That's kind of amazing, considering the low esteem songwriting enjoyed during
those early days of Porter's career. Lorenz Hart, who wrote lyrics for Richard
Rodgers, was said to have become seriously depressed by the lack of importance
of his calling.;    Today, ironically, songwriting is a huge money-maker,
though, with the exception of a Stephen Sondheim (and you will get an argument
there), nobody comes up to the artistry of a Cole Porter now.;    But enough
of this tribute. Let's get to the songs. I regret I can't supply the melodies,
but hunt up an Ella Fitzgerald album or, if you can find one, a rare recording
by Janice Mars, who sang Cole Porter as if she lived each lyric. In a pinch,
some of Sinatra will do.;    And you'll hear: "Begin the Beguine" and the
haunting "In the Still of the Night.";    You will be cheered by "From This
Moment On." Romance was never better than "I've Got You Under My Skin." It's
said that a mourning Jackie Kennedy sat for hours listening to "Down in the
Depths on the 90th Floor.";    Americans during World War II wept through
"You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To." Mary Martin first made her mark with "My
Heart Belongs to Daddy.";    So many songs are classics: "You're the Top,"
"It's De-Lovely." "It's All Right With Me," "Night and Day," "Just One of
Those Things.";    Roy Rogers and his horse, Trigger, recorded "Don't Fence Me
In" during that song's heyday. And a recording last year by current pop and
rock stars doing Porter, "Red, Hot &plus; Blue," was a surprise hit, bridging the
generations.;    This year there will be many reminiscences, including galas
at Carnegie Hall and the London Palladium this week and next. There will even
be a postage stamp.;    All meant to say, Cole, you're the top.  </TEXT>
