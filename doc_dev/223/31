<TEXT>     Movie producer Buddy Fidler holds the latest pages of a script by Stine, a
novelist-turned-screenwriter.;    "You like 'em?" Stine asks.;    "They're
perfect," Fidler says with false sincerity. "But we'll fix 'em.";    Moments
later, he breaks into a song that admonishes: "Don't cling to the words to
which you gave birth/ Remember how many a picture is worth.";    Time zips
forward. It's the early 1990s. The place, once again, is Los Angeles.;   
Scriptwriter Larry Gelbart, composer Cy Coleman, lyricist David Zippel and
director Michael Blakemore are talking about their stage musical "City of
Angels," which opens today at L.A.'s Shubert Theatre.;    Their collaboration
has been more harmonious than that of Stine and Fidler, their fictional
creations.;    "A real collaboration is a complementing of talents," Gelbart
said. "We laughed at the same jokes. We had the same appreciation of what a
lyric ought to be and what a melody ought to be -- of how this show should
employ humor, drama, words and music.";    The chemistry seems to have worked.
For a year and a half, "City of Angels" has been on Broadway, where it won six
1990 Tony Awards, including Best Musical.;    Audiences and critics alike have
applauded the show's stylish evocation of such 1940s detective movies as "The
Maltese Falcon" and "The Big Sleep." The script crackles with the energy of a
Raymond Chandler novel, and the score incorporates jazz styles ranging from
sultry torch songs to the slinky harmonies of such vocal groups as Lambert,
Hendricks and Ross.;    The show begins with the set and costumes in the
black, white, and gray tones of a '40s flick. The story involves the
wise-cracking, tough-as-nails private investigator Stone (portrayed by Tony
winner James Naughton), and he's ably assisted -- and quietly adored -- by
Oolie (Tony winner Randy Graff), his secretary and girl Friday.;    Stone
senses trouble when the rich and beautiful Alaura Kingsley struts into his
office, asking him to find her missing stepdaughter. Still, he falls for this
femme fatale, as well as her $100 retainer. He takes the job.;    A typewriter
is heard as the characters continue speaking. A writer -- in full color -- is
seen on the other side of the stage. He pauses, and the characters speak their
last lines backward and move backward to their previous positions. When the
writer begins typing again, the characters replay the scene with a few
changes.;    The writer is Stine, author of a best-selling novel about
fictional detective Stone. He is adapting the novel, titled "City of Angels,"
as a screenplay. The black-and-white movie springs directly from his mind,
with people from his real life reincarnated in the screenplay.;    Many
reviews and feature articles have described "City of Angels" as a spoof of
detective movies. The creators disagree. "This is not a parody," Gelbart said.
"We did this out of affection and respect for that genre.";    The story
behind the musical's creation is considerably less convoluted than the plots
of those private-eye movies. In the early 1980s, Gelbart and Coleman began
talking about doing a show together. Gelbart, 63, started out in radio and
television, writing comic material for such entertainers as Sid Caesar, Bob
Hope and Danny Kaye. He later developed and co-produced the television series
"M(*)A(*)S(*)H." For the theater, he co-wrote the book for the musical "A
Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," and he wrote the recent
Broadway play "Mastergate.";    Coleman, 61, was a familiar presence on
Broadway, having written the scores for such musicals as "Wildcat," "Little
Me," "Sweet Charity," "On the Twentieth Century" and "Barnum.";    Several
years passed. Then, in the mid-'80s, they decided to work with Coleman's idea
for a private-eye musical. As work progressed, they brought in Zippel. At 36,
he's the youngster in the group. Before "City of Angels," he was best known
for songs he had written for Barbara Cook and for an off-Broadway revue of his
songs, titled "It's Better With a Band.";    "We wanted everything to match so
that it would seem like one person wrote the show," Zippel said. Music and
dialogue were carefully integrated, so that the songs would advance the plot
and set the mood.;    "As a composer working in the theater, you have to be a
dramatist," Coleman said. Music can be extraordinarily powerful when it's
intelligently combined with the story, he explained. "The power to manipulate
with music is just mammoth. You can do anything you want with people's
emotions.";    The writers targeted Blakemore as their director. Blakemore,
who hails from Australia, has won acclaim in England and the United States for
directing such plays as "Noises Off," "Benefactors" and the Maggie Smith hit
"Lettice and Lovage.";    Once he joined the project, Blakemore helped to
sharpen and clarify. One of his primary objectives was to make the film
sequences look like the real thing. "I tried to put a movie on stage," he
said. To achieve this, he coordinated the actors' movements and the shifting
of the sets to resemble tracking shots and other camera movements.;    "City
of Angels" opened Dec. 11, 1989, at Broadway's Virginia Theatre. A few months
later, it was named Best Musical at the Tony Awards, and it won other awards
for Gelbart's book, Coleman and Zippel's score, Naughton and Graff's
performances and Robin Wagner's sets.;    Blakemore smiled when asked if the
humor in "City of Angels" is cutting enough to make Hollywood nervous. "I
don't think the movie industry has anything to fear," he said.  </TEXT>
