   Blowing out the candles and making a wish
may get you a rendition of ``Happy Birthday to You,'' but you can't
buy it for a song. The ditty is for sale for at least $12 million,
says the company that owns it.
   Cooed by Marilyn Monroe to President John F. Kennedy, sung
recently by 90,000 fans to Michael Jackson, and a staple of
children's birthday parties for almost a century, the song that
seems ageless while reminding us we aren't is on the block with the
other musical holdings of Birchtree Ltd. of Princeton.
   ``The first six notes of `Happy Birthday' are as recognizable as
the first four notes in Beethoven's `Fifth Symphony,''' said Gary
Hanson of the Cleveland Orchestra. ``Of course, `Happy Birthday' is
played a lot more than Beethoven.''
   David Sengstack, chairman of Birchtree, said he can only guess
what made the song so popular.
   ``I think it was the movies that did it,'' he told The New York
Times.
   Translated into dozens of languages, the composition began as a
classroom greeting in 1893 with Louisville, Ky., teachers Patty
Smith Hill and her sister, Mildred J. Hill. The two kindergarten
and Sunday school teachers wrote the song, with the lyrics ``Good
morning to you,'' as part of a book ``Song Stories for the Sunday
School.''
   Since then, it has become one of the three most popular songs in
the English language along with ``Auld Lang Syne'' and ``For He's a
Jolly Good Fellow,'' according to the Guinness Book of World
Records.
   Birchtree, which owns the copyright to about 50,000 titles, says
royalties will still be coming in until the year 2010, when the
copyright expires. It brings it about $1 million a year, according
to the Times.
   ``Everybody uses it,'' said Kate Shen, a spokeswoman for
Birchtree. ``It gets used in movies and plays and greeting cards,
music boxes, television shows and commercials. It's just about
everywhere.''
   Even underwear.
   The company objected when Frederick's of Hollywood advertised
underwear that played ``Happy Birthday.'' But it had no problem
when Casio programmed the song into digital watches that play it
every hour on the watch owner's birthday. The song brings Birchtree
a penny a watch.
   A lawsuit against Postal Telegraph in the 1940's attempted to
keep the song from being used in singing telegrams. But the suit
was dropped when lawyers argued that even though it was sung for
profit, it was not heard in public.
   Since then, the song has been used _ and paid for _ in the films
``10,'' ``The Great Santini,'' ``Oh, God,'' and ``Fame.''
   ``I don't know really why it became so popular,'' Ms. Shen said.
``It seems to bring out the little kid in a lot of people. It's
something we've all grown up with.''
   The song's melody originally had the lyrics: ``Good Morning to
you, good morning to you, good morning, dear children, good morning
to all.'' Only later did the sisters add the birthday lyrics.
   A copyright was issued on the song in 1935 to Clayton F. Summy
Co., of Chicago, a sheet-music retailer that published the Hill
sisters' work. A New York accountant eventually purchased the song
and then sold it to the Sengstack family, which owns Birchtree.
