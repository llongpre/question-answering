   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The man who created gospel music is as obscure
as his music is popular. Thomas Dorsey is now 88 and bedridden in
his Chicago home. A handful of gospel devotees are working to build
a foundation that would preserve both his music and his memory.

   More than half a century ago, Thomas Dorsey
crossed the raw soulfulness of the blues with the sacred music of
his youth to create a foot-stomping, soul-slapping sound that still
fills black churches.
   A personal conflict over his strict religious upbringing and
love of the bawdy, bluesy tunes inspired by slave songs led the
young jazz pianist to create what he called ``gospel'' music.
   Now 88, bedridden in his Chicago home and suffering from
Alzheimer's disease, Dorsey is in danger of dying in obscurity, his
legend unknown by a generation of worshippers who revere his music
but don't know his name.
   ``He was the person who gave blacks a medium to keep their
tradition alive,'' says Michael Harris, a professor of religion and
African American studies at Temple University in Philadelphia and
the author of a new biography on Dorsey.
   Black church music before Dorsey ``was very easygoing. It wasn't
upbeat, it wasn't filled with a lot of rhythmic tones,'' says Bob
Storman, a former gospel performer who with a handful of other
aficionados is working to build a Dorsey foundation in Chicago.
   ``It wasn't until the late '20s and '30s that a lot of ministers
would let that kind of music into their church,'' Storman says.
``The ministers figured that it was indecent and unreligious. For
them it was like some people react to acid rock music today.''
   Dorsey's song ``It's Tight Like That'' hit the top of the blues
charts about September 1928, Harris says. ``A number of people were
very shocked to see the type of music they danced to the night
before the next morning in church,'' he says.
   Dorsey's all-time greatest hit, ``Take My Hand, Precious Lord,''
was the favorite song of the Rev. Martin Luther King, and was
popularized by the late Mahalia Jackson, who once toured with
Dorsey. It has been translated into more than 50 languages.
   Dorsey's work includes more than 1,000 gospel tunes and all
would be displayed, his wife, Kathryn, said in an interview from
the couple's South Side home.
   ``I think he would think it was one of the greatest things that
ever happened,'' she said. ``It would be the only one in the United
States'' dedicated solely to Dorsey, she said.
   But efforts to raise a half-million dollars for the foundation
have faltered. A Chicago concert in December was to be the group's
first fund-raising event, but it was canceled for lack of interest.
   Storman says that while people know Dorsey's music, they don't
know Dorsey. They confuse him with Tommy Dorsey, the jazz
bandleader of the 1940s.
   In promoting Thomas Dorsey, Storman and colleagues have found
that ``people thought we were talking about the jazz artist. We had
to remind people that Tommy Dorsey had passed.'' Tommy Dorsey died
in 1956.
   Thomas Dorsey was born July 1, 1899, just outside Atlanta. His
father was sickly, and he, his mother and four siblings had to help
support the family.
   ``His mother was a very, very religious woman who had been a
profound influence on him,'' says Harris.
   ``He became enamored of a resident pianist at a local theater.
Then as a 12-year-old boy he started playing in bordellos, playing
piano, blues. By that time, he was supporting his family.''
   Dorsey later began composing blues and playing jazz and blues
piano. He adopted the stage name ``Georgia Tom.''
   He began experimenting with gospel music as a way to reconcile
an internal conflict over his religious upbringing and his early
love of blues, Harris says.
   As a young man, Dorsey moved to Chicago, and gradually began to
concentrate on composing gospel music.
   ``He was the first black man in America to publish gospel music,
in 1926,'' and started his own publishing firm at that time in
Chicago, Storman says.
   He sent his first two gospel songs, ``If You See My Saviour''
and ``How About You,'' to hundreds of churches. ``Not a single
person ordered one,'' Harris says.
   ``He spent time going from church to church trying to sell this.
The people thought it was blues, an inappropriate kind of music for
formal worship.''
   In 1931, Dorsey was devastated by the deaths of his first wife
and baby daughter in childbirth. ``That was when he wrote his
all-time great, `Take My Hand, Precious Lord,''' Storman says.
``And that was when he became totally dedicated to just doing
gospel.''
   In January 1932, at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Chicago, the Rev.
J. Howard Lorenzo Smith hired Dorsey to form a choir.
   A month later, at Pilgrim Baptist Church, the Rev. J.C. Austin
invited Smith to preach an anniversary service, Harris says. Smith
brought the choir and ``staid Pilgrim Baptist Church ... went
wild.''
   Two days later Austin offered Dorsey the job of directing his
church chorus.
   ``I was a little boy then,'' says the Rev. J.C. Austin Jr.,
Austin's son and the current minister. ``You couldn't get into the
church. The fire department came to keep the traffic moving ...
every Sunday morning.''
   Under Dorsey, the choir gained national attention, and he
remained its director until the late 1970s, when he retired.
   Dorsey, a tall, thin, distinguished-looking man, was shrewd in
his business dealings.
   ``He was self-taught, never went beyond third grade. But he took
this gospel thing and built his own publishing business out of
it,'' Harris says.
   Dorsey sold his business in the early 1950s to New York-based
Chapel Music, which has continued to publish his music, his
attorney Jay Ross says.
   Dorsey also knew how to create music that performers want to
sing.
   ``There's no comparison to him. He's in a class all by
himself,'' says gospel singer Albertina Walker.
   ``The songs that he wrote ... they have such a meaning, they
have such a message. People are forgetting Dorsey. But you really
can't forget him. He should be remembered as the father of gospel
music, the founder of gospel music.''
