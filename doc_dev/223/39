   Most people won't recognize her name, but
Helen Stearns collaborated on several songs with her brother-in-law.
   The brother-in-law was Hoagy Carmichael, who composed such
legendary songs as ``Star Dust,'' ``Lazybones,'' and ``Georgia On
My Mind.'' He died in 1981.
   ``I loved to listen to him play,'' Stearns said. ``He'd be
sitting there pecking around on the piano and he'd come up with a
tune and say, `You're the writer. Give me some words.' So I did
sometimes. We wrote a lot of songs together, mostly children's
songs.''
   ``April In My Heart'' was one of their best.
   ``I didn't think much about it at the time, but I still get
small royalty checks for it from time to time,'' she said.
   Stearns, 82, was back in Carmichael's native state over the
weekend in conjunction with a retrospective concert by the Indiana
Symphony Orchestra.
   ``You know, there's something about Hoosiers that is
wholesome,'' she said. ``No matter where they go or what they do,
they carry it with them. That's what I remember about Hoagy. He was
always wholesome in that odd Hoosier way.
   ``That, I guess, and his music were what I liked most about
him.''
   Stearns was one of the ``Barclay Girls'' who modeled for artist
McLelland Barclay in the 1930s, wrote screenplays that included the
hit 1937 movie ``I Met Him In Paris,'' and later worked as a
newspaper editor in California and Maine, and as a writer, editor
and publisher of children's books.

   Jiang Xi Reng, best known for his portrayal
of the lord chamberlain in the 1986 film ``The Last Emperor,'' is
helping to organize a theater exchange program that was delayed by
China's political crackdown.
   The exchange between the Children's Theatre Company and the
Children's Art Theatre of Shanghai had been announced last spring.
   Jiang, a 30-year veteran of the Children's Art Theatre of
Shanghai, will play the wizard Gandalf in the Children's Theatre
Company's staging of ``The Hobbit.'' The production, directed by
CTC artistic director Jon Cranney, goes into rehearsal Tuesday for
an April 20 opening.
   In May 1991, Cranney and a team of designers stage the Theater
Company's version of ``The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins'' in
Shanghai.
   The Children's Art Theatre is the oldest children's theater
company in China. It was established in 1947 by Madame Soong Ching
Ling, wife of Sun Yat-sen, founder of modern China
   The exchange is an outgrowth of meetings that took place a year
ago between Cranney and Jin An Ge, his counterpart with the
Shanghai company. Plans were shelved, however, after the June
massacre in Beijing against advocates of democracy, and the two
artistic directors did not meet again until February.
   Plans for a joint production to tour China and Japan are
incomplete.
   Because relations between the U.S. and Chinese governments
remain strained, neither company has sought government assistance.

   The first black Miss USA says she's not a
``stereotypical all-American winner,'' and being raised by a single
parent on tough streets is a handicap that can be overcome.
   ``I had not the happiest of upbringings, but you don't have to
become a statistic just because you grew up in a broken home,''
20-year-old Carole Gist told reporters Monday.
   Miss Gist, of Detroit, dreams of setting up a fine arts
institute for underprivileged children who, she says, are too often
taught to think ``the only way you can get ahead now is in sports.''
   She was chosen Friday from among 51 women competing for $200,000
in cash and prizes and the chance to represent the United States in
the 38th annual Miss Universe pageant in Hollywood on April 15.
   A junior in management and marketing at the Northwood Institute,
she said being black helped her ``stand out over all the blond,
blue-eyed women there.''
   But she said it was likely she was much different in other ways,
too.
   Raised by her mother, she moved often and sometimes lived in
rough neighborhoods.
   ``My home was broken into a lot,'' she said. ``When I was 5, I
remember seeing a burglar in my home and I was frightened to
death.''

   Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver
transplant recipient, remained in fair condition Monday two weeks
after her second liver transplant.
   Doctors said the 12-year-old girl's condition was upgraded from
serious to fair Sunday at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   Stormie, of White Settlement, Texas, received a new heart and
liver at Children's on Feb. 14, 1984, to control a condition in
which her cholesterol level was 10 times higher than normal.
   Doctors decided to implant a new liver Feb. 20 after Stormie's
first transplanted liver was damaged by hepatitis caused by an
unknown virus. Her donor heart was not affected by the disease.
