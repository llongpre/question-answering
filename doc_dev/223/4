   The 1988 Pulitzer Prize for fiction was awarded
Thursday to Toni Morrison for ``Beloved,'' a novel which was at the
center of controversy when it did not win two other major literary
prizes.
   The prize for drama went to ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' by Alfred
Uhry, which like ``Beloved'' deals with race relations in the
United States.
   The prize for general non-fiction went to Richard Rhodes for
``The Making of the Atomic Bomb.''
   The prize for biography went to David Herbert Donald for ``Look
Homeward: A Life of Thomas Wolfe,'' about the American novelist.
Donald also won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1961 for
``Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War.''
   The prize in history went to Robert V. Bruce, a professor at
Boston University, for ``The Launching of Modern American Science
1846-1876.''
   William Meredith, an award-winning poet associated with
Connecticut College, won the poetry prize for ``Partial Accounts:
New and Selected Poems.''
   The prize for music was awarded to William Bolcom, a professor
at the University of Michigan, for ``12 New Etudes for Piano.''
   The focus of attention this year was on the fiction prize, which
was awarded against a backdrop of controversy and literary politics.
   After ``Beloved'' did not win either the National Book Award or
the National Book Critics Circle Award, 48 prominent black writers
and critics signed a statement deploring Ms. Morrison's lack of
recognition.
   Because she had never won the National Book Award or the
Pulitzer Prize, said the statement, published as an open letter in
the New York Times Book Review, ``she has yet to receive the
national recognition that her five major works of fiction entirely
deserve.''
   Ms. Morrison's ``Song of Solomon'' did win the National Book
Critics Circle Award for 1977, but the two other awards are
considered more prestigious.
   ``Beloved'' is the agonizing story of a former slave in
post-Civil War Ohio who struggles to cope with the brutal death of
her daughter.
   Ms. Morrison uses flashbacks, multiple points of view and a
singularly vivid ghost to describe the emotional trauma of slavery
from the perspective of Sethe, who kills her daughter rather than
yield her to bondage.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' the drama winner, tells the story of an
irascible white woman and her black chauffeur. The play follows
their relationship over a quarter-century, ending in 1973.
   The play opened off-Broadway in April 1987 at the Playwrights
Horizons Studio Theater and later moved to a larger off-Broadway
theater where it is still running.
   ``The Making of the Atomic Bomb,'' the winner for general
non-fiction, won a National Book Award last fall in the same
category.
   Rhodes, who spent five years researching and writing the book,
said in a recent interview: ``The making of the bomb is a story on
the scale of `Moby Dick.' I don't see much of a difference between
writing fiction and fact, except, of course, that fact has to be
documented.''
