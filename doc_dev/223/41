   That masterpiece of music comedy and nostalgic
Americana, ``The Music Man,'' suffered from a lack of strong, clear
singing as the New York City Opera opened its annual season of
musical comedy.
   The acting, directing, dancing and scenery were first-rate
Tuesday at the New York State Theater. But some of the verve and
excitement of those glorious, fast-paced songs was lost during the
first act as the singing did not carry well over the orchestra.
   The problem was alleviated after intermission. Perhaps it was
the shift to mostly ballads, or perhaps the level of the singers'
microphones had been boosted, but Act 2 was the rich, delightful
experience one hopes the whole show will be for the rest of its run
through April 10.
   Bob Gunton, debuting with the company as Harold Hill, had the
most trouble. A Broadway performer, he moves as gracefully as a
dancer and sold his ``76 Trombones'' to the folks of River City
with more charm than brass. But his light voice didn't project in
Act 1's ``Ya Got Trouble'' and ``The Sadder but Wiser Girl.''
   The female chorus also was difficult to understand in
``Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little,'' and the townspeople blurred the
words of joyful anticipation in ``The Wells Fargo Wagon.'' David
Burdick, smaller than most boys who play the lisping Winthrop, also
is no belter, and didn't get his words across the footlights.
   Opera singers learn to project their voices and they came out
best, making themselves understood and never sounding too operatic
for the music. Leigh Munro was a pretty and sympathetic Marian the
librarian, Muriel Costa-Greenspon a natural leader of ladies as the
mayor's wife, Richard McKee as the pompous mayor, James Billings as
Harold Hill's cohort, Brooks Almy as Marian's mother and William
Ledbetter as the constable.
   The dancing chorus was splendid, with choreography by Marcia
Milgrom Dodge, making her company debut. There's a generous amount
of dancing, in the library, in rehearsals for a ``social,'' in the
center of town several times. David Jenkins' set of business
buildings pulled back to give the dancers room. Andrew Marlay's
costumes for 1912 were glorious, from feathered hats to peppermint
suits for the four school board members who squabbled every minute
they weren't harmonizing ``Lida Rose.''
   Donald Pippin, a Broadway conductor, was conducting at the New
York City Opera for the first time. It was wonderful to hear the
overture played by a big orchestra, less wonderful later when words
were covered.
   The late Meredith Willson wrote the book, music and lyrics. He
and Frank Lacey wrote the plot, which came out as a memory of
bygone innocent days of Mason City, Iowa, where Willson grew up.
One wonderful song follows another _ ``Goodnight, My Someone,''
``My White Knight,'' ``Till There Was You'' _ and the audience
greeted each gem like a reunion with a long-lost best friend.
