   The last time foreign correspondent Thomas L.
Friedman won a Pulitzer Prize he said the moment was marred because
he received the news while covering the bombing of the American
Embassy in Beirut.
   On Thursday, though, the second Pulitzer for international
reporting for The New York Times writer was ``unalloyed, untinged
by any tragedy,'' Friedman said as he and others winners across the
country celebrated their honors.
   In 1983, Friedman, then the Beirut bureau chief for the Times,
was told of the award he received for his stories about the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon as he was covering the embassy disaster.
   ``It was a moment very much bittersweet for someone living in
Beirut, with friends in the embassy,'' he said.
   This time, he received a telephone call from Max Frankel, the
Times' executive editor, as he worked on a book at his home in
Jerusalem.
   Champagne corks popped in newsrooms across the land.
   ``If I can win the Pulitzer Prize, the Cleveland Indians can win
the pennant this summer,'' said the Wall Street Journal's Walt
Bogdanich, who won for specialized reporting. WSJ writers Daniel
Hertzberg and James B. Stewart also won for explanatory journalism.
   ``This place looks like a locker room after a World Series
victoy,'' said Jacqui Banaszynski of the St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch newsroom after she won for feature writing for her series
on an AIDS victim in a farm community.
   Champagne also flowed at the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune, a 60,000
circulation daily in Massachusetts that won the general news
reporting prize for stories on a furloughed murderer who assaulted
a Maryland couple.
   ``This is pretty big for us. We're just a nice community
newspaper,'' said Susan Forrest, one of the Lawrence staffers who
worked on the story.
   Tom Shales of the Washington Post, the criticism winner for his
writing on television, said he was ``in a state of slack-jawed
dumbfoundness.''
   ``It's nice to be in the World Almanac permanently,'' said
Boston University historian Robert V. Bruce, who won the Pulitzer
in history for his book, ``The Launching of Modern Science
1846-1876.''
   Toni Morrison, winner of the fiction award for ``Beloved,'' said
joy was uppermost in her feelings because, ``I really was thinking
dark and difficult thoughts about what was available to this book
in terms of recognition.''
   The book sparked controversy when it did not win two other major
literary prizes. Ms. Morrison said she respected the Pulitzer
committee for ignoring ``outside matters of speculation and gossip
and some slander.''
   University of Michigan music professor William Bolcom said,
``It's better than a kick in the teeth,'' after he won the Pulitzer
for music for ``12 New Etudes for Piano,'' a tribute to the late
pianist Paul Jacobs.
   But Bolcom, who said he was disturbed by the ``prize mentality''
of the public, planned a subdued celebration.
   ``I put a bottle of champagne in the ice box,'' he said. ``The
local paper is coming over to take a picture of me sipping it.
We'll have dinner, take baths and go to bed.''
   At The Miami Herald, Pulitzers were taken home by humorist Dave
Barry and photographer Michel duCille, a second-time winner who
this time won for photos of apartments inundated by the drug crack,
a potent form of cocaine.
   ``I don't want to lessen the Pulitzers, but I feel more proud
that the photos ... made changes in the community,'' duCille said.
   Barry said he hopes winning the Pulitzer ``will make me taller.''
   He recalled he once wrote a column making fun of the Pulitzer
awards, saying that ``horrendously long, complicated''
Pulitzer-entry stories should have editor's notes warning readers
to avoid them.
   Charlotte Observer Managing Editor Mark Ethridge III said he
hoped the PTL story that brought the newspaper one of two Pulitzer
prizes was ``not a story that comes along just once in a lifetime.''
   The Observer's Doug Marlette also won a Pulitzer for his
editorial cartooning in Charlotte and at the Atlanta Constitution,
where he now works.
   Scott Shaw, a 24-year-old photographer for the Odessa (Texas)
American, said he was surprised to win the spot news award for his
coverage of the 58-hour operation that rescued little Jessica
McClure and fascinated a nation.
   ``I am pretty young. I am just pretty surprised,'' said Shaw.
