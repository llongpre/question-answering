   ``Once on This Island'' is as endearing as it is
exotic, a lush little musical set in the French Antilles but
telling a love story that has universal appeal.
   Credit director Graciela Daniele and the songwriting team of
Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty. The show, which arrived over the
weekend at off-Broadway's Playwrights Horizons, explodes with music
and motion. It never stops, thanks to Daniele's exuberant direction
and the nearly continuous use of song and dance.
   This bittersweet fairy tale, based on the novel ``My Love, My
Love,'' by Trinidad-born writer Rosa Guy, tells of the doomed
romance between a simple peasant girl and a wealthy young man. But
it's not condescending or simplistic in its treatment of the
ill-fated lovers. And Ahrens, who adapted the book and wrote the
lyrics, has come up with a leading female character an audience can
cheer. In a season of such effective but emotionally cold musicals
like ``City of Angels'' and ``Grand Hotel,'' that's something rare.
   Ti Moune is the sweetest Caribbean heroine since Ottilie, a role
played by the wonderful Diahann Carroll in Harold Arlen's ``House
of Flowers'' years ago. It's a sympathetic part played to
perfection by a performer with a dazzling smile and an unusual
name, La Chanze.
   The dark-skinned Ti Moune falls for Daniel, the mulatto son of
an island landowner, and saves his life when his sports car crashes
on a winding road. She nurses him back to health, but eventually
the barriers of class and color prove to be too much.
   In Ti Moune's quest for love, she is helped _ and occasionally
hindered _ by a quartet of rambunctious and rowdy gods, deities of
water, earth, love and death. They add a touch of supernatural to
the plot, an other-worldly quality that gives the story much of its
charm.
   The score is completely different from ``Lucky Stiff,'' a daffy,
dumb-fun musical that Ahrens and Flaherty wrote for Playwrights
Horizons several seasons ago. The title character in that show was
a corpse that refused to stay put, and the witty music reflected
the musical's farcical nature.
   Flaherty's music for ``Once on This Island'' is more expansive
and romantic. It embraces a wide range of styles from calypso, like
in the gutsy ``Mama Will Provide,'' to more traditional theater
love songs like ``Forever Yours.'' Ahrens' lyrics are unforced and
fit the music beautifully.
   Daniele has gotten strong ensemble performances from the rest of
the cast, fine singers and dancers all. Particularly effective are
Eric Riley, a sensuous demon of death, and Kecia Lewis-Evans, as a
big-voiced Earth Mother.
   The director's production team _ set designer Loy Arcenas,
costume designer Judy Dearing and lighting designer Allen Lee
Hughes _ has created an atmospheric island environment. A deep blue
set, painted with primitive trees and birds, fills the small stage
and embraces the actors.
   So does Daniele's inventive choreography which becomes an
important part of the story. The dances swirl throughout ``Once on
This Island,'' turning the stage into a tropical never-never land
that won't disappear from memory even after the curtain has fallen.
