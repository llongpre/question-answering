<TEXT>     Still, while I admire the way regional theater is maturing everywhere,
including San Jose, it's at this time of year that I get a little excited at
Broadway's and off-Broadway's expectations. It just might be worth taking on
the filth, the crime and the X-rated prices to see some of these shows.;   In
other words, hope does spring eternal on the Great White Way, and I'm a sucker
for hope.;   You will note there are too many revivals, but bright stars and
outstanding directors can hold the fort until the disgruntled writers return
from movies and television.; (check) "Babylon Gardens." Timothy Hutton and
Mary Louise Parker are co-stars in a play by Timothy Mason about a young
couple who have lost a baby. Parker was seen at Berkeley Rep a couple of years
ago in "Prelude to a Kiss." She went to Broadway with the show and won a Tony
nomination. Opens Oct. 6 at Circle Repertory (off-Broadway).;   (check) "On
Borrowed Time." George C. Scott directs and stars in this revival of the Paul
Osborn play in which a grandfather and his grandson encounter anthropomorphic
Death and give chase. Conrad Bain, Nathan Lane and Teresa Wright co-star. At
Circle in the Square, opening Oct. 10.;   (check) "Dancing at Lughnasa." A new
play by the brilliant Irish writer Brian Friel, set in 1938 Ireland. Won all
the top prizes this year in London. Tells of a missionary and five indigent
sisters. Donal Donnelly stars. At the Plymouth, opening Oct. 24.;   (check)
"Rags." The Charles Strouse/Stephen Schwartz flop of 1986 has been re-written
and revived at the American Jewish Theater, off Broadway. Former cast of 30
has been cut to seven, new songs added, the book redone. A production of the
first "Rags" had a sprightly treatment last year at Palo Alto's TheatreWorks.
Opens Nov. 2.;   (check) "Park Your Car in Harvard Yard." Israel Horvitz's
play about an elderly retired schoolteacher and his younger Irish housekeeper.
Jason Robards and Judith Ivey star, and Zoe Caldwell directs. At the Music
Box, beginning Nov. 7.;   (check) "Nick &amp; Nora." This one is heralded as the
first potential big-ticket hit of the season. It's a musical version of
Dashiell Hammett's "The Thin Man," with Barry Bostwick as Nick and Joanna
Gleason (terrific in "Into the Woods") as Nora. Charles Strouse wrote the
music; Richard Maltby Jr. wrote the lyrics and Arthur Laurents the book.
Laurents also directs. Previews begin Oct. 8, and the show opens Nov. 10 at
the Marquis. Tickets already selling fast.;   (check) "The Crucible." A
revival of the Arthur Miller drama about witch-hunting, his parable for the
McCarthy red-baiting years. This is the first production of the new National
Actors Theater repertory, of which Tony Randall is founder and artistic
director. Stars Martin Sheen and Michael York. Runs Nov. 2 to Jan. 5 at the
Belasco.;   (check) "Crazy for You." A George and Ira Gershwin musical that is
basically a revision of the 1930 hit "Girl Crazy," plus four new Gershwin
songs found in a trunk. New Gershwin songs seem to turn up every six months or
so. Opens Feb. 19 at the Shubert Theater.;   (check) "Private Lives." A
revival of the 1931 Noel Coward romantic comedy. Joan Collins and Simon Gray
star. The show will be seen in San Francisco Nov. 26 to Dec. 8 on its way to
Broadway, where it opens Feb. 20, with a theater still to be announced.
Collins played the role earlier in London. Charles H. Duggan, the Palo Alto
whiz who runs the Marines Memorial Theater in San Francisco, is producing, his
second Broadway effort. "K-2" was the first.;   (check) "Guys and Dolls." One
more time for the Frank Loesser musical, due to open March 19 with a cast yet
to be announced. It first played Broadway in 1950, with Robert Alda, Vivian
Blaine and Sam Levene. There was an all-black revival in 1976. Jerry Zaks
directs the new show.;   (check) "Conversations With My Father." The esteemed
Herb Gardner's new play. He wrote two comic classics, "A Thousand Clowns" and
"I'm Not Rappaport." "Conversations" opens March 22 at the Royale, with Daniel
Sullivan directing. Judd Hirsch plays a Russian Jewish father who owns a bar
on Canal Street in New York.;   (check) "Two Trains Running." The new August
Wilson drama is set in a 1969 Pittsburgh restaurant, where seven blacks tell
of their difficult lives. Lloyd Richards, who has directed all of Wilson's
dramas at the Yale Repertory as well as in New York, stages the play. The
production will be seen in Los Angeles in January on the way to New York,
where it opens April 13. (Richards will be in San Francisco later this month
to direct "The Piano Lesson," part of the American Conservatory Theater
season.);   Some if these dates may change and other problems ensue. But these
look like this season's highlights, with more, surely, to come.  </TEXT>
