   John Wallowitch is a sophisticated sprite of
Manhattan, an impish composer, pianist and cabaret performer who
celebrates New York and chronicles its often bizarre customs and
mores.
   He sings the music of Gershwin, Porter, Kern, Rodgers and Berlin
too, but he also performs his own compositions, usually songs about
Manhattan filtered through the sensibilities of the 1960s, '70s and
'80s. He can lament the loneliness of big-city life in ``I Live
Alone Again,'' laugh at growing old in ``I'm 27,'' or luxuriate in
the pleasures of high living in ``Back on the Town.''
   The classically trained musician sings anywhere and with little
coaxing: in his cluttered, score-strewn apartment, once the home of
actress Katharine Cornell; on his weekly cable television show; in
tiny nightspots around town, or even on the street, where his
yearly serenadings of Irving Berlin _ a Beekman Place neighbor _
have attracted more and more media attention.
   The impeccable Wallowitch, who seems always to be dressed in
white shirt and bow tie, has worked since 1984 with Bertram Ross,
once a leading dancer in Martha Graham's company.
   ``We have tons of material,'' says Wallowitch, a fanatic
collector of old sheet music. ``Three separate evenings of theater
songs, including one about New York. I could go through a year and
not repeat one song _ which I have done.''
   With Wallowitch providing piano accompaniment, Ross can launch
into obscure Berlin comic ditties like ``Cohen Owes Me 97 Dollars''
or ``Sadie Salome Go Home.'' Wallowitch can handle a tender, lush
love song, ``Come A Little Closer,'' that he wrote himself. Or the
duo can rip through virtually unknown songs from forgotten Broadway
shows like Rodgers and Hart's ``Chee-Chee.''
   Wallowitch's early world wasn't anywhere near the bright lights
of Broadway. He grew up in an isolated area of South Philadelphia,
a neighborhood across from the city dump and surrounded by gas
tanks of the Atlantic Refining Co. His father owned a butcher shop.
   Young John, the first of four children, was precocious, he
admits. After all, how many youngsters sing ``Genevieve, Sweet
Genevieve'' at the age of 3 months? In a few years, Wallowitch was
picking out tunes on his grandmother's piano, and having poems
published in a children's column of the local newspaper.
   `I guess it was desperation,'' he recalls. ``When you are born
in a neighborhood like that, you'd better do something.''
   Wallowitch did. He took piano lessons.
   Every Wednesday, the Wallowitch family would listen to the
Lithuanian Furniture Company Radio Hour. Their eldest son, wearing
knickers and anklets, made his piano debut on the program, playing
a Berlin song called ``So Help Me.''
   Wallowitch eventually became a regular on the show, usually
performing short classical pieces. His musical education continued
at Edwin Vare Junior High School, where he would sneak into the
building before classes to play a grand piano. He was caught one
day by the school's music teacher. Instead of punishment, he got
free lessons.
   He went to Temple to major in education so he could become a
high school music teacher, but was drafted.
   ``I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life,'' Wallowitch
says. ``But when I got into the Army something happened to me.''
   Each night, he went to the USO to play the piano.
   ``I became violent about it,'' Wallowitch says. ``I would push
people away from the piano and say, `I play better than you.' I was
terrible, but this was my life.''
   While in the Army, Wallowitch gave his first public performance
in front of an audience, 10,000 people in a stadium in
Jacksonville, Fla. He was to play ``Clair de lune,'' but forgot
part of the piece.
   ``I found myself talking over the microphone and pretending to
be doing a comedy routine,'' he says.
   Wallowitch, the cabaret performer, was born to great applause,
even if he was mortified about forgetting the notes.
   Wallowitch later returned to Temple and to his old high school
piano teacher. He eventually was drawn to New York to study music
at Juilliard. He was there for eight years, even getting a
post-graduate degree.
   ``To keep myself solvent, I played in tap-dancing schools and
for small dance companies,'' he says. He also entered the theater,
working as a rehearsal pianist for ``New Faces of '52,'' considered
the best of the Broadway revues of the 1950s.
   ``I was so dumb. I thought I was going to be this great concert
pianist,'' Wallowitch says. ``When you start to mix with show
people and you start to realize you have a talent in that area,
then you realize what it takes to be a concert artist and how few
people really succeed at it. There's the loneliness of that life
and the eight hours a day practicing.''
   He finally made his concert debut in October 1962 at Carnegie
Recital Hall, getting rave reviews.
   He toured Europe, under State Department sponsorship, with
actress and singer Ethel Barrymore Colt. He accompanied her
American theater songs, as well as doing his own program.
   Back in New York, he landed a job at a small Greenwich Village
nightclub. He played piano every night for six hours. He even
attempted to sing. One night, an irate customer yelled, ``Don't
sing, we want to talk.'' The next night Wallowitch came back with
an original composition, ``Who Needs Enemies When I Have a Friend
Like You'' and his songwriting career began in earnest.
   Today, Wallowitch concentrates on performing, writing only
occasionally.
   ``I can go on a writing jag because I have a lot of ideas,'' he
says. ``I store them. I feel like Ibsen, you know. He would think
about a thing for two years and then suddenly the whole thing falls
out.''
