   Historical novel ``Middle Passage,'' which
chronicles the journey of a freed African slave returning to his
homeland, won the 1990 National Book Award competition for fiction
Tuesday night.
   Charles Johnson wrote the book, which takes place in 1830 and
tells the story of a terrifying voyage to Africa on a clipper ship.
   Ron Charnow's ``The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty
and the Rise of Modern Finance'' won in the non-fiction category
during the 40th anniversary awards dinner at the Plaza Hotel.
   The competition was marked by the presence of little-known
writers from small publishing houses and ``acute dividedness''
among the jurors who chose them.
   The five fiction works that were up for consideration included
three books by immigrant authors - the first novels of Jessica
Hagedorn and Ilena Castedo, and the 42-year-old second book of
Felipe Alfau, who is 88.
   Johnson, an English professor at the University of Washington
who wrote two other novels and a collection of short fiction, was
among two established writers in the fiction category. The other
was Joyce Carol Oates.
   Johnson's novel, published by Atheneum, uses the freed slave's
difficult trip as a catalyst for self-discovery and also marks a
passage for African-American fiction. The title refers to the
crossing of the Atlantic to America from Africa by slave ships.
   ``In this decade, we will see the emergence of black-author
fiction that will help us as a people and as a culture to move from
narrow complaint to broad celebration,'' said Johnson, 42.
   One of the fiction jurors, writer Paul West, said there was
``acute dividedness over nearly everything'' discussed by the
five-member panel that chose the nominees. He charged that ``ethnic
considerations, ideology and moral self-righteousness'' had
prevailed over style and merit.
   But Sonny Mehta, president of Alfred A. Knopf publishers, said
although the list of nominees was obscure, he saw nothing
``sinister'' in the choices.
   ``It looks as if they were looking around for books that have
not had their share of praise,'' Mehta said.
   In the non-fiction category, the four other finalists were books
about teaching, former President Nixon, artist Jackson Pollock and
Roosevelt Cabinet member Harold Ickes.
   Chernow's winner was published by Atlantic Monthly
Press-Entrekin Books. The book traces the ups and downs of the most
influential family in the history of American banking. It charts
the Morgan family's story and the changing relationships between
financiers and companies since 1838.
   ``My motivation for writing the book started with my concern
with what was happening in the 1980s,'' said Chernow, 41, of
Brooklyn Heights.
   He said 19th century bankers had ``a very different notion of
what business was, it was a gentlemen's club against today's wild
carnival of greed.''
   The National Books Foundation also honored Saul Bellow, Nobel
laureate and the only three-time winner of the National Book Award.
   The 10 finalists came from among 375 books put forward by 72
publishers. For the first time in years, none came from such
prestigious houses as Knopf; Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux; or Simon &amp;
Schuster.
   Alfau's book, ``Chromos,'' was retrieved from oblivion by Dalkey
Archive Press, an Illinois publisher whose list amounts to about 15
titles a year and whose biggest seller has been a novel that sold
6,000 copies.
   The Spanish-born Alfau had his first novel, ``Locos: A Comedy of
Gestures,'' published in 1936. It was rediscovered and reissued
last year by Dalkey. When the publisher asked whether Alfau had
written anything else, he came up with ``Chromos,'' which he
finished in 1948.
   Castedo's ``Paradise'' was published by Grove Weidenfeld and
Hagedorn's ``Dogeaters'' by Pantheon, which has been warring with
its parent company, Random House, over Pantheon's tradition of
against-the-grain publishing.
   Atheneum brought out Johnson's ``Middle Passage'' and the Oates
book, ``Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart,'' came
from E.P. Dutton-William Abrahams.
   The other non-fiction finalists were:
   ``Small Victories: The Real World of a Teacher, Her Students and
Their High School,'' by Samuel G. Freedman.
   ``Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician,''
by Roger Morris.
   ``Jackson Pollock: An American Saga,'' by Steven Naifeh and
Gregory White Smith.
   ``Righteous Pilgrim: The Life and Times of Harold L. Ickes,
1874-1952,'' by T.H. Watkins.
