<TEXT>     Spangenberg Auditorium is at 780 Arastradero Road, Palo Alto. Admission is
$8; students and seniors are $5. (415) 858-1254 or (415) 354-8264.; AN URBAN
SETTING FOR REAL COWBOYS; David Plotnikoff; YOU probably won't catch any John
Travolta wanna-bes hangin' out at the Iron Cowboy Club on Saturday. The Club
(a long-running series of free country and western gigs run by roots-rock
impresario Cammy Blackstone) caters to urban cowpokes of a radically different
stripe. It's the alternative rock scene's version of a honky-tonk hoedown --
South Fork meets South of Market.;    Saturday, the club convenes at
Bouncer's, a broad-shouldered, blue-collared waterfront dive of redoubtable
character at 64 Townsend St., between the Embarcadero and Second Street in San
Francisco. It would be tough to beat this no-cover double bill with both hands
and a big stick: San Jose's own Diablos (this season's darlings of the
Paradise Lounge scene), teamed with Jerry Shelfer, a tough-as-leather former
Marine with a tender spot for country ballads. (415) 397-2480.; CAHN'S
WONDERFUL WORDS AND MUSIC; -- Murry Frymer; SAMMY Cahn is back.;    Sammy is
that delightful lyricist who does a full evening of "and-then-I-wrote"
material that has proved to be a winner twice in San Francisco in the last
three years.;    Cahn returns to the Marines Memorial Theater with his "Words
and Music" show. He doesn't have much of a voice, but nobody sings a song the
way the guy who wrote it sings a song. And that is the special charm. That,
along with stories about how the songs were written and who sang them when.;  
 The show begins with a preview Monday, opens Tuesday and runs three weeks
through March 10. Tickets $20 to $32. (415) 771-6900.; ARTWORK INSPIRED BY
PAST MASTERS; -- Dorothy Burkhart; APPROPRIATION may be the name of the game,
but New Yorker Sherrie Levine "borrows" better than anyone, including Mike
Bidlo, who fakes Pollocks and Picassos.;    Ten years ago Levine was
photographing reproductions of classic photos by Edward Weston and Walker
Evans. Next came tastefully framed color photographs of art book reproductions
of paintings by early modern masters like Monet, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and
Egon Schiele.;     Now, in her sculptural installation at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art (through March 31), Levine takes her cue from Man Ray's
1938 painting "La Fortune," which pictures a billiard table.;    In one large
gallery Levine has lined up six custom-made, 19th-century-style mahogany pool
tables. A green felt cloth covers the tabletop, upon which sit three billiard
balls -- one red, two white. On a formal level, this impressive and beautiful
work blends the precision of Vermeer and the minimalism of Donald Judd.;    In
this and other works, Levine demolishes modernist myths, challenges
originality in art and makes sly feminist statements, too.;    The museum, at
401 Van Ness Ave., is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and
Fridays; to 9 p.m. Thursdays; 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekends. $4, $2 seniors,
children under 12 free. Free the first Tuesday of every month. (415)
863-8800.; CHILDREN'S MUSIC HITS CENTER STAGE; -- Harry Sumrall; AS THE baby
boomers have begun to sprout babies of their own, the children's music scene
has become a potent force. Not music by children, but music for children.;   
And at the top of the list of children's performers is the group Sharon, Lois
and Bram (Canadian vocalist Raffi was No. 1 until he gave up his crown
recently to compete in the adult market). In the past 12 years, the trio has
sold more than 2 million records and the "Sharon, Lois and Bram Elephant Show"
is broadcast daily to 47 million homes on Nickelodeon.;    A key to the trio's
success is that it never plays down to children, instead opting for a fairly
sophisticated sound that includes rock and folk and that educates as it
entertains. With its new disc "Sing A to Z," Sharon, Lois and Bram highlight
the letters of the alphabet in traditional and contemporary songs and rhymes.;
   The group makes its way to the Bay Area on Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the San
Jose Center for The Performing Arts, 255 Almaden Blvd., San Jose. Also 7 p.m.
Feb. 27 at the Paramount Theater, 2025 Broadway, Oakland. Tickets $13.50.
(408) 998-2277 or (415) 762-2277.; STORYTELLERS OF A DIFFERENT SORT; -- Judith
Green; EVERYONE loves a good story, and two very different storytellers are on
tap this weekend.;    Karen Finley, one of four performance artists turned
down for a fellowship at the height of the National Endowment for the Arts
flap, reads from her new book, "Shock Treatment," at 9 tonight in the ballroom
of the Student Union at San Jose State University.;    The title is no
exaggeration. Finley's subject is violence against women, and she uses bodily
fluids as the ink in her pen to write four-letter words. Admission is $8 in
advance, $10 at the door, with $1 off for students. (408) 924-6374.;    Brenda
Wong Aoki delves into her Chinese, Japanese and American roots for "Tales of
the Pacific Rim," a program for children in words and movement. She performs
at 2 p.m. Saturday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Stanford University. Tickets are
$6, $4 children. (415) 725-2787.  </TEXT>
