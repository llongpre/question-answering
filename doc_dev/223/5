   Toni Morrison struggled through 200 years of
history to write a small story that would deeply touch those who
read her spellbinding novel, ``Beloved,'' winner of this year's
Pulitzer Prize for fiction.
   ``I was only aware of how difficult it was to do and how fearful
it was for me because it required living there all those years,''
Morrison said in an interview Thursday. ``About the fourth, fifth,
sixth or seventh revisions I began to see the authority and maybe
the surrender. And when the language arrived I felt this very deep
pleasure and a feeling that I could serve both characters well.''
   The book, which quickly climbed best-seller lists when it was
published last year by Alfred A. Knopf Inc., is based on a true
account of an escaped slave named Margaret Garner who decided to
kill her child rather than see her returned to bondage.
   It was a chilling choice faced by many during the horrors of
slavery; some Africans chose suicide during the crossing on slave
ships, while others killed children or wives before leaving the
continent.
   In rich, riveting language, Morrison tells the tale of Sethe,
who escapes from Kentucky and struggles to survive in post-Civil
War Ohio in a house haunted by her dead baby.
   ``I had made myself a promise that I would not hunt for a
story,'' Morrison said. ``I wanted the book to find me. I was also
weary of taking on a writing project just because I was a writer; I
wanted it to be something that was driven.''
   Morrison, 57, who grew up in Lorain, Ohio, had heard the Garner
story, and found herself curious and puzzled by the woman.
   ``It seemed to me that was ... worth a text,'' she said. ``I got
very frustrated while writing, and each time I felt I couldn't
write it. And then I felt that if I couldn't do it justice, then it
would be like the slave owners had won.''
   However, the author of ``Song of Solomon,'' which won the
National Book Critics Circle Award for 1977, ``Tar Baby'' and the
play ``Dreaming Emmett,'' said ``Beloved'' is the best writing
she's done.
   She's reluctant, though, to call it the Great American Novel.
   ``I shied away from giving myself labels like great,'' the
author said. ``But it certainly is an American novel because I
think American literature is coherent and American history is
coherent only when black history is in it. So it becomes American
in that sense because it completes something.''
   Morrison, a graduate of Howard and Cornell universities and a
former editor at Random House, lives near Nyack, N.Y., in the
Hudson River Valley, and teaches at the State University of New
York at Albany.
   Morrison, who had written her other books while still an editor,
left her job at Random in 1983 to work on ``Beloved.''
   ``The quality of the work improved enormously,'' she said. ``I
had time _ not just writing time, but novel time. Novels don't
emerge in the chronological time of human beings; you have to give
it its own time.
   ``That's six years between the last one in 1981 and this one.
Three of those years was writing and revising and at least a year
and a half was spent thinking, clarifying things.''
   Morrison felt ``kind of a redemption'' on winning the Pulitzer
because of the controversy and literary politics surrounding the
prize.
   After ``Beloved'' did not win either the National Book Award or
the National Book Critics Circle Award, 48 prominent black writers
and critics signed a statement deploring the celebrated writer's
lack of recognition.
   There was the feeling the Pulitzer fiction committee might
succumb to pressure and give Morrison the award, which saddened her
because she wanted ``Beloved'' judged for its own literary value,
not because its author is black.
   ``Joy is uppermost because I really was thinking dark and
difficult thoughts about what was available to this book in terms
of recognition,'' she said. ``I never had any doubt that it was
worth first-rate consideration and recognition, but I did not
believe that that alone _ that its sheer merit was going to be the
sole criterion.
   ``My second feeling is my respect for the difficulties the
committee chose to ignore _ the outside matters of speculation and
gossip.''
