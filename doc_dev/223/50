   Ira Levin, a novelist and playwright whose
thrillers and mysteries have spiced the stage and bookstores for
years, notes wistfully that ``comedy comes easiest.''
   But book editors ask for thrillers, not comedies, Levin says.
   ``I always have to watch myself,'' he says. Very often when I'm
writing scary stuff, I find I can't resist a little joke. I
eventually edit it out. Sometimes I'll write a good one down and
hope a place will show up for it. It rarely does. A joke usually
springs out of the situation and characters.''
   His current off-Broadway offering is ``Cantorial,'' in which the
audience never sees the cantor. They only hear him singing, a
singing ghost.
   Not a new twist for Levin, who has written about the
supernatural before. But unlike his best-known novel, ``Rosemary's
Baby,'' this play's ghost is benign. All he does is sing. But his
songs are directed to a young couple that has taken up residence in
a former Manhattan synagogue. The ghostly voice wants their
furniture out of the living room. He wants it to be a synagogue
again.
   Levin's other novels include ``A Kiss Before Dying,'' ``The
Stepford Wives'' and ``The Boys from Brazil.'' His plays range from
the comedy ``No Time for Sergeants'' in 1955 to ``Deathtrap'' in
1978, Broadway's longest-running thriller.
   ``For a while I would go back and forth between a play and a
book,'' Levin says. ``At this point, I'd like to do more books.
It's hard to get a play on. It takes so long. It was easier in the
old days.''
   ``Cantorial'' was presented three years ago in Stamford, Conn.
``There were problems with it,'' Levin says. ``I put it on the
shelf. Then I did a complete rewrite. I felt I had found the
problems with it so it was kind of exciting to get it right.''
   He doesn't mind that it's being presented off-Broadway instead
of on and is pleased at its success there. ``We're hoping it's
going to have a good, long, healthy run. So far it is doing very
nicely. The audience seems to be building, from word-of-mouth.''
   Levin doesn't want potential playgoers to think ``Cantorial,''
with the young man in it adopted and thinking he may be Jewish, is
only for Jews. ``I think non-Jewish people seem to respond to it,
if anything, more warmly than Jewish audience members. Partly, I
think they're relieved they've enjoyed it.
   ``I always intended it for a mainstream audience. We all are
looking for roots and family warmth, even those of us who've had
it. It's nice to have that sense of recapturing it.''
   Levin plunged into writing full time after New York University,
where he majored in English. A TV script he wrote for a competition
was bought by NBC.
   ``That was enough to encourage my parents to let me stay home
and write,'' he says. ``I wrote a few more TV plays that sold. I
wrote a few that didn't. I wrote my first book, `A Kiss Before
Dying,' then I went out looking for work. Before I could find a job
the book had been accepted by Simon and Schuster, so I officially
became a writer. I've never held an honest job.
   ``That's unless you count two years in the Army. Even there I
managed to write training films.''
   Levin, who is divorced and has three grown sons, lives in a
Manhattan apartment with a grand piano and a big, black coffee
table with a big black box in the center. It's a TV projector for a
10-foot screen which pulls down from the ceiling. Consequently he
doesn't read much anymore.
   ``The architect who did the apartment talked me into it. I've
got my own movie theater, which I always wanted as a child. I've
really gotten hooked on TV. It has even made a baseball fan of me,
which I never was.'' The study where he writes is partitioned from
the living room by a wall of glass bricks.
   ``I tend to be a workaholic,'' he says. ``When I really get into
something, I wake up earlier and earlier and work later and later.
After a few days I can't tell the fictional world from the real
world.''
   Years ago, Levin made a list of interesting settings for novels
or plays. A haunted synagogue was on the list.
   ``One day it dawned on me it should be haunted by a cantor, not
somebody banging around in chains,'' he says. ``I thought cantorial
singing would be interesting; it's unusual to hear in a theater.
That's how I got started. Then the synagogue became a former
synagogue. The singing obviously made it a play instead of a
novel.''
   ```The Boys from Brazil' was always a novel idea because these
boys would have to be cropping up in different countries.''
   Levin never has written a screenplay. ``Any idea I got could be
a play or a novel first,'' he says. ``I might as well do it that
way and please myself rather than write a screenplay that has to
please 100 people on the coast.
   ``I was going to do `Deathtrap,' then the thought of writing the
whole thing over again got to be a chore. I was sorry afterward. I
wasn't that happy with the screenplay that was done.''
   But he liked ``Rosemary's Baby.''
   ``It's probably the most faithful movie adaptation that has ever
been made,'' he says. ``Roman Polanski directed it and wrote the
screenplay. It was the first movie he'd made that wasn't based on
his own original material. I don't think he knew he had a right to
change things.''
