STAGE WEEK: 'ON THE TOWN' REVIVED IN PASADENA

Forty-six years ago, pals Leonard Bernstein, Jerome Robbins, Betty Comden and 
Adolph Green got together and decided to put on a show. Bernstein, of course, 
would do the music, Robbins the choreography, Comden and Green the book and 
lyrics. The result of that youthful collaboration was "On the Town," a 
high-spirited World War II-set romp about three sailors' New York adventures 
during a 24-hour leave. 
</P>
<P>
Unproduced locally for the past 31 years, the California Music Theatre revives 
the musical -- and its most famous song, "New York, New York (It's a Hell of a 
Town)" -- at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, beginning Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We wrote it in four or five months, which is very fast," recalled Green from 
his New York home. "It just all fell into place," added Comden. "It was 
everyone's first show, and I guess we didn't know any better." The husband and 
wife also wrote parts for themselves in the show -- as Claire de Loon and Ozzie 
-- which they played for over a year on Broadway. "We auditioned for (director) 
George Abbott just like any other actor," Comden noted. "Well, maybe not like 
any other actor . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Although the musical's setting stays rooted in the '40s, Green believes it has 
aged well. "There's been no show quite like it since," he said. "It's madcap, 
energy-packed, a young people's show, a Leonard Bernstein score, comedy with 
tragedy. There's that whole undercurrent of the wartime thing, the poignancy of 
that, of people parting." They feel the subsequent Gene Kelly movie (which they 
wrote) missed that youthful vigor. "It could never take the place of the play," 
Green remarked. 
</P>
<P>
Though the show hasn't been visible locally (CMT star Lorna Patterson cites the 
demanding dance numbers as the reason), Comden and Green have noticed a recent 
increase of interest in the musical. In addition to reports of overseas 
stagings and a "lovely" production they saw last year at Washington's Arena 
Stage, a big chunk of "On the Town" is featured in the Tony Award-winning 
"Jerome Robbins' Broadway." Said Green proudly, "It's keeping the show alive."

THEATER BUZZ: When Bruce Adler (of the Yiddish-English revue "Those Were The 
Days" at the Westwood Playhouse) was a baby, his parents, Henrietta Jacobson 
and Julius Adler, were stars of the Yiddish-American theater. One of their 
co-stars was a handsome young actor named Bernie Schwartz, who would often 
babysit the infant Bruce on his nights off. Then one day, Bernie was gone. 
"Enough of this Yiddish stuff," said his farewell note, "I'm going to 
Hollywood." And so he did . . . and became Tony Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Howard Korder's contemporary spiritual odyssey, "Search 
&amp; Destroy," is playing at South Coast Repertory. David Chambers directs. 
</P>
<P>
Said The Times' Sylvie Drake: "It's impossible not to compare Korder's language 
to David Mamet's, but only in an effort to impart a sense of flavor. The words 
are Korder's alone, as is the play . . . Rarely has a production come together 
as seamlessly as this one." 
</P>
<P>
In the Daily News, Daryl H. Miller felt the play "leaves the viewer intrigued 
but vaguely unsatisfied. Korder needs to do some more searching if this play is 
to become the jolting examination of American life that it is capable of 
becoming . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Daily Variety's Kathleen O'Steen wrote: "This new work from the author of 
'Boys' Life' should more likely be considered a work in progress. As it now 
stands, Korder fails to brings any enlightenment to a rather one-dimensional 
story . . . " 
</P>
<P>
From Tom Titus in the Daily Pilot: "The American dream assumes nightmarish 
proportions in (this) darkly hilarious study in avarice that reaches out for 
the throats of its audience . . . At the heart of this gripping cynical 
exercise is Mark Harelik's stunning interpretation of Mirkheim."
