   Last fall New York had one big musical _ ``Legs
Diamond'' _ to look forward to before the New Year. Its flop at a
loss of some $5 million sent shivers down Shubert Alley, the heart
of the Broadway theater district.
   Was the Broadway musical on its last ``Legs''? It doesn't look
like that now. The 1989-90 Broadway season could be the best for
musicals in years.
   Eight musicals, including three revivals, are scheduled to open
before Jan. 1 with several potential blockbusters, such as Andrew
Lloyd Webber's ``Aspects of Love'' and ``Annie 2,'' set to arrive in
the spring. It's the largest number in more than five years.
   And the appearance of such stars as Dustin Hoffman in ``The
Merchant of Venice,'' Rex Harrison in ``The Circle'' by W. Somerset
Maugham and Vanessa Redgrave in Tennessee Williams' ``Orpheus
Descending'' undoubtedly will bring theatergoers to the box office
for plays, too.
   The influx of new shows has created a booking jam for the more
desirable theaters. Many of them already are occupied with
long-running shows such as ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Les
Miserables'' and ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway.'' Many hard-to-book
theaters have found tenants. For the first time in five years, the
Belasco Theater, a gem-like but virtually ignored playhouse on West
44th Street, has been booked for a commercial offering.
   The fall season gets under way Sept. 14 at the Circle in the
Square with a revival of ``Sweeney Todd,'' the Stephen Sondheim
musical about the murderous barber of Fleet Street. Bob Gunton plays
the title role and Beth Fowler is his assistant who bakes the
victims into meat pies. The production is an adaptation of a highly
acclaimed version done last spring at the tiny York Theater Company,
one of off-off-Broadway's more enterprising theater troupes.
   ``Dangerous Games,'' two tango tales of passion and politics,
arrives Oct. 19 at the Nederlander Theater. Directed and
choreographed by Graciela Daniele, the dance-theater piece has music
by Astor Piazzolla and lyrics by William Finn, who wrote ``March of
the Falsettos.''
   Director-choreographer Tommy Tune returns to the original Vicki
Baum novel rather than the 1932 MGM film for his musical version of
``Grand Hotel.'' The show's music and lyrics are by Robert Wright
and George Forrest, the men responsible for such hits as ``Song of
Norway'' and ``Kismet.'' Set in Berlin in the late 1920s, the
musical stars Liliane Montevecchi, Karen Akers, Michael Jeter, David
Carroll and Jane Krakowski. It opens Oct. 29 at the Martin Beck
Theater.
   One day later, ``The Prince of Central Park'' premieres at the
Belasco Theater. The musical stars Gloria DeHaven, in her first
Broadway appearance in nearly 35 years, as a woman who befriends a
12-year-old runaway in Central Park.
   Hollywood is the source of ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' a stage
version of the famous 1945 Judy Garland musical that produced such
hits as ``The Trolley Song,'' ``The Boy Next Door'' and ``Have
Yourself a Very Merry Christmas.'' Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin have
augmented their movie score with new songs. Donna Kane plays the
Garland role and the other stars include George Hearn, Charlotte
Moore and Milo O`Shea. The show opens Nov. 2 at the Gershwin Theater.
   Rock star Sting will make his Broadway debut as Mack the Knife in
a new adaptation of ``3 Penny Opera,'' opening Nov. 5 at the
Lunt-Fontanne Theater. The Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical will be
directed by John Dexter, who won a Tony for his direction of ``M.
Butterfly.'' Also in the cast are Maureen McGovern, Georgia Brown
and Alvin Epstein.
   The 30th anniversary production of ``Gypsy,'' the story of how
child star Baby Louise became stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, opens Nov. 19
at the St. James Theater after an extensive national tour. Tyne Daly
has traded in her badge from ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' to play Mama Rose,
Gypsy's indomitable mother. The Jule Styne-Stephen Sondheim-Arthur
Laurents musical also stars Crista Moore as the young stripper.
   Composer Cy Coleman, who suffered the worst flop of his career
with ``Welcome to the Club'' last season, tries again this year with
``City of Angels,'' a 1940s detective musical set in Los Angeles.
David Zippell wrote the lyrics and Larry Gelbart the book for the
show which premieres Dec. 7 at the Virginia Theater. It stars Rene
Auberjonois, Gregg Edelman, Randy Graff and James Naughton.
   Vanessa Redgrave starts the parade of big stars in plays with her
arrival Sept. 24 in ``Orpheus Descending,'' the Williams play that
later became the Marlon Brando movie ``The Fugitive Kind.''
Co-starring with Miss Redgrave are Kevin Anderson, Tammy Grimes and
Anne Twomey.
   Larry Gelbart, one of the men behind ``M-A-S-H,'' tries his hand
at more contemporary politics with ``Mastergate,'' a comedy about
the Iran-Contra scandal. It opens Oct. 12 at the Criterion Center.
   In October, Broadway will also see ``Tru,'' a one-man show based
on the life of Truman Capote. The play, written by Jay Presson
Allen, stars Robert Morse as the irrepressible writer. Its opening
date and theater have not been set.
   David Hare, whose last Broadway play, ``Plenty,'' made a star of
Kate Nelligan, returns with his latest work, ``Secret Rapture,'' the
story of a messy romance. His play stars Blair Brown, Frances Conroy
and Mary Beth Hurt. It opens Nov. 6 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater
after an engagement off-Broadway at the New York Shakespeare
Festival Public Theater.
   Rex Harrison co-stars with Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger in
the 1921 W. Somerset Maugham comedy ``The Circle,'' coming to the
Ambassador Theater on Nov. 20.
   Also opening in November is Aaron Sorkin's ``A Few Good Men,'' a
play about two Marines accused of murdering a third soldier. It
stars Tom Hulce and opens at the Music Box Theater at a date to be
determined.
   Finishing out the month will be Tom Stoppard's ``Artist
Descending a Staircase,'' arriving Nov. 30 at the Helen Hayes
Theater.
   The big December opening will be Peter Hall's production of ``The
Merchant of Venice,'' starring Dustin Hoffman as Shylock and
Geraldine James as Portia. Hoffman received mixed reviews in London
but has decided to do a New York run. An opening is set for Dec. 14
at the 46th Street Theater.
   Also in December, the Lincoln Center Theater Company will begin
its season with a revival of Paddy Chayefsky's ``The Tenth Man.'' An
opening date has not been set.
   And waiting to open after Jan. 1 will be Maggie Smith in
``Lettice and Lovage,'' Peter Shaffer's portrait of a spinster tour
guide, and August Wilson's ``The Piano Lesson,'' set in Pittsburgh
in 1937, scheduled to arrive April 16. Also planned for April is the
Steppenwolf Theater Company's acclaimed adaptation of John
Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath.''
