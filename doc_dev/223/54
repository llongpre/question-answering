   Jamie Kalven spent a decade shaping a book out of
1,000-page manuscript and a mountain of raw material _ the
unfinished life's work of his father, a legal scholar.
   Although Harry Kalven died with his task incomplete, he helped
his son see it through.
   The result is ``A Worthy Tradition,'' a 700-page act of filial
devotion, a scholarly essay on the First Amendment and how its
protections were broadened by the Supreme Court between World War I
and the early 1970s.
   ``Almost everything I know about my father's views of the Fiame after
his death,'' said Kalven, who is not a lawyer.
   The First Amendment, his father said, has been continually
enriched and elaboraterst
Amendment cd by the ongoing dialogue of society and
courts addressing the countless issues it embraces.
   Among the book's central themes is an argument that criticism of
the government or its officials _ seditious libel _ should never be
a crime.
   ``A Worthy Tradition'' was published this year by Harper &amp; Row
and sells for $35. The book bears the elder Kalven's name as author
with a notation that his son edited it.
   Harry Kalven was a noted legal scholar at the Universiteatle.
   McCartney played piano, sang harmony and was producer of the song
``T-shirt'' on the Nashville band's current album of the same name.
   ``They are probably the first rock 'n' roll band I remember,''
McCartney said in a promotional videotape for the Crickets. ``I've
always been a fan of theirs.''
   The McCartney-Crickets collaboration, done at McCartney's
recording studio in England, evolved from the Crickets' appearance
two years ago at McCartney's annual Buddy Holly Week celebration. At
that time, the ex-Beatle said he was interested in working with the
group.
   The album is the first in about 10 years for the Crickets, whose
name inspired McCartney and John Lennon to name their band after
another insect.
   ``It is basic rock 'n' roll with three pieces (instruments),''
says Cricket Jerry ``J.I.'' Allison, a drummer. ``It's basically
what we did back in the '50s.''
   Allison, Holly and Joe B. Mauldin, who is still a member, founded
the Crickets in Lubbock, Texas, in 1957. They were known for such
hits as ``Peggy Sue,'' ``That'll Be the Day'' and ``Maybe Baby.''
   Holly died on Feb. 3, 1959, with Ritchie Valens and J.P. ``Big
Bopper'' Richardson when a tour plane they were flying in crashed in
a Iowa cornfield. The pilot also perished.
   Holly's life was the subject of the 1979 movie, ``The Buddy Holly
Story'' starring Gary Busey. Valens' life was recounted in the
recent motion picture ``La Bamba.'' Los Lobos did a version of the
traditional Mexican song Valens had made into a hit, ``La Bamba,''
and made it a No. 1 tune on the record charts in 1987.
   Allison and Mauldin were not with Holly when the plane crashed
because Holly had moved from Texas to New York City and was using
new members of his band.
   The two performed occasionally as Crickets in the 1960s, but did
not really get back together until 10 years ago. At that time, they
began performing as Crickets again as the opening act for country
music star Waylon Jennings, who had been accompanying Holly on the
concert tour when he was killed. In fact, Jennings gave up his seat
on the plane to the Big Bopper.
   The third current Cricket is Gordon Payne, lead vocalist and
guitarist, who joined in 1985.
   Payne admits he doesn't sound like Holly. ``I've tried, but I
don't,'' he said of the former bandleader's style.
   The band plays an equal amount of new and old material, though
the album is new songs. They close their concerts with ``That'll Be
the Day.''
   ``It was our first song and got us started and out of Texas,''
Allison recalled. ``It seems to be the most familiar one to all the
people.''
   In the past year, the three have performed throughout the United
States and Europe and in Australia and Canada. A tour of Japan is in
the works for 1989.
   Allison said the Crickets played in garages in Lubbock in the
1950s, but did not take their name from a cricket they heard
chirping as portrayed in the movie about Holly. Instead, they were
inspired by another band called the Spiders.
   ``We thought insects were a neat name. We got a list from
somewhere and decided to pick another insect,'' Allison said.
   He said Holly's legacy is that ``he showed that you don't have to
be a real `pretty boy' or that you don't have to have a lot of money
to entertain or have a rock 'n' roll band.
   ``It showed a lot of people that you could get up and write some
songs and play and not have a whole bunch of publicity behind you.
We sort of wrote the songs ourselves and produced them ourselves. He
wasn't your idol-looking kind of guy you'd see in Photoplay. He just
wanted to sing and play,'' he said.
   ``It was simple music, uncomplicated so anybody could pick it up.
I've heard that anybody could go get a guitar on Saturday night and
learn `That'll Be the Day' and those three-chord songs and have 'em
a little group. Before that, it seemed harder.''
   Said Payne: ``He sang with such feeling and intensity. Even Bruce
Springsteen says he listens to old Crickets' records to `keep it
honest.' He left behind a mold for other singers: what you're
supposed to try to do.''
   Mauldin, the Crickets' bass player, said he didn't try to
interfere with McCartney's work on their album. ``He asked for
suggestions. My answer was usually, `Whatever you think, Paul. '''
