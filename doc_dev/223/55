   There should be room on Broadway for a brash,
boisterous musical that doesn't aspire to more than a few laughs
and a good time.
   But ``Welcome to the Club,'' the new Cy Coleman-A.E. Hotchner
musical, sets its sights low and delivers just that. If it weren't
for Coleman's thoroughly professional score, ``Welcome to the
Club'' would be the most horizontal musical in town.
   The setting is a New York City alimony jail, and the subject is
divorce. Four men and one woman _ a country-western star not unlike
Dolly Parton _ languish in this prison for nonpayment of alimony.
   Hotchner, best known for his autobiography of Ernest Hemingway,
has devised the most minimal of stories, a collection of stock
situations that emphasize crude and rude stereotypes, not people.
   There's the Jewish drugstore owner, played by the ever-mugging
Avery Schreiber. His gorgon of a wife (Marilyn Sokol) wants his
money so she can find happiness in Miami Beach. He plans to escape
to Brazil where American law can't reach him.
   Another member of the club is an insurance man whose wife
suffers from ``B-mania'' caused by excessive shopping at such
places as Bergdorf's, Bendel's, Bonwit Teller and B. Altman's.
   Then there's the cynical writer getting back at his wife by
putting her in his latest magazine article. And of course, the plot
needs the naive young couple whose marriage is falling apart
because of a meddling mother-in-law.
   The best thing about ``Welcome to the Club'' is Coleman's score.
The man who wrote ``Sweet Charity,'' ``Little Me'' and ``Barnum''
is an expert craftsman, capable of the breeziest of melodies. If
anything makes this musical move, it's the music.
   His score is a series of pastiches that includes a
country-western lament, a Rossini-like number for the entire cast,
a sexy, double entendre song and one of those big, belting ballads
_ here called ``The Name of Love'' _ that can rouse any audience to
applause. Of the other numbers, a sweet love song called ``At My
Side'' also lingers after the show. It is done with charming
innocence by Scott Waara and Jodi Benson, the young lovers.
   The show has been cast with strong performers. The classiest is
Marcia Mitzman, playing the writer's ex-wife. She manages to
project a sympathy that isn't apparent in the book. Terri White
growls her way through the blues-tinged ``Piece of Cake'' and then
doesn't have anything to do for the rest of the show.
   Sally Mayes wails effectively as the country singer done wrong,
and she has an amusing musical battle with Scott Wentworth as they
sing about the merits and demerits of the North and South.
   Hotchner's book collapses in Act 2, forcing Coleman to devise
numbers that kill time rather than advance the plot. The ending
also is unsatisfactory. For a musical about divorce, it's strange
that almost everybody ends up back together at the final curtain.
   Despite Coleman's flavorsome score, ``Welcome to the Club'' is a
bargain-basement revue masquerading as a musical.
   In other New York reviews, Frank Rich wrote in The New York
Times that the play ``offers less in the way of gritty domestic
reality than most television commercials for leading headache
remedies. Reflecting the absence of credible characters or drama or
emotions, Mr. Hotchner's book dispenses with scenes and story for
idle song cues.''
   ``This show was a miscalculation from the very second it was
conceived,'' wrote Howard Kissel in the Daily News. ``... A full
evening of spitefulness and recriminations is unimaginably gross.''
   Clive Barnes wrote in the New York Post: ``There are just so
many jokes or joke-variants available about wives, mother-in-laws,
divorce and assorted marital unhappenings that Hotchner can make,
and he probably makes most of them. But this remains a one-joke
revue in search of a story.''
