<TEXT>
   Dame Daphne du Maurier, who became one of the
century's most popular writers by mixing romance and the
supernatural in ``Rebecca'' and other novels, died in her sleep
today at age 81.
   The author of such popular classics as ``Frenchman's Creek'' and
``The Birds'' died at her home in the village of Par, in Cornwall,
southwest England, said Monty Baker-Munton, her executor. He did
not know the cause of death.
   ``Rebecca,'' her most famous work, was published in 1938. It was
filmed starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, and was
reprinted 39 times, selling more than 1 million copies in hard
cover alone.
   Born in London on May 13, 1907, du Maurier was one of three
daughters of the renowned actor Sir Gerald du Maurier. She was
educated by tutors in Paris and at 21 published her first articles
and short stories. Her first novel, ``The Loving Spirit'' in 1931,
captivated a young British army major, Frederick A.M. Browning, who
courted and married her in 1932.
   Widowed in 1965, du Maurier had for many years lived a secluded
existence on the wild Cornish coast that inspired the settings for
many of her works. She shunned publicity. She spent the better part
of her life writing best-sellers in Menabilly, the family mansion
on the Cornish coast.
   Baker-Munton said that at du Maurier's request her funeral would
be private, with no memorial service or flowers, and only close
family and friends attending. He said she would be cremated.
