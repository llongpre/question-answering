Group therapy. The mood is edgy, tentative -- a little hopeful, a little 
combative. The psychologist eyes her five patients. Who wants to go first? 
Suddenly, one of the women opens her mouth . . . and begins to sing. 
</P>
<P>
"There are probably very few group therapies where people actually break into 
song," said Doug Haverty, whose "Roleplay" is at The Group Repertory Theatre in 
North Hollywood. (Haverty wrote the book, Adryan Russ wrote the music and they 
both wrote the lyrics.) But convention was never a consideration for this duo. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in group therapy, and I started to see the dramatic possibilities of 
re-creating that as a musical," said Russ, 46, who became pals with Haverty 
when both were classmates in the Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. "I'd begun to work on it by myself, but I was having 
a hard time, because I'm not a book writer. I write music and lyrics. Doug 
would always come up to me after I'd taken a stab at dialogue and say, 'You 
know, if you tried this. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Eventually, Haverty agreed to co-write, on the condition that -- with the 
exception of a few songs -- they'd start from scratch. It took three years to 
get their work on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideas I gave him were actually things we were doing in my own therapy," 
Russ said. One technique was role playing, in which a patient assumed the 
persona of another (for example, their mate) and had a mock confrontation with 
herself. Another technique, called "Behind My Back" had group members standing 
behind a member's back, saying things they would not say to her face. Another 
was "If You Really Loved Me," a listing exercise of crippling emotional 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Although Russ often taped her own sessions -- with the permission of the group 
-- and later transcribed them ("I need to listen to something a few times to 
understand what went on"), the characters of "Roleplay" are not carbons of her 
real-life fellow patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose some of the women in the group could think that one or two of the 
characters are based on them," Russ said. "One of them was a businesswoman like 
Liz. Another, like Sage, believed in reading cards. But that's the end of it." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
If any one person is represented on stage, Russ believes, it's her. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm in everyone. I'm like the businesswoman. I have my own editing 
business. I relate to that whole 'Do it at home, be your own boss' thing. 
Dena's a singer/songwriter. I used to make my living as a songwriter. Sage is a 
peacemaker. I was in the Peace Corps. Like Molly, I always feel that I'm fat. 
And there's that part of Chlo about never getting enough love. I think when you 
come from a very loving family -- then go out in the world and find out it's 
not always like that -- you can never get enough." 
</P>
<P>
The final judgment on therapy, she stressed, is affirmative. 
</P>
<P>
"There was another musical about group therapy some time ago, 'Walls.' When I 
saw it, it made me want to do mine even more. I didn't think it presented 
therapy in the proper light -- at least what I think it is. For me, it's a very 
positive thing. I'm a believer. And from the feedback we've gotten, it seems 
audiences are getting more from the show than just entertainment: stepping into 
other people's shoes, doing the role play, seeing things from another point of 
view." (See accompanying story.)

Haverty (a member of Group Rep, where his "In My Mind's Eye" ran in 1984, with 
Russ' incidental music) is also enjoying another point of view -- as a man 
involved in what is, unarguably, a woman's story: "It's funny; I seem to be 
able to write women better than men. I grew up in a family of boys -- I have 
three younger brothers -- so women fascinate me. I study and collect them. When 
they tell me things, I remember them. All of my plays either have a female lead 
or really strong parts for women." 
</P>
<P>
(Here, he's also outnumbered: In addition to Russ and the six cast members and 
six understudies, the stage manager, choreographer, assistant director and 
director are all female.) 
</P>
<P>
Like Russ, Haverty, 36, hopes that the therapy theme is having therapeutic 
effects. "I wanted to present a subject people are either afraid of or make fun 
of -- and show it can be a rewarding thing. Adryan had a really good experience 
in group therapy. At the beginning it was scary, it was always challenging, and 
at the end she felt better. I think this is something that makes audiences 
appreciate their own lives, and shows there is still some humanity about 
people."

As the play moves into its 12th week (the show has been extended twice), both 
authors continue to show up each weekend (with Russ commuting from Santa 
Barbara) to work with the actresses, watch the performances and check out 
audience reaction. What next? Russ' fantasy future includes regional stagings 
on the way to an East Coast production. Haverty says he's "listening all the 
time, trying to streamline," although he admits the cuts are painful -- and 
slow. 
</P>
<P>
As an actor-turned-writer, however, he admits that the responsibility 
definitely feels good. "You get to be the parent," he said. "And when the 
audience laughs or cries, you have a sort of shared parentage." 
</P>
<P>
With due credit to the offspring. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like Adryan and I have written a good floor plan, a springboard -- and 
that these women have colored and built this incredible house," he said. "The 
life and humanity they bring is what catches audiences up, makes them feel 
good. They make the show."
