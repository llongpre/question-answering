   The concert pianist Solomon, hailed as one of the
century's most distinguished pianists but forced to cut short his
career because of a stroke, has died at age 85, his family said.
   Solomon, born Solomon Cutner but known professionally by his
first name only, died Feb. 2, his family announced Tuesday. No
cause of death was given.
   Solomon was born Aug. 9, 1902, one of seven children in a family
in London's rough East End. At age 7 he began studying music. One
of his fellow students became the Queen Mother, mother of Queen
Elizabeth II.
   Solomon made his concert hall debut when he was 8 years old,
playing playing Mozart's B flat Concerto and the slow movement of
Tchaikovsky's First Concerto at the Queen's Hall in London.
   He later appeared again at the Queen's Hall, under conductor Sir
Henry Wood, playing Beethoven's Third Concerto and Liszt's
Hungarian Fantasy, and in 1911 undertook his first British tour.
The same year he played to the royal family at Buckingham Palace,
and his career as a child prodigy was established.
   Solomon appeared with many of the world's most famous conductors
and orchestras, but by the time he was 16, he had tired of the
concert hall circuit and temporarily quit to resume his musical
studies.
   Wood wrote in his autobiography that the young Solomon told him
he had ``no boy's interests, no games,'' because of his career.
   ``As he said, it had been piano, piano, and nothing but piano,''
wrote Wood.
   Solomon resumed his concert hall career in 1921, made his
American debut in 1926, and was one of the world's most
sought-after pianists until suffering a debilitating stroke in 1956.
   The Times of London wrote: ``He developed his technical
virtuosity to the highest pitch, but his outstanding quality was
the intellectual insight and poetry of feeling which he brought to
the keyboard repertory, from Mozart to Debussy.''
   Another London paper, The Daily Telegraph, wrote: ``Solomon's
clarity of articulation, his warm, soft-grained tone, musical
accuracy and honesty of purpose shone through all his performances,
and his virtuosity was so formidable as to be unnoticeable.''
   Solomon is survived by his wife, Gwendoline Byrne, who was one
of his former pupils.
