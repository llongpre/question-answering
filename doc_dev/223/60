Two years ago, Marcel Montecino exchanged the piano for the pen, and took off 
on his Hollywood honeymoon: 
</P>
<P>
* First novel, "The Crosskiller," 900,000 copies printed, a best-seller. 
</P>
<P>
* First screenplay, "Improper Conduct," bought by Jaffee-Lansing Productions 
for $250,000; the film is scheduled to be released next year. 
</P>
<P>
* Second novel, "Big Time," published in August with its movie rights already 
purchased for $1 million by Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
"I can spit on a piece of paper," said Montecino, 45, of West Los Angeles, "and 
someone will give me $50,000." 
</P>
<P>
He paused, as if expecting Federal Express to arrive with an immediate check. 
Things have gone that well. 
</P>
<P>
Not too shabby for a piano player who, until 1988, was working the bar mitzvah 
circuit, collecting $100 a night and waiting for the hit song that was going to 
propel him into stardom. But the closest he got to fame during his music days 
was playing for five years at Budd Friedman's Improv in Hollywood. Robin 
Williams and Jay Leno worked there and made it big. Marcel Montecino just 
worked there. 
</P>
<P>
"I was miserable," he recalled. "It wasn't happening." 
</P>
<P>
So he turned to his other creative craft -- writing. He used to write a lot in 
his youth, he said, but gave it up to experience life. "I didn't know what I 
wanted to say." 
</P>
<P>
He spent the '70s in a daze, high, still not ready to record his thoughts. 
Finally, when the '80s drew to a close, Montecino discovered his literary 
voice, fine-tuned by years of hard living on the streets. He had played piano 
in a Mississippi brothel, losing his virginity to a blackjack dealer. He worked 
in bands up and down Bourbon Street in New Orleans. Finally he knew what he 
wanted to say. 
</P>
<P>
"I call my books dark novels, not thrillers," said Montecino. "I like to 
explore the dark side of the human psyche. The dark side is right below the 
surface for everyone. How many of us contemplate suicide every day?" 
</P>
<P>
Montecino's characters are not heroic; "I don't think any of us are heroes." 
Rather, they are ordinary characters, who, trapped in extraordinary situations, 
rise above their limitations. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has difficult times, and somehow finds a way to do what's 
necessary." 
</P>
<P>
In "Crosskiller," a Jewish cop hunts down a neo-Nazi serial murderer in West 
Los Angeles; in "Big Time," a New Orleans piano player has to run all over the 
world to escape the Mob, and can't pursue his dream of fame because he knows 
recognition would kill him; and in "Improper Conduct," a cop gets involved with 
a rich woman who leads him astray. 
</P>
<P>
His dialogue holds little back, filled with sexual references and profanities, 
the kind of realism that attracted producer Sherry Lansing. "It's gritty and 
gutty," Lansing said. "He creates characters that are totally believable. He's 
one of the most talented writers I've ever worked with." 
</P>
<P>
Even today, Montecino insists, as his lifestyle undergoes changes he never 
anticipated -- he's about to buy a house in Pacific Palisades -- he claims he's 
not far removed from his modest beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in a lower-class Louisiana family with his aunt and uncle -- both 
parents died before he was 8. He attended high school owning only two shirts. 
His aunt and uncle, however, saved enough money to afford his $1.50 piano 
lesson once a week. His practice paid dividends, and after receiving a music 
scholarship to Southeastern Louisiana State College, he seemed ready to pursue 
his dream. 
</P>
<P>
But Montecino, always impatient, left college after one year. "I couldn't spend 
the next three years eating one hot dog a day. I hated school. I wanted to 
start life." 
</P>
<P>
And so he did, often losing control, taking at least 45 grams of amphetamines 
every night. Most of the money he earned playing music was squandered in 
illegal gambling houses. "I wouldn't quit even if I made 10 times my 
investment," he said. "I wanted to win the house." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled with amusement the night he slept with the blackjack dealer and 
feared for his life. "She took this gun out of her glove compartment and put it 
in her purse," he said. "She brought it inside. I didn't know what to think." 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, he moved to Los Angeles, ready to make his impact on the national 
music scene. Along with his wife, Montecino wrote dozens of songs, paying the 
rent with his piano job at the Improv. The couple separated in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
After all his success in writing books and screenplays, Montecino still regrets 
not landing the hit song. "It broke my heart," he said. "I haven't played the 
piano in two years, but eventually, I'll go back." 
</P>
<P>
Montecino, never lacking in confidence, received a big boost when he took a 
UCLA Extension course in novel writing in 1985. By then he had written about 70 
pages of "The Crosskiller." He showed it to a teacher and classmates who told 
him to go home and finish it. "I knew then I could write novels." 
</P>
<P>
When Montecino finished "Crosskiller," he took it to get copied. He told his 
wife he would be lucky if he got an agent within a year, but "when I got home, 
there was a call on the answering machine from someone in the UCLA class. I had 
an agent three days later, and a publisher a month after that." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't as self-assured about screenplays, so the immediate success of 
"Improper Conduct" stunned even him. So far, he derives more satisfaction from 
his novels, but eagerly awaits the release of the movie. "They give you a lot 
of money, and they can do what they want," he said. "They could turn it into a 
milk carton. With novels, you have that total amount of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his fortune, Montecino took a long time to regard himself as a true 
writer. "I used to tell people that I was a piano player who writes. Writing 
was something other people did. I went through this period of not knowing who I 
was. People who used to be names in magazines became friends of mine, Hollywood 
friends to be sure. But now I know I'm a writer." 
</P>
<P>
And a prolific one. He is busy working on a new screenplay, and says he knows 
the contents of his next four books. He claims his screenplay -- a story about 
post-Vietnam days in Bayou country -- isn't commercial. 
</P>
<P>
But, with typical confidence, he replied: "Somebody will buy it."
