   It's 2 a.m., and your baby is crying and
won't sleep.
   What to do? Play the Beatles, of course, and within 15 minutes a
hard day's night becomes much easier.
   Award-winning pianist Floyd Domino has turned the music of the
Fab Four into an album of lullabies designed to send bawling
infants straight to Sleepytown.
   ``A lot of adults say it works,'' says the 35-year-old musician
from Austin, Texas.
   The album, ``Baby Road,'' is a takeoff of the Beatles' 1969 LP
``Abbey Road.'' It contains 12 songs, including 11 hits of the
famed group and the title track written by Domino.
   The LP also parodies the ``Abbey Road'' cover, which showed the
four Liverpool lads walking single file across a street. ``Baby
Road'' shows four diapered tots strutting one behind the other
across the road.
   ``These lullabies are dedicated to all children and their tired
moms and dads,'' Domino writes on the album cover.
   Beatles' songs on the LP are ``Hey Jude,'' ``Yesterday,''
``Michelle,'' ``Something,'' ``With a Little Help From My
Friends,'' ``Norwegian Wood,'' ``For No One,'' ``In My Life,''
``She's Leaving Home,'' ``Here, There and Everywhere'' and ``Good
Night.''
   ``I didn't try to compete with the Beatles, just be true to
their music and not use a lot of hot licks,'' said Domino, who
played with country star Waylon Jennings for four years.
   He got the idea for the album when his wife was pregnant.
   ``This is so much better than `Mary Had a Little Lamb,''' he
said. ``I tried to make them sound as simple as possible, but a lot
of production was involved.
   ``I let the melodies come up by using the upper modes of the
piano. The Beatles are very identifiable. You can play the melody
and not be a slave to any original arrangement.
   ``I thought of their songs that could be acoustical and simple
where you don't tamper with the song and it brings it out. Some of
the melodies worked and others would not.''
   The only other musicians on the LP are Edgar Meyer, who played
upright bass, and guitarist Mark Howard. The selections are
strictly instrumentals without any lyrics.
   ``A lot of the songs are better without words, like `She's
Leaving Home.' People think of their daughter leaving or about an
unhappy teen-ager,'' Domino said in a telephone interview.
   He said he chose ``Yesterday'' for ``the purity of the medley.
It's a song you have to include when you do a Beatles' lullaby
record. The sound is very simple: The guitar carries the rhythm and
the piano plays the melody well and draws attention to the song.''
   He said ``Hey Jude'' has a strong emotional impact on people,
especially parents. ``The theme is take a sad song and make it
better. The song means so much to a person because they think of
the words. The song triggers memories and emotions and it makes
parents so happy to be sharing them with their kids.''
   Domino, who's been playing piano since age 5, says he rates
``Michelle'' as the Beatles' hit with the best melody.
   ``I would play it a lot before I recorded this,'' he recalled.
``I always loved playing it.''
   Some Beatles' songs did not fit well. ``Help!'' was too uptempo
for a peaceful arrangement. Domino was wary of the stringed
instruments used in ``The Long and Winding Road.''
   ``Let It Be,'' he said, ``had an identifiable arrangement and I
was reluctant to tackle it.''
   He hopes to do a follow-up project, which like the first will be
on his own Golliber Records in Austin. The next album will include
some of the Beatles' songs he had to omit from the first.
   Domino, born and raised in Berkeley, Calif., had a featured part
in the song ``One O'clock Jump'' which won a Grammy award in 1978
for the country group Asleep at the Wheel.
   After leaving the group, he played piano in the Broadway
production ``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.'' He then joined
Jennings' band, but quit two years ago in order to spend more time
at home.
   The ``Baby Road'' project has been more rewarding for him than
playing on the road.
   ``I get great letters from parents saying they are glad I did
this record,'' he said. ``It's been a lot of fun and much more
personal. I save every letter I get.''
   His 2{-year-old son, Will, who helped inspire the project, has a
favorite song on the LP: ``Something.''
   But it's a winner by default.
   ``He'd fall asleep so quickly he never listened all the way
through,'' Domino said.
