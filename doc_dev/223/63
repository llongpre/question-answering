   For more than 60 years, ``Show Boat'' has been a
part of William Hammerstein's life.
   He remembers being taken by his father to the old Ziegfeld
Theater where he would stand in the wings beside the stage
manager's desk to watch the musical about Cap'n Andy Hawks, his
daughter, Magnolia, gambler Gaylord Ravenal, Joe, the black
stevedore, and all the others aboard a Mississippi River showboat
called the Cotton Blossom.
   He also recalls sitting in Helen Morgan's dressing room and
gazing at the star's pet goldfish.
   ``She was very nice to me, and I was only 9 or 10 years old at
the time,'' says Hammerstein of the woman who became a Broadway
legend after she sang ``Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man'' and ``Bill'' in
the musical.
   ``But what impressed me the most about the show was Cap'n Andy's
play within the play. It was a little vaudeville piece and a lot of
fun. And of course, I remember `Ol' Man River.' In those days, they
had 16 male singers. That was a lot of sound.''
   Nearly 20 years after the musical's premiere, Hammerstein stood
in the same place backstage at the Ziegfeld and watched the show
again, this time as stage manager of the 1946 revival.
   Today, he's still watching over the show, having directed it in
various revivals all over the country since then. Most recently, he
served as production consultant for an opulent three-hour revival
of the musical taped last summer at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New
Jersey for public television's Great Performances and scheduled for
viewing Friday in most cities.
   Hammerstein is the oldest son of Oscar Hammerstein II, the man
who wrote the book and lyrics _ Jerome Kern did the music _ for
what many people consider the greatest American musical.
   ``I think I'm the only living person who remembers most of the
productions of `Show Boat' and was closely connected with them,''
says the 70-year-old Hammerstein. During his career, he has
produced television specials, worked for various Broadway producers
such as Leland Hayward, and directors such as Joshua Logan and
Garson Kanin, and supervised many other Hammerstein properties.
   The new television production of ``Show Boat'' stars Eddie
Bracken as Cap'n Andy, Rebecca Baxter as Magnolia, Richard White as
Ravenal and Shelly Burch as the doomed Julie LaVerne, the role
originated by Miss Morgan. It's a cast drawn from a wide range of
backgrounds, including opera, Broadway and television.
   ``They're all wonderful,'' Hammerstein says. ``Richard White is
the best Ravenal I've ever seen. What he has that none of the
others did is a kind of humorous approach to the character. He
takes the role seriously. He's amused with Magnolia when he first
meets her and then that amusement becomes affection.
   ``I also love Rebecca Baxter,'' he adds. ``She's young, fresh
and innocent and then in the second act, she takes command, like
she should, as a mature woman.
   ``But the role of Cap'n Andy is the spoke of the wheel. He's the
dynamo, the propeller of the showboat. He holds it together. He's
the most important element in the musical, and Eddie understood
that completely.''
   ``Show Boat'' has had several major revivals in New York over
the years, the last being a version done by the Houston Grand Opera
at the Gershwin Theater in 1983.
   And last year there was renewed interest in the musical with the
release of a complete recording of the show by musical theater
historian and conductor John McGlinn. The recording of more than
three hours of material contains nearly every song written for
``Show Boat,'' both stage and movie versions.
   Hammerstein applauds McGlinn's effort but says a stage version
of ``Show Boat'' with all the cut material reinstated is unwise and
unnecessary.
   ``John has done a great service by doing that record for
students of the theater,'' Hammerstein says. ``But when people of
talent and experience write songs for musical shows and then go on
the road, the idea is to make the show better and better. In the
course of doing that, they will frequently remove some material and
add others.
   ``To suddenly say, `Here are all the songs that were cut from
the show. Aren't they wonderful?' Well, some of them are wonderful,
but they don't belong in the show.''
   The new television version virtually follows the original
staging, says Hammerstein, except for the addition of ``Ah Still
Suits Me,'' a comic duet for Joe and his wife, Queenie. The song
was added to the 1936 movie version for Paul Robeson, who played
Joe.
   Hammerstein is a passionate champion of ``Show Boat.'' It began,
he says, the great age of American musicals, an era that later saw
``Oklahoma!'' and ``Carousel,'' written by his father and Richard
Rodgers. That era continued with Lerner and Loew's ``My Fair Lady''
and may have ended with ``Fiddler on the Roof'' by Jerry Bock and
Sheldon Harnick.
   ``I think `Show Boat' has qualities about it that are lasting,
like some of the great operas,'' he says. ``There was a period when
the French wrote great operas, there was a period when the Italians
wrote great operas, and I think the same thing happened with the
American musical. It came into its own in the 1930s and developed
during the 1940s and 1950s, and in the '60s the musical sort of
faded out.''
