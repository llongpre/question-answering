Jim Murray, veteran sports columnist for the Los Angeles Times, won the 
Pulitzer Prize for distinguished commentary on Thursday, while in a rare 
action, twin gold medals for public service were given to the Philadelphia 
Inquirer and to the Washington (N.C.) Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
August Wilson, one of the nation's leading black playwrights and a previous 
Pulitzer recipient, won the drama award for his play "The Piano Lesson." In the 
fiction category, Oscar Hijuelos received the Pulitzer Prize for his book "The 
Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love," edging out E.L. Doctorow"s book "Billy 
Bathgate." 
</P>
<P>
The Pulitzer Prize for distinguished musical composition was awarded to Mel 
Powell for "Duplicates: A Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra," which had its 
premiere in January by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Powell, a native New 
Yorker, has been a resident of Los Angeles for the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
He heads the composition faculty at California Institute of the Arts and is 
holder of the Roy E. Disney chair in musical composition. 
</P>
<P>
The Inquirer won its medal for reporting by Gilbert M. Gaul, disclosing how the 
American blood industry runs with little governmental regulation or 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington (N.C.) Daily News received its public service Pulitzer for 
revealing that its city's water supply was contaminated with carcinogens, a 
problem that local government had neither disclosed nor corrected over a period 
of eight years. It was the first time in 23 years that two public service gold 
medals were given. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, 70, who has been named America's best sports writer 14 times by the 
National Assn. of Sportscasters and Sportswriters, received his first Pulitzer 
Prize. He began his career with the Los Angeles Times in 1961 after serving as 
West Coast editor for Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the Academy Award of our business. It's something you don't even think 
about," he said. "I never thought I would get a Pulitzer Prize. . . . I always 
thought you had to bring down a government or expose major graft or give advice 
to prime ministers. Correctly quoting Tommy Lasorda shouldn't merit a Pulitzer 
Prize. I never really expected it. I am very pleased and happy to have won it." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Columbia University awarded 15 prizes in journalism and seven in 
the arts. Each award carried with it a $3,000 prize, except the award for 
public service in journalism, which is a gold medal. The Pulitzer Prize Board, 
often criticized in previous years for giving a disproportionate share of 
awards to Eastern newspapers, gave 7 of the journalism awards this year to 
Western newspapers. Coverage of two major disasters -- the San Francisco Bay 
Area earthquake and the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill -- earned three 
Pulitzers. 
</P>
<P>
The entire staff of the San Jose Mercury News won the general news reporting 
prize for its work on the quake and its aftermath, while the Oakland Tribune 
won the spot news photography prize for its quake pictures -- including the 
photograph at right taken by Michael Macor of rescuers removing a victim from 
the rubble of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Times won the national reporting prize for its coverage of the 
Exxon Valdez oil spill and its aftermath. Reporters cited were Ross Anderson, 
Bill Dietrich, Mary Ann Gwinn and Eric Nalder. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn of the New York Times, a husband-and-wife 
team, won the international reporting prize for the paper's coverage of China's 
mass movement toward democracy last spring and the subsequent repression. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Kilzer and Chris Ison of the Star-Tribune in Minneapolis won the 
investigative reporting prize for exposing a network of local citizens and 
members of the St. Paul Fire Department who profited from fires, including some 
described by the fire department as being of suspicious origin. 
</P>
<P>
David A. Vise and Steve Coll of the Washington Post won the explanatory 
journalism prize for stories scrutinizing the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the way it had been affected by its former chairman, John S. R. 
Shad. 
</P>
<P>
The specialized reporting prize went to Tamar Stieber of the Albuquerque 
Journal. The Pulitzer board cited her for "persistent reporting" in linking a 
rare blood disorder to the over-the-counter dietary supplement L-tryptophan. 
The articles were followed by a national recall of the product. 
</P>
<P>
Also nominated as a finalist in the category was Claire Spiegel of the Los 
Angeles Times for investigation of mismanagement and abuses at the Martin 
Luther King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles. Her stories led to reforms at 
the hospital. The other finalist was Jim Dwyer of New York Newsday for his 
coverage of the New York City subway system. 
</P>
<P>
The feature writing prize was given to Dave Curtin of the Colorado Springs 
Gazette Telegraph for what the Pulitzer jurors called "a gripping account of a 
family's struggle to recover after its members were severely burned in an 
explosion at their home." 
</P>
<P>
David C. Turnley of the Detroit Free Press won the feature photography prize 
for photographs of the political uprisings in China and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism prize was given to Allan Temko of the San Francisco Chronicle for 
his articles on architecture, while Thomas J. Hylton of 
</P>
<P>
the Pottstown (Pa.) Mercury won for editorials about a local bond issue for the 
preservation of farmland and other open spaces in rural Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Toles of the Buffalo News won the editorial cartooning prize for a year's 
work, exemplified by a cartoon about the First Amendment. The cartoon pictured 
the White House and Capitol with language citing various threats to the 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction was given to Dale Maharidge and Michael 
Williamson for their work "And Their Children After Them." The book explores 
the lives of 128 descendants of Alabama sharecroppers portrayed by writer James 
Agee and photographer Walker Evans in a book they collaborated on in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
Maharidge is a reporter for the Sacramento Bee and Williamson is a photographer 
for the same newspaper. They are collaborating on another book about hobos who 
ride the railroads. 
</P>
<P>
Sebastian de Grazia, author of "Machiavelli in Hell," won the prize for 
biography, and the history prize went to Stanley Karnow for "In Our Image: 
America's Empire in the Philippines." A professor of political philosophy at 
Rutgers University in New Jersey, De Grazia also has worked as a director of 
research at the Twentieth Century Fund. A veteran journalist, Karnow has worked 
for Time magazine, the Washington Post and the New Republic magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The prize for poetry went to Charles Simic for "The World Doesn't End," his 
12th volume of poems. Simic, born in Yugoslavia, was awarded a prestigious 
MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1983. His poems have been translated into 11 
languages and have appeared in magazines including the New Yorker, The Nation, 
Esquire, the Atlantic and the Paris Review. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, the winner of the drama prize, had previously won the Pulitzer Prize 
for drama in 1987 for his play "Fences," the story of a black ballplayer and 
his relationship with his son. 
</P>
<P>
His latest play, "The Piano Lesson," which opens on Broadway on Monday, deals 
with a brother and sister at loggerheads over what to do with the ancestral 
piano they jointly own. 
</P>
<P>
In her review when "The Piano Lesson" played at the James A. Doolittle Theater, 
Times theater writer Sylvie Drake praised the production as "not a play you 
just watch." 
</P>
<P>
"It insists that you listen to it and listen carefully," Drake wrote. "It is 
filled with subplot -- rich tangential stories that flow freely into the main 
current, nurturing ancient cultural and metaphysical roots." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's latest play topped two other finalists in the drama category -- Maria 
Irene Fornes' "And What of the Night?" and "Love Letters" by A.R. Gurney. 
</P>
<P>
Hijuelos' winning, street-smart work of fiction "The Mambo Kings Play Songs of 
Love," is largely set in New York City in the early 1950s and is the story of 
the immigrant experience, of lost opportunities and hopes. It is a colorfully 
written story of two brothers who realize a lifelong dream of playing in Ricky 
Ricardo's band on the "I Love Lucy" show. But the experience proves to be a 
fleeting moment of triumph, and the book chronicles their growing 
disillusionment and unhappiness back in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the awards set off celebrations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I will say we haven't had this much excitement in this town since the Union 
cavalry and the Confederate cavalry chased each other up Main Street in 1862, 
and there's been nothing like that since," said Bill Coughlin, the Washington 
Daily News' executive editor. 
</P>
<P>
They broke out the champagne at the Philadelphia Inquirer after the paper won 
it's Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great. It is a terrific honor," said reporter Gaul. "The paper showed 
an incredible amount of courage to allow me to spend a year and a half on the 
story and to report on a subject that is of great importance to everyone that 
we don't often think about -- blood." 
</P>
<P>
Gaul, 38, had previously won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting in 
1979. The blood series, which found that the industry is little regulated, was 
inspired by his questions about what happened to the blood he donated four 
times a year.
