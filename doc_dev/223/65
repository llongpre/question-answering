   Oscar-winning filmmaker Oliver Stone is
making another Vietnam War movie, this one starring Tom Cruise.
   Stone will direct ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' based on the
life of Ron Kovic, who enlisted in the Army during the Vietnam War
and returned home paralyzed. Kovic then spoke against the war and
joined protesters he had once labeled traitors. He also wrote a
book about his experiences.
   The picture will begin filming in September.
   ``I think Oliver Stone is a terrific person to be making the
film _ the best person to do this story,'' said Kovic. ``The
message in the book and movie is listen, learn and never let it
happen again.''
   Stone's ``Platoon'' won four Academy Awards, including best
picture in 1986.

   Mayor Sonny Bono's mother and
stepfather have walked off their jobs at his restaurant after
allegedly being insulted by a new restaurant manager.
   ``It is a shock,'' said Bono's mother, Jean. ``But I am still
his mother at heart and I would rather not make him look like the
big bad wolf.''
   Bono's mother quit her hostess and public relations jobs the day
her husband, Tony Rose, quit as acting general manager of the
popular desert restaurant named Bono's.
   ``I was insulted by the new manager,'' Rose said.
   Bono, 53, confirmed that Rose left after a squabble with new
general manager, Dick House, but he declined to go into detail.
   ``I think it is something of a family matter and some things
have to stay in the family,'' said Bono, who became famous as half
the Sonny and Cher music team. ``I just wish he would have talked
to me rather than walking out.''

   Hollywood musical star Donald O'Connor
reprised the title song of his most famous movie, ``Singing in The
Rain,'' and sang the Danville High School fight song, accompanied
by actor Gene Hackman, comedians Dick and Jerry Van Dyke and
pianist Bobby Short.
   The five _ Danville natives all _ returned Monday to this
eastern Illinois city to do a benefit for the restoration of the
104-year-old Fischer Theater.
   ``I think it's an investment in the future of the city,'' said
Short. ``I think that Danville must have a downtown ... and the
Fischer is a vital part of downtown.
   Alan Thomann, a spokesman for the Vermilion Heritage Foundation,
which is raising funds to restore the abandoned Fischer, said it
was the first time all five Danville-born stars had appeared
together.
   Thomann noted Hackman and Jerry Van Dyke both worked as ushers
at the Fischer.
   And Dick Van Dyke said he was let in free so many times by his
brother that he felt he had to come back to repay an old debt.
   As for O'Connor, the Fischer was the scene of his first public
appearance. He was carried on stage as a 6-month-old baby by his
vaudevillian mother.

   Larry Krystkowiak was in for a big
surprise when he dropped by his alma mater after completing his
second season in the NBA: someone stole his Porsche.
   Krystkowiak, the former University of Montana star who returned
to Missoula about a week ago, said his car had been parked on a
city street since Saturday because he lost his keys, though he now
suspects they were stolen.
   Monday afternoon, he got a new set from a locksmith and went to
retrieve his sports car. It was gone.
   ``I thought about calling a locksmith (Sunday),'' he said. ``You
know, I'm thinking it's Missoula, Montana. Nothing's going to
happen.
   ``I guess I was wrong.''
