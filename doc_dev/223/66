   Roger J. Williams, recognized as one of the
world's foremost authorities on nutrition, died Saturday at age 94.
   Williams was a professor emeritus at the University of Texas.
His work in nutrition at the UT Clayton Foundation Biochemical
Institute, which he founded, led to the discovery of more vitamins
and their variants than at any other research facility in the world.
   One of Williams' most significant accomplishments was the
discovery and isolation of pantothenic acid, one of the ``universal
vitamins'' required by all living cells and essential to life.
Later he discovered and named folic acid, a substance used by every
cell in the body.
   Williams wrote a book on ``biochemical individuality,'' a
concept that no two people are exactly alike physiologically and
therefore everyone has different nutritional requirements. He
retired in 1985.

   John Allegro, renowned for his work in deciphering
the Dead Sea Scrolls but ridiculed for his theories that Western
religions were based on the worship of mushrooms, died Feb. 17. He
was 65.
   Allegro was a brilliant student of Semitic languages at
Manchester University and went on to study Hebrew dialects at
Oxford University.
   In 1953, Allegro was named to an international team formed to
decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were discovered in caves at
Qumran.
   The scrolls included the oldest known manuscripts of books from
the Old Testament. Allegro's gift for deciphering minute texts was
crucial. His book, ``The Dead Sea Scrolls,'' was published in 1956
and became a bestseller.
   In his 1970 book ``The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross,'' he
contended that Judaism and Christianity were in fact products of an
ancient sex-and-mushroom cult. Allegro also published a 1966 book,
``Search in the Desert,'' about an unsuccessful search for lost
scrolls in the Judean Desert.
