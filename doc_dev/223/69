   Where has success taken Anita Baker?
   ``To dreamland sometimes. To hell and back in a limo at other
times.''
   She has been described as having ``one of pop music's most
gorgeously appointed voices.'' She has won three Grammy Awards as
best rhythm 'n' blues female vocalist plus one for best soul gospel
singing and two songwriting Grammys for ``Sweet Love'' and ``Giving
You the Best That I Got.''
   But she has insecurities and worries about maintaining her
individuality.
   ``Record companies have come to see what I do is profitable,''
she said. ``They're churning out female artists who sing ballads
with jazz overtones.
   ``How do I maintain my identity when there's an assembly line of
me coming out?''
   Baker has a new Elektra Records album, ``Compositions,'' on
which she wrote or co-wrote seven of the nine songs. She also
recorded seven live with a rhythm section.
   ``They were out with Eric Clapton. We had 11 days to cut. We cut
10 songs in 11 days, the fastest cutting I've even done.
   ``It was great. I never knew you could have fun in the studio.
I'd hated it. Doing it live, everything at the same time, I'm not
thinking about myself. If you hear something great being played, it
spurs you to do something cool.
   ``I tried to get my manager to get a film crew in, once we got
the bugs out. He said, `You could have got self-conscious. You
never would have finished.' I said, `Thanks for second guessing
me.' He called to see if we could recreate it. The guys were out
with Clapton.''
   In the late 1970s, Baker became vocalist for a Detroit group,
Chapter 8. ``We did an album in 1980 and Ariola didn't pick up the
option. They said, `You don't have what it takes to make it. I
figured they knew what they were talking about. I went and got a
day job.''
   So she went to work at her aunt's beauty shop as a gofer and
later as a shampooer.
   ``With Chapter 8, I was singing ballads,'' Baker said. ``There
was nothing on the radio except dance music. Now the trend is
toward what I do, fireside love songs with jazz, blues and gospel
overtones. The good thing is that a lot of young singers are
discovering their predecessors. I listened to Sarah Vaughan and
Nancy Wilson. If there is going to be a fad, let it be for love
songs with jazz overtones, because that's what I do.''
   Baker's in the middle of a huge summer tour, and quips that her
songs are, ``Not fireside love songs. Seaside. Love songs from the
pier.''
   She's been accused of being quick tempered, but says she isn't.
   ``I'm impatient with incompetence. We have 30 to 50 people on
the road when I'm traveling, lighting crew, stage managers,
carpenters, bus drivers, limo drivers, security. I don't know how I
got a reputation for being that witch with a `b' on the front of
it,'' she said.
   ``It comes from people talking to people that have been fired.
The only way you can get fired is that you complicate very simple
things by not listening or not having any pride about your job or
having to be told something 50,000 times. Who has got time for
that?''
   Gradually, she says, ``The best people have kind of found their
way to us. We've got the same band I had the last tour and a great
crew, which makes life as easy as it can be on the road.''
   Audiences have been great, Baker said. ``The kind of confidence
that fosters in me is not the kind of confidence record companies
want their artists to have. What happened at Wembley (in England)
and Copenhagen and here has given me a confidence that I needed.
They play on the insecurity of an artist, saying audiences were
there the last time but we don't know if they're going to be there.
   ``The first leg of this tour has given me confidence in knowing
my audience is there for me.''
   Baker carries an exercise tape on tour. She also carries a book
about chord structures and progressions which she studies on
airplanes.
   When she was growing up, her aunt suggested piano lessons. She,
youngest of five girls, was ``a rebel without a cause'' and
refused. She's sorry now. ``I do play. I'm not a pianist.''
   In 1988, Baker married Walter Bridgeforth, who has a small
investing company and operates a restaurant. When their opinions
don't coincide, she says, he doesn't debate or argue. ``He says,
`You're entitled to an opinion. I'm going to the golf course.' I
like it, though.
   ``He travels with me when he can. I wouldn't want him with me
all the time. Somebody is going to read something into that. I like
the fact he has a life independent of mine. And it makes for
sweeter rendezvous.''
   They live on Lake St. Clair in Grosse Pointe, Mich., and have
recently bought a house nearby that they will tear down. ``We'll
build something that will fit the community. We're not ones to try
to outdo everybody. I'm in a very iffy business. If I'm milk toast
tomorrow, we could sell off the adjoining land to developers and
we'd be quite all right.
   ``No matter what I do and no matter how much property we acquire
or investments we make, there's this little person in here that's
the inner-city kid saying, `Anita, somebody is going to come and
take your credit card.'
   ``When we walked into the new house, I had to go into another
room and sit down. I lost it. When I was a kid, and Walter, too,
the thing to do at Christmastime was parents would pack their
children into the car and drive along the lake shore and look at
the pretty lights on the houses.
   ``Now, it's like I'm walking through a dream sometimes.''
