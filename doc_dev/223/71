   ``Babes in Arms'' is the Rodgers and Hart
musical that people think they know _ and don't.
   What everybody recalls is the folklore that has obscured this
classic ``Come on kids, let's put on a show'' musical that
introduced such standards as ``My Funny Valentine,'' ``The Lady Is
a Tramp,'' ``Johnny One Note,'' ``I Wish I Were in Love Again'' and
``Where or When.''
   They remember the vastly different _ and softer _ Andy
Hardy-style movie starring Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney and not
the Broadway musical which opened two years earlier at the Shubert
Theater with a cast of young unknown performers that included
Alfred Drake, Mitzi Green, Wynn Murray, Dan Dailey, the Nicholas
Brothers and Ray Heatherton, father of Joey.
   It is a concert revival of the original Broadway version that
will grace Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall June 5. Performers
include Judy Kaye, Gregg Edelman, Judy Blazer, Jason Graae and a
singing group called J.Q. and the Bandits. Some of the book will be
performed, but Anita Morris will serve as narrator to tie together
some of the plot developments.
   The concert, a benefit for the Starlight Foundation which helps
critically ill children, will be presented and conducted by Evans
Haile, a Juilliard-trained musician who has conducted at the
Seattle Opera and other opera companies. He will lead the New
Jersey Symphony in Hans Spialek's original orchestrations.
   ``This show has a unique place in musical theater history,''
says Haile. ```Babes in Arms' is a score that has five standards
but hasn't been done in New York since its premiere. And the
original book is much more interesting in a lot of ways than the
later versions because it deals with social issues.''
   The story for ``Babes in Arms,'' which Rodgers and Hart also
wrote as well as the music and lyrics, is set during the
Depression. It concerns the children of out-of-work vaudeville
performers who put on a revue so they will not be sent to a work
farm. The show flops but the kids are saved in Act 2 when a
trans-Atlantic flyer, a Frenchman named Rene Flambeau, crashes in
the area and helps the teen-agers out of their financial
predicament.
   ``There is a whole argument about socialism vs. capitalism in
the musical,'' said Haile, explaining what was in the original
script. ``One of the other big issues in the show is that when the
children find an underwriter for the show they are trying to put
on, they discover he's a bigot and won't let the two black kids
(played in the original by the Nicholas Brothers) go into the
show.''
   That was the musical's first act finale. When the curtain came
up the on the second act, the kids were on the work farm and the
black performers did not reappear in the show.
   The show boosts several lesser known Rodgers and Hart songs such
as ``You Are So Fair'' and ``Imagine,'' as well as two long ballet
sequences, originally choreographed by George Balanchine. The music
from both will be performed at Lincoln Center although in abridged
versions, particularly the ``Johnny One Note'' ballet which
consists of some 12 minutes of the song repeated in the same key.
   Even stage versions of ``Babes in Arms'' that audiences have
seen over the last three decades have been different than the
original, says Ted Chapin who oversees the rentals of Rodgers and
Hart musicals as manager of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Library.
   In the 1950s and '60s, according to Chapin, Richard Rodgers
encouraged revised versions of three or four Rodgers and Hart shows
which were basically not being produced at all. That quartet
included ``Babes in Arms.''
   ``I can only surmise that in the 1950s he felt the way to get
the Rodgers and Hart shows performed more, was to do more
up-to-date versions,'' Chapin said. ``With `Babes in Arms,' George
Oppenheimer wrote a new book that was what everybody thought `Babes
in Arms' was from the beginning _ a summer stock musical, kids in
the barn on Cape Cod trying to put on a show.''
   ``Babes in Arms'' has had very few major revivals over the last
half century. The St. Louis Municipal Opera performed it in 1940;
Julie Wilson starred in a production at the Royal Poinciana
Playhouse in Palm Beach, Fla., in 1959; and the Goodspeed Opera
House had its own version with Andrea McArdle of ``Annie'' fame in
1979.
   ``The revised version by Oppenheimer that we rent does very well
in high schools, but more and more, as people are becoming aware of
originals, they are asking for originals,'' Chapin said. ``There
has been interest but it has never been followed through with
`Babes in Arms.' Mark Bramble (co-author of the book for ``42nd
Street'') wanted to do a production in London based more on the
original but that didn't work.''
   Haile's concert presentation could awake interest in ``Babes in
Arms'' again. Already several recording companies have indicated
they might want to record the show.
