   Toni Morrison's novel ``Beloved'' sparked the
biggest literary controversy of the year, but the panelists who
nominated it for the Pulitzer Prize said they felt no pressure to
choose it over other works.
   ``None,'' said Michael Gartner, editor of the Ames (Iowa) Daily
Tribune. ``For us, it was just a case of sitting down and reading
three books and deciding which one was the best. ... `Beloved' was
clearly the superior book.''
   The controversy surrounding ``Beloved'' erupted after the novel,
a powerful story of a former slave who kills her daughter rather
than see her returned to bondage, failed to win the National Book
Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award.
   Larry Heinemann won the National Book Award for ``Paco's Story''
and Philip Roth won the National Book Critics Circle Award for
``The Counterlife.''
   In January, 48 black writers and critics signed a letter
denouncing the fact that Ms. Morrison, who is black, ``has yet to
receive the national recognition that her five major works of
fiction entirely deserve.''
   With the biggest prize of all, the Pulitzer, still to come, the
letter generated debate about the role _ and propriety _ of
lobbying in the selection of literary awards.
   But the jurors who nominated ``Beloved'' as one of three
Pulitzer finalists in fiction said they had made their decision
weeks before the letter was published, and that they chose it in an
atmosphere free of pressure.
   ``I want her to realize this wasn't the result of any
pressure,'' said the chairman of the three-member jury, Rutgers
University professor Julian Moynahan. ``I think her book is one of
the greatest American novels I've ever read in my life.''
   The jury was required to submit three choices to the Pulitzer
Board without stating a preference. Moynahan was far from
non-partisan as he spoke about it in retrospect.
   ``If she hadn't gotten it, I think I would have cut my throat,''
he said Thursday after the prizes, chosen by the 17-member board,
were announced.
   The other two nominated novels were ``Persian Nights'' by Diane
Johnson and ``That Night'' by Alice McDermott.
   ``They're all three wonderful books,'' said another juror, Los
Angeles Times book critic Richard Eder.
   Eder spoke passionately about ``Beloved,'' calling it ``an
incredible evocation ... of the incredible degradation that slavery
meant to the bodies and souls of slaves. ... I don't think it's
been better done.''
   One Pulitzer Board member, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the board's decision about ``Beloved'' was unanimous. He
declined to talk about the discussion that led to the choice.
   One of the writers who signed the protest letter, John Edgar
Wideman, said the board's decision encouraged him. ``I'd only be
happier if I won it,'' he said.
   ``What was said about Toni Morrison (by black writers and
critics) was something symptomatic about the reception about black
literature in general,'' Wideman said.
   Wideman said the late James Baldwin was an even better example
of a black writer being ignored.
   ``That certainly does not get redressed by one award or one
person's triumph,'' Wideman said. ``It's a good sign. But let's
cross our fingers and hope it represents a trend, a symptom of a
larger understanding and appreciation of the work of black people
in all fields.''
