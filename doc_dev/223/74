   Back in the 1950s, in Bugaloosa, La., a boy was
born to Beauregard and Beulah Poindexter, the famous song-and-dance
team; they named the child Buster.
   As the Poindexters toured the South, young Buster built up a
large following, giving uncanny impersonations of Carmen Miranda and
Louis Armstrong while drinking water out of a martini glass and
telling jokes with the skill of a seasoned veteran.
   But on Easter Sunday in 1959, Beauregard was shot in a crooked
game of hearts by a man in a Stetson hat named Staggerlee, the
bullet shredding the queen of spades.
   Buster's desperate mother learned that actress Tallulah Bankhead
needed an assistant, and the Poindexters moved to New York.
   No one knows what happened to Beulah Poindexter after that, but
Buster resurfaced in the 1980s at a New York club called Tramps,
drinking real martinis and performing standards and new songs
dressed in tie and tails.
   Audiences, young and old, responded to Poindexter, and in 1987
the singer released his debut album, ``Buster Poindexter,'' a lively
collection of rock, jazz and soca that included the hit single
``Hot, Hot, Hot.''
   And so the imaginary life of Buster Poindexter goes.
   He's really David Johansen, former singer for the seminal punk
band The New York Dolls, and now a part-time actor (``Married to the
Mob'') who recently spoke of his two very different careers and
personalities.
   ``Buster's timeless,'' Johansen said. ``People who like the New
York Dolls dig what I'm doing now. The thing about Buster I dig is
that little kids like it, 5-year-old kids, 3-year-old kids. It's
like a character they can relate to.''
   On Poindexter's new album, ``Buster Goes Berserk,'' he covers
``All Night Party,'' a '60s dance hit suggested by his baby sitter,
Wilson Pickett's ``International Playboy'' and an obscure reggae
song, ``Poor People.''
   ``I'm prone not to record well-known songs; you can judge them
against something else,'' said Johansen, who reluctantly covered The
Animals' classic ``House of the Rising Sun'' on his first record.
   ``I'm in this network of people who make tapes of old stuff _
different genres of music. I make some of the best soca tapes in the
world. I got this guy in L.A., Fast Freddy, the mambo king; he makes
some unbelieveable stuff.''
   Johansen grew up in Staten Island, N.Y., in the '60s and listened
to all kinds of music, especially rhythm and blues.
   ``There were two soul stations,'' Johansen recalled, ``WWRL in
Manhattan and WNJR in Newark (N.J). WNJR, instead of just playing
the slick kind of soul songs, also played a lot of Southern soul _
Solomon Burke, Little Walter. Plus, I used to listen to (disc
jockey) Murray the K, and I'm a big fan of WBAI's `World Dance
Party.'''
   The New York Dolls broke up after just two records, but
anticipated the English punk movement and American new wave scene of
the '70s with their combination of crude energy and ironic
intelligence. Johansen pursued a solo career, but tired of life on
the road.
   ``I used to live in the back of a van, which isn't so good for
your back, or your liver,'' he said. ``We'd been traveling eight
hours a day in a van and you'd go nuts, especially if you're going
to talk to some heavy metal guitarist all day. You'll go bananas _
some guy who's in love with George Jetson's daughter, and you're
trying to explain to him that it's a cartoon.''
   Performing as Buster was meant originally as a temporary escape,
but the act's popularity _ especially on New Year's Eve _ made
recording an album a logical step.
   ``When I started it was just two guys: a piano player and me.
Then a drummer joined us, a guitar and bass,'' he said. ``I was just
going to do it for a month of Mondays at Tramps. We kept doing it
because people liked it. It built very naturally. We added the horns
and percussion and then decided to make the record.''
   His fast songs recall hot summer nights in New York, with crowds
spilling out of nightclubs into the streets, but Poindexter also
switches moods with an occasional ballad, such as ``Deep in a
Dream.''
   ``My sense leans towards fun stuff, but I like to have a little
pathos as well. I see all kinds of images. The beach, all kinds of
stuff. The airport. I normally do a ballad at the end of the show.
For your third encore you do a ballad, otherwise people will never
leave.''
