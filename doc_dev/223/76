   Pulitzer Prize-winner Toni Morrison and three
others were honored Friday at a ceremony for recipients of the
Robert F. Kennedy Book Awards.
   Morrison, honored for the Pulitzer-winning ``Beloved,'' said she
felt obligated to receive the prize ``not only based on the work
but based on the work of Robert F. Kennedy.''
   RFK Judge William Chafe said the judges felt the book ``was such
an eloquent and vivid portrayal of the interior experience of the
black community, it helped all of us understand better the black
experience.''
   Mary King received an honorable mention for ``Freedom Song,'' as
did Dan Jacobs for ``The Brutality of Nations.''
   Pauli Murray, who died in 1985 after completing her memoir,
``Song in a Weary Throat,'' posthumously shared the top prize with
Morrison.
