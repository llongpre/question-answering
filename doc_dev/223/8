When the American baritone William Parker found his career, as well as his
body, ravaged by the Aids virus, he again turned to song and conceived the
idea for The AIDS Quilt Songbook. He commissioned from leading composers and
poets a still-growing collection of songs that, like the panels in the Names
Project quilt, remember individuals who have died of Aids.
Like the quilt's panels, the Songbook songs are performed in whatever
configuration best suits an occasion. The 16 songs recently performed during
the San Francisco Symphony's 'Wet Ink' new-music festival turned out to be,
among other things, a memorial for Parker himself, who died in New York on
March 29 at the age of
49.
The musically exemplary performances by the baritones Kurt Ollmann, David
Evitts, and Andrew Solomon-Glover were unified by the deeply sympathetic
piano playing of William Huckaby, an associate of the project from its
inception. The songs (soon to be published by Boosey and Hawkes) ranged from
the sweetly elegiac (Ned Rorem's 'A Dream of Nightingales') to the ragingly
defiant (Donald Wheelock's 'Fury'). While each poem and its setting captured
an aspect of grief, some inevitably left longer echoes in memory.
Solomon-Glover intoned John Harbison's 'The Flute of Interior Time' in a
rapt hush. Ollmann, who captured the specific consolation in Thom Gunn's
'The Reassurance' (set by Donald St. Pierre), carefully traced the thread of
a Chinese proverb embedded in the Ron Schreiber text of Carl Byron's 'the
birds of sorrow.' Evitts masterfully delineated the desultory undertow in
William Bolcom's bluesy 'Vaslav's Song' and kept listeners hanging on the
heartbreaking narrative of Lee Hoiby's 'Investiture at Cecconi's'
Throughout, the powerful texts told, even across difficult musical idioms.
Sad lines, like 'Paul Jacobs is playing Busoni on the radio' (from Chris De
Blasio's 'An Elegy to Paul Jacobs') were wrenching. Yet the most memorable
words were the hard ones, like the rapier word-play of poet Charles Barber's
'Death be nimble - life was quick' in St Pierre's 'Fairy Book Lines.' Even a
San Francisco concert audience was pommelled by poet Melvin Dixon's tough
talk - 'Night sweats. Dry cough/Loose stools. Weight loss.' rendered with
uncomprom-
ising force by Evitts.
The music was deeply personal. If some of it seemed less than external, it
bears remembering that no one wanted to have to write this music, and that
the participants would like nothing more than for this music to become
unnecessary and obsolete.
