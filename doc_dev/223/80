Once upon a time, Gower Street in Hollywood was also known as Gower Gulch, 
because of all the quickie Westerns being made at the small and struggling 
studios along it. It was also known as Poverty Row because so many of the 
studios' struggles were unavailing. Only Columbia ultimately prospered on 
Gower. 
</P>
<P>
The Gower Gulch days were early Hollywood, before production had begun to be 
dominated by a handful of majors, and there seemed to be new studios on every 
block. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, for a moment and half from 1914 to 1915, was the Oz Film 
Manufacturing Co., founded by L. Frank Baum, who had just published the eighth 
of his Oz books, "Tik-Tok of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
The film company adventure, and Baum's whole, quite remarkable life, are on 
view in an ambitious and inventive display at the Frances Goldwyn branch of the 
Los Angeles Public Library on Ivar in Hollywood. I caught up with it belatedly, 
I confess in some chagrin, but it runs through Aug. 31 and is engrossing. It 
includes a video display of Oz on film, television and stage, with rare clips 
from some of the five films the Oz studio made in its short, troubled life. 
</P>
<P>
Baum, who had moved to Los Angeles from Chicago with his wife Maud and his 
children in 1910, had had a life strewn with ill health and financial troubles. 
He'd had to sign over to his creditors the rights to the first Oz book, "The 
Wonderful Wizard of Oz," even though it had already sold 780,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
He built a house, Ozcot, at Cherokee and Yucca, and he raised capital to launch 
the studio by tapping his new pals in the Los Angeles Athletic Club and the 
Uplifters, a kind of boys' night out club in Rustic Canyon famed for its lively 
revues, which Baum wrote and performed in. 
</P>
<P>
Baum produced "The Patchwork Girl of Oz," "The Magic Cloak of Oz," and "The New 
Wizard of Oz" and two non-Oz films. On the evidence of the clips on view at the 
library, the Oz works were full of trick photography and slapstick. They were 
silent, of course, although there were scores written for in-theater use by 
Baum's compatriot from the Uplifters, Louis Gottschalk. 
</P>
<P>
There were distribution problems (then as now) and a harassing suit by the 
Edison interests, trying to assert its monopoly over the motion picture camera. 
Baum himself fell seriously ill again and after a brief cessation in 1914 the 
Oz studio, on Santa Monica Boulevard, shut down for good in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
The Oz books have had tremendous appeal and staying power since Baum published 
the first one in 1900. He wrote 14 before he died; Ruth Plumly Thompson wrote 
many more before she wearied, and only recently a new Oz appeared, written by a 
Baum grandson. 
</P>
<P>
Baum seems as prototypical an American story as, say, Mark Twain. He led a 
peripatetic life as a writer of all trades who tried his hand at everything 
from raising purebred chickens to running a dry goods store to editing 
newspapers in South Dakota and conducting a satirical column. He wrote in many 
forms, from songs and plays to retellings of Mother Goose, and he used several 
pseudonyms before, at his family's urging, he turned his spur-of-the-moment 
bedtime stories into that first Oz book. 
</P>
<P>
Like Howard Garis, who wrote the first titles in the Tom Swift series, Baum was 
from Upstate New York (Chittenango in Baum's case) and was nuts about all the 
emerging technologies of the 20th Century. There are glimmerings of science 
fiction as well as sheer fantasy in the Oz books. Partly for this reason, and 
for his slyboots commentaries on the real world, he has been read not only by 
children but by all ages. 
</P>
<P>
Like other authors, Baum at one point felt himself a captive of his creations 
and tried to stop the series, reporting that it was no longer visible and 
reachable. There were such outcries that he relented and decided it could be 
reached by the relatively newfangled wireless telegraph, and the next book was 
in essence a report from Oz. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Garland and a song may have given Baum and Oz their widest fame, but you 
have to hope that new generations of readers are continuing to discover the 
books themselves, because they represent a unique and many-faceted body of 
work. Baum's mother-in-law was a famous and ardent suffragette, for example, 
and militant feminists, led by General Jinjur and armed only with knitting 
needles, have their day in one of the early Oz books, "The Land of Oz." Oz has 
been ruled by men long enough, the general says. The women are temporarily, but 
only temporarily, routed by mice. 
</P>
<P>
Baum with all else was a prophet, possibly with tongue in cheek, a sly satirist 
with all his other endearing charms. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, researched by Carroll Hodge, with Deni Wohlgemuth Ponti and 
Richard Shea as designers, is open daily except Sunday from 10 a.m. and 
admission is free.
