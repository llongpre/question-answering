   Jim Murray never figured his much-read sports
columns would pull a Pulitzer Prize.
   ``I always thought Pulitzers were for overturning a government
or exposing a scandal in the stock market,'' said the 70-year-old
Los Angeles Times sports columnist, who won the prize for
commentary. ``I thought Walter Lippmann got Pulitzers, not us
guys.''
   Murray, who's been writing columns for 30 years, is the fourth
sports columnist to win a Pulitzer Prize.
   Across the country Thursday, champagne flowed freely as winners
of the coveted prizes whooped it up.
   ``We haven't had this much excitement in this town since the
Union cavalry and the Confederate cavalry chased each other up Main
Street in 1862,'' said Bill Coughlin, executive editor of the
Washington (N.C.) Daily News, covered with champagne in a newsroom
ringing with shouts and marching music.
   The Daily News won one of two Pulitzers for public service
journalism for revealing that the city water supply was
contaminated with carcinogens.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer won the other public service Pulitzer,
for revealing a threat in blood supplies. The newspaper has taken
17 Pulitzers in 16 years. Gilbert Gaul, 38, who wrote the
prize-winning series, won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting at
the Pottsville (Pa.) Republican in 1979.
   Nicholas D. Kristof, 30, and Sheryl WuDunn, 30, of The New York
Times, who were married shortly before going overseas in March
1989, took the international reporting prize for their coverage of
China's political turmoil. ``Champagne will be a bit tough to find
but we'll certainly celebrate with Great Wall wine,'' Kristof said
in Beijing.
   At the San Francisco Chronicle, co-workers dragged a stunned
Allan Temko, 66, winner of the criticism prize, off to celebrate.
   ``Is it true?'' asked Temko. ``How extraordinary. I've always
been a bridesmaid.''
   ``I'm literally speechless,'' said Tamar Stieber, 34, of the
Albuquerque Journal, whose reports linking the dietary supplement
L-tryptophan to a rare blood disorder won the specialized reporting
prize.
   ``It's wonderful of course _ kind of like a lifelong dream,''
said Dave Curtin, 34, winning feature writer, at the Colorado
Springs Gazette Telegraph. Curtin wrote about a family's struggle
to recover after its members were severely burned in an explosion
that leveled their home.
   David C. Turnley's images of world upheavals won him the feature
photography prize. The winning portfolio by the Paris-based
photographer for the Detroit Free Press _ ``The Year in
Revolution'' _ contained eight pictures from China, two from the
Berlin Wall, two from Czechoslovakia and eight from Romania.
   Turnley, 34, got the word in Johannesburg, South Africa, in a
conference call his editors set up, supposedly to talk about
pending assignments.
   ``All I can say is I really wanted to win it in Buffalo and now
I have,'' said Tom Toles, 38, at The Buffalo News, who won for his
cartoons. ``Buffalo has had its hard times and I have a special
feeling for the city.''
   Not everyone was surprised.
   ``I can't say it was unexpected,'' said Executive Editor Robert
Ingle of the San Jose Mercury News, winner in general news
reporting for its coverage of the Oct. 17 earthquake. ``Everybody
who saw our coverage from the outside and the inside said it was
extraordinary.''
   In Minneapolis, Executive Editor Joel Kramer of the Star Tribune
of Minneapolis-St. Paul told a packed newsroom that ``old-fashioned
gumshoe reporting'' produced the story that won the investigative
reporting prize.
   The winner by Lou Kilzer, 39, and Chris Ison, 32, exposed the
St. Paul fire chief's alleged ties to people who profited from
arson, like companies that received millions of dollars in
insurance money.
   But 90 minutes into the celebrating, Kramer announced: ``This
party's almost over. We've got to put a paper out tomorrow.''
   Author Oscar Hijuelos, 38, was relaxing at a friend's house when
he heard his book won the prize for fiction. ``The Mambo Kings Play
Songs of Love'' tells of Cuban brothers who immigrate to the United
States and find minor celebrity on an episode of ``I Love Lucy.''
   ``This is so unexpected,'' Hijuelos said. ``My mother will be
happy.''
   Writer Dale Maharidge and photographer Michael Williamson of The
Sacramento Bee won the general nonfiction prize for ``And Their
Children After Them.'' The book picks up 50 years after James
Agee's ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,'' about 22 Alabama
sharecroppers.
   ``I really felt my odds were better in the lottery than for
this,'' said Williamson.
   Sebastian de Grazia, 72-year-old winner of the biography prize
for his ``Machiavelli In Hell,'' said a celebration was planned at
his Princeton, N.J., home with ``the traditional bottle of red
wine.''
   ``It has to be Tuscan wine,'' he added, in honor of his subject.
   Poetry winner Charles Simic, 51, was in Delaware on a reading
tour.
   ``I always hate to get these calls from my wife,'' he said. ``I
always think something happened, like the car got wrecked or the
basement is overflooded. But I could hear by her voice there was
something special, and she told me right away. It astonished me.''
   Second-time Pulitzer winner August Wilson, 44, who earned the
drama prize for ``The Piano Lesson,'' said his first thought was
```Wow, this is No. 2.' It made me want to go right to my
typewriter and start another one.''
   Composer Mel Powell, 67, was giving a lesson when he learned he
had won the music prize for ``Duplicates: A Concerto for Two Pianos
and Orchestra,'' which was commissioned for the Los Angeles
Philharmonic.
   ``I expect (my students) will pay much more attention to what I
say now,'' he said.
