   ABC commentator and syndicated columnist George
Will, a heavy hitter in journalism, was little more than a
bench-warmer as a young baseball player.
   Will, 48, a fan of the national pastime whose new book is ``Men
at Work: The Craft of Baseball,'' said as a youngster he was a born
right fielder, ``which is where they put the kid they can't figure
out what to do with.
   ``As a hitter, I wanted to walk. I lacked athletic confidence,
which is why I sank to journalism,'' he said in the April 16 issue
of People magazine.
   If he had his wish, would he choose a baseball career over news?
   ``Ask me a hard question, will you?''

   Pool expert ``Fast Eddie'' Parker, who
inspired the 1961 movie ``The Hustler'' and its sequel ``The Color
of Money,'' doesn't mind passing on his pool-playing tips now that
his hustling days are over.
   Parker, 58, who holds the world record for pocketing 22 balls in
one shot, gave a few pointers to the crowd at Persnickety's Grill
and Night Club in this central Georgia city Saturday night.
   ``We're old guys, we've had our day,'' Parker said. ``Now it's
time for the young guys to take over.''
   Parker began playing pool when he was only 9 years old and later
became a ``money player,'' making his living through hustling and
winning tournaments.
   In the late 1950s, Walter Tevis saw Parker play in Kentucky and
wrote a book titled ``The Hustler'' just a few months later.
   The book was made into a movie starring Paul Newman in 1961.
Paul Newman starred with Tom Cruise in ``The Color of Money,'' a
1986 sequel to ``The Hustler.''

   Princess Chulabhorn, the youngest
daughter of King Bhumibol of Thailand, dedicated a city square in
honor of her father in front of Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government.
   ``Our national hope for peace, freedom and a better quality of
life unites us regardless of the geographical distance of our two
nations and the difference in our cultures,'' the princess, a
scientist who was recently appointed the World Health
Organization's Goodwill Ambassador for International AIDS programs,
said during a brief ceremony Sunday.
   King Bhumibol, also known as King Phumiphon, was born in
Cambridge in 1927 when his father was a medical student at Harvard.
He inherited his crown from his brother in 1946, and is the longest
reigning monarch in the world.
   The king was a host of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery
Company of Massachusetts during its visit to Thailand last year as
part of a Far East tour.
   After the company returned to America, a resolution was
introduced to the City Council calling for the dedication. The
measure passed in September.

   After writing hits for groups and
performers such as Alabama and Jimmy Buffett, Mac McAnally is
finding his place on the charts.
   McAnally, a 31-year-old native of Belmont, Miss., has hit the
Top 10 on the country music charts with ``Back Where I Come From.''
   The song takes listeners to McAnally's past, when his father was
a school principal and his mother played piano for gospel quartets.
McAnally dropped out of high school to play piano and guitar in
bars.
   A loner in his early days, McAnally turned to songwriting.
   ``Spare time is the major export in Mississippi and I partook
gladly,'' he said in a recent interview.
   Alabama started the country-music ball rolling for McAnally in
1981 when the group recorded its version of ``Old Flame,'' and
Buffett had a hit with McAnally's ``It's My Job.''

   Drummer Tommy Lee of the flamboyant
heavy metal rock group Motley Crue suffered a mild concussion when
he fell while swinging down a rope from on-stage scaffolding during
a concert, authorities said.
   The heavily tattooed Lee, who is married to actress Heather
Locklear, was released Sunday from Yale-New Haven Hospital.
   Hospital spokesman Tom Urtz said that he did not know how the
26-year-old Lee fell except that the rappelling stunt ``was part of
the routine'' at the concert Saturday.
   Motley Crue is scheduled to perform Tuesday in Binghamton, N.Y.
Before launching its tour, the band pledged that even though all
members had undergone drug rehabilitation, its concerts would be
just as raucous as in the past.
   ``We don't just play rock 'n' roll, we live it,'' bassist Nikki
Sixx was quoted as saying in People magazine earlier this year.

   Actress Lee Remick says her battle with cancer
has changed the way she approaches life.
   ``I used to be anxious and eager _ gotta do everything and be
everywhere. No, I say, don't gotta. Don't gotta do anything! Except
not hurt anybody else,'' Remick said in the May issue of Ladies
Home Journal.
   Remick was in France filming a movie last year when she
developed a fever she couldn't shake. When she came home, doctors
confirmed that she had a massive tumor on one kidney and some of
her lung cells were affected.
   Remick, 54, said a special treatment at a Bethesda, Md.,
hospital has rid her body of the cancer _ for now.
   ``I'm told that it is gone,'' she says, ``but I don't know that.
I'll always be apprehensive of its return.''
   The versatile Remick has portrayed an an alcoholic in the movie
``The Days of Wine and Roses'' and Winston Churchill's mother in
the seven-part TV series ``Jennie.''
