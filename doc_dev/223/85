   Arthur Mizener, who revived interest in F. Scott
Fitzgerald with the acclaimed first biography of the Jazz Age
novelist, died Thursday at age 80.
   ``The Far Side of Paradise,'' Mizener's best-selling biography
of Fitzgerald, was published in 1951 by Houghton Mifflin, a decade
after a heart attack ended Fitzgerald's downward spiraling career.
   Fitzgerald, now considered one of the great American novelists
of the 20th Century, wrote ``This Side of Paradise,'' ``The Great
Gatsby,'' ``Tender Is the Night'' and ``The Last Tycoon,'' as well
as numerous short stories.
   Mizener, who died in a Bristol, R.I., nursing home, taught
English at Cornell University from 1951 until his retirement in
1975. He wrote scores of essays and book reviews.
   He graduated from Princeton University in 1930, received his
master's degree from Harvard in 1932 and earned a doctorate from
Princeton in 1934.

   Virgil Hawkins, a black man who waged a
28-year battle to practice law in Florida and helped break the
color barrier at the University of Florida Law School, died
Thursday at age 81.
   In 1949, at age 41, he applied to the all-white law school in
Gainesville and was rejected. He challenged the segregated school
system and in 1956 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that he should be
admitted.
   But the Florida Supreme Court invoked states' rights to deny him
admission and the state adopted rigid entrance requirements that
made it impossible for Hawkins to enroll.
   In 1976 the Florida Bar urged the state Supreme Court to allow
Hawkins to take the bar exam even though he had attended an
unaccredited law school in Massachusetts 20 years earlier. The bar
said he deserved special consideration because of ill treatment in
1949.
   The Florida Supreme Court waived a requirement that he take the
exam.
   Hawkins opened a practice in Leesburg, but in 1984 the Florida
Supreme Court censured Hawkins and placed him on probation for two
years for errors he made in his first cases. Hawkins, facing two
more complaints, resigned from the bar in 1985.

   Nora Astorga, Nicaragua's U.N. ambassador who
gained fame during the Sandinista revolution for luring a general
to his death, died of cancer Sunday in Managua, said a spoksman for
the Nicaraguan government. She was 39.
   In Managua in 1978, Ms. Astorga lured Gen. Reynaldo Perez Vega,
deputy commander of the National Guard, to her bedroom, where
guerrillas cut his throat.
   Perez Vega had held the post in the regime of President
Anastasio Somoza, who was ousted by the leftist Sandinistas in 1979.
   In 1984, the United States rejected her as the proposed
ambassador to the United States. She held the rank of deputy
foreign minister at the time.
   She was appointed U.N. ambassador in 1986. Before the
revolution, she earned a law degree at Catholic University in
Managua and worked for an engineering firm there.

   Leon Goossens, an oboist who redefined the
instrument's potential and inspired composers to write music to
showcase it, died Friday at age 90.
   A Liverpool native born into a family rich in musical talent,
Goossens played with some of the finest orchestras of the day. By
1927, he was a soloist with the London Philharmonic.
   In his youth, the Liverpool Orchestra, paid him 22 cents a night
plus 9 cents for tackling the cor anglais solo in Rossini's
``William Tell Overture.''
   Edward Elgar's 1934 Soliloquy for Oboe and Strings, one of his
last works, was composed in honor of his friend Goossens. Benjamin
Britten and Francis Poulenc also dedicated works to him.
   Goossens was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire
in 1950. He toured the world until 1962, when a car accident
temporarily halted his career.
   Goossens played and recorded for many top orchestras and bands,
including Jack Hylton's jazz orchestra at London's plush Kit Kat
Club.
   He was the son of conductor Eugene Goossens. Survivors include
two sisters, both harpists, Marie, 93, and Sidonie, 87, who was
principal harpist with the British Broadcasting Corp. Symphony
Orchestra for 50 years.

   Frederick Loewe, who created the
unforgettable tunes for Alan Jay Lerner's lyrics in such Broadway
hits as ``Camelot,'' ``My Fair Lady,'' ``Brigadoon'' and ``Gigi,''
died Sunday at age 86.
   ``I Could Have Danced All Night,'' ``On the Street Where You
Live,'' ``I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face'' and ``If Ever I
Should Leave You'' were among the classic songs produced by the
18-year partnership.
   Lerner and Loewe's collaboration began with a one-night flop in
Detroit in 1942. They parted bitterly after ``Camelot,'' their last
Broadway hit, in 1960.
   In between came ``Brigadoon'' in 1947 and ``My Fair Lady'' in
1956.
   Lerner and Loewe reunited in 1973 for the Broadway production of
``Gigi,'' and remained friends.
   Loewe retired in 1974. Lerner died in 1986.
   Loewe was born in Vienna, Austria, the son of a tenor and an
actress. He began piano lessons at age 5 and composition at age 7.
At 13 he became the youngest pianist to appear as soloist with the
Berlin Symphony.
   Loewe came to the United States in 1924 with hopes for a career
as a piano soloist.
   After his debut at Town Hall in New York was ignored, he
embarked on a bohemian life, playing piano in clubs and movie
houses and working as a busboy.
