   Barbara Moore is hoping the showmanship that
earned her the nickname ``Squeek'' will help put her in the record
books.
   And she wants it to be under ``The Greatest Number of Songs
Played from Memory'' in the next Guinness Book of World Records.
   After three weeks of monitored piano playing in Philadelphia, Ms.
Moore had fallen a little short of her goal: to play 2,000 songs
from memory. The effort began Oct. 25 and ended Nov. 13.
   ``I only got to 1,852, but as far as I know, I'm the first person
to ever try to set a record (for Guinness) in this category,'' she
said.
   Ms. Moore, a 49-year-old elementary school music teacher, made up
a computer printout listing 2,000 songs she knew by heart. Judges
for the event called out those songs and critiqued her playing,
determining whether she knew each song down to the last note.
   Ms. Moore graduated from Ashland High School in 1957 and went on
to Oberlin College, then earned a master's at Catholic University in
Washington, D.C. She has performed throughout the world, ranging
from the Grand Teton Music Festival to accompanying the New Zealand
Ballet to playing in restaurants and private homes in the
Philadelphia area.
   Now on sabbatical from her teaching job, Ms. Moore is studying
computer-assisted electronic music at West Chester University in
Pennsylvania.
   ``I was glad to get it over with. My brain was tired of
remembering. My hands weren't tired, but after two weeks, and with
all the good songs gone, it got harder,'' she said.
