<LEADPARA>  Once upon a time there was a woman named Leeds; she wrote fairy tale rap and
got kids to  read.;    Since Barbara Leeds, 43, wrote and published "Fairy
Tale Rap" (1989, Miramonte Press) two years ago, her rap-rhythm adaptations of
classic fairy tales have been used in more than 1,000 grade schools in
California as part of their language arts curriculum, and in some adult
literacy programs as well, Leeds said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Leeds first thought of setting fairy tales to rhyme five years ago when she
had a vision of a football stadium cheering on the young hero of "Jack and the
Beanstalk":;    Climb, Jack, climb. You're a lucky boy, a lucky boy.;    Up,
Jack, up. Don't ask why or how.;    Go, Jack, go. There are riches for you,
riches for you.;    Lucky is the day that you sold that cow.;    A devout fan
of Rogers and Hammerstein musicals, the Mountain View author originally
intended to set the words to song. But when she read what she had written to
her writers' critique group, Leeds said they told her, "You don't need music
to this -- this is rap.";    "And I said, 'What is rap?' " Leeds remembers
with a grin. "The rest is history.";    One Run-DMC compact disc and numerous
revisions later, Leeds had a book and accompanying cassette on her hands -- a
package teachers have praised for being both educational and fun, rich with a
healthy sense of the fantastic and absurd.;    Leeds said rap is "street
poetry -- somewhere between formal poetry and song." But she is quick to point
out that her version of rap differs from what you might hear on the radio.;   
"It's not angry; there are no bad words in it," she said.;    While some might
disagree with Leeds' narrow definition of rap music and her exclusion of the
black urban sensibility that distinguishes the genre, Leeds does share at
least one thing with the likes of M.C. Hammer: Both play with the natural
rhythms of language to get their messages across.;    Since the book's
publication, Leeds has performed with her troupe, "Fairy Tale Rappers," in
local bookstores and libraries. The former first-grade teacher has also given
presentations of her stories at elementary schools from Saratoga to Stockton,
where she encourages children to join in on parts written for chorus.;   
"Teachers invite authors to school so that kids can see that books were
written by real people," said Leeds, who is now at work on a sequel:
selections of Aesop's fables set to rap. "They're not teaching 'Dick and Jane'
anymore. They're using real books, real literature," she said.;    While she
initially balked at the idea of performing in front of an audience, Leeds has
come to enjoy her visits to the classroom. "Sometimes I just click with the
class," she said. "It'll be time for me to leave and I don't want to leave,
because we're together sharing the joy of language."  </TEXT>
