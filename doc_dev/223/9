   The new book ``Ain't Nothin' as Sweet as My
Baby'' contains a picture of country singer Jett Williams at the
age of 2 playing a toy guitar.
   It is a telling photograph, because Jett grew up to discover
that she was the daughter of country music legend Hank Williams.
   ``That fascinated me when I knew that Hank Williams was my
father, to think back on how I always played guitar and always
sang,'' she says. ``It made me feel really good, as if it was
something he left me.''
   Jett Williams tells her story in the book, how she was adopted
first by Hank Williams' mother and after her death by a Mobile,
Ala., couple named Deupree who tell her that Hank might be her
father but there's no proof and nothing can be done.
   Jett launches a search and learns that she's the daughter of
Bobbie Jett and Hank Williams. In the last five years, she has been
through many courts. There's big money involved but Jett says that
finding her roots, not money, was paramount. Her legal name is
Cathy Deupree Adkinson. Her stage name combines the last names of
her parents.
   Don Helms and Jerry Rivers, longtime members of Hank Williams'
band, the Drifting Cowboys, have embraced her. So far this year,
Jett and the Drifting Cowboys Band have played some 40 dates. ``I
really love it,'' she says of her traditional country show. ``I'm
having the time of my life.''
   The hardest thing in her search, Jett said, was discovering that
her mother had died. ``I had put so much stock in that she was
going to be able to answer all my questions.'' It was also
difficult to accept that her mother voluntarily gave her up.
   The best thing about Williams' search, she says, was meeting
Keith Adkinson, the Washington lawyer who took her case and is now
her second husband. He calls her B.J. because documents that he
found read ``in re: the matter of Baby Jett.'' He manages her
career and practices law, with ``Jett law'' taking the largest
share of his time.
   ``Also wonderful was finding the pre-birth contract and finding
out that Hank Williams was my father and that he wanted me,'' she
said in an interview. ``It was a wonderful emotional cushion for me
to land on.''
   On Oct. 15, 1952, Bobbie Jett and Hank Williams signed a
three-page, notarized document which said that he would give her a
plane ticket to California within a month after she gave birth and
he would pay hospital and doctor bills and support their child, who
would live with his mother for two years then live with him.
   ``I think it tells a lot about my father as a human being. He
loved me before I was born; he took me sight unseen. To me it's the
greatest compliment a father could give a child.'' Hank Williams
died Jan. 1, 1953, five days before his daughter was born.
   In 1985, Hank Williams Jr. sued in Alabama and Jett Williams
sued in federal court in New York over Williams' estate. In 1987,
the lower court in Alabama said Hank Williams Jr. was sole heir to
the estate of Hank Williams, who died without a will, and Jett
Williams was named a child of Hank Williams. In 1989, the Supreme
Court of Alabama ruled that Jett had been the victim of fraud, by
people who tried to keep her from finding out her parentage, and
said she can share in the estate.
   Still to come is a trial in New York regarding copywright of
Williams' songs. Will his two children and second wife share song
royalties equally or will the widow get half and the children get a
quarter each and from what year shall the daughter start collecting
her share?
   Among Williams' some 150 songs are ``Your Cheatin' Heart,''
``Hey, Good Lookin','' ``Jambalaya,'' ``Settin' the Woods on Fire''
and ``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,'' his daughter's favorite.
   Yet to be decided, in Alabama, is how Jett Williams shares in
Hank Williams' estate.
   She and Hank Williams Jr. haven't met, but she said she would
like them to meet and talk.
   She wrote the book, published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, ``to
tell the story of the search, frustrations, fighting, losing,
winning, setting the record straight in the court system. To me,
that's the story. That's why I ended the book before I knew about
the money.''
   This spring, Jett went to the Country Music Museum in Nashville
and had Williams' guitar handed to her to play. ``I'd seen a tie of
his and one of his suits behind glass but it was the only thing of
his I'd ever touched.'' She was thrilled.
   In 1949, Hank Williams wrote ``There's Nothin' as Sweet as My
Baby.'' His daughter heard a radio transcription of him introducing
it as ``Ain't Nothin' as Sweet as My Baby.'' She used that as her
book title.
   The lyric includes the description, ``Golden hair and big blue
eyes.''
   ``Of all the songs he wrote, that seemed to be custom made for
me,'' Jett said. ``He wrote it years before I was born but I like
to think he might have daydreamed what it would be like if he had a
little baby girl.''
