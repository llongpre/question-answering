   Imagine Andrew Lloyd Webber or Stephen Sondheim
not allowing songs from their latest musicals to be recorded or
played on the radio or performed in nightclubs and cabarets.
   Jerome Kern issued such an edict after the opening of ``Sitting
Pretty,'' his 1924 musical written with Guy Bolton and P.G.
Wodehouse.
   Why the ban?
   Kern was a man who wanted his music played the way he wrote it
and not jazzed up or distorted by popular renditions. He was a
perfectionist, although some musical comedy historians think the
prohibition may have been a ploy by Kern to create more interest in
the show.
   If it was, it didn't work. Despite generally good reviews, the
musical had a disappointing run of only 95 performances and
promptly was forgotten. Eiht or nine of its songs were published,
but much of the score disappeared until it was unearthed in a
Secaucus, N.J., warehouse seven years ago.
   Now ``Sitting Pretty'' returns to New York for five performances
in a concert version at Carnegie Recital Hall (April 13 through
April 16). It will be conducted by John McGlinn, the man behind the
recent complete and critically praised recording of ``Show Boat.''
   The concerts, performed with a 23-piece orchestra and an
18-member cast, star Davis Gaines, Jason Graae, Kim Criswell and
Paige O'Hara.
   For McGlinn, ``Sitting Pretty'' is a labor of love, a chance to
perform a musical not heard in New York for 65 years.
   ``Nobody knows the score at all,'' said McGlinn who considers
the work an important transition piece, a bridge between Kern's
less serious, early musicals and his masterpiece, ``Show Boat.''
   ``Robert Russell Bennett, who orchestrated many of Kern's
musicals, would sometimes refer to `Sitting Pretty' in interviews,
saying that it was something that people someday should hear again
because it was special,'' he said.
   McGlinn first heard the music in 1980 when Bill Tynes of the New
Amsterdam Theater Company let McGlinn raid his sheet music
collection.
   ``It was so different and so beautiful, and on an emotional
plane so far removed from many of the other things Kern was writing
at the time,'' he said. ``This score has the deepest emotional
depth of anything he wrote until `Show Boat.'
   ``I don't know what part of himself Kern dug down into to create
this score, and I should say Wodehouse did as well because the
lyrics are as moving and emotional as a lot of the music.''
   The creators didn't get it from the frivolous plot, concocted by
Wodehouse and Bolton, which involves twin orphans who fall in love
with the real and adopted sons of a wealthy old man.
   ``It's extraordinary because there is this wild dichotomy
between the book and parts of the score which are really emotional
_ songs like `There Isn't One Girl,' `A Year From Today' and `The
Magic Train.' It's the real thing. When the music starts, playtime
stops,'' McGlinn said.
   ``I think it comes from the fact that Kern, by 1924, was ready
to flex his muscles. And when he saw opportunities to write truly
emotional music, he went for it.''
   ``Sitting Pretty'' remained unperformable until the Secaucus
discovery where a full score for the show as well as a lot of
Kern's working sketches were found.
   The Carnegie concerts will also include 95 percent of the show's
dialogue. McGlinn discovered a late draft of the script in the
Museum of the City of New York. Between that script, an early copy
filed at the Library of Congress in Washington and the full scores
found in Secaucus, he was able to piece together a book for the
performers to use.
   Kern has been a major preoccupation of McGlinn's for a long
time. In 1985, he did concert versions at Carnegie of Kern's ``Oh,
Boy!,'' ``Oh, Lady! Lady!!'' and ``Zip! Goes a Million.''
   Besides ``Show Boat,'' McGlinn has a recording of Kern
overtures, including ``Sitting Pretty,'' coming out in May on
EMI-Angel. He also has a complete version of Cole Porter's
``Anything Goes'' waiting for release on the same label. His other
upcoming projects include new recordings of Porter's ``Kiss Me,
Kate'' and possibly Irving Berlin's ``Annie Get Your Gun.''
   For the moment, though, he's concentrating on Kern and the
concert version of ``Sitting Pretty.''
   Musical comedy buffs will savor one number in particular, the
title song. It was dropped a week into the musical's original run
because leading man Dwight Frye had a minor speech impediment.
   When Frye sang, ``I like to sit, just sit and sit and sit, with
you the whole day through,'' it sounded, according to Kern
biographer Gerald Bordman ``embarrassingly different.'' McGlinn's
concerts should rescue the song.
