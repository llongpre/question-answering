<LEADPARA>  RUTH BRANT waved a yellow nylon scarf to underscore the brilliance and
delicacy of Mozart's music to piano student Lila Lam.;   "Mozart's music is
beautiful like the shimmer of this scarf," Brant said. "But the music is also
transparent like the scarf, so mistakes are very noticeable."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Lila, 17, proceeded to play a flawless Mozart sonata. The final notes ended
with Brant's praise for the 10-year piano student.;   "Mrs. Brant is very
encouraging," said Lila, a senior at Notre Dame High School in San Jose.;  
Brant, 72, is director of the Institute of Music in San Jose, a school for
piano instruction now in its 75th year of operation from her home. The school
was founded in 1917 by her late husband, LeRoy V. Brant. When he died in 1969,
Ruth Brant continued operating the institute.;   "I love people and I love to
teach," said Brant, who has taught piano to 721 students since 1958. "Teaching
keeps me young. I forget that I'm 72 and have aches and pains. I feel as young
as my students. If I'm teaching a 17-year-old, then I feel like an energetic
teen-ager.";   She currently instructs 25 students, all with varying skill
levels, who range in age from 4 to 67. Brant's teaching philosophy is based on
individuality. "Every person learns differently," she said. "I tailor my
lessons to the student, not the student to the lesson.";   And her students
offer diversity.;   Jean Youmans, 67, began taking lessons six years ago to
fill the empty hours she faced after a divorce. "Ruth is extremely dedicated,
encouraging and inspirational," Youmans said. Youmans practices an hour every
day on her baby grand piano. She juggles practice between her duties as
president of Pottery Sales Inc., a Santa Clara wholesaler of plant pottery and
growing organic vegetables on six acres of land in the East San Jose
foothills.;   Chuck Crow, 47, arrives for a weekly 7:16 a.m. lesson before he
starts work as a financial officer at Four Point Investment Co. in San Jose.
He began taking lessons 1 1/2 years ago after he bought an antique piano.;  
"I played drums as a kid and always wanted to play the piano," he said. Crow
said he tries to practice during the week, depending on his workload. "Ruth is
patient and lets me develop at my own speed," he said.;   Brant didn't
formally develop as a musician until she was 25 and took her first piano
lesson. She had previously taught herself by mimicking a player piano in her
family's Cincinnati home. She decided to take lessons when she moved to San
Jose in 1944. Her instructor was LeRoy V. Brant, who later became her husband.
He was the conductor of the San Jose Municipal Chorus, author of music books
and a regular contributor to music magazines.;   The institute, a Rose Garden
home built in 1901, could be a music museum. Students play a Steinway Grand A
piano, which was built in 1916 and re-built in 1990. A large circular rug with
an embroidered G clef lies near the piano. A bust of Mozart sits on a
cabinet.;   Both walls of a long hallway are filled with framed photos and
letters from composers and famous people interviewed by LeRoy Brant. There's a
collage of letters and photos from Albert Schweitzer -- who as well as being a
humanitarian was an accomplished organist -- thanking LeRoy Brant for playing
benefit concerts in San Jose for his hospital and leper colony. There are also
letters from composers Jean Sibelius and Ernest Bloch.;   The hall ends at the
library, where shelves stuffed with thousands of books line the walls from
floor to ceiling. There are volumes on music, but also travel, health, Mark
Twain and Charles Dickens. The back wall is crammed with photos, including an
autographed picture of President Harry S. Truman. LeRoy Brant interviewed
Truman, a pianist, in the Oval Office for a magazine article.;   The decor in
her home reinforces Ruth Brant's passion for music. She recites biographical
sketches of composers and punctuates her conversations with quotes from
musicians. "I encourage my students to share the gift of music and to keep
growing as artists," Brant said.;   Students can enroll in the institute's
fall and spring semesters, which consist of 18 one-half hour lessons. The fees
are $125 or $6.95 per class. There's also a four-week summer session held in
June.;   Brant say she hasn't become weary of hearing the same songs during
her 31-year teaching career.;   "I love every note I hear from the piano," she
said. "It's a real joy to hear music played artistically well. It doesn't
matter if the song is 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' or Mozart. If I can hear the
story behind the notes, then it's beautiful music."; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; For
