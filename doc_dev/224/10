   Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke will be back
on CBS in separate new series this fall, but ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' are
gone.
   Also canceled are ``Houston Knights,'' ``High Mountain
Rangers,'' ``Eisenhower &amp; Lutz'' and ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy
Hour.''
   ``The decision to cancel the Emmy-winning drama `Cagney &amp; Lacey'
was a close call and was not made until Tuesday,'' said CBS
President Kim LeMasters. ``But the show had suffered the slings and
arrows. We felt it was time for it to go off before it got beaten
up more.''
   ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' was canceled in 1983, but CBS brought it back
after a letter-writing campaign by fans.
   The critically praised series ``Frank's Place'' isn't in the
fall lineup, but LeMasters said it would return next season as soon
as there is a protected time period where it can stay put. ``Kate &amp;
Allie'' and ``Jake and the Fatman'' are also being held until later
in the season.
   Taking ``Frank's Place'' off the schedule was ``one of the
toughest decisions I had to make,'' said LeMasters. ``It's an
extraordinary show. But what it boiled down to was, would I put it
on the schedule to be bounced around, or would I take the heat and
hold it for an advantageous time period?''
   Other shows that were new in 1987 that did make the
second-season slate were ``Coming of Age,'' a mid-season
replacement, ``Wiseguy,'' ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``Tour of
Duty.''
   CBS has already announced that its new season will begin a month
late, in October, because of the strike by the Writers Guild of
America.
   When it does get underway, there will be new comedies from Mary
Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke, who played husband and wife in the
popular 1960s sitcom ``The Dick Van Dyke Show.'' This time they'll
have separate shows, but they'll air back-to-back on Wednesdays.
   In her show, yet to be named, Moore will play a New York
divorcee. In ``The Van Dyke Show,'' Van Dyke plays a Broadway star
trying to help his more cerebral son, played by Van Dyke's
real-life son, Barry, keep a struggling theater group going.
   The network has added several new comedies to the schedule in an
effort to draw younger viewers. Among these is ``Dirty Dancing,''
based on the hit movie of the same name. Patrick Cassidy and Melora
Hardin will play the Patrick Swayze-Jennifer Grey roles.
   Candice Bergen will make her television series debut in ``Murphy
Brown,'' playing a big star from a popular network news show.
   Other news shows are:
   _``Close to Home,'' half-hour comedy starring James Naughton,
Royana Black, Mirian Flynn, Steve Vinovich and Bryan Cranston,
about a father and teen-age daughter (Naughton, Black) adjusting to
life with mom, who has left to ``discover'' herself.
   _``Almost Grown,'' one-hour drama about three decades in the
life of a marriage with emphasis on music, starring Tim Daly and
Eve Gordon as the couple who meet and marry in the '60s.
   _``Paradise,'' one-hour drama set in the 1890s starring Lee
Horsley as a gunfighter who inherits his sister's four young
children.
   _``TV 101,'' one-hour drama starring Sam Robards as a journalism
teacher who returns to his old high school to teach television
reporting.
   ``Van Dyke,'' ``Close to Home,'' ``TV 101'' are the first series
from GTG Entertainment, Grant Tinker's new production company.
   CBS News was celebrating the retention of the all three hours of
prime-time news programming. It had been rumored last week that
either ``48 Hours'' or ``West 57th'' would have to go. ``60
Minutes'' is a top-10 show. But when the schedule was announced,
all three shows were in the lineup, in their same time periods.
LeMasters said the decision had nothing to do with the writers
strike _news show writers are in a different union _ and the shows
were retained strictly on the basis of merit.
   Here is the CBS prime-time schedule for the fall:
   Monday: ``Newhart,'' ``Coming of Age,'' ``Murphy Brown,''
``Designing Women,'' ``Almost Grown.''
   Tuesday: ``TV 101,'' ``CBS Tuesday Movie.''
   Wednesday: ``The Van Dyke Show,'' ``Mary Tyler Moore,'' ``The
Equalizer,'' ``Wiseguy.''
   Thursday: ``48 Hours,'' ``Paradise,'' ``Knot's Landing.''
   Friday: ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Dallas,'' ``Falcon Crest.''
   Saturday: ``Dirty Dancing,'' ``Close to Home,'' ``Tour of
Duty,'' ``West 57th.''
   Sunday: ``60 Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``CBS Sunday
Movie.''
