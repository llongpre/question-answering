<LEADPARA>  THE final episode of "thirtysomething" had the series' highest ranking ever,
but the dwindling numbers of network viewers confirmed that the summer rerun
season has hit full stride.;    For the second consecutive week, ratings
released by the A.C. Nielsen Co. dropped to single digits. According to
figures released Tuesday, CBS finished first with a 9.6 average.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     ABC was a close second with 9.4. NBC, hampered by lackluster ratings for
its broadcasts of two National Basketball Association Conference finals games,
was third with a 9 average, failing to place any shows in the top 10.;    Each
ratings point represents 931,000 homes.;    ABC scored a hit with the final
episode of "thirtysomething." The network's recent cancellation announcement
helped make May 28's closing episode the No. 4 show on television last week.; 
  A rerun of ABC's comedy favorite "Roseanne" was the most watched program
last week, followed by a repeat of the network's "Coach" series.;    CBS's "60
Minutes," one of the few non-reruns in the top 10, finished third.;    The
back-to-back CBS Monday night comedies "Murphy Brown" and "Designing Women"
tied for fifth. ABC's "20-20" newsmagazine was seventh. CBS's reality drama
"Rescue 911" was eighth.;    ABC's Friday night hits "Family Matters" and
"Full House" finished ninth and 10th respectively.;    Tying for 10th place
was a rebroadcast of the pilot for "All in the Family," the classic CBS series
that debuted 20 years ago. Co-created by Norman Lear, "All in the Family" is
being reshown for six weeks alongside Lear's new program "Sunday Dinner.";   
The older series' pilot fared much better than the new program's opening
episode. "Sunday Dinner" tied for 20th place.;    In the network news ratings
battle, ABC won again, this time with an 8.6. CBS and Dan Rather were second
with 7.6. NBC and Tom Brokaw were third with 7.2.;    Here are the prime-time
television ratings as compiled by the A.C. Nielsen Co. for the week of May
27-June 2. The information provided shows rank, title, network and rating. The
top 20 listings also include the total homes in millions.;   1. "Roseanne"
