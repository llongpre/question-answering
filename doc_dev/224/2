<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  IN A prime-time television world where things seem to be making less sense all
the time, try figuring this: Jerry Van Dyke stars each week in a network
series (ABC's "Coach"), and his brother, Dick Van Dyke, doesn't.;    This is
the same Jerry Van Dyke who once starred in a show called "My Mother, the
Car," and this is the same Dick Van Dyke who headlined what many still
consider to be the finest TV comedy series ever: "The Dick Van Dyke Show.";   
Not that Dick is harboring any bitterness. He is, in fact, his brother's
biggest fan, saying of Jerry's "Coach" role, "It's the best thing he's ever
done. It's the perfect part for Jerry.";    It isn't even that Dick wishes he
were starring in a series. He complains half-heartedly that no one will let
him retire when what he really wants to do is take it easy.;    It's just that
when you're a living comedy legend like Dick Van Dyke, people expect you to
work. One might also figure that he could earn a series regular's role
whenever he wants.;    Not so. Despite the viewing public's seeming taste for
nostalgia, the biggies from television's past have had a tough go of it when
trying to rekindle their series careers. Lucille Ball found out the hard way;
likewise Mary Tyler Moore, several times.;    Dick Van Dyke, too, has tried
comebacks. He met with limited success in the 1970s with "The New Dick Van
Dyke Show," but in 1987, "The Van Dyke Show," in which he starred with son
Barry, lasted only 12 episodes.;    But just when we might presume that Van
Dyke, 65, would yell "Uncle!" and opt for his oft-stated goal of
semi-retirement, hanging out in his Malibu digs with his seven grandkids and
going sailing and traveling at every opportunity, he's back for more.;   
Sunday night's NBC made-for-TV movie "Daughters of Privilege" starred Van Dyke
as a Florida newspaper mogul locked into a power struggle with his three saucy
adult daughters.;    Van Dyke returns Wednesday in a guest-star role on an
installment of CBS's "Jake and the Fatman." He portrays an eccentric doctor
accused of murdering a hospital administrator, who spearheads his own
investigation to clear his name.;    Interestingly, both projects are designed
to serve as pilots for future series. "Daughters of Privilege" is intended as
a possible soap. The "Jake and the Fatman" doctor role could spin off into a
weekly drama series with Van Dyke as star.;    Dick Van Dyke -- the new Marcus
Welby?;    "Well, not quite," Van Dyke said. "But I do like the character a
lot. He's an old-fashioned doctor, a veteran teacher and practitioner. I could
see myself playing him all the time.";    He wasn't nearly so enamored of his
"Daughters of Privilege" publishing magnate, because it's "so vastly different
from my real personality.";    In fact, Van Dyke believes he "didn't do very
well" in the film part, "and it shows.";    It was the antithesis of Van
Dyke's role as comedy writer Rob Petrie on the old "Dick Van Dyke Show," a CBS
show that ran for five seasons (1961-66) -- four of them at the top of the
ratings. It alternated for No. 1 with "The Beverly Hillbillies.";    Van Dyke
reflects on that time with Mary Tyler Moore, Rose Marie, Morey Amsterdam and
Richard Deacon as "the funnest five years of my life. I got spoiled rotten
working with Carl (Reiner, the show's creator and producer).";    The success
of "The Dick Van Dyke" show is simple to trace in retrospect, Van Dyke finds.;
   "Carl was such a student of human behavior," he said. "He wrote to our
speech patterns, our rhythms, the way we really spoke. All we had to do as
actors was play ourselves. We really all were the way we appeared in real
life. That's the real secret why it works so well. It was simple but
brilliant.";    The show holds up well because of the timeless way in which it
was written, Van Dyke adds.;    "One of the smartest things Carl did, and
which shows never seem to do anymore, is leave out any slang or catch phrases
of the day," he said. "There's no current-event talk to muddy up the plot. It
was just human relationships, which are always timeless."  </TEXT>
