   CBS is adding three new comedies to its Monday
night lineup and shifting its schedule on every night except Sunday
as it looks to shore up its prime-time schedule after a second
third-place ratings finish.
   The network, which announced its fall schedule Friday, is
dumping ``The Equalizer'' and ``Beauty &amp; the Beast,'' but keeping
critically praised but low-rated ``Tour of Duty.''
   It also is bringing back TV veterans Richard Chamberlain and
Lindsay Wagner in new series. Chamberlain will play a Hawaii doctor
and Wagner a zookeeper.
   NBC announced a basically unchanged prime-time schedule earlier
this week. ABC is scheduled to announce its 1989-90 fall lineup
next week. The new season begins Sept. 18.
   To quiet the expected howls over taking ``Beauty &amp; the Beast''
off the schedule, CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters said:
``We are not abandoning the show.''
   He said the network has ordered 12 episodes as ``backup.''
   ``We don't want to rush it on the air, because it needs a little
bit of work, and we want to tend to it, because we consider it a
precious commodity to our schedule,'' LeMasters said.
   The producers were unconvinced, however.
   ``They went out to murder the show,'' said Paul Witt of
Witt-Thomas Productions, which also produces the canceled
``Heartland.''
   ``They did give us a backup order for 12 shows, but that's a
face-saving gesture,'' he said. ``We're not angry yet. We're still
too stunned.''
   ``Beauty &amp; the Beast'' had emerged as the only hit among CBS'
new shows in the 1987-88 season. This season, delayed by the
writers' strike of last summer, it was taken off the air
temporarily and tried in other time periods. Its ratings dropped.
   As for ``The Equalizer,'' LeMasters said, it ``was a very, very
tough call,'' but was dropped because of lackluster ratings. The
crime drama had been on the air for four seasons.
   The Vietnam War drama ``Tour of Duty'' remained for its third
season despite mediocre ratings.
   ``It deserves to be on the schedule,'' said LeMasters. ``It says
a lot about our network and the kind of shows we want to be
associated with.''
   ``Paradise,'' a Western starring Lee Horsley, and ``Murphy
Brown,'' a comedy starring Candice Bergen as a network newswoman,
were the only new shows brought back for a second season.
   CBS is adding three new half-hour comedies to Monday night in an
attempt to bolster ``Murphy Brown,'' ``Designing Women'' and
``Newhart.''
   Other returning series included ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``Jake
and the Fatman'' and ``Wiseguy'' and the durable soaps ``Knots
Landing,'' ``Dallas'' and ``Falcon Crest.'' New dramas were added
to Tuesday night instead of made-for-TV movies.
   All three of the news division's prime-time shows made the cut:
``60 Minutes,'' ``48 Hours'' and ``West 57th,'' the latter to be
``reformatted'' with the additon of anchorwoman Connie Chung.
   ``Rescue: 911,'' a midseason replacement, also returns.
   Gone are midseason replacements ``Live In'' and ``Heartland''
and the long-running ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' whose stars had not wanted
to return for another season.
   The new comedies are: ``Major Dad,'' starring Gerald McRaney
(``Simon &amp; Simon'') as a newlywed and recently retired Marine;
``The People Next Door,'' a fantasy starring Jeffrey Jones as a
cartoonist whose imaginings turn real, co-starring Mary Gross as
his psychologist wife; and ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' from ``Frank's
Place'' creator Hugh Wilson, starring Jon Cryer (``Pretty in
Pink'') as a young, hotshot Hollywood agent.
   The new hourlong shows are: ``Wolf,'' starring Jack Scalia as an
ex-cop working to clear his name; Chamberlain's tentatively titled
``The Hawaiian''; Wagner's ``A Peaceable Kingdom''; ``Top of the
Hill,'' starring William Katt as an idealistic surfer elected to
fill the unexpired term of his ailing congressman father; and
``Snoops,'' starring Tim and Daphne Reid, formerly of ``Frank's
Place,'' as Washington professionals _ he a noted criminologist,
she a protocol officer at the State Department.
   Here is CBS' fall schedule, night by night:
   Monday: ``Major Dad,'' ``The People Next Door,'' ``Murphy
Brown,'' ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' ``Designing Women,'' ``Newhart.''
   Tuesday: ``Rescue: 911,'' ``Wolf,'' ``The Hawaiian.''
   Wednesday: ``A Peaceable Kingdom,'' ``Jake and the Fatman,''
``Wiseguy.''
   Thursday: ``48 Hours,'' ``Top of the Hill,'' ``Knots Landing.''
   Friday: ``Snoops,'' ``Dallas,'' ``Falcon Crest.''
   Saturday: ``Paradise,'' ``Tour of Duty,'' ``West 57th.''
   Sunday: ``60 Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``CBS Sunday
Movie.''
