<LEADPARA>  CBS'S "Dallas" finale was the No. 2 show on television, but NBC was the No. 1
network in the latest weekly ratings battle.;    The two-hour episode that
ended the 13-year "Dallas" run gave the Texas Ewing clan its best rating since
1987. NBC, aided by back-to-back first-place finishes for its "Switched at
Birth" miniseries, won the overall network race, with a 13.5 average rating.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed CBS in second
place, with an overall network average of 12. ABC was third, with 10.8.;   
Part 2 of "Switched at Birth" was the most-watched show on television last
week. Part 1 of the NBC miniseries finished first in the previous ratings
period.;    CBS's "60 Minutes," which usually hovers near the No. 1 spot, fell
to No. 6.;    Some spring replacement series continued to do well against
traditional hit series:;    ABC's "Dinosaurs," about life in the prehistoric
suburbs, tied with NBC's three-year-old "In the Heat of the Night" for 17th
place, and NBC's "Seinfeld" finished in a two-way tie with network favorite
"The Golden Girls" for 11th place.;    ABC and Peter Jennings won again in the
network news race, this time with a 9.8 average rating. NBC and Tom Brokaw
were second with 8.2. CBS and Dan Rather were last with 7.9.;    Here are the
prime-time television ratings as compiled by the A.C. Nielsen Co. for the week
of April 29 to May 5. The information provided shows rank, title, network and
