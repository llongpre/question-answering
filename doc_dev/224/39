<TEXT>     Each rating point represents 931,000 homes.;    A repeat of CBS's "60
Minutes" was the No. 1 show on television. ABC's "20-20" placed second, and in
the No. 3 slot was a rerun of NBC's favorite barroom comedy "Cheers.";    An
encore presentation of NBC's docudrama movie "A Cry for Help: The Tracey
Thurman Story," which portrayed the real-life trauma of a Connecticut woman
left paralyzed by her abusive husband, ranked fourth.;    NBC's reality-based
series "Unsolved Mysteries" was fifth. CBS's original presentation of Stephen
King's "Golden Years" mini-series tied for sixth place with a rerun of ABC's
blue-collar, wisecracking family on "Roseanne.";    The premiere of ABC's
high-concept comedy series "Hi Honey, I'm Home" (which also plays on cable's
Nick at Nite channel) ranked 13th.;    In the network news wars, ABC continued
its winning streak, this time with a 9 rating. NBC was second with 7.5. CBS
