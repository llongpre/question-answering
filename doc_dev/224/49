   Our star, recently turned 50, is waking up,
smelling the coffee, and starting to give up that infatuation with
young love. But memories linger...
   Sound like the plot for a TV movie?
   It's actually the plot for television itself, advertising and TV
executives say, as shows like ``The Golden Girls'' draw big
audiences and stars like Bob Newhart, Andy Griffith, Angela
Lansbury and Carroll O'Connor shine.
   ``The audience is getting older,'' said David Poltrack, CBS
senior vice president for planning and research. ``The major
population shift is the aging of the baby boomers. When they were
young television was very youth-oriented.
   ``Gradually, the television networks are recognizing that the
advantage is to go with this aging baby boomer generation.''
   Johnny Carson, at 64, is still the most popular talk show host.
And when CBS' ``Lonesome Dove'' bowled over the competition last
spring with aging Texas plainsmen Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee
Jones, ``Perry Mason'' took the case and saved NBC from disaster.
The Raymond Burr role appeals mainly to older viewers.
   While the population is aging and older people have more
disposable income, advertisers are slow to recognize the changes.
   ``We don't go as far as CBS would like us to go,'' said Betsy
Frank, a vice president of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the world's largest
ad agency. ``CBS has always been more successful when it programs
for a more mature audience. Even ABC is making some concessions
toward older audiences. Its `ABC Mystery Movie' has older stars and
should do well with older viewers on Saturday night. But Fox
Broadcasting has succeeded by targeting a very young audience.''
   Nonetheless, Frank sees a shift to buying demographics of age
25-54.
   Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, agrees the
audience is aging and has more money, ``but you also have to look
at consumer habits.
   ``Is the person who is 61 years old who's bought Maxwell House
Coffee for 40 years really a good target for your new Vienna Roast?
I recognize that they have more income but I would be careful about
their buying habits.
   ``Our standard approach is to come up with a good show that has
as widespread an appeal as possible. `Golden Girls' is a show that
recognizes the graying of America but it's universal in its appeal.
It attracts teen-agers and young people as well. It defies
advertisers who thought it would be a show that would appeal to
only people over 50.''
   Tartikoff believes older viewers will be more of a factor in the
1990s.
   ``The phenomenon of shows about older people is quite new to
television,'' said Michael Dann, a consultant who formerly headed
programming at CBS and NBC. ``We always had older people in family
shows, but the shows were always about kids and their problems.
What you have now are shows built around the problems that older
people face. The remarkable thing about `The Golden Girls' is that
its audience cuts through all age groups. One show is a hit, two is
a trend. You clearly have that taking place today.''
   The problems older characters face aren't geriatric. They're the
usual mix of romance, sex, appearance, divorce, and the conflicts
of human nature.
   Although favorable demographics is still the preferred method of
advertiser selection, audience size is important and becoming more
so, Dann said. ``Years ago I personally canceled Jackie Gleason
with a 37 share and Red Skelton with a 36 share. You won't find a
television executive doing that today.
   ``Things are so competitive today with new delivery systems and
a fourth network that it's difficult to get a large rating for a
new show. I don't know of anybody today who would cancel a show
with a 30 share.''
   Poltrack said Fred Silverman has become adept at producing hit
shows that appeal to older viewers. ``In the Heat of the Night,''
``Matlock,'' ``Jake and the Fatman,'' and the ``Perry Mason''
movies all have older stars. ``The Father Dowling Mysteries'' was
dropped by NBC but has been picked up by ABC.
   In the new season, CBS' ``Island Son,'' ``Snoops,'' ``Wolf,''
``Major Dad'' and ``Peaceable Kingdom'' are aimed at older viewers.
So are ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' and NBC's ``The Nutt House,''
``Hardball'' and ``Mancuso FBI.''
   Movies and miniseries also lean heavily toward the older
audience.
   ``The networks are sticking with stars and shows that have
worked in the past,'' said Frank. ``It's not that we're seeing the
graying of television. What we're seeing is each network
concentrate more on the things they do best. Because older viewers
do watch more television, you may be seeing more older stars that
appeal to that audience.''
   Poltrack contends that the network trend toward more news and
reality shows is based on more than just the fact that such shows
are less expensive.
   ``When people pass 40 they become more interested in news and
information-based shows. The networks are losing audience to
competitors but the news and information shows are stable. You'll
see more of these shows in the 1990s.''
   A dissenter is Paul Schulman, media buyer for 14 big companies
representing $175 million in network ads. ``I think `The Golden
Girls' was a phenomenon in itself and all the imitations will bite
the dust quickly. When you buy time on shows that appeal to older
people you pay for an enormous waste of circulation. ``Young people
are still the key to high prices on a network. The most expensive
show on TV today is `Cheers' because of its enormous appeal to the
18-49 audience. `The Cosby Show' has a higher rating, but it
attracts a large number of kids. The aim of every network
programmer is to get another `Cheers' or `Roseanne.' At CBS,
`Wiseguy' doesn't get a big rating but that's the show all the
advertisers ask for because of its young demographics.''
