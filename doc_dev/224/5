   ABC's ``Coach'' is a winner.
   The formula _ lovable bruiser of a dad, plus teen-age daughter
equals laughs _ is as old as the Gipper. But in this incarnation,
some decent writing and an especially fine cast add up to a nice
little comedy.
   Craig T. Nelson plays Hayden Fox, football coach for the
Minnesota State Screaming Eagles, a tough guy with a soft spot for
the ladies in his life _ his sportscaster girlfriend, played by
Shelley Fabares, and Kelly (Clare Carey), his teen-age daughter from
a long-ended marriage who shows up to attend college.
   Jerry Van Dyke is a hoot as assistant coach Luther Van Dam, a
perpetually befuddled sort whose mouth runs more than the team's
best halfback.
   In Tuesday's preview episode, he must ride herd on a
buffalo-sized player who has to lose 11 pounds by Saturday's game.
``Maybe we could get him some of that hippo-suction they talk
about,'' Luther suggests. Bill Fagerbakke rounds out the regulars as
big, dumb Dauber Dybinski, a career college junior.
   The show, from ``Newhart'' creator Barry Kemp, has a preview
Tuesday night, then moves to its regular time period on Wednesday
where it will be paired in later weeks with the much-less-appealing
new ``Anything But Love'' _ but more on that some other time.
   In the preview episode, written by Mark Ganzel, Kelly lets slip
that she has a date with a professor. Dad promises not to interfere.
But through the process of elimination he finds the English
professor he suspects of daring to mess with his daughter.
   ``Forty, single and published _ just the kind of guy I have no
respect for,'' he complains to Luther.
   He pays a visit to the professor, and though he brandishes the
professor's bust of Shakespeare _ Fox thinks it's ``some president''
_ he is proud of the fact that he does not resort to physical
violence. Luther later agrees helpfully: ``If you didn't hit him or
break his statue or anything, that's good.''
   Wednesday's episode, written by Kemp, is the pilot for the show.
Kelly shows up and considers living with her dad, complicating his
long singlehood.
   It's tough out there in the big leagues, but ``Coach'' deserves
to have a nice, long season.

   Elsewhere in television:
   `FATMAN' REDUX _ ``Jake &amp; The Fatman,'' the show George Bush once
suggested everybody tune to rather than watch Democratic
presidential candidates, returns to the CBS schedule on March 15
with a two-hour episode. It replaces ``The Equalizer,'' which is
going on hiatus and WILL return, no kidding. In the new incarnation,
ex-cop J.L. ``Fatman'' McCabe has retired to Hawaii (Hey! Let's move
the show to Hawaii!) where he still gets involved in crimes and
teams up with special investigator Jake Styles (Joe Penny). ...
   JUST TRYING TO GET SOME SLEEP _ Charlie Gibson, who celebrated
his second anniversary as co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning America''
on Thursday, says the job is just swell _ except for the minor
problem of sleep deprivation. He figures since leaving the Capitol
beat in Washington to take over for departed co-host David Hartman,
he's lost 2,000 hours of sleep. That's 83 days, including nights. If
anyone has seen these lost hours of sleep, please send them to ABC.
Charlie will give you a nice nap as a tip. ...
   THOSE WACKY GOVERNORS _ C-SPAN will have live coverage of the
National Governors' Association annual mid-winter meeting in
Washington, D.C., starting Sunday. The meeting goes through Tuesday
morning. ...
   MOONWALKS DU JOUR _ The Arts &amp; Entertainment Network is off to a
head start in the race to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the
landing of Apollo XI on the moon, and will run NBC's coverage of the
events as they originally aired in July 1969 on the 20th anniversary
this summer. The coverage will air in three parts: ``Liftoff'' on
July 16, ``Moonwalk'' on July 20 and ``Recovery'' on July 24. A&amp;E
did the same thing on the Kennedy assassination 25th anniversary.
... The Showtime pay cable channel has acquired ``Moonwalker,''
Michael Jackson's 1988 feature-length anthology film. The
entertainer stars as himself in a series of vignettes, including the
41-minute centerpiece of the film, a battle against evil Mr. Big,
who tries to destroy the world by getting kids hooked on drugs.
