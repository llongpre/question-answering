   NBC will add three new shows to its prime-time
schedule and bring back the comedy series ``My Two Dads'' in January
and February, Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment,
said Thursday.
   The new shows are ``Father Dowling Mysteries,'' starring Tom
Bosley as a probing parish priest, ``Unsub,'' starring David Soul,
Kent McCord and M. Emmett Walsh as members of a crack Justice
Department crime team, and ``Nightingales,'' starring Suzanne
Pleshette and Barry Newman in a series about student nurses.
   Two series, ``Sonny Spoon'' and ``Something Is Out There,'' have
been canceled, while two others, ``Baby Boom'' and ``Tattinger's,''
are being taken off the air for creative changes.
   Bosley stars as a Chicago priest who can't help solving crimes
that baffle the police. He will be assisted by Tracy Nelson, who
stars as Sister Steve. The series will air at 8 p.m. EST on Friday,
Jan. 20, with a special two-hour episode. Thereafter, it will be
shown at 8 p.m. on Fridays. It's from Fred Silverman Productions,
which also makes ``Matlock,'' ``Jake and the Fatman'' and ``In the
Heat of the Night.''
   ``Unsub'' is the title of the one-hour police drama that will
premiere on Friday, Feb. 3, at 9 EST. The show, from Stephen J.
Cannell Productions, has the same creative team as ``Wiseguy.''
``Unsub'' is for ``Unknown Subjects.''
   ``Nightingales'' is the first series from Aaron Spelling on
another network since Spelling's longtime contract with ABC expired.
The show, based on the highly rated movie telecast last June, will
air on Wednesday, Jan. 25, at 10 p.m. EST.
   ``My Two Dads'' returns on Wednesday, Jan. 11, at 9:30 p.m. EST,
after leaving the air at the end of the 1987-88 season. It stars
Paul Reiser and Greg Evigan as two young men who learn that one of
them may be the father of Nicole Bradford, 14, played by Staci
Keanan. It also stars Florence Stanley and Dick Butkus.
   The one-hour ``Tattinger's'' reportedly will be turned into a
half-hour situation comedy, but NBC said it could not confirm this.
