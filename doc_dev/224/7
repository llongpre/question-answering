   CBS announced Thursday it is canceling
``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' and bringing back Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van
Dyke in separate comedies this fall as the network struggles to get
out of third place in the ratings where it ended up this season for
the first ever.
   In an effort to draw younger viewers, the network is adding a
number of comedies, including a half-hour romantic comedy based on
the hit movie ``Dirty Dancing.''
   ``Cagney &amp; Lacey,'' one of CBS's most popular and prestigious
shows, has been canceled, and the critically acclaimed ``Frank's
Place'' has been put on the shelf until a place in the schedule can
be found for it, CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters said.
Also held back for mid-season were ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' ``Simon &amp;
Simon'' and ``Jake and the Fatman.''
   Besides ``Cagney &amp; Lacey,'' other shows cut from the schedule
are ``Eisenhower &amp; Lutz,'' ``High Mountain Rangers,'' ``Houston
Knights,'' ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.''
   Van Dyke and Miss Moore, who played a married couple on the
1960s hit ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' will star in back-to-back
comedies on Wednesdays.
   In ``The Van Dyke Show,'' at 8 p.m. Eastern time, stars Van Dyke
and his real-life son, Barry, in a comedy about a turbulent
relationship between a father and son. Van Dyke plays a star of
Broadway helping his son run a struggling theater company.
   Miss Moore, whose yet untitled show follows at 8:30 p.m., plays
an independent divorcee named Annie Block who hooks up with a
recently widowed construction engineer played by Edward J. Moore.
Eileen Heckart plays Annie's ultraliberal mother, and John Randolph
plays his archconservative father.
   Patrick Cassidy and Melora Hardin star in ``Dirty Dancing,''
based on the movie starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. The
two play headstrong kids in the 1960s working at a resort owned by
her father, played by McLean Stevenson of ``M-A-S-H'' fame.
   Candice Bergen, in her first series, stars as a successful
television reporter in ``Murphy Brown.''
   Other new shows:
   _``Close To Home,'' a half-hour comedy about the relationship
between a teen-age girl (Royana Black) and her father (James
Naughton).
   _``Almost Grown,'' an hour drama that follows a New Jersey
married couple (Tim Daly and Eve Gordon) through three decades,
with an emphasis on the music that bound them through dating,
mating, maturing and enduring.
   _``Paradise,'' an hour drama about a Western gunfighter (Lee
Horsley) who unexpectedly ``inherits'' his sister's four young
children.
   _``TV 101,'' an hour drama about a journalism teacher (Sam
Robards) who tries to bring a high school newspaper into the
television age. It's the first show from Grant Tinker's GTG
Entertainment.
   LeMasters said taking ``Frank's Place'' off the schedule was
``one of the toughest decisions I had to make.''
   ``It's an extraordinary show,'' he said. ``But what it boiled
down to was, would I put it on the schedule to be bounced around,
or would I take the heat and hold it for an advantageous time
period.''
   He said CBS was committed to 13 episodes of ``Frank's Place.''
   ``The decision to cancel the Emmy-winning drama `Cagney &amp; Lacey'
was a close call and was not made until Tuesday,'' said LeMasters.
``But the show had suffered the slings and arrows. We felt it was
time for it to go off before it got beaten up more.''
   ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' was canceled in 1983, but CBS brought it back
the following year after a letter-writing campaign by fans.
   LeMasters said ``Kate &amp; Allie'' was being held back because he
wanted to take a more aggressive approach to Monday programming.
   LeMasters said the decision to retain two news shows, ``48
Hours'' and ``57th Street,'' in addition to the popular ``60
Minutes'' was unrelated to the writers strike. News show writers
are not member of the striking Writers Guild of America. LeMasters
said the shows were kept on the schedule on the basis of quality.
   The writers strike, which began March 7, threatens to delay the
beginning of the new season for the networks, though NBC will be
able start in September with prime-time coverage of the Summer
Olympics. CBS announced last month that it would delay the season
at least until late October.
   Talks between producers and the striking writers recently
resumed through a federal mediator.
   Here is the CBS prime-time schedule for the fall:
   _ Monday: ``Newhart,'' ``Coming of Age,'' ``Murphy Brown,''
``Designing Women,'' ``Almost Grown.''
   _ Tuesday: ``TV 101,'' ``CBS Tuesday Movie.''
   _ Wednesday: ``The Van Dyke Show,'' ``The Mary Tyler Moore
Series,'' ``The Equalizer,'' ``Wiseguy.''
   _ Thursday: ``48 Hours,'' ``Paradise,'' ``Knots Landing.''
   _ Friday: ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Dallas,'' ``Falcon Crest.''
   _ Saturday: ``Dirty Dancing,'' ``Close to Home,'' ``Tour of
Duty,'' ``West 57th Street.''
   _ Sunday: ``60 Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``CBS Sunday
Movie.''
