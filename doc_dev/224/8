   The CBS television network, attempting to rebuild its prime-time schedule after finishing this season in last place, will introduce 5 1/2 hours of new programming for the new TV season next fall. 

   The five new half-hour comedies and three new hour-long dramas announced yesterday are part of a costly and risky reshaping of the CBS schedule. 
CBS Inc.'s network hasn't had a new hit in four years. 
It may face an uphill battle: The writers' strike has idled production; CBS didn't show any film clips in unveiling the schedule; and in one case, a new comedy featuring Mary Tyler Moore, CBS hasn't even decided on a name. 

   CBS is renewing six series introduced in the past year -- including "Beauty and the Beast," Vietnam drama "Tour of Duty" and news shows "48 Hours" and "West 57th" -- despite their dismal ratings. 
Four other series will be bumped from the fall schedule but will be kept in production for later broadcast, a costly move. 

   CBS also is canceling eight shows, including "Cagney &amp; Lacey," the acclaimed show with policewomen, even though its ratings are considerably higher than some of the series that will stay on the air. 

   Kim LeMasters, who became CBS Entertainment president in the fall of 1986 and who conceded his future may depend on how the new schedule fares, hailed the lineup. 
He said it aims at luring younger viewers, whom advertisers prize the most, at a time when CBS's audience is by far the oldest. 
The changes also aim at dropping some old shows in favor of new ones that may have a longer life ahead. 

   Among CBS's new shows are the vehicle for Ms. Moore and "The Van Dyke Show," produced by former NBC President Grant Tinker's new company. 
It features an aging, longtime CBS star -- Dick Van Dyke -- and his son, Barry, who team up to run a faltering theater company. 

   Another comedy, "Murphy Brown," casts the actress Candice Bergen as a "wildly successful" TV star reporter. 
Mr. LeMasters approved the show despite his own doubts that Ms. Bergen is right for the comedic part, and even after she did a test reading that he said was "abysmal." 
He said he approved it on the strong urging of Diane English, one of the show's two executive producers. 

   CBS also will aim at the younger audience with the one-hour drama "TV 101," about a young journalism teacher; "Close to Home," a comedy about a daughter-father relationship; and a comedy bearing the name and plot of the film "Dirty Dancing." 

   But most of the nine new shows CBS introduced last fall also wooed the young, and most flopped. 
Only three return ("Beauty and the Beast," "Tour of Duty," and slick undercover-cop show "Wiseguy"), and none ranked higher than 49th among prime-time shows. 

   Two other new shows introduced last season will be in production but won't start in the fall lineup. 
They are "Frank's Place," about a New Orleans restauranteur and the most critically acclaimed of CBS's new shows from last season, and "Jake and the Fatman," whose major claim to fame was a plug by Vice President George Bush during a primary debate. 
Two older series, "Kate &amp; Allie" and "Simon &amp; Simon," also will be made for airing later in the season. 

   Among the shows CBS canceled: "The Oldest Rookie," "My Sister Sam," "Houston Knights," "The Law and Harry McGraw" and three recent midseason replacements -- "Eisenhower &amp; Lutz," "High Mountain Rangers" and "Trial and Error." 
One midseason replacement, "Coming of Age," about a cantankerous retiree couple, will be renewed.
