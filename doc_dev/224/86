<LEADPARA>  NBC won the first week of the May sweeps ratings contest with help from an
unrelenting advertising campaign for its ripped-from-the-headlines miniseries
"Switched at Birth.";    The first part of a true story about two Florida
couples whose infants were accidentally switched in a hospital nursery was the
most watched show on television last week, according to figures released
Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     NBC, which aired scores of radio and television ads trumpeting the program,
also won the overall network ratings race with a 12.7 average. ABC was second,
with 11.4, and CBS was third, with 11.1.;    Each ratings point represents
931,000 homes.;    Last week marked the beginning of the May sweeps, a
monthlong period during which networks schedule blockbuster programming to
boost ratings. Ratings during sweeps periods determine advertising rates for
affiliate stations.;    NBC's "Cheers" was No. 2 for the week, followed by
CBS's Sunday news magazine "60 Minutes.";     An episode paving the way for
the departure of series stars Susan Dey (who has since announced her return to
the series), Harry Hamlin and Jimmy Smits pushed "L.A. Law" into a two-way tie
for fourth place with CBS's "Murder, She Wrote.";    Here are the prime-time
television ratings as compiled by the A.C. Nielsen Co. for the week of April
22 to April 28. The information provided shows rank, title, network and
rating. The top 20 listings also include the total homes in millions.;   1.
