   The Who, a British rock band of the 1960s,
fell short of a sellout for their 25th anniversary concert, but for
devoted fans, their performance at the University of Colorado was a
hit.
   The band's reprisals of favorites _ from the overture to
``Tommy,'' the explosive ``Baba O'Riley'' and ``My Generation'' _
had the crowd cheering Sunday evening.
   ``We'll go as far as we have to go to see them,'' said Jon
Ellingson, 27, of Wayne, Neb., reverently dressed in a Union Jack
T-shirt and jeans. ``We've got our flags, our hats, our bandanas.
... We'll be listening to them as long as we can.''
   Fewer than 47,000 of the 57,000 tickets pre-purchased by Boulder
radio station KBCO were sold.
   ``Some people say it was the way we promoted the show, or that
The Who may not be the group that baby boomers wanted to see,'' said
KBCO's 40-year-old general manager Ray Skibitsky.
   ``If I knew the answer,'' he said, ``I would have sold out the
show.''

   Will they have to rename the show ``Jake and the
Trim Man?''
   William Conrad, 68, has lost a sizable portion of the girth that
led to the title ``Jake and the Fatman'' for his CBS series,
currently filming here for the upcoming season.
   ``I was down to 242 from 290 pounds,'' Conrad said in an
interview published Monday. ``This year, I was way down to 235. But
after I worked a couple of weeks, I was really tired. And I needed
to eat. So I know I've put back a couple of pounds. But I want to
get down to 220.''
   He says it hasn't been easy to lose weight in Hawaii, famed for
its international mix of cuisine.
   ``I do love that island food,'' he said. ``But the killer is the
mai tais and the chi chis _ Gosh! I can drink those all day long.''
   Conrad says the Fatman's role, rather than his waistline, will
expand this season.
   ``I simply didn't have enough to do,'' he said. ``I'd show up at
the end of the show and say something like, `Well, is everything OK,
Jake?' Now I look forward to going to work, not only because I have
more to do, but because the scripts have been absolutely great.
We're rolling.''

   Don Johnson has fans so worked up here to
meet him or find out where scenes are being shot for his new movie
that some have taken the extreme measure of seeking help from the
Chamber of Commerce.
   The former star of ``Miami Vice'' and director Dennis Hopper on
Monday began filming ``Hot Spot,'' a crime thriller and love story
that is touted as being in the tradition of the steamy ``Body Heat.''
   Very few residents in this town of about 10,600 about 25 miles
north of Austin have voiced concerns that the movie appears to be
headed to a solid ``R'' rating. Bedroom scenes between Johnson and
Virginia Madsen are to be filmed in a 96-year-old stucco mansion,
according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
   ``What I tell everybody,'' said Chamber Executive Director Debra
Gore, ``is if you have Don Johnson in town you're going to have to
expect that,'' she said.

   It's a long way from Butcher Hollow, Ky., to
Boston's Symphony Hall, but country singer Loretta Lynn and her
sister, Crystal Gayle, didn't worry as they waited to rehearse with
the Boston Pops Orchestra.
   ``Well, of course, I did sing one time with Luciano Pavarotti,''
Mrs. Lynn recalled. ``We did an opera song. Don't ask me which one.
You know how opera songs are.''
   The sisters were interviewed by TV Guide magazine as they
prepared for their ``Evening at Pops'' program, scheduled to air on
PBS stations Aug. 25. Their comments appear in the Aug. 19 issue of
the magazine.
   Miss Gayle said her more citified ``pop'' style is one reason for
her success.
   ``There's only one Loretta Lynn,'' she said. ``If I were real
country, I probably wouldn't do as well because people would say,
`She's just trying to sound like her sister.'''
   The sisters teamed up with the 100-piece orchestra to perform
``We've Come a Long Way, Baby,'' ``Wrong Road Again,'' ``One's on
the Way'' and ``Rocky Top.'' Mrs. Lynn was asked if the Boston Pops
was the largest orchestra she'd ever appeared with.
   ``Well, they're the loudest,'' she said.
