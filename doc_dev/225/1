   Fred Silverman's famed ``golden gut''
instinct as a television programmer still seems to be in working
order.
   Silverman, former network wunderkind, now an independent
producer, got CBS to move his faltering series, ``Jake and the
Fatman,'' to Wednesdays. In the most recent ratings period the show
had jumped to 21st place, up from 43rd the week before.
   The show also won the time period, beating NBC's ``A Year in the
Life'' and ABC's ``Hooperman'' and ``Just in Time.''
   ``If you have a show with inherent strength, it's to everyone's
advantage to try to save it,'' Silverman said in an interview.
   ``The time period can be as important as the show itself. `Jake
and the Fatman' had been on on Tuesdays, where it was up against
ABC's `Moonlighting' and later NBC's `Hunter.' It was tough
competition and we had no lead-in to speak of.''
   The lead-in for ``Hunter'' is another Silverman show,
``Matlock.'' And if ``Jake'' stayed on Tuesday nights, its
competition would be a third Silverman series, ``In the Heat of the
Night,'' on NBC.
   Silverman was head of programming at CBS when it was No. 1 in
the ratings in the 1970s. He moved to ABC as entertainment
president in 1975, and ABC was soon the ratings winner for the
first time. The ``golden gut'' tag came from his acknowledged
decision-making on gut reaction.
   In 1978, he became president of NBC, but in three years was
unable to budge the network out of third place.
   After Silverman left NBC, he started his own production company.
Besides the three network series, his company also produces the
highly successful ``Perry Mason'' movies for NBC. He also plans to
bring back ``Burke's Law,'' the 1963-66 ABC series starring Gene
Barry, as a series of TV movies. He is working on a movie series
for Home Box Office about a former cop who becomes a lawyer, a role
he says would be good for Charles Bronson.
   ``My area of greatest expertise at the networks was the
half-hour comedies,'' said Silverman. ``I want to get into
comedies. Most of the shows in syndication are comedies that I
developed at the networks.''
   In ``Jake and the Fatman,'' William Conrad stars as J.L.
``Fatman'' McCabe, a tough district attorney. Joe Penny is Jake
Styles, his smooth and mysterious special investigator. The show
made its debut last September.
   ``My feeling is that when you change a show to a new day and
time it takes about a month to settle in,'' said Silverman. ``The
history of television has shown that sometimes you can save a
failing show by moving it to a new time period. It's more than just
wishful thinking. `Bonanza' was on Saturday against `Perry Mason'
its first two years. It barely survived, but RCA wanted to keep it
on because it was in color and was helping to sell color sets.
   ``Then NBC moved it to Sunday nights at 9 o'clock. After that it
was in first place or near first for the next 10 years. `The Dick
Van Dyke Show' floundered its first year on Tuesdays. It was a
Procter &amp; Gamble show and they insisted it get a shot in another
time period. It became a hit on Wednesdays.''
   ``All in the Family,'' ``M-A-S-H,'' ``Hawaii Five-0'' and
``Cannon'' were also shows that benefited by a time change.
   ```All in the Family' started on Tuesday nights between `Hee
Haw' and `The CBS News Hour,''' said Silverman. ``I don't think
anybody had any great faith in it. But we were having trouble with
a show on Saturday night and moved `All in the Family.' It just
exploded.
   ```M-A-S-H' just died on Sunday night, then it was moved to
Saturday behind `All in the Family.' It became second in the
ratings. `Hawaii Five-0' didn't do well until CBS switched it with
`The Jonathan Winters Show.' `Cannon' started at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday,
where it was up against the ABC movie and `Marcus Welby, M.D.' The
next year we moved it to Wednesday and it became a hit.
