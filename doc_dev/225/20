<LEADPARA>  RENEWING "Northern Exposure," re-signing Carol Burnett and routing "The Flash"
back to comic books, CBS announced its new fall schedule Friday, a
comedy-laden lineup it hopes will continue the network's climb out of the
Nielsen cellar, where it fell last year.;    "CBS was the only network to
increase its prime-time audience, broaden its demographic base and lower its
average age this past season," network entertainment president Jeff Sagansky
said in a statement accompanying the announcement.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "The Flash," a very expensive, heavily promoted video version of the
comic-book character, was part of that drive to lower the age of the network's
average viewer, which seemed until recently to be just shy of Methuselah.;   
But the show never caught on and will not be back in the fall; neither will
"Dallas," whose cancellation was announced a few weeks ago. Also disappearing
are "Guns of Paradise," "The Antagonists," "Doctor, Doctor," "Good Sports" and
three shows that will never return from the dreaded hiatus: "WIOU," "Lenny"
and "Family Man.";    Occupying one of the former "Dallas" slots next season
at 9 on Fridays will be a new version of "The Carol Burnett Show.";   
Burnett, whose first variety incarnation ran 13 seasons on CBS in the '60s and
'70s, had been doing a half-hour sketch show on NBC the last two years. When
she wanted to revert to variety and expand to an hour, NBC let her go, and she
was quickly snapped up by CBS.;    "Northern Exposure," which crept onto the
network quietly last summer and managed to become one of the few critical and
viewer hits when it returned this spring, will be back in the same 10 o'clock
Monday slot, where it replaced Sharon Gless' "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" at
midseason.;    "O'Neill," which gathered too few viewers to survive on one of
the network's best rating nights, will return in the fall but at an even
tougher time: opposite "Cheers," the top-rated show of the season, at 9 on
Thursdays.;    Other shows being renewed and staying where they are include
"Murphy Brown," "Designing Women," "Evening Shade," "Jake and the Fatman,"
"Top Cops," "Rescue 911," "Major Dad," "Murder, She Wrote" and "Knots
Landing.";    As for new shows, the network will throw a pair of sitcoms at us
to start both Wednesday and Friday nights, while bringing on a new Stephen
Cannell show at 10 on Fridays and a comedic drama about a con artist in the
witness-protection program in Palm Springs at 10 on Saturdays.;   
Descriptions and times of the new shows:;    "The Royal Family," at 8 on
Wednesdays, brings Red Foxx back to television, as a retired Atlanta mail
carrier, with Della Reese as his wife, whose daughter and three children move
in with them.;    "Teech," at 8:30 Wednesdays, stars Phil Lewis as a young,
black music teacher who is laid off from his job in Philadelphia and winds up
at an all-white boarding school.;    "Princesses," at 8 Fridays, stars Julie
Hagerty, Fran Drescher and Twiggy Lawson as three single women sharing a New
York penthouse through twists of fate that could happen only on television.
From Barry Kemp, creator of "Newhart.";    "Brooklyn Bridge," at 8:30 Fridays,
is about an extended family in Brooklyn in 1956, when the streets were safe
and doctors made house calls. From Gary David Goldberg of "Family Ties.";   
"Palace Guard," at 10 Fridays, stars D.W. Moffett, Marcy Walker, Tony Lo
Bianco and Noelle Parker in a Cannell show about a master hotel thief turned
security chief.;    "P.S. I Luv U," 10 Saturday, stars Connie Selleca as a con
artist and Greg Evigan as the police officer posing as her husband. Earl
Holliman is her boss.  </TEXT>
