   The NBC network canceled its first new series of the fall TV season, killing Mel Brooks's wacky hotel comedy "The Nutt House." 

   The show, one of five new NBC series, is the second casualty of the three networks so far this fall. 
Last week CBS Inc. canceled "The People Next Door." 
NBC's comedy had aired Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. and in five outings had drawn an average of only 13.2% of homes, lagging behind the Jamie Lee Curtis comedy "Anything But Love" on ABC and CBS's one-hour drama "Jake and the Fatman." 
NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., hasn't decided on a permanent replacement for the canceled series.
