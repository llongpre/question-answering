CBS READIES 9 NEW SHOWS FOR FALL

"The Equalizer" and "Kate &amp; Allie" were canceled and "Beauty and the Beast" 
was relegated to backup status as CBS made room Friday for 7 1/2 hours of new 
prime-time programming for the 1989-90 TV season. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing them and such first-season fare as "Jesse Hawks," "Hard Time on 
Planet Earth," "Live-In" and "Heartland" will be three comedies, one 
reality-based series and five dramas, including one in which Richard 
Chamberlain, who achieved stardom on "Dr. Kildare" in the early 1960s, returns 
to series TV as a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' other new shows are also peppered with former series stars, among them 
Lindsay Wagner, Tim Reid, Gerald McRaney, Jack Scalia and William Katt. 
</P>
<P>
Of 14 series that CBS introduced in the 1988-89 season, only the Candice Bergen 
comedy "Murphy Brown" and the family series "Paradise" were renewed for a 
second season. Among the casualties were "TV 101," "The Van Dyke Show," the 
Mary Tyler Moore vehicle "Annie McGuire," "Dirty Dancing," "Close to Home," 
"Almost Grown" and "Coming of Age." Also being dropped come fall is the Tuesday 
night movie slot. 
</P>
<P>
Kim LeMasters, president of CBS Entertainment, said that declining ratings had 
necessitated the cancellation of the four-year-old "Equalizer" series, but he 
emphasized that the network has not abandoned the two-year-old "Beauty and the 
Beast," whose ratings also dropped this season. Twelve episodes have been 
ordered, he said, but they will not begin in the fall because the fantasy drama 
is going to undergo creative revamping. 
</P>
<P>
In a satellite press conference from New York, LeMasters said that "Beauty and 
the Beast" had suffered more damage from last summer's Writers Guild of America 
strike than many other shows because its literate scripts required extra 
writing time. It was dealt another blow by the Teamsters strike, he said, which 
forced writers to keep most of the action cloistered in the underground world 
that the Beast inhabits because that was "literally the only standing set" and 
new ones could not be built. 
</P>
<P>
Also being revamped, but on the fall schedule nonetheless, will be CBS' 
low-rated news magazine "West 57th," now to be anchored by Connie Chung 
following her well-publicized defection from NBC in February. LeMasters said 
the series' tentative new title is "West 57th With Connie Chung." 
</P>
<P>
CBS' other prime-time news hours, "60 Minutes" and "48 Hours," also will return 
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The fall schedule features an all-comedy night on Monday, with three new shows 
-- "Major Dad," "The People Next Door" and "The Famous Teddy Z" -- interspersed 
with the network's successful comedies of last year, "Murphy Brown," "Designing 
Women" and "Newhart." 
</P>
<P>
The lineup also will introduce an all-new Tuesday night, with the reality-based 
show "Rescue 911," featuring real-life acts of heroism by firefighters, 
paramedics and other emergency workers, hosted by William Shatner, followed by 
the hour drama "Wolf," a private eye show set in San Francisco and starring 
Jack Scalia, and "The Hawaiian," which sets miniseries king Chamberlain ("The 
Thorn Birds," "Shogun") loose on "Magnum, P.I." turf as a doctor at a large 
metropolitan hospital in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Here are descriptions of the other new CBS series: 
</P>
<P>
"Major Dad": Stars Gerald McRaney (of "Simon and Simon") and Shanna Reed in a 
comedy about a peacetime marine adjusting to life on a stateside base, as well 
as entering into a new marriage with a newspaper reporter and becoming father 
to her three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"The People Next Door": Stars Jeffrey Jones, Mary Gross, Jaclyn Bernstein, 
Chance Quinn and Christina Pickels in a fantasy-comedy about a cartoonist with 
a new psychologist wife and two children whose imaginary characters magically 
spring to life. 
</P>
<P>
"The Famous Teddy Z": Features Jon Cryer ("Pretty in Pink") as young Teddy 
Zakalokis, a kid from the mail room of Unlimited Talent Agency who 
inadvertently becomes the agent for the "greatest actor in the world." The show 
co-stars Alex Rocco, Milton Selzer, Jane Sibbett, Tom La Grua and Josh Blake. 
Lainie Kazan had been cast as Teddy's mother, but she left the show because of 
creative differences with the producers; the role is being rewritten as Teddy's 
grandmother and will be played by Erica Yohn.

Woman," "Jessie") as Rebecca Cafferty, the managing director of a large

Rebecca.
