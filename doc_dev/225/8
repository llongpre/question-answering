<TEXT>  KEVIN Arnold, our teen hero of "The Wonder Years," finishes junior high in
tonight's episode, presumably to start high school next fall, when the show
returns for its fifth season.;    But I wonder what Kevin will be doing if the
show lasts as long as "Dallas" did and returns for its 13th season in the fall
of 1999?;    Think what you like, but I doubt Kevin's still going to be as
winsome when he's 22 or so. ABC may have to chemically mess up the hormones of
actor Fred Savage, who plays Kevin, if they want him to remain terminally
cute.;    For that matter, I don't think I want to see Winnie Cooper, Kevin's
on-again/off-again girlfriend, after puberty gets through with her. I think
she's going to turn out to be one of those burly truck-stop mamas with a
shrill little girl's voice.;    I'm also reasonably certain Kevin's older
brother, Wayne, is growing up to be Sean Penn, which is sort of like not
growing up at all.;    And Kevin's pal, Paul Pfeiffer, already is outgrowing
his role as resident nerd. Soon he'll be big enough to punch out the "hoods"
on campus and won't need to be Kevin's sidekick anymore. In fact, Kevin's
beginning to look like Paul's sidekick.;    My point: "The Wonder Years" may
be one of those TV shows with a limited future. Thank goodness. The worst
thing that could happen would be for it to last 13 seasons, desperately trying
to retain its charm.;    The truth is: Most TV shows are programmed to
self-destruct long before that. I call it the "Shadow Syndrome" after the old
CBS series "The White Shadow," which went only three seasons.;    Even if the
ratings had been good, which they weren't, "The White Shadow" couldn't have
lasted much longer than that, because most of the leading characters were high
school kids -- played by guys in their 20s -- who were bound to graduate some
day.;    The only series with high school characters dumb enough to stay in
high school 13 years was "Welcome Back, Kotter." Fortunately, the network
wasn't dumb enough to keep it on that long. So, let's face it, no TV show
about school kids is going to last as long as "Dallas.";    Long-running TV
shows are rare. Most that manage to go past 10 years feature adult actors who
aren't going to outgrow their roles. They kept the original "Lassie" series on
17 years not only by changing collies every three or four years, but also by
dumping the kids at the first signs of either facial hair or training bras.;  
 "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" lasted 14 seasons, but if little Ricky
had grown up to be a plumber instead of a rock star, the whole family might
have been put out to pasture much earlier.;    Danny Thomas got 13 seasons out
of the show that started as "Make Room for Daddy" and ended as "Make Room for
Granddaddy." By the end of the 12 seasons logged by "My Three Sons," it seemed
like most of the sons had sons.;    So, as long as we're thinking along these
lines, why not speculate on what some of our favorite TV shows will be like if
they last as long as "Dallas"? Starting with:;    (box) "The Golden Girls" --
It's 1998, and the setting has shifted to the Balmy Sands Nursing Home, where
Dorothy (Bea Arthur) keeps spitting up on her bib; Blanche (Rue McClanahan) is
coming on to a guy on a respirator; and Sophia (Estelle Getty) is now a
tactless ghost who rattles her chains when everybody's trying to watch
"Murder, She Wrote." Rose (Betty White) visits when she's not on the lecture
circuit.;    (box) "Doogie Howser, M.D." is now known as "Calling Douglas
Howser," which reflects its progression from a whimsical comedy about a
16-year-old genius surgeon to a one-hour action drama about a trouble-prone
physician/detective (Neil Patrick Harris) who tackles cases with the help of
his faithful aide, Vincent (Max Casella).;    (box) "Full House" will be known
as "Full House: The Next Generation" by its 13th season in the year 2000. Bob
Saget and David Coulier left in the 1990s to host game shows. The show now
focuses on 23-year-old D.J. (Candace Cameron), the divorced mother of three
kids, who lives in the same full house, where she also takes care of her teen
sister Michelle (Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen) and her "uncle" Jesse (John
Stamos), an alcoholic ex-rock musician.;    (box) "Quantum Leap" enters its
13th season by moving to its 116th new time period. This season Sam (Scott
Bakula) will play a girl for the 38th time, give birth to a baby for the 21st
time and wind up in the body of a black man for the 17th time.;    (box)
"Parker Lewis Can't Lose" will no longer take place in high school by 2003 but
will take place in prison, where Parker (Corin Nemec) is a trustee and Musso
(Melanie Chartoff) is the warden. Musso's sex change operation was the
highlight of the ninth season.;    (box) "Jake and the Fatman," which became
just "Jake" in the 1994-95 season when William Conrad left to become
commercial spokesman for Fatburgers, continues with Joe Penny as detective
Jake Styles. However, CBS has warned Penny that if his rapidly gaining weight
tops 300 pounds, the show will be retitled "Jake IS the Fatman" at
mid-season.;    (box) "Family Matters," which became "Urkel's Family" in its
fifth season, now concentrates on grown-up nerd Steve Urkel (Jaleel White),
who's now counselor to his own "family" of nerds at an urban high school.  </TEXT>
