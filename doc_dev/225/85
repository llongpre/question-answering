<TEXT>     The rest of last week's top 10 was occupied by summer reruns.;    ABC's
"Roseanne" was second. NBC's hit sitcom "Empty Nest" was third and the
Emmy-winning, smart-mouthed TV journalists of CBS's "Murphy Brown" were
fourth.;    In the No. 5 slot was CBS's newsmagazine "60 Minutes." The
beer-swilling bar patrons of NBC's comedy favorite "Cheers" landed the No. 6
spot.;    ABC also won the overall network race with an 8.9 average rating,
according to figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. CBS and NBC were
tied for second place with 8.6 ratings.;    Each ratings point represents
931,000 homes.;    In the network news wars, ABC and Peter Jennings again
claimed victory, this time finishing with a 9 average. In second were CBS and
Dan Rather with an 8.3 average. NBC and Tom Brokaw were third with an 8.;
