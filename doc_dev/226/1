  [Text] Caracas, 8 Jun (EFE) -- The Venezuelan Government 
today reiterated its rejection of any unilateral or multilateral 
armed intervention by any country in Haiti. 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli said that 
Venezuela will not be a party--under any circumstances--to any 
armed action in Haiti to oust the military regime. Burelli 
reaffirmed Venezuela's willingness to cooperate in solving the 
Haitian crisis, mentioning both nations' historical ties. 
  The Haitian crisis was one of the subjects discussed during 
the foreign ministers' meeting held on Monday, taking advantage 
of the OAS meeting in Belem de Para (Brazil). 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister said that Venezuela is one 
of 
the nations that has made great efforts seeking a solution to 
the Haitian problem and for the restoration of ousted 
Constitutional President Jean Bertrand Aristide. Venezuela, the 
United States, France, and Canada are part of the so-called 
"Group of Friends" that have sought alternatives for the 
political crisis Haiti has experienced since Aristide left power. 
  Burelli also indicated that Venezuela will only accept a 
small group of Haitian refugees, after the Venezuelan Embassy in 
the United States has certified their qualifications to be 
received by the nation. The Venezuelan foreign minister 
indicated that it was necessary "to definitely clear up 
speculation," which has arisen on Venezuela's decision to accept 
Haitian refugees. 
  Burelli referred to the letter sent by U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher in which he requests Venezuela's 
cooperation to receive Haitian refugees. Nevertheless, the 
Venezuelan reply to Christopher sums up that "under current 
circumstances it has a flow of uninvited immigrants," who have 
made even more difficult the conditions "increasing poverty and 
aggravating the social order problem," Burelli indicated. "We 
would accept a group qualified and certified by our embassy in 
Washington," he added. 
  Burelli also denied some statements published by several 
local papers indicating Venezuela was ready to receive several 
hundreds of Haitian refugees. He admitted, however, that if 
Haitian refugees do arrive, their stay permanence will "only be 
temporary," dependent on the solution of problems in Haiti. 
  The minister finally ruled out the possibility of Venezuela 
becoming a Haitian refugee camp.
