  [Text] Caracas, 18 Mar (EFE) -- Official sources confirmed 
today the Venezuelan Government will study the possibility of 
renewing oil supplies to Cuba based on an agreement with Russia. 
  Venezuela supplied between 60,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil 
per day to Cuba up to the latter part of 1991, based on an 
agreement in which the former Soviet Union supplied a similar 
amount of oil to the refineries of state-owned Venezuelan 
Petroleum in Europe. 
  Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta said the 
possibility of renewing this agreement "is an international 
policy decision" which the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry will 
handle. 
  The initial agreement was suspended after the Soviet Union 
disappeared, but both Russian and Cuban authorities, who have 
visited Venezuela, have expressed their interest in renewing the 
agreement. 
  Arrieta did not reveal if the agreement will continue under 
the former premises. A Russian delegation that visited 
Venezuela in late 1993 reported the idea is for Cuba to pay for 
the oil by supplying them with sugar. 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas said 
this week Cuban authorities have "a great interest" in reaching 
an agreement on this matter and that it will be one of the 
topics to be discussed during Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomydin's visit to Venezuela in June.
