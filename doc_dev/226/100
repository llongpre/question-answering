  [Text] Caracas, 24 Jun (EFE) -- The serious economic, 
political, and social situation in Venezuela has triggered new 
waves of protests in several cities in the country during the 
past few days. 
  The riots in Bejuma, Miranda, and Montalban, Carabobo State, 
211 km from Caracas, resulted in three injuries, a fire at a 
commercial warehouse, and several attempts to loot shops. 
Citizens clashed with police during the "Day For Hunger" 
[Jornada por el Hambre] held on Wednesday. The event, which was 
to protest the high cost of living, was organized by the 
Federation of Consumer Associations in Montalban. 
  The main cause of the people's unrest is price speculation 
on 
staple goods and store hoarding. As a result of the protests 
over the last few days, the Chamber of Deputies approved an 
agreement that calls upon the people and the government to join 
efforts to find effective solutions to the deterioration in 
family budgets and to control speculation. 
  The speculative wave has prompted the government to look for 
agreements with merchants on consumer prices. Several 
parliamentarians, however, have demanded that the Executive 
Branch implement a "war economy" to control prices directly. 
  Lorenzo Tovar, the president of the Consumer Defense and 
Education Institute (IDEC) said that excessive and uncontrolled 
price increases in several stores is a crime. Tovar recommended 
that the government find a solution to price speculation in the 
country because it has turned into a state problem.
