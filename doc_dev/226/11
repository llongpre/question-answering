  [Text] Brasilia, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Celso Amorim stated today that his country endorses a consensus 
candidate for the election of the OAS secretary general to be 
held in Washington on 27 March. 
  Amorim said that neither formal nor informal consultations 
were made on the OAS vote during the two-day meeting of the 13 
Rio Group foreign ministers that ended today. 
  Brazil has promised to vote for Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria, contending that he would bring prestige to the OAS 
because of his successful record as president of his country for 
the four-year term that will end on 7 August. 
  The foreign ministers and other government officials who 
represented their countries at the Brasilia meeting, which 
focused on the search for formulas to eradicate poverty and 
unemployment and on reconciling positions for the continental 
summit scheduled for December in Miami, sounded their 
preferences for the 27 March vote. 
  Ambassadors from the 35 OAS member countries will elect the 
candidate to replace former Brazilian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Joao Baena Soares, who has served as OAS secretary general for 
two consecutive five-year terms since 1984. 
  In addition to Gaviria, the other two candidates are Costa 
Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus and Venezuelan Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Burelli. 
  Five positions have been identified within the Rio Group, 
the 
main forum for joint political and economic actions in Latin 
America. They are the positions of the three groups supporting 
each of the three candidates, the one advocating a formula for a 
consensus candidate, and Ecuador's undecided position. 
  Seven Rio Group member countries -- Mexico, Argentina, 
Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Colombia, and Peru -- support 
Gaviria; Chile, Guatemala, and Trinidad-Tobago support Niehaus; 
and Venezuela supports its foreign minister, Burelli. 
  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu today reaffirmed to 
EFE his 21 March proposal of seeking a consensus candidate, who 
could be any of the three candidates or someone else. 
  The initiative to seek a consensus candidate, Abreu said, 
"may appear to be vague, but it is a responsible one" in light 
of the atmosphere of confrontation between the candidacies of 
Gaviria and Niehaus. Abreu did not give further details of his 
proposal. 
  Abreu added: "An OAS election cannot be held in an 
atmosphere 
of confrontation. If we let matters take their course, we would 
be starting a new term of the secretary general with divisions 
already among its members."
