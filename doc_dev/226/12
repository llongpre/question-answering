  [Text] Caracas, 14 May (EFE) -- Venezuela will not support 
a military intervention in Haiti, a Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said today in Caracas. The government, however, supports 
pressure tactics to restore democracy in that Caribbean nation. 
  According to the spokesman, Venezuela will not join any 
armed 
multinational force or support a unilateral decision by the 
United States if that country decides to intervene in Haiti. 
  Venezuela is the only Latin American country that belongs to 
the Group of Friends of Haiti, which comprises the United 
States, France, and Canada. 
  The possibility of an armed intervention in Haiti has gained 
strength after the military who toppled head of state 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide appointed a puppet president. This week 
the military, led by Raoul Cedras, who headed the coup, 
appointed Supreme Court Justice Emile Jonassaint president, 
something the United Nations and the OAS have rejected. The 
United Nations agreed to tighten the economic sanctions on the 
Haitian military regime as of 21 May.
