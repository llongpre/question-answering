  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar (EFE) -- Uruguay has proposed 
seeking a consensus candidate in the elections for OAS general 
secretary to be held in Washington on 27 March. This proposal 
was made in Brasilia today. 
  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu pointed out that the 
initiative for seeking a consensus candidate "may seem a vague 
response, but it is in fact a responsible one" given the 
atmosphere of confrontation arising from the candidacies of 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus. 
  The third aspirant for replacing Brazilian diplomat Joao 
Baena Soares is Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel 
Burelli, who together with Abreu is participating in the two-day 
meeting of Rio Group foreign ministers which was inaugurated 
today at Itamaraty, the seat of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. 
  The Uruguayan Foreign Minister noted that the controversy 
between groups of countries -- Central America and the Caribbean 
support Niehaus, whereas North and South America endorse Gaviria 
-- may lead to a split in the organization, which could have an 
adverse effect on the tenure of the next secretary general. 
  Abreu neither gave many details about his initiative, nor 
did 
he put forward for consideration the name of a possible 
candidate. He said that his proposal had met with the approval 
of the Rio Group delegations, especially those from countries 
that fear a split in the OAS. 
  Abreu stated: "The OAS ought not to go to elections with a 
confrontation. If we leave things as they stand now, we will 
start the new tenure of the General Secretariat with an 
entrenched split." 
  Seven of the 13 Rio Group nations -- Mexico, Argentina, 
Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Colombia, and Peru -- support Gaviria 
on the grounds that his election will bring prestige to the OAS, 
as he has successfully discharged his duties as Colombian 
president, his four-year term in office expiring in August. 
  Although his country supports Gaviria, Argentine Deputy 
Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella seconded the idea of debating 
a consensus formula. 
  Within the Rio Group, Chile, Guatemala, and Trinidad and 
Tobago endorse Niehaus' candidacy. Only Venezuela endorses 
Burelli. 
  The other members of the group have not yet decided for whom 
they will vote. Uruguay is in favor of reaching a consensus on 
the candidacy, and Ecuador -- which had pledged to support 
Niehaus in 1993 -- has recently indicated that it will not come 
to a decision until the minute before each country's ambassador 
hands in the ballots at the OAS headquarters. 
  Diplomatic sources in Brasilia reported that if Gaviria 
decides not to run for office, Bolivia would be willing to vote 
for the Costa Rican foreign minister. 
  In response to a question asked of him by reporters, Chilean 
Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said that he will respect "the 
commitment" to vote for Niehaus made by former President 
Patricio Aylwin several years ago, when Gaviria was not yet a 
candidate. 
  This pledge is included in a joint declaration issued by 
Aylwin and Costa Rican President Rafael Calderon -- both of whom 
are Social Democrats -- after a meeting.
