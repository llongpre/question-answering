<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Venezuelan Government will send aid to Colombia, 
where an avalanche razed eight towns in that country's southeast 
on 6 June. 
  There is no decision yet on what to do with 35 Venezuelan 
families affected by the storm Bret and who are staying at Fort 
Tiuna, but the Venezuelan Government has already decided to send 
aid to the victims of the tremor in Colombia. Foreign Minister 
Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas has announced our country will assist 
with 100 prefabricated houses for the families who lost their 
homes. 
  [Begin Burelli recording] Armed Forces airplanes will be 
going. Helicopters may also go to see how we can help. 
Contributions in this case do not involve medicine, blankets, 
and medical teams composed of doctors and nurses, as is usually 
the case. What is needed now is the reestablishment of 
communications, electricity, and housing for those who have been 
left completely destitute. [end recording] 
  Burelli has also said no Haitians are coming to Venezuela. 
He has said reports on the arrival of 120 people from Haiti are 
the product of a lively imagination. 
  Evidently contradicting what was said last week following a 
meeting with Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy secretary of State, the 
foreign minister has now said the number of undesirable 
immigrants, who are causing problems in the country and 
intensifying the social and economic drama Venezuelans are 
enduring, will not increase. 
  [Begin Burelli recording] This is the government's position. 
I do not know the origin of the report on a certain group of 
Haitians and their plight; this has never existed. We very much 
want to help Haiti, and we help it at international forums. We 
have a historical commitment. Recall that Simon Bolivar was 
able to successfully and definitively return to Venezuela to 
produce its independence thanks to help provided by Haitian 
General Alexander Petion. Anything else is false. [end 
recording] 
  In conclusion, the minister has announced that on occasion 
of 
the Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 
13 June the Group of Three [Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela] will 
sign a free trade agreement that will count on the participation 
of businessmen from the three countries to give practical 
significance to the integration system.
