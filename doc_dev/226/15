<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Chamber of Deputies has agreed to condemn 
unanimously any U.S. military intervention in Haiti. In addition 
to condemning any unilateral or multilateral military 
intervention, through the agreement approved by the Chamber, the 
lawmakers also decided to reject pressure from the United States 
to receive quotas of Haitian refugees. The lawmakers also 
demanded an end to the economic blockade on Haiti because they 
believe it affects the innocent population instead of the 
government. 
  Deputy Herman Monzon, chairman of the Lower Chamber Foreign 
Policy Commission, gives more details about this decision: 
  [Begin Monzon recording, broadcast in progress] ...to 
condemn 
the possibility of an intervention in Haiti by the U.S. An 
intervention of this nature would be a costly operation and it 
would involve the possibility of loss of human lives and 
material losses. 
  I would recommend this money be used to develop Haiti. This 
is an historic juncture. Venezuela must once more assume 
leadership in Latin American to restore legitimacy in Haiti and 
to support the Haitian people. The Haitian people need the help 
of the entire international community. [end recording] 
  In addition, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas 
reiterated that so far our country has not received an asylum 
request from Haitian refugees. The foreign minister made these 
statements when leaving Congress after a summons by the Foreign 
Policy Commission regarding Haitian refugees. When asked about 
the number of Haitians who would enter the country, the foreign 
minister, who was visibly disturbed, said the following: 
  [Begin Burelli recording] You want me to say no flatly. 
Obviously, a country that received assistance from Haiti at a 
historical moment cannot say no. But we will only receive those 
we deem convenient. The three, four, or five Haitians who will 
help us investigate specific nuclear problems in Haiti will 
come, just like Manigat and his wife did. 
  But for heaven's sake, stop speculating that 150,000 
Haitians 
will come in planeloads or shiploads. Such speculations are 
ill-intended. I said here many times that only 35 Haitians have 
reached the U.S. ships off the coast of Jamaica. Of these, only 
six Haitians qualified for asylum and 29 others were returned. 
Just imagine, we will assess these cases in our embassy in 
Washington, and the ambassador will call here or send us a note 
when a Haitian who wants to go to Venezuela gets to the embassy. 
[end recording] 
  Finally, the foreign minister reiterated that the United 
States has not pressured our country to accept Haitian refugees.
