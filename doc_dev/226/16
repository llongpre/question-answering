  [Text] Brasilia, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Diplomatic source told EFE 
News Agency that some Rio Group foreign ministers -- who have 
been holding talks in Brasilia for the last two days -- 
expressed certain reservations about the U.S. proposal that 
Miami should host the next summit of the Americas convened by 
the United States. 
  Although the heads of Latin American diplomacy were 
enthusiastic about U.S. President Bill Clinton's proposal, some 
of them expounded the "inadvisability" of holding the summit in 
Miami, where anti-Castro groups have a lot of clout. 
  The diplomats who assisted at the Brasilia meeting, which 
ended today, told EFE that the issue was discussed at the 
meeting, but did not disclose what delegations were opposed to 
Miami being the venue for the summit meeting. 
  The reservations stem from the fear that anti-Castro groups 
will harass some heads of state on account of the independent 
stance adopted by their countries and the Rio Group concerning 
the U.S. policy vis-a-vis Cuba. 
  The reservations seemingly reached the ears of U.S. Vice 
President Albert Gore, who made a seven-hour visit to Brasilia 
-- which extended from the evening of 21 March to the early 
hours of 22 March -- to invite Brazilian President Itamar Franco 
to the Miami summit. 
  After the Rio Group meeting, Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Celso 
Amorim said Gore guaranteed him that matters alien to the summit 
-- alluding to anti-Castro Cubans -- will not interfere in its 
organization and agenda. 
  Amorim noted that it is "too early" to say whether Cuba's 
political and economic situation will be included on the 
December summit's agenda. 
  He further stated that both the summit's date and venue 
depend on the decision of the U.S. Government, which convened 
the meeting. 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli commented 
that, in his view, Miami was not a "risky" place to bring 
together all the heads of state in the Americas. 
  Several Rio Group foreign ministers praised the flexibility 
of the issues proposed by Clinton, who has asked governments to 
offer suggestions to complete the agenda. 
  The subjects put forward by Clinton to his Western 
Hemisphere 
counterparts include the strengthening of democracy, human 
rights, trade, poverty, the environment, and the streamlining of 
public administration. 
  Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner told 
EFE that his country is interested in highlighting trade 
liberalization, economic investments, and cooperation at the 
summit. Burelli, for his part, noted that questions like 
education, poverty, and access to technology had to be part of 
the agenda. 
  Despite the fact that they differ widely on the types of 
pressure that should be exerted on Cuba so it will adopt a 
pluralistic system to replace the single-party system, Rio Group 
countries have condemned the trade embargo on Cuba imposed by 
the United States more than 30 years ago. 
  Brazil and Colombia recently have become the target of 
criticism and threats by anti-Castro groups due to their stances 
on the situation in Havana.
