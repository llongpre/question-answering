  [Text] Caracas, 15 Apr (EFE) -- Venezuelan Defense Minister 
General Rafael Montero Revette said today he does not think "the 
installation of foreign military forces will be accepted" in his 
country; he was referring to the possibility the United States 
could install a military base in Venezuela. 
  Montero told journalists the topic was discussed during a 
meeting he had yesterday with General Barry McCaffrey, commander 
in chief of the U.S. Southern Command. 
  Montero refused to comment on whether Colombia will permit 
the installation of U.S. military forces in its territory. 
  "We cannot speculate on that, and I do not know if Colombia 
will accept it," Montero said. He said, however, the Venezuelan 
Armed Forces' position is contrary to a foreign military 
presence in the country. 
  Montero said during his meeting with McCaffrey they 
discussed 
relations between both countries' Armed Forces and the 
drug-trafficking problem. 
  Regarding President Cesar Gaviria's proposal of creating an 
OAS multilateral military force, he said: "Each country is 
sovereign, and we are not going to have a regional intervention 
force; we do not favor creating a multilateral force." 
  Regarding the internal political situation, Montero said: 
"Venezuela knows it wants peace and to overcome the present 
economic crisis." He ruled out a possible new military uprising 
if the government does not overcome the present crisis, contrary 
to what Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, head of the 4 February 
1992 coup attempt, has said.
