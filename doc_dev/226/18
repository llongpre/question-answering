  [Text] Caracas, 19 Feb (EFE) -- Today, Major General 
Egberto Artuza Delgado, National Guard [GN] commander, reported 
the Venezuelan Armed Forces are prepared to defend sovereignty 
in the face of a possible attack by Colombian guerrillas on 
border towns. The high-ranking officer said the GN, the Navy, 
and the Army have beefed up security in Casdualito, the 
Venezuelan town bordering Colombia, in anticipation of a new 
guerrilla attack. "We are absolutely sure they will carry out 
future attacks against our installations and we are ready for 
that," he asserted. 
  Artuza Delgado said the civilian population of the southwest 
region of Venezuela can rest assured the Armed Forces will 
safeguard their physical safety and will protect their 
properties. Meanwhile, the GN commander reported that this 
Venezuelan force had not arrested the Brazilian gold prospectors 
and also denied entering the Brazilian territorial space. 
  The general remarked the Venezuelan Armed Forces respect the 
borders and are perfectly aware of their location. He added that 
in the last operation conducted in the area bordering Brazil, 
Venezuelan military authorities destroyed 88 "gold prospecting" 
camps and 11 rafts used by the illegal miners. The officer 
concluded that "the illegal Brazilian miners, who profit from 
the illegal exploitation of our land, want to create friction at 
the international level so as to weaken the work being done at 
the border."
