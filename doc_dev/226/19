  [Text] Caracas, 20 Feb (EFE) -- The Venezuelan Foreign 
Ministry has announced in an official communique that Carlos 
Gottberg, the Venezuelan consul general in Colombia, was not 
hurt in a terrorist attack which took place in the Colombian 
city of Medellin early this morning. 
  The bomb explosion at the offices of the Venezuelan 
consulate 
did not inflict any casualties but it did cause serious property 
damage. 
  When informed about the situation, German Carreras Damas, 
the 
Venezuelan ambassador to Colombia, immediately made contact with 
the consular offices in Medellin and requested an explanation 
from the Colombian Government. 
  Foreign Ministry sources told EFE that the Venezuelan 
Government will formally ask the Colombian authorities for their 
cooperation in providing the proper protection to its diplomats 
on the territory of the neighboring country.
