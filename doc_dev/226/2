  [Text] Caracas, 3 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister 
Miguel Angel Burelli said here today that Venezuela has agreed 
to receive Haitian refugees on the condition that they comprise 
only a small number of refugees who would remain in Venezuela 
temporarily, until the crisis in the Antillean nation is 
resolved. 
  The Venezuelan Government's decision was announced after an 
official U.S. delegation headed by Under Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott asked the government of Venezuelan President 
Rafael Caldera to accept Haitian refugees. 
  The U.S. official called the Venezuelan offer "generous," 
and 
he recalled that Caracas had received the very first Haitian 
refugee--President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who was received by 
Venezuela after he was overthrown in September 1991. Talbott 
reiterated that his government wants a "peaceful and 
multilateral" solution to the Haitian crisis. 
  Burelli told newsmen that Venezuela "has informed the United 
States that it will not close its doors and that it will receive 
a group (of Haitians), provided they are temporary refugees who 
will remain until the precarious situation in Haiti is resolved." 
  The foreign minister explained that the Venezuelan Embassy 
in 
Washington will list the number of Haitians eligible to travel 
to Venezuela as an "undetermined number," although "this cannot 
be a large number."
