  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 12 Jun (EFE) -- Emile Jonassaint, 
the de facto president of Haiti, today declared a state of 
emergency in the country and ordered coupist General Raoul 
Cedras to take every possible measure to deal with whatever may 
happen. 
  Jonassaint also called on the Haitian people to unite to 
meet 
an invasion. "If we have to die, we will die together," 
Jonassaint said in a message to the people aired at 0130 local 
(0530 GMT) and in which he announced the measures taken. 
  In his message, he strongly criticized the international 
community for the plan to restore democracy in the country and 
the threats of a foreign invasion. Jonassaint said Haiti has 
done nothing wrong to foreigners and that he cannot understand 
the reason for a probable invasion. As for the restoration of 
democracy, he asked: "What democracy are we talking about? 
When did such a democracy exist in Haiti?" 
  Jonassaint accused Jean-Bertrand Aristide of squandering the 
country's wealth by "giving it to the whites." 
  Referring to Aristide's return to Haiti, but without 
mentioning the constitutional president by name, Jonassaint 
said: "If he is that strong, why does he not come alone?" 
  In stating that the Haitians will never accept a return to 
slavery, Jonassaint alluded to Haiti's Independence Act, which 
proclaims "liberty or death." 
  The chief of the de facto government also made reference to 
former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, who has been 
imprisoned on charges of embezzlement and theft after having 
been linked to the Haiti case. Jonassaint continued by 
referring to foreign leaders involved in the search for a 
solution to the Haitian crisis, saying: "Soon the others will 
face the same fate." [sentence as received] 
  The Haitian Constitution does not envisage a state of 
emergency, but it does cover conditions for a state of siege. 
Political observers in the Haitian capital believe that the 
declaration of the state of emergency is a disguise for 
establishing a state of siege to restrict the citizens' 
liberties. Because of the time at which Jonassaint's message 
was broadcast, few people have been informed about the de facto 
president's decision, and for this reason, it will be necessary 
to wait until Monday to determine what the reaction will be.
