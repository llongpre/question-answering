<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas has 
categorically denied our country is volunteering to become a 
camp for Haitian refugees. The official explained the small 
group of Haitians who qualify as political refugees will stay 
temporarily in the country. In addition, he described as 
exaggerated the remarks by members of the opposition who said 
the country is experiencing a crisis situation and already has a 
needy alien population. The foreign minister finds this is an 
exaggeration, oh well. Burelli Rivas also said Venezuela will 
support UN agreements on the mission that will be operating in 
Haiti but explained the solution to the problems of that 
Caribbean nation depends not only on the restoration of 
democracy, but also on the cooperation of neighboring countries 
to improve the living conditions of Haitians, who otherwise will 
emigrate. In the opinion of Deputy Geman Monzon, chairman of the 
Foreign Policy Committee, our country lacks the necessary 
conditions to receive Haitian refugees.
