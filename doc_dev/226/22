  [Text] Santo Domingo, 23 Jun (EFE) -- The Dominican 
Government warned today it will not allow the presence of 
foreign troops in its territory to reinforce the embargo against 
the Haitian military. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral told EFE: "In 
no 
way will we (the Dominican Government) accept foreign troops in 
order to reinforce the border." 
  The high-ranking official referred to Argentine President 
Carlos Menem's possible offer to send Argentine troops to the 
Dominican border with Haiti to reinforce the blockade against 
the military coupists. 
  Menem will present this proposal during a meeting to be held 
tomorrow in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
according to high-ranking diplomatic sources in Buenos Aires 
quoted by the Buenos Aires daily CLARIN. 
  Fifteen days ago, Argentina became part of the "Friends of 
Haiti Club," which also includes the United States, France, 
Canada, and Venezuela. 
  Herrera said the Dominican Foreign Ministry had no knowledge 
of Menem's proposal and explained that what the Dominican 
Government agreed to with the United Nations -- and "the United 
States is aware of this" -- is the presence of "approximately 20 
observers" who would work together with Dominican authorities. 
The deputy minister added that the mission would consist of 
individuals, including military, of various nations, but he said 
five or six military personnel "cannot be considered a troop." 
  He added: "We do not accept any foreign troops in Dominican 
territory to carry out something that corresponds to a bilateral 
matter. We are not at war with Haiti or anyone" and thus cannot 
accept the presence of military troops on Dominican territory. 
  He explained that the Dominican Government is complying with 
the UN provisions and that it will receive the necessary 
reinforcements, but this will be in advisory and logistical 
support. 
  After saying the Argentine Embassy "in no way" had made 
contact with the Foreign Ministry to discuss the Haitian crisis, 
he said his government had not received the logistical support 
which the international organizations has promised. 
  "We are absorbing the economic cost of maintaining the 
Dominican troops on the border with no assistance, up until now, 
from any international organization," said the deputy minister. 
Nevertheless, he said despite the heavy cost the embargo 
represents for the Dominican Government, his country is still 
guarding the border while the international community's 
sanctions prevail against the "de facto" Haitian Government.
