  [Text] Manaus (Brazil), 14 Mar (EFE) -- The Manaus Federal 
Police Superintendency reported today that the armed forces of 
Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Peru have been invited by 
Brazil to join a large operation to block the drug trafficking 
mafia operating in the Amazon River basin. 
  Superintendent Mauro Sposito said the plan was presented to 
those countries during the Sixth Military Exchange Meeting of 
the Armed Forces held in Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira last week. 
  Sposito said Venezuela already has confirmed its 
participation in the campaign that will be named the "Blocking 
Operation" [Operacion Bloqueo] and Colombia hinted that it also 
will support it. 
  The Manaus (capital of Amazonas State) police superintendent 
explained that the plan includes the establishment of an 
information network among the armed forces of the countries 
sharing the Amazon basin. 
  Sposito added that in Brazil the operation will cover all 
the 
federal organizations in Amazonas State and the national and 
multinational fuel distribution companies. Sposito said 200 
Federal Police officers will work exclusively on the operation. 
  Sposito also indicated that the "Blocking Operation" has the 
basic purpose of fighting drug trafficking at the Brazilian 
border with the other four countries. 
  Brazil also intends to be excluded from the list of 
countries 
used as transit routes by international drug traffickers. 
Sposito pointed out that Brazil and Venezuela have become the 
first countries on the cocaine route that starts in Colombia and 
ends in the United States and Europe. 
  Therefore, said Sposito, the Colombian Armed Forces' 
participation will be essential for the operation's success. 
  The "Blocking Operation" seeks to intercept the flow of 
cocaine on the Amazon River by integrating the Brazilian river 
police patrols in Tabatinga (at the Colombian border) with the 
Manaus police. 
  The operation also includes a follow-up by Brazil on actions 
against drug traffickers in Colombia. 
  Strict air traffic control in the Amazon region that 
includes 
the destruction of fuel supply networks and clandestine 
airfields, as well as the neutralization of the air space in the 
large Amazon basin, are the main aspects of the "Blocking 
Operation." 
  The operation also will include two radio centers, which 
began operating last November, in Tabatinga and Tefe (Amazonas 
State) to intercept the drug trafficking routes.
