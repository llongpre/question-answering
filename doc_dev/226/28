  [Text] Caracas, 19 Jan (EFE) -- The government intervention 
of Banco Latino, one of the largest in Venezuela, has affected 
the country's image abroad, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Fernando 
Ochoa Antich said today. 
  The foreign minister said the crisis of Banco Latino and its 
subsequent intervention, which the government ordered last week, 
has "damaged the image" of Venezuela in the international 
financial world. 
  The bank closed its doors 14 January due to a serious crisis 
of liquidity, after some 55 billion bolivars (some $514 million) 
were withdrawn over the last three months, according to reports 
by the bank board of directors. 
  Ochoa said the government's intervention is aimed at 
protecting the deposits of depositors and defining what is the 
real situation of that bank. 
  At the end of last year, Banco Latino was the Venezuelan 
financial institution with the largest amount of deposits and 
the third largest credit portfolio holder. The government 
intervention may have significant consequences in the national 
economic area. 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister said Venezuelan authorities 
must establish clearly the criminal responsibilities that may 
exist in this case, in which the savings of thousands of 
depositors and Venezuelan Government institutions have been 
endangered. 
  Venezuelan judicial authorities have ordered an 
investigation 
to establish if the Banco Latino directors have committed 
embezzlement against that financial institution.
