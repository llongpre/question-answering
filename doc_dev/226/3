  [Text] Caracas, 27 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuela will not accept 
impositions from the United States regarding Haitian refugees, 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas stated in remarks 
reported today. The foreign minister stressed that reports that 
the U.S. Government is forcing Venezuela to accept Haitian 
refugees are false. 
  "Venezuela is a sovereign country and does not accept 
impositions from anybody," Burelli Rivas noted, although he 
admitted his government may accept some Haitians for a brief 
period. He added that the Rafael Caldera government shares the 
concern regarding Haiti but added Venezuela has a foreign 
immigrants problem, and for that reason cannot accept any more. 
  Burelli Rivas added, however, that since Haiti is involved 
and that Venezuela is committed to searching for solutions so 
that democracy can return to that country, some Haitians may be 
allowed in for a brief period. "That was the response I gave to 
the U.S. Department of State," he indicated. 
  The top official said no Haitians have come to the 
Venezuelan 
Embassy in Port-au-Prince and added that the United States has 
two ships off the Jamaican coast to pick up Haitians and that 
only six out of 35 who requested asylum were accepted.
