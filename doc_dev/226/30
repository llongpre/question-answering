  [Text] Caracas, 10 Jun (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Miguel 
Angel Burelli Rivas said today Haitian refugees will not come to 
his country, and that topic "has only existed in the imagination 
of some." 
  The foreign minister acknowledged the U.S. Government had 
made a request to Venezuela to accept a group of refugees, but 
they will definitely not be received. "We have sufficient 
poverty and masses of uninvited immigrants here who are causing 
us problems, and we are not going to increase those problems 
with groups of foreigners," Burelli Rivas indicated. 
  Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom also commented on this 
matter, stating Venezuela cannot be tasked with resolving the 
problems of the peoples of other countries. The official added 
that "all the immigrants who want to cannot enter our country, 
only those who are part of a selective immigration program based 
on the national interest." 
  Opposing the arrival of refugees are political and social 
sectors, including the Senate Foreign Policy Committee. Through 
its chairwoman, Haydee Castillo, the Committee indicated on 
Tuesday that "the country does not have the economic and social 
conditions to receive those persons."
