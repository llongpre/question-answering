  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 11 Jun (EFE) -- Today, the 
organization known as "Capois-La-Mort," which includes 
high-ranking extreme right-wing soldiers, demanded strict 
measures against foreigners and the closure of the 
Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitiene airports. In addition, they 
demanded an end to diplomatic relations with France, Canada, 
Venezuela, and the United States and declared the ambassadors of 
these countries persona non grata. According to their demands, 
no foreign airplanes should be allowed to land at the Haitian 
capital or at any other airport. 
  The demands were listed in a communique issued today. Among 
other things, the document asks for border officials to ban the 
entry of foreigners crossing the Dominican Republic border. The 
document also demands cutting off water, power, and telephone 
services to foreign embassies and those "collaborating with the 
enemy." 
  The military group suggests and even demands giving the 
French, Canadian, Venezuelan, and U.S. ambassadors 48 hours to 
leave Haiti. If they choose to remain in the country, the group 
recommends limiting their movements as well as the movements of 
other diplomatic representatives, consuls, and members of 
international agencies. 
  They call for ambassadors and other foreign government 
officials to be ordered to remain within a 15 km radius of their 
official domicile. According to the communique outlining the 
special measures, in order for these people to travel outside 
the said 15 km perimeter, they must first get approval from the 
Ministry of Foreign Relations and the Armed Forces. 
  "Capois-La-Mort" considers the strict sanctions ordered 
against the country and backed by the international community, 
as "a declaration of war against the black Republic of Haiti." 
The organization urges the government to approve special "war 
measures," to enable it to respond to the "foreign aggression." 
  The written demands presented by "Capois-La-Mort" come while 
rumors of a foreign military invasion of Haiti spread. 
Observers see the demands as evidence that the military and its 
collaborators could take extreme measures.
