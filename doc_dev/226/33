  [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr (EFE) -- Andean countries 
receiving trade benefits from the EU as compensation for their 
fight against the drug trade today proposed that the European 
Commission [EC] extend similar benefits to Venezuela, which also 
is committed to fighting drugs. 
  The proposal to include Venezuela among those countries 
receiving compensation for their fight on drugs was made by the 
foreign ministers of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and 
Venezuela at a meeting they held today with Manuel Marin, a 
Spaniard who serves as EC vice president and commissioner for 
Latin America. 
  In remarks to EFE, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin 
said they had asked Marin "that the EU study the possibility of 
extending those benefits to Venezuela, a country that also needs 
trade compensation for allocating its resources to fighting the 
drug trade." 
  Several export products from Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are 
entitled to tariff reductions in Europe under a special 
paragraph of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), a 
mechanism whereby the EU regulates its trade with Latin American 
countries. 
  Marin, who met with the foreign ministers of Andean 
countries 
to listen to their proposals concerning the renewal and 
expansion of the GSP, will convey these proposals to the other 
EC members. 
  The GSP expires late this year, and the EU must decide 
whether to renew the foreign trade mechanism as is, amend it, or 
expand it. 
  The Andean countries, Sanin said, expressed their interest 
in 
having the GSP renewed and expanded and that the trade benefits 
the EU is granting countries involved in drug enforcement 
efforts be extended to Venezuela. 
  The meeting between Marin and the Andean foreign ministers 
was held simultaneously with the fourth meeting of Rio Group and 
EU ministers that began today at the Latin American Parliament 
building in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo. 
  Marin is scheduled to meet on 23 April with the foreign 
ministers of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member 
countries (which consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay) to hear their proposals regarding the GSP. 
  Attending the ministerial meeting are all the foreign 
ministers of the Rio Group members countries: Argentina, 
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, 
Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Also attending the meeting as 
observers are the ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and 
Guatemala, representing the Caribbean and Central America, 
respectively. 
  The EU is represented by the foreign ministers of Spain and 
Portugal; Greek Alternate Foreign Affairs Minister Theodoros 
Pangalos; and deputy ministers and vice ministers from the other 
EU member countries (Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, the 
Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom). 
  Since the signing of the Rome Declaration (1990) -- which 
institutionalized talks between the EU and the Rio Group, the 
main Latin American forum for concerted political and economic 
action and for promoting integration -- the two sides have held 
three meetings: the first in Luxembourg (April 1991), the second 
in Santiago, Chile (May 1992), and the third in Copenhagen 
(April 1993).
