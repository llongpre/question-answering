  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 7 Mar (EFE) -- Port-au-Prince Mayor 
Evans Paul, who is also leader of the National Front for Change 
and Democracy (FNCD) today proposed a modification to the plan 
approved Wednesday [2 March] by the Chamber of Deputies to try 
to find a solution to the new deadlock in the Haitian crisis 
created by the [congressional] resolution. 
  Paul recommended "a commitment acceptable for President 
(Jean- Bertrand) Aristide, as well as for the other sectors 
involved in the crisis." In an interview for EFE, Paul blamed 
the international community and domestic sectors that have 
promoted the current deadlock, for the Haitian crisis. 
  "It is necessary to modify the proposal, which cannot be 
viewed as a plan yet. In order for it to become a plan, 
President Aristide and the other sectors must accept it," Paul 
said. "The international community has not adopted a firm 
position on the measures contained in the Governor's Island 
Accord and the ultimatum given to the military leaders by four 
countries (France, Canada, the United States, and Venezuela) 
which expired on 15 January," Paul stressed. 
  The FNCD leader said that some sectors support the dilatory 
tactics that have prolonged the Haitian crisis since 30 
September 1991, when a group of military leaders overthrew 
Constitutional President Aristide. Paul also mentioned the lack 
of cohesion in the democratic sector, which has favored a "fatal 
confusion and a rotten situation," adding that the same 
situation prevails in the parliament. 
  The political leader said that different groups are acting 
in 
the Haitian political scene against democracy. "While some 
people are reacting emotionally and others are trying to 
maintain the situation of crisis, we must admit that there are 
others who are acting in good faith," Paul added. 
  With regard to differences expressed within the FNCD and the 
support for the parliamentarian resolution from the Party of the 
National Congress of Democratic Movements (CONACOM), Paul said 
those are normal situations in the various fronts and political 
coalitions. As an example, he mentioned the Nicaraguan 
Sandinist National Liberation Front and the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front in El Salvador. 
  Paul, who said he is confident some legislators will change 
their position, said that "the FNCD's position has not changed 
and is based on strengthening democracy and respecting the 
democratic rules of the game."
