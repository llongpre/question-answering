  [Text] Sao Paulo, 17 Mar (EFE) -- Argentine Senator Luis 
Rubeo, secretary of the Latin American Parliament [Parlatino] 
committees, on 17 March dismissed rumors spread from Venezuela 
that the Venezuelan Congress might not join Parlatino, which 
groups 22 countries in the region. 
  Asked about the absence of Venezuelan deputies during the 
committee meetings being held at the Parlatino's permanent seat 
in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Sen. Rubeo said: "This is a natural 
consequence of political readjustments that occur after new 
officials are elected." 
  The Venezuelan congressmen who are members of the Parlatino 
committees could not travel to Sao Paulo because President 
Rafael Caldera's Convergence Party, which recently became the 
ruling party, demanded a revision of all international 
activities by the Venezuelan Congress. As a result, the 
deputies' trip was not authorized. 
  Rubeo said: "We support the winds of austerity blowing in 
the 
brotherly country, but we are sure that Venezuela will not give 
up the privileged positions it has won in the international 
community thanks to its fervent effort to support continental 
integration." 
  "Through me, Parlatino urges the Venezuelan congressmen to 
continue participating in this task aimed at drafting programs 
that will end hunger and inequalities in the continent," Sen. 
Rubeo said. 
  Venezuelan Deputy Henry Bencid, Parlatino vice president for 
Venezuela, said in Caracas on 16 March that his country risks 
staying out of Parlatino because "Convergence opposes Congress 
complying with its international commitments." 
  According to Bencid, who is a leader of the opposition 
Social-Christian Party [COPEI], Convergence's attitude results 
from a "misunderstood" position of austerity, which has been 
announced by the new administration. 
  The Venezuelan deputy asserted that a revision of the 
Venezuelan Congress' international activities, as demanded by 
President Caldera, might imply derogation of the law that 
approved Parlatino's institutionalization. 
  Bencid said that if this occurred, the Venezuelan Congress 
would have to quit Parlatino and lose the benefits granted by it. 
  Currently, several Venezuelan congressmen occupy important 
positions in Parlatino. The president, for example, is Social 
Democratic Action Party Deputy Humberto Celli, and the vice 
presidents of three committees are Venezuelan deputies.
