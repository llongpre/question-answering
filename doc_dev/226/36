  [Text] Caracas, 5 Jun (AFP) -- Starting this week, Haitians 
fleeing their country will be taken to three U.S. ships [not 
further identified] anchored off Jamaica, and those who can 
demonstrate refugee status will travel to any member nation of 
the group "Friends of Haiti," it was reported today. 
  Guy Prim, representative for Venezuela and the Caribbean of 
the UN Office of the High Commisssioner on Human Rights [UNHCR], 
said this international organization will pay for the operation, 
which is expected to amount to about $1.5 million. 
  In statements to the Caracas media, Prim said the difficult 
situation facing Haiti makes its 6.9 million inhabitants 
"potential asylum seekers." He announced that starting this 
week, Haitians who flee their country will be housed aboard 
three U.S. ships anchored off the Port of Kingston, Jamaica. 
One of the ships will serve as a hospital. 
  He added that two commissions will be tasked with 
classifying 
the guests. These commissions will include an UNHCR commission 
consisting of 10 jurists and 10 translators and a commission of 
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service consisting of 50 
officials. 
  Prim said those who manage to demonstrate refugee status 
during an interview will be informed about the possibility of 
going to any member country of the group "Friends of Haiti." 
This group is composed of Canada, United States, France, 
Argentina, and Venezuela. 
  Prim, however, voiced his concern that Haitians might not 
want to go to other countries because they are obsessed with 
traveling to the United States. He bases his concern on a 
recent experience when a majority of a group of Haitians who 
failed to reach U.S. coasts returned to their native island. 
  In Venezuela, Prim added, the Social Pastoral Office of the 
Bishop's Conference reached an agreement with the UNHCR to offer 
lodging to Haitians welcomed by the administration of President 
Rafael Caldera. Yesterday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel 
Angel Burelli Rivas said his country will welcome refugees for 
as long as the difficult situation on the island persists.
