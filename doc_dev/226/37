<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli has strongly 
criticized the Argentine Senate's statement on the legal 
proceedings of the trial of former Venezuelan President Carlos 
Andres Perez. Burelli believes the Argentine parliament has no 
right to interfere in Venezuelan affairs. Vicente Briceno 
reports: 
  [Briceno] As the foreign minister left the special Council 
of 
Ministers meeting at Miraflores Palace, he said the branches of 
the Venezuelan Government have properly handled the case of 
former President Perez. Despite the Argentine Senate's 
statement, he said Venezuela will not break relations with the 
Argentine Government, because the Senate issued that statement, 
not the executive branch. He also said Venezuela will not send a 
protest note to Argentina, because the Venezuelan diplomatic 
delegation in that country handles these types of statements by 
expressing regret over them. 
  [Begin Burelli recording] The government branches have 
seriously and flawlessly handled Perez's case. Congress, in its 
own right, and the judicial branch have intervened in the case, 
thus allowing the former president to enjoy the rights to which 
he is entitled. The process has been so impeccable that Perez's 
own party had expelled him as the judicial branch made a 
decision. The Venezuelan Senate and state would never dare give 
opinions on decisions that foreign governments have made. [end 
recording] 
  [Briceno] Burelli again broached the controversial case of 
the Haitians who will reportedly be granted asylum in Venezuela, 
a case which has triggered opposing opinions in the executive 
cabinet. He has said that only those Haitians whom the 
government has approved will be granted asylum and that our 
embassy will select them. The exact number of these Haitians has 
yet to be determined, however.
