  [Text] Caracas, 10 Feb (EFE) -- Venezuelan Omar Baralt, 
head of the Presidential Commission on Border Affairs currently 
negotiating with Colombia, today reported that more than 80,000 
Colombian guerrillas are operating along the vast Colombian 
border region. 
  The official pointed out that the worst infiltration in 
Venezuela lies in and around the northwestern town of Sierra de 
Perija, where authorities have neglected some 400 km in which 37 
fronts of the Colombian guerrillas operate. Baralt said that 
while only 2 million Venezuelans live in this area, it is 
inhabited by some 7 million Colombians. According to Baralt, 
"between fighters and members of the logistical apparatus, the 
guerrillas have 80,000 men in the area." 
  Baralt stressed that the Venezuelan Government has to 
persuade the Colombian Government to open a dialogue with the 
guerrillas because the Colombian Army cannot be deployed across 
the border. Baralt added that Venezuela cannot get directly 
involved in this problem, but that it must seek a diplomatic 
solution because belligerent actions could mean the destruction 
of the country's main agricultural centers. 
  The Venezuelan official said that migrant workers represent 
another border problem, because Colombians provide most of the 
manual labor in the agricultural and cattle zones. He believes 
this problem must be resolved by issuing identification cards to 
illegal immigrants to integrate them into the country's 
production process. 
  Baralt pointed out that one of the positive aspects of the 
two countries' bilateral relations is the 70 percent decrease in 
smuggling activities because of the creation of a free trade 
zone between Colombia and Venezuela. He added, however, that 
Colombia's Maicao zone has become the foremost international 
trade center in the Caribbean Basin, with imports amounting to 
$1.5 billion in 1993. He recommended the signing of a bilateral 
agreement to regulate trade in this zone.
