  [Text] Lima, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuelan Congressman Paciano 
Padron, the president of the Andean Parliament, stated today 
that the Andean Parliament is opposed to the commercial blockade 
against Cuba and Haiti as a way to restore democracy in both 
countries. 
  In remarks to the magazine CCD [Democratic Constituent 
Congress], the official mouthpiece of the Peruvian Congress, 
Padron said: "It is a bad idea to continue the blockade against 
Cuba and Haiti because the people have the right to survive and 
subsist." 
  The Andean Parliament president said: "It is not ethical to 
submit a nation to starvation in the name of democracy." 
  Padron added that commercial blockades, like that imposed 
recently on Haiti and the one that has prevailed for 32 years 
against Cuba, "affect the people, not the generals or officials 
who continue drinking wine and eating meat while the people have 
nothing to quench their thirst or assuage their hunger." 
  The Venezuelan congressman asked the OAS to find a political 
solution to the Haitian and Cuban problems and to conduct all 
necessary diplomatic negotiations "instead of settling for less 
humane alternatives."
