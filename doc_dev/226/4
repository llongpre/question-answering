  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister 
Miguel Angel Burelli, who is a candidate for the post of general 
secretary of the OAS, said today in Brasilia that the OAS, which 
comprises 35 nations of the continent, could become a great 
organization. 
  "An inferiority complex has been created regarding the OAS, 
and it is necessary to overcome it," Burelli said. He 
challenged the other candidates, Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, to a 
television debate -- possibly over the U.S. CNN Channel. 
  Regarding the acceptance of his initiative, the Venezuelan 
foreign minister told EFE that "the ball is in their court." 
  Burelli is participating in Brasilia in a 48-hour meeting of 
the foreign ministers and government delegates of the 13 
countries of the Rio Group, the main mechanism for political and 
economic agreement within Latin America. 
  The ambassadors of OAS member countries will elect a 
successor of the Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena Soares, who has 
occupied the post of OAS secretary general for two consecutive 
5-year periods since 1984. 
  Referring to Gaviria, Burelli said that never -- during the 
history of the organization -- has the United States ever 
proposed a candidate on its own initiative. 
  Gaviria's candidacy is supported by several Rio Group 
countries including Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and 
Argentina. 
  Burelli highlighted the OAS system of organization, which 
has 
a developed administrative apparatus and a democratic hue 
because each nation, no matter how large or small, has one vote. 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister -- who was Venezuelan 
ambassador to Washington, London, and Bogota -- added that he 
will not campaign during the Rio Group meeting. He said: "I 
have come to the meeting and that is all." 
  Burelli said that "there are new factors" to evaluate 
regarding the Cuban situation. "The Cuban people have suffered 
a lot. There cannot be the same confrontation of ideas now as 
in bygone days." 
  Baena Soares said he believes it is necessary to consider 
the 
reintegration of Cuba into the OAS because "the 1990's are not 
the 1960's." 
  Burelli complained to EFE about the interpretation by the 
international media of the Venezuelan situation following the 
December 1993 elections in which Rafael Caldera became president. 
  "The international press is not convinced that ethical 
standards are being changed" in Venezuela, he explained. 
  Burelli said President Caldera is willing to "completely 
reorganize the family" of his country, by offering pardons to 
all military officers who rose up in arms against the government 
of then President Carlos Andres Perez. 
  He added that those who found refuge in Peru are now 
returning, adding that five officers being held the San Carlos 
Garrison in Caracas will be released "at any moment."
