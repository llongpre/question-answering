  [Text] Caracas, 2 Feb (EFE) -- Today, Venezuelan President 
Rafael Caldera announced the soldiers who participated in the 
two Venezuelan 1992 coup attempts will be freed. 
  Caldera made this announcement after assuming his post as 
eighth constitutional president of Venezuela in a special 
ceremony held at the Venezuelan Congress. 
  The veteran politician, who is 78 years old, said the 
coupist 
soldiers who are still under arrest, 124 of them, will be 
released in a legal way that will not create tensions in the 
Armed Forces.
