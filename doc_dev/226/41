  [Text] Caracas, 1 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuelan President Rafael 
Caldera announced today that the economic guarantees established 
in the Venezuelan constitution have been reinstated. 
  Caldera, who took over on 2 February, had suspended economic 
guarantees in order to implement several measures to reorganize 
the Venezuelan economy. The reestablishment of economic 
guarantees is one of the petitions that had been made by 
Venezuelan entrepreneurs to the Christian Democratic president.
