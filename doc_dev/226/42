  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 22 
March. 
  Alfredo Acedo Machado, president of the Acedo Mendoza group, 
today addressed a group of Venezuelan and Colombian investors 
who met in Caracas and spoke about corporate business strategies 
and growth strategies of Venezuelan corporations. Acedo Machado 
pointed out that movements of capital in Latin America have 
grown considerably and that foreign investments in 1992 in six 
countries of the region amounted to $12.3 billion. He added 
that the main investments between 1992 and 1993 were registered 
in Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA

  Javier Gomez-Navarro, the Spanish minister of commerce and 
tourism who is visiting Caracas, announced that Spain has 
granted the greatest amount of soft credits to Venezuela, to the 
tune of $300 million. Gomez-Navarro added that he seeks to 
reestablish commercial contacts in the service and tourism 
sectors. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 23) 
  The Central Bank of Venezuela today sold bonds in the amount 
of $327 million that will mature in 91 and 182 days. The bank

advancement of inflation. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2326 GMT 16 Mar
