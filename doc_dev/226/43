  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 18 May (EFE) -- Today, 
Constitutional Prime Minister Robert Malval urged Haitian 
university students to continue the struggle to preserve 
democratic achievements and to defeat conservative forces. 
  Meanwhile, in a radio and television message, de facto 
President Emile Jonassaint called for Haitian unity. Malval and 
Jonassaint spoke on separate occasions during the celebrations 
to mark University and Flag Day. According to Jonassaint, this 
unity is as important "as the unity that led to the creation of 
the flag on 18 May 1803." 
  The U.S., Venezuelan, Taiwan, and Mexican ambassadors, the 
Canadian and French charges d'affaires, and the Papal Nuncio met 
with Malval at his Chante Brise home to express their support. 
In statements to journalists, the diplomats noted that their 
presence at Malval's home clearly expresses their rejection of 
the "supposed" de facto government and their support for 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown on 30 
September 1991 by a military group led by General Raoul Cedras. 
The diplomats added that Aristide and Malval represent the 
constitutional legitimacy of Haiti.
