  [Text] Caracas, 1 May (EFE) -- Antonio Casas Gonzalez, who 
was appointed new president of Banco Central of Venezuela (BCV), 
took office today, Sunday, and called an urgent meeting of the 
bank's board of directors. 
  Casas Gonzalez was appointed BCV president after the 
unexpected 26 April resignation of Ruth de Krivoy, who held that 
post for the past two years. 
  Krivoy resigned alleging deep differences with the way the 
government had handled the delicate financial crisis in 
mid-January when Banco Latino, the country's second most 
important one at the time, was intervened. 
  After the Latino Bank crisis, an additional eight banks had 
to receive assistance of the state, which diverted almost 5 
billion [currency unspecified] in financial aid to prevent a 
massive bankruptcy of banks. 
  During the past weeks President Rafael Caldera assigned 
Gustavo Roosen, intervener of Banco Latino, to design a plan 
that will restore confidence in the financial system and lower 
the ceiling on interest rates, which is over 60 percent. 
  This decision by Caldera and other decisions by Roosen to 
carry out the assigned task were viewed by Krivoy as state 
interference in monetary policy affairs, which Venezuelan laws 
reserve for the BCV and, therefore, shows a lack of respect for 
the bank's autonomy. 
  After learning of Krivoy's resignation, the government and 
Senate agreed to appoint Casas Gonzalez, who up until that time 
had represented the state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum before the 
British Government and other European countries. 
  Following Krivoy's resignation, the local stock market got 
out of control "completely, and the Venezuelan bolivar suffered" 
a heavy devaluation compared to the U.S. dollar. This will be 
the first problem the new BCV authorities will resolve. 
  Economists Domingo Maza Zavala and Miguel Ignacio Purroy and 
Casas Gonzalez were sworn in as new BCV directors. 
  Casas Gonzalez, an economist, was deputy minister of 
development between 1969 and 1972 and planning minister between 
1972 and 1974, both times under the Caldera administration. The 
Senate unanimously supported his appointment as BCV president.
