  [Text] Caracas, 28 May (EFE) -- Today, the Venezuelan 
Government announced a series of changes in President Rafael 
Caldera's cabinet. These changes are designed to improve 
coherence in the government team. According to Guillermo 
Alvarez, chief of the Central Information Office, the new 
development minister will be Alberto Poletto, president of the 
Foreign Trade Institute [ICE]. Poletto will continue to be 
president of the ICE, and in the future, this office will become 
the ministry of industry and commerce. 
  Luis Carlos Palacios, the current development minister, will 
head the Central Office of Coordination and Planning. Palacios 
will replace Enzo del Bufalo who, according to the press, 
resigned because of serious differences with the other members 
of the economic cabinet. 
  Ciro Zaa, currently minister of urban development, has been 
appointed transport and communications minister. Zaa replaces 
Cesar Quintini who was accused of not being willing to attack 
the corruption spotted in the department by former Deputy 
Transport and Communications Minister Rafael Iribarren. 
  Francisco Gonzalez, currently president of the Urban 
Development Fund, will replace Ciro Zaa as the new minister of 
urban development. The Urban Development Fund will shortly come 
under the Urban Development Ministry. 
  One of the changes that surprised all the local political 
observers took place in the Venezuelan Investment Fund, 
responsible for the privatization process. Abdon Vivas Teran, 
head of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, has been replaced by 
Carlos Bernardez, a former president of the Bank of Venezuela, 
the oldest private bank in Venezuela. 
  The chief of the Central Information Office also announced 
that Alfredo Gruber will be the new president of the Venezuelan 
Guayana Corporation, the most powerful state-run business group. 
Gruber will replace Francisco Layrisse who, a few days ago, 
announced that he wishes to return to private practice. 
  The latest addition to the cabinet, announced today, has 
been 
the appointment of Pompeyo Marquez, currently a minister without 
portfolio, as coordinator for the government's social programs. 
The new members of the cabinet will be sworn in on Monday [30 
May] and will start to work immediately, Alvarez said.
