  [Text] Caracas, 27 Apr (AFP) -- In a communique issued 
today in Caracas by the Foreign Ministry, the Venezuelan 
Government condemns for the Haitian Armed Forces for "the 
massacre of 23 Haitians" in that country on Saturday. In the 
communique, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry "deplores the 
worsening of the Haitian crisis and deeply regrets this wave of 
violence, intimidation, torture, disappearances, assassinations, 
and illegal imprisonment of people linked to democratic 
political and labor movements." After indicating the death of 
the 23 Haitians "should be added to the list of other equally 
condemnable events in recent months," the Venezuelan Foreign 
Ministry states that there is "a systematic campaign by the 
Haitian military sector to exterminate the Haitian Democratic 
Movement and prevent a return to peace and institutional 
normality." 
  The Venezuelan Government calls on Latin American and 
Caribbean countries "to join efforts to end the situation of 
violence and terror." It reiterates its support for OAS and UN 
efforts to restore institutional norms to Haiti. 
  In conjunction with the United States, Canada, and France, 
Venezuela forms part of the so-called "Friends of Haiti Group," 
which has tried to mediate the return of ousted President Jean- 
Bertrand Aristide. Aristide took asylum in Venezuela for some 
months after the military coup against him in September 1991.
