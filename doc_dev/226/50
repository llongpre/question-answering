  [Text] Santo Domingo, 12 May (EFE) -- The illegal 
appointment of Emile Jonassaint as Haitian president places the 
Dominican Government in a new, truly uncomfortable position -- a 
vantage point from which it has decided not to meddle in the 
internal affairs of its neighboring country. 
  Today, the Dominican Government distanced itself from 
international criticism of the Haitian coupists for appointing 
Jonassaint as the new Haitian president. The government declared 
this was "an internal matter" and a new twist in a crisis the 
Haitian people must resolve themselves. 
  In statements to EFE, Dominican Foreign Minister Aristides 
Taveras Guzman today said: "We understand the appointment... is 
a move by the Haitian politicians, and, as a country that abides 
by its government's policy, we respect the sovereignty and 
integrity of the people." 
  With the backing of the military that seized power in a 
September 1991 coup, Supreme Court Magistrate Emile Jonassaint 
assumed the presidency of Haiti on Wednesday, drawing criticism 
from the international community and causing fears of armed 
intervention from abroad. 
  Aristides Guzman said: "Although we have endorsed OAS and UN 
efforts to achieve the democratic transition of the (Haitian) 
people, we have always stressed, in one way or another, that the 
Haitians should be the sole protagonists in resolving their 
problems." 
  This position by the Dominican Government, according to what 
Foreign Ministry officials admitted privately, reflects their 
impotence in face of a Haitian crisis that has no good or 
acceptable resolutions from a Dominican standpoint. 
  The Dominican Republic is fated not to agree with but to 
comply with UN and OAS sanctions against the Haitian military -- 
sanctions designed to return deposed President Jean Bertrand 
Aristide to power. The Dominican Republic is hoping the crisis 
will calmly die on its own, preferably by the end of the 
constitutional term of the Haitian government-in-exile, which is 
in February 1995. 
  All current developments in the Haitian crisis are 
threatening the Dominican Republic. 
  Aristide was criticized because of his anti-Dominican 
remarks 
during the seven months he was in power. The military 
government cannot be accepted, however, because of international 
opposition, and the same is true for the illegal appointment of 
Emile Jonaissant. 
  The economic embargo imposed by the United Nations and the 
OAS has not resolved the problem and has discredited the 
Dominican Armed Forces, which have been unable to prevent 
smuggling across the border. The new embargo, which will be 
implemented on 21 May, puts more responsibility on Dominican 
surveillance and will require additional spending. The number 
of Haitian exiles and refugees are increasing in the Dominican 
Republic, while the Dominican Government is resisting pressure 
to install refugee camps near the border. The Dominican 
Republic also has been obliged to accept international 
observers, who will arrive this week to oversee the fulfillment 
of the embargo. 
  All of these problems were outlined to EFE today by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral, who confirmed the 
acceptance of international observers, but he reiterated that 
"the embargo violates the Haitian people's human rights. He 
also said the embargo harms the Dominican Republic in view of 
international accusations of "alleged violations" and by the 
flow of Haitians. 
  Herrera Cabral said the Dominican Government dedicates 
virtually 25 million pesos ($2 million) a month to maintaining 
border security. 
  All of these inconveniences have been heightened in the past 
months by the campaign for the upcoming general elections, which 
will be held this coming Monday in the Dominican Republic. 
  U.S. diplomatic sources, who chose to remain anonymous, 
confirmed to EFE that the Dominican Government "suggested" to 
the United States that it refrain from making "any move" on 
Haiti before the Dominican elections.
