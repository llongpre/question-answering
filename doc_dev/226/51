  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 13 Jun (EFE) -- The 
presidents of Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela here on Monday 
signed the free trade agreement of the Group of Three (G-3), 
which calls for a gradual elimination of tariffs among these 
nations within 10 years. 
  The agreement was signed by Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas, 
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, and Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria. They will participate, beginning on Tuesday, in 
the Fourth Ibero-American summit of chiefs of state and 
government in this city in northwestern Colombia. 
  The treaty, which was signed at the Presidential Home for 
Illustrious Guests, will benefit 150 million inhabitants of 
these three countries, and in initial stages, will generate 
business amounting to $600 million per year. Its signing was 
achieved after more than three years of efforts that nearly 
failed in May. 
  The G-3 agreement will go into effect in early 1995, and for 
Colombia and Venezuela it offers an opportunity to request 
membership in NAFTA, of which Mexico is a signatory as well as 
the United States and Canada.
