  [Text] Medellin (Colombia), 21 Feb (EFE) -- Today, the 
Medellin Bolivarian Militia (urban guerrilla groups) claimed 
responsibility for the dynamite attacks perpetrated early Sunday 
against the Venezuelan consulate and four political party 
offices in Medellin, capital of Antioquia Department in the 
country's northwest. 
  According to police, the clandestine groups of Medellin's 
outskirts, linked to the National Guerrilla Coordinating Board 
[CNG], claimed responsibility for the attacks because they 
regard the peace negotiations between the government and a 
similar group, the People's Militia, as "treason." 
  Carlos Gottberg Riveros, Venezuelan consul to Medellin, said 
that although he does not know the reason for the attack, "it 
could have something to do with the subversives' interest in 
creating confusion in the city. My first impression is one of 
surprise because we live in a friendly country. Many Colombians 
live peacefully in Venezuela and many Venezuelans live in 
Colombia in stability and respect." 
  The bomb attacks only caused damage, estimated at some 
$30,000. The worst damage was sustained by the Venezuelan 
consulate, located in the Manrique-Rosales neighborhood, in the 
western part of Medellin. 
  The Bolivarian Militia of Medellin believe the negotiations 
between the Colombian Government and the People's Militia "are 
an unconditional surrender." 
  The attacks perpetrated in Medellin are part of a wave of 
CNG 
attacks throughout the country, including the kidnapping of two 
parliamentarians and one mayor as well as clashes with policemen 
and soldiers in the outskirts of Santa Fe de Bogota.
