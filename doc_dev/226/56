  [Text] Caracas, 23 Mar (DPA) -- The Venezuelan Foreign 
Ministry confirmed to DPA today that Venezuelan Foreign Minister 
Miguel Burelli Rivas is withdrawing his candidacy for secretary 
general of the OAS. Burelli Rivas will make his withdrawal 
official at Miraflores Palace (government headquarters) this 
afternoon, even though last week he insisted to foreign 
journalists that he would continue his candidacy until election 
day, this Sunday in Washington. 
  According to media reports, the Venezuelan foreign minister 
had only received the support of the Haitian Government in 
exile. With his withdrawal, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd 
Niehaus and Colombian President Cesar Gaviria remain in the 
competition for the hemispheric post.
