  [Text] Unofficial sources have informed EL DIARIO DE 
CARACAS that Venezuela is willing to accept a small number of 
Haitians who meet political refugee requirements for a short 
period of time until the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) finds another country in which they can reside 
permanently. 
  The Haitian issue will be included on the agenda for talks 
that will be held in Caracas with U.S. Under Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott. The sources also stressed that the United States 
has tried on several occasions to convince the Venezuelan 
Government to accept Haitian refugees. The UNHCR also has been 
negotiating directly with Venezuela on the issue, and Venezuela 
has replied that it is willing to grant temporary asylum because 
of the unique situation Haiti is now experiencing. 
  Talbott will arrive in Venezuela on the evening of 2 June 
with a delegation that will include Alexander Watson, assistant 
U.S. secretary of state for inter-American affairs. Meanwhile, 
U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela Jeffrey Davidow said: "Venezuela is 
the only Latin American country that is member of the Friends of 
Haiti group. Venezuela has always played an important role in 
the fight to return democracy to the island." 
  The agenda of the Americas Summit, which will be held in 
Miami later this year, is another important issue that will be 
discussed. Unofficial sources noted that the Unites States is 
interested in proposing a "good government" policy; in other 
words, it wants to propose a fight against corruption.
