  [Text] Brasilia, 20 Mar (EFE) -- The foreign ministers and 
government delegates of the 13 Rio Group countries on 21 March 
will open in Brasilia a 48-hour meeting that will serve to sound 
out their preferences in the election of the next OAS secretary 
general. 
  The meeting will be held on the eve of the 27 March vote in 
Washington, at which the continent's 35 foreign ministers will 
choose the replacement for Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena Soares 
as OAS secretary general. 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli -- who is 
one of the three candidates for the post -- will attend the 
three work sessions of the ministerial meeting, which will be 
held on 21 and 22 March at Itamaraty, the Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry headquarters. 
  The other candidates are Colombian President Cesar Gaviria 
and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Berns Niehaus. 
  Even though it is not on the meeting's agenda, the OAS 
secretary general's election will be discussed in the corridors 
and even during formal sessions, which are flexible and during 
which any delegate can raise an issue, diplomatic sources told 
EFE. 
  Brazil, the country that hosts the meeting in its capacity 
as 
holder of the annually rotating secretariat of the most 
important Latin American political forum, supports Gaviria and 
is confident he will win, a high-ranking Itamaraty official told 
EFE. 
  Gaviria should win, despite the fact that "the situation has 
not yet reached a definitive status," he said. 
  The majority of Rio Group countries that referred to the 
matter -- Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Mexico 
-- support Gaviria. 
  The Costa Rican candidate has assured that he has the 
support 
of the Caribbean and Central American bloc, while the Venezuelan 
candidate has called on his two opponents to hold a television 
debate to be aired to the entire continent for the purpose of 
outlining their positions toward the OAS. 
  The winner of the 27 March vote will be installed during the 
OAS general assembly to be held from 5-10 June in the Amazon 
city of Belem do Para (northern Brazil), the hometown of Baena 
Soares, a former Brazilian deputy foreign minister who has held 
the OAS secretariat for two consecutive five-year periods since 
1984. 
  The Rio Group ministers and government delegates will 
address 
various international issues dealing with commerce, disarmament, 
UN bylaws' reform, the environment, the antinarcotics fight, 
democracy, human rights, and initiatives to end the military 
regime in Haiti. 
  They also will exchange views and seek a consensus on the 
position of Latin American governments on a continental summit 
called by U.S. President Bill Clinton for December in Miami. 
  The ministerial meeting will coincide with the official 
visit 
of 5.5 hours that U.S. Vice President Alberto Gore will pay to 
Brasilia on 21 March with the objective of promoting the 
continental summit with Brazilian President Itamar Franco. 
  Gore today began in La Paz a short tour of Latin America 
that 
will include stopovers in Buenos Aires and Brasilia. 
  Meanwhile, Trinidad and Tobago Foreign Minister Ralph Maraja 
and Jorge Gordillo, one of Peru's deputy foreign ministers, 
already have arrived in Brasilia to attend the Rio Group meeting. 
  Foreign Ministers Celso Amorim (Brazil), Antonio Aranibar 
(Bolivia), Miguel Angel Burelli (Venezuela), Luis Ramirez 
Boettner (Paraguay), Manuel Tello (Mexico), Gladys de Vielman 
(Guatemala), Carlos Figueroa (Chile), and Sergio Abreu (Uruguay) 
have confirmed that they will attend. 
  Other delegations scheduled to arrive today or on 21 March 
will be headed by Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando 
Petrella and Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Andelfo Garcia, 
while Ecuador will be represented by its ambassador in Brasilia, 
Cesar Valdivieso.
