  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- 
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera said today at the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit that Cuba should return to the Latin 
American family of nations but it also must change its political 
system. 
  "I believe the time has come for Cuba to fully join the 
community and the judicial and social systems of the continent," 
Caldera said in his speech during the summit's opening session. 
  Immediately thereafter, the Venezuelan president said: "with 
my greatest respect, the time has also come for Cuba to change 
its own system, for which the world situation is favorably 
disposed."
