  [Text] Caracas, 24 Apr (EFE)--Nine Venezuelan Air Forces 
officers who participated in the attempted coup on 27 November 
1992 were released Saturday and will return to their duties. 
Charges against the nine officers, who took asylum in Peru after 
the second military coup attempt, were dismissed by a decree 
issued by President Rafael Caldera. 
  The officers are Captains Senibaldo Palacios, Wilfredo 
Santiago Sanchez Trujillo, Wilson Marin Leal, Luis Antonio 
Romero, Daniel Pereira, Jean Luis Duran Siso, and Sanchez 
Trujillo. Charges were also dismissed against Lieutenants Fidias 
Garrido and Alexis Montilla. 
  Only three of the officers who returned to Venezuela to 
surrender to justice continue to be detained at the San Carlos 
prison in northern Caracas. There are still 13 coupist officers 
in Peru, including General Visconti Osorio, one of the leaders 
of the 27 November 1992 military insurrection. 
  In Venezuela, 21 soldiers are still being held for 
rebellion. 
The soldiers are headed by Admiral Luis Cabrera Aguirre, who is 
held at the San Carlos prison together with 13 officers and a 
soldier. 
  Virginia Contreras, the defense lawyer of the coupist 
soldiers, said to reporters that the cases against the officers 
who are still under arrest should also be dismissed and that 
they should be allowed to return to the National Armed Forces.
