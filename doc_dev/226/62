  [Text] Caracas, 3 Feb (EFE) -- A day after his inauguration 
and following a military parade in his honor, Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera today was involved in a minor traffic 
accident as his vehicle was leaving the Plaza de los Proceres in 
Caracas. 
  According to eyewitnesses, a television cameraman, while 
filming Caldera's departure, approached a horse of the Honor 
Guard escorting the presidential car, spooking the animal and 
prompting it to rear. 
  According to sources close to the president, the president's 
chauffeur was forced to brake abruptly to avoid hitting the 
horse. In the mishap, Caldera received a blow so sharp that it 
broke his pen into three pieces. 
  The president, who complained about pain in his ribs, will 
be 
examined by doctors at the Miraflores Palace, seat of the 
Venezuelan Government.
