  [Text] Caracas, 28 May (EFE) -- The Venezuelan Government 
has put an end to the uncertainty surrounding the future of 
state-owned power companies by announcing today that, starting 
in September, these companies will be privatized. 
  Eduardo Calero, manager of the electrical sector of the 
Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV), said that initially the 
Central Plant and Enelven-Enelco [expansion unknown] companies 
will be auctioned, and in early 1995 the process will continue 
with the privatization of two other regional companies. 
  The transfer of the power companies to the private sector 
has 
been planned for over four years, but during that period various 
factors emerged--most of them political--which prevented the 
process from materializing. 
  According to Calero, the government no longer considers 
privatization as a means of reducing the size of government but 
as "an immediate financial necessity," prompted by the acute 
economic crisis the country is experiencing, which has become 
worse because of the accelerated devaluation of the national 
currency. 
  The FIV official also announced that within the short term 
power rates will be revised because companies in the region have 
been seriously affected by the devaluation of the Venezuelan 
bolivar with regard to the U.S. dollar. 
  Products, imported raw materials, and the payment of debts 
abroad now pose a considerable problem for the power companies, 
which must pay their commitments in dollars, while their rates 
are fixed in a currency that has been devaluated by 30 percent 
over the past two months, Calero said. 
  In any event, he explained, the cost of the devaluation will 
not be directly transferred to the rates; instead, he said, "the 
increase in rates will depend on the extent to which each power 
company is willing to assume part of the expense caused by the 
weakening of Venezuela's currency."
