  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 28 Feb (EFE) -- The Justice and 
Peace Commission of Haiti, assigned to the Catholic Church in 
Gonaives Municipality, accused the Dominican Republic of 
violating the oil embargo decreed by the UN Security Council. In 
a report published in the Haitian capital today, the commission 
assigned to the diocese of Gonaives said Dominican and Haitian 
soldiers cooperate in transporting gasoline across the border 
that divides both countries. 
  On 24 February, an investigative committee of the Justice 
and 
Peace Commission saw movement of fuel contraband at the 
northeast border, at the Haitian city of Quanaminthe, near the 
Dominican city of Dajabon. A large number of uniformed Dominican 
soldiers were seen participating in the operation, the religious 
organization reported. 
  The commission said the soldiers, in front of the civilians, 
direct the transfer of an impressive motorcade of freight and 
personnel, who transport the fuel down the local river. 
According to the organization, nearly 250 carts, each one 
carrying three barrels of gasoline, are transported each day in 
15 trips across the border. 
  The organization added that the Haitian military takes 
charge 
of the fuel once it enters Haitian territory. The Justice and 
Peace Commission said an area has been set up near the border to 
store the fuel. 
  The commission regrets that the UN Security Council has not 
denounced this situation. "The United Nations has not adopted 
any measures to supervise and enforce the oil embargo at the 
Dominican-Haitian border, which, as a consequence, is prolonging 
the crisis and at the same time strengthening the coupists' 
economic and political power," the commission said. The United 
Nations, after the 1993 efforts to restore Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide to power as the constitutional president of Haiti 
failed, decreed an oil embargo against Haiti. 
  Meanwhile, today, the U.S. Coast Guard repatriated 141 
Haitian refugees, who tried to abandon the country in a boat, 
which was located near the Windward Passage between Cuba and 
Haiti. Since 1 January, U.S. Coast Guard ships have repatriated 
302 Haitian refugees.
