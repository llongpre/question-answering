<F P=106> [Report by Enelcys Calderon] </F>
  [Text] Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli 
Rivas has said that relations between Venezuela and Colombia 
remain excellent after the Venezuelan candidate for OAS 
secretary general withdrew from the race. These relations were 
never affected by the campaign for the post of OAS secretary 
general, he added. "Relations are excellent and will remain so" 
despite the struggle for the post, he said. 
  A number of vehicles stolen in Venezuela, taken to Colombia, 
and returned by Colombian authorities in a joint effort by the 
Colombian-Venezuelan border commissions, will arrive in the 
country next week, the minister said, although the information 
had already been published. 
  Venezuela succeeded in having the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency sign an agreement to lift the ban on 
reformulated Venezuelan gasoline, Burelli Rivas said. He also 
said that PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.], the Foreign Trade 
Institute, the Energy and Mines Ministry, and the Foreign 
Ministry also succeeded in having the EU accept orimulsion 
[water-emulsified fuel] in their markets. 
  The delegation that will represent Venezuela during next 
Sunday's OAS session is made up of the deputy foreign minister 
and the ambassador to the organization, Guido Grooscos. The 
latter will vote on behalf of the country during the election 
for secretary general. Demetrio Boesner was designated acting 
director general of the Foreign Ministry. 
  Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva will visit 
Venezuela in the second half of June to improve bilateral ties 
and discuss ways to improve trade between the two countries. 
  The president of the prime minister's cabinet is scheduled 
to 
arrive in Caracas in the middle of May to agree on the items 
that Cavaco Silva will discuss during his stay. The information 
was confirmed by the Portuguese ambassador during a visit to the 
foreign minister's office.
