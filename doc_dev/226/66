  [Text] Caracas, 30 May (EFE) -- Today, Venezuelan President 
Rafael Caldera carried out his first cabinet change, only 117 
days after the start of his government and in the mist of a 
profound economic crisis. 
  Caldera, who assumed the presidency on 2 February, appointed 
Alberto Poletto, Luis Carlos Palacios, Ciro Zaa, and Carlos 
Bernandez as ministers of Development, Central Office of 
Coordination and Planning [Cordiplan], Transport and 
Communication, and Venezuelan Investment Fund, respectively. 
  Caldera's restructuring of his cabinet has been interpreted 
by local political experts as a sign that the president is 
prepared to make a switch to an economic policy less populist 
than the one he proposed during the elections campaign and 
closer to the neoliberal policy implemented by former president 
Carlos Andres Perez. 
  Apparently, Caldera, who was one of the most severe critics 
of the free market policy promoted by Perez, has been unable to 
structure an economic formula out of the neoliberal guidelines. 
  Venezuela is living through a difficult economic situation, 
with a fiscal deficit estimated at more than $4.5 billion, a 
severe depreciation of the bolivar, and an explosive social 
situation fueled by a significant fall in the purchasing power 
of the people. 
  President Caldera put Carlos Bernandez at the head of the 
organization in charge of privatizing state enterprises. 
Bernandez has always been linked to the local banking sector and 
he has been president of the Bank of Venezuela, which is one of 
the most important banks in the country. Bernandez has offered 
to increase the privatization process. The local media has 
described his appointment as a victory for the financial sector, 
which was able to produce the departure of Abdon Vivas Teran, a 
politician very close to Caldera and to his electoral offer for 
an economy with a human face, from the Venezuela Investment Fund. 
  Luis Carlos Palacios, the new Cordiplan minister, replaces 
Enzo del Bufalo, a dissonant voice in Caldera's economic team. 
The new minister is closer to the free economy concepts that the 
Caldera administration apparently wants to adopt in this new 
phase. 
  Also, Alberto Poletto, president of the Foreign Trade 
Institute, will be development minister, which joins these 
departments to create the Industry and Commerce Ministry. 
  Ciro Zaa has been virtually forced to leave the Urban 
Development Ministry to take over the Transport and 
Communication Ministry vacated by Cesar Quintini, who was 
accused of maintaining an attitude of tolerance in multiple 
cases of corruption in his ministry. 
  Zaa will be replaced by Francisco Gonzalez, former president 
of the Urban Development fund. The responsibilities of Special 
Affairs Minister Pompeyo Marquez have been expanded and from now 
on he will also be responsible for the government's social 
programs.
