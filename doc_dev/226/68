  [Text] Brasilia, 22 Mar (EFE) -- The foreign ministers and 
representatives of the 13 member countries that make up the Rio 
Group today concluded a 48-hour meeting in which they evaluated, 
among other matters, the continental summit that has been 
convoked by the United States and which will be held in Miami in 
December. 
  The meeting of the representatives of Latin American 
diplomacy coincided with the fleeting 7-hour visit by U.S. 
President Albert Gore to Brasilia to invite Brazilian President 
Itamar Franco to the Miami meeting. 
  Gore took advantage of his meeting with Franco and Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim to greet the foreign ministers and 
representatives of the 13 countries, which agreed to harmonize 
their position regarding the U.S. initiative. 
  The Rio Group foreign ministers will discuss on 24 April in 
Sao Paulo, the seat of the Latin American Parliament 
(Parlatino), all matters they want discussed at the Miami 
summit, including what some diplomats have termed "the Latin 
American perception" of the meeting. 
  An agenda was approved that will be proposed to the foreign 
ministers of the European Union for the 6-monthly joint meeting 
to be held between 20 and 23 April at the seat of the Parlatino. 
  The member countries of the Rio group are: Mexico, Colombia, 
Panama, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, 
Uruguay, Chile, Guatemala, and Trinidad and Tobago.
