<F P=106> [Report by Vera Lima from Manaus, Amazonas State] </F>
  [Text] The Amazonia Military Command [CMA] is monitoring a 
Venezuelan operation against gold prospectors at the 
Venezuelan-Brazilian border. The operation seeks to destroy 
clandestine airfields. 
  In an official communique, the CMA reports that it was 
informed in advance of the operation by the Venezuelan Army. 
The communique notes that the Venezuelan Air Force is trying to 
destroy clandestine airfields in the Alto Quieto and Alto Ocamo 
townships, adjacent to the Brazilian border. 
  The communique adds that this operation has been planned 
since late March. At that time, 36 gold prospectors who had 
been illegally prospecting in Venezuelan territory were turned 
over to Brazilian authorities. 
  The CMA states that there are no reports of damage in 
Brazilian territory as a result of an air strike that took place 
in Venezuelan territory on 8 April. The CMA believes the 
Venezuelan authorities are just exercising their legitimate 
sovereign rights.
