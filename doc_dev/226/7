  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar (EFE) -- Venezuelan Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Burelli told EFE today in Brasilia that 
the eradication of poverty must be "the number one issue" at the 
continental summit called by U.S. President Bill Clinton for 
December in Miami (United States). 
  The Venezuelan minister said he believes Clinton's 
initiative 
is of "supreme interest" as a way to develop new relations 
between the United States and Latin America following the end of 
the Cold War. 
  Burelli said: "We hope the schedule" for the Miami summit 
"will be established soon." Burelli will participate in a 
48-hour meeting of foreign ministers and governmental 
representatives from 13 Rio Group countries that begins today at 
Itamaraty, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry headquarters. 
  This summit will allow an exchange of opinions toward 
consensus among Latin American governments before the summit 
called by President Clinton, and to review the international 
situation. 
  The ministers will establish the bases for two upcoming Rio 
Group summits: the talks that are held twice a year with the EC 
foreign ministers -- scheduled for 20-23 April in Sao Paulo -- 
and the Eighth Annual Rio Group summit scheduled for 8-9 
September in Rio de Janeiro. 
  Even though it is not on the agenda, the delegates will use 
the meeting to probe preferences for the election of a new OAS 
secretary general on 27 March in Washington. 
  Diplomatic sources have stated that this issue will crop up 
in lobby talks and even in the Rio Group's three flexible 
sessions as any delegation head is allowed to raise it. 
  Foreign Minister Burelli is one of the candidates for the 
OAS 
General Secretariat, replacing Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena 
Soares, whose five-year term ends in June. 
  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus are also running. 
  Foreign Minister Burelli indicated that the Rio Group must 
forge "a social bias" for Latin American policy because "the 
people eagerly want consideration in the decision-making 
process." 
  Burelli said: "Poverty represents a new scourge within 
society as it has new elements of insecurity that cannot be 
fought with armies. It is tied to hunger, terrorism, drug 
trafficking, violence, and growing destitution." 
  Burelli said that internal and external migration in Latin 
American countries has helped to form "pockets" of misery in 
large cities. He mentioned the migration from rural areas and 
the arrival of about 60,000 Guyanese citizens in Venezuela. 
They become involved in the underground economy. 
  The people responsible for regional diplomacy will assess a 
preliminary document entitled: "Poverty, Destitution, and 
Unemployment." This document was compiled at the Rio Group's 
request by experts from various governments, the Economic 
Commission for Latin America (ECLA), and the United Nations. 
  The document proposes guidelines to cure the phenomena and 
will become a Rio Group's contribution for the UN Conference on 
Social Development scheduled for 1995 in the city of Copenhagen.
