  [Text] Belem do Para (Brazil), 6 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Juan 
Aristides Tavares, Dominican foreign relations secretary of 
state, said the Government of the Dominican Republic guarantees 
it will maintain its border with Haiti, which was closed in 
compliance with the total embargo imposed by the United Nations 
on this Caribbean nation. 
  Tavares indicated to EFE that there is a disposition within 
the 24th OAS General Assembly, which was inaugurated today in 
the Brazilian city of Belem do Para, to ensure the total 
effectiveness of the embargo imposed on Haiti in May by the UN 
Security Council. 
  Tavares pointed out that the Dominican Republic is the 
nation 
most harmed by the Haitian political crisis because both nations 
share the island of Hispaniola and also because of the pressures 
it has been exposed to in order to implement the embargo. 
  "No country has had as many problems as we have had. So much 
has been demanded of us; it is as if we were the only ones" 
responsible for contributing to the crisis, the foreign 
relations secretary of state indicated. He added that his 
government has supported all resolutions related to issues 
approved by the OAS and the UN Security Council. 
  "Although the embargo has not been completely effective, we 
have not violated it intentionally, and, moreover, at this time, 
our government has ordered the closing of the border," the 
Dominican Republic foreign secretary said. 
  The Haitian political crisis is the main issue dominating 
the 
24th OAS General Assembly sessions which will be extended until 
next Friday and where 70 proposals related to democracy, human 
rights, security, technical cooperation, environment, 
counternarcotics, and the economic situation throughout the 
American continent will be discussed. 
  Full compliance with the total embargo, especially the 
guarantee that the Dominican Republic will not violate the 
350-km-wide border with Haiti, and the rejection of armed 
intervention to depose the military coupists are the two main 
proposals to be discussed during the Belem do Para meeting. 
  Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, deposed by the 
military in September 1991 and still considered the legitimate 
president of Haiti by the international community, participated 
today in the Assembly inauguration. Aristide has met with 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco. 
  Secretary of State Tavares pointed out that the OAS and UN 
technical observers, who recently visited his country, were able 
to ascertain that the total embargo is being implemented "firmly 
along the Dominican-Haitian border."
