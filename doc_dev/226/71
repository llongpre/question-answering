  [Excerpt] Belem do Para (Brazil), 7 Jun (EFE) -- Dominican 
Republic Foreign Minister [title as received] Juan Aristides 
Tavares said today that his country should not be blamed for the 
failure of the blockade imposed on Haiti by the international 
community. 
  In a speech to foreign ministers of OAS member countries, 
whose 24th General Assembly is taking place in the Amazonian 
city of Belem Do Para in northern Brazil, Tavares said that many 
countries are wrong to blame his country for the failure of the 
sanctions imposed on the Haitian military regime. 
  Although he admitted that the Dominican Republic believes 
the 
embargo imposed by the OAS and the United Nations is an "unjust 
and inhuman" sanction, the Dominican foreign minister said his 
government strives to comply with international agreements. 
  OAS and UN observers sent to Haiti argue that the border 
between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which share the Island 
of Hispaniola, is the most vulnerable point of the economic 
blockade imposed by the international community to force General 
Raoul Cedras to relinquish power and allow President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return to that country. 
  "We defend the embargo despite considering it unjust and 
inhuman," Tavares said as he reaffirmed that the government in 
Santo Domingo has made several efforts to close its border with 
Haiti. The Dominican foreign minister added that the political 
party of President Joaquin Balaguer, who is seeking reelection, 
lost the elections in all border provinces because the 
deployment of more than 12,000 soldiers to the region "has made 
life impossible for the area's inhabitants," he added. Tavares 
said surveillance operations along the more than 300-km-long 
border of abysses and mountains has consumed a large amount of 
resources that should have been targeted to social investments. 
  "Ever since it was promulgated, the embargo has been 
ineffective and has been constantly violated by countries that 
continue to do business with Haiti; it is unfair to blame the 
Dominican Republic for the failure of sanctions against Haitian 
soldiers," Tavares said. "It has been suggested that the 
failure was caused by my country's attitude toward the 
sanctions, and that is not so. If the embargo failed it is 
because of the attitude of those countries that continue to do 
business with Haiti," the Dominican foreign minister added.
