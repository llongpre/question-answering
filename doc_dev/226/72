  [Text] Santo Domingo, 14 Jun (EFE) -- The total embargo 
along the Dominican border with Haiti will be impossible to 
maintain for much longer, said Dominican Foreign Minister Juan 
Aristides Taveras Guzman. He has added that neither the OAS nor 
the United Nations have made any move to send resources to 
change that. 
  Taveras has affirmed that the possibility of these 
international organizations helping the Dominican Republic to 
defray the cost of keeping 15,000 troops deployed along the 
Haitian border has not been discussed. 
  Dominican authorities hope the Haitian situation will be 
resolved soon because it is almost impossible for the country to 
withstand the cost of the military deployment for much longer. 
The troops have been in the area since 26 May. 
  The foreign minister added that his government has requested 
technical assistance to help supervise what he called the "good 
job" his country is doing to prevent violations of the trade 
embargo, which the international community has imposed on Haiti. 
  He cited the recent OAS General Assembly, saying: "We are 
the 
last ones to want an embargo violation, and we have supported 
all of the resolutions issued to that effect. Furthermore, we 
just made a firm and definitive statement at the recent foreign 
ministers meeting in Brazil asking for everyone to stop 
scrutinizing and criticizing us." 
  Directly addressing the Haitian problem, he said the 
situation has affected the Dominican Republic more that any 
other member of the international community. The Dominicans 
have had to pay a high price for the Haitian problem and, 
therefore, believe the criticism against them should cease. 
  Taveras said his country is still waiting for the list of 
products that will be allowed to cross the Haitian border. 
Dante Caputo, OAS and UN representative, has promised to 
provide the list of items on humanitarian aid. 
  The foreign minister has discarded the possibility of 
military intervention in Haiti "for the time being." Such an 
operation would seek to dislodge the military leaders there and 
restore constitutional President Jean Bertrand Aristide to power. 
  Taveras said the international organizations are determined 
to use every possible peaceful, diplomatic, and political means 
to resolve the Haitian crisis. He affirmed that if such a 
military operation were to occur, it would be a multilateral 
effort. 
  The United Nations, the OAS, and several countries have 
criticized the violations that have occurred before 26 May along 
the Haitian border. The embargo became totally effective 24 
hours after a meeting between Dominican President Joaquin 
Balaguer and U.S. and OAS representatives.
