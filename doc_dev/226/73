  [Text] Caracas, 1 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Today, President Rafael 
Caldera denied Venezuela supports the candidacy of Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo for OAS secretary general. 
According to sources at the government palace, Gaviria asked 
Caldera to support his candidacy, but the Venezuelan president 
said the country has its own candidate, whose qualities measure 
up to the needs of the hemisphere. 
  For several months, Venezuela has promoted the candidacy of 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas to this post. A 
Foreign Ministry spokesman affirmed Burelli will not only 
maintain his candidacy, but will also "fight for it until the 
second or third round" of votes at OAS headquarters in 
Washington. 
  The Venezuelan delegation to the OAS sent a statement to the 
evaluation committee noting Burelli Rivas as the "sole option to 
renewing the system." The communique added that with Venezuela, 
the inter-American system would have an OAS which is much more 
active and committed to the objectives and principles of its 
charter. 
  Political analysts feel the Venezuelan foreign minister 
would 
withdraw his candidacy to avoid a resounding defeat by Gaviria 
or Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, who seems to have 
received the support of Central America and the Caribbean.
