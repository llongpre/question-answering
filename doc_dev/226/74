  [Text] Caracas, 12 Mar (EFE) -- Members of an Army 
intelligence unit detected and dismantled a network of concealed 
microphones at Miraflores Palace, seat of the Venezuelan 
Government. The Army is now seeking the "brains" of the 
espionage system, the local press reported today. 
  Unofficial sources at Miraflores Palace remarked that the 
microphones had been placed in the main rooms of the building, 
including the office of President Rafael Caldera and the room 
where the Council of Ministers meets regularly. Although it has 
not yet been confirmed, it is believed that, through this 
high-technology system, those responsible for telephone 
espionage also had access to the main offices of the Ministry of 
Defense. 
  A report published by the daily "EL GLOBO" states the 
system's connections reportedly linked the network to the 
private offices of former President Carlos Andres Perez and the 
main office of Banco Latino, in which the government intervened 
last January and where a sophisticated espionage center was 
discovered. 
  Following the bank intervention, congressional investigators 
asserted that hundreds of telephones of prominent Venezuelan 
political and business personalities were wiretapped from that 
office, but the wires leading to hidden microphones were not 
discovered. 
  However, it has not been ruled out that the investigation 
will follow this course, especially if it is confirmed the 
network discovered at Miraflores leads to terminals located at 
the main office of Banco Latino, whose former President Gustavo 
Gomez Lopez is accused of planning a coup d'etat. 
  The location of Gomez Lopez, for whom an arrest warrant was 
issued over the bankruptcy of Banco Latino, is not known. It is 
only known that he is abroad. However, on several occasions 
Gomez Lopez has contacted local media to reject the accusations. 
  Even so, Venezuelan political leaders view Gomez Lopez as 
the 
main ideologist of a coup d'etat, planned with former Defense 
Minister Radames Munoz. This coup attempt was reportedly aimed 
at preventing the electoral victory of Rafael Caldera last 5 
December. 
  Those who made accusations against Gomez Lopez argue the 
intentions of the banker and Munoz were definitely foiled after 
the military officer disclosed his plans to U.S. Government 
officials, who warned they would not go along with an attempt 
against the Venezuelan democratic regime.
