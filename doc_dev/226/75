  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 28 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican 
Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus considers Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria's hope of getting elected to the OAS general 
secretariat post has failed following the "no" he received in 
Central America. 
  Niehaus, who is also working to replace Brazilian Joao 
Clemente Baena Soares at the head of the OAS, told ACAN-EFE that 
Colombia's intense efforts at the inauguration ceremony of new 
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina were their "last 
attempts" in this direction. Central American support for 
Niehaus was, he asserted, "absolute and total." "I feel that 
this (the efforts made in Honduras) was the decisive point and 
that the Colombian foreign minister (Noemi Sanin) will recommend 
that the president desist from running as an official candidate, 
because he has no possibility of winning the race," Niehaus 
added. 
  Alfredo Cristiani, president of El Salvador, Ramiro de Leon, 
of Guatemala, and the new Honduran chief of state publicly 
expressed support of Niehaus for the OAS post. Nicaraguan 
President Violeta Chamorro, who also attended Reina's 
inauguration, termed "perfect" Gaviria's desire and, showing a 
change of position, did not say who she would support alleging 
that "the vote is secret." 
  Niehaus told ACAN-EFE that Nicaragua has reiterated its 
support and that the Nicaraguan president's expressions appear 
to be "diplomatic words" in view of Gaviria's presence in 
Tegucigalpa. The Colombian chief of state was the only non 
Central American president who attended the Honduran 
inauguration and took advantage of his visit to make a stopover 
in Panama and to visit El Salvador today. Panamanian President 
Guillermo Endara, who did not go to Honduras, reiterated last 
week that Panama will vote for Niehaus. He said so during the 
visit by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin to sound out possible 
support for Gaviria to the OAS post. 
  The Costa Rican foreign minister said that he has 23 votes 
guaranteed for the 27 March election while only 18 are needed to 
win. 
  Former Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli, a 
third candidate to the post, told ACAN-EFE that the figures 
cited by Niehaus "are inflated." 
  For his part, the Costa Rican foreign minister insisted 
today 
he has the support of the six Central American countries, the 13 
countries of the Caribbean, who are committed to him in a letter 
of the regional economic cooperation organization, Caricom 
[Caribbean Common Market], and also the support of the Dominican 
Republic, Chile, Ecuador, and Argentina. Niehaus insisted that 
it is a "just" desire based on the principle of rotation, that 
Central America and the Caribbean occupy, for the first time in 
history, the OAS secretariat. 
  Burelli said that to try to "subregionalize" the 
organization 
and impose a numeric force of small countries on the democratic 
importance and economic support of the large countries could do 
away with the OAS or promote a "small security council" with 
UN-style veto power. 
  Niehaus, however, rejected the power that the large 
countries 
have had in OAS executive posts and recalled that the 
organization is based on the equality of states, regardless of 
their size and population. Although he considered it acceptable 
that Burelli vie for the post since Venezuela has never held it, 
he stated it would be "unacceptable" to give it to Colombia "for 
the third time." 
  Regarding the possibility of Gaviria as a candidate, 
something that has not been made official, he agreed with 
Burelli that there would be an anomaly to elect him secretary in 
March for him to take office in June when he is not scheduled to 
leave his post until August. 
  Niehaus said that he hopes to leave the Foreign Ministry on 
8 
May, when the new Costa Rican Government that is elected 6 
February takes office. "We must give an opportunity to other 
countries and other subregions, and not only South America," 
Niehaus said, expressing his intention not to go up for 
reelection after the first five years in the secretariat in 
order to give a chance to other nations. "After Central 
America, a Caribbean country should be next to occupy the 
secretariat, then a South American one," he said.
