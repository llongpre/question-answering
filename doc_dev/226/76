    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 17 May. 
  Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez has announced that 
Venezuela became a member of the Multilateral Investment 
Guarantees Agency (MIGA) on 6 May by paying the $3,088,038 that 
corresponds to the 20-percent subscription fee. By joining MIGA, 
Venezuela acquires more guarantees in the flow of foreign 
investment. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 10 May 94 p 12) 
  The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) reported on 10 May that 
the 
people have no need to fear an unstable bolivar, because the 
drop in international reserves has been curbed. BCV President 
Antonio Casas said, "There is no reason not to have faith in the 
bolivar and in the country's economic future." The dollar 
experienced a setback on 29 April when the bolivar rose from 
118.30 per dollar to 123.50. On 10 May, the bolivar closed at 
131.50. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0112 GMT 11 May 94) 
  Foreign Trade Institute President Alberto Poletto has 
announced that the abrupt break in trade talks between Colombia, 
Mexico, and Venezuela to form a trade zone under the Group of 
Three "does not mean the end or failure of the negotiations." 
The foreign trade ministers of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela 
will strive in the coming days to overcome the impasse created 
in Bogota when Mexico tried to impose conditions the other two 
countries did not accept. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in 
Spanish 11 May 94 p 20) 
  Finance Ministry sources have reported that imports have 
experienced a 40-percent decline. It is estimated that in 1994 
exports will reach 10.2-10.5 billion dollars, compared to 1993's 
10.9 billion dollar figure. According to the same sources, in 
1993 the country sustained an economic reduction of 1 percent, 
which is expected to reach 1.5 percent in 1994. (Caracas EL 
NACIONAL in Spanish 11 May 94 p E-2) 
  During the first three months of 1994, Venezuela experienced 
a slowdown characterized by spiraling inflation and declines in 
the basic economic indicators. This is reflected in an economic 
report prepared by the Presidency's Office of Coordination and 
Planning. The price of oil, which is a touchstone used to assess 
the country's revenues, was $12.33 per barrel, showing a 
4.8-percent decline when compared to prices recorded in the last 
three months of 1993. (Caracas Union Radion Network in Spanish 
1100 GMT 17 May 94)
