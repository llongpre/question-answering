  [Text] Caracas, 2 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Venezuelan President 
Rafael Caldera will ask his colleagues, who will participate in 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, to seek urgent solutions for 
the demands of millions of poor people in the region, Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Burelli said today. 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister said the Ibero-American 
Summit will be a good opportunity to find solutions "for social 
disorders and urban overcrowding," which have become common and 
serious problems for Latin America and the Caribbean. "Latin 
America and the Caribbean have common problems such as poverty, 
social disorders, and overcrowded cities because of people 
moving in from the countryside and becoming disorderly masses," 
Burelli said. 
  In an interview with NOTIMEX, the foreign minister said 
Venezuela regrets to see that the development of the last few 
decades has not kept man as its center of attention with his 
various needs, such as education, health, food, and housing. 
  He confirmed that President Caldera will participate in the 
summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14 and 15 June, 
which will be attended by 21 heads of state and government, 
including Spain and Portugal, because "Venezuela will fulfill 
its obligation once again." It will be Caldera's first trip 
abroad since he was sworn in on 2 February. 
  According to the Venezuelan foreign minister, Ibero-American 
summits are of great importance far beyond their agenda points, 
because of the opportunities they represent and because they 
provide a greater awareness of reality. "The Ibero-American 
Summit will also be a good opportunity--without ruling out other 
forums such as the OAS--to clearly establish the desire to give 
greater importance to human development," Burelli said. 
  The minister said work is still being done on the summit's 
agenda, but noted that, in addition to the discussion of social 
problems, it is necessary to discuss "the Haitian tragedy, one 
of the most difficult topics because of its lack of solutions." 
  He said it is important to "exchange ideas" about the Summit 
of the Americas convened by U.S. President William Clinton for 
Miami, Florida to which all countries of the hemisphere have 
been invited, except Cuba. According to Burelli, the Miami 
meeting will be an opportunity for Latin America to talk to the 
United States about topics of extreme importance to the region. 
  Venezuela will reiterate at the forum the proposal it made 
during the recent Rio Group Summit in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on the 
urgent need to create an instrument to fight corruption, such as 
drug trafficking, in a drastic and expeditious manner. The 
foreign minister explained that the Venezuelan proposal 
coincides with a law being drafted by the Ecuadoran Government 
to curb influence-peddling and corruption. "We seek to merge 
both initiatives so as to propose an agile and useful instrument 
to stop the wave of corruption in our countries," he said. 
Burelli said we must take advantage of the Ibero-American 
Summit and other forums to insist on this serious problem 
because democracy "must involve proven honesty." 
  As for the topic of continental security, the foreign 
minister pointed out that, in view of the failure of the 
Inter-American Security System, which was dismantled following 
the Islas Malvinas War [Falkland Islands War], a mechanism to 
detect elements of destabilization and insecurity in the region 
is necessary. "There are sufficient reasons to undertake an 
Ibero-American action on the security issue. Some of these 
reasons include drug trafficking, guerrillas, extreme poverty, 
human rights violations, hunger, and injustice," he said. 
  According to Burelli, the agenda for the Ibero-American 
Summit will include topics such as culture, education, and the 
exchange of technology as a mechanism to free ourselves from our 
dependence on huge industrial centers. "We are going to seek 
mechanisms that can allow universities and industries at a 
hemispheric level to make innovations that can contribute to the 
reduction of the high costs of social development," Burelli said. 
  The minister reiterated the importance of the so-called 
Group 
of Three's (Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela) signing an 
agreement to create a free trade zone, which is to take place in 
Cartagena de Indias on 13 June. Burelli said the trade 
agreement, which will open up a market of 245 million potential 
consumers with a gross regional product of $370 billion, will 
greatly contribute to the regional integration process and will 
promote the economic development of the region.
