  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli denied 
reports stating that the Colombian Army of National Liberation 
(ELN) is receiving economic and military support from Venezuelan 
merchants. 
  The rebels are allegedly creating border commandos to 
operate 
along the border separating Venezuela and Colombia. "I have no 
idea what the reports are based on and I am going to ask where 
they are coming from. This is all based on supposition," he 
said. 
  The Colombian daily EL TIEMPO said that certain documents 
seized from the ELN indicate that the rebel group, with the 
support of Venezuelan merchants, is trying to create a permanent 
military force. Their purpose is to intensify their terrorist 
strategy in Colombia against the state and against Japanese, 
European, and U.S. multinational corporations. The documents 
held by the Colombian newspaper, describing the guerrilla 
organization's military plans and the support they receive from 
Venezuelan merchants, reveal the complicity of a large chain of 
Venezuelan stores in the planning and execution of several 
kidnappings near the border for the ELN. Military intelligence 
analysts, quoted by the Colombian daily, indicate that the ELN 
formed logistics commandos, which have been channeling financial 
resources from Venezuela into Colombia since August 1993. The 
operation is coordinated by a committee the rebels call "Border 
Coordinators" [Coordinadores de la Frontera], which are in 
constant contact with the Venezuelan liaisons promoting the 
insurgent movement. [passage omitted]
