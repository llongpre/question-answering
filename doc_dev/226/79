<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano for "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli 
Rivas has confirmed the appointment of Vice Admiral Radames 
Munoz Leon as defense ministry adviser in the United States. 
Burelli Rivas explained the post has no diplomatic status. The 
appointment was requested by the Defense Ministry. 
  [Begin recording] [Burelli] It is not a diplomatic post. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Precisely, but within the Armed 
Forces... 
  [Burelli, interrupting] The Defense Ministry made the 
decision, and the Foreign Ministry is not authorized to discuss 
this. 
  [Reporter] If this is not a diplomatic post, why is he being 
given a diplomatic passport? 
  [Burelli] Well, this status is provided when any function is 
carried out abroad on behalf of the Venezuelan state, to 
facilitate things and provide an advantage during a mission. The 
only assistance provided by the Foreign Ministry is the issuance 
of a special passport, or a diplomatic passport. [end recording] 
  As expected, the foreign minister was asked how statements 
by 
[Lieutenant Colonel Hugo] Chavez, who has said he does not rule 
out the possibility of a military coup, would affect the 
country's image. The minister minimized these statements and 
said the fact that Chavez has joined politics strengthens 
Venezuela's democratic position. 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister declined too much comment on 
criticisms surroundeding the recent election of the OAS 
secretary general. But Burelli Rivas did say he wants to address 
the Congress to explain what happened with regard to Venezuela's 
candidate.
