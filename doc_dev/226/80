  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 26 May (EFE) -- Cuban exports to 
Colombia increased by more than 1,600 percent in the first four 
months of the year, from $1.2 million to $21 million, the 
Colombian Foreign Trade Institute reported today. The institute 
said Cuba was the country with the greatest increase in exports 
to Colombia between January and April, as compared to the same 
period last year. Cuba is followed by the Cayman Islands (800 
percent), Poland (351 percent), and Sweden (210 percent). 
  Colombia and Cuba resumed their trade relations in 1990 and 
their diplomatic ties last October following 12 years of broken 
relations, which began in 1981 when President Julio Cesar Turbay 
accused the Cuban Government of Fidel Castro of supporting 
guerrilla groups. The Cuban Embassy in Colombia told EFE that 
Colombia imports steel, salt for industrial use, generic 
medicines, vaccines, and biotechnological products, from the 
Caribbean island while Colombia sells Cuba textiles, electricity 
cables, machinery, and coke, among other products. Colombia's 
greatest increase in imports, by groups of countries or economic 
blocs, came from the Andean Group countries (Bolivia, Peru, 
Ecuador, and Venezuela) where Colombian purchases increased 
20.82 percent followed by the European Union (EU) with 13.11 
percent. Colombian imports during the first four months of the 
year totalled $1.321 billion and its principal markets are the 
United States and Venezuela, in that order.
