  [Excerpts] Belem, 10 Jun (EFE) -- Cuba's readmission into 
the OAS is no longer viewed as a taboo issue within the 
organization, but its debate will be delayed and may be included 
in the agenda of the OAS general assembly in 1995. 
  The 34 delegates to the 24th OAS General Assembly -- the 
main 
forum of dialogue and agreement within the Americas and which 
will close on 10 June -- have addressed the possibility of 
readmitting Cuba into the OAS with a businesslike approach, 
although without much enthusiasm. 
  The 24th OAS General Assembly, which is hosted by the city 
of 
Belem, Para State, is chaired by Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Celso Amorim. It is in its final stage and is now being 
attended by second level delegates because most of the 
respective foreign ministers have already returned home. 
  Considering Cuba is the only Latin American country excluded 
from the OAS, Amorim viewed as significant the fact that the 
Cuban issue is no longer viewed as taboo and that it may be 
included in the agenda of the OAS. 
  A senior Foreign Ministry official of one Andean country 
rhetorically asked: "Why is it that the Cold War has ended and 
yet Cuba continues to be excluded from the Inter-American 
political system, which is regarded as universal and 
pluralistic"? [passage omitted] 
  OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, whose 10-year 
tenure 
will conclude on 20 June when he will be replaced by Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria, told reporters that a slight majority 
of OAS member states favor a debate on the "Cuban issue." 
  Brazilian President Itamar Franco immediately endorsed the 
initiative. The foreign ministers and delegates of Venezuela, 
Costa Rica, Canada, and Bolivia, among others, followed suit. 
[passage omitted] 
  Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo went as far as 
to announce at a plenary session that he is willing to negotiate 
among the United States, some Latin American countries, the 
Havana Government, and the Cuban opposition in exile, seeking to 
promote the democratization of Cuba. 
  One South American diplomat said the situation is 
complicated 
because of the extreme polarization of positions and of the 
radical stance of the United States, which does not conceal its 
interest in having President Castro step down. 
  Three positions can be identified among Latin American 
countries: First, a pro-U.S. position, which is endorsed by 
Argentina, El Salvador, and other Central American countries; 
second, a current -- which includes the Caribbean Community 
(Caricom) -- that promotes peaceful coexistence with Cuba and 
its readmission into the OAS; and third, a current that respects 
Cuban self-determination, as advocated by the Group of Three 
(Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela). 
  The Brazilian position, which is close to that of the Group 
of Three, watches with satisfaction Cuban economic reform, the 
opening toward the Catholic Church, the renovation of the 
Communist Party of Cuba's cadres that has been implemented in 
recent months by Fidel Castro, and the talks held in April by 
Castro's government with opposition groups in exile. 
  Amorim said that these moves may promote democratization, 
which could be jeopardized if Cuba remains isolated. 
  He added: "Perhaps Cuba should make more significant 
gestures. It is more significant to stretch out one's hand than 
to slam the door in someone's face."
