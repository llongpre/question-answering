  [Text] Santo Domingo, 21 Jun (EFE) -- The military that 
toppled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide must receive 
"some guarantees" for themselves and their relatives within the 
pact to resolve the crisis in Haiti, Dominican Deputy Foreign 
Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral said today. 
  Herrera Cabral said that sending the Haitian military to 
diplomatic posts "so they could be quiet there" could be a 
solution. He said a solution to the Haitian crisis, however, 
"depends on Haitians themselves resolving their problems, on the 
patriotism of Haitians, on the flexibility of Aristide since he 
is part of the crisis." 
  The Dominican official added: "Each one has to do his share, 
yield a little." To achieve a political resolution, one has to 
yield part of his sovereignty, what he believes to be his 
personal interests. Herrera Cabral justified the U.S Government 
position of negotiating the stepping down of the Haitian 
military without need of a military intervention. 
  Regarding the list of food and medicines that Haiti will be 
allowed to import through the border with the Dominican 
Republic, he explained there is no "list" since UN Resolution 
917 allows humanitarian assistance. 
  Yesterday, Monday, Dante Caputo, special UN and OAS envoy 
for 
the Haitian crisis, handed Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer 
a UN Security Council grantee, allowing food and medicine to 
enter Haiti from this country.
