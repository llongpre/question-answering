  [Text] Belem do Para (Brazil), 5 Jun (EFE) -- The foreign 
ministers of the member countries of the Organization of 
American States (OAS) reiterated in their General Assembly the 
need to seek a peaceful solution to the Haitian crisis, in 
contrast to the thesis that supports armed intervention. 
  In brief statements made before the traditional "informal 
meeting of foreign ministers" and prior to tomorrow's opening of 
the OAS General Assembly, most ministers came out in favor of 
maintaining the policy of sanctions against the Haitian coupist 
military. 
  Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga, who will 
chair the "ad hoc" OAS foreign ministers meeting to be held on 
Monday to study the Haitian crisis, affirmed that they have 
drafted a resolution of consensus that is almost finished. It 
is almost certain that a statement will be issued here 
"reaffirming the search for a peaceful solution based on all the 
UN and OAS resolutions that have been adopted throughout this 
period," Aranibar stated. 
  The Bolivian foreign minister said that, at the 24th OAS 
General Assembly being held in this Brazilian coastal city, the 
countries of the continent will also condemn "all illegal acts 
that are being committed and the continual and systematic 
violation of human rights in Haiti." 
  Among the OAS countries, "there is a deep conviction that a 
return to democracy and the return of President (Jean-Bertrand) 
Aristide are essential elements for the peaceful solution that 
the continent wants," Aranibar said. He added that his country 
"is opposed to any armed action." "Any decision along those 
lines could cause a cure worse that the illness," the president 
of the "ad-hoc" meeting said, adding that "some new ideas" are 
being studied to reinforce sanctions, "but nothing spectacular." 
  Strobe Talbott, U.S. under secretary of state, whose country 
has not ruled out armed intervention in Haiti to resolve the 
crisis following the coup against Aristide in 1991, did not 
refer to this point, but indicated that he expects that this 
meeting will reiterate the message of the international 
community that "the de facto government must end very soon." 
  "We have already done plenty for this to happen through 
cooperation, and we hope that new steps are adopted in the next 
few days and weeks," added Talbott, even though he did not 
specify the types of additional measures he was referring to. 
  The U.S. representative to the OAS meeting was optimistic 
regarding a solution to the Haitian crisis because of the 
"extraordinary solidarity" Assembly participants have displayed 
regarding this problem. 
  Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister Fernando Naranjo, on 
the 
other hand, said "there are still certain diplomatic, economic, 
and financial actions that can be implemented before thinking of 
more extreme measures." He added, "I believe that it is still 
not time for the use of force; instead, certain additional 
sanctions are still required. 
  The only person to openly admit the possibility of military 
intervention in Haiti was Argentine Foreign Relations Minister 
Guido di Tella who said his country would back an action of this 
sort if it were agreed to and authorized by the UN Security 
Council. Nevertheless, Di Tella affirmed that for the time 
being, what has to be done is to guarantee the closure of the 
border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic in order to 
comply with the total embargo imposed by the Security Council, 
which went into effect on 21 May.
