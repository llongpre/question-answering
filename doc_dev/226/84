  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar -- Bolivian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar said here today that U.S. Vice President Al 
Gore is interested in knowing the positions of Bolivia, 
Argentina, and Brazil regarding the continental summit organized 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton for December in Miami. 
  Bolivia was the first country visited by Gore on his tour to 
these three countries. Aranibar met with the U.S. vice 
president during the eight hours he was in Bolivia yesterday 
before traveling to Buenos Aires, where he finds himself today. 
  Aranibar told EFE that Gore had expressed his wish to 
receive 
from the Latin American leaders "topics for the future 
inter-American dialogue," an initiative that demands appropriate 
preparation. 
  Gore also discussed drug enforcement with Bolivian President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and other Bolivian personalities, 
although it was "not the central subject" of conversation, 
Aranibar said. 
  Following his visit to Bolivia, Gore is currently in Buenos 
Aires, from where he will travel to Brasilia, the last leg of 
his Latin American tour. He will stay in Brasilia for six hours. 
  The Bolivian foreign minister arrived today on an official 
flight from La Paz to attend a meeting of the foreign ministers 
of the Rio Group. The Rio Group is made up of 13 members: 
Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, 
Paraguay, Uruguay, Mexico, Ecuador, Guatemala (representing 
Central America), and Trinidad and Tobago (representing the 
Caribbean). 
  The 48-hour Rio Group meeting began today at Itamaraty 
Palace, and is being held precisely to discuss positions for the 
summit organized by Clinton, and for a preliminary document 
prepared by experts from several governments and the Economic 
Commission for Latin America, ECLA, on "poverty, the neglected 
sectors, and unemployment." 
  Regarding the summit in Miami, Aranibar said that the 
countries of the continent must prepare "an agenda for the new 
world" which must include the main subjects that will dominate 
the inter-American dialogue in the next few years. 
  He also said that certain subjects connected with economic 
and social development, as well as regional integration -- 
including the possible membership of other Latin American 
countries to the North American Free Trade Agreement among the 
United States, Canada, and Mexico -- must also be included in 
the agenda. 
  According to Aranibar, the inter-American subjects for the 
Miami summit must include participative democracy, the struggle 
against corruption, the stability and solidness of the 
democratic institutions, and rational development.
