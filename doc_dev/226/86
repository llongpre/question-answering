  [Text] Lima, 27 May (EFE) -- In Lima today the Cartagena 
Agreement Board announced that Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela 
have decided to implement the Andean Common External Tariff 
(AEC) as of 31 December 1994. 
  Representatives of the three countries managed to overcome 
disagreements of a conceptual and technical nature and undertook 
serious commitments in this direction during the meeting held by 
the Andean Group Commission, the highest level organ of the 
Andean integration process, during the past four days in this 
capital. 
  The commitment is contained in a decision draft, as the 
integration mandates are called, proposing a tariff structure 
and preferential treatment for Bolivia and Ecuador, as well as 
mechanisms for unifying in time the products that are still 
unable to fully adopt the AEC by 31 December 1994. 
  The project also includes a system for the implementation of 
agreements reached by Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela in the 
automobile sector through a sectorial agreement, and the 
commitment to adopt specific variable rights for agricultural 
products affected by the variations in international prices. 
  It also includes strict mechanisms to restore 
competitiveness 
when one of the member countries is affected by the application 
of tariffs other than the AEC after 31 December 1994, according 
to a press communique issued by the Cartagena Agreement Board. 
  According to the communique, the decision draft implements a 
measure that consolidates the Customs Union [Union Aduanera] and 
establishes clear mechanisms regulating competition between the 
member countries. 
  The Andean Group has established four tariff levels of 5, 
10, 
15, and 20 percent, depending on the merchandise involved. 
  Peru is currently under a special regime within the Andean 
Group, approved in April, that allows it to temporarily regulate 
its trade in the region through bilateral agreements until the 
rest of the member countries gradually eliminate the 
protectionist tariffs they maintain in various economic fields. 
  Peru, according to the mentioned system, continues as an 
observer at the meetings of the commission designed to discuss 
the AEC, and is authorized to maintain tariffs at 15 and 20 
percent.
