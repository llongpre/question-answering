  [Text] Santiago, 20 May (EFE) -- Upon his return today 
from Buenos Aires where he met his Argentine counterpart, 
Fernando Petrella, Chilean Foreign Relations Under Secretary 
Jose Miguel Insulza noted the number of similar viewpoints 
shared by Chile and Argentina regarding bilateral and 
multilateral issues. 
  Insulza stated that in the multilateral field the two 
countries share very similar viewpoints regarding the problem in 
Haiti, the hemispheric summit in Miami called by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, and the upcoming OAS meeting. 
  Regarding the Haitian crisis, the Chilean Foreign Ministry 
stated that it recognizes the constitutional Haitian Government 
headed by President Jean Bertrand Aristides and recognizes as 
its representative the current charge d'affaires in Santiago, 
Guy Pierre Andre, who this week publicly repudiated the new de 
facto government installed by the coupist military. 
  In the bilateral field, Insulza said important progress was 
made in this area during his visit to Buenos Aires and that the 
Argentine Government has voiced its interest in Chile's 
expressed desire to seek a commercial agreement with the Common 
Market of the South (Mercosur). 
  The Chilean under secretary, who did not rule out the 
possibility that Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa will 
make a proposal in this regard during his visit to Buenos Aires 
on 8 June, said: "The Argentine representatives expressed full 
support for the Chilean desire and we hope to reach an agreement 
in the next few days." 
  Moreover, Jose Miguel Insulza announced that in view of the 
next meeting Presidents Carlos Menem and Eduardo Frei will hold 
in Santiago in August, it has been agreed to establish a joint 
committee that will be in charge of assessing the legal and 
bureaucratic obstacles that still hinder the fulfillment of 
previous agreements, especially in the commercial field. 
  Insulza added that the presidents believe the agreements 
already signed by the two countries are enough for an important 
and deep-rooted binational integration process and that the 
problem boils down to bureaucratic and legal obstacles in the 
two countries that prevent them from working in a more efficient 
manner.
