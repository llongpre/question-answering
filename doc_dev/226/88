    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 9 June. 
  On 7 June the Central Bank reported that the Chilean trade 
balance registered a $334.2 million surplus between 1 January to 
15 May, with exports at $3.9001 billion and imports at $3.5659 
billion. This figure differs from the $62.2 million deficit 
registered during the same period in 1993, and confirms Chile's 
rebound in exports, which had been affected in 1993 by the drop 
in the prices of copper, cellulose, fishmeal, and fruit, among 
other products. Economic authorities said that the increase in 
the price of copper greatly contributed to improving the trade 
balance. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1753 GMT 7 Jun 94) 
  The Andean Board, headquartered in Lima, reported that the 
Andean Group has become a major Chilean trade partner in the 
past few years. Sales to these countries went from $525 million 
in 1992 to $585 million in 1993. However, exports to Japan 
dropped from $1.714 billion to $1.543 billion; to the United 
States from $1.58 billion to $1.532 billion; and to Brazil from 
$451 million to $424 million. During this period Chile exported 
to the Andean area a greater number of products than any other 
country, with the number of various products rising from 2,456 
to 2,509. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1638 GMT 3 Jun 94) 
  The Chilean Foreign Ministry Economic Department has 
reported 
that Chile's foreign investments since 1990 amount to $3.486 
billion, out of which a total of $2.373 billion was invested in 
Argentina, $636 million in Peru; $192.9 million in Brazil; and 
$69 million in Venezuela. Investments were also made in Panama, 
with $39.9 million; Cuba, $32.3 million; Ecuador, $16.4 million; 
Bolivia, $7.5 million; Colombia, $6.9 million; Uruguay, $2.7 
million; Costa Rica, $1 million; and Mexico, $750,000. A total 
of 105 companies have invested abroad. (Madrid EFE in Spanish
