  [Text] Caracas, 27 May (EFE) -- Enzo del Bufalo, minister 
of the Central Office of Coordination and Planning, today 
resigned in what appears to the beginning of a crisis in Rafael 
Caldera's government. 
  Del Bufalo has become the first minister of Caldera's 
government to resign from his post in the 114 days of the 
current administration. Nevertheless, it has been pointed out 
that in the coming hours other officials will leave the cabinet 
team. 
  Christian Democrat Caldera is preparing to make important 
changes in his government team, which in the eyes of his 
political adversaries, has offered an image of contradictions 
with regard to his policies, particularly in the economic field. 
The changes, it appears, are an attempt to revitalize his 
government, which appears trapped between the severity of the 
crisis and social demands. 
  Today, the Venezuelan press points out that all the 
ministers 
will place their posts at the president's disposal, thus making 
it easier for Caldera, who assumed power on 2 February, to make 
the changes he may deem necessary. 
  The opposition has accused Caldera of offering a 
contradictory image with regard to the policies that he insists 
on applying, and his ministers have found themselves in 
seriously contradictory positions. Nevertheless, it is a 
tradition of the old-time politician, who already governed 
Venezuela between 1969-74, to make his decisions under total 
secrecy until he decides to inform the nation, such as when he 
designated his cabinet a few hours before assuming the 
presidency. 
  The departure of Transport and Communication Minister Cesar 
Quintini has been reported by the Venezuelan media as a fact, 
although he has denied his resignation. Quintini is accused of 
maintaining a tolerant attitude with regard to corruption in his 
ministry. 
  Rafael Irribarren, deputy minister of transport and 
communication, resigned one month ago from his post after 
accusing Quintini of obstructing his efforts to dismantle the 
complex network of corruption that functions in that ministry. 
Irribarren charged that in his ministry, licenses, permits, and 
other official documents are sold and that commission fees are 
charged for granting concessions. 
  Local political sources claim that Quintini's continued 
presence in his post has created serious doubts about Caldera's 
will to struggle against corruption, one of the electoral 
banners that took him to the presidency. Other ministers are 
unhappy because they believe they have not received the support 
they need for a successful start to their duties. 
  In almost four months of government, Caldera has had to face 
a grave economic crisis, with a fiscal deficit of more than $4.5 
billion. The devaluation of the bolivar has become a pressing 
problem for Caldera. The dollar, which at the beginning of the 
month had been valued at 127.15 bolivares, this past Wednesday 
was valued at 175. 
  It appears that Development Minister Luis Carlos Palacios 
and 
Agriculture Minister Ciro Fonseca Anez could also leave the 
government.
