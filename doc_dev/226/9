  [Text] Caracas, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister 
Miguel Angel Burelli has announced the creation of the 
Association of Caribbean States, which he defined as an 
important step within the process of regional integration. 
Burelli, who made the announcement on Monday when he dedicated 
the Department of Latin America and the Caribbean at the Central 
University of Venezuela (UCV), explained that the association 
will include all of the Caribbean states and will begin work on 
4 July. 
  As of 1969 and following the process of independence of the 
countries forming part of Caribbean Common Market, Venezuela 
designed an "unchanging policy of lending a hand" to these 
nations with the sole purpose of serving its neighbors, the 
foreign minister emphasized. Venezuela is the only country that 
has 12 embassies and 10 cultural centers in the Caribbean. It 
also signed the San Jose Pact with Mexico, which supplies 
petroleum to those nations under special payment conditions. In 
addition, the government in Caracas has signed a Caribbean 
Development Bank exchange program that allows the granting of 
recoverable lines of credit to the Caribbean countries. 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister expressed his support for a 
massive Venezuelan projection into the Caribbean that, with the 
exception of Trinidad-Tobago and Guyana, is made up of small 
nations without large resources and with a small population.
