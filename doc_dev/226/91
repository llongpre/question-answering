  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- The 
Central American governments have agreed not to receive Haitian 
refugees, as was requested by U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
official Central American sources have told EFE. 
  The matter of the refugees was discussed by the chiefs of 
state of the region who met yesterday in Costa Rica and later in 
the Colombian city of Cartagena, where the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit is being held today and tomorrow. 
  Although they have not made an official announcement en 
bloc, 
they decided not to accept the refugees, not even temporarily, 
sources from a Central American country who chose to remain 
anonymous have told EFE. 
  Clinton asked the governments of the Central American 
countries last month to accept the refugees fleeing the Haitian 
crisis, while it was decided whether their cases could be 
considered cases of economic or political emigration. If the 
cases were political, they would be admitted into the United 
States. 
  The request regarding the Haitian refugees was made directly 
to the six Central American presidents last month when they met 
in Tegucigalpa with U.S. Vice President Al Gore. 
  Several countries turned down the request because of 
economic 
or emigration problems in their respective countries. Others, 
such as Costa Rica and El Salvador, said unenthusiastically that 
they would consider the matter. 
  Honduras, which a couple of years ago gave asylum to a group 
of Haitians and later had problems assimilating them, had said 
beforehand that it could not receive any more refugees.
