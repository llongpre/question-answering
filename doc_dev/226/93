<F P=106> [Report by the Cecilia Canones from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] According to Senator Aydee Castillo de Lopez, 
president of the Senate Foreign Policy Committee, it is highly 
unusual for the United States to deny asylum to Haitian 
refugees, while, at the same time, asking Venezuela to receive 
them. The senator added that Venezuela currently is not in the 
best of economic and social conditions to receive the Haitian 
refugees. 
  She stressed that it was quite unexpected that a highly 
developed nation such as the United States has decided not to 
give the refugees asylum, and yet it has asked a country like 
Venezuela--a nation facing a crisis--to receive them. She added 
that what is even more unusual is that the Venezuelan Government 
has decided to accept the request.
