  [Text] Santiago, 6 May (EFE) -- The Declaration of Santiago 
on the exercise of the profession of journalism was approved 
here today by all delegates except for those from Chile and 
Venezuela. 
  After a heated debate, the declaration was approved. It 
summarizes in 10 points the five days of work carried out during 
the seminar on the Development of the Media and Democracy in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, which began on 2 May and which 
was organized by UNESCO, the United Nations, and the Chilean 
Government. 
  The Santiago Declaration was approved by consensus, except 
for article eight to which the Chilean and Venezuelan 
journalists associations objected. They favor unconditional 
exercise of journalism. 
  The confrontation was between the Chilean Journalists 
Association and the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA), 
which groups continental written media owners. 
  In its main points, the Santiago Declaration remarks that 
freedom of expression "is the cornerstone" of democracy and that 
it is essential for peace and development. 
  The 400 delegates to the seminar ask governments to 
guarantee 
freedom of expression and their professional work, and they 
condemn the violence to which some journalists are subjected, as 
well as all prohibitions and controls.
