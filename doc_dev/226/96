  [Text] Brazil and Venezuela have reactivated their 
cooperation activities, thus overcoming a period of tensions 
that characterized the coexistence of these two countries for 
almost 150 years. At the conclusion of the visit paid by 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco to his Venezuelan counterpart 
Rafael Caldera, the importance of the meeting was underlined by 
the level of the Brazilian ministers who also came to La Guaira, 
that is, the heads of five important ministries in the foreign 
affairs field: the industry and commerce, mines and energy, 
foreign affairs, environment, and justice ministers. 
  The two presidents issued a joint communique creating a 
high-level binational commission that will be in charge of 
stepping up cooperation in the border areas. The commission 
will be headed by the foreign ministers, and will include all 
the sectors of the Brazilian and Venezuelan economy. 
  To mark the meeting the presidents signed a protocol which 
is 
to be added to the 1977 friendship and cooperation agreement 
between the two countries. Caldera stated emphatically: "What 
happened in the Amazon jungle a few months ago (the murder of 
Ianomami Indians) helped us open our eyes, and made us aware of 
the need to harmonize our policies and join efforts to attend to 
this vast Amazon region, which has great natural resources." 
  The visit was also commented on by Alberto Poletto, 
president 
of the Venezuelan Foreign Trade Institute. In his opinion, the 
meeting contributed to increased bilateral commercial relations. 
  Trade between Venezuela and Brazil amounts to approximately 
$800 million, with a $200 million balance in Brazil's favor. 
  A partial agreement negotiated in 1991, by which Brazil 
granted Venezuela preferential taxes for 600 new items, is 
currently in force. Venezuela has granted Brazil preferential 
taxes for 300 new products. Venezuela purchases 37 percent of 
what it purchases from ALADI [Latin American Integration 
Association] member countries in Brazil. 
  During the meeting the presidents raised several 
international issues, such as: 
  -- President Itamar Franco said that Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South] can coexist with NAFTA or with the Andean 
Pact. 
  -- Regarding the candidates for OAS secretary general, 
Franco commented that "Brazil received a request, which we are 
assessing, that this post be occupied by the president of a 
certain Republic. We have discussed the issue with the Colombian 
Foreign Ministry." 
  Brazil has already announced its support for Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria. The Venezuelan president said that 
Venezuela supports its Foreign Minister Burelli Rivas. 
  -- Regarding Argentina's purchase of fighter bombers from 
the United States, Franco asserted that Brazil does not 
interfere in other countries' policies, and that its policy is 
one that seeks peace. Caldera noted that Venezuela's stance is 
similar to Brazil's. He does not believe there is an ongoing 
arms race in Latin America, nor that the United States wants to 
promote one.
