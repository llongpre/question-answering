<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas has 
described recent announcements by President Rafael Caldera as 
pronouncements of sovereign measures to reestablish Venezuela's 
financial system and to recover confidence. 
  Burelli Rivas said that these measures do not harm 
Venezuela's image abroad and that instead, they signify the new 
way of governing the country with authority within the framework 
of the Constitution. He rejected the possibility that the 
measures are in any way contrary to the interests of foreign 
investors. 
  The foreign minister said that the measures have not alarmed 
foreigners because similar situations have occurred in other 
countries. He said the economic measures have produced 
expectations rather than concern about whether they will affect 
bilateral or multilateral agreements. The foreign minister said 
the suspension of some economic guarantees would have no effect 
unless they were accompanied by the suspension of some 
constitutional guarantees. 
  [Begin Burelli Rivas recording] The damage caused in the 
finance and banking system and the struggle against drug 
trafficking requires that the state should be able to arrest 
people, search for people, or prevent certain people from 
leaving the country quickly, without having to wait for a judge 
to issue an arrest warrant. 
  The economic measures alone would have served no purpose had 
they not been accompanied by the suspension of guarantees on 
free travel throughout the territory, departure from the 
country, transit in general, and the possibility of raiding the 
businesses of people supected of being involved in 
drugtrafficking activities. 
  This is the reason for the suspension of guarantees. [end
