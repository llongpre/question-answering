<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] According to Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli 
Rivas, the election of a new Colombian president will not change 
relations between Venezuela and Colombia. 
  Burelli has said Venezuela is quite pleased with the results 
of the Colombian election in which Liberal Party candidate 
Ernesto Samper was elected president. 
  The foreign minister said the fact that the marine and 
submarine area delimitation issue in the Gulf of Venezuela had 
not been discussed as part of the election campaign is a very 
encouraging sign for bilateral relations. 
  The new Colombian president, Ernesto Samper, will take 
office 
on 7 August.
