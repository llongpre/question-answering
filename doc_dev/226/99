<F P=106> [Interview with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel </F>
Burelli Rivas by Maria Victoria Cristancho; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Cristancho] What path should Venezuelan foreign 
policy follow in the next five years? 
  [Burelli] Venezuelan foreign policy must reflect order in 
our 
country and domestic dignity. Restoring the image of our 
country overseas is a priority, but leaving aside an excessive 
extroversion, which is not convenient for a country facing a 
critical economic situation. 
  [Cristancho] Do you share the view that there is a campaign 
to tarnish Venezuela's reputation overseas? 
  [Burelli] Actually, there is such a campaign, but it can be 
fought by putting our house in order. This -- putting the house 
in order -- requires the assistance of the Venezuelan media so 
that they do not contribute to those who, from overseas, call us 
a chaotic nation. If we convey a negative image to the foreign 
sensationalistic media, we will never be able to attract foreign 
investors. 
  [Cristancho] But governments have also been accused of a 
lack 
of coherence in their handling of foreign policy? 
  [Burelli] That is true. The Foreign Ministry must be the 
only one to coordinate the country's foreign policy. There 
cannot be a parallel foreign ministry, as once existed, 
operating in a place other than the Yellow House. State 
governments cannot hold autonomous foreign relations because 
Venezuela is a federal republic with a central and presidential 
government in which the president is responsible for conducting 
relations with other nations. 
  [Cristancho] What are your priorities as the new foreign 
minister? 
  [Burelli] The defense of national sovereignty, international 
cooperation, and the conquest -- via friendship and 
understanding -- of all the benefits Venezuela is entitled to as 
a member of the international community. In order to do this, a 
national international policy is necessary; in other words, a 
consistent policy is necessary. I am determined, with President 
Caldera's authorization, to revive the Foreign Relations 
Advisory Committee, and activate it so that its criteria and 
experience can be used to guide and direct Venezuelan foreign 
policy. 
  Regarding cooperation, Venezuela has always been very 
generous, and although this attitude pays off somewhat, we will 
examine whether we should keep or rectify this policy, giving 
preference to our problems over those of other countries. 
Venezuela is not a superpower, but a medium-sized country, 
whose strength lies in its dignity rather than squandering. 
  [Cristancho] Will that view be reflected in the 
restructuring 
of the Foreign Ministry? 
  [Burelli] I will focus on economizing with human resources. 
In other words, I will keep officials for their talent and 
devotion to work, and will thank and send home those who do not 
meet these requisites. Diplomatic missions often have too many 
employees. Since employees were earning dollars, the missions 
became a popular place to practice patronage. 
  [Cristancho] How will Venezuelan relations with other 
nations 
be? 
  [Burelli] We should act with the certainty of being a 
country 
that has always played by the rules. There are priorities in 
our foreign relations such as our friendship with Colombia, 
Brazil, the United States, and in general, with all countries. 
These relations are significant because some of those countries 
can offer us capital, technology, and guidance while others can 
support us in international organizations such as the OAS and 
the United Nations. 
  [Cristancho] What does globalization mean? 
  [Burelli] Globalization is the norm of our times, based on 
the global village the current world has become. However, there 
are problems we have that must be considered from a universal 
viewpoint. In addition, there should also be a regional outlook, 
which is more realistic and in which we move via alliances, 
cooperation programs, and hemispheric organizations. I believe 
globalization is harmony between the region and the world. 
  [Cristancho] Do you believe, contrarily, that between 
Colombia and Venezuela there is an asymmetrical relationship, 
which is detrimental to us? 
  [Burelli] That was the case in the past. Probably, the 
Colombian Government is already taking steps to prevent 
Colombians from coming to Venezuela as much anymore because the 
economic situation has improved, despite other difficulties. I 
believe the flow of Colombians into Venezuela will decrease. 
  [Cristancho] Regarding issues such as the theft of 
vehicles, Venezuela is still suffering from a lack of interest 
on the part of Colombia. 
  [Burelli] Regarding that particular issue, Colombia 
recognizes through its government that there has been neglect 
and even complicity by its border authorities. 
  [Cristancho] Then, should not a tougher stand be demanded 
from Colombian authorities? 
  [Burelli] Of course. I have told Colombian officials that 
the agreement regarding the return of stolen vehicles must be 
complied with because they know we care about that very much. 
  [Cristancho] Could this not be used as a negotiation 
instrument by Colombia? 
  [Burelli] I don't think so. The best thing that could happen 
to the two countries is that this flow of stolen vehicles on the 
Colombian-Venezuelan border stops. 
  [Cristancho] But shouldn't we speak more forcefully to 
Colombia so that it complies with the agreement? 
  [Burelli] I do not believe we should be more forceful. We 
should speak with dignity. It is not necessary to speak 
forcefully when we speak the truth. 
  [Cristancho] Regarding the delimitation of marine and 
submarine areas in the Gulf of Venezuela, do you believe a 
short-term solution might be reached? 
  [Burelli] I have no current knowledge of any talks held in 
this regard. It would be dishonest to express my view on such a 
controversial issue without knowing about the progress made by 
the negotiating commission. 
  [Cristancho] Do you believe the delimitation issue is more 
political than real? 
  [Burelli] The delimitation issue involves various aspects. 
It is a legal and, basically, a political issue. Its solution 
is more urgent than other common problems. Neither country can 
afford not to resolve this problem when very successful deals 
are occurring in other areas. 
  [Cristancho] Is the gulf issue the stumbling block in the 
relations between Colombia and Venezuela? 
  [Burelli] Yes, because it is a difficult issue and if it is 
not resolved, other obstacles will continue to exist. It is a 
major problem. The fluid way in which other issues are being 
handled should encourage us to reach an agreement on it. 
  [Cristancho] Colombia has lacked the will to avoid border 
incidents? 
  [Burelli] I think some attention has been lacking on the 
part 
of its government. 
  [Cristancho] What is the vulnerable point in Venezuela's 
relations with Brazil? 
  [Burelli] The stage setting of our relations with Brazil is 
the obscure and immense jungle that separates us. The approach 
to the border issue is different in this case because this is 
not an operative border. Last year, the limelight was on 
rambling gold-diggers [garimpeiros] and the Yanomami Indians and 
a conflict almost ensued but the two countries wisely prevented 
it. The issue is not easy. President Caldera plans to develop 
the southern region. The Brazilian and Venezuelan Governments 
should have an intense dialogue on this. The presidents of the 
two countries will meet at the beginning of March to try to 
jointly find a solution to common problems. 
  [Cristancho] How should hemispheric strength be promoted? 
  [Burelli] The OAS must make efforts to strengthen each of 
the 
member states, which must realize that the OAS must be the 
setting for discussing hemispheric matters. 
  [Cristancho] What is the role of the Group of Three, the 
South American Common Market, the Caribbean Common Market, and 
the Andean Group? 
  [Burelli] If the OAS works well and is used and respected by 
all, there is no need for subregional groups. There should be 
no bypassing the OAS because this weakens and brings discredit 
to this organization. 
  [Cristancho] Do you maintain your candidacy for the post of 
secretary general of the OAS? 
  [Burelli] The Venezuelan candidacy remains firm and we will 
continue to work to secure that post. The Foreign Ministry post 
is not contradictory to being a candidate to that OAS post. If 
you don't believe me, ask Bernd Niehaus, the Costa Rican 
aspirant to that post.
