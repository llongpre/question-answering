   Michaels Stores Inc. said it signed a letter of intent to acquire Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s three arts and crafts outlets for $2.3 million. 

   The sale, which is expected to close at the end of the month, marks the end of Wal-Mart's dabbling in craft stores. 
It started the Helen's Arts &amp; Crafts chain, named after the wife of Wal-Mart founder and chairman, Sam Walton, about four years ago. 
The three Helen's stores are in Monroe, La.; Fort Smith, Ark.; and Springfield, Mo. 

   Paul Carter, Wal-Mart's chief financial officer, said the stores were profitable but didn't mesh well with Wal-Mart's other stores, which emphasize high volume and low prices. 
Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., owns Wal-Mart stores, Sam's Wholesale Clubs, a small chain of discount pharmacies and a new, gigantic discount grocery and general merchandise store called Hypermart. 

   Michaels operates 97 crafts stores.
