   The Bentonville, Ark., discount retailer's earnings were
slightly better than many Wall Street analysts' forecast of
29 cents a share for the quarter. Analysts attributed the
gains to strong sales growth at Wal-Mart discount stores and
Sam's Club warehouse outlets.
   While sales at stores open more than a year grew an
average 2.2% in July for 14 large U.S. retailers, Wal-Mart's
samestore sales jumped 13%, said Robert F. Buchanan, a retail
analyst for Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. Mr. Buchanan attributed
the strong sales, in part, to Wal-Mart's store locations in
regions such as the Southwest and Southeast, which are
weathering the recession better than the coasts.
   The company also continued its rapid expansion, opening 36
Wal-Mart stores and six Sam's Clubs during the quarter. In
late New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Wal-Mart's stock was quoted at $48.875, up 75 cents.
