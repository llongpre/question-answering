   NCR Corp. said it won a big contract from Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. in which the discount retailer will install one of the
first models in NCR's new computer line in 800 of its stores.
Terms weren't disclosed.
   In a meeting with securities analysts late last week, NCR
Chairman Charles E. Exley said contracts like the one with
NCR provide the first evidence that NCR's new computer line
will be successful. NCR is fighting a hostile $6.12 billion
bid from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.

   Under the Wal-Mart contract, NCR's model 3445 computer
will connect retail terminals within stores and with larger
central computers over a satellite data network, NCR said.
Model 3445 is based on Intel Corp.'s 486 processor and
industry-standard software, and is priced from $20,000 to
$85,000, depending on configuration. Analysts estimated the
contract's value, assuming some volume discounts, at more
than $20 million. A Wal-Mart executive would say only that
the use of standard software in the systems "gives us
tremendous negotiating leverage" in purchasing.
   Wal-Mart announced late last year that Hewlett-Packard Co.
would provide computers to half of its 1,600 stores. The 800
NCR computers will perform identical functions using the same
software, fulfilling a strategy to cut costs by buying
standard gear from multiple suppliers, the Wal-Mart executive
said.
