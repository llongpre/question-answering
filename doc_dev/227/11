   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a surge in first-quarter earnings
and sales Tuesday, attributing the performance to the fast-growing
chain's improvements in costs and inventory management.
   Meanwhile, Limited Inc., a leading apparel retailer, said its
first-quarter earnings soared 89 percent over the lackluster
results of a year earlier.
   Wal-Mart, the nation's No. 3 retailer behind Sears, Roebuck and
Co. and K mart Corp. said earnings for the three months ended April
30 totaled $198.29 million or 35 cents a share, a 29 percent jump
over the $153.5 million or 27 cents a share reported in the
year-earlier quarter.
   Sales totaled $5.37 billion, a 25 percent jump over the $4.31
billion figure a year earlier.
   As of April 30, the Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart operated
1,279 Wal-Mart stores, 106 Sam's Wholesale clubs, 14 Dot Discount
Drug stores and three Hypermart USA units. A year earlier, the
company had 1,144 Wal-Mart stores, 86 Sam's Wholesale clubs, 14 Dot
Discount Drug stores and one Hypermart USA unit.
   ``First quarter sales, driven by improved apparel sales and
basic in-stock positions, ran above plan throughout the period,''
David Glass, Wal-Mart president and chief executive officer, said
in a release. ``Improved expense control and better inventory
management converted this positive sales trend to good earnings
results.
   ``Our aggressive sales and earnings plans for the balance of the
year can now be pursued with this sound first quarter as our
foundation,'' he said.
   Limited reported first-quarter net income of $45.2 million, or
25 cents per share, up from $23.9 million, or 13 cents per share, a
year earlier.
   The Columbus, Ohio-based company reported first-quarter sales of
$964.6 million, up from $811.1 million in the first three months of
1988, when it and other apparel retailers were in the midst of a
year-long slump.
   ``We are pleased with our first-quarter increases, achieved in
what I still believe to be a lackluster environment,'' Chairman
Leslie H. Wexner said in a statement.
   Limited operates 3,411 apparel stores, including Limited,
Express, Henri Bendel, Victoria's Secret, Lerner, Lane Bryant,
Lerner Woman and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. The company also operates
mail order businesses under the Brylane and Victoria's Secret names.
