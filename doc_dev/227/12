   BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it settled
a lawsuit with a trade union and agreed to make additional
disclosures about certain tranasctions between the company
and relatives of Chairman Sam Walton.
   The Food and Allied Service Trades department of the
AFL-CIO said the retailer agreed to make a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and issue a news release
disclosing transactions between Wal-Mart and a fan company
owned by Mr. Walton and his family. It also will disclose a
shopping center lease between Wal-Mart and E. Stanley
Kroenke, the son-in-law of James L. Walton, a company
director and Mr. Walton's brother.

   The trade union, which owns 20 Wal-Mart shares, last week
sued the company, charging that it failed to disclose a
number of related-party transactions.
   After the suit was filed, Wal-Mart sent shareholders
supplementary proxy material disclosing the suit and its
charges. It also said it had disclosed in an earlier SEC
filing that during the year ended Jan. 31, Mr. Kroenke had
ownership interests in shopping centers that leased space for
27 Wal-Mart stores. It said it paid $6.3 million in rents and
maintenance fees for the leases, of which Mr. Kroenke's
interest was $3.8 million.
   Wal-Mart also said that Frank Robson, Sam Walton's
brother-in-law, had ownership interests in store locations
and that his shares of rents and maintenance fees totalled
$2.5 million. Further, it said Mr. Robson paid Wal-Mart
$308,897 in principal and interest under four notes. Mr.
Robson owed the company $2 million at April 30 for loans to
expand four store locations.
