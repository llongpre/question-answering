   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said Tuesday it
had record sales and profits for the fourth quarter and for the
year ended Jan. 31.
   Wal-Mart said its fourth-quarter net income increased 32 percent
to $425.9 million, or 75 cents a share, from $323.2 million, or 57
cents a share, in the final quarter of 1988.
   Sales totaled $8.1 billion compared with $6.5 billion a year
earlier, a gain of 24 percent.
   For the year, the nation's third-largest discount retailer said
its earnings jumped 28.5 percent to $1.1 billion, or $1.90 a share,
from $837 million, or $1.48 a share, the year before. Sales rose to
$25 billion, up 25 percent from $20.6 billion.
   ``We are extremely pleased to report another record year of
sales and earnings,'' David Glass, Wal-Mart president and chief
executive officer, said in a written statement. ``We remain
committed to our everyday low-pricing program on name-brand
merchandise while working to exceed our customer's expectations of
service.''
   As of Jan. 31, the company operated 1,402 Wal-Mart stores, 123
Sam's Wholesale Clubs and three Hypermart-USA units compared with
1,259 Wal-Mart stores, 105 Sam's Wholesale Clubs, 14 dot Discount
Drug stores and one Hypermart-USA unit at the same time last year.
The sale of the dot Discount Drug stores was effective Feb. 1.
   Glass said the company's 1990 plans call for aggressive
expansion.
   ``We believe the new year will be an intensively competitive
environment but should provide a great opportunity for us to
perform in a manner consistent with prior years,'' he said.
   Wal-Mart operates in 29 states.
