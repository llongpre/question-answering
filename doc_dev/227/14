<HEAD>Lawyers Argue Wal-Mart Sanctions Case Before Appeals Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. asked
an appeals court Thursday to overturn a lower court's ruling that
the company pay as much as $1 million a day because its billionaire
chairman Sam Walton did not show up for a deposition.
   The 2nd Court of Appeals has not yet ruled on the case, a court
official said.
   The sanctions resulted from a personal injury lawsuit filed by
Andrew Carrizales against Wal-Mart and manager Jerry Rand.
Carrizales claims that while shopping at the company's Sulphur
Springs store in 1986 he slipped and fell on clear oil spilled on
the floor.
   Carrizales says he suffered mental anguish and ``serious and
disabling'' injuries to his arms, legs and back, the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram reported.
   Wallace Craig, Carrizales' attorney, said Wal-Mart was ordered to
produce Walton, who is also Wal-Mart's chief executive officer, for
a videotaped deposition in Bentonville, Ark., at the company's main
offices on Aug. 8.
   However, Walton's attorney petitioned a district judge in Benton
County in Arkansas to overrule the order of 352nd District Judge
John Street and requested the deposition be overseen by an Arkansas
court.
   Craig said he had no objections to conducting the deposition at
the Wal-Mart offices, but said he did not believe the testimony
would be admissible if it were taken by an Arkansas court reporter.
He also said the case is not under the jurisdiction of Arkansas
courts.
   ``I wanted to take his deposition where I was supposed to, and he
refused,'' Craig said.
   Street later ordered Wal-Mart to have Walton at the Fort Worth
court on Nov. 28 for a deposition or pay Carrizales for each day he
didn't show up.
   ``Walton ... has shown an arrogant disregard for the authority of
this court,'' the judge's ruling said. ``As chairman of the board of
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Walton owed the duties of obedience and loyal
behavior'' to the corporation to appear for the deposition.
   Street also ordered Wal-Mart's pleadings in the case stricken,
thereby knocking out the company's defenses in the suit, Craig said.
   Wal-Mart was ordered by Street to pay the plaintiff $10,000 for
the first day he did not appear; $20,000 for the second; $40,000 for
the third; $80,000 for the fourth; $160,000 for the fifth; $320,000
for the sixth; $640,000 for the seventh; $1.28 million for the
eighth; and $1 million a day for each day afterward.
   The appeals court stayed that order before Walton was scheduled
to appear in Fort Worth, Wal-Mart attorney Vic Anderson said, and
Thursday's appellate hearing was scheduled.
   Anderson said Texas law states that anyone who is not a party in
a lawsuit is able to provide a deposition in that case where they
live. Anderson declined to comment on the legal aspects of the suit.
   Craig said the personal injury suit is scheduled to go to trial
Monday.
