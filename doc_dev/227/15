<HEAD>Family Seeks Restructuring of Stock-Holding Method</HEAD>

   The family of the man who founded the
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. discount chain wants to restructure the way
they hold company stock, which could result in substantial tax
benefits, according to the company's proxy report.
   The Walton family members now hold 218 million Wal-Mart shares,
worth about $7.7 billion, as owners of a Delaware corporation
called Walton Enterprises that actually holds the stock. The
individual Waltons _ company founder Sam Walton and his four
children, S. Robson, John T., Jim C. and Alice L. _ own roughly
equal shares of Walton Enterprises.
   The recently released Wal-Mart proxy report says the family has
proposed to hold ownership of the Wal-Mart shares through a
partnership instead of a corporation. The report said family
members ``may obtain very substantial future tax advantages'' by
changing their holding method to a partnership.
   To do that, the Waltons have proposed an exchange of stock with
Wal-Mart Stores, provided that there is a tax ruling that the
exchange itself would not be taxed. The Wal-Mart board has named a
committee of its independent directors to review the proposed
exchange and negotiate its terms.
   Little Rock tax lawyer George Plastiras said tax laws would
apply differently to Wal-Mart stock held in a partnership instead
of through a corporation if there later is a distribution of the
stock to individual partners, upon dissolution of the partnership,
or to Walton Enterprises stockholders if it were dissolved as a
corporation.
   ``They can dissolve the partnership in a non-taxable event,''
Plastiras said.
   Woody Whyte, an analyst for the Little Rock investment banking
firm Staephens Inc., said the proposal ``has nothing to do with the
(Wal-Mart) company'' as such. The Walton-controlled stock still
would be controlled by the Waltons, he said.
