   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it will acquire Cullum Cos.' share of the two companies' Hypermart USA joint venture on Oct. 1. 

   Terms weren't disclosed. 

   Wal-Mart, a giant discount retailer based in Bentonville, Ark., and Cullum, a regional grocery and drugstore chain, agreed three years ago to build the European-style hypermarket stores in the Dallas area to test the market for a mammoth grocery and discount-goods store. 
The companies opened a store in Garland, Texas, in late 1987 and a store in Arlington, Texas, in mid-1988. 

   At the time, the companies said Cullum would bring expertise in grocery-store management and Wal-Mart would bring general-merchandise experience to the joint venture. 
But last year, Cullum went private in a $380 million leveraged buy-out, and it has been trying to sell some assets to reduce its debt, which was $443 million at April 1. 

   Cullum also said it wants to focus its efforts on expanding its Tom Thumb grocery stores and its Page Drug outlets. 
The company, which has sold about nine of its stores since the leveraged buy-out, said it will use the proceeds from its share of the joint venture to repay debt. 

   Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has expanded the hypermart concept on its own, opening a Hypermart USA store in Topeka, Kan., last year, and it is preparing to open a Kansas City, Mo., store in early 1990. 
It also has opened Wal-Mart Supercenters, which combine a grocery store with a WalMart discount store. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Wal-Mart shares closed at $41.125, down 87.5 cents.
