   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., continuing its rapid growth, said net income grew 34% for the second quarter ended July 31, to $179.6 million, or 32 cents a share, from $134.1 million, or 24 cents a share. 

   The Bentonville, Ark.-based discount chain attributed the gain to its ability to lower prices at its Wal-Mart stores and the stores' increasing market share. 
The lower prices, it said, stem from strict control of expenses and tax savings under new tax laws that were passed along to consumers. 

   Analysts also credited a strong performance at the company's Sam's Wholesale Club unit for the increase. 
Sam's last year acquired another membership-warehouse chain and this year has closed three overlapping stores. 

   Sales for the quarter increased 29.8%, to $4.85 billion from $3.73 billion last year. 

   For the six months, Wal-Mart said its net income rose 36.3%, to $333.2 million, or 59 cents a share, from $244.5 million, or 43 cents a share in the year-earlier period. 
Sales were $9.13 billion, up 31.4% from $6.94 billion last year.
