   WASHINGTON -- A union shareholder said it sued Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. in federal court here, charging that the giant
discounter failed to disclose in its proxy statement certain
transactions between Chairman Sam Walton and his family.
   The Food and Allied Service Trades Department of the
AFL-CIO, which said it owns 20 Wal-Mart shares, asked the
court to require Wal-Mart to correct its proxy statement and
to enjoin shareholders from voting on the current proxy
information. The company's annual meeting is scheduled for
June 7.

   In its lawsuit, the group charged that the company has
tried to deceive shareholders by failing to make full
disclosure of certain relationships. For instance, the
lawsuit charges that Wal-Mart leased properties owned by the
son-in-law of James L. Walton, a Wal-Mart director and senior
vice president and brother of the company's Chairman Sam
Walton, and also leased properties from Sam Walton's
brother-in-law.
   Wal-Mart also failed to disclose that it purchased fans
from a company owned by Walton Enterprises, which is partly
owned by Sam Walton and his son S. Robson Walton, a company
director, the suit said. In addition, the lawsuit said that
the company should have disclosed that Walton Enterprises
owns a substantial stake in Bank of Bentonville, which is
trustee for four Wal-Mart benefit plans.
   Robert Rhoads, Wal-Mart general counsel, said the company,
as a matter of policy, doesn't comment on litigation.
