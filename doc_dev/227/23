   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has entered into a
merger agreement to acquire The Wholesale Club Inc. for about $170
million, the companies announced Tuesday.
   Wal-Mart President David Glass said the Wholesale Club's outlets
and operations would complement Wal-Mart's Sam's Wholesale Club
Division and give the discount chain a significant presence in new
markets.
   The Wholesale Club operates 27 membership clubs in six states.
Sales for the six-month period ended Aug. 4 totaled $333 million.
   Wal-Mart operates 141 Sam's Wholesale outlets and 1,503 Wal-Mart
discount stores in 34 states.
   A statement by the companies said Wal-Mart would acquire The
Wholesale Club for the equivalent of $21 a share. With about 8
million shares outstanding, the deal is worth $170 million, said a
spokesman for The Wholesale Club.
   The Wholesale Club shareholders will have the option of
receiving either Wal-Mart common stock or cash for their common
stock, subject to the limitation that not more than 20 percent of
the aggregate may be paid in cash.
   The deal is subject to approval by The Wholesale Club's
shareholders and other conditions.
