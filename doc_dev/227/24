   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is making its first
foray into New England with five discount stores planned in New
Hampshire and a wholesale club scheduled to open in Maine.
   Patrick Peery, Wal-Mart's real estate manager, said Tuesday the
retailer chose New Hampshire as the site for the discount stores
because the state has no sales tax.
   The new Wal-Marts will be located near the borders of
Massachusetts and Maine to take advantage of shoppers from those
states who come to New Hampshire to avoid their states' sales
taxes, Peery said.
   The stores will be in Somersworth, Amherst, Derry, Seabrook and
Hooksett.
   Wal-Mart also said it would open a Sam's Wholesale Club in
Scarborough, Maine. Sam's Clubs are cash-and-carry warehouses open
to managers and owners of other stores and to groups such as
retirees.
   Wal-Mart, based largely in the Sunbelt and the Midwest, operates
1,527 discount stores in 35 states, including 146 Sam's Wholesale
Clubs and four Hypermart-USA stores.
   The company is the nation's third-largest retailer, behind
Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Kmart Corp.
