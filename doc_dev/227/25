   A Wal-Mart Stores Inc. unit evicted from the parking lots
of 24 of its Texas stores a hot-dog vendor and her elderly,
handicapped work force, according to the vendor, Scarlett
Rabalais.
   The move represents the latest salvo in a year-long battle
between the nation's largest retailer and Ms. Rabalais, who
five years ago introduced the concept of selling hot dogs at
Wal-Mart's Sam's Clubs in Texas as a way of employing the
disabled. Since then, Ms. Rabalais' Houston company, Hot
Diggity Dogs, has won a number of awards for its employment
of the underprivileged.

   But according to Ms. Rabalais, the little company also
demonstrated that the concept was financially viable --
giving Wal-Mart the desire to run its own stands at Sam's.
Although she gives the company a 10% cut of sales, she
concedes Wal-Mart probably earns more at the Sam's locations
outside Texas, where it operates its own stands.
   Last year, Sam's ordered Ms. Rabalais's hot-dog stands off
its Texas lots, then reversed its position after the media
publicized the implications of that order for the 92 elderly
and handicapped employees of Hot Diggity Dogs.
   Subsequently, Ms. Rabalais said, she and the company
failed after several attempts to negotiate a long-term
contract, prompting her to sue Wal-Mart in June.
   Ms. Rabalais said the eviction decision apparently was
prompted by her appearance this week on Hard Copy, the
national TV news program, during which she appealed to
Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton to let her and her workers stay
on Sam's lots.
   In Bentonville, Ark., Brenda Lockhart, a spokeswoman for
Sam's, which operates more than 150 stores nationwide, said
in a prepared statement that, "Since the action is in
litigation, we feel it's most proper to let the situation be
handled in court rather than in the news media."
