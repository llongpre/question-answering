<HEAD>Wal-Mart Earnings Up 22 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said Thursday its
third-quarter earnings rose 22 percent as the retailer continued to
thrive despite a slowdown in consumer spending.
   Wal-Mart said it earned $282.8 million, or 25 cents per share,
in the quarter ended Oct. 31, up from $232.7 million, or 20 cents
per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Sales at the Bentonville, Ark.-based company rose 26 percent to
$7.93 billion from $6.28 billion.
   Other retailers saw their sales slump during the quarter as
consumer confidence was shaken by the weakening economy and the
Persian Gulf crisis. Wal-Mart, which has outperformed the retail
industry for years, continued to do so in spite of the poor
environment.
   David Glass, Wal-Mart's president, said the company met its
goals for the quarter and for the first nine months of its fiscal
year.
   Wal-Mart earned $809.2 million, or 71 cents per share, for the
nine months ended Oct. 31, up from $650 million, or 57 cents per
share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month sales totaled $22.24 billion, up from $17.7 billion.
   The company has 1,503 Wal-Mart discount stores, 141 Sam's
wholesale clubs and four Hypermart USA stores in 34 states.
