<DESCRIPT>  RETAIL; COMPANY; ANALYSIS  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  In 1986, the company's revenues topped $10 billion for the first time and
management was ecstatic.;   Two years later the firm topped $20 billion in
annual sales, and this year it will ring up more than $40 billion in sales.
Equally important, profitability has kept pace, rising from $450 million in
1986 to an expected $1.6 billion this year -- and if you think the top brass
is happy, you should see the shareholders.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AT WAL-MART, GROWTH IS STILL NO. 1 PRODUCT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Shorter version ran on page 13D of the Stock Final edition  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     There's only one company in the world that sports those numbers, and this
one is based in Bentonville, Ark., and goes by the name of Wal-Mart Stores.;  
How happy are the shareholders?;   The stock, which has split two-for-one
twice in the last five years, was selling for $8 a share in 1986. It is now
around $46. While the company chooses to pump most of its profits back into
operations, it does pay a small dividend that has been growing like everything
else at Wal-Mart. The payout to shareholders has increased from 4 cents a
share in 1986 to 17 cents today.;   Corporate insiders, principally founder
Sam Walton, own 42 percent of the company's shares, which significantly
reduces the amount of stock that's available to the public.;   The company's
goal is to achieve $100 billion in sales from the Wal-Mart stores by the end
of the decade, and $30 billion from its Sam's Clubs. That would amount to a
four-fold increase during the 1990s.;   New store expansion will represent the
majority of the growth, since Wal-Mart is still a regional company and is just
beginning to enter the major population centers of California and the
Northeast. Currently, it has discount store locations in 37 states.;   In its
recent analysis of Wal-Mart, the brokerage house of Interstate/Johnson Lane of
Charlotte, N.C., said, "We believe the ingredients of Wal-Mart's incredible
success are not limited by its size, but only by its own desires, which we
think are as strong as ever.";   Sam's Club has become the leading company in
the rapidly expanding membership warehouse industry, perhaps the most
significant new development in retailing in recent years.;   The brokerage
also points out that Wal-Mart has begun to roll out a new growth vehicle, the
Wal-Mart Supercenter, which combines a Wal-Mart discount store with groceries.
"We also expect further benefits for customers as well as shareholders from
the company's 'Buy American' program, which has converted $5 billion of sales
from foreign to domestic sources and created or saved more than 80,000 jobs,"
Interstate/Johnson said.;   Wal-Mart's shares are trading at 34 times the
firm's earnings estimate of $1.40 per share for the year ending January 1992,
and 27 times its projection of $1.75 per share for the next year.;   Although
that puts Wal-Mart at the upper end of valuations compared with the Standard &amp;
Poor's index, it is consistent with the stock's experience over the last five
years.;   Says Interstate/Johnson, "We believe the premium valuation is well
deserved given the company's growth prospects, which are among the most
promising in the retailing industry. Wal-Mart's growth is likely to be
maintained at an annual rate of 25 percent or more for the next several years,
while profitability as measured by return on equity of more than 30 percent is
the highest of any general merchandise retailer in the United States.;   "We
recommend purchase of the shares in growth-oriented accounts. Our 12-month
price target is $60 per share, and we believe significant appreciation
potential exists in future years as well.";   But not everyone thinks Wal-Mart
is the place to be as the market hovers around record highs.;   Dean Witter
analysts say a little caution may be in order and rate the stock no better
than a hold, calling the stock reasonably valued on an absolute price-earnings
and dividend yield basis.;   "We continue to regard Wal-Mart as America's
premier growth retailer. The company's unique culture and significant cost
advantage over its competitors position the chain well for what will most
certainly be a challenging period ahead," Dean Witter said.;   Value Line
gives Wal-Mart its top rating for timeliness and its second highest ranking
for safety, the highest overall ranking for any of the 26 retailers it
covers.;   Value Line estimates the company will earn $1.38 a share this year
and $1.70 in 1992, "although these are likely to prove understated if the
economy picks up enough steam to buoy new employment to the point of loosening
consumer purse strings."  </TEXT>
