   BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc., further
expanding its move into grocery retailing, said it agreed in
principle to acquire closely held Phillips Cos.
   Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed. Phillips, also
based in Bentonville, operates 17 discount food stores and
three conventional supermarkets in the Arkansas area and will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Wal-Mart.

   Wal-Mart has been moving into grocery retailing in recent
years, most recently opening Wal-Mart Supercenters that
combine traditional Wal-Mart discount-store merchandise with
a grocery store. The company currently has six such stores
and plans to open nine more. In addition, Wal-Mart last year
purchased McLane Co., a wholesaler specializing in candy,
tobacco and snack-bar products based in Temple, Texas.
   A Wal-Mart spokesman said it wasn't yet clear whether
Wal-Mart will expand Phillips's grocery business. But he
said, "we're very interested in the employees of Phillips
Cos. and how they can make an immediate contribution" to
Wal-Mart and its supercenters.
   Wal-Mart already is somewhat familiar with Phillips. In
addition to operating nearby, the family interests of
Wal-Mart chairman Sam Walton once owned a stake in Phillips,
but Phillips purchased the stock back in July 1990.
   The discount retailer said the transaction is subject to a
definitive agreement and regulatory approval.
