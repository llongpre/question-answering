   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ordered its
outlets in 26 states Monday to restock Listerine pulled from
shelves over the weekend after a woman said the mouthwash burned
her mouth.
   Officials at Wal-Mart headquarters in Bentonville began
notifying managers of the chain's 1,279 stores to return thousands
of bottles of the mouthwash to shelves after extensive testing by
manufacturer Warner-Lambert Co.
   Warner-Lambert rushed the unused portion of the suspect bottle
through analysis Sunday night at its New Jersey laboratory, and
conducted more tests early Monday. The tests found only normal
product ingredients.
   The mouthwash was removed from Wal-Mart shelves Saturday.
   ``We believed from the beginning this was an isolated incident.
However, we chose not to take any chances,'' said Don Fields,
Wal-Mart's executive vice president for merchandising. ``The safety
and well-being of our customers come first.''
   Listerine was expected to be back on the shelves of all Wal-Mart
stores by Monday night, said company spokesman Don Shinkle.
   Wal-Mart officials have not determined how much removing the
mouthwash had cost the company, Shinkle said. He said no one was
second-guessing the decision to do so.
   ``We stand by our decision and feel it was the thing to do,''
Shinkle said. ``Our customers would more than agree with that.''
   The woman, whom company officials have declined to identify,
complained Saturday that her mouth was red and irritated after
using Listerine she bought at a Wal-Mart Store in Rogers, Ark. She
sought treatment from a dentist and ``is fine,'' Shinkle said.
   Barry S. Cohen, a spokesman for Warner-Lambert in Morris Plains,
N.J., said no other problems had been reported with Listerine,
which is made at a plant in Lititz, Pa.
   ``It's a 125-year-old product. It's shipped around the country.
If there's some problem with the product we would have received
other calls, but we haven't,'' Cohen said.
   No ingredient in Listerine would cause burns, even when mixed in
excessive amounts, Cohen said. The mouthwash is marketed as an
antiseptic, however, and can cause an astringent, tingly sensation.
   Wal-Mart has stores in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico,
North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,
Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
