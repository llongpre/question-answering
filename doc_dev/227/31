   Sporting his traditional Wal-Mart cap
and a red, white and blue employee badge bearing the name ``Sam,''
the founder of the Wal-Mart discount chain on Wednesday reopened
the 5&amp;10 store that started it all.
   Sam Walton held court from a flatbed trailer stage in a steady
drizzle to formally open the Wal-Mart Visitor Center in the same
building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for
business on May 9, 1950.
   ``I bird-hunt in the rain,'' Walton said when offered an
umbrella. ``I don't need that thing.''
   Aided by displays and audio-video presentations, the center
chronicles the rise of the fast-growing chain, now the nation's
second-largest discount retailer after K mart Corp., from its
beginnings as a small rural shop. The first Wal-Mart Discount City
opened in 1962.
   The window displays date back to the store's opening, with
Simplicity patterns and Johnson's Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and some
Ivory Snow. Inside, an electronic map details the company's current
1,500-plus store chain.
   Also on display is the hula skirt Sam Walton donned for his
``dance on Wall Street,'' which he performed after the company met
his challenge to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit in 1984.
   The ceremony, which attracted about 400 people and included a
keynote address by Gov. Bill Clinton, lasted less than 45 minutes
after Walton admonished master of ceremonies Don Soderquist,
Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, to hurry things up.
   ``We've always been lucky about rain _ it hardly ever rains at
any other function we've every planned, but today of all days ...
How can you trim this thing down?'' Walton asked.
   Most of the speakers were Walton family members or Wal-Mart
associates who concentrated on the company's history.
   Sam Walton said Wal-Mart's growth was beyond anything he
expected when he opened his five-and-dime.
   ``What 40 years have brought us, we never could have dreamed,''
he said, noting that he purchased the five-and-dime for $16,000
when it was doing $32,000 annually in sales. ``Helen and I were out
of debt _ we'd made a little money in Newport (the site of his
first retail store), and we were out of debt for about six months''
when the expansions that grew into Wal-Mart began.
   He told of taking his wife and four children on scouting trips
to potential store sites, when ``the kids would start chanting,
``Dad, no more store looking.''
   The expansion could never have occurred, he said, if his
Bentonville store had not been profitable.
