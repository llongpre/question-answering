   Sam Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart
discount chain, has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatment
for a malignant bone marrow disease, Walton said in a memo
distributed Wednesday to Wal-Mart employees.
   In the two-page memo, Walton, 71, said he had been undergoing
treatment at M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston for multiple
myeloma, which he described as a bone disease. Myeloma is a
malignant tumor of the bone marrow, consisting generally of
abnormal plasma cells.
   Since Sunday, Walton said, he had undergone two chemotherapy
treatments and radiation treatment. Don Shinkle, a Wal-Mart Stores
spokesman, said Walton wrote in the memo that he feels much better
after experiencing aches and pains the past several months.
   Shortly after noon Wednesday, Walton visited one of the
company's stores, a Sam's Wholesale Club, in Houston, Shinkle said.
   According to Shinkle, Walton said in the memo that he may be
slowed down for a few weeks, but that he expects to resume visiting
other stores in a few weeks.
   ``Along with Mr. Sam's doctors, we are very encouraged that
because of early detection and treatment a full recovery is
expected,'' the company said in a statement released by Shinkle
from corporate headquarters here.
   Walton's memo outlined Wal-Mart accomplishments during the
1980s, said the employees were responsible for those
accomplishments and that he looked forward to more success.
   Shinkle declined to provide a copy of the memo, saying it was
personal.
