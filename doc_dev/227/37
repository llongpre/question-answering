   The large discount chain Wal-Mart Stores Inc. on Tuesday said
its third-quarter profit climbed 29 percent, boosted by strong
sales growth.
   Specialty apparel retailer Limited Inc. posted a 21 percent gain
in its third-quarter income on a 10 percent increase in sales.
   Wal-Mart, the country's third largest retailer, announced its
after-tax earnings rose to $232.7 million, or 41 cents a share, in
the three months ended Oct. 31 from $180.9 million, or 32 cents a
share, in 1988's third quarter.
   Sales at the stores Wal-Mart operates in 27 states totaled $6.28
billion in the third quarter, up from $4.99 billion a year earlier.
   At the end of the quarter, the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer
had 1,347 Wal-Mart stores, 118 Sam's Wholesale Clubs, 14 dot
Discount Drug stores and three Hypermart USA units. Wal-Mart ranks
third in terms of sales after industry leader Sears, Roebuck and
Co. and No.2 K mart Corp.
   David Glass, president and chief executive officer, said
Wal-Mart's third-quarter performance reflects attention to customer
service, disciplined inventory management and merchandising
programs.
   ``We expect the fourth quarter to be highly competitive but
believe our inventory levels, our associates' involvement and
continued efforts at exceeding our customers' expectations will
enable us to meet our goals and objectives,'' Glass said in a news
release.
   For the first nine months of Wal-Mart's financial year, income
rose 26 percent to $650.04 million, or $1.15 a share, from $514.04
million, or 91 cents a share, through three quarters of 1988.
   Nine-month sales amounted to $17.7 billion, up 25 percent from
$14.12 billion during the comparable portion of 1988.
   Separately, Limited said its net income rose to $84.9 million,
or 47 cents a share, in the three months ended Oct. 28 frm $70.4
million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew to $1.11
billion from $1.01 billion.
   Leslie H. Waxner, chairman and chief executive officer, said
Limited pursued a cautious strategy during the autumn, keeping
inventories below last year's level, on a square foot basis.
   ``My view was that the general economy was softening and lacked
strong consumer demand,'' Waxner said. ``I believe our third
quarter earnings are a reflection of that conservative inventory
position.''
   He said business in the third quarter ``was focused
conservatively on the quality of sales and profitability.''
   Waxner expressed a more upbeat attitude toward the fourth
quarter, which is a crucial time for retailers.
   ``The current success of our merchandising effort and the
acceptance of our fashion direction gives us more optimism as we
enter the fourth quarter,'' Waxner said.
   Retailers pick up about a third of their annual revenues and a
half or more of their yearly profits in the two-month peak holiday
shopping season.
   For the first nine months of this year, Limited's earnings rose
55 percent to $193.8 million, or $1.07 a share, from $124.99
million, or 69 cents a share, the prior year. Nine-month sales rose
13 percent to $3.07 billion from $2.71 billion.
   Limited is one of the country's leading specialty apparel chains
with 3,120 stores. Stores owned by the Columbus, Ohio-based company
include The Limited, Express, Henri Bendel, Victoria's Secret,
Lerner, Lane Bryant and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.
