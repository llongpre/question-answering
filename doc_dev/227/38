   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it was laying off as many as
1,200 workers in what a spokesman called a "normal adjustment
to market conditions."
   The cuts are being made in Sam's Clubs, the company's
highly successful, discount warehouse retailing operation.
About 25 jobs were cut at Sam's headquarters, with the
remaining layoffs spread out among the division's 192
outlets, the spokesman said.

   The spokesman said the cuts weren't a response to the weak
economy, but an attempt to match costs with revenue in a
division built on discount pricing. He pointed out that since
Jan. 1, Wal-Mart, a Bentonville, Ark., retailer, has added
24,000 jobs corporatewide through new store openings,
bringing total employment to 367,000.
