WAL-MART Stores, the largest US retailer in terms of sales, yesterday
unveiled a 21.5 per cent increase in second-quarter profits after tax, to
Dollars 420.4m. The advance came on the back of a 26 per cent sales rise, to
Dollars 13bn, writes Nikki Tait.
The second-quarter results take Wal-Mart's profits for the first six months,
to end-July, to Dollars 807.4m, up from Dollars 652.8m a year earlier. Sales
increased from Dollars 19.6bn to Dollars 24.7bn.
Earnings per share were up from 30 cents to 37 cents in the second quarter,
and from 57 cents to 70 cents in the first half. The group's shares rose
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 57 1/2 on the news.
Part of the advance comes from Wal-Mart's highly aggressive expansion
programme. In the second quarter alone, the discount retailer opened 20 new
Wal-Mart stores and 18 Sam's Clubs - wholesale clubs which sell at
rock-bottom prices to a membership customer base.
By the end of July, the company was operating 1,755 Wal-Mart stores and 233
Sam's Clubs. It covers 44 states, having recently added Idaho.
