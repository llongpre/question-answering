   Maybe it's the immaculate rows of
discounted shampoo and paper towels, or the doorside hand-pumping
``people greeters'' who make visitors feel like they've entered a
sprawling mom-and-pop corner store.
   If the 97,000-square foot Waxahachie Wal-Mart is any indication
of the discount chain's operations in 26 states, it's not hard to
see why Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has staked a claim as the country's
dominant retailer, pleasing customers and sending nervous ripples
into the boardrooms of competitors.
   ``As for Wal-Mart becoming a household word, we never think about
things like that,'' David Glass, president and chief operating
officer, said in a telephone interview from company headquarters in
Bentonville, Ark. ``What we want is for customers in our territories
to think of us fondly.''
   Local shopkeepers as well as giants like Sears, Roebuck and Co.
are watching Wal-Marts spurt like weeds and wondering whether some
of their business could be choked by a rival that religiously
pursues its corporate strategy with the fervor of a rural evangelist.
   Wal-Mart took root when Sam Walton and his brother Bud founded
the first Wal-Mart Discount City in Rogers, Ark. in 1962.
   Under Sam Walton, the company expanded in the 1970s and 1980s,
making his family worth billions and vaulting Wal-Mart to the
third-biggest U.S. retailer behind No.1 Sears and second-ranked K
mart Corp.
   At 70, Sam Walton remains involved. He has retained the title of
chairman although the company's day-to-day operations are handled by
Glass, 53.
   A visitor to a Wal-Mart immediately senses workers are aiming to
foster a friendly image, as though trying to preserve the charm
historically associated with the neighborhood shops that many retail
chains now threaten.
   When customers step inside an official greeter, sometimes in the
form of a hand-clasping retiree, ushers them in, offering advice or
just a ``how-do-you-do.''
   Regular Wal-Mart stores attempt to provide one-stop shopping for
consumers, stocking basic neccesities ranging from shoes and clothes
to televisions and outdoor grills.
   Three Wal-Mart supercenters and three hypermarts, marketing
experiments that are attracting hordes of customers, offer a wider
array of merchandise, such as full grocery lines.
   Within the Wal-Mart in Waxahachie, a community about 25 miles
south of Dallas, everything appears tidy with merchandise in its
proper place, typical of Wal-Marts elsewhere.
   Workers known as ``associates'' in the corporate patois, patrol
the floor, retrieving hangers, unwanted items and the clutter that
bargain-hunters sometimes leave behind.
   One of Waxahachie's assistant managers, Millie Wall, says
Wal-Mart encourages associates to be helpful. ``It might be beyond
what other discount stores do but I don't think it's beyond
Wal-Mart,'' she says.
   What really draws customers, though, is price.
   ``You can find the same stuff at Wal-Mart that you can find at
other stores but cheaper,'' says Wal-Mart regular Cheryl Starks
while lunching with three of her four children at a McDonald's near
the Wal-Mart in the east Texas town of Gilmer. ``The clothes we have
on came from Wal-Mart, the shoes we have on came from Wal-Mart.''
   In the Wal-Mart she frequents, a 16 ounce bottle of Suave balsam
and protein shampoo was selling for $1.08 while the supermarket a
few doors away in the same mall offered the same for $1.69. Four
rolls of Charmin toilet tissue went for 96 cents in Wal-Mart vs.
$1.45 at the supermarket. Bounty designer kitchen towels were 78
cents in Wal-Mart and $1.07 in the store nearby.
   Wal-Mart's flag-waving patriotism also seems to have struck a
responsive chord in the small towns and cities in the heartland,
where the chain has multiplied. Anecdotal evidence suggests the
company has won customers through publicity programs such as its
``Buy American'' pitch.
   If there's one big criticism, it's that local merchants _
especially small shops that can't buy in the volume that allows
Wal-Mart to keep prices low _ get blown away when Wal-Marts move in.
   Kenneth E. Stone, an economics professor at Iowa State
University, looked into the impact of Wal-Marts after chambers of
commerce and business people expressed concern about the
consequences of new Wal-Marts in their areas.
   Stone's conclusions were mixed. Retail trade will expand,
boosting business for some local merchants but causing others to
lose sales, he found.
   The bottom line, Stone's study shows, is that a strategy should
be developed ``for existing merchants so that they may better
co-exist in a Wal-Mart environment.''
   Glass concedes Wal-Marts can make big economic waves. He says
some businesses may flee from their competitive might, but overall,
the chain tends to benefit areas by drawing customers to many stores.
   ``In the aggregate, I would argue that we have a good impact on a
community by making it a trade center, a place where people come to
shop,'' he says.
   Wall Streeters praise Wal-Mart, especially the chain's
application of computer technology to most routine retailing tasks,
including inventory control.
   The past decade is the best evidence of Wal-Mart's phenomenal
growth. As of Jan. 31, the company ran 1,259 Wal-Mart stores, 105
Sam's Wholesale Clubs _ outlets for shoppers buying in bulk _ and
about two dozen other retail operations. At the start of 1979,
Wal-Mart ran 276 stores.
   This year, the company plans to open 155 Wal-Marts and 20
wholesale clubs. The opening of new stores has helped maintain
momentum in sales growth, which was 29 percent in 1988 when sales
rose to $20.65 billion from $15.96 billion.
   Earnings last year totaled $837 million, or $1.48 a share, vs.
$628 million or $1.11 a share a year earlier.
   The company's ambitious plans have expanded to the concept of
supercenters and hypermarts, which are huge mega-merchandizing
emporia with everything from groceries to computer software under
one roof.
   Judging from Wal-Mart's stock market performance, the company has
faithful followers. One analyst estimates the price of a Wal-Mart
share will rise to $49 this year from about $32 recently.
   On the cost side, the corporation is known for dealing shrewdly
with suppliers for the best possible price. Its operating expenses,
as a proportion of sales, are the lowest industrywide.
   In a recent report on the company, Walter F. Loeb of Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. had nothing bad to say.
   ``The customer is key to the success of Wal-Mart. Management is
insisting that every customer be treated as a guest in Wal-Mart
stores,'' Loeb wrote.
   ``This unique attitude is producing a strong response from
consumers since service with a smile is often a forgotten commodity
in retailing.''
