Is Buffeted by Fears of Slower Sales Growth

   Wal-Mart Stores is one of the tallest trees left standing since the market hurricane toppled many others like Limited and Gap, which had been growing to the sky. 

   Limited and Gap have fallen 65% and 75% from their 1987 peaks, and both sell at discounts to the price-earnings ratio of 14 times estimated 1987 earnings for the 500 stocks in Standard &amp; Poor's index. 

   Wal-Mart, down only 42%, still sells at a fat premium of 23 times earnings, as a result of its track record for growth and its status as a heartland discounter of blue-collar goods. 
This is the opposite of a Tiffany or Neiman-Marcus whose sales to yuppies might take a hit after the stock market crash. 

   But Wal-Mart was shaken to its roots last week after officials of the Bentonville, Ark.-based discount retailer told analysts that one key measure of sales growth was falling short of expectations in November. 
As analyst Martha Kimball of Wertheim Schroder relayed the news, sales for stores over a year old, which Wal-Mart had expected to increase 8% to 9%, may actually grow only 4% to 6%. 

   This shocked some investors who are watching for any hint of how bad the crash will hurt consumer spending. 
"Retailers are normally under a magnifying glass. 
This time they're under a microscope," says Francis Rienhoff, who follows retail stocks for T. Rowe Price. 

   Wal-Mart stock fell 1 1/4 to 25 3/4 Tuesday on volume of 1.4 million shares. 
It was the second-most-active stock on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, as 2.5 million shares traded at lower levels and Wal-Mart slipped another 3/8. 
On Friday, Wal-Mart fell 3/8 more to close at 25. 

   "This is a stock that people are ready to pull the trigger on if they see that there's any problem," observed Mark Cunneen, who follows retailers at Massachusetts Financial Services, a Boston mutual fund complex. 

   Some analysts have already fired. 
"We've been advising our clients to reduce holdings in the stock due to priciness," says Robert Buchanan of L.F. Rothschild. 
"The retail group has been creamed since the end of August amid doubts about consumer spending. 
And here sits Wal-Mart, the third-largest retailer, which hasn't been hit as much as the group." 

   Jeffrey Edelman of Drexel Burnham Lambert said the November sales pattern represents a "fairly sharp slowing" from Wal-Mart's 12% year-to-date comparable-store sales growth. 
He has rated the stock as "neutral" out of concern for high-multiple issues in an economic slowdown. 

   Tuesday's stock-price fall was probably steeper because some Wal-Mart phone lines were down that afternoon, and nervous shareholders seeking confirmation and elaboration of the analysts' calls couldn't get through. 

   But on Wednesday, some friendlier analysts at Goldman Sachs and Smith Barney went to bat for the company, and officials insisted there was no cause for alarm, considering Wal-Mart's 10-year record of 39% annual sales growth and 40% profit gains. 

   "A few of the new analysts who follow us said single-digit increases for Wal-Mart are a terrible, tragic change. 
But our profitability is as good as it's ever been," said Jack Shewmaker, vice chairman of the retailer. 
"To take a two or three-week period and extrapolate that into some kind of reversal for Wal-Mart is irresponsible." 

   Mr. Shewmaker said Wal-Mart's November promotional circulars were mailed out a week later this year than in 1986, leading to "a disparity in sales earlier in the month" that Wal-Mart has already begun to make up. 
He added that cold weather has come late to Wal-Mart's southeastern U.S. stronghold, hurting sales of wintertime items. 

   Despite the "economic uncertainty" and the postponement of some Christmas purchases, Mr. Shewmaker said, last week's sales re-accelerated to show "strong double-digit" comparable-store sales growth. 
In October, Wal-Mart's growth dwarfed other retailers', with a 40% sales increase and same-store sales up 14%. 

   Many analysts believe the real test didn't begin until Thanksgiving, start of prime holiday selling. 
"I just don't understand how (the early November results) could be meaningful," said Marion Schultheis of IDS Financial Services. 
Ms. Kimball of Wertheim notes the company still believes it can achieve 8% to 9% same-store sales growth for the quarter ending January 1988. 

   Beyond the shaky economy, Wal-Mart still faces questions about its long-term growth prospects at current annual revenues of $16 billion or so. 
After all, founder and Chairman Sam Walton is already twice as rich as anyone else in the U.S. 

   But as First Boston analyst Margaret Gilliam noted in a "strong buy" recommendation Nov. 12, when the stock was at 28 1/2, Wal-Mart still has only a 1% share of all U.S. retail sales and operates in only 24 states. 
She said its "potential to increase its share of personal-consumption expenditures is enormous."
