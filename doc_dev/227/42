   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has launched a
program aimed at reducing the amount of imported products in the
inventory of its discount store chain.
   Company officials will prepare a list of imports ``and all those
items with be fair game'' if the company opts to go with United
States manufacturers, according to Joe Chappelle, director of
Wal-Mart's newly-created USA Division.
   Chappelle said the Bentonville-based company, the nation's
third-largest general retailer after Sears, Roebuck and Co. and K
mart Corp., would ask for help from state industrial development
organizations in enlisting domestic manufacturers for the program.
   He said the company would provide the agencies with a list of
imported products sold at its stores, specifications on the
products and other information that will help them put Wal-Mart and
interested manufacturers in touch with each other.
   Chappelle said Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton was ``deeply
committed to the Buy America program,'' and that the company was
willing to take the risk of product specifications falling onto the
hands of competitors.
   The company has no idea how many imported products will be
replaced by domestic ones, and products will be studied on a
case-by case basis. No time frame was given for the program.
   Conversion of some labor-intensive products may be a problem
because of the difference in wages paid in the United States and
some foreign countries, Chappelle said.
   ``I'm not saying that it's impossible to convert labor-intensive
items because it may be that you would wind up getting more
value,'' he said.
   Chappelle also said small manufacturers should not shy away from
the program because of Wal-Mart's giant volume requirements.
   ``The volume can be shocking, but if a manufacturer only wants
to bid on a certain quantity, he can do that. He can get any part
of the pie he wants,'' he said.
   Wal-Mart stockholders are to discuss the program at a meeting
next month. A preview was given Friday in Stuttgart for
participants in the LeadAR program, an agricultural and rural
leadership development program sponsored by the University of
Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service.
