   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Bentonville, Ark., said its net
income increased 13% for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan.
31 to $481.8 million, or 42 cents a share, from $425.9
million, or 38 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
   Despite the increase, the discounter's results
disappointed the market. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, Wal-Mart's stock dropped $1.25 to close at
$35.375.

   "It was a tough quarter," said Robert Buchanan, analyst at
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons. Mr. Buchanan said that Wal-Mart's
expenses were up for the period, at least in part because it
opened 72 Wal-Mart stores during the quarter, out of 176 for
the year. The company opened just 56 stores in the
year-earlier period.
   Sales for the quarter rose 28% to $10.36 billion from
$8.11 billion last year.
   For the year, Wal-Mart said it had net income of $1.29
billion, or $1.14 a share, up 20% from $1.08 billion, or 95
cents a share, last year. Sales were $32.6 billion, up 26%
from $25.81 billion in fiscal 1990.
   Despite the lower than hoped for quarterly results, Mr.
Buchanan said he still is expecting a strong year ahead as
Wal-Mart takes advantage of its low prices to attract
shoppers in a recession. He said he is predicting the company
will earn $1.40 a share in fiscal 1992.
