WAL-MART Stores, the Arkansas-based discount stores chain which is now the
world's largest retailer in sales terms, yesterday disclosed a 34.6 per cent
jump in turnover last year to Dollars 43.9bn and a 24.6 per cent increase in
net profits to Dollars 1.6bn from Dollars 1.29bn.
At the earnings per share level, Wal-Mart reported a 22.8 per cent
improvement, to Dollars 1.40.
Wal-Mart's figures contrast sharply with those delivered by many US
retailers - in particular, the traditional department stores - who have been
badly affected by the grim economic climate and the general slump in
consumer spending.
Growth during the fourth quarter was roughly in line with that for the year.
Sales in the three months to end-January totalled Dollars 13.6bn, up from
Dollars 10.4bn in the same period a year earlier.
Net profits rose 25 per cent to Dollars 602.4m and earnings per share rose
to 52 cents from 42 cents.
In part, Wal-Mart's sales growth stems from a ferocious store expansion
programme. In the fourth quarter, for example, it opened 68 new Wal-Mart
stores, which sell low-priced general merchandise, and 15 Sam's Clubs.
Sam's Clubs are warehouse club operations, sited in out-of-town 'barns' and
selling a limited range of goods at deeply-discounted prices to a membership
customer base. Wal-Mart is the biggest operator in this fast-growing market
niche.
However, for much of last year, the group also posted double-digit
'same-store' sales growth.
The results for 1991-2 were scored after interest charges of Dollars 113.3m,
more than double the Dollars 42.7m in 1990-91. The increase in total costs
and expenses also slightly exceeded sales growth - rising by 35.4 per cent
to Dollars 41.7bn.
The results were much as analysts had expected, however, and shares in
Wal-Mart - which has grown from one 'five and dime' store 40 years ago to
overtake Kmart and Sears Roebuck as the nation's largest retailer - rose
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 53 7/8.
