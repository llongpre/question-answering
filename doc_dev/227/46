America's discount retail group, sustain its explosive growth?

At 8.30 on a cold winter's morning in Dover, Delaware, employees of a new
114,000 sq ft Wal-Mart store are whooping and hollering. 'Give me a W,'
shouts a store manager, leading the pre-opening ceremony. 'W,' yells the
throng of shop assistants. 'Give me an A,' . . . and so on.
Outside, the locals press against the glass and debate what effect the
arrival of America's most successful discount retailer will have on their
town. 'Tough on Ames,' mutters one lady, referring to a rival general
merchandise retailer which has already filed for bankruptcy. Sure enough,
100 yards down the road, Ames has sparsely stocked shelves and only four
customers.
Already an aggressive store expansion programme has taken Wal-Mart's sales
from Dollars 2.44bn in 1982 to almost Dollars 44bn last year - making it the
world's largest retailer in turnover terms. Last week it reported a 24.6 per
cent increase in profits in 1991 over 1990 to Dollars 1.6bn. Now Wal-Mart,
which sells goods from detergents to golf clubs, is muscling into food
retailing and experimenting with own-label. It is also engaging in a row
with trade representatives, and offering suppliers a direct computer link to
individual stores to cut lead supply times.
In so doing, the group is starting to lay down rules for the retail sector
in a way that no US chain has done before. 'Wal-Mart is the biggest single
influence in US retailing,' says Ms Dorothy Lakner, an analyst with
Oppenheimer, the US financial services group.
Perhaps not just in the US. Retailing does not cross national boundaries
easily, but ideas do get swapped. The international spread of discount (or
'value') shopping, for example, is evident in the arrival of Germany's Aldi
group and the Danish Netto chain in the UK.
Wal-Mart's position today is all the more impressive when put in
perspective. In 1950, Mr Sam Walton, a former trainee with the J C Penney
retail group, lost the lease on a Ben Franklin-franchised variety store in
Newport, Arkansas. After complex negotiating, he secured a new property in
the tiny northern Arkansas town of Bentonville. Here, he opened the first
Walton's 5 &amp; 10, a small general goods store.
Forty years later, Bentonville is still the headquarters for more than 1,700
Wal-Mart stores, about 208 Sam's Warehouse Clubs and four hypermarkets.
These are served by 20 distribution centres, employ 365,000 people, and
capital expenditure runs at more than Dollars 2bn a year. Mr Walton, now 73,
and his four children ranked third last year in Fortune's list of the 500
richest Americans.
For years, observers have tried to define the ingredients of this success.
Their answers usually mention Wal-Mart's traditional small-town base - where
land costs are low, and shrinkage (or 'lost' stocks) and other operational
problems are more manageable.
Then there is the meticulous attention to cost, and the fact that prices
are, indeed, kept very low. (In Dover, a quart of bleach costs 89 cents in
Wal-Mart and Dollars 1.14 at Ames.) This is partly because Wal-Mart's staff
is non-unionised, and 40 per cent work part-time, saving the company
insurance and holiday expenses, while executives occupy shoe box offices.
Success is also attributed to the company's willingness to innovate or, at
least, to poach successful ideas. Warehouse clubs are a good example. These
barns, which sell a limited range of goods at wholesale prices to
'membership' customers, were developed by a Californian retailer in the
mid-1970s. Wal-Mart latched on to the notion within a decade - well before
competitors like K mart, which subsequently bought the PACE club chain.
Not all schemes work so well. Wal-Mart borrowed the hypermarket concept from
Europe, and built four - all at least 220,000 square feet. Now it says they
are too large to manage efficiently, and will not add more.
But whatever the key to Wal-Mart's past success, the question is whether the
group can sustain its explosive growth, as competition grows from the likes
of Dayton Hudson's Target chain and K mart.
The first expansion route is geographical. Wal-Mart is concentrated in the
south and mid-west, only recently tackling the north-east and west and
taking tentative steps into Mexico. 'There's so much opportunity out there,'
says Mr David Glass, Wal-Mart's chief executive. 'We have gone from Dollars
32.6bn in sales in 1990-91 to almost Dollars 44bn last year, and I can
envisage us layering on Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn this year.'
One potential problem with this strategy is that it may raise costs. 'If
they want to go after the New York, Los Angeles or Chicago markets, it's a
different ball-game,' says Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Heinz, a Wal-Mart
supplier. 'Real estate becomes expensive and there are all sorts of union
problems.' Used to hearing such concerns, Mr Glass shakes his head, pointing
out that Wal-Mart already has stores around Houston, Dallas, and even in
Chicago's suburbs.
As well as new sites, however, Wal-Mart's long-term plans depend on new
product areas - notably food retailing. Sam's Clubs have already taken the
Wal-Mart group into bulk food items in a big way. But now the company is
experimenting with 'supercentres', which combine supermarket facilities with
general merchandise. It plans to double the number to about 20 this year.
Manufacturers, meanwhile, may have shuddered at Wal-Mart's experiments in
selling colas, cookies and snacks under the Sam's Choice name. In general,
US shoppers view own-label products as cheap but inferior - giving brand
manufacturers considerable clout. But Sam Walton is a household name, and
Sam's Choice may convey more sense of quality.
Wal-Mart itself is ambivalent about the potential. '(The targeted own-label
segments) are generally difficult products to merchandise,' says Mr Glass.
'You buy soft drinks regionally, you buy them at all kinds of prices. Other
categories are simply those where there has been a big increase in brand
prices, and you're getting consumer resistance.'
So is Wal-Mart saying that when suppliers fail to meet its requirements, it
will crack the whip by introducing competing own-label products? 'Oh no;'
Wal-Mart's chief executive looks pained. 'We wouldn't do that - we believe
we are partners with our suppliers.'
But underlying such expansion tactics is a more fundamental question. How
far can any retailer grow before operations become unmanageable and
standards slip?
It is a conundrum to which no one has an answer. Wal-Mart has surpassed K
mart and Sears Roebuck, which seemed to stall when their merchandise sales
reached some Dollars 30bn during the 1980s. Asked about estimates that
Wal-Mart could see annual sales of Dollars 100bn this century, Mr Glass says
this is 'do-able'. 'But that's a pretty ambitious plan,' he adds quickly,
'because no retailer has ever done Dollars 100bn before, and I'm not sure
that any of us know what you'd have to do to be able to achieve it.'
Retail analysts suggest that part of the answer may lie in technology, and
Wal-Mart seems to agree. It makes much of the 'retail link' scheme, which
plugs suppliers into point-of-sale data in individual stores. Although only
a fifth of its 5,000 vendors have been persuaded to invest so far, overall
average lead times are said to have fallen from double figures a year ago,
to nine days.
The retailer also suggests that increased efficiency is the reason for a
recent move to eliminate manufacturers' representatives, the traditional
middlemen, from negotiations with suppliers. 'If you have a manufacturer and
you do Dollars 50m with him one year, and say you'll probably do Dollars
100m next . . . many of them have trouble relating to that,' says Mr Glass.
'Where you have a third party involved it becomes particularly difficult.'
The representatives, for their part, protest that they are essential to
small manufacturers, and have tried to take the matter to the Federal Trade
Commission, the US competition watchdog. They also hint that Wal-Mart's real
aim is better terms from manufacturers.
Whatever the merits of the argument, most observers suspect that the
discount chain will win - at least, where larger suppliers are concerned.
Already, Procter &amp; Gamble, probably Wal-Mart's largest supplier, is reported
to have a team living in Bentonville.
And if anyone doubts the seriousness of Wal-Mart's ambitions, they should
visit its computer room. 'I don't think many people know this exists,'
confesses one employee, opening the door on a room the size of a football
pitch. Bentonville may just have seen the future.
