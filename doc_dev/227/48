   For Wal-Mart Stores Inc., it's one down
and one to go.
   The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer slipped past Kmart in
November to become America's No. 2 retailer, according to sales
figures released this week. Now, industry analysts say that early
next year Wal-Mart will overtake Sears, Roebuck and Co. as the
nation's top retailer.
   Even Sears is conceding defeat.
   ``In terms of dollar signs, they will surpass us. There's no
doubt about it,'' Gordon Jones, a Sears spokesman, said Friday.
   The figures showed Chicago-based Sears with $27.48 billion in
sales for the first 10 months of 1990. Wal-Mart sales for the same
period were $25.46 billion. But Wal-Mart's growth rate was 25
percent, while Sears grew at just 2.1 percent.
   Kmart's sales for the first 10 months of the year totaled $25.2
billion.
   Analysts say Wal-Mart's strong growth rate will allow the
discount retailer to bump Sears for the No. 1 spot.
   Wal-Mart probably will fall $500 million or $1 billion short of
Sears by Jan. 31, the close of Wal-Mart's fiscal year, said Stacy
Dutton, an analyst with Morgan Stanley and Co. in New York.
   ``But then next year, it's all Wal-Mart,'' Ms. Dutton predicted.
   Sears will have about $32.5 billion in revenues from domestic
and foreign merchandising and credit for this current fiscal year,
she said. Wal-Mart will total about $31.5 billion to $32 billion
this fiscal year, she said.
   ``It will be real close, but clearly next year, Wal-Mart will
surpass Sears, especially with the acquisitions they've made,''
said Craig Weichmann, an analyst with Morgan Keegan and Co. in
Memphis.
   Last month Wal-Mart announced it planned to buy The Wholesale
Club Inc. In October it said it would acquire McLane Co. Inc., the
country's sixth-largest grocery distributor.
   Wal-Mart officially passed Kmart as the No. 2 retailer in the
country in November, with $25.46 billion in sales for 10 months
compared with Kmart's $25.2 billion.
