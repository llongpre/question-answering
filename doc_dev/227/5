   In the Wal-Mart parking lot, a car radio
plays a country ballad about a relaxed, ``porch swing state of
mind.'' Outside the store's entrance, a vendor sells corn dogs and
cold soda.
   Nearby, a woman gently coaxes her young daughter into getting off
the small merry-go-round; two rides are enough, she says, ``Mommy's
got to go shopping now.''
   Reluctantly, the little girl dismounts and tags along into the
store. Her pout gives way to a grin as a smiling woman greets the
child with a ``Hi honey!'' while fixing a happy-face sticker on her
hand.
   Anyone entering the Wal-Mart in this east Texas town _ and
Wal-Marts elsewhere _ encounters such a person. The people greeters
welcome shoppers, give advice on where to find things and mark
merchandise carried in for returns or exchanges.
   On the way out of some Wal-Marts, exit greeters thank people for
coming while keeping an eye out for receipts to make sure people
aren't shoplifting.
   The people-greeting practice is one of many ingredients in
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s highly successful retailing recipe.
   Staffing entrances and exits is not unheard of at other
retailers, particularly at discounters that have heavy traffic. What
sets Wal-Marts appart is the way they handle the task.
   Customers in some high-volume stores feel bullied by employees
demanding that they reveal the contents of parcels, for instance.
Not in Wal-Marts.
   Wal-Mart ``associates,'' the term the company has substituted for
employees, give the impression that the security element of
people-greeting is secondary to acting like a friendly host or
hostess. They appear to genuinely enjoy passing the time with
patrons.
   ``I get to see everybody who comes to Wal-Mart and everybody in
Upshur County comes to Wal-Mart sooner or later,'' says Peggy Smith
while on duty at the entrance of the Gilmer Wal-Mart.
   Smith, a 39-year-old Gilmer resident who won an award for being
the most courteous employee in the county in February, speaks
proudly about working at Wal-Mart.
   She's grateful to have the job. Other people living in the area
of Gilmer, a town of an estimated 6,500 people about 120 miles east
of Dallas and the Upshur County seat, are less fortunate due to deep
staff cuts at a local steel mill and the prolonged slump in the
state's oil industry.
   Wal-Mart store managers say not all associates are suited for
people-greeting duty. Besides friendliness and maturity, useful
personality traits are patience and perhaps a touch of
inquisitiveness, some say.
   Retirees supplementing their fixed incomes are frequently found
doing stints on Wal-Mart's hospitality patrol.
   One of them, 68-year-old Jack Butler, says being a people greeter
at the Wal-Mart in Duncanville, Texas, fits his needs fine. After
20{ years working in the warehouse of a tractor company, he enjoys
less physically-demanding work.
   Deploying someone at Wal-Mart doors originated with one of the
hourly associates. Sam Walton, company founder and chairman, liked
the suggestion and it became a company-wide practice.
