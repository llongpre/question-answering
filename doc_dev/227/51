Stores

Store openings and a large increase in revenues helped Wal-Mart Stores, the
US discount store group, increase net income by 13 per cent to a record
Dollars 588m in its third quarter to October from Dollars 519m for the same
period last year.
Revenues shot up 21 per cent to Dollars 20.4bn, reflecting new store
openings and recent acquisitions. But profits lagged the growth in turnover
because much of the increase came from the recent acquisition of the
loss-making Pace Membership Warehouse chain from Kmart and the Woolco chain
from Woolworth Canada.
Earnings per share rose 13 per cent to 26 cents from 23 cents.
At the end of the quarter, the company had 61 more Wal-Mart discount stores
than it had a year earlier, making a total of 1,983. The number of
Supercenters rose by 52 to 119 and the number of Sam's Clubs rose by 75 to
437. The company added 122 Canadian Wal-Mart stores, increased the number of
Mexican stores by 38 to 52, and opened three Value Clubs in Hong Kong.
The Sam's Club membership warehouse operations continued their recent
weakness, with same-store sales falling 0.7 per cent. This was offset by
strong growth in the core Wal-Mart operations which increased same-store
sales 7.4 per cent.
Until recently, Wal-Mart's shareholders had been accustomed to seeing
earnings growth averaging 25 per cent a year, but the company, the world's
biggest retailer, is finding it hard to sustain the momentum.
