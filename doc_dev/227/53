   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it agreed to acquire Super Saver Warehouse Club Inc., a chain of 21 wholesale warehouse clubs. 
Terms weren't disclosed. 

   The acquisition signals the continued consolidation analysts have been expecting among the warehouse clubs, giant no-frills stores that sell a variety of goods at prices near wholesale. 
A number of companies have been opening the stores, but analysts expect only about half a dozen to survive. 

   As reported previously, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets was in the process of trying to take Super Saver public with an initial public offering of 2,750,000 shares, including 750,000 shares to be sold by nonmanagement stockholders. 

   Wal-Mart, a large discount retailer, said it expects to transform the stores, which are about 100,000 square feet, into Sam's Wholesale Club units. 
Wal-Mart currently has 52 Sam's Wholesale Clubs in operation. 

   Wal-Mart said it expects the transaction to be completed in 45 to 60 days.
