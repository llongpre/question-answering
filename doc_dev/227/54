   A federal district judge ordered Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to pay $16.8 million in premiums for workmen's compensation insurance to Transit Casualty Co., Kansas City, Mo. 

   Wal-Mart, a discount retailer, contended its premiums had been limited to $3.5 million a year by an agreement with a Dallas-based insurance agent for Transit Casualty. 
But the court ruled that the premiums Wal-Mart paid were lower than those required by underwriting regulations, which superseded the rates promised by the agreement. 

   Transit, in receivership under insurance laws in Missouri, couldn't be reached for comment. 
In Bentonville, Ark., Wal-Mart officials also couldn't be reached.
