Wal-Mart Stores, the US discount store group and the world's biggest
retailer, its planning to expand into Asia by opening stores in Hong Kong
and China.
The company says it will carry out the expansion through a joint venture
agreement with Ek Chor Distribution System, a Hong Kong company owned by
Charoen Pokphand, the multinational conglomerate and Thailand's biggest
business group.
The joint venture expects to start by opening three or four Value Clubs in
Hong Kong this autumn. At between 10,000 sq ft and 20,000 sq ft per store,
the Value Clubs will be a smaller version of Wal-Mart's membership warehouse
clubs, which operate as Sam's Clubs in the US.
Later, the joint venture plans to enter mainland China with discount stores
and membership warehouse clubs similar to Wal-Mart's US discount stores and
Sam's Clubs.
The move into Asia marks a significant departure for Wal-Mart, as it is the
company's first move outside the Americas, where it has 2,091 Wal-Mart
discount stores, 87 Supercenters (discount stores and supermarkets
combined), and 434 Sam's Clubs.
The company began its expansion outside the US in 1991, when it signed a
joint venture agreement with Cifra, Mexico's largest retailer. In March this
year it acquired 122 Woolco discount stores in Canada from Woolworth, the US
retailer, and started converting them to the Wal-Mart format.
Also in March, Wal-Mart established its first Asian links when it signed a
deal with Ito-Yokado, the Japanese supermarket chain, to start supplying its
own-brand products to the Japanese retailer.
With the US retail market suffering from saturation, Wal-Mart has gone the
way of other large US retailing groups, which are tending to look outside
their domestic market for growth.
