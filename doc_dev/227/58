WAL-MART Stores, the largest US retailer in sales terms, yesterday pleased
investors with news of a 26 per cent increase in first-quarter profits, to
Dollars 387m after tax.
Sales were up by a similar amount, at Dollars 11.7bn, in the three months to
the end of April, helped in part by Wal-Mart's aggressive new stores
programme. During the first quarter alone, it opened 15 new stores; expanded
and relocated another 38; and added seven outlets to its Sam's Clubs chain
of deep-discount wholesale stores.
The net addition of retail space during the first quarter totalled 3.89m sq
ft. The expansion has taken the Wal-Mart chain of discount stores to 1,735
outlets, with a further 215 Sam's Clubs. A year ago, the figures were 1,591
and 178 respectively.
At the earnings-per-share level, Wal-Mart made 34 cents in the first
quarter, compared with 27 cents a year earlier. Its shares gained Dollars 1
to Dollars 53 on the news yesterday.
Mr David Glass, chief executive of the aggressive Arkansas-based group, said
the figures reflected 'excellent cost control and sales that consistently
ran ahead of our plans'.
He suggested the company was 'well-positioned' to meet its sales and
earnings objectives for the rest of the year.
