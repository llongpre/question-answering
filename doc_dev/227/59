WAL-MART Stores, the top-selling retailer in the US, yesterday reported an
18 per cent increase in after-tax profits during the second quarter of 1993,
at Dollars 495.9m.
Earnings per share in the three months to end-July rose from 18 to 22 cents,
while sales were up by 25 per cent at Dollars 16.2bn.
The second-quarter figures brought Wal-Mart's profits for the first half of
the financial year to Dollars 946.5m after tax, compared with Dollars 807.4m
at the same stage in 1992.
Sales for the most recent six months stand at Dollars 30.2bn, against
Dollars 24.7bn in the first half of the previous year.
Yesterday, Mr David Glass, chief executive, said the company was 'on track
to achieve sales and earnings objectives for the balance of the year'.
However, he also conceded the year so far had been 'characterised by
disinflation and consumer caution'.
On Wall Street, the news was greeted without enthusiasm, and Wal-Mart shares
eased Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 25 - near the 52-week low.
The Arkansas-based company - a high-flier in the retail sector for many
years - has faced questions recently over the growth potential for Sam's,
its warehouse club chain, and the fate of its new generation of giant
'combo' stores, which combine food retailing with general merchandise.
In the second quarter, Wal-Mart said it had opened 21 new Wal-Mart stores
and 33 Sam's Clubs (including 14 Pace club stores which were acquired from
Kmart, a rival discount retailer).
Nordstrom, the Seattle-based retailer, disclosed a 2.4 per cent increase in
second-quarter profits after tax, at Dollars 42.7m, although the six-month
figure was down by 14.7 per cent, at Dollars 53.9m. Sales in the period rose
by 6.9 per cent, to Dollars 1.02bn, and for the six months by 6 per cent to
Dollars 1.71bn.
