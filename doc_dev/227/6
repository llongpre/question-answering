In the Wal-Mart parking lot, a car radio plays a country ballad about a 
"porch-swing state of mind." Outside the store's entrance, a vendor sells corn 
dogs and cold sodas. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a woman gently coaxes her young daughter into getting off the small 
merry-go-round; two rides are enough, she says. "Mommy's got to go shopping 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Reluctantly, the little girl dismounts and tags along into the store. Her pout 
gives way to a grin as a smiling woman greets her with "Hi, Honey!" and fixes a 
happy-face sticker on her hand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have Many Functions 
</P>
<P>
Anyone entering the Wal-Mart in this east Texas town -- and Wal-Marts elsewhere 
-- encounters such a person. The people greeters welcome shoppers, give advice 
on where to find things and mark merchandise being carried in for returns or 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
On the way out of some Wal-Marts, exit greeters thank people for coming while 
keeping an eye out for receipts to make sure there is no shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
The people-greeting practice is one of many ingredients in Wal-Mart Stores 
Inc.'s highly successful recipe for retailing. 
</P>
<P>
Staffing entrances and exits is not unheard of at other stores, particularly at 
discount houses with heavy traffic. What sets Wal-Mart's greeters apart is the 
way they handle the task. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Feel Bullied 
</P>
<P>
Customers in some high-volume stores feel bullied when employees demand that 
they reveal the contents of parcels, for instance, but not in Wal-Marts. 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart "associates," as the company calls its employees, give the impression 
that the security element of people-greeting is secondary to being a friendly 
host or hostess. They appear to enjoy passing the time with patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"I get to see everybody who comes to Wal-Mart, and everybody in Upshur County 
comes to Wal-Mart sooner or later," says Peggy Smith, on duty at the entrance 
of the Gilmer Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 39-year-old Gilmer resident who won an award for being the most 
courteous employee in the county in February, speaks proudly about working at 
Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
She's grateful to have the job. Other people around Gilmer, a town of some 
6,500 people about 120 miles east of Dallas and the Upshur County seat, are 
less fortunate, due to deep staff cuts at a local steel mill and the prolonged 
slump in the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not All Are Suited 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart store managers say not all associates are suited to people-greeting 
duty. Besides friendliness and maturity, useful traits are patience and perhaps 
a touch of inquisitiveness, some say. 
</P>
<P>
Retirees supplementing their fixed incomes are frequently found doing stints on 
Wal-Mart's hospitality patrol. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, 68-year-old Jack Butler, says being a people greeter at the 
Wal-Mart in Duncanville, Tex., fits his needs fine. After 20 years working in 
the warehouse of a tractor company, he enjoys having less physically demanding 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of manning Wal-Mart doors came from one of the hourly associates. Sam 
Walton, company founder and chairman, liked the suggestion, and made it a 
company-wide practice.
