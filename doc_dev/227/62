<LEADPARA>  It may not be as hotly debated as who's the top college football team, but
there's some dispute over which company is the No. 1 retailer in the United
States -- Sears or Wal-Mart.;    If you judge by annual sales, Sears is still
the champ. But by other reckonings, the sprawling chain of discount stores
founded by Arkansas salesman Sam Walton has overtaken its 104-year-old rival.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  TIME WILL TELL WHEN WAL-MART IS NO. 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     It's somewhat reminiscent of the recent split between sports writers and
coaches in college football rankings. The writers voted Colorado No. 1 over
Georgia Tech, but the coaches reached the opposite result.;    Who's on top in
retailing depends on how you view their sales figures.;     For instance, Time
magazine and the Chicago Tribune this week compared the sales figures reported
by Sears for the calendar year 1990 and those recorded by Wal-Mart for fiscal
1991, which ran from Feb. 1, 1990, to Jan. 31.;    With Wal-Mart chalking up
$32.6 billion in sales to Sears' $31.99 billion, that put Wal-Mart in the
lead.;    But if you compare the two companies' results over the same time
span, the retailing fiscal year, Sears, which rang up $33.95 billion in sales,
comes out ahead.;    There are other ways to figure the equation.;    Wal-Mart
earlier this month completed the acquisition of the Wholesale Club Inc., which
racked up an estimated $750 million in sales in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31.
If you include those numbers -- which Wal-Mart at this point does not -- then
the discounter takes the mantle.;    Analysts note that Sears includes in its
reports sales from Canadian and Mexican stores. So if you're talking about
U.S. business, Wal-Mart is probably the leader.;    Even if you consider Sears
to be No. 1, the retailer won't be at the top for long. The company's sales
grew at a 1.5 percent rate over the past retailing fiscal year, while
Wal-Mart's business surged 26 percent.;    Wal-Mart's growth rate is expected
to quicken as it absorbs the Wholesale Club and as it continues to open new
stores at a lightning pace.;    It could surpass Sears within a matter of
months by almost any measure.;    Sears continues to struggle with a number of
problems. The company's costs are too high for it to compete with Wal-Mart's
low prices, although Sears is undergoing a major restructuring in hopes of
paring expenses.;    The retailer is also hampered by its image. Analysts say
Sears is a trusted, reliable store, but it doesn't excite consumers the way
the younger Wal-Mart and specialty retailers do.;    Sears is converting its
stores to more of a specialty format, emphasizing its strongest departments
and trying to regain lost business. But with 850 stores to revamp, the process
will take several years.;    In the meantime, Wal-Mart is likely to
outdistance the fallen leader.  </TEXT>
