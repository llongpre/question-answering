   A trade group representing manufacturers' representatives
and manufacturers said it filed a formal complaint with the
Federal Trade Commission against Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
charging that the giant retailer isn't practicing fair trade.
   The Manufacturers' Agents National Association said it
delivered a complaint to Janet D. Steiger, chairman of the
FTC, saying that Wal-Mart's recent decision to ask
manufacturers to bypass their independent sales
representatives will hurt small-and-medium-sized businesses
and may violate antitrust laws.

   Wal-Mart President and Chief Executive Officer David Glass
sent a letter to manufacturers in November asking them to
work directly with the nation's largest retailer, rather than
using independent representatives to peddle their wares for a
commission.
   Federal antitrust laws prohibit companies from seeking
discounts by eliminating a broker's commission.
   The trade group said that since the letter went out, many
manufacturers' representatives have been unable to get
appointments with Wal-Mart buyers. A lawyer for the group
said that Ms. Steiger said her staff will look into the
matter.
   Officials at Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark.,
couldn't be reached for comment.
