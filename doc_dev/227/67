WAL-MART Stores, the Arkansas-based discount retailer which grew from one
five-and-dime store to become the nation's largest store chain, yesterday
announced that sales in the year to end-January jumped by 26 per cent, to
Dollars 55.5bn.
Pre-tax profits rose at a roughly similar rate - up by 24 per cent from
Dollars 2.55bn to Dollars 3.17bn.
At the after-tax level, the 1992-3 figure was Dollars 1.99bn, compared with
Dollars 1.61bn in the previous year, and earnings per share (after a stock
split) rose from 70 cents to 87 cents.
Wal-Mart's annual results came after a strong final quarter, during which
sales increased from Dollars 13.6bn to Dollars 17.1bn, and pre-tax profits
rose from Dollars 956.2m to Dollars 1.19bn.
After-tax profits were Dollars 749.6m, against Dollars 602.4m in the same
period of the previous year.
Wal-Mart's strong sales and profits increase partly reflect the rapid
expansion of the store chain - which now encompasses 1,880 discount stores
and 256 Sam's Clubs.
A year earlier, there were 1,720 Wal-Mart Stores and 208 wholesale clubs.
However, Mr David Glass, Wal-Mart's chief executive, also noted that
'same-store' sales growth - the increase in sales from stores which have
been open for more than a year - also ran at a rate of 11 per cent for the
year overall.
Meanwhile, May Department Stores, one of the nation's largest department
store groups and also the owner of the Payless ShoeSource chain, reported
final-quarter profits of Dollars 513m before tax, up from Dollars 406m in
the same period of 1991-2.
May's sales in the three months to January 30 rose from Dollars 3.08bn to
Dollars 3.39bn, while after-tax profits increased from Dollars 266m to
Dollars 319m.
The fourth-quarter results left May posting net profits of 603m for the
year, compared with Dollars 515m.
Annual sales were up from Dollars 8.15bn to Dollars 8.68bn. The St
Louis-based company said that it was pleased with the results, given what it
described as the 'difficult economy'.
