   Billionaire Sam Walton, who controls
one of the biggest fortunes in America, says he has a better than
even chance of winning his battle with bone cancer.
   Walton, the 71-year-old founder and chairman of Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a form of bone
cancer and is receiving treatment at M.D. Anderson Hospital in
Houston.
   He returned Friday to his home in Bentonville, where Wal-Mart
keekps its corporate offices, to attend weekend meetings.
   He is scheduled to return to Houston on Monday to resume
chemotherapy and radiation treatments on his back and on his bones,
which he said have become soft and developed holes because of the
cancer.
   Walton said the treatments have been effective and that he has
about a 60 percent chance of recovery from the disease.
   ``I'm getting on a lot better,'' he said Friday. ``I've been on
this treatment for about a week and there seems to be definite
improvement in the way I feel and the way I'm walking.''
   If his current therapy regime does not work, he said, he'll have
to take heavier doses of chemotherapy with greater side effects.
``We're trying to do it with a less-type treatment at this point.''
   Walton, known for making surprise visits to stores in his
popular Wal-Mart discount chain and leading employees and customers
in a ``Give me a W, Give me an A...'' cheer, he was grateful for
the cards and prayers of well-wishers.
   ``I'm one of the real fortunate folks who have people believing
in me and wanting to help and I wish it were that way with
everybody,'' he said.
