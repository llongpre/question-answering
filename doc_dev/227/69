   With Wal-Mart Stores Inc. gaining like an
Arkansas rabbit on K mart Corp.'s position as the nation's
second-largest retailer, K mart has decided it's time for a
makeover.
   K mart has been revamping old stores, opening new ones and
trying to update its ``blue light special'' image under a
five-year, $2.3 billion chainwide makeover aimed at fending off
expanding competitors.
   Faced with newer stores by such expanding chains as Wal-Mart,
from Bentonville, Ark., and Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp.'s
Target discount chain, K mart has been trying to rouse customers
with a brighter, higher-intensity atmosphere, expanded product
offerings and new services.
   The stores are moving their usual popcorn and tobacco counters
away from front-and-center, shedding dull linoleum and cluttered
aisles and offering such new products as fax machines to attract
customers.
   ``Retail is energy: their saliva glands are going, their credit
cards are hot,'' said Michael Crosson, an outside designer hired to
help shape the chain's future.
   This isn't goodbye to blue-collar customers who have flocked to
decades of K mart ``blue light specials'' and ``midnight madness''
sales. Those will continue, K mart spokesman Orren F. Knauer said.
   But in a departure from its past, K mart has been stocking more
brand-name merchandise to appeal to customers, and those household
names will be better displayed in the new stores, Chairman Joseph
E. Antonini said this week.
   Events of the past week showed the task K mart faces in trying
to perk itself up.
   Antonini said on Monday that K mart would take a $640 million
charge against its 1989 earnings to pay for speeding up its
five-year, $2.3 billion chainwide makeover.
   As a result, K mart is expected to report only minimal or flat
earnings next week. It reported 1988 profits of $802.9 million on
sales of $27.3 billion.
   Meanwhile, smaller but faster-growing 1,400-store Wal-Mart
announced record sales and profits for 1989, with earnings up 28.5
percent to $1.1 billion on sales of $25 billion. Wal-Mart on
Thursday reported its sales February sales were up 33 percent,
while at its stores open a year or longer sales were up 17 percent.
   ``It's not if, it's when Wal-Mart will pass them by at their
present growth rates,'' said Frederick Marx, an independent
retailing consultant based in Bloomfield Hills.
   But Marx predicted a shifting lead, with K mart never far
behind. Wal-Mart, though growing fast in small-town America, won't
be able match K mart's immense array of store sites in metropolitan
areas, he said.
   Fighting back will mean changes at almost all of K mart's more
than 2,300 discount stores, Antonini said. He announced plans to
build 250 new stores, enlarge 620, relocate 280, close 30 and
refurbish about 1,260 in the five-year program.
   Prototypes already are operating in the Detroit suburbs of Royal
Oak and Rochester, Mich., and Virginia Beach, Va.
   Both new and old stores have adopted folksy Wal-Mart style
``people-greeters.'' At K-mart's old-style store in Port Huron, on
Lake Huron 60 miles north of Detroit, a greeter with a rag grinned
recently as he wiped melted snow from carts just in from the
parking lot and pushed them toward incoming shoppers.
   In the new store, instead of a whiff of the popcorn, candy and
tobacco counter of old, shoppers are greeted by gleaming floors,
bright lights and wide-open spaces.
   The popcorn counter was moved to a cafeteria area right of the
entrance. Rest rooms are easy to find, stylish graphics mark the
cosmetics area, videos play among the sporting goods and the stores
have bold signs and bigger stocks of merchandise on the shelves.
   ``Look at the jewelry area,'' Knauer said. ``It's the same
product we sell in the other stores, but the fixturing is more
department-store like. It makes the product look better.''
   Crosson, executive vice president of Jon Greenberg and
Associates Inc. in Berkley, said such perceptions amounted to
reality, in retailing.
   ``It's no longer just a bigger dime store, it's a discount
department store,'' he said of K mart.
   Crosson's firm has designed stores for retail establishments
including Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, and chains owned by New York-based
Mercantile Stores, which include Cincinnati's McAlpin's, Denver's
Joslin's and Florida's Gayfer's department stores.
