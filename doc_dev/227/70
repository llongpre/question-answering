<LEADPARA>  TO GET AN IDEA OF JUST HOW MUCH MERCHANDISE passes through a given Wal-Mart,
one need only consider a brand of dog food named Ol' Roy. Named after Walton's
favorite hunting dog, who died in 1981, and manufactured by several companies,
it is the second- or third-largest selling dry dog food in the country, and
it's sold only at Wal-Mart.;   One reason the chain became the nation's
largest discounter is that it concentrates on what is vaguely called
"service." Wal-Mart employs an army of cheerful, clean-cut workers who tend to
view the workplace as a venue to indulge in the kind of boosterism that
usually is associated with high school. The stores are something of a refuge
for young women who wanted to be cheerleaders and young men who wanted to play
football. Smiles and an upbeat we-can-whip-the-competition approach are job
requirements. So, even on a bad day, it is virtually impossible to find an
employee who is the least bit lacking in company spirit or the least bit curt.
("What? You don't have a public telephone here? That's insane!" huffs a
Vallejo visitor. "I'm very sorry, sir, but we've had some difficulty with the
phone company, and we'll be getting one in soon. Meanwhile, would you like to
use our phone here?")  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Moreover, the company consciously tries to communicate the message that
somehow the customers are listened-to more at Wal-Mart than at other
establishments. At one point in the Vallejo opening ceremonies, store manager
Doug Main, a gum-chewing Arkansas native, turned to the customers who had
congregated at the door and drawled: "Customers, the only reason we opened the
stores was for y'all. If you don't see that we're priced right, if you see
somebody beating us on price, you talk to a member of management or you talk
to one of these associates. OK? We're very serious. Customers are No. 1 at
Wal-Mart.";   Kenneth Stone, an Iowa State University economics professor who
has studied the Wal-Mart phenomenon from a variety of angles, suggests that
Wal-Mart doesn't beat the competition on every item. "Not everything is lower
at Wal-Mart, but the average person perceives it is. Wal-Mart is masterful at
undercutting things that people tend to know the prices of, like health and
beauty aids, things you buy more frequently. Or items you've been checking on
because they happen to be in season," he explains. Board member Robert Kahn
says Wal-Mart's markup ranges from about 6 percent on cigarettes to about 45
percent on certain jewelry.;   The massive amounts of merchandise that the
company sells give it tremendous clout over suppliers. And for years Wal-Mart
had the reputation of a bully, demanding what some vendors considered
excessively low prices for goods. Opting for smoother and longer-term
relationships with its vendors, Wal-Mart now pursues a more cooperative
policy, even working with vendors on design changes that would make
merchandise more affordable.;   Kahn is touring the Vallejo store when he
spots a rack bearing stacks of a footwear item named the Ozark Trail Boot. He
picks up a shoe box and turns it around in his hand. "Now that would sell
better if it was named the Sierra Trail Boot," he says, looking around for the
department manager.;   Then he puts on reading glasses that have been dangling
from a chain, and he tries to locate the manufacturer's name on the box. None
is listed, so he returns the shoe box to the rack and continues his tour of
the store.;   Soon, he encounters the shoe department manager.;   "There was
no manufacturer's name on it," he says of the Ozark Trail Boot. "Is it
somebody in the Ozarks that's making them, or is it just the name?";   "That
is not a domestic boot," replies the manager, awkwardly. "It is a brand that
we own, but it is not a domestic boot. There are several different factories
that we allow them to use the license, but it isn't domestic.";   "Ought to be
the Sierra Boot out here," says Kahn. "That's where people are going to hike
with it.";   Another appeal to customers in the heartland has been good
old-fashioned patriotism. Walk into any Wal-Mart store and the first thing
that catches your eye is likely to be a huge sign that bears an
up-to-the-minute tabulation of the number of American jobs estimated to be
saved as a result of the discounter's "Buy American" program.;   In 1983 an
Arkansas shirt manufacturer that lost its major customer was about to lay off
400 workers until, at the suggestion of Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, Sam Walton
stepped in to make the manufacturer a Wal-Mart supplier. Since that time, the
discounter has ardently promoted the fact that it buys American-made goods
whenever possible. Hence, the shoe department manager's embarrassment that
such a trademark item as the Ozark Trail Boot is an import. (It's manufactured
in China.);   Competing retailers and labor unions have charged that Wal-Mart
actually buys far fewer domestic items than it would lead customers to
believe. In the first two months of 1991 alone, Wal-Mart imported 265 metric
tons of apparel from Shanghai Garments of China. Each year it imports metric
tons of candy from Argentina and Chile. Two of the Chinese companies from
which it buys ceiling fans have been found by the U.S. Commerce Department to
be dumping goods on the U.S. market. And the majority of the retailer's
Bentonville-based photo-processing truck fleets are Mazdas.;   Kahn's response
to such statistics: "Yes, we're still buying a lot of goods offshore, but it's
a decreasing percent of what we sell." Wal-Mart spokeswoman Jane T. Arend says
the company's "Buy American" program has directly created almost 80,000 jobs
and that when the company learns of vendors or manufacturers who may be
involved in questionable practices it "investigates immediately."  </TEXT>
