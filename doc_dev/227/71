   CHICAGO -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. appears to have overtaken
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. as the nation's largest retailer,
underscoring big changes in the industry.
   Wal-Mart, a discount chain founded in 1962, finished its
fiscal year ended Jan. 31 with sales of $32.6 billion.

   Sears's 104-year-old retail operation, which once
dominated the American retail scene but has lost market share
to discounters and specialty stores over the past decade,
reported sales of $31.99 billion for the year ended Dec. 31.
   A Sears spokesman said the change in ranking reflects "the
changing nature of the retailing industry in the past
decade," particularly the increase in the number of
discounters and specialty stores focusing on major appliances
and other types of merchandise.
   He noted that Chicago-based Sears and Wal-Mart, which is
based in Bentonville, Ark., carry different merchandise,
competing directly on only about 30% of the goods in a
typical Sears store.
   "The mission of Sears, which has a business relationship
with about 70% of American households and which has 28
million active Sears charge accounts, is to be an integrated
powerful specialty merchant that offers a full line of brand
name goods and exclusive house brands at competitive prices
to American consumers," the spokesman added.
   But analysts say Sears, which is now cutting costs in a
bid to become more competitive, still needs to improve its
pricing, assortments and store displays to revive its
stagnant sales.
