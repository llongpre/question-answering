WAL-MART, the discount chain, yesterday named Mr S. Robson 'Rob' Walton as
chairman of America's largest and most influential retailing group in
succession to Mr Sam Walton, his father and the founder of the business, who
died on Sunday.
The 47-year-old new chairman is the eldest of Mr Sam Walton's four children
and has been a member of the Wal-Mart board since 1978.
The Walton family holds 38 per cent of Wal-Mart'stock.
Mr Sam Walton, who died in Little Rock, Arkansas, aged 74, after a long
struggle with cancer, had stepped down as chief executive of Wal-Mart in
1988, handing over day-to-day responsibility for running the business to a
management team headed by Mr David Glass.
Wal-Mart emphasised yesterday that Mr Rob Walton's assumption of the
chairmanship would mean no changes in group policy or direction.
The company would 'continue to look for operational guidance from its
current management team'.
Wal-Mart shares moved higher in active trading, and at close of trade on the
New York Stock Exchange were up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 52 7/8 .
In spite of the company's assurances, there remains some doubts on Wall
Street as to whether Wal-Mart can be quite the success it was under Mr Sam
Walton, who exerted a charismatic charm over the business right up to his
death.
There is also concern over Wal-Mart's ability to maintain its extraordinary
pace of growth as it pushes into food retailing, and experiments with
own-label products, at the same time as it expands geographically and faces
sharper competition from other large discount chains such as K-Mart.
