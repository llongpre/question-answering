   BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration of as
much as $1 billion of unsecured debt.
   A shelf registration allows the debt covered by the
registration to be issued over time.

   The discount retailer said it would use the proceeds to
repay short-term borrowings, which are used to buy land and
build stores and other facilities, and for working capital.
   "It sounds like they're swapping out their short-term debt
for long-term debt and trying to lock in interest rates,"
said William W. Whyte, an analyst with Stephens Inc. in
Little Rock, Ark. He said Wal-Mart has about $756 million in
shortterm debt.
   Mr. Whyte said an additional $1 billion in long-term debt
would increase WalMart's long-term-debt to total-capital
ratio to 39.9% from 26.2%.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. will lead the underwriting group.
