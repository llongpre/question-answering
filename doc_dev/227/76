Wal-Mart Stores Inc.: The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer said first-quarter 
net income rose 29% to $198.2 million and revenue climbed 25% to $5.37 billion 
from a year ago. The company said: "First quarter sales, driven by improved 
apparel sales and basic in-stock positions, ran above plan throughout the 
period." At April 30, the company had 1,279 Wal-Mart stores, 106 Sam's 
Wholesale clubs, 14 Dot Discount Drugstores and three Hypermart USA units.
