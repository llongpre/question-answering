   Tandy Corp., in a major break with tradition, will experiment with selling one of its computer models through 50 Wal-Mart stores. 

   The electronics manufacturer and retailer in the past has sold its products only through its chain of 4,800 company-owned and 2,200 dealer-owned Radio Shack stores. 
In addition to allowing another retailer to compete with its Radio Shack stores, the agreement also is signficant because Wal-Mart is sure to cut the computers' price as low as it can. 
Radio Shack traditionally has shied away from discounting. 

   John V. Roach, Tandy chairman and chief executive officer, said the move is part of a marketing strategy aimed at increasing market share by trying to find new avenues of distribution for products that it has developed. 
"We are a high-volume computer manufacturer and we think several alternative methods of distribution can help strengthen us as a company," he said. 

   Tandy products also are expected to be sold through the company's brand-name retail stores, known as McDuff and Video Concepts, by year end, he said. 

   The company, which sold 650,000 computers last year, said it will begin shipping a version of the Tandy 1000 SX to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of Bentonville, Ark. 
The computer will have two disk drives and a color monitor, similar to a computer Tandy markets to schools, but a different configuration from the computer packages sold in Radio Shack stores. 

   The stores participating in the experiment and the price of the computers will be up to Wal-Mart, Mr. Roach said. 
A Wal-Mart spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Tandy's stock closed at $46.125, down 87.5 cents. 

   In recent years, Tandy has sold computers through American Express direct mailings and the Army-Air Force Exchange. 
It hopes to improve its direct sales through its acquisition of Grid Systems Corp., a lap-top computer maker, and has even considered selling its computers under private labels. 
In the next few years, sales through different distribution channels could "become a measurable percentage" of computer sales, Mr. Roach said. 

   But he said the company plans to be choosy, perhaps selling through only one or two other retailers if the Wal-Mart tryout is successful. 
Mark Yamagata, marketing director for Tandy Electronics, said the company believes Wal-Mart reaches a different group of customers than Radio Shack, allowing Tandy to sell more computers without hurting its main business. 

   In addition to computers, Mr. Yamagata said Tandy also is considering new distribution avenues for its cellular telephones and its Deskmate software package. 
"We're not trying to sell everything we manufacture -- just products we feel are at the forefront of the technology," he said.
