KMART, the second-biggest US retailer, is selling most of its loss-making
Pace Membership Warehouse clubs to rival retailer Wal-Mart Stores.
Although terms were not disclosed, Kmart said the deal would yield net
proceeds of about Dollars 300m in cash, equal to Pace's net tangible book
value. It said the sale price included a premium over net book value, which
will be used to offset the cost of closing some Pace stores not sold to
Wal-Mart.
Kmart will take a pre-tax charge of about Dollars 450m against
fourth-quarter earnings.
Wal-Mart, which owns 326 Sam's Club warehouse stores, is buying 91 Pace
outlets. Pace operates 113 stores and had contracts for another 19 which
have not opened.
Wall Street had expected Kmart to shed its Pace stores. Kmart shares rose
Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars 24 7/8 , while Wal-Mart finished the day up
Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 27.
Kmart's foray into the deep discount market has been beset by problems. It
first struggled with Makro, a low-cost, warehouse-style retailer operated in
the US as a joint venture between a Michigan-based group and SHV Holdings of
the Netherlands. The Makro outlets were merged into the Pace business after
Kmart acquired Pace for Dollars 322m in 1989.
The timing of Kmart's Pace acquisition was also unfortunate. Shortly after
Kmart decided that clubs were more than a fad and expanded into the sector,
the industry started to show its vulnerability to competition and the weak
economy.
Pace, which had operating losses of Dollars 63m in the first half of this
year, has been criticised for operating inefficiencies.
In contrast, Wal-Mart was quick to spot the potential in the sector, opening
three Sam's Wholesale Clubs in 1983. By 1990, the company had more than 140
Sam's outlets.
Although the rate of same-store sales growth at Sam's has declined this
year, analysts have praised its sophisticated distribution system. They
expect it to benefit from the Pace acquisition.
The Pace deal will also strengthen Sam's position against the consolidation
of Price/Costco - the second- and third-biggest warehouse club chains which
agreed to merge this year.
Wal-Mart said the Pace clubs would continue to operate under the Pace name
until the sale was finalised.
The divestiture will help Kmart focus on its core discount-store operations.
In October, the company said it might sell 25 per cent stakes in its Sports
Authority, Borders, OfficeMax and Builders Square specialty chains through
initial public offerings.
In August, Kmart confirmed it was seeking bidders for its PayLess drugstores
chain. According to US press reports, Kmart has tentatively agreed to sell
PayLess for Dollars 1bn to a Los Angeles-based investment firm.
