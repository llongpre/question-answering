   Although expected, the results prompted a spurt in
Wal-Mart stock. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Wal-Mart rose 2 3/8 to 53 7/8.
   The U.S.'s largest retailer, long renowned for cost
consciousness, said selling, general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of sales dropped to 13.8% from 14.6%
a year ago. "That's remarkable -- by far the lowest in the
industry," said William W. Whyte, a retail analyst with
Stephens Inc. in Little Rock.
