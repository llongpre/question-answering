WAL-MART Stores, the expansion-minded US discount store group and the
nation's top-selling retailer, yesterday eased some of the concerns over its
growth prospects, with a 16 per cent improvement in first-quarter profits.
It said it was 'on track' to meet sales and earnings targets for the rest of
the year.
Wal-Mart's after-tax profits in the quarter to end-April totalled Dollars
450.6m, up 16 per cent on the Dollars 387m in the same period of 1992. Sales
rose to Dollars 13.9bn, a 19 per cent improvement over the Dollars 11.6bn in
1992.
At the per share level, earnings increased to 20 cents from 17 cents.
Wal-Mart shares rose Dollars 1 to to close at Dollars 27. They have been
trading close to 52-week low, as Wall Street has questioned whether
Wal-Mart's growth rate would slow. There have also been doubts over the
potential for the US 'warehouse club' sector - high-volume, deep-discount
outlets. Wal-Mart, with 277 Sam's Clubs stores, is one of the biggest
'warehouse' operators.
