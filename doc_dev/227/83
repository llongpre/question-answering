   BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it formed a
joint venture with Cifra S.A., the largest retailer in
Mexico, to open warehouse clubs in the Mexico City area.
   The giant discount retailer said the venture will operate
the warehouse clubs under the name Club Aurrera, and may open
the first store by late this year or early next year. The
clubs, which sell a variety of items in a warehouse
atmosphere at discount prices, are aimed at small businesses
and selected individual shoppers.
