   A new group of manufacturers' representatives plans to launch a public information campaign to fight Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s effort to remove the representatives from the selling process, a spokesman said. 

   As previously reported, Wal-Mart, the giant discount retailer, has asked numerous manufacturers to send only their executives to sell their products to Wal-Mart. 
Many manufacturers hire outside representatives to sell their products to retailers in a specific region. 
The representatives are paid a commission when they make a sale. 

   The Organization of Manufacturers Representatives, to be based in Washington, represents about 100 companies that employ about 1,000 representatives who sell hardware, housewares, toys, sporting goods and automotive accessories, among other goods. 

   The group said it hopes to help protect a manufacturer's right to choose how it sells its products. 
The group argues that eliminating the manufacturer's representative would cut out a small manufacturer's access to a big chain like Wal-Mart. 
It would also significantly reduce the number of representatives, hurting small retailers who rely on the salesmen to bring them their products. 

   A Wal-Mart spokesman said the Bentonville, Ark.-based company hasn't heard of the group and as a result, couldn't comment.
