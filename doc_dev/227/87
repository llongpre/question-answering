WAL-MART Stores, the fast-growing US retailer, is stepping up its Latin
American expansion.
Wal-Mart, which now outsells the likes of Sears, Roebuck and K mart, said
yesterday it would extend a previously-announced joint venture arrangement
with Cifra, the largest Mexican retailer, to include Wal-Mart Supercenter
combination stores, distribution centre operations, McLane wholesale
operations and more Club Aurrera outlets.
The initial joint venture between the two companies, announced in July,
concentrated on the development of wholesale clubs around Mexico City, under
the Club Aurrera name. Wal-Mart is an important operator of warehouse clubs
 -which sell limited product ranges at rock-bottom prices to a membership
customer base - in the US.
Wal-Mart says the first Mexican 'Supercenter', where both general
merchandise and food are sold, should open next year in Monterrey. Another
six to eight Club Aurrera units should also open in the Mexico City area in
1992-1993.
