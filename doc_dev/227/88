expense of Kmart

Sharply contrasting results from Wal-Mart and Kmart, the two biggest
discount store groups in the US, yesterday highlighted how Wal-Mart is
continuing to grow at Kmart's expense.
Wal-Mart, now the world's biggest retailer, reported an 11 per cent growth
in net income to Dollars 498.5m for the first quarter to April, while the
ailing Kmart barely scraped into profit with net income of Dollars 18m for
the same period.
Kmart's result marked a further deterioration from last year's first quarter
when it turned in net income of Dollars 58m before extraordinary items.
Sales rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 7.8bn but earnings per share fell from
12 cents before extraordinary items to 4 cents.
Kmart has suffered five years of stagnant earnings because of its failure to
compete effectively with Wal-Mart. One of its weaknesses has been poor
inventory control, leading to stocks of goods that customers do not want to
buy.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, said the group's niche
retailing offshoots had performed well, but sales in the main discount store
division had been below expectations, and the company had had to make big
inventory reductions.
In contrast, Wal-Mart saw a 27 per cent surge in sales to Dollars 17.7bn - a
figure boosted by the company's recent purchase of the Pace membership
warehouse stores from Kmart and Woolworth's 122 Woolco superstores in
Canada.
However, the cost of making the acquisitions and converting the stores had
its penalty at the bottom line. Earnings per share grew by 10 per cent to 22
cents from 20 cents, marking a sharp downturn from the rate of 25 per cent a
year seen over the past five years.
Wal-Mart's shares suffered a downward re-rating last year amid fears that it
had become too big to sustain the same high rates of earnings growth. It
countered that its acquisitions would provide a platform for continued rapid
growth.
Yesterday Mr David Glass, president and chief executive, said the conversion
of the former Pace clubs into Sam's Clubs - Wal-Mart's membership warehouse
operation - was substantially complete, and the conversion of the Woolco
stores into Wal-Mart stores should be achieved by the year end.
