   Voters endorsed construction of a shopping
center anchored by a Wal-Mart on the edge of town, setting aside
fears of consumer flight away from downtown.
   Residents of this college town Tuesday voted 4,669 to 3,954 to
rezone 28 acres for the project. The City Council decided May 16 to
rezone the property, but a citizens group gathered 3,000 signatures
to put the question to voters.
   Business owners said they feared the Wal-Mart store and shopping
center would draw customers away.
   Brenda Lockhart, a spokeswoman at Wal-Mart headquarters in
Bentonville, Ark., said, ``We don't apologize for having the lowest
prices on high quality merchandise.''
   The Wal-Mart store would take up 82,000 of the 222,000 square
feet of retail space proposed for the shopping center. Developers
said construction is scheduled to begin early next year.
   Iowa City, with about 50,000 residents, is home to the University
of Iowa.
