   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. on Thursday
reported 25 percent growth in its second-quarter profit on a 25
percent sales gain.
   The fast-growing discounter, based in Bentonville, Ark., earned
$272.9 million, or 24 cents a share, in the three months ended July
31, up from $219 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Sales grew to $7.54 billion in the retailer's fiscal 1990 second
quarter from $6.05 billion a year before.
   David Glass, president and chief executive officer, credited the
company's merchandising strategy for producing the profit
improvement.
   ``Our customers continue to support our efforts to serve them
with quality merchandise and service,'' he said in a news release.
   But he said that forecasts for the second half of the year ``are
characterized by anticipated economic uncertainty.''
   Wal-Mart has bucked the slowing trend in the retail industry
this year and has consistently outperformed its competitors. The
discounter might pass Sears, Roebuck and Co. and K mart Corp. this
year in annual sales volume, industry analysts say. Sears and K
mart are the nation's first- and second-ranked retailers,
respectively.
   Also on Thursday, Wal-Mart reported its sales for July, which
exceeded the gains posted by most other major general merchandise
chains. Last month sales rose 21 percent to $2.4 billion from $1.98
billion a year earlier. Sales at Wal-Mart-owned stores open a year
or longer rose 8 percent.
   For the first half of its year, Wal-Mart earned $526 million, or
46 cents a share, up 26 percent from $417 million, or 37 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales for the first half amounted to $14.31
billion, up 25 percent from $11.42 billion in 1989's first half.
   Wal-Mart opened two new distribution centers and completed a
third during the second quarter, resulting in an addition of
3,110,620 square feet of distribution space.
   In the quarter, 18 new Wal-Mart stores and four Sam's Wholesale
Clubs were opened. For the year, the company has opened 36 Wal-Mart
stores, nine Sam's and one Hypermart USA.
   Wal-Mart operates in 30 states.
