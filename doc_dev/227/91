<LEADPARA>  Q We purchased a set of Faber-Castell pens from McWhorter's in San Jose. One
of the benefits of this purchase was a $2 rebate. I received the $2 rebate
check and deposited it in my account. My bank returned the check, and across
the front was stamped "Insuff. Funds" Not only was I out the $2, I also had to
pay a bounced-check charge. Please look into this to see if this is just a
fluke or if Faber-Castell is trying to rip off the public. I'd appreciate a
(good) $8 check to cover my losses.;    -- Edward Barber, San Jose  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  A  You'll have no trouble with the check being sent to you by Faber-Castell,
says spokesman Walter Raleigh. He says the fulfillment house hired to handle
the rebates forgot to deposit money in the account the checks were drawn on,
causing checks to bounce. That problem has been rectified, says Raleigh. He
says if any other readers were caught holding a bounced refund check, they
should send a photocopy of the check and a photocopy of a statement from the
bank showing the charges to John Brandewie, marketing manager, Faber-Castell,
4 Century Drive, Parsippany, N.J. 07054.;    The Wal-Mart address;  Q  I want
to contact Sam Walton of Wal-Mart stores. Do you have the address of
Wal-Mart's headquarters?;    -- Frank Tran, San Jose; A  We certainly do:
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 702 S.W. Eighth St., Bentonville, Ark. 72716.;    A
thorn in the side;  Q  On May 2, I ordered flowers to be wired to Florida from
Conroy's Flowers in San Jose. After filling out information, including my
phone number, on an order blank, I presented my Visa card for payment. After I
signed my name, the clerk asked me to write my phone number on the charge
slip. I explained that as of Jan. 1, it was no longer legal to require such
information. I gave the clerk a copy of an Action Line column stating this.
She proceeded to copy my phone number off of the order blank onto the charge
slip. When I objected, she said it was store policy. I asked to cancel the
order. At this point, the store owner took over and said the clerk was just
following orders. She said taking down the phone number was store policy. What
can be done now?;    -- Caroline Clark, San Jose; A  According to the law you
cited, your recourse is through small claims court. The law, one of a pair of
bills authored by Assemblyman Rusty Areias, D-Los Banos, is meant to cut down
on credit card fraud. As you say, it prohibits merchants from requiring
customers' addresses and phone numbers when they pay by credit card. The other
law prohibits them from insisting upon credit card numbers from customers
paying by check. Violators of either one are subject to a civil penalty of
$250 for a first offense and $1,000 each for subsequent offenses. Both laws
stress leniency for merchants who unintentionally request the information or
make a bona fide error. Conroy's owner Yvonne Kendall says your trouble was a
"misunderstanding." She says the clerk made a mistake in copying the phone
number to the receipt. Kendall says she is aware of the laws, has copies of
them posted at the store and has explained them to her clerk.  </TEXT>
