'big boxes' - The K mart head sees discount emporia as the key to US
retailing

MR JOE Antonini, head of the K mart retail group, stands in the stockroom of
a former Bloomingdale's in Queens, New York City, and talks about turning
department stores into discount emporia. 'The big box,' declares Mr
Antonini, 'is what K mart is about today.'
A few feet behind the chairman - sometimes tagged 'the Lee Iaccoca of
retailing' because of his willingness to promote the company personally  -
is a large poster. 'Dollars 50bn by 1995; Dollars 100bn by 2000', it reads,
a declaration of group sales targets.
In recent years, K mart, though still the number two US retailer in terms of
sales, has played second fiddle to Wal-Mart Stores. The Arkansas-based
discount chain operator has overtaken K mart in turnover terms. More
significantly, Wal-Mart's low cost base and extraordinary sales momentum
have prompted a major shift in US retailing.
K mart may have been overshadowed by its rival, but the Michigan company is
fighting to regain some initiative. For example, the 'big box', which Mr
Antonini stresses, unashamedly matches the direction which Wal-Mart has been
taking, and both are experimenting with large 'combo' stores, where food
items sit alongside general merchandise.
The clearly-posted sales targets are also aimed at keeping K mart in the
Wal-Mart league. Analysts suggest the Arkansas group could see sales of
Dollars 100bn by 1995, after having recorded Dollars 44bn in 1991, although
executives are more cautious. K mart's turnover last year was Dollars 35bn.
Even the opening of K mart's first New York City store - a 132,000sq ft
refurbishment, carved out of the former Bloomingdale's outlet - smacks of an
attempt to steal a march on its competitor.
Wal-Mart has yet to venture into New York City, traditionally viewed as a
high-cost 'union' town, or even into the heavily-populated tri-state region.
K mart, by contrast, is not only opening the Queens store, but makes clear
others will follow. 'We hope to open several more (stores) within the five
boroughs during the next few years,' Mr Antonini says.
But analysts are divided over whether all this marks a K mart renaissance.
The company's problems have been evident since the mid-1980s. Having grown
rapidly in the 1970s, K mart found itself with a large number of smaller
stores, a dowdy image, and decelerating sales growth.
A trend towards 'niche' retailing was underway in the US, and K mart focused
on acquiring specialist chains, such as Pay Less Drugs in 1985 and
Waldenbooks in 1984. Internal efficiencies of the core discount chain
operation seem to have been overlooked. In 1985, the year before Mr Antonini
took over as chief operating officer, net profits fell 6 per cent to Dollars
471m.
Since then, there has been a stream of initiatives designed to help K mart
regain its edge. As Mr Antonini sees it, the strategy has three elements.
First, K mart is engaged in a major overhaul of the 2,400 discount store
outlets, with improvements ranging from a widening of aisles to the addition
of gardening and pharmacy centres.
This programme - costing around Dollars 3bn - was announced in 1990. By the
end of this year, about half the chain should be operating under the new
format. The programme should be completed by 1995.
More recently, however, the future of the discount store division has been
bound up with the 'combo' store developments. Initially, K mart developed
these emporia - at around 140,000 to 160,000 sq ft, twice the size of a
typical K mart - in conjunction with a joint-venture partner, under the
'American Fare' fascia. But recently, it has stepped out on its own,
converting two of the three American Fare stores to 'Super K marts' and
adding two more 'combo' stores in Ohio. The remaining American Fare outlet
in Atlanta is due to convert by the year-end.
Mr Antonini talks of adding another 15 combo-stores in 1993 and, if all goes
well, a stepped-up rate thereafter. The ultimate potential, he says, is for
400-500 of these outlets within the group.
K mart's second leg - the specialty store division - is a mixed bag, ranging
from the Pace warehouse clubs to OfficeMax, a chain of superstores
specialising in office equipment, furniture and computers. Mr Antonini sees
potential for strong sales growth in this division, and forecast 1992 sales
of Dollars 11bn could rise to Dollars 25bn by 1996.
Finally, K mart is looking overseas - a strategy which differentiates it
from its US competitors apart from, perhaps, Wal-Mart - and made its first
move by purchasing a dozen retail outlets in Czechoslovakia earlier this
year.
So what does the new strategy add up to? Some of the recent moves cannot be
judged at this early stage. A more fundamental question is whether
refurbishing K mart outlets is paying off.
So far this year, K mart's same-store sales growth in the general
merchandise division has been uninspiring, running at 2.1 per cent (for US
stores) in the 39 weeks to end-October. K mart claims an incremental 3-4 per
cent increase in sales from refurbished stores, but stresses this is an
average.
One problem is that the cost base remains substantially higher than at
Wal-Mart. For example, operating, selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A)
expenses accounted for 15.2 per cent of Wal-Mart sales in the 12 months to
end-January; at K mart, the figure was 21.2 per cent. Again, these ratios
are 'group-wide' and to some extent reflect the two groups' different type
of stores. Growth of the low-cost Pace warehouse club chain may help reduce
K mart's SG&amp;A over time.
Earnings growth, meanwhile, has been patchy as restructuring charges and the
general reshaping of the group has taken a toll.
In the year to end-January 1992, earnings per share stood at Dollars 2.02,
only marginally above 1988's Dollars 2. Supporters argue that the best is to
come - and earnings predictions for the current 12 months range around the
Dollars 2.15 mark. But everything, it seems, has yet to be proved.
