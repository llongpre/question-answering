   DALLAS -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is seeking to work directly
with senior managers of its suppliers to ensure that its
shelves are filled, and not to cut out independent sales
representatives, the giant discounter's president and chief
executive officer said yesterday.
   In response to a question after a speech yesterday
afternoon to the Dallas Chamber of Commerce, David D. Glass
said that Wal-Mart is expecting sales of $44 billion for the
fiscal year ending in January, jumping to $56 billion for
fiscal 1993. Given that growth, he said, the company needs to
be sure that it has adequate supplies.

   Mr. Glass said that a Nov. 6 letter saying that Wal-Mart
had decided that it should deal directly with principals of
the companies to improve communication and reaction time was
mailed to "way less" than half the company's suppliers. He
said the move isn't intended to try to squeeze lower prices
out of manufacturers by eliminating the representatives'
commissions, as many manufacturers and reps have charged.
   Mr. Glass also said that the company, the nation's largest
retailer, hasn't prohibited any manufacturers from using reps
or brokers and said that Wal-Mart would never order small
suppliers without a sales staff to give up their reps.
   However, several reps and manufacturers have said that
Wal-Mart buyers told some companies and their reps that reps
wouldn't be welcome at Wal-Mart's Bentonville, Ark.,
headquarters beginning this week. One manufacturers' trade
group executive said he knew of companies with annual sales
of as little as $1 million who have received Mr. Glass's
letter.
   In a statement yesterday, officials of the National Food
Brokers Association and the Electronics Representatives
Association charged that Wal-Mart's move would hurt not only
reps and brokers, but also manufacturers who couldn't support
an in-house sales staff.
