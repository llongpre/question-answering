   AUSTIN, Texas -- John Paul Mitchell Systems Inc. filed
suit against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in district court here,
charging that the nation's largest retailer is selling
unauthorized and substandard batches of Mitchell Systems'
Paul Mitchell beauty products.
   In the suit, Mitchell Systems claims that a former
supplier sold to Wal-Mart some beauty products that Mitchell
Systems had rejected because of poor quality. Mitchell
Systems said Wal-Mart is selling the product under the Paul
Mitchell name. Mitchell Systems, based in Sagas, Calif.,
asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order
prohibiting Wal-Mart from selling the product.
