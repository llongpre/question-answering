WAL-MART Stores, the largest US retailer in sales terms, yesterday kept up
its recession-beating progress, with a 24 per cent increase in third-quarter
profits to Dollars 437.8m after tax.
The increase was scored on sales up by 28.7 per cent at Dollars 13.7bn, and
translated into a 22.6 per cent improvement in earnings per share, at 38
cents.
The Arkansas-based discount retailer has now posted sales of Dollars 38.4bn
for the first nine months of the year, compared with Dollars 30.2bn in the
same period of 1991, with after-tax profits reaching Dollars 1.24bn, against
Dollars 1.01bn.
That progress, said Mr David Glass, the company's chief executive, should
position the company well 'to meet our objectives for the approaching
holiday selling season and the balance of the year'.
In part, Wal-Mart's growth comes from an aggressive store opening programme,
although same-store sales growth has also been running at double-digit rates
in the first 10 months of 1992.
During the third quarter alone, the group opened 50 new Wal-Mart outlets -
closing one - and 10 Sam's Clubs, the chain of no-frills but ultra-cheap
warehouse clubs.
International Flavors &amp; Fragrances, the US fragrances group, will take a
pre-tax charge of about Dollars 20m in the fourth quarter and full-year for
consolidating its European production facilities, and a pre-tax charge of
about Dollars 32m in the first three quarters as a result of adopting new
accounting standards, AP-DJ reports.
