   Limited Inc. announced Tuesday its third-quarter net income rose
1.7 percent as its sales began to recover from a year-long slump.
   Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which has thrived while other
retailers stagnated, said its earnings rose 33 percent during the
quarter.
   Limited, based in Columbus, Ohio, said it earned $70.4 million,
or 39 cents a share, during the quarter ended Oct. 29, up from $69.3
million, or 36 cents a share, in the same period of fiscal 1987.
   Sales at the specialty apparel retailer totaled $1.01 billion, up
13.5 percent from $891.7 million in the third quarter a year earlier.
   Limited showed signs of recovery during September and October
following a year of dismal sales. Many apparel retailers have seen
their sales slump and profits decline since the third quarter of
1987 as women shied away from the stores' fall and spring fashions.
   Some observers believe Limited, whose divisions include Limited,
Limited Express, Lerner, Victoria's Secret and Lane Bryant stores,
will lead the industry recovery.
   Limited Chairman Leslie Wexner said ``things began to feel
normal'' during the latest quarter.
   The company _ and other retailers _ will be hoping for continued
improvement during the fourth quarter, when storeowners earn more
than half their annual profits.
   Limited reported its earnings for the first three quarters fell
27.3 percent to $125 million, or 69 cents a share, from $171.9
million, or 90 cents a share, in the first nine months of 1987.
   The year-to-date figures reflect the slump in the apparel
industry.
   Sales for the period rose 7.5 percent to $2.71 billion from $2.52
billion for the first three quarters last year.
   There were no surprises in Wal-Mart's earnings report, as the
discount store chain performed as well as industry analysts expected.
   Wal-Mart, which has more than 1,300 stores in 25 states, said it
earned $180.9 million, or 32 cents per share, during the quarter
ended Oct. 31, up from $136.1 million, or 24 cents per share, a year
earlier.
   The company, based in Bentonville, Ark., reported sales of $4.99
billion, up 24.1 percent from $4.02 billion in the third quarter of
1987.
   Although most general retailers have had sluggish sales for more
than a year and a half, Wal-Mart's low-price strategy has helped the
company escape the problems its competitors have encountered. The
company, which has some of the lowest expenses in the business, has
not had to undergo the cost-cutting steps that other retailers have
been forced to implement.
   Wal-Mart reported year-to-date earnings of $514 million, or 91
cents per share, up 35 percent from $380.5 million, or 67 cents per
share, in the same period of 1987.
   The discounter said its sales increased 28.2 percent to $14.12
billion from $10.96 billion in the first nine months of 1987.
