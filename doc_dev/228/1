   With some modest fanfare, Joan Lunden today
celebrates her 10th anniversary as co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning
America.'' This makes her somewhat extraordinary _ lasting in a job
that is a people-eater.
   ``I have to say I'm surprised that I'm sitting here, being the
person who has the most tenure on the morning shows,'' she says,
referring to those in the co-host and co-anchor business.
   ``It seems like it was just yesterday that I was the new kid on
the block.''
   Her time on active dawn duty goes against tradition. Network
morning show stars tend to be television's wandering tribe, often
moving on because of their own decisions, management anxiety, or
both.
   Within the last 12 months, six other such stars have left or
found new homes, notably Jane Pauley.
   Succeeded by Deborah Norville as part of the controversial
changes that sent once top-rated ``Today'' skidding into second,
Pauley is doing well in with prime time NBC News specials after 13
``Today'' years.
   ``Today'' news anchor John Palmer, an NBC News veteran, got
moved out in that show's shuffle. He left NBC and now has a
syndicated series. Faith Daniels left the ``CBS Morning News'' and
now has Palmer's old NBC job.
   Kathleen Sullivan of ``CBS This Morning'' got the gate, and now
is pondering her next move. She was succeeded by Paula Zahn, who
left ABC's ``World News This Morning.''
   And new mother Maria Shriver left NBC's ``Sunday Today'' to have
more family time, although she remains with NBC News.
   But Lunden _ who is only the third female co-host ``Good Morning
America'' has had since it began in November 1975 _ has stayed put.
   Married to television producer Michael Krauss, she's even
managed to have three kids during her time on the program.
   Lunden, who turns 40 next month and this summer signed a new
five-year contract with ABC, says she hasn't had any desire to
leave ``Good Morning America.'' But then, her life on the show has
been relatively serene.
   And her show, unlike ``Today'' and the shows that represent CBS'
many years of efforts to make ratings in the morning, hasn't had
the public turmoil of the kind that last year made ``Today'' a
daily two-hour soap opera.
   Lunden, a ceaselessly cheery woman better known for warmth than
penetrating interviews, hasn't even had a good headline-making
incident, like Sullivan's off-air jabs at CBS management that made
their way into print last year.
   The best Lunden has been able to stir up was a pre-emptive
on-air strike this summer. She told viewers that reporters from the
tabloid National Enquirer had been poking into her life, asking
friends if she'd seemed troubled lately.
   Why she bothered was a bit puzzling. In any event, the editor of
the paper said the queries hadn't turned up anything. Oh well, the
nation said, and life went on.
   Actor David Hartman, who hosted ``Good Morning America'' from
the start until newsman Charles Gibson succeeded him in January
1987, was an avuncular man on the air.
   But off-camera, he was said to be a tough, demanding man, one
who wanted it known the show's focus was on him, not his co-host.
   Despite that, Lunden, who first worked for the show as a
consumer reporter in 1976, said she got along fine with Hartman,
``because I just made sure that things (between them) stayed nice
all the time.
   ``I'm not saying that I wasn't very frustrated many times with
the real tight restrictions that were put on my abilities to do
stories and expand my job. But I didn't allow that to become an
issue with David and me.
   ``Because I knew very clearly that if that happened and that
relationship went, everything else was a moot point, I was gone, I
was out of there.''
   While Hartman was the host, ``Good Morning America'' had a good
run as first in ratings. But it started slipping toward the end of
his stay, and generally stayed in second until coming on strong
last year in the wake of the ``Today'' debacle.
   It has been first for 33 consecutive weeks. But during its long
stay in second, Lunden said, those on the show didn't get a lot of
pressure from ABC brass, or those of Capital Cities, the network's
new owners.
   ``They really just said, `Hey, go out there, enjoy it, be
curious, and have a good time, '' she said. ``They said, `If it
works, the ratings will go up.' And they did.''

   Elsewhere in television...
   REASON NO. 398 TO CONTINUE BREATHING: Remember the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles? Well, CBS feels it is not enough just to
start a Saturday morning cartoon series with them on Sept. 15. It
now also says it will have a ``sneak preview'' of the one-hour
series for kids on Sept. 8, and include in the show a
save-the-environment segment called ``Turtle Tips.''
