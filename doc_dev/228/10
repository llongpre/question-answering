   In what will be the second exit of a network
morning anchorwoman in a year's time, Kathleen Sullivan is being
replaced on ``CBS This Morning,'' her agent said Friday.
   CBS said it can't confirm or deny that.
   Sullivan, whose CBS contract expires in November, got the word
Wednesday in a meeting with CBS News President David Burke and
other executives, said her agent, Ron Konecky. No date is set for
her departure, he said.
   ``Not really,'' he said when asked if they gave any reason why
they wanted to replace her on the two-hour morning show that she
has co-anchored with Harry Smith since its premiere Nov. 30, 1987.
   ``I think that was a management decision they felt they had to
make,'' Konecky said. ``I'm having ongoing, positive meetings with
them with a view to other assignments for Kathleen at CBS.''
   There have been reports she will be succeeded by Paula Zahn,
co-anchor of ABC's ``World News This Morning,'' and the news
segments of the following ``Good Morning America.''
   Scott Richardson, an ABC spokesman, said he had no comment on
whether Zahn will leave ABC. CBS spokeswoman Terry Everett said CBS
can't confirm or deny if Sullivan, 36, is out at ``CBS This
Morning.''
   Asked if Sullivan's co-anchor, Smith, is staying at the CBS
show, a CBS official who spoke on condition he not be identified by
name said yes.
   From its start, the program has been a distant third in ratings
to ``Good Morning America'' and NBC's ``Today.'' Speaking last
October on the syndicated ``Donahue'' show last fall, Sullivan
predicted ``my days are numbered'' if the ratings didn't improve.
   Ironically, another anchorwoman appearing with her on
``Donahue'' was Jane Pauley, who as part of the most controverial
change in ``Today'' left that show in December after 13 years as
its co-host. She was succeeded in January by Deborah Norville.
   Sullivan co-anchored Friday's ``CBS This Morning'' from Atlanta.
During the broadcast, she made no mention of her impending
depature. Neither did Smith or news anchor Charles Osgood. She
couldn't be reached for comment Friday.
   Everett, who said the program will originate from Florida next
week, said Sullivan had gone to Atlanta on personal business.
   Ted Turner's Cable News Network is based in Atlanta, but Konecky
said she wasn't there for talks with CNN officials, nor was he
negotiating with them for her.
   He said CBS officials have asked her to stay on at ``CBS This
Morning'' during its transition to a new anchorwoman ``and she's
happy to do so.''
   The news of Sullivan's impending exit, coupled with the
three-month payless suspension of ``60 Minutes'' humorist Andy
Rooney for a racial slur attributed to him, came at an awkward time
for CBS executives.
   A spokesman said that Burke, ``CBS This Morning'' executive
producer Erik Sorenson, and other CBS officials were in Phoenix on
Friday, attending a regional meeting of executives from
CBS-affiliated stations.
