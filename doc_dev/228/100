   With wisecracks from Willard Scott about another
bald head on the set, Joe Garagiola returned to NBC's ``Today''
show for what it hopes will prove a fresh start after a year of woe.
   Although heavily promoted by NBC during the weekend, the
new-look ``Today'' was low-key Monday as Bryant Gumbel and
co-anchor Deborah Norville welcomed Garagiola, the show's co-host
from 1969 to 1973 and now its second co-anchor.
   Appearing without his toupee, the ebullient Scott kidded
Garagiola about his baldness, joking from Washington, ``I got a
quart of Simonize I'm sending.''
   There were no speeches and no recap by Gumbel of the show's
problems.
   Since anchorwoman Jane Pauley's departure in December after 13
years, once-dominant ``Today'' has been second in ratings to ABC's
``Good Morning America'' for 22 weeks. Its ratings are 17 percent
below last year's.
   Garagiola, a 64-year-old former baseball catcher, was brought
back from semi-retirement in Arizona to add what NBC hopes will be
a sense of warmth and family that translates into higher ratings.

   Dads in TV comedies should show a little more
affection, says Bob Saget of ABC's ``Full House.''
   Saget said he and other fathers in TV comedies are often
insensitive incompetents because the basis for sitcoms is conflict,
and the conflict often comes from the father needing help.
   ``For the show to work, you got to make him a goober
sometimes,'' Saget said in the June 16 issue of TV Guide. ``If the
father's not a bit bumbling and the kids are not on top of it,
where's the comedy?''
   Hal Williams, a father on NBC's ``227,'' said the networks ``add
lighter moments, like a dad who has problems cooking a meal or
changing a diaper or talking about something serious, but I find a
lot of that stuff hard to believe.''

   Bob Cummings, who had his own TV comedy in
the 1950s and '60s, felt half his age when more than 100 friends
surprised him with an 80th birthday bash.
   ``It's my 40th birthday,'' Cummings joked during a Friday night
bash in suburban Sherman Oaks for the star of ``The Bob Cummings
Show,'' ``My Living Doll'' and ``My Hero.''
   Cummings' birthday was Saturday.
   Among the celebrities on hand were Jane Withers, Pat Buttram,
Jane Wyatt, Rose Marie, Buddy Rogers, Dick Van Patten and Margaret
O'Brien.
   Art Linkletter, a longtime buddy, said, ``We have laughed our
way around the world together a couple of times.''

   Singer Olivia Newton-John, the new
goodwill ambassador for the United Nations' Environment Program,
says individuals can help save the environment in simple ways.
   ``I can tell people that they can make a difference, that they
should not feel powerless and feel the problem is up to someone
else,'' she said Monday.
   When her daughter was born four years ago, Ms. Newton-John said,
she ``felt a sense of my own mortality and wanted to leave her a
better world.''
   She has written and performed love songs for her daughter that
contain an environmental message, and put out an album on
recyclable paper, she said.
   She said people can help by buying recyclable goods, turning off
the tap when brushing their teeth and avoiding products that
endanger animals.
   As goodwill ambassador, the Australian-born Newton-John, who is
now a U.S. citizen, will undertake missions worldwide, including a
visit to the U.N. program's Nairobi headquarters in August for a
``celebrity safari.''

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson says the biggest
threat to the younger generation is not bigotry but weakness of
character.
   He urged his daughter's ninth-grade class to shun drugs and seek
out challenges to improve the world.
   ``What does it matter if you have this opportunity to lead us
into the next century and choose some flirtation or infatuation
over using these precious moments to improve your mind?'' Jackson
asked graduating Fay School students Sunday.
   ``No, the great threat to your generation is not some ancient,
archaic law, denying you access and information based upon race or
sex or religion, but rather a challenge of character and the will
to choose hope if you will over dope.''
   Jackson waved his daughter's diploma in the air before handing
it to her.
   Jacqueline Lavinia Jackson was among 56 students who received
diplomas from the private school.
