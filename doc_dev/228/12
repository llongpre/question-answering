   Erik Sorenson recently became the second
executive producer ``CBS This Morning'' has had since its debut on
Nov. 30 two years ago. He has what some consider the morning
version of ``Mission Impossible.''
   Like its previous incarnations, the two-hour program remains a
distant third in ratings against NBC's ``Today'' and ABC's ``Good
Morning America.'' Like his precedessors on past and current CBS
morning shows, Sorenson is expected to change that.
   ``I don't think it's impossible,'' says Sorenson, 33, a former
vice president of CBS-owned KCBS-TV in Los Angeles. ``I think it's
tough, though.''
   That it is. Nielsen figures for last month's important ratings
sweeps _ local stations use the results to set advertising rates _
gave CBS' ``Morning'' a 2.5 ratings average, well behind the ABC
and NBC shows; they were tied with a 4.4. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.
   But the Nielsens contained a ray of hope for the CBS reveille
team of Harry Smith and Kathleen Sullivan. The ratings were up
two-tenths of a point from those of the previous November. Tiny,
yes, but a start.
   To improve on that, Sorenson, in the custom of new producers,
plans some changes: a different musical arrangement of the show's
theme music; more ratings-boosting travel, and what he calls ``more
visual variety.''
   No costly new set, a staple of arriving executive producers, is
planned by Sorenson, a Waukegan, Ill., native whose background is
in local news.
   But he is trying to get ``name'' contributors on various topics,
among them Chicago-based movie critic Gene Siskel, best known from
the syndicated ``Siskel &amp; Ebert`` film-review series.
   Others contributors, he says, would report on parenting,
science, the environment and aging.
   In addition to his plans to rely more heavily on CBS
correspondents, he has hired two new full-time staffers, features
reporter Wayne Freedman and Hollywood-based entertainment reporter
Steve Kmetko.
   And, in a move that got his show some publicity last week, he
hired CBS Sports reporter Greg Gumbel, the brother of ``Today''
co-host Bryant Gumbel, to do sports segments and occasional fill-in
anchoring on ``CBS This Morning.''
   But Sorenson doesn't think his show will get a swarm of
disaffected ``Today'' viewers next month when Jane Pauley, after 13
years on NBC's show, yields her co-host chair there to Deborah
Norville.
   ``Certainly Jane Pauley has a big following, and her departure
is undoubtedly going to cause some of her followers to look around
at what else is available,'' he says.
   But he theorizes that ``Good Morning America'' would be the
chief beneficiary of any ``Today'' viewer defection simply because
it has been on since 1975 and, like its NBC rival, is a place of
relative stability.
   CBS, in contrast, still is trying to get back morning viewers
who, after all the years of change, may have given up on it, he
says:
   ``I think a lot of viewers don't realize that CBS is a viable
alternative here. And so, I don't think we would stand to gain as
much from this (Pauley's exit) as perhaps GMA will. But I think we
certainly stand to gain.''
   Reassurances of stability in CBS' morning effort might help aid
its cause.
   No doubt for that reason, Sorenson has been downplaying
Sullivan's unusually frank comment last October on ``Donahue'' that
``my days are numbered'' if her show's ratings don't improve.
   Asked if she and Smith will continue as anchors all next year on
``CBS This Morning,'' Sorenson immediately replied, ``Yes.''
   He laughed when advised that constitutes a ringing endorsement
in network TV today. He also added qualifying comments. The anchor
team of Sullivan &amp; Smith will remain ``to the extent'' that he has
control of the situation.
   ``Obviously, there are forces and factors out there in the world
that could change that,'' he said. ``I suppose that if for some
reason, the show started bleeding ... and we started doing a 1.4
(rating) for 12 weeks in a row, somebody would have to say, `Wait a
minute, there's a mistake somewhere ...'
   ``But it's our intention to stay the course, stick with what
we've got, and improve on the program.''
