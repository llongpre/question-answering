   These are tough times for NBC's venerable
``Today'' show, the program that invented the morning TV format.
   Last week it lost in the ratings to ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' for the ninth consecutive week, and it lost the February
``sweeps'' to ABC for the first time since November 1985.
   Is the sun going down on ``Today''? Is this a new dawn for ABC's
``Good Morning America''? Will ``CBS This Morning'' emerge from the
twilight of third place? Has success spoiled Bryant Gumbel?
   ``Today'' ratings began declining with co-host Jane Pauley's
poised and public departure from the show after 13 years. Her
replacement, NBC newswoman Deborah Norville, apparently reminds
some women of their least-favorite college roommate.
   ``The `Today' show has experienced a serious decline, about 15
percent on average, since Deborah Norville took over,'' said David
Marans, head of media research for the J. Walter Thompson
advertising conglomerate.
   ``There was a clear reaction to the change in casting,'' he
said. ``We could see no other reason for the needle really moving.''
   CBS' morning efforts generally have run a distant third in
ratings almost since the network began competing with ``Today'' in
1954. Predecessors of ``CBS This Morning'' changed personnel, sets
and style so often that a loyal viewer was someone who occasionally
tuned in just to see who or what was still there.
   The current CBS edition's latest attempt at innovation, in
February, was to cashier Harry Smith's co-anchor, Kathleen
Sullivan, in favor of ex-ABC newswoman Paula Zahn and a barely
discernible improvement in ratings.
   ABC, keeping the same cast before its cameras, won the No. 1
spot without significantly increasing its ratings.
   ``It takes a long time to develop a team,'' said Jack Reilly,
executive producer of ``Good Morning America.'' ``It takes an even
longer time for the audience to accept it.''
   Reilly noted that, historically, ``Today'' has led in household
ratings but ABC's show has been more popular among advertisers'
most desirable target groups _ women aged 18 to 49 and men and
women aged 25 to 54.
   NBC officials insist that they're not worried about the numbers.
   ``We knew there was going to be a drop in the ratings for the
`Today' show,'' said NBC research chief Bob Niles. ``The good news
is that we were pretty good about forecasting it. The bad news is
we didn't want to see those numbers.''
   Niles said a similar ratings dip occurred after Gumbel replaced
Tom Brokaw as co-host in January 1982. For the next two years, ABC
beat ``Today'' like a gong. One week in August 1983, ``Today''
finished third for the first time.
   Overall, since January ``Today'' has lagged an average
six-tenths of a rating point behind ``Good Morning America,'' for a
loss of about 600,000 viewers, Niles said.
   Niles said the decline has not prompted NBC to conduct any
immediate audience research to discover just what the problem is.
   ABC's Reilly said: ``Everyone forgets that the pressure that
brought on all these problems over there there was that we were
beating them.''
   And, he noted, it took ``Today'' five years to climb back to No.
1 after Gumbel joined the show.
   Gumbel presaged the current troubles with a memo criticizing
weatherman Willard Scott and other ``Today'' personalities.
   The memo to then-producer Marty Ryan savaged Scott's cornball
act and the timeliness of movie maven Gene Shalit's reviews. It
also faulted consumer reporters David Horowitz and Betty Furness
and medical reporter Dr. Art Ulene.
   Only Pauley escaped Gumbel's wrath. Ryan was succeeded by Tom
Capra, a longtime news producer, who was moving from California to
New York on Friday and could not be interviewed for this story.
   Gumbel, who declined to be interviewed, will be questioned by
Barbara Walters on ABC's ``20-20'' Friday in what should be a
benchmark among interviews of network anchors by other anchors.
   Walters made her own reputation on ``Today,'' which began Jan.
14, 1952, under the late Dave Garroway.
   While ``Today'' is losing viewers with the latest cast change,
there's a hitch for the network competitors.
   ``They're going elsewhere,'' Marans said. ``For the past eight
weeks, there hasn't been a significant increase in ABC or CBS
viewership.''
   So where are they going? Analysts suggest they're tuning in to
increasingly sophisticated local TV morning shows or disappearing
into the cable box.
   ABC's Reilly said the vanishing viewer has been a problem for
the networks for five years. ``There is no one alternative that
comes near (the networks), but collectively there are so many
options out there that people use them.''
