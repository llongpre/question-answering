<HEAD>``Good Morning America'' Host Heading to Saudi Arabia</HEAD>

   ``Good Morning America'' co-host Charles Gibson
is going to Saudi Arabia for live Thanksgiving week broadcasts from
U.S. military bases there and a Navy ship in the Persian Gulf, ABC
said Thursday.
   The five-day trip starts Nov. 19. It will be the second time a
network morning show star has broadcast from Saudi Arabia since the
U.S. military buildup began there after Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of
Kuwait.
   Bryant Gumble co-anchored NBC's ``Today'' show there for a week
of broadcasts beginning Aug. 17.
   ABC's expedition is more ambitious, partly because its show will
be freer to travel to U.S. military bases due to a loosening of
restrictions that were in force when Gumbel went there in the early
days of the U.S. buildup.
   Gibson, accompanied by a 16-member crew to include reporter
Steve Fox, will broadcast from two Army camps, an Air Force base,
and a Marine encampment, in addition to the as-yet unidentified
Navy ship. No specific locations can be announced yet because of
security regulations, ABC said.
   Co-host Joan Lunden will remain in New York, doing other
segments of each day's show.
   The show also will broadcast reunions - via satellite - of
members of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia with their families in the
United States.
   Since mid-August, NBC's ``Today'' each day has shown what its
staff has nicknamed ``Hi, Moms'' - tape-recorded greetings of U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia to their families and friends.
   ABC's announcement came as last week's Nielsens showed ``Good
Morning America'' first in ratings for network morning shows for
the 41st consecutive week, easily beating once-dominant ``Today.''
   ABC's show averaged a 4.7 rating, ``Today'' a 3.3 and ``CBS This
Morning'' a 2.6. Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.
