<HEAD>``Today'' Drops in Ratings, ``Good Morning America'' Gains</HEAD>

   NBC's ``Today,'' which is trying to rebound
against ABC's front-running ``Good Morning America,'' was the only
network morning show that failed to increase its ratings last week,
the A.C. Nielsen Co. said Friday.
   ``Today'' actually lost sixth-tenths of a ratings point as it
came in second to ``Good Morning America'' for the 35th consecutive
week, Nielsen said.
   ``Today,'' which rose to a 3.7 rating two weeks ago when anchor
Bryant Gumbel was reporting from the Middle East, slipped to a 3.1
last week.
   ABC's morning show showed a 10 percent increase in audience,
averaging a 4.3 rating, and ``CBS This Morning'' showed a slight
increase, getting a 2.5 rating. Each ratings point represents
931,000 homes.
   On Monday, the ``Today'' studio will inaugurate a new set.
   The show's ratings woes began before the departure of co-anchor
Jane Pauley and the January appointment of Deborah Norville as her
successor.
   On Tuesday, Norville announced that she is pregnant and expects
to give birth in March, but she did not say how long she would be
away from the show.
   Former ``Today'' co-host Joe Garagiola, 64, who rejoined the
show as a third co-anchor in June, left the show for four weeks on
Aug. 31 to undergo elective surgery for an undisclosed medical
problem.
