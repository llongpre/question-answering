<HEAD>Revamped ``Today'' Show Has Slight Ratings Increase</HEAD>

   NBC's revamped ``Today'' show had a slight
ratings increase in its first week, but ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' won the morning Nielsen race for the 24th straight week.
   Separately, ABC said that Joan Lunden, the permanent co-host on
``Good Morning America'' since 1980, has signed a five-year
contract to continue on the show. Her salary was not disclosed.
   Lunden joined ``Good Morning America'' in 1976 as a reporter and
temporary co-host.
   ``Good Morning America'' averaged a 4.0 rating last week, easily
beating ``Today,'' which averaged a 3.3, according to A.C. Nielsen
Co. figures released Thursday.
   ABC won despite the wide attention given to last week's return
of former ``Today'' host Joe Garagiola to NBC's show on a
three-day-a-week basis.
   The ratings for the new-look ``Today'' was up two-tenths of a
point from the previous week. The perenially third-place ``CBS This
Morning'' averaged a 2.3 rating. Each ratings point represents
921,000 homes.
