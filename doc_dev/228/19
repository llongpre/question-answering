   In an unusually frank comment Monday, ``CBS This
Morning'' co-anchor Kathleen Sullivan said ``my days are numbered''
at the program if its ratings, now third among network morning
shows, don't improve.
   Sullivan spoke while on the syndicated ``Donahue'' show with her
two female competitors on network morning programs, Joan Lunden of
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' and Jane Pauley, who is leaving
``Today'' at the end of this year.
   ``I can't lie about that _ I know the ax is right there,''
Sullivan said when asked by host Phil Donahue if she was feeling
the pressure of being on a program that is third in the ratings.
   The CBS News program, which Sullivan co-anchors with Harry
Smith, premiered on Nov. 30, 1987. It succeeded a short-lived,
low-rated entertainment show, and was the latest in CBS' long
effort to compete in the morning.
   Although Sullivan said her program's ratings have risen 50 per
cent since it began, she also said that if more viewers don't watch
``and we don't improve from where we are (in ratings), my days are
numbered.
   ``And I don't think there's a question about that. That's the
business. I know that. I'm a grownup.''
   Sullivan, who joined CBS from ABC, didn't elaborate. There was
no immediate comment from CBS.
   During Monday's show Pauley _ who last Friday told her national
``Today'' audience that she is leaving after 13 years and will be
succeeded by news anchor Deborah Norville _ reiterated that it was
her decision to leave.
   However, she said in response to a viewer's question, she
wouldn't be leaving as soon as she is had not Norville, whom she
has called a friend, been hired for the program. Norville became
its news anchor on Sept.5.
   ``No, I would not be leaving at this time because the shift in
attitude would have come along much more slowly,'' she said,
referring to her own attitude about leaving the top-rated program.
   ``It took some kind of an external jolt, if you will, to propel
me out of a course I had very happily travelled for 13 years,'' she
said.
   Pauley, whose current NBC News contract has been extended to
1992, will co-anchor a prime time news series that will premiere in
late June or early July. She also will anchor a prime-time special
called ``Changes'' in March.
