With some modest fanfare, Joan Lunden this week celebrates her 10th anniversary 
as co-host of ABC's "Good Morning America." This makes her somewhat 
extraordinary -- lasting in a job that is a people-eater. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say I'm surprised that I'm sitting here, being the person who has 
the most tenure on the morning shows," she says, referring to those in the 
co-host and co-anchor business. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like it was just yesterday that I was the new kid on the block." 
</P>
<P>
Her time on active dawn duty goes against tradition. Network morning show stars 
tend to be television's wandering tribe, often moving on because of their own 
decisions, management anxiety, or both. Within the last 12 months, six other 
such stars have left or found new homes, notably Jane Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
But Lunden -- who is only the third female co-host "Good Morning America" has 
had since it began in November, 1975 -- has stayed put. 
</P>
<P>
Married to television producer Michael Krauss, she's even managed to have three 
children in her time on the program. 
</P>
<P>
Lunden, who turns 40 next month and this summer signed a new five-year contract 
with ABC, says she hasn't had any desire to leave "Good Morning America." But 
then, her life on the show has been relatively serene. 
</P>
<P>
And her show, unlike "Today" and the shows that represent CBS' many years of 
efforts to make ratings in the morning, hasn't had the public turmoil of the 
kind that last year made "Today" a daily two-hour soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
Lunden, a ceaselessly cheery woman better known for warmth than penetrating 
interviews, hasn't even had a good headline-making incident, like former "CBS 
This Morning's" Kathleen Sullivan's off-air jabs at CBS management that made 
their way into print last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Good Morning America" was in second place to "Today," until late last year, 
when the veteran NBC program went through its much-publicized debacle, with 
Deborah Norville replacing Jane Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
As a result "Good Morning America" has been first for 33 consecutive weeks. But 
during its long stay in second, Lunden said, those on the show didn't get a lot 
of pressure from ABC brass, or those of Capital Cities, the network's new 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
"They really just said, 'Hey, go out there, enjoy it, be curious, and have a 
good time, " she said. "They said, 'If it works, the ratings will go up.' And 
they did."
