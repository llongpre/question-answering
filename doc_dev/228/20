   As millions of viewers grumble their way back
from summer vacations, NBC's ``Today'' show, armed with Faith, hope
and a new set, will attempt to rebound from The Great Debacle of
1989-90.
   The new set, featuring a kitchen and large transparent
photographs of various American scenes, premieres Monday.
   As for the show, its executive producer, Tom Capra, thinks the
worst is over and the ratings slide halted since the June additions
of Faith Daniels as news anchor and ``Today'' returnee Joe
Garagiola as a third co-anchor working with Bryant Gumbel and
Deborah Norville.
   But not even Capra predicts a quick return to the No. 1 ratings
status ``Today'' lost to ABC's ``Good Morning America'' in January
after the exit of the popular Jane Pauley and the arrival of
Norville.
   ``I think it'll take quite a while,'' said the producer, who was
brought in last January with seemingly simple marching orders:
``Fix it.''
   But nothing is simple in the world of the Morning Wars, where a
few ratings points can mean millions of dollars in losses or
profits, where revolving-door casting has jolted NBC and CBS into
the headlines, where ABC glories in its resurrection while
brandishing a new weapon _ a geography correspondent.
   ``Today'' hired Garagiola to give the show a feeling of
``family'' again. But even with the avuncular former catcher,
``Today'' suffered a summer week it would prefer to forget _ a 2.9
rating, its lowest in seven years.
   It has edged upwards since then. Still, ``Today'' ratings for
the period from January to mid-August are down 17 percent from last
year, according to Nielsen. Those of ``Good Morning America'' rose
by 10 percent, and third-place ``CBS This Morning'' also went up
slightly, by 4 percent.
   One week in May, CBS' show _ traditionally the morning doormat _
even beat ``Today'' in New York, the nation's largest TV market.
   ``Today'' had begun to slide in the ratings last summer before
the elevation of Norville, first as the show's news reader, then in
January as co-anchor with Gumbel. The perception by some viewers
that the 32-year-old Norville had somehow muscled the 40-year-old
Pauley aside made things worse.
   In June, NBC affiliates heard a frank ``we screwed up'' from NBC
News chief Michael Gartner. A month later, he admitted the ratings
slide may cost NBC $10 million and its affiliates an equal amount
by year's end.
   When would ``Today'' recapture the Nielsen championship from its
ABC rival? ``It's going to be many months,'' Capra said.
   He grinned. ``You can lose an audience a lot faster than you can
gain one. We certainly have have proved that. But we seem to have
stopped the (ratings) hemorrhaging here.''
   With Gumbel last month spending a week in Saudi Arabia,
anchoring his part of the show as part of NBC's coverage of the
Persian Gulf crisis, ``the ratings have settled out and are
creeping ahead a little,'' Capra said.
   But in the opinion of Betsy Frank, senior vice president of
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, the worst isn't over yet for
``Today.''
   ``It doesn't seem to have recovered,'' she said. Yes, she says,
the ratings rose in recent weeks, as they have for the show's two
network rivals, but that is largely due to public interest in the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   She says ``The particular drama of what happened on the `Today'
show last winter should have passed by now. Yet its ratings have
continued to decline while those of `Good Morning America' continue
to grow.''
   Erik Sorenson, executive producer of ``CBS This Morning,''
smells ``Today'' blood. ``We're very much in striking distance and
in some markets we're actually beating them,'' says Sorenson.
   His show debuted in November 1987 with the anchor team of Harry
Smith and Kathleen Sullivan. Although but a tyke compared to the
38-year-old ``Today'' and 15-year-old ``Good Morning America,'' the
CBS show already has had its shakeups.
   The major one was the replacement of Sullivan by ABC graduate
Paula Zahn last February. But the show also has added six new
contributors, including film reviewer Gene Siskel and sports
reporter Greg Gumbel, older brother of you-know-who.
   The show now has ``more diversity in the segments than there
used to be,'' Sorenson says. ``There are more entertainment
segments, more celebrity segments, and more pieces from
contributors.''
   Interestingly, there's been some change over at ``Good Morning
America.'' There are fewer celebrity interviews, even though the
show is produced by ABC's entertainment division, not its news
division.
   ``We still do them ... but not tve done it in
the past,'' says Jack Reilly, GMA's executive producer.
   The reason: A star blur of sorts that has come with o the degree we'the
growth
of cable, where celebrity interviewees are often found when not
being grilled by Connie Chung, Barbara Walters or a producer from
``Entertainment Tonight.''
   Star interviews used to be ``much more exclusive to morning
television'' 10 years ago, Reilly said.
   But ``now you hear that Arnold Schwarzenegger has a new movie
and you go, `Where did I see him? I don't know if I saw him on
``Good Morning America'' or ``Entertainment Tonight'' or CNN's
