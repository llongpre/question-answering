<HEAD>Sullivan: `Days are Numbered' At `CBS This Morning' Unless Ratings
Improve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   ``CBS This Morning'' co-anchor Kathleen Sullivan
said her job is in jeopardy if the ratings for her program don't
improve.
   ``I can't lie about that _ I know the ax is right there,''
Sullivan said when asked by Phil Donahue on his syndicated
``Donahue'' show if she was feeling the pressure of being on a
program with poor ratings _ now third among network morning shows.
   Sullivan appeared Monday with her two female competitors on
network morning programs, Joan Lunden of ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' and Jane Pauley, who is leaving ``Today'' at the end of
this year.
   The CBS program, which Sullivan co-anchors with Harry Smith,
premiered on Nov. 30, 1987. It was the latest in CBS' long effort
to compete in the morning.
   Sullivan said her program's ratings have risen 50 percent since
it began, but she added that if more viewers don't watch ``and we
don't improve from where we are (in ratings), my days are
numbered.''
   There was no immediate comment from CBS.
   During Monday's show Pauley _ who last Friday told her national
``Today'' audience that she is leaving after 13 years and will be
succeeded by news anchor Deborah Norville _ said if Norville hadn't
been hired, she wouldn't be leaving so soon.
   Norville became the show's news anchor on Sept.5.
   ``No, I would not be leaving at this time because the shift in
attitude would have come along much more slowly,'' she said,
referring to her own attitude about leaving the top-rated program.
   Pauley, whose current NBC News contract has been extended to
1992, will co-anchor a prime-time news series that will premiere in
late June or early July. She also will anchor a prime-time special
called ``Changes'' in March.
