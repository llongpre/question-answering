<HEAD>We Are Family, Hopes the `Today' Show</HEAD>

   During last week's NBC affiliates convention,
Deborah Norville faced station officials and said of the ``Today''
cast: ``This is a family. I'm sorry the print press doesn't see it
that way.''
   NBC hopes a more important audience _ viewers _ will see it that
way today as it re-launches ``Today'' with Joe Garagiola, Faith
Daniels and Katie Couric joining Norville, Bryant Gumbel, Willard
Scott and Gene Shalit on the troubled show.
   The network's We Are Family plan puts a lot of hope on the
addition of the gregarious Garagiola, 64, a popular ``Today''
co-host from 1969 to 1973. He'll join Gumbel and Norville as co-host
on Tuesdays through Thursdays.
   (The print press keeps calling them co-hosts. Wrong, NBC recently
has been emphasizing. Gumbel is the show's anchor. Norville and
Garagiola are co-anchors. Oh, the print press has said.)
   Daniels, late of CBS, will be the news anchor, while Couric, who
has a lively wit, will be the show's national correspondent based in
Washington, where one can find far more harrumph than humor.
   Only time will tell, as they say on TV, whether the newcomers and
NBC's image-rebuilding effort makes Nielsen families welcome the
show back to their bosoms, or at least to the people-meters in 4,000
homes.
   As all but the dead know, co-host Jane Pauley left the show in
December after 13 years. She was privately angered by ``Today''
changes that began last summer, but steadfastly has refused to blame
Norville, her successor.
   Since Pauley's exit, the previously top-rated ``Today'' has been
riding the crest of a slump.
   It has trailed ABC's ``Good Morning America'' for 22 weeks, its
year-to-date ratings are 17 percent below those of 1989, and they're
down 17 percent in what some consider a key demographic group _
women aged 18 to 49.
   That means uh-oh time. The ratings drop translates into millions
of dollars in lost advertising revenue for both NBC and its 209
affiliates.
   However, notes Betsy Frank, a senior vice president at Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Advertising in New York, the drop didn't start when Norville
became ``Today'' co-host in January, just five months after she
became its news anchor.
   The show's ratings were ``trending down even before the
`cataclysmic' Norville-Pauley change,'' she says.
   That's why NBC officials began tinkering with ``Today'' in the
first place _ to get the ratings back up. Alas, they foaled only a
public relations nightmare and failure.
   In Round Two of tinkering, the hiring of old pro Garagiola came
as a surprise, particularly to those expecting NBC to commit
thirtysomething video voodoo to win back those younger,
demographically desirable female viewers.
   But the bald, affable former major league catcher probably will
do that, says Tom Capra, a ``Today'' rookie. He became the show's
executive producer in January.
   ``I think he's kind of an Everyman,'' Capra says. ``Everyone
likes Joe _ younger women, old men, everybody. He's just kind of a
universal figure.''
   Capra tends to scoff at those who write of the women 18-to-49 age
group as if that group were to morning ratings what oxygen is to
life its ownself.
   He'd like to have that audience watching ``Today,'' he says, but
it ``is not gigantic in the morning on any show.'' And, he says,
``Our show, as are all the other morning shows, is sold on the basis
of households as well as demographics.''
   ``We also think that our core `Today' audience is still loyal to
us,'' Capra says, ``and just isn't watching us as often as they used
to. So we believe that the addition of Joe will cause them to come
home.''
   Frank says NBC, in seeking the top ``Today'' ratings of
yesteryear, is hoping to ``recapture some of that warmth and family
appeal'' the show once had.
   ``Garagiola seems to be a pretty good choice,'' she says. ``But
my question is ... whether people, for whatever reason, have not
gotten into the `Good Morning America' habit. And whether the
addition of Joe is enough to bring `Today' back.''
