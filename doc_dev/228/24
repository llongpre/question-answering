<HEAD>ABC's `Good Morning America' Scores Third Straight Victory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the third consecutive week, ABC`s ``Good
Morning America'' last week beat NBC's ``Today'' show in ratings,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates released Thursday.
   In what has become a tight morning-show battle since Jane Pauley
left as co-host of ``Today'' last month, ABC's show averaged a 4.4
rating, ``Today'' a 3.9, and ``CBS This Morning'' a 2.5. Each
ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   An ABC spokeswoman said the victory of ``Good Morning America''
was the first time the show had won three consecutive weeks since
fall of 1987. But a ``Today'' spokeswoman expressed optimism that
NBC's show would again be No. 1, saying ``it's only a matter of
time.''
   On Monday, NBC's program will get a new executive producer, Tom
Capra. He is the former news director of NBC-owned KNBC-TV in
Burbank, Calif.
