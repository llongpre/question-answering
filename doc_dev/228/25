   ABC`S ``Good Morning America'' again triumphed
over NBC's ``Today'' show, averaging a 4.5 rating last week against
the 3.8 of ``Today,'' A.C. Nielsen Co. audience estimates showed
Thursday.
   ``CBS This Morning'' remained a distant third with a 2.6 rating.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   ABC's victory marked the fifth consecutive week it has beaten
``Today,'' which in attempting to fend off ABC's challenge has
undergone a series of changes, including the much-publiziced
departure of Jane Pauley in December.
   Pauley, the show's co-host for 13 years, was succeeded by
Deborah Norville, who had been the program's news anchor since
September.
   The longest previous winning stretch of `Good Morning America''
over once-dominant ``Today'' occurred in October and November 1987,
when ABC's show won its morning time period for six straight weeks.
