   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' last week had its
largest audience in more than four years and won the ratings race
for network morning shows for the 45th consecutive week.
   A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates on Thursday showed ABC's program won
easily over NBC's ``Today,'' averaging a 5.2 rating to a 3.5. ``CBS
This Morning'' had a 2.6 rating. Each ratings point represents
931,000 homes.
   Ratings were up for ``Good Morning'' and ``Today.'' NBC's
once-dominant show fell behind ``Good Morning'' in January after
the much-publicized replacement of co-anchor Jane Pauley by Deborah
Norville.
   Last week's ratings for ``Good Morning America'' were the show's
highest since the week that ended April 21, 1986, ABC said. The
show also had a 5.2 rating then, but a ratings point at that time
represented 859,000 homes.
