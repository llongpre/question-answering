   After 13 years of predawn ``Today'' wakeups,
co-host Jane Pauley confirmed to a national audience this morning
that she's leaving the NBC show at year's end. She hugged her
successor, Deborah Norville, and gave her an alarm clock.
   Pauley's farewell announcement, in which she said she'll most
miss working with co-host Bryant Gumbel, was preceded by his
comments in which he criticized ``idle and often erroneous
speculation'' about the troubled, top-rated show.
   Gumbel said the speculation had been ``much to the detriment of
all of us here.''
   Pauley had been reported to be unhappy at recent changes on the
show, including the Sept. 5 arrival of Norville as its news anchor,
succeeding John Palmer.
   Referring to Pauley as ``my buddy'' and that ``it goes without
saying that I'm going to miss her,'' Gumbel said that she's leaving
the show ``sometime at the end of this year or January of next
year.''
   Pauley, who turns 39 on Tuesday, has two years remaining on an
NBC contract reportedly paying her $1.2 million annually. She is
going to co-anchor a prime-time news series next year, she said in
an interview after the show.
   In the interview, she confirmed what she had alluded to in the
show, that she had in fact had asked to leave it.
   She said there were a number of changes that had been made that
had worried her, and Norville's arrival and Palmer's departure to
the earlier ``NBC News at Sunrise'' was only one of them. She said
she also thought that NBC executives wanted her to leave.
   She said she had had ``tough'' talks with NBC News President
Michael Gartner and NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol, who wears a
second hat overseeing ``Today.''
   Initially, she said, ``we didn't believe each other. They did
not believe that I simply wanted to leave the `Today' show. And I
did not believe that they were committed to my future here at NBC.''
   But eventually, she said, each side reached an understanding and
a deal was worked out for her to leave ``Today'' at the end of the
year and co-anchor a new, as-yet untitled prime time news series
that will premiere next June. The other co-anchor hasn't been
chosen, she said.
   During the show, she said that persuading NBC that it was time
for a change of staff on ``Today'' was ``the hardest thing I have
ever done. It has taken two long months.''
   She took pains to play down reports she was at odds with either
Gumbel or Norville, saying ``it has hurt to see two of my friends,
Bryant and Deborah, assigned roles in this that they did not play.''
   Pauley joined ``Today'' in 1976 when she left NBC-owned WMAQ-TV
in Chicago to succeed Barbara Walters.
   Pauley noted that when she joined the show, her prececessor, the
first full-time female anchor on the 36-year-old program, sent her
a telegram wishing her good luck and a good alarm clock. Then
Pauley smiled, gave Norville an alarm clock, and the two hugged.
   Norville praised Pauley, saying ``You're a tough act to repeat
and I won't even try.''
   Before the show went to a commercial, she, Gumbel and Norville
held hands in a nationally televised show of solidarity.
   No decision has been made on who will succeed Norville, 31, as
anchor of the two-hour program's news segments. The former anchor
of the earlier ``NBC News at Sunrise,'' she swapped jobs last month
with Palmer.
   Although ``Today'' consistently has led in morning-show ratings
over its closest competitor, ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
turmoil on NBC's program began early this year with the leak of a
scathing memo from Gumbel.
   The memo, while not mentioning Pauley, criticized several staff
members on the show, particularly weatherman Willard Scott.
   Scott has eased off the pointed jokes he made to and about
Gumbel after the memo's disclosure, and he denied on Wednesday
speculation that he'll leave ``Today'' shortly after Pauley does.
He joined the show in 1980.
   Gumbel became a ``Today'' co-host in January 1982. Norville
joined NBC News and its ``NBC News at Sunrise'' five years later
from the network's Chicago station.
   This summer, she signed a five-year contract reportedly worth $1
million a year.
