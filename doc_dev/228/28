Rooms</HEAD>

   Joan Lunden, co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' show, has been signed to serve a similar role for a new
television program that Whittle Communications plans to put in
medical waiting rooms this fall.
   Lunden has signed a three-year contract to host Special Reports
Television, a commercially-sponsored TV show that premieres in
October.
   Whittle Communications, based in Knoxville, Tenn., expects the
one-hour program will be airing continuously in 20,000 doctor's
reception areas by January, reaching an annual audience of nearly
50 million viewers, mainly young mothers.
   The company is now approaching advertisers about buying
commercial time on the programs and is recruiting doctors who will
let it put its television set in their waiting rooms and will play
the program through the working day.
   The programs will be distributed on videodiscs and new programs
will be made available every two weeks.
   Lunden was quoted as saying she views the service as ``a vehicle
to deliver vital family information and news directly to parents.''
   ``That makes it a very worthwhile project,'' she said.
   She joined ``Good Morning America'' in 1976 as a consumer
reporter and became co-host in 1980.
   Last fall, she became the host of a nationally syndicated
daytime talk show called ``Everyday.'' She has hosted videos and a
TV special on parenting.
   She and her husband have three daughters.
