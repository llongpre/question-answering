   Upbeat but appearing near tears, Kathleen
Sullivan said farewell today as co-anchor of ``CBS This Morning,''
telling viewers that she's proud of the show and jokingly asking
them not to forget her.
   Sullivan, who has been on the show with Harry Smith since it
began in November 1987, also confirmed in her farewell what CBS
spokesmen thus far have refused to comment on _ that ABC's Paula
Zahn will succeed her.
   ``Paula Zahn has been the stepmother to two of my other children
at ABC, and now I'm sure she'll take great care of my third, `CBS
This Morning,''' Sullivan said in her final day on the show, which
originated today from Disney World in Orlando, Fla.
   Before joining CBS, Sullivan co-anchored ABC's ``World News This
Morning'' and the news segments of ``Good Morning America.'' She
was succeeded on those programs by Zahn, who bid viewers of those
shows goodbye on Thursday.
   Their back-to-back farewell addresses came about after CBS News
executives decided to replace Sullivan, whose contract expires in
November. According to her agent, Ron Konecky, they gave no reason.
He said he is discussing other possibilities for her at the network.
   Zahn's agent has confirmed that his client is joining CBS News.
According to a source close to her contract talks, ABC officials
liked her work but decided against battling CBS' offer of a $1.1
million-a-year, four-year contract.
   Zahn, who had been earning $275,000 a year at ABC, could start
co-anchoring CBS' show as early as Feb. 26, according to another
source knowledgeable about negotiations for her switch to CBS.
   CBS has said that Faith Daniels, who co-anchors the ``CBS
Morning News'' that precedes ``CBS This Morning,'' will be the
latter program's temporary co-anchor next week.
   Sullivan, whom Smith today thanked ``for being such a great
friend and such a great teacher'' during her stay on the show, told
viewers that ``I'm very proud of what we've accomplished here in
the last 2{ years.
   ``We've restored the credibility that said we meant business in
the morning here at CBS.''
   That was an indirect reference her program's predecessor, ``The
Morning Show,'' a frothy, short-lived entertainment show that CBS
tried after years of generally failing to make a dent in the
ratings with a morning news program.
   Although there were cheers at CBS News when the division got the
morning time period back and put in ``CBS This Morning,'' the
program still is a distant third in ratings to the top-rated ``Good
Morning America'' and NBC's ``Today.''
   Sullivan, noting that eight of her 10 years on national
television have been spent on morning shows, told viewers that she
plans to take a break and that ``I'm hoping to do some really wild
and wonderful things.''
   She didn't elaborate, but added: ``So, if I show up on your
doorstep because I ran out of gas or my horse broke down, please
don't forget me.''
   Sullivan began her television career as an intern in 1977 at Los
Angeles station KNXT-TV, which is owned by CBS and now has the call
letters of KCBS-TV.
   Alluding to the Olympics telecasts she co-anchored while at ABC,
she wryly concluded her farewell by saying, ``Yeah, I'm the one who
wore the sweaters in the Olympics... I'm a bit older, but I'm also
a bit wiser.''
