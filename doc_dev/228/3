   It's a little before 7 a.m. and weatherman
Spencer Christian gestures at the bright blue backdrop while the
magic of television cooks up the maps and graphics you see at home.
   ``Good Morning America,'' which celebrates its 15th birthday
Friday, is about to go onto the air. Christian is doing the weather
wrapup for ABC's early morning news, which originates in another
studio.
   If you don't get into live TV studios very often, the surreal
aspects of a grown man gesturing at a blank wall are quite droll.
If you don't get up that early, it's not funny. It's not funny at
all.
   ``You never get over the adversity of sleep deprivation,'' he
tells a bleary-eyed visitor, smiling broadly. ``Imagine getting up
every morning at 3:45 a.m., no matter what you've done the night
before.''
   Maybe it would make you gesture at blank walls, eh?
   Since Nov. 2, 1975, ``GMA'' has originated from the soothing
dimness of ABC's cavernous Television Studio Number Two off Central
Park on Manhattan's lower Upper West Side.
   The show, with host David Hartman and co-host Nancy Dussault,
was designed by ABC's entertainment division as a lighter,
feature-driven competitor for NBC News' aging ``Today'' show, which
had been on the air since Jan. 14, 1952.
   The new show beat ``Today'' in the ratings, but ``Today'' got
anchor Bryant Gumbel in 1982 and fought its way back on top.
Hartman, who left in 1987, is expected back on TV in 1991 with a
syndicated, weekday magazine show.
   ``Today'' was No. 1 from 1985 on, with ``GMA'' a strong second
overall, beating the NBC show in key markets and demographic
groups. By 1989, ``Today'' was fading and ``GMA'' gaining.
   Gumbel's infamous 1989 memorandum blasting other ``Today''
talent made public the show's internal strains. When executives
engineered the departure of popular and longtime co-host Jane
Pauley, ``Today'' slipped into No. 2.
   It's stayed there for 43 consecutive weeks.
   Today there's laughter and easy banter on the ``GMA'' set. Its
cocoa browns, pink pastels and blond furniture are as familiar to
some Americans as their own living rooms - and much more
comfortable at 7 a.m.
   The co-hosts settle into the tan couch before two big, low-slung
cameras, cross-angled for head-and-shoulders shots. The floor
director relays the countdown, silent for the last three seconds.
The camera's red light goes on.
   ``Good Morning, America, I'm Joan Lunden,'' she says.
   ``And I'm Charles Gibson,'' he says, and another edition of
``Good Morning America'' has begun.
   Two hours later, Gibson has interviewed White House chief of
staff John Sununu; Ms. Lunden has interviewed a Houston woman cited
for using a stadium men's room. And the final, hour-long segment of
a series on AIDS has aired.
   The showis over and Ms. Lunden, Gibson and Christian are
relaxing on the set. None of them has been with the show from the
start.
   Ms. Lunden began as a consumer reporter in 1980. Christian
joined in 1986, and Gibson took over from Hartman in 1987. With the
departure of Jane Pauley, Ms. Lunden has become the longest-serving
woman on morning television.
   ``I live here,'' she said. ``I just come down in the morning and
dust off the sofa.''
   All three acknowledge that their show's stability has
contributed to its dominance in the ratings.
   ``I think at this time period in the morning, stability and
consistency is always crucial,'' Ms. Lunden said. ``People ...
don't like change. It's that one time period of the day that you
don't have the freedom to fool around with it and change things.''
   And the easygoing amiability that emanates from them doesn't
fade when the camera goes dark. They seem genuinely to like one
another.
   ``Are we conscious of the fact that it's necessary to maintain a
harmonious relationship?'' said Gibson. ``Absolutely. Sure. You
have to sublimate your ego, which for Spencer and I is very easy,
but for Joan is very difficult.''
   Barruump-bump!
   ``You talk about moody!'' Christian pitches in. ``We never know
which Joan Lunden's going to show up! You talk about the seven
faces of Eve, how about the 15 faces of ....'' The laughter bubbles
out of them.
   It's good to be No. 1 in the morning ratings, Gibson said, but
no one assumes ``GMA'' can't get knocked out of the top slot.
   ``It'll happen,'' he said. ``People will get tired of us and
we'll move off. And hopefully we'll be as sanguine about moving in
another direction as we were about the move up.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   ``HAMLET'' RETURNS TO PBS - Kevin Kline stars tonight on PBS in
William Shakespeare's tragedy of Hamlet, a prince of Denmark.
   It's also his debut as a director on television, in the role
that won him an Obie award when he directed himself in the title
role onstage.
   This sumptuous modern-dress TV production, is a fine piece of
work, beautifully adapted to the strengths and limitations of
television. It's dark, intimate, obsessive.
   Tune in.
