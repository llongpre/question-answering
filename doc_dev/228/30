<LEADPARA>  THE mommy track gets more crowded every day in network television.;    First
there was Connie Chung, who abandoned a shot at weekly prime time at CBS,
saying she'd rather be pregnant than famous. Then there was Meredith Vieira,
cutting her hours and eventually being released from "60 Minutes" because she
is pregnant.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NORVILLE TAKES HER 'ONE CHANCE' TO BE WITH
BABY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Now comes Deborah Norville, leaving NBC's "Today" show to stay home for a
year with her baby, born in February.;    Ironically, Katie Couric, who was
named as Norville's successor Thursday, will be taking a two-month maternity
leave of her own in mid-July.;    Norville, who joined NBC at its owned
affiliate in Chicago in 1981, has had a stormy tenure as co-host on "Today"
since she took over the job in January of last year.;    She replaced Jane
Pauley in a network move widely perceived to be a betrayal of Pauley, and the
show's ratings plunged, leaving "Today" a runner-up to ABC's "Good Morning
America.";    Norville became a media target as "the other woman" in the
ensuing flap. Last month, when she was pictured breast-feeding her baby in
People magazine, she touched off another round of controversy.;    During
Couric's substitute duties, "Today" show ratings slowly began to grow, and
they have been within a fraction of a point of "Good Morning America" for the
past four weeks.;    Norville, however, sought to make clear that leaving the
show was her own idea.;    "During the past month away from my day-to-day
responsibilities, I've had time to reflect on the tumultuous last year and a
half," she said in a statement. "Perhaps my personal situation -- being a new
mother away from the spotlight -- has allowed me to see clearly what I want to
do: give my son the best possible start on life and practice good journalism.;
   "There is plenty of time for the latter, but I'll get only one chance to do
the former.";    NBC officials refused to discuss contractual details of
Norville's departure, including whether or not she will remain on the payroll
or be invited to return. A spokesman would say only that "she continues to
have an arrangement with NBC News.";    Norville has proven herself a valuable
prime-time asset. Two of her NBC specials, "Kids and Sports: Taking the Risk,"
in December, and "Sex, Buys and Advertising," in July, reaped high ratings.
"Bad Girls," broadcast in 1989, covering the increasing tendency of girls to
turn to crime, remains the highest-ranked news documentary in television
history.;    But does all that mean Norville will be welcome back on NBC?;   
"Barbara Walters could drop out of sight for a year and come back and never
miss a beat," said Joe Foote, chairman of the Department of Radio-Television
at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and a specialist in the study of
the "visibility factor" among television news correspondents. "A star can
survive.;    "The question is, is Norville a star? Does she have that
certified staying power? If she has that, a year away isn't going to hurt her.
If she doesn't have that, she's in an insecure position."  </TEXT>
