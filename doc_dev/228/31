   NBC's ``Today'' show, temporarily in Los Angeles
and bathed in sunshine, may be making some viewers wonder how it
got the sun to rise so early _ since it is 4 a.m. on the West Coast
when the show starts in the East.
   It did it through the magic of videotape. Each morning's show
actually was taped the previous day at 3:30 p.m. PST, spokeswoman
Mary Neagoy said Thursday. Only its news segments were live.
   ``Today,'' normally seen live in Eastern and Central times
zones, originated on tape Wednesday and Thursday from a sunny beach
location at Venice, Ca.
   It will appear Friday, again on tape, from a historic Spanish
section in downtown Los Angeles.
   In the two broadcasts so far, co-host Bryant Gumbel has advised
viewers the shows were taped a day earlier ``to take advantage of
the California sunshine,'' Neagoy said.
   He will repeat the tape-delay advisory on Friday's show, she
added.
   The shows planned for Monday and Tuesday _ each centers on the
Oscar Awards ceremonies that ABC will televise Monday night _ will
be broadcast live, although not in the pre-dawn darkness.
   The shows will originate from inside Mann's Chinese Theater in
Hollywood, Neagoy said.
   Despite its taped sunshine this week, ``Today,'' once the leader
in morning show ratings, found a continuing cause for gloom when
last week's audience estimates for morning shows became available
Thursday.
   The show, which in January dropped to second place after the
replacement of co-host Jane Pauley by Deborah Norville, trailed
ABC's first-place ``Good Morning America'' for the 11th consecutive
week.
   ABC's broadcast averaged a 4.5 rating, ``Today'' was a full
ratings point behind, and ``CBS This Morning'' had a 2.5 average,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.
