   ``Good Morning America,'' ABC's top-rated
morning show, will broadcast from Saudi Arabia during Thanksgiving
week.
   Co-host Charles Gibson, accompanied by a 16-member crew that
includes reporter Steve Fox, will broadcast from two Army camps, an
Air Force base, a Marine camp and a Navy ship in the Persian Gulf,
the network said.
   Co-host Joan Lunden will remain in New York.
   The five-day trip starts Nov. 19.
   It marks the second time a network morning show star has
broadcast from Saudi Arabia since the U.S. military buildup began
there. Bryant Gumble co-anchored NBC's ``Today'' show there for a
week of broadcasts that began on Aug. 17.
   Thousands of U.S. troops have been in the region since Iraq
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
