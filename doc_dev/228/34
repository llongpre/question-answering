<HEAD>NBC's ``Today'' Gets Lowest Ratings in Nearly Seven Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Despite a revamped format and the return of Joe
Garagiola as co-host, NBC's ``Today'' show last week suffered its
lowest ratings in nearly seven years, according to Nielsen audience
estimates Thursday.
   While ABC's ``Good Morning America'' won its 29th consecutive
ratings victory with a 4.2 average, ``Today'' was well behind with
a 2.9, its lowest average since the week of Aug. 6, 1983, when it
had a 2.8 average.
   ``CBS This Morning'' show remained a distant third with a 2.2
average. All three shows declined by a tenth of a point from the
previous week.
   ``Today'' is attempting to recover from a ratings slide that
began in January after 13-year veteran Jane Pauley left the show.
She was its co-host when it hit its previous ratings low in 1983.
   As part of its comeback bid, ``Today'' added the popular
Garagiola as a third co-host in June, has moved to a larger studio
at NBC headquarters, and plans another change in September, a new
set.
   Comparisons for ratings for last week and the same week in 1989
show that ``Good Morning America'' increased its audience by a big
margin, 420,000 homes, while ``Today'' audience was down by 754,000
homes.
   The ratings for ``CBS This Morning'' were unchanged, but the
show was seen in 37,400 more homes than in the same week last year.
   A ratings point currently represents 921,000 homes, compared
with 904,000 homes last year.
