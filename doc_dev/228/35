<HEAD>NBC Reshuffles Slumping `Today' Show, Brings Joe Garagiola Back as
Co-Host</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   In a surprise move aimed to revived its slumping
``Today'' show, NBC said today that Joe Garagiola, a familiar face
from the show's past, would join Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville
as a co-host.
   NBC also hired Faith Daniels, co-anchor of the ``CBS Morning
News'' and news segments of ``CBS This Morning,'' to anchor ``NBC
News at Sunrise'' and the news segments of ``Today.''
   Garagiola was a host of the show from 1969 to 1973. He will
return to the show in June.
   The network also announced that Dick Ebersol, who played a
leading part in changes that preceded the ``Today'' drop into
second place, is giving up his job as senior vice president in
charge of ``Today.''
   He will stay as president of NBC Sports, the network said.
   Ebersol came into the turbulent ``Today'' picture last year, and
is widely held responsible for the controversial shift in which
Norville succeeded 13-year veteran Jane Pauley as the show's host
in January.
   Since then, the once-dominant program has run second in ratings
to ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   The new shifts come just three weeks before NBC executives are
to face the network's affiliates at NBC's annual convention in
Washington, where NBC News president Michael Gartner likely will
hear complaints.
   ``It is no secret that in recent months `Today' has been through
some trouubled times,'' Gartner said in a statement today. He said
the latest moves were designed ``to expand the cast and build on
the strengths of the program.''
   The network also said that correspondent Katie Couric will
become a full-time correspondent for ``Today'' in Washington, D.C.
