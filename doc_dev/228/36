   NBC, hoping the past of ``Today'' will help its
tomorrows, said Tuesday it is bringing back Joe Garagiola as a
co-host in a shakeup to help pull the talk show out of a ratings
slump.
   Also Tuesday, NBC hired Faith Daniels as ``Today'' news anchor,
and Dick Ebersol, the network executive behind a series of moves
that preceded the slump, said he was giving up his job as overseer
of the program.
   Garagiola, the show's host from 1969 to 1973, will work with
Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville.
   NBC's surprise announcement comes at a time the once top-rated
show has been sliding deeper into second place in ratings after the
series of changes, including the replacement of Jane Pauley by
Norville in Janary.
   Since then, ``Today'' has trailed ABC's ``Good Morning America''
in the ratings, with the ``CBS Morning News'' a consistent third.
   Garagolia, a popular NBC sportscaster until he left the network
in 1988, will start work in June, as will Daniels, who has been on
maternity leave since the March 25 birth of her second child.
   Daniels, co-anchor of early-morning newscasts at CBS since 1985,
will anchor news segments on ``Today'' and anchor the earlier ``NBC
News at Sunrise.''
   NBC correspondent Katie Couric also was assigned as the
full-time ``Today'' correspondent in Washington, D.C.
   Ebersol said he was giving up his job as the senior executive in
charge of ``Today.'' He'll continue as NBC Sports president and as
a senior NBC News vice president.
   ``Almost all the furor of recent months concerning `Today' has
revolved around my decisions of last fall, and I believe I must
take the primary responsibility for those decisions,'' said Ebersol.
   The uproar began in September when Norville displaced veteran
correspondent John Palmer, a friend of Pauley, as the ``Today''
news anchor, and was moved to the show's desk to sit alongside
Pauley and Gumbel.
   Pauley, who has refused to blame Norville for anything,
reportedly was angered by the moves and finally asked to leave the
show.
   An embarrassed NBC granted her wish. She left in December after
13 years to do prime-time news specials this year and anchor the
``NBC Nightly News'' when Tom Brokaw is on assignment or vacation.
   Tuesday's ``Today'' shuffle came five days after NBC News
president Michael Gartner, also concerned about low ratings for
``NBC Nightly News,'' made another surprise move, hiring Steve
Friedman as that program's executive producer.
   The brash, wise-cracking Friedman was executive producer of
``Today'' when it rose to first in ratings.
   The ``Today'' and ``Nightly'' changes were made three weeks
before NBC affiliates hold their annual convention in Washington.
   A network executive speaking on condition of anonymity said it's
likely that many affiliate executives, while pleased with NBC's
prime-time success, will sharply criticize Gartner for the ratings
woes of the two news shows.
   There was no reply by Gartner to a reporter's request for a
phone interview. In a statement Tuesday, he admitted that ``it is
no secret that in recent months `Today' has been through some
troubled times.
   ``The departure of Jane Pauley left people with a loss of the
sense of family which has been valued throughout the years on
`Today.' These additions are designed to expand the cast and build
on the strengths of the program.''
   He also engaged in self-criticism in referring to the way
Pauley's exit and Norville's entrance were handled.
   ``In hindsight,'' he said, ``NBC News management put ...
Norville in a difficult position, resulting in a more arduous
transition than we had anticipated.''
