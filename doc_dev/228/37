<LEADPARA>  IT WILL be another case of anchors away as the evening and morning stars of
television news follow the frequently flying President Bush to Moscow to cover
the summit meetings with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which begin
today.;    ABC, CBS and NBC will all conduct their nightly newscasts from the
Soviet capital at least for today and Wednesday, with anchors Peter Jennings,
Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw on hand. Additional coverage will be provided by the
network morning shows, with two of them sending staffers to Moscow.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And CNN, too;  CNN will have live updates from Moscow each day at 9 a.m.,
11 a.m., 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. local time. CNN personnel in Moscow include Bernard
Shaw, Ralph Begleiter, Charles Bierbauer, Frances Hardin, Steve Hurst and
Eileen O'Connor.;    First Lady Barbara Bush is scheduled on Wednesday to
discuss her impressions of the changes in the Soviet Union with Charles
Gibson, co-host of ABC's "Good Morning America." At other times this week,
"Good Morning America" correspondent Steve Fox will report on Moscow's
McDonald's fast-food restaurant, Soviet night life and the rise of mysticism
and religious freedom.;    "CBS This Morning" co-host Paula Zahn also will be
in Moscow, but the network was unable to provide specific coverage plans.;   
Shevardnadze interview;  NBC's "Today" will not be sending a reporter or host,
but the show is scheduled to present Brokaw's interview with former Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Tuesday's first half-hour.;    The
summit comes during a year in which the news divisions at the three major
broadcast networks have been squeezed by reduced revenues and increased costs.  </TEXT>
