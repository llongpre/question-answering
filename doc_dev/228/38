   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' garnered its 16th
consecutive ratings victory Thursday and for the second time in a
month, NBC's once-dominant ``Today'' had its lowest ratings in
nearly three years.
   ABC's show averaged a 4.3 rating last week, the same as for the
previous week. But second-place ``Today'' dropped by two-tenths of
a ratings point to a 3.3 average last week, according to A.C.
Nielsen Co. audience estimates.
   ``Today'' had the same 3.3 average in the week ending April 2.
An NBC official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that was
the show's lowest rating since August 1983.
   The show's ratings decline and the rise of ``Good Morning
America'' began in January, when Deborah Norville succeeded Jane
Pauley as co-host of ``Today.''
   ``CBS This Morning'' remained a distant third in last week's
ratings, averaging a 2.4. Each ratings point represents 921,000
homes.
