Kathleen Sullivan believes her days "are numbered" as co-anchor of "CBS This 
Morning" if the show's ratings don't improve. The CBS program is now third 
among network morning shows. Sullivan made her comments on a "Donahue" show 
(seen here Tuesday) that paired her with her opposition, Joan Lunden of ABC's 
"Good Morning America" and Jane Pauley, who is leaving NBC's "Today" at the end 
of this year. "I can't lie about that -- I know the ax is right there," 
Sullivan said. ALEENE MacMINN
