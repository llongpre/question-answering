   NBC's slumping ``Today'' show lost to ABC's
``Good Morning America'' in ratings ``sweeps'' for the first time
since November 1985, according to audience estimates made public
Thursday.
   In the Feb. 1-28 sweeps, ABC's show, which has won the ratings
race for the last nine weeks, averaged a 4.5 rating. ``Today'' had
a 3.65 average and third-place ``CBS This Morning'' a 2.7. Each
rating point represents 921,000 homes.
   NBC executives have said they expected ``Today'' ratings to dip
after co-host Jane Paley was succeeded by Deborah Norville in
January. They say that also happened when Bryant Gumbel succeeded
Tom Brokaw on the show in 1982.
   However, February's figures show a considerable drop for
``Today,'' whose troubles include the leak last year of Gumbel's
caustic memo about some staff members, and controversy over
Pauley's replacement by Norville.
   Last year, when a ratings point represented 904,000 homes,
``Today'' won the February sweeps with a 4.6 average, followed
closely by ``Good Morning America'' with a 4.2. ``CBS This
Morning'' averaged a 2.6 then.
   The sweeps occur four times a year and are periods of intense
audience measurements in the nations's 211 TV markets, according to
the A.C. Nielsen Co. They are important to local stations, which
use the results to set their advertising rates.
