<TEXT>     Police said McGee and four others received disorderly-conduct citations
after they blew whistles and created a disturbance as the national television
show taped its morning program before about 300 people at a park near Lake
Michigan.;    "Good Morning" co-host Joan Lunden had just begun listing the
city's highlights when McGee shouted that Milwaukee had homeless and hungry
residents. The whistles could be heard on the program, but McGee did not
appear on camera.;    Lunden and co-host Charles Gibson did not comment
directly on the incident, but Gibson alluded to it, saying there were
differing views about the city's quality.;    The five protesters were taken
to a police station, given citations that carry a $109 fine and were released,
police said.;    "I set out to embarrass Milwaukee. I was pretty successful
doing that," McGee said later at a Common Council meeting.;    McGee, 41, last
year formed a Black Panther Militia he says has about 500 activists and youth
gang members. He has threatened to use the group to conduct terrorist attacks
in 1995 if conditions do not improve for inner-city minorities.  </TEXT>
