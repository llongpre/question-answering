It's as simple as ABC. From sunup to sundown, and into prime time, ABC 
Television is on the rise in both news and entertainment -- the network to 
watch as the 1990s get under way. 
</P>
<P>
Already cheered for such ventures as "Roseanne," "The Wonder Years" and "Twin 
Peaks," ABC is in fact cutting a much wider swath through the competition. Both 
its wake-up show, "Good Morning America," and Peter Jennings' evening wrap-up, 
"World News Tonight," have totally dominated the opposition on NBC and CBS 
since the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
As TV's official ratings season ended this week, ABC was still second to NBC in 
prime time -- but it was also the only one of the Big Three networks that 
didn't experience an audience decline from the previous year. Its median viewer 
age, 37, was preferable to sponsors over those of NBC (40) and CBS (45). 
</P>
<P>
And ABC's dreams of toppling NBC in the next few years didn't seem so wild with 
"America's Funniest Home Videos" turning into a runaway hit and -- a big 
question mark -- Oprah Winfrey, the unbeatable daytime star, ready in the wings 
with her new series, "Brewster Place." It debuts on ABC during the May ratings 
sweeps that begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
While ABC has a battle royal on its hands against NBC in prime time, it is 
simply running away from the competition in the prestigious races for 
morning-show and nightly news domination. "Good Morning America," already on 
the rise as last year drew to a close, was positioned perfectly to take the 
lead when NBC, in one of the dumbest executive decisions in TV memory, 
virtually forced Jane Pauley into resigning from the "Today" program by 
showcasing Deborah Norville as her obvious successor. 
</P>
<P>
"Today" now has lost to "Good Morning America" in the ratings every week this 
year -- in short, since Pauley quit and Norville replaced her. "Today" is also 
losing viewers steadily, and because of the incomprehensible move to break up a 
show that didn't need fixing in the first place, NBC reportedly is facing a 
drop in income from the series as well. 
</P>
<P>
With ABC's Charles Gibson and Joan Lunden comfortably in place as hosts of 
"Good Morning America," NBC and "Today" may need at least several years to win 
viewers over to the new team of Bryant Gumbel and Norville, if past patterns of 
this competition hold firm. And if Gumbel or Norville should leave "Today," it 
could take longer and make ABC's lead all the more secure. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening news competition, Jennings undoubtedly is benefitting from the 
fact that ABC's prime-time shows and overall reputation are stronger than those 
of last-place CBS, where his competitor, Dan Rather, has also suddenly 
plummeted from the lead. Furthermore, ABC's growing prestige as network TV's 
finest and deepest news organization -- with such other names as Ted Koppel, 
David Brinkley and Barbara Walters -- has certainly also helped Jennings surge 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening now is that ABC is seeing, on a vast scale, the 
coming-together of the efforts over the years of three executives who helped 
turn the network from a cellar-dwelling joke to an organization now poised to 
lord it over all of TV if it can finally unseat NBC in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
One of these executives, Roone Arledge, gave ABC the "Wide World of Sports" 
series three decades ago, "Monday Night Football" two decades ago and 
"Nightline" one decade ago. Arledge, who brought ABC a lasting identification 
with excellence in TV sports coverage -- "Monday Night Football" ranked No. 10 
among all shows in the season just ended -- was ridiculed and criticized when 
he also took over the network's news department and gave its nightly broadcasts 
a fresh look that was heavy on graphics and human interest. 
</P>
<P>
But he was no flake. Besides creating "Nightline," which evolved from coverage 
of the seizure of the American Embassy in Iran in 1979, Arledge built the news 
operation that now represents ABC, and he remains its president. His finest 
achievement will be celebrated Tuesday at 10 p.m. when ABC presents "The Best 
of 'Nightline' with Ted Koppel, 1980-1990." 
</P>
<P>
Another executive whose mark is clearly stamped on ABC is Brandon Stoddard, who 
turned the network's prime-time schedule into a place where viewers could look 
-- and now do -- for quality and experimentation on an ongoing basis. After 
enhancing ABC's image with such special programming as "The Day After," "The 
Winds of War" and "Something About Amelia," he helped bring about, as president 
of the network's entertainment division, series that included "Roseanne," 
"thirtysomething," "The Wonder Years" and "China Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Under another executive who helped turn ABC into a front-runner, former 
entertainment president Fred Silverman, the network actually bolted into the 
No. 1 position for the first time in the late 1970s. But while its shows 
included such notable hits as "Barney Miller," "Happy Days" and "Family," the 
tone of ABC's lineup was dominated by a barrage of lightheaded series like 
"Laverne &amp; Shirley," "Three's Company," "Charlie's Angels" and "The Love 
Boat." 
</P>
<P>
Silverman, who also helped bring forth "Good Morning America" -- an 
entertainment department series -- was a hero beyond compare at ABC, which for 
years before its prime-time ascension had been regarded with contempt and 
ridicule by its older, more established competitors, CBS and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
But although ABC thus has been No. 1 before, its image at that time was hugely 
different from the one created by the team assembled under Stoddard, who now 
heads the network's in-house unit, ABC Productions. 
</P>
<P>
"America's Funniest Home Videos," a project of ABC's new entertainment 
president, Robert Iger, is hardly the tone of "thirtysomething" and "The Wonder 
Years," but it is one of those fluky megahits that often propel a network to 
the top of the ratings. Curiously, its breakout success is reminiscent of the 
sudden, fad hits that marked ABC's earlier years -- "Batman," "77 Sunset 
Strip," "The Untouchables." 
</P>
<P>
Imitations of "America's Funniest Home Videos" were expected, but some viewers 
must have been startled this week to see the following classified ad in The 
Times: "Shoot Your Family &amp; Friends . . . with your videocamera and KCBS 
will air them during the 11 p.m. Action News broadcast. Send us your funniest, 
most noteworthy video moments." 
</P>
<P>
America's funniest news? 
</P>
<P>
Despite ABC's success with "Home Videos," the network began this season with a 
series far more representative of its new creative mold -- a lovely and gritty 
drama called "Life Goes On," focusing on a teen-age boy with Down's syndrome. 
Iger has renewed it for fall. And then there was "Elvis," about the young Elvis 
Presley -- a stylish series that failed but enhanced ABC's reputation even 
further. 
</P>
<P>
The network has so spoiled its viewers by doing the unusual that it may 
actually face a slip in reputation if it cancels two series still up in the air 
for renewal -- the Vietnam drama "China Beach" and the Jamie Lee Curtis-Richard 
Lewis sitcom "Anything But Love," a couple of shows with rare spunk for prime 
time and distinctive styles as well. 
</P>
<P>
And now comes Winfrey in "Brewster Place" as ABC once again offers an 
intriguing project -- a half-hour series set in a black inner-city community in 
1967. It will be launched May 1 and May 8 in the choice Tuesday time period 
following "Roseanne," then settle into its regular Wednesday slot May 9 at 9:30 
p.m. If Winfrey manages anywhere near the ratings clout she has on her daytime 
talk show, ABC could be off on another roll -- one that could help the network 
finally catch front-runner NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Competitively, it's been a fine season for ABC. It had four series in the Top 
10 -- "Roseanne," "America's Funniest Home Videos," "The Wonder Years" and 
"Monday Night Football." It also won three nights -- Monday, Tuesday and 
Friday. What's more, ABC is taking sharp aim at two opposition fortresses -- 
with "Videos" bringing down CBS' "Murder, She Wrote" and thus putting Sundays 
up for grabs, and the eccentric soap opera "Twin Peaks" at least providing 
contrast to NBC's Thursday lineup, dominated for six seasons by "The Cosby 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
From sunup to "Nightline," a wonder year indeed.
