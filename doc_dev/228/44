   CBS News made it official Tuesday, announcing
that former ABC anchorwoman Paula Zahn will succeed Kathleen
Sullivan as co-anchor of ``CBS This Morning'' starting Monday.
   CBS' formal announcement came after two weeks of news reports
that the move was pending. Sullivan indirectly confirmed the shift
during her farewell to viewers Friday. Her CBS contract expires in
November.
   Erik Sorenson, the program's executive producer, said today that
``it wasn't so much that we wanted to replace Kathleen as that we
wanted to get Paula Zahn. It was one of those judgment calls that
you make.''
   Sullivan, 36, was co-host of the show with Harry Smith since it
began in November 1987. Like Zahn, she was a morning news
anchorwoman at ABC before joining CBS.
   Sorenson said CBS officials were impressed with Zahn when she
recently filled in for Joan Lunden on ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' for a week.
   They called Zahn's agent to ask when her ABC News contract ended
and she'd be available for contract talks, he said. He quoted the
agent, Richard Leibner, as saying there were only eight days in
February when she'd be available.
   Sorenson said he and CBS News president David Burke spent three
days weighing the pros and cons of hiring Zahn, 33, ``and it was
not an easy decision because Kathleen is a helluva broadcaster.''
   However, he said in a phone interview, the show's ratings
``hadn't exactly been going through the roof'' and there was a need
to make a long-range decision for the show.
