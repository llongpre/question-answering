   ``CBS This Morning,'' a perennial third in
morning-show ratings, is getting a new executive producer and its
current one is being promoted, CBS News said Friday.
   David Corvo will be succeeded as executive producer of both the
daily program and earlier ``CBS Morning News,'' by Erik Sorenson,
vice president and station manager of CBS-owned KCBS-TV in Los
Angeles.
   Corvo, who began his CBS career at KCBS-TV in 1975, was named
vice president for administration at CBS News by the division's
president, David Burke, who disclosed the changes in a statement.
   Burke said that Ted Savaglio, who holds the job Corvo will get,
and also is the network's deputy director of news coverage, will
become a senior producer at ``CBS This Morning.''
   Corvo has been executive producer of ``CBS This Morning,''
co-anchored by Harry Smith and Kathleen Sullivan, since its
premiere on Nov. 30, 1987.
   It was the successor to ``The Morning Program,'' an
entertainment-oriented bid by CBS to boost morning ratings. That
show, with actress Mariette Hartley and Rolland Smith, was a
ratings flop and was dropped in 10 months.
   CBS News, which didn't produce that show, had hoped ``CBS This
Morning'' would slowly build an audience. But it has remained a
distant third in ratings.
   NBC News' established ``Today'' show, although reportedly
suffering internal troubles and speculation that co-anchor Jane
Pauley wants to leave, still leads in the ratings, followed by
``Good Morning America,'' produced by ABC's entertainment division.
    According to the most recent A.C. Nielsen Co. daytime ratings
``Today'' led with a 4.3 rating in the week ending Sept. 29. ABC's
show had a 3.9, and ``CBS This Morning'' a 2.4. Each ratings point
now represents 921,000 homes.
