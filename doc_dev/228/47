<HEAD>Ratings Down for Morning Shows, But ABC Wins Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Ratings dropped for all three network morning
shows last week, but ABC's ``Good Morning America'' continued in
first, winning its 14th consecutive week, A.C. Nielsen Co. audience
estimates showed Thursday.
   ABC's show averaged a 4.5 rating, down 0.3 from the previous
week.
   NBC's once-dominant ``Today'' show, which fell into second place
after co-host Jane Pauley left at the end of last year, took the
biggest drop. It averaged a 3.3 compared with 3.8 the previous week.
   ``CBS This Morning'' remained in a distant third, averaging a
2.4 rating, down one-tenth of a point from the week ending April 1.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   A ``Today'' spokeswoman, Mary Neagoy, attributed part of the
``Today'' drop to last week's national switch to daylight-saving
time. She said morning show ratings tend to go down initially when
the change occurs.
   Meanwhile, negotiations are still under way for a replacement
for ``Sunday Today'' co-anchor Maria Shriver, who left the show
last week. Mary Alice Williams is expected to succeed her.
   No announcement on Shriver's successor is expected until next
week, said Jerry Solomon, executive producer. He said Michelle
Gillen, a New York-based correspondent, would would co-anchor this
Sunday's ``Today.''
