   ``USA Today: The Television Show,'' TV's bright
new ``infotainment'' package, neither informs nor entertains and
blows past at the speed of a video game.
   It's ``nuzak'' _ something that looks like news at a distance
but will drive you crazy if you try to pay attention.
   At the end of the ride the viewer might only remember a bromide
such as ``baseball is baseball, even in Russia,'' or feel a gnawing
need to know more about the ``sound-emitting chair that provides
the equivalent of eight hours sleep in just 20 minutes.''
   Factoids are dispensed in the ``snapshots'' which precede the
commercials: 6,500 limousines were sold in the USA in 1985; it
costs 49 cents to mail a letter in Italy, 25 cents in the USA.
   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' is the first informational
series from Grant Tinker, whose GTG Entertainment production studio
is a joint venture with Gannett, the publisher of USA Today, the
newspaper. The syndicated, nightly half-hour news show premiered
last Monday on about 160 stations. In most markets, it airs in the
early evening.
   Jay Leno has joked that USA Today is the newspaper for those
whose attention span is too short for television.
   ``USA Today'' on television is no marathon for the mind, but it
demands intense attention in short bursts. For instance, viewers
have about five seconds to decode an elaborate weather map. RAIN,
the map said Tuesday. Where?
   OK, if you care about the weather you can watch the local news,
but then what's the point of flashing the map on ``USA Today''? Is
this the art appreciation segment?

   Sometimes ``USA Today'' is goofily inspired, especially in the
first show when Robin Young stood inside an Impressionist painting
and then, apparently walking toward a fan that made her hair
billow, melded into a beach scene from the film, ``A Man and a
Woman.''
   Edie Magnus played more tricks on the mind by doing ``live''
interviews with George Bush and Michael Dukakis, after explaining
neither one was in the studio. She stood and chatted with a screen,
synchronizing her questions to answers taped earlier in the day.
   The implicit message is that nothing is real, not here anyway.
Nor is anything so important that you, the viewer, need to think
about it.
   But why watch? It takes less concentration to watch ``Nova'' or
a Bill Moyers special on PBS.
   If you miss the intro to a segment, forget it. Poor sound
quality in some of the interviews doesn't help either. In a segment
Wednesday on the National Geographic, voices were repeatedly
smothered by annoying music.
   Before ``USA Today'' hit the air, it suffered a certain amount
of sniping from critics because of its commitment to an upbeat
``journalism of hope'' which accentuated the positive and
eliminated the negative.
   What's been accentuated is pace; coherence and content have been
eliminated. You have to give up something to jam 18 topics into the
22 minutes left after commercials.
   But it's not as though ``USA Today'' tracked mud through the
temple of television. CBS' ``48 Hours'' and ``West 57th'' have
blazed a trail for lightweight journalism, ABC's ``20-20'' is
infatuated with celebrities and Fox's ``A Current Affair'' and
``The Reporters'' plumb the lower depths of taste. ``USA Today''
looks less like an innovator than a cross between Trivial Pursuit
and ``Entertainment Tonight.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   NO `TODAY' TODAY _ For the first time in its 37-year history,
NBC's ``Today'' show is being pre-empted, beginning today, for
coverage of the Summer Olympics in Seoul. But ``Today'' fans won't
miss the stars of the morning show. Bryant Gumbel is anchoring
NBC's prime-time coverage of the Olympics, and Jane Pauley will be
on hand for coverage in the mornings, along with weatherman Willard
Scott. ABC's ``Good Morning America'' and ``CBS This Morning,''
meanwhile, are looking to pick up some viewers without competition
from the No. 1 ``Today'' for a couple of weeks. ...
   ALL-STAR CAST _ Brian Dennehy, Michael Tucker, Hume Cronyn,
Richard Dysart, Hal Holbrook, John Houseman, Barnard Hughes, David
Ogden Stiers and David Straithern have been cast in Aaron
Spelling's made-for-TV movie, ``Day One,'' about the events that
led to the production and dropping of the first atomic bomb on
Hiroshima, Japan. The movie is based on the book by Peter Wyden and
has begun filming for presentation on CBS next season.
