   NBC's slumping ``Today'' Show, trying to recover
during the important May ratings ``sweeps,'' will go camping in
Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains on May 21-22.
   Co-hosts Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville, and weatherman
Willard Scott will do the show from a campsite at the Delaware
Water Gap National Recreational Area near Shawnee, Pa.
   NBC earlier announced that ``Today'' would broadcast from Boston
on Monday and Tuesday, and from outdoor New York locations the rest
of the week.
   ABC's top-rated ``Good Morning America'' plans to broadcast from
England, Scotland and Ireland for the next two weeks, and ``CBS
This Morning'' will originate next week from Europe, starting
Monday in Florence, Italy.
   The ``Today'' camping announcement on Thursday came as the show,
which two weeks ago week suffered its lowest ratings in seven
years, got slightly lower ratings in the week ended April 27,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. audience estimates.
   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' won the morning ratings race for
the 17th consecutive week, averaging a 4.3 rating. ``Today'' was
again in second, averaging as 3.2 rating, one-tenth of a point
lower than the previous week.
   ``CBS This Morning'' remained in third place with a 2.6 rating.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
