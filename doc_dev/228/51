<HEAD>Roseanne Barr Signs Deal With ABC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roseanne Barr and her husband, Tom Arnold,
have signed with ABC to produce a new half-hour series, a special
and a made-for-television movie.
   Miss Barr, star of ABC's hit situation comedy ``Roseanne,'' will
not appear in front of the camera in the new, unnamed series,
``which could commence production anytime after the current 1990-91
broadcast season,'' ABC said in a statement Thursday.
   Under the couple's new agreement, Barnold Productions Inc. will
deliver a special starring Miss Barr for next year's TV season and
a two-hour movie for the 1992-93 season. The network didn't say
whether she would appear in the movie.
   The comedian, now infamous for her screeching rendition of the
national anthem before a San Diego Padres baseball game this
summer, also produces a Saturday morning cartoon series titled
``Little Rosey'' for ABC.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   ABC will follow NBC's lead and send its morning
show anchor to Saudi Arabia during Thanksgiving week to be with
with U.S. troops sent there after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. CBS is
thinking of following suit.
   ABC announced two weeks ago it would send ``Good Morning
America'' co-host Charles Gibson to Saudi Arabia for a week of live
broadcasts starting Nov. 19. NBC said Thursday that ``Today''
anchor Bryant Gumbel also will be there, but for three days
starting Nov. 20.
   ``Today'' weatherman Willard Scott will broadcast live from
Saudi Arabia Nov. 12 through Nov. 16, giving U.S. viewers their
nation's weather and that of Saudi Arabia.
   CBS is considering sending ``CBS This Morning'' co-anchor Harry
Smith to Saudi Arabia during Thanksgiving week, but hasn't reached
a decision, spokeswoman Teri Everett said.

<HEAD>CBS To Air Two Connie Chung Prime-Time Specials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS will air two ``Face to Face with Connie
Chung'' specials on Nov. 22 and Dec. 10, the first shows of what
was to have been a weekly series before Chung cut her work schedule
to try to become pregnant.
   Chung announced in July that she and her husband, tabloid TV
journalist Maury Povich, wanted to ``aggressively'' pursue having
children. CBS then said her weekly hour-long program would be
produced as occasional specials.
