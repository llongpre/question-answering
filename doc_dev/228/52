   Patients in dozens of pediatrician's offices are
going to be exposed to special video programs with commercials
starting this week.
   The service is called Healthlink Television. The executive
overseeing it, David Moore, said Monday that TV sets and video disc
players for showing the program would be in operation by Wednesday
in 100 pediatricians' offices in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
   Plans are to expand nationally to 2,500 doctors' offices by the
end of August, 5,000 by the end of September and 20,000 by early
1991, he said.
   Doctors will be given a one-hour program on a laserdisc that is
to be played continuously on the TV system during the business day.
The program will focus on health care topics with up to nine
minutes of commercials _ each two to four minutes long _ per hour
between program segments.
   Healthlink Television is the first of two commercially-sponsored
video programs that are being produced for audiences in medical
waiting rooms.
   Healthlink is a subsidiary of Hearst-ABC-Viacom Entertainment
Services, a joint venture of Capital Cities-ABC Inc., the Hearst
Corp. and Viacom International Inc.
   The other video program is Special Reports Television, being
produced by Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., and
debuting in October. Whittle is 50 percent-owned by the
entertainment giant Time Warner Inc.
   Both services are aimed principally at mothers visiting the
doctor either for themselves or with their children.
   They are the latest example of media vehicles developed to
enable advertisers to reach narrowly defined audiences. Other
commercial targeted programming includes the Channel One news
program for teens in the classroom, programs for women at the
beauty parlor and a news show for shoppers in the grocery checkout
line.
   These efforts are contributing to the erosion of the audience
for network television and are being blamed partly for the weakness
in advertising for mass media such as the consumer magazines.
   Moore said Healthlink TV will be installed in September in
offices of obstetricians and gynecologists as well as those of
pediatricians and said that family practitioners will start getting
the service a month later. Separate programs, developed with advice
from doctors in each medical specialty, will be created each month
for each type of office.
   On the first Healthlink program, the only paid commercials are
for Tylenol, the pain reliever from Johnson &amp; Johnson. Public
service messages also were included.
   Moore said two other advertisers he declined to identify have
made firm commitments to sponsor the programs for family
practitioners.
   Healthlink also announced that it has signed three physicians
with experience in television as hosts for its three programs.
   Dr. Nancy Snyderman, a medical correspondent for ABC's ``Good
Morning America and KPIX-TV in San Francisco, will host the
pediatrics program.
   Dr. Holly Atkinson, vice president of programming and medical
affairs at the cable channel Lifetime Medical Television, will host
the programs for patients of obstetricians and gynecologists.
   Dr. Tim Johnson, medical editor for ABC News and Entertainment,
will host the family practice show.
   Whittle announced earlier this month that Joan Lunden, co-host
of ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' had signed a three-year contract
to host Special Reports TV shows.
