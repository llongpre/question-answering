   Last summer, Lynn Redgrave filmed an ABC spoof
of juries, ``Jury Duty: The Comedy.'' Almost everyone in the cast
was in an ABC series then, she says, and she was about to be.
   ``Unfortunately,'' she mused this week, ``mine is demised, as
I'm sure you're only too aware.''
   Indeed. ``Chicken Soup,'' wherein she played an Irish widow to
Jackie Mason's Yiddish-accented former pajama salesman, went poof,
amid much publicity, on Nov. 7. It was a quick yank for a new
series of great expectations but declining ratings.
   Redgrave, of the English acting dynasty, has been an actress
since 1962. She has seen works in which she was involved go poof
before. But it was a new experience to have it happen just before a
run-through of a new episode.
   The actress, whose ``Jury Duty'' finally is airing this Sunday,
still recalls that dark day in a Hollywood studio, when a ``Chicken
Soup'' run-through was halted by the arrival of executive producers
Bernie Orenstein and Saul Turteltaub.
   Orenstein had a toddy in hand, she says, ``and I thought, `This
is not a good sign. These are very professional writers, producers,
they don't drink during the working day ... something's wrong with
this picture.'
   ``And indeed it was.''
   Redgrave's disposition tends to be sunny side up. She does not
live on Rue Regret. The acting profession has been very, very good
to her, starting in the '60s with her London stage debut in ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' and first film hit, ``Georgy Girl.''
   Still, she wishes the lords of ABC had let ``Soup'' brew a bit
longer, as future plots called for more of a love-hate relationship
between her and Mason:
   ``I'd become somewhat becalmed in the early shows, a loving,
always-supporting person, which does not for comedy make. But we
were heading more into Laurel and Hardy, a bit of `Here's another
fine mess you've got me into.'
   ``It would have been fun. It's just a shame that nobody saw fit
to see it through a bit further.''
   But ``next'' is the slogan of the acting profession. So, after
``Soup'' shut down, Redgrave and her husband-manager John Clark,
who've lived for 10 years in Los Angeles, adjourned to New York,
where they keep an apartment.
   They took a breather from the TV ramble by returning to the
stage, where their respective careers began.
   They guest-acted for a December week on Broadway in A.R.
Gurney's ``Love Letters,'' a play about the friendship and romance
of a couple from childhood to adulthood, all told through letters
and other correspondence.
   The two hadn't acted together since meeting in the late '60s in
a British television drama, she said, but ``Love Letters'' was such
great fun they plan to do it again for two weeks in San Francisco,
starting Jan. 23.
   While here, Redgrave also teamed up with her older, equally
famous sister, Vanessa, and Sigourney Weaver, in a just-for-kicks
staged reading of the final scene from Chekhov's ``The Three
Sisters.''
   That was fun, too, she says. ``I'm hoping we can do the whole
play soon, perhaps first in England, then New York. I hope we can
do it before we get too old and have to call it `The Three
Grandmothers.' ''
   Television again someday? ``Oh, I'd love to,'' Redgrave says.
``These things (series) come and go. But you never know. Each
season comes along, and what a crap shoot it is.''

   Elsewhere in television...
   CABLE SALUTES CABLE _ This Sunday, the ever-growing cable
industry is holding its 11th annual ACE Awards show _ the
equivalent of over-the-air TV's Emmys. Cable's big show, in Los
Angeles, starts at 8 p.m. EST. Unlike the Emmys, shown only on one
network each year, Sunday's festivities will be simultaneously
shown on 12 cable networks. They include Ted Turner's TBS
Superstation and TNT network; NBC-owned CNBC; The Discovery
Channel, and even SportsChannel America.
   GOOD START FOR ``GOOD MORNING'' _ ABC's ``Good Morning America''
narrowly edged NBC's ``Today'' in ratings for the New Year's first
week. ABC's show averaged a 4.0 rating for the week of Jan. 1-5.
``Today,'' on its first week without Jane Pauley, had a 3.8. ``CBS
This Morning'' remained a distant third with a 2.4 average. Each
rating point represents 921,000 homes.
   Ratings for this week _ the first week of co-hosting by Pauley's
successor, Deborah Norville _ aren't due until next Thursday.
