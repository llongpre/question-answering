   If you like a good horror story, lavish
Victorian costumes, misty London streets with dark wet
cobblestones, and fine British acting, proceed Sunday to ABC's
``Jekyll &amp; Hyde,'' starring Michael Caine as both.
   A TV version of ``The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,''
Robert Louis Stevenson's novella about good and chemically induced
evil, it's a crisp, enjoyable bundle from Britain. It has but one
Yank in it _ Cheryl Ladd.
   She essays Sara, the lovely sister-in-law who becomes the object
of the widowed Dr. Jekyll's affections and Mr. Hyde's horrible
attentions. The former ``Charlie's Angels'' member speaks in a
passable British accent, but seems a tad old for the part. No harm,
though. She manages to fit in.
   While ABC's movie retells a familiar tale, it tells it well,
with writer David Wickes' burnished antique dialogue a joy to the
ears in this age of film-school graduate scripts that mainly
consist of burps, obscenities, and scenes stolen from
``Casablanca.''
   It's hard not to like a show where:
   _A powerful old doctor (Joss Ackland) hates Jekyll, suspects his
married daughter (Ladd) has taken him as a lover, and sternly asks
her, ``Has he seduced you, is that it?'' He later bellows
``Adulteress!,'' and orders her from his house, out, out, out into
the rain.
   _The crusty editor of the London Record who tells sleazy ace
reporter Ted Snape (David Schofield): ``Stay with it. I smell a
scandal brewing.''
   _Caine, as Jekyll teaching a class of medical students, calmly
tells them: ``Evil'' _ a short pause for effect _ ``is not a
scientific word.''
   None of this is camped up, by the way. While such dialogue could
collapse the show if done by actors of lesser skill, this cast
plays things straightforwardly and with care.
   It's sheer pleasure to watch them work, even those in the
smaller roles, such as Joan Heal as Jekyll's disapproving
housekeeper, and Lionel Jeffries as the doctor's irreverent father.
   Tautly directed by Wickes, who earlier teamed with Caine on a
not-so-good TV version of ``Jack the Ripper,'' Sunday's exercise
starts with an auction _ suddenly halted _ of the late Dr. Jekyll's
goods.
   We then learn of the plight of poor Sara, who has borne a son of
her Jekyll-Hyde days. She works as a stablehand and just wants to
be left alone. Of course there ensues a flashback to the whole
story.
   The tale is of the benevolent Jekyll's relentless
experimentation in drugs which, although he hopes it will prove for
the betterment of mankind, keeps turning him into Hyde, his
loathsome, grotesque, violent, murderous alter ego.
   Not only is Hyde (Jekyll rents a room for him in a seedy
brothel) the dark side of humanity, he also is, in his screaming
moments of transformation, a fine example of why we all should
``Just Say No'' to drugs.
   The doctor mixes and downs his terrible potion. In moments, his
hands thicken, his body contorts, his face swells and pulsates and
his features _ well, neighbors, this is Mr. Hyde, and he is plumb
gnarly.
   Back and forth from Jekyll to Hyde he goes, with Hyde nearly
killing a child here, savagely beating a prostitute there, setting
fire to a pub and finally killing a Scotland Yard detective who,
with a colleague, had joined th police search for him.
   The ring starts closing after Mr. Hyde assails the lovely Sara _
temporarily, then permanently, ensconsed in Dr. Jekyll's townhouse.
The good doctor tells her his bad secret and they fall in love.
   Worse, she remains mum when the constables come to investigate
her attack. The work of reporter Snape proves a catalyst in all
this, as does Jekyll's tormented bid to rid himself of Hyde.
   Caine may seem to appear in movies and TV shows at the rate of
one a day, but he rarely turns in a dull performance. He's in top
form throughout here, highly believable and showing no waste motion.
   His screaming, face-bubbling Hyde transformations may strike
some as old hat, but don't blame Caine. Blame Fox's old
``Werewolf'' series. Its weekly man-to-beast changes took the edge
off the normal-to-grotesque racket.
   Be that as it may, be sure to inspect ABC's two-hour ``Jekyll &amp;
Hyde'' on Sunday. It is horror, the good, old-fashioned, English
way.

   Elsewhere in television:
   DEBORAH DOES SECOND _ After her first full week as the new
co-host of NBC's ``Today,'' Deborah Norville and co-host Bryant
Gumble got bad news. For the second week in a row, their show was
second to ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   In the week ending last Friday, ABC's morning effort averaged a
4.5 rating and ``Today'' a 3.9. ``CBS This Morning'' was third with
a 2.6. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes. The new ratings
came out Thursday.
   An NBC spokeswoman, alluding to the much-publicized exit of
longtime ``Today'' star Jane Pauley and Pauley's succesion by
Norville, said that ``any change like this takes a period of
adjustment.'' She said a similar ratings dip occurred in January
1982 when Gumbel succeeded Tom Brokaw on ``Today.''
