   The latest news from Linda Ellerbee's end of
life's great parade, other than that she doesn't want to host a
talk show, is this:
   _ Her Lucky Duck Productions has just finished its first
documentary, a one-hour ``Smithsonian World'' course on the history
of food in America. It is tentatively called ``Moveable Feast.''
   _ The show, heading for a PBS date in February, is written,
reported and anchored by Lloyd Dobyns, her partner from two
sardonic, acclaimed NBC News series of yesteryear, ``Weekend'' and
``NBC News Overnight.''
   _ She isn't involved in ``Moveable Feast,'' she says, ``other
than to annoy Lloyd from time to time.''
   ``I recused myself,'' she explains, savoring the word recused,
``because of my General Foods connection, although there's nothing
in the documentary having to do with General Foods.'' The
connection is the Maxwell House coffee commercials she taped last
spring, a deed for which critics roasted her.
   _ She has not, as was implied in a recent published report, been
approached by NBC News to be a temporary co-anchor at ``Sunday
Today'' when co-anchor Maria Shriver takes a six-week maternity
leave starting Nov. 15.
   NBC, which she left in 1985, hasn't asked her, Ellerbee says.
``It's all news to me,'' she says of the report, adding that no
network has talked to her about a job, including ABC, which she
left in 1987 after her ``Our World'' was axed.
   Ellerbee also is back doing her CNN commentaries after a summer
in which she lost, she reckons, 26 pounds through a strict regimen.
She disclosed all this in an interview.
   Queries included whether she will do more of those still-running
Maxwell House commercials. ``I don't know,'' she replied to that
one.
   To those who say she sold her journalistic credibility for a
mess of instant-coffee money, she would say, and did, that ``people
can think what they want. I had good reasons to do it, and if the
circumstances were the same, I'd do it again.''
   She and Rolfe Tessem, her production partner, explained that
starting her company required a healthy infusion of cash. The
Maxwell House money _ they declined to say how much it was _ seemed
the best way to do this and retain control they might have lost
with other means of financing, they say.
   Being the host of a syndicated talk show might have provided the
money, she says, but, ``I did not want to do a talk show. I feel
they cloud the line between news and entertainment far more than a
commercial does. There's no clouding with a commercial.''
   Having gotten Lucky Duck's first show on the road, so to speak,
she and Tessem say they have other journalistic projects in the
discussion stages on three fronts _ cable, syndication and public
television.
   They decline to elaborate on these efforts, citing the
possibility of concept-poaching by others. But she doesn't rule out
working on-air again with Doybns, who left NBC, now lives near
Raleigh, N.C., and still is her pal.
   ``It's possible,'' she says. ``I do get along with the man, and
there are few enough who do.''
   Ellerbee, as some may have noticed, is a woman of many opinions,
all strong. When asked for a thought on the state of television
nowadays, she immediately gave this one:
   ``The more I see the re-creations of the news and read about the
stagings of the news, the more clean I feel about that commercial.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   BACK TO THE PAST _ CBS News' Bob Simon and his crew recently
were in the Laotian capital of Vientiane, a hub of secret and
not-so-secret activity during the Vietnam War but rarely visited
now by network crews. Simon, a source says, taped reports that
include one about sad, deadly leftovers of the Vietnam War _
unexploded anti-personnel bombs called cluster-bomb units.
Missionaries he interviewed, the source says, say the bomblets now
occasionally maim or kill Laotian peasants on Laos' Plain of Jars,
an old battlefield.
   FORMER FIRST LADY TALKS _ ``Good Morning America'' co-anchor
Charles Gibson is in Los Angeles today and Tuesday, interviewing
Nancy Reagan about her new book of memoirs, ``My Turn,'' and
reports of such matters as astrology and what influence she had on
President Reagan's administration. The interview will air in five
parts on the ABC show the week of Oct. 31-Nov. 3.
   BUT FIRST, THIS IS TODAY _ Bryant Gumbel, co-anchor of NBC's
fuss festival, ``Today,'' won't be on the show today, a spokeswoman
says. But there is no significance to this. He is just taking the
day off, she says. Jane Pauley, who took a day off last week, will
co-anchor today's ``Today'' with Gumbel's fill-in, Deborah
Norville, the show's new news anchor.
