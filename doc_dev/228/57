   ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' winner of the
morning ratings races for 20 consecutive weeks, easily won the May
ratings sweeps, A.C. Nielsen Co. audience estimates showed Friday.
   ABC's show averaged a 4.6 rating, with NBC's ``Today'' getting a
3.3, and ``CBS This Morning'' a distant third with a 2.5 average.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   ``Good Morning America'' also won the February sweeps.
   The sweeps, which occur four times year, are periods of intense
audience measurements in the nation's local television markets. The
results help local stations set their ad rates until the next sweeps
period.
