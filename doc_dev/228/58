   It's not unusual for an actor to appear
regularly on two television shows, but J. Eddie Peck had pivotal
roles on two competing prime-time soap operas, CBS' ``Dallas'' and
ABC's ``Dynasty.''
   On ``Dallas,'' he plays George Kennedy's bad-boy son, Tommy
McKay, and on the just-canceled ``Dynasty'' he was Roger Grimes,
the mysterious dream-lover of Emma Samms and a nightmare from Joan
Collins' past.
   Peck has been notified by Lorimar Productions that he'll be back
next season on ``Dallas.'' ABC is dropping ``Dynasty'' after nine
seasons.
   Peck auditioned for ``Dynasty'' last year, but because of the
writers strike he went to Las Cruces, N.M., to work in a movie
called ``The Bite.'' He calls it a cross between ``Alien'' and
``The Fly.''
   ``I'd written off `Dynasty,' but when I got back they called me
in,'' said Peck. ``They still hadn't written the role, but he was
to be Joan Collins' ex-lover who was murdered 25 years ago. I
played him as he was 25 years ago. I would come to Emma Samms in
her dreams as her lover.
   ``Then I had a chance to audition for `Dallas.' I only had a
week-to-week contract with `Dynasty' and they wouldn't tell me what
was going to happen. After I got hired by `Dallas' I was called
back to `Dynasty.' The people at `Dallas' didn't want to let me go
and I did eight shows. It was on my resume that I was on `Dynasty'
but they apparently missed it. The two shows don't want to share
actors.''
   Peck was supposed to do only four shows for ``Dynasty,'' but
ended up doing seven.
   Peck said he particularly likes his character on ``Dallas''
because of his many facets.
   ``He's a wild, wild man,'' he said. ``He has a lot of pain, a
lot of anguish. He has a bitter relationship with his father. You
see a sympathetic level beneath the dark side. I really took the
character out on a limb. There's a rage and frustration they didn't
originally intend. But once I tried it they liked it and started
writing it that way.''
   In the beginning, Peck didn't want to be an actor, but says
eventually, ``I fell in love with it.''
   His first roles were in the daytime soaps ``The Young and the
Restless'' and ``Days of Our Lives.'' Later he had a recurring role
in an NBC show, ``Double Trouble.''
   Four years ago he was cast in an ABC Western series called
``Wildside.'' It ran for only six episodes in 1985, up against
NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and CBS' ``Magnum P.I.''
   ``It was a Disney show and Disney treated us first class,'' he
said. ``They spoiled us. I didn't know everybody else doesn't get
this kind of treatment. It was a turning point in a lot of ways.''
   Peck, who was born in Virginia and grew up in Missouri, is
married to Sonya Zaza Peck, a high-fashion runway model.
