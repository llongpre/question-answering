In morning television, where viewing habits are as traditional as orange juice 
and coffee, the "Today" show lately has been waking up to a cold shower in the 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jane Pauley departed and was replaced by Deborah Norville as co-anchor on 
the 38-year-old NBC show, "Today" has been replaced by ABC's "Good Morning 
America" as the top-rated network morning news show, with "Today" losing a 
surprising 10% of its rating in one three-week period. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, "GMA" topped a nine-week winning streak in the Nielsen ratings, 
claiming its first victory over "Today" in a February sweeps period since 
November, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
For the month of February, one of four times a year when the ratings of every 
station in the country are measured to determine advertising rates, "Good 
Morning America's" average viewership was 4.1 million homes a day -- 
representing 21% of the audience watching TV at that time. "Today" had 3.3 
million homes and 17% of the audience. And "CBS This Morning" had 2.5 million 
homes and 12% of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to February of last year, "Today's" ratings were down 22% while "GMA" 
was up 7%. CBS, the longtime third-place program, was up 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Although early-morning news programs usually lose some viewers when they change 
anchors, ratings experts say that the "Today" plunge indicates viewers are 
reacting emotionally to the soap opera that was played out on "Today" over the 
past year -- from anchor Bryant Gumbel's infamous in-house memo to NBC's 
handling of the Norville hiring. 
</P>
<P>
"NBC tried to fix something that fundamentally wasn't broken," said Janet 
Patterson, the director of research for WBZ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Boston. 
"Morning shows are a companion to viewers. They didn't like what had happened 
to Jane Pauley, and they acted on it by voting with their TV dials." 
</P>
<P>
WBZ has been one of the most successful "Today" show stations, Patterson said, 
ranking No. 1 in the Boston market even when "Today" was No. 3 in the national 
Nielsen ratings. "Boston is a town of traditions, and people here have been 
loyal to 'Today' since the days of J. Fred Muggs," she said, referring to the 
chimp that used to be on the show when Dave Garroway was host. But in the past 
few months, "Today's" ratings in Boston have paralleled the drop in the 
national Nielsens. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed that the race began to heat up at about the same time as the Gumbel 
memo (about a year ago)," Patterson said. "But what clearly hurt us was 
unhappiness over Pauley." 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel's memo, written in response to then-"Today" producer Marty Ryan's 
request to evaluate the elements of the show, created a barrage of publicity 
after a newspaper published it because Gumbel was particularly critical of 
another member of the show's on-air "family" -- weatherman Willard Scott. 
</P>
<P>
And when NBC executives, in a bid for younger viewers, hired Norville last year 
as the show's news anchor, which ultimately led to Pauley's stepping down as 
co-anchor, Norville was portrayed and perceived as a younger, blonder rival. 
</P>
<P>
Rightly or wrongly, according to CBS research, the negative publicity over 
Gumbel's memo and Norville's hiring may be washing over into viewers' 
perceptions of the "Today" co-hosts. 
</P>
<P>
According to David Poltrack, CBS senior vice president of research and 
marketing, Gumbel and Norville are the only morning-news anchors who recently 
have shown "a significant negative component" in CBS' tracking of audience 
attitudes towards the morning hosts. Noting that viewers generally rank news 
anchors favorably, Poltrack said that, in the case of Gumbel and Norville, a 
number had rated them either "fair" or "poor." 
</P>
<P>
CBS' research also shows that viewers recently have been showing unusual signs 
of dial-switching among the morning shows, where "GMA" has remained stable with 
hosts Charles Gibson and Joan Lunden, while "CBS This Morning" has shown 
improvement in the ratings and has recently hired "GMA's" news anchor Paula 
Zahn to replace Kathleen Sullivan as anchor with Harry Smith. As the 
third-place entrant in the race, Poltrack said, CBS hopes to benefit from that 
sampling. 
</P>
<P>
At first-place "Good Morning, America," researchers maintain that they are not 
merely benefiting from the bad publicity at "Today." Noting that "GMA" had been 
leading "Today" among young women for some time, Alan Wurtzel, ABC's senior 
vice president in charge of audience research, said, "There's no question that 
Pauley's departure has had an effect, but we were in a position to take 
advantage of that opportunity. We had our personalities and segments in place 
so that people, when they came over and looked at the show, liked what they 
saw." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Barbara Walters, scheduled to air Friday on ABC's "20/20," 
Gumbel acknowledged, "We've had a series of incidents that have projected the 
show in a poor light. And we've been on top for five years. That makes you a 
very convenient target. Between the memo, the changeover of people, there's 
just been a kind of firestorm." 
</P>
<P>
Given the slow-burning nature of change in morning TV, the question for "Today" 
is how and when that firestorm will be put out. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Capra, who took over as executive producer on Jan. 29, predicts that the 
program has hit the bottom of the recent ratings trend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we may have reached our low point last week," said Tom Capra, who 
formerly was news director at KNBC Channel 4 in Los Angeles. "There is a lot of 
sampling going on, but we think viewers will rediscover us. It's time to quit 
blaming Deborah Norville for Jane Pauley." 
</P>
<P>
Norville has been criticized by some TV reviewers for seeming to lack Pauley's 
warmth and chemistry with Gumbel and for sometimes rushing through her 
interviews. Since he joined the show, Capra said, "I don't think the program 
races any more -- it seemed to be relentless in the past. Bryant and Deborah 
have more time to talk to each other. We're exposing ourselves more to the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
"Today" will travel to Los Angeles for the Oscars later this month, but Capra 
said that he plans no major revamp of the series or any changes in the on-air 
talent.
