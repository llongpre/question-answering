   Harry Smith's arm shoots up in the air
midsentence and he snaps his fingers.
   ``You know what it was? I'll tell you what it was! The seed was
planted in high school, because I had an English teacher and we had
to write a term paper. ... I couldn't come up with anything and (the
teacher) John Gulassa said, `Here's some books. Why don't you read
these and see what you think?' And he gave me `On the Road,' by Jack
Kerouac.
   ``That was the beginning of the end for me. You know, the
beginning of the end which turned out to be the great beginning.''
   Smith, 37, was searching his memory for the genesis of the story
of how a kid from a small blue-collar town in the Midwest found
himself in New York City as co-host of a network morning news show.
   ``CBS This Morning'' celebrates its first anniversary this week.
Though it is still struggling in the ratings behind NBC's ``Today''
and ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Smith and co-host Kathleen
Sullivan have developed an easy-going rapport, and the network seems
content to let them develop a following.
   The pressure doesn't seem to get to Smith, the most likely
successor to Charles Kuralt as CBS' resident laid-back philosopher.
   Smith's feet-on-the-ground attitude comes from deep Midwestern
roots and a strict religious upbringing. His father worked two jobs,
as a policeman and a milkman. Smith was the youngest of eight
children, most of whom ``got married pretty young and went out into
the world and got real jobs and had real lives,'' Smith said. ``I
was the youngest and kind of the surprise. I got a little bit more
attention than the other ones did, had a rich fantasy life about
doing something other than going to work at the Youngstown Sheet and
Tool.''
   Most of those fantasies revolved around television.
   ``I used to watch Jack Paar and just used to be fascinated by
characters like Oscar Levant,'' Smith said. ``Certainly in my realm
of existence there wasn't anyone real like that, and wouldn't it be
interesting to meet people and know people like that?''
   Despite a budding interest in literature and philosophy, Smith
went to college on a football scholarship and planned to be a
high-school football coach. He attended Central College in Pella,
Iowa, an intellectually ``dangerous'' place for a young jock, he
said, ``because they said, `Here are books. How would you like to
read them?' And so I did, and my notions about being a football
coach were short-lived.''
   He graduated with a degree in communications and theater. After a
stint as a public TV talk-show host in Denver, he moved over to
KMGH-TV, the CBS affiliate. There he anchored the noon news with
another reporter, Andrea Joyce. Their courtship sounds right out of
``Broadcast News.''
   ``We were just buds,'' Smith said. ``We worked very hard and were
very career-oriented and all that sort of stuff, so professional
that neither of us would have ever considered going out. We used to
`convenience date.' You know, `I've got this thing to go to, would
you go with me? Just go with me.'''
   A ``convenience date'' to the opera led to romance and later
marriage.
   Smith was a Dallas-based correspondent for CBS when he was tapped
for ``CBS This Morning.'' Even though it means getting up at 4 a.m.,
Smith says the schedule at least is regular and has allowed for a
``second honeymoon.'' Joyce now reports for Madison Square Garden
network. They go to Central Park everyday with their wire-haired fox
terrier.
   ``I don't know if I can do it forever. I saw where Jane Pauley
celebrated 12 years and I don't know if I could do that,'' Smith
said.
   His favorite part of the job is most like being a correspondent _
going on the road to cover every kind of news story, from political
conventions to hurricanes.
   ``There's gonna be a time when I just do that again,'' Smith
said. ``Doesn't have to be next year or the year after. There's a
time down the line when I'm going to go back and maybe that's what
I'll do for a living. I'll be a correspondent based somewhere.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   SECOND PRIZE IS A YEAR AS PRESIDENT OF CBS _ MTV is holding a
contest whose grand prize winner will get to see ``what it's like to
run MTV for a day.'' MTV promises ``as MTV chief for a day, the
lucky winner will feast on power lunches, stay at a hotel fit for a
network president and fly round trip in the style an MTV chief
deserves.'' The winner also gets a share of box-office receipts from
the Paramount movie ``Scrooged,'' which the contest publicizes.
