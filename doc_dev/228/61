<HEAD>NBC Names New `Today' Executive Producer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC on Monday named Tom Capra, a veteran news
producer and son of film director Frank Capra, as the new executive
producer of the ``Today'' show, effective Jan. 29.
   Capra is currently news director at NBC-owned KNBC-TV in
Burbank, Calif., and formerly worked as producer for both CBS News
and ABC News. He succeeds Marty Ryan, who has run ``Today'' since
June 1987.
   The move, which industry reports have said was expected, is the
latest change at NBC's once-dominant morning program, which in
recent weeks has been in a tight ratings battle with ABC's ``Good
Morning America.''
   Last month, Jane Pauley, ``Today'' co-host for 13 years, left
the show for other NBC News projects. She was succeeded by Deborah
Norville, who in September succeeded John Palmer as the program's
news anchor.
   Capra was picked for ``Today'' after the collapse of
negotiations to bring David Nuell, executive producer of
``Entertainment Tonight,'' to NBC for three jobs, including one as
senior executive producer of ``Today.''
   Nuell since has returned to the syndicated entertainment series.
