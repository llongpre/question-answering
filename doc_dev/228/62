   After five weeks off for elective surgery and
recuperation, Joe Garagiola will return Monday to NBC's ``Today''
show and on Tuesday report on the baseball play-offs, NBC said
Thursday.
   Garagiola, 64, has declined to say what kind of surgery was
performed. A former ``Today'' co-anchor, he returned to the show
last June on a three-day-a-week basis as part of NBC's effort to
revive the show's ratings.
   The once-dominant program suffered a ratings slump after the
replacement in January of Jane Pauley by Deborah Norville, a
co-anchor with Bryant Gumbel.
   NBC's efforts to boost the show back into first place haven't
worked yet. ABC's rival ``Good Morning America'' was first in
morning ratings last week fo  the 39th consecutive week.
   It averaged a 4.4 rating, A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates
showed.``Today'' had a 3.2 and ``CBS This Morning'' a 2.6. Each
ratings point represents 931,000 homes.
