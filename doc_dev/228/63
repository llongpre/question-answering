<P>
NBC was the top network for the 1989-90 television season, it was a split 
decision between "The Cosby Show" and "Roseanne" for No. 1 series, and there 
was a mysterious drop-off in general television viewing, according to 
end-of-season figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-week prime time season ended Sunday with NBC way out in front, posting 
its fifth consecutive win with a 14.6 rating and a 24 share, according to the 
A. C. Nielsen Co. ABC was second with a 12.9 rating and a 21 share, and CBS was 
third with a 12.2 and a 20 share. 
</P>
<P>
In evening news, ABC's "World News Tonight" with Peter Jennings was the new 
champ, with a 10.9 rating, with "CBS Evening News" with Dan Rather demoted to 
second with a 10.0 rating. "NBC Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw was third with a 
9.9 rating. 
</P>
<P>
The question of which show was on top of the list was a matter of whether or 
not you counted a "Roseanne" episode broadcast outside of its regular time 
period. NBC and ABC called the win for ABC's "Roseanne," while CBS gave it to 
NBC's "The Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
"It's no surprise," said Bob Niles, NBC vice president of research, in 
announcing the season-end statistics at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The three-network share of homes using television -- HUT levels -- was down 
from the 1988-89 figure of 67%. 
</P>
<P>
David Poltrack, CBS senior vice president of planning and research called the 
decline "unprecedented and unexplained" and said CBS was pressing Nielsen for 
more data. 
</P>
<P>
The top new program for the season that aired six or more times was ABC's 
"America's Funniest Home Videos," which had a 20.9 rating and a 32 share. 
</P>
<P>
"Twin Peaks" on ABC won as most-watched made-for-television movie. Top 
miniseries of two or more parts was ABC's "Small Sacrifices." The most-watched 
theatrical movie was "Lethal Weapon" on NBC. The Academy Awards on ABC won as 
top entertainment special. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of prime time, CBS was the daytime winner, with "The Young and the 
Restless" topping the chart. In morning programming, ABC's "Good Morning 
America" was top-rated, with NBC's "Today" show falling off after Deborah 
Norville replaced Jane Pauley. CBS was third.
