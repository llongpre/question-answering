Say It Ain't So, Joe!: There doesn't seem to be a new dawn for NBC's troubled 
"Today" show and its three hosts -- Bryant Gumbel, Deborah Norville and Joe 
Garagiola. Despite a revamped format and the return of Garagiola as co-host, 
"Today" last week suffered its lowest ratings in nearly seven years, according 
to Nielsen audience estimates.

While ABC's "Good Morning America" won its 29th consecutive ratings victory 
with a 4.2 average, "Today" was well behind with a 2.9, its lowest average 
since the week of Aug. 6, 1983, when it had a 2.8 average. "CBS This Morning" 
remained a distant third with a 2.2 average. (Each ratings point represents 
921,000 homes.) "Today" is attempting to recover from a ratings slide that 
began in January after 13-year veteran Jane Pauley left the show. She was its 
co-host when it hit its previous ratings low in 1983. GREG BRAXTON
