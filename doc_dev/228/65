   The annual NBC affiliates' convention, normally
held in Los Angeles, begins in Washington today.
   The main reason? A Tuesday trip to Capitol Hill by affiliate
executives to discuss cable- and NBC-related matters.
   The executives of NBC's 208 affiliated stations should be happy,
considering the network last month won its fifth straight season in
prime time. But there is trouble in Peacock City.
   Among other things:
   _ NBC's prime-time ratings last season were the lowest in its
history, down 9 percent from 1988-89.
   _ ``Today,'' whose Nielsen dive began after last year's
much-criticized changes that led to the exit of Jane Pauley and the
entrance of Deborah Norville, has run second to ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' for 21 weeks.
   _ Tom Brokaw's ``NBC Nightly News'' has been third in the news
ratings for seven consecutive weeks.
   The executives, of course, also will be pondering what incoming
affiliate chairman Eric Bremner calls an ``audacious and bold'' move
for next season by Fox Broadcasting _ pitting ``The Simpsons''
against ``The Cosby Show.''
   ``I think Fox has taken one hell of a gamble,'' says Bremner's
predecessor as affiliate chairman, James R. Sefert. ``But this is
just the kind of challenge that makes Bill Cosby work all the
harder.``
   Although The Simpsons vs. The Coz likely will be the talk of the
gathering, much of the executives' attention will be on the news
division.
   Its president, Michael Gartner, last month commenced repair
programs for ``Today'' and the ``NBC Nightly News'' in sudden,
back-to-back moves that more than a few TV writers saw as two steps
back to the future.
   For ``Today,'' he re-hired former host Joe Garagiola, who'll be
on the show three days a week. With CBS anchor Faith Daniels, hired
as the show's news anchor, he'll join co-hosts Norville and Byrant
Gumbel on June 11.
   And Gartner re-hired Steve Friedman, the brash former ``Today''
executive producer who helped that show achieve dominance. Gartner
made him executive producer of ``Nightly News.''
   Gartner is scheduled to talk to the affiliates today about the
changes and other plans. It remains to be seen whether he'll come
under heavy fire from the station executives at Wednesday's
closed-door final session.
   ``I don't know if there's going to be hostility, but there is
deep concern'' about the state of the two programs, says Sefert,
president of Cosmos Broadcasting Corp. in Greenville, S.C.
   ``We hope to get an explanation of the rationale behind moves
that have been made so far,'' says Bremner, of King Broadcasting Co.
in Seattle, Wash. He doubts that the fiesty Gartner will face sharp
verbal attacks.
   ``But yes, the affiliates are very definitely concerned and
anxious to see positive results from the changes that have been
made,'' he says.
   The affiliates also will hear Gartner discuss a proposal to make
an NBC News service called A-News a 24-hour news and sports-news
operation, one that would resemble CNN only in its round-the-clock
schedule.
   A-News currently sends affiliates reports from NBC News and
affiliate stations seven times a day, starting at 11 a.m. EDT and
ending at 2:30 a.m. EDT, NBC says. The reports are separate from
NBC's regular newscasts and are for use in local stations' newscasts.
   The expanded service might include an anchor in the early morning
hours when NBC isn't broadcasting.
   The proposed new service ``has to be viewed as a positive turn of
events,'' Bremner says. ``If it's done as well as NBC intends to do
it, it will be a major resource for the affiliates.''
   During Tuesday's Capitol Hill trip, Sefert says, the affiliate
executives will meet with their congressmen to seek:
   _ Hearings on the issue of cable companies that transmit local
broadcast signals without paying for them. The NBC stations don't
seek laws requiring payment, he says, but want ``a solution that is
acceptable to everybody.''
   _ Capitol Hill support for whatever the Federal Communications
Commission decides on proposals to let the networks have a financial
interest in programs they air that were brought in by outside
producers.
   The major networks currently are barred from a financial interest
in such programs by the FCC's financial-syndication rules. But the
FCC currently is re-examining the rules in light of the growth of
cable.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   HAIL TO THE PAIR: Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer have worked
together for 15 years in what has evolved into public television's
``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour.'' So their production company, which says
their partnership is the longest of its kind in TV history, says the
two will be the subject a 90-minute PBS special this fall. Which it
will produce.
