   If you're the sort who puts off planning your
weekend until Saturday morning, ``Great Weekend'' is probably just
the show you're looking for.
   This new one-hour show of news and information will help you
sort out your weekend by telling you what's happening and where.
   There's also a small side benefit. It offers adults a Saturday
morning alternative amid the glut of cartoon shows.
   ``I tend to plan my weekend rather spontaneously on Saturday
mornings,'' said George Merlis, the show's executive producer.
``This addresses that need. It tells you what you can do on the
weekend. On Valentine's Day weekend, for instance, we showed the
romantic getaways.
   ``Everything we've done has been reachable by the audience. We
don't play voyeur _ our host goes there but you can't. We also
offer information on medicine, tips to consumers, and the schedule
of sports you can see this weekend.''
   ``Great Weekend,'' which goes out live by satellite, is
currently telecast on 31 stations across the country. It picked up
12 new stations at the recent convention of the National
Association of Television Program Executives in Houston. The
co-hosts of the show are Dale Harimoto and Bob Goen.
   ``Before we went on, the opinion was expressed by one station
that only a network could do a show like this because we originate
from several points,'' said Merlis. ``But `Great Weekend' is
produced in association with USTV.''
   USTV is the program development arm of Hubbard Broadcasting Co.
of Minneapolis and has three transponders on a communications
satellite. Each transponder can handle two signals. Hubbard also
operates the CONUS news delivery service and TV Direct in
partnership with The Associated Press.
   ``We went on the air in January with 16 stations,'' said Merlis.
``The first station we picked up was the one that said only a
network could do this. For our show on Feb. 20 we had our
weatherman in Savannah, Ga., Bob Goen was in Calgary, Canada, Dale
Harimoto was in Los Angles and our news and medical news came out
of Minneapolis.''
   Merlis also runs a company that produces video press tours. Most
recently, Elizabeth Taylor appeared on talk shows across the
country to promote her new diet book without ever having to leave
Los Angeles.
   Merlis developed ABC's ``Good Morning America'' into a hit
program. He also has been a producer for ``The CBS Morning News,''
``The Dick Cavett Show'' and ``Entertainment Tonight.''
   ``Stanley Hubbard of Hubbard Broadcasting knew me from `Good
Morning America' and called me up and said he wanted to talk,''
Merlis said. ``I flew to Minneapolis. He asked me what I thought
about a weekend show that would be like `Good Morning America' but
looks at weekend activities. I said I'd like to watch one because I
get up early on Saturday and was tired of looking at the `Road
Runner.'
   ``Hubbard had already done surveys which showed an overwhelming
audience response to such a show. I did a demonstration pilot and
we went on the air Jan. 2.''
   Merlis said that every show he's produced has had a consumer
outlook. ``If it didn't, I gave it one,'' he said. ``We give out
information that's useful to people. I try to keep the audience's
viewpoint in mind and see what they can take away from the show.
What's useful in terms of enriching their lives.
   ``When I took over `Entertainment Tonight' I felt it was very
slickly produced, but it had no point of view. I felt the point of
view was that we're consumers of entertainment. We had to give the
viewer intelligent choices for his entertainment.''
