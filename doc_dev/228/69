   For the fourth consecutive week, NBC's ``Today
Show'' was second last week to ABC's ``Good Morning America'' in
ratings, with ``CBS This Morning'' still a distant third, estimates
showed Thursday.
   However, the 4.3 average for ABC's show was down slightly, by
one-tenth of a ratings point. The 4.0 average for NBC's show was up
by the same slight margin. CBS' broadcast averaged a 2.6 rating.
   Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes, according to the
A.C. Nielsen Co.
   The longest previous winning stretch of `Good Morning America''
over once-dominant ``Today'' occurred in October and November 1987,
when ABC's show won its morning time period for six weeks, an ABC
spokeswoman said.
