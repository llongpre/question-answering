   ABC News anchorwoman Paula Zahn, bound for ``CBS
This Morning,'' said goodbye on the air Thursday to her ``Good
Morning America'' colleagues, not mentioning CBS but saying, ``I
have a wonderful opportunity to go into.''
   Although CBS had no comment on reports she is joining CBS News,
her agent, Richard Leibner, confirmed she is headed there. He
declined to elaborate.
   ``After a few tiny details are wrapped up, there's no question
that she'll be at CBS,'' said Leibner, who handled negotiations for
Diane Sawyer when she left CBS last year to join ABC as co-anchor
of ``Prime-Time Live.''
   Zahn's ABC contract ended Thursday. A source close to her
contract talks said ABC hoped she would stay there but didn't make
a counteroffer to CBS' bid, a four-year pact paying about $1.1
million annually.
   Zahn, who joined ABC News in the fall of 1987, has been
co-anchor of ``World News This Morning'' and the news segments of
``Good Morning America'' since May 1988. The latter program is
produced by ABC Entertainment.
   A source familiar with negotiations for her services said that
Zahn would succeed Kathleen Sullivan as co-anchor of the
bottom-rated ``CBS This Morning'' and probably would start work
Feb. 26.
   Friday will be Sullivan's last day on the program, according to
a memo sent staff members by the show's executive producer, Erik
Sorenson, who said Faith Daniels would be her temporary replacement
next week.
   In a statement, ABC News President Roone Arledge praised Zahn's
work and said, ``We wish her all the best in her new assignment.''
   ``ABC was terrific to her, she loved it there'' and appreciated
what Arledge and others did for her, Leibner said. ``But an
extraordinary opportunity doesn't come down the pike that often.
It's a sad departure to a new adventure.''
   Zahn's move to CBS has been expected ever since Ron Konecky,
Sullivan's agent, said last week that CBS is taking Sullivan off
``CBS This Morning.'' Sullivan and Harry Smith have been co-anchors
of the show since it began in 1987.
   In her farewell to viewers and ``Good Morning America'' co-host
Charles Gibson and weatherman Spencer Christian, Zahn said that it
had been ``an absolute pleasure'' working at ABC News.
   ``I have a wonderful opportunity to go into,'' she said. ``The
details are being worked out at this moment, so we can't really
talk specifically what they are about. You can expect the
announcement soon.''
   No replacement for her has been chosen, an ABC spokeswoman said.
   Zahn, a native of Naperville, Ill., previously was an anchor and
reporter at Los Angeles TV station KCBS, where Sullivan began in
1977. Zahn started her career a year later at WFAA-TV in Dallas.
   Sullivan's CBS contract expires in November. Konecky said last
week that CBS had given no specific reason why they wanted to
replace her and had set no date for her to leave. He said he was
discussing other possibilities for her at CBS.
   When Sullivan leaves the program, it will mark the second time
this year that a network anchorwoman has been replaced on a morning
program.
   In a controversial shift last month, Jane Pauley, co-host of
NBC's ``Today'' for 13 years, was succeeded by Deborah Norville.
The move hasn't helped that show in the ratings.
   According to A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, ``Today'' last week was
second to ``Good Morning America'' for the sixth consecutive week.
   ABC's show averaged a 4.4 rating and ``Today'' 3.7. CBS' show,
third in ratings since it began, although doing better in the
Nielsens than its predecessor, ``The Morning Show,'' had a 2.7.
   Each rating point represents 921,000 homes.
