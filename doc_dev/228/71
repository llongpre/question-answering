   NBC News President Michael Gartner admitted to
affiliates that changes he approved in the ``Today'' show put it in
a slump, but he predicted it will be back on top in the morning
ratings.
   Gartner also announced Monday the start in January of a 24-hour
NBC News channel for the network's 208 affiliates.
   Affiliate executives were heading to Capitol Hill today to seek
help on cable issues and urge that NBC and its network rivals be
free from federal bans on financial interests in shows the networks
don't solely own.
   At the start of NBC's annual affiliates convention, Gartner
frankly addressed the decline in ``Today'' ratings since Jane Pauley
left as co-host in December.
   ``That's got to be the starting point, the willingness to admit _
in this case _ the obvious,'' said Eric Bremner of King Broadcasting
in Seattle, the new chairman of the NBC affiliates board.
   ``I think it was well-received,'' he said.
   Once first in ratings, ``Today'' has been second to ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' for 21 weeks.
   Its slide started in January after Pauley's replacement by
Deborah Norville as co-host with Bryant Gumbel. The popular Pauley,
who was unhappy with other changes on the show and asked to leave,
had been on ``Today'' for 13 years.
   To get the show moving again, Gartner brought in a new executive
producer, Tom Capra, and is bringing back former ``Today'' host Joe
Garagiola on June 11 as third co-host.
   Without mentioning specifics, Gartner told affiliates that ``we
know we screwed up the `Today' show ... he (Capra) knows what the
show needs and he knows how to provide it.
   ``Now, with the dust settled, he'll make it, we'll make it,
another winner.''
   Garagiola appeared on stage with the ``Today'' cast and kidded
with weatherman Willard Scott.
   But the affiliate executives greatest affection was for Pauley,
who got a standing ovation.
   ``I have never been happier in my work,'' said Pauley, now
preparing a series of prime time specials for NBC. She is the
substitute evening news anchor when Tom Brokaw is away.
   Gartner predicted better times ahead for the ``NBC Nightly
News,'' third in ratings for seven straight weeks. He introduced the
show's new executive producer, Steve Friedman, calling him a ``show
doctor'' who will make the newscast ``sparkle.''
   Friedman ran ``Today'' when it rose to first in ratings. He left
NBC in 1987 to create what proved a costly syndicated flop, ``USA
Today on TV.''
   The normally brash producer made no promises of a fast ratings
rise, but said there would be changes to make the newscast a
contender. He declined to announce the changes citing competitive
reasons.
   Network newscasts can ``no longer just index the day's events,''
he said. ``We can't come on and say, `These are the top stories.'
People have heard them already.
   ``We are going to do a show of interest, not the show of
record,'' he said.
   The 24-hour news service announced by Gartner will provide
affiliates with international, national, regional and breaking news
for use in their own newscasts, said Robert Horner, in charge of the
service.
   Although at first glance similar to Cable News Network, the NBC
service won't have anchors and won't transmit stories on a non-stop
basis, as CNN does.
   It is intended to help NBC stations compete with CNN's newscasts,
and to ward off further encroachments by CNN on NBC stations.
   CNN says it has 216 broadcast affiliates, of which 52 also are
NBC affiliates.
   NBC's convention will end Wednesday.
