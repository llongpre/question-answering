   Forrest Sawyer, the former co-host of ``The
CBS Morning News,'' has been named an anchor for ABC's ``World News
Sunday,'' replacing Sam Donaldson, ABC said Thursday.
   Sawyer, who joined ABC in July 1988, has been the co-anchor of
the newscasts on ``World News This Morning'' and ``Good Morning
America.'' He was the co-host of ``The CBS Morning News'' from 1985
to 1987.
   An additional anchor may join Sawyer on ``World News Sunday'' if
ABC redesigns the show's format, the network said.
   Donaldson left ``World News Sunday'' on Sunday to work on his new
program ``PrimeTime Live,'' which also features Diane Sawyer.
