   NBC ``Today'' show co-anchor Jane Pauley says
she probably will leave the program by the end of the year but will
stay with the network ``in some fashion or other,'' The Washington
Post reported today.
   Neither she nor the network would comment on the report.
   NBC News spokeswoman Peggy Hubble said a statement on Pauley's
future probably would be made later in the day. Ms. Pauley, who has
two years left on her NBC News contract, didn't return calls and
was reported by her office out taping an interview.
   ``I am definitely staying at NBC,'' the Post quoted Ms. Pauley
as saying in a telephone interview from New York.
   Ms. Pauley has been co-anchor of ``Today'' for 13 years, but her
future with the program has been the subject of speculation in the
weeks since Deborah Norville took over as newscaster on the program.
   ``Thirteen years ago today Jane Pauley began on `Today,'''
co-anchor Bryant Gumbel said at the opening of this morning's
broadcast. ``That's a long time. Is that a lifetime?''
   ``It's a long time. It's my whole adult life, virtually,'' Ms.
Pauley responded. ``Thank you.''
   At the end of the broadcast, the words ``Happy Anniversary''
flashed on the screen.
   Ms. Pauley told the newspaper there has been no hostility among
members of the ``Today'' cast, although she did say the place has
been more tense since Ms. Norville swapped duties with John Palmer,
who has been sent to ``NBC News at Sunrise.''
   ``When it was first revealed to me that John and Deborah were
going to switch, that was a real blow,'' Ms. Pauley was quoted as
saying. ``I like him very much, and I thought, `Why John? What did
he do to anybody?' But as soon as you say anything, it sounds like
a jealous older woman talking about a younger one.''
   Ms. Norville is 31; Ms. Pauley will be 39 at the end of this
month.
   Ms. Pauley told her interviewer that if she does leave
``Today,'' she would ``still like to come back to the show now and
then in the future, the way Barbara Walters does at `Good Morning
America.' It would be very unlike me to leave on bad terms.
   ``As it stands now, I am staying (with NBC) in some fashion or
other.''
   Ms. Pauley's agent has been negotiating with NBC since August,
when Ms. Norville was promoted. NBC executives, who thought she was
after more money, were startled when she submitted her resignation,
according to unidentified sources cited by the Post.
   ``Deborah and I are on great terms. It's not Deborah's fault she
is very talented and very beautiful and younger than I,'' Ms.
Pauley said. ``And my relationship with (Gumbel) is as good as it's
ever been.''
   Reports of bickering among the show's cast members have
circulated since March, when a memo written by Gumbel was leaked.
In the memo, he criticized his colleagues, especially weatherman
Willard Scott. Ms. Pauley was not mentioned.
   ``We remain very, very good friends,'' Ms. Pauley said,
referring to Gumbel.
