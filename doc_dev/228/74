   It startled many when NBC's troubled ``Today''
show hired a guy named Joe. But Joe Garagiola, the show's past and
future co-host, laughed Wednesday as he recalled repeating the
wisdom of Yogi Berra to surprised pal.
   ``I said, `Hey, Yogi's right. It's deja vu all over again,' ''
said the 64-year-old ex-catcher, sportscaster and ``Today''
colleague of Hugh Downs and Barbara Walters, and later, Frank
McGee, from 1969 to 1973.
   Garagiola and another new hire, former CBS morning news anchor
Faith Daniels, will make their debut on ``Today'' on June 4 in
Washington _ at the same time NBC affiliates are holding their
annual meeting there.
   The affiliates, who have not been pleased with the state of
``Today,'' may be cheered by the return of the popular Garagiola.
He will guest-host on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
   It's NBC's version of ``Back to the Future'' at a time when
``Today'' is trying to halt a deepening drop in ratings with talk
of restoring the ``family'' atmosphere of yesteryear, a new set,
and a familiar face _ his.
   ``Everybody knows Joe and what he brings to the table,'' said
``Today'' executive producer Tom Capra. ``And that's intelligence,
fun, irreverence and probably laughter. And all those things are
things we need.''
   The show's slide to second behind ABC's ``Good Morning America''
began in January with NBC's much-criticized switch of co-host
Deborah Norville for the well-liked Jane Pauley, a 13-year
``Today'' veteran.
   It also was in January that Garagiola and other former ``Today''
hosts were reunited on the show. Afterwards, Gumbel, a friend,
urged him to return to the show.
   ``Bryant said, `We have a lot of fun, you ought to come back at
least once a month,''' he recalled. However, he said, he was
enjoying semi-retirement and watching his grandchildren grow. His
reply: ``What are you, crazy?''
   About a month later, another ``Today'' friend, movie critic Gene
Shalit, joined him at a benefit banquet and urged him to return to
``Today,'' perhaps once a month, Garagiola said by phone from his
home in Phoenix, Ariz.
   ``I said, `Well, you be my agent, okay?' ''
   Last month, he said, Gumbel called, said changes were afoot,
some people were being added, and that ``I want to put your name in
the hopper.''
   The three-day-a-week deal was agreed on Monday, said Garagiola,
who left NBC Sports in 1988 after 27 years and has been doing
play-by-play coverage of California Angels' home games for cable
TV's SportsChannel.
   Although better known as a sportscaster, ``some of my happiest
days have been on `Today,' '' he said. His interviews on the show
weren't just about sports, and were with a wide variety of guests.
   ``It's nice to know people believe that you can say something
besides curveball or back-door slider,'' he said.
   If his return helps ``Today,'' that won't be too soon for NBC.
   Last week in New York, the nation's largest TV market, the show
even fell to fourth place locally, coming in behind Fox-owned
WNYW-TV's ``Good Day New York.''
