   NBC's ``Today'' show, which will welcome Joe
Garagiola back in June as its third co-host, still has the ratings
blues. It was in second place last week for the 19th straight week,
Nielsen estimates showed Thursday.
   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' remained first in ratings,
averaging a 4.8. ``Today'' averaged a 3.2 and ``CBS This Morning''
a 2.6. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   The 19th week of bad news for ``Today'' came a day after it was
twitted on local TV by WNYW-TV's ``Good Day New York'' show, which
last week beat the slumping NBC show in local Nielsen ratings.
   The needling occurred Wednesday on the East River, where
``Today'' was broadcasting live from a 160-foot luxury yacht.
   Gordon Elliott, who normally barges into homes for live
interviews on ``Good Day,'' dogged the ``Today'' broadcast in a
rented cabin cruiser.
   NBC was not amused, said the puckish Elliott, whom viewers saw
using a bullhorn to hail NBC's show, ask permission to board what
he called the ``S.S. Today,'' and interview co-hosts Bryant Gumbel
and Deborah Norville.
   NBC, though the Coast Guard, ``formally asked us to stay 100
yards from their vessel, which I thought was bad sportsmanship,''
he groused. ``I was going to make our show available to help them
in the ratings.''
   But Elliott can sympathize with ratings woes like those of
``Today.'' He once was a host of ``Good Morning Australia,'' which
at one time also had ratings problems. ``It happens to every
show,'' he said.
