   If inquiring minds really want to know, Joan
Lunden is not leaving ``Good Morning America,'' or getting a
divorce, or having an alien's baby.
   She confided all this Tuesday after telling viewers of ABC's
morning show that National Enquirer reporters have been asking her
colleagues if she seems troubled lately.
   ``It was a pre-emptive strike,'' she said afterwards. ``I told
them (her colleagues), I could either do that or just be a wimp and
sit back and let them make up whatever they want and print it.''
   ``As far as I know, this was just something we were checking out
and we've no plans to run a story,'' said Ian Calder, editor of the
tabloid paper in Lantana, Fla.
   During Tuesday's show, Lunden, speaking with co-host Charles
Gibson, said two free-lance reporters working for the Enquirer, had
been calling her colleagues, and in one case one of them posed as
an ABC publicist.
   She said the tabloid newshawks said things about her, like ``we
hear she's been acting strange lately, crying on the set,
depressed'' _ she mock-whimpered _ ``and we want to know what's
going on in her life.''
   She and her friends have been taking bets on what the Enquirer's
story will be, she said, jokingly posing a multiple-choice question:
   ``Am I going to leave the show, leave my husband, or maybe have
an alien baby? And it turns out they apparently voted for my
husband and I to get a divorce.''
   After the show, she said she isn't leaving her top-rated show,
and she and her husband, Michael Krauss, are not getting a divorce.
   ``And I'm not having an alien baby.''
   The Enquirer this week has a story with the headline ``Friendly
Aliens Altered My Body and Changed My Life.''
   Calder said the queries about Lunden concerned problems her
husband, a TV producer, has had due to lawsuits stemming from
production bills for ``Everyday,'' a syndicated program on which
Lunden is hostess, he said.
   ``We had a tip that that caused some trouble between them,''
said Calder, who denied that the free-lancers checking out the tip
posed as other than themselves.
   ``I think what we were checking out was, in the wake of the
financial problems that her husband had had, if this would affect
the marriage,'' he said. As far as he knows, he said, ``it never
came to anything.''
   There was no query about whether Lunden and her husband, who
have three children, were divorcing, said Calder.
   ``No, I think that's going too far. As far as I know, we never
got a tip they were thinking about getting a divorce.''
