   The head of NBC News conceded to affiliates
Monday ``we screwed up'' the ``Today Show'' with changes that led to
Jane Pauley's leaving in December.
   However, Michael Gartner told the annual NBC affiliates'
convention that key changes have been made, including a new
executive producer for the show, Tom Capra.
   ``Now, with the dust settled, he'll make it, we'll make it,
another winner,'' he said. The show has been second in ratings to
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' for 21 weeks.
   The affection of affiliate executives for Pauley _ succeeded on
``Today'' by Deborah Norville _ was amply illustrated when they gave
her a standing ovation as she appeared on stage at the National
Theater where Gartner spoke.
   ``I have never been happier in my work,'' said Pauley, who is
preparing a series of prime-time specials for NBC and is substitute
evening news anchor when Tom Brokaw is away.
   Gartner didn't specify the mistakes that caused the slump.
   But seeking to make amends to executives of NBC's 208 affiliated
stations, Gartner also tried to show progress on two other news
fronts.
   He said a new 24-hour news service, the NBC News Channel, will
start serving affiliates in January, providing international,
national and regional news for use in their own newscasts.
   The service won't transmit stories on a non-stop basis as does
Cable News Network. Nor will it have news anchors, as some industry
observers thought it would.
   It is intended to help NBC stations compete with CNN's newscasts,
and to ward off further encroachments by CNN on NBC stations.
   CNN says it has 216 broadcast affiliates, of which 52 are NBC
affiliates.
   Gartner also introduced the new executive producer of the
third-in-ratings ``NBC Nightly News,'' Steve Friedman, calling him a
``show doctor'' who will ``make `Nightly' sparkle.''
   Friedman is a former executive producer of ``Today'' credited
with making that show first in ratings before leaving it in 1987 to
create what turned out to be a costly, syndicated flop, ``USA Today
on TV.''
   ``Welcome to NBC News' version of `Back to the Future,'''
Friedman joked, alluding to his return and the re-hiring of Joe
Garagiola as a co-host on ``Today'' with Norville and Bryant Gumbel.
Garagiola was a ``Today'' co-host from 1969 to 1973.
   Garagiola, who is not scheduled to start on ``Today'' until June
11, appeared on stage with Gumbel, Norville, weatherman Willard
Scott, and other new additions _ anchor Faith Daniels and
correspondent Katherine Couric.
   Capra, appearing separately, said Garagiola ``will be the glue
that holds the show together.''
   In speaking of Capra's hiring last year, Gartner said: ``We know
we screwed up the `Today Show.' ... He knows what the show needs and
he knows how to provide it.''
   The usually-brash Friedman was cautious and didn't promise a fast
ratings rise for ``Nightly News.''
   However, he said there would be changes to make the newscast more
of a ratings contender. He didn't outline the changes, citing
competitive reasons.
   Newscasts ``no longer just index the day's events,'' he told an
audience of 1,100.
   ``We can't come on and say, `These are the top stories.' People
have heard them already.'''
   ``We are going to do a show of interest, not the show of
record,'' he added. ``We are going to be active, not reactive.''
   The opening of NBC's three-day session began the same day as Fox
Broadcasting's convention in Los Angeles.
   Atlhough some NBC station executives chatted among themselves
about next fall's Thursday night face-off between NBC's powerhouse
``The Cosby Show'' and Fox's cartoon hit, ``The Simpsons,'' NBC
president Robert C. Wright warned them a battle was beginning on
several fronts.
   NBC, first in prime time for five seasons, is ready for next
fall, he said. ``We've got victories in the future. But they'll be
smaller victories than the ones we enjoyed in the past.''
   Cable has become strong, ``Fox is probably even stronger than we
had anticipated'' and is rapidly moving toward a seven-night
schedule, and ABC and CBS have been rejuvenated, he said.
   To stay a financially strong network, ``we must gain an equal
footing with our unregulated competitors,'' he said. Cable was
de-regulated by Congress in 1984 but is facing some possible
re-regulation.
