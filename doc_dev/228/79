<P>
NBC's "Today" show, which will welcome Joe Garagiola back in June as its third 
co-host, still has the ratings blues. It was in second place last week for the 
19th straight week, Nielsen estimates showed today. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "Good Morning America" remained first in ratings, averaging a 4.8. 
"Today" averaged a 3.2 and "CBS This Morning" a 2.6. Each ratings point 
represents 921,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The 19th week of bad news for "Today" came a day after it was twitted on local 
TV by WNYW-TV's "Good Day New York" show, which last week beat the slumping NBC 
show in local Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The needling occurred Wednesday on the East River, where "Today" was 
broadcasting live from a 160-foot luxury yacht. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Elliott, who normally barges into homes for live interviews on "Good 
Day," dogged the "Today" broadcast in a rented cabin cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
NBC was not amused, said the puckish Elliott, whom viewers saw using a bullhorn 
to hail NBC's show, ask permission to board what he called the "SS Today," and 
interview co-hosts Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, through the Coast Guard, "formally asked us to stay 100 yards from their 
vessel, which I thought was bad sportsmanship," he groused. "I was going to 
make our show available to help them in the ratings." 
</P>
<P>
But Elliott can sympathize with ratings woes like those of "Today." He once was 
a host of "Good Morning Australia," which at one time also had ratings 
problems. "It happens to every show," he said.
