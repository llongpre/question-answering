   ``CBS This Morning'' anchorwoman Kathleen
Sullivan, who said last year that she expected to be replaced if
her show's third-place ratings didn't improve, is being taken off
the program, her spokesman said today.
   ``She was notified by CBS brass Wednesday night,'' said the
spokesman, John Scanlon, who described Sullivan as ``disappointed,
but proud of her contributions to the show.''
   The program, co-anchored by Harry Smith, made no mention today
that she is leaving. Sullivan did not say anything about it on the
air. Terry Everett, a CBS News spokeswoman, said today that the
network ``can't confirm or deny'' reports that she is leaving.
   The anchorwoman, whose CBS contract expires in November, did her
part of today's show from Atlanta. Everett said the anchorwoman had
gone there on personal business.
   Scanlon said no decision has been made yet on when Sullivan will
leave ``CBS This Morning,'' but that she will help the transition
process and ``is looking forward to discussing other possibilities
at CBS.''
   There have been reports that her successor will be Paula Zahn,
anchorwoman of ABC's ``World News This Morning.'' Sullivan
co-anchored that program and news segments of ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' before joining CBS News in 1987.
   ``We have no comment at this point,'' said ABC spokesman Scott
Richardson when asked if Zahn may be leaving ABC for CBS.
   ``CBS This Morning'' has consistently trailed ``Good Morning
America'' and NBC's ``Today'' in the ratings. The latter program
was in the headlines last fall when it became known that Jane
Pauley, the show's co-anchor for 13 years, would be succeeded by
Deborah Norvile.
   Norville began her new job in January.
   In October, during an appearance with Pauley on the ``Donahue''
syndicated talk show, Sullivan said she would be fired if her
show's ratings didn't improve.
   The month before, she riled CBS executives when, while speaking
into a microphone she didn't know was live, she joked that CBS
stood for ``Cheap Broadcasting Service.'' The comment was heard on
CBS' closed-circuit television system, but was not broadcast over
the air.
