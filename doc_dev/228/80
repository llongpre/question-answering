<HEAD>ABC Closing Bureaus in Three Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although it's still earning money, ABC News will
close its bureaus in Chicago, Boston and Dallas because of lean
times, but will maintain reporters in all three cities, an ABC
spokesman said Oct. 18.
   The spokesman, Scott Richardson, said no further cuts were
expected. The bureaus will be closed by Dec. 31.
   The move, which leaves ABC with nine U.S. bureaus, comes as ABC
News is undergoing belt-tightening as a result of Persian Gulf
coverage costs and lower-than-expected advertising revenues that
affect all three networks.
   In Dallas, correspondent Charles Murphy will work from his home.
In Boston, a two-person staff will be kept to work with ABC's
medical correspondent, Dr. Tim Johnson, who reports for several ABC
shows.
   In Chicago, correspondent Chris Bury will work out of ABC-owned
WLS-TV.
   Twelve off-camera staff members are affected by the closings.
Some will be reassigned or offered other jobs and others will be
let go, Richardson said. He said it was not yet known how many
would be laid off.
   CBS, which has seven domestic bureaus, and NBC, which has nine,
have no plans to close any offices, spokeswomen for those networks
said.
   ABC's action was expected. The network earlier put on hold a
planned 1 a.m.-6 a.m. news feed to its affiliates that would have
begun in January. That operation would have employed 40 people.
   ABC News officials have said the division will show a profit
this year despite the lean times, although it probably will earn
about $25 million less than the $75 million that had been
anticipated.
   NBC News recently said it would let go 25 staff members, but it
isn't a cutback, said NBC spokeswoman Peggy Hubble. Their skills
were just not needed for various projects being planned. Ms. Hubble
said NBC is hiring an additional 100 staff members, the majority
for the 24-hour NBC News Channel for affiliates it is starting next
year.
   The remainder would work for the new ``Real Life With Jane
Pauley'' series that NBC says it will add to its schedule as a
midseason replacement.

<HEAD>Gynecologist Refiles Suit Against CBS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former gynecologist James Burt has refiled
his $250 million defamation suit against CBS Inc.
   Last month, U.S. District Judge Walter Rice dismissed a portion
of Burt's suit, saying Burt has no private right of action under
the FCC's personal-attack rule. However, Rice said he would
consider further arguments on the question of whether the statute
of limitations had run out on the CBS broadcast in question.
   Attorney Earl Moore said the suit was refiled Oct. 12 in U.S.
District Court without the arguments on the FCC issue.
   Burt filed the original suit in March, alleging he was defamed
by a CBS television program on his sex-related surgery.
   The October 1988 episode of ``West 57th Street'' featured
interviews with Burt and several of his patients.
   Burt is facing scores of medical malpractice suits for his
self-described ``love surgery,'' in which he physically altered the
genitals of his female patients to allegedly enhance sexual
responsiveness. The suits allege Burt performed the surgery either
without patient consent or by fraudulently obtaining consent.
   In January 1989, Burt surrendered his medical license to the
State Medical Board after being charged with gross immorality and
other violatons.

<HEAD>Newswoman Files Sexual Discrimination Suit Against Dees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newswoman filed a sex discrimination
lawsuit against ``Into the Night'' TV host Rick Dees, claiming she
was publicly humiliated by risque jokes during his appearance on a
TV show.
   Liz Fulton said in her Superior Court suit filed Oct. 16 that
Dees humiliated her by appearing on ``The Wally George Show'' in
1988 with a scantily clad, buxom woman he identified as Miss
Fulton.
   ``This is only the tip of the iceberg on how women are forced to
endure sexual stereotypes in broadcasting. But many don't file
lawsuits because they fear they will be blackballed by the
industry,'' said attorney Gloria Allred.
   Dees, a KIIS-FM radio personality who worked with Miss Fulton
until she was fired in April, recently began as host of the
late-night variety show ``Into the Night Starring Rick Dees.''
   Jack Silver, a spokesman for KIIS-FM, referred all calls to
Gannett Radio, which owns the station.
   ``We have received the documents from Liz Fulton's attorney and
we are now reviewing them,'' said Jay Cook, Gannett Radio
president. ``We will respond when appropriate.''
   While acting as his radio show sidekick, Ms. Fulton said Dees
frequently referred to her as ``Liz Rugburn Fulton.''
   ``In addition,'' the suit said, ``Dees humiliated and damaged
her when he appeared on `The Wally George Show' . . . accompanied
by a woman purporting to be Ms. Fulton who was dressed in a scant
bikini.
   ``The impostor behaved in an inappropriate and embarrassing
manner and was eventually led off the set in handcuffs.''
   Ms. Allred said her client, now a newswoman at KFI radio, never
consented to the impersonation.
   Additionally, the suit states Ms. Fulton, 37, believes she was
fired because ``she was perceived as too old and family oriented
and not sufficiently sexy enough to satisfy Mr. Dees.''
   Dees was accused of employment discrimination on the basis of
sex and age and unauthorized commercial use of Miss Fulton's name,
invasion of privacy, intentional misrepresentation and defamation.
   Ms. Fulton asked for general, compensatory and punitive damages
for humiliation, mental anguish, anger and emotional distress. The
dollar amount would be determined at trial.

<HEAD>Broadcasters Raise $30,000 To Send Radios to Mideast Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. radio stations have received pledges of
$30,000 and are seeking more donations to buy radios and batteries
for use by American troops in the Persian Gulf region, the National
Association of Broadcasters said Oct. 18.
   The first shipment of radios already has arrived in the gulf
from the AIR-LIFT listener donation campaign.
   The association launched the effort last month in conjunction
with Westinghouse Electric's Group W Radio. An additional 6,000
batteries and receivers, including 5,000 sets from Sony, will be en
route to the Middle East the week of Oct. 22, the trade group said.
   The radios can be used to pick up the Armed Forces Radio and
Television Service, which has begun broadcasting to American troops
in the region.

<HEAD>David Hartman Gets Syndicated Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former ``Good Morning America'' host David
Hartman is returning to daily television next year as host of a
syndicated program to be called ``Realities With David Hartman.''
   Hartman, the first host of ABC's morning show, left it in 1987
after 11 years. The new series will have a magazine format and
probe ``the issues and experiences that affect people in their
daily lives,'' according to the producers, Viacom Enterprises and
Greystone Communications.
