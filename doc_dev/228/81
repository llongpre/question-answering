   CBS, trying to raise the low ratings of its
late-night and morning shows, is putting a veteran sports producer
with ``The Pat Sajak Show'' and two new reporters on ``CBS This
Morning.''
   Sajak's talk show will be getting Michael Weisman, an NBC Sports
producer for 15 years, as co-executive producer. Sajak is the other
executive producer. Weisman has won 10 Emmy awards for his sports
telecasts.
   The reporters joining ``CBS This Morning'' are Steve Kmetko, of
KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, and Wayne Freedman, formerly of KRON-TV in
San Francisco. Kmetko will report on the entertainment industry but
continue at KCBS. Freedman, who will be a features reporter for the
CBS show, will be based here.
   CBS announced the staff changes Monday. A spokesman also said
that director Peter Bogdanovich, who had reviewed videocassettes of
classic films and interviewed film figures for CBS' morning show,
is leaving the program.
   The show, co-anchored by Harry Smith and Kathleen Sullivan, is a
distant third in ratings against NBC's top-rated ``Today'' show and
ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Sajak's show also has struggled in the ratings since its Jan. 9
debut. It began as a 90-minute program, but on Oct. 30 was cut back
to an hour each night.
