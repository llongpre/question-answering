   CBS Inc. said its news division will assume production of its troubled early-morning news and information show, "The Morning Program," on Nov. 30. 

   Under the transfer, Mariette Hartley and Rolland Smith, who are co-hosts, and Bob Shanks, executive producer, will leave the program, which had tried to attract viewers with a lighter, more upbeat format than on Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s second-ranked "Good Morning America" and the top-rated "Today" show of National Broadcasting Co., a General Electric Co. unit. 
The program included regular appearances by stand-up comedians, for example. 

   CBS will provide details for a revamped "Morning Program" next week. 
Sources said CBS is trying to recruit an ABC News correspondent, Kathleen Sullivan, to co-host the show with Charles Osgood, a veteran of CBS News. 

   "The Morning Program" had its debut in January in the 7:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. EST period, replacing "The CBS Morning News," which was moved to 6 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. EST, and which had lagged in the ratings. 
Responsibility for the broadcast had been removed from CBS News and turned over to CBS network officials. 
Because of lower costs and strong appeal among younger viewers, "The Morning Program" proved profitable, unlike "The CBS Morning News." 

   But "The Morning Program" failed to attract even as many viewers as the show it replaced. 
Thus, CBS officials feared the network's affiliate stations would begin dropping the program without improvement in ratings.
