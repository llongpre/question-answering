   Network stars scrambled to get into Iraq for
more hot news on the Middle East crisis. But John Palmer, late of
``Today,'' was here, working on a show about somewhat older stories.
   Like stories that go as far back as 30 years, sometimes farther.
   The show: ``Instant Recall,'' a half-hour, daily series which
goes into production on Aug. 27. Sold to about 75 stations, it will
premiere on Sept. 3. Perchance it might someday chronicle the
``Today'' show?
   ``That would be spell-binding television,'' laughs Palmer, who
left NBC News in March after 26 years there. His final years were
as the ``Today'' news anchor until Deborah Norville was given the
job in September.
   That shift touched off a certain amount of uproar that increased
when Norville succeeded Jane Pauley as co-anchor. ``Today'' has
been second in ratings since Pauley left in January to begin life
anew in prime time.
   Palmer, a respected newsman who at one time was NBC's White
House correspondent, began his life anew as host of a syndicated
series, originally called ``Only Yesterday.''
   Its name later was changed to ``Instant Recall'' lest the series
be thought of as perhaps too much of a stroll down memory lane, he
says.
   It does have ``a veneer of nostalgia,'' he says, but it's
basically a look back at stories, not all earth-shaking, that have
affected the lives of people, with some of those people narrating
the pieces.
   The stories, followed by a segment called ``Shared
Recollections: John Palmer's Diary,'' are about such varied things
as:
   _A 1944 circus fire in Hartford, Conn., that killed 138 people.
   _The toymaker who in 1977 scaled the heights of New York's World
Trade Center the hard way _ from the outside _ and was asked for
his autograph by two cops sent to arrest him.
   _Hurricane Carla in 1961 and CBS anchorman Dan Rather's memories
of covering it for the Houston station where he began his TV career.
   There'll be two main stories per show, each starting with what
Palmer calls ``a time capsule, memory triggers that put the viewer
in the setting,'' and a lot of music from the year in which the
story occurred.
   ``It stands or falls on the basis of the quality of the
stories,'' Palmer says. ``There are no re-creations. It's all
actual news footage.''
   Palmer isn't the only network graduate working on the show.
   Its executive producer is former ABC News Vice President Av
Westin, the senior producer is Dan Cooper, formerly of ABC's
``20-20,'' and ``there are a lot of people here from CBS and NBC,''
Palmer says.
   But now and then, the 54-year-old journalist does miss those of
the old gang who still are working at NBC News: ``I feel kind of a
longing, sometimes, for a lot of terribly good friends.
   ``But I must say this. I was was thinking the other day what a
difference a year makes _ that Jane Pauley and I both have our new
programs, we can both sleep later, and if my show is half as
successful as hers, I would be very, very happy.''
   He still keeps in touch with the former ``Today'' co-anchor, who
has had ratings success this summer with her ``Real Life With Jane
Pauley'' series of specials.
   He also still considers ``Today'' weatherman Willard Scott a
friend, likewise the show's prickly anchor, Bryant Gumbel. About
the show's much-written-about woes, Palmer has this to say:
   ``It wasn't a screwup of the cast. It was management.''
   Although when he left NBC he admitted he found that ``a little
scary,'' he has no regrets now: ``Not one morning have I awakened,
feeling, `Hey, maybe you did the wrong thing.'
   ``Win, lose or draw, this was right, and this is the right
time.''
