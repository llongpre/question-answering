   NEW YORK -- NBC News is expected to announce today that it
is removing Deborah Norville as co-anchor of the morning
"Today" show after less than 14 months.
   Ms. Norville, who had been scheduled to return from a
maternity leave this month, will be succeeded by Katie
Couric, who had been substituting for the "Today" co-anchor,
officials familiar with the plans said.

   When Ms. Norville was elevated to the "Today" co-anchor
position, she received a five-year contract valued at $1
million annually. One network official said Ms. Norville was
offered the job of anchoring "NBC News at Sunrise," a
half-hour broadcast that precedes "Today." The official said
Ms. Norville -- who held the "Sunrise" position when she
joined NBC News in 1987 -- declined the assignment.
   Ms. Norville couldn't be reached for comment. It couldn't
be learned whether she will be offered another post or how
her contract will be handled by the National Broadcasting Co.
network, a unit of General Electric Co.
   NBC News President Michael Gartner didn't return a
telephone call seeking comment, nor did an NBC News
spokeswoman. Ms. Norville's agent, Jim Griffin at the William
Morris Agency, was out of town and couldn't be reached for
comment.
   The move wasn't entirely unexpected. The ratings at
"Today" sank after Ms. Norville succeeded the popular Jane
Pauley. NBC officials were said to be concerned at the lack
of on-screen chemistry between Ms. Norville and co-anchor
Bryant Gumbel.
   Since Ms. Couric, an NBC News Pentagon correspondent,
joined the program, ratings for "Today" have risen. Last
week, "Today" was only three-tenths of a ratings point behind
top-rated "Good Morning America" on the ABC network, a unit
of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. That was the closest "Today" has
come to the rival program's rating since last August.
   Ms. Couric is due to go on maternity leave herself in
July.
