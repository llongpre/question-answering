   ABC soap opera star Susan Lucci, always an Emmy
nominee but never a winner, was nominated Thursday for her 11th
Emmy in as many years as a total of 205 daytime Emmy nominations
were announced here.
   CBS' veteran ``Guiding Light'' and ``The Young and the
Restless'' led the pack with 14 nominations each, followed by 13
for ABC's ``All My Children'' in which Lucci stars and 12 for CBS'
``Pee-Wee's Playhouse.''
   The nominations for the 17th annual Daytime Emmy Awards even
included two for a rival awards show, NBC's ``The 6th Annual Soap
Opera Awards.''
   CBS shows easily lead the nominations, getting 74, followed by
39 for ABC, 30 for NBC, 29 for PBS, and 29 for syndicated programs.
There only were two cable nominees.
   One was for a Home Box Office special, ``Buy Me That'' which
warned parents and kids of deceptive advertising, and another for
the lighting of an MTV special, ``Club MTV.''
   Winners in the major categories will be announced here on June
28 in a two-hour ABC broadcast hosted by Oprah Winfrey. The show
will be aired live in the East at 3 p.m. EDT, but shown in the West
on a tape-delay basis at 2 p.m. PDT.
   There also will be a non-televised Emmy ceremony in Los Angeles
on June 23, primarily for winners in such creative arts categories
as hair design, makeup, editing, and graphics and title design.
   The nominations in 51 categories were jointly announced by the
Los Angeles-based Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and the
New York-based National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
   In the talk show field, ``The Joan Rivers Show'' and ``The Oprah
Winfrey'' show each got four nominations, followed by three for
Phil Donahue's ``Donahue'' and two for ``Sally Jessy Raphael.'' All
are syndicated series.
   Geraldo Rivera's syndicated ``Geraldo'' wasn't cited, though,
and the only network morning show nominated for Emmy honors was
ABC's top-rated ``Good Morning America,'' which got two nominations.
   CBS' ``The Price Is Right'' led the game show race with six
nominations, followed by the syndicated ``Jeopardy,'' which got
four.
   Although ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse'' was the most-nominated
children's series, PBS' long-running ``Sesame Street'' got nine
nominations. CBS' ``Jim Henson's Muppet Babies'' and PBS' ```Mister
Rogers' Neighborhood'' and ``Square One TV'' each got four.
