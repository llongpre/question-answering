   Television producer David Nuell is leaving the
syndicated show ``Entertainment Tonight'' to rejoin NBC, with duties
in news, sports and entertainment, network officials said Tuesday.
   In January, Nuell will become senior executive producer of the
morning news program ``Today.'' Where that leaves Marty Ryan, the
current job-holder, has not been determined.
   Nuell worked in various capacities at NBC before he became
executive producer of ``Entertainment Tonight'' in 1986. He spent 15
years as an executive at WRC-TV, the NBC-owned station in
Washington, D.C.
   Besides his work at ``Today,'' Nuell will develop a sports
program as part of the network's daily coverage of the 1992 Summer
Olympics in Barcelona. He also will head development of a daytime
series, the nature of which has not been revealed.
   His hiring was jointly announced by NBC Entertainment president
Brandon Tartikoff, NBC News president Michael Gartner, and NBC
Sports president Dick Ebersol.
   ``David brings the type of depth, imagination, talent and range
that is essential if NBC is to thrive and prosper in the
increasingly competitive television environment of the 1990s,'' they
said.
   Nuell will be the second ``Entertainment Tonight'' executive
producer to take over a network morning show in three yea-host Jane Pauley.
   ``Today'' for several years usually has led in the morning-show
ratings race, and has been first in ratings for 14 of the last 15
weeks over ABC's rival ``Good Morning America,'' according to a
spokesman for ``Today.''
   Peggy Hubble, an NBC News spokeswoman, said the ratings victories
had been close ones, and that Nuell's hiring was part of a move to
make certain ``Today'' continues its ratings leadership.
