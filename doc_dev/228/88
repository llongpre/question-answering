<LEADPARA>  THE new co-anchor of the "Today" show makes a goofy face and then breaks into
a smile -- a fabulous, crooked smile that slides across her face like a puppy
on linoleum. She pulls out a letter from an 83-year-old Scot:;    "Dear Katie:
Your hairdo is for the birds. You have it puffed up on the left side, then
combed at a straight 45-degree angle. It could readily be the ski slope for an
adventurous sparrow. It is totally lacking in symmetry."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Somehow, it always comes back to the hair. Barbara Walters was a carefully
teased brunette when she worked on the show. Jane Pauley survived 13 years and
as many bad hairstyles only to be supplanted by Deborah Norville, whose
perfect blond curls turned out to be a bit too perfect and a bit too blond.;  
 Up popped Katie Couric, the hair apparent, with a short, defiant mop. NBC
asked her to grow it out for a "softer" look. She refused.;    The ratings of
"Today" are suddenly within half a rating point of top-rated "Good Morning
America," and the credit is going to the 34-year-old native of Arlington, Va.
She's plunked down in a booth at a D.C. diner where there's a Wurlitzer
jukebox at each table. She wanted to meet here -- it's fun and playful and
almost as cute as she is, even though she hates it when people say things like
that.;    "I don't really do perky," she says, sipping a chocolate shake
through a straw. "I hate that word. I hate the 'C' word and the 'P' word,"
says Couric, who is 5 feet 3 1/2 inches tall.;    She spent 12 years trying
not to be cute because they said she looked too young to be taken seriously.
She started calling herself Katherine on the air. She never thought of herself
as a glamour girl anchor type, so she concentrated on a reporting career.;   
Then suddenly, she's the savior of "Today" because she slugs Bryant Gumbel in
the arm. Because she's a Katie.;    NBC News Washington bureau chief Tim
Russert hired Couric away from WRC-TV in Washington in 1989 for the No. 2 spot
at the Pentagon. "She was articulate, direct, and there was a real wholesome
appeal," says Russert. "It's a perfect match if you can mix a good reporter
with good broadcaster.";    She got the job shortly before her wedding and
spent her honeymoon in Italy studying military guides. The Panama invasion was
her first chance to show her stuff.;    Couric almost got the "Today"
co-anchor spot last July when Norville was proving to be a ratings disaster.
NBC executives huddled and decided to keep Norville with Gumbel and weather
forecaster Willard Scott, adding Joe Garagiola, news reader Faith Daniels and
Couric in the newly created position of national correspondent.;    She spent
Thanksgiving in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Persian Gulf War sharing the
NBC Pentagon office with senior correspondent Fred Francis. Francis
chain-smoked; Couric threw up between live shots. She was pregnant, but didn't
tell anyone. "She didn't want anyone to think she couldn't handle the
pressure," says a friend.;    In February, Couric began filling in for
Norville who was scheduled to return from maternity leave in late April.
According to NBC, Norville requested a year off after the birth of her son.
She got a second bundle: NBC bought out Norville's highly publicized no-cut
contract for several million dollars. Couric is now earning a little more than
half of what Norville did -- between $500,000 and $600,000 a year -- according
to the talk around New York.;    "She's been terrific," says Gumbel. "Katie's
easygoing, she's bright, she's curious, she's fun to be with." Couric gets
high marks from her co-anchor for handling the pressures of a live, two-hour
show every morning. Plus, she doesn't mind the animal segments. (;    "I think
there's much more that goes into anchoring the "Today' show -- not just the
personality, the happy talk, the clever banter and all that," Couric says. "I
feel that I'm using a lot of the skills that I honed when I was a reporter."; 
  One NBC source says Couric insisted that she be a genuine co-anchor as a
condition of accepting the job, getting equal air time and an equal number of
serious interviews as Gumbel.;    Couric's proud of the interviews she's done
with Doug Wilder, King Hussein of Jordan and Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, whom she
met last fall in Saudi Arabia and snagged for his first post-war interview.;  
 Couric grew up confident, outgoing and the center of attention.;    She
graduated from high school in 1975 and the University of Virginia four years
later, where she was an honors student in American Studies, and associate
editor of the school newspaper.;    Her father, who was an associate news
editor with United Press, suggested she pursue radio or television for one,
specific reason: Money. In 1979 she talked her way into the office of the
assistant bureau chief at ABC and landed an entry-level position.;    Less
than a year later, she joined CNN's new Washington bureau as an assignment
editor. She did occasional on-air reports until an executive ordered her
forever off the air.;    "Oh, I was bad. My voice sort of sounded like that."
She does a squeaky falsetto. "I was pretty awful.";    She started with a
voice coach when she moved to Atlanta, this time as an assistant producer for
a CNN talk show, where she slipped onto the air again with occasional feature
stories. She landed a temporary spot as an on-air political correspondent for
CNN during the 1984 presidential campaign but was not offered a reporting job
after the election.;    She got a job as a cub reporter at WTVJ in Miami --
two newscasts a day, covering immigration and crime.;    Back to Washington,
where she was hired as a late news reporter for Channel 4. Couric won a local
Emmy in 1989 for a story on a dating service for the handicapped. Still,
political stories remain her chief interest.;    "You can throw anything at
her and she can handle it," says Bret Marcus, her boss at WRC -- except
anchoring. He gave her a chance doing prime-time news summaries and she says,
"I was terrible, and I was a wreck.";    Her contract came up. Marcus urged
her to accept an offer with NBC for the No. 2 spot at the Pentagon -- a
low-profile but promising position.;    A year ago, she and her husband, Jay
Monahan, were just a two-career couple living in a one-bedroom condominium in
Washington. Now they're hunting for a nanny, an apartment in New York and
trying to steal weekends at their 200-year-old farmhouse in the Shenandoah
Valley.;    They met at a party three years ago. "She was very funny," says
Monahan, 35. "In some ways she reminds me of my younger sister. She has a good
sense of self. There's something about being the youngest child in a close
family that leads to that.";    They were married in a year. They bought the
farmhouse so Monahan, a Civil War buff, could soak up his favorite hobby on
weekends. The new baby is due July 21.;    Given the rise in "Today's"
ratings, NBC wants her back as quickly as possible: She plans to take off
about two months for maternity leave. If she's anything like Jane Pauley,
motherhood will only make her more popular with viewers.;    "She has a
comfortable, easy-to-live-with look, pretty without knocking you off your
chair," wrote a New York Times critic. "Her outfits are attractively
businesslike, and her hairdo does not seem to cost what it must cost.";   
He's right: She does her own hair.  </TEXT>
