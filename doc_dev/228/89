CBS, trying to raise the low ratings of its late-night and morning shows, is 
putting a veteran sports producer with "The Pat Sajak Show" and two new 
reporters on "CBS This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
Sajak's talk show will get Michael Weisman, an NBC Sports producer for 15 
years, as co-executive producer. Sajak is the other executive producer. Weisman 
has won 10 Emmy awards for sports telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
The reporters joining "CBS This Morning" are Steve Kmetko of KCBS-TV in Los 
Angeles and Wayne Freedman, formerly of KRON-TV in San Francisco. Kmetko will 
report on the entertainment industry but continue at KCBS. Freedman, who will 
be a features reporter for the CBS show, will be based here. 
</P>
<P>
CBS announced the staff changes Monday. A spokesman also said that director 
Peter Bogdanovich, who had reviewed videocassettes of classic films and 
interviewed film figures for CBS' morning show, is leaving the program. 
</P>
<P>
The show, co-anchored by Harry Smith and Kathleen Sullivan, is a distant third 
in ratings against NBC's top-rated "Today" show and ABC's "Good Morning 
America." 
</P>
<P>
Sajak's show has struggled in the ratings since its Jan. 9 debut. It began as a 
90-minute program but was cut back to just an hour on Oct. 30.
