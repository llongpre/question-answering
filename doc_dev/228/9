   In the third farewell to viewers by a network
news anchorwoman since October, Kathleen Sullivan of ``CBS This
Morning'' said goodbye Friday and obliquely confirmed that Paula
Zahn will succeed her.
   However, CBS News spokesman Tom Goodman said the network had no
announcement to make on Sullivan's successor. A CBS source said the
announcement of the hiring of Zahn, who has left ABC, is expected
Tuesday.
   In her goodbye to viewers, Sullivan, who had co-anchored the
show with Harry Smith since its premiere in November 1987, appeared
upbeat but near tears.
   ``Paula Zahn has been the stepmother to two of my other children
at ABC, and now I'm sure she'll take great care of my third, `CBS
This Morning,''' she said.
   Before joining CBS, Sullivan co-anchored ABC's ``World News This
Morning'' and the news segments of ``Good Morning America.'' She
was succeeded on those programs by Zahn, who said her farewells on
the latter show Thursday.
   NBC's Jane Pauley, replaced by Deborah Norville in January as
co-host of the ``Today'' show, confirmed that controversial move on
the air Oct. 29, and made her farewell on the show Dec. 29. She
remains at NBC News.
   Zahn's agent, Richard Leibner, has said his client is going to
CBS but said Friday that a few details still must ironed out.
   According to a source close to her contract talks, ABC officials
liked her work but decided not to make a counter-offer to CBS'
offer of a $1.1 million-a-year, four-year contract.
   CBS has said ``CBS Morning News'' co-anchor Faith Daniels will
be next week's temporary co-anchor of ``CBS This Morning.''
   On Friday, Sullivan did not say why she was leaving.
   Her agent, Ron Konecky, has said CBS executives gave no reason
for their decision to replace her, and that he is discussing other
possibilities for her at CBS. Her contract expires in November.
   Sullivan told viewers that she's proud of what her show
accomplished: ``We've restored the credibility that said we meant
business in the morning here at CBS.''
   Her program's predecessor, ``The Morning Show,'' was a frothy,
short-lived entertainment show that CBS tried after years of
generally failing to make a dent in morning ratings with a news
program.
   There were cheers at CBS News when it got the morning time
period back and put in ``CBS This Morning.'' The program, while
getting a larger audience than its predecessor, still is a distant
third in ratings to ``Good Morning America'' and NBC's ``Today.''
   Noting that eight of her 10 years on national television have
been on morning shows, Sullivan said she plans to take a break.
   ``I'm hoping to do some really wild and wonderful things,'' she
said, but didn't elaborate.
   ``So, if I show up on your doorstep because I ran out of gas or
my horse broke down, please don't forget me.''
   Alluding to the 1984 Olympics telecasts she co-anchored while at
ABC, she concluded her farewell by saying, ``Yeah, I'm the one who
wore the sweaters in the Olympics. ... I'm a bit older, but I'm
also a bit wiser.''
