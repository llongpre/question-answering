<HEAD>Minority Broadcasters Cheered by Supreme Court Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minority broadcasters said a June 27 Supreme
Court decision upholding the Federal Communications Commission's
affirmative action rules will spur efforts to increase minority
ownership of radio and TV stations.
   James L. Winston, executive director of the National Association
of Black-Owned Broadcasters, said the decision ``means the FCC's
ability to help promote minority ownership can now go forward
without fear of constitutional challenge.
   ``While this still ... is not at the level we would like to see,
we are pleased that the ability of the FCC to utilize policies to
increase ownership will be allowed to continue and expand.''
   Before the FCC established the rules in 1978, blacks owned about
30 radio stations and one television station, according to the
association. Now, blacks own 182 radio stations and 17 television
stations, the group said Wednesday.
   That represents an increase from 1 percent to about 3.5 percent
of the nation's radio and TV stations, the FCC said.
   Those numbers are likely to grow now that the legal
uncertainties have been lifted from the rules, broadcasters said.
   Eddie Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, said the decision ``affirms the FCC's ability to
improve the under-representation of minorities in broadcast
ownership.''
   The rules that were upheld award preference to minorities
seeking broadcast licenses. The FCC ``comparative'' licensing
process also gives preference to competing applicants based on
other factors, such as whether prospective owners plan to operate
the station. Female applicants also receive extra points, but the
court said it was not ruling on gender preference.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Approves Re-Regulation Measure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee approved a bill June 27
designed to control prices for basic cable TV services and ensure
competition.
   The voice vote by the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications subcommittee paralleled a Senate committee's
near-unanimous approval earlier in June of legislation that also
would restore some of the oversight on the cable industry that
Congress lifted in 1984.
   The House version, however, would make it easier to prove that
existing cable rates are too high, and could lead to price cuts in
some instances, said Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the
Consumer Federation of America.
   ``This is a very significant consumer victory,'' Kimmelman said
of the House bill. If enacted, ``it will finally bring cable rates
down to reasonable levels and promote competition ... most usefully
in rural America.''
   The cable TV industry opposed the House bill immediately.
   ``We are very troubled by this bill,'' said James Mooney,
president of the National Cable Television Association. He said
many important issues remain to be resolved when the bill goes to
the full Commerce Committee.

<HEAD>CBS Gets PGA Championship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS added another major event to its sports
collection June 27, taking the PGA Championship away from ABC.
   CBS will begin televising the tournament in 1991. The network
already televises the Masters and 16 other PGA Tour events.
   ABC has televised the PGA Championship since 1965. Prior to
that, CBS broadcast the tournament from 1958-1964.
   Terms of the contract were not announced.
   One day earlier, CBS acquired the rights to Big Ten basketball
games beginning in the 1991-92 season.

<HEAD>Tisch Denies Rumors on Studio Merger or Sale of CBS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. chief Laurence A. Tisch says he's in
the television business for the long run despite persistent rumors
he may sell the network or merge it with the Walt Disney Co. or
another studio.
   ``One (additional) ratings point in prime time can do more than
any acquisition that we could make in the next five years,'' Tisch
told reporters on June 27, the first day of CBS' annual convention
of affiliated television stations.
   He said the company's billions in cash earns interest every day,
and he feels ``no need to move quickly'' to acquire other companies
even though he's always looking for opportunities.
   ``I don't think it would make any difference to combine a
network with a studio _ I don't think it strengthens our
position,'' Tisch said.

<HEAD>Lunden Hired To Host TV Program Designed for Waiting Rooms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joan Lunden, co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' show, has been signed to host a new television program
that Whittle Communications plans to put in medical waiting rooms
this fall.
   Lunden has signed a three-year contract to host Special Reports
Television, a commercially sponsored TV show that premieres in
October.
   Whittle Communications, based in Knoxville, Tenn., expects the
one-hour program will be airing continuously in 20,000 doctors'
reception areas by January, reaching an annual audience of almost
50 million viewers, mainly young mothers.
   The company is now approaching advertisers about buying
commercial time on the programs and is recruiting doctors who will
let it put its television set in their waiting rooms and will play
the program through the working day.
