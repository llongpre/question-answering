Television's late-night battleground is about to flare up again with new 
contenders trying to emulate Arsenio Hall's success and fill the gap of Pat 
Sajak's defunct CBS talk show. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles disc jockey Rick Dees enters the arena the week of July 16 with a 
new ABC variety series that will follow Ted Koppel's "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
CBS, which is holding its annual affiliates meeting today and Friday at the 
Century Plaza, is expected to announce new shows to fill the gap left by the 
Sajak series -- and stem the defection of its stations in the profitable late 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
The fierce competition points up vividly the importance of Johnny Carson and 
David Letterman to NBC, the only securely anchored network around the midnight 
hour and thereafter. Despite the brilliance of "Nightline," it has given ABC 
only 30 minutes of late-night programming. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's impact was felt dramatically when a station in St. Louis, the nation's 
18th biggest TV market, disclosed recently that it is planning to drop 
"Nightline" and replace it with Hall's show. The station said it regretted 
losing "Nightline" but that Hall was hot and ABC would not allow the Koppel 
series to be pushed back 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
While Hall's show runs only one hour, it is being packaged in some markets in 
the future with a 30-minute variety series starring Nia Peeples -- with both 
programs coming out of Paramount, which is handling the sales. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The Arsenio Hall Show' is one of the hottest properties in syndication and 
has the potential to be the late-night franchise going into the future," said 
Wayne Thomas, general manager of the St. Louis station, KTVI, adding that he 
hoped an arrangement could be worked out with ABC to keep "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
ABC's gamble on Dees is a big one. The network is formidable on almost all 
fronts -- "Good Morning America," daytime programming, Peter Jennings' nightly 
news and prime time -- but it has been unsuccessful for years in trying to find 
a late-night series that could follow "Nightline" and allow ABC to tap into the 
profit center of TV's wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's best move in this area came several years ago when it tried to lure Larry 
King away from CNN. The idea, says the CNN star, was to have him follow 
"Nightline" so that ABC could boast the tandem of Koppel and King -- in short, 
TV's two top interviewers. But King opted to remain with CNN, as he also did 
recently when CBS approached him to do a late-night series. 
</P>
<P>
So now, for ABC, it's up to the new series "Into the Night Starring Rick Dees" 
-- a seemingly unlikely, incompatible pairing with the distinguished Koppel. 
</P>
<P>
But Hall, who has clearly energized late-night, apparently has encouraged the 
belief that it is open to freshness and that anything is possible. And summer 
seems a logical time for ABC to give Dees a shot. 
</P>
<P>
The situation at CBS is far more dire. Last in prime time, last with "CBS This 
Morning," no longer first with Dan Rather's nightly news, the network finds 
some solace from good ratings with its daytime shows, but even there its young 
female demographics are not as good as ABC's. And now the void left by the 
Sajak show leaves CBS with another major problem to solve. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, CBS filled the slot nicely by rerunning multipart stories from an 
admired crime series, "Wiseguy." But it was a stopgap measure that predictably 
brought CBS station-clearance headaches from its affiliates, some of whom also 
pushed the late-hour lineup even further back into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Now the network must find something more permanent, and among the reported 
entries for its late-night future are a series from producer Norman Lear, 
several action-adventure programs and, starting next month, a group of 
talk-show hosts trying out to see who does best. Lear was behind two memorable 
late-night comedies, "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" and "Fernwood 2-Night." 
</P>
<P>
A winning late-night lineup is critical to TV stations because it provides an 
attractive "lead-out" to news programs -- meaning, for instance, that viewers 
may tune in an 11 p.m. newscast on KNBC Channel 4 knowing that Carson will 
follow. Or they may watch the 11 p.m. news on KABC Channel 7 while waiting for 
Koppel's "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
Since local news is a primary image of most TV stations and a chief source of 
their income, the late-night lineups that follow impact heavily on their 
revenues. At KTVI in St. Louis, general manager Thomas said that acquiring 
Arsenio Hall would "help our news audience." 
</P>
<P>
Thus CBS' highest priorities these days -- besides developing a winning 
prime-time schedule -- include building a solid late-night program block to 
secure its relationship with its affiliates, who are the backbone of a network. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Hall, though syndicated, has a much stronger late-night presence 
than CBS. ABC's Koppel is also stronger. And NBC's team of Carson, Letterman 
and all-pro "Tonight" sub Jay Leno takes on special meaning as a uniquely 
dependable area of programming for the network's member stations.
