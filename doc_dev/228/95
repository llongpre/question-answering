<TEXT>     A Miami native who is a supervising producer at "Today," Zucker has been
there only since January 1989. NBC is the only place he has worked since
graduating from Harvard in 1986 with a degree in U.S. history.;   NBC News
announced Monday that he would succeed Tom Capra as executive producer of the
show's weekday version, effective Jan. 14, the 40th anniversary of the
program.;   "It is pretty quick," Zucker said of his rapid rise. But "I think
I've worked hard and dedicated myself to learning the business.";   Capra is
going back to Los Angeles at his own request to NBC's entertainment side as an
executive producer of TV movies and miniseries.;   Capra, son of the late film
director Frank Capra, took over "Today" in January 1990 after the Deborah
Norville debacle that put the once-dominant show behind ABC's "Good Morning
America" in the ratings.;   Under his direction, "Today" gradually has been
recovering.;   Nielsen estimates for the week ending Nov. 22 show that it tied
its ABC rival for the third time since September, with each show averaging a
4.3 rating. "CBS This Morning" had a 2.8. Each ratings point represents
921,000 homes.;   Zucker said he plans no substantial changes in the show and
doesn't anticipate any problems with older staffers.;   "I understand that
people are surprised by my age and all that," he said, "but I think that in
the last year I've been able to prove that I have the ability and that I'm
capable.";   He said he never really planned on getting into television. While
president of Harvard's student paper, the Crimson, he thought he'd go to law
school, then into print journalism, he said. But after graduation, he was
offered and accepted "a job I felt I couldn't pass up" -- as an Olympics
researcher for NBC.;   "They were going to fly me around their world at their
expense, and I was going to have great fun for two more years," he said. "And
so I passed up going to law school. One thing led to another, and here we
are.";   NBC has also announced that Bryant Gumbel, on a planned vacation from
"Today" until Monday, has signed a new three-year contract to continue as
co-host of the show.;   Salary terms weren't disclosed. According to a
published report, Gumbel's previous contract paid him $7 million over three
years.;   Gumbel, who succeeded Tom Brokaw on the program, will celebrate his
10th anniversary with the show Jan. 4. He joined NBC in 1975 as co-host of an
NFL pre-game show on Sundays.  </TEXT>
