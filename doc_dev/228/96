<HEAD>Barbara Walters to Interview Bryant Gumbel</HEAD>

   Barbara Walters, co-anchor of ABC's ``20-20,''
will conduct a rare interview of Bryant Gumbel, co-host of NBC's
``Today'' show, for the March 16 edition of her program, ABC News
said Tuesday.
   Walters' interview with Gumbel, whose show has trailed ABC's
rival ``Good Morning America'' in the ratings for the past eight
weeks, is the latest instance of one network anchor interviewing
another.
   Bob Costas, whose late-night NBC show last month featured his
interview with ABC ``Nightline'' anchorman Ted Koppel, himself
recently was interviewed by Dick Cavett for the ``The Dick Cavett
Show'' on cable television's CNBC.
   That program is to be shown Wednesday.
