   Mention Saudia Arabia, and most people won't
think of sharks. Or bats. Or baboons.
   How about monsoon rains _ or migratory birds splashing around in
marshes created from 40,000-year-old fossil waters?
   These and numerous other natural wonders actually exist in Saudi
Arabia, and they're captured on film for disbelieving Western eyes
in a new three-part series, ``Arabia: Sand, Sea &amp; Sky,'' debuting
Tuesday on cable TV's Discovery Channel.
   The series, by British producer-director Michael McKinnon,
should give viewers a new perspective on a region mostly associated
with sand dunes, oil fields and ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
   McKinnon was researching his 1985 documentary on the Arabian
culture, ``Treasure of the Gulf,'' when he discovered that the
western end of Saudi Arabia along the Red Sea harbored a wonderful
abundance of wildlife, vegetation and strange geological forms.
   Coral reefs sheltered fish, eels and sharks. On land, there were
mangroves. In the foothills, forests of junipers, acacias and palms
were inhabited by birds, bats, lizards, butterflies and large
mammals, including hundreds of thousands of baboons, mountain
camels and small herds of the rare ibex. Farther north, the
remnants of extinct volcanoes created a pseudolunar landscape.
   ``I said, `My God, this is a completely unknown thing,'''
McKinnon recalled in a recent interview.
   His documentary series has proved to be an eye-opener not only
to Westerners, but to Arabs as well.
   ``I think it will be a surprise for most Arabian viewers,''
McKinnon said.
   At preview showings of the series, he said, ``It's been a
consistent reaction among people of the peninsula that there was
this diversity of wildlife in the peninsula.''
   The first episode, ``The Mountain Barrier,'' focuses on the
relatively lush foothills along the western and southwestern coasts
of the Saudi peninsula. The greenery owes its existence primarily
to a 1,000-mile string of western mountains reaching 13,000 feet
high that wring most of the moisture out of eastward-sailing Red
Sea clouds.
   At the same time, oil-financed irrigation projects seem to be
creating a new ecological order. Migratory birds have changed their
routes to take advantage of newly created wetlands from irrigation
projects that are pumping fossil waters from 3,000 feet beneath the
parched surface.
   Cinematographers John Bulmor and Tony Bomford do a fine job in
capturing these images, and Richard Kiley provides suitably spare
narration.
   The second episode, ``Red Sea Rift,'' deals with the rich
underwater flora and fauna along the Red Sea coast. The final
segment, ``Eye of the Camel,'' focuses on the mammoth southeastern
sand desert, the Rub Al Khali, and the traditional Bedouin
lifestyle that is under siege from agribusiness, oil and
superhighways.
   McKinnon noted that conservation is making a comeback in Saudi
Arabia after traditional means of preserving the fragile landscape
were swept aside as petrodollars transformed Saudi life virtually
overnight.
   The Saudis created the National Commission for Wildlife
Conservation five years ago as improved transportation and
irrigation systems pushed crops and livestock into areas that never
before would have supported farming or grazing.
   Wheat and sorghum fields seem to be a boon to wildlife, but
grazing isn't.
   McKinnon said the future of the peninsula's wildlife will depend
on how well the Saudis preserve vegetation from herds of goats and
sheep.
   ``There's a big move now ... to protect flyways for birds, to
fund new breeding grounds for gazelle, ibex, to set aside areas for
conservation,'' he said.
   There are other hopeful signs. He said that in some protected
areas, ``botanists are finding desert plants they didn't know
existed.''

   CO-HOSTS INTERVIEW CO-HOSTS: Charles Gibson and Joan Lunden,
co-hosts of ABC's top-rated ``Good Morning America,'' today begin
the second week of their broadcasts from the United Kingdom by
being interviewed themselves. Their questioners: Mike Morris and
Maya Even, their counterparts on the top-rated ``Good Morning
Britain.'' Although it might mark morning TV's first quadraphonic
host festival, the chat won't be shown in the United States.
   ROLLING STONES GATHER 3-D: The Fox network on May 30 will give
you two hours of the final _ honest _ final performance of the
Rolling Stones' ``Steel Wheels North American Tour,'' taped Dec. 19
in Atlantic City. N.J. Three classics by the middle-aged lords of
British rock _ ``Paint It Black,'' ``2000 Light Years'' and ``It's
Only Rock and Roll'' _ will be shown in 3-D. One can get the
necessary glasses, Fox says, at 7-Eleven stores.
