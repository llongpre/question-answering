<HEAD>Consumer Group Slams Ads Aimed at Kids</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public schools should be declared
``commercial-free zones'' to protect children from the increasing
prevalence of advertising disguised as educational materials, a
consumer group says.
   Consumers Union said July 17 that many purported teaching aids
donated by businesses contain pitches for those businesses'
products. Some of the come-ons are direct, others surreptitious, it
said.
   Schools often acquiesce to the handouts because they can't
afford to buy unbiased new materials, the report said. Students
fall victim, because they are unlikely to question advertising
disguised as schoolwork, the group said.
   ``The result: Schools are becoming heavily sponsored by
corporations marketing products,'' the report said. ``They're
`selling' the kids entrusted to them to any bidder.''
   The study also criticized other forms of advertising aimed at
children, including ads in children's magazines that are disguised
as editorial copy, the use of celebrities to promote products, ads
camouflaged as entertainment, and licensing deals that put popular
symbols on a vast array of products.
   Interest in the issue of advertising in schools was heightened
last year by the advent of Channel One, a video news program for
pupils that includes commercials. Schools receive the program and
viewing equipment free.
   Consumers Union called Channel One ``the tip of the iceberg''
and listed examples of self-promotion in corporate-supplied
teaching materials. It said such materials reach more than 20
million students a year, although it did not estimate what
proportion include advertising.

<HEAD>Spanish-Language News Teams Left Out of Quayle Coverage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spanish-language television stations excluded
from a July 19 interview in which Vice President Dan Quayle
discussed a job bias bill attacked the action as insensitive.
   ``I just don't understand the reason. If they don't want to deal
with the Hispanics, then that's pretty stupid,'' said Angelica
Figueroa, news producer at KVDA, an affiliate of the
Spanish-language network Telemundo.
   ``The irony of the thing is he was talking here about a
discrimination bill passed by the Senate,'' said KWEX News Director
Ed Barrera, whose station is an affiliate of the Spanish-language
Univision network, Telemundo's competitor.
   Ms. Figueroa said she wouldn't call the action discrimination,
but said it was ``very insensitive,'' especially in a city where
more than half the 1 million residents are Hispanic.
   A spokesman for Quayle, who in the interviews discussed his
opposition to a bias bill passed in the Senate on July 18, said no
station was intentionally left out.
   Affiliates of ABC, CBS and NBC were invited to interview Quayle
at a hotel after he spoke with newspaper and radio reporters.
   Two cameras were allowed to tape the interview and were asked to
share the videotape with others who were present, said reporters
who attended. A reporter from the Mexican network ECO also was
allowed in after protesting his exclusion, reporters said.
   Barrera said his station had asked before Quayle's visit about
covering the event and was not told of the interviews.
   A Quayle spokesman who spoke on condition he not be identified
said the interview was not open to all news organizations and a
limited number of local stations routinely are invited to interview
Quayle when he travels.

<HEAD>`Today' at Lowest Level in Seven Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's ``Today'' has slipped to its lowest
ratings since Aug. 6, 1983.
   In the most recent weekly ratings from A.C. Nielsen Co.,
``Today'' was second to ABC's ``Good Morning America'' for the 28th
consecutive week.
   ABC's show rose to a 4.3 rating, while ``Today'' dipped slightly
to 3.0 and ``CBS This Morning'' edged up to 2.3. Each point
represents 921,000 homes.
   ``Real Life With Jane Pauley,'' the first of five NBC summer
specials anchored by the former ``Today'' star, easily won its time
period against two reruns.
   Pauley's one-hour show averaged a 13.5 rating July 17, handily
beating the 10.3 rating for the second hour of a movie repeat on
CBS and the 6.9 rating for a ``thirtysomething'' rerun on ABC.

<HEAD>`Skittish' Advertisers Cost ABC $14 Million in Ad Revenue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC lost $14 million in advertising revenue
last season to advertisers that boycotted programs they deemed
offensive, network entertainment President Bob Iger said July 22.
   ``It's a sorry state of affairs when advertisers are acting as
skittish as they are,'' Iger said at a news conference. ``The
networks get the heat, but I really think it should be the
advertisers.''
   The lost revenue was slightly more than 1 percent of ABC's total
advertising revenues of $1 billion for this year, Iger said.
   Iger declined to name the advertisers who withdrew their
commercials, and said the $14 million figure represented the first
time ABC had counted such lost revenue since he became programming
chief 16 months ago.

<HEAD>Station Reinstates Talk Show Host Who Banned Black Callers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radio talk show host who was suspended
for banning black callers returned to the air July 17 after his
station manager said his action was not malicious.
   Tim Lennox, who had been suspended on July 12, returned to his
afternoon talk show but was removed from his job as news director
and will be on probation for a year, said Berkley Fraser, manager
of WERC-AM.
   Lennox also will be required to develop, produce and serve as
host of a special series for the station on the topic ``Birmingham
faces the future,'' focusing on race relations in the city.
   Lennox said early in his two-hour talk show on July 11 that he
would take no calls from blacks that day because three station
employees had seen a black youth break into an fellow employee's
car and take her purse just before air time.
   Lennox said later that he made ``an emotional spur-of-the-moment
decision.'' He and Fraser issued on-air apologies the next day.
   Fraser said his investigation showed Lennox's action was ``not
based in malice and his 14-year career was without incidence of any
racial prejudice.''
