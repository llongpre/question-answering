<LEADPARA>  Odds are that players will be the big winners in the crisis gripping the
California Lottery.;   A new lottery director, apparently former Illinois
lottery chief Sharon Sharp, will be appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson as early as
Wednesday. It will be her job to reverse a startling $300 million sales
decline over the past year.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Sharp is likely to give players what recent studies by the lottery and
independent consultants show they want: more prizes and better odds.;  
Players want better odds of winning lotto's big jackpots and would like to see
a greater number of moderate-size prizes, such as those in the $20 to $100
range, in all the games.;   Money for the changes probably would come from
making the biggest prizes a bit smaller, lottery officials and private
analysts say. The lottery-authorizing ballot initiative says the operation can
spend no more than half its total revenue on prizes.;   The experts say the
6-year-old games probably cannot be revitalized without the prize overhaul, a
move that has been resisted historically by the lottery.;   "Prizes are the
central core issue" in the surveys, Chon Gutierrez, the current director of
the state-run lottery, said in a recent interview. "The California Lottery is
at a crossroads.";   Wilson said he will replace Gutierrez, appointed in 1987
by former Gov. George Deukmejian. Wilson froze Gutierrez's plans for prize
changes in the meantime.;   Critics have blamed sales declines on poor
management, including the remaking of Lotto 6/49, with 1 in 14 million odds,
into a game with longer odds in an attempt to foster larger jackpots.;  
Lottery marketing surveys show players feel the Lotto 6/53 game is producing
few winners because the odds are so tiny: 1 in 23 million. The lotto change
"has clouded attitudes toward all lottery games," according to a summary of
the studies.;   Lottery officials, meanwhile, have attributed sales declines
largely to hard economic times.;   Sharp, the probable new lottery director,
is a 51-year-old consultant who had successes directing Illinois' games.
Sources close to the selection process said she is the choice, but Wilson
spokesmen and Sharp declined comment.;   There's a pressing need to convince
Californians that the games have contributed as promised to public education,
research shows. Funding shortages in schools have made Californians
skeptical.;   The situation "has raised questions in people's minds about
where the lottery money is going and why the lottery hasn't solved education's
problems," Gutierrez says. "The questions must be answered to create a
receptive climate for . . . sales-building strategies to be effective.";   So
experts say it's likely the new director will launch a publicity campaign to
ease the problem.;   The Lottery Commission has avoided the approach since a
similar campaign backfired. Teachers criticized TV ads as inaccurately
depicting how lottery funds were used in schools and exaggerating the effect
of lottery funds on education.  </TEXT>
