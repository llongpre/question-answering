THOSE LONGER LOTTO ODDS

Just as everyone expected, and feared, the California Lottery keeps escalating 
the hysteria level to get more and more people to play. The curious thing about 
the latest move of the California Lottery Commission, however, is that in order 
to get more people to spend more money on the lottery, the commission is making 
it harder to win. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, players in the Lotto game had to pick the correct six numbers 
from a field of 49 to win the big Saturday prize. Then the commission added a 
Wednesday drawing. Now it is increasing the field from 49 numbers to 53. It 
seems that a prize of $5 million or $10 million is just not sufficient to get 
jaded players to play enough. By increasing the odds, the commission lessens 
the chance of someone winning the Wednesday or Saturday drawing. Thus the prize 
will roll over from one lottery night to the next and build in size. This is 
necessary "to maintain the excitement of the Lotto game," a commission official 
says. Some logic. How big is big enough? Fifty million dollars? A hundred 
million? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps to soften the criticism of making the long Lotto odds even longer, and 
ostensibly to give players all sorts of options, there will be new games that 
allow people to have a greater chance of winning smaller prizes. Even so, the 
odds of winning anything at all in the lottery will increase from 1 in 54 to 1 
in 67. The odds on catching the big Lotto prize will go from 1 in 14 million to 
1 in 22 million.

The frantic lottery ads still tout the benefits to California education from 
playing the lottery. But Neal R. Peirce was correct when he wrote in the 
National Journal earlier this year that state lotteries have become "a massive, 
regressive debilitating tax -- especially on lower-income people." Peirce 
proposed a number of actions to bring lotteries under control that should be 
considered by the California Legislature. One is to ban lottery advertising. 
Another is to cap the size of jackpots. A third is to limit the proliferation 
of lottery outlets, such as the mini-lottery terminals established in some 
California supermarket checkout lines.

The lottery is a sordid adjunct to public policy. Every time the state cranks 
up the hysteria to get more people to play, it becomes just that much more 
sordid.
