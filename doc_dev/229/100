   A janitor who lost his winning ticket for a $3
million lottery says he's not mad that it took him four years to
claim the prize.
   ``The lottery was doing their job,'' said newly-made millionaire
Julius Russell Jr. The school janitor from the South Side picked up
a certificate of his winnings from lottery officials Thursday. ``Why
should I feel resentment?''
   Russell, 60, matched all six winning Lotto numbers in a November
1985 drawing, but accidently threw away his ticket.
   He proved in court last month that he consistently played the
same two sets of numbers in the weekly Lotto game, and the lottery
confirmed that one of two winning tickets for the $6 million jackpot
was purchased at the grocery where Russell routinely plays the game.
   The Illinois State Lottery had argued that lottery rules require
possession of a ticket to win, and officials appealed the court
ruling.
   But Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said Thursday the agency was
withdrawing its appeal after a check of lottery records showed
prizes have been awarded previously to claimants who could not
produce a winning ticket. None of the prizes was for more than
$5,000.
   ``We thought Mr. Russell should not have to suffer,'' she said.
   Ms. Sharp presented Russell with a mock check, and said he would
receive three installments of about $450,000 within eight weeks. The
remainder will be paid in 17 annual installments, she said.
   ``I feel great. I have five beautiful daughters and that's where
it's going,'' Russell said. ``I haven't thought about myself as of
yet.''
   Circuit Judge Robert Sklowdowski ruled Aug. 10 that the lottery
must pay Russell the prize despite his inability to produce the
winning ticket.
   ``I have decided that paying this particular claimant is the
fairest way to resolve this case,'' Ms. Sharp said. ``We think he
deserves the $3 million.''
   Ms. Sharp said lottery officials would never again pay a claim
without a ticket, and would seek legislation to toughen the ``no
ticket, no win'' rule.
   Russell said he plans to keep his job.
   The Illinois State Lottery has $14 million in unclaimed prizes,
Ms. Sharp said, and ``a lot'' of people make claims without tickets.
   Ms. Sharp said only one other state, Ohio, had awarded a grand
prize without a ticket.
