<LEADPARA>  The California Lottery will introduce a new lotto game -- with better odds and
smaller prizes -- in mid-March in response to requests by customers, officials
said Tuesday.;    The game will offer a top prize of $500,000, to be paid in
one lump sum, said lottery spokeswoman Cynthia Moore. If more than one person
wins, each will get the half-million lump sum -- unless more than 20 people
win, in which case the prizes will be smaller, she said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The new game, unofficially dubbed Little Lotto, will require players to
match six numbers randomly chosen from a field of 39 numbers, Moore said, with
odds of 1 in 3,262,623.;    That compares with a field of 53 numbers for the
current lotto game, which will continue. The current lotto game recently was
expanded to 53 numbers from 49, increasing the odds from 1 in 14 million to 1
in 23 million. Lottery officials said the higher odds increase the likelihood
of bigger jackpots, and therefore more players.;    There will be no bonus
number in the new game, but a $2,000 prize will be offered for picking five of
six numbers, with odds of 1 in 16,478. Picking four of six will be worth $50,
with odds of 1 in 412. Picking three of six will be worth $3, with 1-in-30
odds.;    The name of the new game and the exact date it will begin are being
kept secret until the lottery makes a formal announcement, Moore said.;   
Drawings will be held at 7:57 p.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays, while the Lotto
6/53 game will continue its Wednesday and Saturday drawings.;    Officials
said the game is not being introduced to bolster sagging revenues -- although
they concede revenues have been sagging.;    Ten other states have both big
and little lotto games, and "the performance range is really huge," said
Joanne McNabb, the lottery's director of public affairs. Because of that
uncertainty, the state is looking initially for a "very low-level" return from
the new game.;    McNabb said lottery revenues for this fiscal year are
expected to be $2.15 billion, including the new game. In fiscal 1990, revenues
were $2.48 billion.;    Given uncertain economic times, the games are "holding
their own," Moore said.;    But "holding their own" translates into smaller
revenues for schools. In fiscal 1990, the schools' share was $980 million. The
estimate for this fiscal year is $762 million.;    Last year, in addition to
changing the big lotto game, lottery officials introduced Decco, in which
players seek a $5,000 top prize by trying to match four playing cards drawn by
the lottery.;    Decco also was an attempt to boost sales by adding games to
appeal to more players, after customers said they wanted frequent drawings,
lots of smaller prizes instead of a big jackpot like lotto, and familiar
symbols that aren't numbers.;    After an initially strong response, Decco
sales dropped off.  </TEXT>
