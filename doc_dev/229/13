<LEADPARA>  California lottery officials are considering a proposal to reduce the schools'
percentage of lottery proceeds in order to increase the prize pool, lottery
director Chon Gutierrez said.;    Gutierrez said Thursday he would support the
plan only if research indicated it would result in a large enough increase in
ticket sales to offset the lower percentage for schools.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But school officials vowed to oppose any reduction in their share.;   
"Absolutely, we would fight it," said California Superintendent of Public
Instruction Bill Honig. "Tell them to take it out of their share instead.";   
Schools now get 34 percent of all lottery money. Fifty percent is set aside
for prizes and 16 percent goes to lottery administration.;    In response to
slumping lottery revenues, Gutierrez told the California Lottery Commission on
Wednesday that he would recommend scrapping the Lotto 6/53 game for a format
with better odds of winning.;    At a news conference Thursday, Gutierrez said
the changes in the lotto game would be recommended as part of a major overhaul
of all lottery games in an attempt to build participation.;    Los Angeles
Unified School District officials, who just cut more than $274 million from
their district's budget, said the district would be devastated by a reduction
in lottery revenues.;    "I'm in such shock I'm still trying to pick my jaw
off the floor," said Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein. "It's
absolutely appalling news. We're talking about an 'Alice in Wonderland'
approach to a measure that was passed by the voters precisely to be used for
education.";    "It's absurd," said Mark Slavkin, another Los Angeles school
board member. "If it goes into place it exposes the folly of using the lottery
to finance public education in the first place, the ridiculousness of making
school children dependent on the gambling habits of California's citizens.";  
 In addition to setting aside more money for prizes, Gutierrez said lottery
officials would propose adding games based on themes now prohibited, such as
horse racing and poker.;    Gutierrez said lottery marketing specialists are
studying the feasibility of the various proposals, and said that he will ask
the Lottery Commission, at its Sept. 17 meeting, to endorse those ideas
considered most likely to increase lottery revenues.  </TEXT>
