<HEADLINE>  PROPOSAL TO REVAMP LOTTERY GAMES TO BE HEARD TODAY
IN SACRAMENTO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Yes, my proposal will suggest that," Sharp confirmed Wednesday. The
five-member commission is expected to vote today whether to approve Sharp's
plans for new games.;   While Sharp declined to disclose specific proposals
for new games before the board has had a chance to consider them, lottery
officials said the current Lotto 6/53 and 6/39 Little Lotto, as well as Decco
and Topper, would get the boot.;   The only game that would continue is
Scratchers, the cards from which players rub a coating to see if they are
instant winners. Sharp said the Scratcher games will be expanded.;   It is a
good bet that the California Lottery will end up with games similar to those
that have been successful in Illinois and other states.;   Sharp, who has been
on the job a little more than a month, is the former director of the Illinois
lottery, where she gained a reputation for hard work, aggressive marketing and
positive results. She was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson to run the California
gaming agency, which has been in a downward spiral for two years.;   "There
are only basically so many lottery games," Sharp said. "When you select, you
select generally from games that have been successful in other states. You
select from what you already know or you've used before. You do some refining,
and you tailor-make it to your state.";   Two daily drawing games, where
players pick three or four numbers, have been successful in Illinois.;   "They
are very, very popular games . . . in many states," Sharp said. She said the
daily games also have been mentioned most often by California players as
something they want to play.;   Sharp said she is a firm believer in corporate
or sports tie-ins to instant lottery games and has used them a lot throughout
the years. She mentioned Pepsi, United Airlines and the Chicago Bulls as
examples.;   In the case of United Airlines, she said, the airline contributed
trips and shared advertising costs in games called Cash and Fly. With the
lottery contributing cash, she said, "You give your players an added value on
their tickets. . . . between the two of us, you had a really great game.";  
Sally Simonds, director of promotions and game operations for the Sacramento
Kings, confirmed she has spoken with Sharp about the possibility of a lottery
tie-in with the basketball team.;   "We'd love to do something with the
lottery," Simonds said. "We will be meeting with them (lottery officials)."  </TEXT>
