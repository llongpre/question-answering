   Gamblers and dreamers watched the bucks pile
up and the clock tick Tuesday while the jackpot for Wednesday
night's California lottery drawing crept closer to a North American
record.
   Customers lined up at liquor stores, truck stops and neighborhood
markets throughout the state and lotery officials jacked up their
estimate of the Lotto 6-49 jackpot to $53 million.
   That's still shy of the all-time California record of $61.98
million, which was set by the Lotto 6-49 game Oct. 29, 1988, with
the jackpot was split among three winning tickets.
   Pennsylvania claims the North American record payoff with a
$115.5 million jackpot in April 1989. The prize was split among 14
winning tickets.
   The Lotto 6-49 game sold exactly 1,064,388 tickets, at $1 each,
between 11 a.m. and noon Tuesday. ``And that's not even our busiest
time of the day, by any means,'' said Lottery spokeswoman Joanne
McNabb.
   By 3 p.m., sales were $7.4 million, Ms. McNabb said.
   Lotto officials and 7,900 retailers across the state braced for
the evening rush as Californians motored home from work.
   The jackpot in the twice-weekly game has gone unclaimed since
Aug. 26. Monday's sales reached $8.2 million, more than six times
the usual Monday sales _ but again short of the one-day record of
$31.5 million, set the day of the October 1988 drawing.
   Even with the odds of winning at one in 14 million, the chance
for instant megabucks attracted people who don't usually play the
game, and some out-of-staters.
   ``More people who normally don't play do play when the jackpot's
big,'' said Ms. McNabb, noting that regular players account for more
than half of ticket sales in non-rollover weeks.
   Ed Gentalen, an architect from Fullerton, Calif., filled out
tickets with two friends at Lee's Liquors in downtown Los Angeles.
   ``I hardly ever play this,'' he said as they worked on 30
tickets. ``But 50 million dollars is getting me into it.'' He
described his chances as ``about one in a zillion.''
   About 150 hopefuls jammed the Wills Fargo Country Store in Baker,
a town on Interstate 15 about 45 miles from the Nevada border.
   ``Oh yeah, everybody's going for that big dream,'' said manager
Steve Zwerner. ``It's packed. They're going down one aisle, back up
another aisle and across another,'' he said.
   Most who came to Wills Fargo, one of the biggest Lotto ticket
sellers in the state, were from Nevada, Zwerner said. On Tuesday,
they began waiting at 5 a.m., an hour before sales began.
   ``Many of them just came, bought their tickets and got back to
Vegas,'' he said.
   Lotto officials have extended sales by an hour nightly, to 11
p.m. Sales will end at 7:45 p.m. Wednesday, exactly 13 minutes
before seven numbered balls will drop into a slot, determining the
winner or winners, if any.
   The winner or winners will enjoy their earnings in 20 annual
installments.
