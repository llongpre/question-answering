<LEADPARA>  The California Lottery will introduce a new Lotto game -- with better odds and
smaller prizes -- in mid-March in response to requests by customers, officials
said today.;    The game will offer a top prize of $500,000, to be paid in one
lump sum, said lottery spokeswoman Cynthia Moore. If more than one person
wins, each will get the half-million lump sum -- unless more than 20 people
win, in which case the prizes will be smaller, she said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The new game, unofficially dubbed "Little Lotto," will require players to
match six numbers randomly chosen from a field of 39 numbers, Moore said, with
odds of 1 in 3,262,623.;    That compares to a field of 53 numbers for the
current Lotto game, which will continue. The current Lotto game recently was
expanded to 53 numbers from 49, increasing the odds from 1 in 14 million to 1
in 23 million. Lottery officials said the higher odds increase the likelihood
of bigger jackpots, and therefore more players.;    There will be no bonus
number in the new game, but a $2,000 prize will be offered for picking five of
six numbers, with odds of 1 in 16,478. Picking four of six will be worth $50,
with odds of 1 in 412. Picking three of six will be worth $3, with 1-in-30
odds.;    Drawings for the new game will be held at 7:57 p.m. on Tuesdays and
Fridays, while the Lotto 53 game will continue its Wednesday and Saturday
drawings.;    Officials said the game is not being introduced to bolster
sagging revenues -- although they concede revenues have been sagging.;    Ten
other states have both big and little lotto games, and "the performance range
is really huge," said Joanne McNabb, the lottery's director of public affairs.
Because of that uncertainty, the state is looking initially for a "very
low-level" return from the new game.;    McNabb said lottery revenues for this
fiscal year are expected to be $2.15 billion, including the new game. In the
1989-90 fiscal year, revenues were $2.48 billion.;    Given uncertain economic
times, the games are "holding their own," Moore said.;    But "holding their
own" translates into smaller revenues for schools. In the 1989-90 fiscal year,
the schools' share was $980 million. The estimate for this fiscal year is $762
million.;    Last year, in addition to changing the big Lotto game, lottery
officials introduced Decco.  </TEXT>
