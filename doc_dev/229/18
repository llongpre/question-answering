LOTTERY SALES SLUMP WILL REDUCE SHARE TO EDUCATION

The failure of a new Lotto game to produce a record-breaking jackpot combined 
with a softening economy has caused a sales slump at the California Lottery 
that officials predicted Friday could reduce the game's contribution to 
education next year by as much as $280 million. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the lower than expected sales already have forced them to cut 
$59 million from their administrative budget by severely reducing advertising, 
declaring a hiring freeze and postponing equipment purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"We are cutting as close to the bone as we can," said Joanne McNabb, the 
lottery's public affairs director. "It's what many businesses are going through 
now. Any business whose sales are down below expectations is looking to cut." 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said sales, totaling $880 million since the beginning of this fiscal 
year, are 5% below the goal for the period. Given this trend, coupled with 
expectations that the economy will continue to decline, McNabb said officials 
are estimating that total sales by the end of the fiscal year will range from 
$2 billion to $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
That would provide only $700 million to $800 million for education next year as 
compared to the $980 million the lottery provided this year, McNabb said. Under 
state law, the lottery must allocate at least 34% of its revenues to education. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Lange, public relations director for the California Department of 
Education, said the drop in lottery money would come at a time when schools are 
experiencing tremendous enrollment growth. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be really damaging to districts especially now when many of them have 
become dependent on their lottery money because of the lack of revenue from the 
state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the lottery was intended to provide "extras" for school districts, but 
many districts in recent years have used proceeds to provide "necessities" as a 
way of balancing their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said officials are attributing the slow lottery sales to the same 
nemesis that dogs many of their players -- bad luck. The Lotto game was changed 
in midsummer to produce more of the big jackpots that drive up sales. While the 
change provided some very large jackpots -- four were more than $30 million 
since July 1 -- it did not produce the super jackpots of $70 million or more 
that drive sales up significantly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We did have a turnaround in the downward trend of Lotto sales and that was a 
good sign," McNabb said. "It just went more slowly then we would like." 
</P>
<P>
In other states that have changed their Lotto games, she said the big explosion 
in sales did not come until there was a jackpot that broke the record for that 
state. In California, the biggest jackpot has been $68 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike many other businesses in this economy," McNabb said, "we have a luck 
factor. What's happened in other states is that the sooner they've hit a record 
jackpot after the change (in Lotto), the sooner their sales have taken off. 
It's our bad luck that we haven't had that." 
</P>
<P>
The change in the game required players to choose six numbers from a field of 
53 instead of 49, making it nearly twice as hard for players to win but also 
adding to the potential size of the prizes. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said officials also believe economic conditions have been a sales 
factor, but they have no way of determining how much of a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that our lottery has been in an economic downturn," she 
said. "This is new territory for us." 
</P>
<P>
Within the agency, McNabb said advertising will take a particular hit as a 
result of the sales slump. She said television advertising of Decco and Topper, 
two games of chance introduced this year, has been stopped and the advertising 
of Lotto, which produces two-thirds of the lottery's revenue, has been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
She said 50 vacant positions in the department have not been filled and will be 
recommended for elimination. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said officials believe the volume of lottery ticket sales could rise 
dramatically if there is a record-breaking jackpot or if a game to be 
introduced next spring does exceptionally well. The game, to be called Little 
Lotto, would allow players to chose six numbers from a field of 39. The top 
prize would be $500,000 paid immediately in cash. The Lotto jackpots are paid 
over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said revenue projections for Little Lotto have been conservative because 
similar games have had mixed results in other states.
