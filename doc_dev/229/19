   Lottery players streamed to ticket outlets
across California Saturday, hoping to pick the winning numbers in a
national record jackpot estimated at $51.2 million.
   By the time the drawing took place Saturday night, the odds of
winning were about one in 14 million, said state lottery officials.
As usual, lottery computers will not determine whether anyone has
won the jackpot until Sunday. A winner would not be verified until
Monday.
   Ticket sales on Saturday alone reached more than $33 million, a
one-day all time high, lottery spokesman Bob Taylor said.
   ``At 4 p.m., our ticket sales pushed the lotto prize past $46
million,'' he said, ``past the Pennsylvania record.''
   The nation's previous richest lottery prize, $46 million, was
awarded in Pennsylvania in October. The biggest previous California
jackpot, $25.4 million, was split by two players in October.
   ``There's no way we could have predicted anything like this,''
Taylor said in releasing the anticipated sum and a statement from
Lottery Director Chon Gutierrez calling sales a ``phenomenal tidal
wave.''
   Many stores brought in extra help to keep up with ticket sales.
   ``I cannot handle it. Too many people,'' said Paul Lee, owner of
the New Lun Wah grocery store in San Francisco's Chinatown, where 50
people lined up for tickets Saturday morning.
   ``It's been crazy,'' said Alex Lichine, manager of Lichine's
Liquor, Deli and Catering store in Sacramento. ``It's going to get
worse. Everybody's playing today. Everybody's playing four or five
times more than normal.''
   Ticket buyers forked over dollars at the rate of $2 million per
hour statewide, said lottery spokesman John Schade.
   A player beating the 1-in-14 million odds of winning the jackpot,
which began growing when there were no winners in several previous
drawings of the Lotto 6-49 game, would receive the money, after
federal taxes, in an annuity paid over 20 years.
   The actual size of the jackpot depended on how many tickets were
sold.
   The winning numbers, six of 49, were picked in a 7:56 p.m.
drawing in Sacramento. They were: 48, 42, 9, 14, 19, 31. The bonus
number was 37.
   ``I tell you the sky's the limit today. We had almost $5 million
(in ticket sales) at 10 o'clock today,'' said Taylor. ``Last
Saturday at this time we had $904,000. These figures are just mind
boggling.''
   As the game heated up, a Los Angeles psychologist cautioned
players not to fall victim to what he called ``lottery fantasy
syndrome.''
   ``People purchase a ticket, ignore the odds and start thinking of
the impossible: quitting their jobs, buying items that they have
always wanted, going places that they have never been, and some even
think of divorcing their spouses and starting their lives completely
over,'' said Robert Butterworth.
   The jackpot lured players across state and national borders.
   Leo Gronich, owner of Garlan's Inc., a Calexico department store
with a currency exchange, said some players were Mexicans trading
pesos for tickets. Oregon residents drove south to Yreka, Calif.,
for tickets, said clerk Dan Jerden at Sports and Spirits.
   At Tahoe Tom's in South Lake Tahoe, the fat pot drew Nevada
residents across the border, three blocks away.
   ``We were joking yesterday that it would be funny to have the
(ticket) line up to the state line and have the casino executives
wonder what's going on,'' said owner Tom Erickson.
   What to do with the enormous sum?
   ``Party forever,'' said Leslie Beagle, 43, of Riverside, as she
plunked down $10 for her shot at the jackpot.
   ``You'd probably have to take six months off to think about it,''
said Bill Masterson, 46, of South Lake Tahoe, who planned to buy
five tickets.
