<LEADPARA>  The former director of the Illinois state lottery has been chosen to take the
helm of California's troubled lottery, Gov. Pete Wilson announced Friday.;  
Wilson appointed Sharon Sharp, a 51-year-old Republican, to head the state-run
games of chance that have been plagued by declining sales and player
skepticism over the past year.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Sharon's track record at the Illinois Lottery proves she can do the job
here in California and turn the fortunes of the California Lottery around,"
Wilson said.;   Sharp, who directed the Illinois system from 1987 to 1991,
said she will arrive in California on Wednesday to begin figuring out how to
boost the game's image and income.;   "I've read and studied as much as I can
about the California Lottery, but it's simply premature to say whether I am
going to do this or this or this," Sharp said in a telephone interview from
Illinois. "I am certainly not going to come in with any rosy glow that this is
going to be easy.";   California introduced its lottery in 1985 as a way to
provide added money for schools, which receive about 35 percent of all lottery
revenues.;   Ticket sales rose to a high of $2.6 billion in 1988-'89, bringing
schools an average of $178 per pupil. But sales then tumbled to $2.15 billion
in 1990-'91, and the schools' take slipped to $124 per student.;   This year,
the decline has continued. Total lottery sales from July 1 to Sept. 7 were
only $265 million -- less than three-fourths of what had been expected.;  
Legislators, lottery staff members and lottery commissioners have scrambled
for ways to reverse the decline. Some blame the current economic recession or
the gradual loss of the lottery's novelty.;   Others blame changes in the
state's lotto game that made prizes larger while making the already-slim odds
of winning the top jackpot even slimmer -- from one in 14 million to one in 23
million.;   "There is a general perception that nobody wins the lottery and
that the only prizes are $2 prizes," said Chon Gutierrez, whom Sharp will
replace as lottery director. "(Sharp) is going to have to face these
challenges, and face them in an environment where she doesn't have a lot of
control -- a very soft economy.";   Sharp faced similar challenges when she
was chosen to head the Illinois Lottery in 1987. She made numerous changes,
which included altering Illinois' lotto game to give it higher prizes and
slimmer odds -- the same combination that has come under fire in California.; 
 Illinois' lottery sales rose under Sharp's tenure, with a 48.6 percent lotto
increase in 1989 and record sums going to schools in 1990.;   Sharp -- who
started a lottery consulting firm when she left the Illinois post earlier this
year -- will earn $95,052 a year. Her appointment requires state Senate
confirmation.  </TEXT>
