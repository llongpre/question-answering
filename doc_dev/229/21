<LEADPARA>  Frank Briltz can't believe his luck at the Lariat Bowl in Red Bluff.;    Three

alley.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Then, Wednesday night, Briltz learned he and 30 bowling friends held a
winning ticket in California's bank-busting lottery drawing and will split a
national-record jackpot of $118.8 million.;    Lottery officials today said
that 10 tickets were sold with the winning numbers of 1, 7, 16, 19, 26, 53.
The bonus number was 52.;    Each ticket would be worth $11.9 million and
would be paid out in approximately $470,000 installments a year after taxes.
Winners are paid in equal annual checks for 20 years.;    That's a lot more
than what the 31 customers and employees of the Lariat Bowl will get -- nearly
$15,500 a year after taxes -- but they aren't complaining.;    Other winning
tickets were purchased in Santa Cruz, Hawthorne, Stockton, Lancaster, Culver
City, Anaheim, Los Angeles, Fontana and Victorville, officials said.;   
Wednesday's jackpot topped the previous record of a $115.58 million prize set
in Pennsylvania in 1989. But it was not a world record. Spain has an annual
lottery that reached $1 billion, said lottery spokeswoman Joanne McNabb.;   
Wednesday's ticket sales also set a record -- $54 million in one day, she
said.;    Briltz, the oldest member of the pool, said he broke out in a cold
sweat and goose bumps when the happy news was announced at the bowling alley
Wednesday night. Red Bluff is 130 miles north of Sacramento.;    "I feel
great, but I'm scared," he said. "I know so many poor people and I've been a
poor man. I'm afraid that people will be bouncing on me for money.";    This
morning he said he's not making any plans for the money but admitted he'd like
to use some of his winnings for a honeymoon.;    The retired heavy-equipment
operator said he'd also like to pay off his house, but beyond that he's
waiting till he actually has the money in his hands.;    "I'll be satisfied
with whatever I get," he said.;    Bob and Patty Funk also were in the bowling
alley lotto pool and put in $10 to help purchase 310 tickets. Patty Funk works
as a cook at the bowling alley.;    "Hey, I'm retired and this is going to
come in at the right time," said Bob Funk, 63. "We're going to enjoy it; this
only happens once in a lifetime.";    A man claimed to hold the Hawthorne
ticket but declined to reveal his name.;    "I guess he's a private person,"
said Frank Kumamoto, owner of the Blue Bird Liquor Store in Hawthorne where
the unidentified man bought his ticket.;    The store has been the site of
three other big lottery wins, he said. A $4.5 million prize went unclaimed;
one customer won a $1.27 million prize; and another ticket paid $110,000.;   
With news of the store's luck spreading quickly, the place was a mob scene
today with customers lining up to buy tickets for the next jackpot, Kumamoto
said. "It's like a party.";    Kumamoto said he sold 27,000 lottery tickets
Wednesday alone compared to 20,000 that are sold in an average week.;   
Lottery officials said 24 tickets in Wednesday night's drawing had five of six
numbers plus the bonus number; each ticket was worth $254,882. Bay Area
winners were sold in Sunnyvale, Oakland and Cupertino.;    A total of 1,361
tickets had five of six numbers, claiming $4,494 apiece, while 84,034 tickets
had four of six numbers and were worth $66. A total of 1,674,838 tickets had
three of six number and won $5 each.;    The Topper cities were Palo Alto,
Vallejo and Ventura.;    Officials said the jackpot for Saturday's draw would
be $5 million. Total sales for the draw were $111,221,666.;    Since the
lottery game began rolling over the prize amount on March 17, the game has
collected $246.6 million, or nearly a quarter billion dollars, McNabb said.;  
 "There are a lot of (player) pools of 100 or more. A couple of guys bought
1,000 (tickets) at a time. They're really going hog-wild. It's never been this
busy before," said Sam Sahouria, owner of Fox Plaza Grocery in San Francisco.;
   Lottomania touched Gov. Pete Wilson, who walked from the Capitol to a
restaurant to buy his first-ever lotto ticket. Wilson bought a
computer-selected "quick pick" with the numbers 7, 20, 37, 38, 51 and 53. He
said if he won, he would donate the money to the state.;    At least one
public official remained immune from dreams of never having to work again,
however. Asked if he would resign if he won the prize, Los Angeles Police
Chief Daryl F. Gates chuckled, then replied, "I don't play the lottery." His
wife did, he said.;    A thousand people, mostly from Nevada, waited for hours
to buy up to $6,800 each in tickets for the Lotto 6/53 game at Wills Fargo
Country Store in the Mojave Desert town of Baker, 90 miles from Nevada.
"They're looking for their dream," said general manager Steve Zwerner.;   
Lottery director Chon Gutierrez said identifying and verifying the winners
could take many additional hours, or even days, he said.;    The biggest lotto
winner in U.S. history is a Florida player who landed a windfall of more than
$55 million in September 1988.;    California's largest previous jackpot,
$68.5 million, was divided among four winning tickets in February 1990. The
single largest winner, Tom Tehee of Upland, won $45.3 million in December 1990.  </TEXT>
