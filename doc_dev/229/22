   Lottery officials upped the state Lotto jackpot
to $62 million today _ a national record _ as gamblers and dreamers
from as far away as Europe clamored to play.
   The geographical range is ``something we've never seen before,''
Illinois Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said Thursday.
   Travelers passing through O'Hare International Airport jammed
Lotto booths, where sales for Saturday's drawing have been just
about double the average, said Bob Flynn of the Paralyzed Veterans
of America, which runs the six Lotto kiosks.
   ``Who knows when the wheel of fortune spins or not?'' said
ticket-buyer Arthur Beane, a salesman from South Carolina.
   ``I want to win,'' said Florida developer Jack Ross.
   Ticket sales were also particularly brisk at lottery outlets
near Illinois' borders with Indiana, Wisconsin and Missouri, as
residents from those states flocked to get in on the action.
   ``They're ordering them by the hundreds. One runner from Indiana
just bought $3,200 worth,'' sat Pat Poulos of the Deluxe Restaurant
in Danville.
   The Illinois jackpot had risen to $58 million by Friday morning.
And shortly after noon, lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem announced it
had swollen to $62 million _ topping the old record of $61.98
million set last October in California.
   Three winning tickets were bought in the California lottery, and
two of the three tickets had been purchased by groups of
co-workers, so the winnings were actually split more than 40 ways.
The largest lottery prize that went to a single ticket buyer was
claimed last September, when a Florida woman won $55 million.
   Ticket sales have increased the Illinois jackpot _ already
swollen by rollovers from three straight winless drawings _ by $5
million each day since Sunday.
   More than 23 million tickets had been sold by late Thursday.
   Ms. Rem said officials have received inquiries about the drawing
from California, Tennessee, Texas and other states.
   ``We've also gotten calls from Europe _ England, the Netherlands
_ with people asking how they can play,'' she said.
   Ticket sales have broken records every day this week. A total of
7.5 million tickets were sold Wednesday, a 20 percent increase over
the previous mark for a Wednesday set in 1986, Ms. Rem said.
   Each $1 ticket has two plays. In each bet, the bettor _ or the
computer _ picks six numbers between 1 and 54. The odds of winning
the Lotto on a two-play ticket are 12.9 million to one.
