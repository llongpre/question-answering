   There's a new multimillionaire
somewhere out there, as only one Lotto ticket held the six numbers
needed to win America's richest-ever lottery jackpot of at least
$54 million, officials said Sunday.
   The winning $1 ticket for Saturday night's drawing was purchased
in Longwood, a town of 14,500 in central Florida, Lottery Secretary
Rebecca Paul said. She declined to name the store until the winner
steps forward.
   Eight-digit riches were also doled out in New York, where one
winning ticket was purchased for a $23 million jackpot Saturday
night, and in Illinois, where holders of four winning tickets will
split a $21 million prize.
   The previous national record jackpot, $51.4 million, was shared
by two California lottery players in June. A Pennsylvania couple
had the largest single-ticket lottery prize until now when they won
$46 million in 1987.
   The new Florida millionaire _ or millionaires, if several
persons shared the ticket _ get 180 days to claim the prize. The
earliest it can be claimed is Tuesday, after the Labor Day holiday.
   The prize will be doled out over 20 years. The state lottery
withholds 20 percent of large payouts for federal income taxes,
although actual federal taxes owed could be higher. Florida has no
state income tax.
   Splitting a $54 million payout into 20 installments, and
deducting 20 percent, would bring the annual check to $2.16 million.
   Officials had estimated Saturday's jackpot at $52 million, but a
last-minute frenzy of sales that sometimes topped 850 tickets a
second raised the total to $54 million. It could be even larger,
depending on final sales figures.
   Saturday sales totaled 14.6 million tickets, and total weekly
purchases were 44.78 million by the 11 p.m. drawing.
   Players had turned to psychics, gimmicks and other formulas to
beat the 14 million-to-1 odds of picking the six winning digits out
of 49. The winning numbers were 3-5-19-20-27-35.
   Until Saturday, there hadn't been a winner in the drawing since
Aug. 6. That boosted the jackpot with each passing week.
   ``This became an international news story. What better way to
let people know about your lottery than through an international
news story?'' Mrs. Paul said at a news conference. Florida began
its lottery only this year.
   At least $20 million of the week's lottery profits will go to
state education, she said.
   Longwood Mayor David R. Gunter said he was delighted to have the
$54 million ticket sold in his town. The bedroom community 18 miles
northeast of Orlando has several lottery outlets.
   ``I think we're due to be on the map,'' said Gunter. ``This is
one great way to put us on it. It's always good to have a small
city wake up and learn that one individual has had such fantastic
luck.''
   Besides the jackpot, more than 1 million other Lotto players won
smaller prizes.
   Ticket vendors across the state reported brisk Saturday sales.
   ``Frantic isn't the word,'' said James Salvatore, owner of Lotto
News in Miami. ``It's madness.''
   Meanwhile, lotteries in other states credited Florida's Lotto
with boosting their sales.
   ``That kind of publicity raises the awareness of lottery of
everyone in the nation, and we all see an increase in sales,'' said
Kathy Rem, a spokeswoman for the Illinois lottery.
   As in Florida, the winners of the $21 million Illinois drawing
and the $23 million New York lottery were not immediately
identified.
   The winning ticket in New York was sold in prosperous
Westchester County, north of New York City, while the four winning
tickets in Illinois were sold in the suburbs of Chicago.
   Florida Lottery spokesman Ed George spoke via telephone on an
Arizona radio talk show and said he was deluged with questions from
people who wanted to play Florida's game.
   ``I told them to climb into a good solid car or buy a plane
ticket and come on out and visit,'' George said.
