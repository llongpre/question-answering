<LEADPARA>  Little Lotto -- the latest effort to boost lottery sales -- was unveiled
Thursday by state officials who trumpeted it as the right gamble for people
who want shorter odds and an immediate jackpot payment of $500,000.;    "We
have been hearing for a long time that we needed a game with a big top prize
-- something between Big Lotto and the top scratcher prizes," said spokeswoman
Joanne McNabb.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The game has odds of winning the top prize at 1 in 3.2 million, compared
with 1 in 23 million of winning the 6/53 jackpot. Big Lotto jackpots range
from $4 million to $69 million while scratcher top prizes run in the tens of
thousands.;    Beginning Sunday, lottery players will be able to buy $1
tickets for Little Lotto. The winning Little Lotto numbers will be drawn every
Tuesday and Friday.;    Little Lotto has only 39 numbers to choose from and
the $500,000 top prize is paid in one lump sum, rather than in installments
over 20 years. If there are more than 20 top prize-winning tickets, however,
they would split $10 million.;    Little Lotto is a fixed game like
Scratchers, Decco and Topper, rather than a game such as Lotto 6/53 where the
size of the big jackpot depends on how many tickets are purchased.;    Besides
the top prize, a player who matches five of six numbers wins $2,000; four of
six numbers $50; and three of six numbers $3.;    Lottery officials increased
the numbers from which lotto players can choose -- from 49 to 53 last summer.
Complaints about the high odds in the 6/53 game, prompted the lottery staff to
accelerate plans to develop Little Lotto.;    Big Lotto game sales dropped 5
percent or just under $100 million from $1.86 billion during fiscal year
1988-'89 to $1.77 billion for fiscal year 1989-'90. This fiscal year the
projection is that sales will come in at about $1.5 billion.  </TEXT>
