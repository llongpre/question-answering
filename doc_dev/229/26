<LEADPARA>  More lotto terminals, more scratcher contests with bigger cash payouts, and
severe staff cuts -- those are the elements of the new lottery director's
strategy to breathe life into California's stagnant games.;   Lottery Director
Sharon Sharp, addressing her first meeting Thursday of the state Lottery
Commission, said the state lottery has "not been player-friendly and (we must)
make winning easy for the customers. . . . The more you pay the players, the
more the players buy and the more the state makes."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The five-member panel approved her strategic plan, which focuses on a
cranked-up marketing scheme, boosting the number of scratch-off games
available, and requiring the games to pay prizes instantly at the point of
purchase.;   The panel must now decide the specifics of her proposal -- the
kinds of games, the promotional campaigns and the prizes.;   The maximum
instant payment currently is $25; Sharp's plan would raise the instant payout
to nearly $600. Currently, there are few scratcher contests; Sharp said
marketing studies in other states show that players will participate in an
"almost unlimited" variety of scratch-off games.;   Players "have made these
scratchers one of the big growth products in lotteries in the past five
years," she added. In other states, a player who wins a scratch-off is paid
instantly, but "in California you scratch, and you mail in your claim.";  
Sharp, 51, newly appointed by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, also called for
5,000 new lotto terminals statewide. "There are literally entire areas in the
state where if you wanted to buy a Lotto 6/53 ticket, you couldn't find it,"
Sharp said. California has about one terminal for every 3,100 residents, she
added, while other states have one machine for about 1,500 or 2,000
residents.;   The lottery, crippled by a stubborn recession and dwindling
public interest, has suffered a $300 million revenue decline over the past
year. At the end of June, revenues totaled an estimated $2.1 billion, down 14
percent from the $2.5 billion of the 1989-'90 fiscal year.;   And since June,
lottery revenues have been running less than three-fourths of projections.;  
Under the terms of the 1984 voter-approved lottery initiative, half the
revenues from ticket sales are awarded in prizes, 34 percent goes to schools
and up to 16 percent goes to administrative services, including salaries,
ticket printing and advertising.;   Sharp said the lottery administration
should be "running sleeker and more efficiently, and we are all going to hurt.
We will indeed have to cut the payroll in some ways. People are going to work
an awful lot harder.";   Earlier this year, before Sharp took over, lottery
authorities announced plans to reduce the staff by more than 170 positions.  </TEXT>
