<LEADPARA>  Lotto sales have tumbled. California has lost its first-place standing among
state lotteries. And the latest poll shows that nearly half of all
Californians do not look favorably upon the lottery.;   All in all, it's not a
great time to be running the state's biggest gambling show.  </LEADPARA>

SHARP SEEKING NEW GAMES, QUICK PAYOFFS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But don't tell that to Sharon Sharp, the new chief of the California
Lottery. After two weeks on the job, she has come up with a new plan to offer
more games, prizes and lotto terminals throughout the state.;   The energetic
and upbeat former director of the Illinois state lottery won approval from the
lottery commission on Thursday for a package that includes increasing the
amount of winnings scratcher players can collect on the spot.;   Her fans
predict that she will be able get California's limping lottery back on its
feet.;   Praised for her skill; "Sharon Sharp is known as one of the
outstanding lottery marketing people in the United States," said Bill Bergman,
executive director of the North American Association of State and Provincial
Lotteries based in Washington, D.C. "With her in charge, I have no doubt the
California Lottery will return to No. 1.";   Sharp, who was appointed by Gov.
Pete Wilson to replace former lottery director Chon Gutierrez, is equally
confident. "We will be moving very quickly to bring about changes. The
California Lottery's financial situation is serious and can't wait," she
said.;   Not an easy job; It won't be an easy recovery.;   Ticket sales have
slipped from a high of $2.6 billion in 1988-'89 to last year's $2.15 billion.
A recent poll shows that only 49 percent of Californians have a favorable view
of the lottery. That is down from 1985, just after the lottery began, when 75
percent looked fondly upon the games. And last year, Florida jumped ahead of
California as the top-selling lottery in America.;   But Sharp remains
undaunted.;   "If Sharon thought it would help lottery sales, she would
probably have dressed up as a lottery ball and marched down Chicago's Michigan
Avenue," said Lynn Sweet, a political writer for the Chicago Sun-Times. "She
was just a super saleswoman for the Illinois lottery.";   In her first
commission meeting Thursday, Sharp gave a glimpse of her aggressive marketing
tactics with a new plan to offer more games, prizes and lotto terminals
throughout the state.;   Her proposal, approved by the five-member commission,
calls for reducing the state's lottery staff and increasing the amount of
winnings scratcher players can collect on the spot. Right now, winners of $25
or more must mail in a claim. Sharp wants to provide immediate payments of up
to $599.;   The director said she will be proposing a full package of game
changes, including revising the ailing 6/53 Lotto, within several weeks.;  
Sharp said the nation's lagging economy may be partly to blame for
California's lottery woes. But she also said new games and promotions are what
is needed to draw people back.  </TEXT>
