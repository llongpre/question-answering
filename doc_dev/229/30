IT CELEBRATES ITS FIFTH BIRTHDAY AS THE LARGEST IN NORTH AMERICA. BUT OFFICIALS

<P>
By all rights, it should be a phenomenal success story -- a business that has 
grown from nothing to $10.6 billion in sales in five years, created 3,000 jobs 
and given schools $4 billion to boot. 
</P>
<P>
But as the California Lottery modestly celebrates its fifth birthday this week, 
it is getting as much criticism as it is accolades. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues on its major games -- Lotto, Decco and Scratchers -- are flat. Many of 
its hard-core players are angry about a change in the Lotto game that 
dramatically heightened the odds of losing. A public-interest group is starting 
a campaign against its advertising, labeling it "misleading and deceptive." 
</P>
<P>
Most troublesome of all, today, the day the lottery commemorates its first 
ticket sales in 1985, a state Senate committee is convening to question lottery 
officials about some of their business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials, who see the creation of a multibillion-dollar business in 
five years as nothing short of "incredible," seem mystified by the sudden 
onslaught of criticism. They concede that they may have miscalculated some 
players' reaction to the change in the Lotto odds, but they say the lottery -- 
like everything else -- has been the victim of economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Is Disneyland mismanaged because the oil crisis is resulting in their tourism 
being down?" asked Chon Gutierrez, the ebullient director of California's 
lottery. "Is government mismanaged because there is a recession and revenues 
are down and the budget is tight?" 
</P>
<P>
Even in good economic times, he said, the lottery is a roller coaster business. 
Revenues soar when jackpots, new games and new twists in old games spark 
players' interest and slide when the novelty wears off. Whenever there is a dip 
in enthusiasm, he said, lottery management adjusts the games to reignite player 
interest, but often it takes time to reach a new high. 
</P>
<P>
Players are seeing a typical slide, he said, that is exacerbated by economic 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
I. Nelson Rose, a Whittier College law professor and expert on gambling law, 
agreed. He said it is common for lotteries to come under intense criticism 
after about five years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, this is a consumer item and it is a very poor consumer item," he 
said. "The chances of winning a significant prize are so small that people are 
literally being frustrated every day of their lives. What they're doing is 
airing that frustration. The state lottery isn't doing anything it shouldn't be 
doing. The problem is people are spending a lot of money on the lottery and 
losing." 
</P>
<P>
Even the criticism cannot overshadow the fact that the lottery celebrates its 
fifth birthday firmly entrenched in the California lifestyle. From an operation 
that began with four secretaries and three executives in March, 1985, it has 
become the biggest lottery in North America and the fifth largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, 90% of California adults have played the lottery at least once, 
according to state lottery figures. On its busiest days, it logs more 
transactions than the New York Stock Exchange. In five years it has made 577 
people millionaires and distributed about $5.2 billion in prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Who plays the lottery is a question that has been debated over its five-year 
lifetime. Critics claim it preys on the poor by capitalizing on dreams of a 
better life. Lottery officials say they try to attract urban professionals and 
the well-to-do. Independent polls by the Los Angeles Times in 1986 and 1987 
showed the lottery was most popular with individuals who earn from $10,000 to 
$40,000 annually, with blue-collar workers and with men. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiasm for the lottery in California began before the first ticket was 
sold. On Nov. 6, 1984, voters overwhelmingly approved an initiative 
establishing California as a lottery state despite a vigorous opposing campaign 
from church groups and parimutuel gambling interests. 
</P>
<P>
Leo McElroy, the political consultant who ran the campaign to try to defeat the 
lottery, said once the issue was settled at the polls, active opposition seemed 
to cease. "The people who didn't like it didn't have to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Its early success helped lottery fever spread to other states. In 1984, 
California was the 21st state to approve a lottery. Today, 30 states and the 
District of Columbia have lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its popularity and general public acceptance, there are some public 
officials who acknowledge an uneasiness. Although at least 34% of lottery 
revenues must be dedicated to public education, there is a widespread feeling 
even among the original promoters of the lottery that it has not been that good 
for education. 
</P>
<P>
So much emphasis in the original promotion of the lottery was given to the 
benefits for education, they said, that in many voters' minds it became a 
solution to education's money problems. 
</P>
<P>
"People thought all of a sudden it would be this cornucopia of endless funds 
for education. It was an unrealistic expectation," said Rose. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years, bond issues and other efforts to raise money for education 
were defeated in part because voters believed the lottery had already taken 
care of education, critics and supporters agree. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Fadem, a San Francisco lawyer who sponsored and helped author the 
initiative for Scientific Games in 1984, said the lottery's promoters put so 
much emphasis on the billions of dollars that the games of chance would raise 
for education that voters never understood those billions only represented 3% 
of education's total budget. 
</P>
<P>
"My only regret is that a lot of California voters carried the impression that 
the lottery would solve all of California's education funding woes," said 
Fadem. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said he originally opposed the lottery 
initiative, believing that it would never be the "icing on the cake" for 
education that its promoters promised. He said he suspected -- and experience 
in the initial years has proved him right -- that the money given to education 
by the lottery would encourage the governor and Legislature to provide less 
from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
Honig, who has no criticism of the way the lottery is being run, talks, as do 
many public officials, of being troubled by the fact that a state-run gambling 
operation is used to finance the education of California's young people. 
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly appreciative of the money but I'm just uncomfortable 
encouraging people to gamble," he said. "There's a philosophical problem. Here 
we're trying to tell kids work hard, study hard, make the long, slow effort to 
learn and it will pay off. And then we have advertising on television that says 
play the lottery and lightning will strike." 
</P>
<P>
Controller Gray Davis, whose office regularly audits the lottery, said, "If I 
had to grade the lottery I'd give it a B. It has fulfilled its mission to 
provide an additional 3% funding to schools. . . . On the other hand, I feel 
badly that revenue for important public services such as education have to be 
generated by gambling." 
</P>
<P>
In the same vein, Carl Oshiro, supervising attorney for the University of San 
Diego's Center for Public Interest Law, has filed a complaint with lottery 
officials contending that its television advertising is misleading because it 
fails to disclose the odds of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we have the state of California teaching folks through its advertising 
that gambling ought to be part of their daily life, part of their daily routine 
and spending massive amounts of money to do it," Oshiro said. "It didn't seem 
to us that there was any money spent on putting out any other message either in 
terms of what the product really is or perhaps warning people of the 
consequences of excessive gambling." 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said it would be difficult to disclose the odds in a 30-second 
television spot. He said the agency is considering some type of advertising 
campaign to warn against excessive gambling. He said that under his direction 
the lottery has been careful never to use children in advertising or promote 
its link to education as reason people should gamble. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery has been one of the top advertisers in the state -- last year it 
spent $63.9 million on advertising and promotion -- since it opened its doors 
in 1985 with a game called Scratchers, which allowed the player to scratch off 
the surface of each $1 ticket to determine if it was a winner. A year later, it 
was advertising another game, Lotto, which was to become its most popular 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, players selected six numbers from a field of 49 and the winning 
combinations were picked during televised Saturday night drawings. Now, players 
pick from a field of 53 and drawings are held Wednesdays and Saturdays. The 
lottery has recently added Decco, a game using card symbols, and Topper, an 
add-on to the Lotto game that utilizes the names of California cities. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Topper, the results for all games in recent months have been 
disappointing. Decco has not produced the revenue that Lottery officials 
anticipated. Scratchers has been in a steady decline and Lotto revenues have 
not surged to their heights of a year ago. At the end of the 1989-90 fiscal 
year, the lottery reported that its total sales revenues would be $100 million 
less than the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
In a move designed to produce more super-jackpots, officials in June expanded 
the field of numbers from which Lotto players can pick. Instead of choosing 
from 49 numbers, players are allowed to choose from 53. The idea was that by 
increasing the odds from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 23 million, fewer jackpots 
would be won and there would be more roll-overs. An accumulation of roll-overs 
produces the super-jackpots. 
</P>
<P>
Since the change, however, there has been no string of super-jackpots and 
revenue has not increased appreciably. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Love, editor of The Lotto Edge, a Los Angeles-based newsletter that 
caters to regular players, said the change in odds caused the backbone of the 
lottery's business -- the hard-core player -- to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened is exactly what the regular players told them would happen a 
year ago. The consensus among us was we would either stop playing or play less 
(if the odds were changed)," he said. "Many of my readers did exactly that. 
People who were playing $40 and $50 a game or even $100 a game now play $5 or 
$10." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena), chairman of the Senate Governmental 
Organization Committee that oversees the lottery, has asked lottery officials 
to be prepared to defend the change and explain at his hearing today how they 
expected to increase sales by reducing a player's chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said the increase in sales would have come naturally if the change to 
53 numbers had produced a number of super-jackpots. But the lottery has been 
faced with the same thing that many gamblers face -- bad luck. Since the 
change, there has been one $44-million jackpot, and that unfortunately occurred 
at the same time Florida had a $106-million jackpot. The California jackpot, 
which in other times would have attracted major publicity, looked like small 
potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, Gutierrez said he could never have foreseen the crisis in the 
Middle East, which sent gasoline prices soaring, pushing the economy into a 
slump and leaving consumers with less expendable cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we anticipated perhaps the things that are driving the economy to be a 
little bit soft like the gulf crisis, had all of this been in our crystal ball, 
then obviously we would have made the (change) a year ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said it is still early to determine whether the Lotto change is a 
success or failure. He said the lottery is taking the criticism from the 
players seriously and is planning a new game in a few weeks -- possibly a Lotto 
game with a number field of 39 -- which will offer top prizes of about $1 
million and better odds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, experts disagree on the long-term significance of the criticism. 
Fadem believes it will quickly fade; Rose agrees but suggests that overall 
doubts about the lottery may linger. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't view this as a long-term problem," said Fadem. "It (player interest) 
moves in cycles. Looking back over the last five years, I think they've done a 
helluva job and I think in general Californians are satisfied with the games 
that are available." 
</P>
<P>
Rose observed that lotteries, like their games, go through cycles. In 
post-Colonial days of the 1820s and 1830s, it was "easier to buy a lottery 
ticket than it is today." By the Civil War, they had nearly disappeared. After 
the war, the economic devastation in the South sparked a revival. Then, by the 
turn of the century, there were no legal lotteries in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We go through these great swings from permissiveness to prohibition," Rose 
said. "We're definitely on the upswing of a permissive era now, but the 
question is, 'Will it last?' I am sure after the Civil War it was inconceivable 
that they would ever be outlawed, but (several decades later) they were."
