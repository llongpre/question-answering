Californians dreaming of a possible record jackpot of $62 million or more 
grabbed lotto tickets at the stunning rate Tuesday of up to 525 each second -- 
15 times normal, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Accountant Paul Littleton, 43, of San Francisco, was among those gambling only 
because of the size of the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I do when I read about the big money is get a ticket. It's 
just like I feel I can't miss my chance," said Littleton, who bought 10 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Store clerks were startled at the pace of $1 ticket sales, which California 
Lottery officials said already has set records. 
</P>
<P>
Current estimates are that the Lotto 6/49 winner who picks the six numbers out 
of 49 that match those drawn on television at 7:58 tonight will receive nearly 
$2.5 million a year, after taxes. If there are multiple winners, the jackpot 
will be divided among them. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery director Chon Gutierrez said the prize may exceed California's record 
jackpot of $61.98 million on Oct. 29, 1988, but the official estimate remained 
$60 million on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The jackpot ranks fourth in the nation, trailing a record $115-million lottery 
prize in Pennsylvania last year.
