<LEADPARA>  California's lottery director said Monday she wants to cut contributions to
schools so she can bolster game prizes in a quest to boost ticket sales and
then increase the flow of funds to education.;   "There's no way the lottery
can survive without bringing sales up," director Sharon Sharp told lawmakers.
"It is that bad."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Sharp, addressing state lawmakers at an informational hearing, said her
plan is based on the proven formula of investing money to make money.
"California players are tired of not winning," she said.;   More than $1 per
student;   Sharp told members of the Assembly Governmental Organization
Committee she is proposing that about $7 million in lottery interest earnings,
which would go to schools this year, be used instead to increase scratch-off
ticket prizes by next spring. That step would cut school funds by more than $1
per student.;   The director said she hopes eventually to use an additional
$25 million in unclaimed prize money that would go to schools for scratch-off
ticket prizes, as well.;   Sharp said that in better financial years, she
would use administrative funds to bolster prizes, but falling sales have
forced cuts in staff and operating funds.;   The recently appointed director
said that as prizes increase, Californians will gamble more, boosting lottery
sales and maintaining public education's constitutionally guaranteed 34
percent share of total revenue.;   The gains for schools will more than offset
the $1 per student decrease, she said.;   Something needs to be done to
reverse the trend, said Jim Baughman, superintendent of San Jose Unified
School District.;   Desperate for funds;   "Right now the lottery revenue has
dipped so badly," Baughman said, "that if she could come up with a strategy to
turn the revenue around, I would be all for it.";   Representatives of other
education groups said they do not oppose the change as long as schools,
overall, get their 34 percent of lottery sales.;   Sharp said that she drew
considerable opposition when she mentioned interest in lowering the percentage
of the total contribution to schools earlier, and now has no intention of
pursuing such a change.;   "I stepped into it. I've pulled back. I will never,
ever mention again getting into the 34 percent," she said.;   "The California
Lottery, if it were a corporation, would be in Chapter 11 (bankruptcy) right
now," she said.;   The 6-year-old lottery's sales may hit $1.5 billion or less
in 1991-'92 if the current pace continues, down from a high of $2.6 billion in
1988-'89, state officials said. It would be the worst year since its first
full year of operation in 1986-'87, when the lottery logged $1.39 billion in
sales.;   Education's share, guaranteed at 34 percent of total lottery sales
by the 1984 lottery-authorizing ballot initiative, would drop to about $570
million from last year's $804 million.;   At its peak in the 1988-'89 school
year, the lottery provided $176 per student.  </TEXT>
