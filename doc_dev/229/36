   Lottery players began queuing up today to buy
tickets for next week's state lottery jackpot, which is projected
to top $62 million and will be the second-largest in U.S. history.
   ``We'll just be jammed. We were jammed this morning as soon as
we opened'' at 6:30 a.m., said June Gerken, who sells tickets for
the Super 7 lottery from a balloon shop she operates in Pittsburgh
with her husband, Larry.
   Despite record sales, no ticket sold for Wednesday's drawing
contained seven winning numbers for the jackpot of at least $42
million.
   Lottery officials set next Wednesday's jackpot at $62 million
based on projected ticket sales. The jackpot will be at least that
much and could go higher, spokeswoman Terry Murphy said today.
   The nation's highest lottery jackpot of $69.9 million came just
last week in Illinois. That jackpot was split among four winning
ticket holders after Saturday's drawing. The previous record, set
last fall, was a $61.98 million jackpot split among buyers of three
tickets in the California lottery.
   The largest single winner was a Florida woman who won $55.16
million in that state's lottery in September 1988.
   In the Pennsylvania lottery's ``Super 7'' game, players pick
seven out of 80 numbers. The lottery then picks 11 numbers, and the
winner is anyone whose choices are any seven of the 11 numbers. The
odds of winning are calculated at one in 9.6 million.
   Sally Carpenter, manager of Dunkin Donuts in Woodlyn, said only
a few people have bought tickets this morning for next week's
drawing.
   ``They seem to all wait to the end, and I don't know why,'' she
said.
   ``Most people are in shock. They can't believe it didn't go last
night. They're all excited. They feel they've got another chance,''
said Dorothy DeLuca, who runs the lottery machine at DeLuca's State
News and Variety Store in Erie. ``We have people who don't know how
to play playing.''
   Lottery officials braced for a record number of ticket buyers in
the coming week and advised buyers to use the computer to pick the
numbers, to speed up the sales.
   Lottery official Michael Keyser said a record 29,258,972 tickets
were sold for Wednesday night's drawing, exceeding the previous
number of 27,662,192 on Oct. 14, 1987, when a Hollidaysburg couple
won the previous largest state jackpot of $46 million.
