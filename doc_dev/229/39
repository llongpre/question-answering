   Days after the Lotto America numbers were
drawn for a $39.8 million jackpot, three Connecticut residents knew
they had the winning ticket but thought it was so badly damaged it
might be rejected.
   Two of the three tickets purchased by Sheila E. Phillips, her
boyfriend, George H. Brown, and George Mages, were destroyed when a
can of whipped cream exploded in the cooler the ticket was sitting
in. Only the winning ticket survived.
   ``The ticket was mangled and we all said `Gee, I wonder if
they're going to take the ticket?''' said Brown, 46, of Montville,
Conn. All three are managers at the General Dynamics Electric Boat
division in Groton, Conn.
   Their numbers were drawn Saturday in the lottery, which is played
in six states and the District of Columbia. The trio turned the
ticket in Wednesday to the Rhode Island Lottery Commission to claim
the prize.
   The three were visiting friends in West Warwick, R.I., when they
bought tickets at Haxton's Package Store shortly before the numbers
were drawn Saturday night.
   Phillips found out Monday night she had the winning numbers, but
the trio waited until Wednesday to turn in the ticket so they could
bring a lawyer along.
   The prize was the largest in Lotto America history and the fourth
largest lottery jackpot won in the United States on a single ticket,
according to lottery executive director Peter J. O'Connell.
   Each of the three will receive $664,333 annually for the next 20
years. They said they will quit their jobs.
   States participating in Lotto America are Iowa, Missouri, Kansas,
Oregon, Rhode Island, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
   None of the three had immediate plans for their share of the
fortune.
   In other lotteries:
   _Nine weeks of waiting ended in Pennsylvania when lottery
officials announced Wednesday that two winning tickets had been sold
for a Super 7 jackpot worth at least $60 million.
   The prize is the second largest in the state lottery's history
and the fourth largest nationwide.
   _Two players correctly picked all six numbers in the California
Lottery's ``Lotto 6-49'' game held Wednesday night and will split an
$11.03 million jackpot, state lottery officials said.
   The two winners will take home $5,515,173 each.
   The winners in Pennsylvania and California have not been
identified.
