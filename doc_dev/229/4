<LEADPARA>  Scuttling an unsuccessful experiment to rejuvenate stagnant lottery sales with
record jackpots, the California Lottery once again is offering better odds on
smaller prizes.;   The new game, named Super Lotto, began Sunday, replacing
the spectacularly unsuccessful Lotto 6/53 game, which produced a 25 percent,
$500 million-a-year decline in sales. Because there were no grand prize
winners in the final 6/53 drawing Saturday night, that $2.9 million jackpot
rolls over into the first Super Lotto pot for Wednesday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The most important change in the new game reduces the field from which
players must match six winning numbers for a jackpot from 53 numbers to 51.;  
That may not sound like much, but it improves the odds of winning the jackpot
from one in 23 million to one in 18 million. It also slightly improves a
player's chances of winning smaller prizes for matching five, four or three of
the six numbers picked in the twice-weekly lottery drawings.;   Theoretically,
the jackpots could be just as big as they have been in the past, when the top
prize in one jackpot last April reached a record $118.8 million.;   But those
big prizes come from unclaimed top prizes rolling over for several weeks into
ever-bigger jackpots. The slightly better odds reduce that potential
enormously, increasing the chances for many more smaller jackpots.;   The
Lotto 6/53 game replaced the original 6/49 game, which had odds of one in 14
million for the top prize.;   The 6/49 game was dropped when sales leveled
off. The bigger jackpots expected from the 6/53 game were predicted to boost
sales. Instead, sales declined, with many players feeling the odds against
winning had grown too stiff.;   The new game, whose first drawing is Wednesday
evening, also eliminates the bonus number, which was good only with five of
the regular drawing numbers for a secondary jackpot of about $250,000 to
$500,000.;   The new Super Lotto game is the first major change in the lottery
proposed by its new director, Sharon Sharp, former Illinois lottery director,
who was hired in September to revitalize the California Lottery.  </TEXT>
