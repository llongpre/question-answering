   A world-record lottery jackpot drew
entrants from as far away as England as 265 tickets a second were
sold for a shot at the $52 million Florida Lotto drawing tonight.
   ``We've got so many people running in and out of here. I had
somebody call at 6 o'clock this morning wanting to know if I was
open,'' Bill McMurtray, manager of the Sing convenience store and
gas station in Bradfordville near the Georgia line, said Friday.
   Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said she met a man from London
who read about the jackpot and flew to Florida to play.
   The record prize in the 4-month-old lottery also is attracting
droves of players from neighboring states.
   Eight of the state's top 10 ticket sellers are in the Panhandle
or northeast Florida counties bordering Alabama and Georgia,
neither of which has a legalized lottery, said lottery spokesman Ed
George.
   Half the sales at the Sing convenience store, about eight miles
south of the Georgia line, are to Georgia and Alabama residents.
One man purchased more than $500 worth of tickets Friday morning
for a lottery pool.
   ``He comes down every Friday,'' McMurtray said. ``The higher the
jackpot has been, the higher the influx of people from Georgia has
been.''
   The lottery's telephone hotline has been receiving calls from
out-of-state residents wanting to buy tickets without coming to
Florida. But Postal Service regulations prohibit selling lottery
tickets through the mail.
   Many Lotto players dreamed of what it would be like to win.
   ``Parties, trips, plays, travel. I'd throw a big party first
thing,'' said Gail Thomas, a Georgia juvenile detention officer who
bought her tickets in the border town of Iamonia.
   Pasco Donald, 74, said he would remember his 12 children, 60
grandchildren and more than 50 great-grandchildren.
   ``I'd give each of them $1,000,'' he said. ``Well, maybe some of
them. Not all of them.''
   Despite the 14-million-to-1 odds of winning, the $1 Lotto
tickets were selling at a rate of about 265 per second Friday, said
George.
   Last week about 32 million tickets were sold for a $32 million
jackpot. This week, officials expected sales to hit 40 million. The
pot has been climbing because no one has won since Aug. 6.
   Officials said half of any week's sales are usually made on
Saturdays before computerized ticket machines shut down at 10:30
p.m. for the 11 p.m. drawing, which is televised.
   California set the world lottery jackpot record in June with a
$51.4 million prize that went to two people, said Terri La Fleur, a
senior editor at Gaming and Wagering Business Magazine, a monthly
trade publication in New York.
   Sam Valenza, publisher of Lottery Players magazine in
Moorestown, N.J., agreed with La Fleur.
   California's biweekly numbers game took 20 months to produce the
prize. It took Florida only four months to break the California
mark. The increase in Florida's jackpot was aided by the stiff odds
against winning _ among the highest of any state lottery.
   Players select six numbers from 1 to 49 and mark their
selections on a computer card, which is read by a ticket machine.
   Spain's ``El Gordo'' lottery gave away $56 million in 1983, but
it was not a Lotto-style game.
