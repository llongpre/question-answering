   From the sea to the Sierra, long lines
of Californians snatched lotto tickets at 10 times the normal pace
Friday as gamblers dreamed of overnight wealth in a record jackpot
that's climbed to more than $57 million.
   The top prize in the Saturday night drawing will bring the title
for North America's largest jackpot back to California, exceeding
the $55.1 million prize awarded by Florida on Sept. 3, California
Lottery officials said.
   Lotto ``6-49'' players were expected to spend roughly a dollar
for every man, woman and child in California Friday, with sales for
the day projected at nearly $30 million, said lottery spokesman Bob
Taylor. Normal sales for a Friday would be about $3 million, he
added.
   Some of the players needed the jackpot less than others.
   ``I come from a long line of people with money, but you know it
wouldn't hurt to replenish the bloodline, so to speak, with a little
new cash,'' said 53-year-old Dorothy Williams, who was standing in
line to buy five $1 tickets at a store on San Francisco's
prestigious Nob Hill.
   In contrast, Lee Tran, a 29-year-old Vietnamese immigrant
standing in a line of 10 people at a Market Street convenience store
in San Francisco, said, ``My whole family has put up money for our
chance to win the big jackpot. This is our dream. This is why we
came to America. To make it big.''
   Tran, who lives in a three-room apartment with eight other people
in the city's run-down Tenderloin District, was undaunted by the
1-in-14-million odds of picking the correct six numbers out of 49
numbers.
   In the Southern California community of Ojai, 70 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, Henry Anderson spent $100 on lottery tickets at the
Attitude Adjustment liquor store. ``I'm going for broke,'' he said.
``Maybe I am already, though.''
   The jackpot for Saturday's drawing was estimated in the
$55-million range Thursday after four previous jackpots had no
winners and were rolled over, or added, to the prize.
   With gambling heavier than conservatively estimated, the
state-run lottery on Friday revised the projected jackpot _ which
also is fed by sales _ upward to more than $57 million.
   The lottomania that has stricken Californians means almost
certainly that the figure will go higher _ perhaps $60 million _
before betting is cut off just before the televised drawing at 7:57
p.m., Taylor said.
   ``Sales are just fantastic,'' said Tom Licouris at Uncle Tom's
Liquors in the San Joaquin Valley community of Fresno. ``I've never
seen it start so early. This is the biggest I've ever seen. Since
they missed (having a winner) the other night, they've been coming
in like crazy.''
   Miles Turquist's 7-Eleven store in the Sierra Nevada community of
Truckee, 20 miles southwest of Reno, sells more lotto tickets than
any other California retailer because thousands of Nevada residents,
who account for 95 percent of his business, flock to his store each
week.
   Although Nevada has legalized gambling, the state doesn't have a
lottery.
   Turquist said that as usual he was keeping extra employees on
hand to handle the crowd. ``When lottomania hits, well, everybody
works and we've got lines out the store and down the street,'' he
said.
