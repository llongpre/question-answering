<LEADPARA>  Gov. Pete Wilson, stepping directly into the California Lottery crisis, has
headed off plans to scrap the troubled Lotto 6/53 game and says he wants to
replace Lottery Director Chon Gutierrez before any overhaul is attempted.;  
The policy-setting Lottery Commission, at Wilson's request, voted 5-0 Tuesday
to delay a proposal by Gutierrez that would have made sweeping changes in the
lottery. A primary aspect of the plan, which Gutierrez said was compiled by a
summit of "the brightest minds" in the lottery, would have dropped the Lotto
6/53 game in favor of returning to the more popular Lotto 6/49, with its
better odds.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I am in the process of selecting a new executive director, and will
announce my decision very soon," the Republican governor said in a letter to
the lottery commission, which is composed of Republican administration
appointees.;   Wilson said the new executive director "will have a mandate to
undertake a variety of initiatives that will make the California Lottery the
nation's leader once again.";   Although the commission delayed changes, it
left the way open to call a special meeting on 48 hours' notice in the next
few weeks in case a new director is appointed and wants to move forward with
any proposals.;   Gutierrez, who has held the post since 1987, said that
unless the commission acts in two to three weeks, any game changes might have
to be postponed until next year. The Thanksgiving-Christmas holiday period has
been found to be a poor time for introducing new lottery games.;   Once a
trendy pastime, the California Lottery is now the biggest loser in the lottery
industry nationally, where runaway sales growth is flattening, according to
industry analysts. Annual lottery sales have fallen from a high of $2.6
billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1989, to $2.1 billion in the
last fiscal year with projections as low as $1.7 billion for 1991.;   National
decline; Though lottery sales have been weakening across the nation,
California's decline has been much sharper. Nationally, lottery sales are
expected to grow no more than 3.5 percent for 1991, after double-digit growth
in recent years, said William Bergman, executive director of the North
American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. California, though,
saw sales fall 14 percent for its 1991 fiscal year.;   Bergman cited several
reasons for the slowdown in lottery sales nationally: weakness in the national
economy, news about the Persian Gulf war crowding out publicity that the
lottery normally would reap, and California's decision to greatly lengthen the
odds of hitting the lotto jackpot, from one chance in 13 million with Lotto
6/49 to one chance in 23 million with Lotto 6/53. A study presented to the
lottery's commission Tuesday says that the longer Lotto odds have driven
players away from all of the lottery's games.;   James Hosker, president of
the lottery association and head of Kentucky's lottery, said he believes
California sales have lagged for several reasons.;   The lottery's payout in
prizes -- 50 percent -- isn't big enough, he said. Too many prizes must be
claimed weeks after winning, instead of being instantly payable at ticket
agents, he said. And there have been too few games offered at any one time, he
said.;   Revenue to California public education, which gets at least 34
percent of the lottery's gross sales, has dropped as a result of the sales
decline.;   Although lottery funds make up just 3 percent of the budget for
schools, about two-thirds of school districts have rejected state officials'
advice and used the money for ongoing needs rather than supplementary uses.;  
Gutierrez has said he would consider shifting a higher percentage of lottery
revenues to prizes and a lower percentage to schools if it could be
demonstrated that overall revenues would increase. Educators opposed the
suggestion, however.;   Public doubt about the amount of money the
state-sponsored game of chance is pumping into schools has hurt the lottery,
the study presented Tuesday said.;   Education problem; "The constant barrage
of education-crisis stories has raised question's in people's minds about
where the lottery money is going and why the lottery hasn't solved education's
problems," the study said.;   Advertising for the lottery initiative and early
games emphasized money for schools and Gutierrez said people have become
suspicious because education problems were not solved. "The lottery was
oversold," he said.;   Gutierrez said it's not fair to blame him or his staff
or the declining fortunes of the lottery but insisted he is not troubled by
Wilson's decision to replace him or the drawn-out, public search for a new
director.  </TEXT>
