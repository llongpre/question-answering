Gamblers from San Diego to Milpitas celebrated their share in nine winning 
lotto tickets Thursday but, with so many winners, the near-record 
$56.34-million jackpot was carved into prizes of routine size. 
</P>
<P>
Each holder, or holders, of a Lotto 6/49 ticket with all six correct numbers 
out of the field of 49 won $6.2 million, said California Lottery spokesman John 
Schade. 
</P>
<P>
The prizes will be paid in annual installments of about $250,000 after taxes 
over 20 years -- a little more than would be received by a single winner of the 
game's normal jackpot of about $5 million. The estimated jackpot for Saturday 
is $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
At least one group shares one of the winning tickets, reducing their individual 
take still further. Twenty friends in a San Diego office of Pacific Bell who 
pooled their money came up with one of the winning tickets in the Wednesday 
night drawing. Splitting the prize 20 ways works out to about $12,500 each for 
20 years, after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, I made a lot of plans for the $110,000 a year I thought we'd be 
getting," said one of the San Diego winners, Rick Kruger. "Driving to work this 
morning, I heard on the radio there were nine winning tickets, so I started 
computing in my head, 'Let's see, from $110,000 to $12,000. I've got to call my 
wife and tell her not to quit her job.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another winning ticket was purchased in San Diego and two in Los Angeles, 
Schade said. The other winning tickets were bought in Milpitas, Pomona, Baker, 
Hesperia and Sherman Oaks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery was still in the process of verifying the winners Thursday 
afternoon, Schade said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Northern California men took an expensive chance at the huge lotto jackpot 
by buying more than 20,000 tickets. They failed to win the big one. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Therault and an unidentified neighbor put down $20,075 for quick-pick 
tickets -- those on which a computer picks the numbers -- at the Village Bottle 
Shop in Scotts Valley in Santa Cruz County. There were no jackpot winners in 
Scotts Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Checking Numbers 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether Therault and his neighbor had winning tickets for lesser 
amounts. He and his wife, Mary-Ann, had neighbors over Thursday night to help 
check numbers on the piles of lotto tickets. 
</P>
<P>
More than 66 million $1 tickets were purchased since last Saturday by gamblers 
hoping to beat the one-in-14-million odds of winning the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
There were 37 tickets with five of six numbers plus the bonus number. Each of 
those tickets is worth $190,611, Schade said. Fifteen of those tickets were 
purchased in Northern California and 22 in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In the no-bonus five of six category, 1,494 winners won $2,432. In the four of 
six category 74,055 players each won $44, and 1,286,909 players will collect $5 
dollars apiece for picking three correct numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The winning numbers picked in a televised drawing were 2, 32, 21, 11, 28, 19 
and the bonus number was 27.
