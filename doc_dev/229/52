Nobody picked all six winning numbers in Wednesday night's Lotto 6-49 game, and 
Saturday's jackpot will grow to an estimated $40 million, California Lottery 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Five winning numbers plus the bonus paid $569,339 each to five players, while 
five numbers without the bonus were worth $3,849 to each of 381 players. The 
$26.7-million jackpot for Wednesday's drawing will roll over to Saturday, 
growing with ticket sales to an estimated $40 million to become one of the 
largest jackpots in California Lottery history.
