One winning ticket was purchased for the $44.4-million jackpot in Wednesday's 
California Lottery Lotto 6/53 game, lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The ticket with all six winning numbers was sold in Ontario, and the holder or 
holders can claim the ninth-largest prize in the history of the Lotto game. 
</P>
<P>
But the owner of a liquor store that sold the winning ticket said his 
excitement was dampened by a rule imposed only five days ago that keeps him 
from enjoying a share of the prize. 
</P>
<P>
The state Lottery Commission changed its policy on Dec. 1 to increase general 
sales commissions from a nickel to 6 cents on each ticket while discontinuing 
the practice of rewarding sellers of winning tickets with one-half of 1% of the 
top prizes. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of getting $222,000, I got 6 cents for selling the ticket," said Ted 
Gable, owner of Corks &amp; Cans Liquor in Ontario. "Talk about mixed 
emotions." 
</P>
<P>
The winning numbers were 7, 25, 26, 27, 36 and 39 with the bonus number 4.
