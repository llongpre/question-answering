   Supporters of state lotteries see the games and their burgeoning
popularity due to multimillion-dollar jackpots as a way to increase
government revenue without raising taxes, but critics say the games
are a bad bet for many people.
   In states where lottery revenue goes toward education, the
lottery can stiffen public resistance to paying higher taxes to
support schools, critics say.
   They also say lotteries have no impact on the services they were
designed to finance because the money is used to replace, rather
than supplement, other revenue sources.
   And a long-held argument against lotteries is that they take
money from those who can least afford it.
   Despite the criticism, lottery sales are sizzling.
Multimillion-dollar payouts are so common they hardly make news
anymore.
   In October, California gave away a $61.98 million jackpot, the
world's largest lottery prize ever.
   Lottery ticket sales are expected to reach $14 billion to $15
billion this year, up from $11.4 billion last year.
   And they'll probably rise. Six new state lotteries are opening
this year, and voters in four other states gave the go-ahead on
Election Day for lotteries. Already, 28 states and Washington, D.C.,
have lotteries.
   Of the $11.4 billion, which excludes commissions to ticket
sellers, about $4.8 billion went into state coffers and $6 billion
went back to winners. The rest went for administrative costs,
according to the U.S. Commerce Department. Some state legislatures
set a percentage of lottery revenue that must go back to the state;
some permit lottery officials to decide the state's cut.
   In five states, lottery revenue is split among several
beneficiaries. In Colorado, half the revenue goes to capital
construction, 40 percent pays for conservation, and 10 percent for
parks and recreation.
   Twelve states put lottery revenue in the state's general fund. In
eight states, lottery money pays for school-related expenses.
   But critics say lottery money has no impact on budgets in most
states.
   ``In many respects it is inappropriate to say that as the lottery
goes up, education spending goes up,'' said Robert H. Koff, dean of
the School of Education at the State University of New York in
Albany.
   J. Blaine Lewis Jr., head of the North American Association of
State and Provincial Lotteries, said it would be a mistake to rely
on lottery revenue to increase expenditures, because lottery sales
fluctuate. ``What if your lottery goes down 5 percent? Then you have
5 percent less than you need,'' he said.
   In some states, educators object to getting money from a lottery
based on ``moral grounds,'' said Illinois School Boards Association
spokesman Jerry Glaub.
   But California educators have a different objection.
   ``I think California educators would be delighted to have the
lottery in place had it not undermined other efforts to increase
funding,'' said James W. Guthrie, a University of California
professor and head of Policy Analysis for California Education, a
private research organization.
   Guthrie conceded that state aid to schools has risen in recent
years. But, he added: ``It's at the local level where school
districts attempt to pass a bond that we run into the perception
that the schools aren't hurting, because of the lottery.''
   ``That is a false perception,'' agreed California lottery
spokeswoman Susan Kossack. ``The lottery provided over $800 million
(in the 1987-88 fiscal year) for education, and that's a lot of
money but it's only 2.5 percent of the public education budget.''
   In Pennsylvania, the lottery pays for programs for the elderly.
   Shirley Sharp, spokeswoman for the American Association for
Retired Persons in Pennsylvania, said it has worked so well that
other constituencies are clamoring for a share.
   Massachusetts has devised a revenue-sharing program in which each
of the state's 351 cities and towns gets a portion of lottery
revenue for discretionary purposes, with the amount based on
population.
   ``People are confident that even if they don't win, there is
still some benefit coming back to their communities,'' said David
Ellis, the state lottery spokesman.
   One of the oldest arguments against raising money through
lotteries is that the games are a regressive tax: People with the
lowest incomes contribute the most money.
   But Ralph Batch of the Public Gaming Research Institute said that
theory ``is not substantiated by 100 surveys.'' Besides, he said,
``when you are buying a lottery ticket on a voluntary basis, it's
not a definition of what I know of as a tax.''
