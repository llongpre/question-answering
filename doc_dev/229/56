   Two Illinois lottery players accomplished what
millions have failed to do in three previous weeks, matching all
six Lotto numbers to capture a grand prize of about $52 million,
the lottery director said Sunday.
   Despite cold weather and blowing snow that caused accidents and
closed roads, ticket sales peaked Saturday afternoon, hours before
the drawing for the second biggest Lotto prize in Illinois history,
Illinois State Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said at a morning news
conference.
   ``We ended up selling nearly $37 million worth of Lotto tickets
in the past week,'' she said. The total revenue collected for
payouts in Saturday's Lotto was more than $72 million, she said.
   The large grand prize and high sales volume followed three
straight rollovers of the Lotto jackpot after no one matched all
six numbers in the drawings of Feb. 3, Feb. 10 and Feb. 17. In its
16-year history, the Illinois lottery has never had a weekly
jackpot roll over four times.
   The previous biggest Illinois jackpot was $69.9 million, divided
by four Lotto players who each matched all six numbers in the
drawing of April 15, 1989.
   The weekend's winning numbers were 25, 31, 35, 36, 39 and 47. As
usual, the winners' identities cannot be confirmed until they step
forward and have their tickets validated by lottery officials.
