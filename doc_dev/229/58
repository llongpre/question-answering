   Lottery machines spewed out tickets by
the millions Friday as players scurried for a chance to win
Saturday's world-record $52 million Lotto jackpot.
   Tickets were selling at a rate of about 265 per second, said Ed
George, spokesman for the Florida lottery.
   For the day, 7.5 million tickets at $1 apiece had been sold by 5
p.m., compared to 4.9 million at the same time last Friday when the
jackpot was $32 million. The jackpot has been climbing because no
one has won since Aug. 6.
   Fridays are the lottery's second-biggest sales day. A full 50
percent of any week's sales are made on Saturdays through 10:30
p.m. when computerized ticket machines shut down for the 11 p.m.
drawings.
   Last week some 32 million tickets were sold. This week,
officials expected sales to hit 40 million.
   It took Florida only four months to break the world record for a
Lotto prize, which California set in June with a $51.4 million
prize that was shared by two winners. Florida launched its Lotto
game in April.
   In spite of the 14-million-to-one odds, the record-jackpot was
attracting players from bordering states in large numbers, lottery
officials said.
   Eight of the state's top 10 retailers, measured by ticket sales,
are located in Panhandle or northeast Florida counties bordering
Alabama and Georgia, neither of which has a legalized lottery, said
George.
   ``We do know that our border retailers are very heavy,'' said
George. ``Any one of those retailers will tell you what the tags
are on the cars in the parking lots.''
   The lottery's telephone hotline has been receiving calls from
out-of-state residents wanting to buy tickets without coming to
Florida. But because Postal Service regulations prohibit the sale
of the lottery tickets through the mail, people must visit Florida
to buy their tickets or have someone buy them.
   ``We've got so many people running in and out of here. I had
somebody call at 6 o'clock this morning wanting to know if I was
open,'' said Bill McMurtray, manager of a convenience store and
service station in Bradfordville, about eight miles south of the
Georgia border.
   Lotto players select six numbers from one through 49, mark their
selections on a computer card, which is read by a ticket machine.
   The $51.4 million California prize had been the world record,
according to Terri La Fleur, a senior editor at Gaming and Wagering
Business Magazine, a monthly trade publication in New York.
   Sam Valenza, publisher of Lottery Players magazine in
Moorestown, N.J., agreed with La Fleur. Spain's ``El Gordo''
lottery gave away $56 million in 1983, but it was not a Lotto-style
jackpot.
