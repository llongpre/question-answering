<LEADPARA>  California Lottery officials are considering a proposal to reduce the schools'
percentage of lottery proceeds to increase the prize pool, lottery director
Chon Gutierrez said.;    Gutierrez said Thursday he would support the plan
only if research indicated it would result in a large enough increase in
ticket sales to offset the lower percentage for schools.  </LEADPARA>

OFFICIALS SAY 6/53 IS STILL A BIG LOSER  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     But school officials vowed to oppose any reduction in their share.;   
"Absolutely, we would fight it," said California Superintendent of Public
Instruction Bill Honig. "Tell them to take it out of their share instead.";   
Schools now get 34 percent of all lottery money. Fifty percent is set aside
for prizes, and 16 percent goes to lottery administration.;    In response to
slumping lottery revenues, Gutierrez told the California Lottery Commission on
Wednesday that he would recommend scrapping the Lotto 6/53 game for a format
with better odds of winning.;    At a news conference Thursday, Gutierrez said
changes in the lotto game would be recommended as part of an overhaul of all
lottery games in an attempt to build participation.;    Los Angeles Unified
School District officials, who just cut more than $274 million from their
district's budget, said the district would be devastated by a reduction in
lottery revenues.;    "I'm in such shock I'm still trying to pick my jaw off
the floor," said Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein. "It's
absolutely appalling news. We're talking about an 'Alice in Wonderland'
approach to a measure that was passed by the voters precisely to be used for
education.";    In addition to setting aside more money for prizes, Gutierrez
said lottery officials would propose adding games based on themes now
prohibited, such as horse racing and poker.;    Gutierrez said lottery
marketing specialists are studying the feasibility of the various proposals
and said that he will ask the Lottery Commission, at its Sept. 17 meeting, to
endorse those ideas considered most likely to increase lottery revenues.;   
He acknowledged that changing the percentage of revenues going to schools --
which would require approval of the California Legislature -- would not be
easy. But he said the change could be beneficial if it boosts participation in
the games and increases revenues to schools.;    "These things have to be
addressed. It's time to make some changes," Gutierrez said.;    Lottery sales
are in their third consecutive year of decline, after peaking at $2.6 billion
in the 1988-89 fiscal year.;    "Lotto 6/53 produced a world record $118.8
million jackpot and slowed the year-long lotto sales decline that occurred in
the last year of 6/49, but it didn't stop the decline," Gutierrez said.;   
Gutierrez rejected Honig's suggestion to cut the amount of lottery revenues
going to administer the games of chance. Of the 16 cents of every dollar that
goes to administration, he said retailers get 6 cents and the advertising
budget takes 2 cents, leaving 8 cents for administrative costs such as
salaries, ticket printing, and computers.;    Gutierrez told the Lottery
Commission on Wednesday that players were staying away from the 6/53 game
because of a perception that its astronomical odds make it impossible to win.
One lottery commissioner recommended an immediate return to the 6/49 game
abandoned in favor of the 6/53 game in June 1990, but the other commissioners
opted to wait until next month's meeting to take any action.;    The lottery
director said other alternatives that might be considered by the commission
next month include:;    (check) Recommending that the Legislature allow games
now barred under the 1984 initiative that created the lottery, such as games
with horse racing or poker themes. Those prohibitions were included in the
original law to minimize opposition from Nevada casinos.;    (check) Starting
a public relations campaign to inform people where the lottery money goes and
how it helps schools and emphasizing that local school districts are free to
budget it as they see fit.;    (check) Changing the lotto game so that the
public believes it is "more winnable." The odds are 23 million-to-one against
picking six numbers right in the 6/53 game. In the 6/49 game, the odds against
a perfect card were 14 million-to-one.;    (check) Maximizing the amount of
prize money retailers may pay to winners in cash. Winners of $100 or more now
must wait several weeks for the state to determine that the person does not
owe money to the state. Gutierrez proposed raising the instant cash prize
limit to $599, the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service.;   
(check) Selling two chances for $1, rather than at a dollar each, and
elimination of the "quick pick" option. When players use the quick-pick method
and allow a computer to choose their numbers, it tends to distribute the
numbers further across the possible combinations than those chosen by
players.; Putting the spin on lottery; In addition to reducing the percentage
of lottery revenues for schools, the state lottery commission will be asked to
consider:; (box)Recommending that the Legislature allow games currently
barred, such as games with horse racing or poker themes.; (box)Starting a
public relations campaign to inform people where the lottery money goes and
how it helps schools.; (box)Changing the lotto game to make it 'more
winnable.'; Source: Lottery Director Chon Gutierrez  </TEXT>
