<TEXT>  A  "Voices That Care" -- as performed by such celebrities as Chevy Chase,
Meryl Streep, Whoopi Goldberg, David Cassidy and Fred Savage as a tribute to
the troops in the Persian Gulf -- was set to be released to music stores March
5. But the organization accepting donations for the "Voices That Care" project
says recordings from the Fox-TV network special are running a little behind
schedule. Audio cassettes currently are available at stores. You should check
your local music stores periodically for the CD and video. Incidentally,
proceeds from the sales go to the American Red Cross and the United Service
Organizations (USO).;    Unauthorized ATM withdrawals;  Q  According to my
bank statement, $80 was withdrawn from my Wells Fargo account through the
automated teller machine on Nov. 5. I called Wells Fargo, which said it would
investigate, and I arranged to have my personal identification number (PIN)
changed. Then someone withdrew $120 from my account on Nov. 13. My ATM card
was in my possession the entire time. No one else besides me knows my PIN, and
as the enclosed letter from my employer confirms, I was at work both times the
withdrawals took place. I called the bank's 24-hour service number and was
told a supervisor would contact me. When I called the next day, I was told
that the bank had exhausted its resources and that I should seek legal advice.
I believe a proper investigation wasn't conducted.;    -- Anthony Ines,
Gilroy; A  Wells Fargo has credited your account for $200, and the bank
apologizes for the inconvenience. You shouldn't have been told to seek legal
advice, says Wells Fargo spokesman Paul Elias. Instead, both you and bank
personnel should have followed the bank's guidelines, which require ATM
customers to complain in writing to the bank within 90 days of the disputed
transaction. The bank, which is regulated by the comptroller of the currency,
has 10 days to respond in writing to you. Elias says your case is puzzling but
wants to reassure other Wells Fargo customers that the bank takes all such
written complaints seriously and is confident that now that you have your new
PIN, these unauthorized transactions will cease.;    The odds on Little Lotto;
 Q  It occurs to me that the state is shafting the public again -- this time
with its Little Lotto scheme. It seems to me that the half-million-dollar
prize for hitting all six numbers is a bit unfair: There are 39 numbers in
Little Lotto, virtually three-quarters of the regular Lotto amount of 53. Why,
then, is the Little Lotto jackpot not worth $3 million for six numbers
(regular Lotto being $4 million)?;    -- F.C., Santa Clara; A  The California
lotteries don't work quite that way. Little Lotto was the California State
Lottery Commission's response to people wanting a Lotto game with better odds
and smaller cash prizes, says John Schade, a Lottery spokesman. So although
the top prize of $500,000 is smaller than that of Lotto 6/53, the odds are
much better. The odds of getting all six numbers in Little Lotto are one in
3.2 million; the odds in the 6/53 game are one in 22.9 million. Schade says
the public also wanted immediate payment of cash prizes rather than a top
prize paid out over 20 years, as is the case for Lotto 6/53. But that meant a
trade-off because by amortizing the full Lotto 6/53 prize, the Lottery
Commission never really had to cough up the full amount at once. Nevertheless,
the public doesn't seem to share your reservations. Schade says in Little
Lotto's debut week, a total of 8 million tickets were sold. There were two top
prize winners in the first draw and one top prize winner in the second draw,
Schade adds.;    Reaction: Montgomery books;  T  his is in reference to the
March 16 Action Line inquiry about the journals of Lucy Maud Montgomery,
author of "Anne of Green Gables." I thought your letter writer might want to
know that Montgomery, after her death, left 10 volumes of unpublished personal
diaries spanning the years 1889 to 1942. You referred to the two that have
been published by Oxford University Press. In 1988, the Canadian Encyclopedia
(Volume 3) reported that the rest were being edited.;    -- Lenora P. Blouin,;
