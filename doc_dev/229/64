<LEADPARA>  When Jerry Therault and an unnamed pal dropped more than 20,000 bucks on lotto
tickets a couple of years ago, the Scotts Valley man got a reputation as
somewhat of a high roller.;   But these days, said the 53-year-old Therault,
he won't even put up a buck for a chance to win the jackpot.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "When they went from the 6/49 game to the 6/53," said Therault, a
maintenance painter for Lockheed in Sunnyvale, "I swore I wouldn't waste my
money on it. The odds are too long.";   When the game switched from six
numbers out of 49 to six out of 53 last year, the odds on getting all digits
increased from 1 in 14 million to 1 in almost 23 million -- just too much for
Therault.;   But on a Wednesday night in September 1989, Jerry Therault
figured he had the best of chances to win all or part of the California
Lottery's $56.3 million lotto jackpot.;   Therault and a partner whom he still
won't name each put up $10,000 in their quest for the prize. After the owner
of a liquor store in Scotts Valley had run off 20,000 quick-pick numbers,
Therault put up an additional $175 out of his pocket.;   But Lady Luck was not
with Therault and his partner that night. The winning numbers, 2, 11, 19, 21,
28 and 32 were shared by nine other tickets, including one bought by 49
employees of a Fremont computer company, who split their $6.1 million share of
the jackpot.;   Therault and his friend got back about half of their
investment, he said, from tickets with some but not all of the winning
numbers.;   Subsequently, Therault said the other day, he contacted casinos in
Reno and at Lake Tahoe, saying he wanted to play the $10,000 he had gotten
back from lotto in the "Big Bertha" slot machines. Casino operators, who had
seen Therault on television and read of his lotto gamble in the press, were
eager to have him drop $10,000 in their slots, he said, but weren't willing to
give him and his wife a free room while he did it.;   So he stayed home, where
he now plays some poker and bets in friendly football pools from time to time,
he said.;   "I had a ball," Therault said. "All the publicity and the
interviews, it was great.";   Therault, who said he had more fun than he would
have had spending his cash on "another sea cruise," is quick to let you know
he would buy a lotto ticket now and then if the state would lower the odds.;  
"Then maybe you'll see me down there buying some tickets again."  </TEXT>
