<LEADPARA>  When Jerry Therault and an unnamed pal dropped more than 20,000 bucks on Lotto
tickets a couple of years ago, the Scotts Valley man got a reputation as
somewhat of a high roller.;    But these days, said the 53-year-old Therault,
he won't even put up a buck for a chance to win the jackpot.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "When they went from the 6/49 game to the 6/53," said Therault, a
maintenance painter for Lockheed in Sunnyvale, "I swore I wouldn't waste my
money on it. The odds are too long.";    When the game switched from six
numbers out of 49 to six out of 53 last year, the odds on getting all digits
increased from one in almost 14 million to one in almost 23 million -- just
too much for Therault.;    But on a Wednesday night in September 1989 Jerry
Therault figured he had the best of chances to win all or part of the
California Lottery's $56.3 million Lotto jackpot.;    Therault and a partner
whom he still won't name each put up $10,000 in their quest for the prize.
After the owner of a liquor store in Scotts Valley had run off 20,000
quick-pick numbers, Therault put up an additional $175 out of his pocket.;   
But Lady Luck was not with Therault and his partner that night. The winning
numbers, 2-11-19-21-28 and 32 were shared by nine other ticket-holders,
including 49 employees of a Fremont computer company who split their $6.1
million share of the jackpot.;    Therault and his friend got back about half
of their investment, he said, from tickets with some but not all of the
winning numbers.;    Subsequently, Therault said the other day, he contacted
casinos in Reno and at Lake Tahoe, saying he wanted to play the $10,000 he had
gotten back from Lotto in the "Big Bertha" slot machines. Casino operators,
who had seen Therault on television and read of his Lotto gamble in the press,
were anxious to have him drop $10,000 in their slots, he said, but weren't
willing to give him and his wife a free room while he did it.;    So he stayed
home, where he now plays some poker and bets in friendly football pools from
time to time, he said.;    "I had a ball," Therault said. "All the publicity
and the interviews, it was great.";    Therault, who said he had more fun than
he would have had spending his cash on "another sea cruise," is quick to let
you know he would buy a Lotto ticket now and then if the state would lower the
odds.;    "Then maybe you'll see me down there buying some tickets again."  </TEXT>
