<LEADPARA>  INDIANA LOTTERY losers now get a second chance, just a few touch tones away.
Since Oct. 14, they have been able to call a 900 number, punch in their losing
ticket number and enter a second drawing for a $20,000 prize.;   In
Massachusetts, lottery fans are now able to buy tickets via a 900 number,
paying for them later on their telephone bills.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In Texas, hoping to become millionaires and avoid new taxes, would-be
gamblers overwhelmingly voted Nov. 5 to end the 146-year-old ban against
state-run lotteries.;   Looming even larger on the lottery horizon are
so-called video lottery machines -- kissing cousins to slot machines.;   And
on the drawing boards are ticket purchases with credit cards, games that can
be played on home computers via telephone modems, and a national lottery
television show in which home viewers can participate.;   "You see experiments
now that you wouldn't have seen a few years ago," said William Bergman,
director of the National Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.;   The
reason: Lotteries have experienced a major slide in growth since 1988, either
because the novelty has worn off, because there's new competition from other
wagering games or because of the recession's drain on personal finances.;   
NINE STATES, including California, have reported declines in sales, according
to Christensen Cummings Associates of New York, which tracks the industry's
sales. Illinois, which is considering the use of 900 numbers, has stayed level
at $1.5 billion a year.;   But all 34 U.S. lotteries are reaching for new ways
to win customers. Whipping them on are deficit-ridden state governments that
have come to expect more of the $57 billion cash feed that lotteries have
given them over 17 years, the one tax that no one has to pay.;   Those
lotteries that aren't looking to technological innovations and gambling
industry clone games for their salvation are rethinking the size of their
prizes and the odds of winning them.;   The 16-state Lotto America, whose
sales have plunged as much as 60 percent in some weeks during the past six
months, is considering raising the odds so that million-dollar jackpots will
build to more exciting amounts. Lotto America also may triple its number of
lower-tier prizes.;   "There's a growing feeling that the decline is caused by
lack of winner reinforcement," said George Andersen, director of Minnesota's
lottery and a Lotto America board member. "If you don't win something, you
tend not to play, and it takes a larger and larger number to get you active.";
  There is no shortage of novel ideas to reinvigorate lotteries.;   In Oregon,
where ticket buyers can bet on sports games, they now may play a new keno game
every five minutes, with results shown on a television monitor at ticket
purchase sites.;   And Minnesota lottery officials had hoped to launch a pilot
project that would have let people buy lottery tickets through Nintendo units
in their homes.;    NINTENDO DECKS, estimated to be in 32 percent of Minnesota
homes, would have been equipped with special lottery cartridges and a
telephone modem. But the idea was abandoned after vocal protests from several
powerful state legislators.;   By far the most alluring and controversial new
growth area is the video lottery or poker blackjack machine, similar to those
that account for as much as 70 percent of income in some Las Vegas casinos.;  
The machines, already in use in South Dakota, Montana and West Virginia, are
set to be introduced next year in Oregon and Louisiana. As many as 23 states
are considering video lottery games.;   In South Dakota, where the machines
have been in bars, taverns and restaurants since late 1989, gross sales were
$25.5 million last year -- six times greater than for the state's instant
lottery.;   "The big game is video lottery. That towers over all the others in
the country," said Jim Davey, who hopes the machines will add $50 million a
year to his $200-million-a-year Oregon state lottery.;   But the machines have
not been met with open arms in many state legislatures. Some lawmakers in
Oregon and other states question the authority of lottery officials to
introduce video lottery machines.;   "There is a sense that it is bad public
policy and not within the mandate of the lottery, or the character of the
state," said Fred McGibney, director of the Vermont lottery commission, which
rejected video lottery games last year.;   But competitive pressures may
change such attitudes. Just as the Illinois lottery created the desire for
lotteries in neighboring Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana and Missouri, a similar
effect is being generated by South Dakota's video lottery machines.;  
"Lotteries are moving toward harder forms of gambling to deflect criticism
from their stagnant sales, and states are looking toward harder forms of
gambling, envisioning that they will generate the revenues that lotteries
did," said Michael Jones, whose Chicago-based marketing promotion company
specializes in gaming.;   AMERICANS spent $10 billion on lottery tickets last
year -- twice as much as they did on movie theater tickets, according to
Christensen Cummings Associates.;   Despite their incredibly bad odds, lottery
tickets remain "a vent, a palliative . . . popular during times when people
aren't socially optimistic," said Mark Pastin, director of the Lincoln Center
for Ethics at Arizona State University. "It's still a kind of hope anybody can
buy for a few bucks."  </TEXT>
