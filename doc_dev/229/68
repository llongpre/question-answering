   No one won Florida's $32 million Lotto
jackpot, pushing the grand prize in the weekly numbers game to at
least $50 million, only $1.4 million short of the nation's record
lottery prize.
   Lottery officials estimate each week's jackpot based on
projected sales.
   But Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said Sunday she didn't know
if ticket sales would surpass expectations this week and push the
jackpot past the national record. ``We don't know what's going to
happen,'' she said.
   The size of the prize should give Florida's lottery national
exposure that will help attract tourists to the months-old game,
Mrs. Paul said.
   ``That is really, really good for the state of Florida,'' she
said.
   The national record for a lottery prize was set in June when
California gave away $51.4 million to two winners.
   In the Florida Lotto game, players try to match six numbers from
one through 49. Tickets are $1.
   No one matched the six winning numbers drawn Saturday _ 20, 42,
6, 29, 45 and 26.
   The prizes are rolled over into the next week's purse, fueling
sales as they get bigger. The Florida jackpot increases quickly,
compared with other states, partly because the state set up its
lottery with some of the toughest odds of any lottery in the nation
_ nearly 14 million to 1 against winning.
   Florida joined 27 states and the District of Columbia that have
legalized lotteries when the Lotto game started in April.
   Three drawings have now passed without a grand prize winner.
Emily Davidheiser of Brandon claimed the $26 million prize from the
Aug. 6 drawing.
   More than 32 million Lotto tickets were sold this last week,
according to Mrs. Paul.
