<HEADLINE>  LOTTERY TURNS DOWN TARDY WINNER'S PLEA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Paul Manarang, 42, of Mission Viejo lamented the lottery's refusal to pay
him the prize money, which now goes to a state education fund.;    "They are
too strict," Manarang said Monday after learning his appeal to lottery
Director Chon Gutierrez was denied.;    A Philippine immigrant, Manarang said
he may file a lawsuit to claim his winnings.;    "Our director feels bad,"
Matal said. "But . . . that's the way the lottery rules and regulations
read.";    Manarang said he bought the lottery ticket bearing five correct
numbers and a bonus number on June 23, 1990, and promptly threw it into a car
glove compartment.;    He found it just before the expiration of the 180-day
claim deadline. Nervous about his immigration status, Manarang asked his
niece's husband, Jason Shauf of Los Angeles, to pick up the winnings.;    But
Shauf arrived at the lottery office a day late. Gutierrez rejected Manarang's
appeal on Friday.;    Manarang said he had hoped to use the $139,595 to bring
his sister to the United States. He claims his sister is undergoing kidney
dialysis treatments in his native country.;    "We are appealing for
humanitarian reasons," he said. "I don't need the money except for the sake of
my sister."  </TEXT>
