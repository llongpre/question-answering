<LEADPARA>  The state decided Thursday to remake its ailing lottery by scrapping most
games in favor of a lineup that features Super Lotto, designed to give players
better odds of winning a fat jackpot.;   But there are questions about whether
the public will agree it's a super game when it replaces Lotto 6/53 on Dec. 15.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LOTTERY'S GAME PLAN: SUPER LOTTO IS IN; MOST OTHERS
OUT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Super Lotto, a 6/51 (pick six of 51 numbers) game, will have 1-in-18
million odds, better than Lotto 6/53's 1-in-23 million odds but worse than the
original lotto game's 1-in-14 million odds.;   Officials expect the size of
Super Lotto jackpots to be at least as large as those of the current lotto
game.;   Other games planned for introduction next year or in 1993 include a
pick-five-numbers game, a daily lotto game and a game based on Keno.;  
Officials said many of the designs are based on popular games in other
states.;   Scratch-off ticket games will continue.;   The policy-setting
Lottery Commission voted 4-0 to approve the overhaul, which was proposed by
new director Sharon Sharp.;   "The California Lottery has never reached its
full potential. We have plans in place to take it where it should be," said
Sharp, who was picked by Gov. Pete Wilson to replace former director Chon
Gutierrez in September.;   Longtime board member William Johnston said he
liked the overall plan. "I think the excitement the new director has brought
us is promising," he said.;   The changes were spurred by sagging sales. This
fiscal year, sales have hit just over $500 million -- 25 percent below
projections for 1991-'92.;   Gutierrez and others blamed much of the problem
on the economic recession, but critics cited poor marketing decisions.;   The
lottery, approved by voters in 1984, gives at least 34 percent of its total
revenue to public education. The funds make up less than 3 percent of schools'
budget.;   Until the new games go into effect, Sharp said she was "ready to
beg the players to stick with us." She said there is a negligible budget for
advertising.;   In Super Lotto, there will be no five-plus-bonus category, as
in Lotto 6/53. The match-five numbers prize will be reduced somewhat below the
same category in the current Lotto 6/53, but the match-three and match-four
prizes will continue at their current levels and have improved odds.;   The
other new games in the lineup include "Fantasy 5," a pick five-of-39 game that
will replace Little Lotto, a pick six-of-39 game; a daily pick-three-numbers
game to replace Decco; and a Keno game, in which players will pick odds and
prizes up to $1 million.;   Fantasy 5 is scheduled for introduction in
February 1992, the daily pick-three-numbers game for April 1992, and Keno for
sometime in fiscal 1993.;   Central to plans is winning state controller
permission to pay off larger prizes instantly at the retailer, rather than
forcing players to wait for mailed payoffs from the lottery.  </TEXT>
