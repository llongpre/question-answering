   For the past few months, the Ohio Lottery has
been flashing an ad on the scoreboard of Cleveland Stadium
reminding fans that a $3 million lottery jackpot isn't ``chicken
feed'' or ``chopped liver.''
   During an era when jackpots around the country are regularly
topping $20 million, the stadium ad is part of a campaign to stir
up interest in ``Super Lotto'' prizes that a decade ago would have
made newspaper front pages.
   ``We are looking for an expanded base of players,'' said Anne
Bloomberg, Ohio Lottery spokeswoman. ``We want the players to
understand that $3 million is a lot of money. While the giant
jackpots get a lot of focus, $150,000 (annual earnings for 20 years
in a $3 million prize) is a lot of money.''
   The explosion in the size of lottery jackpots may hinder play
around the country on games with relatively smaller prizes by
dampening enthusiasm about winning a few million dollars, said Paul
Dworin, publisher of Gaming and Wagering Business magazine in New
York.
   ``Florida awards a $55 million jackpot, and a lot of people are
not going to get excited by lower numbers,'' Dworin said. ``Why
play when it's $10 million if it could be $50 million?''
   Florida's $55 million prize, awarded after a Sept. 3 drawing, is
the nation's largest lottery jackpot to date. Six of the 10 largest
jackpots have been awarded this year, records show.
   Many state lotteries say it takes a bigger jackpot today to
trigger ``lotto mania,'' described as the point when sales increase
dramatically and the news media become interested in a prize. In
most ``lotto'' contests, participants try to guess a series of
numbers to be drawn, and the prize grows if nobody gets the correct
match.
   In Illinois, the attitude of players has changed since the state
started its lottery in 1974 and introduced a high-payoff lotto game
in 1983, said Kathy Rem, lottery communication director.
   ``After a lottery has been around a number of years, people get
used to it. Our players have gotten more sophisticated,'' Ms. Rem
said.
   Asked when ``lotto mania'' begins, she added, ``If you wanted a
number, I'd say $20 million.''
   New York recently changed its lottery advertising strategy to
attract upscale, casual players, said Russell Gladieux, acting
director of the New York State Lottery.
   ``We've completely restructured our advertising to get the
person who wouldn't play for $4 million but would play for $20
million,'' Gladieux said. ``We've begun featuring well-dressed,
well-educated, real people who share their dream of winning, on
television.''
   New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine operate a tri-state lotto, but
with a combined population of less than 3 million and a top jackpot
of $9.6 million, the contest may never generate ``lotto mania,''
said Rick Wisler, games manager for the New Hampshire Sweepstakes
Commission.
   Blaine Lewis Jr., president of the North American Association of
State and Provincial Lotteries, said newspaper coverage illustrates
how interest has waned in jackpots of a few million dollars.
   ``In 1983, with a $1.4 million winner in Connecticut, we got a
front page story in The Hartford Courant,'' said Lewis, who tracks
lotteries in 28 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands and five Canadian provinces. He said the same
lottery story in 1988 probably wouldn't make the front section of
the newspaper.
   ``People and the press are getting jaded, but most people still
realize a million dollars is a lot of money,'' he said.
   Dworin said one way to increase ticket sales and jackpots is for
lotteries to increase the odds of winning.
   ``If you increase the (choice of numbers), the odds are much
longer and therefore even if more people play, there's a higher
chance of rollover and a higher chance of larger jackpots,'' Dworin
said.
   In Ohio, where buyers select six numbers from a pool of 44, the
odds are one in 7 million and the largest prize to date has been
$32 million. Ms. Bloomberg said there are several points when sales
increase.
   ``Ten million dollars is the first breaking point where some
casual players come in,'' said Ms. Bloomberg. ``At $13 million to
$15 million, about 80 percent come in.''
   She said once the jackpot exceeds $15 million, just about
everyone in the state starts to play except lottery officials who
can't by law.
   ``When we get the big jackpots, the attention heightens
visibility, which heightens sales, which heightens the jackpot and
it just keeps going,'' she said.
