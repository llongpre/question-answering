<LEADPARA>  "Super Lotto," the latest attempt by the California Lottery to reinvigorate
the twice-weekly lotto drawings, gets under way Sunday with improved odds to
try to lure players back to the fold.;   But there apparently won't be much
hoopla. Lottery officials have said little except that players will try to
pick six numbers between one and 51. The odds of winning the top prize are 1
in 18 million.  </LEADPARA>
