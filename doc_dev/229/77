   Floridians snatched up Lotto jackpot
tickets Thursday, the day after officials upped the pot to $52
million, a world record for lotteries where the winner can take all.
   By noon, Thursday's ticket sales topped 2 million, a 51.8
percent increase over the 1.3 million tickets sold all day a week
earlier when residents were trying to win a $32 million jackpot.
   More than 13 million of the $1 tickets have been sold so far
this week, a 36.7 percent increase over the 9.6 million sold by the
same time last week.
   Since no one picked the six numbers drawn Saturday, the $32
million prize, which included the grand prizes of the two previous
weeks, was rolled over to be included in this week's jackpot.
   No one has won the grand prize in the weekly numbers game since
Aug. 6, when a Brandon woman won a $26 million jackpot.
   Lottery officials increased this week's jackpot from $50 million
to $52 million based on estimates that 40 million tickets would be
sold, according to Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul. Last week some
32 million tickets were sold.
   It took Florida only four months to break the world record for a
Lotto prize, which California set in June with a $51.4 million
prize that went to two people. California's biweekly numbers game
was 21 months old when it produced that jackpot.
   That had been the world record, according to Terri La Fleur, a
senior editor at Gaming and Wagering Business Magazine, a monthly
trade publication based in New York.
   Sam Valenza, publisher of Lottery Players magazine in
Moorestown, N.J., agreed with La Fleur. Spain's El Gordo lottery
registered a $56 million jackpot in 1983, but Valenza said Spain's
lottery was very different from Florida's Lotto game.
   In Spain's lottery, players don't choose their numbers, which
are already printed on tickets. Also, several winning entries are
guaranteed in each of the five or six drawings held each year.
