<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Associated Press; LOTTERY FEVER -- Thousands of hopeful folks
line up to buy lottery tickets at the Nipton Trading Post in Nipton. Some
people waited in line for six hours to buy tickets for tonight's drawing. The
store, near the California-Nevada border, is about 65 miles from Las Vegas and
the closest place from that city to buy tickets. (ran in p.m. editions only)  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  Today, the regulars at the Eastside Senior Center will play their weekly game
of "Loteria", a Mexican-style bingo, but their heads will be swimming with
fantasies of winning tonight's California Lotto with a jackpot that could
smash the $115.5 million national record.;    "I have this dream all the time,
that some day I will get a little bit of the lottery," Magdalena Rodriguez, a
77-year-old great-grandmother, said Tuesday as she joined her friends at the
San Jose center in imagining what it would be like.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "With that money, you could really do a lot of things," said Rodriguez, who
plans to wager $5. "Whooooo boy!";    The elders' eagerness to challenge
lotto's 1-in-23 million odds may prove that hope springs eternal. And they
aren't alone; ticket sales hit $3 million in one hour alone Tuesday as
officials projected a jackpot of at least $100 million.;    That would be the
third-highest in U.S. history, but, "If our sales continue at the pace at
which they're moving right now, we expect to break the $115.5 million record"
Jana Matal, a lottery spokeswoman, said. That record was set in Pennsylvania
in 1989.;    Lottery Director Chon Gutierrez even speculated that the total
could exceed $120 million, an annual payout of $4.8 million a year for 20
years, the equivalent of $13,000 a day.;    Those are mind-boggling numbers,
but when asked how they would spend such a jackpot, the retired farm and
cannery workers at the senior center on Alum Rock Avenue floated everyday
dreams of helping their loved ones and others in need.;    "The first thing
I'd do is help the little homeless kids in Iraq," Isabela Tamayo, 82, said
after seeing the dying Kurdish children fleeing their war-ravaged country on
television. "When I see those children, I have a pain in my heart, because I
cannot help them.";    And what would they do for themselves?;    "I would get
my false teeth fixed, and I need new glasses," said Rodriguez, a widow clad in
a sky-blue-and-white sweater and white skirt. She said she would also help her
widowed daughter, who is struggling to support two children, including one who
cannot afford college.;    Some of the elders, though, grumbled that the
lottery doesn't do enough to help the state's education system and that the
odds of winning are too high. And Heliodoro Pena Gonzalez, who planned to
spend $15 on tickets this week, pondered whether becoming a multimillionaire
would be his ruin.;    At first, the 67-year-old former cannery worker came up
with simple plans for his winnings: "I'd give a donation to the schools and to
the children who are hungry. I don't need the money, because I'm too old.
Maybe buy a couple (pair) of pants and eat good.";    As the idea grew on him,
though, the temptations cropped up: "But if I won $100 million, maybe I'd go
crazy, go to big parties and start drinking. The money is the trouble.;   
"But, if I remain poor, I won't change," he added, somewhat reassured to be
back on solid ground.; WHAT'S 23 MILLION-TO-1?; Just how remote are the 23
million-to-1 odds of winning that alluring $100 million lottery jackpot
Wednesday?; (box)If you buy 50 tickets a week, you should win the jackpot once
every 9,000 years, said Mike Orkin, head of the statistics department at
California State University, Hayward. Or, said Ken Alexander, a mathematics
professor at the University of Southern California, "If your ancestors played
the lottery since the time of Jesus, shelling out $10,000 a year, on average
they still would not have that first jackpot."; (box)If you have to drive 10
miles to buy a lotto ticket, you are four times more likely to get killed in a
car crash on the way to buy the ticket than you are to win the jackpot, Orkin
said.; (box)P.T. Barnum said there's a sucker born every minute. So, Orkin
said, if you take every sucker born since 1945, you get about one lotto
jackpot winner.; (box)If it takes you 20 seconds to fill out one ticket, you'd
have to work non-stop for 15 years to fill out all the number combinations. If
someone else also picked the winning combination, you'd lose money on your $23
million investment, Orkin said.; Source: Karen A. Gallegos -- Knight-Ridder
News Service; HOW WOULD YOU SPEND $100 MILLION?; (box)Gov. Pete Wilson: He
"would make a down payment -- a very small down payment -- on the state's
$12.6 billion budget gap. That gives you a perspective on just how large the
deficit is," a spokesman, Franz Wosner, said.; (box)Hannibal Giudice, a Novato
Astrologer: "I'd open up an astrology center in Northern California so people
could have affordable access to astrology. This area is a hotbed!" Anything
frivolous? "Ha! I'm a Capricorn, honey. We don't do many frivolous things. But
if I had to think about it, oh, sure, I'd be in Tahiti so fast it'd make your
head spin."; (box)Jim McEntee, executive director of Santa Clara County Human
Relations Commission: "I would retire immediately. I would try to make sure my
children had an opportunity to get into homes of their own. . . . Then I would
like to do some traveling; I still have relatives in Ireland, and I've never
been there. Then I'd take the bulk of the money and build some affordable
housing in such a way that the greatest number of people could be taken care
of."; (box)San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer: "The first thing that comes to mind
is, with one stroke of the pen, I could solve the budget deficit for this
fiscal year. Probably help my kids in some way, if one of them was ready, to
make a down payment on a house."; (box)Carol Doda, former stripper, now lead
singer of Carol Doda and Her Lucky Stiffs rock band: "I would try to set up
some kind of fund for the homeless in conjunction with the Salvation Army and
create a program to help the homeless rehabilitate themselves, not just have a
place to sleep." No fantasies? "My whole life certainly has been a fantasy, so
it's hard to come up with frivolous ideas. . . . But OK: I'd buy a house. I'd
probably break down and buy a new car. I would get my rock band booming and
buy my way to fame."; (box)A's slugger Jose Canseco, who is convinced he also
could pitch in the big leagues:: "I wouldn't take a salary for baseball, but
if they wanted me to play for their team, I'd have to pitch and play a
position."; (box)A's Manager Tony La Russa: "Buy a newspaper."  </TEXT>
