<LEADPARA>  Gov. Pete Wilson stepped directly into the California Lottery crisis Tuesday,
saying he will soon appoint a new director to overhaul the games and freezing
current plans for reversing steep sales declines.;    The policy-setting
Lottery Commission, at Wilson's request, voted 5-0 to delay a proposal by
Executive Director Chon Gutierrez that would have made sweeping changes.  </LEADPARA>

GOVERNOR SEEKS OVERHAUL TO STOP SLUMPING SALES  </HEADLINE>

SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 9/19/91, pg. 1E);  Because of an editor's
error, a chart in Wednesday's Mercury News gave the wrong figure for
California lottery sales per capita for 1990. The correct figure is $83.10.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     A primary aspect of the plan, which Gutierrez said was compiled by a summit
of "the brightest minds" in the lottery, would have dropped the new Lotto 6/53
game in favor of returning to the more popular Lotto 6/49, with its better
odds.;    "I am in the process of selecting a new executive director, and will
announce my decision very soon," Wilson said in a letter to lottery
commissioners.;    "I must urge . . . the commission to postpone action on
such (major policy change) proposals until they are presented to you by the
next executive director," the Republican governor told the commission, which
is composed of Republican administration appointees.;    Can call special
meeting;  Although the commission delayed changes, it left the way open to
call a special meeting on 48 hours' notice in the next few weeks in case a new
director is appointed and wants to move forward with any proposals.;   
Gutierrez, who has held the post since 1987, said that unless the commission
acts in two to three weeks, any game changes might have to be postponed until
next year. The Thanksgiving-Christmas holiday period has been found to be a
poor time for introducing new lottery games.;    Unprecedented downturns in
sales recently have meant unprecedented cutbacks in the lottery's
administrative operations. The commission Tuesday approved cutting another
$5.5 million from an already pared down 1991-'92 spending plan by slashing
more jobs and the promotions budget.;    Officials can use only up to 16
percent of the lottery's expected total sales of nearly $2 billion for
operations. The figure is set by the 1984 ballot initiative that authorized
the lottery.;    Once a trendy pastime, the California Lottery is now the
biggest loser in the lottery industry nationally, where runaway sales growth
is flattening, according to industry analysts.;    Sharpest decline;    Though
lottery sales have been weakening across the nation, California's decline has
been much sharper. Nationally, lottery sales are expected to grow no more than
3.5 percent for 1991, following double-digit growth in recent years, said
William Bergman, executive director of the North American Association of State
and Provincial Lotteries.;    California, though, saw sales fall 14 percent
for its 1991 fiscal year. The 33 U.S. lotteries in 1990 grossed $20.8 billion,
up 7 percent over the previous year's $19.4 billion. The growth rate slowed
from double-digit gains of 14 percent in 1989 and 30 percent in 1988.;   
Bergman cited several reasons: Weakness in the national economy, news about
the Persian Gulf war crowding out publicity that the lottery normally would
reap, and California's decision to greatly lengthen the odds of hitting the
lotto jackpot.;    "This has not been an easy year for anybody's business,
never mind lotteries," Bergman said.;    James Hosker, president of the
lottery association and head of Kentucky's lottery, said he believes
California sales have lagged for several reasons.;    Payout too small;  The
lottery's payout in prizes -- 50 percent -- isn't big enough, he said. Too
many prizes must be claimed weeks after winning, instead of being instantly
payable at ticket agents, he said. And there have been too few games offered
at any one time, he said.;    "These are the way you sell products," he said.
"I'm out here to sell a product.";    Revenue to California public education,
which gets at least 34 percent of the lottery's gross sales, has dropped as a
result of the sales decline.;    Although lottery funds make up just 3 percent
of the budget for schools, about two-thirds of school districts have rejected
state officials' advice and used the money for ongoing needs rather than
supplementary uses.;    In asking the commission to delay action of current
management's proposals, Wilson said that the new executive director "will have
a mandate to undertake a variety of initiatives that will make the California
Lottery the nation's leader once again.;    "I am sure you will agree . . .
that the next executive director should assume office with as much flexibility
as possible to design new games and reduce unnecessary expenditures," he
said.; CHART: Carl Neiburger -- Mercury News; Lottery woes; Lottery sales ahve
