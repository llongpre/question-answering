   Residents are wondering whether one of
their neighbors in this town of 14,500 will step forward and claim
the world's largest single lottery jackpot.
   The winning ticket for Florida's $54 million Lotto prize was
bought at one of Longwood's 24 lottery outlets, lottery officials
said.
   Some people are so curious about the winner's identity that
they've flagged down police officers on patrol.
   ``People are really interested,'' said officer Robert Hemmert.
``We're up in the air. We're just as curious as anybody else.''
   Residents may have to wait a while. Last month, it took Emily
Davidheiser 10 days to step forward and identify herself as the
winner of a $26 million jackpot.
   Winners have 180 days to claim their prizes. Lottery offices are
closed until Tuesday.
   Although lottery officials can't project the exact payout until
Tuesday, the annual payment to one winner would be about $2.16
million each year after taxes, using a lottery department formula
that divides total winnings by 20 years and deducts 20 percent of
the yearly windfall for taxes.
   Longwood Mayor David Gunter said he was pleased the winning
ticket was bought in his town, once known as the poultry capital of
Florida.
   ``It might put Longwood on the map now,'' he said. ``Whether
they just bought the ticket here or whether they live here, it
means a lot to a community like this.
   ``We're going to take the credit. It feels good.''
   The week's lottery frenzy was a bonanza for promoting the
Florida lottery, which has set numerous sales records in its first
year and attracted worldwide attention.
   The huge jackpot pushed Saturday sales to 14.6 million and total
weekly Lotto purchases to 44.78 million.
   The jackpot for this week's Florida Lotto drawing will begin at
$7 million.
   The Florida jackpot topped the previous record prize for a
numbers game, the $51.4 million shared by two people who bought
winning tickets for California's lottery on June 4.
   Florida's single-ticket win also set a record for the largest
individual Lotto prize, beating the $46 million won on one ticket
in the Pennsylvania lottery in October 1987.
