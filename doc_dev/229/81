California Lottery officials said they will expand hours of ticket sales for 
the mid-week Lotto 6/53 drawing to accommodate gamblers dreaming of winning a 
projected jackpot of $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales will start an hour earlier, at 5 a.m. today and Wednesday, and 
remain open an hour later, until 11 p.m., through tonight, lottery Executive 
Director Chon Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
No one picked all six numbers in last Saturday's drawing, causing the jackpot 
to roll over for Wednesday's game.
