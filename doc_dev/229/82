      Finally, Uniform Data
   On State's Economies
   CALIFORNIA'S economy is bigger than Ohio's. 
All right, you knew that. 
But how much bigger? 
It used to be just a guess. 

   This summer, though, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis published a set of gross state product numbers. 
These figures provide the first comprehensive look at the economic output of each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 

   The numbers are a statistical watershed, eagerly awaited by those who track state and regional economies. 
Many states compute their own GSP, but no one outside the federal government has had the resources and access to data to figure output for every state on a uniform basis. 
The project, more than 10 years in the making, largely follows the formula for the U.S. gross national product, aiming to determine the value of goods and services produced by a state in a given period. 

   For all the anticipation, there were few surprises in the initial report, which lists state GSP figures for each year from 1963 to 1986. 
The most populous states are the economic heavyweights. 
Output of the top 10 states in 1986 totaled $2.4 trillion, or 56% of U.S. GNP. Vermont's 1986 output was less than 2% of California's GSP.

   How the States Play
   The Lottery Game
   WOULD YOUR company be happy with a 44% profit margin? That's the performance turned in by New York's state lottery.
   New York's lottery had revenue of $1.51 billion, nearly all from ticket sales, in the year ended in March 1987. After subtracting prize money, commissions to sellers, and the cost of advertising and other expenses, the lottery commission returned $666.8 million to the state treasury, the highest profit margin among the 23 states with lotteries.
   Here are other glimpses of lottery action from the accounting firm Laventhol &amp; Horwath.
   Heaviest bettors: Massachusetts sold $260 of lottery tickets for every state resident in the 12 months ended last November. That's $66 more per capita than the runner-up, the District of Columbia. The high sales in Massachusetts reflect its lottery's liberal payoff policy: The state returned 60% of its ticket sales in prize money, the highest share of any state.
   Biggest loser: California's lottery profits fell 27% in fiscal 1987 from a year earlier. Poor marketing when Lotto games were introduced appears to have left Californians confused, hurting sales. Ticket sales have revived in 1988.
   Thriftiest operation: New Jersey's lottery spent less than 2% of its ticket revenue on operating expenses, not including commissions and prizes. In contrast, West Virginia's lottery expenses were 19% of revenue.
   Old Strongholds Have
   Most Manufacturing
   HERE'S MORE evidence that the Great Lakes states and the Northeast remain the nation's manufacturing strongholds. In its 1988 study of states' hospitality toward manufacturing, the Chicago-based accounting firm Grant Thornton singles out states that are "manufacturing intensive."
   The firm uses two criteria: A state's manufacturing shipments must be greater than 2% of the U.S. total, and roughly 17% of its work force must be on manufacturing payrolls.
   Only 12 states meet both standards, and nine are in the traditional manufacturing heartland: Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Massachusetts. The three outsiders are all in the Southeast: North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia.
   This doesn't necessarily mean Grant Thornton thinks these industrial powerhouses are ideal manufacturing locations. Using a variety of factors, most of them linked to business costs, the accounting firm rates New Hampshire as the best factory site among 27 states with substantial manufacturing. New Hampshire's low taxes, low unemployment compensation ($46 a year per member of the work force, against a national average of $197), and relative abundance of skilled workers helped earn the top ranking. Missouri and North Carolina were runners-up.
   Heavy-manufacturing states such as Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Indiana finish near the bottom of the business-climate standings. These states have relatively high numbers of union workers and high wage and benefit levels, which are considered negative factors in Grant Thornton's rating system.
   Odds and Ends
   THE OIL AND GAS recession hasn't hit Kern County, Calif., where 1,686 wells were completed in 1987 with a 98% success rate, according to Petroleum Information of Denver. Almost all the wells were sunk in producing oil fields. . . . California's $4.25 minimum wage is the nation's highest. Connecticut's minimum wage will rise to $4.25 in October, from $3.75. . . . Georgia's Legislature creates an official state butterfly, the tiger swallowtail.
