The California State Lottery hit the jackpot in the last fiscal year as 
revenues reached $2.6 billion, lottery Executive Director Chon Gutierrez 
announced Wednesday in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Record-breaking fiscal 1988-89 lottery sales for the first time provided more 
than $1 billion to the state's public education system, Gutierrez said. "We had 
a terrific year, the best one yet." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Unified School District is the second-largest recipient of 
lottery money, trailing only Los Angeles schools, according to Lottery figures. 
San Diego city schools will receive more than $20 million from 1988-89 lottery 
proceeds, part of the $78 million due schools in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
School officials have already included the anticipated lottery revenues in the 
district's current $540 million budget, said Acting Supt. Cathy Hopper. The 
money is not designated for specific projects, and is used simply to balance 
the books, Hopper said. 
</P>
<P>
By law, at least 34% of lottery revenues is earmarked for public education, but 
that number rose to 40% last year, according to Gutierrez. The lottery awarded 
half of its income to prize winners and spent 10% on expenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery's contributions to public schools rose by a third from the 1987-88 
fiscal year, Gutierrez said. Lottery funds make up 3% of school budgets 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery distributes money to the school systems based on their size. For 
the fiscal year that ended June 30, districts earned $181 from the lottery for 
every student enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery surveys show that 60% of Californians played the weekly Lotto or an 
instant game within the last month, according to Gutierrez. Although state 
residents are still buying only a third as many tickets per-capita as players 
in Ohio and Massachusetts, sales for July point to the current fiscal year 
being another record breaker, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hopper said lottery experts have warned her district not to expect 
another record-breaking year. "A lot of people have been telling us that the 
lottery has peaked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez disagreed. He said fully automated, self-service Lotto machines due 
in San Diego within months, and a daily drawing game set to begin next year 
will push sales higher.
