<LEADPARA>  William Baroni plunked down a $10 bill Wednesday afternoon for a six-pack of
beer and a TV dinner. As the clerk started to hand over $3 in change, Baroni
told the clerk to instead give him three lotto quick picks.;    The
spur-of-the-moment decision will enable the 40-year-old Castro Valley resident
to go from beer and TV dinners to champagne and caviar.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The third of the quick picks was the winning lotto combination, giving
Baroni half of a $39.2 million jackpot -- the 10th-largest in state lottery
history. After taxes are taken out, he will receive $786,000 annually over the
next 20 years.;    The other half of the jackpot went to Harvey and Rita
Ussery of Tustin.;    "It's just one of those miracles come true," the
soft-spoken Baroni said at a news conference Friday morning at the California
Lottery's district office in San Jose.;    The good fortune will change his
life "quite a bit, going from a worker bee to a rich man," he said.;    Baroni
is an electrician -- or he was an electrician until Friday morning, when he
quit his job with AMC Electric Co. in Pleasanton.;    "I'm not going to work
for anybody anymore," he said, displaying an ear-to-ear smile. "I'm going to
work on my golf swing.";    An 8-handicap golfer who is usually able to play
only on weekends, Baroni plans to tee up much more frequently and try to lower
his handicap "close to scratch.";    Later he joked, "I might live on a golf
course.";    Baroni also plans to buy a new pickup truck. He now rents an
apartment from his parents, but, he mused, he may buy "some land and a house
in the future . . . no rush to do that.";    Other than that, Baroni wants to
keep a low profile and figure out how he will share the wealth with his
parents, two brothers, a sister and his 15-year-old son, who lives in South
Carolina. For starters he may take relatives to Hawaii this summer and play
golf on Maui.;    For the owners of the East Hills market where Baroni got the
luck of the draw, the victory came two months too late. Before Dec. 1, they
would have received .5 percent of the jackpot -- or about $95,000.;    But the
California Lottery changed the commission formula for the retailers who sell
tickets. The retailers' share of the total ticket sales at their stores went
up from 5 percent to 6 percent, but their jackpot share was eliminated.;   
"That's the law, what can I say?" said a disappointed Philip Han, the store
owner. "(But) I'm just happy one of our customers won.";    Some independent
store owners have complained about the new formula. They would prefer to take
the gamble on the possibility of selling a winning ticket rather than receive
an increase in their share of the total ticket sales.;    The California
Lottery Commission is expected to take another look at the formula next month.  </TEXT>
