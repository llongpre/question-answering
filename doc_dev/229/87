   Dreams of riches churned out of Florida Lotto
machines at a rate of more than 850 a second Saturday as fortune
hunters rushed for a chance to win the nation's largest-ever
lottery jackpot, an estimated $52 million.
   ``We've gotten calls from London, Australia and Spain asking
about the Lotto game,'' said state Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul.
   The payoff was estimated at $52 million, officials said. The
previous record jackpot of $51.4 million was set in California in
June; two winners split that one.
   Players turned to psychics, gimmicks and other formulas to beat
the 14 million-to-1 odds of picking the six winning digits out of
49.
   The six numbers drawn Saturday night were 3-27-19-35-20-5.
   Lottery officials did not expect to know if anyone matched the
six numbers until sometime Sunday.
   At times Saturday, tickets were going at a pace of 859 a second,
said Mrs. Paul. By 11 p.m., sales for the day were $14.60 million,
and $44.78 million for the week. The previous week, total sales
were $24.2 million.
   ``Frantic isn't the word,'' said James Salvatore, owner of Lotto
News in Miami, which has sold more than 40,000 of the $1 tickets
since last Sunday. ``It's madness.''
   There hasn't been a winner in the drawing since Aug. 6. That
boosted the jackpot with each passing week. A week ago, the jackpot
was at $30 million.
   ``The public is going wild,'' said James Stephen, manager of the
Stop'n'Go convenience store in Riviera Beach. ``They are lined up.
They are standing in line 30 minutes, an hour. It doesn't matter.
It's totally crazy.''
   Mrs. Paul said the heavy pace of ticket sales, which may exceed
40 million for the week, could boost the jackpot above $53 million.
   Mrs. Paul touts the lottery as a way to attract tourists to
Florida, and people were spilling over the borders in search of
tickets.
   David Kelley, owner of the Interstate Lottery Courier Service in
Stafford, Va., drove 700 miles to Jacksonville on Thursday to buy
4,000 tickets. By Friday evening, all the tickets were sold for
$1.75 each.
   Kelley was scheduled to return Saturday evening on a flight from
Jacksonville with 2,300 more tickets, said his wife, Judy. ``And
about 700 to 800 of those are already reserved,'' she said.
``People want that prize.''
   Hundreds of players also traveled from Georgia and Alabama,
which do not have lottery games.
   ``There are times when the parking lot looks just like a
drive-in theater,'' said Donnie Trednick, a regional manager for
Jax Liquors chain. ``Almost everyone's from Georgia. It's just a
big social event.''
   Those who don't want to bet on a string of relatives' birthdays
in their quest for Lotto luck can turn to other sources for their
numbers.
   For Lotto players at Frank Russo's Tampa newsstand, 25 cents can
be put in a machine that coughs up six numbered balls. Russo also
has sold out of 500 Pocket Picks, a $1.89 plastic device attached
to a key chain that dispenses six pellets marked 1 through 49.
   ``People went nuts for them,'' Russo said.
   Personal computer users can buy a program to select numbers
randomly the high-tech way.
   For $25, psychic Madame Ann will pick the digits.
   ``When I concentrate on the numbers for them, I may get one,
two, three or 15,'' she said. ``Unfortunately, I haven't met any
psychic who could pick numbers to benefit themselves. The gift I
have is to help other people with.''
