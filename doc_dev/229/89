<LEADPARA>  IN deep trouble, the California lottery is looking to schools to bail it out.
There's a switch. When the lottery was sold to the voters, the rationale was
that the lottery would bail out the schools.;   Sharon Sharp, the state's new
lottery director, will use $7 million that would go to schools to increase
prizes in the scratch-off games the lottery runs.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The amount is inconsequential. Only the symbolism matters, especially since
Sharp had earlier proposed dipping into the 34 percent cut of lottery revenues
that schools are guaranteed. Immediate and vociferous opposition changed her
mind.;   Lottery sales have dropped precipitously in the recession, evidence
that Californians may be poorer, but they're not dumber. In 1991, lottery
sales might dip below $1.5 billion. In the best of its six years of existence,
the lottery hit $2.6 billion.;   If there is any reason for the state to run a
lottery, it's to raise money for some government purpose, in this case,
education. The debate over whether to give the lottery an advance on its
allowance, in hopes it will use the advance to stimulate sales, thus raising
more money for education, showed how ill-suited a lottery is to be a means of
support for an essential government service.;   The public, mistakenly,
believes the lottery was education's savior. In fact, while a diminishing
number of lottery players scratch off in search of dollars, educators are
scratching around for pennies. It would be better if schools did as many
Californians are doing -- get out of the game.  </TEXT>
