In an effort to attract more gamblers, the state Lottery Commission has 
approved changes in the Lotto game designed to generate significantly larger 
jackpots, while lessening the odds of winning. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also approved the introduction of two more lottery games to be 
called Topper and Decco, which are expected to appeal to players who prefer 
something that will give them a better chance of winning, even if the prizes 
are minuscule by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to provide our players with lots of choices, lots of options in 
picking a game that has the odds they want. We want to be able to provide a 
broad range of games that appeal to all our players," said Carolyn Walker, 
publicity manager for the California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
It is all part of a long-term strategy to get more people to play the lottery 
and keep a steady stream of dollars flowing to the state's education system, 
Walker said. In the 1988-89 state fiscal year, the lottery contributed $1.05 
billion to schools on sales of $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greatest Interest 
</P>
<P>
Walker said officials found the greatest interest in the lottery was generated 
by the big jackpots of $20 million to $30 million, while sales seemed to slump 
when the pot dwindled to $5 million or $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
To create bigger jackpots and cash in on the heightened interest they bring to 
the lottery, the commission has voted to add four more numbers to the field 
that players select from when they buy a Lotto ticket. Beginning in April, for 
each $1 ticket, Lotto players will pick six numbers from a field of 53 instead 
of 49. 
</P>
<P>
With the extra numbers, the odds of winning will change from one in 14 million 
to one in 22 million. The odds of winning any cash prize in the Lotto game will 
go from one in 54 to one in 67. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said officials expect the change in the game to produce more roll-over 
jackpots, or instances when there are no big winners, so that whatever is in 
that day's pot is added to the jackpot for the next drawing. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to maintain the excitement of the Lotto game, we needed to increase 
the field size so we would have more roll-overs," Walker said. "Our sales 
increase very dramatically when we have a very large jackpot." 
</P>
<P>
California has not had a huge jackpot since March when eight winners divided a 
$44.8-million prize. The lottery accumulated its biggest pot in October, 1988, 
when it grew to $62 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lotto game is so popular that well over 50% of the adults in California 
play Lotto on a fairly regular basis," Walker said. "Because of the number of 
players, there were lots of people picking number combinations, so the jackpot 
was being hit frequently, keeping it low. It made our sales a little soft or 
unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free Game 
</P>
<P>
But for those who like a better chance of taking home some cash, the commission 
has created Decco, a new game that will debut in January or February. Players 
will pick a card from each of the four suits in a deck. The lottery computer 
will then also pick a card from each of the suits. 
</P>
<P>
If the player holds the same four picks, he wins $5,000. If he can match three 
of the four, he collects $50. If he matches two of the four, he wins $5. For 
holding one of the four, he gets a free game. His odds of winning top prize in 
the game are one in 28,561. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly different odds will be offered in another new game to be introduced in 
April. Called Topper, the game will piggyback on the Lotto game. After 
purchasing a $1 Lotto ticket, the player will be able to activate Topper for 
another $1. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the game, for each play the computer will automatically pick 
three California cities from a field of 100. At the twice weekly drawings for 
Lotto, there will also be a Topper drawing. Players holding a ticket with all 
three cities picked in the drawing will win $25,000. Those holding two of three 
cities will get $95 and those holding one will collect $2. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of winning $25,000 will be one in 161,700.
