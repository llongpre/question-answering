Jack Kleimeyer didn't seem deterred by the 1-in-14-million odds against his 
winning today's expected $60-million Lotto jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
He bought one ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"I could win as easy with one as 100 (tickets)," the 56-year-old Irvine man 
said. "I'm confident." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that a number of players were confident their picks would win the 
jackpot, which officials say could be a record if ticket sales continue at 
Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Meyers, 23, a clerk at Rolf's Wines &amp; Spirits in Irvine, said that by 2 
p.m. Tuesday, the store had sold 5,720 tickets, more than double the number 
sold the same day last week. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these people will tell you they're playing to support the schools," 
Meyers said. "I don't believe it. It's far from an altruistic society." 
</P>
<P>
At Rolf's, a counter is set aside to sell lottery tickets, and they sold fast 
Tuesday as customers bought five, 10 or 20 tickets at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing since the lottery started," said Robert Lambert, a 
maintenance technician at Pacific Bell. "I'm due, I'm due!" 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales for Sunday and Monday broke records, despite the holiday and 
storms that caused poor road conditions in parts of the state, said Joanne 
McNabb, a spokesman for the California Lottery. "There were a lot of sales 
early Sunday," she said. "We figured they were golfers." 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales Tuesday seemed destined for the record books as well. About 1 
million tickets were sold from 5 to 8 a.m. Tuesday, McNabb said. By 2 p.m., 8 
1/2 million tickets had been sold, well above the average Tuesday sales of 3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Lotto tickets are $1 each. The deadline for buying tickets is 7:45 tonight at 
businesses throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets big like this, it becomes a kind of social event," McNabb said. 
"Everyone's talking about it when you go out to dinner. . . . It's sort of like 
the Super Bowl and the Academy Awards." The previous biggest jackpot was $61.98 
million, drawn Oct. 29, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Webster, a systems analyst from El Toro, bought 10 tickets at 
Albertson's on Campus Drive in Irvine, even though she didn't think she'd win. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't buy . . . then for sure you won't win," she said. "Somebody's 
gotta win."DANICA KIRKA
