Prospective millionaires jammed convenience stores, supermarkets and gas 
stations from Pensacola to Key West Friday in the waning hours of a weeklong 
buying frenzy that has produced a record Florida Lotto jackpot that may yet 
grow into the richest in history. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated payoff: $100 million plus. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of winning: 1 in 13,983,816. 
</P>
<P>
The number of players who don't believe they'll win: 0. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks they're going to win," said Dave Sweezy, director of the Miami 
regional lottery office. "I guess that's human nature. But we are urging 
moderation, reminding them it only takes one." 
</P>
<P>
Try telling that to the lady who flew in from Las Vegas Friday morning and 
bought 1,200 of the $1 tickets. Or the players in Tampa and Pensacola who each 
bought $10,000 worth of tickets. Or Michael Taylor, a 21-year-old University of 
Miami student who Friday afternoon stood in line behind about 30 other hopefuls 
in a Circle K store in Coral Gables. "I already had 10 tickets," he said, "but 
then I thought of some more numbers. And I just had a feeling. So I'm back to 
buy five more." 
</P>
<P>
Despite radio spots from the lottery commission and advice from Florida Gov. 
Bob Martinez to "play responsibly," something akin to gold-rush fever continues 
to rage. "People are coming in with $100, $200, even $300, and they all think 
that, with a little luck, it could be them," said Frank Soler, owner of Frank's 
Discount in Miami. Many are first-time players. Most players normally spend no 
more than $5 or $10 a week on the lottery, he added. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami's Latino neighborhoods, this lottery prize is called "el gordo," the 
fat one. But people from all over the country are seeing it as the chance of a 
lifetime. "I've had calls from every state," said Sweezy, including one from 
California, where a group of investors offered a check for $13.9 million in 
exchange for tickets covering every possible combination. 
</P>
<P>
Sweezy explained that it would take one terminal 63 weeks to print out 13.9 
million tickets. "These people aren't thinking," he added. 
</P>
<P>
So many out-of-state players have been driving into Florida that the lottery 
commission set up an extra 30 terminals along the Georgia and Alabama borders. 
Hundreds of Bahamians have flown into Miami this week to buy thousands of 
tickets, most for illegal resale in the islands, officials admit. 
</P>
<P>
It's been four weeks since anyone has picked the right six numbers in the 
weekly Lotto game, and the prize has ballooned to the highest since the Florida 
lottery was begun in May, 1988. The largest lottery jackpot on record is the 
$115 million awarded earlier this year in Pennsylvania. That mark could be 
topped, officials say, if sales Friday and today, typically the biggest of the 
week, continue at the current pace and if the computers hold up. 
</P>
<P>
At their peak Friday afternoon, the lottery's 7,500 terminals were spitting out 
tickets at the rate of almost 600 per second. 
</P>
<P>
While nothing is expected to slow Florida's Lottomania until sales are cut off 
30 minutes before today's drawing at 11 p.m., one tragic reminder that money 
does not guarantee happiness did surface earlier in the week. The body of a 
35-year-old man was pulled from the Miami River Thursday morning, a week after 
he had claimed $10,000 won in a scratch-off lottery game. He had $2,505 in his 
pocket and an empty wine bottle stuck in the front of his pants, police said. 
The county medical examiner Friday ruled his death an accidental drowning.
