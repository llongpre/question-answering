   Florida's Lotto jackpot reached $100
million Thursday with tickets for Saturday's drawing selling at a
rate of 500 a second.
   Players poured in from other states and countries with dreams of
becoming millionaires, or of making a few bucks selling the $1
tickets at a higher price to those who could not make it to
Florida. The tickets are not sold outside the state.
   Two men from New Orleans, Joe Revolta and Robert Bache, plunked
down $10,000 in cash Wednesday for 10,000 tickets at Groovin'
Noovin's, a Pensacola convenience store near the Alabama-Florida
state line.
   ``It's on our news in Louisiana constantly,'' Revolta said.
``You might not have much of a chance, but you have even less if
you don't play.''
   State lottery officials on Thursday increased the jackpot to
$100 million, the second largest in U.S. history, but said they
doubted it would break the record of $115 million. The expected
jackpot is based on sales and projected sales through Saturday.
   About 30 people flew from Atlanta to Pensacola Regional Airport
early Wednesday, bought tickets at a nearby convenience store and
went home, said Gene Mumtzis of Eagle Travel.
   ``One guy said he goes to California, Ohio and everywhere else
to buy tickets,'' Mumtzis said.
   Richard Cardone, owner of a Pittsburgh beauty salon, bought 50
tickets during an airline stopover in West Palm Beach.
   ``Who wouldn't play?'' asked Cardone. ``You'd be a fool not to.
Everybody's fantasy is to be a multimillionaire.''
   Bahamians carrying thousands of dollars are flying to south
Florida to buy tickets tosell at a higher price back home, the
Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale reported.
   ``They come every Friday. This week they will bring $4,000 to
$5,000,'' said George Prado, who sells lottery tickets at the
Caribe Cafeteria, a Cuban restaurant near Miami International
Airport.
   To play the Florida Lotto game, players select six numbers from
one to 49. The winning numbers are chosen at random during a
weekly, televised drawing.
   The odds of one ticket containing all six winning numbers are
about one-in-14 million. But for every dollar spent, there was a
dream.
   ``First, I would help the church in any way I could, then I
would buy a ticket to fly to the moon,'' said Anne Straub, 66, of
Gulf Breeze. ``I've just always wanted to go into space.''
   On Thursday, tickets sold at a rate of 500 a second, said
Florida Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul.
   The highest sales were reported along the state's lines with
Georgia and Alabama, she said.
   Results of Saturday night's drawing would be announced Sunday,
although the final size of the jackpot would not be determined
until Monday, she said.
   The record jackpot of $115 million was split among 14 winning
tickets in Pennsylvania's Super 7 game in April 1989.
   Florida's previous record Lotto prize was a $58 million jackpot
split between five winners in April. Each winning ticket was worth
nearly $11.7 million, to be paid out over 20 years.
   Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs holds the world record for a
prize to a single winner of a computerized numbers game. She won a
$55.1 million Florida Lotto jackpot in September 1988.
   In Florida, 50 percent of each dollar spent on the lottery is
returned in prizes, 38 percent goes to the state's schools system
and the rest is split between retailers and the lottery department.
