America West Airlines, the nation's 10th largest air carrier, will begin 
passenger flights from Palmdale Air Terminal early next year, giving Antelope 
Valley-area residents renewed access to nationwide air service, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Phoenix-based carrier, which is targeting an early January 
start-up for its flights, means that the Antelope Valley will have passenger 
air service for the first time since another carrier ceased service in 1985, 
airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The flights will connect Palmdale with Las Vegas, one of America West's two hub 
cities (the other hub is Phoenix). From Las Vegas, the airline flies to about 
50 cities in the United States and western Canada, including New York, Chicago 
and the Baltimore-Washington area.

<P>
Daphne Dicino, a spokeswoman for the 6-year-old airline, said the number of 
daily flights, ticket prices and schedules may not be announced for a month or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
In early August, airline officials said they were studying four daily flights 
out of Palmdale to Las Vegas using 37-seat de Havilland Dash 8 turboprop 
planes. Dicino said the starting date for service depends partly on how soon 
the airline obtains two new planes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely committed to serving Palmdale," she said, adding that 
airline officials believe that the fast-growing area "has a tremendous growth 
potential." 
</P>
<P>
The airline will operate out of the now-unused Palmdale Air Terminal. The 
9,000-square-foot facility was opened by the Los Angeles Department of Airports 
in 1971 and used for limited commercial flights over the years. But airport 
officials said it has been vacant since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Clifton Moore, executive director of the airports department, predicted that 
Palmdale service will be successful because it will offer northern Los Angeles 
County residents a closer alternative than Los Angeles International Airport.
