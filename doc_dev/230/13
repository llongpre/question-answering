PALMDALE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of the Board of Airport Commissioners and the Department of Airports 
staff, I want to congratulate The Times for its editorial "An Airport Ready to 
Take Off" (Dec. 18). 
</P>
<P>
We are most excited about the introduction of commercial service at the 
Palmdale Regional Airport. The Palmdale facility is vital to the future of air 
transportation in Southern California. Given the ground congestion around LAX, 
residents of the San Fernando Valley and the Antelope and Santa Clarita Valleys 
and Ventura County will find it easier and less expensive (because of free 
parking) in the years to come to fly from Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale will realize its potential only if the federal and state governments 
help us build mass transit to link the airport to other airports and population 
centers throughout Southern California. I, for one, am at a loss when I hear 
that the only route for the proposed Las Vegas-to-Anaheim "bullet train" must 
be a direct line from Las Vegas to Victorville to Anaheim. If this "bullet 
train" is to be subsidized by the taxpayers of California, by virtue of the 
grants of rights-of-way through federal and state land, then I submit that the 
train route ought to become an integral part of a network of light-rail lines 
planned with the long-term interests of all of Southern California in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Los Angeles Airport Commission is anxious to do its part to help 
create the light-rail links essential to the future economic development of the 
Los Angeles Basin. Working with other airport organizations around the nation, 
we are lobbying Congress for permission to assess a Passenger Facility Charge 
similar to those imposed by airports throughout Europe and Asia. A modest 
charge could generate sufficient revenue for necessary airport-related 
infrastructure, including a light-rail link to Palmdale.
