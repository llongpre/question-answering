   A partnership made a formal bid Monday on a $5
billion high-speed train system that would whisk riders from
Southern California to the casinos of the Strip in little more than
an hour.
   The partnership headed by Bechtel International Inc. of San
Francisco proposed the first commercial use of magnetically
levitated trains that would run up to 300 mph on an about 270-mile
line between Las Vegas and Anaheim.
   The bid for exclusive franchise rights was hailed as a milestone
for the project, which was first proposed in 1979.
   ``We feel we are about to revolutionize ground transportation in
the United States,'' said Arnie Adamsen, chairman of the
California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission. ``We believe we
have overcome the last true hurdle in bringing this system into
being.''
   Bechtel officials gave the commission a $500,000 deposit along
with a three-inch-thick proposal that calls for a two-way train
that would glide atop an elevated guideway running alongside
existing highways between the two metropolitan areas.
   The train could have commuter stops in Southern California, and
Bechtel proposed possible spurs that could also eventually link the
system to Palmdale, Palm Springs, Riverside and Santa Ana.
   If Bechtel gets financing and overcomes other obstacles,
construction would begin in 1993, with the system up and running
four years later.
   ``We see this as a pilot system that will be the first part of a
network that will eventually encompass the Southwest and the
nation,'' said Erv Koenig, a Bechtel vice president.
   The train would follow Interstate 15 from Las Vegas to Southern
California, where it would run alongside the Santa Ana River
Channel into a final destination at Anaheim Stadium south of Los
Angeles.
   But the project faces enormous hurdles, including its huge price
tag and uncertainty over whether it would attract enough riders to
be profitable. Since the mid-1980s, the estimated cost of the
project has risen from $2.5 billion to $5.1 billion.
   Bechtel is gambling not only that it can raise the huge amount
of money needed to privately finance the system, but also on the
use of maglev technology.
   The maglev system, which uses a magnetic field to propel the
train and to elevate it one to four inches above the guideway, is
being tested in West Germany but has not entered commercial use.
   Before deciding whether to actually build the train, Bechtel
plans to spend about 16 months on ridership studies.
   A ridership survey done for the commission said an Anaheim to
Las Vegas run would get a 6.5 million round trip passengers a year
paying $110 a ticket.
   The idea of a speedy train linking Las Vegas with the Southern
California market that provides most of it 18 million tourists each
year was first raised in 1979 by then-Mayor Bill Briare.
   The train commission was established in 1988, after a study
showed the project was feasible.
