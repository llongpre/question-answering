Back in June, 1971, when the first commercial flight took off from the new 
airport in Palmdale, Joan Lewallen was there to snare the first ticket of the 
day. She saved it as a souvenir of what she thought was an auspicious beginning 
for an airport with a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
It was a future that never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
After 18 years of waiting, Lewallen was back at Palmdale Regional Airport again 
early Tuesday to once again snare the first ticket of the day, this time for a 
trip to Las Vegas. And once again, she had no intention of making the trip. But 
that wasn't what mattered. 
</P>
<P>
The little-known airport returned to life Tuesday with its first commercial 
passenger flight in five years. The flight not only marked the return of daily 
air service to the area but boosted residents' ardent hopes for the growth of 
the airport and their community. 
</P>
<P>
Souvenir hounds, aviation fans, a flock of real estate brokers and others 
boarded a 37-seat Boeing de Havilland Dash 8 turboprop Tuesday morning, making 
them the first passengers out of Palmdale on America West Airlines' new service 
to Las Vegas. The airline, the nation's 10th largest, plans four daily 
round-trips. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is an excellent day for this area. This is just marvelous," said 
Lewallen, who celebrated the start-up with about 50 others at the terminal. The 
60-year-old Palmdale resident stayed behind, though, preferring to save her $79 
one-way ticket as another souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
America West Flight 1017 took off at 11:05 a.m., 10 minutes behind schedule and 
carrying 30 passengers. After a relatively smooth flight of 47 minutes, the 
twin-engine airplane touched down in Las Vegas at 11:52 a.m., eight minutes 
ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Palmdale airport offered commercial service from 1971 to 1985, it 
never became well established and when the last carrier ceased operations 
there, the airport fell into disuse. It was a letdown for Los Angeles airport 
officials, who envisioned Palmdale as an alternative to the city's busy 
international airport. 
</P>
<P>
America West's decision to start service out of Palmdale had area residents and 
airport officials predicting Tuesday that the airport now is destined to expand 
with the surrounding Antelope Valley, one of the fastest-growing areas in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just the beginning of things to come," said Bob Van Dyke, a 
Quartz Hill resident who was on the first flight. "We see it as a coming-of-age 
for the area." 
</P>
<P>
The initial flight got rave reviews from passengers who praised the convenience 
of the terminal for its free parking and lack of congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is terrific. I've been waiting for service to come out of Palmdale for 
years," said passenger Dale Harrison, an engineer with Rockwell International 
Corp. He predicted that many people involved in the region's booming aerospace 
industry will opt for Palmdale over Los Angeles International and Burbank 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
Among the passengers Tuesday was Ron Rafferty, an aircraft mechanic and Mojave 
resident. Rafferty was accompanying his wife, Beverly, to Travis Air Force 
Base, where she was scheduled to have surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"To go to LAX is a real . . . " Rafferty said, trailing off. "It's hard to get 
in and out of there. They needed something like this up here." 
</P>
<P>
Woody Weber, America West's new station manager in Palmdale, said the airline 
is committed to staying in Palmdale, even though routine flights out may be 
only one-quarter full until the service becomes better-known. But he predicted 
that higher passenger volumes would come within three to six months.
