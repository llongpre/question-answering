LAS VEGAS AIRLINE PLANS FLIGHTS FROM PALOMAR AIRPORT TO LAX

A Las Vegas-based airline has applied to San Diego County for approval to begin 
four nonstop daily commuter flights between Palomar Airport in Carlsbad and Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
There is now no air service from North County to Los Angeles, and Grand 
Airways' application to inaugurate flights comes two months after the previous 
applicant, Resort Commuter Airlines of Orange County, filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Warner, marketing assistant for Grand Airways, said Monday that 
"everything has been applied for" to operate nine-passenger, twin-propeller 
aircraft from Palomar, starting March 1. Although a fare hasn't been set, she 
estimated each 45-minute, one-way flight will cost $49. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a great deal of marketing research" before selecting Palomar Airport, 
she said. "It was one of the points that could be utilized because people are 
darn tired of driving" to jobs in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Since the airport opened in 1960, seven efforts to either begin or sustain 
commuter service have failed. Most recently, Resort Commuter contracted with 
Pan American World Airways to operate six flights daily from Carlsbad, but 
filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy Nov. 17 before service could begin. 
</P>
<P>
Warner said Grand Airways is seeking approval for six daily flights, but will 
begin with four trips using smaller aircraft until the public's interest is 
known. "If the response is wonderful, we'll put in as many (flights) as the 
market demands and the community needs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of Palomar Airport have insisted that Resort Commuter use quieter, 
propeller-driven aircraft as a condition for approval. Warner said Grand 
Airways would use either the Cessna 402 or Piper aircraft, which are smaller 
than the 19-passenger models Resort had planned to use. 
</P>
<P>
"We fly props," said Warner. "We're not going into jets or larger aircraft 
until we see whether the market warrants it." 
</P>
<P>
She said Grand Airways started in 1980, has 35 employees, a fleet of 14 
aircraft and runs charter flights from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon. "We are 
in an expansion program" that not only includes possible Carlsbad-Los Angeles 
service, but also commuter flights from Ontario, China Lake, Apple Valley and 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Airways' application goes before the Palomar Airport Advisory Committee, 
which will make a recommendation to the county Board of Supervisors. County 
offices were closed Monday, so neither county airport director Al Newman nor 
Palomar Airport manager Rick Severson could be reached for comment.
