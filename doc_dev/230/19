   The Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon, an
entertainment fixture here for 17 years, will move to Los Angeles
this year, officials of the Muscular Dystrophy Association said
Wednesday.
   ``It's really a matter of economics,'' Jerry Weinberg, director
of field organization for the MDA, said in a telephone interview
from the association's New York City headquarters. ``We've always
brought most of the talent in from Los Angeles and there was a cost
involved. It was much more cost-effective to move to Los Angeles.''
   In recent years there had been ``less and less talent in Las
Vegas that we could tap into,'' Weinberg said.
   The telethon has raised more than a half-billion dollars during
its Las Vegas run, including a record $42,209,727 in September.
   ``We really feel sort of sad to be leaving Las Vegas,'' said Bob
Ross, MDA executive director and vice president. He said the city
that helped make the telethon a Labor Day entertainment event will
continue to play ``a very important part'' in the show, with some
remote broadcasts planned from Las Vegas.
   Ross said MDA officials met several weeks ago with Lewis, a
longtime Las Vegas resident, ``and he understood the rationale.''
   Lewis, 63, did not immediately return calls made to both his
home and office for comment on the move.
   Mayor Ron Lurie and other city officials were at a city council
meeting and not immediately available for comment, the mayor's
secretary said.
   Frank Sain, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and
Visitors Authority, said the move came as a surprise but he didn't
think it would hurt the city. ``It gave us the dateline, but it
didn't pull any people into Las Vegas,'' he said.
   The Lewis telethon began in New York City in 1966, emanating
from a single TV station and raising $1 million. It moved to Las
Vegas in 1973 and raised $13.5 million that year.
   The telethon is now carried by 200 stations and is viewed
annually by an estimated 100 million people. The MDA fights 40
neuromuscular diseases that kill and cripple thousands of people
annually, most of them young people.
