Los Angeles County on Wednesday sweetened its offer in the competition with 
Anaheim to become the Southern California terminus of a futuristic high-speed 
rail system to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
To raise the chances of a northern San Fernando Valley terminus, the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission voted Wednesday to study speeding up 
construction of a light-rail line linking Los Angeles International Airport to 
Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials said that link would significantly increase 
ridership on a Sylmar-to-Las Vegas line because it would tie the high-speed 
system to the county's network of rail lines, three of which are under 
construction, with several more in the planning stage. 
</P>
<P>
The rival terminal station site is in Anaheim and is supported by officials 
from Orange and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
Ridership on the high-speed train has emerged as a key issue following release 
of a consultant's report two weeks ago that said an Anaheim-to-Las Vegas line, 
also stopping in Ontario, would draw 6.5 million round-trip passengers 
annually. A Sylmar-to-Las Vegas line, also stopping in Palmdale, would generate 
only 2.3 million round trips a year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
However, a separate commuter system operating on the same tracks would draw 
nearly equal numbers of riders -- 433,000 round trips a year between Anaheim 
and Ontario versus 418,000 annually between Palmdale and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
The California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Commission, created by 
the two states' legislatures, is to vote Friday on a Southern California 
terminus. 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who heads the bistate commission, 
suggested late Wednesday that both Sylmar and Anaheim might survive Friday's 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that it was "conceivable the bistate commission might designate 
Anaheim as the terminus but leave open the possibility of getting there through 
Palmdale and LAX" by traveling through the San Fernando Valley and Westside on 
the San Diego Freeway right of way. 
</P>
<P>
Katz, who also chairs the Assembly Transportation Commission, agreed that the 
16-member bistate commission is leaning toward Anaheim but said "the final 
decision rests with the California Legislature, not the bistate commission." 
</P>
<P>
Although the $4-billion system would be built with private funds, legislative 
approval is needed because the trains would travel along the shoulder of 
interstate highways. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Transportation Commission vote to authorize $225,000 to study the 
LAX-to-Sylmar rail line, which hitherto was not scheduled to be built for a 
decade or more, Ray Remy, who represents Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on the 
commission, expressed confidence that Los Angeles' bid for the high-speed line 
would not be voted down Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope and expect that what we will see is a decision to conduct further study 
on both proposals, especially in light of action taken here today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles International Airport is close to capacity and "must be relieved or 
we will face real serious problems," said Los Angeles City Council President 
John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
In another development Wednesday, Palmdale officials released a report that 
conceded that a high-speed train passing through their desert city en route 
between Sylmar and Las Vegas would not generate the ridership of a route 
originating in Anaheim but said that the Sylmar line would be 45% less 
expensive to build. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a line traveling through Palmdale would have fewer environmental problems 
and could be built in less time than one traveling through San Bernardino and 
Orange counties, according to the report, which the city commissioned. 
</P>
<P>
The report projected 3.76 million round-trip riders annually on a Sylmar-to-Las 
Vegas line, about 50% higher than the bistate commission's consultant 
projected, but still much less than the predicted Anaheim ridership.
