   A decade after a high-speed train linking this
gaming community and Southern California was first proposed, a
partnership today plunked down $500,000 along with the first formal
bid on the $5 billion project.
   Bechtel International Inc. of San Francisco and Transrapid of
West Germany are expected to be the only bidders for the right to
build a train that would cruise up to 300 mph on elevated track
running alongside interstate highways between Las Vegas and
Anaheim, Calif. The bidding deadline is later today.
   Company officials presented the California-Nevada Super Speed
Train Commission with a 3-inc-thick proposal detailing the 272-mile
route.
   ``We feel we are about to revolutionize ground transportation in
the United States,'' said Arnie Adamsen, a Las Vegas city
councilman and chairman of the commission.
   Bechtel Vice President Erv Koenig told the group that the
proposed high-tech train, using magnetic force to propel the
trains, will be ``a pilot system that will be the first part of a
network that will eventually encompass the southwest and the
nation.''
   Once opposed by many alifornia officials as a ``gambler's
special'' of little benefit to the Los Angeles area, the train is
seen now by some as the possible beginning of a mass transit system
that could link large portions of Southern California.
   But even its strongest backers are not buying tickets quite yet.
   The proposed train faces enormous hurdles, not the least of
which is its massive price tag and the uncertainty it would attract
enough riders to be profitable. The earliest it could be in
operation is the late 1990s.
   Bechtel officials themselves say they will need to study the
project at least another 16 months before deciding whether to
proceed.
   ``A lot depends on what we find in our own feasibility study,''
Koenig said last week. ``All we're working on now is the existing
data, and we have to go out and confirm or deny that data.''
   The proposed service would whisk passengers between the two
cities in little more than an hour. It now takes five hours by car.
   ``I think it has a three-out-of-four chance of succeeding,''
said Paul Taylor, executive director of the train commission. ``But
anything like this has potential for environmental delay which
could foul up the financing.''
   Koenig said Bechtel is taking a cautious approach to the project
by applying for the franchise so it can do its own ridership
surveys and other studies before deciding whether to go futher.
   ``We're famous for doing large projects,'' said Koenig, citing
the BART mass transit system in San Francico. ``But a project of
this magnitude, you have to take one step at a time.''
   A ridership survey done earlier by a consulting firm for the
commission suggested that an Anaheim to Las Vegas run would get 6.5
million round trip passengers a year at a cost of about $110.
   As projected by Bechtel, the train would also provide several
Southern California stops for commuters, and could later be
expanded to link other California communities.
   Aside from financing, Bechtel also faces major obstacles in its
plan to use trains powered by magnetic levitation. Maglev trains
float one to four inches above a single guideway, lifted and
propelled along by a wave of magnetic energy.
   The only maglev train in existence is in Emsland, West Germany,
where Transrapid's prototype glides along a 20-mile test track at
speeds of about 250 mph.
   Members of the bistate rail commission were impressed by the
train during a visit to Germany in March, but questioned whether
the technology was in place to build such an ambitious project.
   ``I've tried to ride the maglev three times now and I've never
been on the entire track because it wasn't certified for
operation,'' said California state Sen. Bill Leonard. ``I need a
better level of confidence that it can be done.''
   The idea of a speedy train linking Las Vegas with the lucrative
Southern California market that provides the bulk of the 18 million
tourists who visit each year was first raised in 1979 by then-Mayor
Bill Briare.
   It wasn't until 1988, however, after a federally funded study
showed the project was feasible, that the bistate train commission
was established.
   Since the train project received its first serious studies in
the mid-1980s, the projected price tag has doubled from an
estimated $2.5 billion to Bechtel's current estimate of $5.1
billion.
