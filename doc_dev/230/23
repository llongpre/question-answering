   It's been 40 years since Kirk Kerkorian
refurbished a small twin-engine airplane and began shuttling
passengers between a Los Angeles suburb and the fledgling gaming
resort of Las Vegas.
   In the years since then, the shy son of Armenian immigrants has
built a billion-dollar business empire while forging grand designs
in the desert.
   Now he's embarking on his grandest yet _ an entertainment theme
park and his third shot at building the world's largest hotel.
   Kerkorian's announcement Tuesday of plans to build the $700
million project on the Las Vegas Strip is a case of promises kept.
   ``I'll be back,'' Kerkot the eight largest hotels in the world _ three
of them with the Kerkorian imprint.
   Kerkorian said Tuesday his MGM Grand Inc., will build the hotel
on a prime Strip corner now occupied by the Marina Hotel and Casino
and the Tropicana Country Club.
   ``I used the word `bullish' many years ago in talking about Las
Vegas,'' Kerkorian said. ``I'm still bullish on the city.''
   The 115-acre theme park, still in its conceptual and design
stage, will be a family attraction aimed at drawing middle-class
tourists when it opens sometime in late 1992.
   MGM Grand chairman Fred Benninger said his company is confident
the park will cash in on the trend toward family tourism in a town
once dominated by high-rolling gamblers.
   ``I remember the days when Las Vegas lived almost entirely on
the high roller,'' Benninger said Tuesday. ``You can't do that
anymore.''
   Kerkorian's company built the International Hotel, now the Las
Vegas Hilton, and later built the MGM Grand Hotel, now Bally's.
   The International had 1,500 rooms when it opened in 1967 as the
biggest resort in Las Vegas and the MGM surpassed that with 2,100
rooms when it was built in 1973.
   The Las Vegas Hilton now has 3,174 rooms and is the world's
largest hotel. That mark will be broken when the 4,032-room
Excalibur opens next June, across the Strip from Kerkorian's new
site.
   The Hilton's sister property, the Flamingo Hilton, will have
3,600 rooms when an expansion is completed next year. Kerkorian
once owned the Flamingo as well. And he owned the land on which
Caesars Palace was built.
   Kerkorian is expected to spend about $250 million on the new
hotel and $450 million on the theme park, which will include
facilities for film making.
   Some have compared Kerkorian with Howard Hughes, the reclusive
billionaire who once owned nine Nevada hotel casinos and whose
Summa Corp. still has vast real estate holdings in the Las Vegas
Valley. Both men had a penchant for the movie industry, gaming,
flying, Nevada, airlines _ and privacy.
   Kerkorian, the son of poor Armenian fruit farmers in Fresno,
Calif., dropped out of high school to help support his parents and
three brothers. He once attributed his business acumen to growing
up during the Depression years.
   ``I didn't have any really big motivation in my life,'' he once
said. ``First it was simply trying to earn enough to get something
to eat, then enough to buy a car.''
   In the late 1940s he refurbished a small plane and began
carrying gamblers, sightseers and wedding couples from the
Hawthorne, Calif. airport to Las Vegas.
   In 1947 he formed his own airline, Los Angeles Air Service,
which he later changed to Trans International Airlines. He sold the
airline to TransAmerica Corp. in 1968 in a deal that netted him
$104 million.
   By then he was in the hotel business in Las Vegas, the city that
``has always been on the plus side for us.''
   Today, Kerkorian's MGM Grand Inc., a separate company from his
MGM-UA Communications Corp., owns an all-frills Los Angeles-New
York airline as well as the Desert Inn. It also retains rights to a
stylized version of the famous MGM lion logo.
   Kerkorian, 72, had sold and bought back pieces of MGM-UA
Communications for two decades, a period during which he also
traded Las Vegas hotels the way most people buy cars.
   Last month, Australia's Qintex Group agreed to purchase MGM-UA _
including the original lion logo _ for $1.5 billion.
   Kerkorian continues to shun the spotlight and is reluctant to
talk about his business success.
   ``I'm just a small town boy who got lucky,'' he says.
