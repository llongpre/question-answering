<LEADPARA>  Plans by a group of California and Nevada officials for the world's first
long-distance, high-speed magnetic levitation rail line between Las Vegas and
Anaheim now face so many obstacles it may never be built.;    It has long been
clear that promoters would have to lobby hard for changes in several state and
federal laws to facilitate the project, which also could eventually serve Los
Angeles International Airport. Some California transportation authorities
think that resources ought to be committed instead to north-south high-speed
lines between Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But the major problem appears to be financing for the $5 billion project.; 
  An official of the Bechtel Corp. -- which was awarded a conditional
franchise last summer to build the Las Vegas-Anaheim line -- recently
acknowledged that construction hinges on the sale of tax-exempt bonds to
private investors. Not only would Congress have to act to make the
German-engineered train eligible for such bonds, but the amount needed far
exceeds the annual limit on private-purpose, tax-exempt bonds that can be
issued by California and Nevada.;    Mary Kittleson, executive director of the
California Debt Limit Allocation Committee, said that the state will be
allowed this year to issue slightly less than $1.5 billion in such bonds, and
85 percent of that is tentatively reserved for housing projects.  </TEXT>
