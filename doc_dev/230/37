   The wreckage of a plane believed to be
carrying 10 people from Las Vegas was found today in the mountains,
along with at least nine bodies, authorities said.
   The private, twin-engine plane, which reportedly carried a family
en route to Disneyland, crashed Sunday near the top of a brushy
ridge in the Santa Ana Mountains southeast of Los Angeles. It
appeared the aircraft had nearly cleared the ridgetop at about the
2,200-foot level at the time of the crash.
   Bob Tur, a reporter from radio station KNX-AM, said it looked
like the plane crashed with ``tremendous force,'' strewing debris
across a 100-yard area. It was Tur who first spotted the wreckage
while flying over the area in a helicopter.
   The Cessna 402 left Las Vegas at 11 a.m. Sunday and was due at
Orange County John Wayne Airport at 12:30 p.m., said Civil Air
Patrol Lt. Col. Ed Crankshaw. Air traffic controllers received no
distess calls from the plane.
   Riverside County sheriff's Lt. John Gillis said at least nine
bodies had been found by 40 searchers flown in by helicopter to the
scene.
   The plane's fuselage was twisted, broken into several pieces and
partly buried, Tur said, adding, ``the bodies and baggage were
ripped apart and scattered over the peak.''
   Federal Aviation Administration duty officer Rich Tornquist said
the pilot noted in a flight plan that there were 10 people, but he
cautioned that did not mean all had boarded.
   The identities of the people believed aboard the plane were
withheld pending notification of relatives, but all were reported to
be from Las Vegas, officials said.
   In Las Vegas, a spokesman for the Mormon Church, Don Christensen,
said Meto Police officer Mike Cranson, his wife and their two sons
and three daughters boarded a chartered flight in Las Vegas on
Sunday morning for a trip to Disneyland.
   ``We understand the plane never arrived,'' Christensen said.
Cranson was president of a church men's group and had been active in
youth work and scouting, he said.
   Reached at the family home, Sandra Mattson, Cranson's sister,
said the family was still awaiting word. ``We haven't heard
anything,'' she said, her voice breaking. ``We're hoping to know
something more in an hour.''
   At Las Vegas Flyers, the charter outfit that provided the plane,
employee Doug Mueller refused any comment today except to say the
company had been in business for 20 years.
   Four Civil Air Patrol ground teams searched through the night
near 4,000-foot Pleasants Peak in the Santa Anas on the
Orange-Riverside county line because the plane disappeared from
radar at about 2,100 feet near the peak, CAP Lt. Harriet Aceves said
today.
   The FAA checked local airports to see if the plane, painted white
with red and yellow trim, had landed elsewhere, but it was not
found, said Tornquist.
   Controllers talked to the pilot shortly after noon as the plane
was inbound to Orange County but there was no subsequent emergency
declaration from the pilot, officials said.
   The site of the crash is in the Cleveland National Forest, 45
miles southeast of Los Angeles and 20 miles northeast of the Orange
County airport.
