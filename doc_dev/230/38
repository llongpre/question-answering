DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ISRAELI SUSPECT HELD IN TARZANA MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Aman wanted for a Tarzana murder and a Las Vegas casino robbery and attempted 
murder was in custody in New York City following his weekend arrest at the 
Israeli Consulate, Los Angeles police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
David Hagag, 29, was charged Monday with the Dec. 27 killing of Simon 
Sarkissian, 54, of Tarzana, Detective Rick Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Hagag killed Sarkissian, a heroin dealer, during a robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Hagag, an Israeli who came to this country nine months ago, is also wanted by 
Las Vegas police as a suspect in a Dec. 8 robbery at the Hilton Hotel casino in 
which a gunman grabbed $15,000 from a change booth, fled the casino and shot 
and slightly wounded a cab driver who was forced to help him escape, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Los Angeles and San Francisco, where a car belonging to Hagag was 
found last week, alerted officials at the Israeli Consulate in New York to 
watch for Hagag. The suspect came to the consulate in Manhattan on Saturday 
afternoon and attempted to obtain a passport under a false name, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Consulate officials, to whom police had sent a photo of Hagag, recognized the 
suspect and called New York police after asking Hagag to wait for the passport 
in an interview room. When the suspect saw police enter the consulate, he 
attempted to commit suicide by slashing his wrists with a sharp piece of 
plastic, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hagag was not seriously injured and was being held in a New York jail 
without bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said authorities had not yet decided whether Hagag will be extradited 
first to Las Vegas or Los Angeles.
