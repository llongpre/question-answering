   After 17 years in Las Vegas, the Jerry Lewis
Labor Day Telethon will try to shake its lounge lizard image this
weekend, moving to Hollywood in search of trendier acts, lower
costs and a fresher look.
   The 21{-hour long Muscular Dystrophy Association fund-raiser
celebrates its 25th anniversary from the Star Search Theater on
Sunset Boulevard, where Ed McMahon presents his glitzy talent show.
   The nationwide broadcast begins at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday and ends
6:30 p.m. Monday.
   Among the scheduled entertainers are such youth-oriented acts as
rapper M.C. Hammer, Tony! Toni! Tone!, En Vogue, cast members from
``The Young Riders,'' Fred Savage of the ``The Wonder Years'' and
Bob Saget of ``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   Behind the scenes, Lewis no longer acts as one of the producers
and will serve only as a host. Producer George Schlatter (``Real
People'' and ``Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in'') takes sole producer
credit.
   The MDA announced in January that Schlatter would be the
executive producer for the show. Lewis later said the telethon had
used five other producers over the years and he welcomed
Schlatter's involvement.
   ``I just couldn't work that hard and keep going,'' said Lewis,
64. ``Come air time, I would be so exhausted, it was hard to
continue at that pace.''
   But the show hasn't entirely abandoned tradition. Bill Cosby
will appear in a remote feed from Las Vegas, and the program still
will have such telethon fixtures as Lewis, McMahon, Norm Crosby and
Top 40 radio countdown king Casey Kasem.
   And, Schlatter says, Lewis will probably once again sing
``You'll Never Walk Alone'' to close the show.
   ``I'm not looking to redo the whole thing,'' Schlatter said
Tuesday. ``It's been too successful for too long. We're celebrating
the accomplishments of the last 25 years and kind of renewing the
dedication to moving it into the '90s.''
   Over the years, the telethon has raised more than half a billion
dollars to fight neuromuscular diseases that kill and cripple
thousand of people annually, most of them young.
   The Las Vegas shows were always successful in terms of pledges,
with last year's tally a record $42.2 million. But even as pledges
went up, viewership went down. From 1985 to 1989, the show drew
increasingly smaller audiences.
   In addition, it was becoming increasingly more expensive to
produce the telethon from there.
   The accommodations had to be converted into television studios,
and entertainers and crew members were flown in, usually from Los
Angeles, said telethon spokeswman Jim Brown.
   ``We don't know how much we'll save this year because we're
right in the middle of it all,'' he said. ``But we hope to save
something.''
   In moving to Los Angeles, the telethon can use a working
television studio and can tap a ready supply of talent, much of it
the stars of choice for younger viewers.
   Among the newer groups on the bill, Tony! Toni! Tone! has been
hot on the charts this summer with its single ``Feels Good'' and En
Vogue's single ``Hold On,'' has gone platinum. M.C. Hammer's album
``Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em'' is credited with selling over 5
million copies, more than any other rap album.
   One drawback might be a shortage of walk-in fans: In Las Vegas,
telethon coordinators could round up willing audience members at
any hour because the gambling casinos are open round-the-clock.
Finding charity-minded fans at 3 a.m. on Hollywood's Sunset
Boulevard could prove more problematic.
   The Jerry Lewis telethon began in New York City in 1966,
emanating from a single TV station and raising $1 million. It moved
to Las Vegas in 1973 and raised $13.5 million that year.
   The telethon now is carried by 200 stations and is viewed
annually by an estimated 100 million people.
   While Jerry Lewis does his shtick in Los Angeles this weekend,
Jerry Lee Lewis is twisting and shouting in a rock benefit for
muscular dystrophy in San Bernardino. The three days of rock music
of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, which began Saturday, features
performers such as Lewis, the Commodores, Fats Domino and Eddie
Rabbitt.
