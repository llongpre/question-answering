A former Orange County bank president and two alleged associates of a Los 
Angeles organized crime family have been indicted by a federal grand jury for 
wire fraud and conspiracy, the U.S. attorney's office announced Wednesday in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments, which stemmed from two separate investigations, were issued in 
October, 1987. But they were kept under seal until Aug. 24 and not disclosed 
until Wednesday because of another investigation that was recently concluded, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Indicted in the first case Wednesday were Roger McGinnis, 52, of Orange, former 
President of Far Western Bank in Tustin, and Morton Goodman, 53, of West Hills, 
an alleged Los Angeles organized crime family associate, according to the 
announcement by U.S. Atty. Gary A. Feess. 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis was charged with 18 counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy 
to commit wire fraud. He is scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 5 in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that McGinnis, while president of Far Western in 1984, 
supplied casinos in Las Vegas with fraudulent credit information, allowing 
Goodman and his associates to obtain large credit lines for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman is being held on $250,000 bail pending his arraignment in Los Angeles, 
also scheduled for Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement follows a lengthy investigation and other indictments. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, John DeMattia, 52, a reputed mob associate of Goodman, pleaded 
guilty to wire fraud in the alleged scheme to arrange for gambling credit at 
the Las Vegas casinos by inflating bank account records at Far Western. At the 
time, prosecutors said DeMattia had the help of an unnamed bank official. 
</P>
<P>
Former federal prosecutor Richard Stavin said last April that Far Western 
provided financial references for clients of several casinos, including the Las 
Vegas Hilton, the MGM Grand and the Desert Inn and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
DeMattia also pleaded guilty in April, 1988, to extortion in another case 
involving several organized crime figures in Los Angeles. He is still serving 
his three-year sentence in Lompoc federal prison, according to Steve Nielsen, 
one of the two Los Angeles Police Department organized crime investigators who 
worked on the case. 
</P>
<P>
William A. Dougherty, a Villa Park attorney representing McGinnis, said he was 
surprised by Wednesday's announcement. "The matter has been pending for over 
five years" he said. "We've cooperated, given hand-writing samples. All of a 
sudden we get an unsealed indictment. We're planning to plead not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty also asserted that all the bank accounts that McGinnis had vouched 
for "were good. They didn't put kited checks in the account." McGinnis faces a 
maximum of 100 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Goodman nor his attorney could be reached for comment. Goodman faces a 
maximum of 25 years if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis is no longer with Far Western. The institution is a small bank with an 
unusual niche in the industry. After McGinnis left, the bank grew 17-fold 
between 1986 and 1988 by purchasing auto loans made by dealers. 
</P>
<P>
In the second indictment announced Wednesday, stemming from a separate 
investigation, Feess said that Rocco Toce, 46, of Marina del Rey, also an 
alleged associate in Los Angeles organized crime, was arrested by the Los 
Angeles Police Department on Aug. 24 after being charged in a federal 
indictment with making false statements on a loan application and with 
conspiracy. This case also stems from a 1987 sealed indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The charges involve activities at Sunwest Bank in Tustin, where Donald 
Hinrichsen, a former bank vice president, allegedly accepted bribes in return 
for granting unsecured loans to several reputed mob figures, including DeMattia 
and Toce. A trial has been scheduled for Oct. 31.
