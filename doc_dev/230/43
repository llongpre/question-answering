   Mayor Pete Sferrazza says life in this 24-hour
city where divorces are easy and slot machines clang in both
casinos and supermarkets isn't as stressful as one researcher
claims.
   In fact, the twice-divorced and three-times married (twice to
the same woman) mayor says the high suicide, divorce, crime and
alcoholism rates that led to the title ``may be a measure of
release of stress.''
   ``I don't think it's an accurate picture of what life is like in
Reno,'' Sferrazza said of the ranking reported in Psychology Today.
``Living here, I know we have a small-town environment, and I know
it's far less stressful.''
   California psychologist Robert Levine reported in the November
issue of Psychology Today that Reno was the nation's most stressful
city and Las Vegas was right behind it, compared to 284 other
cities in the nation.
   Nevada Gov. Richard Bryan, who was born in Las Vegas, replied,
without a bit of stress in his voice, ``folks who reach that
conclusion need some counseling themselves.''
   ``People vote with their feet and tens of thousands of people
have moved to Nevada because of its beauty and many recreational
opportunities,'' he said.
   Levine counters: ``Moving to a new area often appeals to people
who are having trouble in their lives ... so they move to a place
where conditions are most attractive, bringing their pathology with
them and driving up the rates of divorce, suicide, alcoholism and
crime.''
   Pathology!
   ``That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard,'' said Tara
Hartsoch, who works in the promotions department of Harrah's Reno
hotel-casino. ``I've lived here five or six months and I think it's
very relaxed. Now Portland (Ore.) was stressful.''
   No, says lifelong Reno resident Sheryl Dembeck, Los Angeles is
much harder on the nerves than the Biggest Little City in the World.
   ``My husband lived in Los Angeles and he says he loves it here
in Reno because it's so calm,'' Mrs. Dembeck said. ``Sure, you've
got your 24-hour lifestyle and it can get fast-paced here. But then
you can go to the mountains or to the lake and get away.''
   Mrs. Dembeck works in the Washoe County clerk's office where all
local divorce filings are handled. The consensus from the nine
clerks is that divorce isn't always a stressful thing.
   ``Some of them are real happy about it,'' she said. ``But the
last time the mayor came in he seemed a little stressed, if you ask
me.''
   Levine, a psychology professor at California State
University-Fresno, said that failed marriages aside, Reno and Las
Vegas still top the list of stressful cities as far as
psychological well-being goes.
   ``Even without the divorce figures, which are inflated by the
presence of so many people who come to Nevada just to get a
divorce, the two cities would still be highest in overall
pathology,'' he said.
   Las Vegas Mayor Ron Lurie agreed that life can be stressful in
the gambling capital of the world, but ``I don't think we're any
different than any other city.''
   ``I'm stressed all the time,'' he said. ``I just work on nervous
energy. You have to have a good attitude about it.''
   According to Levine's survey, State College, Pa., was the least
stressful city in the nation.
