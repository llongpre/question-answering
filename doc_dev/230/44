is offering steam train service from Williams, Ariz., to the south rim of the 
Grand Canyon.

The line, which began operation on Sept. 17, 1901, had closed in 1968, partly 
because of increased road travel to the south rim. Congestion and environmental 
concerns have prompted the reopening of the service, using four 1910-vintage 
steam locomotives and 19 restored coach cars from the 1920s.

planned for Thanksgiving and New Year's. In 1990, daily passenger service 
starts April 1. The round-trip fare is $37 for adults, $21 for children under
