   Jurors who convicted a former Los Angeles
policeman of murdering a Las Vegas socialite and two others decided
Sunday the death penalty should be imposed for each of the three
killings.
   The jury found Steven Homick, 48, guilty on May 12 in the
killing of oil heiress Bobbie Jean Tipton, her maid, Marie Bullock,
and deliveryman James Myers.
   The jury began deliberating Homick's fate on Thursday after
listening to two days of testimony in the penalty phase of the
trial and an appeal by prosecutors that he be put to death.
   Sunday afternoon, the jury ordered three death penalties, one
for each of the slayings. Formal sentencing was set for June 21 by
District Judge Myron Levitt.
   Homick, a Los Angeles police officer for 14 months in 1964 and
1965 who has steadfastly maintained his innocence, declared after
his conviction, ``My head and my heart are clear.''
   Prosecutor Mel Harmon said the Dec. 11, 1985, slayings occurred
when Homick went to Tipton's Las Vegas home to rob her of $1
million in jewelry he thought she had at the residence.
   Homick has also been charged in the so-called ``Ninja'' contract
slayings of a Los Angeles couple in September 1985 and with being
the leader of a ring that killed an elderly Las Vegas man the same
year.
   In the latter case, a federal indictment returned in March
accused Homick of running a criminal enterprise dealing in
murder-for-hire, arson, narcotics trafficking and other crimes.
   Ten others were also charged, including two of Homick's brothers
and his wife.
