<LEADPARA>  Here's the early line from Las Vegas: Gambler traffic is down for the year.
But the major casinos still are doing surprisingly good business, and that's
keeping their stocks up.;    The nagging worry, though, is that the
still-sliding California economy will pull Las Vegas and other Nevada gambling
centers down with it. The casinos are heavily dependent on California
visitors, who make up 30 percent to 35 percent of Las Vegas' head count and 40
percent to 45 percent of Laughlin's.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Concern about California's hard recession "is something people haven't been
talking about but probably should," said James Murren, casino stock analyst at
C.J. Lawrence Inc. in New York.;    Most casino stocks are trading near their
52-week highs, bolstered by strong second-quarter earnings and expectations of
an excellent summer quarter in Nevada, with at least some improvement in the
weaker Atlantic City, N.J., market. Companies like Aztar (the Tropicana in Las
Vegas and TropWorld in Atlantic City) and Showboat are much more dependent on
Atlantic City than Nevada, while Mirage Resorts, Circus Circus and Hilton
Hotels own only Nevada casinos.;    So investors in those Nevada-only stocks
have the most to lose if Californians give up gambling. "If California wasn't
there, you might as well turn out the lights in Nevada," admitted John
Giovenco, head of Hilton's gaming operations.;    Auto and
recreational-vehicle traffic between Southern California and Vegas has
remained weak this year: The vehicle count was down 4.3 percent in May from a
year ago, said the Las Vegas Convention Authority. Though air traffic into
Vegas has risen, the total number of tourists visiting from all points was
down 3 percent in the first five months of 1991 vs. the same period in 1990.; 
  Even so, the brunt of the tourist decline appears to be falling on the
smaller, privately held casinos that lack marketing muscle. The major Nevada
hotel-casinos have surprised Wall Street by keeping occupancy and profits
nicely growing, even in a recessionary economy:;    (check) Promus Cos., owner
of the Holiday and Harrah properties in Nevada, earned 35 cents a share in the
second quarter ended June 30, while Wall Street had expected only 20 cents.
But most of Promus' Nevada profit gains came from Tahoe and Reno casinos;
operating income at its southern-Nevada sites (Vegas and Laughlin, which
depend greatly on the Los Angeles area) rose only 4 percent in the quarter.;  
 (check) Analyst Jeffrey Logsdon at Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles
said both Circus Circus and Caesars World told him last week that they
continue to enjoy "heavy traffic" at their Nevada casinos in July, continuing
the spring trend.;    (check) Hilton's Giovenco said occupancy rates at the
company's four Nevada hotel-casinos ran at 77.7 percent through June 30, down
just 1 percentage point from a year earlier. July remains strong as well, he
said.;    Those healthy results for the major operators haven't been without
cost. Many of the big casinos have cut room rates, and they also say that
tourists overall are spending a little less than they would in a healthy
economy.;    But through tight cost controls and, in some cases, better house
winnings, the big casinos are sporting excellent bottom-line profits this
year.;    Can they keep it up? They'd better: The stocks' high prices today
reflect the substantial earnings gains that Wall Street expects in the summer
quarter.;    Generally, analysts still say that Circus Circus (the Excalibur
and Circus Circus casinos) and Caesars World (Caesars Palace) are two
particularly attractive stocks for the long run. But C.J. Lawrence's Murren
recently took Circus off his "buy" list. The stock has soared from $35.75 to
the $75-dollar range. "I've been telling people to take profits," he said.;   
That may be good advice for anyone who has big paper gains in casino stocks
now. The risk is growing that California could be a much greater drag on
Nevada casinos in the second half of the year, if the Golden State's economy
sinks further. At the stocks' current prices, Wall Street won't be forgiving
if anything goes even slightly wrong.;     BACK TO NEUTROGENA: Los
Angeles-based skin- and hair-care products company Neutrogena Corp. surprised
Wall Street with news that former executive Allan Kurtzman is returning to the
company. Kurtzman was head of the company's consumer products division from
1981 to 1987. He left to head faltering cosmetics giant Max Factor, which he
managed to put back on solid footing. Now, with Factor's sellout to Procter &amp;
Gamble, 64-year-old Kurtzman is returning to Neutrogena to be president and
chief operating officer.;    Prudential Securities analyst Andrew Shore called
Kurtzman's return "the best piece of news out of Neutrogena in a year and a
half." The company's earnings plunged in 1990 as competition in the personal
products field has mushroomed. Shore said Kurtzman will be crucial to
returning Neutrogena's competitive edge. Neither Kurtzman nor Neutrogena chief
executive Lloyd Cotsen were available for comment.  </TEXT>
