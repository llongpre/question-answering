   Some of the record 20 tons of cocaine seized
last week apparently was stored earlier in warehouses in El Paso,
Texas, and across that city's border with Mexico, drug enforcement
officials said.
   Seven men arrested in the case _ four in Los Angeles and three
in Las Vegas _ were expected to be arraigned before federal
magistrates today.
   On Friday, the day after investigators stumbled upon the Los
Angeles warehouse, officials raided six warehouses in El Paso and
three homes in Juarez, across the Rio Grande.
   ``We feel these warehouses were used as staging warehouses
before the cocaine was sent to Los Angeles,'' said U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration special agent Phil Jordan.
   Police said the four suspects held in suburban Los Angeles so
far had thwarted investigators' attempts to identify them, giving
false names and birthdates and saying only that they were from
Mexico. Mexican police were said to have the identity of at least
one of the men.
   ``We really don't know who they are ourselves,'' said police
Sgt. Mike Leinen of Huntington Park, where the cocaine was found.
``They're not too forthcoming.''
   Authorities believe the men are Mexican or Colombian, Jordan
said.
   Investigators believe one of those arrested in Las Vegas, Carlos
Tapia Ponce, may have directed the ring's operations, authorities
said. DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge said Tapia Ponce worked as a
customs inspector for the Mexican government in Juarez for 15 years.
   ``He is the person who rented the warehouse. He paid the
bills,'' said Curt Hazell, a deputy Los Angeles County district
attorney.
   Tapia Ponce, 68, was arrested at the Flamingo Hilton hotel in
Las Vegas, with his son, Eduardo Tapia Ponce, 34, and his brother,
Hector Tapia, 66.
   Investigators said the cocaine entered the United States through
El Paso before it was shipped to the warehouse operating as
Adriana's Pottery Warehouse, where the the record seizure was made
Thursday.
   One link between the suburban Los Angeles seizure and a house in
Juarez was confirmed when one of the suspects arrested in
California telephoned the house from jail. A police officer there
answered the phone, Jordan said.
   He said Mexican Federal Judicial Police know the identity of the
caller.
   No arrests were made at the house, but a tractor and two
trailers fitted with secret compartments were seized. ``In one of
these compartments we found 500 pounds of marijuana,'' Jordan said.
   DEA agents in El Paso also found boxes similar to those found in
the California raid, along with Mexican pottery.
   The cocaine seizure attracted so much attention that crowds
showed up at the unguarded California warehouse and began removing
its remaining contents only hours after the cocaine was removed.
   About 50 looters snatched up Mexican pottery, paintings,
statues, desks, chairs, telephones and other office supplies.
   No looting arrests were made, and no evidence was taken, police
said.
