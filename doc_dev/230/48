METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PALMDALE OFFERED AS "SUPER TRAIN" STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to ask a 
California-Nevada transportation committee to consider the Palmdale Regional 
Airport as a station site on the proposed high-speed train route from Southern 
California to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The California-Nevada Super-Speed Ground Transportation Commission is studying 
a rail line that would link the two states by a "super train." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Palmdale Regional Airport is now unused, the City Council voted to 
become involved in the process of providing possible train service to the site 
to keep alive its options in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Airports hopes to revive the Palmdale terminal 
and to build an international airport there someday. The agency sees the train 
proposal as a means of solving one of the site's chief problems, its distance 
from the city.
