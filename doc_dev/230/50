   Rival Colombian drug cartels may be joining
forces to keep smuggling and distribution lines open during their
government's crackdown, a federal agent investigating a record
cocaine seizure said Monday.
   Drug agents were surprised to find cocaine from both the
Medellin and Cali cartels in a Los Angeles warehouse that housed 20
tons of cocaine, said John M. Zienter, the Drug Enforcement
Administration's special agent for Los Angeles.
   ``It very well could be that, based on the pressure in Colombia,
this is a way cartels are trying to get much of the cocaine out of
the country and to maintain distribution channels,'' said Zienter,
who declined to say exactly how much of the cocaine was from the
two cartels named for the cities where they are based.
   DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty in Washington said he did not
believe it was unusual for the cartels to work together.
   ``They're not as competitive as might be the public perception
when it comes to what is the best, most profitable way to
distribute (the cocaine),'' he said. ``What works for one will work
for the other.''
   Seven men were arrested Thursday and Friday in Los Angeles and
Las Vegas in connection with the 20-ton seizure Thursday.
   Arrested Thursday in Los Angeles were James Romero McTague, 41,
of El Paso and Mauricio Monroy, 36, of Mexico City. On Friday,
authorities arrested Hugo Fernando Castillon, 32, of Sherman Oaks
and Miguel Garcia Chavez, 34, of Panorama City, who sometimes uses
the alias Ronald Reagan.
   The four men arrested in Los Angeles appeared before a Municipal
Court judge, who agreed to postpone their arraignments on various
drug charges until Oct. 6. The men were ordered to remain in jail
without bail.
   Authorities said they plan to eventually consolidate the cases
in a federal action.
   ``These are the major drug dealers, not just the runners,'' said
Los Angeles County District Attorney Ira Reiner. ``They are as
large as they get outside Colombia.''
   One of the men arrested in Las Vegas, Carlos Tapia Ponce, was
described by authorities as a former customs inspector for the
Mexican government who became a major drug smuggling player.
   Tapia Ponce, 68, was arrested at the Flamingo Hilton hotel in
Las Vegas, along with his son, Hector Tapia Anchondo, 38, and
Hector Eduardo Tapia Ponce, 66, the brother of Carlos, the Drug
Enforcement Agency said. Federal officials said Monday they did not
have enough evidence to charge the brother in the case.
   The father and son case appeared before U.S. Magistrate Lawrence
Leavitt in Las Vegas on Monday, but refused to identify themselves
on the advice of their defense attorney, David Chesnoff.
   Leavitt set an identity hearing for Friday to be followed by a
detention hearing, where motions for bail will be argued. They are
being held without bail.
   Leavitt set an identity hearing for Friday to be followed by a
detention hearing, where motions for bail will be argued. They are
being held without bail. Chesnoff also requested a preliminary
hearing for the two, which under law must be held within 10 days.
   Tapia Ponce apparently ran the Mexican operation, said Special
Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan Bryant-Deason.
   ``He picks up the ball once it is in his country, and moves back
into the hands of the Colombians in L.A.,'' said Ms. Bryant-Deason.
``The rest of the men work for him. Anybody who gets that close to
that much narcotics is an extremely trusted part of the
organization.''
   In the Los Angeles raid, authorities acting on a tip knocked
apart a $6 padlock on Adriana's Pottery Warehouse in suburban
Sylmar, 25 miles northwest of Los Angeles, and found 40,000 pounds
of cocaine, worth between $2 billion and $20 billion on the street.
Also found was $10 million in cash.
   It was the world's largest drug seizure, topping the previous
record of 12 tons seized in Colombia.
   The seizure also signaled the existence of a major drug route in
which the drugs are shipped from Colombia to Mexico, taken across
the border through El Paso, Texas, and shipped, probably by truck,
to Los Angeles for American distribution.
   On Friday, officials raided six warehouses in El Paso as well as
three homes in Juarez, Mexico. Authorities said the warehouses were
used as staging sites before the cocaine was transported to Los
Angeles.
   Ray Sepulveda, DEA special agent in El Paso, said his agents
discovered an underground storage facility being excavated in one
of six warehouses he and his men raided in east El Paso.
   DEA agents who tore down a false wall found a concealed room
about the size of a living room, he said.
   ``They had been digging a pit down about 20 feet. It would have
been a good hiding place for narcotics,'' Sepulveda told the El
Paso Herald-Post.
   Drug agents in California, meanwhile, had begun destroying the
20 tons of cocaine, said Zienter. The $10 million had been
deposited into a downtown Los Angeles bank.
