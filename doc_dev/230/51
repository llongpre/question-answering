   A father and son accused of helping run the
smuggling ring cracked in the world's largest cocaine seizure were
ordered Tuesday to return to Los Angeles and face charges in
federal court.
   U.S. Magistrate Lawrence Leavitt ruled there was a ``clear
showing'' of probable cause that Carlos Tapia Ponce and his son,
Hector Tapia Anchondo, were involved in the drug ring that led to
the warehouse seizure last month of 19 tons of cocaine.
   Leavitt's ruling came after an hour-long preliminary hearing
during which prosecutors presented a Drug Enforcement
Administration agent as the only witness against the two men.
   Tapia Ponce, 68, and Tapia Anchondo, 38, both Mexicans, have
been jailed without bail since their arrest at a Las Vegas hotel
Sept. 29, the day the cocaine and $12.2 million in cash was found
in the Sylmar warehouse.
   DEA agent William Sherman, who participated in the surveillance
of the warehouse, testified during the hearing that James McTague,
one of four men arrested in Los Angeles, identified the father and
son as the leaders of the massive cocaine distribution operation.
   ``He claimed to have been hired by Carlos Tapia Ponce and Hector
Tapia Anchondo to run the warehouse and supervise the distribution
of the cocaine,'' Sherman said.
   Sherman said another suspect arrested in Los Angeles, Gilbert
Mendoza, claimed he was hired by the son to drive a tractor-trailer
on cocaine runs from El Paso, Texas, to Los Angeles.
   Defense attorney David Chesnoff, making an unsuccessful attempt
to get the charges dropped, claimed both men have recanted their
statements and will not testify against the Tapias in their federal
court trial.
   Prosecutor Tom Green, however, said the government only needed
to establish ``bare bones'' probable cause in the hearing and had
met its burden of proof.
   Tapia Ponce and Tapia Anchondo were arrested the day the bust
was made in Los Angeles while vacationing with their families at a
Las Vegas hotel.
   In an affidavit filed in the case, a DEA agent said McTague,
married to Tapia Anchondo's sister, said he had been in charge of
the warehouse for about a year and during that time 60 tons of
cocaine had moved through the facility.
   Authorities estimated the street value of the seized cocaine at
from $2 billion to $20 billion.
