   Hilton Hotels Corp. said it will spend $100 million on its Flamingo Hilton and Las Vegas Hilton hotel-casinos. 

   The Los Angeles-based hotel and gambling concern said it would build a 25,000-square-foot theme casino addition at the Flamingo property, targeted at low-budget gamblers. 
A relandscaping and parking-garage addition at the Las Vegas Hilton are included as the early stages of a company master plan for that facility. 

   The Flamingo Hilton addition, including a 750-room tower, would increase its total number of rooms to 3,700 and make it the largest hotel in the U.S. Currently, the Las Vegas Hilton's 3,174 rooms make it the largest, although Golden Nugget Inc. has announced plans for a 3,303-room structure on the Las Vegas Strip. 

   The Flamingo construction, also on the Strip, involves a restaurant and promenade in front of the property, and is scheduled for completion next year. 

   Barron Hilton, Hilton chairman and president, described the Flamingo addition as a step toward "a three-tiered approach to serving the Las Vegas market." 

   The budget-oriented addition at the Flamingo, he said, would take the company beyond its current specialty in the tour and travel market at the Flamingo, and in conventions and high-roller business at the Las Vegas Hilton. 

   The two properties produced $108 million in operating profit last year, 52% of the company's total 1987 profit from operations. 
In 1987, Hilton had net income of $139.9 million, or $5.59 a share, up 43% from $97.8 million in 1986. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Hilton common closed at $77.125 a share, down 12.5 cents.
