A reputed international narcotics trafficker and money launderer with ties to 
fugitive federal drug agent Darnell Garcia has been arrested in Laughlin, Nev., 
after nearly two years on the run, authorities announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Conway Willie Waddy Jr., suspected of helping Garcia and two other former Drug 
Enforcement Administration agents conduct a clandestine cocaine and heroin 
trafficking operation out of Los Angeles, was surrounded by federal agents and 
Las Vegas police Tuesday night while shopping in a local video store. He 
quietly surrendered, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
Waddy, who is under indictment in Detroit on charges of laundering millions of 
dollars in drug proceeds and trafficking large quantities of cocaine, is named 
as an unindicted co-conspirator in a February indictment in Los Angeles 
accusing Garcia and fellow former DEA Agents John Jackson and Wayne Countryman 
with conspiring to sell major quantities of heroin and cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brother Still Wanted 
</P>
<P>
Waddy and his brother, Ron, who remains a fugitive, are thought to have been 
protected by the same sophisticated underground network that is helping Garcia 
elude capture, federal authorities said. But despite Waddy's arrest, there is 
still no immediate indication of Garcia's whereabouts, said Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Joyce Karlin, who is supervising the Los Angeles investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for him. Beyond that, I can't comment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, citing an earlier court-imposed gag order in the case, declined to 
elaborate on the nature of the "network" that is cited in court documents. 
However, the documents say there is "no question" that Garcia has been 
"provided assistance" in eluding authorities since he disappeared Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tip Cited 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents in Los Angeles, Waddy and his brother were tipped 
off to the Detroit investigation by Garcia, who at the time was still working 
at the Los Angeles DEA office, and were given refuge by Garcia in a Bunker Hill 
Towers apartment after a Detroit grand jury indicted them in June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on tips from Garcia, Ron Waddy is also believed to have tipped off major 
Los Angeles drug dealer Elrader (Ray Ray) Browning to a pending federal 
indictment against him, allowing Browning to flee temporarily to the home of a 
girlfriend, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
John Anthony of the Detroit FBI said the Waddy brothers were originally 
indicted as part of a multimillion-dollar undercover money-laundering 
investigation dubbed Operation Right Turn. They were subsequently indicted on 
charges of selling half a kilogram of cocaine to undercover FBI agents, an 
investigation that led to the discovery of 86 kilograms of cocaine and $100,000 
in cash believed to be connected to the Waddys' drug-trafficking operations, 
Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles authorities said the Waddys were carrying on their purported 
money-laundering activities in Detroit at a time "when they were associating 
closely with Garcia and Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Court documents in Los Angeles describe the Waddy brothers as "dangerous 
criminals" with connections to Browning and convicted narcotics kingpin Tootie 
Reese. Ron Waddy, federal authorities said, was an "enforcer" for Reese's 
narcotics organization. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Nicodemus, spokesman for the FBI in Las Vegas, said Conway Waddy had been 
in Laughlin only a few days but apparently had rented or arranged to use a 
condominium there in the name of Cecil Woodard. He was scheduled to be 
arraigned before a federal magistrate in Las Vegas and returned to Detroit for 
trial.
