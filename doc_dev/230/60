   A Japan Air Lines Co. affiliate will begin building a magnetically levitated train line in Las Vegas, Nev., next month. 

   The project would be the world's first to use high-speed trains, known as maglevs, that hover over their tracks on powerful magnets. 

   Although the Las Vegas line will be only about four miles long by the start of commercial operation, scheduled for mid-1989, it represents a big step forward for transportation technology. 
Japanese and West German companies have been designing maglevs since the late 1960s, but they have found it difficult to sell the unproven technology. 
A profitable line in Las Vegas could encourage other cities to adopt the trains that proponents say will replace wheel-and-rail trains in the 21st century. 

   The line's builder, HSST Corp., has been an underdog in the race to build the first commercial maglev line. 
But the company decided to finance the $40 million line itself. 

   "It looks like it's a gamble," a source close to HSST, who asked not to be identified, said. 
"If it works, it could be the breakthrough they're looking for." 

   The line will run from downtown Las Vegas to the Strip, the city's biggest hotel and gambling casino area. 
The trip will take 3 1/2 minutes, and the train's top speed could exceed 120 miles an hour. 

   Maglev trains gained world-wide attention early this year after U.S. scientists refined a new type of superconductor, a material that carries electricity with practically no resistance. 
Some maglevs use superconducting magnets, so the new material could bring those trains closer to commercial viability. 
HSST's maglev doesn't employ superconducting magnets. 

   HSST's main competitors to build the first maglev line have been Transrapid International, owned by a West German consortium, and Japan Railways, which has developed a superconducting maglev. 

   The line will be owned and operated by HSST Nevada Corp., a unit run by Las Vegas businessman Frank E. Scott. 
Officials say they are negotiating with several other U.S. cities and hope to build lines in Southeast Asia and Japan as well. 

   The HSST train could end up providing a link with one of its competitor's models. 
Las Vegas wants to build a 225-mile line to the Los Angeles area to bring in more tourists, and the Transrapid maglev is a leading candidate.
