   The world's biggest cocaine bust prompted
renewed calls for more anti-drug aid to southern California, which
the region's top federal narcotics agent called ``the cocaine
capital of the United States.''
   The 20 tons of cocaine was worth $2 billion wholesale and could
have brought up to $20 billion on the street if heavily diluted and
sold in smokeable ``rocks,'' authorities said Friday.
   That would be more than double the $9.4 billion the Senate
approved this week to fight the war on drugs next year _ and enough
dope to provide the 3 million residents of Los Angeles a ``rock'' a
day for three months.
   Authorities speculated that the huge size of the haul could
indicate that Colombia's crackdown on drug lords may have forced
them to combine their distribution networks.
   The raid Thursday night, at a warehouse in a quiet
light-industrial area 25 miles northwest of downtown, also yielded
at least three arrests, extensive records of dealers and at least
$10 million in cash stuffed in boxes.
   In addition to the three men arrested in Los Angeles, the Las
Vegas Sun reported today that three others were arrested by DEA
agents at an expensive Las Vegas hotel Friday in connection with
the drug seizure. The men, one of them a former Mexican customs
official, were arrested for investigation of importation and
distribution of narcotics, the newspaper said.
   DEA night duty officers in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.,
said they could not comment on the report, and Las Vegas police
said they had no information about any additional arrests.
   ``I've been on this job for 25 years, and I've never seen so
much dope in one place. I couldn't believe it,'' said John M.
Zienter, the Drug Enforcement Administration's special agent in
charge for Los Angeles.
   ``This narcotics seizure of the largest amount of cocaine in the
world should put to rest any further speculation about whether or
not Los Angeles has in fact become the cocaine capital of the
United States,'' Zienter said.
   DEA Administrator Jack Lawn said the seizure ``is an example of
the tremendous magnitude of the cocaine problem throughout the
United States.''
   But he and other officials in Washington said it was unclear if
most cocaine now enters the country through Los Angeles.
   Local officials renewed their call for more federal drug agents.
The Los Angeles DEA office has 110 agents; Miami and New York have
more than 300 each.
   ``Hey, Washington, listen to us: We need your help,'' Police
Chief Daryl Gates said. ``We want you to send double the number of
DEA agents out here. We need more customs. And we need more border
patrol.''
   Mayor Tom Bradley said Los Angeles had beefed up its police
force to the highest levels ever and still needed help.
   ``The federal drug agents who uncovered this drug house should
be applauded,'' Bradley said. ``Now it's time for the government to
send even more personnel to wage a winning war.''
   The 40,000-pound seizure, packed in cardboard boxes, easily
topped the previous U.S. record of about 8,700 pounds in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., in 1987. It also surpassed the world record, a
12-ton seizure in Colombia.
   By comparison, a total of 18.4 tons of cocaine was seized in
Miami in the nine months ended June 30, and 2.2 tons in Los
Angeles, DEA spokesman Frank Shults said.
   Many mysteries remained, including why so much cocaine from
rival Colombian drug cartels was found in the same warehouse.
   ``The transporters were moving both Cali and Medellin dope,''
DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge said. ``That's unheard of in large
shipments like this.''
   He speculated that Colombia's crackdown on drug lords might have
forced the two former competitors to team up.
   ``The two cartels could be forming an alliance to use on
particular channels through the border,'' he said. ``It could be a
sign of their trying to regroup from what's going on in Colombia.''
   The three men arrested were to be arraigned Monday on drug
charges. They were not identified, and Lochridge said that although
they claimed to be Mexican, their accents were South American.
   Lochridge said more arrests were expected, but he declined to
elaborate.
   Drug agents said they were led to the warehouse by an
unidentified person. Some reports said a witness saw trucks
unloading at the warehouse.
   The cocaine seized would have been distributed across the
country by Los Angeles-based drug gangs, said Ira Reiner, Los
Angeles County district attorney. He added that the seized records
offered a list of leads that was ``endless.''
   ``These aren't just drug runners,'' Reiner said. ``These are the
major drug dealers. They don't get any bigger than this until you
get to Colombia.''
   Gates said the bust would dent the local narcotics traffic.
   ``But the unfortunate part of it is, it won't be a major dent.
That gives you some sense of the flow of narcotics coming in and
how much work there is to be done in stopping that flow,'' he said.
