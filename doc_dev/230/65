They called themselves Rocky and Bullwinkle. 
</P>
<P>
They are accused of a crime that is more the stuff of tabloids than of Saturday 
morning cartoons: a mass mailing of extortion letters threatening the lives of 
265 Antelope Valley political leaders, professionals and business people. 
</P>
<P>
Before their arrests in Las Vegas last Thanksgiving, former Rockwell aerospace 
technicians Richard Faroni and Roman (Moose) Makuch inhabited a nocturnal and 
obsessive shadow world of weapons, movies, science fiction, law enforcement, 
computers and surveillance technology, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
With pretrial motions set to begin this month, prosecutors and investigators 
are still trying to separate fact from fantasy in the two men's lives. "We have 
many, many hours of work left to do, " said Stephen L. Cooley, head prosecutor 
in the Antelope Valley office of the Los Angeles County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread alarm in Lancaster and Palmdale has faded since Thanksgiving, when 
the arrests of Makuch and Faroni brought a media invasion to the high desert 
that included "Unsolved Mysteries" and other national television programs with 
a taste for bizarre criminal fare. 
</P>
<P>
But seven months later, prosecutors continue slogging through documents in 
search of hard evidence that Faroni, a slightly built 26-year-old, and Makuch, 
a hulking 27-year-old, are guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion, attempted 
extortion and mailing threatening letters. They each face a maximum of eight 
years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors must still show a motive behind the strange plot to demand money 
from prominent Antelope Valley residents with death threats. Other questions 
remain: How did the conspirators plan to collect, if at all? 
</P>
<P>
And the suspects have out-of-town alibis for the period when the letters were 
mailed, so who else was involved? 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney William A. Clark, one of the few Antelope Valley lawyers who 
did not receive an extortion letter, said Faroni and Makuch will be absolved at 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence they have is very tenuous," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
He is defending Faroni, while Van Nuys attorney Carl Burkow is defending 
Makuch. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks good going in, but when you get down to it, there's nothing that 
links these guys to the crime," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley described the evidence as eclectic and "rather unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the difficulty is that Makuch and Faroni allegedly crafted a plot to 
fulfill their frequently expressed interest in committing the perfect crime, 
Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no bit of evidence that is conclusive or telling in itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is a fabric, a pattern when you combine the evidence as a whole, 
that points toward their guilt." 
</P>
<P>
The letters mailed in early November went to hotel and restaurant owners, 
attorneys, doctors, realtors and public figures such as former Lancaster Mayor 
Louis Bozigian, Lancaster businessman and present state Republican Party 
Chairman Frank Visco and former Lancaster City Manager James Gilley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Childishly Malevolent 
</P>
<P>
The letters were crude, strewn with expletives, childishly malevolent. They 
demanded that amounts generally ranging from $200,000 to $600,000 be sent to 
various names and addresses. Some letters instructed victims to gather their 
cash along with cash to be received from others, purchase walkie-talkies and 
drive repeatedly to Las Vegas until contacted. 
</P>
<P>
The letters threatened victims and their families with death by hideous means, 
claiming that the authors had poisoned former Lancaster Mayor Nick Maluccio, 
who died of a heart attack in a Palmdale restaurant in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The police cannot protect you every minute of every month, day and year," the 
letters said. "But we'll stay after you FOREVER. . . . We are experts in 
poison. We can put toxic chemicels (sic) in your toothpaste or glue laced with 
poison cyanide on envelopes and stamps that you lick." 
</P>
<P>
The letters were postmarked at the nearby Kern County town of Mojave and 
alluded to personal details about the victims, including their children and 
cars, which indicated that they were being watched. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Cathrin L. De Voe, for example, was addressed as "Miss Cat," a 
nickname she had not used since teaching exercise classes several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my moments of paranoia for a while," she said. "At least half of the 
victims were extremely fearful. The other half took it to be a ludicrous joke." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who took it seriously hired bodyguards, bought guns and left the 
area temporarily. Several victims became ill from the shock, said Cooley, who 
believes that personal information was gleaned from newspapers and other public 
documents as well as actual surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Task Force Formed 
</P>
<P>
With consternation mounting among the prominent people of the Antelope Valley, 
the Sheriff's Department put together a task force of detectives to 
investigate. They moved fast. 
</P>
<P>
A caller on the We Tip hot line reported that Lancaster residents Makuch and 
Faroni had bragged about sending the letters. The pair had left town sometime 
in early November, but when they applied for Nevada driver's licenses in Las 
Vegas, detectives were able to track them down by computer records. They were 
arrested Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Among the possessions seized in Lancaster and Las Vegas were two walkie-talkies 
of the type described in the letters, papers with the names of several victims, 
books on electronic surveillance, computer printouts with lists of cars and a 
9-millimeter pistol belonging to Makuch, who acquaintances said always carried 
a gun. 
</P>
<P>
At a lengthy pretrial hearing in March, Cooley conceded that he did not have a 
"smoking computer," physical evidence linking the two suspects directly to the 
crime. He even conceded that he believed an alibi presented in defense 
testimony by Faroni's father -- that Faroni and Makuch were visiting Faroni's 
family in Connecticut during the days before and after the mailings. 
</P>
<P>
But Cooley called the alibi, along with the suspects' abrupt move to Las Vegas 
upon their return from Connecticut, suspiciously coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the normal way people leave town," he said. "These guys were up to 
something. . . . A couple of guys left under strange circumstances who have 
been bragging about surveillance and end up in Las Vegas where all the money is 
supposed to go with all the equipment they are supposed to have to communicate 
with the victims." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numerous Lists 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution witnesses included neighbors, co-workers, friends and classmates of 
the suspects. They testified that Makuch and Faroni compiled numerous lists: 
names and addresses of co-workers at Rockwell, possible fund-raising sources 
for the Antelope Valley Film Commission on which they served and local 
attorneys. A bail bondsman with whom the two men hoped to go into business 
testified that he had told them about obtaining information through real estate 
records and other public records. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Mock, who worked with Makuch and Faroni as a technician on the B-1 
bomber project at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, testified that the three 
often concocted fantastic scenarios for the "perfect crime" during coffee 
breaks on the night shift. Faroni and Makuch were laid off by Rockwell about 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Other witnesses testified that the two bragged about their expertise with 
high-tech eavesdropping equipment and clandestine surveillance that they were 
conducting. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony showed that they had contact with at least one victim, a Palmdale 
realtor whose son played on a Little League baseball team that Makuch helped 
coach. At a college photography class, the two befriended the son of a 
prominent produce merchant who later received an extortion letter. 
</P>
<P>
And an editor of a local newspaper testified that his comparison of the writing 
style and grammatical patterns of the extortion letters and a short story 
written by Makuch suggested that they had been written by the same person. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys objected strenuously. 
</P>
<P>
"That short story analysis isn't going to float," Clark said. "They are going 
to need someone with more credentials at trial." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Portrait Emerges 
</P>
<P>
Clark acknowledged that a portrait emerges of the inseparable Makuch and Faroni 
as secretive, nocturnal, military veterans with a penchant for discussing 
schemes such as becoming private investigators, taking elaborate revenge on 
nosy neighbors and raising money to establish an Antelope Valley film studio. 
</P>
<P>
"They are rather odd characters," he said. "They live in a fanciful world." 
</P>
<P>
But that is no crime, he said. The prosecution "is going to have to come up 
with an explanation as to why they would do it and how they would get the 
money. All the money's going around in a great big circle." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said there are innocent explanations for apparently suspicious 
circumstances. For example, he said, the defendants had a list of local 
attorneys because they planned to go into business as process servers. They 
went to Las Vegas because they had been laid off for almost a year and were 
looking for jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most significantly, Clark said, he has yet to see anyone offer a convincing 
motive for the plot. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley said he will expand on arguments that Faroni, Makuch and several of 
their acquaintances resented prominent area residents. For example, he said, 
because of their membership in the Antelope Valley Film Commission, they knew 
of the frustration of its director, Stephanie Abrahamson, who testified that 
she had been stymied in efforts to get financial support to attract movie 
companies to Lancaster and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confuse Authorities 
</P>
<P>
Such resentment was part of a "variety of motives" that are "not necessarily 
clear-headed and logical," Cooley said. He said he believes that there were 15 
to 20 actual targets of the plot and that the rest of the victims were included 
only to confuse authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the prosecution must supply the "missing link" of who mailed the 
letters and how the conspirators intended to collect the money. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley said he believes that the arrests came as Makuch and Faroni were 
preparing the next phase of the plot, in which they would have chosen a smaller 
number of victims and given further payment instructions. He said investigators 
still hope to find the accomplice or accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor Bozigian is among the victims who say they believe that a longtime 
resident or residents with longstanding grudges aided the criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was someone who felt vengeful and vindictive, disgruntled members 
of the community," he said. "I don't think all the facts have come out."
