MAYORS and police chiefs across the US yesterday stepped up efforts to quell
the spread of the violence that struck the city of Los Angeles in the wake
of the surprise acquittal of four police officers accused of assaulting
Rodney King, a black motorist.
In the worst incidents outside Los Angeles, the centre of San Francisco was
swept by destruction and looting on Thursday night as peaceful protests
against the King trial verdict, led primarily by student groups, were joined
by multi-racial youth gangs. But police were quick to respond.
Over 600 San Francisco police backed by reinforcements from several
surrounding counties arrested around 1,400 people in the Bay area, and Mayor
Frank Jordan ordered an immediate curfew, as the city authorities sought to
preempt any possibility of a spiral of violence.
Black leaders in many other regions reported a deep sense of anger and
frustration after the King verdict, but only in a handful of other cities
did protests spill over into violence.
Mobs of 200 or more rioted in Atlanta and Seattle, and in Las Vegas
firebombs were thrown at two police stations and a police officer was shot
in the leg. Police said they found a charred body in the wreckage of a burnt
out shop.
Shots were also fired in Tampa and Birmingham, and arson was reported in
Pittsburgh.
City leaders yesterday were keen to act quickly to head off any possible
escalation of violence, warned by the experience of Los Angeles how quickly
the police could lose control.
The incidents in Las Vegas and Atlanta, although severe, were on a much
smaller scale than the widespread rioting that struck California, but these
two cities followed the lead of Los Angeles and San Francisco by ordering
overnight curfews and by calling out the National Guard.
On Thursday night, the vigorous police response in San Francisco contrasted
with the images of Los Angeles, where helpless policemen had looked on as
looters ransacked shops.
Elsewhere, police and shopkeepers took precautions to guard against the
possibility that demonstrations could run out of control. In New York, many
workers were let off work early on Friday afternoon, turning the city into a
ghost town in anticipation of a closed down and nervous shopkeepers
barricaded their windows.
Last night hundreds of black, white and Hispanic protesters rampaged through
the streets of Lower Manhattan. They broke windows and smashed taxis. Cars
were overturned in Greenwich Village. Several people were arrested. Earlier
another swarm of protesters shouting 'guilty' tore through Washington Square
Park.
Several arrests were made after 200 people demonstrated in Times Square and
in Harlem black protesters pulled two white men out of a truck stabbing one
in the back.
Although rage over the decision in the Rodney King trial began the riots in
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta and other cities, the sparks
fell on dry tinder.
The rioters and looters are not all black, nor are they all minorities. Many
riots have been led by gangs of poor youths from the inner city ghettos of
America, striking out and grabbing what they can in the midst of chaos.
Black leaders yesterday looked for ways of channelling the anger that many
blacks felt after the King verdict.
In Cleveland, for example, a youth leader named on television a number of
police officers regarded as persistently racist. 'If the leadership follows
through on it, that kind of thing could cool things down considerably,' a
local black politician said.
Many other cities, however, contain several of the ingredients for violence:
depressed inner city neighbourhoods, youths with little education and less
hope of employment, and heavily armed street gangs.
Meanwhile the rest of the world has reacted with a mixture of emotion and
trepidation to events in the US.
William Dawkins writes from Paris: The Los Angeles riots are a symptom of
the US administration's insufficient attention to social problems, French
President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday.
'I do not want to give advice, out of respect for this great country, but as
you are asking my opinion, I think there is an absence of social legislation
and protection,' Mr Mitterrand said.
The 'scandalous' court acquittal of four white policemen filmed beating a
black motorist was partly to blame, but poverty was the root cause. Wherever
there is poverty 'there will always be incidents and there will always be
injustices,' said Mr Mitterrand.
