A former Tustin bank president was placed on a three-year probation Wednesday 
for providing five Las Vegas casinos with phony credit information that was 
used to set up credit lines for several alleged organized crime figures. 
</P>
<P>
Roger McGinnis, 52, of Orange was sentenced to 300 hours of community service 
by U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis, a former president of Far Western Bank, had faced a maximum five-year 
prison term and a $10,000 fine after he pleaded guilty in November to one count 
of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding on the probation sentence, Wilson said McGinnis had suffered enough 
from the stigma of a felony conviction, adding that he didn't want to ruin the 
former executive's chances of employment. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the information provided by McGinnis, the casinos loaned thousands of 
dollars to John DeMattia and Morton Goodman. The Justice Department has linked 
the two to a Los Angeles organized crime family. 
</P>
<P>
The casinos were Binion's Horseshoe, the Las Vegas Hilton, the MGM Grand Hotel 
and Casino, the Sands Hotel and Casino and the Desert Inn and Country Club.
