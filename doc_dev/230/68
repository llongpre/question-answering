LIEBERTHAL HITS 2 HOMERS TO KEY PAIR OF WESTLAKE VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westlake High's Mike Lieberthal hit two home runs and drove in seven runs 
Friday to lead the Warriors to two wins in the Chaparral tournament in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal, a senior catcher who has signed to play with Arizona State, was two 
for three and hit a three-run home run as Westlake beat Basic of Nevada, 14-3, 
in its first game of the day. Lieberthal added a grand slam in an 11-6 win over 
Serra of California. The games were limited to six and five innings because of 
a time limit. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal's 10th and 11th home runs of the year give him the lead among area 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, which lost for the first time this season in its tournament-opening 
game Thursday, amassed 19 hits and improved to 17-1. Westlake entered the 
tournament as the top-ranked Southern Section 5-A Division team. 
</P>
<P>
"We started slow in both games, but rose to the occasion when we had to," 
Westlake Coach Rich Herrera said. "You could hear the guys in the dugout 
saying, 'Hey, we can't get beat again' " 
</P>
<P>
Against Basic, Westlake erupted for six runs in the third inning and added 
eight in the sixth. Keith Hess was two for three and hit his fourth home run, 
and James Jones drove in four runs. Mike Eby, a senior left-hander who has 
signed a letter of intent with UCLA, allowed seven hits and improved to 6-0. 
Eby is within one win of tying the school record for wins in a season, which 
was set in 1987 by John Chiaramonte. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Rob Neal was three for four with a triple, and Rick Wolters 
added two hits for the Warriors, who committed seven errors and allowed five 
unearned runs. Lieberthal's grand slam, his seventh homer in nine days, 
highlighted a four-run fifth that allowed Westlake to extend a 7-6 lead.
