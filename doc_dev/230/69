ALL RIGHT, OKAY, YOU WIN: INSIDE LAS VEGAS by David Spanier Secker &amp; Warburg
Pounds 16.99, 275 pages
LOS ANGELES: CAPITAL OF THE THIRD WORLD by David Rieff Jonathan Cape Pounds
17.99, 270 pages
UNLIKE WRITERS such as Tom Wolfe or Hunter Thompson, who see Las Vegas as an
opportunity for satire, David Spanier chooses to give us the straight dope
on the place in his loving, informal account, All Right, Okay, You Win:
Inside Las Vegas. Casting his eye over its daily life, he depicts a city
that is shedding its image as a venal pleasure dome in an effort to become
legitimate. Gone are the days when Bugsy Siegel and his mobster friends ran
the casinos, now replaced by corporate-minded, law-abiding entrepreneurs
whose 'family entertainment centers' just happen to include slot machines
and poker baize. And instead of some pin-striped Mafioso at the baccarat
table you are more likely to see a grim Japanese businessman.
The irony of all this legitimacy, of course, is that a high-tech,
squeaky-clean Las Vegas might be a contradiction in terms. By replacing Tony
the Ant and Jimmy the Weasel with Mickey the Mouse, the people who run Vegas
may be sacrificing the city's unique allure in order to make it just another
knob on America's increasingly bland national entertainment console.
Spanier chronicles this metamorphosis with an unblinking, kindly eye. He is
as good on the small print as he is on the big picture, showing us, for
instance, the distinctly unglamorous life of the 'soiled doves', the
prostitutes who work more or less legally on the Strip as an adjunct to the
gambling. There is also a fascinating chapter on sign making, which has
grown into a multi-million dollar business as rival casinos try to out-shine
one another with garish neon creations. Spanier is at his best describing
the mechanics of gambling, showing how the big casinos walk a fine line
between fleecing their customers and treating them like gods. In Vegas, it
would seem, chance is an exact science - it is no surprise to learn in this
lively, informative book that the man hired to design the modern slot
machine was an engineer who had previously spent 20 years at NASA.
David Rieff's Los Angeles: Capital of the Third World depicts another desert
city undergoing rapid transformation. Rieff's premise is that LA, swamped by
immigrants from the Third World, will soon be a non-white, non-Eurocentric
city with closer ties to Tokyo and Mexico than London or New York. Resident
whites are confronting this fact with varying degrees of bemusement, from
those who throw up electric fences around their properties in anticipation
of a coming race war to others who see it as a blessed opportunity to
recruit cheap household help (who are now referred to as 'enablers', as in
'now that I have a maid, I'm able to take up jogging'.) Either way, it is a
change that even the most blinkered of Beverly Hills residents is going to
have to confront eventually.
Rieff's account is exhaustive and often fascinating, offering up compelling
facts such as the astonishing news that the LA public school system now has
pupils who speak 82 different languages. He is also very good at portraying
the rather pathetic attempts of liberal whites to deal with the changing
face of their city - sampling spicy cuisines and mariachis music seems to
suffice for most. And yet, though he is alive to the dangers inherent in
this demographic upheaval, Rieff remains bullish on its possibilities,
seeing the legendary sunniness and mutability of native Angelenos as well
suiting them for finally adapting to the inevitable.
What is lacking here is a view from the 'other side'. By relying so heavily
on statistics, published sources and interviews with resident whites, Rieff
fails to give a clear sense of what exactly it is that LA's new immigrants
are searching for. The emphasis on trend spotting and incisive sociology
results in a strangely underpopulated book; a few case studies on individual
immigrants would have helped provide a picture of the faces behind the
numbers. After all, it is easy to assume they all want a piece of the
American Pie: the question that remains unanswered in this otherwise fine
book is what sort of pie that might be once somebody else is doing the
cooking.
