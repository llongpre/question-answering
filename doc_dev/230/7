A two-state commission meeting here Saturday ordered a study of eight 
California locales, including Palmdale, proposed as station sites for a 
futuristic high-speed train linking Las Vegas with the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The $145,000 study will consider ridership potential, and economic and 
environmental effects in each of the nine communities. 
</P>
<P>
When the report is complete -- probably in October -- the 16-member 
California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Committee will select a 
route and station sites for the proposed 200-m.p.h. train. 
</P>
<P>
"This study will allow us to decide how requests for proposals will be drafted 
and whether we want to drop locations from the list," said Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar), commission chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The California areas chosen for further study are Barstow, Victor Valley, 
Palmdale, Palm Springs, Ontario, the San Bernardino Valley, western Riverside 
County and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, the study will focus on Las Vegas and Clark County. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the lure of the Magic Kingdom and other tourist attractions, Anaheim 
officials have vigorously supported their city as an ideal terminus for the 
train and had hoped that the commission would decide in their favor at 
Saturday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Campaign 
</P>
<P>
However, San Fernando Valley officials recently have mounted an aggressive 
campaign touting a northern route through Palmdale that would terminate in 
Mission Hills. Most public support at Saturday's meeting was for the northern 
route. 
</P>
<P>
"We would very much favor a route through Palmdale because it would support the 
enormous population that is moving north from Los Angeles" into the Antelope 
Valley, said Palmdale Mayor William Knight. 
</P>
<P>
At an average of more than 250 m.p.h., the high-speed train could whisk 
travelers between Las Vegas and Southern California in 70 minutes, according to 
early feasibility studies. 
</P>
<P>
Those studies also project that as many as 3.6 million passengers would ride 
the train during its first year of operation, at a round-trip fare of $65. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters of the so-called super train believe that the concept will generate 
enough private investment to cover the more than $2.5-billion construction and 
operation costs.
