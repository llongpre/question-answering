   A rare Southern California snowstorm
threatened crops, wreaked havoc on freeways, and stranded motorists.
Millions of people were absolutely delighted.
   ``I think it's very cool,'' said 11-year-old Laura Ruhland of
Santa Clarita, 35 miles northwest of Los Angeles. ``The trees
outside all look like Christmas.''
   The storm, the latest product of a relentless arctic cold front,
blew snow and ice across Southern California on Wednesday after
smashing low-temperature records throughout northern and central
California and around the nation.
   Rising temperatures and rain in Southern California turned
Wednesday's winter wonderland into today's morning mush.
   Temperatures rose moderately in most parts of the nation, but the
Alaskan front refused to die. Strong wind and cold weather poured
into the Great Lakes, leaving snow drifts 10 feet high in northern
Michigan. Snow also fell early today in Utah, Nevada and New York.
   The Alaskan weather has been blamed for at least 92 deaths
nationwide since moving into the lower 48 states on Jan. 31.
   Cold weather was blamed for the deaths of 26 people in northern
Mexico, where temperatures have dipped into the teens. Citrus
growers conducted an emergency harvest of oranges, grapefruit and
tangerines but said it was too early to tell how much of Mexico's
citrus crop had been damaged.
   Residents of the once-snowy Los Angeles communities of Granada
Hills and Tarzana and the nearby city of Thousand Oaks woke up to
rain.
   The Antelope Valley, 60 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles,
was the only southland area reporting a second day of snowfall
today. It got 3 to 4 inches.
   The cold sent natural gas use to record levels and killed citrus
and floral crops, threatening to raise the cost of an orange or a
Valentine's Day bouquet.
   Near-freezing temperatures early today forced street people into
shelters, and the cold apparently claimed a transient's life in
Fontana, 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
   An accident on an icy road killed one person in Redlands, about
65 miles east of Los Angeles.
   Blowing snow shut Interstate 5, California's main north-south
highway, about 40 miles north of Los Angeles. Hundreds of truckers
were stranded there and at other road closures, the Highway Patrol
said. Northbound lanes remained closed this morning.
   The Antelope Valley Freeway, which runs northeast from the San
Fernando Valley to Palmdale, was also closed for much of the day.
Today cars were escorted through the snow.
   Snowfall Wednesday measured up to half a foot in suburban Granada
Hills, Simi Valley, West Hills, Thousand Oaks and Tarzana, closing
schools and freeing students to frolic with makeshift sleds and
snowmen. Many schools reopened today.
   In Granada Hills, about 25 miles northwest of downtown, children
used trash can lids and cardboard boxes as sleds.
   ``It was all black and ugly and horrible,'' said young Mary Ellen
Crosby. ``Now it is all white and glistening and beautiful.''
   Winter-weary tourists who had flocked to Palm Springs for fun in
the sun were thoroughly disheartened as temperatures hovered at 45
degrees and errant snowflakes melted into hot tubs and swimming
pools.
   ``I was hoping to play a little tennis, but the weather's
disappointing,'' said Spencer Videon, a 50-year-old businessman from
Aspen, Colo.
   In Las Vegas, smart money was betting more snow would fall today,
after the gambler's mecca was dusted with a light snowfall
Wednesday. The city got a dusting of snow overnight.
   The Department of Energy postponed an underground nuclear test
scheduled Wednesday at the Nevada Test Site. Monitoring aircraft
wouldn't have been able to track any accidental release of radiation
while it was snowing, said DOE spokesman Jim Boyer.
   In central California, snow was reported in Bakersfield and
elsewhere in the San Joaquin Valley.
   Asparagus growers in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys
reported frost damage. Small farmers who grow leaf lettuce also were
hurt, but Southern California growers generally were spared, said
Clark Biggs, a California Farm Bureau Federation spokesman.
   ``They didn't get real cold temperatures in citrus areas
overnight,'' Biggs said. ``We've had damage but you couldn't call it
disastrous.''
   Still, many growers and packers said lemon groves were hard hit
by the cold wave, with some early estimates saying up to 35 percent
of the crop may have been damaged.
   California is the nation's top producer of lemons, a crop valued
at $152 million in 1987. It will take about a week to 10 days for an
accurate assessment of the frost's damage.
   Wholesale prices of oranges already have risen slightly in
reaction to the cold. And flower growers in northern California said
their crop was badly hurt.
   ``The damage is done. The freeze has damaged the crops out there
and I don't expect them to recover at all,'' said George Ginilo,
agriculture commissioner in San Mateo County. The county's 1987
floral crop was valued at $165 million and serves wholesalers on the
West Coast and in New England.
   While some major suppliers of California flowers predicted a
shortage, it was unclear whether it would affect the market by
Valentine's Day. The Farm Bureau Federation said prices may be
``slightly higher.''
