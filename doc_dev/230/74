   Three desert motor races have been declared
extinct, a victory for environmentalists in the battle to save the
desert tortoise.
   Angry off-roaders said Tuesday their way of life is the real
target.
   The annual Barstow-to-Las Vegas motorcycle race, the Johnson
Valley-to-Parker, Ariz., race and SCORE's Parker 400, for all types
of off-road vehicles, will be denied operating permits
indefinitely, said Ed Hastey, state diector for the federal Bureau
of Land Management.
   ``More ravens kill tortoises than off-road vehicles,'' retorted
Ken Boyd, president of District 37 of the American Motorcycle
Association, which oversees the popular Barstow-to-Vegas run. ``But
you can't control ravens. It's easier to dictate to people.''
   The tortoise was added to the nation's endangered species list
as an emergency measure on Aug. 4. Its status will be reviewed next
April.
   ``We've been holding this race for 16 years and we've complied
with every regulation of federal, state, county and Indian tribe,''
said Deke Houlgate, a spokesman for SCORE.
   He said the organization will still stage the race but limit it
to Arizona.
   Jim Hayes, owner of a Yamaha-Suzuki dealership in Beaumont, said
he has ridden motorcycles in the California desert since 1949, and
believes many riders won't stop because of BLM rulings.
   ``There are so many people who really love this sort of thing,
and they are going to go out and do it anyway,'' he said.
   The Barstow-to-Las Vegas race was the most popular among
off-road enthusiasts and became the most bitterly fought of the
three. The race over the years has been battled in court by the
Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, and other groups that claim it
damaged the environment.
   The race, first run in 1967 with thousands of participants, was
put on hold by the BLM for seven years in 1975. It was reinstituted
under guidelines that limited participants to 1,200.
   In recent years, the Bartow-Las Vegas has ended at the Nevada
border, although the name remained. More than 1,100 participants
rode this year.
   Some runnings of the Thanksgiving race have seen such activist
groups as Earth First! claim responsibility for mismarking courses
and laying down tire spikes.
   BLM spokeswoman Barbara Maxfield said there were problems
despite controls, including route monitors, marked tortoise burrows
and having participants sign a statement of understanding about the
endangered status of the tortoises.
   ``We did find at least two burrows adjacent to the course that
were crushed,'' she said.
   Sierra Club observers claimed they also saw riders leaving
designated areas, and widening corridors that should have been
narrow passages.
   ``To this date, not one single tortoise has been injured or
killed,''Boyd insisted.
   But as an endangered species, the tortoise's delicate
environment also falls under protection.
   The tortoise's future became critical over the summer, when the
animals began dying of a mysterious respiratory ailment. Its
survival rate already is threatened by urban sprawl and traditional
enemies such as ravens that peck at its young.
   Motorcyclists say their way of life is being threatened, such as
communal gatherings of families at favorite spots for weekends.
   Ms. Maxfield pointed out Tuesday that about 100 desert races
were not affected by Monday's decision. Motorcyclists interviewed
said they believed it was only a matter of time.
   ``Don't close down the land,'' said Allen Barbor, 22, of
Palmdale. ``Most of it has been used for desert riding for
years.... You really can't get there by foot, so why not let
motorcyclists enjoy it?''
   The wear on terrain is precisely the problem, argued Sierra Club
official Elden Hughes.
   ``The desert is not there for everyone to destroy,'' he said.
   Steve Kassanyi, race director for SCORE International, sponsor
of the Parker 400, called the decision unfair and said it will be
challenged.
   The ruling is bad news for Barstow, 100 miles northeast of Los
Angeles.
   Attendance is an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 spectators for the
race, in addition to riders and support teams, boosting hotel
occupancy to 90 percent of the small desert city's 1,500 hotel
rooms.
