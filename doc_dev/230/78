   Entertainer Wayne Newton on Thursday accepted
a $6 million libel award that had been collecting interest while he
pursued his lawsuit against NBC, saying he is satisfied his
reputation has been restored.
   ``This was not a matter of money. This was a matter of
vindication of my name,'' the singer said after filing papers in
federal court to collect the award over a 1980 NBC broadcast linking
him to an organized crime figure.
   A federal jury in Las Vegas awarded a record $22.3 to Newton in
1986, but a judge reduced it to $5.3 million and last month ordered
him to accept the lower sum or face proving his case again in a new
trial, this time in Los Angeles.
   Newton's lawyer, Morton Galane, said that with interest, the $5.3
million award now equals $6 million. ``Such an amount would be
higher than any (libel) award ever affirmed by an appellate court in
the history of this nation,'' he said.
   Galane said a survey conducted for Newton satisfied him that his
image had been restored and that the public understood that he had
won his case.
   NBC said Thursday it would appeal. The network said in a
statement that a trial in Los Angeles would be less likely to
produce the results seen in Las Vegas.
   ``Mr. Newton's refusal to put his case before a Los Angeles jury
speaks for itself on all the issues, including whether NBC libeled
Mr. Newton,'' said Thomas B. Ross, NBC senior vice president of news.
   The jury had ruled that the singer was defamed in a series of
broadcasts. NBC correspondent Brian Ross had reported that Newton
went to a reputed mob figure for help after his 3-year-old
daughter's life was threatened.
   Newton argued the report left the impression that his 1980
purchase of the Aladdin Hotel was linked to organized crime.
