<LEADPARA>  When a midnight America West flight from Las Vegas, Nev., arrived late at
Palmdale Regional Airport, the runway lights were out and the airport tower
empty. Everyone had gone home.;    The two pilots and 10 passengers aboard
Flight 179 circled the desert airport, about 60 miles north of Los Angeles,
for a half-hour early Monday morning until someone was found to turn on the
landing lights and reopen the terminal, officials said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I couldn't believe it," said passenger Carol Johns, who was on the flight
that originated in Las Vegas. "The pilot told us he was calling to get someone
to turn on the runway lights and that we would have to wait until the lights
came on.;    "The tower people shouldn't pack up and go home without making
sure everything's finished," she said.;    America West officials said that
they are responsible for tracking their flights and notifying the tower to
stay open when flights are delayed or canceled. But they failed to alert
airport officials that Flight 179 was 55 minutes behind schedule, officials
said.;    "We're still working through the reports on what happened last
night, but it looks like there was just a communications breakdown and we
didn't get in touch with the right people," said Woody Weber, America West's
local manager.;    The unidentified pilot radioed the control tower at Plant
42 -- an Air Force production facility which leases its runways to the
regional airport -- and a security guard turned on the lights, officials said.
The propeller plane landed at 1:07 a.m., officials said.  </TEXT>
