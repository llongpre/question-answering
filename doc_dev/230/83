   Snow fell early today from the mountains of Southern California
to the northern Plains, where the temperature dipped to minus 21
degrees. Some parts of Utah buried under as much as 2 feet of snow.
   Snow also lingered over parts of lower Michigan, upstate New York
and northern Vermont. Scattered rain and thunderstorms dampened
eastern Kansas, western Missouri and western Arkansas.
   A storm centered over the Rockies spread snow through much of the
West, including a light dusting Sunday in Las Vegas, that city's
first-ever Christmas Day snowfall.
   Snow fell Sunday night in mountain areas of Southern California
and traffic was escorted along Interstate 5 through Grapevine, north
of Los Angeles. Snow advisories continued in effect with up to 3
inches expected by morning.
   Snow was heavy at times Sunday evening in Show Low, Ariz., where
2 inches accumulated. In southern Idaho, Pocatello received half a
foot.
   A winter storm warning continued in Utah, where up to 2 feet was
reported on the eastern Salt Lake Valley on Sunday. Up to 6 inches
was expected by this morning, with the mountains possibly receiving
8 to 16 inches.
   The snow kept road crews busy but the Utah Highway Patrol said
only minor traffic accidents were reported. The snow and 20-40 mph
winds prompted the Utah Avalanche Forecast Center to issue a warning
for the northern Wasatch Mountains.
   Ahead of the storm, snow and sleet covered the northern Plains
and middle Missouri Valley. An inch of snow an hour was falling at
Rapid City, S.D.
   Today's forecast called for snow from the Rockies across the
northern Plains to Wisconsin and upper Michigan. Rain was expected
from northern Indiana to Illinois, the central Mississippi Valley,
Kansas, Oklahoma, and southeast Arizona.
   Highs were predicted to be near zero or in single digits from
western Minnesota across North Dakota to eastern Montana; in the
teens and 20s in northern New England, northern New York state,
upper Michigan, the upper Mississippi Valley, South Dakota, central
and northern Nebraska, the Rockies and the eastern Plateau. The 30s
and 40s were expected from central New England to Virginia, over the
rest of the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley, the central Mississippi
Valley and central Plains, the rest of the Plateau and the central
and northern Pacific Coast; the 70s and 80s in Florida and southern
Texas. Highs elsewhere were forecast to be in the 50s and 60s.
   The nation's high on Christmas Day was 87 degrees at McAllen,
Texas.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from minus 21 degrees at
Warroad, Minn., to 74 degrees at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
