   A tour bus full of weekend gamblers flipped on
its side on a rain-slickened highway in downtown Las Vegas on
Saturday. Forty-two people were injured, none seriously,
authorities said.
   The Scorpio Tours bus was carrying passengers from Southern
California when it crashed in the northbound lane of Interstate 15
at about 4 p.m.
   Driver Jose Luis Figuearera, 51, said through an interpreter he
lost control when he braked for a car in front of him, officials
said. They said the bus fell on its left side.
   ``I just saw a lot of cars getting tangled up. Then I saw a
cloud of dust and the bus was in the middle of the cloud of dust
and then it just went over on its side,'' said Malcolm Turner, a
Clark County firefighter who was driving home when he saw the crash.
   A tractor-trailer rig following the bus also swerved out of
control and collided with a car, but no injuries were reported. It
was raining lightly.
   Passengers escaped through a rooftop escape hatch and the
driver's broken windshield.
   The driver and 41 passengers were taken to five hospitals. The
worst injury reported was a broken pelvis, said Robert Forbuss,
president of Mercy Ambulance.
   Listed on the back of the bus were two Southern California phone
numbers for Scorpio Tours. Victor Enciso, who answered a phone call
made to a Claremont number, said Scorpio Tours was owned by his
aunt, Angelina Rodriguez.
   A woman who answered at the number he gave said Angelina
Rodriguez had been in a traffic accident in the Los Angeles area
and was unavailable. There were no phone listings for Scorpio Tours
in Glendora, Claremont or Los Angeles.
