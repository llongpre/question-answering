   MGM Grand Inc. announced plans
today to convert a Las Vegas golf course into a movie theme park
and a 5,000-room hotel-casino in efforts to entice both family
fun-seekers and high rollers.
   ``The theme as far as movies is concerned has always been an
interesting mouse trap,'' said MGM Grand chairman Fred Benninger at
a news conference here.
   The Kirk Kerkorian-owned company has agreed to purchase 115
acres on the strip, the current site of the Marina Hotel and Casino
and Tropicana Country Club and Golf Course, for the as-yet named
theme park, said Benninger.
   The purchase of the land means MGM will construct a theme park
twice the size originally planned for property on the MGM-owned
Desert Inn.
   The purchase price was not revealed, but Benninger said that MGM
Grand plans to spend as much as $700 million to add 4,300 rooms to
the 700-room Marina and to build the theme park with a working film
and television studio.
   The MGM Grand complex, to open in 1992, is the latest effort to
woo families to Las Vegas. Circus Circus, the first resort to do so
more than a decade ago, is now one of the most successful gaming
and entertainment operations in Nevada.
   ``Clearly the theme park idea is one that has been looked at for
quite a while and I believe it's another extension of what Las
Vegas stands for,'' said Harold Vogel, the veteran entertainment
analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   ``It's an adult resort, and now they're going to extend it so
the rest of the family members can enjoy it too,'' Vogel said
Thursday.
   MGM Grand, a separate company from MGM-UA, owns an all-frills
Los Angeles-New York airline and the Desert Inn in Las Vegas. It
also retains rights to a stylized version of the famous MGM lion.
   The Beverly Hills billionaire, 72, had sold and bought back bits
and pieces of MGM-UA for two decades, a period during which he also
traded Las Vegas hotels the way most people buy cars.
   Then last month, Australia's Qintex Group agreed to purchase
MGM-UA _ including the original lion logo _ for $1.5 billion,
outbidding media mogul Rupert Murdoch by $100 million.
   Las Vegas city and tourism officials have said for years that
the city needed a major theme park to help attract families as
visitors. A water theme park, built on the Las Vegas Strip five
years ago, has been extremely successful.
   Las Vegas will count more than 18 million visitors this year, up
from 11 million in 1980.
   The city is approaching the size that could support such a
venture, boosters of the idea say. Las Vegas had 300,000 residents
eight years ago. Today it has more than 700,000 and is one of the
fastest growing cities in the country.
   A fire at the original MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, which
Kerkorian built in 1973, killed 84 people in 1980. In 1985,
Kerkorian sold that MGM Grand and its sister hotel in Reno to Bally
Manufacturing Co. of Chicago for nearly $500 million.
