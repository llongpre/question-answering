DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DROPS CHARGE IN VAN NUYS SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A first-degree murder charge against a Van Nuys man was dismissed Thursday by a 
Van Nuys Superior Court judge who ruled that the defendant's confession had 
been obtained illegally. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said charges will be refiled 
because prosecutors believe they have enough evidence against Stephen Rusty 
Lockett, 29, to convict him without the confession. 
</P>
<P>
Lockett was accused of killing Tracy Shay White, 33, whose body was found along 
a road in Griffith Park, wrapped in blankets and sheets, on Sept. 9, 1988. She 
had been killed by a blow to the head with a heavy object about 10 days 
earlier, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockett had called White's boss and said she would not be at work because she 
was attending a funeral, said Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Berry. Lockett was 
arrested on Oct. 14 in Las Vegas with White's car and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned by Los Angeles police in Las Vegas, Lockett said, "I'd just feel 
more comfortable if I had an attorney," according to police transcripts of the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
But he waived his right to counsel after being told an attorney was not 
immediately available and that talking to police could help his case, the 
transcript shows. 
</P>
<P>
The transcript also quotes the detectives as emphasizing to Lockett that they 
would in no way harm him or force him to talk if he did not choose to. 
</P>
<P>
Lockett went on to tell detectives that he struck White with a hammer after she 
attacked him with it. He said he wrapped her body in sheets and drove her to 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge James A. Coleman dismissed the charge because he 
said Lockett clearly had tried to invoke his constitutional right to an 
attorney before he confessed. 
</P>
<P>
Lockett was rearrested Thursday and was returned to jail.
