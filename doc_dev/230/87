   Andrew Wigglesworth, a
10-year-old boy who lost a leg to a tumor, had a thriller of a day
when he met rock star Michael Jackson in Los Angeles, then visited
Disneyland with actor Martin Sheen.
   ``He was just awe-struck,'' Andrew's mother, Philippa, said of
her son's meeting with Jackson in Los Angeles.
   Sheen, who met Wigglesworth last November when the boy appeared
as an extra in a movie, arranged the trip for Andrew and his mother.
He met them at the airport Tuesday and escorted them to meet Jackson
backstage before a concert.
   During the concert, Andrew stood up in the aisle and began
dancing as Jackson performed the hit, ``Thriller.''
   During the visit to Disneyland on Wednesday the youngster was
mobbed by Disney characters.
   For Sheen, making Andrew's dreams come true was simply ``an
honor.''
   In the end, Andrew couldn't decide what he liked best about the
trip. ``Everything was good,'' he said. ``Everything.''

   Entertainer Wayne Newton says a public survey
satisfied him that his reputation has been restored since he won a
multimillion dollar libel lawsuit against NBC.
   ``This was not a matter of money. This was a matter of
vindication of my name,'' Newton said Thursday after filing papers
in federal court to collect a $6 million libel award against NBC
over a 1980 broadcast linking him to an organized crime figure.
   A federal jury in Las Vegas awarded a record $22.3 million to
Newton in 1986, but a judge reduced it to $5.3 million and last
month ordered him to accept the lower sum or face proving his case
again in a new trial, this time in Los Angeles.
   Newton's lawyer, Morton Galane, said that with interest, the $5.3
million award now equals $6 million.
   Galane said a survey conducted for Newton satisfied him that his
image had been restored and that the public understood he had won
his case.
   NBC said it would appeal. The network said that a trial in Los
Angeles would be less likely to produce the results seen in Las
Vegas.

   TV talk show host Geraldo Rivera has joined
comedian Richard ``Cheech'' Marin and other prominent Hispanics to
form a company aimed at buying network-affiliated television
stations.
   Besides Rivera and Marin, the other principals in the new company
_ named Maravilla Communications _ are Herman Badillo of New York;
Marcelino Miyares of Chicago; and Tony Bonilla Sr. of Corpus
Christi, Texas.
   Badillo has a long history of public service and has served as a
congressman, Bronx borough president and a deputy mayor. Miyares is
president of Times Square Studio, one of the nation's only
Hispanic-owned independent production facilities. Bonilla is
chairman of the National Hispanic Leadership Conference.
   At the announcement of the company's formation Thursday, the new
owners said they would not be looking to buy Hispanic stations but
planned to create a ``community-oriented station.''

   Former world heavyweight champion Muhammad
Ali, who turned 46 this week, says he has no serious health problems
despite reports to the contrary.
   ``The American press portrays me like a dying man,'' he said
Thursday before leaving this West African country after a five-day
visit. ``Behind this campaign are the enemies of Islam. Allah made
me famous and is not going to destroy me. There is nothing serious
about my health.''
   Ali reportedly has Parkinson's Syndrome, an ailment marked by
slurred speech, a shuffling gait and slower reflexes.
   He has said he was looking for another country, besides the
United States, where he could live for six months a year and Senegal
might be the place.
   Asked for his impressions of the country, he said: ``I feel good
in Senegal. ... Here the people are civilized. You feel it in their
eyes and in their faces. The people are warm and above all,
religious.''

   Boxer Lupe Aquino pleaded innocent to
charges of vehicular manslaughter and drunken driving stemming from
an accident in which two of his passengers were killed.
   Aquino, of Santa Paula, entered the plea in Superior Court to two
counts each of vehicular manslaughter and drunken driving Thursday.
A preliminary hearing was set for Feb. 3.
   Killed in the Aug. 14 crash were Howard Thomas, 25, and Teresa
Bello, 20, both passengers in the car driven by Aquino.
   Aquino failed to appear at his Dec. 7 preliminary hearing in
California and was arrested in Detroit on Dec. 9, moments after
losing a World Boxing Association title fight at Cobo Arena.
   He went into the fight, his first after the accident, as the
WBC's No. 3-ranked super welterweight contender. He held the title
briefly in 1987.
   ``The fight I was fighting was outside of the ring,'' Aquino said
after the match.
