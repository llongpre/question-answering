   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Valley Capital Corp., a bank holding
company that owns Valley Bank of Nevada and Caliber Bank in
Arizona, said it is "engaged in discussions" that could lead
to a sale of the company.
   A Valley Capital spokesman refused to comment on banking
industry speculation that the talks are with San
Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp. The spokesman said only
that the suitor approached Valley Capital, not the other way
around.

   A BankAmerica spokesman also declined to comment.
   "Our board of directors has been considering various
strategic alternatives for the future," Richard A. Etter,
Valley Capital president, said. "One possible alternative is
a sale of the company in light of the current consolidation
in the banking industry."
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Valley
Capital shares surged $4.25 to $28.25.
   Jay Tejera, a bank analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. in
Seattle, said Valley Capital isn't positioned to expand
further without joining ranks with a bigger bank.
   It's going to be very hard for Valley Capital to take too
much of the market away from First Interstate Bank in Nevada,
Mr. Tejera said. First Interstate is a unit of First
Interstate Bancorp. in Los Angeles.
   Mr. Tejera said he believes Valley Capital could fetch a
price of between $300 million and $325 million.
   Valley Capital has reigned for years as a provider of the
capital that built Las Vegas into a casino mecca before the
casino business tapped Wall Street for much of its growth
capital.
   Competitors such as First Interstate and Security Pacific
Corp. have moved into the region once dominated by Valley
Capital.
