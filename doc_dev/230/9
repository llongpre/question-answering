Consideration of a commuter rail line between the San Fernando Valley and 
Palmdale was postponed Tuesday for further clarification by a thoroughly 
confused Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"This sounds like some kind of a lame-brained idea," said Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi, who represents the northeast Valley. "We need some pictures, some 
idea of what this is all about." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the council, Mayor Tom Bradley and council President John 
Ferraro asked that the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission be urged to 
study such a service. They said it could relieve congestion on the Antelope 
Valley Freeway and help spur development of Palmdale Airport, where the city 
owns 18,000 undeveloped acres, which officials have long envisioned as a major 
city airport in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
The letter also suggested that trains could run along the Antelope Valley 
Freeway, in the right of way, and that perhaps a private contractor would be 
interested in developing and running the system. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Bradley nor Ferraro were on hand Tuesday to explain the proposal, 
and council members expressed concern about how it fits with other mass 
transportation proposals, including the East-West Valley light-rail line and a 
proposed high-speed train that could connect Palmdale with Las Vegas. Bernardi 
suggested that installing a rail line next to the freeway would cause lengthy 
traffic delays during construction. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, chairwoman of the council's Commerce, Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee, and Councilman Nate Holden, chairman of the 
Transportation Committee, said they had not been given details of the mayor's 
proposal. The council referred the proposal to both committees for review. 
</P>

<P>
Proposal Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) described the mayor's 
idea as a thinly veiled attempt to attract the bullet train to Palmdale over 
other destinations such as Anaheim, Ontario, Palm Springs or Victorville. The 
California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission, which Katz heads, is scheduled 
to vote on a proposed route in October. 
</P>
<P>
"They know that we're not going to run a train to Palmdale if there's nothing 
going out to Palmdale," Katz said. "I don't find it a particularly serious 
proposition at this point. There's no financing for it." 
</P>
<P>
But Bill Bicker, the mayor's transportation coordinator, said Bradley merely 
wanted to expand on the train commission's efforts. He said the mayor hopes to 
persuade private developers to finance, build and run the commuter service. A 
similar effort is being made to use private sources to build the bullet train. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's proposal is supported by the city Department of Airports, which 
hopes that Palmdale Airport will become a regional airport, relieving crowding 
at Los Angeles International Airport, said department spokesman Lee Nichols. 
There are no scheduled commercial flights from Palmdale, but America West 
tentatively plans to begin daily service from Palmdale to Las Vegas in January.
