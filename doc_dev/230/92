Southern Baptists plan a door-to-door evangelism campaign this summer when they 
hold their convention in Las Vegas -- the city of slot machines and legalized 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,160 lay people and pastors from several states already have signed 
up to knock on doors before the denomination's annual meeting in the Nevada 
city June 13-15. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an organized witnessing effort to share Christ with every home in the 
city," said Larry J. Lewis, president of the Southern Baptist Convention Home 
Mission Board. 
</P>
<P>
The Home Mission Board also has distributed pages of the Las Vegas telephone 
directory to more than 6,000 "prayer volunteers," who have pledged to pray for 
residents of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers will get pep talks from television minister Jerry Falwell and 
Los Angeles Baptist Pastor E.V. Hill -- neither of whom are Southern Baptists 
-- and Arthur Blessitt, a Hollywood evangelist who has dragged a cross through 
much of the world, and Florida evangelist Rick Stanley, stepbrother of the late 
Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
They will distribute about 10,000 New Testaments and 10,000 gospel tracts in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce President Mark Smith, a 30-year resident of the 
gambling capital, said he has "never heard of anything like this happening in 
Las Vegas before. But it may be better received than a lot of people might 
think." 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneous revivals are set for eight Las Vegas area churches during the week 
before the annual meeting, which is expected to attract about 20,000 Southern 
Baptists.
