<LEADPARA>  Recessions come and recessions go, but the doors never close here, and the
cash-carrying tourists seem to come in droves no matter how bad things get
back home.;    That, at least, is the analysis of John Venditto, who for 20
years has followed the business ups and downs of Las Vegas while plying the
trade of a crap table "stick man" at the Desert Inn casino, a posh watering
hole and gambling den for the legendary high rollers of Las Vegas.  </LEADPARA>

WORKERS UNITE TO FIGHT CASINOS' BELT-TIGHTENING  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Figures for the month of April, the most recent statistics available, show
that the Nevada casinos' take from the gaming tables alone, called the "win"
in local jargon, soared to $474.1 million, which the Las Vegas Review Journal
called "a robust 7.8 percent higher than a year earlier.";    The town where
they "put the blues on the run" seems about to do the same thing with the
recession of 1990-'91, according to experts in the capital of Carson City and
informal experts like Venditto.;    But most here agree that the new Las Vegas
coming out of the slump will never be the same as the old Las Vegas that went
into it.;    "I get paid about five bucks an hour and so my real income comes
from the tips . . . so you better believe I pay attention to the state of the
economy," Venditto said.;    The Desert Inn, noted Venditto, is part of "the
old Las Vegas," a place forever changed by the recession of 1990-'91, a power
playground where doctors, auto dealers, commodities traders, oil brokers and
other well-heeled players shoot dice with stacks of green ($25) and black
($100) chips ebbing and flowing across felt-topped tables.;    "There's always
action here," said Venditto, a founding member of a new casino employees'
advocacy group called the Las Vegas Casino Dealers' Association. "No matter
how many people go under or hit hard times, somewhere there's somebody who
does OK and there's usually enough of those somebodies who are doing OK to
keep us going.";    But this time around, the owners of several casinos,
including the Desert Inn, have reacted to tight economic conditions with staff
cuts and other belt-tightening measures that will be around long after
recession talk fades.;    Venditto said the dealers' association is being
formed to see the workers through those changes. The association will act not
as a union but as a lobbying group before the state Legislature for the
approximately 25,000 people employed to deal cards and dice.;    At a late
June meeting called by the dealers' association, perhaps a dozen newly
dismissed workers told of being let go after putting in long stints at their
workplaces.;    The Las Vegas gambling halls fired people who cost the most --
those with four weeks of vacation, comprehensive health insurance coverage and
other costly fringe benefits, said Venditto. His group plans to lobby for a
state law altering Nevada's current "employment at will" policy under which
employers don't need to state a reason for firing workers.;    "This stuff
isn't just happening in Vegas. It's going on all over the country, and it
hurts a lot of people. But here it really stinks because it's spoiling the
sort of family atmosphere we used to have where folks worked at the same place
for years and years and players got so they'd come back time and again to the
same joint because they liked the dealers there," Venditto said.;    "Now it's
all going to be mass-produced by places like Circus Circus, the Mirage and the
Excalibur," he said, referring to three highly successful resorts that have
zeroed in on providing family entertainment. Adults play for relatively modest
stakes while the hotel provides baby-sitting in the form of circus acts,
jousting knight shows and swimming pool parties.;    While old-school gambling
halls such as the Desert Inn, the Frontier and the Barbary Coast recently have
announced major staff cuts, especially among dealers, the Excalibur's owners
are riding the crest of one of the most spectacular successes since mobster
Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel first opened the Flamingo Club on a wide spot on the
road between Denver and Los Angeles.;    On June 19, the Excalibur, the
world's largest hotel with 4,032 rooms, announced that in just one year of
catering to families with children and vacationing middle-class couples it had
logged more than 11 million visitors and made enough money to pay off its $290
million in building costs.  </TEXT>
