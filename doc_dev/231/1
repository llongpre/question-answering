FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: The Borodin Quartet takes up Beethoven theme - Music
in Edinburgh

Just in case the moral seriousness of Beethoven looks as though it might
make a heavy theme for a festival, Edinburgh has thrown in Chabrier as well.
Whoever brought these two composers together certainly has a sense of
humour, but at least the two together are providing variety.
That a composer as well-known as Beethoven should have been chosen at all as
a festival theme has been criticised in some quarters, which is hardly fair.
Leaving aside the need to attract an audience, a big international festival
like Edinburgh will always have to focus on composers who left great music
across as wide a range of disciplines as possible, preferably including
opera as well as orchestral and solo music. Beethoven fits the bill - just.
His weak area was opera, but the festival director, Brian McMaster, neatly
side-stepped that problem by offering a 'Fidelio day' that widened our view
of Beethoven's experience in opera to take in the years of struggle and
re-writing during which Fidelio was born.
The rest of Edinburgh's Beethoven is less adventurous. Assorted pianists are
offering piano sonatas and all nine of the symphonies are being performed by
sundry orchestras, both period and modern. No attempt to be dogmatic about
performance style there.
For the string quartets, the Borodin String Quartet has monopolised the
field. The Borodin is of course, a modern-instrument quartet. (Although
period orchestras are making notable headway with Beethoven, period chamber
groups have had less success; perhaps four period strings just sound too
thin and scratchy in our present-day recital halls.)
There need never be any complaint about tonal blend when the Borodin is
playing. Over nearly 50 years, and despite changing its personnel on the
way, this quartet has maintained an admirably civilised tone quality, second
to none for subtlety. Its Beethoven mornings in the Queen's Hall this year
were far removed from the Lindsay's strenuous, abrasive combat or the
Emerson's hard-edged intelligence, but perhaps that was half the problem.
Of their five programmes, I attended two. The early quartets - Op. 18, Nos 4
and 5 - were playful in the gallant manner, elegant court games, not
Beethovenian rough-and-tumble. The sforzandos needed a tougher attack.  In
the A Major's slow movement one of the variations was nevertheless
marvellously rapt.
Of the two mature quartets, the concise Op. 95 held together better than Op.
130, which passed through some finely cultivated passages without suggesting
it had any decisive goal in mind.
Trenchant Beethoven playing only firmly took the stage with the Grosse Fuge,
a challenge to which all four players roused themselves with fire in the
belly.
That performance drew enough applause to warrant an encore. The Borodin
Quartet is among Edinburgh's favourites: hopefully it will be back next
year, whatever the theme.
