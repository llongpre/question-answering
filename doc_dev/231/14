To a packed house on Tuesday the Lindsay played Beethoven and Ravel, and
Schumann's piano quintet with the 1990 Leeds winner Artur Pizarro. As we
expect from them, every performance was both exciting and seriously
interesting. In their impassioned Beethoven - the C minor Quartet from opus
18 - there was a newly emphatic twist in the Finale. Their leader Peter
Cropper gave the rising phrase that ends the main tune a sharp
whipcrack-sting, and later Bernard Gregor-Smith's cello marked the switch
into C major with the same explosive flash.
Once heard, not only not forgotten but instantly persuasive: that must have
been what Beethoven meant, for it magnetised the whole movement.
For these players, Ravel's early quartet is some way off the paths they have
been cultivating. The Lindsay made their name with the Viennese classics,
Bartok, Tippett; they have expanded eastwards - notably to Janacek - and
also backwards, but not much in other directions. (A dozen or so years ago I
tried to persuade them to look at Elliott Carter's Quartet no. 1, which they
could play magnificently, but either they didn't take the bait or they
didn't like it.) France has been unexplored territory. In this Ravel, they
took heroic care to curb their customary thrust for the sake of a properly
soignee Gallic surface.
The opening Allegro moderato sounded frail and lovely, but almost enervated.
Hugh Wood's lively programme-notes declared that by comparison with
Debussy's mature Quartet, Ravel's is 'frankly feminine: like a very
beautiful cat': true as far as it goes - but there are rippling muscles
beneath the velvet, and the balance of the whole piece requires that they be
felt from the start.
In the crackling pizzicato Scherzo the Lindsay of course got the bit between
their teeth, and they made a much better fist of the Finale (too frantic and
too thin, in a Conservatoire vein that Ravel never tapped again) than most
quartets do. Between those movements, their Tres lent was deceptively simple
and poignant.
Though they are no more than middle-aged, the Lindsay were probably trying
out Schumann's quintet before Artur Pizarro was born. It showed. With eyes
glued to the piano-score, young Pizarro was a model of good taste, alertness
and controlled energy - a faultless team-member, in fact; but in his hands,
scarcely one phrase had the sculpted expressive force that his Lindsay
partners gave it.
No doubt he was too polite, or too honest, to force anything upon the music
which might be naively tendentious. It was odd, nonetheless, to hear the
instrument that usually bids to dominate Schumann's proceedings, by reason
of its rich musical role, reduced to the level of faithful athletic support.
