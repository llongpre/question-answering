<LEADPARA>  'WE ARE truly fighting for our survival," says Steve Snell, chairman of the
board of the San Jose Symphony.;   From past experience, the musicians know he
means it. So for the second time in five years, they are donating their
services for a weekend of fund-raising concerts -- something few American
orchestras have ever done.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The "Save Our Symphony" benefit concerts next weekend at Flint will feature
Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 ("Choral") and Vivaldi's violin concertos, "The
Seasons.";   Vocal soloists for the Beethoven are Evelyn de la Rosa, Donna
Petersen, Daniel Harper and Ronald Gerard. The chorus will be drawn from
several South Bay groups.;   Clearly, a benefit is not the time to bring in
heaps of contemporary music. But the rest of the season tends to confirm that
the orchestra shies away from music by living composers.;   In the mainline
Masterworks series, conductor George Cleve's valedictory season is built
around a survey of Johannes Brahms. It features all four symphonies and the
awe-inspiring Violin Concerto. The season is also sprinkled with other
romantics, such as Gustav Mahler, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Richard Strauss,
Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Jean Sibelius.;  
Only three compositions for more adventurous listeners will surface this
season. One is the rarely heard "Concerto for Piano, Timpani and Two String
Orchestras" by the Czech master Bohuslav Martinu (concerts of Nov. 22-24),
whose centennial is being celebrated this year. The second is Witold
Lutoslawski's "Concerto for Orchestra" (concerts of Feb. 13-16), an early
piece (1950-54) by a highly inventive Polish composer-conductor whose style
has grown by leaps and bounds since then. The third is the sole American
selection, Roy Harris' marvelously concise, neoclassical Symphony No. 3 in One
Movement written in 1938 (concerts of March 12-15), one of the few American
works ever performed and recorded by Arturo Toscanini.;   The Lutoslawski and
Harris programs will also mark the first time a regularly scheduled San Jose
Symphony subscription series has featured four concerts, with the addition
each time of a Thursday-night program at the Center for the Performing Arts.; 
 Cleve will conduct all but the first set of the remaining Masterworks season.
It features:;   Nov. 15-17: Music of Hindemith, Mozart, Schumann, with guest
conductor Gabriel Chmura and pianist Franklin Larey.;   Nov. 22-24: Mozart's
Symphony No. 36, Martinu's concerto, and (recent program change) Mozart's
Piano Concerto No. 25 in C Major with pianist Rudolf Firkusny.;   Jan. 3-5,
1992: Music by Vaughan Williams, Debussy, Ravel and Sibelius, with harpist
Susan Mildonian performing two works.;   Feb. 13-16: Lutoslawski's concerto
and music by Mendelssohn and Brahms.;   March 12-15: Music by Harris and
Brahms, and Rachmaninoff's First Piano Concerto with Jean-Philippe Collard as
soloist.;   April 9-12: Music by Berlioz and Brahms, Ravel's Piano Concerto in
G Major, and (recent program change) De Falla's "Nights in the Gardens of
Spain," with pianist Alicia de Larrocha featured in the last two works.;  
April 24-26: Music by Vaughan Williams, Richard Strauss and Brahms, with
violinist David Abel.;   April 30-May 3: Music by Beethoven and Brahms with
Garrick Ohlsson playing Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto.;   June 5-7:
Cleve's farewell concert, with Haydn's "Farewell" Symphony, and Mahler's
Symphony No. 2 ("Resurrection"); vocalists and chorus to be named later.;   In
all these concerts, the Sunday matinee is at Flint Center, the rest at the San
Jose Center for the Performing Arts.;   The Kickback Classics series, with
lighter, shorter fare and chats by the conductor, continues at Flint Feb.
29-March 1 ("fantasies"); March 19 (Cleve leading pieces from the city of his
birth, Vienna); and May 14 (mariachi and Latin music).;   The symphony's pops
concerts feature still lighter fare that crosses over into Broadway, pop and
film music. The series includes Marvin Hamlisch Feb. 7 and 8; Henry Mancini
March 6 and 7; and Cleve conducting a Gershwin program May 22-23.  (box)  </TEXT>
