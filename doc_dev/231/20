The intersection of art and education is a notoriously accident-prone 
crossroads. The almost inevitable crash between the extremes of popularizing 
platitudes and intuitive mysteries is seldom pretty to witness. 
</P>
<P>
Given the inherent perils, the Beethoven Discovery Weekend that closed the 12th 
annual Beethoven Festival in San Francisco this year proved a surprisingly 
enlivening and enlightening event. Little pedantry, much wit and even some 
inspired music-making were invested in an exploration of the grandeur and 
subtlety of the Missa Solemnis, a.k.a. the Mass in D. 
</P>
<P>
The festival leader was Roger Norrington. In the last few years, the 
56-year-old English conductor has graduated from the relative obscurity of Kent 
Opera to unlikely eminence atop the period-practice school, with a major in 
Beethoven and a minor in proselytizing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Norrington and his London Classical Players presented a "Haydn 
Experience," followed by weekends devoted to Beethoven and Berlioz. Last 
summer, they took the Beethoven show -- centered on the Ninth Symphony -- to 
Summerfare in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Norrington's weekend-long "experiences" are baptisms by total immersion into 
the historical and artistic context of a major work, extending the typical 
pre-concert lecture to a point just short of an undergraduate course in music 
appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
The pillars of the San Francisco weekend were under the direct guidance of 
Norrington -- a concert of Missa Solemnis antecedents Friday, an open rehearsal 
of the Mass Saturday, and the culminating performance Sunday. In between were 
three miniconcerts and four lectures, all in Davies Symphony Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The sessions got off to a soft start, didactically at least. The excerpts by 
composers ranging from Palestrina to Cherubini were left largely to acquire 
significance by association, as Norrington's remarks Friday were seldom 
specific or memorably stated. 
</P>
<P>
But the performances included some gems, with the heroes the obviously 
well-drilled and enthusiastic San Francisco Symphony Chorus. The singers 
launched the evening with bright-toned and finely spun lyricism in the Kyrie 
from Beethoven's own, earlier Mass in C. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra had overtures by Beethoven and Mozart to itself, revealing 
generally crisp, balanced and energized playing, though the finale to the 
"Pastoral" Symphony sounded skittish. Norrington kept the singers and orchestra 
firmly pointed forward, seldom giving the attention to releases that he gave to 
entrances. 
</P>
<P>
Norrington also showed a stubbornly 19th-Century interpretation of the Kyrie 
from Palestrina's Missa "Assumpta est Maria," keeping it square and metrically 
insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
Baritone John Cheek contributed a rich "For behold, darkness shall cover the 
earth" and soprano Amanda Halgrimson a radiant "Come unto Him," in German and 
in Mozart's arrangements, which is how Beethoven knew "Messiah." 
</P>
<P>
In the Saturday rehearsal, Norrington nurtured his audience with pertinent and 
engaging remarks. He seemed much more relaxed, and gave easily understood 
demonstrations of specific points in the score. 
</P>
<P>
He also elicited strong cooperation from his musicians in the bits-and-pieces 
approach. Mezzo Janice Taylor and tenor John Aler joined Halgrimson and Cheek 
as a reasonably unified, but remote-sounding, solo quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Halgrimson gave a limpid, textually connected account of 
Beethoven's "Gellert" Lieder -- minus some verses -- though their relevance for 
the Missa was never made clear. 
</P>
<P>
Her sensitive accompanist was Helene Wickett. The pianist made a clear, 
understated case for the poignant power of Beethoven's A-flat Sonata, Opus 110 
-- which does connect with the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Kagan of Hunter College introduced the social circumstances surrounding 
the creation of the Missa Solemnis with a dry lecture on Beethoven and his 
patron the Archduke Rudolph. Michael Steinberg, the versatile program annotator 
for the San Francisco Symphony, provided a wise and funny guide to points of 
musical interest in the work itself. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning came the final contextual elements. Art historian Patrick 
Werkner gave a fascinating look at the iconography of the myth of Beethoven. 
The Aurora String Quartet -- all members of the orchestra -- probed the Opus 
132 Quartet with utmost refinement and seriousness, and Steinberg provided an 
emotional summation. 
</P>
<P>
These preliminaries left a large, though far from capacity, audience primed for 
the emotionally exhausting, sublime complexities of the Missa. Sunday 
afternoon, Norrington satisfied the demand he helped create with a limber, 
dramatic, exultant account of the notoriously difficult masterwork. 
</P>
<P>
This was Norrington's first "experience" without the London Classical Players. 
But however much he might prefer period instruments and practices in the 
orchestra, on the podium he is another Leonard Bernstein, dancing and miming in 
the grand manner little relevant to the way this music was originally 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
Fronting the San Francisco Symphony -- slightly reduced in strings -- and the 
large chorus, his extroverted display did not seem as incongruous as it might 
at the helm of a period-instrument band. In any case, at the end of a 19-day 
festival with the San Franciscans, he had them playing with much of the taut 
clarity associated with antiquarian orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
Norrington's Missa Solemnis retains all of the majesty and mystery of a work 
still more honored in textbooks than performances. (Both Norrington and the 
Missa will be with us next season, though not together: the English conductor 
will lead his orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic in concerts at the 
Music Center and the Orange County Performing Arts Center, while the Missa 
Solemnis opens the Los Angeles Master Chorale season.) 
</P>
<P>
The propulsive, always musically motivated pace for which Norrington's 
Beethoven is noted was a constant, conspicuous factor. Less expected was the 
devoted tenderness and lyric simplicity that he revealed in the Sanctus and 
Benedictus, and the sheer revelry of the Dona nobis pacem, powerfully 
contrasted with the harrowing intimations of war. 
</P>
<P>
Norrington drew an impressive lot of focused, balanced sound from the eager 
choristers. They delivered maximal clarity in the great fugues, where 
Norrington tellingly stressed dance rhythms rather than polyphonic 
pontification. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra gave good weight in the hushed sections, and rushed along lithely 
when launched on the meteoric openings of the Gloria and Credo. Concertmaster 
Raymond Kobler soared eloquently in the Benedictus, heading the list of assured 
orchestral soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The solo quartet sounded better in concert than in the pseudo-rehearsal. They 
proved strong enough to emerge with operatic pathos in the war-torn parts of 
the Agnus Dei, and sensitive enough to keep their essential but often 
self-effacing parts well integrated into the overall texture.
