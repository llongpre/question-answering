   A 15-minute piece of music that the arranger said
was reconstructed from Beethoven's last work was warmly applauded
at its premiere Tuesday night but an occasional discordant note
came later from the audience.
   The work, presented at London's Royal Festival Hall, is
described as the first movement of what would have been Ludwig van
Beethoven's 10th symphony.
   Barry Cooper, a researcher at Aberdeen University, said he spent
five years piecing together symphonic fragments found in Berlin,
Bonn and Vienna after the German composer's death 161 years ago.
   ``The sketches struck me as being particularly good, even by
Beethoven's standards,'' Cooper told reporters Tuesday as the Royal
Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra rehearsed for the premiere.
   ``Even though my completion won't be as good as Beethoven, I
think the overall result has got enough really good Beethoven in it
to make it very well worth hearing.''
   Violinist Sir Yehudi Menuhin, who conducted the second half of
the concert but not the movement, said: ``I think it is a valuable
work. It is certainly Beethoven.''
   Some purists disagreed.
   ``Calling this Beethoven's 10h was a bad idea,'' said John
Dankworth, a classically trained jazz composer. ``It should be
named `Excerpts and Snippets.'''
   Martin Woolf, who described himself as a music lover, said, ``I
thought it was marvelous fun, though I doubt Beethoven would have
followed the Ninth with anything like that.''
   Cooper, who wrote a book on Beethoven's creative process while
working on the musical reconstruction, said Beethoven's plans to
finish the final symphony were mentioned in a letter written eight
days before his death in 1827.
   ``He actually offered it to the Royal Philharmonic Society'' of
Britain, Cooper said, ``And now they've got it, or as much as there
is of it.''
   Speaking as a white bust of Beethoven solemnly peered over the
rehearsing musicians, Cooper called his work ``a chance for other
people to get some idea of what Beethoven had in mind. Knowing what
the 10th symphony is like has increased our knowledge.''
   The music ranges from whispery quiet sections to bold, soaring
themes over its 15 minutes.
   Menuhin, after hearing the music for the first time at the
rehearsal, said it was ``a very beautiful work.''
   The 71-year-old musician called the controversy over the
premiere ``rather silly.''
   ``Everyone is eaten with curiosity,'' he said.
   Asked if the work was important, Menuhin said: ``They use the
word `important' for all kinds of sales of antiques and `important'
gold coins. I think it's at least as important as that.''
   Conductor Walter Weller called the piece ``very, very
interesting.''
   ``It sounds like a very young, powerful Beethoven,'' he said
after the practice session. ``Not the Beethoven you can hear in a
slow moment of the Ninth (Symphony), the Beethoven with one leg in
another world. This is a powerful one.''
   However, Weller said, he could tell which parts are the real
Beethoven, and where Cooper filled in the blanks.
   According to Cooper, two-thirds of the work was taken directly
from Beethoven's sketches, which sometimes were nothing more than a
single line of notes.
   ``There's something of Beethoven in every bar,'' he said. ``You
can't say Beethoven stops here and Cooper starts there. In
practically every bar, it's part Beethoven and part me.''
   Orchestra members were taking the Beethoven brouhaha in stride.
   First cellist Francis Bucknall said the movement ``is certainly
Beethoven. We haven't heard this piece of music before, so of
course it's important.''
   ``I don't think it's the best Beethoven we've ever heard,'' said
violist Andrea Creech, ``but obviously it is very exciting.''
