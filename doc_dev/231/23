An unusual musical partnership takes to the stage in London and Birmingham
over the next two weeks: Nikolaus Harnoncourt will conduct the Philharmonia
Orchestra in two cycles of the Beethoven symphonies. Harnoncourt is the pope
of historically-aware performing practice in continental Europe. The
Philharmonia represents the modern symphony orchestra par excellence.
Harnoncourt has been hailed as one of the most original and dynamic
interpreters of classical repertoire, celebrated for his ability to make
people hear familiar music with fresh ears. Well-known to record-buying
cognoscenti in the UK, he has been a rare visitor to London. The
Philharmonia concerts are his first encounter with a British orchestra - one
which helped shape a previous generation's knowledge of Beethoven through
its concerts and recordings with Otto Klemperer.
Just how easily the Philharmonia will absorb Harnoncourt's ideas is the
subject of much speculation in London's music establishment. Whatever
happens, the results are unlikely to be dull. Harnoncourt's Beethoven is
worlds away from the traditional approach. He favours shorter, more eventful
phrasing, rationed vibrato, sharply-defined timpani and horns that rasp like
their valveless antecedents.
He is equally far from the opposite pole of 'authentic' gurus. He has never
conducted Beethoven with a period-instrument ensemble, his dictum being that
the player is more important than the instrument. He drives Beethoven's
allegros with blinding intensity, but unlike Roger Norrington or John Eliot
Gardiner, he introduces subtle inflexions of tempo. The result is a marriage
between historical nicety and the need to project and re-invent the music
for today.
Harnoncourt, a Berlin-born Austrian, made his name as a specialist in
baroque and early music, but now spends most of his time with conventional
orchestras. Those who have worked with him speak of his instinctive feeling
for the music, backed by extensive study of contemporary sources. Francis
Hunter, who played oboe in Harnoncourt's Mozart cycle at the Zurich Opera
House, refers to 'his ability to slot into the gut level of each piece and
convey what is meaningful and expressive'.
Harnoncourt spent 17 years as a cellist in the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, so
he knows what it is like to sit listening to conductors. 'He has answers to
why he wants things done in a certain way,' says Dane Roberts, a double-bass
player in the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, with whom Harnoncourt has
recorded the Beethoven symphonies.
Harnoncourt, 64, is less forbidding in conversation than his platform manner
would suggest. He speaks good English and is accompanied everywhere by his
wife, Alice, an experienced violinist who acts as his agent.
His biggest triumphs in recent years have been at the Salzburg Festival:
cold-shouldered during the Karajan years, he has become a fixture of Gerard
Mortier's programme, and will conduct Le nozze di Figaro next summer. His
present repertoire ranges from Purcell's Fairy Queen to Bruckner's Third
Symphony. He acknowledges numerous blind spots, including Gluck, Berlioz,
Mahler and Strauss, but has late Verdi and Berg's Violin Concerto in his
sights.
Central to Harnoncourt's understanding of Beethoven is what he calls the
musical rhetoric - word-like units of phrase which grew out of the
connections between music and language in the baroque and early classical
era. 'Composers a generation after Beethoven would laugh at the idea,' he
says. 'Beethoven drew on the same musical vocabulary for 30 years of his
life - words, figures, formed from a handful of notes - and used them in a
rhetorical way. Is the musical speech a continuation of the previous phrase
or a response to it? It's important that the players know, because his music
tells you something - it's on the verge of programme music.'
Harnoncourt dismisses the idea of musical authenticity. He says that even
when orchestras play with period instruments, they are realising their idea
of sound from a 20th-century perspective. 'Musical interpretation changes
with every generation. Each laughs at its predecessor and believes it is
closer to the will of the composer. I do all the repeats in Beethoven's
symphonies, but 30 years ago it was not the done thing, and in another 30 it
will be different again. It is like changing fashion.'
One reason why the field of interpretation is so wide is that Beethoven did
not always make his final intentions clear. Harnoncourt says the autograph
scores are different to most composers of the period, 'because Beethoven did
not correct them - he gave them to a copyist and corrected the copy. The
parts were printed before the full score, so he corrected the parts. You
cannot even say the last source is the will of Beethoven, because he changed
a work like the Fourth Symphony for certain performances. You have to make a
lot of judgments yourself.'
At the same time, Harnoncourt is determined to root out modern accretions,
such as the trumpet's 'note of victory' in the first movement of the Eroica.
'Orchestras today play a note which was not written by Beethoven. You could
say the theme is not complete without it, that the trumpet players of
Beethoven's time were not good enough, so let's add it. I think Beethoven
included the failure, just as he asks the sopranos in the Missa Solemnis to
sing a note that's too high for them. He wanted their faces to be blue and
the voice to crack - this is part of the composition. A hero likes to show
only his heroic side, but what Beethoven does is to show that after all, the
hero is a failure.'
He dismisses the argument that if Beethoven had had access to today's
instruments, he would have adapted the parts accordingly. 'Then he would
have written everything differently. The limitations of the instruments were
a source of inspiration. We don't know what Beethoven would have done with
the instruments of today - geniuses always do things differently to what we
expect. I don't agree with the retouching that goes on. I don't change a
note.'
Harnoncourt also questions modern trends in orchestral sound, saying the
American-led drive for technical perfection puts the emphasis on security at
the expense of beauty. That is why he encourages brass players to experiment
with the old valveless instruments.
He describes beauty as 'something to do with unevenness - it's changing all
the time, there is a bit of dirt in it, it's not pure. If you have a group
of semi-quavers and you play them absolutely equal, it's sterile.
'For me, the most beautiful instrument lies at the edge of catastrophe. I
prefer risk - I like a musician who makes a mistake because he risks too
much.'
The Harnoncourt/Philharmonia Beethoven cycle begins at London's Royal
Festival Hall tonight and Birmingham's Symphony Hall next Thursday.
