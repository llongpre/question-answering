JUILLIARD BEGINS BEETHOVEN CYCLE

The Juilliard String Quartet, which appeared at Ambassador Auditorium on 
Thursday for the first of five season-spanning concerts devoted to the complete 
quartets of Beethoven, has, in various personnel configurations, been putting 
on this show for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
So the critical pulse hardly races in anticipation of yet another Juilliard go 
at the canonic 17. But it didn't take long before Beethoven and the best 
Juilliard configuration ever -- founding first violinist Robert Mann and his 
younger colleagues, second violinist Joel Smirnoff, violist Samuel Rhodes and 
cellist Joel Krosnick -- made us willing captives. 
</P>
<P>
To open, there was the quartet in F, Opus 18, No. 1. Its bluff joviality 
embraces a slow movement as intensely emotional as anything Beethoven ever 
created, although its formal clarity would give way to the less direct methods 
employed in the later works. 
</P>
<P>
The creative perspiration of self-consciously deep works of Beethoven's last 
period -- such as the Quartet in A minor, Opus 132 -- was minimized by playing 
of uncommon sweetness and lightness of tone. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the performers backtracked to the composer's middle period with the 
grandly self-assured, vivacious "Razumovsky" Quartet in C, Opus 59, No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
If they lost some of their concentration here -- the Minuet tended to wander -- 
the precipitous finale offered that combination of ardor, technical aplomb and 
linear clarity that is the essence and particular joy of Juilliard. HERBERT
