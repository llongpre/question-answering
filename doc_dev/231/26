<LEADPARA>  DON'T arts groups ever communicate?;   First off, there are too many good
chamber groups visiting this week. They range from Poland's Chopin Trio at the
Petit Trianon in San Jose Monday to the Alexander String Quartet at the
Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts Friday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     On Wednesday night, two of the biggest favorites among quartet lovers will
compete head-to-head -- the Guarneri Quartet at Stanford's Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and the Tokyo Quartet at Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall. Buffs will
have to make a choice.;   Then there's duplicate opera, the most popular game
since duplicate bridge.;   The San Francisco Opera and the Los Angeles Music
Center Opera are both presenting "Don Giovanni" and "Carmen" this season, the
first of the works in concurrent runs.;   Later this season, though, Los
Angeles will get an exclusive item: the world premiere of Aulis Sallinen's
"Kullervo." This Finnish work, opening Feb. 25, will feature singers and a
production team from the Finnish National Opera, capped by baritone Jorma
Hynninen.;   VOCAL HEROES -- Closer to home, the Hidden Valley Music Seminars
in Carmel Valley will offer a double-barreled vocal master class Nov. 14 to
21, with stellar teachers (and international performing artists) Phyllis
Curtin and Hans Hotter on hand. For information, call (408) 659-3115.;  
PROGRAM NOTES -- The San Jose Symphony's new concertmaster, Byung-Woo Kim, a
resident of South San Francisco, will step into the spotlight for the first
time as conductor and violin soloist in Vivaldi's "The Seasons" (a quartet of
violin concertos) at the orchestra's Save Our Symphony benefit concerts Nov. 8
to 10 at Flint Center in Cupertino. George Cleve will lead Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony, the other work on the program.;   Offering unexpected competition
will be a Beethoven Ninth the following weekend (Nov. 17) in San Francisco's
Davies Hall, with the San Francisco Choral Society.;   The San Jose Chamber
Music Society must make do for a year, maybe two, without its founder, Larry
Bryan. Bryan is teaching in the United Arab Emirates.;   On a more
instrumental note, Fremont composer Frank La Rocca got a $15,000 fellowship
from the National Endowment for the Arts to compose a new piece for the
Alexander String Quartet.;   The San Francisco Girls Chorus has received a
$72,500 challenge grant from the NEA, to be matched three-for-one from other
sources.;   YOU DESERVE BAROQUE TODAY -- The biggest Mozart concert of all
time? The Dec. 5 "Requiem" in Birmingham, Ala., could be it. The program
promises more than 1,000 voices, plus the Alabama Symphony playing in a
17,000-seat coliseum, which is more commonly rented for circuses, rodeos and
tractor pulls.  </TEXT>
