<LEADPARA>  AUDIENCES for serious music are noticeably smaller this season because of the
recession and the war, but they are also unpredictable -- as proved by the
overflow crowd for the Guarneri String Quartet Wednesday night.;    An annual
staple at Stanford's Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the Guarneri had its first
sellout in years here, and 50 extra seats had to be set up on stage to
accommodate extra patrons, who were almost close enough to turn pages.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     If you were turned away, not to worry: You can catch the group next week in
Berkeley or in June at San Francisco's Mozart &amp; His Time Festival.;    The big
draw may have been something intangible about these routine selections,
leading off with an early Mozart quartet, then, of all things, an early
Beethoven trio.;    Or maybe it was an outpouring of sympathy for first
violinist Arnold Steinhardt, who has an arm more worrisome to chamber-music
buffs than Joe Montana's.;    In any case, the Guarneri came across like an
old-line European ensemble, with serious mien, high formality and a sense of
detachment. Yet the unpredictability of the group is a focal point.;    The
players are highly individualistic. As "High Fidelity," a 1989 film
documentary on the quartet demonstrated, the four may have been inseparable on
stage for the past 26 seasons, but off stage they're volatile. Arguments
punctuate even the choice of works.;    The excitement Wednesday was packed
into the second half. The popular Dvorak "American" Quartet, Op. 96, is a work
of high lyricism, encompassing both exuberance and despair. The music rolled
in the swell of pseudo-American (actually more Bohemian) melodies, propelled
by the contrasting sound textures of the foursome.;    The accompaniment of
violist Michael Tree and cellist David Soyer fairly danced in the Scherzo,
while leader Steinhardt, despite his nagging left-elbow inflammation, carried
the themes with flair and freedom.;    The encore, the Scherzo from Ravel's
String Quartet, was no less brilliant: The arch rhythms were full of wit,
whimsy and wicked vagaries.;    The first half of the program was less
satisfying.;    Steinhardt got much-needed rest during the fastidious String
Trio, Op. 9, No. 1, in G Major by Beethoven. The piece is moderately
interesting structurally but decidedly pale when contrasted to any of the
Beethoven quartets. The sound textures ran amok, perhaps because the players
overemphasized the dialogue between the sole violin (John Dalley) and the
viola-cello pair.;    Mozart's F Major Quartet, K. 168, is often cited as the
piece where the composer discovered Haydnesque counterpoint. But the fugato of
the Andante inspired another pregnant thought: Had the 17-year-old Mozart also
just discovered Bach's "The Musical Offering?";    Stanford's thorough printed
programs were not up to par: They indicated the Beethoven had one too many
movements and the Dvorak was credited with two too few.;    The Berkeley
program will feature the entire Ravel work, plus Dohnanyi's Serenade (for
three strings), Op. 10, and Beethoven's Op. 18, No. 4.; Guarneri String
Quartet;  Where: Zellerbach Auditorium, University of California, Berkeley;   
When: 8 p.m. next Friday;    Tickets: $13-$22. (415) 642-9988  </TEXT>
