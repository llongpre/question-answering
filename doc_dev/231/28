<HEAD>Orchestra To Play Fragment Of Beethoven's 10th Symphony</HEAD>

   The only surviving movement of Beethoven's 10th
symphony, which he was writing while on his deathbed in 1827, will
be played in public for the first time at a concert in London on
Oct. 18.
   The Sunday Times said the movement has been ``painstakingly and
brilliantly reconstructed'' from fragments of Beethoven's original
manuscripts by Dr. Barry Cooper, a lecturer in music at Aberdeen
University in Scotland.
   The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Walter
Weller, will perform the symphony's first movement at Royal
Festival Hall, a spokeswoman said.
   Beethoven had promised the 10th symphony to London audiences
eight days before his death and had assured a London friend that
sketches of the new work were ``already in my desk,'' the Sunday
Times said.
   But the paper said posthumous researchers failed to find any
retrievable music among Beethoven's possessions. Biographers
disregarded an account by his secretary, Karl Holz, who said the
composer sat at the piano and played him the opening of the 10th
symphony.
   Five years ago, The Sunday Times said, Cooper was doing research
in a West Berlin library and found a set of sketches that matched
Holz's reminiscences of the opening movement. Cooper's belief that
these were from the missing 10th symphony was reinforced by the
discovery of additional sketches in the Beethoven archive in Bonn,
the paper said.
   ``By combining the two sets,'' Cooper was quoted as saying, ``I
began to find what Beethoven had in mind for the first movement. I
tried to keep very close to the sketches, to reconstruct the
movement as Beethoven envisaged it at that time.
   ``I had to fill in some harmonies and compose myself a few
linking sections but I did not invent any new themes. Those are all
Beethoven's,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The Sunday Times said none of Beethoven's scraps of notes
contained more than 20 bars, just a few seconds of music. But the
paper said that by laying the scraps end to end, Cooper assembled
an entire movement lasting almost 14 minutes.
   While Beethoven's Ninth Symphony ``shocked contemporary
listeners with its unprecedented choral finale,'' The Sunday Times
said that the first movement of the 10th symphony ``threatens to
dissolve the traditional barriers between movements, inventing a
more fluid structure for the symphony.''
