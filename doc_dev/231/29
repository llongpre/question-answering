   Music of Grainger, Koechlin, Piston, Walton and Diepenbrock

   When a new recording technology such as the compact disc
matures, the listener benefits.
   Such major labels as Sony Classical may keep churning out
war-horse pieces by war-horse performers and rising stars making a
name.
   Even the usually admirable Telarc can perpetrate something as
shameful as a ``Best of Beethoven,'' as it did recently in a CD
consisting of movements from various Beethoven works in its catalog.
   But smaller companies, and lately some of the conglomerates, can
turn to other things: reissues of historical performances by
legendary artists on discs with improved sound, or CDs of music by
the lesser known composer, even the historical nonentity, which
broaden our knowledge and open us up to new delights.
   The latter category is examined here.
   Quick! Name a famous Dutch composer! Maybe Sweelinck comes to
mind, but since his lifetime (1562-1621), the Netherlands has not
had many composers of international renown _ until Alphons
Diepenbrock, who died at the age of 68 in 1921. A self-taught
follower of Wagner, he was influenced by late Beethoven and
Debussy. Diepenbrock had a literary bent and was a trained
classicist.
   It's not surprising, then, that a recent Chandos disc devoted to
him includes his overture to Aristophanes' play ``The Birds,'' the
Marsyas Concert Suite based on Greek mythology and the Elektra
Symphonic Suite. Included is the Hymn for Violin and Orchestra.
   Diepenbrock's appealing music is dramatic and extroverted. He
uses leitmotifs (short, recurring musical themes) and shows a
strong grasp of orchestral colors. The Residentie Orchestra of the
Hague, conducted by Hans Vonk, performs convincingly. Emmy Verhey
is the able soloist.
   Also in the dramatic vein is the same company's first volume of
Sir William Walton's film music on a disc full of sirs. Sir Neville
Marriner conducts the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, with Sir
John Gielgud narrating Sir Laurence Olivier's ``Hamlet.'' Also on
the disc is the music to ``As You Like It.''
   Like practically all film music, one hears traces of Stravinsky
and Wagner, and like all really good film music, one wants to see
the movie while listening to it.
   The project is worthy and makes good music accessible. The
various sections are well woven together by Christopher Palmer.
   Gielgud, as to be expected, reads portions of the text as a
knight of the theater. Unfortunately, his aged voice sounds
completely inappropriate for Hamlet. But that's fine if the words
are listened to for their music.
   Another composer of film music was the neglected French composer
Charles Koechlin (1867-1950), who turned to the form late in a life
that produced more than 200 works.
   The West German label Audite has released a disc of Koechlin's
oboe works, played by Lajos Lencses.
   The pieces are introspective, yet not intimate, composed in a
delicate and sometimes meandering style. Lencses is a graceful,
full-bodied oboist with a tendency to sound monochromatic.
   Koch International Classics has released a disc of Percy
Grainger orchestral pieces played by the Melbourne Symphony
Orchestra, conducted by Geoffrey Simon.
   The Melbourne-born Grainger (1882-1961) was friends with Delius
and Grieg, trained in Germany and lived most of his life in the
United States.
   His chief characteristic, amply displayed on this disc, lies in
a propensity to use folk tunes, which can sound irritating in big
orchestral treatments. It's a particular taste. The recorded sound
is slightly murky and the orchestra a little bland.
   Walter Piston uses another kind of indigenous music _ jazz _ in
his works, though more artfully so. One of the great American
composers, Piston (1894-1976) is a master of orchestral color,
whose symphonic music bubbles with syncopated energy.
   Gerard Schwarz, conducting the New York Chamber Symphony and
Seattle Symphony, brings an intensity and compactness of sound to
the second and sixth symphonies and Sinfonietta on an excellent
Delos recording.
