In the eyes of the public, but not academics, the major auction houses have
an outstanding reputation for scholarship. And yet their experts often
wrongly catalogue an item for sale. Often this makes little difference to
the price, but occasionally the percipient dealer can pick up for a hundred
pounds or so an object worth hundreds of thousands, even millions.
The most embarassing examples in recent years have involved Old Master
paintings and Renaissance bronzes, but in a specialist London book auction
last year an attentive browser came across a musical manuscript in a job lot
which looked as if it might be valuable. For a start there were six staves
on the page, which meant that it was English and pre-1720.
The lot cost little, but on May 26 Sotheby's hopes to make at least Pounds
300,000 from what its experts Dr Stephen Roe and Simon Maguire consider to
be the most interesting musical manuscript to have emerged in decades. The
small calf bound volume contains 21 pieces for the harpsichord in the hand
of Purcell, the only autograph keyboard music by the late 17th century
British composer yet known.
Pre-1700 autograph manuscripts are exceptionally rare. No one knows what
music in the hand of Palestrina or Scarlatti or Monteverdi looks like: no
certain examples have emerged. Hence the excitement over the Purcell. The
auction record is for another discovery, nine autograph symphonies by
Mozart, believed lost, which surfaced in 1987 and sold for Pounds 2.6m.
Fortunately for Sotheby's, and the vendor, Purcell, along with Byrd, is the
only British composer sought by the leading collectors. The fact that music
is an international language ensures that there is a global market, and
gives some protection from national recessions. But demand is selective.
Elgar and Vaughan Williams appeal little to the major German and Swiss
collectors, although Britten has some attracion. In the main the most
popular composers command the top prices - Mozart followed by Beethoven
(Pounds 1.1m for a piano sonata). And the major scores attract the keenest
interest: the market really arrived when Stravinsky's Rite of Spring sold
for Pounds 330,000 in 1982, at the height of a recession.
Like Old Masters and Impressionists the great musical scores - the Mozart,
Wagner and Puccini operas; the Beethoven string quartets; the Tchaikovsky
symphonies - are now mainly in museums and secure collections. But some
major works have yet to be pinned down. No one knows where Beethoven's
manuscript for the Hammerklavier sonata is, or whether it still exists.
Wagner's opera Rienzi is believed to have disappeared with Hitler when his
Berlin bunker was destroyed, but might have survived. Puccini's La Rondine
is another work which might leak into the saleroom one day.
The inflation in prices has naturally attracted the forgers and fraudsters.
Some of the most celebreated recent examples, like the apparant emergence of
some unknown Haydn sonatas last year, were just attempts to make
presumptious scholars look foolish. As soon as the actual manuscripts,
rather than photographs, were studied there could be no mistaking the 20th
century paper. But Christie's had to quickly withdraw half a dozen lots from
its recent auction, and there are always attempts to add a forged signature
to a composer's printed score or photograph.
Sotheby's auction is its largest ever in the field, with over 430 lots,
including manuscripts and letters by Haydn, Beethoven, Mahler and Verdi. The
recession has depressed demand, but in the main musical manuscripts have
borne up well.
