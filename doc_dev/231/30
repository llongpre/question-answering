<LEADPARA>  AROUND San Jose, Napoleon is getting a lot more credit than he deserves as the
person who inspired Beethoven's "Emperor" Concerto (No. 5).;   "Some say
Napoleon had a hand in Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5," trumpets the
misleading ad for the San Jose Symphony's concerts this weekend, identifying
the "Emperor" of the title as Bonaparte himself.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In fact, Beethoven never called the piece "Emperor." And by the time he
composed it (1809), Napoleon was probably the last emperor on earth who'd get
a dedication from Beethoven.;   The composer's admiration for the Frenchman
ended abruptly six years earlier, when the enraged composer ripped up the
title-page dedication of the "Eroica" Symphony after hearing that the little
general had taken on the imperial mantle.;   When Beethoven was writing the
concerto, his city of Vienna had just been conquered by Napoleon, about whom
the composer wrote, "Now he, too, will trample on all the rights of man."
Beethoven had just one word to sum up those days of occupation: "Misery.";  
BACK FROM RETIREMENT -- Milton Salkind, 75, thought he was retiring in 1990
when he left the presidency of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. But
now he's back as acting president after the precipitous departure of Stephen
Brown.;   In addition, Salkind is artistic adviser of a newly merged
orchestra. The new San Francisco Chamber Symphony combines the Sinfonia San
Francisco (which abruptly fired conductor Sam Cristler in April) and the
Chamber Symphony of San Francisco (whose conductor moved to Uruguay).;   A
music director is being sought for the new amalgam. Meanwhile, the season will
open Jan. 27 with guest conductors at Herbst Theatre. These include Stanford's
Robert Black, who will lead the orchestra on April 20, 1992, and the San Jose
Symphony's Peter Susskind, who will conduct on May 18.;   FEW CHAMBERS PLAY ON
-- Also prominent in the shrinking ranks of San Francisco chamber orchestras
is Artea, led by Dusan (also known as symphony violinist Dusan Bobb).;   As
recently as two years ago, the city's roster featured five chamber orchestras,
including the San Francisco Chamber Orchestra and Parlante. San Mateo also had
the Bay Chamber Orchestra.;   On more of an uptick down the Peninsula is Eric
Kujawsky and his Redwood Symphony. In a concert at Flint Center on Oct. 11,
the group will become the second American orchestra (after the New York
Philharmonic) to perform Leonard Bernstein's last symphonic piece, "Concerto
for Orchestra.";   "Last year, while we were playing some Bernstein works at
Flint Center, Bernstein died," recalls Kujawsky. "It was eerie -- and sad. I
idolized him."  </TEXT>
