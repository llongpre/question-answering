The percussionist sits behind a large setup of Japanese instruments. Next to 
him is the yokobue (traditional Japanese flute) player. Accompanying them are a 
piano and double bass. Meanwhile, the fifth performer, a calligrapher, is 
painting large Japanese characters while producing an assortment of groans and 
other vocalizations. 
</P>
<P>
This mix of Oriental, Occidental, music and art -- Isao Mitsushita's "Kizuna" 
-- will be a part of the opening program Sunday for the fifth annual Chamber 
Music L.A. Festival at Japan America Theatre. A markedly different approach 
from the four previous festivals, the series of five concerts over two weeks, 
titled "East/West Encounters," presents music by familiar Western composers 
such as Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven but also includes a local premiere at every 
concert of a contemporary Japanese composer. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to just present the Japanese music," explained Yukiko Kamei, 
artistic director of the festival. "I wanted to present the new works along 
with Western classics. I feel the same about all contemporary works, not just 
those that are Japanese. Presenting the unfamiliar along with the familiar 
tends to make the familiar classical sounds fresher." 
</P>
<P>
A former student of and assistant to the late Jasha Heifetz, Kamei, 41, began 
studying violin as a child in Tokyo where she was born. Four years ago she 
developed an interest in traditional Japanese music. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard Japanese music on the radio when I was growing up, but I only studied 
Western music," Kamei said. "I never felt very close to the sound of the 
traditional music. As I grew older and performed contemporary music more and 
more, I started to listen to Japanese music differently. Suddenly, I recognized 
a closeness to the music and was surprised to feel that in myself. It felt very 
natural to me. So I can't tell whether my interest is more a coming of age or 
going back to my roots." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Shunsuke Kurakata (also a participant in the festival as a 
pianist), directs a concert series in San Francisco devoted to new music from 
Japan, where all but one of the pieces for the Los Angeles festival were first 
heard by Kamei. The other work, Tadao Sawai's "Homura," written in 1974 for 
17-string koto and koto ensemble, will receive its West Coast premiere May 24 
and was discovered at another festival for contemporary Japanese music in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles gives premiere performances of Japanese works at Monday Evening 
Concerts and at CalArts, but there is no concentrated effort here as there is 
in New York and San Francisco," said Kamei. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I wasn't looking for premieres and was surprised to see that these 
pieces had never been performed in Los Angeles. I was happy enough to have the 
work of five renowned Japanese composers." 
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese works to be performed include Toru Takemitsu's "Entre-temps" 
(1986) for oboe and string quartet, Toshi Ichiyanagi's "Paganini Personal" 
(1982) for marimba and piano and Maki Ishii's "A Gleam of Time" (1983) for solo 
harp. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita, who plans to attend the festival, will present his music on 
Sunday's program, "Kaze-no-rosho" (1988) for solo yokobue (a Japanese flute) 
performed by local musician Michiko Akao and "Kizuna" (1985) for yokobue, 
percussion, bass, piano and a calligrapher. 
</P>
<P>
"Calligraphy is usually a very quiet activity," says San Francisco-based artist 
Shioh Kato, who will serve as calligrapher in the Matsushita piece. 
</P>
<P>
"But this time I'll be making vocal sounds, and movement will be involved." 
</P>
<P>
Kato will paint three large Japanese characters which translate into English as 
"flying across the universe" while the ensemble plays. He also participated in 
the U.S. premiere of the work three years ago in San Francisco, where he has 
lived for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Western works programmed along with the Matsushita premiere will be Haydn's 
Quartet, Opus 76, No. 2, and Beethoven's Septet in E-flat. Other European 
composers represented in the festival are Mozart, Schumann, Mendelssohn, 
Shostakovich, Dohnanyi, Dvorak, Schubert, Saint-Saens and Brahms.
