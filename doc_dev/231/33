   Raisa Gorbachev on Monday toured the
narrow hallways and cramped rooms of Ludwig van Beethoven's
18th-century birthplace and said the composer occupies a special
place in Russian hearts.
   Beethoven ``is one of the world's greatest musical geniuses,''
Mrs. Gorbachev said as she visited the modest structure on the
fringes of Bonn's historic old town.
   The wife of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev toured the
house, now a museum, in a ceremony formalizing an exchange program
of young musicians from the Soviet Union and West Germany.
   She was accompanied by Hannelore Kohl, the wife of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
   Outside the museum, about 20 demonstrators huddled on a nearby
sidewalk carrying placards protesting alleged Soviet atrocities in
Afghanistan.
   The protest was overshadowed by hundreds of well-wishers who
shouted ``Raisa! Raisa!'' and waved as she arrived by limousine.
   After a brief ceremony that included a performance of several of
Beethoven's works, the two first ladies toured the tiny green house
now surrounded by tall modern buildings and busy shops.
   ``It's amazing that such great men can be born in such small
rooms,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said.
   ``Beethoven is in all of our hearts,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said,
referring to the Soviet people's appreciation of the German master.
   During the tour, Mrs. Gorbachev displayed intense interest in the
house's history and appearance. At one point she stumbled in the
courtyard, but Mrs. Kohl quickly grabbed her arm to keep her from
falling.
   Mrs. Kohl told her Beethoven was born in a part of the house
behind an inner courtyard that was heavily damaged by bombs during
World War II. She said restoration efforts were continuing there.
   The museum in the front part of the building is open to the
public and displays period furniture, a piano used by Beethoven, and
other artifacts.
   Beethoven was born in Bonn in 1770, and lived there until age 13.
He died in 1827.
