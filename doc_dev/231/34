<LEADPARA>  BUCKING all the recession trends is the Bay Area's incredible Philharmonia
Baroque Orchestra. One of the handful of period-instruments orchestras outside
Europe, it is going for baroque in 1991-92, expanding from six to seven
concert sets and growing from 30 to 39 subscription concerts, on the strength
of rousing turnouts this year.;    In addition to concerts in San Francisco,
Berkeley, San Rafael and at Palo Alto's First United Methodist Church, it will
also perform all its sets at Walnut Creek's Regional Center for the Arts,
which opened last fall.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The group, however, will not make a national tour.;    The season opens
Sept. 19, with Handel's oratorio "Theodora" in its West Coast premiere. The
work will be recorded with the same cast, capped by Drew Minter, Lorraine
Hunt, and Jeff Thomas. Recordings also will include a package of Handel arias
by soprano Hunt, entitled "Arias for Durastante.";    The season will end with
the Philharmonia going (relatively) modern with Beethoven's "Eroica" Symphony.
The season will be conducted from beginning to end by the bright-eyed Nicholas
McGegan, who clearly has the method to the baroque madness.;    MAKING TRACKS:
On an equally fast track is the music director of the Bay Area Women's
Philharmonic, JoAnn Falletta. She has been named music director of the
Virginia Symphony in Norfolk, starting July 1, beating out, among others,
Richard Buckley, formerly head of the late, lamented Oakland Symphony, and
Leif Bjaland, formerly one of the conductors at the San Francisco Symphony.;  
 Falletta will give up the Denver Chamber Orchestra but will head three
ensembles at once, including the Long Beach Symphony.;    In 1991-92 the
Women's Philharmonic will present four world premieres, by Libby Larsen, Lucia
Hwong, Joelle Wallach and Sarah Dawson. Larsen's dance piece "Ghosts of an Old
Ceremony" will be presented at the University of California, Berkeley's
Zellerbach Hall, with dancers from ODC/San Francisco. Featured women composers
from the past include Lili Boulanger, Germaine Tailleferre, Amelie Julie
Candeille and Fanny Mendelssohn.;    A RARE BEETHOVEN FIND -- The Beethoven
Center at San Jose State University has just acquired the earliest printing of
Beethoven's first three piano sonatas, Op. 2. Only three copies are known to
be extant. Of special interest are the numerous errors in the printing, which
have been corrected by various hands.;    Center director William Meredith is
ecstatic about the 1796 score, which was bought through a European dealer from
unknown owners. "It's the only first-edition copy in the country of
Beethoven's first piano sonatas. Until this came out, Beethoven was famous
only as a fortepianist, not as a composer.";    Other reasons to celebrate:
four encores and a standing ovation at the center's April 16 lieder recital by
German tenor Peter Schreier, and two $5,000 gifts for the center's endowment
from Ben Passen and founder Ira F. Brilliant.;    COMPOSERS, COMPOSERS --
Santa Clara composer Henry Mollicone had two world premieres within nine days.
In addition to his "Adventures of Alice" at San Jose Dance Theater on April
12, he had "Five Songs" premiered soon after in St. Louis, with conductor
Leonard Slatkin, no less, as the piano accompanist.;    San Francisco composer
Kirke Mechem, best known for his "Tartuffe" hit at Opera San Jose several
years ago, is back from the Soviet Union, having made history there: He became
the first living American composer ever featured in a symphonic evening
devoted entirely to his works. Corrick Brown of Santa Rosa conducted the USSR
Radio-TV Large-Concert Orchestra in a program built around Mechem's Symphonies
Nos. 1 and 2. The toughest part was not the music, says Mechem, a 1951
Stanford graduate, but the interview he did there in connection with the
concert: He did it partly in hastily assembled Russian.;    ANNIVERSARIES --
The wildly over-celebrated bicentennial of Mozart's death, coming up Dec. 5,
1991, is eclipsing several major anniversaries of composers, including the
centennials of Sergei Prokofiev (April 23), Arthur Honegger (March 10, 1992)
and Darius Milhaud (Sept. 4, 1992), and the 80th birthday of the very active
Italian-American composer Gian Carlo Menotti, on July 7 of this year. The
unfortunate result: Those four are being overlooked in concert tributes, while
Mozart thrives.;    Prokofiev, perhaps, had the biggest misfortune. Even his
death date is overlooked, because he died the same day as his countryman,
tyrant Josef Stalin, in 1953.  </TEXT>
