The prospect of dredging up adjectives with which to praise the Juilliard 
String Quartet at the top of its form has become wearying, although "probing, 
lush-toned, technically masterful" could easily be recycled to describe their 
playing of the Beethoven Quartet in B flat, Opus 130, on Sunday afternoon at 
Caltech's Beckman Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
What went awry in their encounter with the Second Quartet of Leos Janacek is a 
good deal easier to describe. 
</P>
<P>
While Janacek's knotty textures were clarified to a quite remarkable degree by 
these brilliant and brainy artists, there were too many slips to make this 
disjunct, ferocious, moonstruck but by no means incoherent thriller achieve its 
full impact on Sunday. 
</P>

First violinist Robert Mann encountered intonational difficulties in the 
opening movement; in the finale, second violinist Joel Smirnoff scrambled his 
strummings on their first appearance whereas they were swamped by Joel 
Krosnick's cello -- which elsewhere proved uncharacteristically faint-toned -- 
the second time around. Leaving only Samuel Rhodes' succulent viola playing 
unscathed amid the Juilliard's losing battle with Janacek. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, the excitement of the first movement -- and thereby of the work as a 
whole -- peaked too early. This is, after all, music in which climaxes are as 
common as crescendos in other composers' creations. 
</P>
<P>
The program opened with a jaunty, not-quite-elegant traversal of Haydn's 
Quartet in G, Opus 77, No. 1, and the Coleman Concerts audience was sent home 
happy with Beethoven's aforementioned Opus 130, with its brief, jolly second 
ending rather than the massive, nerve-rattling "Grosse Fuge." HERBERT GLASS
