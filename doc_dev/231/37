Only four months to go. During the Wigmore Hall's year-long closure various
of the other musical venues in London have been putting on recitals, but
none has been able to offer the combination of intimate acoustics and
friendly atmosphere which makes that hall so precious.
From time to time the Barbican endeavours to promote itself again as a
recital hall and the past year has been a clear opportunity. The sound is
perhaps less poor for chamber-music than one might have feared, as the
acoustic gains in clarity as the number of players gets smaller. But nothing
can stop the hall looking and sounding empty when there is only a handful of
people on stage.
For the celebrity recital by the Takacs Quartet Barbican last Wednesday no
attempt was made to disguise the chilliness of the setting. The players sat
centre-stage, surrounded by a vast expanse of deserted platform. The upper
tiers of the auditorium looked to have been closed off. At quiet moments the
sound became unhelpfully distant and it was fortunate that so fine a group
was playing, as the audience was compelled to sit in silence.
This is a quartet with the ability to make its presence felt in any hall.
The players' tone is well matched, their style unexaggerated. Warmth and
lyricism are their hallmarks, although just occasionally there was a
seasoning of their native Hungarian paprika in Bartok's First Quartet and
also the scherzo of Haydn's B Flat Quartet, Op. 76 No. 4, where the vigorous
stamping rhythm was taken up rather noisily by the leader's left foot.
In their performance of Schubert's 'Death and the Maiden' Quartet neurosis
was held at bay. Where the Lindsay Quartet seizes the music by the throat,
or the Amadeus was wiry and tensile, the Takacs still find time to shape
broad lyrical phrases (the elegiac opening of the slow movement was coloured
with particular sensitivity). The players will be hosting their own festival
at the Wigmore Hall in 1994, so they clearly recognise where their true
London home lies.
A word of recommendation, too, for the Beethoven Trio, who gave the first of
three recitals at the Purcell Room on Friday. Each of these programmes
features a new work by an Austrian composer together with Mozart and
Beethoven trios, for which the players are winning an increasing reputation
at home and abroad.
To judge from the standard of performance in this first recital there is no
reason to question those high opinions. The Beethoven Trio is a meeting of
three equal musicians, less dominated by the pianist than is often the case
in more starry ensembles, a trio of young and fresh interpreters, able to
build long paragraphs of music into statements of some depth and import.
The new work on this occasion was Gerhard Schedl's Second Piano Trio,
subtitled 'Lamento', which takes the music of the two Armed Men from
Mozart's Die Zauberflote and sets isolated phrases from it afloat in a sea
of vaguely expressionist sounds: not a piece of strong individual merit,
although at 10 minutes it did not outstay its welcome. The third and final
recital, with a new work by Thomas Pernes, follows on Friday.

In a Purcell Room agreeably tarted up with paintings from the Arts Council
collection, including Gillian Eyres's eye-catching 'Spica' and a yellow and
blob-red Caulfield, the English tenor Adrian Thompson and pianist Iain
Burnside gave a recital on Thursday, fifth in a song series which would
normally be staged, one presumes, in the Wigmore Hall.
Certainly the Wigmore acoustics would have been more accommodating to Mr
Thompson's searingly powerful instrument. He makes a clarion sound which is
apt to go frantic with decibels in upper register climaxes and produce a
cuttingly painful effect in the confinement of the Purcell Room, which oddly
seems to stop the voice dead without muting it.
Passionate and in many ways persuasive, Mr Thompson's recital problem was
sheer vocal bulk. From the start he was overwhelming his pianist as well as
flattening his listeners in a Schubert group, though the passionate,
storm-lashed Der Schiffer (The Boatman) positively benefited from the
ferocious despatch. Among a selection of Hugo Wolf's Morike settings, Der
Tambour, a drummer boy's fantasy of food, and Storchenbotschaft
(Stork-tidings), with its bitonal piano part figuring the shepherd's creaky
hut (and anticipating the methods of Britten), made a vivid impression. An
eine Aolsharfe (To an Aeolian Harp) received a strong, solemn delivery.
I found the five Gerald Finzi songs after the interval dullish, and the four
Samuel Barber's not much less so: Sure on this Shining Night sets words by
James Agee but isn't a patch on Knoxville. Mr Thompson came on in chef's
togs for Leonard Bernstein's Faure send-up, La bonne cuisine, the four
song-texts being French recipes.
The 33-year old Russian conductor Yakov Kreizberg (he emigrated to the USA
in 1976) made his London debut on Sunday night with the Philharmonia
Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall in an all-Russian programme. It was not
an exceptionally interesting programme, but Kreizberg made it uncommonly
gripping and the orchestra's playing was of the highest stylishness
throughout.
The Polonaise from Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin was a brief but
cracking opener and its brilliant bluster was no sooner in our ears than
forcibly contradicted by the bleak depression of Shostakovich's second cello
concerto, Op. 126, a late work written for Rostropovich in 1966 between the
thirteenth and fourteenth symphonies.
Our soloist was the American Lynn Harrell (in the news because of his
appointment as next principal of the Royal Academy of Music), and no more
searching or finely shaped interpretation could have been asked for.
Harrell's tone is as clear as it is expressive, as minutely governed as it
is boldly (and with seeming effortlessness) projected. Shostakovich's
invention is not perhaps of the most distinguished in this work, which is
just a very good performance 'on the Shostakovich'; but Harrell read in a
marvellous intensity everywhere and the orchestra answered Kreizberg's
evident commitment with a high-tension accompaniment notable for individual
excellences (the sturdy peculiar horn calls at the end of the first
movement, the split-second demented xylophone interjections of the scherzo)
as well as formidable group cohesiveness.
Kreizberg cuts an impressive figure on the podium: unflamboyant but intense,
dapper but keenly effectual. His account of Rakhmaninov's second symphony
was beautiful, profoundly persuasive (the work can easily become a romantic
thrash) and, in its slow movement, quite overwhelming. The string textures
of the slow introduction were built up with glistening precision, and brass
layers superadded with a disciplined ear for balance. The performance of the
scherzo was masterly; one blessed Kreizberg for the tiny touches of violin
portamento. Michael Whight's quiet, poised clarinet solo in the spacious
Adagio took our breath away, if not his; and the movement went its noble way
'among the deepening shades'.
