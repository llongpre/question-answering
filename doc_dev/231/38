FT  01 NOV 94 / Arts: British fanfare for Beethoven - Concert

Under orders to help promote new music, the London orchestras have each come
up with their own solution. The Philharmonia has introduced a series
entitled 'Music of Today' timed at 6pm before the evening's concert - a
clever idea, as it can draw on a captive audience, while leaving the
orchestra free to programme the standard classics in its main concerts.
So far the new music seems to have been concentrated on weekends. On
Saturday a reasonable number of Beethoven-lovers, gathering for the start of
the symphony cycle that night, was attracted to the earlier event: three
short pieces by British composers all in their mid-30s. An opening fanfare
was provided by James MacMillan. Then came Mark-Anthony Turnage's jazzy
romp, Release, and Steve Martland's Shoulder to shoulder, a more disciplined
exercise in post-Stravinskyan rhythmic battery. Each was a useful thumb-nail
sketch of its creator, though not more.
None of them will have stolen the thunder from Nikolaus Harnoncourt's
Beethoven cycle, which started its two-week journey that evening. For the
Philharmonia, which went down in history as the orchestra that marked the
Beethoven bicentenary with a symphony cycle under the revered Otto
Klemperer, this was quite a jump.
On the face of it Harnoncourt is the antithesis of everything Klemperer
stood for: a former standard-bearer of the 'authentic' brigade, tireless in
overturning accepted ideas, controversial, dynamic. His Beethoven with the
Chamber Orchestra of Europe, both live here in London and on record, has
made a name for itself with its drive and clarity. Teamed with the full-size
Philharmonia, Harnoncourt is able to replicate the drive, but the clarity
does not come so easily.
The First Symphony opened with two unexpectedly thick-sounding, heavy
movements. Then the scherzo and finale exploded with energy. 'Authentic'
Beethoven conductors - especially Norrington - have found a Haydn-like
humour in this early symphony, but as far as Harnoncourt is concerned,
Beethoven bursts forth fully-formed, a tempestuous symphonic composer
heading for battle.
The 'Eroica' is more Harnoncourt's piece. He relishes its determination to
fight until the issues are resolved. Some of the climaxes reached a high
pitch of intensity. Although there were rough patches of playing, one can
imagine Harnoncourt in rehearsal, knowing exactly what he wants and going
over every passage until he has stamped his authority on each note. His
Beethoven is entirely his own, which should make the rest of this cycle one
to recommend. In that respect he is as worthy a successor to Klemperer as
the Philharmonia could have found.
Beethoven symphony cycle at the Royal Festival Hall in London and Symphony
Hall in Birmingham until November 13.
