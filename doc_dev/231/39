Other arts organizations may grouse about the difficulty of raising money in 
this county's highly competitive market, but not the Orange County Philharmonic 
Society. At the society's meeting in Newport Beach Monday night, executive 
director Erich Vollmer reported that contributions were up 64% from 1988 to 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
By far the bulk of the rise from $406,067 in 1988 to $667,257 in 1989 came from 
contributions from individuals, corporations and private foundations. 
Government support rose a modest $641 from the $52,657 figure in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Vollmer credited the increase to "hard work." 
</P>
<P>
"We really had a challenge, and the board met it," Vollmer said Tuesday. "I 
think it's also an indication that we were wise in creating the position of 
director of development. It was long overdue." Eve R. Henderson was appointed 
development director in October. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case where no one person deserves the lion's share of the credit," 
Vollmer added. "It was truly a group effort. It was nonprofit at its best." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the society ended the year with a small deficit of $16,588 in a 
$2.3-million budget. "That's piddling, after what we dealt with last year," 
Vollmer said. The amount was left over from a debt of $46,910 that resulted 
from co-sponsorship of the New World Music Festival at the Performing Arts 
Center and UC Irvine in the summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Vollmer added that 54,806 people attended 22 society-sponsored concerts at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, for what officials said was 
an 86% hall-occupancy rate.
