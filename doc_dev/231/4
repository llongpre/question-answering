Not old Cherubini the Franco-Italian opera composer, but the young(ish),
all-German Cherubini Quartet, who are delivering the complete 'cycle' of
Beethoven quartets at the Wigmore Hall. Though they have not yet recorded
anything by their eponym, their recent recording of all Mendelssohn's
quartets has excited admiration and delight.
On Wednesday, during the first three numbers of Beethoven's opus 18, one
could hear what excellent Mendelssohn interpreters they must be. About their
Beethoven I was less persuaded. Since they are not merely born-again
Mendelssohnians but highly cultivated performers, they offered many passing
rewards and suave insights; transparent balance too, unimpeachable tempi, a
cool, intellectual grasp of structure - and even some calculatedly playful
moments. Yet there was never much muscle, despite their incisive fortissimo
playing, nor much sign of young Beethoven's truculent thrust.
Their leader, Christoph Poppen, is a violinist with a soft, sensitive timbre
of no great amplitude. In the romantic drama of the 'Adagio affetuoso ed
appassionata' of the F major quartet, for example, while the lower strings
grew properly forceful and doomy his own song - which should carry warmly
over it all - remained gentle and wan. In the G major, where Beethoven plays
at being gracious whilst emitting constant hints of something more
rumbustious, graciousness was all.
More typical of their best strengths was their subito diminuendo, an artful
drop into keen whispers, which they exploited often; also their delicate,
knowing indentation of musical paragraphs, accomplished with unanimous
fluency. Finesse of that kind is ideal for Mendelssohn, a precociously
conservative composer who never needed to advertise himself, whose radical
turns were always disguised by perfect polish. The Beethoven of the opus 18
quartets, however, was determined to show not only how well he had mastered
the arch-Classical medium, after Haydn and Mozart, but how much unfamiliar,
unsettling power he could invest in it.
That was scarcely to be felt here. At the Cherubini's hands, the young Turk
was made to sound like a serenely assured old pro. Far from aiming to
recapture the original force of the music, they dressed it reverently in
period costume. It should be interesting, at least, to hear how they adapt
their pretty style to the towering last quartets which come at the end of
their cycle on July 7, 9 and 10.
