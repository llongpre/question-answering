   A 15-minute piece of music apparently
reconstructed from fragments Beethoven wrote for a Tenth Symphony
that he never finished received mixed reviews today from critics.
   The piece was the result of five years' work by Barry Cooper, a
researcher at Aberdeen University in Scotland. Played by Britain's
Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, and conducted by Walter
Weller, it had its public premiere Tuesday night at a concert at
London's Royal Festival Hall.
   Edward Greenfield, writing in the London newspaper The Guardian,
wrote: ``Though even Dr. Cooper would never assert that it was what
Beethoven would finally have delivered ... I marvel that the long
Andante sections which framed this unexpectedly structured movement
are so genuinely Beethovenian.''
   Paul Griffiths of The Times of London wrote: ``Proper judgment
of how Dr. Barry Cooper has interpreted Beethoven's presumed
sketches for a presumed Tenth Symphony will have to await
publication of the score: his statement that `about two-thirds of
it is based directly on Beethoven's sketches' begs an awful lot of
questions, especially when we are concerned with a composer of such
notoriously untidy working habits.''
   Anthony Payne wrote in another London paper, The Independent:
``The audience was only mildly enthusiastic. In truth, the music
sounded half-formed.''
   Payne added: ``There has always been speculation about sketches
for a Tenth Symphony. Until the mid-1980s, however, no scholar had
been prepared to identify much material from the 8,000 or so pages
of sketches which Beethoven left at his death (in 1827) as possibly
relating to the mythical Tenth.''
   Violinist Sir Yehudi Menuhin, who conducted the second half of
the concert after the piece was played, said: ``I think it is a
valuable work. It is certainly Beethoven. I have huge admiration
and respect for Dr. Cooper, who has done an extremely good job.''
   Cooper told reporters the years researching the musical mystery
uncovered sketches that ``struck me as being particularly good,
even by Beethoven's standards.''
   He said Beethoven's plans to finish the symphony were mentioned
in a letter written eight days before his death. ``He actually
offered it to the Royal Philharmonic Society'' of Britain, Cooper
said, ``And now they've got it, or as much as there is of it.''
   Cooper added, ``I think the overall result has got enough really
good Beethoven in it to make it very well worth hearing.''
