Fullerton High School on a Sunday afternoon might seem an unlikely place for a 
winner of two major international piano competitions to make his Southern 
California debut. Nevertheless, there he was, Irish pianist John O'Conor, 
winner of both the International Beethoven Competition and the Bosendorfer 
Piano Competition, ready to perform at the appointed time and place for the 
North Orange County Community Concert Assn. 
</P>
<P>
His program was a strong one, consisting of two sonatas by Beethoven -- the 
"Waldstein" Sonata, Opus 53 and the Sonata Opus 31, No.1 -- the Four Piano 
Pieces, Opus 119 by Brahms and Book One of Debussy's "Images." Though hampered 
by the gymnasium-like acoustics of Plummer Auditorium and an edgy-toned piano, 
O'Conor managed intelligent and communicative readings. 
</P>
<P>
The two Beethoven sonatas framed the program. O'Conor began with the relatively 
neglected Opus 31, No. 1 in a crisp, straightforward account that quietly 
revealed the work's gentle humor and untroubled discourse. His attention was 
directed toward subtleties of dynamic and rhythmic clarity. 
</P>
<P>
His "Waldstein" Sonata was a different matter. He attacked the first movement 
with considerable aggression at a very brisk pace. Driving energy was the main 
concern. But he didn't leave detail behind, and moments of repose, such as his 
warm, roundly shaped playing of the second theme, gave his reading dimension. 
Variety of color and articulation marked his serene, spacious account of the 
Finale. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahms pieces were intimately communicated with a clear, understated 
lyricism. Each was a concise, carefully molded statement. O'Conor gave the 
three pieces from Debussy's "Images" an elegant, multicolored, atmospheric 
performance. In both the Brahms and the Debussy works, climaxes had breadth and 
controlled emotion; O'Conor never stooped to impress through piano-slamming 
sonority or glittering virtuosity. One's concentration was always firmly drawn 
to the music. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke briefly before each work in much the same intelligent and personable 
manner in which he played them. His sole encore was a beautiful, simple 
nocturne by fellow Dubliner John Field.
