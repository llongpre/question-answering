<LEADPARA>  'I NEVER thought I would . . . see it," says German tenor Peter Schreier,
still incredulous over the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of
his country.;    Schreier, for decades the definitive interpreter of Bach's
vocal music and more recently a conductor as well, is paying his first visit
to San Jose, for a recital of 19th-century lieder (German songs) tonight at
San Jose State Concert Hall.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The well-traveled artist, who was born in East Germany, has hardly been
affected personally by his Communist-led country's absorption into what was
West Germany. But the region's musical life has suffered substantially, he
says. Along with new political and artistic freedoms have come economic
deprivation.;    "Overnight, the artistic life became worse," he told the
Mercury News in an interview last week. "The public has no money for concert
tickets, and the halls that were formerly full have empty seats. Also there's
no money to hire first-class (concert) artists.;    "Because of the
uncertainty, the number of concerts has dropped. And I believe that some
smaller symphonies out in the provinces will become victims of the economic
crisis . . . though none have shut down yet.";    Asked to what extent
limitations, either overt or subtle, were imposed on musicians under the East
German regime, the Dresden-based lyric tenor said, "Very little, actually.
There were certain political considerations (to keep in mind) -- for instance,
not to perform often in West Berlin or in Israel. And whenever I came home
from abroad, I did not dare tell friends how marvelous it was over there.";   
For decades the veteran singer was one of East Germany's most traveled
artists. He has made more than 200 recordings, ranging from Bach and Mozart to
Wagner and Weill.;    He said there were no restrictions in the East on
performing music by Hitler favorites such as Wagner or Richard Strauss. "Once,
in 1985, we were even able to perform the opera 'Palestrina' by the Nazi-era
composer Hans Pfitzner," he noted.;    When Schreier returned home from tours
in the West, he had to pay a percentage of his earnings to the East German
concert agency. "It was less than half (the total)," he said, looking for a
silver lining.;    Last week Schreier was busy doing his world-renowned
specialty, singing the part of the Evangelist in Bach's "St. Matthew's
Passion" with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. But this time he added a new
twist: He was also the conductor for the performance.;    He began his
conducting at midcareer, back in 1973 in East Berlin, and since then he has
added more and more symphony orchestras to his list of engagements. Oddly
enough, he conducts little opera.;    "Opera's problematic," he observed, "and
the musical expectations are seldom fulfilled. There are so many potential
difficulties, and you may have another performance eight days later, with no
rehearsal in between. By then, concentration is lost.";    Here in San Jose,
Schreier will sing song cycles by Schumann and Beethoven, plus six Beethoven
songs on texts by Goethe. Of special interest will be Schumann's "Poet's Love"
("Dichterliebe"), a piece so popular, noted Schreier, "that it's almost
whistled in the streets.";    He will also sing Beethoven's "To the Distant
Beloved," which some analysts believe was for the same woman who inspired his
anguished "Immortal Beloved" love letter -- most likely Antonia von Brentano,
according to recent research.;    The embers of the composer's complex affairs
of the heart will be stirred again in a pre-concert lecture, "Beethoven in
Love," given by Dr. William Meredith an hour before the concert.;    This
summer Schreier will give recitals in London and at the Salzburg Festival,
with piano virtuoso Andras Schiff as accompanist.;    How does he keep his
repertory fresh?;    "I always think of each evening of lieder as being a
whole new experience. In addition, I frequently change accompanists and let
myself be inspired by each new pianist-collaborator.";    His pianist tonight
is Armen Guzelimian from the University of Southern California.; Peter
