WHEN Riccardo Chailly announced a Rossini encore to mark the composer's
bicentenary at the end of Monday's concert, somebody in the row behind me
exclaimed, 'But the Beethoven was just like Rossini already]'. Whether out
of jest or annoyance it was not clear, but there was some truth in his
remark.
The Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra's transformation is complete. The days
when it played with deeply-considered sobriety under Bernard Haitink seem a
long way off. With Chailly, the orchestra still gives serious performances,
but it is serious about different things - about clarity and beauty,
lightness of touch and Italian effervescence.
In the two concerts they gave in Edinburgh, nothing suited Chailly and his
players better than the 20th-century works, Webern's Passacaglia and Berio's
Requies. The Berio, an elegy upon the death of the composer's former wife,
moves like an angel in flight. Its quicksilver blendings of wind and strings
float along as though no bass sound can hold them down and finally they
disappear altogether in a flutter-tongued flute solo. The piece could not
have been played with more ravishing delicacy.
Whether the same virtues are as welcome in Haydn and Beethoven is
questionable. There was no jovial rough-and-tumble in Chailly's perfectly
manicured delivery of Haydn's 'Farewell' Symphony. For example, it is
difficult to give the surprise ending of the Minuet any punch, when every
twist of the music has been prepared so assiduously in advance.
In Chailly's hands, both Haydn with his earthy humour and the reputedly
uncouth Beethoven became cultured gentlemen. The latter's Fourth Symphony,
the main work in the first concert, was exquisite in every detail, but it
lacked guts and drive.
One wanted to go up on stage, grasp the drumsticks and give the timpani a
jolly good thwack. Only an Italian, though, could make the slow movement
sing so eloquently. And the finale was marvellously lucid, with a twinkle in
the eye.
For the Beethoven work in the second concert, the conductor had chosen his
partner well in Maria Joao Pires. Neither is the type of performer to make
Beethoven sound ponderous when he is not in the mood to be. Their combined
sensitivities resulted in a beguiling performance of the Fourth Piano
Concerto, and Pires, in particular, managed to commune with the soul of the
music without sounding in the least precious.
Then to Tchaikovsky, the festival's omnipresent composer of the year.
Panache, virtuosity and plain force, all had to be brought into play here,
as Chailly can when he wants to, and the Fifth Symphony went with plenty of
excitement, wanting only the remarkable passion that the St Petersburg
Philharmonic had brought to its native Tchaikovsky when visiting the week
before.
These reservations apart, Chailly is a good musician and the Amsterdam
orchestra sounds as impeccably groomed as ever. Their Rossini encore,
incidentally, was a delight.
When the Royal Concertgebouw arrives in London, I recommend that the Proms
audience applaud long and loud to hear it.
