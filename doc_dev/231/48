<LEADPARA>  MICHAEL Morgan makes his debut tonight as the first music director of the
Oakland East Bay Symphony -- an event that caps the remarkable, phoenix-like
comeback of an orchestra in this community.;    The 52-year-old Oakland
Symphony left a big void when it went bankrupt in 1986. Now its 74-member
successor celebrates Morgan's appointment with a concert, at the city's Calvin
Simmons Theater, featuring Beethoven's Violin Concerto (with Ian Swenson as
soloist), Ruszczynski's "Twelve Secrets" and Aaron Copland's "Appalachian
Spring."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The event is also a tacit memorial for Copland, who died last month at 90,
since "Appalachian Spring," one of the early symphonic trailblazers of pure
Americana, has become his best-known instrumental work. The lively, witty,
Brooklyn-born Copland would have loved this rebirth of an orchestra.;    "I
scared the wits out of the people, especially in America (with my
compositions)," Copland told me with a chuckle at the Cabrillo Music Festival
in August 1978, where he was conducting the same Appalachian opus. He said he
was regarded as a wild experimentalist in the 1920s and '30s.;    "To write
something that everybody loved right away seemed too easy," he went on. "One
only knew too well what everybody would applaud for.;    "You write the music
that you have to write.";    Following that dictum, he created "Rodeo," "El
Salon Mexico" (which he also did at Cabrillo), "Quiet City," the stylish
Symphony No. 3 (being performed by the San Francisco Symphony May 2-4) and one
of the most remarkably exuberant clarinet concertos of our century.;    Two
months after Cabrillo, he returned, leading Oakland Ballet performances of his
"Billy the Kid" for his Bay Area swan song.;    He took up conducting late (in
his 60s) and put down composing a mite early (at 73). He stopped when the
juices ran out and offered no apologies, even when reminded that Verdi and
some others were composing in their 80s. "Some lucky devils can do that. . . .
(But anyway) I did it for 50 years.";    There were other surprises about
Copland. He called himself "an ignoramus" in jazz, even though numerous
Copland works are definitely jazzy.;    His favorite composition appeared to
be the forbidding, dissonant, half-hour-long Piano Fantasy. Playing it, he
conceded, was a "monster task.";    Fielding a question he said he'd never
been asked before, he said he had no trunks full of half-done manuscripts or
other musical leftovers.;    "No, and I never burned anything," he said. "I am
a slow worker.";    He clearly loved conducting. "I recommend it," he said
with a grin. "(It's) great fun. You go like this" -- he made a broad sweep of
his arm -- "and you hear beautiful sounds!";    But he admitted he'd be in big
trouble as a symphonic music director. In his gentlemanly way, he knocked
audience conservatism ("a big drag"), the excesses of Bach, Brahms, Beethoven
("really exaggerated") and the music of rival New York composers.;    His only
regret? Never writing a five-act opera for the Met.;    Despite his modesty,
this composer was a colossal force on the American scene. A very private man,
he was one of our most articulate authors and, at heart, a jolly soul who
always had time for one more young composer, one more interview, one more
silly question.;    An object of hero-worship for decades, Copland sheepishly
admitted falling prey to the same ailment himself while in Paris as a student
in his 20s.;    "I said, 'My God, that's (Igor) Stravinsky!' I followed him
for two blocks, like a magnet, until I realized how ridiculous that was.";   
After his student days, Copland went his own way, never to look back.; Oakland
