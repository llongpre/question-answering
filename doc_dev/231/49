   A London dealer on Thursday bought a Ludwig van
Beethoven manuscript of a celebrated chamber work for nearly
$900,000, breaking a record for the composer's music, Sotheby's
auction house said.
   In addition, an anonymous buyer paid $159,800 for an 1811 letter
by the composer to a woman friend, the highest sum ever for a
Beethoven letter.
   Otto Haas, a London dealer, paid $892,000 for the 16-page first
movement of the Sonata for Violoncello and Piano in A Major.
   Beethoven wrote it in brown crayon and black ink in 1807-08,
saying it was composed ``amid tears and sorrow.'' However, scholars
have been unable to determine what he meant by the remark.
   The previous highest auction price for a Beethoven music
manuscript was $168,000 paid in London in May 1988 for his Ninth
Symphony.
   The 1811 letter was written to Bettina Brentano, a poet and
writer. It contained references to two of the greatest German
literary figures, Friedrich von Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe.
   In May 1985, $67,600 was paid in London for a letter by the
composer to Antonie von Brentano, the previous highest price for a
Beethoven letter.
   The manuscript and letter belonged to Dr. Felix Salzer, who
taught music theory at the graduate school of the City University
of New York. He died in 1986 and his collection was sold by his
collaborator and widow, Hedwig.
   The Salzer Collection of music manuscripts and letters fetched a
total of $1.85 million.
   It included Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's manuscript of his
``Rondo'' for piano in F major, which brought $161,700.
   A letter from a disconsolate Franz Schubert to the poet Franz
von Schober fetched a record price for a Schubert letter. It sold
for $121,000.
