As the active concert repertory dwindles almost from day to day for lack of 
nourishing replenishment, the opportunities for performing specialization 
likewise shrinks apace. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Goode, the American-born and trained pianist who played a Beethoven 
recital in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Monday night, may resent this 
categorization, for he does on occasion indeed play music other than Beethoven. 
But when a pianist records all the Beethoven sonatas, as Goode has done, and 
goes about playing recitals devoted to that composer, he must expect to be 
regarded as a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The Beethoven that Goode offered at his recital did not project an air of 
finality. It did not convince for a moment that this was the last word, or that 
nothing is left to be said on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
It was actually rather understated and repressed Beethoven, that had a good 
deal to do with clean, fluent piano playing, but very little to do with a 
tempestuous composer hurling thunderbolts at heaven and earth. 
</P>
<P>
The four sonatas that Goode selected -- Opus 31, No. 1 in G; Opus 81a in 
E-flat; Opus 101 in A, and Opus 111 in C minor -- were set forth as neatly as 
official blueprints. The designs were clear, the notes and interpretive ideas 
indisputably correct, but the music seldom roused to vivid life. It made 
pleasant listening, it seemed to hold the public attention and it stirred up a 
few bravos. But the style was small, an academic shadow hovered over all and 
passion was a sometime thing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, that may be better than tearing it to tatters. You could honestly say 
that this was civilized, mannerly, polite and unpretentious. But eloquent, it 
was not. ALBERT GOLDBERG
