<LEADPARA>  IN A city like San Jose, the orchestra's music director has to be a cultural
superman, operating on many musical and administrative levels and selling the
community on the orchestra, too.;   So says Paul Polivnick, 44, who is the
latest guest conductor/candidate for the San Jose Symphony's music
directorship. He's here to lead this weekend's trio of concerts with music by
a trio of composers: Wagner, Beethoven and Mussorgsky.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     All those extra obligations, he observes, "cut into score-study time, but
that's the way it is.";   Such is the life of the modern-day maestro: part
public-relations person, part arts salesman, part administrator, part
musician.;   The old-time maestros such as George Szell (who led the the
Cleveland Orchestra from 1946 to 1970) were different. They were rarely
involved in luncheon-club talks, hand-shaking, fund-raising -- activities more
commonly associated with college football coaches.;   "Today it wouldn't work
out well if all (a conductor) did was play, pack up the scores and disappear,"
says Polivnick.;   He doesn't conduct like Szell, either.;   "I'm not of the
George Szell school . . . where you make all the decisions before
(rehearsals), achieve them and duplicate them without variation. That's
turning the orchestra into a machine.;   "If I identify with anyone, it's
Leopold Stokowski (leader of the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1912 to 1938). I
identify with the sound of the orchestra and (take on) the mood of the
moment.;   "For me, the orchestra is a very natural thing.";   During our
interview, Polivnick didn't come on like a cultural superman. He was dressed
casually, and his manner was low-key and unassuming.;   He brings an
international background and broad experience to the weekend's concerts. With
his own orchestra -- the Birmingham-based Alabama Symphony, which he has led
for the past seven years -- he has implemented some brilliant ideas. One was
getting the Soviet consul, Alexander Potemkin, to narrate Aaron Copland's
patriotic "A Lincoln Portrait" in a July Fourth concert this year. It was a
wild success.;   Internationally, there is a lot of cultural dialogue going on
between East and West. But Polivnick contends Americans are not participating
as fully as they should. So he has pursued his own kind of glasnost, leading
Czech orchestras both before and after the liberalization of 1989.;   "They're
very poor over there," he says about Czechoslovakia. "But I felt that music
meant much more to them than (to people) in America. They didn't have much
else to cling to.";   Polivnick, who was born in New Jersey and grew up in
Westchester County, outside New York City, began his musical career playing
violin and trumpet in an orchestra at the age of 8. After getting his degree
at the Juilliard School, he went west, became Michael Tilson Thomas' successor
as head of the Debut Orchestra in Los Angeles and enrolled at the University
of Southern California.;   He takes a dim view, however, of learning
conducting at colleges or conservatories.;   "Even in a leading institution,
you get maybe 20 minutes a week before an orchestra. You tell me how you learn
anything in 20 minutes a week!;   "Two pianos? Sure, we did that, but it's
like working at a cardboard computer instead of a real one. How do you learn
to communicate with 100 people and get your ideas across . . . ?";  
Polivnick's San Jose program includes Wagner's early "Rienzi" Overture,
Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 with Santiago Rodriguez as soloist and
Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition.";   The Mussorgsky set of musical
sketches, left by the composer in piano solo form, will not be heard in the
familiar orchestration by Ravel but rather in the more recent one by Vladimir
Ashkenazy, which Polivnick prefers. "It's heavier and more Russian," he says.
Which is just fine with Polivnick, who is of Russian descent himself.;   As a
musician who has conducted in Korea, Austria, Portugal, Britain and Puerto
Rico, he's seen a lot. How do U.S. orchestras stack up?;   "In the best
American orchestras, you may get musicians hanging around five minutes after
rehearsal, polishing up (musical rough spots). Our old orchestras rehearsed
seven or eight times for each concert; now they do it on three or four. . . .
In many cases, you can't get any extra rehearsal time. So in America the
orchestras play concerts to whatever extent it can be ready.";   So far,
Polivnick's reaction to the San Jose Symphony has been positive.;  
"Basically, there's a long-range plan here. An orchestra of the caliber of
Baltimore, Milwaukee or Dallas is being planned, along with a new concert
hall. This is very good. They tend to be very short-sighted elsewhere.";  
What does he dislike? Polivnick echoes the other visiting conductors in
decrying the ultra-reverberant conditions in the rehearsal room of the Center
for the Performing Arts.; San Jose Symphony; Paul Polivnick, guest conductor;
