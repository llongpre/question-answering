Extraordinary polish and burning intensity characterized the playing Thursday 
at the County Museum of Art Bing Theater, where the Pro Arte Quartet delivered 
an unusual program of Beethoven and Bloch. 
</P>
<P>
The evening opened with a rare performance of Beethoven's 1799 Quartet in F, 
which a couple of years later became the Opus 18, No. 1. The composer did make 
some substantive changes, tightening up development sections to create stronger 
harmonic motion, but this early version still has the character and drive of 
the familiar opus. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, it is still great music. Having reached that verdict, however, 
one must give credit to the skillful advocacy of the Wisconsin-based ensemble, 
which infused its performance with boundless vitality, telling drama and 
unusual eloquence. Paying close heed to the score's often-sudden dynamic 
changes, the four delivered a strikingly bold yet never unwieldy reading. 
</P>
<P>
A Middle Period quartet -- Opus 59, No. 3 -- followed, and the Pro Arte took 
its fervent, expressive approach a step further. The players may have traded 
subtlety and delicateness for incandescence and power, but as before, the 
ensemble remained taut, the intonation accurate and the technique clean. 
</P>
<P>
Following intermission, they turned up the heat still further. Joined by 
pianist Howard Karp, violinists Norman Paulu and Jae Kim, violist Richard Blum 
and cellist Parry Karp put extraordinary muscle into the driving ostinatos of 
Ernest Bloch's First Piano Quintet. Alas, that wasn't enough to redeem this 
nearly endless stream of melodically barren, rhythmically repetitious, 
thick-textured muck. Moreover, in their zeal for explosive power, the musicians 
lost some of the control they had earlier exhibited, and both intonation and 
tone quality suffered.

Listening to an automobile horn blare for 30 minutes would have been less 
enjoyable, but only slightly. TERRY McQUILKIN
