   Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe (Arista)
   
   At least when Jon Anderson, Bill Bruford, Rick Wakeman and Steve
Howe were members of Yes, it took comparatively few strokes of the
computer keyboard to dismiss them. Now that they bill themselves as
Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman and Howe it's a bit more time-consuming.
   So let's be brief. Their record is as ponderous as the group's
name, all the worst tendencies of 1970s art rock brought back to
life in digital sound. Wakeman's pompous synthesizer playing and
Anderson's soprano are even more annoying than they were 15 years
ago. Such titles as ``Fist of Fire'' and ``Rock Gives Courage''
tell you not much is happening lyrically, either.
   Even worse, these men choose to noodle and drone for 60 minutes,
making this record a real endurance test.
   Don't encourage them. Just say no.

   Piano Quintet in A, the ``Trout,'' by Franz Schubert; Piano
Quartet in G minor, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart; Artur Schnabel and
the Pro Arte Quartet (EMI).
   
   Artur Schnabel, giant of 20th century pianists and superlative
Beethoven interpreter, is reported to have said: ``I play Beethoven
to make my living; Schubert I play for love.'' His loving treatment
of the ``Trout'' can be heard on this EMI reissue of a 1935
recording, previously released on Arabesque.
   The interpretation may put off some listeners at first, but it
grows on you after a number of hearings. Schnabel's occasional
rhythmic flexing evokes an earlier romantic style, as do the string
players' tendency to slide between notes.
   The sound quality is not the greatest. The remastering from 78s
is uneven, and background noise considerable. But first violinst
Alphonse Ounnou's sweet tone and Schnabel's direct, lucid reading
of the notes shine through.
   The performance is brisk and muscular, but not so much that
Schubert's fleeting changes of color and mood are sacrificed. In
the first movement, phrases seem to build through their own natural
momentum. The cello and viola of the Pro Arte, a Belgian quartet
founded in 1912 and one of the most prominent before World War II,
sing beautifully in the Andante.
   The scherzo is the least successful of the movements, with a not
very appealing percussive, militaristic quality. The tempi in the
fourth movement variations never seem quite right, but that problem
is straightened out in the forceful finale.
   The wonderful Mozart G minor quartet was recorded a year
earlier. Schnabel and the Pro Arte members give a clean, square-cut
rendition. More than in the Schubert, the pianist's singing tone
and uncluttered phrasing come out.

   Piano Concerto in G minor, by Antonin Dvorak; Introduction &amp;
Allegro Appassionato, by Robert Schumann; Andras Schiff and the
Vienna Philharmonic, conducted by Christoph Von Dohnanyi (London).
   
   The G minor piano concerto was written in 1876, midway through
Dvorak's happy career. Behind the Bohemian master were five
symphonies, a good deal of chamber music and his first opera. He
had yet to write his last symphonic masterpieces, including ``From
the New Work,'' the opera ``Rusalka'' and his best concerto, the B
minor for cello. The 35-year-old composer was still 16 years away
from coming to New York as head of the National Conservatory, where
he was affectionately known as Old Borax.
   The G minor is a middling sort of work, a little long in the
first movement, sometimes amorphous and lacking truly memorable
moments. Yet the sunny melodies, Slavonic motifs and beautiful
orchestration are there.
   The orchestra is no mere accompaniment but collaborates with the
soloist in a joint symphonic effort. Dohnanyi and Schiff play it
that way. Pianist and orchestra players beautifully link their
passages, picking up and gently handing back themes. The Vienna
strings show an amazing sweetness in the highest reaches.
   The performance is live and shows few of the drawbacks of that
medium, with the usual advantages of freshness, immediacy and
excitement. Schiff and the orchestra are close to flawless
technically, and the audience is incredibly quiet. No tubercular
ward of coughers here.
   But the piano's recorded sound lacks richness and sounds almost
thin in the upper register.
   In the Schumann, not recorded live, Dohnanyi draws particularly
tasteful and melding phrases from the Vienna. Schiff plays well,
though the inspiration level seems to dip. Maybe that is due to a
comparison with the live Dvorak performance.
