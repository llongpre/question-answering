FOR ONE record company, it seems, discs of piano music must now enter the
catalogue two by two. This year Deutsche Grammophon has released new
recordings by Pollini, Pogorelich, Gavrilov and Ugorski, all of them in
pairs. They offer some fascinating comparisons; the piano sound is
immaculate, and there is a great deal of fearsome technique on display.
Anatol Ugorski is the least known of the quartet: he is Russian by birth,
was trained and later himself taught at the Leningrad Conservatory, and
championed a good deal of contemporary music in the Soviet Union before
emigrating to Germany in 1990. On the evidence of these discs his playing
has the potential for brilliance; in both Beethoven's Diabelli Variations
(435 615-2) and Musorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and Stravinsky's
Petrushka movements (435 616-2) he shows he has some strong musical ideas,
too.
They, though, are the problem. For the way Ugorski fusses with Pictures,
imposing a steady acclerando on the last movement which quite destroys its
monumentality, nudging the Stravinsky pieces until they become rhythmically
unstable, succeeds only in over-interpretation and drawing attention to
itself. His Diabelli is more problematic, less easy to dismiss as wilful or
contrived. It contains some marvellous things, with playing of great
muscularity and tension to set alongside the most poetic effects; somehow,
though, it manages to miss the work's core; the 31st variation, the
rhapsodic Largo, is full of exquisite sounds yet remains earthbound,
detached.
Maurizio Pollini's Chopin and Beethoven may be thoroughly known quantities,
but his recordings of those composers has been by no means consistent. I
would argue that the coupling of the Chopin Scherzi with the Berceuse and
Barcarolle (431 623-2) is by some margin the least successful recording
Pollini has made, harshly driven and garish in its tone, never allowing any
space around the music for fantasy or expressive invention. The Beethoven -
the two sonatas of Op. 27 with the D major Op. 28 (427 770-2) - is more
acceptable, but still severe and short on charm. It is hard to reconcile
these performances with those of the Pollini one admired so enormously a
decade ago, when the detachment was balanced by such refinement of phrase
and colour, and a real sense of musical purpose. Now only the brittle
surface seems to remain.
Andrei Gavrilov at least continues to develop in an interesting and
rewarding fashion. The waywardness and indulgence once so characteristic of
his playing have been brought under control, and discs of Prokofiev Sonatas
(Nos 3, 7 and 8; 435 439-2) and Chopin's Four Ballades and B flat Minor
Sonata (435 622-2) show a disciplined approach. Indeed the Prokofiev is
almost too cool and careful, unfolding all three sonatas without any sense
of hurry and never quite enough nervous energy. But his Chopin is constantly
on the move, urged forward with little surges and emphases. It becomes
wearing in the sonata, which needs a greater feeling of sweep and command,
but is exciting and appropriate in the Ballades, as the tension of each is
consistently sustained.
Ivo Pogorelich offers Haydn on one of his discs and Liszt and Skryabin on
the other. We do not get to hear Pogorelich in London these days; he feels
his art goes unappreciated here. It is useful then to be reminded what a
hugely talented pianist he is, even if that talent is sometimes misapplied.
The Haydn sonatas (Nos 19 and 46; 435 618-2) are not particularly stylish,
or even well shaped, but full of gorgeously coloured effects and sometimes
miraculous articulation. The account of the Liszt sonata (with Skryabin's
Second; 429 391-2) is a tremendous tour de force, terrifying in its dynamic
range and tonal power.
Away from the pianistic mainstream, Viktoria Postnikova's coupling of
Tchaikovsky's The Seasons with his Piano Sonata Op 80 (Erato 2292 45512-2)
fills an interesting niche. The sonata is not the familiar G minor work, but
the early (1865) effort in C sharp minor, given a misleadingly late opus
number when it was revised for posthumous publication by Taneyev. Its
recycled Germanic romanticism needs careful coaxing and a steadying hand in
the wilder rhetorical outbursts; both of those Postnikova generally
supplies. She is convincing, too, in most of the pieces that make up The
Seasons, though the more Schumannesque numbers require the magic of a
Richter to bring them fully to life.
Finally, Peter Hill's pilgrimage through the piano music of Messiaen has
reached the Vingts Regards de l'Enfant-Jesus (Unicorn-Kanchana DKP 9122/23,
two CDs). Hill's series has grown in stature and accomplishment as it has
progressed; now every instalment appears decisively authoritative. There are
many wonderful things in the new set, pieces imbued with a genuine sense of
awe and majesty, others fined down to the most intimate meditations. Such
performances take Messiaen's piano music right out of the category of
special interest and into the centre of the pianistic tradition, revealing a
work that demands alternative interpretations just as surely as the Liszt
sonata or Beethoven's Hammerklavier.
