<LEADPARA>  THE San Jose Symphony's 1991-92 season will feature four more music director

the last of George Cleve's 20 years at the helm.;    On Dec. 7-8, in the week
marking the 200th anniversary of Mozart's death, Cleve will conduct the
Christmas portion of the Handel-Mozart "Messiah" and the Mozart Requiem with
the San Jose State University Chorale at Cupertino's Flint Center.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Reached in Buffalo, N.Y., where this week he is leading the Philharmonic,
Cleve declined to comment on the programs or the season beyond calling the
"Messiah"-Requiem pairing "important.";    Cleve will close out his formal
tenure June 5-7, 1992, in what should be a highly emotional -- and sold-out --
event. He will lead Haydn's "Farewell" Symphony (No. 45), paired with Mahler's
mighty choral-orchestral paean, the "Resurrection" Symphony (No. 2), again
with the chorale participating.;    The 1991-92 season marks the expansion of
the Flint concerts from 10 to 12, allowing listeners there for the first time
to hear all the symphony's programs.;    The four podium candidates will open
the season, enabling the symphony to evaluate all 10 candidates and pick a
music director as early as Thanksgiving.;    The Masterworks series of 12
triple concerts opens Sept. 13 at the San Jose Center for the Performing Arts,
with Michael Palmer, music director of the Wichita, Kan., and New Haven,
Conn., symphonies, conducting the customary three-day set.;    Following him
Sept. 27-29 is Paul Polivnick, who heads orchestras in both Austria and
Alabama.;    Alan Balter, former clarinetist in the San Jose Symphony who is
now music director of the Memphis, Tenn., and Akron, Ohio, symphonies, comes
Oct. 18-20.;    Nov. 15-17 brings the veteran Israeli conductor Gabriel
Chmura, who has been guest of the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Symphony,
the London Symphony and the Orchestre de Paris.;    The season's repertory
emphasis is on 19th-century German composers, with an exhaustive survey of
Brahms. There are no living composers under age 75 represented, with the
cutting edge provided mostly by Roy Harris, Witold Lutoslawski and Joaquin
Rodrigo. Cleve will lead a concerto by Bohuslav Martinu to mark the Czech
composer's centennial.;    The roster of soloists is, as usual, dominated by
repeat artists. They include pianists Rudolf Firkusny, Jean-Philippe Collard,
Alicia de Larrocha, Garrick Ohlsson and Santiago Rodriguez; violinist David
Abel; harpist Susanna Mildonian; guitarist Pepe Romero; and cellist Gustav
Rivinius.;    Season brochures are expected to be out by April. The top ticket
prices at the Center for the Performing Arts have been raised 9 percent over
this season's.;    For information on subscriptions ($46-$316 at the CPA,
$45-$168 at Flint Center), the number is (408) 288-2828.;     The complete
schedule is as follows, with the first two nights of each program at the San
