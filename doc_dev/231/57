<LEADPARA>  EVERYBODY likes George Perle, the gregarious composer from New York, but the
San Francisco Symphony is serving up such a plethora of his music that it may
wear out his welcome.;    The third new piece in two months by the symphony's
composer-in-residence took center stage this week. It was just in time for
another New York City tour. With deplorable cautiousness, the San Franciscans
always pack some new New York music, as if that justified transporting an
orchestra 3,000 miles each way.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The motives for the parochial display are inexplicable, unless Gotham's
critics and audiences are even more close-minded than anyone thought
possible.;    Still, we should be grateful for premieres such as Perle brought
into the world Tuesday night, with great help from music director Herbert
Blomstedt.;    In his 17-minute "Sinfonietta II," Perle is full of wit and
sparkle, as if he were a musical heir of "The Six" (Milhaud, Honegger, et
al.), composers in the French tradition.;    Perle continues the pingpong of
ideas so dominant in his Piano Concerto premiere of last month, but he does it
more deftly here. Short musical "sentences" flow back and forth between the
strings and winds, like a bright dialogue in a hit play.;    Perle is less
dissonant than, say, Bartok. His music is quite palatable to the Davies
Symphony Hall audience. Yet nothing is trite; nothing is a rerun; nothing
panders to popular taste.;    It's incredible that he has retained so fertile
an imagination through such a long career; neither his music nor his
appearance reveals that he is 75 years old.;    Like Alban Berg, on whose work
Perle is the world-renowned expert, Perle built a code into this piece (one
not mentioned in the voluminous program notes for the concert). If he is
three-quarters of a century old, what could be more natural than music in
three-quarter time?;    Two of the three movements are called Scherzo,
traditionally in three-quarter time, though Perle repeatedly breaks up the
triple-meter feeling to the music. He is not tied to formulas.;    For those
seeking a programmatic interpretation of everything in this universe, Perle
obliged by calling the slow movement "Chorales and Diversions." It is built
around a subterranean choral theme played by John Engelkes on a bass trombone
with a bucket-like mute. It struck me as hollow and unholy and very
Dostoevskian but provided an effective contrast to the sprightly outer
movements.;    The composer took bows at the end and, as usual, was warmly
received by both musicians and audience.;    The week's huge drawing card,
however, is cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who performed Hindemith's Cello Concerto (1940).
A symphonic piece from the perspective of a concert-band composer par
excellence, it bursts with some fearsomely aggressive brass and percussion,
and the strings fight an uphill battle all the way. But Hindemith treated the
soloist sympathetically. The concerto is like an entire work built on the
concept of the slow movement of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto.;    Ma used
this expansive music to soothe, to howl, to dazzle, to sing, to plumb. His
cello is marvelously lyrical, and the virtuosity he demonstrated in the
cadenza was second to none.;    Ma's intensity can be colossal, and yet he can
quiet down to the most delicate pianissimo at the end of the slow movement,
when the cello has completely defanged the big orchestra. (Never mind that the
orchestra returns full bore in the finale!);    It was great fun to hear the
piece Tuesday night in a topsy-turvy week shifted about because of touring
schedules. The set concludes tonight.;    The concerts conclude with conductor
Blomstedt leading Beethoven's Symphony No. 4. Eureka, a pre-20th-century
opus.;     San Francisco Symphony; Herbert Blomstedt, conductor; Where: Davies
Symphony Hall, Van Ness Avenue at Grove Street, San Francisco; When: 8:30
tonight; Tickets: $7-$46, (415) 431-5400  </TEXT>
