Some prodigiously talented, aspiring young players got some expert help Friday 
night when members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute performed three 
chamber works at Schoenberg Hall, UCLA. Three mentors supplemented the forces 
-- artistic director and cellist Lynn Harrell, Emerson Quartet violinist Philip 
Setzer and pianist Yefim Bronfman.

As one could have anticipated, the virtuosic collaboration of Harrell and 
Setzer in Ravel's Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920-22) became the centerpiece 
of the concert. Harrell's witty, bubbly style and Setzer's more serious, almost 
brooding approach successfully blended and comprehensively explored each 
carefully written nuance of the score.

A last-minute substitution of the Schubert Trio, Opus 99, for the Beethoven 
Quartet Opus 95, yielded some pleasantly surprising results as well. Violinist 
Helen Nightengale rose to the occasion with a commanding performance filled 
with delicate but controlled lyricism.

The last piece on the program, Beethoven's Quintet for Piano and Winds, Opus 
16, proved more problematic. Despite the spirited, polished accompaniment 
provided by Bronfman, the wind players suffered myriad intonation problems, due 
at times to overblowing, but also to a general lack of energy.GREGG WAGER
