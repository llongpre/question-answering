BEETHOVENHALLE ORCHESTRA: WHAT'S IN A NAME, ANYWAY?; 
</P>
<P>
THE BONN-BASED GROUP WILL PLAY BEETHOVEN, YES, BUT THE NAME HAS MORE TO DO WITH 
ITS HOME VENUE THAN REPERTOIRE.

This is a lesson in humility. When news came that the Orchester der 
Beethovenhalle Bonn was going to play Friday at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in Costa Mesa, some of us got quite excited. 
</P>
<P>
To neophyte ears -- these neophyte ears -- the name suggested a special 
relationship to Beethoven, the heaven-storming master of classical music. 
</P>
<P>
Reality turned out to be a bit drier. 
</P>
<P>
"The Beethoven Halle is the concert hall in Bonn," said music direct or Dennis 
Russell Davies in a recent phone interview from Kalamazoo, Mich., where the 
orchestra is playing on its current 18-city tour. (Other stops include Torrance 
on Saturday and Pasadena on Monday. Friday's concert is sponsored by the Orange 
County Philharmonic Society.) 
</P>
<P>
"This is the orchestra of the city (of Bonn)," Davies said. "The orchestra 
plays in that hall. That's the traditional way in Europe. You've got the 
Concertgebouw Hall in Amsterdam and the Gewandhaus in Leipzig . . . and the 
orchestras that play in those halls take those names." 
</P>
<P>
Oh dear. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the orchestra was formed in 1897 -- long after the master's death in 
1827 -- as the Koblenz Philharmonic. It was adopted by the city of Bonn in 1907 
and since 1963 has carried its present name. 
</P>
<P>
With all due apologies to the good citizens of both cities, it's hard to 
imagine getting very fired up about a group called the Koblenz or the Bonn 
Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Germany has been very good to Davies. He has fashioned an international 
career from positions in Stuttgart and Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Toledo, Ohio, Davies studied at the Juilliard School, where he and 
Luciano Berio founded the Juilliard Ensemble in 1968. His first major post was 
that of music director of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, from 1972-80. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, he became general music director of the Stuttgart State Opera for 
seven years. Since 1988, he has been artistic director and chief conductor of 
the city of Bonn, West Germany. As such, he is responsible for 12 concert 
programs each season and two operatic productions. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has a very large music budget for a symphony orchestra, opera house 
and chamber music," he said. "There are other music activities, but these are 
sponsored by the city. I'm in charge of that music that the city sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
One thing he is not in charge of is fund raising for these activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sort of exempt from fund raising: It's not permitted. In Germany, I'm 
employed by the City Council. My boss is the city manager. There is no private 
funding. . . . If I want to tour, I lobby the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
The close connection to government funding doesn't affect programming 
decisions, however. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no hint of any kind of artistic interference. I never had that 
in the States either," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Davies finds only one crucial difference between his American and European 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I never did find much difference in the audiences, to tell the truth, except 
that American audiences are generally older than the European audiences," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Is that a result of a lack of music education programs in our schools? 
</P>
<P>
"That may have something to do with it," Davies said. "Prices may have 
something to do with it. Peer pressure may have something to do with it. . . . 
Also, those of us making symphonic programs and policy have to think about our 
program content to get a wider mix of audiences in the concerts in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"It starts with the way you package the activity: What happens at the concert? 
What is the content of the music? How is it presented? What does the event look 
like? If you take a particular age group, would you like to be at a concert if 
you were in that group? 
</P>
<P>
"The problem sometimes is that normal subscription series symphony orchestra 
concerts get to be regular and predictable -- from the repertory, to how it's 
laid out, to how the evening runs, the way everybody looks, what they do before 
and afterwards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If you like that regularity, that predictability -- and some people do -- 
that's fine. But if you don't, one solution is to try to structure a series of 
concerts that give people different experiences. In Europe, there has been a 
concerted effort to do something like that over a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Davies has been known to Californians for leading the Cabrillo Music Festival 
in Santa Cruz County since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of four co-founders of the Manhattan-based American Composers 
Orchestra in 1975 and has been the group's principal conductor. He was 
principal conductor and classical music program director of the Saratoga 
Performing Arts Center in Upstate New York (the summer home of the Philadelphia 
Orchestra) from 1985-88. 
</P>
<P>
The East Coast now will see him on an even more regular basis, however. In 
December, he was named music director of the Brooklyn Academy of Music and 
principal conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, starting in 1991. His 
contract lasts until 1994 and stipulates a minimum of six weeks' presence in 
Brooklyn each season. 
</P>
<P>
While known for his promotion of living composers and as a specialist in new 
music -- he premiered Philip Glass's opera "Akhnaten" in Stuttgart in 1984 -- 
the concert in Costa Mesa will include nothing avant-garde. The program 
includes works by Beethoven, Schumann and Prokofiev, linked, if by anything, by 
the fact that they are not those composers' warhorses. 
</P>
<P>
"Beethoven's 'King Stephen' Overture is one of those works that have not been 
played to death," the conductor said. 
</P>
<P>
Prokofiev's Sixth Symphony, also on the program, "is a strong and powerful work 
. . . that is so little known and so little played." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been devoted to this piece for so many years," he added. "Every time I 
play it, it is a premiere. It's a wonderful vehicle for this orchestra. It's 
extremely difficult, it takes a lot of rehearsal time, and it is not 
tremendously accessible on a first hearing. But it's been a success in every 
city I've played it in." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Russell Davies will conduct the Orchester der Beethovenhalle Bonn in 
music by Beethoven, Schumann and Prokofiev at 8 p.m. on Friday at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, in Costa Mesa. The 
concert is sponsored by the Philharmonic Society. Tickets: $12 to $35. 
Information: (714) 646-6277.

ADIEU MUSICALS? Opera Pacific may be abandoning summer musicals for the future, 
general director David DiChiera said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we will do a major musical (in 1991) as we have in the summer 
for the past two years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The whole situation with musicals in Southern California is that there seems 
to be a great number of them already available to the community, between the 
Center and the major national touring companies, both in Orange County and Los 
Angeles. We don't want to glut the market." 
</P>
<P>
As to the three operas that the company will present at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in the 1991 season, the productions that were announced 
Monday were originally created for the Washington (D.C.) Opera and the Ft. 
Worth Opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Madama Butterfly" was designed for Washington Opera; sets were designed by 
Ming Cho Lee in 1977 and costumes by Zack Brown in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Sets by Johniene Papandreas and costumes by Marjorie McCown for Bizet's "Les 
Pecheurs des Perles" were designed for the Ft. Worth Opera in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The sets and costumes for "Un Ballo in Maschera" were designed by Zack Brown in 
1980 for the Washington Opera.
