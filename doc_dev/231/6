<LEADPARA>  THE exuberance of Beethoven's large-scale Piano Concerto No. 5 was the driving
force at the core of the San Jose Symphony concert Friday night, with guest
conductor Paul Polivnick on the podium of the Center for the Performing Arts.;
  The concerts, which also feature the colorful cornucopia of the
Mussorgsky-Ashkenazy "Pictures at an Exhibition," continue tonight and Sunday.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  POLIVNICK SHOWS A FIRM GRIP ON BEETHOVEN, WAGNER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Polivnick showed himself in secure control Friday, with a clear beat and a
thorough immersion in his music. He is technically skilled, evoking high
polish from the string and woodwind sound. He let the brass and drums
overwhelm more than once, however, in the Wagner "Rienzi" Overture opening the
program.;   Imbalances of the overture aside, Polivnick acquitted himself
nicely, catching the pomp of the piece, and leading from memory.;   The
Beethoven Fifth is a work of grandeur too. Polivnick accompanied responsively,
though the first movement was very tentative.;   Pianist Santiago Rodriguez
proved as mercurial in his performance as in his career, which has seen many
ups and downs since he took second in the Cliburn Competition a decade ago.
His impact in this brilliant piece waxed and waned, ranging from the
pedestrian to the sublime. I was impressed by his anti-virtuosic approach,
viewing the opus neither as a showpiece nor as a sonnet, but rather as a
vigorous, closely meshed interaction with the ensemble.;   By the third
movement, Rodriguez, Polivnick and orchestra were as one, propelled in unity
to the final cadences, which brought a warm audience response.;   Polivnick's
program is an unexpected one, showing fewer contrasts -- and therefore less of
his diversity -- than other programs offered by guest conductors in the past
year.;   The novelty on the program was Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an
Exhibition," offered not in the familiar 1922 orchestration by Ravel but in
the much more recent setting by the Russian-born Vladimir Ashkenazy. This
orchestration is being heard in San Jose for the first time.;   The choice of
instrumental solos in the piece is, of course, entirely arbitrary. In the "Old
Castle" section, Ravel's saxophone solo becomes an oboe d'amore in the
Ashkenazy version. And in the "Ox Cart" section, Ashkenazy gives Ravel's high
tuba solo to the entire horn section. The result is "heavier . . . and more
Russian" than Ravel, as Polivnick pointed out this week in an interview.;  
The one clear plus of the new version is the correction of earlier errors in
Mussorgsky's published piano score. The Ashkenazy is neither as brilliant, nor
as idiomatic in its orchestration as the Ravel; I find it a paler, coarser and
at times downright awkward construction.;   Polivnick brought out its big
gestures with a flourish. Numerous stirring solos rained down on the
appreciative audience, including the showiness of James Dooley's trumpet and
the feistiness of Byung-Woo Kim's violin.; San Jose Symphony; Paul Polivnick,
