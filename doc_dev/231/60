In spite of sporadic efforts, San Diego is not known as a mecca for choral 
singing. It remains a far cry from cities such as Minneapolis and Washington, 
where many professional and semi-professional choral groups complement 
adventurous church choir programs. This coming weekend, however, promises to be 
an oasis in the local choral desert. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, the touring University of Chicago motet choir visits Clairemont 
Lutheran Church with a Palestrina "Missa Brevis,' as well as shorter works by 
Debussy, Poulenc and Messiaen. Sunday afternoon, the cathedral choir of St. 
Paul's Episcopal Cathedral, directed by choirmaster Edgar Billups, sings the 
Requiem and "Mass for Men's Voices" by contemporary French composer Maurice 
Durufle. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Master Chorale, the area's oldest and most dependable choral 
organization, takes over the downtown First Presbyterian Church Sunday at 8 
p.m. to sing Mozart's "Coronation Mass" and the Faure Requiem. According to 
Master Chorale director Frank Almond, his group is on a roll after January's 
performances with the San Diego Symphony of Beethoven's Ninth (Choral) Symphony 
under the dean of American choral conductors, Robert Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
"Shaw was pleased with the group and was eager to return," said Almond. Almond 
will reciprocate the compliment and spend some of his upcoming sabbatical at 
Emory University working under Shaw, whom he characterized as "the most vital 
72-year-old musician I've ever encountered." 
</P>
<P>
Almond is preparing his choir for a European tour this July, during which they 
will perform both the Faure and Mozart works, as well as American folk hymns 
from the "Sacred Harp" and "Creation," an early composition by San Diego 
composer David Ward-Steinman. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we will be singing primarily in Catholic churches, they now require all 
the repertory to be sacred," said Almond. Performances in cathedrals in Vienna 
and Salzburg will be highlights of the summer tour. 
</P>

The Master Chorale's programs with the symphony this season have turned out to 
be a box-office blessing for the San Diego Symphony. After a two-year hiatus 
that started with the canceled 1986-87 orchestra season, the two musical 
organizations resumed working relations last December with the cooperation they 
enjoyed during the heyday of former orchestra music director David Atherton. 
The only symphony subscription concerts that have sold out thus far this season 
have been four "Messiah" and Beethoven's Ninth programs, all joint performances 
with the Master Chorale. Although the symphony's 1989-90 season has yet to be 
announced, we can expect more collaboration between these organizations.

WAITING IN THE WINGS. Tenor Elliot Palay is not eager to get a reputation for 
indolence, but he is being paid by Los Angeles Music Center Opera to sit around 
and do nothing. In truth, Palay, a member of the United States International 
University faculty, is covering for tenor Placido Domingo in Verdi's "Otello," 
which opens later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever Domingo is performing "Otello," Palay is required to be within 20 
minutes of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles and New York, that means somewhere inside the building, not 
across the next freeway. Usually, I sit in the audience and let them know where 
I am," explained Palay. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the 40-year-old Heldentenor, his job is not entirely a waiting 
game. During rehearsals last week and this week, while the company awaits 
Domingo's return, Palay has been taking the superstar's place. 
</P>
<P>
Although Palay has not had much of a vocal career in this country, he sings 
extensively in Europe. The summer before last, he sang in the Danish National 
Opera's "Ring" cycle, and this May he will repeat two of his Wagnerian heroes 
in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Palay hit pay dirt several years ago while covering for the tenor lead in 
Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde." The slated tenor took ill at noon, and Palay 
made his debut Tristan four hours later.

RETURN OF THE NATIVE. Pianist Gregory Allen returns to Civic Theatre tonight to 
play a solo recital for the San Diego Community Concert Assn. To be correct, 
Allen, who was born in Cheyenne, Wyo., cannot be claimed as a San Diego native. 
He did grow up here, however, and his influential early piano teacher was San 
Diegan Florence Stephenson. While he went on to win many awards, including the 
grand prize of the 1980 Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition, his 
first competition laurel was a San Diego Musical Merit Foundation scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Allen is on the music faculty of the University of Texas at Austin. Since 1987, 
the centennial year of Rubinstein's birth, Allen has embarked on a project to 
record all the 20th-Century works written for and dedicated to Rubinstein.
