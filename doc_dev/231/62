<LEADPARA>  YOU have to admire the panache of the 300-plus musicians who gave an
AIDS-benefit concert that featured music by living composers, when the usual
Mozart-to-Tchaikovsky chestnuts would likely have attracted a larger crowd.;  
 The volunteer performers from more than 30 leading Bay Area ensembles looked
forlorn in the vast Zellerbach Hall last week; they almost outnumbered the
audience. But they threw themselves into some inspired, even electric
music-making.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Conceived just six weeks ago, the benefit suffered from too little
promotion. It yielded an estimated ticket income in the $5,000 range.;    But
events such as this don't revolve around quarters and dimes. They're about
hope, and commitment, and commemoration and a zest for life. And these motives
evoked high excitement, not just in Beethoven's Ninth, the one chestnut on the
program, but also in three pieces by local composers.;    Alan Cox (born 1953)
used fewer than 20 of the instrumentalists for his new "Illuminations," but
the overall effect was sweeping, riveting. He set the bitter (some call it
decadent) imagery of Symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud to music that nods in the
direction of Alban Berg's "Wozzeck." It is terse, deftly punctuated and
downright cynical, particularly in the ironic march accompanying "Democracy"
-- democracy obviously gone awry.;    "Illuminations" encompasses two other
Rimbaud poems as well: "Bottom" (titled for the Shakespeare character) and
"Youth," sung in French by soprano Pamela Sebastian with such subtlety that it
was nearly inaudible.;    Ever since philanthropist Gordon Getty wrote "Plump
Jack," his quasi-opera on Falstaff, in the 1980s, Getty-bashing has been a
sport among music critics. But I see nothing remotely bashable about his new
choral piece, "Annabel Lee," sung by 65 men. The work combines orchestra and
choir in a skillful setting of Poe's poem on the death of a beloved. Some will
gainsay Getty's tonal, retrospective harmonies, which are just a tone's throw
from the more Eastern moments in Menotti and Britten. But the hand-in-glove
integration of the elements was exquisite. Many of the effects were supremely
sensitive, as when harp and gentle percussion lead into the chorus that voices
those ear-catching intervals known as augmented seconds.;    Andrew Imbrie's
brief "Masquerade" from his atypical Symphony No. 1 (1966) was a playful,
tonal departure from the usual style of Berkeley's own prickly master of
dissonant forms. After both Cox and Getty had taken their bows, Imbrie's
absence from the concert raised eyebrows, but it was easily explained: He is
spending the summer as composer-in-residence at Tanglewood, the Boston
Symphony Orchestra's summer home in Lenox, Mass.;    Conductor Samuel
Cristler, the recently deposed music director of Sinfonia San Francisco,
brought high energy to Beethoven's Ninth ("Choral") Symphony in a generally
strong, dry-eyed reading that needed about one more rehearsal to reach
perfection. The players were exceptional, especially the lower strings and
woodwinds, which featured the San Jose Symphony's Michael Corner as clarinet
principal.;    The scherzo was exquisite. Hector Vasquez's bass solo was a bit
forced, but the choral finale, vibrant with grandeur, swept away any
misgivings.  </TEXT>
