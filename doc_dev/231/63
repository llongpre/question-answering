<LEADPARA>  THE Marin Symphony, making news this week with a long-lost Liszt piece,
doesn't seem all that distant to South Bay devotees of the Carmel Bach
Festival. The festival's musicians are found all though the Marin's roster,
and each of the festival's music directors over the past 50 years has led the
Marin Symphony as well.;    In addition, the festival's ubiquitous piano
soloist, Janina Fialkowska, took center stage with the Marin this week,
offering for the season finale a novel Liszt pairing, full of flash and fury,
signifying -- well, not nearly enough.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Marin gave Liszt's posthumously published Piano Concerto No. 3 in E
Flat Major its West Coast premiere at the Tuesday concert. The concerto was
probably never performed in Liszt's own time; it received its modern premiere
at the Chicago Symphony, with Fialkowska at the keyboard, in May 1990.;   
Credit (or blame) for the discovery goes to University of Chicago graduate
student Jay Rosenblatt, who unearthed the work in 1988 from manuscripts in
Leningrad and Nuremberg. Its orchestration was essentially complete, needing
only some tempo and dynamics indications to ready it for the concert stage.;  
 But, as Tuesday night's performance by the Marin Symphony proved, the
concerto falls far short of the work published during the composer's lifetime.
Liszt (1811-1886) quite obviously recognized the paucity of ideas and the
shallowness of accompaniment. He abandoned the work in 1839, without so much
as a bona-fide coda.;    The piece is awkwardly cobbled together, built around
a lugubrious lament in a minor key and a march in a major one. The 13-minute
opus begins with a timpani tattoo, much like the Beethoven Violin Concerto.
The superficial transitions and the extensive unharmonized unison writing for
orchestral parts bog the work down; it sounds as if it were written by a Liszt
fan rather than Liszt himself.;    The best parts, predictably, are the long
solo piano passages, commenting on the themes and varying them, now in
reverie, now in rapid flow. Here Fialkowska showed her acumen at both
extremes, displaying an unexpected power, a gracious touch and only a few
wrong notes in the galloping octaves.;    She also played Liszt's well-matched
but more effective "Totentanz," a quarter-hour opus built entirely around the
timeless "Dies irae" plainchant from the Latin Mass of the Dead.;    Leading
the orchestra was the fast-rising 38-year-old conductor Gary Sheldon, who came
out of the Ohio and New York areas to win the orchestra's music-director
competition last year.;    Tuesday he led Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 too
deliberately but elicited disciplined play from an orchestra that, though
commendable, has too many soft spots. The intonation was not the best, but the
slow movement glowed, right from Glen Swarts' mysteriously distant horn solo.
It was a cautious Fifth -- but after all that careening about with the Liszt,
caution was clearly the antidote.;    The concert opened with Morton Gould's
"Flourishes and Galop," a four-minute throwaway piece that resembles
comedy-film chase music.;    This season the Marin has appeared in the
handsome but cramped Angelico Hall on the Dominican College campus -- a site
that, even with its stage expanded, could barely accommodate 60 musicians for
this concert.;    Next season the symphony returns home to the restored
2,000-seat Marin Veterans Memorial Auditorium, with Sheldon leading a
Beethoven-Copland-Tchaikovsky program featuring pianist Jon Kimura Parker,
Nov. 17 and 19.  </TEXT>
