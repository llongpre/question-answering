GLENN GOULD, the most controversial and elusive pianist of the century, died
ten years ago this month, just a few weeks past his 50th birthday. He
continues to attract calumny and extravagant praise in equal measure. There
has been a posthumous collection of his writings (The Glenn Gould Reader,
edited by Tim Page) as well as numerous biographies and appreciations, the
most useful of which is Otto Friedrich's Glenn Gould: A Life and Variations.
But the recordings remain the core of Gould's musical legacy, as they were
always at the very centre of his life.
Now CBS has launched its 'Glenn Gould Edition'. Over the next two years the
company will make available remastered versions of everything the pianist
ever recorded - concerts as well as studio sessions. It is an ambitious,
fascinating project, promising many revelations and opportunities to savour
again unforgettable performances.
Gould's career as a concert pianist lasted little more than a decade; he
gave his last public recital in 1964. Thereafter work in the studio took
pride of place, with radio and television documentaries for Canadian
Broadcasting as well as an enormously wide-range of recording projects.
Tales of his eccentricity prospered until the peerless quality of his piano
playing seemed obscured not only by some of his more questionable
interpretations but also by the mythology surrounding them - his solitary
lifestyle, his refusal to shake hands for fear of damaging his fingers, his
extraordinary crouching style at the keyboard, the constant crooning that
accompanied all his performances.
How exceptional much of that playing was, and how penetrating the
intelligence reinforcing it emerges vividly in the first batch of
re-releases. Of course Gould was a wayward and sometimes downright perverse
genius - as unpredictable in his choice of repertory as in his
interpretations. His range was enormous, from the Elizabethan virginalists
right up to contemporary composers. Yet he ignored the 19th-century
romantics almost entirely, omiting Schubert, Schumann, Chopin and Liszt, and
preferring instead to explore the century's byways - hence his versions of
Bizet's Variations, Grieg's Piano Sonata (heavily indebted, ironically, to
Schumann) and Richard Strauss's early Sonata, coupled here with the rarely
heard and distinctly oddball melodrama with piano, Enoch Arden.
Whatever the diversions, the keyboard music of Bach was the lynchpin of his
repertory. The case for playing it on a modern piano was never put more
convincingly than in Gould's performances of the Goldberg Variations, the
English and French Suites and the 48 Preludes and Fugues. The 1955 version
of the Variations is included here, the record with which he first burst
upon an unsuspecting musical world. It remains a vivid document, daring in
its selection of tempi, rhapsodical in its phrasing, crystalline in its
grasp of structure. As always one can argue with some of the details, the
extremes of tempi, the self-conscious phrasing, but never with the
conviction and certainty with which everything is presented.
Listening again to Gould playing Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven his instinctive
contrapuntalism comes ever sharper into focus; he thought of music as
essentially a linear, multi-layered art, and his style of playing, with its
lean, sharp focused tone and prodigious control of articulation and
phrasing, was suited perfectly to delineating such strands. That might
account for his distaste for the high romantics, in which harmonic colour is
so important expressively , as well as for his fondness among 20th-century
composers for Schoenberg and Hindemith.
The recordings of the Second Viennese School will presumably re-emerge
later, but Hindemith is represented already by a collection of the brass
sonatas accompanied by Gould. It is hardly familiar fare, but Gould focuses
immense concentration on to what would otherwise seem routine
accompaniments, just as he almost succeeds in rescuing a pallid collection
of pieces by his Canadian contemporaries by the sheer force of his
personality. The acuity of the musical mind, as in all the performances on
these discs, is never to be doubted.
