Beethoven concerts have by now been given in just about every shape and size 
imaginable. It's therefore easy to take for granted a concert of three 
successive Beethoven opuses -- 60, 61 and 62. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday night, when Masatoshi Mitsumoto conducted the Concordia Orchestra 
at the State Playhouse, Cal State L.A., solid music making prevailed over this 
pat game plan. Concluding a modest two-concert festival dedicated to 
Beethoven's work between the years 1806 and 1808, the evening offered exciting 
and expert presentations of three of Beethoven's more succinct masterpieces.

The Symphony No. 4 challenged the players with virtuosity and lighthearted 
expression. Although the energy level of the winds sagged at a few key moments, 
the powerhouse string section kept the music vital and forward-moving. 
</P>
<P>
The Adagio second movement found some anemic elements coming to the fore, while 
the scherzo took off at a faster clip than usual. Yet Mitsumoto's careful blend 
of confidence and intelligence kept the music crisp and unusually brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's Violin Concerto equally displayed an abundance of polish and 
spirit. Soloist Chikashi Tanaka chose an aggressive approach. Unfortunately, 
the price of his frequent manhandling was several passages in which intonation 
and accuracy suffered rough and slipshod edges. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the program was a powerful, invigorating reading of the "Coriolan" 
Overture. A dedication to the students of Tian An Men Square opened the evening 
with an appropriately placed encomium. GREGG WAGER
