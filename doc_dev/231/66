<LEADPARA>  THE San Jose Symphony's first-ever performance of the epic Symphony No. 9 by
Gustav Mahler -- in effect his "Farewell" symphony -- marks an important
coming-of-age for both the orchestra and its audience.;    The Ninth is a work
that speaks eloquently in these times of stress, anguish, armistice and
commemoration, expressing in a beautiful and spiritual way what our fumbling
words cannot.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The choice of this work a year ago for an entire concert has proved
especially serendipitous in light of current events.;    The orchestra has
never played any of the Mahler symphonies beyond No. 5. But after navigating
the musicians through those pieces, plus the Austrian romantic's "Das Lied von
der Erde," Music Director George Cleve decided the time was ripe for one of
the late, great, demanding works.;    Complex, challenging music;  The Mahler
symphonies weren't intended for our TV age, with its 10-second attention span.
They demand concentration and perseverance. Mahler's current popularity may
even suggest a reaction against the TV age.;    Though written before 1911,
the Mahler works were very rarely played in America before 1950, when
conductors such as Bruno Walter, Leonard Bernstein and Erich Leinsdorf took up
the Mahler banner in concert and on disc.;    Even the San Francisco Symphony
barely wet its feet in Mahler until nearly 1970, when the Viennese conductor
Josef Krips introduced the earlier works more or less chronologically.;    The
late ones are a special challenge. From No. 5 onward, the composer turns more
introspective and somber, dropping vocalists and texts except in No. 8.;   
Manic-depressive extremes plagued Mahler in his later years. He bore the
weight of a morbid world-view, fueled by a fascination with the newfound world
of Viennese psychology. (He even had a long analytical session with Sigmund
Freud.);    Suffering from a heart condition and unable to come to grips with
the prospect of death, Mahler went infinitely beyond fashionable neuroses,
however, playing out his fears, visions and transcendence in grand musical
tapestries of mammoth emotion.;    For a long time, he couldn't bring himself
to write a Ninth -- in part because Beethoven and others died after writing
theirs, in part, perhaps, because no one could duplicate the grand genius of
Beethoven's. After the Eighth, Mahler instead composed "Das Lied von der
Erde," thinking it would break the jinx.;    His next work (provocatively
identified in the "New Grove Dictionary of Music" as being in both D major and
the seemingly incompatible D flat major) was labeled the Ninth. In the words
of author-scholar Jonathan Kramer, it was "a great work . . . a heart-rending
farewell to 19th-century values and to a world of innocence, and
simultaneously a vision of a future too terrible and too wonderful to imagine
in 1910.";    In it, the composer quotes the farewell motive from Beethoven's
"Les Adieux" Piano Sonata. The closing Adagio movement, with one of the most
sublime pianissimo endings anywhere, says it best.;    Along the way, however,
the mood rages and wanes. Critic-composer Alban Berg found in it "the
tenderest passages . . . followed by tremendous climaxes like new eruptions of
a volcano.";    The Ninth was written when the long era of tonal music was
coming to an end. Mahler was aware his late romanticism was giving way to the
atonality of rival Viennese composers Schonberg, Berg and Webern. More than in
his other works, Mahler blurred the structural steel of tonality in the Ninth,
sliding through modulations and chromaticism toward a new world of what
traditionalists would see as chaos and disintegration.;    A giant alone;
Mahler's complex psychological makeup, his gift for orchestration, and his
tremendous talent for constructing grand sonic structures, second only to
Wagner's operas, made him a unique figure whose sonic thumbprint is quite
unlike his colleagues'.;    He was the last supernal symphonist (sorry about
that, Sibelius!). He wrote on a cosmic, transcendental plane.;    He had the
misfortune of being regarded by conservative contemporaries as a wild
aberration, epitomizing the excesses of the 20th century. Yet he was denounced
by the succeeding generation as a romantic holdover.;    For listeners today,
he represents an unshakable bridge between the romantic and atonal worlds, and
his psychology speaks to us across the decades.;    His musical constructions
may be too grand for our small-is-beautiful thinking. But in his brief 51
years, Mahler demonstrated that vast ideas require a vast canvas. And his
music, like Beethoven's, speaks -- across boundaries, across centuries, across
oceans of apprehension -- to the millenniums.;  San Jose Symphony; Mahler's
