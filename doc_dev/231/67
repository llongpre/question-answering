<LEADPARA>  SOPRANO Elizabeth Knighton Printy barely escaped disaster in the scary suicide
scene at the end of a Minnesota Opera production of "Tosca.";   When she
jumped through the window for Tosca's suicide plunge, she missed the bed that
was supposed to catch her, hit her head, and fell off a platform to the floor
22 feet below.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Undaunted, she expects to perform a stint with the San Jose Symphony next
spring.;   "It was a miracle that I didn't kill myself," she said. The fall
resulted in four broken ribs, a concussion, a broken pelvis and a week in the
hospital.;   After that Oct. 24 mishap at St. Paul's Ordway Theater, the
anguished epilogue to her otherwise successful debut as Tosca, she is on
crutches but glad there was "no irreparable damage.";   The determined singer
plans to resume her performance schedule in January, singing the songs of
death in Shostakovich's Symphony No. 14 in New York City.;   Now a resident of
Minneapolis, Knighton Printy lived in the Bay Area from 1976 to '84. She sang
in the Verdi "Requiem" with the San Jose Symphony last spring and will return
for the Mahler Second Symphony, under George Cleve, in June 1992.;  
Appropriately, the Mahler symphony is subtitled "Resurrection.";   In other
news of the orchestra, the lineup of vocalists for the Dec. 7-8
"Messiah"-Mozart Requiem package is superlative: Lorraine Hunt, Wendy
Hillhouse, Robert Tate and William Parker.;   The symphony has also signed
Mexican-born conductor Jorge Perez-Gomez for the May 14 flamenco program at
Flint Center. Guitarist Anita Sheer will give the Bay Area premiere of the
"Suite flamenca" by her teacher, Carlos Montoya. She describes it as a
concerto for guitar and orchestra. Choreographer Patri Nader will prepare the
local performers of Bailes de Espana in four selections featuring composers
Bizet, Albeniz, de Falla and Gimenez.;   UNITED OPERA -- The San Francisco
Opera wants to do something special for the weeklong celebration in June 1995
of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations charter. A new opera, perhaps.
The company's general director, Lotfi Mansouri, explained: "We hope we can
stimulate a new opera from Pacific Rim countries" with a commission.;   NEW
FACES -- The San Francisco Symphony has announced an adventurous appointment:
Precocious British composer George Benjamin, 31, will lead Wet Ink, a
new-music series featuring six U.S. premieres, from Feb. 7 to Feb. 28. The
series will replace the New and Unusual Music series, which was led by
composer-in-residence George Perle, 76.;   The symphony may also be
cultivating a special relationship with frequent guest conductor David Zinman.
After prolonged stints this year and last, Zinman is scheduled to return again
June 18-27 to lead an entire Beethoven festival. The orchestra could name
Zinman principal guest conductor, which would make him a prime candidate to
succeed Herbert Blomstedt, music director since 1985, should Blomstedt decide
to move on. Zinman is music director of the Baltimore Symphony.;   MUSICAL
NOTES -- KUSP-FM radio (88.9) in Santa Cruz got a leg up on the competition by
acquiring the exclusive U.S. premiere broadcast rights for John Adams' new
opera, "The Death of Klinghoffer." A recording of the world premiere in
Brussels last March will be broadcast Sunday at 10 a.m. . . .;   Also at Santa
Cruz, the University of California, Santa Cruz's McHenry Library is holding a
free public reception at 3 p.m. Friday to mark the acquisition of the archives
of local composer-conductor George Barati, 78. At the event, held in the
Special Collections area, the Porter String Quartet will give the world
premiere of Barati's String Quartet No. 3.;   Artistic director and composer
Robert Greenberg of Composers Inc. in San Francisco complied fully with a
request from his publicity-minded board of directors. "They said, 'We need a
South Bay angle,' " Greenberg explains. He wrote a new work for violin and
piano called -- "South Bay Angle.";   James Mobberley, featured at last
month's Composers Inc. concert, explained how he became a composer. Camping
out in Bodega Bay years ago, he found he couldn't sleep. "There were two
foghorns. I noticed that they were blowing a minor ninth (interval) apart, (in
a regular pattern of) 12 beats against 17.;   "I decided then that I had to
become a composer."  </TEXT>
