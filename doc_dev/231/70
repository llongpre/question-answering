<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE SAN Jose Symphony played for its life over the weekend, trying to pump
dollars into its impoverished finances with three "Save Our Symphony" benefit
concerts at Flint Center.;   It's probably unfair to hold such an event to the
same standards as a regular subscription concert, so I shall let pass without
further comment the well-worn program: Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," all four of
'em, played by the orchestra's new concertmaster, Byung-Woo Kim; and
Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, whose uplifting -- a word I use in all sincerity
-- "Ode to Joy" makes it ideal for strapped symphony benefits and public
celebrations at the former Berlin Wall.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Thanks to Alan Alda's 1981 film of the same name, "Four Seasons" has become
by now almost as pop as the Pachelbel Canon. Still, it's a wonderful quartet
of pictorial pieces, full of special effects: birdcalls in Spring, drowsy bees
in Summer, hunting horns in Autumn and a comfortable fireside in Winter.;  
Mechanical Vivaldi;   Kim, 28, is an articulate and agile technician, but he
played these evocative works with all the warmth and charm of a computer. His
machine-like perfection ended at the collar: His expression was so grim that
it was preferable not to watch him. Also, it seemed odd that music director
George Cleve conducted Beethoven's Ninth, a complex 65-minute score, from
memory while Kim read the concerti, staples of any violinist's repertory, from
the music stand.;   Half the orchestra's strings played for the Spring and
Summer concerti; then there was a general game of musical chairs, and the rest
of the strings took over for the Autumn and Winter concerti. (The section
leaders stayed put.) Peter Gelfand, whose cello has impeccable diction, was an
exquisite partner whenever the violin played with continuo (cello and
harpsichord) accompaniment.;   Another game of musical chairs involved the
baritone soloist for Beethoven's Ninth. Opera San Jose bass Ronald Gerard sang
Friday night and then got sick; so Daniel Hoggatt, one of the directors of the
combined three-choir chorus, stepped in on Saturday. ("He had never sung it in
his life," said symphony president Douglas N. McLendon. "All things
considered, I think he did pretty well!") By Sunday, the orchestra had found a
real substitute, Richard Hale, whose pleasant voice was probably a little
lightweight for the invocation.;   The soloists were a real mixed quartet:
After Hale, there was Daniel Harper, the tenor, whose upper voice was simply
not there; mezzo Donna Petersen, a durable Bay Area institution ('nuff said);
and Evelyn de la Rosa, whose thrilling soprano and brilliant eyes outshone
everything else on stage.;   The 227-member chorus comprised the San Jose
State University Chorale (prepared by Charlene Archibeque); Hoggatt's SJSU
Concert Choir; and Schola Cantorum, a community chorus directed by Gregory
Wait. Though a tad short on the details, they sang lustily and with real joy.;
  I sat too close to the orchestra (Row G) to get much more than surface noise
out of the instrumental movements, but even so, the scherzo was exhilarating.
Cleve set a compelling tempo, and the players seized the day. Rob Erlebach was
the hero of the movement, getting nuance (imagine!) from the kettledrums.;  
Familiar pleas;   The whole enterprise, however, left me with a profound sense
of deja vu, for I remember the "Your Symphony Is Dying to Play for You"
campaign of 1986. Haven't we been here before? Are we ever going to be
anywhere else?;   And while one can applaud the many donors and underwriters
who reduced their fees or waived them for the occasion, it seems bitterly
unfair to me that the musicians, who are already underpaid, should donate
their skills to the cause of getting paid at all.  </TEXT>
