   Conductor Michael Tilson Thomas led the New
World Symphony Orchestra, one of America's newest orchestras, in an
enlightening debut at the nation's most venerable concert showcase:
Carnegie Hall.
   This unique ensemble of young professionals was formed only two
years ago, at a time when orchestras everywhere faced money
problems.
   It bills itself as the only full-time, full-size training
orchestra in the country. Its players are recent college graduates,
ranging from ages 21 to 30. The musicians sign on for no more than
three years. The ensemble's alumni already number more than 30.
   In short, the Miami-based New World Symphony Orchestra is an
orchestra in perpetual transition.
   But that didn't mar Thursday night's performance, whose diverse
program ranged from a Beethoven symphony to ``Bamboula Beach _ The
Miami Bamboula'' by Charles Wuorinen.
   Aside from a botched horn entrance here or a flat flute solo
there, the 80 musicians played with great discipline. The biggest
gaffe of the night was minor _ Tilson Thomas' premature entrance
after intermission, before the orchestra tuned up.
   The still youthful Tilson Thomas, who at age 44 is the New
World's artistic director and principal conductor of the London
Symphony Orchestra, held the playing firmly together.
   The concert got off to a jolt with the raucous ``Bamboula
Beach,'' a composition commissioned by the Tilson Thomas for the
ensemble's inaugural performance in February 1988.
   ``The word `bamboula' _ originally a Creole dance _ refers to a
series of otherwise musically unrelated works of mine which all
share a certain lightness of spirit,'' the Pulitzer prize-winning
Wuorinen explained in the program notes.
   It was the first New York performance for the short, energetic
piece, whose dissonance is punctuated by the percussion section. It
even included a solo for the steel drum.
   The composition sometimes sounded like a ride on a subway train,
but it was a fun trip, ending in a smash not a crash.
   Next was Aaron Coplaonstrating tremendous discipline after the
heart-pounding finale of ``Bamboula.''
   The composition's many solos provided a chance to the musicians,
especially the strings and woodwinds, to display their skills. For
the most part, they seized the opportunity.
   Tilson Thomas also chose an unfamiliar version: the complete
symphonic score rather than the often-played suite from the 1944
ballet.
   Some audience members grumbled that they could see why the extra
10 minutes were cut. For others, however, the additional material
took the listener into new recesses of the composition, especially
after the Shaker variations.
   In a bow to traditionalists, the program ended with Beethoven's
``Symphony No. 7 in A Major.''
   The rhythmic, generally whimsical composition provided the
exuberant Tilson Thomas with a podium showpiece. He conducted it
without a score, jabbing his baton toward the players and giving an
occasional leap and foot stomp without distracting the listener.
   After a standing ovation, he returned with members of the
orchestra who did not have parts in the Beethoven for an encore,
Wagner's prelude to Act 3 from ``Lohengrin.''
   ``I wouldn't want to end the night without everyone on stage,''
he told the audience.
