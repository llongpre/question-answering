The London concert scene was neither noticeably richer or poorer this year
than before; which is to say, it has still been pretty rich. Shrunken state
support has not diminished the variety of the 'big five' orchestras'
programmes (I count the BBC Symphony among them, as one must). For every
plain, undisguised money-spinner on this year's menu, you could find two or
three in the South Bank brochures for, say, 1965 or 1970.
Which is only to remark: the notion of a 'money-spinning' concert is
elusive. A quarter-century back, Beethoven's Third, Fifth and Ninth
Symphonies, Tchaikovsky's Fifth and Sixth and two Rakhmaninov piano concerti
were supposed to be surefire draws, almost as safe as the '1812' Overture
with fireworks laid on. None of them now guarantees even a full-ish house,
not without a renowned conductor. The ageing audience for the traditional
middle-brow favourites has become unreliable - or, perhaps, just experienced
enough to turn choosy.
The only sure successes are (a) operas in concert form with famous singers,
(b) some performances of not-too-unfamiliar works - a much broader category
than it used to be - by very big-name conductors, and (c) just once in a
while, some especially ambitious piece (massive, or inordinately long or
fabulously complicated) by a currently trendy composer. Any of those latter
is difficult to plan with confidence.
Yet the average numbers for concert evenings remain healthy enough: down a
bit while the perceived recession continues, but not more so than the paying
audiences for other arts. Despite the fearful internecine competition
between them none of the major London orchestras has collapsed yet, nor
abandoned the capital for hand-to-mouth life in the provinces (though they
complain that every London concert costs them money). These days, opera
commands many more column-inches in the press than non-operatic music; but
audiences for the latter, night by night, are in toto larger by far.
We are admittedly short of great conductors. (So is everybody.) The
departures of Giuseppe Sinopoli from the Philharmonia and Franz Welser-Most
from the London Philharmonic have not incurred widespread grief, though they
both had their moments. The great Klaus Tennstedt, whose LPO concerts these
past years have been regularly announced, sold out and then relegated to a
substitute or cancelled, has finally thrown in the towel. The loss to the
London Symphony of Michael Tilson Thomas - at the gain of Colin Davis - we
can bear without pain; the Tilson Thomas career needed a move to America at
this stage, and will no doubt benefit by it. The Royal Philharmonic
continues to rotate any number of conductors, but can still rise beautifully
to an occasion.
Are so many orchestras a crazy London luxury? Well: not as long as they
survive. For one thing, the notoriously scant rehearsal-time that they often
get might not be improved in the least if they were fewer. Nor could we
expect them, if they took to the Continental and American routine of
repeating every concert several times in a week, to risk as many bold
programmes as they do.
The fashion for mini-'festivals' has somewhat declined. This year the main
ones have been Rostropovich's Schnittke conspectus at the Barbican, the
South Bank's celebration of Luciano Berio, and Tilson Thomas's continuing
Mahler cycle with the LPO; but nothing so unexpected and enlightening as the
Barbican's recent 'Tender is the North' conspectus of Scandinavian music,
let alone the exhaustive South Bank forays into Stravinsky, Webern and
Roberto Gerhard longer ago.
Though that is perhaps no more than happenchance, it may reflect their
promoters' concern that there is no longer a 'special' audience for anything
too special. Nobody can count upon younger ears eagerly zeroing into music
they want to know more about, because they come from too many different
places. There is no regular place appointed to classical music in British
schools now, unlike those of virtually every European country. To be
prompted toward knowing more of it you have to be lucky in your local
education, or divine extra possibilities in pop and rock and popular
minimalism, or be moved by fashionable meditators like Arvo Part and John
Tavener.
It is left to the Wigmore Hall to sustain crusty, dependable old
music-lovers. Chamber music, and piano and song recitals, sound better there
than almost anywhere (except when the artists' ears have been spoiled by
playing too much in grander venues). The Queen Elizabeth Hall, much improved
by narrowing the available space for a more intimate audience, remains
nevertheless too large for immediate communication - though Richard Goode's
inspired, ongoing Beethoven piano-cycle goes a long way toward refuting that
charge. The Wigmore remains the place to hear Dichterliebe, Winterreise or
Die schone Mullerin , the Beethoven quartets or Bartok's or the Schubert
trios; and its best artists are invariably sold out.
We have little room for complaint. Besides the many Wigmore series (which do
need advance booking) and the mini-festivals in the larger halls, there have
been plenty of rewarding one-offs this year - Maxwell Davies's lithe new
Fifth Symphony, and Boulez's knife-edge readings of Stravinsky's Symphony of
Psalms and his own Cummings ist der Dichter at the Proms; Louis Andriessen's
De Materie in the South Bank 'Meltdown' festival (not otherwise
distinguished), and Berio's opera La vera storia and the complete sequence
of his Sequenze; Chailly's Mahler Seventh with the Concertgebouw, and also
some electrifying moments in Tilson Thomas's Mahler series so far.
On the smaller Wigmore scale, I remember with acute pleasure concerts by the
steadily maturing Carmina Quartet, the Ysaye and the sumptuous Vogler. In
Lieder, Nathan Berg's beautiful sound - and intelligence, and flair, and the
even younger Matthias Gorne's precocious art; and at the Barbican, the
unequalled Borodin Quartet in Shostakovich, and peerless young Maxim
Vengerov's virtuoso fiddle. Times may be tougher than anybody likes to
acknowledge, but we are still spoiled for choice.
