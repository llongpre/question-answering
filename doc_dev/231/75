Studying in Paris, Berlioz abandoned medicine for music when he was 19. A
year later he composed a Messe solennelle, a full-dress Mass with orchestra,
which got just two performances. He became dissatisfied with it, and said
that he had burned the score - though he cannibalised some of the music for
use in later pieces. Until last year, that was all anyone knew about it; but
now we know otherwise. In Westminster Cathedral on Tuesday (and on BBC-2),
the Messe was heard again in a revelatory performance.
Last year Frans Moors, a Belgian part-time organist, discovered a full score
 -in Berlioz's own hand - tucked away in a chest, in the organ-gallery of
his Antwerp church: utterly unexpected. It seems that the young composer had
made a present of this manuscript to a fellow music-student, a violinist
from Antwerp. The musical world was alerted at once, and the honour of
performing the Messe anew went to John Eliot Gardiner with his period-band
l'Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique and his Monteverdi Choir, who
brought it to London after touring Bremen, Vienna, Rome and Madrid.
Sometimes 'long-lost' scores do turn up: early Handel and Verdi, for
example, and bits of youthful Wagner, Debussy and Ravel. This Berlioz
rediscovery far outweighed any of those finds, for it is not just a juvenile
fragment, or an uncut version of something we knew only in a truncated form.
On the contrary: it is music strong enough in its own right that we would be
excited by it now even if Berlioz had died without writing another note -
and it is a treasure-trove of musical ideas that he recycled and extended in
the now-familiar works of his maturity.
In our century, the only comparable discovery that comes to mind is fairly
remote: the resuscitation of Beethoven's original Leonore opera (never
actually 'lost') for modern audiences who knew only the Fidelio that it
eventually became. But the raising of Leonore to a higher power was just a
specially rich example of Beethoven's thirst for expressive pithiness and
concision, like the development of the late quartet-music that can be read
in his sketchbooks; the Berlioz case is different.
The young Frenchman had always yearned to create grand, astounding works.
His precocious Messe was planned on a towering scale, astonishingly original
 -and remarkably successful, if uneven. Nothing much like Beethovenian
'symphonic argument' figures in it (nor is there much in later Berlioz);
rather, each of the 14 sections of his Messe would be vitalised by some
terrific, unheard-of musical idea, or several of them. And so they were;
with a little hindsight, it is easy to hear why the first Paris audiences
should have been astounded.
The best ideas would be retrieved in his Benvenuto Cellini opera (passim),
in the Symphonie fantastique (the plaintive strings of the 'Scene aux
champs' come straight from the Gratias here), in the great Te Deum and the
apocalyptic Requiem. Even the huge 'Dies irae' fanfares of the latter
stemmed from the Messe solennelle - without the supernumerary brass, but so
vivid here with the brazen quacks and snarls of Gardiner's 'period'
ophicleide, buccin and serpent as to make an equally hair-raising effect.
Everything in this performance was fresh-eared in the best Berliozian
spirit, superbly prepared, searchingly musical. Perhaps the vague cathedral
acoustic was unfair to the cultivated solo bass Gilles Cachemaille, who
sounded soft-grained in his fiercer declamations; but the high-register
soloists Donna Brown and Jean-Luc Viala made their confident marks, and the
Monteverdi Choir were marvellous in every detail.
Those of us who heard it all on the spot prided ourselves about what mere
BBC-2 couch-potatoes were missing: the bomb-scare in Victoria Street, the
consequent detours, confusions and delays, the drenching rain. On any other
occasion, Gardiner's account of Verdi's four Pezzi Sacri in the first half -
piercing, uncannily well-tuned, and dramatised phrase-by-phrase to a rare
Expressionist standard - would have earned several paragraphs of
awe-stricken praise.
