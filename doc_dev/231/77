<LEADPARA>  WITH a rare incense-like Guatemalan weed in hand, composer Allen Strange is
ready to present the "Hurricane" scenes, which open his new opera "Popul Voh,"
for Opera San Jose's closed-door evaluation Aug. 20.;    The aromatic weed is
one burned at timeless rituals in Central America, suitable for the mood of
this Creation drama drawn from an ancient Quiche-Mayan codex.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The title "Popul Vuh" refers to a sort of New World papyrus long used for
setting down history and myth.;    Composer Strange is fashioning an
all-electronic score with some pre-taped segments; no pit orchestra will be
used or needed. His opera will be four hours long when completed, but
performable in chunks of one, two, three or four hours, at the option of the
opera company. Even if both the funding and the final OSJ approval is
forthcoming, its world premiere will not be before 1993.;    OSJ's growth has
also been tallied for the 1990-91 season, in which it played before 139,065
people in 157 performances: 56 of them community ones, 62 school, and 39
theater. The Montgomery Theater is thus only the tip of the iceberg -- the
nicest thing it's been called all year.;    Elsewhere, a new opera company has
popped up in Walnut Creek's new 800-seat Hofmann Theater. Festival Opera is
opening with Mozart's "The Abduction from the Seraglio" on Aug. 22 with
Gregory Stapp singing bass and Jim Sullivan conducting the orchestra.;   
BEETHOVEN BONANZA -- "It was a steal!" exulted William Meredith when his
Beethoven Center at San Jose State University acquired a Beethoven first
edition for $200.;    The purchase is already providing valuable clues to the
size of orchestras in early performances of Beethoven's symphonies -- much
smaller than modern ensembles playing the same works.;    An auction in San
Francisco last month was a bonanza for Meredith, who also picked up a French
edition of the Beethoven Symphony No. 6 ("Pastoral") for $200. In addition,
the center has just purchased abroad a first edition of the Symphony No. 1,
printed in Vienna in 1801, when Beethoven, 30, was a well-known pianist but a
fairly obscure composer.;    Both editions are rare because they include the
individual orchestral parts and are in good condition despite having been used
and marked. These parts suggest that Beethoven's symphonies used 30 to 40
players -- producing a very different sound from our 20th-century orchestras
typically using 50 to 70 musicians for the same works.;    GLAD CABRILLO
TIDINGS -- The Cabrillo Music Festival in Santa Cruz announced that ticket
sales through the first week are up 24 percent over last year. It's
significant, reversing for the first time an attendance decline extending back
to 1987, when the infamous Cabrillo tent site on the wind-blown Santa Cruz
hill was first conceived.;    Though the festival's home is in the Santa
Cruz-Aptos area, its biggest draws last weekend were at Mission San Juan
Bautista.;    George Cleve's Midsummer Mozart Festival, meanwhile, is feeling
upbeat, though the occupancy at its indoor performance sites has been running
20 percent behind last year. Though the financial crunch forced Cleve to
relinquish his conducting fee, long lines of single-ticket buyers had turned
up by last week. And at the new Flint Center venue, attendance improved from
623 to 746 between the first and second subscription concerts.;    DOLLARS AND
DANCE -- The difficulties in corporate fund-raising have hit Dance Bay Area,
which is eliminating both the San Francisco Dance Festival (originally
scheduled for next month) as well as the whizbang Isadora Duncan Dance Awards
ceremony-performance. The Duncan awards themselves will still be given, but
without the dancers kicking up their heels on stage.  </TEXT>
