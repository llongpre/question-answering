A TRULY festive music festival offers a special, unrepeatable combination of
place and artistic purpose. The 'Saito Kinen Festival Matsumoto' is founded
on one of the world's most remarkable orchestral enterprises, the Saito
Kinen Orchestra of Japan, and located in a provincial city nestling in
beautiful countryside at the foot of the Japanese alps. The orchestra is
remarkable for the quality of its ensemble and character of its players, who
come together only occasionally from around the globe in homage to a
visionary Japanese musician who schooled most of them in western music.
Hideo Saito (1902-74), a cellist and conductor trained in Germany, was
largely responsible for the post-war flourishing of music in Tokyo. In 1948
he founded there the small Music School for Children; 13 years later, after
many struggles, this was expanded into the city's now-celebrated Toho Gakuen
music school. An extraordinarily rich crop of fine musicians has been
germinated by this institution - Ozawa, Japan's international conductor
superstar, was one of the initial intake.
The orchestra gathers its former Toho Gakuen students - at some cost to
themselves - from European or North American symphony orchestras or from the
ranks of internationally established soloists (such as the viola player
Nobuko Imai).
The former pupils first performed together in Tokyo, under Ozawa and the
conductor Kazuyoshi Akiyama (co-director of the orchestra), in their
master's memory in 1984. (Saito Kinen translates as 'memorial to Saito'.)
The success of that memorial concert sowed a seed.
Tours abroad were mooted, and then brought about. London audiences will not
easily forget the three Saito Kinen visits here (Barbican 1987, Proms 1990,
South Bank Japan Festival 1991).
Two years ago Philips started to record the orchestra; and last year the
Saito Kinen Festival was launched with Ozawa as artistic director. According
to report, the entire 1992 ticket allocation was gone within an hour of
first being offered for sale; this year's box office returns told a similar
story.
The 1993 festival programme included chamber music (this year a marvellous
Juilliard Quartet concert of Haydn, Janacek and - with Nobuko Imai - the
Mozart G minor Quintet) and other imaginative programmes (notably a
confrontation of western 19th-century melodrama - poetic recitation with
piano - and Japanese traditions of speech-and-music). But its core,
inevitably, was the three Saito Kinen orchestral concerts and the two
concert-hall staged performances of Honegger's Joan of Arc at the Stake, in
which the orchestra was joined by an international cast. (Last year the
staging had been of Stravinsky's Oedipus rex, with Philip Langridge, Jessye
Norman and Bryn Terfel.)
All three concerts - I attended the latter two - had the Beethoven Seventh
as second half; Schoenberg's Verklarte Nacht in its string-orchestra
arrangement formed the first half of the first and last, the Schubert
Unfinished Symphony that of the middle.
The final-afternoon account of the Schoenberg produced some of the most
astonishingly pure, radiant, fine-grained string-playing I have ever heard.
One expects well-trained Japanese string players to work together precisely
in ensemble; but here the unanimity, controlled intensity and tonal lustre
of the Saito Kinen strings created the illusion that the work was being
returned, in some flawless enlargement, to its original (and preferable)
sextet form.
This was a festival experience to set alongside the most memorable of a
lifetime. Ozawa, whose restless high-octane musical intelligence enables him
to master difficult late-Romantic and 20th-century scores with consummate
skill, has in the past shown himself an unidiomatic conductor of the great
classical symphonies.
At first this seemed still true of his Schubert and Beethoven: the
muscle-power of the strings seemed used only for athletic display, not
invigorating argument. (Philips were recording the performances live, which
may have added to the tension.) But on the final afternoon, with the
recording apparatus now removed, the Beethoven danced and sang with a new
and often exquisitely good-humoured lightness of touch.
The Honegger Joan of Arc, a 1930s 'dramatic oratorio' on a text by Paul
Claudel, was termed a 'vast popular fresco' by its composer. When Ozawa's DG
recording, made with Paris forces, was issued two years ago, I was
particularly troubled by its queasy blending of fulsome mysticism, banal
folksiness and arch infusions of jazz. But this boldly simple staging by the
Paris actor-director Georges Wilson (who also played Brother Dominic, as he
does on the records) made all the elements click into the right dramatic
place.
Marthe Keller, the Swiss actress, was an involving, personable Joan lacking
only a certain French grandeur in her command of rhetoric. The stirring
brilliance and flashing rhythmic articulation of Ozawa and his orchestra
were equalled by a magnificent large combined choir from Tokyo, who in tonal
firmness and eloquence easily surpassed their Radio France opposite numbers
on the DG recording.
To hear Japanese choral singers' impeccable delivery of the French text
provided a noble token of all the passion and commitment that had gone into
the performance - and, indeed, into the Saito Kinen Festival as a whole.
