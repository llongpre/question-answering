<LEADPARA>  IF YOU'RE a Beethoven devotee planning to attend the Sotheby's auction in
London Dec. 6, take along at least $1 million.;   That is expected to be the
selling price for the composer's manuscript of his Piano Sonata in E Minor,
Op. 90. If it sells for $1 million, it will be the highest price ever paid for
a musical manuscript.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The present record is $862,000, paid last year for the first-movement
manuscript of Beethoven's Op. 69 Cello Sonata in A Major. It was bought by the
Beethovenhaus in Bonn, Germany.;   If you're interested in the sonata
manuscript but don't want to pay the million dollars, you might want to know
about San Jose State's Beethoven Center. It has a photocopy of the same
manuscript in its collection.;   AN OVERTURE FOR WILLIAM TELL -- The mammoth
opera "William Tell" will be presented for the first time by the San Francisco
Opera when the company kicks off its "Celebration of Rossini" on May 30.;  
Many had speculated that the festival, marking the bicentennial of Rossini's
birth, might bite the dust because of San Francisco Opera's huge deficits. But
the opera plans to carry it off with four works at the opera house in a season
running through June 28.;   "William Tell" is rarely heard (except for the
famous overture, used as the theme song for TV's "The Lone Ranger") because
high coloratura tenors are difficult to find for the role of Arnold. The San
Francisco Opera has hired Chris Merritt for that part, in a cast that also
features Carol Vaness (Mathilde) and Timothy Noble (William Tell). The opera's
new French-language production will be conducted by Donald Runnicles.;   Other
works in the festival: "The Barber of Seville" with Jeffrey Black and
Frederica von Stade (opening June 2); "The Italian in Algiers," with Marilyn
Horne and Simone Alaimo (June 9); and the U.S. premiere of "Ermione," in a
concert performance with Anna Caterina Antonacci and Kathleen Kuhlmann (June
26).;   In an effort to boost sales, subscription prices for the festival have
been reduced, with prime orchestra seats running $75 or less a performance.;  
Rossini was born on Feb. 29 in 1792. Thus Feb. 29, 1992, will mark only his
50th birthday.;   MORE OPERA NEWS -- This season Opera San Jose has the
highest number of subscribers in its history -- 3,197 to date, bringing in
revenue of $375,708. (Last season there were 3,112 subscribers, with revenue
of $320,200.) "But because of the recession, we're still running $12,000
behind projections," says spokesman Todd L. Perreira. . . .;   Henry
Mollicone's "Hotel Eden," which received its world premiere at Opera San Jose
two years ago, will be produced at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore in
March, 1992. The Santa Clara composer is on a roll: His "Starbird" gets a UCLA
production this weekend, and his "The Face on the Barroom Floor" has received
over 100 performances with a variety of companies, he says.;   CARMEL CHANGES
-- The Carmel Bach Festival, which in August made its first change of music
directors in 36 years, has promoted Nana Faridany from administrator to
executive director.;   The festival's new president is Davis Factor Jr. In
next year's fest German conductor Bruno Weil will succeed Sandor Salgo as
music director. Weil has conducted the Vienna State Opera, and next May leads
the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in England.  </TEXT>
