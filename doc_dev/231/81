<LEADPARA>  HAVING a successful orchestra these days depends on a formula for success, as
the Bay Area Women's Philharmonic (BAWP) proved once again before a sellout
crowd at its season opener Saturday night.;   The all-woman orchestra has
found the right market niche, the right sound and the right conductor -- JoAnn
Falletta, a musician with first-class credentials.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The orchestra will make its East Coast debut Jan. 12 at Washington's
Kennedy Center.;   With the Saturday concert, BAWP embarked on its second
decade with an important move to the Herbst Theatre and an East Coast guest
soloist of star magnitude, pianist Ursula Oppens.;   The program, with new
pieces by three East Coast composers, Augusta Read Thomas, Joan Tower and
Joelle Wallach, drew an audience almost entirely of women, manifesting their
enthusiasm and encouragement for something that's as much a cause celebre as a
musical outlet.;   The night's most exciting music came from the youngest
composer, Thomas, 27. Her "Glass Moon" (1988) is a strongly contoured work
with a strong personality.;   Dense chords and dissonances festoon this
pictorial opus inspired by a "fleeting visual image," as she put it in program
notes. Low brass sounds surge above the ensemble surface again and again, and
thick clusters of notes -- produced partly by subdivided instrumental sections
-- abound. Thomas displays an outstanding gift for orchestration and drama in
this ominous, unsettled 11-minute work.;   Tower's Piano Concerto, subtitled
"Homage to Beethoven," repeatedly and subliminally quotes this composer's
theme in the score, but in style the piece is derivative more of Liszt and
Ravel than Beethoven. The piano part is ebullient and virtuosic in the grand
manner and as idiomatic as only a first-rate pianist-composer could make it.
Ursula Oppens played it with delicious, fiery panache.;   Wallach's "The
Tiger's Tail" had the rare distinction of coming out on a Polish compact disc
even before its world premiere Saturday. I found it a dreary exercise, full of
repetitions, with a main theme too reminiscent of an old blues tune.;   BAWP
still has room to grow. At 60 players, it's unsuited for many of the larger
works in the repertoire. And the inexperience of players in instrumental
groups normally dominated by men -- the trumpet section, for example --
shows.;   Falletta is a consummate technician, yet with little inclination to
touch the heart and soul. And in a night of contemporary composers, you wonder
why Falletta didn't draw on some West Coast creativity as well.  </TEXT>
