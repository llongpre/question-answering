<LEADPARA>  'MOZART &amp; His Time," the biggest celebration ever mounted here of music and
events relating to the famous Austrian composer who died 200 years ago, starts
its two-month run Wednesday.;    Although based in San Francisco, the festival
has important offshoots that reach as far into the South Bay as Cupertino and
Saratoga.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The event represents a unique collaboration among 50 arts organizations,
encompassing music, dance, theater, opera and more.;    The pricey opening
night (May 22), in fact, is an amalgam of the San Francisco Opera and San
Francisco Symphony, beginning with Mozart's "Requiem" ("Mass of the Dead"),
then continuing with arias by leading guest artists of the opera.;    Why all
this hoopla in the bicentennial year of the death of Wolfgang the Great?;   
In recent years, Mozart has surged ahead of even Beethoven in capturing the
public imagination through concert music and film, opera and stage
presentations. One measure of his popularity is a recent Opus record catalog,
where the Mozart listing takes up 29 pages, Bach 26, Beethoven only 20.;   
"Mozart is the universal composer," says Lotfi Mansouri, general manager of
the San Francisco Opera. "And the period he's associated with is a very
fertile period culturally.;    Festivalgoers will need a scorecard to keep
track of events (see complete calendar, Page 4), and we all may wish before
it's over that the performers had large numbers stenciled on their clothing.
Here are some of the highlights in music, university and museum offerings:;   
Opera;  Mansouri's San Francisco Opera has the biggest budgetary commitment to
the festival, with mainstage productions galore.;    The big three are "The
Magic Flute" (June 1-22), "The Marriage of Figaro" (June 2-21) and "Cosi fan
tutte" (June 14-29) at the Opera House -- with big prices to match, running up
to $125.;    They're on a par with the opera's fall-season productions, done
in the original language, with super-titles.;    The picks: The first two
operas. "The Magic Flute" boasts two of America's fastest-rising singers,
Jerry Hadley and Ruth Ann Swenson, as the romantic leads; Gerard Schwarz
conducts.;    In "Figaro," the Met mezzo Frederica von Stade is doing her last
San Francisco Cherubino, the role that rocketed her to fame. Wolfgangs will be
out in profusion, too, and good ones at that: Wolfgang Brendel as the count,
and Wolfgang Rennert conducting.;    The designs for both productions (by
David Hockney and Zack Brown, respectively) are eye-catchers.;    "Cosi" is a
step or two behind in casting but arguably ahead in stage direction, where the
noted Harry Kupfer, formerly of East Berlin, makes his company debut.;    On a
more modest scale are rarities Mozart aficionados will want to catch: "La
finta giardiniera" outdoors (June 30); and a concert version of the early
opera seria "Lucio Silla" (June 28), with Hadley, again, and veteran Julius
Rudel conducting.;    The wacko Pocket Opera is focusing less on Mozart and
more on "&amp; His Time," defined very loosely: Cimarosa's "The Secret Marriage"
(opening May 19), Rossini's "The Barber of Seville" (May 26), Mozart's "Nozze"
(June 16) and an adaptation in English of "The Abduction From the Seraglio"
(June 23). All are in English.;    (South Bay audiences can cheat a bit on
this festival and catch Pocket Opera at Saratoga's Villa Montalvo,
408-741-3428, tickets $18. Both "Barber" and "Figaro" play Montalvo the night
before their North Bay opening.);    The most unusual of the vocal concerts
promises to be the festive music of Hispanic America, 1750-1825, presented by
Juan Pedro Gaffney's Instituto Pro Musica de California. The June 29 concert
with chorus and orchestra will play works of Mozart's contemporaries in Latin
America.;    Sexual segregation? Mozart's time offered that, too -- but it
evens out. On June 1, Elizabeth Appling's San Francisco Girls Chorus pairs
with the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra for Michael Haydn's "St. Aloysius
Mass," plus Mozart, and Venetian music written specifically for girls' voices.
And on June 2, John Fenstermaker's Grace Cathedral Choir of Men and Boys
recreates a concert of Mozart's church music from Salzburg, Austria.;   
Instrumental music;  The hottest ticket here may be a toss-up between two
all-Mozart slates: the Tokyo String Quartet in two venues (June 7, 9, 10), and
the grand finale of George Cleve's Midsummer Mozart Festival, featuring the
last three symphonies (July 31-Aug. 3).;    Your prospects of getting tickets
to the Tokyo Quartet are much helped by a major printing goof: Their name was
omitted in the festival brochure listing for June 7 and 9.;    Conductor Cleve
has clearly given a lot of thought to Mozart's music for his
fest-within-a-fest. In the opening concerts (July 10-13), coming as far south
as Cupertino, he has Mark Brandenburg in the Clarinet Concerto and Ten Dances,
K. 601-603 -- both 200 years old this year -- plus Ivan Moravec in the Piano
Concerto (No. 25) in C Major, K. 503. There's also the "Masonic Funeral
Music," K. 477, to open the celebration on an unorthodox note.;    The
Midsummer Mozart Festival plays in San Francisco, Berkeley and Cupertino July
10-Aug. 3. Tickets run $15-$36. Call (408) 998-2277, (408) 864-8816 or (415)
762-2277.;    Connoisseurs will flock, too, to the Midsummer Mozart program
July 22, featuring the star fortepiano recitalist Melvyn Tan.;    The San
Francisco Symphony is also presenting the Mozart Clarinet Concerto (May
29-31), with the German soloist Sabine Meyer, whom Herbert von Karajan wanted
as a regular in his Berlin Philharmonic over the objections of its dominantly
male rank-and-file. The same slate features the "Requiem," with the excellent
bass Michael Devlin.;    The other series of interest is the Conservatory of
Music's Chamber Music West series of nine concerts, changing almost nightly
(June 3-15). Mozart's last four string quintets are featured, with the D
Major, K. 593, making the trip to Saratoga (June 9). They will be performed by
the Fidelio String Quartet, plus Paul Hersh as the extra violist.;   
Humanities, museums, poetry;  The one you've been waiting for in this series
is the double-barreled film night at the Castro Theatre (June 30) with Ingmar
Bergman's "The Magic Flute" and Milos Forman's "Amadeus.";    From June 7 to 9
the University of California, San Francisco's Laurel Heights Campus will
feature symposia on the health risks of being a superstar and on how to
recognize little Mozarts in our midst.;    Musicologists and cultural
historians pick and poke over "Mozart's Nature, Mozart's World" (June 1) at
the Palace of the Legion of Honor. And the Asian Art Museum brings out Asian
art objects of Mozart's time (May 8-June 30) -- items much coveted in Europe
during that period.  </TEXT>
