Seated at the concertmaster's chair, music director Iona Brown is putting the 
Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra through its paces in Tchaikovsky's "Rococo" 
Variations. Picking up her violin, she joins the strings in a passionate 
pizzicato, before raising her bow to admonish the nearby winds. Later, she 
cradles her instrument while sculpting a gentle phrase with a free hand. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who leads the 40-member ensemble in a series of concerts this week at 
Ambassador Auditorium and Royce Hall, both plays and conducts from the front 
desk, a centuries-old practice she adopted from her mentor, Neville Marriner. 
</P>
<P>
"I could not bear just being a violin soloist," says Brown, who studied with 
Henryk Szeryng. "There are so many of them and they play everything. I feel 
much happier directing myself; it's much easier for me to be in the driver's 
seat." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, as instrumentalists succumb to the lure of the podium, many like 
Brown are opting to combine disciplines in performance and lead from either the 
keyboard or the first chair. 
</P>
<P>
These musicians, from early music proponent Trevor Pinnock to Andre Previn, 
have adopted special techniques to enhance communication with their players. At 
rehearsals, every nuance is carefully orchestrated, with body language assuming 
a crucial role. For some, eye contact with orchestra members is vital; others 
propel rhythmic impulses with their own sense of urgency. With a defiant thrust 
of a chin, a busy pianist can call in the brass; and with a wave of a hand, 
herald the tutti. And in a slow movement, a cantabile can be coaxed with a 
mere, raised eyebrow. 
</P>
<P>
While the romantic literature that commands larger orchestral forces remains 
mostly off limits, repertory of the Baroque era, as well as the concerti of 
Mozart, Haydn and early Beethoven, lends itself well to the practice, according 
to those interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, obstacles remain. Allan Vogel, L.A. Chamber Orchestra principal 
oboist finds his ability to honor Brown's musical intent depends largely on the 
hairdo sported by the string player who sits in his sight line. If violinist 
Lisa Johnson pulls her hair back, Vogel says Brown is easy to follow. Should 
Johnson wear her locks loose, Vogel often must take his cues from the other 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever sees Iona picks up her cues and communicates to the others in the 
section," Vogel explained. "Listen, there are some conductors who are hard to 
follow even if they're standing up there." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Brown is perplexed that some Los Angeles concertgoers find her methods 
distracting. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is definitely the place where people want me to just stand up and 
conduct," says Brown, in a backstage interview following the rehearsal. "I 
don't get this reaction in London or Scandinavia. (Brown also directs the 
Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra). In 
fact, what I do is commonplace in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Brown believes her strength lies in her abilities as an artist, rather than as 
verbal communicator. 
</P>
<P>
"Some critics say I lack spontaneity," Brown says. "I disagree. I communicate 
through the music and demonstrate what I want. Not having a conductor puts more 
responsibility on the players, making them more aware of what is going on 
elsewhere within the orchestra. This can be very freeing." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Leonard, Los Angeles Philharmonic principal cellist, thinks that some 
conductor/soloists are "up there playing on an ego trip." Leonard also finds 
the symphony orchestra too large to be lead by instrumentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it looks great to an audience," Leonard says. "They think it's amazing 
that someone can play and do it all. But it's pretty rare for an 
instrumentalist to really know the score. Besides, there is not the same 
security for musicians that there is when someone is conducting. It's not the 
same as having a (Carlo Maria) Giulini up there. And when you get beyond a 
chamber orchestra, it becomes harder to communicate." 
</P>
<P>
Philippe Entremont, pianist and music director for life of the Vienna Chamber 
Orchestra (who has formerly held conducting posts in Denver and New Orleans), 
cautions would-be conductors that doing double duty in concert "is not a 
hobby." 
</P>
<P>
"So many cellists, violinists and even singers are attracted to the glamour of 
the podium," Entremont said from Paris. "But those who are able to make this 
work have been confirmed conductors; music directors of orchestras. This makes 
all the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Early music proponent Trevor Pinnock, who leads his English Concert from the 
harpsichord "when practical," says his own playing generates a lot of rhythm 
and excitement to the musicians immediately surrounding him, which in turn is 
communicated to the entire group. 
</P>
<P>
"Giving visual signs is not necessarily the best. It's sometimes better if the 
players have to listen than watch," Pinnock says. "For this to work, the 
musicians have got to be comfortable with what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Tchaikovsky Competition winner Vladimir Ashkenazy, who also serves as music 
director of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and principal guest conductor of 
the Cleveland Orchestra, says that assuming a dual role on stage "gives more 
variety" to his concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a well-known pianist," he explains by phone from London, "and doing this 
attracts more people." Ashkenazy says it also allows him to shape pieces in his 
own image. 
</P>
<P>
"Often I have collaborated with conductors and the result is not as good as 
when doing it my way," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Previn stresses that collaborative efforts should feel normal and not take on 
"the attributes of a circus." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always afraid that this will be looked at as a kind of stunt, and it's far 
from that," says Previn, who moves the piano to the midst of the orchestra to 
play/conduct with his back to the audience. "This method is an outgrowth of a 
musical idea. If the orchestra is really listening to the soloist and each 
other it all becomes very natural." 
</P>
<P>
In selecting repertory, pianist/Houston Symphony music director Christoph 
Eschenbach avoids anything beyond early Beethoven. If there are more than 10 
first violinists, he says, it becomes more difficult to maintain contact with 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually do Mozart concerti or early Beethoven or Bach," says Eschenbach. "I 
regard these performances as large-scale chamber works rather than orchestral 
works." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Ashkenazy has been known to conduct all five Beethoven concertos from the 
keyboard. (He says he adapts the orchestral forces to his needs and where 
applicable, concludes the cadenza with one hand, bringing the orchestra in with 
the other). Entremont has ventured the Shostakovich Second; Previn recalls even 
the Ravel G-major and Prokofiev Third having been done this way. 
</P>
<P>
Most violinist/directors are content to double up solely on the concerto 
repertory. Shlomo Mintz says he's courageous enough to essay the Mendelssohn 
Concerto and the Beethoven with his Israel Chamber Orchestra. Yet few will 
dabble with the symphonic output. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Mintz will play along with the "Brandenburg" Concertos, as will Yehudi 
Menuhin. In fact, Menuhin, who often tours with his English Chamber Orchestra, 
says he'll join in "anything Bach." Then of course there's David Zinman, the 
Grammy award-winning Baltimore Symphony conductor who likes to fiddle with 
Strauss waltzes and polkas. (He will present a Viennese evening this summer at 
the Hollywood Bowl). 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to keep his name on the marquee, Stephen Bishop-Kovacevich usually 
appears as piano soloist and conductor on the same bill. He aspires to direct 
the symphonies of Tchaikovsky and Brahms and do opera -- he cites a recent 
performance of Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique" with Simon Rattle's Birmingham 
Symphony -- and expects to perform two Mozart concertos with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic this summer at Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I think playing and conducting is easier," Bishop-Kovacevich said by phone 
from London. "It can be awful though until you get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Brown with her L.A. Chamber Orchestra enthusiastically participates in 
overtures, symphonies, concerti and in accompanying soloists. 
</P>
<P>
Refusing to specialize in any particular period, and embracing the repertory 
from Baroque to the present, Brown constantly seeks new challenges. Due to the 
large orchestral forces involved, she stays away from the symphonies of 
Bruckner and Mahler. And because of the complexities of the score, she eschews 
the likes of Bartok's "Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta." 
</P>
<P>
"I love to have the opportunity with all my groups to do the widest possible 
repertory," Brown says. "When a piece involves 25 players, we work together as 
an enlarged string quartet. When it comes to the last symphonies of Mozart, I 
face the orchestra and do a lot of conducting. 
</P>
<P>
"I try at all times to be discreet. After all, the accent must be on the music 
and not too much on a big personality. If the end result sounds good, does it 
really matter how one achieves it?" 
</P>
