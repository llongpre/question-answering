   A three-page manuscript by Ludwig van Beethoven
containing a large part of the ``Ode to Joy'' from his Ninth
Symphony will be sold to the highest bidder, a researcher at
Sotheby's auction house said Sunday.
   Beethoven's untidy brown ink and pencil writing appears to be a
draft of alterations to the first, second and last movements and
were made after the first performance, said Stephen Roe, the
manuscript expert at Sotheby's.
   ``Nothing was publicly known of its existence until now and it
is an astonishing find,'' Stephen Roe, the manuscript expert at
Sotheby's, said Sunday.
   Roe said the manuscript is privately owned by a collector in
another country. He asked not to be identified.
   ``It's very much a collector's piece as the `Ode to Joy' is the
composer's most famous passage,'' said Roe, who researched the
document at Beethoven's birthplace in Bonn, West Germany, now a
museum.
   ``They didn't know about it there,'' he said.
   Roe said he thought the manuscript would be bought by a
collector at the London auction May 6 and could fetch up to
$180,000.
   Autograph manuscripts relating to Beethoven's symphonies are
very rare. Complete manuscripts of his 1st, 2nd and 3rd symphonies
are lost. His autograph manuscript of the Ninth Symphony, which he
completed in 1824, is in the German State Library in East Berlin.
   The changes were incorporated in the first printing of 1826 by
Schott and Sons, the German music publishers.
   There is another Beethoven brown-ink manuscript in the May 6
sale, a sketch-leaf of his early ideas for the slow movement of the
``Hammerklavier'' piano sonata, the longest he wrote.
   The item is estimated at $36,000 to $55,000, Roe said.
   ``It could be one of those which Beethoven amplified and
extended from one of the notebooks he carried around on his walks
in the countryside around Vienna, jotting down ideas in pencil,''
Roe said.
