ON THE RECORD: CELEBRATING A NON-CELEBRITY QUINTET

The quintets Mozart and Beethoven wrote for piano and winds are frequently 
recorded, inevitably appearing as a coupling. The Quintet in E-flat, K. 452, 
was a favorite of Mozart's among his own works (Beethoven's Opus 16, in the 
same key, is delightful but rather too obviously a knockoff) and it has proven 
attractive as a recording vehicle for celebrity pianists, among them Murray 
Perahia, Radu Lupu, Alfred Brendel, Andre Previn and James Levine. 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, not music frequently encountered in live circumstances since it 
is scored for winds rather than the usual string quartet. 
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned big names notwithstanding, the piece's manifold beauties are 
more consistently exhibited and its problems most successfully solved by a less 
starry pianist, Carol Rosenberger, within the context of stunningly 
accomplished work by present and former members of the Los Angeles Chamber 
Orchestra: oboist Allan Vogel, clarinetist David Shifrin, bassoonist Kenneth 
Munday and hornist Robin Graham (Delos 3024). 
</P>
<P>
Mozart's most problematic writing occurs at the very outset, where the piano's 
bare chords, unsupported by sustained wind phrases, create wide-open spaces 
that cry out for ornamentation but receive it too cautiously or not at all from 
other interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberger, through the simple expedient of arpeggiating those opening chords, 
allows the music to coalesce and take off, and when ornamentation is suggested, 
here and elsewhere in the score, she takes appropriate, tasteful advantage. 
</P>
<P>
But what Rosenberger offers isn't merely convincing from a musicological or 
structural standpoint. Her playing -- in both Mozart and Beethoven -- sparkles 
with wit and intelligence, as does that of her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
While Brahms' Clarinet Quintet is hardly a stranger to our concert halls, one 
would be hard put to recall a live performance (perhaps even one on recordings) 
with the degree of thoughtfulness, warmth and ensemble polish shown in a new 
recorded version by David Shifrin and fellow members of Chamber Music 
Northwest, the annual event that makes Portland a summer paradise for 
aficionados of the intimate muse. 
</P>
<P>
The accompanying work (on Delos 3066) is the less frequently encountered Brahms 
String Quintet in G, Opus 111. It is lamentable, considering the parade of 
string quartets to which we are annually treated in Southern California, that 
not one is ever sufficiently enterprising to add the second viola which would 
allow us to hear the small, choice repertory for string quintet. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the G-major Quartet is given a soaringly dramatic, songful reading 
here by the Chamber Music Northwest strings (all, in fact, New York-based): 
violinists Ani and Ida Kavafian, violists Walter Trampler and Steven Tenenbom, 
and cellist Fred Sherry, who with the exception of Tenenbom are also heard in 
the Clarinet Quintet. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's sole string quintet, in C, Opus 29, is neglected even on 
recordings, perhaps because "early Beethoven" is still regarded with 
insufficient seriousness by Romantically inclined interpreters and critics. Too 
bad, for Opus 29 is a beauty, dramatic and tuneful without the sweat and 
complexity of the late works. 
</P>
<P>
Its compact disc debut (Nimbus 5207) is energetically, if roughly presented by 
Britain's Medici Quartet and violist Simon Rowland Jones, but the coupling was 
ill-chosen: Beethoven's First "Rasumovsky" Quartet as part of the Medici's 
ongoing Beethoven quartet cycle. The competition here is overwhelming and the 
Medicis do not give the impression of being world class. 
</P>
<P>
One of the masterpieces of the tiny repertory of vocal chamber music is Ravel's 
"Chansons madecasses" for voice, flute, cello and piano and a midpriced re- 
release (Elektra/Nonesuch 71355) of the dozen-year-old recording featuring the 
late Jan DeGaetani serves as a fitting memorial to that treasurable artist. 
DeGaetani's coolly precise, soft-grained vocal delivery is strikingly 
contrasted to the exotically sexy lyrics, "collected and translated" by an 
18th-Century literary faker, the Vicomte de Parny, who in fact neither visited 
the land of their supposed origin, Madagascar, nor spoke its language. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the exceptionally attractive Ravel program is devoted to the 
Sonata for Violin and Cello (Isidore Cohen and Timothy Eddy, respectively) and 
a pair of rare two-piano pieces, "Sites auriculaires" and "Frontispice", 
enlisting the services of Gilbert Kalish, Teresa Sterne and the late Paul 
Jacobs.
