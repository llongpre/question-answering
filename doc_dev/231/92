<LEADPARA>  EVERY now and then, usually in connection with an obituary or a birthday
numbered 75 or higher, a pianist is labeled "the last of the Romantics.";  
That description was brought out most recently for the obituaries of Claudio
Arrau, whose pure, precise and sometimes rather mannered style could just as
easily be called neoclassical -- though the high energy and occasional
spontaneity of his playing are a reminder that such tags usually fit too
loosely for total comfort.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Approaching 100;   Chronologically, the most plausible claimant of the
title is Mieczyslaw Horszowski, who was at last report moving serenely toward
his 100th birthday next June, still giving an occasional recital and still
impressing audiences with his imagination and vitality.;   By comparison,
Shura Cherkassky, who passed his 80th birthday last month, is still a baby,
though an extremely talented one. His credentials as a Romantic include a
wayward spirit that makes his performances unpredictable and never dull, a
technique that flinches at no challenge, an adventurous spirit that has never
stopped growing and learning, and a vivid personality that infuses and colors
everything he plays. Unlike many pianists who cultivate or attract the
"Romantic" label, he does not focus exclusively on such composers as Chopin,
Schumann and Liszt, although they are in his repertoire.;   Cherkassky's
stylistic range is enormous, beginning with Bach (such as the great Chaconne
in D Minor as arranged by Busoni) and including among the "B's" Beethoven (Op.
27, No. 1), Brahms (the Paganini Variations), Berg (the Op. 1 Sonata) and
Bernstein ("Touches").;   All these are included in a retrospective boxed set
of eight CDs with 7 1/2 hours of music recorded in the 1980s (Nimbus NI 1793,
eight CDs).;   The pianist's breadth of vision is dazzling, and most, if not
all, of these discs are available separately. Those unwilling to plunge for a
complete set might try the sample in the two "Cherkassky in Concert 1984"
volumes (NI 5020 and 5021), which give an impressive view of the pianist's
strengths.;   As part of a massive posthumous tribute to Arrau, Philips has
issued a six-CD set of his Chopin (432 303-2), including the preludes,
waltzes, ballades, scherzos, nocturnes, impromptus and a few other pieces --
all impressive for technique and imagination, and often provocatively
interpreted.;   A touchstone of Chopin;   I would not turn anyone away from
either of these pianists, but the indispensable Chopin collection has just
been issued by RCA: "Artur Rubinstein: The Chopin Collection" (60822-2-RG, 11
CDs). This is not quite a complete set of Chopin's piano music; it lacks most
of the etudes, some sets of variations, juvenilia, a few waltzes and Sonata
No. 1. But it has all the Chopin most people want to keep within reach. The
performances are authoritative, sensitive, idiomatic -- music-making for the
ages and a touchstone for other Chopin performances.;   Playing that goes as
deep as the music itself can be heard in Arrau's Beethoven set (Philips 432
301-2, 11 CDs), which has the 32 sonatas and three sets of variations (but not
the "Diabelli" ) recorded in the 1960s, when he was at his peak. His Brahms
set (432 302-2, three CDs) dates from a few years later and has vintage
performances of the Sonatas, Op. 3 and 5; the Scherzo, Op. 4; Ballades, Op.
10; and the Handel and Paganini Variations. There is heavy competition in this
repertoire, but both sets are monumental.;   One of the piano giants of the
century, Alfred Cortot, is the subject of a major and highly welcome reissue
on an English label, Biddulph. From his hundreds of records, five CDs' worth
have been selected, featuring his work in the 1920s and '30s, his best years,
in music of Weber and Mendelssohn (LHW 002), Debussy and Ravel (LHW 006) and
Schumann (three volumes, LHW 003-005).;   Young and romantic;   Finally, there
are quite a few pianists whose work lets us hope that the "last of the
Romantics" is still young and active, perhaps not yet born. One is Alfred
Brendel, who can be heard playing variations by Schumann and Beethoven with
spontaneity and imagination (Philips 432 093-2). Another is David Owen-Norris,
who has recorded a mind-boggling piano transcription of Elgar's First Symphony
(AVM AVZ-3024). (box)  </TEXT>
