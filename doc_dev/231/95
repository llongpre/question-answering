ON THE RECORD: WHY SUCH A DEARTH OF DVORAK?

Among the abiding musical mysteries of our time is the lack of appreciation of 
one of the most accessible, likable and consistently inspired of Romantic 
composers: Antonin Dvorak. The biggest-name conductors resolutely refuse to 
explore the prolific Czech's output beyond the barest handful of works. The 
enterprising musicians who do bother are infrequent visitors to our part of the 
world and when they do come, Dvorak isn't part of their baggage. Not even the 
touring Czech chamber groups, hardly strangers to our stages, offer much 
Dvorak, perhaps under the impression that we get as much of it as the folks 
back home do. 
</P>
<P>
Yet audience reaction to the odd gem that does slip through is never less than 
hugely enthusiastic, as it must be for any supreme inventor of melody, master 
orchestrator and the sort of canny showman who virtually builds ovations into 
his scores. It's almost comical then that when JoAnn Falletta programs Dvorak's 
marvelous Sixth Symphony with her Long Beach Symphony it assumes the 
proportions of an act of faith rather than being merely a wise and logical 
move. 
</P>
<P>
It was once the case that popular taste was reflected in what was recorded and, 
later, that recordings made a profound impression on live programming. In the 
case of Dvorak neither seems to be true since recordings of his music are 
numerous beyond what anyone could have imagined a quarter-century ago, when 
only a small minority of listeners was aware of the fact that Dvorak composed 
nine rather than five symphonies and as many string quartets as Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
All this by way of introduction to yet another batch of Dvorak recordings 
offering the listener opportunity to experience melodic revelations and for 
impresarios to bemoan the dearth of such unhackneyed, ear-catchingly glorious 
music on their programs. 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Libor Pesek, who paid a brief (Dvorak-less) visit to the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic last season, is working his way through a cycle of his 
countryman's symphonies for Virgin Classics. 
</P>
<P>
The latest installments are the youthfully overreaching, Wagner-impregnated 
Third Symphony, in E-flat, Opus 10, coupled with the mature and pure-Slavonic 
"Scherzo capriccioso" and "Carnival" Overture (90797), and the Fifth Symphony, 
in F, Opus 76, one of those rowdy, dance-filled Czech marvels over which 
audiences, were they given the opportunity, would go wild with delight. Its 
companion piece is the more subdued but hardly less attractively folksy "Czech" 
Suite, Opus 39 (90769). 
</P>
<P>
Pesek leads with terrific brio as well as a loving ear for instrumental detail. 
His two orchestras, the Czech Philharmonic and Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, 
respond vigorously, with a becoming touch of bucolic roughness in each 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
Mariss Jansons, who has also put in appearances with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic and is shortly to lead the Leningrad Philharmonic here, offers the 
Fifth Symphony as well, with the "Scherzo capriccioso" and the darkly dramatic 
"Othello" Overture, another of the composer's powerful, all-but-ignored late 
works. All are zestfully, idiomatically directed and alertly executed by the 
Oslo Philharmonic (EMI/Angel 499995). 
</P>
<P>
By way of contrast, Andre Previn seems a disinterested outsider looking in on 
the "New World" Symphony and "Carnival" in his latest recording with the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic (Telarc 80238). 
</P>
<P>
While there may not be much to seek out in this hyper-familiar material, it 
remains difficult to recall a conductor who brings less enthusiasm, less 
rhythmic definition to these scores than Previn does. 
</P>
<P>
Telarc's uncharacteristically tubby sonics (the recording was made in Royce 
Hall last April) fail to capture the distinctive sound of the Philharmonic, 
excepting perhaps the dark sheen of its cellos. 
</P>
<P>
The London-based Chilingirian Quartet, recent visitors to the Southland, is -- 
one hopes -- working its way through a Dvorak quartet cycle for the Chandos 
label. Its latest release pairs the lush, endlessly tuneful and harmonically 
imaginative Quartets in E-flat, Opus 51, and in C, Opus 61 (8837) -- music that 
once experienced in such vivacious, polished and idiomatic performances as 
these should remain in the head and heart forever. 
</P>
<P>
A word, too, for the latest reissue of the celebrated interpretation of 
Dvorak's Cello Concerto by Pablo Casals and the Czech Philharmonic under George 
Szell, recorded in Prague in 1937 (EMI/References 63498). The transfers from 78 
r.p.m. project Casals' sumptuous tone and the incisive attack -- notably in 
regard to the solo wind playing -- of Szell's orchestra with a clarity and 
presence barely suggested in prior remasterings. 
</P>
<P>
The 75-minute-long, mid-priced CD further contains Casals' 1945 Elgar Cello 
Concerto and Bruch's "Kol Nidrei," recorded in 1936.
