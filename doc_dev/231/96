MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN, SURVEY PICKS BRAHMS

You are exiled to the proverbial desert island and may take only a few works by 
your favorite composers. Forced to choose, would you pick Brahms? Bach? Mozart? 
</P>
<P>
These three composers -- with Beethoven close behind -- garnered the most top 
picks in an informal survey of musicians conducted by Stephen Shelton of North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"It started out as a parlor game, really," said Shelton, a retired financial 
officer and former bass with the William Hall Chorale. But what began as a lark 
became a three-year project involving the surveying of more than 100 local 
musicians, composers, conductors, vocalists and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"The big surprise is that Tchaikovsky is not first on anyone's list," Shelton 
said. "I asked one person why he didn't name Tchaikovsky at all and he said: 
'He's a lightweight.' But with this person, well, (Alban) Berg was one of his 
favorites and some people would go out of their way to avoid a concert of 
Berg." 
</P>
<P>
For those who want to try this at home, the rules are simple: First pick your 
top 15 or 20 favorite composers -- not those you feel are "important" but those 
whose music most affects you. (A composer may not qualify for the list unless 
several compositions can be named.) 
</P>
<P>
Once the top names are selected, assign a point value to each choice. First 
place is worth 13 points, 12 points are given for second place and so on 
through honorable mentions, worth one point each. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton's results: Out of 104 composers, Bach was chosen most frequently as the 
No. 1 favorite. But when Shelton tabulated the weighted scores, Brahms bumped 
Bach to No. 2, followed by Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, Verdi, Mahler, Debussy, 
Tchaikovsky and Handel. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton admits that the results of the survey are completely subjective -- more 
a musical Rorschach test for individuals than an accurate analysis of the most 
popular composers. 
</P>
<P>
When Pulitzer Prize-winning composer John La Montaine was surveyed, he insisted 
that Bach occupy every one of his Top 10 slots, calling him the "greatest 
adventurer of all composers." 
</P>
<P>
"He wrote in E-sharp minor," La Montaine said. "I mean, who would have thought 
of that?" 
</P>
<P>
But Nick Stremple, music director of Beverly Hills Presbyterian Church, didn't 
list Bach in his Top 10. "I have to be in a very special mood to listen to 
Bach," Stremple said. He ranks Beethoven as the "the most fulfilling composer." 
</P>
<P>
James Low, a Mozart and Bach fan and former regional and district judge for the 
Metropolitan Opera auditions, blames Beethoven for the end of "purity and 
perfection" in classical music, asserting that since his time compositions have 
been increasingly "cluttered up with dead weight." 
</P>
<P>
"Beethoven brought music into the realm of human passion at the expense of the 
high level of spirit where Bach and Mozart dwell," Low said. 
</P>
<P>

Ave. S.E., Mercer Island, Wash. 98040, or call (206) 232-7780.

NOTES: American Ballet Theatre will celebrate its 50th anniversary at the 
Metropolitan Opera Jan. 14, with a gala performance featuring ABT principal 
dancers and guest appearances by stars from the first half century including 
Gelsey Kirkland, Fernando Bujones, Twyla Tharp, Natalia Makarova, Alicia 
Alonso, Agnes de Mille, Eliot Feld and Jerome Robbins. A notable name missing 
from this cast: former artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov, who had widely 
reported clashes with both Kirkland and Bujones. The program, conceived and 
directed by Tony award-winner Michael Smuin, an ABT principal dancer from 
1966-73, will include rare film footage as well as live performances of 
portions of more than 30 ballets from the repertoire. The U.S. tour of the 
Peking Acrobats has been canceled due to "the current political situation" in 
China. The troupe, scheduled to perform at El Camino College on Jan. 31, has 
been replaced by the Soviet Acrobatic Revue. . . . The San Francisco Symphony 
1990 European Festival tour will include concerts in Dresden, Leipzig and East 
Berlin, making the symphony the first U.S. orchestra to schedule performances 
in East Germany since border restrictions were lifted. Music Director Herbert 
Blomstedt, led the Dresden Staatskapelle for 10 years before his appointment to 
the SFS, announced 10 additional concerts including the East German dates. 
Other newly added appearances include concerts in Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, 
Cologne and London. . . .
