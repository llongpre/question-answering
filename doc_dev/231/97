<HEAD>Peter Ustinov Plays Beethoven's Ghost</HEAD>

   Actor Peter Ustinov, whose roles have ranged from
Babar the Elephant to Rome's mad emperor Nero, is now playing
Beethoven's ghost before packed houses in West Berlin.
   The play, ``Beethoven's Tenth,'' was written by Ustinov and has
been performed in the United States and in Britain. However, its
West Berlin debut at the Schiller Theater marks the first time
Ustinov has delivered his lines in German.
   Ustinov, who turned 67 on April 16, admits that speaking German
is his biggest challenge in the performance.
   ``For me, every night at the Schiller is a premiere,'' he said
in a recent interview. ``German is a difficult language. It forces
me to attempt linguistic acrobatics with my mouth that I'm not used
too; I'm constantly in danger of getting stuck.''
   For the interview, Ustinov made his remarks in nearly fluent but
cautiously enunciated German.
   The play opened in West Berlin in January and has been sold out
ever since. More than 40,000 people are expected to see the
production before its scheduled April 30 closing, Gisela Huwe, a
theater spokeswoman, said.
   ```Beethoven's Tenth' is one of the greatest successes in the
40-year history of the Schiller,'' Huwe said of the two-act play
written by Ustinov.
   Much of the play's action concentrates on efforts by a fictional
London music critic named Stephen Winter to imagine how Beethoven's
10th Symphony might have sounded. It also focuses on his often
stormy relations with his son, Pascal, who composes modern
symphonies which Winter has no use for.
   A Viennese au-pair girl named Irmgard, who loves Beethoven and
Pascal, manages to wake the composer from the dead. The composer
rings the doorbell and strides, with long hair flowing, across the
stage.
   With the help of a hearing aid provided by the family doctor,
the old deaf master is able to hear his symphonies for the first
time.
   Ludwig van Beethoven's last completed symphony is his ninth _
The Choral. Music researchers, however, say they have discovered
sketches for an unfinished symphony, possibly a 10th, dated after
completion of his Ninth Symphony and before his death in 1827.
   In Ustinov's play, the audience never learns how the 10th
Symphony really sounded, but the resurrected genius helps bring the
feuding Winter family closer together.
   Critics say Ustinov's often deliberate German delivery adds to
the performance, increasing audience empathy to the character of
Beethoven, who makes a grumpy visit to the 20th century in a
rumpled coat and wig after 160 years in the grave.
   Ustinov said he especially enjoys playing on the West Berlin
stage.
   ``The actor is in direct contact with the audience here,'' he
said. ``The people are very warmhearted.''
   Ustinov is internationally known for his versatility as a stage
and screen actor, and in recent years has become best known for his
portrayal of Agatha Christie's Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot.
   He has written several other plays, a collection of short
stories and a novel.
   In film, he gained prominence for his portrayal of Nero in
Mervyn Le Roy's 1951 Hollywood epic, ``Quo Vadis.'' He is also
known as the voice of Babar the Elephant, a popular children's book
character created by the late French author Jean De Brunhoff.
