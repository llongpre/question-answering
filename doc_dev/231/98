The South Bank's International Chamber Music season, which opened with a
concert by the Endellion String Quartet and guests at the Queen Elizabeth
Hall on Wednesday, has been image-brightened. One knew this from the orange,
blue and pink spotlighting and the dim house-lighting. One knew it, too,
from the players' studiously informal attire. It was made explicit in a
programme-note, and its fatal consequences were sensed when Andrew
Watkinson, the first violinist, stood up before the account of Beethoven's
Op. 127 quartet to tell us what a privilege it was to be able to perform
such great music.
This mawkish spiel had the insidious effect of making us hear the Endellions
being privileged rather than Beethoven's direct utterance. The hall was full
and people surely had not come to have Beethoven sold to them. Not
surprisingly, it was hard to assess the Endellions' interpretation of this
piece. Extremely skilful, certainly, but not very startling or deep. Their
account of Britten's early Three Divertimenti had been far more impressive,
if only because a dazzlingly virtuosic handling of its wonderfully bare and
simple textures is 'all' that this music demands. Interestingly, the
violist, Garfield Jackson, was playing the same instrument used in the
premiere of the work's original version as Alla Quartetto Serioso in 1933.
This we learned from a chatty piece in the programme book, where the players
gave their thoughts on the evening's music to Anthony Burton, and which
confirmed one's impression that the concert and concert-series have been
thoroughly Radio Three-d, which is to say, Classic FM'd. The appearance of
Jean-Yves Thibaudet, pianist for Schubert's Trout Quintet (the double
bassist was Duncan McTier), confirmed one's impression that music-making is
becoming just another kind of fashion statement. His bejewelled suede
slippers and seriously red socks threatened to draw attention entirely away
from what his hands were doing; though his limber and very speedy dexterity
in the gorgeous fourth movement - the famous bird-twittering, fish-leaping
Theme and Variations - was a wholly musical adornment to the work; and the
performance was altogether stylish, energetic and enjoyable.
