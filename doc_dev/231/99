The airborne whooping of horns and trail of trumpets soaring aloft like
rockets set this pair of Promenade concerts off to a flying start. There was
little substance to Herbert Willi's Concerto for Orchestra, but it served
the double purpose of providing a token sample of new music and showing off
what a great orchestra can do.
Not that showing off is really part of the Clevelanders' nature. In the
parade of American orchestras at the Proms, which has been one of the
consistent pleasures of recent years, the Cleveland is unquestionably one of
the leaders - not glossy like Chicago or Philadelphia, but a workmanlike
orchestra, ready to take on the toughest musical material. Even in Ravel's
La Valse, the supremely well-played encore to Saturday's concert, there was
far more than just surface glitter.
All this is part of the Cleveland tradition. Long years with George Szell,
the orchestra's music director from 1946 to 1970, trained the players
rigorously in the demands of the classical repertoire and the present holder
of the post, Christoph von Dohnanyi, is able to draw on that deeply
ingrained sense of style.
Dohnanyi himself is in any case a conductor who knows his chosen music
inside out. There were two German symphonies on the Saturday programme,
Schumann's Fourth and Beethoven's Fifth, and he has mastered the workings of
the nuts and bolts that drive along the symphonic engines of each. In both
symphonies the exposition of the argument was remarkable. Every element
could be clearly heard and its import weighed, even if the Beethoven was in
the last degree too businesslike to become exciting.
The clarity was phenomenal again in Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique (the
wind could always be heard even when they were playing in unison with the
strings). But Dohnanyi needs to let himself go more. This is a symphony
which is about stretching the imagination and assailing the ear with strange
and wild sounds. The wailing clarinet and House-of-Dracula tolling bells in
the Witches' Sabbath had the right idea, but in the rest the disciplinarian
in Dohnanyi kept too sober a grip on the music.
There were two solo vocal contributions. On Saturday Jose van Dam was the
baritone soloist in Mahler's Ruckert Lieder, ideally placed in a diaphanous
orchestral cloak by Dohnanyi and bringing an effortless gravity of
expression to the five songs.
The treat of the two concerts, however, came the night before when Anja
Silja joined the orchestra for a razor-sharp performance of Kurt Weill's
Seven Deadly Sins. Supported by a fine male quartet, she declaimed Brecht's
moral tale of a journey through the evils of capitalism with immense
authority and dramatic soprano strength. Unlike some interpreters of this
piece, she and Dohnanyi never sought to cheapen the music. And that, indeed,
could be the watchword of everything that we heard in these two evenings.
