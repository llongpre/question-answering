<HEAD>Tufts University Abolishes Speech-Limiting Policy</HEAD>

   Free speech, including the right to wear
offensive T-shirts, has returned to the campus of Tufts University
after President Jean Mayer decided a ban on verbal attacks wouldn't
wash in court.
   ``I have decided we are better off erring in the tradition of
free speech,'' Tufts President Jean Mayer said Thursday in an
interview. ``We decided we would decide each case on its merits.''
   Student body president Billy Jacobson, 20, of Roslyn, N.Y., said
he was sorry to see the abolition of a policy supported by most of
the 7,000 students at the private school about six miles north of
Boston.
   ``It was well-intended,'' Jacobson said. ``The university has a
responsibility to protect students. It can't insulate students, but
this is their home and students shouldn't have to worry about going
into their dorms and their dining halls and seeing something
offensive to them.''
   The policy published in the student handbook barred verbal
attacks, whether spoken or written, against an individual's race,
ethnic group, religion or sexual orientation.
   The policy was prompted by an outcry last spring when an
enterprising student marketed a T-shirt stating 15 reasons ``Why
Beer is Better than Women at Tufts.'' All 15 reasons disparaged
women, and one printable reason was ``Hangovers go away.''
   The T-shirt dealer was placed on probation and ordered to do 50
hours of community service. But Mayer suspended that sentence when
lawyers advised him it was unconstitutional.
   The Student Life Committee, a panel comprising faculty and
students, stepped into the breach and imposed the free speech
restriction last June.
   When it made its way into this year's student handbook and
protests were raised, Mayer decided the policy had to go. He
announced it to students Wednesday through the campus media.
   Mayer said he abolished the restrictive policy in part because
legal opinions vary widely on the matter.
   Some experts say the First Amendment only means to bar the
government from restricting speech and doesn't apply to private
universities, Mayer said. Others say it outlaws muzzling anyone who
says or writes anything short of inciting a riot.
   Additionally, a court ruling found a similar policy at the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor was unconstitutional and vague,
Mayer said.
   Bruce Reitman, Tufts associate dean of students, said the issue
of resurgent bigotry on campuses around the country comes up
whenever administrators gather. But he couldn't offer a theory why.
   ``Campuses are more reactionary than they were in the '60s.
There's a new right wing,'' Reitman said. ``We have had our share
of it, similar to other campuses around the country. There's more
tension about these issues than there used to be.''
