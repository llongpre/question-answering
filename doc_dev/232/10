<HEAD>Students From Tufts, Moscow State To Discuss Arms Race</HEAD>

   About 350 students from Tufts University
will discuss the Cold War and nuclear arms race in a classroom
session with undergraduate counterparts in the Soviet Union via
television, the school said.
   The March 5 teleconference is the first of three scheduled
sessions between students from Tufts and Moscow State University in
a jointly run course on the superpowers' arms buildup.
   Tufts professor Martin J. Sherwin, course instructor and
director of Tufts' Nuclear Age History and Humanities Center, said
the project coincides with the rise of glasnost, Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of openness.
   ``Given the new climate in the Soviet Union, this appears to be
the right step at the right time,'' he said.
   An American panel of historians and foreign policy experts is
scheduled to discuss the arms race with a panel of Soviet
counterparts.
   ``These programs will be lively discussions,'' Sherwin said.
``Panelists will be directed to engage in a dialogue rather than to
present set pieces.''
   Students will have an opportunity to question both countries'
panelists, he added.
   The first session will focus on the history of the nuclear age,
including the consequences of the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki in World War II, the first United Nations' arms control
debates and the origins of the Cold War, Sherwin said.
   The 1962 Cuban missile crisis and current nuclear policy issues
_ including the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative program, the
Geneva arms talks and the December signing of an intermediate range
missile reduction treaty _ will be discussed at April 9 and April
30 sessions.
