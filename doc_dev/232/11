   Students at Tufts University can wear T-shirts with
raunchy messages in dorm rooms and on campus lawns, but not in
classrooms under a new policy that officials said Thursday tries to
balance free speech with decorum.
   ``We feel it's our obligation to say that there are no
constituencies that are fair game,'' said Dean of Students Bobbie
Knable.
   The T-shirt zones were created after a male student marketed 200
T-shirts that gave 15 reasons ``Why Beer is Better than Women at
Tufts,'' all disparaging to women. One of the more printable lines
was ``Hangovers go away.''
   ``There were complaints about it,'' Knable said. The T-shirt
dealer was placed on probation and sentenced to 50 hours of
community service, which was later revoked. Officials of the private
liberal arts school then decided to draft a policy curtailing the
bodily display of hostile or derogatory slogans.
   The new rules, which take effect this fall, could involve some
fast changing. For instance, a student might wear a risque T-shirt
in his own room, then cover up the offending portion on his walk
through the dormitory common area before reaching the campus lawn, a
free area.
   But Knable says the circuitous policy stems from efforts to
comply with free speech rights.
   Students in classrooms or dormitory common areas can't escape
looking at the offending message, so the T-shirts are banned, she
said. But dormitory rooms are private and general campus grounds
can't be controlled.
   ``We didn't expect that we could protect our students from all of
the manifestations of bigotry or prejudice,'' Knable said.
   The writing of the policy stirred lively debate on campus. The
final decision on what constitutes a derogatory slogan will be made
on a case-by-case basis, she said.
   ``We really tried to narrow the definition (of offensive) to
derogatory and demeaning,'' Knable said. ``There are a lot of ideas
that people will encounter on campuses in a diverse community that
will be offensive to them and we are not trying to protect people
from ideas,'' she said.
   Knable said the policy is intended to be more of a deterrent than
a disciplinary tool. If complaints are lodged with the dean of
students, the matter will be taken to a panel of faculty and
students. Possible penalties might be probation or community service.
   Knable said officials at Tufts, known for its foreign policy
department, don't expect to have to enforce their penalty frequently
this fall.
   ``It's not as if we are a campus in which we expect the most
virulent kind of things will happen and happen frequently, it's just
that we are still a part of the world,'' she said.
