   Most people know that protein is essential, but there are many
misconceptions about how much the body needs and what are the best
sources.
   Take this true-or-false quiz to see if you know the facts.
   1. Most Americans eat more than enough protein.
   2. Proteins that come from animals contain all the essential
amino acids the body needs.
   3. As adults age, they require less protein.
   4. High-protein diets are not recommended for the obese.
   5. Red meats are better protein sources than poultry or fish.
   6. Athletes need significantly more protein than non-athletes.

   ANSWERS
   1. (True) Most Americans consume double their requirement for
protein. For example, the RDA for a 130-pound woman is easily met
by eating three ounces of lean meat, one slice of bread, one-half
cup of cottage cheese, and 1 cup of milk.
   2. (True) Animal proteins are considered ``complete,'' meaning
that they contain the needed amounts of the nine essential amino
acids your body must get from food. Vegetables are not complete
sources of protein; they lack essential amino acids or do not
contain them in sufficient quantities to meet your body's needs.
Only by combining complementary vegetables on the same day (e.g.,
rice and beans) can you receive a complete protein source.
   3. (False) Current thinking is that the RDA for protein remains
the same on a weight basis throughout adulthood. Some investigators
think that because of changes in the body's efficiency in using
protein, the elderly might require more. However, since calorie
needs decrease as we age, it is wise for the elderly to select
low-fat sources of protein.
   4. (False) High-protein, low-carbohydrate, very low-calorie
diets can be effective for weight loss in obese people (those who
are approximately 25 percent or more above their normal weight
range). After an initial water loss, significant amounts of fat are
also lost. However, these diets can be hazardous and are
recommended only for heart disease or adult-onset diabetes. And
they should always be undertaken with medical supervision.
   5. (False) Red meats tend to be higher in fat, so the percentage
of protein on an ounce-for-ounce basis is lower than in fish or
poultry.
   6. (False) Although an athlete may need slightly more protein
during the initial stages of training or competition, that need is
not very great. Since most Americans already consume more than
enough protein, chances are the increased need has already been met
by a normal diet.
