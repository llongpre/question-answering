   A solar-powered commuter car Sunday won
a 234-mile race against other sun-fueled vehicles and a free ride
to an international competition in Switzerland, organizers said.
   The Solectria Lightspeed produced by Solectria Corp. of
Arlington took first place in the commuter category with a time of
8.2 hours, crossing the finish line behind the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in this Boston suburb.
   Fifteen solar-powered cars began the second annual race in
Fairlee, Vt., on Wednesday. The commuter category consisted of
useable two- and four-seaters, said race co-director Nancy Hazard.
   ``What we are really trying to promote is the development and
use of commuter cars,'' Hazard said.
   The Solectria Lightspeed, driver Anita Rajan, and its crew will
be flown to the Tour de Sol in June by Lufthansa German Airlines,
said Rosemarie Van Camp, a Tufts official.
   Solectria Corp. also finished second in the commuter category
with its Selectria Sunrise, at 8.23 hours.
   In the racing category, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's MIT Solectria 5 finished first at 6.2 hours.
   The Dartmouth Sunvox II came in second for solar racers at 7.9
hours.
   The University of California at Irvine's Solaris was the only
entry in the cross-continental category. The car completed the race.
   The race was sponsored by the Northeast Solar Energy Association
and private corporations, Hazard said.
