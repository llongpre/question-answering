   Sugar has little to offer in the way of nutrient value. For its
calories (16 per teaspoon), sugar provides no vitamins or minerals
that are essential to good health.
   But is sugar one of the culprits in disease? Does eating too
much sugar lead to obesity? What is the role of sugar in the onset
of diabetes?
   Take this quiz to see how your answers match up with those given
by experts. Answer true or false.
   1. People who eat a lot of sugar tend to be heavier than others.
   2. Excess sugar consumption can lead to diabetes.
   3. Sugar plays a role in the development of tooth cavities.
   4. Research has begun to implicate sugar as a risk factor for
certain cancers, particularly cancer of the colon.
   5. Reactive hypoglycemia, a condition characterized by a sharp
drop in blood sugar after meals, affects a larger percentage of the
population than was once believed.
   6. Sugar interferes with the availability of certain vitamins
and minerals to the body.

   ANSWERS
   1. False. Overweight people actually eat less sugar than thin
people, according to epidemiological studies. Moreover, the amount
of sugar someone eats is not necessarily a determinant of whether
he will gain weight. Obesity results from a variety of factors,
including life-style, genetics, and overall eating and activity
patterns.
   2. False. Sugar in itself does not contribute to the development
of diabetes. However, it does aggravate the condition once it
exists. People who have diabetes have trouble keeping down their
blood-sugar levels, so eating products that contain a lot of sugar
makes the problem harder to control.
   3. True. It is not possible to say exactly how great sugar's
role is in the development of cavities. The form in which it is
consumed makes a difference. Sugar in sticky substances is more
problematic than sugar in fruit or fruit juices. Other factors,
such as the hardness of the tooth's surface, are also involved. But
the amount of sugar Americans eat contributes to dental cavities.
That's because the bacteria that cause toothe decay feed on sugar.
Sugar also increases the chance that periodontal (gum) disease will
occur. The more sugar a person eats, the more likely it is that his
gums will recede, causing his teeth to loosen.
   4. False. No scientifically based data support the notion that
high levels of sugar consumption increase an individual's risk of
developing any type of cancer.
   5. False. Although many people believe they have reactive
hypoglycemia, relatively few individuals suffer from this condition.
   6. False. Scientists have discovered no convincing evidence that
people who eat large amounts of sugar have trouble metabolizing any
nutrients.
   Note: Taken as a whole, these answers indicate that sugar
appears to cause no direct problems besides playing a role in the
developmnet of tooth decay. But that doesn't mean that a healthy
diet is consistent with the consumption of a lot of sugar-filled
snacks and beverages. Since sugar contributes no nutrients to the
diet, its consumption should be limited to make room for foods with
vitamins, minerals and other essential nutrients.
