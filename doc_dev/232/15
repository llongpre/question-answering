   Integrated Genetics Inc. said it signed a research agreement with Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine for developing genetically altered animals that produce human drugs in their milk. 

   Under the three-year agreement, the biotechnology concern will fund the development of a herd of livestock at Tufts that can produce commercial quantities of human drugs in their milk, Integrated Genetics said. 
The amount of the funding wasn't disclosed. 

   In 1987, researchers with the National Institutes of Health and Integrated Genetics reported they had developed genetically altered mice that secrete the drug tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, in their milk. 
The technique involves transferring genes from one species into another. 

   Since then, Integrated Genetics and other concerns have investigated the feasibility of producing TPA and other drugs in larger animals such as sheep and cows.
