<LEADPARA>  Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist David Baltimore, who is also president
of New York's Rockefeller University, asked Wednesday that an influential
scientific paper bearing his name be retracted because of evidence that it
contained fraudulent data.;    Baltimore's action came just hours after
several major news organizations received leaked copies of a draft report of
an official government investigation into the paper, which was published in
the scientific journal Cell in 1986 and which purported to make a critical
contribution to understanding the immune system.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The report, prepared by the Office of Scientific Integrity of the National
Institutes of Health, detailed numerous instances in which one of Baltimore's
co-authors, Tufts University researcher Thereza Imanishi-Kari, allegedly
falsified and manufactured data.;    Although the report does not implicate
Baltimore in any scientific fraud, it criticizes him for defending the paper's
scientific honesty despite evidence that parts of it were fraudulent.;    "It
is difficult to comprehend his maintaining this stance as the evidence mounted
that serious problems existed with the . . . data in the Cell paper," the
report said.;    Baltimore's request to withdraw the Cell paper, a dramatic
reversal of his stance, is the latest development in a 5-year-old controversy
that so far has prompted two university reviews, numerous congressional
hearings, three lengthy National Institutes of Health investigations and a
national debate about how science should be policed.;    "The draft report, if
it stands without major changes, raises very serious questions about the
veracity of the serological data in the paper," Baltimore said. "Therefore, I
am asking the other authors to join with me in requesting that the journal
retract the paper until such time as the questions are resolved. It is up to
Thereza Imanishi-Kari to resolve them.";    Baltimore had insisted previously
that the charges leveled against Imanishi-Kari were groundless, a conclusion
that had been supported by the three previous scientific reviews of the Cell
paper conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tufts University
and an earlier NIH investigating body.;    Neither Imanishi-Kari nor her
attorney would comment on the report's conclusions.  </TEXT>
