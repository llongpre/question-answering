   For years, many elite colleges and universities
have cooperated to figure out amounts of financial aid they should
give to students, but now federal antitrust investigators are
investigating the practice.
   Justice Department officials Wednesday acknowledged an
investigation was under way, but refused to disclose details.
   ``Antitrust division investigations are not a matter of public
record,'' agency spokesman David Runkel said.
   Financial aid for college students totaled some $26 billion last
year, said Kathleen Brouder, head of College Scholarship Service
information services in New York.
   She noted that colleges began working together in the 1950s,
when the Soviet-U.S. space race set off a flurry of scholarship,
loan and grant-giving by governments and institutions seeking to
beef up American education.
   The schools' objective has been to avoid bidding wars for
students, Ms. Brouder said.
   ``There was intense bidding, and people were concerned about the
fact that aid might be going in amounts that didn't need to go to
people, and they were very concerned about scarce institutional
resources,'' Ms. Brouder said.
   The Justice Department would not comment on what prompted the
investigation.
   On May 2, The Wall Street Journal reported the practice by 23
elite schools of meeting formally once a year to decide how much
each applicant for aid could afford.
   This is how it hypothetically works: Yale decides the Smiths can
pay $3,000 toward daughter Joan's education. But Dartmouth's aid
formula reckons the Smiths can only afford $2,000. The two schools
then work out the difference until they agree on a figure, say
$2,900. When Joan Smith receives acceptance letters from Yale and
Dartmouth, they both say she can receive financial aid, short of
$2,900.
   This year more than 10,000 high school seniors and their
families were subject to this arrangement, the Journal said.
   Schools named in this practice: Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, the
University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Yale, Amherst, Barnard,
Bowdoin, Bryn Mawr, Colby, Mount Holyoke, Middlebury, Smith,
Trinity, Tufts, Vassar, Wellesley, Wesleyan and Williams.
   Many schools on that list said Wednesday they were not the
subject of an investigation. Others, including Harvard, the
University of Chicago and Tufts University, declined to comment on
how they figure financial aid.
   But William Cotter, president of Colby College in Waterville,
Maine, said the probe appears to revolve around the possible fixing
of salaries, fees, tuition and financial-aid requirements.
   He denied Colby was fixing costs with other schools. ``There is
absolutely no agreement on salary and tuition,'' Cotter said. ``We
compete vigorously with one another for students. We compete
vigorously for faculty.''
   Like other officials at schools contacted, Amherst College
spokeswoman Terry Allen said: ``We believe we are in compliance
with the law. But if it is determined that we are not, we will do
everything to comply.''
