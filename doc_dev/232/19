   There were differences in culture and style in a
television linkup between Soviet and American students and
scholars, but the students and 10 panelists agreed that the two
countries are making progress in breaking down barriers.
   The two-hour forum Saturday joined 350 undergraduates at Tufts
University's downtown campus with 200 Moscow State University
students.
   Not accustomed to the American style of TV answers, the Soviets
often strayed from the questioning and read prepared speeches
detailing minor points in Soviet nuclear history.
   At one juncture, Soviet moderator Yevgeny P. Velikhov said,
``It's a lecture. We have to teach the students something here.''
   Andrey Kokoshin, deputy director of the Institute for U.S.A. and
Canada, told a U.S. questioner the superpowers are moving past Cold
War tensions to begin ``to clear off layers of mutual fears.''
   ``It seems to me what we are doing now in a first step to
disarmament should create a new basis, a new faith to increase
trust in each other,'' Kokoshin said.
   The satellite-relayed ``space bridge'' forum was the first of
three between Tufts and Moscow State on the nuclear arms race and
Cold War politics. The sessions are part of a course devised by
Tufts professor Martin J. Sherwin.
   The panel included two Americans who worked on the top-secret
Manhattan Project that developed the first atomic bomb in 1945, and
a Soviet researcher who helped build that country's first nuclear
weapon in 1949.
   Students and scientists frequently interrupted each other with
applause, the loudest when Sherwin praised Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's efforts to ease nuclear tensions.
   ``I think there's not a single person here who thinks he will be
able to survive a nuclear bomb,'' said Alexei Milayev, a Soviet
physics student. ``We are gathered here in the final analysis to
think about what must be done to prevent a nuclear war.''
   Velikhov, vice president for physics and mathematics for the
Soviet Academy of Sciences, noted the forum came 40 years after the
U.N. Committee on Atomic Energy abandoned its effort to ban nuclear
weapons.
   ``Today we are at the first stages of a non-nuclear world,'' he
said. Velikhov said the recent superpower arms reduction treaty
signed in December ``is the first encouraging step. We believe, in
a new international situation, we will succceed in resolving the
question.''
   Mark Anstendig, 21, a Tufts junior history major from Edgemont,
N.Y., said afterward the forum went a long way to promoting better
understanding.
   ``I think there was good rapport on both sides,'' he said.
``It'll promote better feelings. I think it's a good microcosm of
what could happen.''
