   A scientist won't testify at a Congressional panel
investigating accusations that she falsified data in a genetics
research paper she had written with a Nobel Prize-winner, her
attorney said Friday.
   ``She feels very much hounded ... by an unwarranted intervention
and intrusion by the government into the scientific process,'' said
Bruce A. Singal, attorney for Dr. Thereza Imanishi-Kari of Tufts
University.
   Imanishi-Kari is declining to testify Monday before a House
subcommittee reviewing charges she misrepresented research reported
in a 1986 article published in the scientific journal Cell.
   The committee's investigation has focused on forensic studies
performed on Imanishi-Kari's notebooks by Secret Service
specialists who allegedly found as many as 40 pages were prepared
up to two years after their recorded dates.
   Monday's hearing also was scheduled to examine a May 4 forensics
study that suggests the Boston pathologist made fraudulent tape
recordings to support the paper, which was researched at Tufts and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   ``This a case study of how institutions respond or don't respond
... when there are questions or allegations about the quality or
accuracy or integrity of research,'' said Dennis Fitzgibbons, a
spokesman for the subcommittee.
   The Congressional investigation began in 1986 after a former MIT
researcher charged she could not duplicate the published study,
which examined the immune cells in genetically altered mice.
   Investigations were conducted by both MIT and Tufts, where
Imanishi-Kari now works, but both schools reported the research
required no corrections.
   The National Institutes of Health also has investigated the
charges, but Singal said his client would not cooperate unless the
panel detailed the allegations against her.
   ``This is becoming an annual rite of spring, being invited back
to the Dingell committee every May,'' Singal said.
   Imanishi-Kari testified a year ago before the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations chaired by Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich.
   At that time, she told the committee that her notebooks had
nothing to do with the published experiments and showed only that
``I am not a neat person.''
   David Baltimore, an MIT molecular biologist and co-author of the
study, has joined other scientists backing Imanishi-Kari's claim
that the notebook had no bearing on the work.
   ``It is apparent that, after years of investigation, a
reasonable person must conclude that the Cell paper was an honest
report of collaborative research,'' said Baltimore, a 1975 Nobel
laureate who has been named president of Rockefeller University in
New York.
   In a letter sent Thursday to Dingell, Singal said the latest
hearings were ``nothing more than a rehash'' that his client would
decline to attend.
   ``We frankly do not understand why this same set of so-called
findings is now being recycled one year later,'' Singal wrote. ``It
is as insignificant and irrelevant now as it was a year ago to any
legitimate scientific issue.''
   Singal said the Secret Service report issued May 4, and made
public by his client Thursday, contained ``deficiencies and
omissions which ... preclude the possibility of any meaningful
response at this time.''
   He said Imanishi-Kari would be willing to respond to the charges
her tapes were fraudulent after more information and clarification
of the charges was made available.
   Fitzgibbons declined to elaborate on the report, which was to be
the subject of Secret Service testimony Monday.
