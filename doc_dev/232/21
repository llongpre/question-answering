   Tufts University President Jean Mayer, one of
the nation's best-known nutritionists, has taken much of the
confusion out of eating well and losing weight.
   ``Dr. Jean Mayer's Diet &amp; Nutrition Guide,'' written with Jeanne
P. Goldberg, provides a compact and generally sensible path for
children and adults, but is somewhat disorganized and fairly
conservative.
   Mayer and Goldberg, a Tufts School of Nutrition professor, are
widely known for their newspaper column ``Food for Thought,''
written in a question-and-answer format. The same device is used in
the book, at the end of each chapter, which can make information
hard to find.
   For example, yogurt is discussed both in the main section of a
chapter that inclues adapting recipes to make them healthier and in
the question-and-answer section at the end of the chapter.
   With the plethora of diet plans available and labels on food
difficult to decipher, consumers need someone to cut a path through
it all. And Mayer and Goldberg offer reasonable advice and clear
explanations.
   Their book includes information on preventing food poisoning,
eating well in restaurants, vitamins and minerals, food
requirements at different ages and for those with various health
problems or conditions, and how to lose weight sensibly.
   That Americans are doing a poor job of feeding themselves seems
clear.
   ``You would probably think it outrageous if we suggested that
our paleolithic ancestors crouching in their caves may have been
routinely eating a better diet than do many Americans today,'' the
authors say.
   It need not be the case, and beginning with a tour of the
supermarket, the authors warn that shoppers' best nutritional
interests are not always served by marketing professionals.
   Overall, Mayer and Goldberg recommend a low-fat diet consisting
of foods either fresh or lightly processed, passing by many of the
prepared foods that have come on the market in the five decades
since the opening of the first supermarket, a King Kullen in New
York.
   They warn about tricky food labels: An ounce of all sorts of
cereals may have the same number of calories, but an ounce of corn
flakes is about a cup, while an ounce of granola may be just
one-quarter cup. Manufacturers are not required to use comparable
serving sizes, and many foods have no nutrition labeling at all.
   But while the authors note that labels can be vague about the
types of fats used, they do not point out that because
manufacturers must list ingredients in descending order by weight,
various kinds of sugar won't appear all together; shoppers should
beware of how they add up.
   There is plenty of information in the book on what various terms
on labels mean; how to get enough protein, even in a vegetarian
diet, without eating too much fat; how to adjust favorite receipes.
   Weight-loss advice is simple and traditional: Eat fewer
calories, generally by cutting fats and sugar, and exercise more. A
month's worth of menus is included.
   Where government scientists or agencies clash with other groups,
the book tends to be conservative. For example, on pesticides, it
repeats old arguments about toxins that naturally occur in foods
and concludes, ``But when you mesh all these factors together, and
weigh the risks and benefits, a general outcry against pesticides
is unwarranted.''
   With almost half the restaurant dollars going to fast-food
outlets, the appendix listing the calorie, salt and fat content of
fast-food items from three chains is very useful.
   ``Dr. Jean Mayer's Diet and Nutrition Guide'' is being published
in April by Pharos Books.
