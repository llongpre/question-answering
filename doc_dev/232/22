   WALTHAM, Mass. -- Jerome P. Kassirer, a Tufts University
School of Medicine kidney specialist, was named editor in
chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, effective in
July, said the Massachusetts Medical Society, publisher of
the journal.
   Dr. Kassirer, 58 years old, will succeed Arnold S. Relman,
67, who last July said he planned to step down.

   The New England Journal of Medicine is considered one of
the most influential medical journals. Dr. Relman, during his
14 years at the Journal's helm, was known for helping to set
the national medical agenda by taking strong positions on
issues such as medical quality versus health-care cost
containment.
   Dr. Kassirer, who received his medical degree at the State
University of New York in Buffalo, is known for work on how
doctors make decisions when treating patients. At Tufts, he
is vice chairman of the department of medicine and has
received eight outstanding-teaching awards. "His style is
nonconfrontational," said a physician acquainted with Dr.
Kassirer. "I expect him to deal with issues in a firm and
open manner."
