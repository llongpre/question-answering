   You may know that raw pork is not safe, or that a bulging can
spells trouble. But how aware are you of the safety of other items
in your kitchen? Take this quiz to find out.
   Is it safe or risky to eat ...
   1. Hot dogs that have been stored in an unopened package in the
refrigerator for 10 days?
   2. A bruised or moldy piece of fruit?
   3. Frozen ham that was thawed on the counter?
   4. An unopened jar of mayonnaise that has been in the
refrigerator for six months?
   5. A baked potato left out on the counter from the night before?
   6. Meat loaf that's pink in the middle after cooking?
   7. Raw ground beef that turns brown after a day or two of
refrigeration?
   8. An uncooked potato with a greenish cast?
   9. Lettuce or other produce moistened by poultry drippings in a
grocery bag?
   10. Steak that was thawed in the refrigerator and then refrozen?
   11. Cooked shrimp that was never deveined?
   12. Mustard or ketchup with a black, crusty ring around the rim
of the jar?
   13. Moldy or shriveled peanuts?

   ANSWERS
   1. Safe. Hot dogs that come in vacuum-sealed packages can be
kept in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Once opened, you can
keep them for about seven days, carefully wrapped in plastic.
   2. Safe if it's just bruised. But possibly risky if the bruised
portion has become moldy. Some molds can produce harmful toxins,
and it's not yet clear whether fruit molds are among them. The best
bet is to cut away the moldy section, which should also remove any
toxins that might be pesent.
   3. Risky. Many people think they can take chances with ham
because it has been smoked or salted. But these processes don't
make the meat immune to bacterial contamination, especially since a
number of manufacturers are lowering the salt content of cured
meats. As with any meat, the safest way to thaw ham is in the
refrigerator.
   4. Safe. It's a misconception that foods prepared with
mayonnaise may go bad sooner. In fact, its high acid and salt
content may actually inhibit bacterial growth somewhat. You can
keep an opened jar of mayonnaise in the refrigerator for up to a
year, provided you don't let it sit at room temperature for
extended periods.
   5. Risky. We usually don't think of potatoes as a likely source
of food poisoning, but there have been reports of deadly botulism
in people who ate foil-wrapped baked potatoes left at room
temperature for a day or more, even when they were reheated.
Leftovers of most foods should be promptly refrigerated.
   6. Risky. Ground meat undergoes a great deal of handling,
compared to other forms. This increases the likelihood of bacterial
contamination. For this reason, the USDA suggests cooking meat loaf
until it is brown or at least brownish-pink in the center. An even
better guide is to cook it to an internal temperature of 170
degrees Fahrenheit, cheching with a thermometer, particularly if
the meat loaf contains pork.
   7. Safe. Whether it's brown or pink has to do with the amount of
oxygen with which it has come into contact. As a general rule,
however, don't keep raw ground beef in the refrigerator longer than
two days, and don't use it under any circumstances if it doesn't
smell right or was left unrefrigerated for any length of time.
   8. Risky. Green-skinned potatoes contain a chemical called
solanine, which can cause gastrointestinal illness. You can use
green potatoes if you peel them well and remove a layer of flesh
underneath the skin.
   9. Risky. Uncooked poultry juices may contain harmful bacteria
that could lead to trouble when they get into foods that are eaten
raw. If the produce is really saturated, you'd better not use it.
But if contact was minimal, you can remove outer sections or rinse
and peel.
   10. Safe _ especially if some ice crystals remain. Make sure to
thaw the frozen meat in the refrigerator the second time around. Be
aware, too, that refreezing might cause flavor and texture
deterioration. You might get better flavor and texture if you cook
the meat the first time it is thawed, then refreeze it.
   11. Safe. You can eat shrimp that hasn't been deveined as long
as you cook it. The black line running down the back is actually
the intestines of the shrimp, which are more susceptible to
contamination.
   12. Safe. The ring is the result of an interaction of the
contents with air, not a sign of spoilage. Simply wipe it off and
use the remaining contents.
   13. Risky. When you crack open peanut shells only to find sickly
looking nuts, don't eat them. The types of mold that grow on nuts
(as well as on grains) can produce aflatoxins, some of which are
very potent carcinogens.
