   Product directions often seem simple.
``Press firmly'' is a typical instruction. But how firmly?
   Design engineers at Tufts University are researching ways to
make such orders more specific.
   They began after learning that owners of homes with a certain
kind of gas valve were asked to test them by pressing a knob firmly
without forcing it; with no more than those directions, the owners
were expected to determine whether their valves were defective and
possibly dangerous.
   ``The goal of the research is the ability to craft phrases that
will produce well-defined physical responses,'' said Professor John
G. Kreifeldt.
   A graduate student in design engineering at Tufts, Kodali V.N.
Rao, developed an experiment to see if product directions could be
made more simple.
   ``From nail polish to computers, cameras to hair sprays and
toasters to tanks, the designer needs to be well-informed about the
consequences resulting from use or misuse of the product,'' said
Rao. ``As designers, we have to decide that a switch should work
with a certain amount of force.''
   But how does one go about communicating that, he wondered.
   In his research, he asked about 240 people to squeeze a device
attached to a meter, either gently or hard.
   The results varied considerably. The instruction ``firm''
covered a range of two kilograms to 32 kilograms of force.
   The project's most surprising result: when the instructions were
changed to ``squeeze not very hard and not too gently,'' the test
participants were remarkably consistent. Ninety percent of the
participants applied 12.9 to 14.6 kilograms of force.
   Rao said that the word ``not'' in instructions causes people to
be more cautious about how much pressure they exert.
   ``Force is a perceivable thing that people can use through
experience,'' said Rao. ``One thing is sure: one-word instructions
don't convey enough information. If you say `Do this,' people tend
to get carried away by presuppositions, so it is important to give
users parameters.''
