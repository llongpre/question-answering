   Kathy Foster, a third-year student at Tufts
University School of Medicine, was caring for a 10-year-old boy
with cancer last year when she noticed his depression over being
tutored while other youngsters were out playing.
   ``I thought, that's something medical students could do _ help
kids with their school work while they're at the hospital
undergoing chemotherapy,'' said Foster in an interview Saturday.
   Foster organized a group called Kids in Chemotherapy Support
(KICS) and passed out a questionnaire to other students to find out
how many might want to donate their time. She was amazed by the
response _ more than 75 Tufts medical students signed up.
   In order to link young cancer patients with medical students,
Foster contacted Dr. Lawrence Wolfe, assistant professor of
pediatrics at Tufts Medical School and chief of pediatric
hematology-oncology at the New England Medical Center. So far,
seven KICS students and patients have been matched.
   The program is similar to the Big Brother-Big Sister
organization. But the medical students help the children through
the kind of difficulties most kids fortunately don't face.
   ``The older kids are really concerned about their appearance,
such as hair loss or being too thin. Or their faces may be swollen
from steroids,'' said Foster.
   Students learn to help the kids cope with their problems
cautiously.
   ``You can't just come right out and ask them how they feel about
losing their hair,'' she said. ``But after playing a board game
with them four or five times, a lot of kids will confide in you and
say they're afraid of cancer.''
   Many children spend their eight hours of chemotherapy in the
hospital alone, with family or friends. Foster said she is helping
a 15-year-old Vietnamese girl who has Oriental cholangitis, a rare
gastrointestinal disorder. The girl lives with her grandmother and
other relatives, who attach a social stigman to her illness, Foster
said.
   Chris Aho, spokeswoman for the medical school, said school
officials were surprised at the number of students who signed up
for the program.
   ``Part of it is they're so anxious to be with patients,'' said
Aho. ``They want to help so much. They're looking for that
humanitarian aspect in people.''
   The students and the children often go on group outings. Last
spring, they attended a Red Sox baseball game at Fenway Park. The
highlight of the game, said Foster, wsa watching seven-year-old
Derek Walsh, a KICS child, enjoy the game.
   Walsh had a Wilms's tumor on his kidney but following surgery
and chemotherapy, he is cancer-free at this point. He was strong
enough to play baseball this spring.
   Foster said many of the students have formed close bonds with
their young friends and their families.
   ``When you are assigned to a child, you have that childthe whole
time they are undergoing chemotherapy,'' said Foster. ``Some
parents have even invited students over for dinner. The students
involved in these programs just love it. They wouldn't give it up
for anything.''
