   MEDFORD, Mass. -- Scientists at Tufts University here
developed a hair-thin fiber optic sensor for threading into
arteries to detect levels of various blood components.
   The device represents a potentially important step toward
a long-sought goal in medicine -- continuous monitoring of
acidity, oxygen and other crucial substances in the blood.
Such monitors could give physicians early warning of
impending crises in critically ill patients or in patients
undergoing surgery. The devices also someday may be used in
automated systems that release drugs into the body in doses
precisely controlled to yield desired therapeutic benefits
and minimize side effects.

   Blood tests now typically require medical workers to draw
blood into tubes for analyzing in remote laboratories, a
process that can take minutes to hours. The method can lead
to errors from naturally occurring changes in the chemistry
of blood as it is moved, from contamination of the equipment
it touches and from mixups in handling.
   During the past few years, bedside blood analyzers have
been developed to speed measurements of certain blood
components. But these devices require extracting blood
samples from patients, hence still have time-delay and other
drawbacks compared with the continuous, inside-the-body
monitoring envisioned with fiber optic devices. Some 10 to 12
companies "have serious high-dollar projects" to develop such
continuous monitors, said Stephen Shapiro, a medical devices
specialist at Wilkerson Group Inc., a medical industry
consulting firm in New York.
   In a report in today's issue of the journal Nature, the
Tufts researchers said they developed a prototype sensor
system consisting of a light-analyzing device connected to a
single optical fiber that is designed to be threaded into an
artery through a needle. The fiber, made of light-conducting
strands of glass or plastic, has multiple specks of
"indicator" chemicals on its tip. The indicators are special
dyes through which light beams are passed; the intensity of
the light emitted varies with the level of selected chemicals
with which the dyes are in contact.
   The device works by sending light through the fiber to its
sensing tip. A camera-like device then measures light that
returns through the fiber after passing through one of the
dyes.
   The prototype measures acidity and carbon dioxide, said
David Walt, one of the Tufts researchers. The scientists
expect soon to add a third indicator dye to measure oxygen,
he added. Later they hope to add indicators for electrolytes
such as sodium, for enzymes released into the blood when a
heart attack is starting and for other substances. Outside
experts said the Tufts device appears to be the first sensor
that can register multiple substances with a single optical
fiber -- potentially making it cheaper, simpler to
manufacture and easier to get into arteries than alternative
sensors being developed.
   Dr. Walt, a chemist, cautioned that several major problems
still must be solved to use such devices for continuous blood
monitoring over several days. One is finding a way to prevent
clots that occur when foreign materials contact the blood.
Another issue is sensor stability-indictor dyes tend to get
bleached out over time, making their signals fade.
   Dr. Walt added that several companies have "approached us"
regarding development of the device for medical or other uses
-- such as monitoring toxic chemicals during environmental
cleanups -- but declined to disclose their names. He
estimated that a marketable sensor costing several thousand
dollars might be developed in five years or so.
