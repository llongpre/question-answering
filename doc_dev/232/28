   Michael Dukakis boosted economic
nationalism while tossing barbs at his Republican opponents
Tuesday, promising as president to restore American leadership in
science and technology and translate that into dominance of global
markets.
   Dukakis said that he and Democratic running mate Lloyd Bentsen
would be aggressive advocates for U.S. companies and workers while
Republican George Bush was ``satisfied with today and complacent
about tomorrow.''
   Dukakis delighted the partisan crowd at Tufts University with
new salvos at the GOP ticket, saying the ``Republican campaign song
seems to be, `Don't Worry; Be Happy,''' a tune played at a recent
Bush event.
   ``I want us to be happy, but I also want us to be concerned,''
Dukakis said. Then, lashing out at the bottom half of the
Republican ticket, he added: ``Dan Quayle asks us to believe that
if he ever had to fill in for George Bush, America could get by on
a right wing and a prayer.''
   Dukakis ticked off a six-point plan aimed at improving U.S.
science teaching and technology as well as product development. And
he spoke of the ``new economic patriotism'' that has become a
staple of his attempt to win support from blue-collar workers and
middle class voters concerned about their jobs and effects of the
federal budget and trade deficits.
   ``We have a choice,'' Dukakis said. ``Will we keep running in
place or will we forge ahead? Will the future belong to our
competitors, or to us? Will we sell out more and more of our land
and our factories and our banks, or will we take charge of our
future?''
   ``Together we can build a future where the best products in the
world are designed by American minds, built by American hands and
produce good profits and good paychecks here on American soil,'' he
said.
   Bush, meanwhile, in a speech prepared for delivery to college
students in Seattle, accused Dukakis of ``protectionist
demagoguery'' in his criticism of foreign ownership of U.S.
businesses.
   ``My opponent needs an issue, and he's willing to scare people
to find it,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis, on another subject, also appeared on national
television to denounce what he called the ``crass and cynical''
campaign tactics of Bush in connection with attacks on Dukakis as
soft on crime. In addition, he attended a breakfast with Vietnam
veterans and recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor and
spent several hours preparing for his second and final debate with
Bush Thursday night in Los Angeles.
   Dukakis was flying to California later Tuesday.
   At Tufts University, about two dozen Bush supporters gathered
outside and chanted ``Bush '88'' as Dukakis arrived and left.
   Inside, Dukakis declared, ``If we can build the greatest
spaceship the world has ever seen, then we ought to be able to
build the televisions and the VCRs that compete and that win in
foreign markets.''
   The six points discussed by Dukakis, most of them proposals he
has touched on earlier in the campaign, include:
   _Having the National Science Foundation issue annual,
state-by-state reports on the quality of science education.
   _Establishing seminars to help science instructors improve their
teaching.
   _Calling on scientists and engineers, including retirees, to
teach classes.
   _Persuading industry to set up worksite technology training and
retraining centers.
   _A nationwide network of centers of excellence modeled after
state programs designed to foster research and new product
development.
   _Cooperation between U.S. companies in advanced technologies
such as superconductivity and consumer electronics.
   ``We need a commander in chief who stands up and fights for
American companies, American products and American jobs,'' said
Dukakis, who said Bentsen would be his top deputy in the trade war.
``I want us to begin selling cars and computers and compact discs
to the Germans and the Japanese and the Koreans, not arms to the
ayatollah.''
   Dukakis also joked about his ``October surprise,'' a speech last
week in which he warned against growing foreign investment in the
United States only to find out after the speech that the company at
which he sounded the warning was owned by an Italian firm.
   ``I'm not against foreign ownership,'' Dukakis said after making
light of his mistake. ``I'm against the policies that make us
dependent. I'm against a fire sale of America.''
   During the morning telvision appearance Dukakis appeared upbeat
about the debate and repeated his contention that Bush was
exploiting a tragedy involving a Massachusetts furlough program for
political gain because of Bush's own failure as the Reagan
administration's point man on crime and drugs.
   Speaking on NBC's ``Today'' program, he denounced Bush for
repeatedly detailing the violent assault of a Maryland couple by a
murderer who escaped while on a Massachusetts furlough.
   ``To use these human tragedies for your own political purposes,
I think, is really a very crass and cynical thing,'' said Dukakis,
who said similar tragedies have occurred in the federal furlough
program and in one Ronald Reagan supported while governor of
California.
