   A noted pediatrician says his patients will
suffer and die because of attacks by a powerful congressman on the
work of a Nobel Prize-winning researcher.
   ``I can promise you that organizations of patients, when made
fully aware of what you are doing, are going to fight this tooth
and nail,'' Dr. David Nathan wrote to Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
   Nathan is physician-in-chief at Children's Hospital in Boston
and professor of pediatrics at the Harvard Medical School.
   Dingell, chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, spent most of Thursday in a
hearing room attacking the handling of a dispute over a research
project led by David Baltimore, a molecular biologist at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who won the Nobel Prize in
1975 for his work on cancer-causing viruses.
   ``An attack on him is an attack on our patients. ... The David
Baltimores of this world have made it possible for them to live. It
is as simple as that,'' Nathan wrote in his April 26 letter, which
was distributed at the hearing.
   Nathan's letter appeared to be part of a growing effort by
scientists to defend Baltimore. The journal Science reported last
week, for example, that major figures in science were in touch with
minority Republican members of the subcommittee.
   A review committee is being reconstituted to look into new
allegations of missing data raised by Dr. Margot O'Toole, said
James Wyngaarden, director of the National Institutes of Health.
   Dr. O'Toole's dispatch of 17 pages of data to two NIH staffers
in 1986 started the long controversy over a paper in the scientific
journal Cell that year by Baltimore, Dr. Thereza Imanishi-Kari of
Tufts University and four others.
   Dr. O'Toole, at the time working on other projects in Dr.
Imanishi-Kari's lab, said the 17 pages showed that conclusions of
the paper were not supported by the original laboratory data.
   Reviews by MIT and Tufts determined that the conclusions,
dealing with the immune responses of mice bred with an extra immune
system gene from another species, were fully supported by some
1,000 data pages and no action was needed.
   A review panel convened by NIH, the one now being resurrected,
said that although there was no fraud or misrepresentation, errors
had occurred that should be corrected. Baltimore has sent one
correction letter to Cell and is preparing a supplemental letter to
deal with the latest accusation.
   A report from Secret Service experts said at least five and
possibly 25 pages in one of Dr. Imanishi-Kari's notebooks were
filled in as much as two years after the dates on the page. At
least two dates were changed.
   The two notebooks studied by the Secret Service had nothing to
do with the Cell article and showed only ``I am not a neat person
... very bad with dates,'' she said.
   She said she would often use the date on which data were taken,
perhaps logged by laboratory equipment, when writing them on paper
months later.
   Wyngaarden said he was establishing an Office of Scientific
Integrity to monitor and conduct investigations of possible
scientific impropriety. The Health and Human Services Department is
establishing an Office of Scientific Integrity Review to establish
policies to deal with scientific misconduct.
