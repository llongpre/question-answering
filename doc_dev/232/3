   With society's increased attention on the environmental threat posed by toxic compounds, Tufts University plans to begin the nation's first collegiate program in hazardous-waste management. 

   "We've received a lot of support from industry, because there's no other program like this in the country right now," Gene Blake, associate director of the Tufts Center for Environmental Management, said. 
"There's a real need for it." 

   The interdisciplinary master's degree course is designed to educate students on issues related to hazardous waste and will focus on environmental health, science, policy and technology, school officials said. 

   Representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Audobon Society, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering and several engineering consultants and Tufts faculty members will develop the curriculum before classes start next fall. 

   The EPA has targeted hundreds of sites across the country for cleanup of hazardous materials under its Superfund program. 

   "We're hearing from government and citizens groups that it's hard to find good people aware of the issues surrounding current policy, technology and research," Mr. Blake said. 

   Linfield C. Brown, chairman of Tufts' civil engineering department, said that students will be required to have some background in calculus, chemistry and biology, but that the program will focus on risk assessment, management and communication, health effects and environmental management regulations. 

   Mr. Blake said the new venture is designed to do more than just teach students how to clean up hazardous-waste sites. 
"We want to teach people how to avoid waste problems in the first place," he said. 

   For a final one-semester course, all students will be placed in small teams to act as consultants and meet with federal and state officials to develop solutions for existing environmental management or policy problems. 

   Tufts' Department of Urban and Environmental Policy is assisting in development of the new program. 
Students can complete the program in one year full time, or in three years on a part-time basis.
