At an age when most of their contemporaries are worrying about simply keeping 
their blood pumping through their veins, 90-year-olds in a nursing home in 
Boston have been pumping iron. 
</P>
<P>
The frail, institutionalized men and women have undertaken regular weight 
training to improve their strength and mobility and thereby reduce their 
susceptibility to injury in falls and accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the six women and four men in the original pilot program improved their 
strength threefold to fourfold over an eight-week period, and all except one 
who dropped out because of a previous hernia are "stronger than they had been 
many years previously," physicians from Tufts University report today in the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the patients who walked with a cane at the beginning of the program can 
now manage without it, one can rise from a chair without using his arms for the 
first time in years, and five of them walk 50% faster. All are more mobile, 
have better balance and have suffered fewer falls since the training began, 
said geriatrician Maria A. Fiatarone of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of this study is that it shows that, even at a very advanced 
age, physical frailty is treatable," said Evan C. Hadley, chief of the 
geriatric branch at the National Institute on Aging. "This could greatly reduce 
the need for nursing home admissions by maintaining the mobility of older 
people and thus their ability to live independently." 
</P>
<P>
According to census figures, more than 3.5 million Americans are over the age 
of 85 and 1 million are over 90. 
</P>
<P>
The study was so successful, Fiatarone said in a telephone interview, that the 
pilot trials have now been extended to about 30 additional people, one of whom 
is 100 years old, at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for Aged, and the first 
subjects have been enrolled in a continuing weight-training program. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the positive results from this pilot study, the National 
Institute on Aging and the National Center for Nursing Research have awarded 
$2.9 million to the Hebrew Center and seven other institutions for further 
studies on this and other interventions for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
"The exciting results from this study really served as an impetus for 
developing the (Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention 
Techniques) research project," Hadley said. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 people in the original program ranged in age from 86 to 96, with an 
average of 90. They had an average of 4.5 chronic diseases and had been 
institutionalized for an average of 3.4 years. Eight had a history of falls and 
seven habitually used a cane or walker. 
</P>
<P>
The subjects used a resistance training device. Sitting in a chair, they raised 
one leg at a time to lift a weight. At the beginning of the study, they could 
lift 17 pounds per leg on average. By the end, they could lift an average of 45 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
That response, Fiatarone and her colleagues wrote, "is remarkable in light of 
their very advanced age, extremely sedentary habits, multiple chronic disease 
and functional disabilities and nutritional inadequacies." 
</P>
<P>
Fiatarone emphasized that, like younger people, the patients lost some of their 
gains if they stopped exercising. When the subjects were assessed four weeks 
after the end of the pilot test, they had lost 30% of the strength they gained. 
Most went back to exercising.
