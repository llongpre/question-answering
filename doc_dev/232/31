<LEADPARA>  REGULAR walking and a high-calcium diet can prevent bone loss in some of the
millions of women who suffer from osteoporosis, according to Boston
researchers.;    A study of 36 women averaging 60 years old found that walking
for less than an hour four times a week staved off bone loss from the spine.
When a high-calcium drink was added to their diets, bone loss in women's hips
diminished, according to researchers at the Human Nutrition Research Center on
Aging at Tufts University.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Both exercise and dietary calcium were beneficial to the skeleton,
however, at different places," said Miriam E. Nelson, assistant professor of
nutrition at Tufts. The study was published in the May issue of the American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition.;    Nelson said dairy products are better than
calcium pills because they have sugars that aid the absorption of calcium.
Vitamin D, often added to milk, also aids calcium absorption, she said.;   
Exercise, blood pressure;  Male couch potatoes take heart: You may not have to
do much more than walk and climb a few stairs to lower your blood pressure if
it's just a little too high.;    A University of Connecticut study of men with
high blood pressure found that low- and moderate-intensity exercise
dramatically lowered the blood pressure of those whose blood pressure was
mildly elevated.;    "In terms of exercise's beneficial effects, more intense
exercise is not necessarily better," wrote Linda S. Pescatello, an exercise
physiologist at the university in Farmington, Conn. The study appears in the
May issue of Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association.  </TEXT>
