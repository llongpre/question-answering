   The Justice Department is asking several
prestigious universities for documents as part of an antitrust
investigation into how they set tuition and student aid rates,
officials say.
   The department, while declining to discuss the thrust of the
investigation, acknowledged that it is seeking certain documents.
   Daniel Steiner, general counsel at Harvard University, said the
request was for documents dealing with ``student financial aid,
budgeting and other fees and salaries.''
   Jonathan Kleinbard, vice president for news and community
affairs at the University of Chicago said today that his
institution was cooperating with a Justice Department request ``for
information concerning the procedures by which it establishes its
tuition.''
   ``Specifically, the ... department is interested in whether
institutions of higher education have entered into arrangements or
understandings as to prospective tuition rates that may violate
federal antitrust laws,'' he said.
   ``At no time has the University of Chicago participated in any
agreement or understanding with any other institution as to the
setting of its tuition,'' Kleinbard said. When asked about possible
agreements relating to financial aid, he said, ``We don't do it _
pure and simple.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel confirmed that
document requests ``have gone out to a number of colleges,'' but he
declined to disclose the subjects of the request.
   ``Antitrust division investigations are not a matter of public
record,'' he said.
   ``You can say this is in a preliminary stage,'' Runkel said,
adding that the first requests were made ``sometime earlier this
summer, perhaps six weeks ago.''
   ``Essentially, they've asked us to produce a lot of documents
with regard to our budget, how we budget,'' Richard Mersereau, a
spokesman for Brunswick, Maine's Bowdoin College, told The
Associated Press. ``It's an extensive amount of documentation, and
we are complying.''
   Universities have shared financial information about students
for years, even arranging to use copies of a single financial
statement submitted by parents of applicants seeking scholarships
and other aid.
   There have been reports that major universities agree among
themselves on the aid packages to be offered, generally mixtures of
scholarships, loans and campus jobs. Such agreements, if they
exist, would be of interest to the antitrust division, which
enforces the legal ban against price-fixing by private commercial
companies.
   There are well-known aid agreements among universities, such as
limits on athletic scholarships that members of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association may offer. Members of the Ivy
League have agreed not to offer athletic scholarships and to base
offers of financial aid on student need.
   Harvard's Steiner declined to say whether cooperating
universities agree on aid packages to be offered to applicants.
   The Washington Post said in today's editions the department's
requests had gone to 20 institutions, among them Harvard, Colby,
Amherst, Williams and Bowdoin colleges, Tufts and Wesleyan
universities and the University of Chicago.
   Harvard ``will be cooperating with the Justice Department in
giving them the data they've requested,'' Steiner said.
   At neighboring Tufts University in Medford, Mass., spokeswoman
Rosemarie Van Camp said, ``We will cooperate fully with the Justice
Department.''
   Colby spokesman Edward Hershey also confirmed that the school
had been served and had turned the matter over to counsel.
   ``They have asked for certain documents and we will, I'm sure,
attempt to respond appropriately,'' he said.
