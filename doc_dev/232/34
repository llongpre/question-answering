   Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour
Hersh is coming ``because you don't normally get this interesting
mix of people.'' Former CIA director William Colby will attend
``because I think someone needs to say a few good words about the
agency.''
   Hersh and Colby are among more than 30 experts and commentators
who plan to meet Friday at Tufts University for a two-day forum on
the role of covert aid and secrecy in U.S. foreign policy.
   The panelists include former and current members of the
intelligence community, military and defense officials,
journalists, educators and legal specialists. They represent
opinions ``from the left, right and center of the ideological
spectrum,'' forum coordinator Sherman Teichman said Thursday.
   Teichman said the conference, sponsored jointly by Tufts, the
National Security Archive, the U.S. Department of Defense and the
Center for the Study of Covert Action, will address more than such
obvious examples of covert action as the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``It is important to ask if the use of covert actions is a
necessary part of dealing with foreign governments,'' he said. ``If
it is a necessary evil and used to influence others to our way of
thinking, then how does a democracy justify its actions?''
   Topics at the forum include ``The Southeast Asian Experience: A
Case Study''; ``Lessons of Vietnam and Southeast Asia for the
1980s''; ``The Iran-Contra Affair: The Hostage Ransom, Iran-Israel
Arms Sale''; and ``Contra Support: Managing and Supplying a
Paramilitary Operation.''
   Also scheduled to attend are Bob Woodward of the Washington
Post; ``Pentagon Papers'' leaker Daniel Ellsberg; Thomas Polgar, a
former CIA station chief in Saigon; former Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton
of Missouri; and Scott Armstrong, executive director of the
National Security Archive.
   ``It seems like a rather contentious group of people,'' said
Colby, now an attorney in Washington, D.C. Colby said he will
defend his opinion that ``covert action is a regular part of
American foreign policy. It's perfectly compatible with American
democracy.''
   Eagleton has prepared a paper reviewing the history of
congressional oversight of covert activities. He said the symposium
is particularly timely because of a pending Senate bill that would
plug loopholes in existing laws that allowed the Reagan
administration not to notify Congress at the time of the Iran arms
deal.
   ``There can be a time and circumstances where covert action is
clearly in the American interest,'' said Eagleton. ``But the
question is: Under what conditions of shared knowledge does our
government undertake covert action?''
   Hersh, with tongue slightly in cheek, said he has split views on
the need for covert operations.
   ``I have mixed feelings about it because on one hand, people
like me get to write books on it and make a lot of money,'' he
said. ``On the other hand, I don't see, especially when you're
talking about things like Chile, what (secret actions) have done
for the American people.''
