   The National Institutes of Health and two
congressional panels are about to launch investigations into
charges that a molecular biology manuscript written by a Nobel
laureate and his colleagues misrepresented research data.
   An official at the NIH said a special committee has been named
to review allegations of scientific misconduct involving a study on
duplicating immunity cells in laboratory mice. The project was
headed by Nobel laureate David Baltimore, director of the Whitehead
Institute in Boston, and Theresa Imanishi-Kari of Tufts University.
Four other researchers were co-authors.
   Mary Miers, an executive in the NIH office that investigates
allegations of research misconduct, said the special committee was
organized after two NIH scientists, Walter W. Stewart and Ned
Feder, ``raised issues'' about research performed by Imanishi-Kari.
   Miers said Stewart and Feder reported their allegations in a
manuscript that has been provided to the committee. The two men,
who in the past have raised questions about the credibility of
other research efforts, declined to discuss the case with a
reporter.
   Baltimore, who won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for research in
cellular biology, said in an interview on Friday that he welcomed
the NIH investigation and hopes it will silence the charges of
Stewart and Feder who he said have ``acted like a judge and jury''
in the case.
   Testimony on the controversy will be heard by two separate
congressional subcommittees, both of which have called Stewart and
Feder as witnesses.
   On Monday, the House subcommittee on government operations and
human resources will hear the NIH scientists, along with other
witnesses on the general subject of scientific fraud.
   On Tuesday, the House subcommittee on oversight and
investigation will plow some of the same ground. Feder and Stewart
will again testify, along with a researcher, Margot O'Toole, who
assisted Imanishi-Kari in the controversial study.
   The study co-authored by Baltimore, Imanishi-Kari and four other
researchers was published in the prestigious journal ``Cell'' on
April 25, 1986. The paper, titled ``Altered Repertoire of
Endogenous Immunoglobulin Gene Expression in Transgenic Mice
Containing a Rearranged Mu Heavy Chain Gene,'' deals with the
replication of immunity cells in a type of genetically altered
laboratory mice.
   Baltimore said he performed the molecular biology work that
contributed to half of the paper, and that Imanishi-Kari conducted
the research that dealt with the immune system.
   The allegations of misconduct, he said, stem from a ``difference
in interpretation'' of research conducted in the laboratory of
Imanishi-Kari, who then was at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   He said O'Toole, who was a post-doctoral student assisting in
the research, disagreed with an interpretation by Imanishi-Kari of
how a monoclonal antibody attached itself to types of immune cells.
   O'Toole brought charges of misconduct against Imanishi-Kari, but
her allegations were investigated and dismissed by officials at MIT
and at Tufts.
   ``The subject was dropped until somebody got Stewart and Feder
interested in the case,'' said Baltimore.
