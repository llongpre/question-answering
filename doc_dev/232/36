<LEADPARA>  When Tom Kolp got out of business school in the early '80s, he knew even then
he didn't quite fit the corporate mold.;   While everyone set their sights on
a financial killing, he got fired from his first job, as an engineering
manager at AT&amp;T in Washington, D.C., just six months out of the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School -- for dressing up like a rabbit and throwing a
pie at a colleague on his birthday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "They said it was conduct unbecoming a manager," the easygoing, 34-year-old
Iowa native explains. "I was definitely a mutant.";   But now, almost 10 years
later, as the money-grubbing '80s give way to what many say are the
back-to-basics '90s, Kolp seems ahead of the corporate pack rather than out of
step.;   As business people are increasingly buffeted by a recession-plagued
economy that is leaving thousands out of work, as status-seeking yuppies are
ridiculed rather than admired, and as growing numbers of people search to put
more meaning into their work lives, Tom Kolp has done exactly what a growing
number of people are doing. And if they haven't yet, the experts say, they're
thinking hard about it and scraping together resources.;   Kolp dropped out.
And while his decision to start his own business mirrors that of many who have
exited the rat race, his product -- freshly baked bread made from just-milled
wheat, and huge chocolate chip cookies -- and his staff -- young,
well-educated college graduates -- seem particularly telling of the mood of
the '90s and changes in the corporate world.;   "I was tired of working for
people who were just looking out for the almighty dollar," explains Kolp, who
last worked as a real estate and litigation consultant.;   The smell of the
just-out-of-the-oven bread permeates the air at his Great Harvest shop in
Evanston, Ill.;   "I want to live a life I'm proud of and contribute
something," says Kolp. "It sounds corny but that's what I want. Bread is
basic. You make it and you sell it.";   He has a young, energetic group
working for him -- all with degrees from prestigious institutions such as
Northwestern University, Tufts University in Massachusetts and the University
of Toronto. They say they, too, may want to do the same thing someday, that
they're so turned off by the corporate scene they don't want to get into it,
at least not right now.;   "There has to be more to life than just making a
lot of money," says Dan Ettinger, a Tufts University graduate who eventually
wants to be a lawyer. "And these days, even the jobs that are real jobs don't
pay well, so you might as well do something you like.";   "A lot of people who
are 35 or 40 are realizing that their first career choice was off target,"
says Liam Davis, who recently graduated from Kenyon College in Ohio with a
degree in music. "I don't want to make that same mistake.";   "I was exhausted
when I went home," says Jessica O'Malley, who gave up an office manager's job
and took a 20 percent pay cut to help bake bread. "I wanted to get away from
all of the office politics. Here I feel like I'm accomplishing something.";  
The U.S. Small Business Administration reports that more than 1 million
Americans started businesses last year. Estimates range all over the board on
how many will succeed, but that seems scant deterrent.;   John Ward, a
professor at Loyola University's business school and an expert on family
business and entrepreneurship, suggests, in fact that once the entrepreneurial
spirit bites, people "keep scrapping until they figure out what works.";  
Kolp knows the feeling. Every morning, he says, he sees the corporate types
trudging by his store on their way to catch the commuter train. "You don't see
too many smiles," he says. "That's the way I used to be.";   He turned his
back on a lucrative consulting job in Denver. He put away his power ties and
suits, said goodbye to a girlfriend and emptied his bank account to start his
new life.;   But that's not to say his evolution from engineering consultant
to baker has been easy. "I stopped counting the number of times I've been in
tears," he admits.;   Kolp planned his escape for two years, trying to find
just the right opportunity. He stumbled on it in Boulder, Colo., when he tried
the bread at a Great Harvest bakery there -- a franchise company started and
run by a couple from Connecticut, Laura and Pete Wakeman. They had left the
fast lane by moving to Montana in the '70s and opening a bakery there.;   The
company gets hundreds of inquiries a month and more than 300 completed
applications a year from people who seriously want to start bakeries -- and
have put together the needed money, close to $100,000 -- according to company
spokeswoman Jeanie Berna. Just 8 to 10 a year are accepted.;   There are 44
Great Harvest bakeries in the United States; Kolp's is the first in Illinois.;
  Once he got the go-ahead, he traveled the country for months, sometimes
sleeping in his car, looking for a spot to open his bakery. He scrounged used
supplies, including a 30-year-old oven he bought from a Wisconsin prison. He
went door to door asking people if they would buy freshly baked wheat bread.
He sat in his car at various spots and counted the number of people who went
by.;   Kolp renovated a former pharmacy, mostly by himself because he had no
cash to pay for labor. And since the bakery opened Oct. 16, he has worked
every day from dawn until well into the evening, though the bakery is open
five days a week. "I have yet to take a day off," he says.;   He has no money
in the bank and no time for a social life. He's existing on frozen lasagna and
Pepsi and, of course, his bread, but he says he couldn't be happier.;   He has
sold out most days: more than 500 loaves of Oregon herb, honey wheat and
raisin walnut bread, among others. He needs to sell 300 to make ends meet. He
sends leftovers to a local shelter for battered women.;   The bread, Kolp
claims, is healthier and cheaper by the pound than a standard supermarket
loaf. His are $2.75 to $4 per 2-pound loaf and will stay fresh for a week, he
claims. "Affordable quality," Kolp says, between a steady stream of customers
one recent morning.;   The shop offers free samples, with honey and butter.
Rock music plays as the bright-faced crew kneads the bread. Everybody is
dressed casually in jeans and T-shirts.;   "I work 12 hours a day, and I don't
want to leave," says Anna Christman, a 23-year-old with a degree in art from
Northwestern.  </TEXT>
