   Sunlite Inc. said it agreed in principle to settle litigation between it and Crutcher-Tufts Corp., a New Orleans energy company. 

   Separately, Sunlite said it will purchase as many as 300,000 of its 2.7 million common shares outstanding. 

   Under the legal agreement, Sunlite, an Atlanta energy and real estate concern, will pay Crutcher-Tufts $615,000 and give up approximately $350,000 in payments from a Louisiana oil and gas field the two have an interest in. 
Both companies will drop suits against each other, and Crutcher-Tufts principals will receive an option that allows them to require Sunlite to buy their 54,050 shares in Sunlite at $6.50 a share. 

   The dispute between the two companies stemmed from Crutcher-Tufts's claim that it had overpaid Sunlite its share of income from the energy field. 

   Sunlite said the settlement will cause it to incur an expense of about $100,000 in its second fiscal quarter, ending Dec. 31. 
That's in addition to $926,000 recorded through Sept. 30 as a provision for contingent loss. 

   Sunlite shares closed Friday at $3.375, unchanged, in national over-the-counter trading.
