<LEADPARA>  CHERYL MORLEY and William J. Evans are aiming to have grandparents across
America lifting weights and walking treadmills at health clubs for people age
50 or older.;   "People are concerned about their bodies giving way before
they're ready for that," said Morley, director of business development for an
artificial sweetener company. "They've been healthy and they want to maintain
health."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Consumer research indicates that active people over 50 think of themselves
as younger than their chronological age, said John McCarthy, executive
director of IRSA, a national association of health clubs.;   "In a behavioral
sense -- what movies they go to, books they read -- they literally are 10 to
15 years younger than their actual age," he said.;   WellBridge Centers will
try to keep people from becoming frail as they age, said Evans, a Tufts
University researcher. "Much of what we call aging is really nothing but the
lifetime accumulation of inactivity and poor nutrition.";   The first
WellBridge Center is to open in mid-1992 in Newton, Mass., which is near the
Tufts researchers and has many older people who could want to join, Morley
said.;   Exercise programs will be individually tailored, and based on studies
demonstrating that even people in their 90s can gain strength, he said.;  
Beginners will get a physiological evaluation including stress testing to help
exercise physiologists specializing in their age group determine a program,
under a physician's guidance, Evans said.;   They also will get a diet
evaluation, but, company officials say the center will not at first offer
foods carrying the artificial sweetener NutraSweet label.;   The exercise
program will emphasize flexibility and range of motion, Evans said. Stretching
is vital to increasing range of motion and avoiding injuries, he said. Over
the years, muscles become stiffer, and ligaments and tendons less flexible.;  
Exercise equipment will be tailored to the 50-plus age group. For instance,
exercisers will be able to fine-tune the amount of weight they lift, instead
of using standard plates found in many machines, he said. Aerobics floors and
treadmills will have more padding, and there will be a swimming pool for
impact-free calisthenics, he said.;   The WellBridge Centers will be havens
for people who don't feel comfortable in clubs where most exercisers are
young, Morley said.  </TEXT>
