   Soaring medical malpractice claims have contributed to an image of physicians as a tightly knit club with little self-policing. 
But a recent study says doctors are effectively culling many of the bad apples from their midst. 

   The culling is being done by physician-owned insurance companies, which insure more than 40% of U.S. doctors for malpractice. 
Physicians who review insurance matters for such companies have strong financial incentives to prevent negligence-prone colleagues from spawning patient lawsuits. 
They take far more disciplinary actions against negligent doctors than state medical boards, according to the study, which appears in today's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. 

   Physician-owned insurance companies have proliferated since the mid-1970s as traditional malpractice insurers -- faced with skyrocketing, unpredictable awards -- abandoned the business. 
Doctor-owned companies insure about 179,000 U.S. doctors, or more than 60% of those who aren't covered by institutions they work for, such as state mental hospitals, said a spokesman for the Physician Insurers Association of America, a trade group. 

   In 1985, such companies took disciplinary actions against 3.2% of their insured physicians, including termination of coverage for 0.66% of them, according to the medical journal's study. 
Moreover, the sanctions often were imposed with remarkable speed after a doctor showed signs of negligence, said William Schwartz, co-author of the study and a medical economist at Tufts University in Boston. 
Sometimes a single patient claim against a doctor triggered an investigation. 

   In contrast, traditional insurers identify negligence-prone doctors only after data on multiple claims against them have accumulated, a process that can take five years or more, Dr. Schwartz said. 
Also, the doctors on hospital performance review boards often are reluctant to discipline colleagues they work with. 
And state medical boards generally don't have enough resources to effectively weed out bad doctors, Dr. Schwartz said. 

   Still, the state boards are doing a better job, partly because of a four-year-old data bank on problem doctors maintained by the Federation of State Medical Boards, based in Fort Worth, Texas. 
In 1987, the boards reported taking sanctions against 2,663 doctors nationwide, up 72% from 1984, said Bryant Galusha, the group's executive vice president. 

   In a related study in the same issue on doctors who lost their malpractice insurance, the Tufts researchers found there were 24% more physicians in the 45-to-54 age group who lost coverage than expected based on the proportion of doctors they represent. 
Many underwriters speculate that such doctors face "financial responsibilities that drive them to take on grossly excessive work loads, particularly surgical procedures, for which they are not adequately trained," the study said. 
The finding could also stem from the gradual accrual of evidence on negligent doctors that reaches a critical mass only after they have practiced a decade or more, Dr. Schwartz said. 

   The researchers also found that foreign-trained doctors aren't overrepresented among those who lost coverage and that neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons and some other specialists tend to lose coverage more often than expected, even when the high rate of claims in their fields is taken into account.
