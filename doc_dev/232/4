<HEAD>Tufts University Abolishes Speech-Limiting Policy</HEAD>

   The president of Tufts University
rescinded a ban on verbal attacks after legal experts suggested the
ban, prompted by an offensive T-shirt, violated students' First
Amendment rights to free speech.
   ``I have decided we are better off erring in the tradition of
free speech,'' Jean Mayer said Thursday in an interview. ``We
decided we would decide each case on its merits.''
   Students had rallied around the right to free speech and
objected to the policy published in the student handbook, which
barred verbal attacks, whether spoken or written, against an
individual's race, ethnic group, religion or sexual orientation.
   But Billy Jacobson, the student body president, said he was
sorry to see the university drop a policy supported by many of its
7,000 students.
   ``The university has a responsibility to protect students,'' he
said. ``It can't insulate students, but this is their home and
students shouldn't have to worry about going into their dorms and
their dining halls and seeing something offensive to them.''
   The policy was prompted by an outcry last spring when an
enterprising student marketed a T-shirt stating 15 reasons ``Why
Beer is Better than Women at Tufts.'' All 15 reasons disparaged
women. One of the more printable ones was ``Hangovers go away.''
   The T-shirt dealer was placed on probation and ordered to do 50
hours of community service. But Mayer recommended the Committee on
Student Life reconsider that sentence, which it eventually
suspended when lawyers advised it was unconstitutional.
   The student life committee, comprising faculty and students,
imposed the free speech restriction last June on the campus abut
six miles outside Boston. Protests began after the policy made its
way into this year's student handbook.
   Some experts say the First Amendment only bars the government
from restricting speech and doesn't apply to private universities,
Mayer said. But others say it upholds free speech anywhere, short
of sparking a riot, he said.
   However, a court ruling found a similar policy at the University
of Michigan at Ann Arbor was unconstitutional and vague, Mayer said.
