<LEADPARA>  WHEN Margot O'Toole, a junior researcher in molecular biology, raised
uncomfortable questions in 1986 about the validity of a senior colleague's
work, she felt alone.;    David A. Baltimore, a Nobel laureate who was a
co-author of a research paper that used the disputed work, described her as a
"disgruntled postdoctoral fellow."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     She lost her job and her house, and feared that her husband's job was in
jeopardy as well. She took work answering phones at her brother's moving
company.;    "It was very difficult," she said Thursday. "There were times
when I was really frantic.";    But Wednesday, the National Institutes of
Health called her a hero.;    "Dr. O'Toole suffered substantially for the
simple act of raising questions about a scientific paper," the agency said in
a report on the case.;    In a draft report, the health institutes' Office of
Scientific Integrity said in effect that O'Toole had been right all along:
Crucial data in the paper based on work by her superior, Thereza
Imanishi-Kari, had been faked.;    The scientific paper described findings
suggesting that transplanted genes could stimulate a recipient's immune
system. The finding has not been confirmed by other researchers.;    Adviser
signed off;  Baltimore, now president of Rockefeller University in New York,
was a senior adviser on the paper who reviewed the research and the data for
the paper, and his signature on the paper signaled his acceptance of its
claims.;    He said Wednesday that he would ask that the paper be retracted,
and the journal Cell, which published it, agreed Thursday to do so.;    The
chairman at Rockefeller University, Richard Furlaud, issued a statement
reaffirming the university's total confidence in Baltimore.;    "One of the
most surprising things to me is the way so many members of the scientific
community and the scientific press were ready to denigrate Dr. O'Toole," said
Mark Ptashne, a researcher at Harvard University who is an officer of Genetics
Institute, where O'Toole was hired last year to do work in the immunology of
breast cancer, after years of being unable to obtain work in science.;   
"They were willing to go to battle with absolute certainty, without bothering
to read the paper and think about the likelihood that the paper was wrong,"
Ptashne said.;    The Cell paper was not the first time O'Toole had taken on
powerful opponents, her mother, Elizabeth Ryan, said Thursday.;    Earlier
incident;  In 1985, said Ryan, her daughter "was rushing back from lunch" when
she saw a slight man being beaten by a robust assailant. "She came trotting up
sideways to the large man, and said, 'Well, what do you think you are doing?';
   "The man said: 'Go away, go away. I'm a detective making an arrest.' She
said, 'Well, show me your badge.' Another man . . . showed her something but
it wasn't a badge, so she just didn't accept it.";    She collected the names
of people standing nearby and took the matter to the authorities. The matter
eventually went to court, and the large man, who was a police officer, was
suspended for a year.;    O'Toole was a postdoctoral fellow at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1985 and 1986 under Imanishi-Kari,
who was charged in the NIH report with scientific misconduct.;    O'Toole
informally reported to her senior adviser, Henry Wortis at Tufts University,
that she had found 17 pages of data that clearly showed that information in a
scientific paper published in Cell that year was false.;    Wortis and two
other researchers looked into the matter informally but found no misconduct,
he said. MIT later began its own investigation of the allegations.;    After
she reported the matter, O'Toole said she was told by Imanishi-Kari never to
come back to the laboratory.;    Baltimore defended Imanishi-Kari at the time,
he said Wednesday, because he believed in the principle that Congress and
others outside science should not insert themselves in scientific disputes.;  
 In the process, he did not hide his dislike of O'Toole's actions and
described her in one letter as a "disgruntled postdoctoral fellow.";    Toole
recalled hearing painful rumors, everything from reports of incompetence to
suggestions that, as a nursing mother, she was not acting rationally.;    The
heat continued for five years, involving inquiries at universities, by the NIH
and in Congress.;    The dispute prompted a fear that her husband, Peter
Brodeur, would be dismissed from his job in Imanishi-Kari's laboratory, but he
continues to work there.;    O'Toole found solace in the support of two-time
Nobel-prize winner Linus Pauling, as well as that of Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., and his staff, who continued the investigation of the matter. They
were later joined by Ptashne.;    They were among the few who spoke out in her
behalf as O'Toole's allegations were heard and reheard in investigations and
hearings.;    Most scientists rallied around Baltimore and Imanishi-Kari, and
were critical of O'Toole.;    Dr. Walter Gilbert, a Nobel laureate at Harvard
University, raised the question of the responsibility of scientists in charge
at the institutions involved.;    Authorities 'failed';  "The whistle-blower
herself did not want to call this fraud in the beginning, but she reported it
to people who should have known better. The people in authority, and in my
opinion that means at MIT and Tufts, failed to investigate properly," he
said.;    "That is the greatest failure, of the institutions," he said. "There
is a canon of the establishment which says that when someone objects, that
person must be a malcontent and be badly motivated and that science is holier
than anyone or anything. This is the issue: what happens when a scientists is
called upon to be unsure of his or her work."  </TEXT>
