   The $100,000 sheepskin is just around the corner. 

   Colleges and universities have raised average tuitions for the coming school year by 7%, the College Board said Friday. 
That makes this the eighth straight year of increases higher than the inflation rate and may step up criticism of higher education for failing to keep its costs under control. 

   Private-school tuitions rose 9% to an average of $7,963, the New York-based college admissions organization said; tuitions at public colleges rose 5%, bringing their average to $1,485. 
Consumer-price inflation for the year through June was 4%. 

   After the latest increases, a year at the most expensive schools now costs just under $19,000, including room and board. 
If tuition inflation continues at present rates, freshmen in the fall of 1989 will pay about $100,000 for a four-year degree from a top school, including incidental costs such as supplies and transportation. 

   Colleges have blamed the rising prices on a need to spend more on financial aid to make up for federal cutbacks and on rising labor costs, especially for faculty. 
But their critics remain unconvinced. 

   "There is no reason, with inflation of 4%, that colleges should be raising their prices by 9%," said Rep. William Goodling, a Republican from Pennsylvania who has unsuccessfully urged a limit on financial aid to high-priced schools. 
"Their concern has been the bottom line, rather than providing quality, affordable education." 

   Colleges point out that tuition provides only about a third of their budgets, with the rest coming from government aid and private contributions. 
"The notion that we're somehow squirreling it away is absurd," says Richard Rosser, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. 
"Every college I know of is struggling to raise prices as little as they can and still provide a quality education." 

   Ernst Benjamin, the executive secretary of the American Association of University Professors, said that while scholarship and faculty expenses have been rising for schools, administrative costs have risen faster. 
He also cited spending on noneducational services such as counseling and recruiting. 
The average university professor's salary rose 4.9% last year, the AAUP says. 

   The 10 private schools with the highest tuition, room and board charges are Bennington College in Vermont, $18,990; Sarah Lawrence College (N.Y.), $18,760; Brandeis University (Mass.), $18,586; Barnard College (N.Y.), $18,550; Tufts University (Mass.), $18,282; University of Chicago, $18,225; Harvard/Radcliffe colleges (Mass.), $18,210; Dartmouth College (N.H.), $18,199; Boston University, $18,175; New York University, $18,100. 

   The most expensive public colleges are Jersey City State College (N.J.), $7,464; University of Michigan, $6,875; Virginia Military Institute, $6,540; University of Illinois at Chicago, $6,455; College of William and Mary (Va.), $6,370; Virginia State University, $6,356; Lyndon State College (Vt.), $6,291; Johnson State College (Vt.), $6,286; Old Dominion University (Va.), $6,272; and Trenton State College (N.J.), $6,245.
