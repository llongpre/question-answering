   The state that's home to the Grand Canyon
and the Petrified Forest will soon acquire another natural wonder _
a spectacular 2{-mile cavern kept secret for years for fear it
would be vandalized.
   The Legislature and Gov. Rose Mofford on Wednesday rushed to
enact legislation allowing the state to acquire the cavern
discovered 14 years ago near Benson in southeast Arizona.
   Mrs. Mofford perched a spelunker's helmet atop her beehive
hairdo as she signed the bill passed by lawmakers only an hour
earlier.
   The cave's existence had been a closely held secret since it was
discovered in 1974, because its owners feared vandals would destroy
its beauty.
   ``It is a major natural resource find,'' said state Park Board
Director Kenneth Travous, who has twice squeezed through the tiny
opening to view the cavern.
   ``It's fabulous,'' Travous said. ``Walt Disney couldn't have
done any better for the state of Arizona. Your imagination goes
crazy when you get down there.''
   The cavern is about 13,000 feet long with rooms the size of
football fields and ceilings from 50 to 100 feet high. Thousands of
still-growing stalagmites and stalactites ranging from a few inches
to 60 feet are found throughout. It's also home to a colony of 700
bats.
   In about three years, Travous says, about 100,000 to 150,000
people a year will get to travel by elevator to see the cave.
Officials plan to use state park revenues to acquire the site for
$1.6 million within a year from the Arizona Nature Conservancy,
which soon will buy the site from the family of the late James
Kartchner, a Cochise County rancher and educator.
   ``I imagine I walked over this thing I don't know how many times
hunting deer'' but never realized the cavern was underneath, said
Rep. Gus Arzberger, whose district includes the cave.
   The state on Friday sent park rangers to guard the site on an
emergency basis as word of the cavern's existence began to leak
out. The bill was quickly enacted Wednesday to allow the state to
continue to oversee the land.
   The cavern's co-discoverer, Randy Tufts, 39, said that finding
it along with Gary Tenen, 37, was ``a once in a lifetime discovery
for the caver.''
   ``People go out and hunt and hunt and hunt for caves; 99 times
out of 100 you never find anything,'' Tufts said.
   Tufts said he and Tenen wanted the cavern turned into a park
because that would be the best way to protect it from vandals.
Because it is near a major highway, Tufts said it was inevitable
that other people would find it.
   Tufts said he had been into the cavern hundreds of times.
   ``It's very colorful ... The variety of formations is very
wide,'' and it still is an actively changing cave, Tufts said.
   Four of Kartchner's 12 children attended Wednesday's legislative
session and bill-signing. Dean Kartchner, a physician, said family
members were aware of the cave but not its splendor.
   ``We climbed in it, there were rattlesnakes, and we climbed back
out (with) no idea of the magnificence of the structure,''
Kartchner said.
