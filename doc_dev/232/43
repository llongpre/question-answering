   Pat Phillipps is staying in downtown Boston for a
few months, in a room with a view of the theatre district. At her
disposal are a swimming pool, library and exercise room, and she
gets three meals a day.
   Rather than pay room and board, Phillipps will get about $2,100.
But then, most tourists aren't called back if they don't clean their
plate.
   Phillipps, 68, and about 11 other people are housed not at the
Sheraton or the Meridien, but a Tufts University laboratory.
``You've got a private room, private bath, and you don't have to
make up your bed if you don't want to,'' she said. ``Of course, I
make up mine.''
   Tufts' Nutrition Research Center on Aging, funded by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, runs experiments and studies with
volunteers, mainly older people. For $50 to $3,000, depending on the
study, subjects are fed and monitored.
   The center, in an effort to slow the aging process through diet
and nutrition, studies ways to impede the decay of the human body by
osteoporosis, arteriosclerosis, cataracts, and overall loss of
physical capacity.
   ``There are life-threatening situations as people age,
debilitating situations,'' said Judy Frazier, metabolic research
unit manager and director of nursing. ``There really has to be a
better way.''
   The studies can last from two months to five years, including
follow-up experiments. The center, since its inception in 1983, has
completed 76 studies, is working on 18, and has seven ready to go.
   The main focus, naturally, is on diet, and meals are monitored
rigorously. Portions are carefully weighed and measured so the staff
knows exactly how much protein, cholestrol, body fat and other
elements the subjects are eating.
   ``We look at food as chemicals,'' said research dietician Nadine
Sahyoun. ``We are really a lab, not a kitchen.''
   Some studies require two identical meals, one that ends up poured
into a blender to be mixed together and inspected for overall
content.
   If a subject doesn't eat everything the study calls for, even a
dab of gravy left on the plate, the ``rinse and scrape'' method is
implemented. The plate is squirted with a bit of water, and the
volunteer scrapes the plate with a spatula to ensure that every last
bit of food is consumed. If a volunteer is found to have dropped a
pound or two, his or her meals are enlarged.
   Most of the participants, aside from the money, like to
contribute to the center's research and come from all over the
country.
   ``It's a great organization, great people,'' said Richard Harris,
a retiree from El Paso, Texas. ``That makes it more pleasant than
anything.''
   Harris, who participated in a vitamin B-6 study last fall and was
this year for a follow-up, said he would receive $3,000.
   The center offers guided boat tours, museum outings and other
diversions, and the nearby theaters provide entertainment.
Chaperones used to keep the volunteers from sneaking over to
Chinatown for a plate of sweet and sour pork, but most subjects
welcome the chance to find out if they've been eating right.
   Of course, there are other reasons. Phillipps, whose Walpole home
doesn't have air conditioning, likes to take part in summer
experiments so she can get some knitting done without her hands
getting sweaty.
