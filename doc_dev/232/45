   A city councilor has proposed that college
students, who comprise 20 percent of Boston's population but don't
pay taxes, pay a $5 monthly levy to support the financially
crunched public library.
   Making students pay for city services is an old idea gaining new
luster because of the specter of slashed budgets.
   ``Sixty dollars a year isn't going to make them broke when
they're spending up to $20,000 a year to go to some of these fancy
schools we have in Boston,'' said Councilor Christopher A.
Iannella. ``We have great research facilities and those students
don't pay a cent.''
   All proceeds would go to the Boston Public Library, which is
planning to lay off up to 120 employees and close its 25 branch
libraries four days a week when the city slashes its budget by more
than $1 million next year.
   Boston is host to 32 colleges and universities with an estimated
120,000 students. But half of its real estate is tax-exempt because
it belongs to universities, hospitals or other non-profit
institutions.
   ``Colleges and universities do not pay any tax or gratuity, yet
we supply them with public works, safe streets, police and fire
protection,'' Iannella said in placing the library tax proposal
before the council Wednesday for the second time in seven years.
   His plan would tax full-time college students no more than $60 a
year and part-timers no more than $20 annually.
   Spokesmen for the U.S. Department of Education and the National
Association of Independent Colleges and Universities said they
hadn't heard of attempts elsewhere to tax college students for
local services.
   The tax would not apply to some of the area's best-known
schools: Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, which are in Cambridge, and Tufts University in Medford.
   The president of the library's board of trustees, Kevin F.
Moloney, said the library needs money but won't take a position on
whether taxing students is the best way to raise it.
   ``We're getting slammed from far too many directions,'' said
Stephen Mazzulli, an editor at the student newspaper on the
University of Massachusetts's Boston campus. ``They're upping our
tuition, they're tacking on fees. They added $100 just because they
screwed up the (state) budget, and now they want more.''
   Mazzulli said the average age of a student at his school is 28,
and 80 percent work more than 30 hours a week.
   Northeastern University student Joel Kurth said he uses the
Boston Public Library regularly and wouldn't mind paying for it.
   Iannella first proposed the library tax in 1982 when Boston, on
the verge of bankruptcy, began laying off police and teachers and
closing libraries. The city council passed the tax, but the
Legislature refused to approve it.
