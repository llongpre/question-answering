   Voracious Vine Poses
   Threat to Young Trees

   MILE-A-MINUTE weed is a new threat to young trees in the
middle Atlantic states and possibly nationwide.
   The weed, a vine with triangular leaves and an iridescent
blue berry, is a kind of horizontal version of Jack's
beanstalk. It can grow as rapidly as six inches a day and can
grow from seed to 25 feet in a single season. It overruns and
smothers other vegetation and thus poses a threat to
orchards, Christmas tree farms, shrub nurseries and
reforestation efforts. It also can overrun the sides of
highways.
   The weed was first seen by weed scientist Nathan L.
Hartwig of Pennsylvania State University in 1972, when a
specimen was brought to him from a shrub nursery south of
Harrisburg, Pa. He believes the weed came originally from
Japan, possibly aboard some rhododendrons imported by a
Pennsylvania nurseryman around 1930.
   In a survey two years ago, Prof. Hartwig found that
mile-a-minute weed had spread to 12 Pennsylvania counties, 13
Maryland counties and two sites in West Virginia. He believes
the pesty vine, spread by birds and rodents who eat the berry
and by people moving yard plants to new homes, has reached
Virginia, Delaware and Washington.
   Until now, the weed hasn't raised alarms because it
doesn't menace food and fiber crops where tilling and
herbicides keep it at bay. But no-tillage crop practices and
cutbacks on herbicide use could encourage its spread, the
scientist suggests. "It's a definite possibility that this
weed could spread from coast to coast," he says.
   The weed scientist is searching for a herbicide that would
wipe out the weed. Unfortunately, the most effective weed
killer he's found, Roundup, is nonselective and kills the
trees that the vine grows on.
   Mr. Hartwig asks that anyone spotting mile-a-minute weed
call 1-800-247-3662.
                                                                                                       

   Graphite May Drive
   Pistons of Future
                                                                                                       

   AUTO-ENGINE pistons someday may be made of carbon instead
of aluminum alloys.
   Engineers at Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart, Germany, recently
made pistons of fiber-reinforced graphite and installed them
in the engine of a Mercedes-Benz 190E. During 15,000 miles of
city and highway driving, hydrocarbon emissions were 20%
lower than with aluminum-alloy pistons, and carbon-monoxide
emissions were down by 30%. Gasoline consumption improved 3%.
   "The largest improvement, however, was observed in oil
consumption," research engineer Jurgen L. Heuer reported to
the August meeting of the American Chemical Society. "The
carbon piston engine consumed only 44% of the lubricating oil
that a standard engine needs," he said.
   Carbon pistons suffer less friction than metal ones and
are lighter, cutting piston weight by 20%, he explained. They
also stand up to high temperatures better and are quieter.
   Unfortunately, carbon pistons also are more brittle than
aluminum pistons, and current manufacturing methods make them
far too expensive for use in today's engines. Mr. Heuer,
however, suggested there might be cheaper ways to make the
pistons.
                                                                                                       

   New Form of Yogurt
   Helps Stop Diarrhea
                                                                                                       

   TWO TUFTS University medical school scientists and a
Finnish dairy have developed a form of yogurt that helps stop
diarrhea.
   Several years ago, Sherwood Gorbach and his colleague,
Barry Goldin, of the community health department at Tufts in
Boston, began searching for a naturally occurring bacterium
to make a yogurt that would live up to the sometimes
exaggerated health claims of yogurt lovers. Five years ago,
they isolated such a bug from the gut of a fellow professor
and dubbed it lactobacillus GG, for Gorbach and Goldin.
   The bacillus not only ferments milk into yogurt but has
the ability to thrive in the intestine for several days and
prevent the growth of other bacteria. The Americans tied up
with the big Finnish dairy cooperative, Valio, to test the
new yogurt's effect on diarrhea. They recently reported that
among Finnish infants hospitalized for diarrhea, the problem
cleared up in about two days in infants fed the new yogurt,
compared with three days for other infants.
   The "yogurt-like" product made with lactobacillus GG
technically can't be called yogurt, because by international
agreement, yogurt can be made only by a combination of two
other bacilli. Valio sells a low-fat version of the product
in Finland under the name Gefilus.
   Several U.S. dairies expressed interest in the Tufts bug
after it was described at a recent meeting of the Institute
of Food Technologists, Dr. Gorbach says. Data to back up the
claim that the product is effective are being submitted to
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, he adds.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   DEVELOPING a pure white chrysanthemum for florist shops is
the goal of Florigene, a venture of DNA Plant Technology, a
Cinnaminson, N.J., biotech company. . . . Panty hose has
practically eliminated what was once the major cause of
nickel-allergy skin rashes, the buckles in garter belts,
German doctors report in the Journal of the American Academy
of Dermatology. But rashes caused by coins in which nickel
has replaced silver are increasing. . . . Federal
agricultural scientists in Peoria, Ill., have found a process
for converting surplus sugar into a substitute for the $25
million worth of gum arabic that food processors and others
import each year from the Sudan and elsewhere.
