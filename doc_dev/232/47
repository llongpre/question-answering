   William J. Bennett knew he was going to be
giving up the big bucks when he returned from private life to public
office, and new financial disclosure forms indicate he got what he
expected.
   During the first 2{ months before he became director of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy March 10, Bennett earned
$80,246 from speeches and consulting work plus $25,962 in salary as
president of The Madison Center, a private policy research group he
created.
   If the $106,208 income from the early months had held up
throughout 1989, he could have earned about $550,000, not including
interest on savings.
   Instead, the government started paying him after March 10 at the
rate of $99,500 for a full year, or about $80,000 for the rest of
1989.
   Adding that salary to the earnings of the first couple of months
plus his declared interest earnings gave Bennett an approximate
income of $191,209 to $201,208 for 1989.
   His interest earnings totaled between $5,001 and $15,000.
   ``I was told it would have been a very good year for me,''
Bennett said shortly before taking office, reflecting on his
expected nose dive in take-home pay.
   Some other White House aides have managed to remain wealthy in
public service, while others, such as Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater, have not.
   Bennett, known as one of the poorest members of President
Reagan's Cabinet when he was education secretary, ``turned down $1.5
million in lectures in 1989,'' when President Bush nominated him to
the drug policy job, a lecture-circuit industry source said at the
time.
   The financial disclosure forms indicate Bennett's cash assets
suffered somewhat as a result of his new employment.
   In 1988, Bennett's assets ranged from $301,003 to $356,002 and
up, according to the forms, which only require broad ranges to be
reported and do not require listing such personal items as homes or
cars.
   Bennett told the Senate Judiciary Committee in early 1989 that
his net worth was about $432,600.
   For 1989, Bennett's assets ranged from $150,002 to $350,000.
   When Bennett resigned as Reagan's education secretary on Sept.
20, 1988, he reported having a savings account worth less than
$1,001. The former philosophy professor had been chairman of the
National Endowment for the Humanities for four years before becoming
education secretary in 1985.
   While Bennett was out of office in late 1988, he signed a
contract with Simon &amp; Shuster publishers in New York to write two
books, neither of which has yet been published, and he received
advances of $187,500.
   Bennett's form also said he resigned from positions as consultant
or member of the board of several foundations or public policy
research groups.
   Sig Rogich, who orchestrates President Bush's public appearances,
remains a multimillionaire from his advertising business and
holdings in radio, real estate and other ventures, according to
financial disclosure reports released Monday by White House general
counsel Boyden Gray.
   Rogich reported assets of at least $3.9 million to $5.5 million
or more, and net income on his holdings in the range of $180,549 to
$238,544 or more. His interests included an advertising firm, radio
stations, mobile billboards and a bar in Truckee, Calif.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press
secretary, listed assets ranging from $17,005 to $55,000 and outside
income of $2,722 to $4,520.
   Rogich, in a telephone interview from California where he was
traveling with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said he had
put his holdings in a blind trust and ordered his trustee to sell
his stocks.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu is still on leave from
Tufts University as an engineering professor, but he reported he
will not accept tuition breaks or other faculty benefits for his
children while he works in Washington.
   Sununu, a former governor of New Hampshire, reported assets
ranging from $422,008 to more than $1 million, and income apart from
his White House salary ranging from $15,506 to $55,000. He also drew
$9,151 from New Hampshire for his final weeks as governor.
   Robert Gates, the deputy national security adviser to the
president and former career CIA man, reported assets ranging from
$33,005 to $115,000 and outside income of $2,305 to $8,000.
