   Re Vermont Royster's Sept. 22 editorial-page article "The 20th Century's Forgotten War": Let me assure him that World War I is more than ever very much in the conscience and the curriculum of our colleges. 
Beginning in 1975 with Paul Fussell's "The Great War and Modern Memory," scholars have been producing a stream of very readable general education studies. 
Barbara Tuchman's "Guns of August" (1962) did not stimulate the guild of academic historians, but the literary historians such as Mr. Fussell and the new scholars in technology saw World War I as a watershed of political engagement by intellectuals as well as the start of really terrifying technological innovations, such as poison gas, tanks, airplanes and, above all, the machine gun. 

   This was a war that began with saber charges and red-white-and-blue uniforms. 
It ended with four-foot rats and the near total destruction of a generation. 
None of this has been lost on the faculties of American universities. 
To understand today's world, we examine the impact of Darwinism, chauvinism and the nationalism of an Olympic movement that started in 1896 amid hopes of international brotherhood, and soon degenerated into the worst kind of sports warfare. 

   Whether Santayana actually said it or not makes little difference to an academic community in several disciplines that is dedicated to the absolute necessity of learning from past mistakes. 
Let's only hope someone is listening.
