   Boston University seniors are getting a final
lesson in supply and demand. Tickets to this weekend's commencement
featuring President Bush and French President Francois Mitterrand
are being scalped for as much as $100.
   About 30,000 people _ 10,000 more than usual _ are expected at
the ceremony, for which each of the 5,600 seniors was allotted four
tickets.
   ``We haven't had to use a system like this in the past because
we've been able to accommodate everyone, but the students' response
this year has been overwhelming,'' BU Executive Vice President Jon
Westling said Tuesday.
   Most students say their parents wouldn't dream of missing
graduation or the chance to watch two world leaders collect
honorary degrees. And for those with small families or eager to
make a buck, the opportunity to wheel and deal is attractive.
   ``It's a very difficult thing to stop, but it's not something we
encourage or condone,'' Westling said of the scalping.
   University President John Silber helped persuade Bush and
Mitterrand to come to the school's urban campus.
   Silber knows Bush from his days at the University of Texas in
the 1960s, university spokesman Thomas Cashman said. He also has
become acquainted with Mitterrand recently through Nobel laureate
Elie Wiesel, a BU professor and friend of the French president,
Cashman said.
   The coup has allowed BU to dominate the keen annual competition
among Massachusetts' 120 colleges for commencement speakers.
Harvard University and Tufts University had to settle for just one
world leader each: Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, respectively.
   Nevertheless, senior Cindy Carron said she regarded the
presidents' visits a mixed blessing because it limits the number of
tickets available and requires extensive security checks.
   ``I'd almost rather have my whole family there to share in the
ceremony instead of the president, who's untouchable,'' she said.

   A councilman urged the city to construct
a UFO landing pad to welcome extraterrestials. His colleagues
quickly brought him down to Earth.
   George Darden has a reputation for filing unusual bills,
including one last year that would have outlawed sex in Metro
Courthouse.
   On Tuesday night, Darden asked his colleagues to show a little
earthly hospitality to visitors from outer space.
   ``Many people have come to me expressing the fact that they are
seeing these unidentified flying objects,'' he told the council's
rules committee.
   The committee unanimously defeated the resolution. The council
later defeated it 27-1, with Darden the only supporter.
   ``You might live to regret this day,'' he told the council,
chiding members for not taking his proposal seriously.
   Councilman Tom Sharp suggested amending the bill to allow the
landing pad be constructed only in Darden's district.
   Councilman Charles French proposed giving UFOs access to the
airport.
   And Mayor Bill Boner said earlier that if the resolution passed,
he would see if aliens would support a contract on a leaseback
basis, although the currency exchange would be a dilemma.
   Darden told reporters later he would build the landing pad
himself.
