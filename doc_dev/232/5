   John Sununu remains on the faculty of Tufts
University six years after he last taught there, an arrangement that
has allowed his children to receive tuition waivers and aid from the
school.
   The New Hampshire governor, who is President-elect George Bush's
choice as White House chief of staff, has had two children enrolled
in Tufts since he left the university and also has children
attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge,
Mass., and Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif.
   The children attending Tufts are granted full tuition waivers and
those at other colleges receive tuition subsidies from Tufts as part
of faculty benefits Sununu has received during his six years on
leave from the school, according to Tufts officials. Tuition at
Tufts in the 1987-88 school year was $11,750.
   An official who oversees faculty benefits at Tufts described
Sununu's arrangement as ``extremely rare,'' and said general school
policy is to grant leaves for up to two years.
