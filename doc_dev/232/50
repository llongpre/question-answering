   Michael Dukakis today proposed a plan
aimed at restoring U.S. dominance in science and technology to
allow development of new American products that would compete
successfully in foreign markets.
   ``We've got to win the battle to be No. 1 in the technologies of
the future,'' the Democratic nominee told students at Tufts
University. ``We've got to build new industries. We've got to
modernize our old ones so we can make top-of-the-line products and
earn top-of-the-line paychecks.''
   Dukakis expanded on his theme of economic nationalism at Tufts
after he went on nationwide television to accuse Republican rival
George Bush of ``very crass and cynical'' tactics in making a
campaign issue of the Massachusetts prison furlough system.
   Dukakis spoke a few hours before flying to Los Angeles for his
second and final debate with the vice president on Thursday, which
he said would give millions of American voters ``a good sense of
who I am and the kind of leadership I can provide.''
   The Massachusetts governor said that only improvements in
science education and technology development would lead to
restoration of U.S. dominance in manufacturing and marketing of
high-tech consumer goods.
   ``I want us to begin selling cars and computers and compact
discs to the Germans and the Japanese and the Koreans, not arms to
the Ayatollah,'' he said.
   Dukakis delighted the friendly crowd with this and other
partisan salvos, including a jibe at Bush running mate Dan Quayle.
   ``Dan Quayle asks us to believe that if he ever had to fill in
for George Bush, America could get by on a wing and a prayer,'' he
said.
   Dukakis' science proposal included asking the National Science
Foundation to draft annual, state-by-state report cards on the
quality of science education, and programs to improve science
teaching.
   He also proposed recruiting active and retired scientists and
engineers to teach on at least a part-time basis, creating
workplace centers to retrain employees for new technologies, and
establishing a network of national centers of excellence modeled
after state programs that encourage research and technology
development.
   The vice president has repeatedly cited the case of Willie
Horton Jr., a convicted murderer who escaped while on a weekend
furlough granted by the Massachusetts prison system last year and
later slashed a man and twice raped his fiancee.
   ``I think when you use human tragedy for political purposes,
that's kind of the ultimate cynical act in politics,'' Dukakis
said, adding that similar tragedies had occurred under the federal
furlough program and another instituted in California when
President Reagan was governor of that state in the early 1970s.
   ``To use these human tragedies for your own political purposes,
I think, is really a very crass and cynical thing,'' the
Massachusetts governor said on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``And I think
it's frankly because Mr. Bush has never done anything on law
enforcement and crime. Whenever he's been given an assignment (in
the Reagan administration) he's failed.''
   Dukakis vowed that during his nationally televised debate with
Bush in Los Angeles and in the remaining four weeks of the
campaign, ``I think the American people are going to come to know
Mike Dukakis and who he is and how strongly he believes in their
concerns.''
   Dukakis spent several hours Monday night preparing for his
showdown with Bush, which he and his aides view as crucial to his
chances of overcoming Bush's apparent lead in most polls.
   ``This one is out there to be won. You know it and I know it,''
an upbeat Dukakis told a Columbus Day gathering in Levittown, N.Y.
The Democratic nominee then marched in New York City's parade,
where he was enthusiastically received by thousands lining the
streets, many toting Dukakis placards.
   The Massachusetts governor was flanked by New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo, Mayor Edward Koch and John F. Kennedy Jr. as he strolled
through Manhattan.
   Levittown, a model community of post World War II housing
programs, served as a symbolic backdrop for Dukakis' announcement
of his housing plan, which would allow first-time home buyers to
use up to $10,000 of their IRAs or pension plans for a down payment.
   It also would amend federal housing programs to put home
ownership _ which Dukakis called the ``cornerstone of the American
dream'' _ within the reach of five million families who now rent
because they cannot afford to buy a home, Dukakis aides said. It
would complement a previously announced program to promote
construction of new, affordable housing through partnerships with
building and trade unions and developers, they said.
   Dukakis recalled bipartisan post-war efforts in Levittown and
across the nation to ``promise to provide affordable housing for
all Americans'' but said the Reagan administration ``broke that
promise in the early 1980s.''
   The Dukakis ``Home START'' program would allow up to $10,000 to
be removed from IRA accounts or 401K pension systems for a housing
down payment without a tax penalty that they would currently face
by making such a withdrawal.
   It also would change Federal Housing Administration regulations
to raise the maximum loan amount to bring it more in line with
current market prices and allow first-time buyers to get an
FHA-insured mortgage with only a 3 percent down payment.
   Campaign advisers said the principal cost of the home ownership
plan would be an estimated $400 million loss in tax revenue
resulting from the increased incentive for people to contribute to
Individual Retirement Accounts.
