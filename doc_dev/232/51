relations man who is President Bush's chief image-maker, is a

   At the other end of the spectrum, Marlin Fitzwater, the

$55,000 and outside income of $2,722 to $4,520. He also reported

$238,544 or more. His interests included an advertising firm, radio
stations, mobile billboards and a bar in Truckee, Calif.
   The forms were released Monday by the office of White House

   Rogich, in a telephone interview from California. where he was
lending a hand to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the final
stops of his post-summit tour of America, said he had put his
holdings in a blind trust and ordered his trustee to sell off his
stocks.

Vegas corporation, W.C.W. Corp., which owns two casinos, the form
showed.
   Rogich, who helped put together the ads for Ronald Reagan's

Bush's assistant for ``special activities and initiatives'' last
October.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu reported on his disclosure

Association, $3,269 she made from an insurance agency and $9,151 in
salary that Sununu himself earned in his final weeks as governor in
