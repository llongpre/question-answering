   Scientific researchers in American universities
should be required to disclose financial relationships with industry
that might create conflicts of interest, a congressional
subcommittee was told Tuesday.
   ``Biomedical science has been intensely commercialized within
universities over a relatively short period of time,'' said Sheldon
Krimsky, associate professor of urban and environmental policy at
Tufts University. ``I have heard it said within the scientific
community that everyone gains from this marriage of academia and
commerce. Nothing can be further from the truth.
   ``Not only are there losses, but some of these losses threaten
the integrity of our scientific institutions and weaken public
confidence in science.''
   Krimsky said that at least 45 per cent of the biomedical faculty
at Harvard, as an example, have formal affiliations with 36
biotechnology companies.
   He called for disclosure of financial interests related to
research being conducted by scientists applying for grants.
   Dr. George D. Lundberg, vice president for scientific information
of the American Medical Association, cautioned, however, that
barring researchers from working in areas where they had a financial
interest ``would be devastating, and we would lose many qualified
people and we would lose much information that would have come from
those people if they had worked.''
   ``A lot of things motivate human beings, and money's one of the
big ones,'' Lundberg said.
   He said that if he had been a journal editor in 1905 looking for
somebody to write an article on automobiles, he would have asked
Henry Ford.
   ``Would Henry Ford have been in conflict of interest? Totally,''
he said. ``Would I care? No. I'd love that. He'd know the most about
it.''
   David Noble, a professor of history at Drexel University who is
suing the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on grounds that he
was fired for speaking out against conflicts of interest, said
university researchers ``are free to make undisclosed arrangements
with private corporations in which they often have equally
undisclosed personal roles.''
   ``They are free to shape and profit from the public investment in
research and many have done so,'' he said. He argued that such
collaboration between universities and industries should be
accompanied by ``proper disclosure and procedural safeguards.''
   Noble criticized MIT's Industrial Liaison Program, in which he
said firms pay a membership fee to the institution and gain access
to research publications and other information.
   He told the subcommittee that ``nearly all the member
corporations of the ILP were multinationals with no necessary
allegiance to the United States, that fully half of them were
foreign, that 57 of them were major Japanese competitors, and that
the ILP had for nearly a decade been operating an overseas sales
office in downtown Tokyo.''
   Paul E. Gray, president of MIT, told the panel that the
institution ``would not operate this program were its only benefit a
stream of revenue.''
   ``The educational and research functions of this science-based
university require broadly-based understanding of industrial
practice and industrial needs,''Gray said. ``The ILP is an important
vehicle for developing that understanding, and this is its principal
benefit to the institute.''
   Patricia K. Woolf of the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton
University, agreed that such arrangements can be beneficial but said
the subject needs further study.
   Dr. David Blumenthal, senior vice president of Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, said that ``academic research
institutions must insist on disclosure of relationships with
industry that may create economic conflicts of interest.''
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the human resources
subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee, said, ``I
am sure that many Americans will be justifiably outraged by some of
the ways that federally funded scientific data are being sold, or
manipulated for personal gain.''
   Rep. Larkin Smith of Mississippi, the ranking Republican on the
panel, said Congress should ``send a strong signal to the research
community that scientific misconduct will not be tolerated.''
   At the same time, he said, ``A careful balance must be struck
between avoiding conflicts of interest and achieving scientific
breakthroughs that ultimately could benefit millions. We should not
allow limited or individual cases of misconduct to stand in the way
of overall progress.''
