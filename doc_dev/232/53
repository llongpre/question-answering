<LEADPARA>  WHEN it comes to fueling yourself for activity, most sports nutritionists
agree that the single most important item to consume is fluid.;   "To perform
at your peak, you've got to be as hydrated as you can be," says William J.
Evans, chief of the Human Physiology Laboratory at the Human Nutrition
Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. "Even small amounts of
dehydration can cause a decrease in performance."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But exactly which fluid to consume -- plain old water or one of the sports
drinks now flooding the market -- is the source of some controversy. Sports
drink proponents say these beverages are superior replacement fluids because
they not only replenish the water lost through vigorous exercise, but also
supply carbohydrates and electrolytes, too. But some nutritionists argue that
commercial sports drinks are little more than glorified sugar water, and that
plain water -- plus a splash of fruit juice if desired -- is a cheaper and
better choice for most active people.;   The granddaddy of sports drinks is
Gatorade, invented in 1965 at the University of Florida for the school's
football team, the Gators. Gatorade contains 6 percent carbohydrates, in the
form of sugars -- sucrose and glucose -- which provide energy for working
muscles. Sports drinks are superior to other carbohydrate-rich beverages, such
as soda or fruit juice, says the Gatorade Co., since other beverages contain
concentrations greater than 10 percent carbohydrates and are not as quickly
absorbed.;   "Ingesting carbonated beverages during exercise may cause
gastrointestinal distress," adds Robert Murray, director of the Gatorade
Exercise Physiology Laboratory in Barrington, Ill. "And caffeine, which is a
diuretic, may actually promote fluid loss.";   Today, other sports drinks with
names like Exceed, 10K and Max are muscling into Gatorade's turf. Some of
their appeal is psychological, as athletes look for products that will give
them the competitive edge. But what many people don't realize is that most
sports drinks are designed for consumption during high-intensity endurance
activity, to help you stay hydrated and maintain a normal blood-sugar level,
so you can exercise a long time.;   For most activities, "sports drinks
provide relatively little advantage compared to plain cold water or a Kool-Aid
type of beverage, which has good carbohydrate content and costs considerably
less," says Col. Eldon Askew, chief of military research at the U.S. Army
Reserve Institute of Environmental Medicine in Natick, Mass. "Military rations
are relatively high in sodium chloride, with adequate potassium and calcium.
So sports drinks are not particularly necessary in our view.";   Sports drinks
are "sugar-laden beverages that offer very little nutritional value," writes
Boston nutritionist Nancy Clark, in "Nancy Clark's Sports Nutrition
Guidebook." "Commercial fluid replacers are nutritionally similar to diluted
soft drinks but more expensive. . . . And if you're tempted to replace
potassium losses with commercially prepared fluid replacement beverages,
remember that most of these special sports drinks are potassium-poor.";  
Plain water works well for most recreational athletes, says Clark. She advises
exercisers involved in high-intensity endurance events, lasting more than 90
minutes, to make their own sports drinks with water plus some carbohydrates
for energy. Popular home-made sports beverages include diluted fruit juices,
herb tea with honey and -- for cross-country skiers -- warm blueberry soup.;  
Endurance athletes can also consume solid carbohydrates for energy. Bananas
and granola bars, plus lots of water, are popular with long-distance cyclists
who can tolerate eating while pedaling. But many other kinds of competitive
endurance athletes prefer only to drink during an event.;   "If you prefer
liquids to solid food, create your own carbohydrate drink by dissolving 20
tablespoons of table sugar and a pinch of salt in a quart of water," suggests
a recent issue of Running Research News.;   Sweetened beverages are often more
palatable and stimulate thirst so you'll drink more. "Thirst is not a good
indicator of hydration," says Tufts' Evans, an adviser to the Boston Bruins
hockey team whose players are required to drink a can of carbohydrate
replacement beverage before leaving the locker room at the end of a game. "The
sooner after exercise you consume carbohydrates, the more rapidly you'll
replace glycogen stores.";   Also, he says, if players quench their thirst
immediately after a game they may be less likely to tank up at a bar. "Alcohol
has a profoundly dehydrating effect," Evans notes, "and is a very poor
nutritional choice."  </TEXT>
