   Under dark and cloudy skies, 15
solar-powered racers hummed off the Statehouse lawn Wednesday on
the first leg of a Vermont-to-Massachusetts road rally.
   Sounding more like golf carts than race cars, the solar electric
vehicles whooshed away after Gov. Madeleine Kunin waved a green
flag to begin the second annual American Tour de Sol.
   The race winds its way through Vermont and New Hampshire before
ending Sunday at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. The 234-mile
race is organized by the Northeast Solar Energy Association.
   Despite another day of dark, cloudy skies, the racers said there
was enough daylight to recharge their batteries.
   ``It's been sucking up some energy,'' Gregory Halverson, a
junior at Conval High School in Peterborough, N.H., said of his
car's solar panels. ``As long as there's some light, we're getting
some energy.''
   ``This is happening because of people's concerns about the
environment, air pollution in cities, and the limitation of fossil
fuels,'' said Nancy Hazard, the group's associate director. ``It's
really positive and encouraging to see people excited and
interested about the technology.''
   The cars in the race are either fully or partially powered by
sunlight. The bodies are lined with photovoltaic cells, or solar
panels, which capture sunlight, convert it to electricity and then
store it in a bank of ordinary car batteries.
   These batteries can also be charged by plugging them into
electrical outlets or other solar panels.
   Solar electric cars are environmentally safer than
gasoline-burning cars because they do not give off any exhaust
pollution, Hazard said. The burning of fossil fuels is blamed for
creating one-third of the greenhouse gases.
   Entrants in the race came from California, Florida,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Vermont.
   After stopping over in Fairlee on Wednesday night, the racers
will travel another 39 miles to Canaan, N.H., Thursday.
