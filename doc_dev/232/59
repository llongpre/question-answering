   I have just completed the order form for our university library of a book, "Feminism and Freedom," that was reviewed in the Journal. 
As I filled out the price, the shock struck me: 323 pages, $39.95. 

   If you wish to examine why college costs rise faster than the cost-of-living index, you can start with our libraries.
