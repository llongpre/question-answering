<HEAD>Tufts University Pulls $5 Million in South Africa-Linked Investments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tufts University has withdrawn investments
in companies that do business in South Africa, except for those
involved with communications and humanitarian endeavors.
   The decision was reached Saturday during a board of trustees
meeting and was approved by both faculty and students. Under the
action, Tufts will withdraw investments of approximately $5 million
from U.S. companies. The school has a total investment portfolio of
about $120 million.
   In 1986, Tufts students staged demonstrations against the
apartheid policies of the white South African government. Students
built a shantytown and held a sit-in demonstration.
   Tufts University President Jean Mayer said, ``The fact we decided
to change policy doesn't mean we were wrong 10 years ago. It just
means things have changed.''
