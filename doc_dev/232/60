   Gov. John Sununu announced Monday he will
not seek an unprecedented fourth two-year term as New Hampshire's
chief executive.
   The announcement at a Statehouse news conference ended months of
speculation about the 48-year-old Republican's political future and
seems likely to set off a scramble in the GOP ranks.
   Sununu said he plans to return to private business to help pay
hefty tuition bills for several of his eight children. But he
wouldn't rule out taking a post in Vice President George Bush's
presidential campaign. Sununu played a key role in Bush's critical
victory in New Hampshire's leadoff presidential primary three
months ago.
   Portsmouth lawyer Paul McEachern, who lost to Sununu by eight
percentage points in 1986, appears likely to run unopposed for the
Democratic nomination.
   Former Manchester Mayor Robert Shaw has announced intentions to
run for the GOP nomination, and among others said to be interested
is Republican Rep. Judd Gregg. A half-dozen others are said to be
waiting to step in should Gregg vacate the 2nd Congressional
District seat.
   Some GOP leaders fear a primary bloodbath if Gregg leaves a seat
that has been Republican for more than 70 years _ potentially
opening the door to a Democratic victory.
   Sununu's decision also has implications for the stalled Seabrook
nuclear power plant. Sununu has been among its staunchest
supporters _ while McEachern vows never to let it open.
   A fiscally conservative governor, Sununu takes credit for
helping erase a $44 million deficit and replacing it with a surplus
under his administration. His critics accuse him of leaving too
much to communities to decide, including planning for the state's
booming growth. But Sununu has long held that the state should
offer technical assistance to cities and towns while letting them
chart their own courses.
   Sununu was a business consultant and Tufts University
engineering professor before his election as governor in 1982. He
was born in Havana, Cuba, where his father was an import-export
executive.
   He served in New Hampshire's House in 1972, then lost state
Senate bids in 1974 and 1976. In 1978, he ran unsuccessfully for
Executive Council and, in 1980, finished second in a field of 11 in
a U.S. Senate primary.
   After winning the nomination in 1982, he beat Democratic Gov.
Hugh Gallen. Sununu won re-election in 1984 by easily beating
former House Minority Leader Chris Spirou and in 1986 beat
McEachern.
