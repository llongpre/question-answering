   Lauro Cavazos, president of Texas Tech University, was sworn in as secretary of education, becoming the first Hispanic member of a president's cabinet. 

   Earlier yesterday, the Senate voted 94-0 to confirm Mr. Cavazos's nomination. 
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee Chairman Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) called Mr. Cavazos, the son of a Texas ranch foreman, "an authentic American success story and an inspiration to millions of young students." 

   There isn't much time left for Mr. Cavazos to make a policy mark. 
His appointment appears calculated to help the presidential campaign of Vice President George Bush, who has been courting Hispanic voters, particularly in Texas. 

   Mr. Cavazos is well known in Texas, where he has advocated efforts to lower the high school drop-out rate through grass-roots efforts aimed at strengthening the family. 
Mr. Cavazos, 61 years old, is on leave from Texas Tech in Lubbock, where he has been president since 1980. 
Before that, he was dean of Tufts University's medical school for five years. 

   As education secretary, he succeeds William Bennett, whose resignation took effect yesterday.
