<HEAD>Harvard Law School Adopts Speech Guidelines</HEAD>

   Harvard Law School has adopted
guidelines designed to ensure free speech after an incident last
year when a protester prevented former Contra leader Adolfo Calero
from speaking.
   Under the rules, speakers must respond to questions from the
audience and abide by the decisions of a moderator. Disruptive
demonstrators can be ejected.
   The guidelines were created by a committee formed by law school
officials after Tufts University student Joshua Laub jumped onto a
podium and yelled epithets at Calero when the Nicaraguan rebel
leader was speaking at Harvard last October.
   After Laub was arrested, the speech was canceled, and Harvard's
ability to serve as a forum for free speech came under question.
   ``It seems to have achieved what a year ago would have been
perceived to be difficult,'' said Richard Parker, a law professor
and member of the committee. ``Protest is allowed, but within
limits.''
   Committee members say the guidelines attempt to find a middle
ground between allowing speakers to present their message and
permitting protesters the right to dissent.
   Law professor and committee member Alan Dershowitz said the
nine-member committee, composed of administrators, faculty and
students, strived to be sensitive to giving audience members free
speech.
   ``A good way to handle questions about how much protest is
acceptable is to force the speaker to confront the criticism,''
Parker said of the stipulation requiring speakers to face questions.
   Committee members said the moderator has the power to suspend,
move or cancel speeches. The guidelines also say people introducing
speakers should not be from the group sponsoring the event.
