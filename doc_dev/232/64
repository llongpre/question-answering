   President Reagan nominated Texas Tech University President Lauro Cavazos to be secretary of education, succeeding William Bennett, who will depart next month. 

   If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Cavazos will become the nation's first Hispanic cabinet secretary. 

   There isn't enough time left in the Reagan term for the new secretary to make much of a policy mark. 
However, the nomination appears calculated to help Vice President George Bush, who has been courting Hispanic voters, particularly in Mr. Cavazos' home state of Texas. 
He was considered for a cabinet post during Mr. Reagan's first term on the recommendation of former Sen. John Tower (R., Texas), according to a White House official. 
However, in the most recent round, Mr. Bush was advocating him, the official said. 

   Mr. Bush promised several weeks ago that he would put a Hispanic in his cabinet if elected president, and he reportedly urged the appointment of a Hispanic when Attorney General Edwin Meese announced his resignation recently. 
The president, asked yesterday by a reporter if he was stealing Mr. Bush's thunder, retorted, "No, I'm just still working at the job here." 

   Mr. Cavazos, 61 years old, is a professor of anatomy at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and a professor of biological sciences at the university, in addition to his administrative duties. 
He is a graduate of that university, which is in Lubbock, and received his doctorate in physiology from Iowa State University. 
He formerly taught at Tufts University School of Medicine and the Medical College of Virginia. 

   "I share your views" on education, Mr. Cavazos told Mr. Reagan as the president announced the nomination at the White House. 
Mr. Reagan praised him as "an ideal selection" and said Mr. Bennett had been "the best thing to happen to American education since the McGuffey Reader."
