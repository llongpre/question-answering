The National Institutes of Health will develop guidelines defining conflict of 
interest for non-government scientists who receive federal funds for their 
research, the director of the agency told Congress Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James B. Wyngaarden, director of NIH, which awards about $7 billion in 
grants annually, disclosed the plan to a House subcommittee that is 
investigating whether government-sponsored research is being compromised by 
scientists' financial associations with private companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The Public Health Service is concerned about maintaining the integrity of 
science," Wyngaarden told the Government Operations Committee's subcommittee on 
human resources and intergovernmental relations. "We believe that protection of 
that integrity must be a joint effort on the part of the government and the 
institutions where research is performed." 
</P>
<P>
He and others said that such partnerships were necessary to the advancement of 
science, but warned that they could also create a climate for conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I have heard it said within the scientific community that everyone gains from 
this marriage of academia and commerce," said Sheldon Krimsky, an associate 
professor in the department of urban and environmental policy at Tufts 
University. "Nothing can be further from the truth. Not only are there losses, 
but some of these losses threaten the integrity of our scientific institutions 
and weaken public confidence in science." 
</P>
<P>
Wyngaarden said that NIH requires its scientists to disclose their financial 
interests to prove they have no monetary association with any company whose 
products they study, but as yet, the agency has no similar rule for 
non-governmental researchers who receive federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Wyngaarden said, NIH and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health 
Administration plan to sponsor a two-day meeting later this month on conflict 
of interest and what the agencies should do about it. 
</P>
<P>
He said the conference will take up issues such as whether a researcher's 
financial interest or arrangement with a company would necessarily influence 
the outcome of the research, and whether scientists should be permitted to 
profit financially from information obtained in the course of their research. 
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure that research results are not distorted by financial 
involvements of investigators, but we must also ensure that the progress of 
science is unhindered," Wyngaarden said. 
</P>

Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) attacked university programs, 
specifically at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that encourage 
exchanges of research findings with corporations -- including many foreign 
companies. Weiss and others contend that such arrangements can hurt U.S. 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
In MIT's Industrial Liaison Program, firms pay the institute a membership fee 
-- in some cases as much as $50,000 annually -- and are allowed access to MIT 
research publications and other data. 
</P>
<P>
David Noble, a history professor at Drexel University who is suing MIT on the 
grounds that he was dismissed from the institute for publicly condemning 
conflicts of interest, told the subcommittee that all member corporations of 
the Industrial Liaison Program were multinationals "with no necessary 
allegiance to the United States" and that the majority of the foreign 
corporation-members were "major Japanese competitors." 
</P>
<P>
MIT President Paul E. Gray defended the program. He said: "The educational and 
research functions of this science-based university require broadly based 
understanding of industrial practice and industrial needs. The ILP is an 
important vehicle for developing that understanding, and this is its principal 
benefit to the institute."
