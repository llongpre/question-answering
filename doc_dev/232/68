   President Reagan today announced he is
nominating Texas Tech University President Lauro Cavazos to be
secretary of education, marking the first time a Hispanic has ever
been named to the Cabinet.
   `This is a proud day ... for all Americans,'' Reagan said in
announcing the selection of Cavazos to succeed Education Secretary
William Bennett, who had announced earlier this year that he would
not serve throughout the remainder of Reagan's term.
   ``It's hard right at this moment to think of a more exciting
moment,'' said Reagan, who appeared in the White House briefing
room with Bennett and Cavazos, 61.
   Asked whether he had selected Cavazos because of his heritage,
Reagan said, ``I didn't even ask him that.'' Reagan said he
selected Cavazos because he was ``the best-fitted man to succeed''
Bennett.
   Vice President George Bush, in a speech to the League of United
Latin American Citizens in Dallas last July 6, had pledged to name
a Hispanic to the Cabinet if he were elected to succeed Reagan.
   Asked today if he had allowed Bush to influence the decision,
Reagan replied, ``No, I'm just still working at the job here.''
   Bennett said he was ready to turn over to Cavazos ``the apple,
the pencil and the key'' to the Cabinet officer's door.
   Reagan called Cavazos ``a distinguished educator.''
   ``With his administrative skills and his many accomplishments in
the field of education, Dr. Cavazos is an ideal selection for this
Cabinet post,'' the president said.
   ``His commitment to the profession of teaching and to excellence
in education and his belief in getting back to basics and things
like homework, and above all his emphasis on education of special
importance to America's minorities, are messages I hope he will
sound far and wide across the nation,'' Reagan said.
   ``This job has had its thrills during the past 91 months, and
not a few of those experiences I've shared with you in this room,''
he said. ``But it's hard right now to think of a more exciting
moment than this one, and the knowledge that Dr. Cavazos will be
the first Hispanic-American member of the Cabinet,'' he said.
   ``That says a lot about him and about Americans of Hispanic
heritage. It also says something about America _ America as a place
of opportunity and hope,'' he said.
   Cavazos is a native of south Texas and the son of a foreman of
the Santa Gertrudis Division of the huge King Ranch.
   He has served as president of Texas Tech since 1980 while also
heading the Texas Tech University Health and Sciences Center. He
was the first Texas Tech graduate and first Hispanic to hold those
two posts.
   Previously, he was a member of the faculty of Tufts University
School of Medicine as professor of anatomy and earlier had taught
at the Medical College of Virginia.
   Reagan also used the occasion to pay tribute to Bennett, calling
the departing Cabinet secretary the ``best thing to happen'' to
American education.
   In early May, Bennett said he would resign in September to
return to private life.
   Bennett made headlines throughout his tenure with acerbic
criticisms of teacher unions, school bureaucracy, colleges raising
tuitions twice as fast as inflation, and the ``Jim Crow math and
back-of-the-bus science'' meted out to black children in ghetto
schools. He called Chicago's schools the nation's worst and said
that system was in an ``educational meltdown.''
