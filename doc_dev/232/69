   Chinese students at U.S. universities
are setting up news hot lines and raising thousands of dollars to
provide communications equipment for the protesting students in
Beijing.
   The $27,000 raised so far by students in the Boston area
includes $15,000 from a fund-raiser Tuesday night. The money for
such equipment as fax machines and copiers and material will have
to be taken clandestinely into China by students returning home or
by other friends of the movement, organizers said Wednesday.
   Dubbed the ``May 4th Foundation,'' after one of China's first
pro-democracy student uprisings in 1919, the fund has drawn chiefly
from the roughly 600 Chinese students studying in the Boston area.
It has also attracted contributions from students from Hong Kong
and Taiwan as well as a few from Americans.
   The demonstration that has dominated Beijing and other Chinese
cities for weeks ``will be remembered probably as the greatest
popular movement in China,'' said Pei Minxin, 31, a third-year
graduate student in government at Harvard.
   ``It has accomplished a great deal so far. It has aroused the
political consciousness of the Chinese people and also provided the
Chinese people both at home and abroad with a sense of hope,'' he
said.
   In addition to raising money, Chinese students in the Boston
area have set up an informal information center.
   The Walker Center for Ecumenical Exchange, an international
study center in Newton, Mass., has donated its phones to Chinese
students who man them in 24-hour shifts, monitoring news reports,
receiving information from China, and passing on news not available
on the streets of Beijing.
   Wednesday was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's turn
to man the phones. Chinese students from Harvard, Boston
University, Northeastern, Brandeis and Tufts University also have
participated.
   Center Director Gordon Schultz said he is ``terrified'' of the
phone bill he will receive, but hopes to raise funds from Americans
to support the effort.
   The center also is providing computers and fax machines for the
students.
   At the University of California at Berkeley and Stanford
University, students are compiling news reports and using fax
machines to transmit the information back to China under the name
``operation newslift.''
   Li Hao, 24, a student at MIT, said the fund-raising effort is
designed to sustain the demonstration. But he said the protest
movement has already achieved its primary goal.
   ``China is no longer what it was before,'' Hao said. ``The
Chinese government can no longer do whatever they want.''
   The students studying here say they wish they could participate
in the China demonstrations and are acting to contribute something.
But they are anxious for their friends.
   ``Most of my classmates are in Tiananmen Square, so I'm
concerned very much,'' said Hao, a graduate of Beijing University.
