   With society's increased attention on the
environmental threat posed by toxic compounds, Tufts University
plans to begin the nation's first collegiate program in hazardous
waste management.
   ``We've received a lot of support from industry because there's
no other program like this in the country right now,'' Gene Blake,
asociate director of Tufts Center for Environmental Management,
said in a prepared announcement.
   ``There's a real need for it,'' he said.
   The interdisciplinary master's degree course to be announced
today is designed to educate students on issues related to
hazardous waste and will focus on environmental health, science,
policy and technology, said school officials.
   Representatives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the
Audobon Society, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Quality Engineering and several engineering consultants and Tufts
faculty members will develop the curriculum before classes start
next fall.
   The EPA has targeted hundreds of sites across the country for
cleanup of hazardous materials under its Superfund program.
   ``We're hearing from government and citizens groups that it's
hard to find good people aware of the issues surrounding current
policy, technology and research,'' Blake said.
   Linfield C. Brown, chairman of Tufts' civil engineering
department, said students will be required to have some background
in calculus, chemistry and biology, but the program will focus on
risk assessment, management and communication, health effects and
environmental management regulations.
   Blake said the new venture is designed to do more than just
teach students how to clean up hazardous waste sites.
   ``We want to teach people how to avoid waste problems in the
first place,'' Blake said.
   For a final one semester course, all students will be placed in
small teams to act as consultants and meet with federal and state
officials to develop solutions for existing environmental
management or policy problems.
   Tufts Department of Urban and Environmental Policy is assisting
in development of the new program. Students can complete the
program in one year full-time, or in three years on a part-time
basis.
