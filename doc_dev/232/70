<LEADPARA>  A heart-attack patient spends 12 1/2 days in a prominent Boston hospital. In
California, a comparable patient gets out in less than nine. What accounts for
that pricey, 3 1/2-day difference? A new study of men and women treated in six
California and Massachusetts hospitals found that neither differences in the
patients' conditions nor differences in their outcomes justified most
disparities in lengths of stay. The disparities remain unexplained, said the
study by Dr. Sheldon Greenfield of Tufts University in Boston.  </LEADPARA>
