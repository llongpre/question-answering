   Lauro Cavazos' father always stressed the
importance of education to his three sons growing up in the untamed
brushland of the huge King Ranch.
   The strength of that message took Cavazos all the way to the
White House, where President Reagan Tuesday nominated him to
succeed William J. Bennett as secretary of education.
   Cavazos, 61, is the president of Texas Tech University and its
medical school, and the first Hispanic to hold that post. The
24,000-student school is the largest in the country run by a
Hispanic.
   ``I am convinced education is the key to many things. If you
have sufficient education, you can solve most any problem in the
world. Famine. Ecological problems. Nuclear problems. Racism.
They're all solved with education,'' he said.
   At Texas Tech, Cavazos paid special attention to minority
education, overseeing the creation of a special office to handle
minority student problems and increasing efforts to recruit and
retain minorities. He spoke out regularly on the importance of
curtailing the dropout rate of minority students.
   During his tenure, Hispanic enrollment increased from 3.6
percent in 1980 to 6.3 percent in 1987, while black enrollment
edged up from 1.85 percent to 2.4 percent.
   Cavazos received the National Hispanic Leadership award of the
League of United Latin American Citizens in July for his efforts to
reduce the dropout rate among Hispanic youth.
   Despite his soft-spoken, friendly demeanor and good
organizational skills, Cavazos was sometimes criticized for being
stretched too thin in running both the university and its medical
school.
   Dr. Bernhard Mittemeyer, executive vice president of Tech's
Health Sciences Center, said Cavazos was easy to work with but
occasionally difficult to track down.
   ``He basically is a delegator,'' Mittemeyer said. ``He works
best in an atmosphere where people are able to solve problems
through communication.''
   Cavazos also aroused opposition from the faculty by proposing
five-year performance reviews of all tenured professors. The
faculty passed a vote of no confidence in his presidency in 1984,
but Cavazos eventually succeeded in getting the tenure plan adopted.
   Known informally as Larry, Cavazos is one of a trio of
remarkable brothers who left the King Ranch, where their father was
a cattle foreman, to attend what was then Texas Technological
College.
   His brother Bobby was an All-American running back who now has
his own ranch, while Dick became a four-star Army general.
   Cavazos earned a bachelor's degree in zoology and a master's
degree in cytology at Tech before getting a doctorate in physiology
from Iowa State University in 1954. He is not a medical doctor.
   He first taught as an instructor of anatomy, and later as an
associate professor, at the Medical College of Virginia in
Richmond. Later, he was dean of the school of medicine at Tufts
University in Medford, Mass., before becoming the first alumnus to
be named president at Texas Tech in 1980.
   Cavazos has continued the family tradition at the university. He
and his wife, Peggy Ann, have 10 children, seven of whom hold Tech
degrees.
   Cavazos announced in May that he would resign as president in
July 1989 and, after a leave, return to teach anatomy in the
medical school, where he has tenure.
   ``One needs to leave the presidency when you think perhaps
you've given direction to the institution and strong leadership,''
Cavazos said at the time. ``I really believe things are in good
shape here.''
   Cavazos will take a cut in pay from his current salary of
$143,800 plus allowances and benefits. Cabinet members are paid
$99,500 annually plus $10,000 for expenses, which are tax
deductible.
   Mittemeyer said that Cavazos' experience in both academia and
administration will serve him well in his new post.
   ``I think that Dr. Cavazos, while he is mild mannered, also has
convictions about the needs of education and will speak up when he
needs to speak up,'' he said.
