   The award of the Nobel Prize in Medicine to a Japanese (World-Wide, Oct. 13) who has chosen to spend his mature research life in Europe and, for most of the past decade, in the U.S., gives us some additional perspective on the warnings coming out of the Education Department concerning the Japanese educational "threat." 

   From elementary school through the final stages of graduate education and continuing research, the American system, for all its chaos, inconsistency and extraordinary discrepancies in standards, will continue to produce some badly educated youngsters along with more creative minds and imaginative thinkers than any other nation in the world. 
That is why Prof. Susumu Tonegawa took his Ph.D. at the University of California. 

   We should always be willing to learn from others, to take a hard and critical look at what we are doing, as long as we remember that this anarchy we call the American educational system is unique on this earth.
