   Cistron Biotechnology Inc., Pine Brook, N.J., said it sued
PeproTech Inc., alleging infringement of a patent covering
the production of an immune system regulator.
   Cistron, which said it holds an exclusive license for the
production of recombinant human Interleukin-1 beta, filed the
suit in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J. The company was
joined by New England Medical Center Hospitals Inc., Tufts
University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Wellesley College, the licensers of the Interleukin-1 beta
technology to Cistron, which makes immune system regulators.

   They are seeking damages and an injunction against further
infringement. Robert Goldman, president of PeproTech, said
the company "produces our own version of IL-1 beta in our own
proprietary system." Dr. Goldman added that "we do not
infringe on the patent in question." PeproTech, a closely
held, Rocky Hill, N.J., concern, makes recombinant proteins
for sale to the research market.
