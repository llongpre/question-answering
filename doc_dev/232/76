   President Bush joined in honoring the late
Rep. Mickey Leland and others for their efforts in fighting hunger
as he proclaimed Monday as World Food Day.
   Bush met with Alison Leland, widow of the Texas congressman who
was killed Aug. 7 when a light plane crashed on a flight to a camp
for Sudanese refugees in Western Ethiopia, and with 12 other
winners of the annual Presidential End Hunger Awards or their
representatives.
   After meeting privately with the recipients in the Oval Office,
Bush appeared with them in the Roosevelt Room of the White House,
where he said, ``What you have demonstrated is that each of us can
make a difference, right in our own neighborhood or on the other
side of the world as well.''
   Bush then signed the proclamation, declaring, ``As we observe
World Food Day, let us renew our determination to seek effective
answers to the problem of world hunger.''
   The awards were presented by entertainers Steve Allen and Connie
Stevens at a ceremony in the Executive Office Building next door to
the White House.
   Mark L. Edelman, acting administrator of the Agency for
International Development, told the audience that as an AID worker
in Africa ``I have seen hunger up close _ I have seen starving
people _ and it's a sight not soon to be forgotten.''
   Allen said he had gone hungry as a teenager.
   ``After three days without food I became a beggar and then I
became a thief,'' he said. ``I went into a store and stole some
food so I could eat it.''
   Those honored along with Leland included three other people who
died when their light plane crashed in Ethiopia in August _ Gladys
D. Gilbert, special projects officer with AID in Ethiopia; Thomas
J. Worrick, acting AID representative in that country; and
Worrick's wife, Roberta.
   Others honored were:
   _Maurice Weiss, a Los Angeles produce merchant who founded a
center for the distibution of fresh produce that would otherwise
have been thrown away.
   _Chevron Crop. for famine relief assistance in Sudan.
   _Ted Danson, an actor in the TV series ``Cheers,'' for his
efforts in promoting television shows on hunger, homelessness and
poverty.
   _Jean Mayer, president of Tufts University, who established the
nation's first graduate school of nutrition.
   _Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo., for ``leadership in seeking solutions
to chronic hunger and malnutrition in the United States and
abroad.''
   _The late Alan Woods, administrator of AID from 1987 to 1989.
   _Hill Staffers for the Hungry and Homeless, an organization of
congressional aides who donate food, clothing and other items for
the needy.
   _Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance, which recruits
volunteers for short-term overseas assignments.
   _Julia Taft, former director of the Office of U.S. Foreign
Disaster Assistance.
