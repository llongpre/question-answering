<TEXT>
<P>
Can a Connecticut Yankee be king of the basketball court deep in the heart of 
the Texas hill country? 
</P>
<P>
After all, this is the city of Threadgill's, where Janis Joplin washed down 
chicken-fried steak with a few bottles of beer; the town of the dearly departed 
Armadillo World Headquarters, where Willie Nelson donned a bandanna and reached 
for his 12-string guitar, the place Jerry Jeff Walker sang about rednecks. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Tom Penders would have seemed out of place here and why 
not? After all, he was truly an East Coast-type of guy what with coaching jobs 
at Tufts, Columbia, Fordham and Rhode Island. But since he's transplanted 
himself, Penders sings a different tune as basketball coach at the University 
of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 44-year-old Tom Penders is winning so many games and influencing so 
many people in the state capital that some are willing to embrace this high 
school coach's son from Stratford, Conn., forgive him his roots and call him 
one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Deathe, 65, once managed many of President Lyndon Johnson's business 
interests during Johnson's White House years and now owns a custom-made boot 
store on Cameron Road. Deathe gave Penders a pair of ostrich boots, his 
initials stitched into the leather uppers between a Longhorn steer and a 
basketball stitched on either side. 
</P>
<P>
"From the minute he landed here in Austin, he let it be known he would become a 
Texan," Deathe said. "I am damned proud to have him wearing my boots." 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a 25-9 season and an NCAA tournament appearance, Penders begins his 
second year at the end of the Longhorns' bench with expectations about as lofty 
as one of those high notes his good buddy Willie can yank right out of the air. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he is a fledgling Texan, Penders counts eight pairs of boots in his 
closet, each pair a gift. In his office behind his desk hangs a large oil 
painting of a longhorn steer standing at attention, given to him by Darrell 
Royal, the former Texas football coach and athletic director who was a member 
of the search committee that recommended Penders be hired. 
</P>
<P>
Royal said he has grown close to the new basketball coach and believes that 
where Penders grew up should have no effect on his coaching. In fact, Royal 
dislikes making too much of regional differences. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, we say thank and back east they may say think, but what's the big 
dee-ul?" Royal said. 
</P>
<P>
What, indeed? Penders, this kid who used to play croquet on the lawn in 
Connecticut, is getting invited to cow chip-throwing contests and a whole lot 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"I judged an Arabian horse show," Penders said. "They wanted somebody who 
didn't know anything about horses, so I guess I filled the bill. I also judged 
a fajitas cook-off. Ate 32 of them. I haven't had a beef fajita since and that 
was in July. I liked them before. 
</P>
<P>
"I was also guest grand marshal of a rodeo and wore a cowboy hat," he said. 
"I've got a bunch of those, too. One time, I went redfishing. In New York, you 
tell them that and they think you're looking for Communists." 
</P>
<P>
Here, though, the locals are looking for a few good seasons. If expectations 
are up, so is attendance. Last year, the Longhorns had the biggest increase of 
all Division I schools -- 5,983 a game. Many who probably came to see Penders' 
fast-paced game are convinced there are no longer only two sports at Texas: 
football and spring football. 
</P>
<P>
The Penders style of play is very much unlike that of his predecessor, Bob 
Weltlich, who employed a slowed-down, deliberate pace and who was fired after 
compiling a 77-98 record in six years. In keeping with the surroundings, the 
new Texas style is often called run and gun, but Penders has come up with his 
own name for it -- chuck and duck. 
</P>
<P>
"My idea is to get people back in our building, to create the old feeling they 
had here in the late 1970s with Abe Lemons," Penders said. 
</P>
<P>
Penders' eventual Texasization probably had its roots during the Lemons regime. 
Lemons, a crusty, cigar-smoking, wisecracking proponent of the run-and-gun 
style, coached the Longhorns to the National Invitation Tournament title in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns scored at least 100 points six times that season and were a 
popular draw at the Erwin Center. 
</P>
<P>
Lemons' popularity soared as well. Abe become something of a folk hero and 
alumni flocked to hear him speak. Lemons also used his notoriety to negotiate a 
better car deal for himself and his coaching staff, persuading local automobile 
dealer George Coffey to provide classier cars. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened, everybody was driving (Ford) Granadas and, you know, Texas is a 
big damn state," Lemons said. "It's 950 miles from one tip to the other. You 
get out there on those roads and you need something a little better. I thought, 
'What the hell is going on? I thought Texas people were supposed to be rich or 
something.' 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody asked me, if I could have any car I wanted, what would I drive and I 
said a Lincoln," he said. "Well, I got one. And then everybody else, they're 
all driving Oldsmobiles because Texas, you fight your way around that state in 
a damn Granada, time you get there, hell, you just want to drink. You don't 
want to recruit. I caused all that. 
</P>
<P>
"They're driving Olds, Buicks, but there ain't no more Granadas," Lemons said. 
"There's nothing wrong with a Granada, 'less you're going to Lubbock. There 
ain't nothing but a crow between here and Lubbock. Hitting the damn road, you 
jar your teeth out. You can't get in the damned thing anyway. It's all right 
for a golf coach." 
</P>
<P>
Lemons was riding high until DeLoss Dodds became athletic director. A 
no-nonsense administrator, Dodds was immediately at odds with Lemons' 
freewheeling style. After Lemons charged into the stands at a game to challenge 
some heckling fans in Arkansas in 1982, he was gone. Dodds, believing that 
Lemons had embarrassed the program, fired the coach at the end of the 1982 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I was ever guilty of was cussin' and smokin' cigars," said 
Lemons, back again as coach at Oklahoma City University, whence he came. "I 
caught a lot of flak for a lot of things. I never did take that game that 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
Dodds brought in Weltlich, a coach with whom he felt a shared philosophy. 
Weltlich, a disciple of Bobby Knight, had a style just the opposite of Lemons', 
on the court and off. Where Lemons coached run and gun, Weltlich stressed a 
controlled game. Where Lemons was open and expansive, Weltlich was guarded. 
Lemons' practices always were open, but Weltlich's were closed. 
</P>
<P>
There is certainly enough room in college basketball for two divergent styles, 
but Weltlich's apparently did not appeal to Texas fans. Attendance swooned and 
so did the Longhorns' fortunes. Weltlich's teams never broke 100 points in 175 
games and attendance in the 16,231-seat Erwin Center exceeded 4,500 only once 
in his last five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Dodds was forced to fire his own man with two years and an estimated $200,000 
left on Weltlich's contract. Weltlich was reassigned within the Texas athletic 
department as an assistant athletic director in charge of special projects. 
</P>
<P>
Weltlich was reluctant to discuss his firing or to say in detail what he thinks 
about Penders, who won 25 games with the players Weltlich recruited. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a no-win situation," Weltlich said. "But I do think Tom has done a great 
job with those kids." 
</P>
<P>
Lemons said it is no surprise to him that Penders transformed the Longhorns 
into a winning team. 
</P>
<P>
"All he did was take the same players Weltlich had and put them in another gear 
and have some fun," he said. "I don't think there's any doubt Penders is going 
to win. He's a nice person and he knows what he's doing and he makes the game 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
Said Penders: "In Bob's defense, he was following a legend. He may not have 
been following Darrell Royal in football, but he followed a guy who created a 
lot of excitement here, who was well liked by the fans." 
</P>
<P>
Car dealer Coffey, who ditched the program during the Weltlich regime, jumped 
back on board for Penders, with whom he often plays golf at Barton Creek 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, he wasn't here but a short time and he's walking around in cowboy boots, 
going to barbecues, doing anything to fit in," Coffey said. "And his style of 
basketball, well, it's like his personality. He's a more upbeat guy." 
</P>
<P>
Deathe, who made the boots country singer Paulette Carlson wore for her 
wedding, said Penders' stay at Texas makes him proud of his long association 
with the university. In 1942, Deathe was a Texas freshman teammate of a 
football player named Tom Landry. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between Tom and Bob Weltlich is as much between daylight and 
darkness," Deathe said. "Tom is just a real guy, that's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
Penders, though, understands that winning, not personality, is what the game is 
really all about. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bob had won here, he would have done fine," Penders said. "But in the end, 
he was 20 games under .500. His personality was a lot different from Abe's, 
true, that often happens. A coach gets fired and they go to the other extreme. 
</P>
<P>
"When Bobby Knight leaves Indiana, as successful as Bobby Knight is, there'll 
be somebody in the (school) administration who will say, 'Let's get somebody 
totally different. We'll win here anyway.' Maybe they'll find out the hard way, 
which usually happens." 
</P>
<P>
Penders' journey here was a roundabout one. A basketball and baseball star at 
the University of Connecticut, he was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in 1967 
and played third base in the minor leagues. He hit .343 in Class A, but besides 
having problems hitting double-A pitching, Penders knew that Max Alvis was 
entrenched at third base with the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
His dad was a coach in his hometown of Stratford and Penders eventually got 
into the family business. After three years of high school coaching, he moved 
on to Tufts University in Medford, Mass., near Boston, in 1971. Tufts, which 
had just one winning season in the previous 20 years, finished 12-8. Penders 
was 24. 
</P>
<P>
After two more seasons at Tufts, four at Columbia and eight at Fordham, Penders 
got his big break at Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
In his two seasons there, the Rams went 20-10 and 28-7, the second season 
noteworthy for a spot in the sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament. The team was led 
by guard Tom Garrick, now with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
"I can appreciate now what a great motivator he is," Garrick said. "He is real 
good at bringing the best out of you. He made us believe in ourselves. He would 
scream at you and get under your skin, but he was a friend. You always knew you 
could go to him with anything. 
</P>
<P>
Texas guard Travis Mays said of Penders: "He just said the way we were going to 
approach it is we were going to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Royal said he knew when he met Penders that the Easterner was the right choice. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me his dad was a high school coach and then he told me the stadium his 
dad worked in and coached in was named after him," Royal said. "That told me 
right there he was of good stock. There was surely nothing wrong with his dad. 
I'm a great believer in the apple theory. I don't think they fall too far from 
the tree." 
</P>
<P>
Penders is in the second year of a five-year contract that calls for him to get 
a base salary of $85,000, an annual expense bonus of $6,000 and a 
radio-television contract worth $40,000. A shoe contract negotiated by the 
university is thought to bring the total package to about $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
And the good life is getting better for Penders. He and his family are building 
a 4,000-square-foot home on an acre of land near Lake Austin. Lee Trevino is 
supposed to become a neighbor, but then, sports figures and celebrities always 
seem to be gathering around Penders, who went to a concert a few weeks ago and 
sat with singers Nelson and Kris Kristofferson. 
</P>
<P>
The Southwest Conference looks improved, with Arkansas beginning the season 
ranked in the top 20 and Houston appearing to be a probable tournament team, 
but Lemons figures Penders will get along just fine both on and off the court. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing he'll miss is all the Eastern notoriety those guys get," Lemons 
said. "If a guy can just rest his ego a little bit and not worry about the Big 
East being on TV every day . . . They're on more than 'Sanford and Son.' " 
</P>
<P>
And in the office of the new basketball coach at the University of Texas, the 
Connecticut boy looks around, comfortable in his surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
His silver belt buckle gleams as he hitches up his faded blue jeans, revealing 
his burnt orange cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll stay here for a while," Penders said. 
</P>
<P>
He sort of has to. He's got a golf date with Willie next week.
