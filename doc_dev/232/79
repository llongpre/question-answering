   Commercialization of biomedical research in
American universities is threatening the integrity of scientific
institutions, a congressional panel was told today.
   Sheldon Krimsky, associate professor of urban and environmental
policy at Tufts University, testified before the human resources
sucommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations.
   ``There have been changes in the social norms and values of
biomedical scientists and their academic institutions,'' Krimsky
said. ``I believe some of these changes are detrimental to the
general well-being of basic science and to the public interest.''
   ``Biomedical science has been intensely commercialized within
universities over a relatively short period of time,'' he said. ``I
have heard it said within the scientific community that everyone
gains from this marriage of academia and commerce. Nothing can be
further from the truth.
   ``Not only are there losses, but some of these losses threaten
the integrity of our scientific institutions and weaken public
confidence in science.''
   He called for disclosure of financial interests related to
research being conducted by scientists applying for grants.
   David Noble, a professor of history at Drexel University and a
founding member of the National Coalition for Universities in the
Public Interest, said universy researchers ``are free to make
undisclosed arrangements with private corporations in which they
often have equally undisclosed personal roles.''
   ``They are free to shape and profit from the public investment in
research and many have done so,'' he said.
   Noble said collaboration between universities and industries may
be useful but should be accompanied by ``proper disclosure and
procedural safeguards.''
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee, said, ``I
am sure that many Americans will be justifiably outraged by some of
the ways that federally funded scientific data are being sold, or
manipulated for personal gain.''
   Rep. Larkin Smith of Mississippi, the ranking Republican member
of the panel, said Congress should ``send a strong signal to the
research community that scientific misconduct will not be
tolerated.''
   At the same time, he said, ``A careful balance must be struck
between avoiding conflicts of interest and achieving scientific
breakthroughs that ultimately could benefit millions. We should not
allow limited or individual cases of misconduct to stand in the way
of overall progress.''
