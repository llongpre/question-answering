   Here is a sketch of Education Secretary Lauro
F. Cavazos, who has been asked to retain that post in George Bush's
administration:
   AGE: 61.
   EDUCATION: He earned a bachelor's degree in zoology and a
master's degree in cytology at Texas Tech before getting a doctorate
in physiology from Iowa State University in 1954.
   JOB HISTORY AND BACKGROUND: Cavazos first taught as an instructor
of anatomy, and later as an associate professor, at the Medical
College of Virginia in Richmond. Later, he was dean of the school of
medicine at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., before becoming in
1980 the first alumnus of Texas Tech to be named president. At Texas
Tech, he paid special attention to minority education, and during
his tenure Hispanic enrollment increased. He received the National
Hispanic Leadership award of the League of United Latin American
Citizens in July for his efforts to reduce the dropout rate among
Hispanic youth.
   Cavazos announced in May that he would resign as president in
July 1989 and after a leave return to teach anatomy in the medical
school, where he has tenure. In September, he succeeded William J.
Bennett as education secretary.
   A Democrat, Cavazos publicly disagreed with the Reagan
administration's cuts in student loan programs.
