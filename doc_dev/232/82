This splendid autumn flowering gentian from China and Tibet sets a high
standard of beauty with its large, azure-blue trumpets standing up on
carpets of narrow shining green leaves. It can be grown most easily in beds
of peat that contain absolutely no lime.  It requires plenty of moisture
and, unlike most alpine plants, benefits from replanting each March or April
when it is just starting in to growth and tufts can be pulled out of the old
beds with white roots attached. These tufts should establish themselves
rapidly in moist peat in an open, sunny place. They must not be allowed to
get dry which is one reason why it is easier to grow them in a deep bed of
peat rather than in a pot.
