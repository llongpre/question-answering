   Sudden reforms in the Eastern bloc have historians
scrambling to replace old assumptions that are being eradicated as
quickly as sections of the Berlin Wall.
   History books already need updating to reflect last week's
stunning events in East Germany, and academics and their students
watch as each day's headlines make the previous day's reading
assignment obsolete.
   ``The rules are changing by the hour,'' Professor Carol Saivetz
of Harvard University's Russian Research Center said Monday. ``No
one is writing and no one is willing to commit themselves because
once you write a book it's out of date.''
   The East German government shocked the world, including many of
those who study the region's politics, with its announcement last
week that citizens were free to travel to the West.
   Suddenly the 28-year-old Berlin Wall, that ultimate Cold War
symbol, was being dismantled. The old Iron Curtain mentality that
permeates today's books on modern European history _ already
undercut by the thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations and other East bloc
reforms _ suffered a staggering blow.
   ``We're all sort of grappling with what to do next and how to
approach this area of the world that we've been teaching about for
years given the fast-paced changes that are going on,'' said
Saivetz, who also teaches political science at Tufts University.
   Edwin Gere, a historian at the University of Massachusetts in
Amherst, said his lesson plans were jolted this semester by the
events in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary.
   ``Talk about changing the class curriculum,'' Gere said. ``We
were going to talk in the coming weeks about whether the wall would
ever come down. My God, we never had a chance to get to it.''
   The changes sweeping the region will affect cultural, political
and economic relationships with the West, academics said.
   ``It was almost inevitable that all these East European
communist regimes would explode one way or another,'' said Adam
Ulam, director of Harvard's Russian Research Center. ``But this has
been spectacular.''
   ``Different events have piled one on top of another with a
suddenness no one anticipated,'' said Boston University Professor
Walter D. Connor.
   He said, however, change in the Eastern bloc was inevitable
given domestic dissatisfaction and Soviet Premier Mikhail
Gorbachev's reforms.
   William Parker, a professor emeritus of economic history at Yale
University, said, ``It's too soon to know what eventually will
happen with such a free-floating situation.''
   But he predicted the Eastern bloc countries would now be a
factor in 1992, when Western European nations plan to drop their
trade barriers.
   ``It's conceivable that all those countries would float into a
common European market,'' Parker suggested.
   Philippe Schmitter, director of the Center for European Studies
at Stanford University, said that recent events would be
interpreted not just as a major step toward German re-unification
but also as part of Europe's unification.
   ``As of six months ago, the only thing my students were talking
about was 1992,'' Schmitter said, referring to the trade agreement.
``Now all of a sudden we have have to think about a whole new set
of combinations.''
