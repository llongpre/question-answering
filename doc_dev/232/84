   The doctor who first identified Lyme disease 15
years ago says doctors are overdiagnosing the tick-borne illness.
   ``It's being used to cause a number of conditions it is not
causing,'' Dr. Allen Steere of the Tufts University School of
Medicine said Monday.
   The bacterial disease, which causes a distinctive bulls-eye
rash, fever and arthritis and is carried by tiny ticks that are
often found on deer, is being blamed for conditions ranging from
chronic fatigue to stress, Steere said.
   The danger, he said at the Interscience Conference on
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, occurs when misdiagnosed
patients are put on antibiotics for up to two years and run the
risk of complications from the drugs.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported 7,402 cases of
Lyme disease in the United States in 1989, up from 4,574 in 1988.
   No one's quite sure exactly how many of the reported cases are
not properly diagnosed or how many actual cases never get reported,
Steere said.
   ``But the idea that thousands of cases (misdiagnosed as Lyme
disease) are occurring each year - I think that's in the ballpark
of what we're dealing with,'' he said.
   Steere was at Yale University when he identified the first cases
of Lyme disease in 1975 in patients from Old Lyme, Conn.
