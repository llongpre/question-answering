   The White House today defended its threat to
veto a bill guaranteeing unpaid leave for workers with family
emergencies, saying that requiring the benefits could drive up
unemployment.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush urges
companies to provide paid parental leaves voluntarily, but he is
unwilling to force them to do it.
   Fitzwater defended the adminstration's stance amid criticism
from the measure's sponsor that it is a rebuff to working families.
   ``It would be most unfortunate if my party, which so strongly
supports family values, were to turn its back on working families,
women, children, grandma and grandpa,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema,
R-N.J.
   At one point in his daily news briefing Fitzwater suggested that
workers ``look for other jobs'' if they or their unions could not
negotiate parental leave with their employer.
   He later backed off that suggestion, saying, ``The high priority
is to make work and family complementary. ... We urge all employers
to find sensitive and flexible leave policies, but the government
should not dictate it.''
   ``These are the kinds of rigidity that cause companies to not be
able to hire people, and cause greater levels of unemployment,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``It's at the point at which it becomes mandatory that we say
the negative risks outweigh the benefits,'' he said.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu assured business leaders
in a private meeting Monday that Bush would veto the family and
medical leave bill scheduled for House action Wednesday. His threat
was recounted by business lobbyists who attended the session and
was confirmed by a Sununu aide who asked not to be identified by
name.
   The bill has bipartisan support but is opposed by business
groups. It requires employers with 50 or more workers to offer
unpaid time off with job and benefit protection for the care of
newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children, as well as to
deal with personal health problems or ill spouses or parents.
   Roukema, the chief Republican sponsor, called the veto threat
``a complete surprise.'' She earlier had urged the White House to
avoid veto threats or ``rash statements.''
   ``It's a job security issue for working families,'' Roukema said.
   The bill's Democratic sponsors denounced the veto threat and
said the move would be at odds with Bush's 1988 campaign support
for family values.
   ``I can't believe the kinder, gentler president is going to veto
it,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   She said Sununu took leave from his job as a professor at Tufts
University while he served as governor of New Hampshire _ and kept
job benefits from the university.
   ``Sununu took family leave himself, and I think he has a lot of
nerve,'' Mrs. Schroeder said.
   Mary Tavenner, a lobbyist for the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors, said businesses opposed the measure
because of its cost and contended that many employers already offer
better benefits.
   ``There's only so many things an employer can offer,'' she said.
   Tavenner and Christine Russell, lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, were among the business representatives invited to the
White House meeting. Although there have been proposals to change
the length of guaranteed leave, they quoted Sununu as saying Bush
would veto any period that was required by law.
   ``He basically said the president would veto anything that is a
mandated benefit,'' Tavenner said.
   Under the House bill, employers would have to offer up to 10
weeks of unpaid family leave over a two-year period, and up to 15
weeks in one year for a sick worker.
   An employee returning from leave must be restored to his or her
previous job or an equivalent position, and employers would have to
continue health insurance benefits for those on leave.
   Federal workers would have the same guarantees with a longer
unpaid leave: 18 weeks for family leave over two years and 27 weeks
a year for medical leave.
