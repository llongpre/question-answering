   Police defused a bomb today planted under a
lectern that a government minister, London's police chief and top
British and American experts were to use while addressing an
international conference on terrorism.
   Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's
Anti-Terrorist Squad, said the device contained enough explosives
to cause death and injury and was probably planted by the Irish
Republican Army. No group claimed responsibility for the bomb.
   The plastic lunch box containing the bomb was discovered by
security guards as delegates arrived for the conference at the
Royal Overseas League building on Park Place near Piccadilly in
central London, police and conference organizers said.
   The conference was postponed as police searched for a possible
second device, said Frank Brenchley, chairman of the Research
Institute for the Study of Confict and Terrorism. The institute
organized the conference.
   Scheduled speakers at the one-day conference included Foreign
Office Minister William Waldegrave, Metropolitan Police
Commissioner Sir Peter Imbert and Professor Richard Shultz, of
Tufts University in Boston.
   Churchill-Coleman told a news conference he didn't believe the
device was aimed at a particular individual.
   ``The target of the device was the conference,'' he said. ``The
conference, which was widely advertised, would be seen as a
legitimate target by Irish Republican terrorist groups.''
   The IRA has targeted government officials and security forces in
its fight to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   Churchill-Coleman said the lunch box ``contained a sufficient
high explosive that had the device exploded, which we believe would
have been around 10:30 a.m., it would have caused death and serious
injury.''
   He appealed for information on anyone seen in the area and
warned potential IRA targets: ``If you want to live, you must
continue to look and keep on looking.''
   Joan Bates, spokeswoman for the Research Institute for the Study
of Confict and Terrorism, said the package had been found
underneath the lectern where speakers would have been.
   All other buildings on Park Place were also evacuated and the
streets sealed off by police.
   Professor Paul Wilkinson of the University of St. Andrews in
Scotland, who is the institute's director and a leading British
expert on anti-terrorism, said ``extremely thorough'' security
arrangements had been made for the conference.
   ``An incident like this does remind you of the need for
alertness at all times and the professionalism and courage of those
whose daily duty it is to deal with emergencies of this sort,'' he
said.
   ``When you are studying a subject, you recognize there is a
constant problem and a large number of groups use this sort of
weapon. That is why it is important to study it and ways of
combating the threat more effectively.''
