How a buy-out has helped a carpet company

A CARPET company doing well in 1993 must have had its share of good fortune
as well as good management. Carpet-making remains one of the last vestiges
of unreconstructed industrial Victoriana left in Britain.
For decades, output in this fragmented business has been hit by cheap
imports from bigger and more efficient competitors and by restrictive
domestic labour practices. More recently, the steep decline in house
purchases - accounting for 35 per cent of the carpet market in 1988 - has
increased the industry's woes.
One of the survivors is Bradford-based Kosset Carpets. Its luck came in the
shape of a bargain-basement purchase from the receiver in 1989 of the name
and assets of Mr John Ashcroft's failed Coloroll empire - Kosset was a
wholly-owned subsidiary.
'We paid Pounds 10m for Pounds 20m of assets,' says Mr John Parker, 43,
Kosset's chairman who ran the business under Coloroll and led the buy-out.
The management skills employed since seem equally simple.
'Our number one priority is cash management,' he says.
The combination has borne fruit. Operating profit rose from Pounds 1.4m in
the first year of operation after the buy-out to Pounds 1.8m in the second
year and Pounds 2.5m in the current year. The interest charge this year is
about Pounds 1.5m and there is positive cash flow for the first time, Mr
Parker says.
Several measures were taken to manage cash through cost control. Kosset
subcontracted its energy management to BP, saving Pounds 100,000 over two
years. It computerised part of its manufacturing process to cut waste, raise
quality and reduce raw material stocks. The result was a margin improvement
of more than one percentage point.
Customers used to complain that telephone lines to the company were
sometimes engaged. Rather than take on more staff, the company paid Pounds
60,000 for a new switchboard with functions such as call-queueing. Now it
can handle twice as many calls with the same staffing.
The company has improved productivity by moving workers quickly between
jobs. An agreement with the TGWU general union has allowed workers to do
more than one job. Half are now multi-skilled and can be switched between
woven carpets, tufted carpets and warehousing when necessary. Under
Coloroll, the three divisions were treated as independent.
Management's attention to detail is in sharp contrast to the Coloroll
regime. 'The only thing Ashcroft told us to do was 'Kill the cat',' says Mr
Parker, referring to Kosset's familiar Persian cat logo.
The buy-out managers saved the cat and followed a conservative marketing
strategy. Mr Parker and his three fellow directors decided not to follow
competitors down market as the recession took hold. This avoided some of the
most fiercely competitive price points but put sales volume at risk.
The strategy seems to have worked. By concentrating limited management time
on selling mid-priced and expensive carpets, turnover has risen from Pounds
42m in 1990 to a projected Pounds 55m-plus in the current year.
The mid-priced ranges of tufted carpets account for almost 90 per cent of
sales by value. Tufted carpets are made by sewing nylon yarn into a nylon
mesh. The result is hard-wearing but limited to simple patterns and few
colours. They cost between Pounds 9 and Pounds 20 a square yard  - Kosset's
biggest customers include Home Office prisons and libraries.
Carpets that cost more than Pounds 20 a square yard are woven rather than
sewn. The number and quality of colours and complexity of pattern is higher,
but the machinery is slower - productivity is only a sixth of tufted
carpets.
High-margins nevertheless exist for woven carpets - at Pounds 60 a square
yard, the Sultana range is exported to Japan, and the company has just won a
royal warrant.
Kosset's progress has not been without stumbles and errors. The first came
just weeks after the buy-out when Kosset's biggest customer, the furniture
retailer Lowndes Queensway, collapsed. Then in January 1991 management
judged the end of the recession in sight and recruited more than 70 workers.
In April 1992, when recovery seemed as distant as ever, it made 42
redundant.
Kosset has survived on management wits and luck. Mr Parker, emboldened by
comparative success, already plans to raise the profile of the company - the
cat, confined to point-of-sale promotions, could eventually return to the
television screen.
