   Certainly Sol Gittleman, provost of Tufts University, jests in his Feb. 5 letter "Filigreed Dust Jackets?" in which he implies that rising college costs are caused by libraries. 

   Does Mr. Gittleman suggest that libraries not purchase books as a way to reduce college costs? 
That might reduce the library budget, but would do little to reduce the cost of a college education. 
Would it lower the cost of books? 
Again, no. 

   The 12,000 members of the Special Libraries Association are concerned about the rising costs of both books and journals. 
The truth of the matter is that the $39.95 book referred to by Mr. Gittleman has a price established by the publisher, not the library. 
That seems to be his point -- that book prices are increasing. 

   Mr. Gittleman is correct in his observation that book costs are rising. 
They are! 
He errs in his assertion that libraries are the reason for college costs rising faster than the cost of living.
