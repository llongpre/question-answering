   Top officials of Tufts University and MIT
insist they did not whitewash their findings when they investigated
a scientist's challenge of a colleague's article in a scientific
journal.
   The university officials said Tuesday that review panels took
seriously the complaint of former Massachusetts Institute of
Technology researcher Margot O'Toole but believed she overstated
deficiencies in the article.
   Ms. O'Toole told the House Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee she lost her job at MIT and her reputation was smeared
after she complained to both universities about the article
published in the journal Cell in April 1986.
   She testified that those who reviewed her complaint from the two
schools later accused her of stealing data, lying, refusing to
accept alternative interpretations and being unable to distinguish
between important and trivial issues.
   The article dealt with the immune responses of mice bred with an
extra immune system gene from another species. Ms. O'Toole
attempted to show the conclusions of the paper were not supported
by the original laboratory data.
   One of the authors was Thereza Imanishi-Kari, who is now on the
faculty of Tufts but in 1986 was in charge of the MIT laboratory
where Ms. O'Toole worked.
   John Deutch, provost of MIT, told the subcommittee that
reviewers found that O'Toole was correct in contending there was an
error in the article, but decided it was not flagrant and a
correction was not warranted.
   ``At the conclusion of the review, I concurred in the judgment
that the issues raised did not imply misconduct ...'' Deutch said.
``Any suggestion of misconduct in ... research is viewed with
concern.
   ``Our self-interest in our reputation as a leading research
university required that the integrity of our research be our first
priority.''
   Henry Wortis, a pathology professor at Tufts and one of those
who reviewed the challenge, said investigations at his school, MIT
and the National Institutes of Health found ``the original
conclusions of the paper are legitimate. I stress this point: the
conclusions are correct.''
   Wortis also criticized the committee probe as ``yet another
inquiry, this time by non-scientists into the same matter.''
   Ms. O'Toole said, ``I challenged the paper because it
represented evidence that simply did not exist, period. This is not
a complicated concept. It is one thing to believe that something is
true. It is another to present experimental evidence in support of
the claim.''
   A review panel convened by NIH said that although there was no
fraud or misrepresentation, errors had occurred that should be
corrected. The NIH investigation was reopened after two members of
the review panel were replaced when it was revealed they had ties
to one of the authors.
   A report from Secret Service experts said at least five and
possibly 25 pages in one of Ms. Imanishi-Kari's notebooks were
filled in as much as two years after the dates on the page, and at
least two dates were changed.
   Ms. O'Toole told the subcommittee she was forced to take a job
outside the field of science because of her challenge. She said she
learned that high-level Tufts administrators were told she made a
charge of fraud without justification, when it fact she had not
charged the article was fraudulent.
   She said she heard the MIT faculty was ``accusing me of
`purloining' or stealing laboratory notes. I had never done such a
thing, but I have since confirmed that this is how they described
my attempts to behave in a professionally responsible manner.'`
