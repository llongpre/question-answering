   White House chief of staff John Sununu had
assets and income together last year of between $530,000 and $1.1
million, including a ski condominium, a residential lot next to his
New Hampshire home and a stake in an insurance agency, according to
a financial disclosure report.
   The document also said Sununu has decided to give up tuition
benefits from Tufts University for his children. Sununu has been on
leave from the school since 1982, and last year received $5,500 in
assistance.
   The law requires senior government officials to reveal their
assets, liabilities and sources of income. It does not require them
to list exact amounts but rather to report values within a range of
money, such as $15,000 to $50,000 and $100,000 to $250,000.
   The top category is anything over $250,000.
   Sununu's holdings are largely in real estate.
   He owns a condominium in Cambridge, Vt., and a residential lot
adjacent to his home in Salem, N.H., and each is valued at between
$100,000 to $250,000. He earned between $15,000 to $50,000 in
condominium rental fees last year.
   The report does not require the listing of a personal residence.
In addition to his home in Salem, Sununu recently bought a home
outside Washington in Fairfax County, Va.
   Other major assets include a 40 percent ownership, valued at
between $100,000 and $250,000 in Lakeside Insurance Agency Inc. It
is listed under the name of his wife, Nancy.
   Sununu also said he had a college retirement and equities fund
worth $100,000 to $250,000 and a Keough retirement account valued at
between $15,000 and $50,000. He listed three bank accounts worth
between $17,000 and $60,000.
   He received $7,000 in speaking fees last year and was paid
$69,103 as governor of New Hampshire.
   In other financial filings:
   _Charles G. Untermeyer, White House personnel director, listed
assets including investments, partnerships and oil and gas holdings
totaling between $155,000 and $420,000.
   His single biggest asset was a Prudential-Bache high-yield fund,
made up of a wide range of corporate bonds. He valued his holdings
in the fund at $100,000 to $250,000 and said it yielded between
$5,000 and $15,000 in 1988 income.
   Untermeyer also listed $1,800 for an article for the Texas
Monthly magazine, $800 for ``three travel stories'' for the Arkansas
Democrat, and $520 for an article for the Naval Institute in
Annapolis, Md.
   _Andrew Card, deputy chief of staff, listed a two-family
apartment in Holbrook, Mass., as his major asset, checking the
category between $100,000 and $250,000.
   He said he earned between $5,000 and $15,000 in rental income
from the apartment last year.
   Card listed $5,262 in pay from the Bush transition office and a
$6,000 a month salary as a consultant for the Bush presidential
campaign, from March 1987 to the Republican National Convention in
August.
   After that, he was paid $2,000 a month as a consultant for the
Bush-Quayle campaign _ but drew another $5,000 a month as a
consultant for the Republican National Committee from the convention
through Bush's inauguration.
   Card listed his assets as between $115,000 and $305,000.
   _Robert M. Gates, deputy CIA director, by contrast, showed few
assets _ a savings account worth between $1,000 and $5,000 and two
Individual Retirement Accounts worth from $15,000 to $50,000 apiece,
one for himself and one for his wife.
   _David Q. Bates, secretary to the Cabinet, listed assets of
$29,000 to $100,000.
   _Frederick McClure, assistant to the president, listed $30,000 to
$100,000 in assets and reported that he was paid a salary of
$132,770 in 1988 as an executive with Texas Air Corp.
   _Jane E. Newman, assistant to the president for operations,
reported salaries from 1988 of $105,000 from the New England
Council, a non-profit regional business association of which she was
president, and $47,359 from the Business and Industry Association of
New Hampshire, a trade group that she headed.
