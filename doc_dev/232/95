   The government paid private law firms almost $300 million
last year for work related to failed thrifts and banks,
according to figures released by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   But total legal fees for the year may exceed $600 million
when the government tallies fees paid by thrifts in
conservatorship as well as legal bills covered by agreements
with certain banks and thrifts, according to a senior FDIC
attorney who asked not to be identified.

   The attorney said that FDIC's preliminary estimates show
that legal fees for 1991 could reach $750 million as more
banks and thrifts succumb to recession and real estate loan
woes.
   Last year's legal fees covered a wide range of matters for
failed banks and thrifts, ranging from high-profile suits
against former officers to mundane tasks, such as clearance
of titles to repossessed real estate.
   The FDIC is also picking up the tab for certain legal work
on behalf of such regional banking giants as NCNB Corp. and
Banc One Corp., which entered into government-assistance
agreements when they acquired failed bank holding companies.
   Some of the fees paid in 1990 were for law firms' work in
previous years. Fees also covered legal work that the FDIC
inherited from the defunct Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance
Corp. The FSLIC paid private lawyers more than $102 million
in 1989.
   Still, the FDIC's legal bills are clearly growing. And the
agency recently has formed task forces and a new section of
its in-house legal department to study ways to reduce fees.
   The agency is also expected to start spreading its legal
work among more law firms. Under a draft of a policy
currently being considered, the FDIC would require approval
from its top management for any new legal assignments to a
law firm that had racked up $2 million in fees, according to
FDIC assistant general counsel James Lantelme.
   That policy would break up the current concentration of
work among relatively few firms. Although the FDIC has
approved 955 law firms to handle work, most receive little or
none. Last year, 21 law firms each received fees totalling $2
million or more; of those, 10 firms each received $4 million
or more. The top 10 firms were paid a total of almost $90
million, or about 30% of all fees paid for work at
government-controlled financial institutions.
   The highest-paid law firm, Hopkins &amp; Sutter, received
almost $21.7 million last year. Robert Patterson, a senior
trial attorney at the Chicago-based firm, said the firm has
represented the government in thrift-related cases for 25
years, concentrating on the liability of directors, officers
and professional advisers.
   Because of its long relationship with the government,
Hopkins &amp; Sutter isn't expected to suffer under any new FDIC
policy for spreading the wealth. But many other law firms,
such as 80-lawyer Jackson, Tufts, Cole &amp; Black in San
Francisco, are at risk.
   Jackson Tufts was paid $6.6 million last year for
litigating claims against former officers of the failed
Eureka Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of San Carlos,
Calif. The law firm's managing partner, Kenneth Philpot, said
Jackson Tufts won a settlement of $70 million for the FDIC
last August.
   "The (FDIC) people we worked with in Washington said that
once the case was over, we shouldn't expect more work because
so much money had come our way," Mr. Philpot said. "It looks
like (law firms are paid) a lot of taxpayer money, but in the
context of big corporate litigation these days, it's not
much."
