<TEXT>     Dr. Armbruster was a former director of preventive medicine at Palo Alto
Medical Clinic and had lived in the Menlo Park and Atherton area during the
1960s and 1970s.;    As a physician, Dr. Armbruster had a particular concern
for children in Third World countries, said his son-in-law, Duane Maidens of
Menlo Park.;    "He had worked for a long time to try to come up with a
preventative medicine to save children," Maidens said. "So many children die
of dehydration, and he was working with the World Health Organization to
develop a serum to prevent that.";    He had planned to do research on the
serum at Stanford University.;    Dr. Armbruster graduated from Tufts
University and Northwestern University Medical School. He also received a
Master of Science degree in environmental health from University of Cincinnati
Medical School.;    He is survived by his wife of 34 years, Barbara R.
Armbruster of Vacaville; his two daughters born in Saudi Arabia, Michele G.
