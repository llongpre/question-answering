   Two billionaire families were joined in
matrimony in a union that one relative joked had to be approved by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Laura S. Steinberg, 25, and Jonathan M. Tisch, 34, were married
Monday at the Central Synagogue. The reception, attended by more
than 500, was held in Great Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   Mrs. Tisch is the daughter of Barbara and Saul P. Steinberg,
chairman and chief executive of Reliance Group Holdings Inc. The
bride's parents are divorced. Her stepmother is Gayfryd Steinberg.
   Tisch, president of Loews Hotels, is the son of Joan and Preston
Robert Tisch, president and co-chief executive officer of the Loews
Corp. and former U.S. Postmaster General.
   Steinberg and Tisch family members are major stock market
investors.
   The bridegroom's uncle, Laurence A. Tisch, is chairman of CBS.
At the bridal couple's engagement party last year, a member of the
Tisch family said, ``If they get married, it will have to be
cleared by the SEC.''
   It was a styish wedding, with a white-on-white bridal party of
26. The bride's dress, of off-white taffeta, with a 7-foot train,
was designed by Arnold Scaasi.
   The ceremony was performed by Rabbi Stanley Davis, senior rabbi
of the synagogue, under a canopy fashioned of bronze palms from
Steinberg's collection of antiquities.
   Among the guests passing through the receiving line were author
Norman Mailer, singer Beverly Sills, and Donald and Ivana Trump.
   The bride's mother said her daughter and son-in-law began dating
about three years ago. ``It just clicked,'' she said. ``I hope they
will always be as happy as they are today.''
   The bride, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, has a
Master's of Business Administration from New York University. Until
recently, she worked as a story analyst for Warner Bros. in New
York. The bridegroom graduated from Tufts University.
