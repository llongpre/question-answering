   The Duchess of York gave birth to a 7-pound,
1{-ounce daughter by Caesarean section Friday night, and mother and
child are both well, Portland Hospital announced.
   It was the second child and second girl for the 30-year-old
duchess and her husband Prince Andrew, and is the sixth grandchild
of Queen Elizabeth II.
   The new baby, daughter of the queen's second son, is sixth in
line to the British throne after her sister, Princess Beatrice of
York, who was born Aug. 8, 1988.
   Andrew was present at the delivery at 7:58 p.m. (2:58 p.m. EST),
the hospital statement said.
   The Caesarean section was carried out because the baby was in a
breech position, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. ``It was the
wrong way round,'' he said.
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, had spent the last week
at Buckingham Palace in London instead of her country home. She
arrived at the London hospital nearly four hours earlier in a
chauffeur-driven car and entered through a side entrance, avoiding
photographers waiting at the front.
   Her husband joined her two hours later after driving the 150
miles from Devonport naval dockyard, where he is based as a flight
commander on the Royal Navy frigate Campbeltown.
   As tradition dictates, a notice was posted on the railings at
Buckingham Palace giving news of the birth.
   It read: ``Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York was safely
delivered of a daughter at 7:58 p.m. today. Her Royal Highness and
her child are well.''
   The birth was greeted by cheering and the cracking of champagne
corks by a small crowd of well-wishers outside the hospital.
   The Duchess of York's father, Maj. Ronald Ferguson, said at his
home at Dummer, a village 53 miles southwest of London: ``I am
delighted for the mother and daughter.''
   For Beatrice's birth, the duchess was admitted shortly after 10
a.m. and gave birth at 8:18 p.m.
   No name was announced immediately for the new baby, but she will
be known as Her Royal Highness, Princess (baby's name) of York.
   Andrew's elder brother Prince Charles, 41, is first in line to
the throne, followed by his sons Prince William and Prince Harry of
Wales. Then comes Andrew, 30, then Beatrice.
   The queen's unmarried youngest son, Edward, 26, is now seventh
in line of succession. Her 39-year-old daughter Anne, the Princess
Royal, is eighth and has a son and daughter, Peter and Zara, who
are ninth and tenth.
   The duke's ship has returned to Britain after exercises and is
to remain in home waters until July. The queen went to Windsor
Castle, 21 miles west of London, for the weekend and has been
notified of the birth.
