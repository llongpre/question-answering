   The delay while Prince Andrew and his wife Sarah
decided what to call their baby daughter had commemorative mug
makers tense, bookmakers in a lather and newspapers in a fever of
speculation today.
   The Times of London said bookmakers offered short odds on
Annabel and Victoria. It said Victoria was more likely because of
Queen Victoria.
   Andrew, the Duke of York, reportedly said several months ago
that Annabel was his own choice for a baby girl.
   Mike Raper, an executive at bookmakers William Hill, said
oddsmakers at one stage had taken bets at 3-1 on Annabel as the
favorite but had stopped.
   ``If it is Annabel, we will have to pay out thousands and
thousands of pounds,'' he said.
   Wally Pyrah of Coral Bookmakers said Charlotte was also strongly
favored.
   ``Charlotte ... has seen the odds tumble from 14-1 to 6-4
favorite. I hope that doesn't mean that everyone knows before us,''
he said.
   ``The second favorite (among Coral gamblers) is Victoria at 5-2
followed by two very popular names, Annabel and Elizabeth, at
4-1,'' Pyrah added.
   Frank Martin, managing director of the ceramics division of the
wallpaper and home products group Coloroll, said he had 10,000
commemorative mugs waiting to be rushed to stores.
   Blank spaces were left on the mugs for the name. ``We have the
artwork all ready to go. As soon as we know the baby's name we can
rush them out within 24 hours,'' he said.
   The Times said another name being tipped was Elizabeth, after
Queen Elizabeth I and the present queen, Elizabeth II.
   It said a wild outsider was Francesca, after Sir Francis Drake.
   The Daily Telegraph reported: ``Elizabeth and Victoria are
thought to be public favorites but Mary, Margaret, Harriet and
Louisa are also tipped as likely names.''
   Andrew, 28, told crowds outside London's Portland Hospital on
Tuesday after visiting his 28-year-old wife and baby daughter: ``We
have a few ideas but we haven't chosen a name yet.''
   Mothercare, a big retail chain specializing in maternity and
baby clothes, has introduced a Grand Old Duke of York design for
crib bedding and other items to mark the royal birth. The Grand Old
Duke of York referred to was Queen Victoria's uncle Frederick, who
became a nursery rhyme figure when, on a whim, he marched 10,000
soldiers up a hill one day and then down again.
   Baby food makers Cow and Gate marked the occasion by producing
give-away mobiles to hang over cribs consisting of a crown, a
plane, a palace, a cow and a gate.
