   The Duchess of York gave birth Monday to a
daughter, the first child for her and husband Prince Andrew and
fifth in line to the British throne, Buckingham Palace announced.
   The child, who weighed six pounds, 12 ounces, and the mother,
the former Sarah Ferguson, are doing well, the palace said.
   Andrew, Duke of York and second son of Queen Elizabeth II, was
with his wife when she was ``safely delivered of a daughter at 8:18
p.m. (3:18 p.m. EDT) today,'' the palace said.
   In May, Andrew was quoted as saying the child would be named
Annabel.
   ``All members of the royal family are very pleased with the
news,'' a palace spokesman said later. He was not identified, in
keeping with British custom.
   An official notice including the statement was posted on the
gates of Buckingham Palace, also in keeping with royal family
custom, to the cheers of a waiting crowd.
   Dr. Barry Lewis, the family pediatrician, said as he left the
hospital: ``The atmosphere inside was very cheerful. Everyone is
delighted.''
   Town crier Peter Moore, dressed in a red tunic and swinging a
brass hand bell, opened bottles of champagne and announced the
birth to crowds of reporters and members of the public waiting
outside the hospital.
   Andrew left the hospital hours after his daughter's birth,
smiling broadly and waving to the well-wishers as got into a car
and drove away slowly.
   Maj. Ronald Ferguson, father of the duchess, said at his country
home that he was ``absolutely thrilled'' and added: ``If they've
chosen a name, I'm not aware of it.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her husband, Denis,
visiting Bangkok, Thailand, sent congratulations: ``It is wonderful
news and your happiness will be shared by the whole nation.''
   The baby's birth at 18 minutes past 8 p.m. on the eighth day of
the eighth month of 1988 is being taken by well-wishers as a sign
of good fortune. The day is considered highly auspicious by
Cantonese-speaking Chinese, whose word for eight is similar to that
for prosperity.
   Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant who returned on Sunday from sea
duty in Singapore to be with his 28-year-old wife, had driven her
to the rear entrance of Portland Hospital from their rented home 21
miles west of London Monday morning.
   The prince, also 28, looked nervous and anxious as left the
hospital after 1{ hours, only to return later _ still looking
worried. The duchess' mother, Susan Barrantes, also joined her at
the hospital, smiling and looking relaxed.
   ``Any Moment Now!'' proclaimed a banner hanging outside the
hospital, where crowds gathered to await the birth of the queen's
fifth grandchild.
   Dozens of photographers who have spent weeks camped outside the
hospital's main entrance missed the arrival of the red-haired
duchess, and the few at the back entrance just caught a glimpse of
her as the car raced by.
   The queen, who was opening a new soap plant at Port Sunlight on
the Wirral in northwest England, joked that the baby was taking a
long time to arrive.
   ``We hope it is soon. We are fed up with waiting,'' she told
young mother Heidi Courtney during a tour of the plant.
   Mrs. Courtney's 22-month-old, curly haired daughter, Carla,
handed a teddy bear to the queen, who said: ``If it is a little
girl, I hope my grandchild has curly hair like this.''
   The baby will be Her Royal Highness, Princess of York. She is
fifth in line to the throne behind Andrew's older brother, Prince
Charles, his two children, Prince William and Prince Harry, and
Andrew himself. The queen's two other grandchildren, Peter and Zara
Phillips, are the children of her only daughter, Anne.
   Millions of TV viewers around the world watched the July 23,
1986, Westminster Abbey wedding of the handsome prince and the
vivacious young working woman he had known since childhood.
   The duchess chose Dr. Anthony Kenney as her obstetrician rather
than the queen's gynecologist, Dr. George Pinker, who has delivered
all royal babies for the past 10 years.
   The duchess also broke tradition by choosing the modern 86-bed
Portland Hospital, which costs $588 a day and is privately owned by
American Medical International. Sarah's sisters-in-law, Anne and
the Princess of Wales, used the private wing of St. Mary's Hospital
in Paddington, a hospital of the government-funded National Health
Service.
   The day after the duchess' pregnancy was announced Jan. 25, she
celebrated by flying a helicopter from a Royal Air Force base in
Oxfordshire.
   The rest of her pregnancy was action-packed, including three
skiing trips. She suffered a fall while on the slopes at Klosters
when she was four months pregnant. On July 8, she escaped injury
when her car collided with an oncoming car on a highway 20 miles
outside London.
