<HEAD>Princess Beatrice To Be Christened Dec. 20</HEAD>

   Princess Beatrice, the 3-month-old daughter of the
Duke and Duchess of York, will be christened by the Archbishop of
York on Dec. 20, Buckingham Palace said Monday.
   The christening will take place in the historic Chapel Royal in
London's St. James's Palace, where Queen Victoria and Prince Albert
were married in 1840 and where royal christenings occasionally have
taken place.
   Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, fifth in line to the throne and
the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, will wear the royal
family's christening robe of Honiton lace and will be baptized at
the silver gilt Lily Font, the palace said.
   The font was made for the christening in 1840 of Princess
Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria, and it has been used
to baptize Queen Elizabeth's four children and grandchildren. The
christening robe has been worn by all royal babies since the baptism
of Victoria's eldest son, Prince Albert Edward, in 1842.
   The christening will take place shortly after the princess'
father, Prince Andrew, returns to Britain. A Royal Navy lieutenant,
he is serving on board the destroyer Edinburgh which has been in the
Far East.
   Princess Beatrice, born Aug. 8, is the first child of the prince,
the queen's second son, and the former Sarah Ferguson.
   Buckingham Palace said the royal couple chose Dr. John Habgood,
the archbishop of York and second-ranking prelate in the Church of
England, rather than the Archbishop of Canterbury, the church's
spiritual leader, to christen their daughter because of ``personal
and appropriate'' reasons.
   The queen, as Princess Elizabeth of York, was also christened by
the then- archbishop of York but in the chapel at Buckingham Palace.
