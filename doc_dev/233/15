The Duchess of York is expecting a second baby in March, Buckingham Palace 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
"It is great news," said the red-haired wife of Prince Andrew, who is the 
second son of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The former Sarah Ferguson, popularly known as "Fergie," and Andrew were "very 
pleased" to make the announcement, a palace statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The new baby will be the monarch's sixth grandchild. If the baby is a boy, he 
will supersede his sister, 13-month-old Princess Beatrice, to become fifth in 
line to the throne. A girl would follow Beatrice as sixth in line.

Andrew, 29, a navy lieutenant, was attending a refresher helicopter course at 
Portland navy base in southern England when the announcement was made.

The duchess, who will be 30 in October, was attending a literary luncheon. She 
told reporters, "I am very pleased that the news did not leak out. . . . I 
didn't want it splashed all over the front page. 
</P>
<P>
"Andrew is away flying helicopters, and I decided to announce it because it is 
three months."
