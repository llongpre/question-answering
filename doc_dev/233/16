   Princess Beatrice was bapitized Tuesday by the
archbishop of York with water from the Jordan River, and she let out
just one quick cry as her parents, the Duke and Duchess of York,
watched in delight.
   The 19-week-old princess, the newest member of Britain's royal
family, got a calming pat on the back from her mother after the
archbishop poured the water on her forehead in a ceremony that made
her a member of the Church of England.
   Queen Elizabeth II, the baby's grandmother who is temporal head
of the Anglican church, smiled broadly as she led the baby and about
100 relatives and friends out of the Chapel Royal at St. James'
Palace after the christening to pose briefly for photographers.
   The blue-eyed princess, who has her mother's red hair, looked
directly into the cameras. She didn't let out a peep as she rested
in the arms of the duchess, who wore an emerald green suit and
matching hat with a wide upturned brim and black band.
   Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, fifth in line to the throne and
the queen's fifth grandchild, was born on Aug. 8, 1988, at 8:18
p.m., considered to be lucky by Chinese astrologers.
   Poet Laureate Ted Hughes wrote what he called a nursey-rhyme hymn
woven around the six eights in her birth. It notes that the
``blessed and fortunate'' child comes into a world of ``poisoned
glut'' and ``poisoned seas.''
   The princess' baptism was delayed until after her father, Prince
Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, returned last week from a tour of
duty in the Far East.
   Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess chose the Most Rev.
John Habgood, Archbishop of York and second-ranking prelate in the
church rather than Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, the
church's spiritual leader, to christen their daughter because of
``personal and appropriate'' reasons _ a reference to their York
title.
   The Chapel Royal, the main surviving part of the Tudor Palace
built by Henry VIII, was also chosen by the couple, the palace said.
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were married in the chapel in 1840
and royal christenings occasionally have taken place there.
   The 30-minute private ceremony included three hymns chosen by the
parents, ``Jesus, Good Above All Other,'' ``All Things Bright and
Beautiful,'' and a Christmas touch, ``Away In A Manger.''
   The choir also sang ``Princess Beatrice's Anthem,'' composed by
Richard Popplewell, organist and choir master of the queen's Chapels
Royal, with words by the late Lord Gorell, a literary magazine
editor.
   Beatrice was dressed in the royal family's christening robe of
flowing cream Honiton lace, first worn by Queen Victoria's eldest
son in 1842.
   She was baptized at the silver gilt Lily Font, made for the
christening in 1840 of Princess Victoria, Queen Victoria's eldest
child, and used to baptize Queen Elizabeth's four children.
   Like all godparents at Anglican baptisms, Beatrice's five were
reminded of their duty to raise the princess to fight against evil
and to follow Christ.
   Her godparents are Viscount Linley, son of the queen's sister
Princess Margaret; property developer Peter Palumbo, who is chairman
of the Arts Council; Mrs. Harry Cotterell, who formerly shared an
apartment with the duchess; the Duchess of Roxburghe, at whose
Scottish home the duke proposed to the then-Sarah Ferguson; and Mrs.
John Greenall, a friend of the duchess.
   Among the guests at the christening were the queen's eldest son
and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, his wife, Princess Diana and
their two children, Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4. Queen
Mother Elizabeth, the baby's 88-year-old great-grandmother, was also
there.
   After the ceremony, the guests went to Buckingham Palace for a
tea party in the white and gold decorated Bow Room overlooking the
palace gardens. The duke, an accomplished amateur photographer, took
the official family photographs of the christening party.
