   The Duchess of York, 28-year-old wife of Prince
Andrew, gave birth today to a 6 lb. 12 oz. daughter, the couple's
first child who is fifth in line to the British throne, Buckingham
Palace said.
   Mother and child are both doing well, the palace said.
   Andrew, the Duke of York and second son of Queen Elizabeth II,
was with his wife when she was ``safely delivered of a daughter at
8:18 p.m. (3:18 p.m EDT) today,'' the palace said.
   ``Her Royal Highness and the child are both well,'' the palace
statement concluded.
   The 28-year-old prince, a Royal Navy lieutenant, returned to
London on Sunday from Singapore, where he has been on duty with the
ship HMS Edinburgh, to be on hand for the birth.
   Andrew drove his wife to the rear entrance of Portland Hospital
from their rented home 21 miles west of London this morning.
   The prince left the hospital briefly but spent the rest of the
day and evening with her. The duchess' mother, Susan Barrantes, who
had flown from her home in Argentina for the birth, also was at the
hospital.
   The queen, who was opening a new Lever Brothers soap-making
plant at Port Sunlight on the Wirral in northwest England, joked
earlier in the day that the baby was taking a long time to arrive.
   ``We hope it is soon. We are fed up with waiting,'' the queen
told young mother Heidi Courtney during a tour of the plant earlier
today.
   Mrs. Courtney's 22-month-old blonde, curly-haired daughter Carla
handed a teddy bear to the queen, who said: ``If it is a little
girl, I hope my grandchild has curly hair like this.''
   Bookmakers William Hill stopped taking bets on the sex and name
of the baby in May after Andrew was quoted as saying it would be a
girl called Annabel.
   The baby will be Her Royal Highness, Princess of York. She is
fifth in line to the throne behind Andrew's older brother, Prince
Charles, his two children, Prince William and Prince Harry, and
Andrew himself. The queen's two other grandchildren, Peter and Zara
Phillips, are the children of her only daughter, Anne.
   Dr. Anthony Kenney, 45, the duchess' obstetrician, and a team of
specialists were on hand for her arrival at the $590-a-day
American-owned hospital.
   Most photographers who had camped in front of the hospital for
weeks missed the duchess' arrival. Even the few who were outside
the rear entrance said they caught only a glimpse of the duchess as
the car sped inside.
   The duchess' father, Maj. Ronald Ferguson, was quoted by the
British media as telling fellow polo players that baby's due date
was Aug. 11.
   Andrew married the former Sarah Ferguson on July 23, 1986 at
Westminster Abbey.
   Hours after his arrival on Sunday, Andrew took his wife for a
20-minute drive in the Surrey countryside on what was the hottest
day of the year.
   Outside the hospital, crowds had been waiting for several days
and started growing as soon as the word was out that the duchess
had been admitted.
   A white banner has been flying outside the hospital for several
days saying: ``Any Minute Now!''
