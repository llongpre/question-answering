   An avalanche roared down on Prince
Charles's skiing party Thursday, killing a close friend. The future
British king was unhurt, but a witness said he trembled and wept as
a rescue helicopter arrived.
   Swiss officials had warned earlier Thursday of possible
avalanches in the area.
   The dead skier was identified as Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34, a former
aide to Queen Elizabeth II, the prince's mother. Buckingham Palace
said another skiier, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson, suffered leg
injuries.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said
Charles helped dig the victims out of the snow.
   Charles was not injured, and his wife Diana and pregnant
sister-in-law the Duchess of York were safe in a chalet at the time
of the avalanche, said the palace statement issued in London.
   There were calls in Britain for members of the royal family to
take more care. Press Association said the Dutchess of York, the
wife of Charles's younger brother Prince Andrew, had a fall earlier
in the day from which she emerged wet and shaken. She was told to
spend the afternoon resting.
   Prince Andrew was not on the ski trip.
   Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, were attending
an official engagement in London when informed of the avalanche.
The queen later talked to Charles, 39, at the Alpine chalet where
the royal party had stayed since arriving Tuesday.
   Witnesses on the mountain said Charles, the Prince of Wales and
heir to the throne, looked distraught after the avalanche buried
two of the six people in his party. One said he was weeping and
shaking when the helicopter came.
   Buckingham Palace said Charles and the others were off the main
ski trails near an extremely steep run, and were stationary when
the snow began to move.
   Charles has vacationed in the Klosters ski area for years, knows
it well and is considered good on the slopes.
   The party, including a guide, was on Mount Gotschnawang when the
snow rushed down from about 100 yards above at 2:50 p.m., said
officials of the Grisons canton, or state.
   Lindsay and Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson were flown to a hospital in
Davos, the officials said.
   According to the palace statement, ``All members of the party
were in a position to take avoiding action with the exception of
Maj. Lindsay and Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson who were both caught in the
avalanche.''
   Another statement Thursday night said: ``The Prince of Wales and
the whole party are naturally extremely distressed by this tragic
accident which resulted in the death of their close friend Maj.
Hugh Lindsay and serious injury to Mrs. Patti Palmer-Tomkinson.''
   Hanspeter Kirchhofer, an investigating magistrate in Davos, said
Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson was being treated for fractures of both legs
and was ``doing well under the circumstances.''
   The Gotschnawang station on the cable car, which skiiers ride up
the mountain, is at 7,540 feet and the prince's party had skied
down to about 5,800. The Swiss Federal Avalanche Research Institute
had warned of considerable avalanche danger above 5,200 feet in
northern Grisons.
   Lindsay was the 12th snowslide victim of the winter in
Switzerland.
   Earlier Thursday, a Polish mountain climber was killed on the
north wall of Mount Eiger, about 95 miles to the southwest.
   Charles, Diana and the Duchess of York posed for photographers
Wednesday at Klosters. The 28-year-old duchess, the former Sarah
Ferguson, is expecting her first baby in August.
   Lindsay was a close friend of Charles and Diana, who attended
his wedding last July. He frequently accompanied them on their
annual ski holiday at Klosters.
   Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson and her husband, Charles, also vacation
with the royal couple at Klosters.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publisher of the Burke's Peerage directory
of the aristocracy, said his representative in Switzerland told him
the royal party was warned of the avalanche danger.
   ``We have constantly suggested to the royal family that they be
more prudent,'' he told a reporter. ``They constantly act as though
nothing can harm them. ... After all, these people don't belong
just to families but to the world.''
   Charles had a spectacular crash on Gotschnawang in 1979, landing
on his hip and escaping unhurt.
