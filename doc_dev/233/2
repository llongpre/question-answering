   The Duchess of York, daughter-in-law of Queen
Elizabeth II, is expecting her second child in the spring and said
Tuesday she was ``absolutely ecstatic.''
   The new baby will be the sixth grandchild for the queen.
   The red-haired duchess, who will be 30 on Oct. 15, was speaking
at a literary luncheon hours after the formal announcement by
Buckingham Palace. Her husband, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a Royal
Navy lieutenant, was on duty at Portland in southwest England.
   ``Andrew is flying a helicopter somewhere today, but he is
naturally delighted ... We are absolutely ecstatic,'' the duchess
told the 300 guests at the lunch in a London hotel. It was held to
honor her as the author of two children's books.
   The news was announced at the lunch by the host, television
personality David Frost.
   ``I just want a happy, healthy baby and a friend for Beatrice. It
will be nice for Beatrice to have someone to play with,'' said the
former Sarah Ferguson, whose first baby was born 13 months ago.
   Prince Andrew, 29, is the second son of the queen and her
husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
   If the baby is a boy he will supersede his sister to become fifth
in line to the throne after Prince Charles, his two sons and Prince
Andrew. If the baby is a girl she will follow her sister Beatrice as
sixth in line.
   In the British order of succession, the sons of the sovereign and
their descendants have preference over the daughters.
   The announcement from Buckingham Palace said: ``The Duke and
Duchess of York are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of
York is expecting a baby in March.''
   The duchess, still known to the London tabloids as ``Fergie,''
said she had not yet thought of any names but was pleased there
would not be a very great age gap between her two children.
   The duchess, who is a licensed helicopter pilot, was a
publisher's assistant before her marriage and her two books are
about a helicopter named Budgie.
   ``I now have not only two books but the prospect of two children
as well,'' she said.
