   Andrew and Sarah, the duke and duchess of
York, transformed into Andy and Fergie, the down-home celebrities,
snacking at a supermarket deli, decorating a cake and shaking hands
with screaming fans.
   The royal couple's ``walkabout'' along the edge of a crowd
outside a supermarket Monday was their closest unplanned contact
with everyday Americans during a Southern California tour that has
included much hobnobbing with Hollywood celebrities.
   ``I love them both. I think Fergie and Di are just _ American,''
said Susie Clayton, referring also to Diana, the Princess of Wales.
   Ms. Clayton, 27, visiting from Arizona, waited for two hours in
on-and-off rain that could have been imported from Britain for the
royal retinue to arrive at the Von's Pavilions market in suburban
Arcadia.
   Prince Andrew and his pregnant wife, midway through their 10-day
tour, plan to meet with British denizens of Hollywood today during
a new round of stops that includes a trip to a trendy disco.
   They have already been greeted by famous faces like Roger Moore
of James Bond fame; Joan Collins, the wicked queen of the
``Dynasty'' dynasty; and Michael York, a movie actor who lately has
appeared on ``Knots Landing.''
   York, who greeted the royal pair during their travels Monday,
said that the duke and duchess have a glamour of their own.
   ``They have a youth, glamour and pizazz and they preserve a
longstanding tradition,'' he said.
   Today, Andrew and Sarah were to take a tour of Showscan, a movie
special effects studio in suburban Culver City. Later, they planned
to meet with British Oscar winners at the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills.
   Finishing out their round of entertaining the entertainment
community, they were to attend a lunch for the British Academy of
Film and Television Arts.
   Two fashion shows were laid on to finish the royal day, one at
the Music Center, and another at the Stock Exchange disco downtown.
   The royal couple is in the United States to promote trade to
Great Britain and act as patrons of the three-month UK-LA '88
festival, a celebration of the British arts in Los Angeles.
   On Monday, apart from the supermarket, the couple visited a
technology museum and the Wilshire Bullocks department store, where
they were joined by a Hollywood entourage that included Lynn
Redgrave, George Peppard and Lloyd Bridges.
   At the supermarket, the duchess cruised the aisles and paid
particular attention to the deli section, pausing to examine sushi
and stuffed chicken breasts but tasting only one item _ a dollop of
coffee-toffee chip ice cream.
   ``She said she loved the pastry but was afraid to eat it,''
confided assistant bakery manager Barbara Huereque, who recognized
a sister calorie-counter.
   Both the duchess and duke tried their hand at decorating a cake.
Andrew produced a vague approximation of a red rose and she made a
lopsided white rose, symbol of the house of York.
