   A beaming Prince Andrew welcomed Princess Diana
and her two sons with kisses and hugs when they arrived at Portland
Hospital on Wednesday for the first glimpse of the newest addition
to the royal family.
   Andrew's wife, Sarah, the Duchess of York, gave birth Monday
night to their first child, the still-unnamed Princess of York.
Mother and daughter are ``very well,'' Buckingham Palace said.
   Coral Bookmakers offered short odds on the princess being named
Charlotte, although British newspapers speculated Annabel, Victoria
and Elizabeth were also possible choices.
   More than 100 well-wishers cheered as Diana and her sons,
Princes William and Harry, arrived for their brief visit.
   It is not known when the duchess and baby will leave hospital,
although Andrew must return to his Royal Navy duties in the Far
East next week.
   The palace confirmed the duchess was expected to take the baby
to Balmoral Castle in Scotland ``at some stage'' this summer to see
her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.
   Andrew is the queen's second-oldest son and the baby is her
fifth grandchild.
