   The Duchess of York, daughter-in-law of Queen
Elizabeth II, is expecting another baby in March, Buckingham Palace
announced today.
   The former Sarah Ferguson and her husband, Prince Andrew, were
``very pleased'' to make the announcement, said a palace statement.
   Andrew is the second son of Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh,
and the baby will be the monarch's sixth grandchild.
   For the royal family, it provided a happy contrast to the
announcement Aug. 30 that Andrew's older sister, Princess Anne, is
separating from her husband of nearly 16 years, Mark Phillips.
   If the new baby is a boy, he will supercede his sister,
13-month-old Princess Beatrice, to become fifth in line to the
throne. A girl would follow Beatrice as sixth in line.
   The palace said the duchess was ``in excellent health,'' and was
expected to fulfill her existing program of engagements, while
scaling down her activities toward the end of the year.
   Andrew, 29, a navy lieutenant, was attending a refresher
helicopter course at Portland navy base in southern England when the
announcement was made.
   The red-haired duchess, who will be age 30 in October, was
attending a literary luncheon, having recently written and published
two children's books about a helicopter named Budgie.
   ``Budgie at Bendick's Point'' and ``Budgie The Little
Helicopter'' are dedicated to Andrew and Beatrice respectively.
   Sarah and Andrew are both licensed helicopter pilots.
