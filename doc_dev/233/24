   More than 800 guests attended a glittering ball
held by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday night
toate the 90th birthday of her mother this year and three
other royal anniversaries in 1990.
   The ball marked the 90th birthday of Elizabeth the Queen Mother
on Aug. 4, the 60th birthday of the queen's sister Princess
Margaret on Aug. 21, the 40th birthday of the queen's daughter
Princess Anne on Aug. 15 and the 30th birthday of the queen's
second son Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, on Feb. 19.
   Guests at what the palace called ``the dance of the decades''
included personal friends of the royals from the arts, politics and
high society and scores of other celebrities and dignitaries.
   The palace in a brief statement described it as a private
function as opposed to a formal state occasion. Almost every member
of the royal family was present to welcome the guests.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association described it
as the biggest party at the palace since the one in November 1988
marking the 40th birthday of Prince Charles, the queen's eldest son
and heir to the throne.
   Guests held dinner parties at top restaurants throughout
London's West End before driving to the palace for the ball, which
began shortly after 10 p.m.
   Because of the large number of guests, the palace picture
gallery with its valuable collection of Old Master paintings was
transformed into a ballroom.
   Its gilded ceiling was hung with blue draperies and the gallery
was lit by a starry constellation of white lights. Drawing rooms
and and the music room leading from the gallery were filled with
huge arrangements of flowers.
   Guests included songwriter Tim Rice; singer Cleo Laine; Maj.
Ronald Ferguson, the father of Prince Andrew's wife the Duchess of
York, formerly Sarah Ferguson; Mark Thatcher, son of former Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Thatcher's American wife Diane.
