   Argentine polo player Hector
Barrantes, stepfather of Britain's Duchess of York, died after a
long battle with cancer, the official news agency Telam reported
Saturday. He was 51.
   Barrantes died Friday at his polo ranch in Guamini, 335 miles
southwest of Buenos Aires, the agency said.
   He was buried Saturday at Peace Garden cemetery in Buenos Aires.
   The Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, returned to
London from Argentina on Thursday morning after a 10-day visit to
her ailing stepfather. She made the trip to Argentina with her two
children, Princess Beatrice, 2, and 4-month-old Princess Eugenie.
   In London, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said she was informed
immediately after his death Friday night. ``There is no question of
her returning to Argentina immediately,'' said the spokesman, who
by custom was not identified.
   The duchess is spending the weekend quietly with friends, the
spokesman said. Her husband, Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen
Elizabeth II, is a Royal Navy pilot currently on duty aboard HMS
Campbelton.
   Barrantes, born to a poor, working-class family, rose to become
a man who was at home with the British aristocracy.
   He got his big break at 15 when he was introduced to polo ponies.
   He first came to England in 1967 and three years later was
employed by Lord Vestey to play polo for Vestey's Stowell Park team.
   Barrantes first wife died in a car crash.
   In 1974, shock waves flowed through British society when Susan
Ferguson, niece of Viscount Powerscourt, left her husband, Maj.
Ronald Ferguson, and her daughters Sarah and Jane, to start a new
life with her husband's rival on the polo field. The Fergusons'
18-year marriage ended in divorce that year and Barrantes married
Susan in a civil ceremony in Argentina in 1975.
   Barrantes detected the first warning signs of cancer in
September, underwent surgery at a Buenos Aires clinic, and was
flown to New York where doctors confirmed he had cancer of the
lymph glands.
   He underwent chemotherapy before returning to his 1,000 acre
ranch, El Pucara, where he bred polo ponies. Barrantes had
described his illness as the ``first great inconvenience I've ever
encountered.''
   In an interview with Hello! magazine, he said: ``I'm not afraid
of dying. Having a clear conscience makes you face death in another
way.''
   He told the magazine the ranch would eventually be left to the
duchess.
   ``Sarah was there when we started work on the ranch in 1980. We
planted the first trees with her. She helped us move over there.
Sarah loves the place and in the end it will be hers.''
   Despite the rupture in Anglo-Argentine relations following the
1982 Falklands War, Barrantes was welcomed by the queen and Prince
Philip to the extended royal family when Andrew married his
stepdaughter in 1986.
   The duchess was the first member of the royal family to visit
Argentina since the war. Argentina and Britain restored full
diplomatic relations earlier this year.
   Barrantes is survived by his wife, Susan.
