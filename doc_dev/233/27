   In the two years since she married the queen's
second son Andrew, the Duchess of York has brought both sparkle and
new controversy to the royal scene.
   Some critics find her vivacious personality and sense of fun
tiresome or vulgar, her adventurous spirit verging on the reckless.
   But royal watchers say the 28-year-old former Sarah Ferguson is
a favorite with Queen Elizabeth II.
   Prince Andrew, a tall, handsome Royal Navy lieutenant, gained a
playboy reputation during a colorful bachelorhood. It included a
well-publicized romance with an American actress, Koo Stark, who
once appeared in soft-porn movies.
   But by the spring of 1986 Andrew was clearly smitten with the
red-haired Miss Ferguson. The public were enjoying her lively good
nature and the queen was reported to be greatly relieved that
Andrew had found a suitable wife.
   They married at Westminster Abbey July 23, 1986, and became the
Duke and Duchess of York. Both were 26.
   Sarah Ferguson was a new kind of royal bride.
   A sales executive with a graphic arts publishing company when
she married, she had led a free and independent life that included
a three-year romance with motor-racing figure Paddy McNally, a
widower with two sons.
   Robust, athletic and outspoken, Sarah was far from the slim,
demure and impeccably-groomed English rose that Princess Diana,
wife of Prince Charles, typified.
   She kept working after her marriage, and although she had given
up her publishing job by early 1988, she planned to do free-lance
work.
   While Andrew pursued his career as a Royal Navy pilot, his wife
learned to fly a helicopter and a plane so she could share the
experience with him.
   The Yorks have rejected the traditional choice of an old stately
home and are building a new house near Windsor Castle _ in a
neo-Tudor style that has drawn some criticism.
   Sarah's attempts to find a fashion sense of her own led to some
howling failures, each of which was dissected in the press.
   The media also criticized what they saw as the duchess' brash
and vulgar behavior during the couple's March U.S. tour,
particularly in Los Angeles.
   Newspapers were especially critical of the duchess' quip: ``I'll
see you later,'' to a man who yelled out, ``I love you'' at a
dinner.
   When Sarah wore a flamboyant black-and-red gown to a black-tie
dinner, Craig Brown of The Sunday Times wrote: ``While the stars of
Hollywood dressed in discreet black and stayed in the shadows, down
the stairs walloped someone who looked as if she'd just won third
prize for her Carmen Miranda impersonation ... at some forgotten
resort.''
   ``Has the Duchess of York gone too far?'' asked the Observer
newspaper.
   As Sarah grew heavily pregnant, the tabloids carried
unflattering photos of her and made remarks about her weight.
   But the duchess's sense of humor scarcely flagged _ except in
May when a newspaper carried a photo of her father, Maj. Ronald
Ferguson, emerging from a London massage parlor.
   While some newspapers called him Romeo Ronnie and suggested he
be fired from his job as polo manager to Prince Charles, the heir
to the throne, and others said the duchess was advised to avoid him
in public, Sarah was photographed speaking to her father, worriedly.
   The major had become a close friend of the queen's husband,
Prince Philip, through their shared interest in polo. Sarah, born
Oct. 15, 1959, has known all the queen's children since childhood.
   She became a close friend of Diana, who is reported to have done
some matchmaking in Sarah's relationship with Andrew.
   Sarah grew up at her family's 18th-century farmhouse set in
1,200 acres of rolling Hampshire countryside at Dummer. She was
educated at two local boarding schools, Daneshill and Hurst Lodge,
where she was head girl _ the school leader _ excelling at sports
rather than studies.
   Sarah's parents divorced when she was 14, and her mother, Susan,
married Argentine polo professional Hector Barrantes. They live at
Trenque Laughen near Buenos Aires and travel the international polo
circuit.
   After school, Sarah studied at St. James' secretarial college in
London. Then it was off to work, first at an apartment rental
agency, then at a Covent Garden art gallery, a sports public
relations agency and finally as a sales executive with B.C.K.
Graphic Arts in fashionable Mayfair.
