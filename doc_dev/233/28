   Britain's newest princess entered royal life in
high style Friday with a flight to the queen's summer home in
Scotland after leaving the hospital with her parents, the Duke and
Duchess of York.
   Bundled in a white blanket, the still unnamed 4-day-old Princess
of York left Portland Hospital in the arms of her mother, Sarah, as
hundreds of spectators strained for a glimpse of her tiny face.
   A smiling Sarah wore a small bear-shaped badge which said, ``I'm
a Mum.''
   Minutes later, the princess was whisked off to Balmoral Castle,
where her grandmother Queen Elizabeth II was expected to approve a
name for her.
   The baby is the first child for Prince Andrew and his wife, and
the queen's fifth grandchild. She is fifth in line to the throne.
   The royal threesome drove straight from the hospital in central
London to a Royal Air Force base for a flight to the northern
Scottish coast and a car ride to the castle, said a Buckingham
Palace spokesman.
   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, were to arrive at the
castle Monday after sailing up the Scottish coast on the royal
yacht Brittania, said the spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The monarch and her family traditionally spend parts of August
and September at the estate.
   At the hospital, hospital chefs and nurses joined several
hundred spectators awaiting the new princess' first appearance.
   Hospital spokeswoman Nicki Freer said, ``in general it has been
a pleasure having (the duchess) here. ... We all wanted to say
goodbye.''
   As the princess left the hospital, her face was barely visible,
but one newscaster narrating the event broadcast live on TV said
those ``with zoom lenses caught a glimpse of an eyebrow, an alert
eye, and a hint that she could have hair like her mother's.''
   There was a slight mishap when the red-headed Sarah handed the
baby to Andrew and stumbled while hurrying across the street to
receive a bouquet of pink carnations from an American tourist. She
recovered as bodyguards rushed to give her a hand.
   ``I waved my flowers and she started to walk over,'' said Heidi
Alasio of Eugene, Ore. ``I'm very glad she didn't fall over all the
way. It was a very nice gesture that she came to get the flowers.''
   Andrew told reporters he hoped he would suffer ``only a few''
sleepless nights because of the baby. He is scheduled to return to
his naval duties in the Far East next week.
   Asked about his feelings for his daughter, he said: ``I am
overjoyed.''
   British bookmakers and newspapers say likely choices for the
baby's name include Charlotte or Victoria, although Andrew was
quoted as saying in May that he favored Annabel.
