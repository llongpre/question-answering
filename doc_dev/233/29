   The Daily Mirror and other British tabloids have
risen to the defense of the Duchess of York, criticizing American
designer Richard Blackwell for having ``the barefaced cheek'' to put
her on his worst-dressed list.
   The Mirror said Tuesday that Blackwell was ``so sensitive about
his own precious looks that he's had them rearranged four times.''
   Blackwell had hit out at the former Sarah Ferguson in a preview
of his list of the world's 10 worst-dressed women, saying she has
none of the style of her sister-in-law Princess Diana, that she
looks ``as if she makes beds in Ireland or milks cows,'' and that
she ``walks like a duck with a bad leg.''
   Until recently, the tabloids have not been great fans of the
duchess' wardrobe, saying it runs to frumpy, outrageous and
ill-fitting.
   But the 29-year-old commoner, who married Prince Andrew in 1986,
has worked hard to retrieve her svelte figure following the birth of
their daughter, Princess Beatrice, and her stylish, well-cut new
wardrobe has won plaudits from the tabloids.
   For the popular press, which has a near-obsession with royal
watching and prints the minutest pieces of trivia, the attack on the
duchess was over the top, and below-the-belt ripostes about
facelifts were only to be expected.
   ``What A Jerk,'' bannered the Sun, Britain's largest selling
daily, on Monday. It quoted American model Marie Helvin as saying
nobody ``takes a blind bit of notice'' of Blackwell. Hardy Amies, a
favorite designer of Queen Elizabeth II, was quoted as calling him
``a complete ignoramus.''
   The rival Daily Star, under the headline ``He's At It Again!,''
accused Blackwell of ``talking through his hat.''
   The Daily Mirror noted that Blackwell's attack came ``just as the
new, slim-line Fergie is winning over fashion critics here ... in
well-cut outfits which suit her figure.''
   The newspaper Today said the duchess' new look had come ``just
too late to spare her another blasting'' from Blackwell.
   A Mirror cartoon showed Blackwell strung up to a Christmas tree,
the duchess standing on the floor dressed as a milkmaid, and Andrew
saying: ``Now then, Mr. Blackwell, what was it you said about my
wife?''
