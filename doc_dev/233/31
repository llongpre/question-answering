   The Duke and Duchess of York today left a hospital
with their newborn daughter, the Princess of York. As the proud
parents waved to hundreds of well-wishers, the newest member of
Britain's royal family slept.
   The baby, still unnamed, was swaddled in a white blanket for her
first public appearance, broadcast live on British television.
   Born Monday night weighing 6 pounds, 12 ounces, she is the first
child for Prince Andrew, the second oldest son of Queen Elizabeth
II, and his wife, Sarah. She is the queen's fifth grandchild and
fifth in line to the throne.
   The duke and duchess, both 28, waved to the crowd as they left
central London's Portland Hospital at 12:37 p.m. with the princess
for an undisclosed location.
   Before leaving, the duchess handed the baby to her husband, then
stumbled on the pavement as she accepted a bouquet of pink
carnations from an American tourist.
   ``I waved my flowers and she started to walk over,'' said Heidi
Alasio of Eugene, Ore. ``I'm very glad she didn't fall over all the
way. It was a very nice gesture that she came to get the flowers.''
   A palace spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, said the duchess was feeling ``fine.''
   Andrew told reporters he hoped he would suffer ``only a few''
sleepless nights because of the baby. He is scheduled to return to
his Royal Naval duties in the Far East next week.
   Asked about his feelings for his daughter, he said: ``I am
overjoyed.''
   It's not unusual for royal parents to take several days to
select appropriate names for their babies. The names must be
approved by the queen who is currently vacationing in Scotland.
   British bookmakers and newspapers say likely choices include
Charlotte or Victoria, although Andrew was quoted as saying in May
that he favored Annabel.
   Before arriving at the hospital, Andrew attended a Post Office
ceremony to unveil a set of postage stamps based on his photographs
of famous castles.
   The stamps, ranging in value from 1 pound ($1.70) to 5 pounds
($8.50) are the first designed by a member of Britain's royal
family.
   They show Windsor, Edinburgh, Caernarfon and Carrickfergus
castles, one for each country of the United Kingdom. All have
strong royal connections.
   Andrew, an accomplished amateur photographer, thanked the Post
Office for ``having the guts'' to invite him to take the
photographs.
