   The Duke and Duchess of York's 10-day dash
through California headed for the home stretch Friday as the royal
couple met Los Angeles' duke of oil and prepared to visit a UCLA
film class and a sculpture made of 600 Barbie and Ken dolls.
   The visit with Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman Armand
Hammer, 89, kicked off the eighth day of a whirlwind tour by Prince
Andrew and his pregnant, red-haired wife, the former Sarah Ferguson.
   ``Hi, Fergie!'' two dozen spectators chanted as Sarah emerged
from a Rolls-Royce limousine clad in a navy-blue suit, a brimless
rust-colored hat and brown shoes. Andrew, in a dark business suit,
and his wife waved politely to the small crowd.
   Hammer escorted the couple into his Wilshire Boulevard corporate
headquarters for talks over coffee and rolls. Mayor Tom Bradley
showed up for the last 10 minutes of the meeting.
   As Hammer and Bradley escorted Andrew and Sarah back to their
car, a teen-age girl gave Sarah a bouquet and spectators yelled,
``It's wonderful seeing you'' and ``Come back again!''
   ``It's amazing,'' said British-born spectator Elaine Ball, who
has lived in Los Angeles for five years. ``You never see the royal
family over there, but you come 6,000 miles and you can see them.''
   The duke and duchess sped to the nearby University of
California, Los Angeles, where they were greeted by Chancellor
Charles Young, his wife and a crowd of 200 students _ some yelling
``Sarah! Sarah!'' _ then swiftly escorted to a luncheon with more
than 100 students.
   ``Sarah's so pretty,'' said student Rachel Perse, 19.
   ``Andy looked good, too!'' added 20-year-old Roberta Salazar.
   The royal itinerary at UCLA included a stop to view sculptures
of the Barbie and Ken dolls and UCLA's Bruin Bear mascot; a gift to
Andrew and Sarah of historical newsreel footage of the royal
family; visits to a film-making class and the Jules Stein Eye
Institute; and a walk across the Center for Health Sciences Plaza.
   The sculpture of Barbie and Ken dolls, entitled ``Off the Beaten
Track,'' was created by 31-year-old Scottish-born artist David
Mach. His work, on view through March 13 outside a UCLA art
gallery, consists of a two-ton, 20-by-10-foot cargo bin that
appears to be supported by the 600 dolls, their arms outstretched
above them.
   Mach's sculpture, which purportedly satirizes consumerism, is on
display as part of ``UK@LA '88: A Celebration of British Arts,''
which Andrew and Sarah are promoting on their visit.
   After leaving UCLA by helicopter, the duke and duchess were due
in Palm Springs to open a department store boutique Saturday
morning. Then they will travel to the Eldorado Polo Club in nearby
Indio to attend a polo match to benefit efforts to rebuild
Shakespeare's Globe Theater on its original site on the banks of
the Thames River.
   Sarah's father, Major Ronald Ferguson, will be captain of the
Windsor Park team in the polo match.
   On Sunday, the royal couple are scheduled to travel from Palm
Springs to Los Angeles for a flight back to London.
