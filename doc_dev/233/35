   Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, open their
10-day California visit with a Hollywood-style welcome from Los
Lobos, the hometown group featured in the hit film ``La Bamba.''
   After a welcoming ceremony at City Hall today, the Duke and
Duchess of York were to be entertained by Los Lobos.
   The group was to perform ``La Bamba,'' the rollicking Spanish
song immortalized by Ritchie Valens, the subject of last summer's
movie. Valens died in a 1959 plane crash with rockers Buddy Holly
and the Big Bopper.
   The royal couple arrived amid tight security in spring-like
weather Friday, five years to the day after the start of a similar
tour by Andrew's parents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip.
   ``He's a friendly, outgoing young man and we're happy to have
him in our city,'' Mayor Tom Bradley said after welcoming the
couple at Los Angeles International Airport.
   Their tour is crammed with receptions, banquets, tours,
exhibitions and other official functions.
   Today, the royal pair were to tour Chinatown, visit an
elementary school, have lunch with Bradley, and host a press
reception aboard the royal yacht Britannia, docked at Long Beach.
   Security personnel experienced some tense moments Friday when
they found an abandoned briefcase about a block from where the
Brittania was docked. A State Department bomb unit exploded the
attache case.
   ``It was no bomb,'' said a British consulate spokeswoman who did
not want her name used.
   The duke and duchess deplaned at a remote section of the airport
after an 11-hour flight from London. A red carpet flanked by
American and British flags was rolled out to the stairway to the
plane.
   The couple were greeted by Bradley, Los Angeles County
Supervisor Deane Dana, British Consul General Donald Ballentyne and
their wives.
   Sarah, wearing a black suit, a blue-and-green blouse and a black
bow, was handed a bouquet by the mayor's wife, Ethel. The prince,
wearing a gray suit, waved at reporters and photographers.
   The couple boarded a black-and-white Rolls Royce limousine,
which quickly departed in a motorcade to Long Beach.
   Andrew, 28, and his wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, also 28,
will spend much of their time taking part in the UK-LA Festival, a
celebration of British cultural and commercial achievement.
   Gynecologist Anthony Kenney is traveling with the couple to
monitor Sarah's first pregnancy. The baby is due in August.
   The prince, the third child of Queen Elizabeth II, was a
rollicking bachelor dubbed ``Randy Andy'' when he visited Los
Angeles four years ago. The trip's most memorable moment came when
he turned a paint sprayer on the press corps while visiting a
housing project.
