   The Duchess of York and Prince Andrew are expecting
a baby that would be their second child and the sixth grandchild of
Queen Elizabeth II.
   ``I just want a happy, healthy baby and a friend for Beatrice. It
will be nice for Beatrice to have someone to play with,'' said the
former Sarah Ferguson, who is due in March and whose first baby was
born 13 months ago.
   The red-haired duchess known as ``Fergie,'' who will be 30 on
Oct. 15, spoke at a literary luncheon Tuesday hours after the formal
announcement by Buckingham Palace. Her husband, also 29, was on duty
as a Royal Navy lieutenant at Portland in southwest England.
   ``Andrew is flying a helicopter somewhere today, but he is
naturally delighted,'' the duchess said. ``We are absolutely
ecstatic.''
   Television personality David Frost announced the pregnancy to the
300 guests at the luncheon honoring the duchess as the author of two
children's books about a helicopter named Budgie.
   If the baby is a boy, the British order of succession will put
him ahead of his sister as the fifth in line to the throne, after
Prince Charles, his two sons and Prince Andrew.

   Former President Reagan went through
get-well cards and messages from Hollywood friends such as Bob Hope,
Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Stewart as he continued his recovery
from skull surgery.
   In addition, Maureen Reagan paid her father a surprise visit,
joining Reagan and his wife, Nancy, at lunch Tuesday, said family
spokesman Mark Weinberg.
   Reagan, 78, underwent surgery Friday at St. Marys Hospital to
drain fluid that built up on his brain after he was thrown from a
horse on July 4. His recovery is progressing as expected, Weinberg
said.
   ``We're still hopeful, if the present rate of progress continues,
he will be able to return to California by the end of the week,''
Weinberg said. ``There are no plans at this point for any additional
surgery.''

   Jazz pianist Dave Brubeck will ``Take
Five'' tonight to become the first person inducted into the
University of Pacific's new Pantheon of the Arts.
   Actor Burgess Meredith, a longtime friend of Brubeck's, will be
master of ceremonies for the induction at the independent,
5,800-student university.
   Brubeck will show his appreciation by presenting a concert Friday
evening with the Stockton Symphony in this city 75 miles east of San
Francisco. Proceeds will go toward a Conservatory of Music-Stockton
Symphony string scholarship.
   Brubeck attended then-College of the Pacific with plans to become
a veterinarian. But legend has it that a science professor so often
found Brubeck rewriting melodies that wafted through the windows
from the music conservatory that he suggested his young charge
``just go over there.''
   Brubeck did, graduating in 1942 as a music major and going on to
pioneer a style called progressive jazz with compositions such as
``Take Five.''

   Comic strip creators Mort Walker, Will Eisner
and the late Dik Browne have been voted into the Hall of Fame of the
Museum of Cartoon Art.
   Walker, whose strip ``Beetle Bailey'' is about Army life, founded
the museum in 1974.
   Eisner, who drew and wrote ``The Spirit'' for 10 years, has
become one of the leading artists in graphic novels, the museum said.
   Browne, who invented ``Hagar the Horrible'' about a good-natured
Viking chief and the family that puts up with him, was known by his
professional peers as the ``cartoonists' cartoonist,'' the museum
said. He died in June.
   The induction ceremony, scheduled for Sept. 22, will bring to 27
the number of cartoonists elected during the past 14 years, the
museum said Tuesday.

   Most 59-year-old women would be content to have
their doctor tell them they look good. But not Mitzi Gaynor.
   ``What do you mean good? Whatever happened to sensational? What's
the matter, you never heard the word magnificent before?''
   The exuberant entertainer was pronounced looking good by a doctor
who examined her before she left on a lengthy tour as star of the
Cole Porter musical ``Anything Goes.''
   She disagreed with the diagnosis after she peeked over his
shoulder and saw his report, she said in a recent interview.
   Miss Gaynor has appeared in 17 movies, including the film
versions of ``Anything Goes'' and ``South Pacific.'' But she says
her real breakthrough in the entertainment business occurred in the
1960s when she became one of the first women to do a one-person show
in Las Vegas.

   Actor Donald Sutherland, who plays a South African
teacher in the film ``A Dry White Season,'' said a movie with a
powerful anti-apartheid message may inflame enough people to take
action.
   ``South Africa is a country that does not care what people in the
rest of the world think,'' Sutherland said Monday at the Toronto
Festival of Festivals.
   ``A Dry White Season,'' which was favorably received by audiences
and critics in its world premiere at the festival, shows how a
once-passive Sutherland responds to a series of revolting events.
   Also in the film are Marlon Brando, who plays a human rights
attorney, and South African actor Zakes Mokae.
   The movie has graphic scenes of police violence and torture in
South Africa. Its producers say it was difficult to get the film
made because some studios shy away from making films with political
messages.
   ``I believe that films can have an effect on social change,''
said director Euzhan Palcy. ``Any little thing can help.'' Palcy
adapted the film from a novel by South African author Andre Brink.
   MGM is slated to release ``A Dry White Season'' in select markets
Sept. 20 before a wider market release.
