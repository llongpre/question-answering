<HEAD>Royal Family Gets Pay Increase of 4.6 Percent, Below Inflation</HEAD>

   Queen Elizabeth II and her family got a pay
increase in Tuesday's annual budget of 4.6 percent, which was lower
than inflation but still means they will cost the taxpayers $10.6
million.
   The increase of 273,000 pounds ($466,800) brought the total to
6,195,300 pounds ($10,594,000), and was too much for some Labor
Party legislators whatever its relation to the cost of living.
   ``For the royal family, it looks as though Christmas has come
early,'' Labor member Max Madden said in the House of Commons.
   An increase of 4.6 percent for the Civil List, as the royal
allowances are known, compares with annual inflation of 7.5 percent,
up from 3.3 percent a year ago.
   Members of the royal family are paid for carrying out such
official duties as receiving ambassadors, presenting awards, opening
hospitals, visiting the armed forces and making foreign tours.
   Most of the money goes to salaries for the 350 royal household
staff, from private secretaries to coachmen, gardeners and window
cleaners at Buckingham Palace and the other royal residences.
   Queen Elizabeth, rich in in her own right, will receive 4.65
million pounds ($7.96 million) in the 1989-90 fiscal year, up from
4.55 million pounds.
   Her 88-year-old mother, Queen Mother Elizabeth, will get 404,000
pounds ($691,000), and Prince Philip, her husband, will be paid
225,300 pounds ($385,000).
   The queen's youngest son Prince Edward, 25, who quit the Royal
Marines and now works as a production assistant for a theater
company run by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, does not get a raise.
He has received 20,000 pounds ($34,200) a year since 1982.
   Prince Charles, heir to the throne, and his wife Diana are not on
the list because he is Prince of Wales and lives on income from the
Duchy of Cornwall estates. That amounted to 1.4 million pounds ($2.4
million) last year.
   The largest percentage raise was for the queen's second son,
Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a naval lieutenant on a destroyer. His
state allowance rises from 86,500 pounds ($148,000) to 155,400
pounds (nearly $266,000), or more than 79 percent. He also will get
21,000 pounds (nearly $36,000) in service pay plus allowances.
   Andrew has been accused of taking too much leave and not handling
enough royal duties to justify his allowance.
   Madden called the raise a ``monster increase'' that would ``amaze
and astonish'' most people, who he said would not find much benefit
for themselves in the budget.
   Andrew's raise will pay for his office at Buckingham Palace,
established in 1986 when he married Sarah Ferguson, now Duchess of
York. Their staff includes a private secretary, a full-time
lady-in-waiting, up to four clerks, a chauffeur and a dresser to
look after the duchess's clothes.
   Labor legislator Chris Mullin said the royal family should pay
tax on their state grants and claimed the queen could afford it
because she is ``one of the richest people in the world.''
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said
she pays the equivalent of 80 percent tax on the income from her
estates and invested wealth, double the top rate of her richest
subjects.
   ``The queen is the most heavily taxed person in Britain,'' he
said, and estimated royal revenues at 50 million pounds ($85.5
million) a year, of which the queen would retain 10 million pounds
($17.1 million).
   ``That is the same as being taxed at 80 percent,'' Brooks-Baker
said.
   In the time of King George III in the 18th century, he said,
monarchs found they could not live on their income and agreed to
surrender all revenues in return for the Civil List, a sum
Parliament deemed sufficient for their needs.
   Each monarch since has opted for the Civil List at the start of a
new reign, but because today's royal revenues are much greater than
before, the queen has been allowed to keep a portion, Brooks-Baker
said.
