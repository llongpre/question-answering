   The Princess of York, newborn daughter of the Duke
and Duchess of York, is fifth in line the British throne now
occupied by her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.
   The baby girl born Monday night is far enough away from the
ancient seat not to have to train seriously for it as her Uncle
Charles, the first in line, did.
   Charles' 6-year-old son, Prince William of Wales, is destined to
be king after his father and will no doubt have to study for the
role more diligently than younger brother Prince Harry, almost 4,
the third in line.
   The baby's father, 28-year-old Prince Andrew, the Duke of York
and second son of the queen, is fourth in line as long as Charles
and his wife, Diana, have no other children to push Andrew further
down the list.
   The baby princess is officially Her Royal Highness Princess of
York.
   Her place in the line will change if her parents have a son, who
would be placed ahead of her, or if the Prince and Princess of
Wales have a daughter or another son.
   The new York baby pushes Prince Edward, 24, the queen's third
son, back to sixth place, and 37-year-old Anne _ her only daughter
and second-eldest child, back to seventh place.
   Anne's children _ Peter Phillips, 10, and Zara Phillips, 7 _ are
eighth and ninth in line. They are not a prince and princess, nor
are they designated royal highnesses, because Anne's husband,
equestrian champion Mark Phillips, has no royal title.
   The queen's 57-year-old sister, Princess Margaret, the Countess
of Snowdon, is 10th in line followed by her children, Viscount
Linley, 26, and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, 24, in 11th and 12th
place.
   The order of succession then shifts to the queen's cousins: the
Duke of Gloucester and his three children, the Duke of Kent and two
of his three children, and the two children of his brother Prince
Michael of Kent, who lost his own place by marrying a Roman
Catholic. The Duke of Kent's eldest son also lost his place in the
line of succession because he married a Catholic.
   The Kent brothers' sister, Princess Alexandra and her two
children are next.
