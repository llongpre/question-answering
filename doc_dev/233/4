   Sarah Ferguson was lauded as a breath of fresh air
in the stuffy world of royal protocol when she married Prince Andrew
2{ years ago, but today the Duchess of York is known in some
quarters as ``Her Royal Idleness.''
   Britain's brassy tabloids also are calling her ``Duchess
Dolittle'' for what they view as her love of holidays and
jet-setting lifestyle.
   A recent scorecard listing the public engagements of Britain's
royal family put Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, at the bottom with
only 30 last year.
   Sarah was next with 55, less than half those performed by her
husband's 88-year-old grandmother, Queen Mother Elizabeth.
   Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew, as a naval officer, was not
expected to have other commitments and that Sarah gave birth to
their first child in August.
   But a public opinion poll published Sunday in News of the World
indicated 34 percent of Britons surveyed believe the 29-year-old
duchess does not earn the $150,000 she and her husband receive
yearly from the government for royal duties.
   ``Her Royal Idleness,'' the newspaper's headline blared.
``Freeloading Fergie is the most unpopular member of the royal
family,'' its story said.
   The newspaper said Market and Opinion Research International Ltd.
polled 501 adults last week. No margin of error was given.
   News about Queen Elizabeth II and her family sells newspapers in
Britain, and the duchess has suffered her share of barbs since she
first was linked to Andrew more than three years ago.
   At first, the duchess was lauded for her breezy style and
friendly, open manner. But she slowly became a target, mainly for
her healthy appetite, sometimes plump figure and fashion gaffes.
   After an official visit to California last March, even the
serious newspapers said Sarah and Andrew's behavior had been brash
and vulgar, particularly her bold repartee with audiences.
   As the duchess gained weight last summer during the later months
of her pregnancy, the tabloids delighted in publishing unflattering
photographs of her.
   Criticism intensified last fall when she left her newborn baby,
Princess Beatrice, at home with a nanny for six weeks while she went
to Australia on official business and holidays.
   The attacks reached a crescendo last week when Sarah and Andrew
went skiing at Klosters, Switzerland, where Maj. Hugh Lindsay, a
close friend of the royal family, died last year in an avalanche
that narrowly missed Prince Charles, heir to the throne.
   Critics considered the trip an excessive holiday and unseemly
because it came only a year after the tragedy.
   The Daily Mirror, which branded Sarah ``Duchess Dolittle,'' said
she sobbed after daily briefings by aides on the tabloid attacks.
   The duchess flew to London on Friday to attended a memorial
service for the 34 people killed in a triple-train crash in south
London in December. It was one of only six public engagements she
has scheduled until March, according to Buckingham Palace's official
list.
   The Sunday Times of London, which usually does not focus on the
private lives of the royal family, said the duchess was suffering
from a general cooling in relations between the palace and the media.
   The chill is largely due to the royal family's failure to attend
a memorial service in Lockerbie, Scotland, for victims of the Dec.
21 crash of Pan Am Flight 103, and the decision to send Prince
Philip to the funeral of Japan's Emperor Hirohito. Many British
veterans still consider Hirohito a war criminal.
   ``Whether the activities of the duchess are an embarrassment and
a disgrace or whether she is merely fulfilling a popular need for a
bete noir in the nation's most popular soap opera is debatable,''
The Sunday Times said.
