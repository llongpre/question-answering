   Princess Beatrice, the month-old daughter of the
Duke and Duchess of York, will not accompany her parents on their
official visit to Australia, Buckingham Palace said today.
   Beatrice, who is fifth in line to the throne and the fifth
grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, will stay at home during the
Sept. 28 to Oct. 7 visit.
   ``She'll certainly be remaining behind with her nanny,'' said a
palace spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity. Asked why,
she said, ``It's the decision of the duchess.''
   Princess Beatrice was born Aug. 8.
   The Duchess of York, formerly Sarah Ferguson, will fly to
Australia alone, where she will meet Prince Andrew, a Royal Navy
lieutenant, whose ship is on a tour of duty in the Far East.
