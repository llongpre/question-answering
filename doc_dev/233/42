   Prince Charles escaped an avalanche
while skiing today, but the snowslide killed one of his friends and
injured another.
   Buckingham Palace identified the dead man as Maj. Hugh Lindsay,
a former equerry, or aide, to Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II.
A woman in the party, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson, suffered leg
injuries, the palace said.
   The palace said Charles was not injured. But witnesses said the
prince looked distraught, and one said he was weeping and shaking
as a helicopter arrived to pick him up.
   Charles' wife, Diana, and Sarah Ferguson, his pregnant
sister-in-law, were not on the slopes at the time, the palace said.
   Swiss authorities said the snowslide on Mt. Gotschnagrat near
Klosters began about 300 feet above a group of six skiers that
included Prince Charles. The prince and three other people were
unharmed.
   The palace said the party was skiing off the main ski run and
was stationary when the avalanche began at 2:45 p.m.
   ``All members of the party were in a position to take avoiding
action with the exception of Maj. Lindsay and Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson, who were both caught in the avalanche,'' it said.
   Lindsay, 34, was a serving army major and a friend of Charles
and Diana. He was married to a Buckingham Palace press secretary
who was expecting a baby, the palace said.
   Peter Balsiger, editor-in-chief of the Zurich-based newspaper
Blick, was quoted as saying he was told Charles, 39, helped dig one
person out of the snow.
   The palace statement said a Swiss guide and members of the royal
party helped dig the victims free. It did not say whether Charles
was among the diggers.
   A French photographer told BBC radio he saw Charles being
comforted by someone as a helicopter took off with a stretcher.
   BBC TV news said the queen was understood to have spoken to the
family at the chalet where they gathered after the tragedy.
   The 1988 Good Ski Guide describes the run where the accident
occurred as ``a slope of awesome steepness, dropping about 500
meters (yards).''
   Prince Charles skied the area many times during his bachelor
days and is credited with giving Klosters its exclusive tag.
   The guide says: ``Prince Charles is no doubt pleased to have put
(it) behind him; mercifully it is rarely open.''
   ``They (avalanches) are extremely difficult to predict. That is
what makes them so dangerous,'' said Peter Cliff, an Alpine guide
and leader of the Cairngorm mountain rescue team in Scotland.
   The most common is the snow-slab avalanche, when snow driven by
wind creates a crusted surface, underlaid with air pockets, and is
liable to fracture across the entire width of a slope.
   Without warning, massive slides can be set off by temperature
increases, new falls of snow or skiers and climbers.
   The royals arrived in Switzerland on Tuesday.
   Charles, Diana and the Duchess of York, who is married to
Charles' younger brother Prince Andrew, posed for photographers at
Klosters on Wednesday for photographers. The 28-year-old duchess,
the former Sarah Ferguson, is expecting her first baby in August.
