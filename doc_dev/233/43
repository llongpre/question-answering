   The Duke and Duchess of York spent a jovial
day among the arts and artists, joking with conductor Andre Previn
following a concert by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and
laughing with artist David Hockney.
   Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, spent Wednesday evening at
the Music Center listening to the two-hour concert that included a
work by their countryman, Ralph Vaughan Williams.
   The duke and duchess, both 28, were scheduled to visit the
aircraft carrier USS Nimitz today, the seventh day of their 10-day
visit as patrons of the UK@LA '88 arts festival.
   The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier sailed from San Diego at 7
a.m. for the noon rendezvous.
   The Navy planned a fly-by of A-7 jets breaking the sound
barrier, demonstrations of catapault launches and recovery of
aircraft and a lunch that included asparagus soup, marinated
mushrooms, chicken salad and cherries jubilee.
   The prince, who is a Royal Navy officer and helicopter pilot who
saw action in Britain's Falkland Islands war, was to be catapaulted
from the carrier's deck aboard an S-3A Viking anti-submarine
warfare jet.
   On Wednesday, the duchess, who is expecting her first child in
August, was given a bouquet of lavendar roses sporting a white
stork and balloon that read ``Special Delivery'' when she arrived
for the concert.
   Sarah wore a calf-length jade-green gown, contrasting with her
red hair pulled to the side with a flower hair ornament.
   Afterward, the royal couple chatted with Previn and his wife,
Heather. The conversation ended in laughter, as they joked about
the fierce facial expressions conductors sometimes wear.
   So far, the couple known popularly as Andy and Fergie have
hobnobbed with Hollywood celebrities and local business and
political leaders and taken a backstage look at a movie
special-effects studio.
   Earlier in the day, Andrew greeted American investors for a
five-hour cruise aboard Her Majesty's Yacht Britannia by quipping,
``Please don't sink her when you go to sea. Bon Voyage.''
   Andrew also expressed his appreciation for Wednesday's sunny
skies, which followed days of rain during their visit.
   ``We thank you for the weather, for as you know, when the queen
and the royal family comes to pay a visit the weather gets
dreadful,'' Andrew said.
   To the delight of Americans, the duchess dropped her regal
composure a few hours later outside the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art.
   ``Check these out!'' she called out, flouncing about to show the
crowds her hair tied in a loose ponytail and held by clips shaped
like the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes.
   Sarah wore a purple knee-length skirt and matching blazer with
tan shoes to Wednesday's museum visit. The prince wore a gray suit,
pale green shirt and dark green tie.
   At the museum, Hockney met them beneath two of his works, the
giant paintings ``Les Mamille,'' a depiction of a harbor done for
an opera set, and ``A Walk Around the Courtyard, Acatlan.''
   Hockney and museum officials led the couple through the
retrospective show, which includes 150 paintings, 60 drawings and
30 photographs.
