   Newspapers clamored today for Prince Charles and
other royals to abandon dangerous pursuits after the 39-year-old
heir to the British throne narrowly escaped an avalanche that
killed a close friend.
   ``Charles is the next king .... That means he must be ...
safeguarded, if need be from himself,'' the Daily Mirror admonished
in an editorial.
   It said Charles as well as Prince Andrew and his wife, the
Duchess of York, took ``unnecessary risks.''
   ``The royals have a duty to play it safe,'' the newspaper added.
   Charles' 28-year-old brother, Andrew, was catapaulted off the
deck of the U.S. carrier Nimitz in a jet fighter when he and the
28-year-old duchess visited the United States last week.
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, is expecting the
couple's first child in August. She was on a skiing holiday with
Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, 26, and friends at Klosters
in the Swiss Alps when the avalanche occurred Thursday. All are
good skiers.
   Sarah, who fell skiing earlier Thursday and was advised to rest,
was with Diana in a chalet when the avalanche struck.
   Andrew, a Royal Navy helicopter co-pilot in the 1982 Falklands
War and now a helicopter instructor, missed the holiday because of
duties at Portland naval based in southwest England.
   The avalanche killed Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34, and injured another
friend of the royals, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson.
   Charles, the lead skier, and the rest of his party managed to
evade the avalanche. He helped rescue the unconscious Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson, both of whose legs were broken, and then helped
free Lindsay's body from under the snow.
   Another tabloid, The Sun, demanded: ``Why was he there?''
   ``Daredevil Charles has a passion for pushing himself to the
limit on the snow. Each time he dons his skis he likes to shake off
his tag of pampered prince and prove he is a real man ... Charles
has consistently risked his life by going on increasingly deadly
slopes,'' The Sun said.
   Swiss authorities had warned that the area where the royal party
was skiing was prone to avalanches.
   The Sun quoted Alex Broggi, a Klosters ski club owner, as
calling Charles ``incredibly brave.'' Broggi added, ``Many locals
are amazed by the runs he attempts. They wouldn't go anywhere near
them.''
   The Star said in an editorial: ``We don't want our royals to be
wimps ... But advisers who should know better must never again lead
the heir to the throne into such deadly danger.''
   The royals and many of their friends have a pronounced taste for
danger and Charles once asserted: ``If you occasionally live
dangerously it helps you appreciate life.''
   The Daily Mail said: ``The question asked by well-wishers of the
royal family is: Why do so many of them go in for such perilous
sports?'' It urged Queen Elizabeth II to ``ask your offspring, for
the nation's sake, to show just a little more care.''
   Charles' other sports include polo and fox hunting. He has
injured himself several times in falls from his horse at polo.
   His father, Prince Philip, 66, played polo until recently while
the 61-year-old queen is an accomplished horsewoman.
   Princess Anne, 37, the queen's only daughter, goes fox hunting
and occasionally rides in horse races, where accidents are numerous.
