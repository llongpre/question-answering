<LEADPARA>  TODAY in the Los Angeles Ad Club, Premiere magazine holds its power luncheon,
announcing that publication's choice of Hollywood's most powerful actors,
producers and directors. As you read this, Oscar night will have made some of
these chosen ones more -- or less -- powerful.;    Among the Oscar nominees
chosen for the 1991 Power List: Julia Roberts, "this generation's first
bankable woman." Kevin Costner, "They all laughed -- now he's the new
Redford." Robert De Niro, "This generation's Brando." Also a big power,
according to Premiere -- Penny Marshall, snubbed by the Academy, although her
film, "Awakenings," and her star, De Niro, were nominated.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Those who moved up the power scale from last year include actors Barbra
Streisand, Harrison Ford and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and directors Spike Lee,
Tim Burton and Rob Reiner.;    But Premiere has bad news for stars Bette
Midler and Robert Redford and producers Donald Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer
of Disney and Jon Peters of Columbia. They are, according to the magazine,
fading fast.;    ROYAL TALES: I just finished reading Charles Higham and Roy
Moseley's delightful book, "Elizabeth and Philip: The Untold Story of the
Queen of England and Her Prince." So I am now well up on the foibles of the
royals. Some of the book concerns itself with the recent antics of Fergie, the
Duchess of York.;    Now I've heard another tale about the vibrant, red-headed
duchess. This one is a doozie. It seems the writer Nancy Holmes was approached
by an intermediary of Fergie to write a story on the new country house of
Prince Andrew and his Duchess for the magazine HG. Holmes said, "I'd love to!"
-- only to discover that the duchess expects a big payment for letting her
digs be put into the public eye.;    There are some who call Fergie "The
Hustling Duchess" and "The Freeloading Fergie." But these epithets may not be
entirely deserved. It is not considered bad form by the Brits to accept money
for giving their private lives over to publication. Recently, the Duchess
received $250,000 cash from the Spanish magazine and gave every penny of it to
her impoverished mother, Susan Barrantes.;    NO! NO! NO!: Elizabeth Taylor
has not been approached to replace Delta Burke on "Designing Women," as the
imaginative Star tabloid claims. So says E.T.'s press rep, Chen Sam.;    So
what is Miz Liz up to? Soon -- within the next two weeks -- the star flies to
Acapulco to shoot the first of her "White Diamonds" TV spots. These will be
filmed outdoors in glorious, artsy, black and white; directed by Britisher
Terry Bradford.; From Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood; 
MADONNA MOVIES: Madonna is laying plans to play Martha Graham -- the mother of
American modern dance -- in a big-screen film biography.;    That's the word
from the pop icon's manager, Freddy DeMann.  </TEXT>
