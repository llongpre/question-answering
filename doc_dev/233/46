   The Duke and Duchess of York are no strangers to American supermarkets, appearing regularly in the tabloids. 
Next week, however, they'll be appearing live at a California grocery store, touting British comestibles. 

   On Feb. 29, Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, will take a half-hour tour of Vons Cos.' 
Pavilions supermarket here as part of a promotional effort by Food From Britain, a U.K. government-sponsored group that works with retailers in the U.S. to boost American consumption of British foods, from soups to cheeses. 

   By featuring U.K. products in Vons' stores during the royal Couple's 10-day visit to Los Angeles later this month, Food From Britain hopes Americans will discover "that British food isn't dull and drab and ghastly and horrible," says Patricia Matthews, a spokeswoman for the group. 

   In 1986, British foods made up just under 3% of the total $665 million of foods and beverages imported in the U.S. 

   Last year, Food From Britain arranged promotions at 29 retail chains covering 1,200 stores. 
The promotions have meant annual increases in export volume of as much as 15% for some British producers, says Anthony Matthews, president of Food From Britain and husband of Mrs. Matthews, the group's spokeswoman. 

   Members of the royal Family have toured U.S. department stores before to promote British goods. 
But getting Andy and Fergie (as the couple are often called in the tabloids) to visit Vons Pavilions is a grocery-industry coup. 

   But it won't be the last such promotion. 
From here, the British food promoters move on to Buffalo, Detroit and Memphis. 
Then, in September, they'll be at Waldbaum and Food Emporium in New York -- this time without the royals. 

   Vons has been moving to capture the No. 1 spot among Southern California supermarket chains, aiming to grow through acquisitions and aggressive marketing. 

   Mr. Matthews says Food From Britain selected Vons because it was impressed with the company's marketing strategies and the diversity of its stores. 
Mr. Matthews also had worked with Bill Hyde, Vons' vice president, specialty food products, when Mr. Hyde was merchandising director for Bloomingdale's in New York. 

   During the Royal visit, Vons will push products like Coleman's English mustard, Schweppes seltzers and tonics, Keeler marmalade and Baxters soups. 

   The supermarket chain also will add some British flavor to its menu of prepared foods, with Cornish Pasties, a type of pastry; Stilton quiche and Cheshire cheddar cheese tarts. 

   Elizabeth Page, Vons executive chef, has been working up recipes for the prepared foods since December, but she confides that her chefs have found some of them hard to swallow. 
"They kept asking me to take the kidney out of the steak and kidney pie," she says.
