   Budgie the helicopter was nowhere to be seen
Tuesday during the Duchess of York's visit to a children's museum.
   Indeed, the former Sarah Ferguson didn't even mention her books
``Budgie the Little Helicopter'' and ``Budgie at Bendick's Point,''
children's tales of a helicopter that has adventures and doesn't
like to bathe.
   When the British duchess known as ``Fergie'' led a group of
schoolchildren to a table laden with books by her publisher, Simon
and Schuster, there was no sign of Budgie.
   The meeting between the duchess and youngsters at the Children's
Museum of Manhattan was organized by Reading is Fundamental, a
program that encourages children to read books.
   Asked why her books weren't among those being handed out to
children, the duchess just smiled.
   ``It wasn't an event to promote the Budgie books,'' said Ken
Geist of Simon and Schuster.
   To showcase Budgie ``would have been too obvious,'' said Francis
Corniche, a spokesman for the British Embassy.
   The duchess, who is married to Prince Andrew, has said she got
the idea for the Budgie character while taking helicopter lessons.
Andrew is a helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy.
