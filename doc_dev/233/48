   Actor Tom Cruise says working with veteran actors
such as Paul Newman and Dustin Hoffman is a learning experience.
   ``What you get from great actors like Newman and Hoffman is where
to focus your energies and what to worry about and what not to worry
about,'' Cruise said. ``Because as a young actor, you're worried
about everything.''
   Cruise, 26, starred with Newman in ``The Color of Money,'' and
with Hoffman in the to-be-released ``Rain Man.''
   In ``Rain Man,'' the 51-year-old Hoffman plays an autistic man
with remarkable powers of memory and a $3 million inheritance.
Cruise plays his brother, who wants the money.
   Hoffman, known as a hard-working perfectionist on a movie set,
says Cruise is equally driven.
   ``He's a demon. He gets up early, he works out, he goes home
early, he studies, he works out again at night. ... And he always
wanted to rehearse,'' Hoffman said in December's Gentlemen's
Quarterly.

   A judge dismissed Jackie Mason's libel suit
against a Florida woman who filed a paternity suit against the
comedian.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan threw out Mason's lawsuit Monday
for lack of personal jurisdiction.
   Mason last year sued Ginger Reiter and her mother, Miriam Oliver,
alleging libel, invasion of privacy, copyright infringement and
unjust enrichment, over a live stage production ``Oh Jackie Oh,'' on
which they collaborated.
   Ms. Reiter's paternity lawsuit in Florida is pending.
   Mason's attorney, Jay D. Kramer, declined comment on Monday's
ruling, saying he had not yet seen it.
   There was no answer at the Port Washington offices of Ms.
Reiter's lawyers when called for comment Monday evening.

   Tahnee Welch says it was difficult growing up as
the child of a sex symbol, but she doesn't fault her mother, Raquel.
   ``She's a hard worker. She's always taken care of herself. My
mother has never, never, never been supported by anyone,'' the
26-year-old Welch said. ``So I had it in my mind that I had to do it
myself. I have this pride.''
   The younger Welch insists she won her part in the 1985 film,
``Cocoon,'' on merit, not because of her mother. Welch also appears
in the recently released ``Cocoon: The Return.''
   ``They said I never paid my dues,'' Welch said in an interview in
December's Gentlemen's Quarterly. ``It's like what I was doing
didn't count. Like I cheated. But the point is not the advantages I
had but what I'm doing with them.''

   The Duke and Duchess of York picked the historic
Chapel Royal in London's St. James Palace for the Dec. 20
christening of their infant daughter, Princess Beatrice.
   The chapel was the site of the wedding of Queen Victoria and
Prince Albert in 1840 and where royal christenings occasionally have
taken place.
   Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, fifth in line to the throne and
the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, will wear the royal
family's christening robe of Honiton lace and will be baptized at
the silver gilt Lily Font, Buckingham Palace said Monday.
   Princess Beatrice, born Aug. 8, is the first child of Prince
Andrew, the queen's second son, and the former Sarah Ferguson.
   The royal couple chose John Habgood, the archbishop of York and
second-ranking prelate in the Church of England, to christen their
daughter.

   Doubleday has acquired the English publishing
rights to 14 books by Naguib Mahfouz, the Egyptian writer who won
the 1988 Nobel Prize in literature, and to a book on architecture by
Britain's Prince Charles.
   Jacqueline Onassis, a Doubleday editor, and Alberto Vitale,
president and chief executive officer of the Bantam Doubleday Dell
Publishing Group, who lived in Egypt for many years, acquired the
rights to Mahfouz's works from The American University in Cairo
Press, the publishing house said.
   It was not immediately known how much Doubleday paid to acquire
the English rights to the works by Mahfouz and Prince Charles. The
publishing house could not be reached after office hours Monday for
comment.
   Doubleday said last week that the company will publish 14 books
by the 77-year-old Mahfouz, the first writer in the Arabic language
to win the Nobel Prize in literature.
   It will publish a collection of his short stories and 13 of his
novels, four of which have never been published in English.
   Charles' book, ``A Vision of Britain: A Personal View of
Architecture,'' is based on his recent television documentary, which
sharply criticized modern architecture in Britain. The British
publishing rights were acquired by Doubleday U.K., a division of
Transworld Publishers Ltd. London.
