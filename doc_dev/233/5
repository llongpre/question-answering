   Drawing on royal precedent, the Duke and Duchess
of York have named their 2-week-old daughter Beatrice Elizabeth
Mary, Buckingham Palace said Monday.
   The princess' names are from Queen Victoria's youngest child,
the present queen and her mother, and the duke's great-grandmother,
Queen Mary.
   The baby, who is at the royal summer retreat in Scotland with
her parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah, and the queen, will be known
as Her Royal Highness The Princess Beatrice of York.
   She is fifth in line to the throne and the first child for the
Duke and Duchess of York.
   The announcement of her name ended energetic speculation, which
long preceded her Aug. 8 birth. One major bookmaker closed his
books for a time when a newspaper quoted Andrew as saying one day
in May that the baby would be a girl named Annabel.
   But Annabel continued to remain a favorite among bettors, along
with Charlotte and Victoria. Not a single bet was placed on
Beatrice at two of the country's largest bookmakers, they said with
delight.
   ``It's terrific. We couldn't have chosen a better name,'' said
Graham Sharp of William Hill bookmakers, which offered Beatrice at
100 to 1 odds. ``We cleaned up every which way.''
   ``It is a bit of a surprise for everybody,'' said Malcolm Palmer
of Coral Bookmakers. ``Victoria and Elizabeth were the two
favorites.''
   The only correct entry in the public guessing game came from
Britain's largest-circulation newspaper, the tabloid Sun, which
reported all three names Friday.
   The newspaper said Annabel had been the first choice of Andrew
and Sarah, but the queen, who must approve royal names, rejected it
as too ``yuppie,'' and suggested Beatrice.
   The last Princess Beatrice among British royals was the youngest
of Queen Victoria's nine children.
   The Sun reported the name was royal enough for the queen but
unusual enough to please Sarah.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publisher of Burke's Peerage, said Sarah
was pleased because she likes old-fashioned names.
   The baby's second name honors her grandmother, the queen, and
her great-grandmother, Queen Mother Elizabeth. Her third name,
Mary, is the name of the duke's great-grandmother Queen Mary, wife
of King George V, as well as the middle name of Sarah's mother,
Susan Barrantes.
   Buckingham Palace said no date had been announced for the
christening.
   Prince Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, is due to return soon to
his ship, HMS Edinburgh, in the Far East following a leave of
absence.
