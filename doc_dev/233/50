   Sarah, the Duchess of York, better known
as ``Fergie,'' has received a scolding from a suburban Chicago
dermatologist who contends her visits to a tanning parlor set a bad
example.
   The former Sarah Ferguson who is married to Britain's Prince
Andrew is especially prone to sun damage because of her fair
complexion and Celtic ancestry, said Dr. Michael Greenberg.
   Greenberg said he wrote to the duchess after reading in People
magazine about her tanning parlor visits.
   ``I am astounded that an intelligent woman such as yourself
would, first consent to tan her skin considering the increase in
skin cancer caused by ultraviolet (rays) and, second, let yourself
be an example for the millions of ordinary, gullible women who
follow whatever a member of the royal family does as though it were
gospel,'' Greenberg wrote.
   The duchess and her husband, both 28, are on a 10-day visit to
California. They are expecting their first child in August.
   ``I think she would be grateful for his concern,'' said Francis
Cornish, a spokesman for the British Consulate in Los Angeles,
which delivered the letter Tuesday to the duchess' private
secretary.
   The duchess and her husband plan to leave Los Angeles on Friday
for a two-day stay in the desert resort Palm Springs, Calif.,
before heading back to Britain, Cornish said.
