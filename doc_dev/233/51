   The Duchess of York visited an inner-city school
Monday, ending a five-day trip to Texas that included opera, a polo
match and a stop at a private ranch.
   The former Sarah Ferguson took part in an anti-drug program, and
was serenaded by more than 600 students at Blackshear Elementary
School.
   ``She seemed like royalty,'' said fifth-grader Gary Williams, 11.
   The duchess, who is married to Britain's Prince Andrew, came to
Houston Thursday at the invitation of the Houston Grand Opera,
which is saluting 300 years of British opera. She took a flight
Monday afternoon to New York, where she planned to spend a day.
   Royal-watchers who gathered outside the school Monday morning
applauded her, and some shouted, ``We love you Fergie!''
   The duchess participated in the school's Drug Abuse Resistance
Education program, known as DARE, by joining students in an
anti-drug play.
   She also gave the school's library autographed copies of the
``Budgie'' books for children she has written. Students presented
her a book they had written.
   ``We thought she was very fun,'' Gary said. ``We were excited to
see her. She did some sketches with us.''
   The sketches involved students acting out criticism for students
who are pretending to drink, smoke or use drugs.
   During one sketch, the duchess showed her disgust for smoking by
pulling her long red hair across her face.
   ``I think she was really concerned about the program,'' said
Blackshear principal George Mundine. ``She was very impressed.''
   The duchess then went to the school playground where students
holding small U.S. and British flags were standing in a formation
that spelled DARE.
   ``Your Royal Highness, the Duchess of York, from the boys and
girls of Blackshear School, may I present to you these flowers and
ask for your permission to sing?'' shouted 8-year-old Jermaine
Thibodeaux, who gave the duchess a bouquet of yellow roses.
   The students sang ``Deep in the Heart of Texas,'' ``Yankee
Doodle Dandy,'' ``You're a Grand Old Flag,'' ``We are the World,''
and an anti-drug song.
   ``You really were very good, and are very good, and you look so
smart,'' the duchess said.
   She thanked the students for the book, ``The Big Parade,'' and
said her toddler daughter, Beatrice, would love it. The book, which
is about the duchess going to the circus, was written by several
students, Mundine said.
   The duchess is five months pregnant with her second child.
   During her stay in Houston, Sarah was the guest of the family of
Oscar Wyatt, chairman of Coastal Corp. of Houston. His wife, Lynn,
is vice chairman of the Houston Grand Opera.
   She spent Saturday night at the Wyatts' ranch near Hebbronville,
but stayed the rest of the time at their mansion.
   The duchess attended a polo match Sunday, where Great Britain
defeated a Texas team, 11-6. Her father, Maj. Ronald Ferguson,
captained the British team and she stood in the rain to present
trophies to the victors.
