   Sarah, the Duchess of York, has written two
children's books based on her experiences as a pilot, Simon &amp;
Schuster said Thursday.
   ``Budgie the Little Helicopter,'' and ``Budgie at Bendick's
Point,'' aimed at children ages 3 to 6, will be published Sept. 11.
   Budgie was the nickname the duchess gave the Jet Ranger
helicopter she trained on in 1987.
   In the books, Budgie has a pal, Pippa, modeled after the Piper
Warrior the duchess used while working toward her private pilot's
license. Another character is Lionel the Lynx; the duchess's
husband, Prince Andrew, is a pilot in the Royal Navy and frequently
flies Lynx helicopters.
   ``Budgie the Little Helicopter,'' dedicated to the author's
daughter, Princess Beatrice, centers on the kidnapping and rescue of
a child named Rose. The child's surname, Wright, is the maiden name
of the duchess's mother.
   The second book, ``Budgie at Bendick's Point,'' is dedicated to
Andrew. Bendicks is the name of a dog that Andrew gave Fergie.
   John Richardson illustrated the books, priced at $9.95. The books
will be excerpted in the September issue of Redbook magazine.
