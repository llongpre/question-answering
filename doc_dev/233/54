<HEAD>Tabloids Rap Yorks' Pay Increase</HEAD>

   London's tabloid newspapers today criticized the 79
percent pay raise granted the Duke and Duchess of York in the
government's new budget.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said Tuesday the couple
will receive state income of nearly $266,000 for the fiscal year
beginning April 1, up from $148,000 this year.
   It is the second year in a row that Andrew _ Queen Elizabeth II's
second son _ and his wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, received
larger increases than other members of the royal family.
   ``That's Rich!'' said the headline in The Daily Express. ``This
is the second year running the couple have hit the jackpot.''
   ``Young Yorks Rise Is 10 Times Rate Of Inflation,'' said Today.
   ``69,000 For Andy (And Nigel Gives The Rest Of Us Just 4.35 A
Week),'' said The Sun, Britain's largest circulating newspaper.
   The other members of the royal family received a 4.6 percent
raise, lower than the annual inflation rate of 7.5 percent. The
increases raised the family's direct cost to the nation to
$10,594,000.
   The queen and her 10 closest relatives receive funds annually
from the Civil List section of the budget. The money, payment for
carrying out official duties such as receiving ambassadors,
presenting awards and foreign tours, goes mostly toward staff
salaries and household expenses.
   The treasury said the raise for the Duke and Duchess of York will
pay for their office at Buckingham Palace. The office has been
funded by savings from Andrew's past Civil List entitlements, but
that money has run out, the treasury said.
   Andrew also receives nearly $36,000 plus allowances for his job
as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy.
   Andrew and Sarah have been criticized for taking too many
holidays and carrying out too few public engagements. Harold
Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, predicted they
would be much busier this year.
   ``No member of the royal family has an increased income from the
Civil List unless it is believed that he or she will receive many
more duties in the future,'' Brooks-Baker said.
