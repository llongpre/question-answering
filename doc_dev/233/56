   A 10-day visit to California by Britain's
Prince Andrew and his wife, ``Fergie,'' the Duchess of York, will
be full of public events, but no security problems are expected, a
British Consulate official says.
   The couple, scheduled to arrive late this afternoon, will attend
exhibitions and concerts that are part of UK@LA '88, a
three-month-long British arts festival, said Angus Mackay, the
royal visit press officer. They also will attend banquets and visit
schools, stores, an aircraft carrier and churches from Los Angeles
to Palm Springs.
   When Andrew, the third child of Queen Elizabeth II, visited Los
Angeles four years ago he was a bachelor naval officer who lived up
to a rowdy reputation by playfully turning a paint sprayer on the
press corps. Since then, he married the former Sarah Ferguson, who
is pregnant, so the current visit promises to be more staid.
   The first event planned for the royal couple is a welcoming
ceremony Saturday at Los Angeles City Hall featuring a performance
by the rock group Los Lobos, which gained fame in the movie ``La
Bamba.''
