   Britain's Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah,
began their official 10-day Southern California visit Saturday in a
typical freeway traffic jam that delayed their arrival at a City
Hall welcoming ceremony by 25 minutes.
   The car carrying the Duke and Duchess of York had to take a
detour around the jam on the trip from the royal yacht Britannia,
moored in Long Beach, 25 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. The
traffic snarl was caused by an accident on the Santa Monica Freeway.
   When the royal couple arrived at City Hall, they were cheered by
about 1,000 people, some of them waving British flags, and Mayor
Tom Bradley welcomed them in the City Council chambers. The day's
events Saturday also included visits to Chinatown and a school for
the performing arts.
   Andrew and Sarah were in town to launch UK-LA '88, a three-month
celebration of British culture and commercial achievement.
   ``The United Kingdom has sent the diversity of its cultural life
to share with us,'' Bradley told them. ``We count it a very special
honor that you have joined us on this occasion.''
   Andrew stressed the couple's participation in launching UK-LA
'88, which he described as an ``ambitious, cultural collaborative
venture'' between Los Angeles and British art groups.
   During their stay, Andrew and Sarah are expected to attend a
number of the festival's 60 cultural events featuring British and
American artists.
   Noting that he and his wife will visit the aircraft carrier USS
Nimitz at sea during their visit, the prince cited common military
obligations shared by the two nations around the world.
   ``For us, our visit to one of your ships will remind us of those
many parts of the world in Central Europe, in the Persian Gulf and
elsewhere in which your armed forces and ours stand side by side in
common defense or our shared democratic values,'' said the prince,
a Royal Navy helicopter pilot.
   The City Hall reception featured songs by Los Lobos, an East Los
Angeles group that gave its musical bounce to last year's hit film
about Ritchie Valens, who died in a 1959 plane crash with rock
legend Buddy Holly.
   Los Lobos performed two songs, including the rollicking Spanish
song that Valens immortalized, ``La Bamba,'' from which last year's
movie title was taken. Sarah, 28, who is expected the couple's
first child in August, kept time with her left heel.
   After the City Hall welcome, the royal pair toured nearby
Chinatown under light rain.
   Sandy Wong, a Chinatown resident originally from Hong Kong, said
people who hail from that British colony have a special affection
for the royal couple, and she confessed to being particularly
impressed by Andrew.
   ``He's really better looking than the pictures,'' said Mrs.
Wong, 49.
   The royal couple applauded politely during a performance by
elementary school students in a small square. The boys performed a
lion dance and the girls a parasol dance.
   The next stop was a quick visit to the 32nd Street School, a
``magnet'' school for performing arts, where the couple was treated
to dance performances, jazz music and skits.
   ``Well done,'' Sarah told the young dancers and musicians before
the couple sat in on a medieval history lesson to discuss life in a
castle.
   One student asked if there were still dungeons in Windsor
Castle, the official residence of the British ruling family.
   There used to be dungeons in one part of the castle, Andrew
responded, but ``there is no use for dungeons nowadays, so they've
been brought up to date _ they're now a disco.''
   Another student asked about the most important responsibility of
being a duchess.
   ``Hope you've got a pad and pencil,'' Sarah quipped, then added,
``Oh, my husband. He comes first and then my life.''
   As a parting gift, students gave the couple three school
T-shirts _ one baby-size. The couple's first child is due in August.
   For lunch, the duke and duchess dined on smoked quail and
grilled Pacific salmon in a restaurant atop a downtown high-rise.
The luncheon crowd was dotted with show business personalities,
including Ed Begley Jr. of television's ``St. Elsewhere'' and
singer Marilyn McCoo, host of the ``Solid Gold'' rock music TV
show. Later, there was an off-the-record reception for news media
representatives on the royal yacht.
   The royal couple flew in from London on Friday afternoon,
arriving to spring-like weather five years to the day after the
start of a similar tour by Andrew's parents, Queen Elizabeth II and
Prince Philip, that was marred by rough weather.
   Security personnel experienced some tense moments Friday when
they discovered a suspicious-looking briefcase about a block from
where the yacht Britannia was docked. A State Department bomb unit
blew it up.
   ``It was no bomb,'' said a British consulate spokeswoman who did
not want her name used.
