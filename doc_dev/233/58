   Actor and animal lover Ed Asner gave a sendoff
to about 190 people with dogs before a three-mile walk to raise
money for a program that puts dogs into nursing homes as therapy
for the elderly and disabled.
   Asner, who is appearing in a production of ``Born Yesterday'' at
the Mechanic Theatre, last week visited the Keswick Home with
Sterling the cat, a regular ambassador for Pets On Wheels.
   ``I can imagine the joy you bring into the hearts and minds of
people in hospitals,'' Asner, who sported a T-shirt and kerchief
with the Pets on Wheels logo, said Sunday. ``Pets are the
four-legged flowers of our lives.''
   He was declared an honorary volunteer and presented with gifts,
including a small bag of food for his two cats back in California.
   ``It's true that actors on the road do get hungry now and
then,'' Asner joked, eyeing the bag.
   The event raised $13,500 in pledges and donations.

   The Duchess of York will extend her Australian
visit by two weeks so she can spend more time with her husband,
Prince Andrew, who is on Royal Navy duty there, Buckingham Palace
said Monday.
   The couple's 10-week-old daughter, Princess Beatrice, will
remain in England with her nanny.
   ``The duchess will be remaining in Australia for the duration of
the Royal Navy Task Group deployment,'' the palace said in a
statement.
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, left Britain on Sept. 21
for a 10-day official tour to help celebrate Australia's
bicentennial.
   When the tour ended Oct. 7, she spent several days visiting her
sister, Jane Makin, who lives in Australia. She then flew to
Tasmania to join Andrew, a lieutenant on the destroyer Edinburgh,
when it docked in the state capital of Hobart.
   Andrew, second oldest son of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, is
earning his watchkeeping and ocean navigation certificates.

   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy was honored for his work to
help gain the release of Soviet refuseniks.
   Action for Soviet Jewry presented Kennedy, D-Mass., with its
Freedom Award for lobbying the Kremlin on behalf of such Soviet
emigrees as Benjamin Charny and Yuri Zieman.
   The senator told an awards banquet Sunday he is encouraged by
the recent emigration of Soviet Jews, but is cautious about
indications that several stumbling blocks to emigration may soon be
dropped.
   ``There is some reason to hope that the Soviets will finally
open the gates of emigration and end the harsh persecution of their
Jewish citizens,'' Kennedy said in prepared remarks.
   ``But nothing is certain, and as long as teachers of Hebrew are
arrested, as long as books of Jewish learning are confiscated, as
long as innocent human beings are persecuted because of their
belief in the God of their fathers, none of us can be silent or
uninvolved.''

   Queen Elizabeth arrived Monday on the
first-ever visit of a reigning British monarch to Spain with just
one obstacle clouding the horizon: the Rock of Gibraltar.
   The Queen was met at the airport by two relatives, Crown Prince
Felipe and Princess Elena, and drove with them and the Duke of
Edinburgh through streets decked with red and yellow Spanish flags
and red, blue and white Union Jacks to El Pardo Palace, the
residence for state guests, on the outskirts of Madrid.
   There she was received with full military honors by her third
cousin, King Juan Carlos, Queen Sofia and members of the government
of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   The five-day tour, which includes trips to Seville and Barcelona
and two private days on the Mediterranean island of Majorca, is
being hailed by the Spanish press as the final step in the
normalization of relations between the two countries that began
with Juan Carlos' visit to Britain in April 1986 and has been
coaxed along by members of Europe's two most important royal
families.
   The 62-year-old British monarch and the 50-year-old Spanish king
are third cousins through Britain's Queen Victoria.
   Press and radio commentators have noted that Britain is the only
country in the world with which Spain still maintains a major
dispute _ sovereignty over Gibraltar.
   The Rock was ceded to Britain by treaty in 1713 when Spain lost
the War of Spanish Succession.
   The Queen and Juan Carlos were expected to talk about Gibraltar,
but ``this will not be a political discussion, of course,'' said a
British source who asked to remain anonymous.

   Former CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite
will teach a class of honors students at the University of Texas
this week and will donate a collection of his personal papers to
the university, officials said.
   Cronkite will give UT about 500 boxes of personal papers and
memorabilia related to his career, said Robert Jeffrey, dean of the
College of Communications.
   Cronkite will speak on ethical issues in journalism to students
in the college's new senior fellows program, an interdisciplinary
program for students with high academic and writing skills.
   He will serve as a guest lecturer during the class Monday
through Wednesday.
   Cronkite attended UT from 1933 to 1935 before dropping out to
work full time as a reporter in Houston. He holds the title of
adjunct professor at UT and was the first recipient of the College
of Communication's Dewitt Carter Reddick Award.
