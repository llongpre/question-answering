<LEADPARA>  THE sight of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip and the rest of the British
royal family waving from the front upstairs balcony at Buckingham Palace is
familiar. What's totally unfamiliar are the rooms behind that balcony -- the
palace interior.;   There is the frieze-filled Centre Room, where the royal
family lines up before walking out on the balcony. There is the Music Room,
with its domed ceiling and hardwood floors, where Princess Diana practiced her
tap dancing. And there is guest bedroom number No. 236, with its canopied bed,
pink silk walls and a cozy-looking but never used fireplace.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     These rooms and the lifestyles of those who live in and pass through them
are the focus of "Inside Buckingham Palace, The Private World of the Royal
Family" by Andrew Morton (Summit Books, $20). This coffee-table style book,
with its beautiful photographs, is hard to put down, even if you don't follow
all the gossip about the royal family.;   "People see Buckingham Palace as a
personification of mystery and majesty," says Morton, who has spent more than
a decade chronicling the comings and goings of Charles, Diana, Fergie and
all.;   "The palace is the center for national rejoicing and sorrow," he says.
"It was the place people ran to on the day the second World War ended. It's a
national rallying point and the royal family has come to symbolize universal
values of duty, obligation and family life.";   Life inside the palace,
according to Morton, is as different and extreme as any commoner might expect.
It takes three days to set the table for a major banquet, using place settings
valued at $5,400 each, and another three days to wash up. A system of traffic
lights keeps the footmen, pages and butlers who serve and clear from
colliding. And there are two men who do nothing but tend to the winding and
servicing of the 300 clocks in the house.;   There are rooms set aside for
everything from television and radio broadcasts to a bedroom for the queen's
pet corgi dogs. One of the most fascinating is the Gift Room, so-called
because this is where the queen goes to choose gifts she wants to give
someone.;   "It's her own personal shop inside the palace," Morton says.
"Obviously she hasn't time to go shopping. There is lots of porcelain and the
gifts range from the simplest things like a waste basket to little silver
holders you put glasses of tea in.";   Morton divides the interior of the
palace into three areas. "The staff areas are like government offices or the
back rooms of a large hotel, without any glitter or glitz. There are the state
apartments which have polish -- red carpet, mirrors, Regency furniture and
gilt. And the private quarters, which are more comfortable and cozy." The
latter, he says, "contain the kinds of things they like -- pink carnations in
the queen's room and pictures she's chosen herself. Fergie's room has teddy
bears and a helicopter helmet and Fisher-Price toys all over the place.";   In
describing the private areas, Morton makes no attempt to hide his disdain for
the fact that Fergie has almost no closet space. "It's ridiculous -- you have
the premier duchess in the land with her clothes on hangers outside in the
red-carpeted corridor, but she likes Buckingham Palace because it's
comfortable, near her friends, away from prying eyes, and she can enjoy
herself away from the public.";   Authoritative as he is on Buckingham Palace,
Morton's visits have been confined to a narrow area that does not include even
the Centre Room, let alone the private quarters he describes in such vivid
detail.;   "After every book I write, the courtiers have a little inquiry on
how on earth I got such accurate information," he boasts. "It's because of
contacts. I've cultivated people in key positions like any specialist would.";
  Would Morton pay for information?;   He pauses slightly and says, "I'd
haggle.";   A testimony to his sleuthing is the detailed floor plan of the
principal and bedroom floors of the palace. "It's not well-known at all, but I
wanted to print the layout of the private quarters so people could get an idea
of it," he says.;   Morton has yet to hear what the queen or Scotland Yard
thinks about it, but he is pleased to reveal that one of his previous books,
about the Royal Yacht Britannia, was such a hit that "the queen gave lots of
copies away as Christmas presents.";   While they live in lavish surroundings,
the royal family is anything but lavish in their personal spending habits.
"There is no conspicuous consumption in the way of Donald Trump or that
Helmsley woman (Leona)," Morton says. "It's not the kind of family where you
could accuse them of living extravagantly. Everything is of the finest
quality, but they keep whatever they have for a long time, longer than you and
I.";   Fan that he admits he is, Morton still believes the economy kick is
taken too far at times. "It's ridiculous," he says. "You have Diana and Fergie
and the children using a local hotel's swimming pool because the queen hasn't
spent the money on a pool at Balmoral. It's the same at Sandringham. You have
the richest woman in the world not having a swimming pool!";   The pampered
life led by the queen and her family, with someone always there to run the
bath water, lay out their clothes and help them dress, has made them, in
Morton's words, "a bit helpless. They're institutionalized. I don't mean that
in a nasty or negative way. Quite frankly, I'd feel a bit daunted if my day's
schedule said at 10:30 you'll hold an investiture, at noon you'll meet an
ambassador, at 2 you meet the prime minister, at 3 you do a walkabout and that
evening you host a dinner. If you've never done it before in your life, it's
the same way if you've never run a bath or pressed your clothes. They're bred
to a certain kind of function.";   Morton started covering the royal family
while working as a Fleet Street reporter.;   Three years ago Morton gave up
his newspaper job to start Palace Press, which specializes in covering the
royal family. He readily agrees most people view the topic he has chosen as
"very trivial, but once you get into it, it's a very interesting subject
because it touches on many areas of society from an anthropological,
sociological and historical viewpoint.";   While Morton's latest book is on
the palace itself and the lifestyle within the walls, you can't resist asking
his opinion of the constant rumors about Prince Charles and Princess Diana's
marriage.;   "There's always going to be rumors because of the 13-year age
gap," he says. "They have separate interests, a separate circle of friends and
separate timetables. I saw them in Canada, but they didn't seem to be happy.
Only people within a marriage can say how it is from day to day and month to
month."  </TEXT>
