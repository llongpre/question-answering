   Prince Andrew arrived at a London hospital today
with a bouquet of red roses to visit his wife, Sarah, and their
newborn daughter as delighted Britons celebrated the princess'
birth on an especially lucky day.
   Champagne corks popped, bells rang and cameras flashed outside
Portland Hospital in central London with the announcement Monday
night of the birth of a 6-pound, 12-ounce girl to Andrew, the Duke
of York, and his red-haired duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson.
   Two army units fired simultaneous 41-gun salutes in Hyde Park
and at Tower Green near the Tower of London this afternoon
celebrating the royal birth.
   The Princess of York, who has not yet been named, is their first
child and the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Jane Makim, the duchess' elder sister who lives in Australia,
told British reporters that her mother, Susan Barrantes, who was at
the hospital for the birth, had telephoned to say the baby was very
alert, had elegant hands and ``a petite little face ... just fit
for a princess.
   ``My mother said the baby is beautiful. Just a nice weight and
everything. Not much hair but very pretty,'' Mrs. Makim said.
   Andrew, sporting a yellow rose in the lapel of his dark blue
suit, smiled and waved to a large crowd of journalists and several
dozen well-wishers before going inside the American-owned Portland
Hospital.
   Only 24 hours earlier, he had looked somber and anxious as he
drove his 28-year-old wife to the hospital from the country home
west of London which they are renting from King Hussein of Jordan.
   Dr. Anthony Kenney, the duchess' obstetrician, was also at the
hospital today. He led a team of four doctors in the delivery room.
   Hundreds of people on their way to work this morning stopped off
at Buckingham Palace to see the brief notice posted on the gates
announcing the baby's birth.
   Polish student Arek Ilnicki went straight there after arriving
in London. ``I think the English are a bit mad about the baby. But
it's good.''
   Andrew, the 28-year-old second son of the monarch and a Royal
Navy lieutenant, flew to London on Sunday from Singapore where he
is on sea duty on HMS Edinburgh. News of the birth was announced to
the ship's crew and the prince's fellow officers immediately
toasted to the health of the baby and parents.
   The Buckingham Palace statement announcing the birth said the
Duchess of York was ``safely delivered of a daughter at 8:18 p.m..''
   The statement said the delivery was ``a normal birth'' and
`there were no complications.'' Neither the palace nor the doctors
would say whether the birth had been induced, as newspapers had
speculated.
   Andrew was present at his daughter's birth, the palace said.
British press reports said the prince, an accomplished amateur
photographer, took the first photos of his daughter.
   There was much speculation over the baby's name, with Elizabeth
and Victoria as favorites. Early in his wife's pregnancy Andrew had
been quoted as saying the baby would be called Annabel.
   Whatever the choice, the baby will be Her Royal Highness,
Princess (name) of York. She is fifth in line to the throne behind
Andrew's older brother, Prince Charles, Charles' two children
Prince William and Prince Harry, and Andrew himself. The queen's
two other grandchildren, Peter and Zara Phillips, are the children
of her only daughter, Anne.
   The baby's birth at 18 minutes past 8 on the eighth day of the
eighth month of the century's 88th year is being taken by
well-wishers as a sign of great good fortune. The day is considered
highly auspicious by Cantonese-speaking Chinese, whose word for
eight is similar to that for prosperity.
   The Times of London headline said: ``At 8:18 on 8.8.88 _ A Safe
and Lucky Royal Birth.'' The tabloid Sun said: ``Fergie's first
baby has been blessed with the century's luckiest birthday.''
   A message of congratulation from Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and her husband, Denis, who are visiting Bangkok, read:
``It is wonderful news and your happiness will be shared by the
whole nation.''
   It was not known how soon the queen and her husband, Prince
Philip, would see the baby. The queen has public engagements in
Scotland today and is cruising off the Scottish coast in the royal
yacht Britannia.
   The Queen Mother Elizabeth is on vacation in Scotland.
   Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, and their sons go to the
Spanish island of Majorca this week for a vacation with the Spanish
royal family.
