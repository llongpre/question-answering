   Prince Andrew and his pregnant wife, Sarah,
lingered over a museum incubator but declined to cuddle the kicking
mechanical infant inside Monday, the fourth day of a 10-day trade
trip by the royal entourage.
   The couple awoke aboard the 416-foot royal yacht Britannia
beneath typically British gray skies with rain stalking their
motorcade to a museum, department store and a supermarket sojourn
described as a first royal visit to an American supermarket.
   It was retail day for the Duke and Duchess of York.
   The day began with Andrew welcoming top U.S executives for an
investment seminar on the royal yacht, aimed at attracting American
money to Britain. The couple then went ashore.
   The incubator was the final stop on the royal couple's walk
through the Los Angeles County Museum of Science and Industry,
which also included a tour of an exhibit on British technology.
Despite repeated entreaties from a British photographer, Sarah
wouldn't pick up the kicking pink babe, dubbed Samantha by the
exhibitors.
   ``Can you believe them?'' she asked her guides, laughing at the
jostling crowd of newsmen kept in check by a chain barrier and U.S.
State Department security guards. The duchess is expecting a child
in August.
   At the Vons Pavilions market, a deluxe, high-tech supermarket in
suburban Arcadia, the duchess tasted coffee-toffee-chip ice cream
and turned up her nose at a corn dog, and both she and the prince
tried their hand at cake decorating as they cruised the aisles.
   Earlier, Andrew told U.S. executives that Anglo-American
business bonds are as important as historical and cultural ties.
   Britain wants American investments, the Duke of York said during
a brief appearance before 80 delegates attending a daylong
investment seminar aboard the royal yacht Britannia, which included
a five-hour luncheon cruise.
   Greetings from Queen Elizabeth II were relayed by Sir Paul
Greening, chairman of the royal household.
   ``The queen says she hopes you have a worthwhile day. The queen
has personally chosen what you'll have for lunch today,'' said
Greening, who didn't divulge the menu.
   ``The economic ties between our two nations are no less
important than our cultural ones,'' Andrew said.
   There were delegates from such companies as Hewlett-Packard,
Hughes Aircraft, Ford Motor Co., Apple Computers and Lockheed
Aircraft. Among them was Henry Termeer of Boston-based Genzyme, a
biotechnology firm.
   ``It's definitely a public relations ploy to create good will. I
think it's an excellent idea. Every European country does this sort
of thing, but not every country has a royal family with a ship like
this,'' said Termeer.
   The day's events also included a visit to Bullocks Wilshire
department store, which was touting British goods.
   Celebrities Michael York, Morgan Fairchild and Roddy McDowell
and hundreds of store employees were among those who greeted the
royal couple's arrival at the posh art deco landmark.
   At one point during the tour, the duchess scanned the first
floor vestibule and was asked by a guest if she was looking for her
husband, who had gone ahead. ``No, I see him every day,'' Sarah
replied.
   Monday evening, the royal couple took a moonlit stroll through
the lush Wetherly Gardens at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles.
   The cocktail party was tossed by British Consul General Donald
Ballentyne, and guests who noshed on hors d'oeuvres and sipped
champagne included ``Dynasty'' actress Emma Samms and actor Vincent
Price.
