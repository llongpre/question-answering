<HEAD>Security Man Drags Fergie To Safety As Ship Cable Snaps</HEAD>

   A security man dragged the Duchess of
York to safety Wednesday when a steel cable tying her husband's
warship to the wharf snapped, narrowly missing the couple, officials
said.
   The potentially serious accident occurred as Sarah stood chatting
on Fremantle Port's Victoria Quay, with Prince Andrew, who was on a
lower deck of his ship HMS Edinburgh.
   The 2-inch steel hawser, which helped secure the ship to the
dock, snapped with a crack toward the bow of the guided-missile
destroyer and snaked back along the ship's side.
   A television reporter said the duchess was less than 10 feet away
and a detective with Sarah, hearing the noise, grabbed her by the
arm and pulled her back from the side of the dock as the steel rope
went past.
   ``It was pretty close,'' said a dock worker.
   Channel 7 television said Prince Andrew and other crew members
ducked for cover as the cable smashed into the ship's hull. It said
Andrew appeared angry at the incident and had ``stern words'' with
an enlisted man.
   The couple soon recovered their composure and waved white
handkerchiefs at each other as the ship sailed out on schedule.
   The duchess was to leave for London later Wednesday after a visit
that came under strong criticism from British newspapers over her
decision to leave her newborn daughter at home in the care of a
nanny.
   The duchess encountered controversy after extending an official
10-day bicentennial visit by another four weeks while she followed
her husband around to various ports.
   Prince Andrew is expected back in Britain on Dec. 16.
