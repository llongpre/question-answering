<HEAD>Alleged Security Breach at Royals' House Investigated</HEAD>

   An apparent security breach at the house being
built for the Duke and Duchess of York is under investigation,
Buckingham Palace said Tuesday.
   The Daily Mirror said a part-time security guard escorted a
reporter through the house in Sunninghill Park adjoining Windsor
Great Park, 22 miles west of London.
   It said the guard had approached the paper asking for a $12,000
payment in exchange for a tour of the house and security system.
The paper said it refused to pay him anything.
   The Mirror said the $9 million house included a bulletproof room
for emergencies, electronic monitors inside and outside, and alarm
buttons installed throughout.
   Queen Elizabeth II's second son, Prince Andrew, and his wife,
the former Sarah Ferguson, are expected to move into the two-story
house in October.
   ``The matter is being looked into. Obviously we don't discuss
security,'' said a Buckingham Palace spokesman, who was not named
in keeping with British custom.
   Carterton Security Services, which employed the guard who
allegedly gave the newspaper the tour, refused to comment on the
report.
   Thames Valley police, responsible for security at the house, and
Scotland Yard, which provides personal protection for the Duke and
Duchess, also refused to comment.
