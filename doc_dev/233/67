   Queen Elizabeth II and her 11 relatives received
an average 4.6 percent pay raise in Tuesday's annual government
budget. Prince Andrew will get the biggest increase _ 73 percent.
   In all, the Civil List section of the budget allocated
$10,241,000 to the royal family. Queen Elizabeth received $8.3
million.
   The Civil List, announced in Parliament by Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, gave the queen and nine other members of
the royal family 4 percent raises.
   But 28-year-old Prince Andrew's pay went from $92,500 to
$159,100. The share of Prince Edward, 24, who has been receiving
$37,000, remained unchanged.
   The government said Andrew's allowance, which more than doubled
after he married Sarah Ferguson in July 1986 and became the Duke of
York, was insufficent to meet his royal expenses.
   Before marrying his allowance had stood unchanged since 1972.
   Andrew also earns $32,400 a year as a Royal Air Force instructor
in helicopter warfare.
   His new allowance pushed up the royal family's appropriation up
4.6 percent from $9,785,600 last year. The current inflation rate
is 3.3 percent.
   Money Magazine last month listed the 61-year-old queen as
Britain's richest person, estimating her personal fortune at $5.87
billion.
   Queen Mother Elizabeth, 87, received the second-largest sum of
$722,050 in the budget. Queen Elizabeth's husband, Prince Philip,
received $402,750.
   The Civil List does not include such items as running the royal
yacht Britannia or royal aircraft, or money for Prince Charles, the
39-year-old heir who gave up his share to live on income from land
and investments.
   Royal family members officiate at public ceremonies and
represent Britain abroad in many trips each year. Published reports
have estimated that the country spends at least six times the Civil
List sum on the monarchy.
   Staff costs account for up to 75 percent of the Civil List,
Buckingham Palace said. Salaries in the royal households correspond
whenever possible to their equivalents in the civil service, a
spokesman said.
