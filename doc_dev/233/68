   Photographers clambered for pictures of
the Duchess of York as swirling winds played havoc Sunday with her
skirt and hat during an opening ceremony at a botanical garden
southwest of Sydney.
   The Duchess, along with husband Prince Andrew, was guest of
honor at the opening of the still uncompleted Mount Annan botanical
gardens in suburban Campbelltown.
   The royal couple, on the third day of their four-day Sydney
visit, toured the less-than-lush gardens with the duchess grimly
clutching hat and skirt while press photographers swarmed.
   ``Despite the wind, we are still in one piece,'' said Andrew in
his address to officially open the gardens. ``Only just,'' his
wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, chimed in with a grin.
   The royal team got into action a few minutes later when Prince
Andrew took to the shovel and the duchess to the sprinkler to plant
a baby tree.

   The trio Tony Orlando and Dawn is
back on stage after an 11-year hiatus and loving performing
together again.
   The group, singing favorites from the mid-1970s such as ``Tie A
Yellow Ribbon 'Round the Old Oak Tree'' and ``Knock Three Times,''
has been performing for two months at the Trump Plaza here.
   Orlando and his backup singers, Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent
Wilson, recalled that they got together again after Orlando called
Ms. Hopkins and said, ``We had something. ... Want to try it
again?''
   Ms. Hopkins responded, ``Why not? I'll call Joyce.''
   ``I didn't know if I had a chance,'' Orlando said in an
interview published Sunday. ``I mean, forgiveness is one thing, but
11 years is 11 years. Joyce had become a mother. Telma was on TV
(``Bosom Buddies,'' ``Gimme a Break''). How would they feel about
going on the road again?''
   ``It was like we've never been apart,'' Ms. Wilson said.
   ``Except for one plus,'' she added. ``We'd grown. This time
around we _ Joyce and I _ had what we didn't have in the '70s. We
had maturity. And we had confidence.''

   The tongues of Music Row gossips are
wagging full speed about songstress K.T. Oslin, but she just laughs
at the tall tales.
   Oslin, most-nominated artist for this year's County Music
Association awards, was told by one industry insider that, ``The
word on you is you're unhappy.''
   One fan-letter writer believes Oslin wears gloves to hide a skin
disease, she said. And the wags are spreading rumors that she won't
allow producer-boyfriend Steve Buckingham to work with other women
in the studio.
   She said workers at her record label, RCA, got the biggest kick
out of rumors that Oslin lied about her age to seem older and to
get more publicity.
   The honest-to-goodness 46-year-old said in a recent interview
she's quite healthy, wouldn't dream of trying to tell Buckingham
whom he can work with and is fairly happy.
   ``It's all just too silly,'' said Oslin, best known for her LP
``80s Ladies.''

   President Ronald Reagan donated a
special medallion to the Boys Club of Wales to help it raise
$507,000 for its 60th anniversary appeal fund, a club spokesman
said Sunday.
   The medallion, marking the 25th anniversary in 1978 of Dwight D.
Eisenhower's presidential inauguration, will be auctioned to raise
money, as will a rare clock donated by Queen Elizabeth II's mother,
Queen Mother Elizabeth, said businessman Jim Paterson, the appeal's
director.
   Paterson said he thought Reagan had turned down his request for
help, but the package containing the medallion was delayed by
Britain's postal strike last month.
   ``The Boys Club movement is very big in America with several in
each major city, and we are thrilled the president has sent us this
very rare medallion,'' Paterson said.

   Steve Reeves, the former Mr. America who played
Hercules in the movies, says Olympic athletes who need steroids to
win should take up something less strenuous, ``like pingpong.''
   Reeves, who was honored by the Association of Oldetime Barbell &amp;
Strongmen at the Downtown Athletic Club on Saturday night, said he
thought the use of steroids was cheating.
   ``Since I won Mr. America about 40 years ago, bodybuilding and
weightlifting have come a long way. But in my opinion, it has come
the wrong way in the last 30 years,'' he said.
   ``I believe if a man does not have enough male hormones in his
body to produce a championship physique or strength, he should take
up some other sport, like pingpong.''
   Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold
medal for the 100-meter dash after drug tests uncovered that he had
used steroids. Nine other Olympic athletes were also disqualified
because of use of various drugs.
