   Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah,
took in a Hollywood glamour tour Tuesday that brought them
face-to-face with a gregarious movie robot, bashful celebrities and
curious everyday folk bearing flowers.
   The duke and duchess, midway through a 10-day Southern
California tour to promote Britain, greeted such actors as Vincent
Price, Roger Moore, Jack Nicholson, Robin Leach, Roddy McDowall,
Pierce Brosnan and Joseph Cotten.
   ``I think they were modern and literate and good-mannered and
were handsome people. I loved being here,'' Cotten said after
pausing with the royal couple at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences.
   Jack Lemmon and Brosnan were visibly nervous, and humbled, by
the meeting.
   ``It gives one butterflies,'' Brosnan said afterward. ``I wasn't
sure about bowing correctly. I didn't know what to say.''
   Lemmon said later that he realized that ``for them it was like
doing a scene over and over about 100 times. ... It is such a
grueling schedule for them. They couldn't have been more charming.''
   The couple had started the day earlier at the Showscan Film Co.
a special effects studio in Culver City.
   ``Greetings, salutations, hello,'' said ``Number 5,'' the impish
robot from the movie ``Short Circuit.'' Attended by a half dozen
technicians, the robot presented Sarah with a bouquet, then spun on
its triangular tank treads and introduced Sarah to company
officials.
   As Sarah entered the building, ``Number 5'' commented: ``Nice
hat.''
   ``Thank you,'' replied the duchess, who also accepted a bouquet
and a rose from fans in the small crowd outside the studio.
   The wildest scene in the studio visit consisted of two
hair-raising rides for Andrew in something called the ``dynamic
animation theater.''
   The prince and seven other people took seats on a hydraulically
operated platform in front of a curved movie screen as a film shot
from the perspective of the front seat in a roller coaster roared
by.
   For the next several minutes, they were jolted up and down,
backward and forward, and finally brought to a lurching halt. The
duchess, who is three months pregnant, watched from a director's
chair, telling her husband later, ``You looked very funny.''
   The royal couple also saw a breakaway bottle smashed harmlessly
over the head of their private secretary, Lt. Col. Sean O'Dwyer.
   The rain that has been dampening crowds for much of the visit
eased for the day's events, which also included a luncheon at the
Bel Age Hotel in West Hollywood that was held by the British
Academy of Film and Television Arts.
   The royals heard actress Anjelica Huston salute British
contributions to film, particularly in comedy. Britons have an
ability ``to puff themselves up to their most British, then burst
the balloon,'' she said.
   Dudley Moore then gently mocked Miss Huston's serious speech,
beginning his remarks: ``Your royal highnesses, extinguished guests
...''
   ``I was reminded of our legacy,'' the British entertainer said.
``The heritage of Shakespeare and Milton that courses through the
veins of every red-blooded English film star who is living now,
very nicely, thank you, in Marina del Rey.''
   The Yorks, both 28, are touring to promote trade and as patrons
of UK@LA '88, a festival of British arts. They are staying aboard
the 416-foot royal yacht Britannia in Long Beach.
