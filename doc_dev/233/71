   The court jester at the Royal Britain Exhibition
made unkind jokes about the royal family and the commercial museum's
managers, not amused, told him to stop or get the sack. He was
suspended Tuesday.
   Kim Keble-White said James Lovell, a 24-year-old actor, could
have his job back if he cut the offending material from his act.
   Lovell, who traveled to and from work in tricorn hat, bells and
quartered red and green outfit, was not available for comment after
the announcement, but said earlier Tuesday he would not alter his
performance.
   In somewhat medieval syntax, Lovell said he realized his boss was
irritated, ``but Lord fool him for being thus inflamed, for I am the
fool, and therefore for him to get inflamed by my foolery makes him
a fool, for sure.''
   ``He is acting with artistic pique,'' declared Keble-White,
marketing director of the exhibition, who said the young jester had
been ``doing a super job'' before turning his wit on contemporary
targets.
   Keble-White said some of Lovell's jokes ``are a little bit tacky
and he doesn't know exactly where to draw the line.''
   For example: ``What is small, silent and lonely and lives in a
stable? Captain Phillips.'' That is a jibe at shy, horse-loving Mark
Phillips, whose separation from his wife, Princess Anne, was
announced last week.
   A parody on the eccentricities of Prince Charles, heir to the
throne, was another feature of Lovell's act for visitors to the
exhibition on British royalty through the ages.
   He did a three-minute monologue of Charles talking to a
sunflower. It was inspired by the prince's revelation some years
back that he talked to his plants to encourage growth.
   Executives of Unicorn Heritage, which owns Royal Britain, say
Lovell was an excellent jester until pointing his japery beyond
medieval royalty.
   ``I said to James, `We'd love you to carry on, old chap, but it
must be jokes of the period,''' Keble-White said in an interview.
   ``I am nervous that some of the jokes could be offensive, and we
want to prevent people from coming here thinking we want to win some
cheap laughs.''
   Lovell responded: ``I've been making a few little rudies. They
come out because I'm a spontaneous jester, my liege, I don't write
my riddles down. I suddenly think of something and if I think of
Fergie as a big red thing then that's, alas, what she is.''
   Fergie is the nickname for the Duchess of York, whose hair is red
and whose waistline is avidly watched by the tabloid press.
   Lovell worked as a clown and stage actor before taking the role
of Will Somers, court jester to Henry VIII jester, in January.
   He acknowledged on London Broadcasting Corp. radio that his duty
was to behave as a medieval clown, but added: ``I am a jester, my
liege, and I, a jester, is licensed to say whatever I wish, so if
they don't like it they can right royally stuff it.''
   Keble-White said he had received no complaints from Buckingham
Palace or the 500,000 people who have visited the exhibition in
London's financial district since it opened in August 1988.
   In depicting British history through royalty, the commercial
museum features the lives of 52 kings and queens.
   It has dummies in period dress and enlargements of contemporary
newspaper front pages with stories on royalty. Visitors can vote on
whether the press treats royals fairly, and Keble-White said the
tide is running against the press.
   Buckingham Palace cooperated in setting up the exhibition, he
said, ``so it's important we not fall from grace'' through Lovell's
antics.
