   Social activist Dick Gregory has gone
nearly six weeks without food to draw attention to illegal drug use.
He says it is just the beginning.
   At a news conference Monday marking 40 days of not eating, he
said he may fast for a year depending on two conditions: his health
and his hunger.
   ``If I get hungry enough, I will eat,'' Gregory said.
   During his fast, he consumes water, fruit juice and a special
vitamin powder.
   Gregory has lost 33 pounds. The Rev. George Clements, a Chicago
priest who's fasting with Gregory, lost 39 pounds.
   ``I went 40 days and I'm hungry. I am eating,'' Clements said.
   Gregory has been in Shreveport since June 6, attempting to drive
drug dealers out of this northwestern Louisiana city of 200,000. He
has staged protests at head shops and camped out in a park often
used for drug deals.

   The Duke and Duchess of York's short stop ended
with eating popcorn in front of a New York diner, standing on a
Paris rooftop and visiting a seedy district of Rome.
   It was all part of an exposition of film sets depicting different
city scenes.
   Prince Andrew and his wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, who asked
to see the Cites-Cines (Cinema Cities) exposition at the Palais de
la Civilisation, walked around the realistic sets, stopping to watch
clips of films.
   The duke ``especially loved the Cafe Lumiere and the Charlie
Chaplin and Jerry Lewis films,'' said Palais spokesman Pierre Royer,
referring to the set of a Paris cafe. The royal couple is on a
13-day tour of Canada.
   The British tabloid press, meanwhile, latched onto an incident
Sunday when the couple were booed at the closing ceremonies of
Quebec City's Summer Festival. The tabloids said the duchess was
close to tears.
   A story published in the Sun, a London newspaper, was headlined:
``Fergie Near Tears as Frogs Boo Her.'' A competing paper, Today,
headlined its story: ``Tour Turns Sour as Fergie Booed by 10,000.''
   The incident drew only passing attention from the Canadian media
and was described by witnesses as a few dozen boos.

   It's a riches-to-rags story for Roseanne
Conner, the wise-cracking mom on ABC's hit comedy ``Roseanne.''
   The show's producers on Tuesday denied rumors that the Conners,
played by Roseanne Barr and John Goodman, would strike it rich in a
lottery. The rumor turned up in a supermarket tabloid.
   Instead, producers Tom Werner and Marcy Carsey told reporters
that Roseanne would be unemployed at the beginning of the new season.
   Roseanne quit her job at the factory during the past season's
last episode.
   ``We think it's a very fertile area, someone who's unemployed,
and the first few scripts we're dealing with that. Obviously, in a
family like this, you need two incomes, so pretty soon Roseanne
Conner is going to find a job,'' Werner said.
   Carsey said Roseanne might possibly get a more upscale job, but
he was unsure.

   The U.S. Customs Service sees gold in an
auction of one of 20 platinum records presented for David Bowie's
album ``Let's Dance.''
   Leroy Elfrank, a Customs official in Lawton, said Tuesday the
record, encased in frame and glass, was found as workers took
inventory of the items to be auctioned Aug. 10 in Jersey City, N.J.
   Elfrank said he doesn't know why Customs had the record or to
whom it belonged. The record could have been seized or abandoned or
perhaps was unreturnable because of a lost mailing label, Elfrank
said.
   He said his office took several measures to track the
authenticity of the item, including talking to record companies and
Bowie's management firm.
   He said the company, Isolar, told him 20 platinum records were
made and that it didn't know the owner. Isolar, however, wanted it.
   ``We told them they could come to the auction and buy it back. It
belongs to the government now,'' Elfrank said.

   Heather Anne McLeod, a Nevada beauty queen, is
competing against the clock to enter the Miss Teen USA pageant.
   National pageant officials disqualified the 18-year-old winner of
the Miss Nevada Teen pageant for competing in two state pageants in
the same year.
   U.S. District Judge Roger Foley on Tuesday declined to order Miss
Universe Inc. to immediately let her compete in the national contest
in San Bernardino, Calif., but he agreed to hear Miss McLeod's
lawsuit against the organization today.
   Time is short: the nationally televised Miss Teen USA pageant's
finals are next Tuesday.
   Foley said it appeared she had grounds to sue over her
disqualification.
   Ms. McLeod said the Nevada pageant application was vague and
didn't understand that she couldn't compete in the California
pageant earlier this year.
   But Kristina Pickering, an attorney representing Miss Universe
Inc., said Ms. McLeod knew the rules and intentionally violated them.
   ``I think it's up to the judge to decide what to do, but I feel
I've won the contest fairly,'' Ms. McLeod said. ``I'd like to do the
best I can for the state of Nevada.''
