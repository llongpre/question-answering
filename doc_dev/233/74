   Prince Charles said a roaring avalanche that
missed him in the Swiss Alps took only seconds to bury two skiing
partners, killing one. He said his skiing party was aware of the
dangers when they left the main trails.
   The Hon. Audrey Lindsay, mother of the dead skier, Maj. Hugh
Lindsay, was quoted today by the British domestic news agency Press
Association as telling a relative: ``I don't blame anybody. It was
an unfortunate accident.''
   Looking distraught and wearing black, Charles, his wife,
Princess Diana, and sister-in-law, Sarah, the Duchess of York,
returned home Friday from Switzerland.
   Their plane, which landed at Northolt air base near London,
carried the coffin containing the body of the 34-year-old Lindsay,
a former aide to Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, and a close
friend of Charles and Diana.
   They were met at the base by Lindsay's widow, Sarah Lindsay, who
is expecting a baby in May. Mrs. Lindsay, a Buckingham Palace press
officer, had helped answer questions about the avalanche before
discovering her husband was killed in it.
   In a handwritten statement read to reporters at Zurich airport
after the royal party left for England, Charles, the heir to the
British throne, said:
   ``All members of my party were skiing off the piste (the regular
ski runs) at own our risk and we all accepted ... that mountains
have to be treated with the greatest respect and not treated
lightly,'' he said.
   He said that when the avalanche Thursday at Klosters,
Switzerland, started ``with a tremendous roaring'' he and three
others in the group skied out its path. The other two, Lindsay and
Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson could not evade the snow slide.
   ``To my horror, Maj. Hugh Lindsay and Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson just
failed to ski clear and were swept away in a whirling maelstrom as
the whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past us to the valley
below,'' the prince said. ``It was all over in a terrifying matter
of seconds.''
   Charles described how he helped dig Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson out of
the snow with a shovel and then with his hands. She broke both legs
and is in a Swiss hospital.
   The 39-year-old prince has been skiing for more than 15 years
and knows the area well where the avalanche occurred. He was
leading the ski party and Press Association quoted police at
Klosters as saying he personally asked Thursday for the party to be
allowed to ski on the perilous slopes where the avalanche later
occurred.
   Charles was praised for helping save the life of Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson. But some British newspapers called him foolhardy
for taking on the dangerous Haglamatte slopes of Klosters.
   Mrs. Lindsay was at Northolt to see six soldiers from her late
husband's Royal Lancers regiment carry his flag-draped coffin from
the red and white jet of the Queen's Flight.
   She left afterwards with her father while Charles went to
Windsor Castle 20 miles away to see the queen. Diana and Sarah left
in another car for Kensington Palace in London.
   ``Their movements for the weekend are private,'' Buckingham
Palace said.
   Lindsay's funeral is expected to take place at the Royal
Military College at Sandhurst on Thursday, provided legal matters
are settled in time, his regiment, the 9th@12th Royal Lancers said
today. The service in the Memorial Chapel will be followed by a
cremation.
