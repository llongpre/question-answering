   If it weren't for skin color, Little Richard
says, he _ not Elvis Presley _ could have reigned as the king of
rock 'n' roll.
   ``If I was white, do you know how huge I'd be?'' Little Richard
asks in the April 19 issue of Rolling Stone. ``I think Elvis was
more acceptable being white in that period. I believe if Elvis had
been black, he wouldn't have been as big as he was.''
   The rock pioneer, who recorded classics such as ``Tutti Frutti''
and ``Lucille,'' says he can recall being upstaged only once during
his flamboyant 43-year performing career. The man who did it: the
late Jimi Hendrix.
   ``He was my guitar player, and you know, we didn't know he could
play with his mouth. One night I heard this screaming and
hollering, and they were screaming and hollering for him!'' says
Richard. ``I thought they were screaming for me. But he was back
there playing the guitar with his mouth.''

   The newest member of British royalty, week-old
Princess Eugenie Victoria Helena, slept through the crowd's cheers
and clattering cameras Friday as she went home with her parents,
the Duke and Duchess of York.
   Buckingham Palace announced Princess Eugenie's name shortly
after the royal couple stepped from Portland Hospital with their
new princess, wrapped in a white blanket.
   Princess Eugenie is the sixth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II
and sixth in the line of succession. She is the second daughter
born to the duchess and her husband, Prince Andrew.
   The 30-year-old Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, gave
birth to Princess Eugenie by Caesarean section on March 23. The
baby's name surprised Britain. Bookmakers said they had thousands
of bets but not one for Eugenie.
   It was the name of Queen Victoria's granddaughter, the daughter
of Princess Beatrice who was Victoria's fifth daughter and youngest
child. The baby's second name _ Victoria _ comes from Queen
Victoria herself, and the third name, Helena, comes from the third
daughter of Queen Victoria.
   Eugenie is the French derivative of the ancient Greek word
``Eugenia'' meaning ``nobility'' and ``excellence,'' and was made
fashionable in 19th- century France by the Empress Eugenie, wife of
Emperor Napoleon III, said David Williamson, co-editor of Debrett's
Peerage, a leading reference book on the aristocracy.

   Rhythm &amp; Blues singer Regina Belle says adopting a
newborn girl four months ago has thrown her headlong into the war
against drugs.
   Ms. Belle said having a child in her life made her realize that
other children needed someone to help them learn to say no to drugs.
   When she is not touring, Ms. Belle, 26, helps with a
fund-raising project in Harlem called the Children's Storefront
Program, which sends underprivileged children to college.
   ``I think the biggest problem in America today is not drugs;
it's misguidance, no guidance and illiteracy,'' said Ms. Belle,
whose current single ``Make It Like It Was'' is getting video play
on cable television.

   Americans could get smarter by watching
nothing but the Public Broadcasting Service on television, but
viewers prefer less intellectual programming, says entertainer
Steve Allen.
   In an interview published Friday to promote a performance in
Nashville, Allen said ``you'd have a more literate, intelligent
populace'' if television viewers tuned in only to PBS.
   But he said that most people ``when given a choice between true
quality and garbage ... are likely to head for the garbage.''
   He discussed television while commenting on his new book,
``Dumbth,'' which concerns what he calls the ineptitude of the
American citizen.
   Allen, 68, is a musician, comedian, songwriter, author and
former host of the ``Tonight'' show on NBC.

   Michael Eisner, the entertainment wizard
who's turned around the Walt Disney Co., should feel like a man on
top of the Matterhorn.
   Eisner didn't sound sky-high during a speech Thursday night at
the St. Mary's College 33rd annual Executives Symposium.
   ``How do I feel about all this good fortune?'' Eisner asked.
``In a word, panic.''
   In an interview published in Friday's Contra Costa Times,
Eisner, 48, said he rarely rests easy.
   ``We always think the sky is falling, that our last movie hit is
really going to be our last hit, period,'' said Eisner. ``I tend to
run scared. I always like to think that there are two outs in the
last of the ninth inning and we're three runs down.''
   Disney has to stay on its toes, Eisner said, because ``ours is
an unpredictable and often irrational business that generally
defies logic.
   ``There is no sure-fire formula for success in the entertainment
industry. But there are any number of interesting ways to fail,''
said Eisner, who became one of the highest-paid U.S. executives
when he became Disney's chairman in 1984.
   In the next decade, Disney intends to build second theme parks
in Southern California and Tokyo, expanding Disneyland in Anaheim
and Disney World in Florida and building a Euro Disneyland near
Paris.
   When the company's first European theme park is complete in
1992, Eisner said, a Disney ride will be operating somewhere in the
world every minute of every day.
   Other projects include a new record company, 15 network TV
pilots and a restaurant chain called Mickey's Kitchen. ``As I think
of all these developments, I get very excited,'' Eisner said.
``Just before the panic sets in.''
