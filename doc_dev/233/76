   The Duchess of York, who is eight months pregnant,
escaped injury Friday when her chauffeured Jaguar struck an
oncoming car on a highway 20 miles outside London, police and
Buckingham Palace said.
   The accident involving the former Sarah Ferguson occurred on a
section of the M40, a busy western highway into London. Part of the
road was closed for repairs, police said.
   A police bodyguard was driving the duchess' Jaguar, and she
continued the journey in an accompanying police car, Buckingham
Palace said.
   The 28-year-old duchess is married to Prince Andrew, the second
son of Queen Elizabeth II. She is expecting their first child.
   Thames Valley police said later in a statement that the driver
of the other car involved was a 31-year-old financial consultant
from Cardiff in Wales.
   They did not identify him by name, but said he was taken to
Newbury police station near the scene of the incident. They said
the officers involved formally submitted a report accusing him of
careless driving and failing to stop after an accident, with a view
to possible prosecution.
   Police said he took an alcohol test which proved negative. He
was later allowed to leave the police station.
   Police said the car in which the duchess had been riding
suffered a punctured front tire and other slight damage.
   The duchess' pregnancy has undergone other health scares since
she fell while skiing in the French alps last March, when she was
four months pregnant.
