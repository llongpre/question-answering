   All, it would seem, was bliss at Buckingham Palace.
   Prince Charles and Diana emerged unscathed from a spate of rumors
about their marriage. Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, are happily
raising a baby. Prince Edward gave up military life and apparently
found peace with a theater company.
   Queen Elizabeth II was the picture of grandmotherly contentment.
   But now, suddenly, shocking headlines! Headstrong Princess Anne
and her shy commoner husband are splitting up. Is the British royal
family in trouble?
   Not really. It has survived worse crises, only to grow in
prestige and popularity. And compared with the scandals that beset
some of their ancestors, the separation announced Thursday of the
queen's daughter from Capt. Mark Phillips is small potatoes.
   ``Many, many royal marriages have been very unhappy indeed,''
says Michelle Brown, curator of the Royal Britain Exhibition.
``There have been lots of royal divorces in the past, and many
people far more miserable than Capt. Phillips and Princess Anne seem
to have been.''
   Like the unfortunate Sophia Dorothea, whose husband, George I,
locked her in a castle for 32 years for being unfaithful to him in
1694.
   Or, more recently, the drawn-out saga of Princess Margaret, the
queen's younger sister, whose marriage to Lord Snowdon ended in
divorce in 1978.
   And then there was 19th-century George IV, whose attempts to
divorce Caroline of Brunswick became a prolonged and disgraceful
public spectacle.
   Anne and Mark, who have two children, do not plan to divorce,
Buckingham Palace says.
   While most newspapers ran the split on the front page Friday, The
Independent ran just one paragraph on page 2. The Independent simply
doesn't believe the royals matter. Others enjoy them as soap opera.
   ``No scriptwriter could wish for a better cast,'' the columnist
Godfrey Smith has written: Queen Elizabeth II as ``everyone's
favorite mum,'' Prince Margaret the ``willful younger sister,''
Prince Philip ``the cantankerous father,'' ``interesting children
(cheerful Charlie, randy Andy, educated Edward and angular Anne),
all sorts of in-laws (divine Diana, problem-girl Princess Michael),
grandchildren galore...''
   There is, however, genuine sympathy for Anne.
   Her marriage in 1973 to Phillips, televised from Westminster
Abbey, was dubbed a storybook romance, but rested mainly on a shared
passion for horses, and marital strife has been rumored for eight
years.
   Anne's short temper and caustic tongue earned her an unpopular
image that only changed in the 1980s through her quiet, sustained
and often courageous work on behalf of the world's needy children.
   She may never rival Princess Diana in looks, and as seventh in
line to the throne she is unlikely to become Queen Anne. But she is
blessed with wit, poise and intellect, and at 39 she is by far the
most interesting of the British royals.
   ``We are very possessive about our royal family, and we were all,
in a sense, guests at that fairy-tale wedding 15 years ago,'' The
Times editorialized Friday. ``The queen's daughter has never been a
fairy-tale princess, however, and the monarchy is the stronger for
it.''
   Indeed, the line was taken by some newspapers that the marriage
was a sham, and that its end came as a relief.
   Other European countries also treasure their royals, and scandals
are far fewer. Belgium hasn't had any problems since King Leopold
III married a commoner in 1941 without his government's approval.
Holland's Princess Irene scandalized Protestants by converting to
Catholicism to marry a Spaniard, but her divorce 17 years later
barely caused a ripple. The Swedish and Danish royal families are
squeaky clean.
   So, for the most part, is the British family. But when it does
arise, divorce is always an emotional issue, from much-married Henry
VIII four centuries ago to Edward VIII, who had to abdicate in 1936
to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson.
   ``It was only since Queen Victoria and Prince Albert set up this
wonderful sort of epitome of the perfect family that the pressure
existed,'' curator Brown told London Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   ``Before then, royal marriages had all the rough and tumble and
all the problems of any other marriage and nobody tried to pretend
otherwise.''
