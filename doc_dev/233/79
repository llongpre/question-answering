   A gin and passion fruit concoction called the
Regal Flyer was the winning entry in a national contest to create a
cocktail in honor of the Duchess of York, the royal family's lively
new amateur pilot.
   Patricia Jones, a hotel bartender in the southern port city of
Southampton, created the cocktail, selected from hundreds of
entries from members of the United Kingdom Bartenders' Guild.
   The four judges selected the drink they believed best
represented ``all the vitality, humor and character'' of the
red-haired duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson.
   A statement by the guild said that 60 years ago a similar
contest was held to create a cocktail for the Duchess of York who
later became queen and now is Queen Mother Elizabeth.
   The current duchess, wife of Queen Elizabeth II's second son,
vowed before she married Prince Andrew in 1986 to win her pilot's
license ``to be a part of his life.'' Andrew is a helicopter pilot
with the Royal Navy.
   She now has licenses to fly helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.
   The Regal Flyer cocktail consists of one-tenth gin, one-tenth
grenadine, three-tenths passion fruit nectar, one-tenth egg white,
and four-tenths mineral water, topped with a lemon slice and
strawberry.
