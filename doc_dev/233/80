   England's Duchess of York watched
apprehensively as her husband, Prince Andrew, rocketed off the bow
of the world's largest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier for a
thrilling jet ride.
   ``It was incredible. A sensational end to a great visit to the
Nimitz,'' Andrew said Thursday following his catapult in an S-3A
Viking anti-submarine warfare jet.
   The flight and an air show were highlights of a day at sea for
the Duke of York and his pregnant wife, Sarah, both pilots, who
also inspected one of the vessel's catapults and massive chains
that hold the ship's two 60,000-pound anchors.
   The couple, on a 10-day tour of Southern California to promote
British culture and trade, began the day visiting Park Century
School for learning-disabled children accompanied by British
actress Joan Collins.
   Today's schedule for the royal couple includes visits to the
offices of Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
and the University of California, Los Angeles.
   As the prince proceeded to the jet plane for the afternoon
flight, he said, ``This is one of the loneliest walks I've ever
done.''
   The engines screamed, and Sarah, wearing a flight helmet of her
own, clutched a gift teddy bear as she watched the jet soar off the
ship. It turned back for a low fly-by and the pair waved to each
other before the duchess boarded a helicopter for her own flight to
Long Beach, where the royal yacht Britannia is docked.
   The duke and duchess returned to the Britannia to host a
Thursday evening dinner.
   Earlier, the duchess was presented a boatswain's mate's whistle,
used to pipe dignitaries aboard, and she playfully tooted on it as
she and the duke rode up to the flight deck on a huge aircraft
elevator.
   Sarah also chatted with sailors on the mess deck, asking Airman
Michael McAmis, 25, of Akron, Ohio, if his sleeping quarters were
roomy enough.
   ``It's all relative,'' McAmis replied, drawing a smile from the
duchess.
   Sarah then headed to the ship's port side, which drew laughter
from McAmis, who said, ``We only cleaned the starboard side today.''
   The Nimitz, powered by two nuclear reactors that drive four
propellers, had sailed from San Diego heading north to its home
port at Bremerton, Wash., with 3,000 men, half its full flight
compliment, and only a few aircraft aboard.
   The couple were presented leather flight jackets bearing the
inscriptions ``Duke of York'' and ``Duchess of York,'' then sat
down to watch an air show from the main deck.
   Jet after jet touched down on the deck at 160 mph, catching one
of four cable arresters on the carrier's stern and stretching them
150 yards before coming to a halt.
