Fergie says she was a royal pain as a child. The Duchess of York didn't take 
issue with an old school report that described her as "slapdash, stubborn and 
headstrong." "I always tried to do things and not get caught," the former Sarah 
Ferguson said. "I put dye in the lavatory cistern and put glue on the teacher's 
chair because it was maths, and I didn't like maths." But the wife of Britain's 
Prince Andrew said that "when I finished up at school, I did work quite hard 
and I was becoming more responsible by the minute." Childhood troublemaking may 
not run in the family. The duchess said her 1-year-old daughter, Princess 
Beatrice, is a "placid, happy little girl."

 -- Medical researchers in Britain are angry that Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher has canceled government plans for the country's biggest sex survey 
because she believes that it would violate privacy. The $1.2-million survey 
would have asked 20,000 adults explicit questions about their sex lives. Kaye 
Wellings, a health researcher, complained: "This is not a survey motivated by 
prurient curiosity into people's private lives." Researchers believe that the 
project would have provided valuable information for the fight against AIDS.

 -- If your name were going down in history, you'd want it to be legible. 
Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh has replaced his official signature, affixed 
mechanically to thousands of documents he doesn't have time to sign. The 
abandoned signature was described as an "E" and two squiggles plus a "B" and 
two loops. Bayh said that a penmanship teacher had told him he should sign his 
name more carefully, and that a high school student he once gave an autograph 
said: "Come on, what's that?" The new official signature contains all eight 
letters of the governor's name.

 -- As the New York Democratic primary nears, singer Paul Simon added his voice 
to the supporters of City Council President David N. Dinkins, saying: "It's 
time for a change" after three terms served by Mayor Edward I. Koch. Dinkins 
responded: "With his help -- and the aid of all New Yorkers -- we will build 
bridges over the troubled waters of this great but pained city." Meanwhile, a 
new Daily News/WABC-TV poll showed Dinkins leading Koch 51% to 44%. DAVE
