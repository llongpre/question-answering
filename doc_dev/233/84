   Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York danced
into the early hours Friday to the music of Peter Duchin's orchestra
at a glittering gala organized by Save Venice Inc., a U.S.-based
group raising money for preserving the art treasures of the lagoon
city.
   The presence of the British royalty among the crowd of 400
international guests caused a few headaches for organizers.
   Tight security by Italian and British police kept at bay dozens
of impatient ``paparazzi.'' But it also delayed the program and
bottled up a fleet of motorboats whisking guests between exclusive
Venetian hotels, the Palazzo Volpi and the Palazzo Pisani Moretta,
site of the dinner and ball.
   Dozens of policemen patrolled the palazzi and nearby alleys while
divers inspected the canals.
   At Palazzo Volpi, Andrew, his wife, Sarah, and the other guests
attended a party organized by the Bulgaris, the Roman jewel
designers who exhibited some of their expensive necklaces and
bracelets.
   For the occasion, Nicola and Paolo Bulgari gave an American
family from Philadelphia a golden brooch worth more than $3,000.
   The jewel _ a lion head symbol of Venice _ went to Amory
Schwartz, a 27-year-old art historian who won an art ``treasure
hunt'' through the city. His team included his sister, Susan, and
parents, Michelle and Gordon Schwartz.
   The $1,500-a-person dinner and ball ended the second biennial
Regatta Week, organized by the U.S. group prior to the traditional
gondola race through Venice canals on Sept. 3.
   The four-day festival included private parties, concerts and art
tours in Venice and nearby Vicenza.
   Organizers said they raised more than $450,000, which will
finance restoration of the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and of
lunettes, paintings and marbles in the churches of San Salvador, San
Giobbe and San Giovanni in Bragora.
   In 1987, the first edition of the Save Venice gala raised
$400,000.
   Prince Andrew and his wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, reportedly
made a donation to the fund. They arrived in Venice Wednesday and
were guests at the luxury hotel Cipriani.
   The duchess smiled but exchanged only a few words with other
guests at the gala. They left shortly before 1 a.m. while the ball
continued until 2:30 a.m. in the candlelight of the frescoed palace.
   Other VIPs included Paloma Picasso, daughter of the late painter
Pablo Picasso; Patricia S. Patterson, New York political and social
figure and chairman of the gala; socialites Mr. and Mrs. Vernon
Taylor of Denver, and Mrs. Harry de Wildt of San Francisco; Mr. and
Mrs. Winston Fowkles III, executive of Time-Life; Marife Hernandez,
former chief of protocol under Jimmy Carter; Laurence D. Lovett,
president of Save Venice; Mr. and Mrs. Austin Hearst of the Hearst
publishing family; Prince Egon and Princess Lyn von Furstenberg; and
Count and Countess Loredan, descendants of Venetian doges.
