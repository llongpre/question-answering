'THIS 'royal tapes' business is the last straw,' said my taxi driver, and I
had to agree. The ever-encroaching invasion of privacy must cease. It is
time that the royal family stopped intruding on our private lives. We may be
only subjects but even under a monarchy we have some rights, above all the
right to be left alone to lead our private lives in peace and quiet, away
from the glare of royal publicity.
The monarch herself, of course, we cannot avoid. Every time we attach a
stamp to an envelope we are obliged to lick the back of the Queen's head, as
if we were a corgi seeking an approving royal pat. Falling asleep at the end
of the day's television on BBC1, one is obliged to wake up and stand to
attention as the national anthem is played at full blast by the BBC Symphony
Orchestra, whose members, I gather, call the tune 'royalties'.
Then there are the intrusive royal garden parties. We live near Buckingham
Palace, so perhaps I am unduly sensitive. But none of our other neighbours,
not even the inhabitants of Victoria's numerous bail hostels, cause as much
local disturbance and disruption.
Of course one can leave London to avoid the din around the Palace. We favour
the south of France, around St Tropez. But this year the Duchess of York and
her financial adviser got there first, and the place now resembles
Bedlam-by-the-sea.
I cannot understand why, when members of the royal family can stay in
countless castles, all with walls high enough to hide behind and thick
enough to soundproof the most amorous affairs, some of their number should
still choose to cavort in a way which we cannot help but see, in gruesome
colour, all over our servants' newspapers.
Worse still was the return of the errant duchess. Again, perhaps I have been
unlucky, but did she and her exuberant friends have to make such a din at
Foxtrot Oscar while we were trying to enjoy a quiet dinner next door at
Tante Claire?
I suppose the rot started in the 1960s, when the Queen - doubtless following
bad advice, rather than acting on her own sound instincts - agreed to make
the royal household into media stars with the BBC film The Family. Suddenly
these remote and austere figures intruded for the first time into our homes,
like uninvited house guests.
In recent years this publicity-seeking has developed in a distinctly
down-market direction. We had the Duchess of York's characteristically
bizarre television promotion, It's a Royal Knock-Out, not to mention the
interminably over-promoted Budgie the Helicopter books.
While the Prince of Wales's publications have been less intrusive, indeed
tastefully obscure, it came as a shock to turn on one's television to see
the heir to the throne cavorting about in the highlands and islands with the
popular TV personality Selina Scott. I would not question the prince's
choice of companion - I, too, consider Scott to be a woman of rare beauty
and intelligence - but could not the future king have left us in peace,
rather than forced us to watch the two of them at peak-time and grind our
teeth in envy at his good fortune? To encourage such resentment is to foment
revolution and the overthrow of the monarchy.
But, as the taxi driver said, the saga of the royal tapes is the final
straw. I have no idea whether the tape purporting to be of the Princess of
Wales talking to a male admirer is in fact a recording of the princess's
voice or not, and the official line from the palace is that they have no
idea either.
But let us suppose that the tape is genuine, as The Sun claims. Surely the
royal family with its enormous and untaxed wealth, can afford a private
telephone exchange. Surely they realise how easy it is to get a crossed line
on British Telecom's outmoded system. How many innocent members of the
general public must over the years have suffered the irritation of suddenly
hearing snatches of conversation between members of the royal family who
ought to know better.
No wonder a retired bank manager, exasperated at having his calls
interrupted, finally lost his temper, recorded his latest crossed royal
line, and handed it to The Sun.
Perhaps this incident will finally teach the royal family their lesson. If
they will only go back to their castles, fill their moats, pull up their
drawbridges and leave us alone, then we will once again love, cherish and
admire them.
God Save The Queen.
