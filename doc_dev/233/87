   A supporter of the Irish Republican Army who
allegedly rushed at the Duchess of York with a flagpole will have
all charges dropped if he stays out of trouble for six months,
authorities said.
   The federal government agreed Friday to defer prosecution against
Michael Shanley, 25, who is accused of attempting to assault the
former Sarah Ferguson, who is the wife of Britain's Prince Andrew.
   Shanley allegedly rushed at the duchess on Jan. 21, 1988, as she
was entering a Manhattan hotel. He was holding a green flag that
read, ``Erin Go Bragh,'' which means ``Ireland forever.''
   He also was accused of assaulting a State Department agent who
wrestled him to the ground.
   The deferral, which came as the duchess' sister-in-law, Britain's
Princess Diana, was visiting New York, means that the charges will
be dropped if Shanley does not violate the law during the six-month
period.
   ``This is as good as an acquittal when it happens,'' said
Shanley's attorney, Stephen Sumerstein. ``This was a false arrest,
in our opinion. ... The charges were all ridiculous.''
   Shanley, a member of the Irish Northern Aid Committee, said in
court Friday that he had followed Sumerstein's advice and not taken
part in a Thursday night demonstration against Princess Diana in
Brooklyn, ``but my heart was there.''
