he admitted it freely in public. 'I do hope,' he said, across the table,
'that this weekend you will avoid the royal family.' Well, I shall then do
my best to avoid them, but avoid writing about them I cannot. One can be
choosy about whom one meets, but the requirements of journalistic topicality
allow of no such social discrimination.
'End of the Fairy tale' declared the headline of almost every newspaper
after the separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales was announced. This
was in no way logical since the same sort of newspapers had, initially,
declared it to be a 'fairy tale' marriage.
Leave aside the absurd, if unoriginal, hyperbole in all this. The point is:
what sort of fairy tales were most headline writers brought up on? All the
ones I ever had read to me involved all sorts of bizarre events. Princesses
were poisoned, locked up in towers, tormented by witches, and worse. The
Waleses' marriage clearly has become deeply unhappy but, compared with the
tales of the Brothers Grimm, it has been positively serene.
Perhaps the fairy tale was supposed to mean, simply, that a girl had married
her prince. This might be a commonplace among the masses; but among those
grand families whose virgin daughters are seen as ideal breeding material by
the Palace (and, in this, I do not include the family of Major Ronald
Ferguson), there exists no such sentimentality.
The late Earl Spencer, for example had few illusions. 'You could have done
better,' he is said to have told his daughter, Diana, when he learnt of her
engagement to the heir to the throne.
This was not just an astute awareness by the old boy that, in the era of
press intrusiveness, such a marriage could become more of a curse than a
blessing. Even in the halcyon days of the mid-1930s, when the press knew
their place and private lives were private, wise old Lord Halifax did his
diplomatic best to ensure that his only daughter, Anne, did not marry
George, Duke of Kent, a denouement that seemed very likely at one point.
The surprising aspect of this was that Lord and Lady Halifax were very close
friends of the Duke and Duchess of York, later to become King George VI and
Queen Elizabeth. But, as Andrew Roberts recounts in his biography of Edward,
Lord Halifax: 'He loved gossip and tittle-tattle and, although not a snob in
the conventional sense, delighted in the company of duchesses and reserved
for royalty a special exaltation.
'However, when it seemed likely that their only daughter might become
engaged to George, Duke of Kent, Lady Halifax recalled how 'Edward and I
were very apprehensive and did not at all like the prospect. It meant that
we should lose Anne in a way that we should not do in any other sort of
marriage. I felt sure also, knowing the royals well and their attitude to
ordinary life and ordinary people, that Edward and I would always feel very
much the poor relatives to the royal family.'
According to the Earl of Crawford, the duke went so far as to ask the king's
permission. When, in the fullness of time, the 'matrimonial project ended,'
it was much to the satisfaction of Halifax himself.
Lady Halifax's observation about being made to feel the poor relations was
prescient: that awareness seems to have caused at least some of the
disenchantment which led both the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of York
to regret their 'fairy tale' marriages. But add to that the horrific
stresses that press and other intrusiveness places on the brides of
Britain's royal family, and it becomes clear that the House of Windsor has a
problem which could affect its very continuity.
Having ruled out as brides virtually all suitable foreign royal princesses
(because of the archaic rule preventing marriage to a Catholic), the royal
males are in danger of being deemed unsuitable matches by all British
families of middling to good breeding and intelligence: they would not need
the wisdom and foresight of a Lord and Lady Halifax to see the potential for
their daughters' misery in marrying a potential heir to the throne.
If Britain's royal family is not to die out, two things must happen. The
press must be nicer to the House of Windsor, and the House of Windsor must
be nicer to its poor relations.
