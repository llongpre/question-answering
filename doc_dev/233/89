   Jackie Mason will still be on Broadway, but the
venue is way uptown, he won't be telling jokes and the audience
won't applaud.
   Mason, star of the Broadway show ``The World According to Me,''
is scheduled to sing as cantor at services Sept. 11 for the first
night of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, at Congregation Ansche
Chesed on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
   Mason, an ordained rabbi, offered to serve as cantor to help
raise money to renovate the 60-year-old synagogue, according to
Ansche Chesed program director Sarah Jacobs.
   Tickets to High Holy Day services are sold to non-members, and
it is hoped Mason will be an attraction, she said.

   The ``beat goes on'' in Mayor Sonny
Bono's bid to promote this desert city _ only the former singer and
television comic won't go by first-class air travel paid by city
funds.
   Bono withdrew his request Tuesday for the City Council to pay
first-class air fares for him and his wife, saying he will use his
own money to travel ``in a manner most convenient for myself and my
family.''
   Bono is scheduled to leave for Deauville, France, on Thursday to
inspect the organization of that city's film festival. He would
like Palm Springs to be host of a similar affair.
   Unlike his previous trips when he and his family flew
first-class, however, Bono will fly business class.

   Princess Beatrice, the 3-week-old daughter of the
Duke and Duchess of York, has become as rich in relatives as she is
in royal heritage by acquiring three godmothers and two godfathers.
   The only member of the royal family chosen as a godparent by
Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, was the prince's cousin,
Viscount Linley, the 26-year-old son of Princess Margaret,
Buckingham Palace said Wednesday.
   The baby's other godparents will be family friends Peter
Palumbo, the Duchess of Roxburghe, Carolyn Cotterell and Gabrielle
Greenall.
   Beatrice, who is fifth in line to the throne and the fifth
grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, was born Aug. 8 and will be
christened in December.

   Deadpan comic, self-nominating
presidential candidate and vintner Pat Paulsen, who has been trying
to sell his Sonoma County winery for more than a year, has finally
made a deal on the property.
   Paulsen's general manager, George W. Litras, said Wednesday the
comedian's name will remain on the label and he will continue as
the wine's prime promoter and consultant. He has agreed to make 40
public appearances a year for the wine.
   ``We hope to take full advantage of Pat's marketing ability,''
said Litras.
   No sale price was named, but Paulsen's 20,000-case winery and
other property, including the 55-acre town of Asti, first listed
for $3.7 million. The deal includes Paulsen's 3.3-acre tasting
room, delicatessen, gas station and some houses.
   The buyers are reported to be Mark Majestic of Palos Verdes, and
Neal Broidy of Transaction Securities of Oakland.

   Lorimar Production's lawsuit against actress
Valerie Harper has been trimmed by a judge who said he saw no
evidence that would allow the company to seek punitive damages from
her.
   Judge William Hogoboom, the retired Superior Court jurist who is
hearing the case, said Wednesday he was dismissing Lorimar's
allegations that Miss Harper had committed fraud, bad-faith denial
of an existing contract, and inducement by her husband, Tony
Cacciotti, to breach their contract.
   Left intact by Hogoboom was Lorimar's breach of contract
challenge against Miss Harper.
   The actress and the production company are suing each other over
Miss Harper's dismissal one year ago from the television show
``Valerie's Family,'' which is now called ``The Hogans.''

   Venice prosecutors screened ``The Last
Temptation of Christ'' at a special showing to decide whether
Martin Scorsese's controversial film can be shown as scheduled
Sept. 7 at the Venice film festival.
   A Milan attorney earlier this month filed a complaint asking
that the showing of the U.S. director's film be blocked under
Italy's laws against obscenity and blasphemy.
   If the prosecutors who watched the film Wednesday determine that
it may violate those laws, they can open a formal investigation.
Protesters charge the movie is sacrilegious in its portrayal of
Jesus.
   ``Have patience, we will decide in the next few days. For now,
we have nothing to say,'' said chief Venice prosecutor Bruno
Siclari.

   Tom Jones' son says the singer has recovered
from minor throat surgery with his voice intact, and plans to begin
recording in October.
   Jones, 48, whose smoky voice and gyrating hips have beguiled
grown women for decades, had a polyp, a smooth projecting growth,
removed from his throat Aug. 17 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
said Mark Woodward, the entertainer's son and manager.
   ``The surgery was very successful and he is now all better.
There is absolutely no cancer. His doctor ... said he's never seen
his vocal cords look better,'' Woodward said Wednesday.

   Country music star George Strait hopped
aboard a forklift to show his support for the nation's largest food
bank.
   In town to prepare for a Sept. 25 concert with Merle Haggard and
Restless Heart, Strait said Wednesday about $750,000 in proceeds
from many of the dates on his upcoming tour will go to Second
Harvest, a nationwide food bank serving the poor.
   ``That's a pretty good chunk of money and food,'' Strait said
during an interview at the Alameda County Food Bank warehouse in
Oakland.
   The 36-year-old performer has won 14 country music awards,
including Billboard's 1981 New Male Artist of the Year and its 1987
Top Country Artist. His hits include, ``Am I Blue'' and ``All My
Ex's Live in Texas.''
