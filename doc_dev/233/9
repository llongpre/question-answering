   Criticized by the press for taking too many
holidays, the Duchess of York will spend five days next week at a
French ski resort on official duties, Buckingham Palace said today.
   The palace said the duchess, who is married to Prince Andrew,
will visit Megeve in the French Alps for the Combined Services
Winter Sports Association championships.
   ``This is not a holiday, but an official working engagement,'' a
palace spokesman said.
   He said Sarah, better known as ``Fergie,'' would not ski
privately but may take part in a dual slalom run on the final day of
competition.
   During their ski trip in the Swiss resort of Klosters in
mid-January, Andrew and Sarah were criticized by British tabloids
for being ``no-work royals'' and taking too many vacations.
   Buckingham Palace defended the royal couple, saying Sarah had a
baby last year and Andrew does not take on too many duties other
than his navy service with the HMS Edinburgh.
   The palace also said that in July the couple will make a 12-day
visit to Canada, where they will visit Prince Edward Island, Quebec,
Saskatchewan and Ottawa.
