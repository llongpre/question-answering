<LEADPARA>  LET'S see. The queen's a frump, Chuck's a chump, Fergie's plump and her dad's
a cad. Anne's spouse is a louse, her brother's a fop and Di's fancy marriage
is clearly a flop.;    Hard to keep track of it all. Fleet Street is forever
hanging out more of the royal family's soiled laundry.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But in the midst of Elizabeth's visit to the colonies, it might be
appropriate to throw a little perspective into the pot. The House of Windsor
is like the House of Ozzie and Harriet compared with what came before.;    So
what if Chuck and Di are no longer blissfully in love? At least they appear
civil. George IV's queen, Caroline, so got on his nerves that he had her
locked out of his coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey. And he was a gent
compared with Henry VIII, who tended to resolve his domestic quarrels with an
ax.;    The British press has reported that Prince Charles and his father,
Prince Philip, are not on the best of terms, their relationship strained. If
there is a rift, it is but a crevice compared to the chasm that existed
between the Hanoverian kings and their sons, who truly loathed each other.;   
In the 18th century George II remarked of his son Frederick: "Our first-born
is the greatest ass, the greatest liar, the greatest canaille and the greatest
beast in the whole world, and we heartily wish he was out of it.";    Fred
responded by describing his father as "an obstinate, self-indulgent, miserly
martinet with an insatiable sexual appetite.";    During this century the
queen's grandpa, George V, revealed his nurturing side when he shared his
secrets for raising children: "My father was frightened of his mother, I was
frightened of my father and I'm damned well going to see that my children are
frightened of me.";    His son, George VI, developed a ghastly stutter that
took years to control.;    There is a lot of talk about how stuffy the current
queen can be, with her dour disapproval of the younger royals' good times and
occasional shenanigans. Next to her great-great-grandmother Victoria, whose
name conjures an era that raised to a religion the stifling of emotions and
sexuality, Liz looks like a brothel keeper.;    Just not amused;  Victoria's
moroseness set the tone for a generation. The official period of mourning for
her husband, Prince Albert (the "in-a-can" man), lasted 26 years, during which
time she wore only black and rarely emerged from seclusion. Her terse review
of a stage play she once attended is the stuff of snot-nose legend. "We are
not amused," she sniffed.;    Such an oppressive atmosphere is bound to
produce some royal rebels. Although Elizabeth's son Prince Andrew ("Randy
Andy") had his soft-porn starlet Koo Stark, Victoria's son Edward VII -- that
sovereign stud -- is said to have had just about everyone who would have him.;
   The tabloids love these salacious sex scandals. They delighted in revealing
how Fergie's dad was arrested at a cathouse. The latest: a paternity suit
filed against Princess Anne's estranged husband, Capt. Mark Phillips.;    But
what's one illegitimate child? Monarchs have always loved having their
mistresses, and a bunch of bastards has always been floating around as a
result.;    Maybe this is why so many pretentious people claim to have some
royal blood. Charles II, who reigned for a quarter of the 17th century, openly
acknowledged 13 mistresses and 14 illegitimate children, earning his moniker
"The Merry Monarch." He never sired a legitimate heir, and the throne went to
his brother, James II, upon his death.;    Recently, Prince Edward has been
fighting rumors that he is a different sort of "merry," even issuing a public
denial. Well, if it were true, he'd hardly be the first in the family tree.;  
 James I -- he of the Bible bearing his name -- was homosexual. Edward II so
angered the nobles by impudently bestowing lavish gifts of land and wealth on
his boyfriends that they had him murdered with a hot fire iron.;    Even the
crusader Richard I ("The Lion Heart"), the hero king of the Robin Hood
stories, was known to take a gender-optional approach to the whole sex thing.;
   It is widely reported that the staid and tiresome Charles, weary of his
role as heir apparent, is eager to ascend to the top spot. Since his mother is
showing no inclination to step aside, or expire, Chuck may have to chill.;   
Edward VII sat around for 60 years before Victoria checked out, and George IV
was already an old man when he succeeded George III. George IV at least had a
taste of being the big banana, serving as regent during his father's drooling,
babbling, violent bouts with insanity.;    There are few alternatives for the
Prince of Wales but to wait. He is not, after all, in a position to choose the
regicidal route taken by some of his antsy ancestors like Richard III.;    No
sooner had Richard's image been engraved on the coinage than Henry VII staged
a hostile takeover and killed him. Edward IV pulled the same stunt on Henry
VI, just as Henry IV deposed and killed Richard II.;    Historians suggest it
was not Richard III but older brother Edward IV who ordered the killing of
their brother, the Duke of Clarence, unfortunate to be one of many standing in
the way of Richard's lust for the throne.;    Mary I ("Bloody Mary"), Henry
VIII's daughter by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, imprisoned her half
sister Elizabeth I in the Tower of London. Mary also had Parliament officially
declare Liz a bastard.;    People seem to enjoy taking potshots at the
Windsors, especially when it comes to their physical appearance. "Princess
Anne is so horsey she could eat an apple through a picket fence" is typical of
the gibes that abound. Yet today's family, by no means rare beauties, are
certainly better off than some of the previous victims of the royal gene
pool.;    While Fergie is not exactly Slim-Fast spokesmodel material, surely
her weight problems are mild. Queen Anne was so large by 1710 that she had to
be carried around in a sedan chair.;    Henry VIII grew so obese that his eyes
became slits, and he had to be lowered onto his horse with pulleys. Fat as he
was, he had the nerve to call his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, "The Flanders
Mare," refusing to consummate their politically arranged marriage because he
found her so ugly. Instead, he divorced her, titled her his "sister," and
granted her a household of her own.;    Henry's daughter Elizabeth I, while
arguably one of England's finest monarchs, did inherit her father's tremendous
vanity. Vowing never to allow herself to be compromised by marriage, Elizabeth
became known as "the Virgin Queen.";    Nevertheless, she became the center of
a ritualized cult where flattery was the name of the game. Elizabeth, basking
in the glow, encouraged suitors and reveled in their declarations of her
glorious beauty and pledges of undying devotion. The courting rituals
continued well into Elizabeth's long reign and became rather pathetic as she
aged.;    Worth the attempt;  Balding, with blackened teeth from too much
sugar consumption and a face covered with thick, white pancake makeup, the
queen was hardly England's hottest babe. Yet the rewards were potentially
great enough for men to attempt to convince her that they believed she was.;  
 Sure, the royal family may be an absurdity, an anachronism. But it has given
England 80 generations of fun.;    What have we got?;    The Kennedys?  </TEXT>
