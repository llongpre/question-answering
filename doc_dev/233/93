   Singer Mel Torme says he expects to be
left out of the winner's circle this year at the Grammys, thanks to
his criticism of the award panel that voted him honors two years in
a row.
   Torme, who will be appearing at the Sands Hotel, Casino and
Country Club this weekend, blasted the National Academy of Recording
Arts &amp; Sciences for failing to nominate his partner on both
award-winning albums, pianist George Shearing.
   By 1982, Torme had received 11 Grammy nominations for Best Jazz
Vocalist. Because five of the nominated albums were collaborations
with Shearing, Torme asked the nominating committee why Shearing had
been ignored.
   ``They told me they had no category for him,'' Torme said. ``So
we make the album `An Evening With George Shearing and Mel Torme,'
'' Torme said. ``George asked me `why do you want to do this?' I
told him now, `We are a duo and that there is a duo category.'
Again, I got nominated and he didn't.''
   That album gave Torme his first Grammy in 1983, and in 1984 the
duo's follow-up ``Top Drawer'' earned him his second.
   This year, he is nominated for ``A Vintage Year,'' while Shearing
is again ignored. The Grammys will be awarded Feb. 22 on CBS-TV.
   ``I won't win this Grammy. I have come to understand how the
Grammys work, said the 64-year-old singer, who last year published
his autobiography, ``It Wasn't All Velvet.''
   ``I know that some of the people who vote don't like what I have
to say.''

   Actor Karl Malden says he's more nervous
about traveling since filming a television drama about a cruise ship
hijacked by terrorists.
   ``You think twice before you say you want to travel. And I think
that's terrible,'' he said Tuesday. ``In this business I'm in you
travel an awful lot.''
   The 72-year-old Malden, who flew to Australia to film the TV
movie ``The Hijacking of the Achille Lauro,'' has been acting more
than 50 years, including roles in the TV series ``Streets of San
Francisco'' and the movies ``Patton'' and ``Nuts.''
   The movie about the 1985 hijacking of an Italian cruise ship is
to be broadcast Feb. 13 on NBC.
   Malden is in Nashville to teach two weeks of acting classes at
Vanderbilt University.

   Sylvester Stallone, well-rested from
his 1985 triumph over a Russian hulk in ``Rocky IV,'' will write,
direct and star in ``Rocky V,'' MGM announced.
   The latest chapter in the heroic fisticuffs saga of Rocky Balboa
is scheduled to begin filming this fall for release in the summer of
1990, the studio said Tuesday.
   MGM did not release plot details of the next Rocky installment,
saying only that ``the Italian Stallion faces the greatest challenge
of his personal and professional life.''
   Stallone announced Monday he had signed a five-picture deal with
Carolco Pictures. In his first project under that deal, Stallone
will star as a prison inmate who rebels against a tyrannical warden.
That movie, now untitled, will begin filming in February.
   Stallone's fourth ``Rambo'' movie is set to begin filming in 1990
for release the following year.

   The Duchess of York, dubbed ``Her Royal Idleness''
by British tabloids who accused her of preferring play to work, went
back on duty at a dinner held to start a fund-raising campaign for
British museums.
   As royal patron of an organization called Museums Year, she was
guest of honor Tuesday at the dinner attended by rock star and
charity aid promoter Bob Geldof; the editor of The Times of London,
Charles Wilson, and other celebrities.
   The 29-year-old duchess, who as Sarah Ferguson married Prince
Andrew in 1986, looked slim and elegant in a black Tudor-style dress
with fitted velvet bodice and leg-of-mutton sleeves. She shed
several pounds by dieting after the birth of her daughter, Princess
Beatrice, on Aug. 8.
   As she and Andrew enjoyed a Swiss skiing break earlier this
month, Britain's brassy tabloids razzed the duchess as ``Her Royal
Idleness'' and ``Duchess Dolittle'' for what they alleged was her
love of holidays and jet-setting lifestyle.
   A recent scorecard listing the public engagements of Britain's
royal family put Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, at the bottom,
with only 30 last year. Sarah was next with only 55, less than half
those performed by her husband's 88-year-old grandmother, Queen
Mother Elizabeth.

   Spiro T. Agnew, who resigned the
vice presidency 15 years ago, was in good condition after he fell
from a bicycle and broke a hip during the weekend.
   Agnew, 70, who lives near Eisenhower Medical Center, was admitted
to the hospital Sunday afternoon after being taken there by
ambulance, hospital spokesman Mike McFadden said Monday.
   Agnew resigned the vice presidency in 1973 just before pleading
no contest to federal charges of tax evasion on $29,500 he received
in 1967 while governor of Maryland. Agnew, who was vice president
for nearly five years under Richard Nixon, had been elected governor
in 1966.
   The only other vice president to resign from office was John C.
Calhoun in 1832.
