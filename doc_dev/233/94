   British rock star Sting brought his campaign to
save the Amazon rainforest to Toronto, urging Canadians to
contribute to the cause before the world ``enters a new dark age.''
   Accompanied by several Brazilian Indian leaders, Sting told
reporters Friday that the deforestation of Brazil by farmers,
miners, loggers and dam builders will rob the world of a major
oxygen source within 30 years.
   ``Then, we will be haunted by famine, drought, pestilence,
disease _ and haunted by our own self-inflicted ignorance,'' he
said.
   Sting's forecast of apocalypse was echoed by his Brazilian
companions, who said that their people are already experiencing
catastrophe and a forest preserve must be set up before it is too
late.
   Sting helped establish The Rainforest Foundation, which aims to
establish an Amazon conservation area the size of Great Britain. He
is on a 28-day publicity tour in which he will visit 14 countries.

   Actor David Carradine eluded high kicks and
strong forearms often as the half-Chinese priest in the television
show ``Kung Fu,'' but taking a blank pistol from his pants on a
movie set proved trouble.
   Carradine, 48, suffered a minor injury Friday when he
accidentally shot himself in the groin with a .45-caliber blank
pistol during the filming of the movie ``One For The Money.''
   Fire Department spokesman Mel Cosgrove said paramedics were
called to the scene after the incident at the Mobile docks, but the
actor's injury was superficial and he refused treatment.
   Carradine was removing the pistol from his pants when it fired,
officials said. Nobody on the film crew would discuss the incident,
and filming continued Friday afternoon.
   ``One For The Money'' is about one man's fight against
corruption in an era of privately controlled police. The director
is David Prior.

   ``Sesame Street'' has a new character, a baby
girl named Gabriela, thanks to help from the rarely cooperative
Oscar the Grouch.
   The birth of Luis' and Maria's child on Friday was eagerly
awaited. Muppet and human characters gathered around Maria's bed to
be introduced to the infant.
   ``Welcome to Sesame Street and the world!'' said Big Bird.
   But not everything went smoothly. When it was time to go to the
hospital for the delivery, Luis and Maria found that their car had
been towed. Oscar drove them to the hospital, occasioning much
hand-wringing on his part.
   ``I'm a grouch,'' he explained, and grouches are not supposed to
do nice things or be happy about events like the birth of a baby.
   The marriage of Maria and Luis was the finale for last season.
Sonia Manzano, who plays Maria, became a mother 13 months ago and
her real-life daughter will eventually play her television daughter.

   Britain's Prince Charles is in Turkey over
the weekend for business and pleasure.
   He arrived Friday for meetings with Turkish leaders, including
Premier Turgut Ozal, and a cruise along Turkey's Aegean coast.
   The prince was to fly to the coast aboard his private plane and
go on a yatch chartered by Jeffrey Kent, a friend and fellow polo
player from Chicago, for a weekend cruise.
   During the cruise Prince Charles was expected to visit
historical sites such as the ruins of the Hellenistic city Ephesus
south of Izmir.
   The prince also was to spend time at the house of Ahmet Ertegun,
the owner of Atlantic Records, at Bodrum, which is in the
southwestern tip of Turkey.
