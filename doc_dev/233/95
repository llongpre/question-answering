   Raisa Gorbachev expressed regret to British
schoolchildren for having to miss a planned visit this month because
of the Armenian earthquake.
   ``As you probably know, we in the Soviet Union are deeply upset
by a terrible misfortune: a frightening earthquake which struck one
of our republics, Armenia,'' the wife of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev wrote to children of London's Gloucester School.
   ``That is the reason why we were unable to come to London and had
to postpone the visit to London,'' she wrote in the letter delivered
Tuesday by Soviet Ambassador Leonid Zamyatin. ``I would have very
much liked to come to your school ... and of course talk to you.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev also offered to help set up a link between the
school and one in Moscow.

   Britain's royal family gathered around their newest
member, 19-week-old Princess Beatrice, as she was baptized into the
Church of England.
   Beatrice let out just one quick cry as the archbishop of York on
Tuesday christened her with water from the Jordan River.
   Beatrice's parents, the Duke and Duchess of York, watched in
delight.
   Queen Elizabeth II, the baby's grandmother and temporal head of
the Anglican church, smiled broadly as she led the baby and about
100 relatives and friends out of the Chapel Royal at St. James'
Palace to pose for photographers.
   The blue-eyed princess, who has her mother's red hair, looked
directly into the cameras. She didn't let out a peep as she rested
in the arms of the duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson.
   Beatrice was dressed in the family's christening robe of flowing
cream Honiton lace, first worn by Queen Victoria's eldest son in
1842.
   The baptism was delayed until after the princess' father, Prince
Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, returned from duty in the Far East.

   Former U.S. Sen. Paula Hawkins says she is feeling
strong and fit after weight-lifting treatment, and sees ``wellness''
as the big issue of the 1990s.
   ``Wellness is what it's all about,'' she said Tuesday. ``I'm a
great example of just hanging in there. ... Hopefully, everybody can
get themselves to the nearest gym.''
   At age 60, she has discovered ``a very advanced and
sophisticated'' weight-lifting treatment that is reviving muscles in
her neck and back. She is finally free of pain from a 1982 accident
in which a wall fel on her at a television studio set. Her ailments
had slowed the Republican during the 1986 campaign, in which she
lost her seat to Democrat Bob Graham.
   Mrs. Hawkins also is returning to Capitol Hill as a lobbyist for
the drug firm Genentech Inc., but says it is only a sideline.
   ``People call me all the time who'd like me to represent them.
I'm a great advocate. But I don't want to do too much; I don't want
to be too big,'' she said.

   Martin Sheen declared a victory after
state Supreme Court justices questioned whether a judge could make
the actor post a $5,000 bond to keep him from trespassing at the
Nevada Test Site.
   ``We can't do that in America,'' Justice John Mowbray said
Tuesday of Sheen's January 1987 protest. Although a ruling wasn't
issued immediately, two other justices on the five-member court also
spoke in favor of Sheen.
   The actor was arrested as he arrived at the nuclear test site 65
miles northwest of Las Vegas for a protest after stating on ``Good
Morning America'' that he would ``hopefully commit civil
disobedience.''
   Justice of the Peace Bill Sullivan gave Sheen 48 hours to post a
$5,000 peace bond, and released him. Under state law, the threat of
a criminal act is enough to require the bond.
   Justice Tom Steffen said he couldn't see how Sheen's advance
statements could be construed as a threat of imminent criminal
behavior.
   ``This is a tremendous victory for all of us who speak out
against the arms race,'' Sheen said, adding that he plans to
continue his protests.

   Middle-distance runner Mary Decker Slaney says
there is big ``cover-up'' of drug use in track and field, and urged
that an independent agency test athletes throughout the year.
   Slaney, the U.S. record-holder in all outdoor distances from 800
meters to 10,000 meters, said Tuesday the pressure for better
performances is spurring drug use.
   ``If you nail people for drugs, the results will suffer'' and
fewer people may watch the sport, she said.
   ``But how long can it go on? There are tests that are positive,
but they are ignored, swept under the rug.''
   Slaney, speaking at a luncheon to announce her entry into the
mile at the Feb. 3 Millrose Games here, said anyone caught using
steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs ``should be thrown out
of the sport forever.''
