   Nashville Mayor Bill Boner has been so diverted
by his romance with aspiring country singer Traci Peel that he
isn't doing his job, talk show host Phil Donahue says.
   ``You are very close to giving the finger to the city,'' Donahue
said during a taping of ``Donahue'' Thursday. ``You're a distracted
mayor. You were an out-of-the-closet adulterer.''
   Peel and Boner made national headlines during their reported
summer romance while the mayor was still married to his third wife,
Betty. Boner married Peel on Oct. 1, three days after his divorce
was final.
   Boner said he has accomplished much during his three-year term.
   ``I've brought more money into Nashville than anybody else,''
Boner said. ``We lived up to our commitments. We have a totally
integrated solid-waste management system.''
   Peel sang ``Rocky Top'' during the show, accompanied by Boner on
the harmonica.

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - An eighth-grader who is battling cancer
got her spirits boosted when rapper M.C. Hammer met with her before
a concert.
   ``He was really, really nice,'' Robyn Best said after talking to
Hammer Thursday night at Rochester's Community War Memorial. ``The
kids at school are not going to believe this.''
   The meeting was arranged by Annette Coley, a secretary at Strong
Children's Critical Care Center.
   Coley wrote about Robyn to local radio station WDKX, which
forwarded the letter to Capitol Records and Hammer.
   Hammer wrote back that he'd be happy to meet Robyn, and the

   WATERVILLE, Maine (AP) - Syndicated columnist David S. Broder of
The Washington Post is this year's recipient of the Elijah Parish
Lovejoy award, Colby College officials said.
   Broder, winner of the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for distinguished
commentary, will be honored as the 38th Lovejoy fellow in a Nov. 16
ceremony at Colby's Waterville campus. He will receive an honorary
doctor of laws degree and deliver the annual Lovejoy lecture.
   The award is presented annually in memory of the Colby alumnus
who is considered America's first martyr in the struggle to protect
press freedoms. Lovejoy was killed in 1837 trying to defend his
abolitionist newspaper from a pro-slavery mob.
   Broder, picked by a panel of journalists and college officials,
has written four books on American politics. He also writes a
semiweekly column that appears in more than 300 newspapers.
