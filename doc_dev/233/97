   A harbor pilot and a deck hand were
caught between two boats and slightly injured today during
preparations to guide the royal yacht Britannia with Queen
Elizabeth II on board into Aberdeen harbor, police said.
   The queen was asleep at the time of the pre-dawn accident, which
Aberdeen police said occurred in rough weather when a two-man pilot
vessel pulled alongside a motor launch near the yacht so the pilot
could transfer to the yacht.
   After the accident the pilot, William Clark, 58, was treated for
bruises at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and released, a police
spokesman said. The deck hand, Stanley Watt, 57, suffered chest and
abdominal bruising and was kept at the hospital for observation,
the spokesman said.
   Both men were from Aberdeen, the oil capital of Europe and the
city closest to the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster last month in
which 167 men lost their lives.
   Later in the dasy, the queen and her husband Prince Philip met
40 people involved in the disaster. They then left by car for
Balmoral Castle, the royal summer retreat in the Scottish
Highlands, where they will see their fifth grandchild for the first
time.
   The Princess of York, the first child of the queen's second son
Prince Andrew and his wife Sarah, the Duchess of York, was born
Aug. 8 in London and flew with her parents to Balmoral hours after
leaving the hospital on Friday.
   The baby's name is expected to be made public after receiving
approval from the queen. The princess is fifth in line to the
throne.
