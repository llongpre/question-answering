<TEXT>     HM the Q's regular trip to Kentucky is set for May. She likes to be near
her horses.;    It will be Elizabeth's fourth run through the Bluegrass since
1984 and will be tacked on to the end of her official visits to Washington,
Florida and Texas.;    She again will stay with her friends Will and Sarah
Farish, who own Lane's End Farm in Woodford County.;    Farish told reporters
that the queen, as usual, will check on mares and foals and see some new
stallions in addition to those stallions with which her mares already have
been dancing.; (hbox);    Art lovers heading for London are advised that the
treasures of Carlton House, a vanished royal mansion and palace, go on display
Friday at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace. There's no hurry. The show
will last a year.;    Carlton House in Pall Mall was the residence of King
George IV from 1784 until 1827.;    George was criticized as a spendthrift in
his day for the way he shelled it out for furnishings and art, but today's art
historians commend him for his excellent taste.  </TEXT>
