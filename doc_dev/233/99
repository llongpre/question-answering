   Rounding up gifts for a English princess
proved challenging to members of this southeastern Nebraska
community, but it was nothing compared with trying to give them to
her.
   The Gage County visitors' committee threw a baby shower for
Princess Beatrice, the daughter born Aug. 8 to Prince Andrew and
Sarah, the Duchess of York, because the community and the princess
share the same name.
   The Sept. 1 shower yielded crocheted bibs, booties and blankets,
high-topped tennis shoes, a key to the city of 13,000 and a college
scholarship.
   The gift package, weighing about 50 pounds, was bound up and
sent off by United Parcel Service to London. Buckingham Palace
returned it, said Diane Schwenke, president of the Beatrice Chamber
of Commerce, because it's palace policy not to accept gifts.
   Working through diplomatic channels, Ms. Schwenke decided to
send the gifts to the Hospital for Sick Children in London, where
the gifts were donated in Princess Beatrice's name.
   A flurry of correspondence from Ms. Schwenke to Buckingham
Palace to explain the detoured gifts and the community's intentions
got derailed by a British mail strike.
   Once the strike was over, however, it didn't take long to get
the response from the palace, Ms. Schwenke said Thursday. A note
from a lady-in-waiting to the Duchess conveyed gratitude for the
``kind and generous presents,'' she said.
   Ms. Schwenke said she wouldn't be surprised to get a letter from
hospital officials too, though she said she's not sure what they
will do with all the gifts, including an American flag, an atlas
with Beatrice marked in, and a Beatrice library card.

   Mickey Mouse showed up in a cornfield
here to harvest his ears.
   The Pitzenberger family _ father Dick and brothers Ted, Rick and
Joe _ worked together to plant, cultivate and harvest a 238-acre
cornfield in the shape of Mickey Mouse's famous profile.
   Disney officials, who came up with the idea, used it as a
promotion for the mouse's 60th birthday. They settled on a field in
northern Iowa because it lies beneath the routes of dozens of daily
cross-country airline flights.
   After planting and cultivating the field last spring, the job of
picking the Mickey Mouse field started three weeks ago. Disney
officials came back to Iowa last week with Mickey to help harvest
the crop.
   The mouse tried his hand at harvesting.
   ``We had a little more fun with him,'' Ted Pitzenberger said
Thursday. ``He showed up to run the combine for a couple of rows.''
   The effort proved to more than just a promotional stunt for
Disney. Officials from seven towns near the field picked up on the
idea as a way to show how small-town Iowa is trying to recover from
the 1980s farm recession.
   ``Now that we're picking Mickey, there are Mickey Mouse corn
kernels in jars and Mickey Mouse ears of corn going around the
area. So it's staying with us.''
