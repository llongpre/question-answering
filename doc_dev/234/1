   Fried chicken king Al Copeland may resume his
$290 million takeover attempt against Church's Fried Chicken, a
federal appeals court ruled Thursday.
   ``I'm delighted,'' said Peter Butler, attorney for A. Copeland
Enterprises Inc. _ the company which owns New Orleans-based Popeyes
Famous Fried Chicken _ after Judge Henry A. Politz announced the
decision for the three-judge 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel.
   ``The stay is lifted,'' said Butler. ``We'll move forward with
all haste, and leave it to the shareholders as to whether or not to
believe our offer is a reasonable one.''
   A hearing is set Wednesday in federal court in San Antonio,
Texas, where Popeyes is fighting ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
bylaws which Church's adopted Nov. 4, more than a week after Popeyes
made its offer. Church's is headquartered in San Antonio.
   ``I don't consider that a major obstacle,'' said Butler.
   The judges announced their decision 35 minutes after arguments
were over. They did not go into their reasons for upholding the
ruling handed down Nov. 28 by U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz,
saying only that they affirmed it on all points.
   ``We neither approve nor disapprove of the reasons for that
decision,'' Politz said.
   Guy M. Struve, the New York attorney representing Church's, said
he was disappointed and did not know when the chain would decide
whether to appeal Thursday's ruling.
   Struve argued that the $8-a-share takeover bid should be halted
because it was based on insider information provided by a former
Church's executive now employed by Popeyes, and because merging the
nation's No. 2 and 3 fried chicken chains would violate federal
antitrust laws.
   Sam Kadet of the corporate law firm of Skadden, Arps said Popeyes
could give Church's notice on Thursday that it planned to proceed
with the takeover attempt and deliver the information to Church's
after five business days. Popeyes would have 12 more business days
after that to close the deal, he said.
   The chain has said that it owns 3.2 percent of Church's stock and
has been tendered another 14.6 million _ about 40.6 percent _ of the
35.9 million shares outstanding.
