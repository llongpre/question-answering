   Chemical stocks, like the economy, are making a lot of people nervous these days, but the optimists haven't given up. 

   These stocks took a 35% clobbering in the October massacre and its aftermath. 
But despite the stock market's crash, bulls say they don't believe a serious recession lies ahead. 
Even in an economic slowdown, they contend the chemical industry would fare better than most. 
They cite widespread restructuring earlier this decade and commodity demands that now exceed supply and capacity, as well as the weaker-dollar advantage overseas. 
There's also talk of takeovers. 

   "I see nothing ahead but chemical companies raising their prices, lowering raw material costs and widening profit margins more than you can imagine," says William Lowden, a vice president of Cigna Investments Inc. 
"We're roaring bulls." 
Adds William R. Young, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., "Chemical companies outperformed other industries in the last recession." 

   Even so, analysts have cut some earnings estimates and are picking carefully. 
They favor companies that are positioned for growth even in a recession because they offer a wide variety of products, strong cash flow and healthy overseas sales. 
Mr. Young favors Imperial Chemical, Dow Chemical and Himont. 
He isn't recommending PPG Industries, Allied-Signal, Hercules or Du Pont. 

   Mr. Lowden says 4% to 8% of Cigna's portfolio is still in chemical stocks, compared with the market's weighting of 3% to 4%. 
He likes Dow Chemical because of its strong international position and sales in basic commodities such as chlorine and caustic soda. 
He forecasts earnings of $6.45 a share for 1987 and $8.45 a share for 1988, compared with $3.87 for Dow in 1986. 

   Robert S. Reitzes, an analyst at Mabon Nugent who calls himself a "closet bull," has rated companies based on several courses for the economy. 
His strategy puts a premium on international exposure, strong cash flow, low debt and a product mix that won't be affected by a recession. 
His best case anticipates 2% GNP growth in 1988; his worst case is a 2% decline. 

   Topping his list, either way, are American Cyanamid, Monsanto, International Minerals, B.F. Goodrich, Olin and Aristech. 
If the economy remains strong, he also recommends Dow, Du Pont, Himont and National Distillers. 
In a recession, he says he would avoid companies with high debt or heavy exposure to the housing and auto industries, such as Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Ethyl, Rohm &amp; Haas, PPG, W.R. Grace and Union Carbide. 
He says Hercules, Imperial Chemical and GAF Corp. also might be good "defensive buys" in an economic downturn. 

   "I may have myself out on a limb a little," Mr. Reitzes acknowledges. 
For American Cyanamid, he forecasts 1987 earnings of $2.80 a share, up from $2.18 in 1986. 
He sees 1988 earnings of $3.50 a share at best and $2.75 at worst. 
He puts Monsanto at $5.90 a share in 1987, compared with $5.55 in 1986. 
He sees 1988 earnings at $7 a share and $5.25 a share, good and bad, respectively. 
For Goodrich, he estimates $3.85 a share for 1987 compared with 48 cents in 1986. 
He estimates $6 a share and $3.75 a share under his two 1988 possibilities. 

   Du Pont, which reached a high of 131 in August because Wall Street liked its steps to improve productivity, has taken a beating. 
It closed at 84 3/8 Wednesday. 
Most analysts are concerned that fiber sales, almost 18% of total company sales, are too closely tied to the unstable economy. 
Also, they still don't see favorable earnings from Du Pont's Conoco oil and coal unit. 

   Mr. Reitzes says Du Pont earnings could increase to $7.50 a share in 1987 compared with $6.35 a share in 1986. 
In 1988, he sees Du Pont at $8.50 in a good economy, but only $5.75 in a weak one. 

   Mr. Reitzes, as do other analysts, says chemical companies are good takeover targets because of their cash flow and currently undervalued stock prices. 
Some, like Goodrich and Olin, also have units that raiders could sell off at premiums. 
Also in the takeover rumor mill are W.R. Grace and Monsanto. 
Analysts say, however, they haven't heard of serious buyers for any of these companies. 

   More bearish analysts, such as Peter Butler of First Boston and John Henry of E.F. Hutton, say they don't see chemical stocks as the place to hide in a recession. 
Mr. Butler says export prices will be "very sensitive to perceived future changes" in the economy. 
He also warns that any excess inventories aren't yet known and that drops in auto or retail sales could lead to production cuts. 

   Mr. Butler assumes zero domestic growth in 1988 and 1989 and a 1.5% growth average in Europe and Japan. 
He still recommends Du Pont, Imperial Chemical and Dow Chemical because of strong earnings expectations, management, and productivity improvements. 

   Mr. Henry also anticipates a recession, or at least a nine-month slowdown. 
He adds that the unbridled optimism of most company managers may have swayed many analysts. 
"In the last five recessions I've been through," he says, "no manager has ever forecast one coming. 
They're the last to say."
