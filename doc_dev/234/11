   A violent white supremacist group
targeted several prominent people for assassination, including
Henry Kissinger and top television executives, a witness testified
Monday in a federal sedition trial.
   Denver Parmenter, who is serving a 10-year prison sentence after
pleading guilty in 1985 to racketeering, testified that members of
The Order planned robberies, guerrilla warfare and murders to
further their goal.
   ``Our purpose was to kill important people in government or
other important institutions in this country to create havoc,
disorder, destruction,'' Parmenter said. Order members took an oath
which included the words, ``I have no fear of death.''
   Ten of the 14 men on trial are accused of sedition, or plotting
to overthrow the government by illegal means; two are charged with
interstate transportation of stolen money; and five are charged
with conspiring to kill a federal judge and an FBI agent. Neither
the judge, the FBI agent nor any of the celebrities mentioned in
the trial Monday were harmed.
   Parmenter said he was a former member of the Church of Jesus
Christ Christian (Aryan Nations) at Hayden Lake, Idaho, which is
run by defendant Richard Butler.
   Parmenter said Butler frequently spoke of his racial and
political viewpoints in sermons. He said Butler said the U.S.
government was ``basically a government that wasn't supporting its
race.''
   Parmenter said he and eight others, including defendants David
Lane and Bruce Pierce, formed The Order in September 1983 in
Metalline Falls, Wash., home of the late Robert Mathews.
   Mathews outlined six goals for Order members, including
developing a war chest through illegal means such as robbery and
counterfeiting, Parmenter said. Each member was given a target to
kill, Parmenter said, including David Rockefeller, television
producer Norman Lear, Kissinger and the three major network TV
presidents.
   Parmenter previously outlined the assassination plots during the
1985 trial of Order members in Seattle.
