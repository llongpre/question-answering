   A federal judge has issued an order forbidding
Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken &amp; Biscuits to buy stock in Church's
Fried Chicken Inc. for 10 working days.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz on Tuesday issued the
preliminary injunction until after certain disclosures are made.
   Also Tuesday, Church's authorized its board to begin talks with
other potential buyers.
   The court order was another legal skirmish in an attempted buyout
of San Antonio-based Church's by A. Copeland Enterprises Inc., which
owns New Orleans-based Popeyes, which first made the offer on Oct.
25.
   Schwartz also ordered Popeyes:

   _To reveal the information on which its buyout offer was made.
Church's claims its former chief financial officer took confidential
files with him when he left to work for Popeyes owner Al Copeland.
   _To disclose the amount of money spent by Popeyes to buy and
maintain an offshore racing boat, corporate jet, helicopter, yacht,
bus and luxury car used by Copeland.
   _To stop using, at least for the time being, any confidential
Church's information it might have.
   A Church's spokesman said the company would ask the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to permanently enjoin Popeyes from pursuing
the takeover and to block the buyout on antitrust grounds.
   Peter Butler, Popeyes' New Orleans lawyer, said Schwartz would
have all the information this week. He said he could not comment on
McAtee's claim that Popeyes' offer was based on ``insider
information.''
   As for corporate expenditures for boats, planes and other
conveyances, Butler said: ``All those expenses have been treated as
legitimate business expenses by the business firm retained by Mr.
Copeland and been reviewed very carefully.''
