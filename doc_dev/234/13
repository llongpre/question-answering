   North American Ventures Inc. said it is considering selling its Butler Service Group Inc. subsidiary and buying back as many as 3.5 million shares over the next eight months in an effort "to increase shareholder value." 

   "If Butler is sold, proceeds will be used to reduce debt and improve the company's balance sheet," a North American spokeswoman said in East Hartford, Conn. 
Butler, which recruits technical specialists and engineers for industrial companies, is expected to have revenue of more than $260 million in 1988, North American said. 
Officials added the unit is "significantly profitable." 

   North American, which owns growth and turnaround companies, acquired Butler last year when it purchased Butler International Inc. for $140 million in a transaction that included other units. 
The company has retained the investment banking firm of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan, Grenfell Inc. as adviser in the possible sale of Butler. 

   North American has approximately 26.2 million shares outstanding. 
Its stock closed yesterday at 93.75 cents, up 31.25 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.
