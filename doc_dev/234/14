   A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Popeyes
Famous Fried Chicken to make further disclosures before it may buy
stock of Church's Fried Chicken under its $290 million hostile
buyout offer.
   Separately, Church's board of directors met in New York and
authorized management to explore alternatives to Popeyes' $8 a share
tender offer, including a possible transaction with a third party.
   San Antonio, Texas-based Church's, the nation's second-biggest
fried chicken chain, rejected Popeyes' offer as inadequate on Oct.
25, and again on Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz issued a preliminary
injunction barring Popeyes from buying Church's stock until 10
business days after it makes certain disclosures regarding its
alleged use of non-public corporate information.
   Church's has contended that its former chief financial officer,
Lewis B. Kilbourne, took confidential inside corporate information
with him when he was hired by New Orleans-based Popeyes, the
nation's No. 3 chicken chain.
   Church's also contened Popeyes financial adviser, Wasserstein,
Perrella &amp; Co., relied on that information in formulating the
takeover bid.
   Schwartz ordered Popeyes: to reveal the information on which its
buyout offer was made and to stop using, at least for now, any
confidential Church's information it might have.
   The judge also ordered Popeyes to disclose the amount of money
the company had spent to buy and maintain an offshore racing boat,
corporate jet, helicopter, yacht, bus and luxury car used by its
chairman, Al Copeland.
   On Monday, Schwartz issued a temporary restraining order
forbidding Popeyes from pursuing the buyout until similar
disclosures were made.
   A Church's spokesman said the company would appeal the judge's
refusal to grant a permanent injunction against the takeover and a
preliminary injunction on the antitrust claims.
   Peter Butler, Popeyes' New Orleans lawyer, said Schwartz would
have all the information this week. He said he could not comment on
the claim that Popeyes' offer was based on insider information.
   Regarding the corporate expenditures for boats, planes and other
conveyances, Butler said: ``All those expenses have been treated as
legitimate business expenses by the business firm retained by Mr.
Copeland and been reviewed very carefully.''
