   The Woodworth mayor and his second cousin
are back in court, fighting this time over the cousin allegedly
selling watermelons without a license.
   Mayor David Butler brought Charlie Butler into state district
court Monday over a roadside watermelon stand Charlie Butler set up
without paying an occupational tax to the village.
   Charlie Butler's lawyer suggested the ordinance was illegal.
   Ninth Judicial District Judge Richard Lee took the matter under
advisement.
   The Butlers first appeared in court several months ago when
Charlie Butler was accused of driving Woodworth's fire truck
without authorization.
   Rapides Parish prosecutors agreed not to prosecute after Charlie
Butler signed an agreement that he would not operate the fire truck
without permission.
