   The voice of Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound,
Quick Draw McGraw and dozens of other cartoon characters loved by a
generation of Americans has fallen silent. Charles Dawson Butler is
dead at age 71.
   Daws Butler, as he was professionally known at Hanna-Barbera
Productions, died of a heart attack Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, the studio announced Thursday. Butler had suffered
a stroke and had been battling pneumonia in the past few months,
the studio said.
   ``I just don't know how the industry will get along without him.
There are a lot of people who can imitate Daws but he was the
original,'' said Janet Waldo, who was the voice of Judy Jetson on
``The Jetsons'' series.
   ``He was one of the most talented artists we've ever been
associated with,'' Hanna-Barbera president Joe Barbera said. ``He
was a little man, but a giant. ... Here's a man that walked into a
studio in 1957 and helped us launch this whole company.''
   Ms. Waldo met Butler on her first cartoon assignment as the
Jetsons' daughter. Butler played her brother, Elroy.
   ``I watched Daws work, and I thought this is impossible that
this one little man can come forward with all these voices,'' she
said of the 5-foot-2 Butler.
   Butler was the voice of 42 cartoon series regular characters,
among them Snagglepuss, Wally Gator, Baba Looey, Augie Doggie, Mr.
Jinks, Lippy the Lion, Snooper and Blabber, as well as hundreds of
other incidental characters.
   Among Butler's well-known lines were Yogi Bear's ``I'm smarter
than the average bear''; Snagglepuss' ``Exit, stage left''; and
Quick Draw McGraw's ``Hold on there! I'm the sheriff around here.''
   Butler also was the voice of Cap'n Crunch for the Quaker Oats
cereal company, and of many characters in Jay Ward's ``Fractured
Fairy Tales'' and ``Aesop and Son.'' Kelloggs used his voice for
Snap, one of the Rice Crispies characters.
   ``He will be terribly missed by everyone at our studio,'' said
Hanna-Barbera co-founder Bill Hanna.
   Mel Blanc, the voice of Warner Bros.' Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig
among others, regarded Butler as ``one of the great voice creators
... an extremely talented individual and very loving,'' said
Blanc's son, Mel Blanc Jr. The elder Blanc was out of town.
   Barbera said there will be a search to replace Butler.
Candidates will practice characters' lines, then give the studio an
interpretation.
   ``If we keep our fingers crossed we may be able to find the
right man. If we don't, we won't (continue the character),''
Barbera said. ``We respect them too much.''
   Butler was born in Toledo, Ohio, and grew up in Oak Park, Ill.
He participated in amateur contests as a young man, doing
impersonations of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Rudy Vallee and a Model T
Ford starting up.
   During World War II he served in the U.S. Naval Reserve and was
married. His wife, Myrtis, was from North Carolina, and Butler
maintained that Huckleberry Hound's Southern accent came from
listening to her family and neighbors.
   Butler moved his family to California in 1945, and by 1948 was
starring in ``Time For Beany,'' the West Coast's first TV puppet
show. The show ran for five years. In 1957 he went to work for
Hanna-Barbera.
   Butler is survived by his wife and sons David, Donald, Paul and
Charles. A funeral was scheduled for Saturday at Good Shepherd
Church in Beverly Hills.
