BUTLER COX, the London-based management consulting company specialising in
information technology, is to be sold to Computer Sciences Corporation of
the US in a cash deal worth Pounds 14.3m.
CSC, a large computer systems integration company with an international
reputation for large industrial and government projects, said yesterday that
it had agreed to pay 245p per share for the entire share capital of Butler
Cox.
Following the statement shares in Butler Cox virtually doubled from 131p to
230p. The company was floated on the London stock market in May 1989 at
175p. Butler Cox directors, who between them hold 36.7 per cent of the
capital, are unanimously recommending acceptance of the offer.
Mr George Cox, managing director, said yesterday that 'the price reflects
the potential of the business.'
He said the downturn in the UK economy had hit both the level of
profitability and the share price which had made it impossible for Butler
Cox to make acquisitions using its own paper.
However, he pointed out that the company remained profitable, had grown in
cash and had avoided compulsory redundancies.
In its last financial Butler Cox experienced a 42 per cent fall in taxable
profits to Pounds 760,425 (Pounds 1.32m) on turnover up nearly 15 per cent
to Pounds 10.73m. CSC, with headquarters in Los Angeles, had net income last
year of Dollars 65m (Pounds 38m) on turnover of Dollars 1.7bn.
The two companies said that Butler Cox's presence in Europe would complement
CSC's strength in North America.
Butler Cox is unique in its sector in that its conventional consultancy
activities are underpinned by a syndicated research foundation.
Members of the Butler Cox Foundation include many of the most prestigious
companies in the UK and mainland Europe, brought together by a common
concern to make the best use of information technology.
Last year Butler Cox added an education arm through the purchase of
Cranfield Information Technology Institute.
CSC announced two years ago that it intended to grow the commercial side of
its business through acquisition and had set aside a war chest of Dollars
500m for purchases world-wide.
It already owns Index, a consultancy with offices in Boston, Los Angeles,
New York and London with strong links to Harvard and to Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
The US company said its intention was to bring together Butler Cox and Index
to form a global consulting group. The two companies have a total of some
800 companies worldwide subscribing to their research programmes.
