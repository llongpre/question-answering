<LEADPARA>  THE Los Angeles Dodgers come to Candlestick Park in less than four weeks --
April 15, to be exact -- and Brett Butler wants Giants fans to understand one
thing: He didn't do it.;    "I didn't leave the Giants," Butler said
Wednesday. "I didn't leave; I was no longer welcome there."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But, golly gee, things couldn't be better, Butler says in the next breath,
and that's Brett Butler for you. It's a wonderful life no matter where he is.
Playing center field for the Dodgers was a lifelong dream, anyway, just as it
was playing for the Giants and the Braves and, heck, maybe even the Cleveland
Indians, too.;    Butler is wearing No. 22 for the Dodgers. He could have had
No. 2, his number with the Giants, but he just couldn't take the shirt off his
manager's back. Tommy Lasorda offered, though, and the gesture, Butler said,
"made me want to hug the Italian.";    The Dodgers offered him a radio show,
too, Butler said. Again, he declined. For now, he just wants to fit in, do his
part. It's a dream come true.;    "There's something about putting on this
uniform," Butler said while dressing for Wednesday's game, a 7-5 win over
Philadelphia in which Butler singled in three trips to square his average at
.250. "I feel like I've been wearing it my whole career.";    Butler in Dodger
Blue is a strange sight. Butler in any uniform other than the one he wore last
season is strange, considering all that he meant to the Giants.;    Did you
realize that nobody in the league had more hits than Butler last season? His
192 tied Lenny Dykstra for honors. Butler batted .309, stole 51 bases, scored
108 runs. He ranked among the top five in hits, walks, runs, triples, steals,
and on-base percentage. He gave the Giants a leadoff hitter and a center
fielder for 160 games last season.;    By the way, Butler thinks Robby
Thompson can do the job. But why is it even an issue? Why isn't the Giants'
leadoff man still Brett Butler?;    Butler never thought we'd be entertaining
such questions. He thought he'd finish his career with the Giants. When he
heard Al Rosen's voice on the phone that December day, he figured the Giants'
G.M. was calling to give him a contract. Instead, Rosen gave Butler the gate.;
   "He said he was scared he was going to lose me to 'new-look' free agency,"
Butler recalled. "He said they were going to look elsewhere. My agent (Dick
Moss) called right after that and told me they'd already signed Willie
McGee.";    BUTLER is "hurt -- not bitter," and he wants Giants fans to
understand one more thing: He never asked for $15 million.;    He wanted $12
million over four years, he said, just like Vince Coleman and Steve Sax. Maybe
his agent asked for $15 million; Butler doesn't know. "Maybe there was a
conflict," Butler said. "Somehow, Al got mad.";    And the Dodgers got Butler.
They're happy to have him, and not just because he battered L.A. pitching for
a .411 average last season. The Dodgers haven't had a leadoff man since Sax
left. Now they've got Butler at the top of a lineup that includes Darryl
Strawberry, Eddie Murray, Juan Samuel and Kal Daniels.;    "Butler is the
piece that puts the puzzle together," Lasorda said.;    "He's a helluva
ballplayer . . . He's like a gnat. He upsets you, he bothers you, he annoys
you. He makes you mad.";    Soon he'll be making Giants fans mad. Coming back
to Candlestick as a member of the hated Dodgers is something Butler has
considered. It was pretty quick after he signed that he heard from a friend, a
Giants fan who "hates the Dodgers with a passion." The poor guy was already
torn.;    "He said, 'I can't boo you, so every time you come up (to bat), I'm
either gonna have to say nothing or go get a hot dog,' " Butler said.;    With
Butler batting leadoff in this lineup, the poor guy's going to eat himself
sick.  </TEXT>
