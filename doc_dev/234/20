The most amazing thing about singer-guitarist Jonathan Butler is that he isn't 
better known. With two Grammy nominations and a gold record under his belt, he 
would seem ripe for major stardom. But it still hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
The South African-born performer's appearance at the Pantages on Friday night 
underscored the fact that a good portion of the music audience is missing an 
opportunity to see a star in the making. Roving the stage with the dynamic 
energy of a young James Brown, ripping off guitar licks with the creative 
ingenuity of a George Benson, singing with the style and communication of an Al 
Jarreau, Butler gave a performance that was just about as good as a pop music 
concert can get. 
</P>
<P>
Add to the fact that he wrote most of the material he sang, and the picture of 
an artist destined for much, much bigger things came clearly into focus.

Butler opened his set with an instrumental in which his left-handed guitar 
chording exploded with bristling, brasslike clusters. Shifting to single-note 
lines, he spun out a sequence of disjunct melodies (blended, occasionally, with 
vocal scatting) that took persistently startling twists and turns. 
</P>
<P>
His singing was as good as his playing. On "I'm a Sucker for You" (from his new 
album) and "Lies" (a Grammy nomination in 1988), Butler told his stories of 
capricious desire in rhythmic bursts of high-voltage energy. Softer ballads -- 
"True Love Never Fails" and "More Than Friends" (his current single) -- were 
treated gentler and more sweetly, but without ever losing the undercurrent of 
performing passion that is intrinsic to Butler's singing.

Angela Bofill, opening the program, sounded a bit more subdued than usual. 
Halfway through "Down the Line," however, she broke out in a soaring vocal 
improvisation that recalled how good she can be when she is at her best.

Saxophonist Najee, also on the bill, displayed characteristically broad strokes 
of bright musical colors, but his finest moments came during a beautifully 
basic chorus on the standard "When Sunny Gets Blue."DON HECKMAN
