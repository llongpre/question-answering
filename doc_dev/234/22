   A 16-year-old boy shot a schoolmate in
the back of the head and then fatally shot himself on a bus
carrying 40 students to high school Tuesday, police said.
   Robert Butler of Clairton, a junior at Serra Catholic High
School in McKeesport, was pronounced dead at 8:40 a.m. at
McKeesport Hospital, said Police Chief Thomas Brletic.
   Adam Ference of Clairton, also a 16-year-old junior, was in
critical condition at Presbyterian-University Hospital in
Pittsburgh, Brletic said. A hospital spokesman said the family
asked that no information be released.
   Brletic said police have no idea why the shooting occurred,
although several students noticed that Butler seemed ``moody.''
   ``We're trying to understand why this young man would bring a
gun with him on a school bus, shoot a youngster sitting in front of
him and take his own life,'' the chief said.
   Counselors were sent to the school to talk to the students.
   Brletic said Butler boarded the bus at his normal stop and
pushed past several students to get to his usual seat. Ference
boarded afterward and sat directly in front of Butler.
   During the bus ride, Butler punched the back of the seat in
front of him, prompting Ference to turn around and ask why he had
done so, Brletic said. Butler did not answer, and no further words
were exchanged, he said.
   Minutes later, when the bus was about 100 yards from school,
Butler shot Ference with a .32-caliber revolver, then put the gun
to his temple and fired, killing himself, the chief said.
   The gun belonged to Butler's father, William Butler, a former
Clairton patrolman, Brletic said.
   After the shots, the students started screaming and the bus
driver pulled into the school entrance and stopped. Students fled
the bus.
   Butler was a good student and had no history of problems at
school, Brletic said.
