   A murderer scheduled for execution
Saturday has ordered a halt to his appeals after spending half his
life behind bars, saying he wants to ``get it ver with.''
   Jerome Butler, whose age is listed in prison records as 54 but
claims to be several years older, has been on death row since
November 1986 for the robbery and murder that June of a Houston
taxi driver.
   Since last month, when his first execution date was set, Butler
has refused to let lawyers file motions that could spare him from
lethal injection.
   ``I just want to get it over with,'' Butler said at that time.
``They could take these cuffs off me and walk me back to (death
row) and I still won't resist. There won't be no appeals.''
   Bob Walt, an assistant attorney general, said Thursday that
Butler did not appear to be backing down.
   Vic Pecorino, one of Butler's lawyers, said he had no plans to
go ahead with legal efforts to spare Butler's life against his
wishes.
   ``I think it's pretty clear and I don't think it's up to us to
go ahead'' with appeals, Pecorino said.
   Butler, convicted of shooting Nathan Oakley, has been in and out
of prison since 1959.
   Butler would be the 34th inmate executed in Texas and the 122nd
nationally since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states
to resume use of the death penalty. The last execution in Texas was
Dec. 7.
