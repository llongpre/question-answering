   The fired warden of the Louisiana State
Penitentiary operated a cockfighting business at the prison and
failed to maintain security and report escapes, the state's
corrections chief said.
   Hilton Butler, who has been on leave since August, was fired
Tuesday for eight violations of department policy that alleged
administrative malfeasance, said Bruce Lynn, secretary of the
Department of Public Safety and Corrections.
   ``I was going to give him the opportunity to retire. ... He
chose not to retire,'' Lynn told reporters Wednesday.
   Butler stepped aside as warden after a court-appointed official
issued a highly critical report of the prison's operations. But he
later filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission, claiming
that Gov. Buddy Roemer and Lynn coerced him into retiring. Butler
asked the commission to reinstate him.
   Lynn denied Butler was coerced. Roemer said he was not involved
in the details, but added that Butler ``made the right decision''
in stepping aside. The governor said Wednesday he backed Lynn's
decision to dismiss him.
   According to Lynn, the charges against Butler stemmed from an
agency probe that followed allegations leveled by the
court-appointed investigator, former warden Ross Maggio.
   Butler was replaced after U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola
received Maggio's report, which said the prison suffered from lax
management and had failed to properly search inmates and visitors
for contraband.
   Polozola ordered Maggio to investigate after a rash of escapes,
assaults and suicides at the giant prison at Angola.
   Among Maggio's report, Butler was raising fighting cocks for
sale on the prison grounds, using inmate labor and prison
facilities. Lynn said he had told all wardens to refrain from any
personal business activity on June 20, but Butler ignored the
order. Several hundred fighting cocks owned by Butler recently were
removed from the Angola grounds on Lynn's orders.
   Butler also failed to maintain searches of employees and
visitors to the prison, which ``resulted in a serious breakdown of
security,'' the report said. Drug and other contraband problems in
the prison ``were well known to the warden,'' the report said.
   Annette Viator, an agency attorney, said Butler could appeal the
decision to an internal department panel and the Civil Service
Commission. Under state regulations, Butler could still decide to
retire before the appeals process, she said.
   Butler refused to comment and referred questions to his
attorney, Floyd Falcon. Falcon said he had not received a copy of
the charges and declined comment.
