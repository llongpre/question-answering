Brett Butler, the San Francisco center fielder who became a free agent Friday, 
said that his agent has already been contacted by the Dodgers, whom he 
considers "my dream team." 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I was a kid I wanted to play for the Dodgers," Butler said from his 
Atlanta home after becoming one of 15 new-look free agents in accordance with 
the recent collusion ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a free agent in 1987, they were my first choice. I love Los 
Angeles. It has always been a dream to play there. Hopefully something can 
transpire." 
</P>
<P>
Butler said his agent, Dick Moss, was contacted by the Dodgers Friday morning 
and that the Dodgers promised to get back to him. Butler batted .309 last year 
with 51 stolen bases and could fill the Dodgers' need for a leadoff hitter 
while allowing them to trade Kal Daniels for a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"Our outfield is a bit crowded right now, but I do expect we will speak to 
Butler," Dodger Vice President Fred Claire said. BILL PLASCHKE
