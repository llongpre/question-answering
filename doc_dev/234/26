<LEADPARA>  Chicago Bears kicker Kevin Butler withdrew a guilty plea to drunken driving
when a judge said he would have to spend the weekend in jail and miss Sunday's
game against the Minnesota Vikings, his attorney said.;   Butler made a
plea-bargain arrangement with the Lincolnshire town attorney after an Aug. 6
arrest in the north Chicago suburb, said attorney Alfred D. Stavros. Butler
had agreed to counseling and a year of court supervision.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Lake County Circuit Judge Wallace B. Dunn accused Butler of expecting
special treatment in a hearing Friday, Stavros said. Dunn said he would
consider the plea only if Butler spent the weekend in jail, prompting Butler
to withdraw his plea.;   Butler kicked a 22-yard field goal Sunday with 5
minutes, 54 seconds left to lead the Bears to a 10-6 victory over the
Vikings.;   Butler was not expected in court until Sept. 6, but Stavros said
he asked the judge to move up the date to Friday. The next hearing is
scheduled for Sept. 20.; TOON SIDELINED: Al Toon, the leading receiver and
offensive captain of the New York Jets, missed Sunday's season opener with
post-concussion syndrome.;   Toon had been listed as probable for the game
with Tampa Bay. His injury was listed as a contused chest. No mention ever was
made during the week that Toon had a concussion.;   The Jets scratched Toon
several hours before the game, but did not explain the injury.; JUST A WISH:
Bruce Pickens was hoping Steve DeBerg and the Kansas City Chiefs' offense
would expose some holes in the secondary of the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. He
also wanted the Falcons to win, but DeBerg threw for 158 yards and one
touchdown and Christian Okoye ran for 143 yards, leading the Chiefs to a 14-3
victory.;   Pickens was the third selection, by Atlanta, in last April's NFL
draft, and he remains the only unsigned first-round selection.  </TEXT>
