   A convicted killer who had demanded
that his lawyers halt efforts to stop his execution was put to
death early Saturday for the slaying of a Houston taxi driver.
   Jerome Butler, who had spent about half of his life behind bars,
was given a lethal injection at 12:15 a.m. and pronounced dead at
12:26 a.m.
   ``I just want to say I wish everybody a good life and things
like that. Everything is okay,'' he said. He nodded to the prison
warden and to a chaplain, coughed several times and stopped
breathing.
   Butler, whose age on record was 54 although he claimed to be
several years older, was sentenced for the 1986 shooting death and
robbery of 67-year-old Nathan Oakley of Houston. He refused any
interviews from prison.
   Butler, who has passed competency tests, was the first person to
be executed willingly in Texas since Robert Streetman ordered his
attorneys to make no further efforts on his behalf. He was put to
death Jan. 7, 1988.
   Butler was the 34th inmate to be executed since Texas resumed
carrying out the death penalty in 1982. The total is the highest of
any state. Nationally, he was the 122nd person executed since a
1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed states to resume capital
punishment.
   State corrections officials said Butler had not filed any
appeals by Friday afternoon.
   ``I just want to get it over with,'' Butler said last month when
his execution date was set. ``They could take these cuffs off me
and walk me back to (death row) and I still won't resist. There
won't be no appeals.''
   One of Butler's attorneys, Vic Pecorino, had said Butler could
be spared if he had a change of heart.
   ``Without cooperation from him, what are you going to appeal?''
Pecorino said.
   Prosecutors said Butler may have killed Oakley because the cab
driver recognized Butler as the man who killed his friend, A.C.
Johnson, in 1973. Butler served 10 years of a 30-year prison term
for that slaying.
   ``This is what I've been waiting for _ for this moment _ to know
this man can not take away another wife's husband and children's
father,'' Oakley's widow, Robbie, said Friday. ``It's been a
difficult three and a half years. I wish I could be there to see
it.''
   Butler spent 27 years behind bars, beginning with a
23-to-47-year term in New York in 1959 for robbery, attempted
sexual assault and accessory to rape. He was paroled in 1972.
   The following year he was arrested for the Johnson slaying and
sentenced to 30 years for murder. He was freed in 1984.
