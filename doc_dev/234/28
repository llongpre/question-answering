</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge Tuesday ordered a delay in the murder trial of Stacy Butler, accused of 
killing a San Diego police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Louis Boyle delayed the trial from Sept. 7 until Jan. 8 at 
the request of Butler's attorneys, who said they needed more time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, 25, is accused of killing Officer Jerry Hartless on Jan. 31, 1988. 
Police believe Hartless was running after Butler in Southeast San Diego when 
Butler shot the officer in the forehead. Hartless, 24, was in a coma for three 
weeks before he died. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is seeking special circumstances in the case, 
making Butler eligible for the death penalty if he is convicted of first-degree 
murder.
