A Normal Heights man was released Wednesday from County Jail downtown, where he 
was being held on suspicion of raping a slightly retarded 22-year-old woman who 
was reported missing Feb. 26, police said. Detective Robert Hilliker said 
charges of raping an incompetent were dropped against 26-year-old Richard 
Wallington, because the alleged victim, Lisa Louise Butler, did not want to 
prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
"She told us that she wasn't missing, and that it was her choice to go with 
(Wallington) because she was doing her own thing," Hilliker said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who police were told has the mental capacity of a 9-year-old, met 
Wallington at a downtown bus stop and went to his home in the 3000 block of 
Suncrest Drive, where she stayed all last week, said police spokesman Bill 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
An official at a supervised home in Southeast San Diego, where Butler lives, 
reported her disappearance to police, who alerted the local media. Her picture 
appeared in some newspapers and television news programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hilliker said police interviewed Butler and determined she was capable of 
making her own decision about staying with Wallington. He said there was 
insufficient evidence of Butler's retarded mental condition. 
</P>
<P>
Butler was found Monday in a Burger King restaurant at Fashion Valley, Robinson 
said. He said that a man who had worked with Butler in a Special Olympics event 
recognized her from media reports and told an employee to call police. 
</P>
<P>
Wallington is employed at the fast-food restaurant and Butler was waiting for 
him to finish work.
