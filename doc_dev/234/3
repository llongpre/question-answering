Drummer Tony Williams is living proof that you don't have to forsake melodies 
or a beat to make a new musical statement. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who plays the City College Theater with his acoustic quintet at 8 
p.m. Monday in a show co-presented by KSDS-FM (88.3) and the San Diego Jazz 
Festival, uses his raw talent to create within the limits of straight-ahead 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
A child prodigy who was playing drums in Boston clubs with his saxophonist 
father before his teens, Williams went to New York to join Jackie McLean's band 
when he was only 16. With bassist Ron Carter and pianist Herbie Hancock, 
Williams completed the rhythm section that propelled trumpeter Miles Davis 
through such seminal '60s albums as "In a Silent Way," "Miles in the Sky" and 
"Miles Smiles," albums that marked the birth of the rock/jazz marriage known 
today as fusion. 
</P>
<P>
But it was when he left Davis in the late '60s that Williams began to find 
himself, melding elements of jazz and rock in a band called Tony Williams 
Lifetime with guitarist John McLaughlin and organist Larry Young. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' current band, together since 1985, is loaded with talent: pianist 
Mulgrew Miller, trumpeter Wallace Roney, sax man Billy Pierce and bassists Bob 
Hurst and Ira Coleman. Miller has been getting praise for his own debut solo 
album. 
</P>
<P>
With this band, Williams seems to have found an ideal setting. The music, 
composed by Williams, is powered by his crisp stick work: rapidly shifting 
layers of rhythms coming from carefully tuned drums that almost give his 
playing a melodic quality. His crisp rolls and deft cymbal work have become a 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
The drummer won't say much about the group, which recently released "Angel 
Street," its third album. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a band like this before. I like trying things that haven't been 
tried. . . . The music? I can't put it into words. If you could explain music, 
you wouldn't need music." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego marks the halfway point on the band's six-week tour of the United 
States and Canada. In August, they'll be playing jazz festivals in Japan. 
Tickets for the San Diego show are $12 ($14 at the door), available at all 
Ticketmaster locations or from the KSDS studios (234-1062). 
</P>
<P>
The show is the first of what KSDS and the Jazz Festival hope will be a series 
of jointly presented summer jazz concerts. Williams will be interviewed on KSDS 
at 3 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Henry Butler, who opened a three-week gig at Elario's last night, has 
most often been likened to pianist McCoy Tyner. But any similarities in their 
percussive attacks are more coincidence than the result of direct influences, 
Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, Butler's aggressive approach developed quite independently. He began 
his musical career as a grammar school drummer, which instilled strong rhythms, 
and he grew up in New Orleans, "which probably has more good drummers than any 
city its size in this country," he said. 'With that kind of environment, one 
almost had to be percussive." 
</P>
<P>
Butler counts pianist Keith Jarrett and saxophone giant John Coltrane among his 
influences. He has many talents beyond the piano: Besides singing and 
composing, he also takes pictures, all the more impressive because Butler is 
blind. "A moron can take a picture," he said. "A dog can do it if he knows 
which button to choose with his paw." Butler's photos, though, aren't dogs. 
They've been shown around the country to favorable reviews. 
</P>
<P>
In La Jolla, he'll be backed by San Diegans Jim Plank on drums and Bob 
Magnusson on bass. 
</P>

Friday night at the Centro Cultural in Tijuana, two groups of Southern 
California musicians will present "Homenaje a Charlie Parker," a memorial to 
the pioneering bebopper. One band includes local sax man Charles McPherson, 
one-time L.A. Express drummer John Guerin, pianist Frank Strazzeri and 
trumpeter Chuck Findley. The other consists of pianist Mel Goot, drummer Carlos 
Vasquez, percussionist Armando Rosas, bassist Bill Andrews, Mexican saxophone 
player Esteban Favela, San Diegan Bruce Cameron on trumpet and possibly Coral 
Thuet on vocals. Consider the event an early birthday party: Parker was born 
Aug. 29, 1920. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarists Al DiMeola and Larry Coryell electrified listeners with their fusion 
work in the '70s, DiMeola with Chick Corea in Return to Forever, Coryell 
leading his own bands, including The Eleventh House. Both are also prodigious 
talents on acoustic guitar. On June 21, they join hot young French guitarist 
Birelli Lagrene in a "Super Guitar Trio" at the Bacchanal. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Animal Logic, the band put together by bassist Stanley Clarke and former 
Police drummer Stewart Copeland, hits the Bacchanal on Monday. . . . KSWV-FM 
(102.9), which, with the help of disc jockey Art Good (formerly of KIFM), stole 
the Catamaran's Cannibal Bar away from KIFM's Lites Out circuit for its own 
Jazz Nite, has added a second club to its promotional lineup: the Full Moon in 
Encinitas, which holds its "Moonlight Jazz" nights every Sunday. This week, the 
club features the Mark Lessman Band. The Wave thus beats KIFM to the punch with 
a club promotion in North County, ripe territory for light-jazz lovers. . . . 
Spencer Nilsen, whose "Architects of Change" album is a mainstay of local 
contemporary jazz stations, is considering recording an extended dance version 
of "Church on Wall St." from the album. . . . New Age band Shadowfax, which 
claims to have used more than 150 instruments from all over the world on its 
new album, "Folk Songs for a Nuclear Village," plays the Del Mar Fair at 7:30 
p.m. Sunday.
