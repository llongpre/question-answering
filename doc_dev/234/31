   For 15 aspiring butlers, drawing a gun will be as
important as drawing a bath.
   The would-be servants will be taking a three-day course on
handlng guns so they can protect employers and their families in
the United States and other overseas posts.
   ``Unfortunately, we're living in an era of violence, and wealthy
people overseas who employ butlers want somebody who in an
emergency can go to a drawer and fire a gun to protect them and
their families,'' said Ivor Spencer, who runs the International
School for Butler Administrators.
   Spencer said he was surprised that all 15 students in the
seven-week course said they wanted to learn how to handle guns and
semi-automatic weapons.
   ``I gave them the option and thought some would be afraid of
guns,'' he said.
   The three-day course in Newport, Wales, starting Nov. 9, will
include training on the use of semi-automatic weapons, he said.
   Spencer said he didn't expect butlers to be toting guns in
Britain, which has strict gun control laws and has banned
over-the-counter sales of the weapons. But he said he does expect
some butlers going overseas to get licenses and use their training.
   The school, which recently added karate to its curriculum, runs
several courses in London, one in Houston and is starting one in
Australia.
   Butlers trained by the school are now working for the Duke and
Duchess of York, Prince Edward and King Hussein of Jordan, Spencer
said.
