FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Marbaix merges Asquith and Butler to create
single machine tool maker

TWO OF the oldest UK machine tool builders, Asquith and Butler, are being
merged into one company by their new owner to create a strong force in one
of the most competitive industrial product markets.
Marbaix Lapointe, the machine tool side of Marbaix (Holdings), a
family-owned Basingstoke-based concern, has combined the two companies, both
based in Halifax, to form Asquith Butler.
The Asquith site will close and the entire company will move on to the
nearby Butler site.
The merger is the culmination of a plan by Marbaix to broaden its presence
in the machine tool industry, after buying in 1987 the Lapointe broaching
machine business.
Last year Marbaix Lapointe purchased Asquith, founded in 1866 and best known
for its vertical machining centres.
Asquith had been subject to a management buy-out in 1981.
Then in February it paid a nominal amount to the publicly-quoted B Elliott
engineering group for Butler, which makes horizontal machining centres.
Butler was founded in 1868 and had been combined by B Elliott with Newall,
the Keighley-based blade-tip grinding business, which was excluded from the
sale.
Marbaix was attracted by the strength of the products and the personnel at
Asquith and Butler, but because of the recession both companies were losing
money.
'We have put together two companies that may not have survived on their
own,' said Mr Peter Cain, managing director of Marbaix Lapointe, yesterday.
The merger would produce economies of scale and better utilisation of
factory equipment.
Asquith Butler will have annual sales of Pounds 10m-Pounds 11m and about 120
employees - a large company for the machine tool industry. Mr Cain said
competition, mainly from Spain and France, was serious, but he believed
Asquith Butler would make a profit this year.
