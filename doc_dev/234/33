   Butler Manufacturing Co. said it purchased its former
European building systems joint venture, Butler Building
Systems Ltd., from Melville Group PLC of the U.K. Terms
weren't disclosed.
   The Kansas City, Mo., supplier of building systems,
specialty parts and construction services said it began
operations in the U.K. and continental Europe in 1964 from a
manufacturing plant in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. The business was
converted to a joint venture, Butler Building, with local
management and investors in 1983 and was sold in its entirety
to Melville in May 1989.
