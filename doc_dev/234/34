   A Miami couple who survived 66 days aboard a life
raft in the Pacific Ocean returned home Saturday looking for a long
rest _ away from the water and their aquatic tormentors.
   William Butler, 59, and Simone Butler, 56, arrived at Miami
International Airport after a seven-week ordeal, during which they
said their boat was sunk by whales and they had to fend off sharks
and subsist on fresh fish and desalinated sea water.
   The couple, each more than 50 pounds lighter after the ordeal,
flew from San Jose, Costa Rica, a week after they were rescued by a
Costa Rican Coast Guard cutter 13 miles off that Central American
nation's coast.
   ``It's hard to believe that seven days ago we were still adrift,
trying to make landfall,'' Butler said. ``Really, it's hard to
discuss the situation.''
   Butler said the most dangerous day on the covered raft was a day
he called ``The Shootout at O.K. Corral.''
   The Butlers that afternoon found themselves in the middle of a
huge school of triggerfish, a small feeding fish. Then came a school
of porpoises and ``about 20 to 30 sharks,'' he said.
   ``They all got in a huge feeding frenzy,'' Butler said, that
ended only about 3 a.m. the next day.
   During the turbulent episode, either a porpoise or a shark got
caught in one of the raft's balast bags, and violently threw the
raft about for a couple of minutes, according to Butler.
   Butler, a retired exporter, looked trim and fit. He wore a bushy
grey beard grown during the sojourn.
   Mrs. Butler, who lost 67 pounds, left the plane in a wheelchair,
but stood up to greet waiting family members and friends and talk
with reporters.
   Among those waiting to meet the Butlers was their 2-month-old
granddaughter, Jessica Butler, who was born after they put to sea.
   The couple was hospitalized in Costa Rica after the rescue.
   ``The first night in the hospital,'' said Mrs. Butler, a native
of France, ``I had a terrible nightmare, and didn't know where I
was. It was a terrible two minutes in the dark before I realized
that I was on land and it was all right.''
   On May 24, the Butlers began a voyage from Panama to Hawaii in
their 40-foot sailboat.
   Nearly three weeks out, whales, apparently seeking to protect
their young, attacked and sank the boat, the couple said.
   `I don't know anything about whale psychology,'' Butler said,
``but I assume we headed into (the whales') pack. The babies were in
front, the mothers behind, then the males.''
   Butler said the male whales attacked the boat, ramming its hull
while making loud chugging sounds ``like a locomotive.'' The couple
sent help signals, grabbed essentials and jumped into the raft as
the craft went down in minutes.
   They managed to escape with six cans of food _ including half a
jar of peanut butter _ the ship's log, a puncture repair kit for the
rubber raft and the crucial fishing line and a portable desalination
filter.
   The canned food held out for 20 days, then they lived on fish
they caught.
   The couple said they sighted dozens of ships during their ordeal,
but weren't seen by the crews.
   The Costa Rican Coast Guard spotted the couple floating in their
life raft Aug. 19.
   ``We're going to rest _ and go away from the ocean for a while,
to the mountains, the prairies,'' Butler said.
   The life-long sailor said he plans to resume sailing ``in about a
year.''
   They said they have received various offers for rights to the
story of their ordeal.
   ``We've already received a lot of offers,'' Butler said. ``Offers
for movie rights, for TV rights, for book rights, for
ghostwriters.'' But ``we've put that all on hold,'' his wife said.
