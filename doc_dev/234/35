   The ex-warden of the Louisiana State
Penitentiary was fired for lax security, not reporting escapes and
operating a cockfighting business at the prison, the state's
corrections chief said Wednesday.
   Hilton Butler, who has been on leave since in August, was fired
Tuesday for eight violations of department policy that alleged
administrative malfeasance, said Bruce Lynn, secretary of the
Department of Public Safety and Corrections.
   ``I was going to give him the opportunity to retire. ... He
chose not to retire,'' Lynn said.
   Butler, a career corrections employee, stepped aside as warden
after a court-appointed investigator, former Angola warden Ross
Maggio, issued a highly critical report on operations at the vast
prison complex at Angola.
   Butler later asked the Civil Service Commission to reinstate
him, claiming that Gov. Buddy Roemer and Lynn coerced him into
retiring.
   Lynn has denied that Butler was coerced. Roemer said he was not
involved in the details, but added that Butler ``made the right
decision'' to step aside. The governor said Wednesday that he
backed Lynn's decision to dismiss Butler.
   Butler can appeal his firing to an internal department panel and
to the Civil Service Commission.
   Butler refused comment and referred questions to his attorney,
Floyd Falcon. Falcon said he had not received a copy of the charges
and declined comment.
   According to the charges, Butler was raising fighting cocks for
sale on prison grounds, using inmate labor and prison utilities.
Several hundred fighting cocks he owned have been removed from
Angola grounds on Lynn's orders.
   The charges said he also failed to maintain searches of
employees and visitors to the prison, allowed inadequate and
inoperable security equipment, ill-trained personnel, and failed to
report at least seven escapes for prosecution, as required by
agency policy.
   Lynn said the charges were referred to the district attorney who
handles Angola and a copy would be sent to U.S. District Judge
Frank Polozola, who is overseeing a long-running federal suit
involving the prison system.
