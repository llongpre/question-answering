   After years of preaching racism and
hatred, the Rev. Richard Butler has lost some of his fire and
brimstone.
   At 71, he walks slowly and breathes with difficulty, still weak
from a heart attack suffered two years ago while awaiting trial on
charges of scheming to overthrow the U.S. government.
   Many followers of his white supremacist Aryan Nations church
have been jailed, or scared off by FBI investigations and publicity
from civil rights organizations.
   But this aging ``Aryan warrior'' hangs onto his dream of an
all-white homeland in the Pacific Northwest, seeking inspiration
from an unlikely source _ skinheads.
   ``They're the last hope, the only hope, of the white race,'' he
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Where others see menacing young thugs who shave their heads and
tattoo their bodies with swastikas, Butler sees the next
torch-bearers of racism. Butler is sponsoring the first national
neo-Nazi skinhead conference here this weekend to mark the 100th
birthday of Adolf Hitler, on April 20.
   The meeting worries law officers and rights activists, who until
recently were noting with satisfaction that membership in racist
hate groups seemed to be declining nationwide.
   ``Now, with skinheads, you have a pool of violence-prone,
ideologically sympathetic people who are being courted to join the
mainstream of the right-wing movement,'' said Marvin Stern,
northwest regional director for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith.
   The Jewish group notes that many skinheads band together without
racist motivation. Those who can be classified as neo-Nazis,
however, number about 2,000 in 21 states, with the greatest
concentrations in Southern California and the Northwest, Stern said.
   In Portland, Ore., skinheads are awaiting trial in the death
last November of an Ethiopian man, who was fatally beaten with a
baseball bat. Another skinhead is accused of stabbing a black man
in Spokane, Wash. Swastikas painted on synagogues and assaults on
Jews, homosexuals and other minorities have additionally been
linked to skinheads in the region.
   Butler is not alone in courting skinheads. He's competing with
groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the White Aryan Resistance, led
by Tom Metzger in Fallbrook, Calif.
   ``Until now, skinhead groups have been mostly autonomous and
localized,'' Stern said. ``Any network Butler puts together bears
watching.''
   The network-building was visible last week as Butler and his
followers prepared for this weekend's conference at his northern
Idaho compound, 20 wooded acres tucked away on a gravel road near
the resort town of Hayden Lake.
   Two men hammered away in one of several rustic guest cabins. A
barefoot young woman leaned over a long canvas banner, stenciling
in ``Aryan Nations Now.''
   Taking time for an interview in the compound's modest church,
Butler resembled not at all the tough, urban youths he is wooing.
Dressed in a sweater vest, wool slacks and loafers, the
gray-haired, bi-focaled Butler played the part of a kindly country
preacher.
   Butler shrouds his racist message in religion, using scripture
to support his claims of white supremacy. He conceded that Biblical
quotations may turn off skinheads, not known for steady church
attendance.
   Many skinheads listen to the racist lyrics of Skrewdriver, an
industrial-grade British rock band. Butler wishes they would listen
to Beethoven.
   ``We want them to be able to think,'' he said. ``You can't think
if you're listening to the hard-rock jungle beat.''
   Despite the generation gap, Butler feels he offers something
these alienated youths can understand: a call to power in the name
of racial pride.
   ``The white male, through affirmative action, has been made a
non-citizen,'' he said. ``This is why you have skinheads. They're
beginning to wake up to the fact that they've been conquered and
that the land their fathers bled and died for has been taken away.''
   His little church in the pines has a guard tower that's higher
than the steeple. Inside, sunlight filters through stained glass
onto a huge Nazi flag. A poster showing a young man with an assault
rifle exhorts, ``Join Us, Aryan Freedom Fighters.''
   ``Kids like that kind of stuff _ it gives the idea that they're
in battle,'' Butler said, quickly adding that talk of battle was
only talk.
   Butler moved to Idaho in 1973 and over the years built up a
following based on his dream of a ``territorial imperative'' for
whites. He considered the Northwest an ideal homeland: rural,
conservative and lacking many blacks, Jews and other minorities.
   His dream was blocked not only by resistance from local
authorities but also by the violence of his own followers.
   Some former members, impatient with waiting for revolution,
formed a group known as The Order. The group's founder, Robert
Mathews, died in a fiery shootout with FBI agents in 1984 on an
island in Washington's Puget Sound. Ten Order members have been
convicted of racketeering, and 12 more pleaded guilty to various
crimes in a scheme that included murder, armored-car robberies and
plots to overthrow the U.S. government.
   Two years ago, Butler and 14 other white supremacists were
charged with plotting to overthrow the government. They were
acquitted last April, but Butler's arrest and the costly trial
crippled his already-weakened organization.
   Butler said weekly church attendance, which once peaked at 60,
now hovers around 40. Outside observers put the number even lower.
An Aryan Nations computer billboard, once touted as a high-tech
communications network for white supremacists, was discontinued
after the computer was stolen, Butler said.
   But just when his opponents figured he was washed up, Butler
announced plans for this weekend's skinhead conference. At first,
officials expected up to 250 skinheads, and Butler promised a march
down the streets of nearby Coeur d'Alene.
   In the face of fierce opposition from locals, Butler backed off.
He said he didn't want his supporters catching AIDS from
counter-demonstrators. And now he says he's expecting just 75 to
100 skinheads.
   He's planning a weekend of lectures, karate workshops and
campfire ``fellowship.'' He said lawyers will offer the skinheads
tips on how to build power legally.
   ``I hope to keep them from going to prison or getting killed.
They can do a lot more for the cause on the streets,'' Butler said.
``I want them to become a political force. That can come when they
have knowledge. When you have knowledge, you have power.''
   The idea of a white homeland in the Northwest is little more
than rhetoric bandied about by ideologues doomed by their own
extremism and violence, said Norman Gissel, president of the
Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations. The group is among
several planning civil rights activities this week to counter the
skinhead gathering.
   ``These people are their own worst enemies,'' Gissel said. ``Now
they're down to a church that has about 10 members and a handful of
kids.''
   But Butler warns against writing off the racist cause.
   ``The old men like myself are going to die off very soon,'' he
said. ``But this is the first time that I've seen a spirit of
regeneration.''
