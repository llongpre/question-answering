   Japan-based Sunstar Inc. agreed to acquire John O. Butler Co. for nearly $161 million in a transaction initiated by an affiliate of Sunstar's advertising agency. 

   The Japanese consumer-products concern's agreement in principle to acquire the Chicago-based maker of toothbrushes is the biggest transaction yet for PaineWebber/Young &amp; Rubicam Ventures Inc. 
A joint venture of the brokerage company, PaineWebber Group Inc., and ad agency Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., the company was formed in late 1986 to structure mergers and acquisitions for consumer-products companies. 

   At the time, the concerns said the venture was based on the idea that companies should restructure with their brands and customers in mind. 

   Edward N. Ney, the former Young &amp; Rubicam chairman who is the joint venture's chairman, said PaineWebber/ Young &amp; Rubicam brought Sunstar and Butler together as an adviser to Sunstar, which is a Young &amp; Rubicam client in Japan. 
He said the transaction would give Sunstar, which specializes in health and beauty-aid products, instant access to the U.S. market. 

   The transaction could also broaden Butler's international markets. 
Though it makes other oral-hygiene products, Butler's most important product is the Butler G-U-M toothbrush, sold largely to dentists. 
A spokesman said the toothbrush has 25% of that market and about 7% to 8% of the retail market. 

   In New York, Yoshi Saegusa, chief representative for Sunstar in the U.S., said the acquisition would improve his company's marketing capabilities in the U.S., Japan and Europe. 

   Butler said that under the agreement, the family of the company's chairman, E.B. Tarrson, would sell its combined 72% stake for $25 a share, and the remaining 1.8 million shares would be acquired from other stockholders for the same price. 

   Industry analysts viewed the offer as a generous one, made possible by the strength of the Japanese yen in relation to the dollar. 
The per-share purchase price is nearly 35 times last year's earnings and 28 times one analyst's projected earnings for the current fiscal year. 

   In yesterday's national over-the-counter trading, Butler shares surged $10 to $23.10. 

   "I certainly don't think Sunstar is underpaying for this acquisition by any stretch of the imagination," said Harry E. Blount, analyst at Blunt Ellis &amp; Loewi Inc., in Milwaukee. 
Mr. Blount, who projects Butler's fiscal 1988 earnings at $5.7 million, or 89 cents a share, said his most optimistic per-share valuation of the company had been in the low 20s. 

   In the year ended Aug. 31, Butler earned $4.7 million, or 72 cents a share, on sales of $43.5 million. 

   The offer is subject to receipt of a fairness opinion from Butler's financial adviser and execution of a definitive merger agreement.
