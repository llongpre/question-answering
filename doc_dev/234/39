   A Florida man said today that he and
his wife survived 66 days at sea on raw fish and purified water
after whales rammed and sank their pleasure boat off the Central
American coast.
   William Butler, 59, and his 56-year-old wife, Simone, of Miami,
were taken to a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after being rescued
by a Costa Rican coast guard crew Saturday about 20 miles off that
city's Pacific coast, Butler said.
   The Butlers were sailing their 40-foot boat, the Siboney, from
Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to Honolulu, Hawaii, for a vacation,
according to U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Egbert Vallecillo.
   They left Panama to start the Pacific leg of their journey on May
24, Butler said in an interview, today.
   On June 15, a group of whales attacked the boat, he said.
   ``In no more than 15 minutes, our boat was destroyed,'' he said
by telephone from the hospital. ``But God, always present in our
prayers, helped us because we carried a life raft and we got in it
immediately, taking all the things we would need.''
   He said they had eight cans of food, some cookies, a water
purifier and a fishing hook.
   ``But after 20 days adrift, all the food was gone. After that, we
started fishing. Thanks to God, we were lucky, and all the time we
had food and with the filter, we drank good water.''
   Butler shed 49 of his 175 pounds, and his wife went from 150
pounds to 92, he said, he said.
   ``They are weak, but they are expected to recover,'' said
Vallecillo, who spoke to Butler by telephone from the U.S. Coast
Guard's Pacific Command headquarters in Alameda, 10 miles east of
San Francisco.
   Butler told Coast Guard officials their boat was attacked and
sunk by ``several'' whales about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica.
   ``They were large, according to Mr. Butler; but he didn't know
how many whales,'' Vallecillo said.
   Butler told Coast Guard officials he is an experienced sailor.
   Vallecillo said he has heard of boats running into marine mammals
when visibility is poor, but he wasn't sure if there have been any
recorded cases of whale aggression.
   The couple's last radio contact was June 13, when they talked to
their daughter, Susan Smith, in Miami.
   ``This is an execeptional case, in that they were prepared with
fishing equipment and the desalinization unit,'' Vallecillo said.
   During the two months adrift, the lifeboat moved slowly eastward.
The Butlers caught between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and survived
multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft repair kit,
Vallecillo said.
   Butler told U.S. Coast Guard officials that several times they
spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down.
   On Saturday, the Costa Rican ship finally saw the raft and
rescued the couple.
