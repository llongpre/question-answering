   Jerome Butler, who ordered his lawyers
to stop their appeals and told fellow inmates he would wait for
them in hell, was executed early today for the 1986 murder of a
taxi driver.
   Butler appeared relaxed as witnesses filed into the death
chamber. ``I just want to say I wish everybody a good life and
things like that,'' he said. ``Everything is OK.''
   Then he nodded to the prison warden and a chaplain standing
nearby, coughed several times and stopped breathing. He was
pronounced dead at 12:26 a.m. CDT, 11 minutes after a lethal
injection was administered.
   ``This is what I've been waiting for _ for this moment _ to know
this man cannot take away another wife's husband and children's
father,'' Robbie Oakley, the widow of slain cab driver Nathan
Oakley of Houston, said Friday.
   ``We feel pretty badly about this,'' Vic Pecorino, one of
Butler's attorneys, said before the execution. ``Jerome Butler is
not your typical mad-dog killer.
   ``Without cooperation from him, what are you going to appeal?''
   An inmate whose cell is near Butler's on the Texas Death Row
said Butler had been prepared to die for weeks.
   ``He said he doesn't want to be among the walking dead,'' said
Raymond Carl Kinnamon. ``He's happy as a lark on Easter Sunday. But
he's definitely said he's going to hell. He said, `I'll wait for
you in hell.'''
   Attorney General Jim Mattox, who witnessed the execution, said
prison officials offered Butler, 54, a last chance to seek a stay.
   ``He .. indicated he wanted to go on forward,'' Mattox said.
``He had indicated he simply did not want to live in prison and get
out a very old man if he would not be executed.''
   Prosecutors said Butler may have shot to death Oakley, 67, in
June 1986, because the driver recognized Butler as the man who
killed his friend, A.C. Johnson, in 1973. Butler served 10 years of
a 30-year prison term for that slaying.
   Altogether, he spent 27 years behind bars, beginning with 13
years at Sing Sing Prison in New York beginning in 1959 for
robbery, attempted sexual assault and accessory to rape.
   
   The year after his release he was arrested for the Johnson
slaying and sentenced to 30 years. He got out of prison in 1984.
Two years later, he was on death row.
   Butler had passed competency tests, so appeals on psychological
grounds could not be raised.
   ``I just want to get it over with,'' he said last month when his
execution date was set.
   He told attorneys that even if he won a new trial and received a
life sentence, he would be well into his 70's before he would
become eligible for parole.
   ``What am I supposed to do then? Go live under a bridge?'' he
asked.
   Butler became the 34th inmate, and the oldest, to be executed in
Texas since the state resumed capital punishment in 1982. The total
is the highest of any state.
   He was the 122nd inmate executed in the United States since the
Supreme Court in 1976 allowed states to resume the death penalty.
