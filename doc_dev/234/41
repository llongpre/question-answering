   Ancient alchemists, who strived to convert
base metals into gold, have been outdone. A modern-day chemist is
changing sewer gas into diamonds.
   Dr. James E. Butler and his colleagues at the Naval Research
Laboratory won't likely be going into the fancy jewelry business,
he admits.
   But they have found a way to produce some tiny industrial-type
diamond crystals using one of the most widely available raw
materials, the methane from sewer gas.
   In this case, gas from Washington's Blue Plains Waste Water
Treatment Plant, which is adjacent to the research laboratory.
   In addition, other chemists working at the Naval Research
Laboratory have grown diamond crystals using an oxygen-acetylene
torch, Butler said.
   ``I don't think we'll be able to grow gemstone size and quality
diamonds in the near future,'' Butler cautioned.
   But the tiny diamonds made in his process _ using chemical
vapors to deposit crystals on a surface _ could have a variety of
industrial applications from abrasives to protective coatings,
computer insulators and a host of other uses, he said.
   What Butler and the other Navy scientists are doing is
developing methods of getting carbon to form diamond crystals.
Their process requires heating chemical vapors at normal air
pressure or less and then getting carbon from the vapor to
crystalize on a surface at temperatures of about 900 degrees
Celsius (1,440 degrees Fahrenheit). Current industrial processes
for making diamonds require much higher heat and pressure.
   Graphite _ the soft black material used in pencil leads _ is the
normally stable form of carbon at room temperature, Butler
explained.
   But by heating carbon-containing gases like sewer gas or
acetylene the harder form of carbon can be made to grow on a
surface. And if enough crystals form they combine into a thin
diamond film, Butler added.
   Why use sewer gas?
   ``Sewer gas was just a case of having a convenient, inexpensive
source of methane,'' Butler said. Methane, a combination of carbon
and hydrogen, is a primary constituent of sewer gas. It is
generally burned as waste.
   Researchers in other countries have performed some similar
experiments, Butler said, adding that such sources of carbon as
vodka also have been used.
   It will be years before the diamond-making system could be
developed on an industrial scale, he said, but when that happens
plenty of raw material will be available.
   And if burning of the waste gas is halted that also would reduce
pollution and release of carbon dioxide, a product of the burning
which scientsts fear will add to the so-called greenhouse warming
of the Earth.
