   ``Flashpoint'' (GRP Records) _ Tom Scott
   
   Saxophonist Tom Scott has played, it seems, with everybody.
   A short list of those he's backed includes Barbra Streisand,
Steely Dan, Paul McCartney and Joni Mitchell. He has written scores
for movies and even the themes for two 1970s TV shows, ``Starsky and
Hutch'' and ``The Streets of San Francisco.''
   In between such projects, Scott, sometimes with his ever-changing
band the L.A. Express, has found time to make solo records of
lightweight jazz-rock fusion, meticulously produced and somewhat
devoid of any spark.
   The same holds true for ``Flashpoint.''
   The opening cut, ``Get a Grip,'' sets the tone for the album,
with its uptempo melody, overdubbed saxophone solos and shifty
rhythm. Scott's penchant for overdubbing tenor and alto saxes
creates a fuller sound but prevents him from straying too far from
the melody, robbing his solos of spontaneity.
   ``Lost in Love'' and ``Night Drifter'' are both moodier, slower
pieces that showcase Scott's tenor sax runs, while the title cut is
the most adventurous, with its synthesizer-saxophone harmony and
machine-like rhythm.
   Scott is a talented composer, producer and sideman, but as a solo
act he shows little imagination. His music, while pleasant enough,
begs for something to set it apart from the crowd.

   ``T-Shirt'' (Epic) _ The Crickets
   
   The first album in years by The Crickets is an unexpected little
pleasure, especially if it is approached without lofty expectations.
   Former Buddy Holly sidekicks J.I. Allison and Joe Mauldin are
joined on ``T-Shirt'' by singer-guitarist Gordon Payne for 10 songs
that, happily, don't lapse into sentimental reminiscences or futile
attempts to recreate the late rocker's magic.
   They do a good job playing breezy, good-time rock 'n' roll, the
sort of thing Holly might be doing today had he lived (and stopped
progressing musically) past 1959.
   It's unpretentious, fun and instantly likeable.
   One song rises above the rest _ the Paul McCartney-produced title
cut. It's the most overtly Holly-esque song here, with an
irresistible hand-clapping, guitar-strumming chorus: ``Don't tell me
that love hurts-I read the book, I saw the movie, got the T-shirt.''
   The Crickets also poke fun at themselves in the bouncy ``Three
Piece,'' noting how many musicians have been in and out of the band
since Holly split from the group shortly before his death.
   There have been, they sing, ``more Crickets than a dog's got
fleas, but we've cut it down to a three-piece.'' Then, noting the
advantages of a smaller group, ``The overhead's down and the money's
increased.''
   Such high points are not sustained over the entire album, though,
and the sappy ballad ``The Weekend'' and the unnecessary car song
``Cruise in It'' threaten to drag things down.
   But The Crickets make up in spirit for the few weak spots, making
``T-Shirt'' a well-fitting, comfortable record.

   ``More Than Friends'' (Jive) _ Jonathan Butler
   
   Jonathan Butler is the kind of guy we all used to hate in school.
Butler is handsome, sings well, plays a mean guitar and writes
catchy songs. He probably played on the football team, too.
   Butler puts his musical talents to good use on ``More Than
Friends,'' a collection of 10 tunes that contains few clinkers. The
record is mostly pop, part r&amp;b and a little bit of jazz. Because of
Butler's scat singing and the way he rips through acoustic guitar
licks, his sound is a bit reminiscent of George Benson.
   The opening cuts, ``There's One Born Every Minute (I'm a Sucker
for You)'' and ``Breaking Away,'' both swing and swagger with a
smile. The mood remains upbeat the rest of the way, with other
highlights including the instrumentals ``Take Me Home'' and
``Sekona.'' Butler even turns a few neat phrases, as seen on ``She's
a Teaser'':
   ``She'll call you up at 2 a.m., says she wants some company; I
tell you this from experience, the only thing you'll do all night is
watch TV.''
   It's some consolation that Butler occasionally has trouble with
girls.
