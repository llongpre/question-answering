<LEADPARA>  Our spies in Houston beg to report the following:;    The survivors of Tom
Butler gathered for his wake last Friday, only to discover that the mortuary
had sent someone else's loved one. The intruder was "dressed in the clothes of
my husband," complained the widow.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Butler's brother, Arthur Wooder, called mortician Earl Pruitt and received
many apologies and the information that Butler had been buried by mistake. He
will be exhumed in time for Saturday's burial, Pruitt assured the bereaved.;  
 But the body that showed up Saturday wasn't Butler's either. Pruitt finally
checked in with the correct deceased during the service, offering a refund and
blaming the mix-up on human error.;    Reporters pursuing this story, however,
say Mrs. Butler describes it as inhuman error. Pruitt, for his part, has
referred all calls to his attorney, Grant Hardeway, who assured scribblers
that this is the funeral home's only such mistake in 40 years.;    Then came
the really strange part. Hardeway says the other family, the one that
initially buried Butler, also had an open-coffin service . . . but did not
realize Butler was a stranger.;    . . . After all, the guy had been sick.  </TEXT>
