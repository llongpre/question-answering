   A family whose bean farm on the edge
of the Everglades was sold for nearly $23 million donated about a
third of the cash to a high school scholarship fund.
   ``I can't think of anything more important than getting the kids
an education. We just have to educate our kids properly,'' said Jack
Butler during a brief ceremony Friday at which he presented the $6.4
million endowment to Deerfield Beach High School.
   The school was singled out to receive a third of the income from
the sale of the land in the wills of Butler's aunt and uncle, James
and Alice Butler, pioneer farmers who came to South Florida in 1910.
   James Butler died in 1965. Mrs. Butler, who died in 1976,
believed the sale of the 400-acre farm would reap about $250,000.
   But rapid growth in South Florida has inflated land prices in the
area about 12 miles northwest of Fort Lauderdale. American National
Development Corp. of Coral Springs acquired the property June 22 and
plans to build home subdivisions.
   ``We knew the property was worth a lot more than Aunt Alice
thought,'' said Butler, 72, who farmed the land until 1985. ``We
just wanted to farm it, pay the bills and keep it free and clear
from debt until the time was right.''
   Butler said the 1,600-student school also will receive a third of
some other farm assets still to be sold.
   School officials knew of the will's provisions for years, but
were stunned by the amount of the gift.
   Principal Ronald Clodfelter said many students who might not have
considered college could now do so with grants from the fund. He
said the school will form a scholarship committee to oversee the
funds and determine how they will be allocated.
   Under present rates, the yearly interest from the endowment would
be more than $500,000, said David Moyar, a vice president at
Southeast Bank, which is handling the funds.
   ``Alice and James wanted to do a lot for the high school,'' said
George Patterson, an attorney for the Butlers' estate. ``She was
adamant about the school.''
