<LEADPARA>  After 40 games this season, the Giants had the worst record in the club's
109-year history. They were a shocking 12-28.;    About 40 games later, it is
time for a little more humility. The National League All-Star reserves were
announced Thursday, and there was Brett Butler in center field.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Not Willie McGee, but Butler. Not the four-time All-Star, but the one who
never had been invited. Not the Giants' new center fielder, but the one he was
signed to replace.;    Butler certainly was not the most unexpected of the Los
Angeles Dodgers' representatives for Tuesday's game in Toronto. Teammate Eddie
Murray was chosen as Will Clark's backup at first base, and fans in San Diego
have to be justifiably angered that Fred McGriff was snubbed.;    In Butler's
case, it is merely another slap in the Giants' face. Just when they had gotten
over that dubious 40-game start, this further defines their season.;    Giants
General Manager Al Rosen chose not to negotiate with Butler over the past
winter. Butler was going to be a new-look free agent, and Rosen has said
Butler was going to seek Clark-type contract numbers. Butler has said he might
have been able to come to an agreement, and that he was not given the
opportunity.;    Butler was allowed to seek employment elsewhere, and the
Giants signed McGee in the meantime for four years and $13 million. McGee
could do more things, they figured, and besides, Robby Thompson could handle
Butler's old leadoff job.;    Through Wednesday, Thompson had hit .226 at
leadoff, .244 at No. 2, .283 at No. 6 and .281 at No. 7. Mike Felder is the
leadoff man now. The Giants' offense has not been the same since Butler left,
and one can only wonder if his absence is the reason.;    "They obviously
wanted McGee, and they got him," Butler said during the Giants' recent visit
to Dodger Stadium. "That's fine. He has done well, and I've done well here.
I'm not going to say the Giants have struggled because they let me go. I've
said all along it's their pitching.";    Because Kevin Mitchell missed so much
time, McGee was the Giants' only legitimate candidate to join Clark at the
All-Star Game. Besides Butler, McGee was the only other legitimate candidate
in the league from center field, a rather weak position this season. Fans had
given neither McGee nor Butler much support, and McGee was bypassed when N.L.
Manager Lou Piniella and N.L. President Bill White chose reserves and
pitchers. Even Cincinnati's Paul O'Neill made it ahead of McGee.;    "I don't
put too much emphasis on it," said McGee, who has been to four All-Star Games
but none since 1988. He has averaged around .320 and made only three errors in
a new and windy home park, but he said last weekend that he was more deserving
last year, when he won a batting title.;    Butler broke into the majors at
about the same time as McGee, in the early '80s, and this was his first
selection to an All-Star team despite being considered the best leadoff man
this side of Rickey Henderson. That should make it even harder for the Giants
to swallow. As for Butler, there has been no desire to rub it in. He said he
and Rosen have not talked since parting company ("We waved to each other"
during a series this season at Candlestick Park, Butler said), but he did chat
briefly with Giants Manager Roger Craig before the teams last played.;    For
Butler, this has been a typical season. He led the league with 56 runs through
Wednesday and was hitting .296. The difference is, he is on a division leader
and is being widely credited as the catalyst of the Dodgers' rise.;    Within
the Giants' clubhouse, there surely are old friends who wish Butler well. But
watching him on television Tuesday night will be just another humbling fact,
right up there with the 40-game start.  </TEXT>
