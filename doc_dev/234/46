   This quiet resort town may have been
slow to recognize the racist threat of Richard Butler's neo-Nazi
sect, but civil rights leaders say their vigilance is now wide-eyed
and alert.
   Butler targeted the Northwest for an all-white Aryan Nations
homeland partly because of the region's conservative politics and
tradition of tolerance.
   ``The Aryan Nations miscalculated,'' said Tony Stewart,
president of the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment.
``They did not find acceptance in the Northwest.''
   This week, as Butler prepares for a neo-Nazi skinhead conference
at his compound a few miles from Coeur d'Alene, civic leaders in
northern Idaho are planning a march, a picnic and an inter-faith
church service to celebrate cultural diversity.
   Butler's activities did not always provoke such responses. His
Aryan Nations church, established in 1973, was all but ignored for
years.
   ``You have a lot of kooks and nuts anywhere you go,'' said
Norman Gissel, president of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human
Relations. ``In north Idaho, especially, the sentiment is that you
leave your neighbor alone if he wants to be left alone.''
   That started to change in 1981, when swastikas appeared on a
Jewish-owned restaurant in Hayden Lake. The task force was formed,
but community participation remained low until 1985, when court
trials revealed ties between Butler's Aryan Nations and The Order,
a violent group that masterminded murder, bombings and armed bank
robberies.
   Coeur d'Alene's live-and-let-live demeanor changed forever the
morning of Sept. 29, 1986, when three bombs exploded in town,
planted by white supremacists as a diversion during a foiled bank
robbery.
   The next summer, when Butler held his annual Aryan World
Congress for about 200 white supremacist leaders, a civil rights
rally in Coeur d'Alene drew 1,000 people.
   The task force on human relations has served as a model for
about a dozen watchdog groups now operating in the Northwest,
Gissel said. The coalition Stewart heads is another offshoot,
monitoring hate crimes throughout the region.
   State lawmakers have also joined the fight against racism.
   ``Idaho now has the most comprehensive anti-hate crime
legislative package in the United States,'' said Stewart.
   Idaho is one of 18 states, and the only one in the Northwest,
with laws against paramilitary training. A ``malicious harassment''
law makes it a felony to assault someone on the basis of race,
religion or ethnic background. And that law will be strengthened by
another measure passed last month. It calls for an annual report on
hate crimes and requires law officers investigating any crime to
note whether harassment was involved.
   Civil rights leaders are confident the white supremacists will
never find their ``promised land'' in the Northwest. But they do
not plan to relax their vigilance.
   ``As long as they exist in any organized form, there is going to
be harassment to people of color, Jews and other minority groups,''
Gissel said. ``We're going to do whatever we can to hasten the day
when those types of activities cease to occur.''
