<HEAD>Judge Releases Older Couple Who Robbed Bank to Pay Mortgage</HEAD>

   A judge has freed an older couple who robbed a bank
at gunpoint because they couldn't afford their mortgage payments.
   Herbert Butler, 65, and his wife Eleni, 61, admitted holding up a
London bank last New Year's Eve in an effort to meet mortgage
payments of $2,140 a month. They receive a monthly pension of $41.
   In Friday's decision, Judge Raymond Dean in Old Bailey Court gave
the Butlers a two-year suspended sentence and let them go.
   ``You are both of retirement age and must have been quite
desparate to embark on that course of action,'' he said.
   The judge said he was convinced Butler did not intend to use the
gun he carried during the robbery and that they would not rob again.
   The Butlers wore ski masks and wigs during the robbery. When they
demanded money, the teller reportedly said, ``Don't be silly.''
   But Butler brandished his gun, and the teller handed over nearly
$3,800 in cash.
   The couple fled in a vehicle, but police arrested them at a
traffic light.
   According to court testimony, Butler told the officers: ``All
right, all right, you have caught us. But take it easy on her, she
has heart trouble.''
   The couple left court without comment Friday. Their lawyer said
they ``are delighted with the result and just want to start a new
life,'' according to Press Association, Britain's domestic news
agency.
