FT  21 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Nicholson gets its Butler - Legal
Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholson Graham &amp; Jones, a medium-sized City law firm has appointed Mr Jim
Butler, former senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick, as a non-executive
member of its partnership board. Mr Butler is chairman of European Passenger
Services and a non-executive director of British Rail, Tomkins, the
conglomerate, and Camelot, the consortium put together to run the UK
National Lottery. His role at Nicholson will be to advise on management
issues and act in an ambassadorial capacity.
Mr Michael Johns, Nicholson's managing partner said the firm was looking for
a non-executive with a professional services background to take an objective
look at the partnership. By appointing Mr Butler the firm was 'trying to say
we're ambitious, that we want to be seen to be different and that we are
flexible', he said.
Nicholson is not the first firm to take on outsiders in a non-executive
capacity. Freshfields has two non-executive members of its partnership
board. Mischon de Reya also has a non-executive chairman. But Nicholson is
the first medium-sized City firm to take-on a non-executive and Mr Johns
believes Mr Butler's appointment could spark a trend. Management is an issue
for all law firms at the moment, he says.
