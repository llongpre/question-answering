   Butler Manufacturing Co. said its board authorized it to buy back as many as 600,000, or 12%, of its common shares outstanding, in the open market and in private transactions. 

   The supplier of building systems and construction services, which has about five million shares outstanding, said the shares will cost about $18 million. 
The buyback is aimed at improving the value of the shares, Butler said. 

   Most of the cash required for the repurchases will come from the business units and assets being sold as a part of a previously announced restructuring. 
The remaining cash will come from operations, Butler said.
