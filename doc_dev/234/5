Eric Holtz of Simi Valley said it was mere coincidence that, on his birthday, 
he scored three times to account for the South's only goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Right. 
</P>
<P>
 The South got four opportunities to score on penalty shots in the last minutes 
of its 3-2 victory over the West on Friday in U. S. Olympic Festival field 
hockey action at Augsburg College's Nelson Anderson Field. 
</P>
<P>
Guess who attempted them all? 
</P>
<P>
What a coincidence! 
</P>
<P>
The last one, from 10 yards, came with 10 seconds left in the game and eluded 
West goalie Robbie Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
With that, the celebration was on. Holtz first was mobbed by teammates, then 
presented with a birthday cake. 
</P>
<P>
There was plenty to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
The South, composed of 15 members of the U. S. national team -- including nine 
from the Valley area -- finished round-robin play with a 5-1 record. It will 
face the East (4-1-1) in the gold-medal game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The West, which is 1-3-2 and will play for a bronze medal, scored its only two 
goals in the game's first 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy Hoang of Westlake Village scored 11 minutes into the game and, two 
minutes later, younger brother Binh duplicated the feat. 
</P>
<P>
Each of Holtz's goals came off a penalty corner, which is essentially a free 
shot on goal from any place more than 10 yards away.
