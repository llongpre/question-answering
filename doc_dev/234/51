   Eaton Corp. President William E. Butler was named chief
executive officer, launching top management changes designed
to spur productivity and thin bureaucracy at the Cleveland
automotive supplier.
   Mr. Butler, 60 years old, succeeds James R. Stover, who
will remain chairman until he retires at year end at age 65,
Eaton's standard retirement age. As part of the change, Eaton
said it would abolish its three operating groups -- truck
parts, automotive parts and electronic controls -- and
replace them with six smaller groups reporting to an
executive vice president in charge of operations, Alexander
M. Cutler, 40.

   Mr. Cutler, the former head of the controls group, reports
to a new president and chief operating officer, John S.
Rodewig. Mr. Rodewig, 57, formerly head of Eaton's European
operations, was named head of the truck parts group in
January.
   Messrs. Butler, Rodewig and Cutler will serve on a senior
management council along with Stephen R. Hardis, 56, chief
financial officer, and Gerald L. Gherlein, 53, executive vice
president and general counsel.
   Most heads of the six individual groups will remain
outside Eaton's Cleveland headquarters but will have broader
responsibility. "We're trying to bring these business units
closer to senior management and shorten the decision-making
process," Mr. Butler said.
   While the timing of the succession, effective immediately,
surprised observers, the selection of Mr. Butler didn't. A
34-year Eaton veteran who had been president and chief
operating officer for two years, Mr. Butler was considered
the frontrunner since the retirement earlier this year of
Robert W. Gillison. Mr. Gillison, 55, resigned after the
vehicles group he headed was split into two smaller units.
   In recent years, Eaton has been disengaging itself from
material handling, defense electronics and other diversified
businesses and has spent nearly $700 million adding to its
automotive parts and controls. Although Mr. Butler said Eaton
won't be pruning any more businesses, he added that the
company will continue to seek acquisitions in its core areas.
Eaton, like other suppliers to the auto and appliance
industries, has been badly hurt by the recession and doesn't
expect improvement in 1991.
   "We've had a good game plan," Mr. Butler said. "We've just
got to turn up the intensity. With the noose tightening
around the world, we've got to be working harder on
productivity than we've ever done in the past." Mr. Butler
said he and Mr. Stover had been discussing the changes for a
month, and made the changes now to avoid "dropping bombs" at
Eaton's world-wide managers meeting in Florida next month.
