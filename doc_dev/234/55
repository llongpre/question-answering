Butler, who practiced in Los Angeles but lived in Nixon's hometown of Whittier 
for nearly 40 years, was successful in arranging refinancing for Nixon's San 
Clemente estate, at a time after the resignation when the former President was 
in some financial difficulty. He also successfully represented Nixon against 
proposed state Bar disciplinary proceedings.

In a long career as both a lawyer and certified public accountant, Butler, who 
was born in South Dakota, also served as chairman of the executive committee of 
the California Bar Assn. and for a time was chairman of a tax reform commission 
named by Gov. George Deukmejian.

He leaves his wife, Jean, a son, Bob, and two grandchildren. Services will be 
held at 11 a.m. Tuesday at Hillcrest Congregational Church in Whittier.
