   Butler Manufacturing Co. said its board adopted a preferred share purchase rights plan designed to deter unwanted takeover attempts. 

   Each right would entitle holders to buy 1/100 of a share of a new series of preferred stock. 
The plan would go into effect if a potential acquirer gains a stake of at least 20% of Butler's common stock or announces a tender offer. 

   A spokesman for the supplier of building systems and construction services said the plan wasn't in response to any takeover effort and that it isn't aware of any takeover attempt.
