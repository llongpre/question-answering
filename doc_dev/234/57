   A reporter's videotape shows a white
supremacist who is accused of sedition telling an audience, ``Hate
is our law, revenge is our duty.''
   Peter Lake of Los Angeles taped Richard G. Butler, 69, of Hayden
Lake, Idaho, making the statement at two events in 1983: a cross
burning in Los Angeles, and the swearing in of two Aryan Warriors,
making them members of Butler's Aryan Nations group in Idaho.
   Lake was the government's first witness in the trial of 14 white
men in federal court _ 10 on charges of plotting a violent
overthrow of the government, five for plotting the murder of
federal officials, and two for transporting stolen money.
   He testified Thursday about how, using the name Peter Lawrence,
he went to Butler's Aryan Nations compound in Hayden Lake and
pretended to become a follower of the group's beliefs.
   Butler, who knew he was being taped, made the statement in a
context in which he said the Aryans had the law of hate and the
duty of revenge so long as ``the alien is in the land'' and
occupies ``the seat of power.''
   Conviction of conspiring to overthrow the government by force
has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $20,000 fine;
plotting to murder federal officials has a maximum penalty of life
imprisonment. Transporting stolen money has a maximum penalty of 10
years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Lake, a writer and television producer, said he investigated
Butler for a report for a Los Angeles TV station and a magazine
published by Larry Flynt.
   Under cross-examination, Lake said that he carried three
.45-caliber pistols on an airliner in his luggage on the trip, that
he lied to Butler and others at the compound, that he took the
initiation as an Aryan Warrior insincerely, that no one ever told
him that as a warrior he would have to kill or bomb or try to
overthrow the government by violence, and that his companion on the
trip, a felon, also was armed.
   Because of the large number of defendants, opening statements
took two days, even though four defendants put off statements until
the government has finished its case.
   Defendant Ardie McBrearty made his own statement, telling the
jury that the government's case was ``a little truth here, a little
truth there, and a whole lot of imagination in between.''
   Attorney N.C. Deday LaRene said his client, the Rev. Robert
Miles, of Cohoctah, Mich., believes the races should be separate.
``He speaks of being at war with the government,'' LaRene said, but
likened Miles' rhetoric to a coach telling his players before a
game, ``cripple them, go in there and kill them.''
