   A U.S. Navy chemist has found a way to convert
sewer gas into diamonds.
   Dr. James E. Butler tapped Washington's sewage system for the
methane gas he used to grow diamond crystals at the Naval Research
Laboratory. Other chemists at the lab have grown diamond crystals
by using an oxygen-acetylene torch, Butler said in a telephone
interview Tuesday.
   The tiny diamonds made in his process _ using chemical vapors to
deposit crystals on a surface _ could have a variety of industrial
applications, including abrasives, protective coatings, and
computer insulators, he said.
   But ``I don't think we'll be able to grow diamonds of gemstone
size and quality in the near future,'' Butler said.
   The Navy scientists are working on a process that entails
heating chemical vapors, under normal air pressure or less, and
getting carbon from the vapor to crystallize on a surface at
temperatures of about 1,440 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Current industrial processes for making diamonds require much
higher heat and pressure.
   Why use sewer gas?
   ``Sewer gas was just a case of having a convenient, inexpensive
source of methane,'' Butler said. The Naval Research Laboratory is
next door to Washington's Blue Plains Waste Water Treatment Plant.
   Methane, a combination of carbon and hydrogen, is a primary
constituent of sewer gas. It is generally burned as waste.
   Researchers in other countries have performed some similar
experiments, Butler said, commenting that such sources of carbon as
vodka have also been used.
   It will be years before the diamond-making system could be
developed into an industrial scale, he said, but when that happens
plenty of raw material will be available.
