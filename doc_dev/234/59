   When Clarence Fountain was 9 years old, he
joined a gospel troupe called the Happyland Jubilee Singers. Nearly
50 years later, he is still praising the Lord in song.
   He and the group, now called Clarence Fountain and the Five
Blind Boys of Alabama, are appearing in the musical ``The Gospel at
Colonus.'' The show sets Sophocles' tale of Oedipus the King within
the framework of a black Pentecostal church service and its rousing
gospel music.
   ``I learned most of my gospel singing in school,'' says
Fountain, sitting backstage at Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theater
where ``Colonus'' is playing. His school, which went from grades
one through 12, was the Talladega Institute for the Deaf and Blind
in Talladega, Ala.
   Fountain, who has been blind since he was 2, sang in the school
choir, but gospel music was a part of his life even before that.
His father was a steward in a Methodist church in Selma, Ala.
   ``I was the only one in the family who sang, though,'' he says.
``It became something that grows on you.''
   The Happyland Jubilee Singers continued to perform after
Fountain and the other members left school early to perform during
the mid-1940s. In 1947, they moved to Chattanooga, Tenn., where
they had a 15-minute gospel broadcast each weekday at 6:45 a.m.
   The name ``Five Blind Boys of Alabama'' was born the following
year, courtesy of a Newark, N.J., promoter who began to manage the
troupe. The Blind Boys would play one-night stands, all over the
country, appearing in schools, churches and auditoriums. They
eventually worked their way up to such places as the Apollo Theater
and Carnegie Hall in New York, and made a lot of records.
   One of their songs, ``Precious Lord, Take My Hand,'' was a best
seller in 1953. ``It was a touching song,'' Fountain recalls.
``People responded.''
   ``We always sang gospel,'' Fountain says. ``That was the big
thing. You couldn't sing rock 'n' roll and then turn around and
sing gospel. People wouldn't follow you.
   ``A lot of those people singing rock 'n' roll, started by
singing gospel in church. People like Sam Cooke and Aretha
Franklin. There were a lot of them. That's why they can sing it so
good.''
   Today, Fountain says, there is a contemporary gospel sound,
religious music that has a rock 'n' roll beat. The Five Blind Boys
have adapted to it.
   ``You have to keep up with the style,'' Fountain says. ``If you
don't keep up with the style, you're automatically behind the
times.''
   Fountain writes some of the group's songs with Sam Butler, who
plays guitar for the troupe.
   ``Writing songs is just like writing a poem,'' Fountain says.
``As long as it rhymes and comes out right, you can take any poem
and turn it into a song.''
   If Fountain gets an idea for a song, he turns it over in his
head, memorizes it and then tells Butler who writes it down.
   It was through Butler that Fountain and the Blind Boys met
composer Bob Telson and director Lee Breuer, the creators of ``The
Gospel at Colonus.''
   ``They had the lyrics and the tunes but they didn't have the
ingredients to go along with it,'' Fountain says. ``It's just like
cookin' bread. You got the bread but you don't have the salt, so it
don't taste like bread. We put the salt in.''
   The show has played at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and
in 1983 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as well as all over Europe
before tackling Broadway.
   ``The Gospel at Colonus'' stars actor Morgan Freeman who
narrates the church service, and it features several other gospel
groups, such as J.J. Farley and the Soul Stirrers and the J.D.
Steele Singers.
   But the Blind Boys get to sing in the evening's two
show-stopping numbers, ``No Never'' and ``Lift Me Up.'' They bring
down the house.
   ``It's easier to do than a concert,'' Fountain says. ``With a
concert, you don't rest. You have to really get down. In the
musical, we get a chance to breathe a little.''
   Today, Fountain, who has been married three times, makes his
home in Detroit. The rest of the Blind Boys live all over the
country, from North Carolina to Minnesota. Before a concert tour
starts, they all meet to rehearse their material and then hit the
road. Fountain and the Rev. Olice Thomas are the only original
members of the group still performing.
   ``We all have good ears,'' he says. ``If it doesn't sound right,
we just leave it alone. We all agree on one thing. If it sounds
good to us, we cut a record.
   ``My dream was to sing to the masses of people and when this
play came along that was my dream. And it's happening just like I
dreamed it would. We've come a long way. From the sticks to
Broadway.''
