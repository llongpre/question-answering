   Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits must
give five days notice if it decides to go ahead with efforts to take
over Church's Fried Chicken before a court ruling on Church's
pending appeal, a federal court says.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal on Thursday ordered New
Orleans-based Popeyes not to buy Church's stock without notice until
the Jan. 12 hearing on the San Antonio-based company's fight against
a takeover.
   Church's has asked the 5th Circuit to stop Popeyes $290 million
takeover bid, claiming it is based on information misappropriated by
two former Church's employees now working for Popeyes.
   Ernest E. Renaud, president of Church's, called the ruling a
victory for his company, the No. 2 fried chicken outlet in the
country.
   ``Popeyes isn't going anywhere for the time being and I believe
we have a good shot at winning on appeal because the case law is in
Church's favor,'' Renaud said.
   Popeyes attorney, Peter Butler, said the ruling doesn't slow down
the effort by Popeyes' owner Al Copeland to buy Church's stock with
an $8-dollar-a-share tender offer, which expires tonight. Church's
board of directors is trying to find other buyers to fend off
Popeyes buyout offer, which it has said is not enough.
   ``We're delighted,'' Butler said. ``The ruling still allows us to
disseminate our disclosures as ordered by the district court, and
get the clock moving toward having that injunction lifted.''
   U. S. District Court Judge Charles Schwartz refused to stop
Popeyes effort to take over Church's but ordered that it not proceed
until 10 days after the company disclosed further information to the
Securities and Exchange Commission and Church's stockholders.
   ``Actually, the action by the 5th Circuit does nothing to set us
back and we will be getting one primary obstacle lifted once the
10-day period is over and the district court injunction is lifted,''
Butler said.
