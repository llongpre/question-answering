   Two former executives of a firm subcontracted
to work on the B-1 bomber pleaded guilty to charges involving a
fraudulent check-cashing scheme and illegal overbilling for time
spent working on the military jet.
   Robert F. Butler, former owner of Butler Industries and Purkey
Co. Inc., and Steven Wooten, former general manager of Butler
Industries, entered their pleas Monday before U.S. District Judge
Stephen V. Wilson.
   The pleas were part of a deal in which the defendants
acknowledged the government's case against them but claimed they
never intended to violate the law, said Butler's attorney, Gerson
S. Horn. The arrangement allows them to present their defense in
any civil litigation arising from the case.
   ``It would have taken a tremendous amount of money to fight this
case,'' Horn said. ``The government threatened to indict more''
unless the plea bargain was accepted.
   One of the three federal grand jury indictments accused both
Butler and Wooten of overbilling Rockwell Inc., the aerospace
contractor on the U.S. Air Force's B-1 bomber, for time spent
changing orders on parts for the bomber.
   Rockwell was billed for 495 hours of work on the subcontract,
445 more than were actually involved, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
J. Stephen Czuleger. The billing amounted to $200,000 in erroneous
charges, government officials said.
   Horn said, however, that several company employees could present
testimony to show that the amount of time devoted to the change
orders was not overestimated.
   The other indictment charged Butler, 54, and Wooten, 30, with
cashing company checks valued at more than $144,000 made out to
fictitious payees over a two-year period. The checks were then
illegally deducted on corporate tax returns as a cost of goods
sold, Czuleger said.
   Butler was indicted in another bogus check-cashing scam of more
than $259,000 involving Purkey Co. Inc.
   Horn said the two men claim they were writing the phony checks
to obtain cash for real business expenses. The company was
habitually overdrawn and would otherwise have been unable to get
the money, he said.
   Butler, who pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy, presenting
false claims to the United States, subscribing to a false corporate
income tax return and assisting in the preparation of a false tax
return, faces a maximum two years in prison and $240,000 in fines.
He will be sentenced June 20.
   Wooten, who pleaded guilty to similar charges in two of the
indictments, faces one year and fines of $130,000. He will be
sentenced April 25.
