FT  27 NOV 92 / People: Unifying role for Butler
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tom Butler (right) makes the move up from heading EDS-Scicon's manufacturing
division to managing director of the UK subsidiary as John Bateman takes
responsibility for the US computing services firm's operations in Europe.
Butler, 'just the wrong side of 40', has been with the company for just two
years but his former career includes periods with Hoskyns, now part of Cap
Gemini Sogeti, Andersen Consulting and Perot Systems, the company started by
US presidential candidate Ross Perot after his controversial exodus from
General Motors.
A mechanical engineer by background, educated at Glasgow and Strathclyde
universities, Butler's early experience was in the oil and chemical
industries.
EDS-Scicon was formed through the merger of the US company EDS with
SD-Scicon of the UK a year ago with Bateman as its first managing director.
It is now one of the largest facilities management companies in the UK,
taking responsibility for its customers' entire data processing operations.
Butler will continue moves to focus the company on customers' needs.
EDS-Scicon is now well integrated structurally but unifying the two, very
different, companies would take 'several more months if not several years'.
