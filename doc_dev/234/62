   A 2-year-old boy mauled by six Rottweiler dogs
at his grandmother's house was in critical condition Wednesday,
authorities said.
   The Tuesday night attack left Steven Selfridge of Saxonburg with
puncture wounds and damage to his windpipe and one lung, according
to Dr. Max Ramenofsky of Allegheny General Hospital.
   The child also lost a lot of blood, Ramenofsky said.
   Butler Township police said Steven and his 11-year-old cousin
were playing at the home when one of the Rottweilers, a breed known
for strong neck and jaw muscles, came onto the porch and dragged
him into a fenced-in yard.
   A half-dozen dogs then mauled the boy until he was unconscious,
police said.
   The boy's grandmother, Alma Evanick, had been in the coronary
care unit of Butler Memorial Hospial, said Butler Township Police
Chief Gary Garman. One dog lived at the house and the five others
were brought by the visiting 11-year-old, authorities said.
   The cousin, Jamie Ross, tried to stop the attack by shielding
him with her body, rescuers said.
   ``She's the real hero here,'' said Chris Jones, a paramedic with
Butler Ambulance Service who was the first to arrive at the scene.
``At one point she tried to cover the little boy with her body.
   ``When she saw it wasn't going go work, she ran into the house
and called 911.''
   Jamie, who was bitten, was treated at Butler County Memorial
Hospital and released.
   Jones rescued the boy by putting on protective firefighter's
gear and chasing away the dogs with blasts from a fire
extinguisher.
   The dogs were being held in quarantine at the home, police said.
