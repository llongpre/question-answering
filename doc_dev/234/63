Well, it's official: No more Ricky Butler fat jokes allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The former prince of pork rinds, duke of double dips, earl of eclairs, baron of 
burritos is hereby released from all heckling sessions. The wait for his weight 
to drop is complete. The Chunkster Dunkster, now at a more manageable 250 
pounds, has left the state of portly and is on his way to pleasingly plump. 
</P>
<P>
And not a moment too soon, says UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan, whose team has 
experienced a mini-resurgence with the new and improved Butler at center. 
</P>
<P>
In two months' time, Irvine has gone from being a team hell-bent on chaos to a 
group of sneakered funnels, where almost every pass eventually makes its way 
into the low post where Butler resides. Along the way, Irvine has become a 
respectable team and, at times, dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Butler has had help, mind you. When he struggled in December and January, 
guards Kevin Floyd and Rod Palmer did what they could to keep Irvine afloat. 
And now, as teams begin to drape their defenses around Butler, forwards Mike 
Doktorczyk and Jeff Herdman pump away from the three-point line, enough times 
to find themselves now ranked among the nation's leaders in long-range shooting 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
But truth be known, it is Butler who makes the difference. Logic dictates that 
short shots, like slam dunks or layups that lightly kiss the glass, have a 
better chance of going in than jumpers from press row. With that in mind, 
Mulligan has resorted to an old standby, which is the inside game. It worked 
before, with the likes of Kevin Magee and Wayne Engelstad; it works again, this 
time with Butler. 
</P>
<P>
If not, Irvine might as well save itself the cost of chartering a bus for next 
month's Big West Conference tournament at Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Strange thing is, Butler isn't tall -- 6-feet-6, tops. He isn't fast. He isn't 
a leaper. "I can jump about this high," he says, holding his thumb and 
forefinger about two inches apart. 
</P>
<P>
But he has a sense for the game and a knack for making difficult catches and 
perfect passes. He also is proud owner of a considerable bottom, which makes it 
possible for Butler to carve out space in the land of the giants. No amount of 
exercise and dieting has affected this, uh, asset. 
</P>
<P>
"People always tell me I've got a big butt," he says. "They always tell me 
that's the key to my success." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, but Mulligan likes to think it was the 40 or so pounds Butler has shed 
since summer. At least now, Butler can make it up and down the court without 
needing a Twinkie timeout. No longer is his body-fat level higher than that of 
a walrus. 
</P>
<P>
Back in December, as he sat on the bench against San Diego State, Butler 
decided something had to give, mainly his weight. "It wasn't that I ate a lot," 
he says, "it's just that I ate all the time." 
</P>
<P>
So he started staying after practice to ride a stationary bicycle. He started 
eating less. And just when he thought he had made progress, Irvine played UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
There are certain moments, so humbling and embarrassing, that you never forget 
them. The evening of Dec. 15 was one such time for Butler. 
</P>
<P>
As he took his place on the court, UNLV's David Butler introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to dunk over you, fat boy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Or . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This fat guy can't hold me tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Butler didn't quite know what to do. After all, he was on the rotund 
side. And this was UNLV we were talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Butler -- Ricky, that is -- received a measure of revenge 
when Irvine upset Vegas at the Bren Center. The victory was as sweet as a slice 
of chocolate cake. And more filling, too. 
</P>
<P>
It's been quite a trip, this journey from inactivity (Butler missed his 
freshman season because of academic deficiencies) to borderline stardom. This 
is the same guy (a svelte 230 pounds at the time) who outplayed the famed J.R. 
Reid at a high school tournament, who was recruited by 19 of the top 20 teams 
that year, who was listed at or near the top of every California player 
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
J.R.? LeRon Ellis? Bryan Williams? Butler was considered their equal. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope one day I can have that back," Butler says. 
</P>
<P>
He's trying. His scoring average, almost non-existent at season's beginning, is 
steadily climbing. In Butler's past six games, he has averaged 19.3 points and 
8.3 rebounds. Over that same period, his field goal percentage is a robust 60. 
"I'm just starting to play good," he says. Just imagine if he started a season 
the way he's ending this one. Consider the possibilities of a Butler who 
arrives at 1989 summer practice with a lunch-box mentality, rather than just a 
lunch box. Already, Butler has plans.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to come here next season as a lean, mean, fighting machine," he 
says. "I'll be ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, ha, so Butler finally sees the light. The good news is, this one isn't 
inside a refrigerator.
