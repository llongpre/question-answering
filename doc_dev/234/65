Photographer Jack Butler deals with societal problems and family issues through 
his photographic sculptures and various wall pieces. 
</P>
<P>
But with Butler there is a contradiction. Photographs intrigue him, yet he 
rarely shoots photographs. His images largely are collected: from books, 
calendars, throw-away flyers, photographs, newspapers or any mass-produced 
image. If he sees something intriguing or that is potentially intriguing, he 
saves it. 
</P>
<P>
Seven images from Butler's current series, "The Trial," are on display at the 
Cypress College Photography Gallery until Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The large 38-by 49-inch photographs feature work from a 1960s murder trial in 
which Butler has masked the characters' faces and hands so they become 
ambiguous and strange. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the play between the two-dimensionality of the figures and the 
photographic reality of the clothing and the stuff around them," Butler said. 
"I like the jarring conflict between the real and the non-real in the 
photograph." The "Trial" started out in a small secondhand store where Butler 
found a box with hundreds of old photographs. He spent an afternoon looking 
them over to cull out 18 photos for his project. 
</P>
<P>
He thought the photographs didn't look real, but staged, like something you 
might see on television. 
</P>
<P>
He rephotographed the original press photos and isolated the primary characters 
of the courtroom setting. "Basically the treatment of the characters is 
essentially to neutralize them so they aren't individuals," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Then he cut out the figures from the rephotographed work and obliterated the 
faces and hands with white paper. Next he raised the cut-out figures and the 
titles off a dark background, lighting them so they cast a shadow for a 
three-dimensional look. Then he rephotographed and enlarged them. 
</P>
<P>
Butler first got interested in photography while studying art for advertising. 
He was more intrigued in what the images meant rather than using them in an 
advertising sense. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, 43, was born in Oswego, N.Y., and reared in Arizona. In 1960, he moved 
to Pasadena and later earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in art at Cal 
State Los Angeles. He also received an master of fine arts from UCLA. 
Currently, he teaches photography at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I just teach photography as a medium," Butler said. "It's like a language, you 
teach someone a language and they can do a grocery list or poetry or scientific 
studies." 
</P>
<P>
It is the context into which photographed images are placed that has come to 
fascinate Butler most. 
</P>
<P>
"I became interested in (photographs') societal context," Butler said. "Each 
time it's placed in another context its meaning changes. Let's say you pick a 
snapshot image. If you see it in someone's photo album in their house it has a 
certain connotation about it. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took that same image and put it on the wall in the Museum of Modern Art 
it would have a different connotation. If you take the same photograph and use 
it on an editorial page of a newspaper it has a different connotation. 
</P>
<P>
"The meaning of a photograph is so dependent on its context. Its meaning 
changes as its audience or viewer sees it based on their own experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 "Trial," a series of black-and-white images by photographer Jack Butler, will 
be on display until Dec. 1 at the Cypress College Photo Gallery, in Technical 
Education Building 1, 9200 Valley View, Cypress. Hours: Monday through 
Thursday, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday, 8 a.m. to noon. Admission is free. For

display through Dec. 1 at the Cypress College Photography Gallery. CLIFF OTTO / 
Los Angeles Times; Photo, "On the Pains of Judging" is a panel of "The Trial." 
Actual photos were reproduced and doctored to make images fall between 
"two-dimensionality of the figures and photographic reality," Butler says.
