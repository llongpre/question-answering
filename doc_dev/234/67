   The Supreme Court today used the case of a
South Carolina death row inmate to limit the ability of criminal
defendants to challenge their convictions in federal court.
   The court, in a 5-4 decision, upheld the conviction of Horace
Butler, sentenced to die for the 1980 murder of Pamela Lane.
   The court refused to apply retroactively a 1988 ruling that bars
police from questioning a suspect about any crime once the suspect
has invoked his right to have a lawyer present.
   The body of Ms. Lane, an 18-year-old clerk at a convenience
store near Charleston, was discovered near a bridge July 17, 1980.
   Butler was arrested six weeks later on assault and battery
charges unrelated to the woman's death.
   He obtained a lawyer's representation after refusing to talk to
police without an attorney present. Sometime later, police
questioned him about Ms. Lane's death and Butler confessed he shot
her.
   Butler asked a federal judge to throw out his conviction on
grounds that, under the Supreme Court's 1988 ruling, his rights
were violated by unlawful police questionning.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
it was too late for the 1988 ruling to be of any help to Butler.
   He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice William J. Brennan said the
decision _ by refusing to apply new court rulings to previous
criminal cases _ ``strips state prisoners of virtually any
meaningful federal review of the constitutionality of their
incarceration.''
   He was joined in dissent by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   The case is Butler vs. McKellar, 88-6677.
