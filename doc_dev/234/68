Co. said it signed a letter of intent to buy Naturalite Inc. of Garland, Texas. 

   Terms weren't disclosed. 

   Naturalite, a closely held designer and maker of skylights, had sales of about $20 million in 1986. 
The transaction, subject to the approval of the boards of both companies, is expected to be completed in May, Butler said.
