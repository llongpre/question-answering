   A federal judge began hearing testimony
Thursday on a request by Pennwalt Corp. to block a stockholders
meeting Centaur Partners has demanded in its $765 million hostile
bid for Pennwalt.
   Centaur, which owns about 13 percent of Pennwalt's stock, hopes
to use the meeting to replace the chemical company's board with
directors sympathetic to its offer.
   In issuing the demand Tuesday, Centaur delivered proxies that it
said represented owners of approximately 34.6 percent of Pennwalt's
outstanding shares.
   State law requires a company to hold any meeting requested by
stockholders with at least 20 percent of the firm's shares.
   Centaur, whose principals are New York financiers Abbey J. Butler
and Melvyn J. Estrin, launched the $100-a-share bid in mid-December.
Pennwalt's stock closed unchanged Thursday at $105.62{ on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Pennwalt claims Centaur included inadequate disclosure in the
tender offer, would be short at least $57 million to finance the
merger and failed to reveal that Butler filed for personal
bankruptcy six years ago and was accused of fraud in 1979.
   Attorney Matthew Broderick, representing Pennwalt, alleged in a
legal brief that Pennwalt would suffer irreparable harm without a
temporary injunction to stop the meeting.
   ``The court should recognize that the public interest is not
served by permitting a takeover developed through misleading public
statements to come to fruition,'' the brief said.
   Bruce Kauffman, the lawyer for Centaur, and attorney Stuart
Savett, speaking for a group of stockholders, disagreed and insisted
the only issue was whether a stockholders meeting should be held.
   ``We are not concerned with whether this is a good offer, a fair
offer or a bad offer, but whether there has been full disclosure,''
Kaufman told U.S. District Judge Robert Gawthrop. ``It is up to the
shareholders to decide about the offer.''
   Savett also said the stockholders should be allowed to meet
quickly and make the decision.
   In his brief, Kauffman said, ``Centaur has disclosed all material
information with respect to the financing of the offer as required
under the federal securities laws.''
   Broderick called Butler as a hostile witness and brought out that
he had filed for personal bankruptcy in 1983, reporting debts of
more than $1 million and assets of about $3,500.
   A court document also disclosed that in 1979 in California,
Butler and others were accused of fraudulent stock transfers
totaling nearly $400,000.
   Butler said there was never any adjudication of the charges.
   In a related development, Pennwalt dropped a lawsuit against
PaineWebber Inc., which has agreed to provide $400 million in
short-term financing for the takeover.
   The lawsuit contended the tender offer violated federal
securities laws by containing misleading statements.
