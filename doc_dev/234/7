   North American Ventures Inc., which has agreed to acquire Butler International Inc. for about $139 million, said it purchased one million Butler shares from Gabelli Asset Management Co. 

   North American has offered $20.50 a share for Butler, a Montvale, N.J., aviation services company. 
At the time the offer was announced, Mario Gabelli, chairman of the New York-based investment company, expressed disappointment with the offer and said he would try to find another bid for Butler. 

   North American, a holding company whose interests include a leather-goods concern, paid $19.25 a share in cash for the Gabelli holding, about 15% of the Butler's shares outstanding. 
The Gabelli group still owns about 437,100 Butler shares. 
The $20.50 offer is $16 in cash and $4.50 in stock. 

   The acquisition, subject to approval by Butler shareholders, is expected to be completed in early 1987. 

   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Butler shares closed at $18.25, unchanged.
