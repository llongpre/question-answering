<TEXT>     "I don't think Robby will hit first all year," Butler said this week during
his return as a Los Angeles Dodger. "I think he'll move down where he should
be hitting. It'll help him.;    "I talked to him a little, and my comment to
him was, 'Just do your thing. Don't worry about it.' Robby Thompson is no
Brett Butler, and I'm no Robby Thompson.";    Thompson is 4 for 32 (.125). He
showed a spark in the last two games against the Dodgers, scoring three times
and hitting a homer and a double. He has yet to single.;    There have been
discussions in the organization about moving Thompson down and simply moving
the meat of the order up. But a management source said Thursday that "nothing
is imminent" and that Thompson has shown signs of breaking his slump.;  ETC:
Butler, who is hitting .270 for his new team, said of the incessant boos
directed at him at Candlestick: "It's over. The page is turned. The career
goes forward. I'm a Dodger." . . . The Giants resume their homestand with
three games against Houston, beginning tonight, and then three against San
Diego. . . . Will Clark has hits in eight of the nine games. . . . After
homering in five of his first six games, Kevin Mitchell went without one in
the Dodgers series. But he was 4 for 11 against Los Angeles and is hitting
.375. . . . The Giants' 3-6 record matches last season's start, but they were
5 1/2 games behind Cincinnati at that point in 1990. They are 3 1/2 behind San
Diego this season.  </TEXT>
