   A Florida man said Monday that he and
his wife who survived 66 days adrift on a life raft menaced by
sharks tried to signal more than three dozen passing ships before
one spotted them.
   William Butler, 59, said he and his wife Simone, 56, of Miami,
survived on raw fish and purified water until a Costa Rican coast
guard boat picked them up in the Pacific Ocean, 12 miles off the
coast, on Saturday.
   ``We were surrounded by sharks practically all the time and we
felt a lot of panic but thanks to God they never attacked us,''
Butler, an electrical engineer, said by telephone from a hospital in
the port of Golfito.
   He said he and his wife set sail from Panama on May 24 for Hawaii
in their 40-foot sloop, the Siboney. They had been drifting east in
the life raft since June 15, when whales attacked their boat about
1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica, he said.
   ``In no more than 15 minutes, our boat was destroyed,'' he said.
``But God, always present in our prayers, helped us because we
carried a life raft and we got in it immediately, taking all the
things we would need.''
   They had eight cans of food, some cookies, a water purifier and a
fishing hook, Butler said.
   ``After 20 days adrift all the food was gone,'' he said. ``Then
we started to fish. Thanks to God we always had food and with the
filter we drank fresh water.''
   Before they got in the raft, he said, he sent three distress
messages over the radio but no one heard them.
   ``At least 40 ships passed and didn't see us and every night we
thought we could die,'' he said. ``But the next day, in the morning,
we prayed again.''
   Egbert Vallecillo, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman, said Butler told
him by telephone that the sharks punctured the raft several times
and the couple sealed the holes with a repair kit.
   Vallecillo said he spoke to Butler from the U.S. Coast Guard's
Pacific Command headquarters in Alameda, 10 miles east of San
Francisco.
   In San Jose, Butler said he and his wife were praying again
Saturday afternoon when they saw the Costa Rican coast guard boat.
   ``But they saw us first,'' he said.
   They were picked up 20 miles off Punta Burica, at the border with
Panama and near Golfito, 200 miles southeast of San Jose.
   Butler lost 49 of his 175 pounds and his wife dropped from 150
pounds to 92, he said.
   ``But we are in pretty good shape because we had food all the
time and the doctor at the hospital in Golfito said we can return to
Miami next Monday,'' he said.
   Butler, a Cuban-American, came to the United States from Cuba in
1960. He has two children who live in Miami.
   ``It was a happy ending,'' he said. ``I'm going home to Miami.
I'll buy another boat and will sail again.''
