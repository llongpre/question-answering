   The Age of Aquarius has given way to the age of
acquisition, and love is too busy being a buzz word to steer the
stars.
   Perfect timing, organizers say, for a 20th anniversary
production of ``Hair,'' a play that once symbolized everything '60s
and young.
   ``This is the '80s antidote to `Rambo,''' said '60s guru Timothy
Leary, brought in to help a young cast make sense of ``Hair'' two
decades after it first transformed American theater.
   ``I think it's going to fill a real need.''
   ``Hair,'' the ``American tribal rock musical,'' opened on
Broadway in April 1968 and stayed there for 1,750 performances.
   The new production of the musical opens Tuesday at The Vic
theater.
   The anti-war, anti-establishment message of the musical was a
milestone in American theater 20 years ago, and also marked the
Broadway debut of producer Michael Butler, who also brought
``Lenny,'' the story of comedian Lenny Bruce, to Broadway.
   Butler, the anti-establishment son of a wealthy Illinois family,
stuck with ``Hair'' through most of the '70s, producing it across
the United States and overseas. And he is back, producing and
promoting the new run in Chicago.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it's like going back to church,''
Butler said last week. ```Hair' is a very beautiful spiritual
experience. ... I love working with the kids, I love the message.''
   But the kids have changed.
   Many members of the current cast were still in diapers when
protests rocked the streets of America and the original
flower-power tribe sang of love and peace.
   ``I just thought it was all about drugs and something I had no
desire to see,'' said 22-year-old actress Jamie Dawn Gangi, who
plays the role of Crissy in the current $1 million production.
   Executive producer George Millman said the cast had to be taught
what the era was really like.
   ``We talked to the cast a lot,'' he said. ``We find that it's
difficult for them in that they can't feel it in the way that the
people who lived it felt it.''
   And Leary, who met with the cast several times earlier this
month, helped.
   ``About one-third of the cast was very hip and knew what was
going on, but about a third of them didn't have a clue,'' the
68-year-old Leary said from his Los Angeles home.
   ``I hung out with them. Some of them are quite naive about
political and cultural aspects of the period. But I think they're
catching on quickly.''
   The new production, which Millman and Butler hope will spark
spin-offs in other cities, has been changed slightly from the
original.
   The setting is moved from New York to the riot-torn streets of
the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Acoustics and
choreography are a vast improvement over earlier attempts,
producers say.
   This ``Hair,'' Leary says simply, is ``very much like the '80s _
high tech hippy.''
