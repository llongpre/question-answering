   A U.S. Tax Court judge admonished Internal
Revenue Service attorneys for wasting time questioning the Hunt
brothers Friday in their $300 million tax dispute trial.
   ``This witness has been completely unresponsive. You haven't
gotten a nickel's worth of evidence out of him,'' Judge Jules G.
Korner III told government attorney Deborah Butler, who had been
questioning Lamar Hunt.
   An hour into her examination of Hunt, the owner of the Kansas
City Chiefs football team, Korner gave Ms. Butler 10 minutes to
finish her questioning.
   ``You've spent a pound of time and gotten less than an ounce of
information. You'll conclude your examination of the witness in the
next 10 minutes,'' Korner said, declaring the questions a waste of
time under a federal court rule.
   After the proceedings ended, Ms. Butler said: ``If he can't
remember the facts, why was that a waste of time?''
   Hunt, subpoenaed to the stand by the IRS, repeatedly said he
could not recall specifics of conversations or documents leading up
to a partnership formed to repay the three brothers' debts of up to
$2 billion after the silver price collapse of March 1980.
   The brothers are contesting more than $300 million in 1982 taxes
the IRS says are owed from the dissolution of the partnership with
their family's Placid Oil Co.
   Ms. Butler contended Lamar Hunt had guaranteed a $1.1 billion
loan to Placid from a consortium of banks, even though he claimed
on the stand he could not remember many specifics of the agreement.
   Placid contributed $824 million of the loan to the partnership,
while the brothers contributed silver, gold stocks, and North
Dakota coal properties.
   Earlier Friday, Korner told IRS attorney Rebecca Wolfe she was
``wandering all over the lot'' in questioning William Herbert Hunt
on what the judge said was ``amply established'' in the record.
   The non-jury trial was recessed until Aug 21. The government has
almost 70 witnesses on its list to testify when the trial resumes.
   Michael Henke, attorney for Herbert and Nelson Bunker Hunt,
accused IRS attorneys of treating the wealthy Texans to a
``filibuster'' since the beginning of the trial three weeks ago.
   ``Deborah Butler has successfully filibustered the three weeks
alloted for this trial,'' Henke told a reporter.
   Ms. Butler rejected accusations of delay, saying, ``No one would
have been happer to finish (by Friday) than us.''
   Bunker is contesting $155 million in 1982 taxes, while Herbert
is contesting more than $158 million and Lamar is contesting
$505,377 in taxes.
