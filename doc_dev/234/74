   Stunned worshippers gathered for Bible
study without their church's pastor, who was in jail today accused
of killing his live-in girlfriend and burying her hours before
giving his Sunday sermon.
   ``Everybody's just knocked out and surprised,'' said Hezekiah
Butler, chairman of the board of deacons for Zion Traveler
Missionary Baptist Church, one of three churches served by the Rev.
Jonathan Hamlin.
   ``He's been a wonderful pastor and a wonderful young man. You've
never run across a finer person in the world,'' Butler said.
   Hamlin, 24, was arrested Monday by the Warren County Sheriff's
Department, accused of fatally shooting 24-year-old Lula Sims. Held
on $100,000 bond, he won't be required to enter a plea until a
grand jury issues an indictment.
   Authorities say Hamlin shot Sims in the head and chest on July
3, buried her body in woods about 40 miles southeast of Vicksburg,
and hours later preached during Sunday morning worship at Zion
Traveler.
   Sims remained buried for eight days, until Dorothy Lipscomb
persuaded Sheriff Paul Barrett to investigate her daughter's
disappearance.
   Barrett said he questioned Hamlin, a father of three, who
admitted that he had killed Sims and led officers to her shallow
grave Monday night. Police recovered the pearl-handled, .22-caliber
pistol they believe Hamlin used.
   Hamlin's estranged wife had given him the gun as a gift, Barrett
said.
   The sheriff did not provide further details of Hamlin's
admission.
   On Wednesday night, members of the congregation gathered for
Bible study at the small red brick building that houses the church.
Outside, a sign read: ``Rev. J. Hamlin, pastor.''
   ``He was just a first-class minister,'' said Daniel Clark, a
long-time member of Zion Traveler. ``That's the way it seemed to
us.''
   Hamlin, a member of Zion Traveler, was elected to lead the
500-member congregation in November after the church's longtime
pastor died, Butler said.
   The church grew under Hamlin to the point where all the
worshippers couldn't enter the sanctuary on the one Sunday each
month that the church held services, Butler said.
   Church members purchased three adjacent houses and other pieces
of property and were planning to enlarge their building.
   Sims' mother recalled a different side of Hamlin.
   ``About a month and a half ago he choked her,'' Lipscomb said
Wednesday in the living room of her small, neat Vicksburg home.
   Lipscomb said she had gone to the house Hamlin shared with her
daughter because the minister ``called me and said he was bleeding
to death.''
   After she and her husband, Carl, arrived, Lipscomb said, her
daughter ripped open the T-shirt she was wearing.
   ``Her breasts were nothing but scars and she had scars around
her neck where he had choked her.'' She said Hamlin, who had told
her daughter he was separated and getting divorced, had a small cut
on the head.
   Lipscomb said, however, that her daughter never complained to
her that Hamlin was violent. ``She was the type of person, she
would keep her problems to herself.''
   Vicksburg, a town of 35,000 along the Mississippi River, is
``stirred up about Rev. Hamlin,'' Butler said.
   ``They just don't see, as fine a man as he was, how in the world
something like that could happen.''
