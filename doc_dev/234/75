   Here is a list of the seven U.S. governors who have been
impeached and removed from office, including Evan Mecham of Arizona
who was convicted Monday:
   
   WILLIAM W. HOLDEN of North Carolina, removed in 1871.
   Holden was impeached after he unconstitutionally suspended the
right of habeas corpus and sent militia to quell violence by the Ku
Klux Klan, which was accused of murders aimed at frightening blacks
into not voting. He also arrested a number of political opponents.
   
   DAVID BUTLER, Nebraska's first governor, removed in 1871.
   Butler was removed for misappropriating school funds, but the
impeachment proceedings subsequently were expunged from the
legislative record and in 1888 he was elected to another term as
governor.
   
   WILLIAM SULZER, New York, removed in 1913.
   The Senate convicted him of three charges of misappropriation of
funds. Sulzer, a product of Tammany Hall, snubbed the machine's
patronage demands after he was elected and launched an
investigation of corruption. Annoyed legislators then dredged up
charges of financial irregularities, which even some anti-Tammany
forces agreed were true.
   
   JAMES E. ``Farmer Jim'' FERGUSON, Texas, 1917.
   Ferguson was convicted by the Senate on 10 charges, some
stemming from a fight over control of the University of Texas.
Ferguson resigned a day before his conviction was announced.
   His wife, Miriam ``Ma'' Ferguson, was twice elected governor,
serving from 1925-27 and 1933-35.
   
   JOHN C. WALTON, Oklahoma, removed in 1923.
   He had declared martial law and ordered the National Guard to
disband a grand jury which was investigating him. The House
returned 22 articles of impeachment ranging from violation of the
separation of powers to diverting public funds.
   
   HENRY S. JOHNSTON, Oklahoma, removed in 1929.
   Johnston had ordered the National Guard to surround the Capitol
to prevent the Legislature from assembling to investigate the
governor. Johnston was impeached but not convicted in 1928, but was
impeached again the next year and removed.
   
   EVAN MECHAM, Arizona, removed in 1988.
   Mecham was convicted of attempting to thwart an investigation
into a death threat allegedly made by an aide in fall 1987. The
vote in the state Senate was 21-9, one more vote than the
two-thirds needed. Though it was not needed to remove him from
office, a second Senate vote then convicted him on an unrelated
count. The first-term Republican took office in January 1987.
