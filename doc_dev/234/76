   Is it a contradiction to love animals and
still shoot them dead?
   A new movie says no, and depicts hunters as naturalists.
   Likely to become one of the year's more divisive films, ``In the
Blood'' is a feature-length documentary arguing that big-game
hunting plays an integral role in conservation.
   Written and directed by George Butler, a hunter from age 6, ``In
the Blood'' takes the position that ``one does not hunt in order to
kill.''
   It shows hunting as a bonding rite and a fundamental privilege.
   The movie, opening Feb. 16 in Houston, was shown Thursday in the
documentary competition of the Sundance United States Film Festival.
   ``I had a tremendously difficult time making this movie,''
Butler said. ``The prejudice against hunting is so powerful in the
film industry.''
   Butler released his ``Pumping Iron'' bodybuilding films
independently because Hollywood frowned upon that topic, too.
   ``I make films about unfashionable subjects,'' Butler said.
   Five years in the making, ``In the Blood'' was backed by 20
investors, including the hunting-wetland preservation group Ducks
Unlimited.
   In a creative fund-raising move, President Theodore Roosevelt's
Holland &amp; Holland rifle was purchased and resold by the production
company to help make ends meet.
   Among the more noteworthy organizations not sponsoring the film:
the National Rifle Association. ``I'm sure that I could have gotten
all the money I needed from the NRA,'' Butler said. ``But I have no
association with them. ... They're a gun lobby, not a hunting
lobby.''
   Indeed, Butler said he has tried not to arouse undue
controversy. He prefers to let the film speak for itself.
   Wherever the movie has been shown, a few people have walked out,
Butler said.
   Although the film does not glorify hunting _ it shows a young
hunter's errant shot causing a buffalo to die a slow death _ it
does state: ``No animal in Africa dies of old age.'' If a bullet
doesn't kill an older lion, something else will.
   The film's premise is that hunting, when well-conceived and
well-executed, improves the cycle of life.
   In remarks after the film's showing, Robin Hurt, a veteran
hunting guide who appears in the movie, said: ``We have interfered
so much in the balance of nature (in the past) that we need to keep
interfering to balance the scales.''
