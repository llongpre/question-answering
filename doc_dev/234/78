   Butler Manufacturing Co. said it will sell its livestock systems division in two separate transactions. 

   Terms weren't disclosed. 
Butler said it signed a letter of intent to sell plants in Texas and Kansas to Heyco Inc., Kansas City, Kan. 
It will sell another plant in Wisconsin to a group headed by John Neill, Fort Atkinson, Wis., currently president of the livestock systems division. 

   The livestock systems division makes feed mixers and other products associated with raising cattle. 

   Butler, a construction services concern, said the livestock systems had 1986 sales of $15 million through Oct. 31, with a "negligible contribution" to earnings.
