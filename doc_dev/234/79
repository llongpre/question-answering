<LEADPARA>  When Page Butler straps a live mouse into a special cockpit for a
radio-controlled airplane, he expects to attract attention.;    His favorite
launching site is at a scenic overlook along Mulholland Drive in the Santa
Monica Mountains, and drivers often stop to see what's going on.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Some think it's the greatest thing, and others think it's horrible and
really cruel," Butler said. "And those people are standing there wearing
leather belts and shoes, which animals died for.";    His aircraft's cockpits
have special ejection systems, which he controls from the ground, and
parachutes in case an emergency makes it necessary for a mouse to bail out.;  
 Butler, 31, an aircraft mechanic from suburban Canoga Park, says he has never
lost a mouse. And even if he did, they still would be better off, he said. He
buys them from pet stores, where they're sold as food for pet snakes.;   
Considering the alternative, the flying is probably OK with the mice, he
said.;    "They love it," Butler said. "They don't bite me and don't run away
when I get them out of the aircraft.";    Even so, an animal rights supporter
is skeptical.;    "This is something we don't endorse and we don't approve,
but it's not technically illegal," said Sgt. Cori Whetstone of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. "It's a little stupid and unnecessary,
and puts the mice in unnecessary risk. But it's not animal cruelty.";   
Butler said he launches the mice-carrying planes several times a week from the
overlook and parks across the city. Guided by radio, the aircraft can stay
aloft for several hours at a time.;    The longer they fly, the closer the
mice get to freedom. After a mouse has logged 50 to 60 hours of flight time,
Butler turns it loose in the hills.  </TEXT>
