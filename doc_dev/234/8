   Thieves burglarized the offices of the
U.S. attorney for eastern Virginia, who has been conducting a
highly publicized investigation into allegations of defense
contracting fraud at the Pentagon.
   About six suites of a commercial office building in Alexandria,
Va., across the Potomac River from Washington, were broken into
sometime between 9:30 p.m. Sunday and 6 a.m. Monday, Dennis Butler,
a spokesman for the Alexandria Police Department, said Tuesday.
   Butler said it appeared that the burglars entered the building
through an unlocked door and punched holes through the gypsum board
walls to gain access to the offices, which included the suites of
U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson and a private law firm.
   The only items missing were two videocassette recorders and a
television set, Butler said. No confidential material was stolen.
   An aide to Hudson said the offices that were broken into
contained no confidential files or information about criminal
matters. Such information is stored in a more secure part of the
office to which the thieves did not gain access.
