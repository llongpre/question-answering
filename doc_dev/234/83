   NASA scientists are planning an
international satellite system to study the atmosphere more
completely, a program moved into high gear because of recent
ominous changes in the ozone layer and other problems.
   The Earth Observing System will be an international network of
space-based polar laboratories focusing on the planet's weather and
ecology, National Aeronautics and Space Administration project
scientist Dixon Butler said Tuesday.
   ``This will bring about a revolution in our understanding of the
Earth as a whole system,'' Butler said via satellite to scientists
at agency centers across the country, including the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena.
   The schedule for the program was recently accelerated because of
worrisome changes in the Earth's atmosphere, such as depletion in
the protective ozone layer, Butler said from NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   The six satellite labs will also monitor the so-called
``greenhouse effect,'' in which the earth's temperature is
gradually rising because of increased carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere, Butler said
   The agency is asking for $20 million in next year's budget to
finalize planning and preparations for launches beginning in 1995,
said Charles Redmond, a spokesman for NASA's science division.
   The project involves two satellites to be launched by Japanese
and European agencies, as well as four by NASA. It features an
estimated $2 billion U.S. price tag, he said.
   ``We need the intellectual resources of all mankind,'' Butler
said. ``We must have international cooperation.''
   NASA has already received about 870 letters from scientific
groups proposing experiments, he said. He also said Soviet
participation is a possibility.
   Instruments to be used on the satellites include a synthetic
aperture radar, which uses radar waves to create images that would
otherwise be hidden by clouds or vegetation.
   Another is a ``geodynamics laser ranging system'' that could
detect the slightest movement along such geological features as
California's San Andreas Fault, Butler said.
