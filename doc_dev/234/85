   Sunstar Inc., a Japanese consumer products concern, said it had completed the acquisition of John O. Butler Co., a toothbrush maker based in Chicago, in a transaction valued at nearly $161 million. 

   Company officials said the acquisition would give Sunstar, which specializes in health and beauty-aid products, instant access to U.S. markets. 
Industry analysts said the merger could also give Butler a significant presence in international markets. 

   The transaction was initiated by Paine Webber/Young &amp; Rubicam Ventures Inc., a joint venture of the brokerage firm Paine Webber Group Inc. and the advertising agency Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. 
The Sunstar-Butler merger marks the largest transaction to date for the joint venture, which was formed in 1986 to structure mergers and acquisitions for consumer products companies.
