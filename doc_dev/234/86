   Lawrence W. Butler, who won five
Academy Awards for technical achievements including work on ``The
Thief of Bagdad,'' died of a heart attack when his pickup truck
crashed, officials said Friday. He was 80.
   Butler, who was head of the special-effects department at
Columbia Pictures in the 1940s, received his most recent honor from
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1975.
   His pictures included ``The Caine Mutiny,'' ``The Devil at 4
O'Clock'' and ``Marooned.''
   Butler's pickup truck ran off the road and smashed into rocks in
northern San Diego County on Wednesday, said Highway Patrol Officer
Sergio Flores.
   Butler, who was alone in the vehicle, had major head trauma and
was pronounced dead at the scene, Flores said.
   The coroner's office listed heart attack as the cause of death.
   The academy had bestowed awards on Butler since 1940, when he
was saluted for photographic merit on ``The Thief of Bagdad.''
   Subsequent technical honors were awarded for ``That Hamilton
Woman,'' 1941, ``Jungle Book,'' 1942, and ``A Thousand And One
Nights,'' 1945.
   All of the awards were certificates or plaques, as distinguished
from the Oscar statuettes presented in other categories.
   ``We were very good friends at work,'' said John Flynn, former
director of industry relations and publicity at Columbia. ``He was
one of the fine special-effects men in the business.''
   ``He was quite a famous director of special effects in the
movies,'' said George Turner, editor of American Cinematographer.
