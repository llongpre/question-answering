HIGHEST PRAISE FROM ONE COACH TO ANOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your Aug. 11 edition carried an article concerning the controversy surrounding 
the dismissal of Ollie Butler (as basketball coach) at Victor Valley High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Having coached on the college level for 15 seasons, I have frequently seen 
Coach Butler's teams in action, recruited his players and worked with him at 
summer camps. On all of these occasions, Coach Butler has conducted himself in 
a professional manner, worthy of the high esteem in which he is held. 
</P>
<P>
Suffice it to say that I wish my son could play for Ollie Butler.
