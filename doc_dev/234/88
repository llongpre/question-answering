<HEAD>Newspaper That Prints Only Arrests Goofs, Costs Man Job</HEAD>

   The Informer was supposed to fight
crime by printing the names of everyone arrested for a crime in the
St. Petersburg area. But readers of the newspaper's very first
issue were misinformed.
   The Informer erroneously reported that a man had been arrested
on a cocaine charge, costing him his job. The newspaper's
publisher, Ray Aden, is contrite but still believes his publication
can serve its purpose.
   ``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``some people might be hurt.''
   ``He was relying on his people to be accurate and one of them
messed up,'' said Shawn Exposito, 23, who was fired from his
$500-a-week job as a carpet installer just a month after the birth
of his third child. ``It couldn't have come at a worse time.''
   Aden said he will print a retraction and do everything he can to
help out Exposito, but that doesn't include an offer to make up for
his lost income.
   Exposito's boss at M&amp;M Floor Co., co-owner Bert Butler, has
tried to help by giving him a lesser job at half the pay until his
previous position reopens. Butler already had hired someone else to
replace his employee of eight years.
   Even before its first issue, The Informer drew skeptical
comments from civil libertarians concerned that it would overlook
the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven.
   The Informer correctly printed that Exposito was arrested last
month for driving with a suspended driver's license. It also
printed that he was arrested on a cocaine charge, which jail
records show is inaccurate.
   Butler saw the drug arrest item Friday and fired Exposito the
next day.
   ``Maybe I acted a little too quickly, but still, in my business
I'm sending this man into another person's house,'' Butler said.
``Would you want a drug addict, someone that's thought of as doing
drugs, in your home? I know I wouldn't.''
   Exposito took work in the carpet warehouse until his old job
opens up.
   ``It's a raw deal for Shawn,'' Butler said. ``These people
shouldn't print anything before they get the facts straight.''
   Aden said he is still trying to determine how the mistake was
made and is trying to find another job for Exposito.
   ``He calls me sometimes two or three times a day,'' Exposito
said. ``I'm sure he's losing sleep over this, probably not as much
as I am.''
