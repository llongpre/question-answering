   Centaur Partners has finally admitted defeat
in its months-long wrangle to take over Pennwalt Corp., leaving the
principal investors richer but also saying they feel disappointed.
   Centaur dropped its $110-per-share bid Thursday, three days after
Pennwalt announced a $132-per-share offer from the French
government-controlled oil and chemical concern Societe Nationale Elf
Aquitaine.
   Based on the number of Pennwalt's outstanding shares _ 8 million
_ Elf Aquitaine's offer amounts to more than $1 billion.
   Centaur's announcement that it would end its takeover bid
coincided with Elf Aquitaine's formal commencement of the offer,
three days after Pennwalt's board of directors voted unanimously to
accept the Elf Aquitaine deal.
   ``We are realistic enough to know when to stop fighting,'' said
Abbey J. Butler, one of the main Centaur investors.
   ``We wanted to buy the company,'' said Melvyn J. Estrin, Butler's
partner. ``But at this point, the way we see it, this price is
higher than we were prepared to go. We are happy with it. It
maximizes the value to all shareholders.''
   It is estimated that Centaur, which owns about 13 percent of
Pennwalt's stock, stands to make $60 million. The group began buying
stock in the chemical company in June, when the price was $65 a
share.
   Pennwalt's chairman, Edwin E. Tuttle, maintained throughout the
takeover bid that Centaur never actually wanted to acquire the
company but merely wanted to drive up the stock prices.
   Pennwalt's managers proved to be ``formidable opponents,'' Butler
said.
   ``I think Mr. Tuttle demonstrated his determination to oppose us,
and he preferred fighting rather than sitting down and talking,'' he
said.
   Butler and Estrin said they plan to make a bid for another
company.
   ``We will look to find other situations that we can buy that are
substantially undervalued,'' he said.
   Pennwalt had fought Centaur since the investment group first made
its plans known last June.
   Pennwalt went to court to stop Centaur from calling a
shareholders meeting, where the investment group hoped to replace
the directors, paving the way for the takeover bid to succeed.
   Pennwalt's stock closed at $130.25 Thursday in consolidated
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock's price jumped
$13.12{ _ about 11 percent _ to $130.12{ when Elf Aquitaine's offer
was made public Monday.
