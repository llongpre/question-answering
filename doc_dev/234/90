UC Irvine's basketball team, trying to solve the mystery of its worst start in 
school history, found part of the answer Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
And it was the Butler who did it. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Butler scored 18 of his career-high 28 points in the first half and 
Justin Anderson added 15 of his 17 in the second half as the Anteaters beat San 
Diego State, 75-62, before a crowd of 2,130 at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters (2-5) broke a three-game losing streak and ended a five-game 
winning string by the Aztecs (5-3). 
</P>
<P>
The victory was a relief for the Anteaters, who have struggled without their 
top two point guards, Ben Rishwain and Rod Palmer. Rishwain is out with a 
broken finger and Palmer has an injured right knee. 
</P>
<P>
So it was Butler, a 6-7 junior, who was the center of attention Saturday night. 
Butler, averaging 13.5 points a game, scored eight points in the final 6:26 as 
the Anteaters led by as many as 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really disappointed because I hadn't played well in the last two games 
(against Cal and Colorado)," Butler said. "I thought it was the worst I had 
played." 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who also had a game-high 12 rebounds, said it was a lack of 
conditioning that hurt him in the games. He said he grew tired and faded in the 
late stages of the losses. 
</P>
<P>
"I was losing (power) in my legs," he said. "I started riding a stationary bike 
again this week and I got some of it back." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg said Butler had the Aztecs chasing him the entire 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Butler played really well," Brandenburg said. "We had no answer for him." 
</P>
<P>
Butler scored 18 points, including 12 on layups and short jump shots, to keep 
the Anteaters close in a first half in which the lead changed hands 15 times. 
</P>
<P>
A free throw by freshman Craig Marshall gave the Anteaters their last lead of 
the half, 29-28, with 2:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
Then San Diego State's Michael Best made two three-pointers, sparking a 9-4 run 
that gave the Aztecs a 37-33 halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
It was Anderson who got hot from the outside in the second half. He made three 
three-pointers and a layup to help the Anteaters pull to a 48-48 tie with 12:05 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Anteaters' Don May, a sophomore reserve, took over. He had a 
three-point play and layup and Craig Marshall added two free throws as the 
Anteaters went on a 7-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a few rules tonight," said UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan. "Only a 
couple of guys (Anderson and Jeff Herdman) could shoot the jumper." 
</P>
<P>
But Butler's play inside was the difference down the stretch. He blocked a 
jumper by Best with 3:09 left and the Anteaters were clinging to a 66-59 lead. 
Best had hit two three-pointers in the previous two minutes to cut the Aztecs' 
deficit from 13 to seven. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach had been telling us that (Best) was their best outside shooter so we 
started jumping out at him," Butler said. "I just jumped out and got a piece of 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Best and Shawn Jamison scored 14 points each for San Diego State, which 
committed 19 turnovers and was outrebounded 42-31. The Aztecs made only 11 of 
20 free throws while UC Irvine made 28 of 36. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost our poise a couple of times," Brandenburg said. "We didn't do much in 
the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Herdman, UC Irvine's leading scorer (16.5 points). He had 10 points 
before fouling out with 5:13 left. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a good job," Mulligan said. "Herdman didn't have a good night and we 
still won. We came out and played hard in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan said the victory might turn the Anteaters' fortunes around. 
</P>
<P>
"If we would have lost I would have made them watch tapes of the game from 
10:30 (p.m.) until 2 (a.m.)," Mulligan said. "I reminded them of that at 
halftime." 
</P>
<P>
Butler got the message and Mulligan and the Anteaters slept well Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ben Rishwain, a freshman point guard who has been sidelined since Dec. 2 with a 
broken finger, is expected to be out until January. . . . The Anteaters are 2-3 
at home. . . . The Anteaters play at Pepperdine Tuesday night at 7:30.
