   PURCHASE, N.Y. -- International Paper Co. expects "no
surprises or disappointments" in its first-quarter earnings,
which analysts have estimated to range between $1.17 and
$1.26 a share, Robert C. Butler, senior vice president and
chief financial officer, said.
   A year ago, the company earned $180 million, or $1.65 a
share, on sales of $3.2 billion.

   Mr. Butler said in an interview that although results
still look weak compared with peak 1989 earnings,
International Paper is holding up better than the paper
industry in general.
   Although International's fourth-quarter earnings were down
19% before a restructuring charge, Mr. Butler said, "many
others were far worse." He said strategic acquisitions and
continuing improvements in operating efficiency have prepared
the company well for a turnaround in the economy.
   Harder to gauge is the full year 1991. Analysts' earnings
estimates range from $4.67 to $5.23 a share. The high range
of the estimates are flat essentially with 1990 earnings of
$5.21 a share, or $569 million, which included a one-time
restructuring charge of $137 million, or $1.26 a share.
   Mr. Butler said projecting International's performance too
many months into the future is difficult because of the
company's dependence on an general economic turnaround. The
timing of the turnaround and the consequent improvement in
paper demand and prices will play a large role in the 1991
results, he said.
   Mr. Butler now sees improvement sometime in the second
quarter for the industry, which started showing its slump in
early 1990. The boom years, 1988 and 1989, produced earnings
for International of $6.57 and $7.72 a share, respectively.
   Late last year, the company took the $137 million
restructuring charge for disposal of some operations over the
next three years. The asset sales are expected to yield $200
million in proceeds and annual pretax earnings gains of $25
million to $40 million.
   Mr. Butler said that because the company diversified into
other paper-related lines, its exposure isn't too great in
any one area, so its "highs and lows in the cycle are more
moderate" than the industry's.
   The cycle can vary for different products, though. Mr.
Butler said linerboard used for industrial and consumer
packaging is tending toward the down side while consumer
packaging has held up well.
   Timber and wood products have slumped with the rate of new
housing starts. Mr. Butler said the company needs about a 20%
increase in housing starts to revive its timber and wood
business.
   The company's 1990 sales of $13 billion consisted of:
paper and pulp, about 34%; paperboard and packaging, 25%;
distribution, 18%; specialty products, 13% and wood products
and timber, 9%.
   In the past few years, the company has increased its
business in higher-value finished products such as
photographic films and papers, graphic arts materials and
laminates. That move has reduced the company's concentration
in pulp and basic paper grades that are more subject to
commodity-type price swings. Although it remains committed to
being a basic paper and pulp maker, it now consumes about as
much pulp as it produces. Mr. Butler said that balance
protects International Paper from price swings.
