BUTLER'S KICK MAKES UP FOR BEAR OF A MISS;

<P>
To err is human. To forgive is possible for Chicago Bear Coach Mike Ditka, only 
if you redeem yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka, who had a tantrum on the sideline when Kevin Butler's field-goal attempt 
at the end of regulation bounced off the left upright, embraced his kicker 
after Sunday's 16-13 overtime victory over the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Butler drilled a 44-yard field goal with 1:46 left in overtime to lift the 
Bears (9-1) to their sixth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The first one (from 41 yards) missed by inches," Ditka said. "He's entitled." 
</P>
<P>
The clincher was a low line-drive that managed to sail over the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible feeling to miss a kick like that, but fortunately it hasn't 
happened much to me in my career," Butler said. "It felt like I hit it good, 
but it just started to hook at the end. Actually, the one in overtime felt 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
Butler's winning kick was made possible by poor field position endured by 
Denver (3-7) on three possessions in overtime. Denver started drives at its 12, 
eight and four-yard lines. 
</P>
<P>
When the Broncos couldn't move out of the hole on their last series, Johnny 
Bailey returned the punt 20 yards to the Denver 34, and Butler converted four 
plays later. 
</P>
<P>
"Maury Buford did an outstanding job of punting," Ditka said. "We kept them 
pinned in there, and he gave us field position. As it turned out, the only 
difference in the game was field position." 
</P>
<P>
Denver Coach Dan Reeves agreed with Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like we were in a hole going into overtime," he said. "We were 
backed up constantly, and we couldn't make a play to get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Another big difference in the game was the two turnovers. Chicago never turned 
the ball over, they never made a mistake. That's the kind of team they are. 
They're forcing you to beat them, and they're not helping you. This is the 
thing that has plagued us, the mistakes, but I was proud of the way we played." 
</P>
<P>
Denver got even, 13-13, with 1:14 left in regulation on John Elway's nine-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of field goals by David Treadwell gave Denver a 6-3 lead at the half. 
But the Bears converted two turnovers into 10 third-quarter points to take a 
13-6 advantage. It marked the ninth time in 10 games the Broncos have blown 
halftime leads this season. 
</P>
<P>
After Bobby Humphrey fumbled at the end of a 14-yard run on a vicious, head-on 
hit by Chicago safety Mark Carrier, Mike Singletary recovered at the Denver 
35-yard line. Butler's 32-yard field goal made it 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Jim Morrissey made a diving interception of Elway's pass at 
the Denver 40. Seven plays later, Brad Muster ran 10 yards for a touchdown with 
14 seconds left in the quarter.
