   Alicia Crews is a black Republican, but not for
long. President Bush's veto of a civil rights bill was the last
straw for her.
   ``It was a very needed bill,'' said Ms. Crews, who has been a
GOP voter for nine years. She plans to change her affiliation to
the Democrats.
   What was the message of the veto to her? ``That there isn't a
visible slavery but there's still a mental slavery,'' Ms. Crews,
31, said as she headed home from work here Tuesday, briefcase in
hand.
   A sampling of black voters around the nation found some
defending Bush's decision to kill the legislation that he said
would impose racial hiring quotas. More often, however, they echoed
Ms. Crews' disappointment or said blacks would take their anger at
Bush to the polls.
   ``He's lost all the black vote,'' said Mike Ward, who works at a
cabinet-making business on Atlanta's Martin Luther King Drive.
   Ward had been undecided in Georgia's upcoming gubernatorial
election but now he's inclined to vote Democratic.
   Heavy black turnout helped Democrats win midterm congressional
election victories when Ronald Reagan was president, and Bush's
veto may send more blacks to the polls Nov. 6, black observers
predicted.
   ``It's one of the many things that shows us that we must vote as
a group to show our support,'' Bernard George said at a Democratic
rally Tuesday night in New Bern, N.C.
   Cindy Turrentine, also at the rally, said she had mixed feelings
about the veto. ``There's a misconception that the civil rights
movement is there to set quotas,'' she said.
   Nonetheless, the veto will help galvanize the black community,
she said.
   ``I think our race in North Carolina will push them out even
more,'' Ms. Turrentine said. Her reference was to the U.S. Senate
contest between incumbent Republican Jesse Helms and Democrat
Harvey Gantt, who is black.
   Greater black turnout is likely elsewhere, too, because of the
veto, said Wayne Bryant, the majority leader of New Jersey's state
Assembly.
   ``Folks really do feel threatened,'' said Bryant, a black
Democrat. ``We fought these battles in the 1950s, and here we are
fighting them again just before the 21st century.''
   Paul Hubbard, president of New Detroit Inc., a coalition of
business and community leaders in the motor city, said he was
surprised Bush ``would have the nerve to veto something like that
in 1990, and I think voters will show their feelings at the
polls.''
   ``I think for the people on the fence, it would change their
mind. They would vote Democratic,'' added Hubbard, who is black.
   Sen. Eddie Bernice Johnson, one of the few blacks in the Texas
Legislature, agreed.
   ``I'm hoping that every minority affected by this bill, will
find it very important to go to the polls and vote their
conscience,'' said Ms. Johnson, a Democrat. ``I sure hope this will
send a message of political distaste to the entire (Republican)
party.''
   Bill Chappell, chairman of the Georgia Black Republican Council,
said he doubts the president's veto will have a major impact on
elections two weeks hence, though it could hurt the GOP among
blacks in the long term.
   ``I'm very disappointed that he vetoed the bill, understanding
all the implications and complications of it,'' Chappell said.
   Keith Butler, a black Detroit City Councilman who has met with
Bush to discuss civil rights legislation, doubted most blacks would
turn against the president.
   ``I think African Americans are going to remember that George
Bush has made more appointments of African Americans than any other
president,'' Butler said. ``The issue is not whether or not the
president wants a civil rights bill, because he's put forth one of
his own. It deals with methodology. ...
   ``I think Democrats want to find a way to embarrass him just
before the election,'' Butler said. ``I think the Democrats are not
acting in the interest of black people, they're acting in the
interest of getting votes for themselves.''
   Waiting at an Atlanta subway station the day after the Monday
veto, 22-year-old Air Force reservist Bryan Robinson said Bush's
action would not stop him from voting for Republicans in next
month's elections. ``I think there should be ways of keeping
discrimination out of the workplace, but I don't think ... quotas
are the answer.''
   Along the subway platform, other black riders were split.
   Many, like 50-year-old Franklin Harris, saw in Bush's veto an
erosion of the national commitment to civil rights. ``It's not just
for black. It's for white and all low-income people. That put a
hurt on all of us,'' he said.
   Henry Thornton, 20, said he'd continue voting for GOP
candidates. ``I'm not really into black vote, white vote. I look at
the platform,'' he said.
   Nell Harris, who has sometimes voted for Republicans in the
past, said now ``I'd think twice about it.''
