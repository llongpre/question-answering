   U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., announced his bid for a
second term today, while veteran Democratic Rep. Butler Derrick of
South Carolina said he'll seek an eighth term in November.
   In prepared remarks to announce his candidacy, Lautenberg did
not mention Republican senatorial candidate Pete Dawkins, a West
Point hero who recently moved to New Jersey and announced Feb. 29
he would seek Lautenberg's seat.
   Lautenberg told reporters at Liberty State Park in Jersey City,
N.J., that he expects to debate Dawkins during the campaign.
   But he said he would not attack the GOP candidate, and that it
would be up to voters to decide if Dawkins should answer for moving
into the state to run to office.
   Lautenberg also said he must work on getting New Jersey voters
to better recognize his name.
   ``I think it's fair to say people know my work better than they
know me. I guess I haven't been as good a communicator as I've been
a worker,'' he said.
   Lautenberg, 63, has run for office just once. The Montclair
multimillionaire, who made his fortune with the Automatic Data
Processing Corp., upset well-known Rep. Millicent Fenwick to gain
the six-year Senate term. Fenwick has since retired from Congress.
   Lautenberg is opposed in the June 7 primary by political
unknowns Elnardo J. Webster of Jersey City and Harold J. Young of
Rahway.
   In Columbia, S.C., Derrick said he will run again for his 3rd
District seat.
   ``It has been an honor to carry the 3rd District's values to
Washington for 14 years and it would be a privilege to do so for
two more,'' he said at the state Democratic Party headquarters.
   Derrick, who is second-ranking member of the House Rules
Committee and a ranking member of the Budget Committee, is being
challenged by Anderson surgeon Henry Jordon, who lost to Democrat
Ernest Hollings in the 1986 U.S. Senate race.
   Derrick, 51, said he has a substantial lead in the race at this
point but said Jordon represents one of his three toughest
challenges. The others were the 1974 and 1980 races against
Marshall Parker. Derrick said he expects to spend more money on
this campaign than any other.
   Jordon, a leader in the Carolina Conservative Coalition, is
expected to portray Derrick as more liberal than the people he
represents.
