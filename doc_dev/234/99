   Two women who baked cookies for troops
stationed in the Persian Gulf are fuming because the sweets ended
up in California homeless shelters.
   Gina Root and Deborah Lien of Corvallis spent about $75 to send
150 pounds of cookies about three weeks ago to Stephen Butler in La
Mesa, Calif. The women thought the cookies would soon be on a
flight to the Gulf.
   This week, Root received a letter from a volunteer in a homeless
shelter in La Mesa thanking her for the donation.
   ``I'm furious,'' Root said Thursday. ``These cookies are for our
service people, not for the homeless in California. It just
stinks.''
   Butler said he distributed the cookies and many others he
received to homeless shelters because he was deluged with treats
for the troops and never intended to become the national organizer
of Operation Cookie.
   He said he volunteered to organize the local Los Angeles cookie
effort, but after talking to a reporter and the story being picked
up by newspapers across the country he was covered up in cookies.
   For weeks, his living room has been full of cookies.
   Root said if Butler had more cookies than he could handle, he
should have refused to accept shipment.
   Butler said he ``scrounged'' to find a way to get the cookies
overseas. He said military planes take the cookies only on a
space-available basis, and most flights have been full.
   ``It was either give them to homeless shelters or throw them in
the trash,'' Butler said.
   He said he thought the honorable thing to do was to give the
cookies to shelters.
   ``I've been deluged by angry old ladies giving me tons of
suggestions of what I should have done with the cookies,'' he said.
``From now on, I'll just let them spoil or throw them away. I'm fed
up with it.''
