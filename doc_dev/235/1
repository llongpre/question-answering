FT  17 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why grown men dream
of a future with Barbie

The history of the US Mattel Toys company is the tale of everyday business
folk and a highly successful piece of plastic called Barbie. Last year the
company sold 54m fashion dolls.
This year it is likely to be 65m. 'When you do the arithmetic, that means
somewhere around the world we sell two Barbie dolls every second of every
day of every year,' says John Amerman, Mattel's silver-haired chairman and
chief executive. 'We think we are pretty good at meeting the desires and
dreams of little girls.'
Although Barbie's appeals have waned little throughout its 33-year history,
Mattel's shareholders have not always seen the rewards of it. Five years
ago, the company slumped to a net loss of Dollars 113m (Pounds 57.3m) as it
struggled with high overheads and an unresponsive management structure. But
since then, the company has staged a strong turnaround and last year
recorded operating income of Dollars 113m with analysts expecting further
improvement this year.
The main architect of the revival has been Amerman who has pragmatically
followed some classic marketing prescriptions to return the company to
profitability.
'I like to view Mattel as a consumer packaged goods company that just
happens to sell toys,' he says.
One of the most striking characteristics of the process has been the
constant product innovation which has been essential to increase sales. 'In
the US, about 95 per cent of girls between the ages of three to eight have a
Barbie doll and these girls have an average of seven dolls each. It is
important with a product like Barbie to have clear market segmentation,'
says Amerman.
Mattel boasts a standard My First Barbie doll which retails in the US for
less than Dollars 5.
But in her time, Barbie has also been a beach babe, a Mod, an airline pilot
and a Unicef ambassador. Mattel expects that one of her latest incarnations
as the Ultra Hair Barbie - complete with curlers and styling gels - will
sell 10m items in more than 100 countries.
At any one time there are about 50 models on sale, including limited-line
collectors' items. Mattel has recently discovered it can push the price of
special dolls far higher than previously imagined, breaking through the
Dollars 10 barrier.
Ideas for new dolls stem from several sources. The company conducts 'focus'
group work with girls in different countries to see how they respond to
concepts and has built up an extensive library of girls' magazines to keep
track of changing trends. The company employs 500 designers, development
engineers and model makers who constantly review and revise the Barbie line.
But Mattel has also learnt that it continually has to stimulate the consumer
market by means of heavy advertising and in-store promotions. Analysts
estimate the company spends up to 17 per cent of turnover promoting its
brands.
Mattel has also been able to generate greater consumer interest by winning
additional display space from retailers. To this end, Mattel began a
customer service programme three years ago visiting the biggest toy retail
chains and devising ways of improving operational relationships. Lower
prices have also led to increased sales volumes.
But there are signs that Barbie in the US is reaching the limits of growth
and Mattel is now rapidly expanding into other toy markets and pushing
Barbie harder overseas, where it already accounts for half of all sales.
'The future of our company is in international markets. The wants and
desires of little girls are the same around the world, whether it is combing
a doll's hair, changing their clothes, playing with Ken or thinking about
being an astronaut,' says Amerman.
