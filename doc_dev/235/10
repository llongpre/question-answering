<LEADPARA>  CASE 91-6111 in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals may present itself as a dry
quarrel over jurisdiction between the U.S. Customs Service and the federal
courts. But beneath the arid prose of the warring briefs pulses a desperate
cat-fight between two icons of American womanhood: Barbie and Miss America.;  
 Barbie says Miss America ripped off her head.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Not the real Miss America, but a new doll based on Miss America, introduced
in February as a joint venture between the Miss America Pageant and Kenner
Products.;    "Miss America" is Kenner's attempt to crack Barbie's 32-year
stranglehold on the toy category known as "fashion dolls." But in March
Barbie's parent, Mattel Inc., complained to Customs that two of the five "Miss
America" models look too much like Barbie.;    Back in 1977, Mattel
copyrighted Barbie's head, making her eternal look of compliant joy a
protected expression -- literally. In April, Customs made a preliminary
finding that Mattel might have a point, and seized a shipment of the "Miss
America" dolls from China, pending a full review. Kenner is now has taken its
case to the 2nd Circuit.;    Miss America's attorney, Carol F. Simkin, says in
papers filed in court that Mattel is trying to assert copyright ownership of
the ineffable.;    "There can be no infringement because the only
similarities, if any, between the doll heads lie not in protectable
expression," said Simkin, "but in those generic features necessary to depict a
fashion doll head and in the common elements inherent in the human face.";   
Arthur J. Levine, Barbie's lawyer, says, "We have absolutely no problem with
anyone creating an 11 1/2-inch doll that Barbie's clothes fit on. But when you
come too close to an American icon, we don't like it.";    Only the face and
head are at issue in the case, which was publicized earlier this month by
Legal Times. While the bodies of the dolls seem astonishingly similar -- the
same impossibly elongated thighs, the same bullet-like breasts, the same
hinged shoulders and convenient pelvic vagueness -- Mattel alleges that two of
the Miss Americas, made from the same mold and named "Devon" and "Tonya,"
stole the design for the head. They also reserved the right to take action
against "Blair," telling customs that only "Racquel" and "Justine" pass
muster.;    To read the briefs is to be swept into a confusing debate over how
American womanhood is idealized in toys.;    Barbie ends up arguing that she
is an act of creative expression as legally "protectable" as a cartoon or a
poem; that she looks nothing like a human being.;    Miss America says that,
if you're going to manufacture stereotypes of feminine beauty, then of course
they're all going to look alike.;    "The faces of fashion dolls must have the
pretty features expected of most fashion models," says Miss America's brief.
"They also must have the stock features commonly used in the toy industry to
make a fashion doll head look attractive, including pert noses, eyes that are
made-up and exaggerated in terms of both size and distance from each other . .
. smiling, full lips, painted-on eyebrows and similarly sized heads.";   
Barbie argues that Kenner's designers might have unconsciously imitated
Barbie: If you're trying to generate an ideal of feminine beauty, this
argument goes, your thoughts are just naturally going to turn to Barbie.;   
Lawyers on both sides of the case -- expected to be decided in the next few
months -- express the belief that there is a somber legal matter at issue
here. Kenner is arguing that a federal court should be able to quickly decide
whether Miss America infringes Barbie's copyright. Barbie -- joined by a
heavyweight coalition of American business interests who have a stake in
preventing imports of cheap foreign knock-offs of their products -- argue that
Kenner's motion would undercut Customs' power to seize infringing imports.;   
Miss America, on the other hand, charges "that Mattel was more concerned with
damaging a competitor's business than protecting its own alleged copyright."; 
  But it's over the specific looks of the dolls that the real biting and
scratching takes place.;    "Devon's eyes are larger and differently shaped
than Barbie's and are positioned near the vertical middle of the head," says
the Kenner brief, "whereas Barbie's eyes are smaller, flatter and lower on the
head; the bridge of Devon's nose is much fuller and her nostrils are less
defined than Barbie's; Devon's lips are thicker and form an open smile, while
Barbie's smile is closed and shows less teeth.";    Unasked in all this legal
activity is the question of which busty, plasticene young lady is the better
role model for America's little girls.;    On the one hand, Barbie has an
impressive resume these days: She is in the Army and the Navy; she has tried
stints as an astronaut, a scuba diver, a doctor, an executive, a rock star and
a veterinarian.;    On the other hand: Can Barbie play the ocarina?  </TEXT>
