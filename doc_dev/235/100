   Mattel Inc. said it has limited fourth-quarter shipments to retailers and will report a loss for the year because of disappointing toy sales. 

   The toy maker also said that it has begun "additional steps" to restructure its operations. 
The steps could mean further layoffs, a spokesman said. 
In June, Hawthorne, Calif.-based Mattel said it would eliminate 300 jobs this year, or 14% of its work force, as part of a plan to trim overhead and boost profits. 

   Analysts weren't surprised by the prediction of a loss for the year. 
"Seven of the nine public toy companies I follow will show red ink this year," said Thomas Kully, an analyst with Chicago-based William Blair &amp; Co. "Mattel is marching in line with the rest of them." 
Though Mattel's statement didn't indicate the fourth-quarter outlook, Mr. Kully expects the company to post an operating loss for the quarter, which ends Dec. 27. 
Mattel wouldn't comment on Mr. Kully's projection. 

   Mattel's difficulties are indicative of problems of the toy industry as a whole. 
"The industry has been in the doldrums all year," said Mr. Kully. 
"Dolls, male-action toys and soft toys are all showing sales declines." 
The only countertrends in the industry have been in games and preschool toys, he said. 

   Several toy companies see a weak fourth quarter but most said that so far they haven't changed their shipping policies. 
Hasbro Inc., the nation's largest toy maker, said it expects a weak fourth quarter but the Pawtucket, R.I.-based company, added that it hasn't changed its shipping policy from past years. 
Tonka Corp., Minnetonka, Minn., which expects a 1987 loss of about $8 million, reported some declines in popular product lines but said it hasn't cut back on shipments to retailers. 

   Worlds of Wonder Inc., Fremont, Calif., said it expects to post a loss for its fiscal year ending in March. 
The cash-strapped toy maker, which had the No. 1-selling toys during the past two Christmas seasons, has been beset by rising costs and delivery problems. 

   For the nine months ended Sept. 26, Mattel reported operating profit of $7.2 million, or 14 cents a share. 
After an extraordinary charge of $19.6 million, Mattel posted a loss of $12.4 million. 
In 1986, the company reported a loss of $951,000 on sales of $1.05 billion. 

   Mattel said it has limited shipments in the fourth quarter "to ensure a satisfactory retail sell-through." 
Mr. Kully said that "the marketplace won't take a lot of product" and that Mattel is correct to limit shipments to keep retailers "lean" in early 1988. 
In the past, Mattel has erred by shipping too many products in the quarter, clogging retailers' inventories, he said. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Mattel closed yesterday at $7.875 a share, up 25 cents. 

   A Mattel spokesman said the company was concerned about the lackluster U.S. sales of most products except the "Barbie" doll line. 
The company's new "Captain Power" interactive video toy started strongly but is slowing down a bit lately, the spokesman said. 
Mattel's new high-tech "Baby Heather" doll, which sells for about $100 retail, is "selling all right but has a limited market," the spokesman said. 

   Gregory H. Kieselmann, an analyst with Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy &amp; Gardner, a Los Angeles brokerage firm, said he is concerned about Mattel's international sales, which had been increasing by 20% to 30% a year but are now sagging. 

   Mattel's "Masters of the Universe" male action toys are "running out of steam internationally too soon," Mr. Kieselmann said. 
The "Masters of the Universe" toy has just about ended its four-to-five year cycle in the U.S., but had been expected to show successful international sales for a longer period, Mr. Kieselmann said. 
International sales have accounted for one-half of Mattel's annual revenue. 

   In the third quarter, international sales were down 18% excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, Mattel said. 
For the nine months, international sales were down 5%. 

   Mr. Kully said Mattel's international sales problem makes it hard to project the company's outlook for 1988.
