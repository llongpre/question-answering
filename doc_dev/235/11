   Things are tough all over. 
The stock market is crashing. 
The Democrats are running out of candidates. 
And Jem is losing her one-year-old fight with Barbie. 

   Let us explain. 

   Jem is actually a doll, introduced by Hasbro Inc. last year to challenge Mattel Inc.'s Barbie. 
And for a while, the 27-year-old champion was showing her age. 

   If Barbie was the All-American teenager, Jem -- according to the "story line" that Hasbro gave her -- was a woman of the '80s. 
By day she was an executive, running a music store. 
At night, however, she became the gyrating leader of a rock band. 
Moreover, she had what every young toy dreams of: her own TV cartoon show. 

   But Barbie, who has been through a few changes herself, wasn't about to give way to the competition. 
The veteran quickly acquired an after-hours wardrobe of miniskirts and spandex tights, a spiked hair-do, a rock band of her own and a new boyfriend: her drummer Derek. (Faithful Ken was temporarily dumped.) 

   Mattel's counterattack worked. 
"Suddenly the customers had the option of choosing between a rock star and a rock star and they got a little confused," says Stephen Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing for Hasbro. 
As a result, the lesser-known Jem suffered. 
Hasbro admits it made a few mistakes with the doll. 
For one, Jem was on the homely side, a problem that plastic surgery has since corrected. 

   This year Barbie's sales will top $200 million, vs. only a few million dollars for Jem, estimates Rick Anguilla, editor of Toy and Hobby World, a trade magazine. 
Barbie ranks as the nation's second best-selling toy (behind Hasbro's G.I. Joe), while Jem -- who never got higher than No. 16 -- has fallen off the Top 20 list. 

   Her future "depends on how well she does this Christmas season," says Mr. Schwartz. 
"The truth is we underestimated Barbie a little bit." 

   But it may be too late. 
Harry E. Wells III, an analyst for Adams Harkness &amp; Hill Inc. in Boston, often judges the success of a toy by its reception among the friends of his daughters, all of whom are of doll-buying age. 
Mr. Wells says he never hears the girls mention Jem's name, a sure sign that "Jem's in deep trouble." 

   Meanwhile, Mattel's new "story line" has Barbie back with Ken. 
Retailers report that Ken now has a thicker neck and a bigger Adam's apple. 
Probably from working out.
