<LEADPARA>  At age 32, Barbie is doing better than ever, and so is the doll's
manufacturer, Mattel Inc.;   More than three decades after she was introduced,
Barbie is expected to post sales for Mattel this year of more than $800
million, up 10 percent from last year and almost double the level of four
years ago. She is far and away Mattel's most important product, accounting for
half the company's revenues.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Mattel's success in increasing Barbie's appeal after all these years says a
lot about why its stock price has nearly doubled in the last year and
quadrupled since 1988. It closed Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at
$28.75, down 13 cents but near its 52-week high of $29.50.;   After years of
weakening finances and misguided marketing strategies, analysts said, Mattel
has pulled itself together by giving new life to Barbie and its other
established toys and by cautiously investing in new toy lines that have the
potential to be steady sellers.;   Mattel's recent flair for reading the
tastes of children and their parents is not limited to Barbie. It has built
its large-doll business to more than $200 million in sales this year from $50
million four years ago with new products like Li'l Miss Singing Mermaid, one
of the hits of the current Christmas season. Sales of its Hot Wheels toy cars
have doubled, to more than $100 million, in the same period.;   Mattel has
also cautiously stepped up its licensing deals. It just signed an agreement to
sell dolls based on the Flintstones and other animated characters from
Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc.;   Last month, Mattel solidified and expanded
its relationship with Walt Disney Co. The companies extended their existing
deal, under which Mattel sells a line of Disney preschool and infant toys, for
10 years.;   The arrangement also allows Mattel to develop and sell toys based
on Disney characters not covered by the previous agreement, including
Pinocchio, Bambi and Dumbo.;   Analysts give the credit for Mattel's
turnaround to a management team led by John W. Amerman, who took over as
Mattel's chief executive in 1987 and set out to shore up the company's
finances while refocusing its marketing and product-development efforts on
Barbie and a few other core products.;   "The numbers the management team . .
. put on the board are most impressive," said David Leibowitz, an analyst at
the American Securities Corp. in New York.;   While Mattel has shored up its
product line and its marketing, it has also greatly strengthened its balance
sheet. Four years ago, said James A. Eskridge, Mattel's chief financial
officer, the company was saddled with $400 million in debt, much of it
demanding interest payments as high as 15 percent.;   "In those four years,
we've taken sales from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, thrown off cash in excess
of $100 million in each of those years, repaid all of the high-cost debt and
quadrupled our equity," Eskridge said.  </TEXT>
