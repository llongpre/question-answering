It has been quite a year for Barbie, the most popular doll in history. Born
on March 9 1959, her 35th birthday has been celebrated all over the world;
Columbia Studios is bidding for the rights to make her a film star; and
Sheik Khaled Al Madkour, president of a committee in Kuwait City which
advises the government on religious issues, has declared that to buy her is
forbidden by Islam.
There is no such veto in Monte Carlo where the National Museum is hosting an
exhibition in her honour. It is drawn from the collection of one person:
Jean-Pierre Icardo, an office worker from Nice who has 'between 700 and 800'
Barbie dolls. Now 40, he first saw Barbie in 1964, the year she was
introduced to France. He has been her faithful admirer ever since.
As a child, Icardo was enchanted by all forms of decoration and wanted to
work in the theatre or cinema. As he grew up, he made his own theatrical
tableaux at home and put on entertainments for his friends, using dolls as
actors. But traditional dolls were stiff and it was not possible to dress or
pose them satisfactorily. Barbie, with her long legs, slim body and
beautiful outfits, was the perfect solution. 'I fell in love,' he says,
simply.
After attending Nice University, he took an office job and continued to
weave his theatrical dreams at home, always with Barbie as his star. His
collection grew slowly: the dolls were expensive and his mother saved up to
buy them for him as birthday and Christmas gifts. 'I believed I was unique,'
he says. 'I had no idea there were other grown-ups who were collecting.'
In March 1984, though, a convention of doll and automata collectors was held
in Monaco. Icardo and his mother went along and were astonished to find all
the paraphernalia of an established Barbie collectors' market, including
books with descriptions of the dolls and how to recognise their ages and
dates. In fact, adult collecting of Barbie began in the US in the 1970s and
the first Barbie encyclopaedia was written in 1975. Now, there are Barbie
conventions every year.
Collectors often specialise, some buying only Barbie and shunning her family
and friends, some buying only Barbies from the 1960s, now the most expensive
period. Icardo tries to collect everything from 1964 onwards, conceding that
his collection grows 'only very slowly - the world of Barbie is so huge'.
Mattel, the company that created Barbie, makes limited editions especially
for the collectors' market. Unique examples of older or special dolls, such
as the very early versions made in ivory white plastic, now change hands for
up to Dollars 4,000.
Icardo's devotion extends to Barbie's friends and relations. This year, he
told me, is also the 30th anniversary of her sister Skipper. Her best
friend, Midge, will have her 30th anniversary next year. Ken, Barbie's
faithful consort, was born in 1961. 'But she will never marry Ken,' Icardo
insists. 'She must stay the young teenager for ever.'
When first launched, Barbie was not popular with parents who, rather like
Sheikh Khaled, thought her 'too sexy'. Her popularity with young girls was
instant, however, and there are thought to be 700m of her worldwide. Today,
Barbie and Ken lead a hectic life as their clothes, make-up and hair styles
change constantly with the times: last year alone, Barbie had 100 outfits
from which to choose.
While Barbie's unique proportions have never changed, Ken has been altered
several times. His earliest skinny body has been made bigger and his fragile
flock velvet hair (now much prized if found in pristine condition) replaced
with more practical paint or, for special occasions, wigs.
Their world, too, has expanded from homely junior proms and fraternity
meetings to a frantic round of globe-trotting and activities that include
every kind of sport, making television programmes and even ballet dancing.
Barbie's circle of friends reflects a changing America. Her first black
friend, a girl doll dating from the mid-1960s, was followed by the grown-up
Brad in 1970 and Cara and Curtis in 1975. The first Hispanic and Asiatic
friends appeared in the 1980s and an American Indian was added to the circle
recently.
The all-American girl has only recently been made at home, though.
Originally manufactured in Japan from 1959, Barbie's production cycle has
followed the global trail of multi-national investment and new sources of
cheap labour. She is now made at 15 locations in seven countries: Mexico,
China, Malaysia, Indonesia, UK and Italy, as well as the US.
Some Barbies were produced briefly under licence in various countries, so
allowing regional differences to creep in; this resulted in her being more
sun-tanned in Spain and smaller, with huge cartoon-style eyes, in Japan. But
this has been stopped and uniformity reigns. Icardo considers this 'very
sad'.
Barbie, of course, is not just a pretty face. When I expressed a certain
envy of her lifestyle, and pointed out that she never had to work for a
living, Icardo was quick to disagree. 'She always works,' he said. 'She has
been a model and a singer. This year, she was a doctor. She and Ken have
been in the army, taking part in Desert Storm; and in the 1960s, the great
days of Nasa, she was an astronaut.'
This year's Christmas model will talk and answer questions; one released
earlier swims and dives. Truly, she is a superwoman 'at the centre of her
world', as Icardo puts it. Perhaps, though, it takes another woman to spot a
few snags.
To me, it seems obvious that, as she approaches 40, Barbie faces the same
problems as the women who have tried to emulate her - success, fame, and
glamour do not necessarily bring fulfilment. And few of them have made her
supreme sacrifice. For Barbie - astronaut, soldier, fashion icon - has never
had sex. Forever dreaming of romantic weddings - dresses for which feature
among her sister's outfits, if not her own - her relationship remains
unconsummated.
Despite the sexual message of her appearance - huge breasts, heavy make-up,
ever more sophisticated clothes - Barbie must remain untouched. She is an
Eve who cannot fall, in a paradise filled not with flowers and fruit but
with products. The message she brings is to look, to dream - and then, to
buy.
La Poupee Barbie, Anniversaire a Monaco, continues at the Musee National de
Monaco, 17, Avenue Princesse Grace, Monte Carlo, until September 30. Barbie
can also be seen with 33 outfits specially made for her by top French
couturiers at the Musee Grevin, Paris, until December 31.
