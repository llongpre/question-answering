SINDY, once Britain's favourite doll, is to undergo plastic surgery to
settle a long-running international legal dispute with Barbie, her older and
more successful American rival.
Hasbro, manufacturer of Sindy, agreed yesterday to re-model her head to
distinguish her from Barbie, made by Mattel. The settlement was reached
shortly before a copyright battle between the two US companies was due to go
to the UK High Court next month.
The dispute began after Hasbro acquired the licence to Sindy from Pedigree,
the UK toy company, in 1986 and set about altering her appearance.
The previously demure tweed-clad Sindy suddenly acquired a more glamorous
face, while her body acquired shapely curves.
Mattel responded with a barrage of lawsuits, charging that Sindy had become
an imitation of Barbie.
Earlier this year, stocks of Sindy were seized after a French court ruled
that the doll violated Barbie's copyright. Mattel has also won cases against
Hasbro in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Barbie, who is sold in a variety of models and costumes, is believed to be
the most successful toy range of all time. Since she was launched 33 years
ago, more than 700m Barbie dolls have been sold in almost 70 countries, and
Mattel expects sales this year to be worth a record Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m).
According to Mattel, a Barbie doll is sold every two seconds, and 98 per
cent of American girls between the ages of 3 and 11 own one at some point.
Sindy, born in 1961, has always sold mostly in Britain, where she had the
market to herself until the late 1970s. Today, her sales in Britain are
estimated to be three times greater than the roughly Pounds 8m achieved by
her rival.
Mattel said yesterday that it had agreed to drop all outstanding lawsuits
relating to Sindy and Barbie around the world and that the two companies
would pay their own legal costs.
Just how much difference Sindy's planned facelift will have on sales is
uncertain. According to Mr Barry Walker, deputy chairman of the British
Association of Toy Retailers: 'It's only crusty old blokes in toy showrooms
who care about these things. The kids don't notice.'
