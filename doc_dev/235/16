   LOS ANGELES -- Petra is no friend of Barbie's, says Barbie
doll maker Mattel Inc.
   Mattel charged Lundby of Sweden AB and its U.S. unit with
false advertising and unfair competition in connection with
Lundby's alleged promotion of its Petra doll in the U.S. as
"Barbie's friend."

   Lundby "has shown the Petra advertisements to actual and
potential toy store purchasers for purposes of advertising
and inducing such purchasers to buy . . . {Lundby's} Petra
doll," Mattel stated in its suit filed Friday in U.S.
District Court here.
   Perry Melton, acting operations manager for Lundby of
Sweden USA Inc., the Tucson, Ariz., U.S. unit, said "it would
be premature to comment {on the Mattel suit} until I've seen
it."
   Los Angeles-based Mattel said the alleged promotion would
confuse potential consumers because Mattel itself has
marketed its Ken, Kira, Christie and other fashion dolls as
friends of the hugely popular Barbie. Mattel estimated its
U.S. sales of Barbie and related dolls and accessories at
more than $2.8 billion from 1972 through 1990.
