   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Mattel Inc. wants Barbie, the
ultimate material girl, to strike it rich in Japan.
   After earlier, limited flings that were specifically
tailored for the Japanese market, the company has decided to
sell its toys there much as it sells them in the rest of the
world -- and to sell the same ones rather than specially
designed versions.

   Mattel will unveil today a multimillion-dollar marketing
campaign to capture a chunk of one of the most promising but
formidable of all toy markets. Japan's toy manufacturer
shipments totaled about $3.6 billion last year, second only
to the U.S.'s $11.9 billion.
   Mattel, along with other U.S. toy makers, has had little
impact in Japan so far because of trade restrictions and
other barriers. Now, with change sweeping the Japanese retail
scene, it hopes to cash in on the affluence of Japanese
consumers.
   Japan has 16 million children in the company's target
group of boys and girls up to 10 years old, says Lindsey
Williams, Mattel International's president. By the end of the
decade, he says, Japan should be one of Mattel's top three
markets overseas.
   In today's announcement, Mattel will disclose the
formation of Mattel KK, a marketing subsidiary for Japan, and
the appointment of Dodwell as its marketing partner. Dodwell,
a subsidiary of Inchcape PLC, based in Britain, specializes
in packaged goods and has made extensive inroads in the
Japanese distribution system. The company will also appoint
McCann-Erickson Hakuhodo as its advertising agency.
   Nonetheless, Mattel will face some big hurdles.
Mom-and-pop stores still dominate Japan's tradition-bound
retail system, and retail outlets are linked to a cumbersome
wholesaler distribution network. In addition, while Japanese
consumers can be quite receptive to brand-name American
products, U.S. companies often stumble because of peripheral
issues.
   "Packaging is particularly important in Japan," says Ira
Bachrach, president of NameLab Inc., which has helped
position products there. "You can't depend on advertising
alone; it doesn't have the same direct, immediate impact that
it does here."
   Besides Barbie, the toy maker has high hopes that it will
eventually find a market in Japan for its other basic lines,
such as Hot Wheels die-cast cars and large dolls. Licensing
rights in Japan for Mattel's Walt Disney Co. infant and
preschool toys are being negotiated.
   But a sexier Barbie is leading the charge. Barbie's ties
to Japan date to 1958, when Mattel began manufacturing the
dolls there. And more than a decade ago, Mattel introduced
Barbie to Japanese consumers through a limited joint venture
with Bandai Co.
   But Mattel changed the look of its doll after Japanese
advisers insisted that a bosomy clotheshorse wouldn't appeal
to Japanese girls. As a result, she has sported the dark,
doe-eyed look of an ingenue and a decidedly flatter chest
than the voluptuous blue-eyed model sold everywhere else. Her
limbs also don't bend enough to allow her to hop casually
into a Barbie-sized Ferrari or climb the steps to a
Barbie-sized mansion, lucrative accessories that haven't been
widely available in Japan anyway.
   While market research did indicate that Japanese girls
preferred what they had been conditioned to accept, Mr.
Williams says that in hindsight, Mattel would have profited
from sticking to what works everywhere else. "This enormous
`World of Barbie' that we sell is one of fantasy and
aspiration," Mr. Williams says. "In Japan, we were never able
to develop the concept, because there were never any props."
   There was another problem that Mattel was slow to catch.
Girls in most countries lug shoeboxes stuffed with Barbie
regalia to friends' houses to play. But many Japanese girls
thought the doll belonged on display, like traditional
decorative Japanese dolls. That meant few additional dress
sales.
   Mattel is adopting another American-style twist: Pitch
directly to Junior, not Mom and Dad. United Nations
statistics show that the total discretionary income of
Japanese households now tops that of U.S. households. But
Mattel was operating "under the assumption that the Japanese
mother was a very stern gatekeeper," Mr. Williams says. "Our
recent research shows that the Japanese mother says she'll
buy whatever her girl asks for."
   Mattel will start selling directly to retail outlets,
essentially bypassing the wholesalers who have traditionally
had a lock on toy distribution. Mr. Williams says Dodwell can
help Mattel link up with a network of 1,400 mass merchandise
"superstores." The company also wants to tap into
increasingly popular Western-style shopping malls and into
department stores that attract shoppers interested in such
baubles as limited edition porcelain Barbies.
   Toys "R" Us, the giant U.S. toy discounter with strong
ties to Mattel, is also playing a useful role. Its
preparations to enter the Japanese market are shaking up the
retail end of the business, forcing wholesalers and retailers
to rethink their approaches, Mr. Williams says.
   Mattel thinks it can increase total annual fashion-doll
sales in Japan to between $125 million and $150 million in
three to five years. For the last few years, the fashion-doll
market has been relatively flat at less than $80 million. The
market for all Mattel products in Japan could hit $200
million in gross sales in seven to 10 years, Mr. Williams
says.
   The company is counting on overseas markets for much of
its growth over the next several years. International sales
jumped 36% last year to $750 million, compared with an
overall sales increase of 19%. Total sales were $1.47
billion.
   "We're not betting the company on this, but we're willing
to make a significant investment," Mr. Williams says of
Japan. And after three decades on the periphery, he adds with
a slight smile, "we've learned patience."
