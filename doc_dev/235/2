   A shimmering pink carpet was rolled out in front
of the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center on Monday night for
1,200 guests attending an unusual gala.
   Inside, women received wristlets of pink roses as they entered a
hall adorned with pink festoons. Waiters served pink champagne, or
rosy-hued Perrier if guests preferred, to accompany canapes served
on platters bedecked with pink orchids.
   Lights flashed as cameras recorded several stage and television
celebrities taking part in the festivities.
   But the star of the event didn't blink an eye. That's not
surprising _ she was Barbie, the doyen of fashion dolls who was
being honored for 30 years as a phenomenally successful toy.
   Mattel Inc. billed the black-tie affair as Barbie's ``Pink
Jubilee'' anniversary party. Company executives said the lavish
party was a fitting tribute to a toy that has shown such remarkable
longevity _ and profitability.
   ``Whatever the cost is, I think it's worth it,'' said John W.
Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``We don't spare the expense in presenting Barbie in a
first-class way,'' added Robert Sansone, Mattel's president.
   Although her popularity has waned now and then, Barbie has never
fallen completely out of favor. She has been one of the most
consistent toys in an industry notorious for quickly fading fads.
Barbie was the nation's second biggest selling toy last year, after
Nintendo video games, according to Toy &amp; Hobby World magazine.
   Each year, Barbie dolls pull in $450 million to $500 million in
revenue for Mattel.
   Part of the doll's success is credited to her adaptability. As
lifestyles and fashions changed over the years, Barbie's clothes and
accessories kept pace.
   Guests at Barbie's party were entertained by teen-aged girls
performing the ``Barbie Rap'' and doing the ``Barbie'' dance. The
rap number was interspersed with spoken tributes from several female
celebrities, including singer Melba Moore and actresses Allison
Smith, of the television show ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' and Nancy Dussault,
who has performed in the Broadway play ``Into The Woods.''
   New York Mayor Edward Koch marked the occasion by sending fan
mail. Mattel's Sansone read the mayor's letter before introducing
the entertainment.
   ``She has always reflected the times, and today stimulates the
imagination and delight of another generation,'' Koch wrote.
``Barbie's appearance in a wide variety of ethnic guises makes her a
great toy for New York, a city which draws unique energy from its
unparalleled ethnic diversity.''
   An audio-visual retrospective of the doll's 30 years set to tunes
on the pop charts during the different periods catalogued Barbie's
numerous wardrobe changes.
   In the early 1960s, a conservatively dressed Barbie was depicted
as a wholesome 21-year-old with a fun-loving streak who turned up,
bikini-clad, at beach parties every so often.
   Later on, Barbie donned ``mod'' clothing and her normally
clean-cut boyfriend Ken grew his hair almost shoulder length.
   More recently, Barbie has become a briefcase-toting career woman.
   This year finds Barbie characterized as a super star, decked out
in a star-encrusted tulle gown as the reigning queen of the fashion
doll world.
