<LEADPARA>  Even though she turned 30 last year, Barbie, the world's most popular 11
1/2-inch-tall fashion model, has managed to keep her alarmingly opulent
hourglass figure.;    But now a plastic upstart named "Happy To Be Me" has
thrown down her tiny gauntlet: Barbie is over the hill, she claims, and her
body has traumatized little girls for long enough.  </LEADPARA>

NEWCOMER TAKES AIM AT BARBIE'S MEASUREMENTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     For the past two years, Cathy Meredig has worked to fashion a politically
correct doll whose measurements aren't worthy of the Guinness Book of World
Records. And "Happy To Be Me" was finally unveiled this week.;    "If you look
at Barbie you'll see that her waist is half her chest. And that chest!" said
Brian Leininger, Meredig's husband and partner in their Minnesota company,
High Self-Esteem Toys. "Her eyes take up half her face. She looks like she's
going through life in a daze.";    Leininger said the "Happy To Be Me" doll
has much more realistic proportions. If Barbie had a 36-inch bust she would be
36-18-33, but Happy's less optimistic measurements would be 36-27-38.;   
"Cathy got upset by the message Barbie was sending to kids. Many girls are
very unhappy with their body image," Leininger said. "The fashion industry has
been sending girls a fairy tale but an unhealthy fairy tale. We're saying
you're terrific the way you are.";    Barbie loyalists are dismissing Happy as
just another flash in the pan without the right stuff to knock the Mattel
queen off her throne.;    "Barbie is like a dress model. Everyone knows that
when you have a dress form you adjust it," said Evelyn Burkhalter, founder of
the Barbie Hall of Fame in Palo Alto. "If you talk to any little girl, I bet
there isn't one who would complain about how Barbie's bust measurements relate
to her feet.;    "Barbie has followed fashion; this doll is trying to propose
it," Burkhalter said. "It won't work."  </TEXT>
