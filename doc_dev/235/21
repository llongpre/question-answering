   A Ken doll dressed in Barbie's clothing
wasn't a manufacturing mistake after all. It was a stock clerk's
prank.
   A clerk at a Toys R Us store acknowledged Tuesday he redressed
the doll one night while goofing off. The store fired him when he
confessed.
   ``We always did crazy things like that,'' Ron Zero said of the
antics of the store's late-night stockers. ``We'd hang dolls in the
aisle or put Ken and Barbie in the Barbie house with Barbie
spanking Ken.''
   Carina Guillot bought the Ken doll in the Tampa store last month
while visiting from New Jersey. It was dressed in a purple tank top
and a lace-covered purple and turquoise skirt.
   The doll quickly became a national spectacle _ spoofed by
Arsenio Hall, featured on ``The Joan Rivers Show'' and in Newsweek
and Fortune magazines.
   ``Oh well, it generated a lot of excitement for a while,'' Mrs.
Guillot said.
   The director of the store said he was embarrassed and Mattel,
the doll's maker, said it was vindicated.
   The store clerk said he dressed not one but three Ken dolls in
women's clothes. He resealed the boxes with clear glue.
   He said he doesn't know what happened to the first one, and
store managers have the third one. Store managers say that's not
true.
   Zero said he laughed when he saw news stories about the doll.
   ``It was a kid clowning around,'' said store director Greg
Warren. ``We had one fellow with quite a sense of humor.''
   Warren said Zero was fired for tampering with the Ken dolls and
several other toys.
