<LEADPARA>  JACK RYAN, credited with the creation of the Barbie doll, died last week at
age 65. Mr. Ryan was a rather fascinating man. In addition to the doll, he
designed around 35 of the country's best-selling toys, including the Chatty
Cathy talking doll, Hot Wheels and many electronic toys. While working for
Raytheon, Ryan developed the Sparrow and Hawk missiles. On top of all that, he
was married to Zsa Zsa Gabor.;   Still, Ryan was best known for his Barbie
doll, a model of babefection. And so we called Evelyn Burkhalter, founder and
curator of the Barbie Hall of Fame in Palo Alto, to see if there was any kind
of special event planned to commemorate the death of Barbie's "father."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Burkhalter said she had no such plans. For one thing, the name Ryan didn't
come up in her Barbie research. Burkhalter said Barbie was a copycat of the
Lilli doll from Germany, Americanized by Ruth and Elliott Handler, two of the
three original owners of Mattel. The Handlers had a daughter named Barbie, and
a son named . . . Ken.;   Ryan may have worked for the Handlers on the Barbie
design team, Burkhalter conceded.;   Ryan may have had a hand in the Barbie
Fashion Queen, introduced around 1963. The doll had a molded head and had
three wigs. Burkhalter noted that Ryan was wedded to Zsa Zsa, who along with
sister Eva are known as wig aficionados. "I guess that's why he came up with
the idea," she said.;   Meanwhile, the Barbie museum is now 16,000 strong, or
"99.8 percent complete," as Burkhalter put it. It's at 460 Waverley St. if
you'd like to check it out.; COLLEGE-BOUND: Some community activists in East
Palo Alto are holding a celebration to send some of the city's youth off to
college. While some 90 percent of high school graduates in neighboring Palo
Alto go on to college, only 30 percent to 40 percent of the youths in East
Palo Alto graduate from high school. The percentage of those who go on to
college is even smaller.;   The United Mothers Against Drugs, an East Palo
Alto activist group, is trying to encourage more students to continue their
education. So on Friday, members of the group and other residents and
politicos will gather in the council chamber to present scholarships to 10
seniors. The prizes are not much -- about $100 each in books and pens and such
-- but they represent a big achievement for the kids in this mostly poor
community.  </TEXT>
