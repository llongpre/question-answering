<LEADPARA>  There are Barbie dolls. Barbie dream houses. Even a Barbie record.;    Now
there are Barbie boutiques. The departments will open in Sears and Wal-Mart
stores in September and feature "a sea of pink," Meryl Friedman, Mattel's vice
president for Barbie Consumer Products, told Advertising Age.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There will also be a sea of ads, judging by their $40 million budget. And
scads of new fab Barbie merchandise, including Barbie swimwear, jackets,
umbrellas, home fashions and bicycles. "We've been very careful about how to
use Barbie to market merchandise other than dolls, because we want to maintain
her integrity," Friedman explained. Sure. You don't want to do anything to
jeopardize that.;    Let's just hope those incriminating photos of Ken and
G.I. Joe never come to light.;  GETTING OUT; (box) TONIGHT: The Brazen Hussy
