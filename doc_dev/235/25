   Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., said it earned $8.7 million,
or 15 cents per share, from April to June. That compared with $18.2
million, or 31 cents per share, during the same 1989 period.
   Revenue fell 7.8 percent to $277.3 million from $301.4 million.
   Hasrbo chief financial officer John T. O'Neill said costs
associated with the dropped racing car toy Record Breakers hurt
earnings. The company also blamed the poor performance on slow
domestic sales.
   For the first six months of 1990, earnings fell 23.6 percent to
$28.2 million, or 48 cents per share, from $36.9 million, or 63
cents per share.
   Half-year revenue was $578.4 million, down from $589.7 million
last year.
   Hasbro is counting on a third-quarter rebound from the
introduction of dolls based on the pop music group New Kids on the
Block and on performers affiliated with the World Wrestling
Federation.

   Hawthorne, Calif.-based Mattel profits rose on strong
international sales of such products as Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels
toys.
   Mattel said it earned $20.3 million, or 40 cents per share, in
the second quarter, up from $16.6 million, or 33 cents a share,
last year. Sales rose 17 percent to $318 million from $272 million.
   In the first half of 1990, earnings gained 37 percent to $28.7
million, or 57 cents per share, on sales of $552 million. That
compared with 1989 first-half earnings of $20.9 million, or 42
cents per share, on $468 million in sales.
   The company benefited from increased sales of such core products
as Barbie, Hot Wheels, Disney Preschool and Infant Toys, He-Man,
large dolls and See'N Say, said John W. Amerman, chairman and chief
executive.
