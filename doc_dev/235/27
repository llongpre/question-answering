Barbie, He-Man and Hot Wheels racing cars led giant toy maker Mattel Inc. to 
income of almost $70 million in 1989, although a one-time charge of $11 million 
cut into the fourth quarter, Mattel's chairman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne-based company reported 1989 earnings of $68.7 million, almost 
double the $35.9 million reported in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However, the $9.7 million in earnings during the fourth quarter dropped from 
$10.5 million reported in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Mattel called for redemption of a subordinated debt, which 
resulted in a one-time charge of $11 million to 1989 earnings. The redemption 
will result in annual interest savings in 1990 of $8.8 million, said Johm W. 
Amerman, Mattel's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Amerman said the company's long-established products, its presence in the 
international market and its manufacturing networks contributed to increased 
sales for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Amerman said its 30-year-old legend, Barbie doll, and He-Man, Hot Wheels racing 
cars, Disney toys and Li'l Miss Dolls "are our core business products that 
endure over the years."
