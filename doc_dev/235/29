spot - Karen Zagor on benefits of the US group's merger with Fisher-Price

THE merger with Fisher-Price will transform Mattel, the number two US
toy-maker, into a worthy rival to industry leader Hasbro, swelling Mattel's
market share from 11 per cent to 15 per cent, just short of Hasbro's 16 per
cent share.
The next biggest company is Tyco, accounting for 5 per cent of the market,
according to Mr Gary Jacobson, analyst at Kidder Peabody. 'I think we will
continue to see smaller acquisitions,' says Mr Jacobson, 'but there is
nothing left of this magnitude.' Tyco, which posted losses for the first
half of this year, is considered too troubled to be attractive to Mattel or
Hasbro.
Mattel, once an unstable performer in an industry noted for its volatility,
has posted steady gains in sales and earnings since 1990. The company owes
much of its strength to the success of core brands, notably the Barbie doll,
Mattel's 34-year old fashion doll which last year accounted for around 50
per cent of sales.
The company, which last posted a loss of Dollars 113.2m in 1987, has found
stability by discarding non-toy assets, cutting overheads and personnel and
focusing on core products at the expense of more faddish toys. Last year, it
earned Dollars 143.8m, up from Dollars 117.2m in 1991 and Dollars 95.5m
1990. But some analysts say Mattel is too reliant on the Barbie doll.
The Fisher-Price deal will ease some of these concerns, reducing Barbie's
share of sales to just under 39 per cent for the combined company with
Fisher-Price contributing an additional 30 per cent of sales. Mattel's other
mainstay lines - Disney-based pre-school toys and the Hot Wheels car line -
will account for 10 per cent and 5 per cent of company sales respectively.
Fisher-Price, which is the dominant player in the infant and pre-school end
of the business, will help bolster Mattel's toy lines in this area. This is
particularly important because Mattel's Disney infant/preschool line has
been one of its weaker areas.
Mattel hopes to broaden Fisher-Price's overseas sales with the help of its
own distribution channels - about half of Mattel's sales are outside the US,
compared with 25 per cent for Fisher-Price.
'We also see opportunities with regards to manufacturing facilities,' says
Mattel. 'We have looked at two Fisher-Price plants in the US and think we
can put some Mattel products, currently produced by vendors, into these
plants.'
Fisher-Price, with a product range including Chatter Telephone, Play Desk
and a wide range of playsets, has been seen as a likely takeover candidate
since 1991, when it was spun off from Quaker Oats.
It earned Dollars 41.3m last year, up from Dollars 14.6m in 1991, but some
toy analysts have long felt that Fisher-Price needed big player muscle to
remain wholly competitive. Mattel, which had approached Fisher-Price at the
time of the spin-off, was the obvious suitor.
'The deal makes sense for both parties,' says Mr Harold Vogel, of Merrill
Lynch. 'Mattel had a need for it and Fisher-Price seemed to have difficulty
competing in a long-term sense against the big toy manufacturers. This gives
Mattel a little bit more balance. Whether it actually accelerates earnings
growth is another story.'
Balance is less of a concern for Hasbro, the world's biggest toy company.
Hasbro's greatest strength is the diversity of its products: it made 1992
profits of Dollars 179.2m compared with underlying earnings of Dollars
122.7m the previous year, excluding restructuring charges related an
acquisition. Products range from a strong preschool Playskool line, GI Joe
action doll for boys and board games, including Monopoly and Trivial
Pursuit.
A bigger Mattel will put pressure on Hasbro to retain its number one spot in
the toy industry, but there is still ample room for both companies to grow.
The combined domestic market share for Mattel and Hasbro is about 30 per
cent, 'leaving a tremendous room for growth', says Mr Jacobson.
Hasbro may even benefit from a more equal rival in Mattel. Stronger Mattel
toys will draw more customers into toy stores and get more products on to
shelves. And increased profits stability will allow Mattel to take greater
risks with its products.
If Mattel and Hasbro continue to grow, they may be more threatening to the
smaller companies than to each other. 'It's going to be more difficult for
small players to survive,' warns Mr Jacobson. 'But there will be niche
categories because, as Mattel and Hasbro get bigger, they will not pay
attention to the smaller niches.'
Moody's Investors Service has placed Mattel's debt ratings under review for
possible upgrade, citing acceleration in Mattel's progress 'in diversifying
its product array from Barbie toys'. Moody's expects the merger to enhance
earnings predictability without increasing debt.
