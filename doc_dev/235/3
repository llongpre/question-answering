   They rolled out the pink carpet at Lincoln
Center, where the celebrities wore pink roses and sipped pink
champagne and pink Perrier. But the guest of honor didn't so much as
blush.
   That's not surprising _ she was Barbie, the doyenne of fashion
dolls, who was honored Monday night for her successful 30-year
career as one of the most popular American toys.
   Mattel Inc. billed the black-tie affair as Barbie's ``Pink
Jubilee'' anniversary party. Company executives said the lavish
party, which helped kick off the annual toy industry fair, was a
fitting tribute to a toy that has shown such remarkable longevity _
and profitability.
   ``Whatever the cost is, I think it's worth it,'' said John W.
Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Although her popularity has waned now and then, Barbie has never
fallen completely out of favor. She has been one of the most
consistent toys in an industry notorious for quickly fading fads.
Barbie was the nation's second biggest-selling toy last year, after
Nintendo video games, according to Toy &amp; Hobby World magazine.
   Each year, Barbie dolls pull in $450 million to $500 million in
revenue for Mattel.
   Part of the doll's success is credited to her adaptability. As
lifestyles and fashions changed over the years, Barbie's clothes and
accessories kept pace.
   Guests at Barbie's party were entertained by teen-age girls
performing the ``Barbie Rap'' and doing the ``Barbie'' dance. The
rap number was interspersed with spoken tributes from several female
celebrities, including singer Melba Moore and actresses Allison
Smith, of the television show ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' and Nancy Dussault,
who has performed in the Broadway play ``Into The Woods.''
   New York Mayor Edward Koch marked the occasion by sending fan
mail.
   ``She has always reflected the times, and today stimulates the
imagination and delight of another generation,'' Koch wrote.
``Barbie's appearance in a wide variety of ethnic guises makes her a
great toy for New York, a city which draws unique energy from its
unparalleled ethnic diversity.''
   An audiovisual retrospective of the doll's 30 years set to tunes
on the pop charts during the different periods cataloged Barbie's
numerous wardrobe changes.
   In the early 1960s, a conservatively dressed Barbie was depicted
as a wholesome 21-year-old with a fun-loving streak who turned up,
bikini-clad, at beach parties every so often.
   Later on, Barbie donned ``mod'' clothing and her normally
clean-cut boyfriend Ken grew his hair almost shoulder length.
   More recently, Barbie has become a briefcase-toting career woman.
   This year finds Barbie characterized as a superstar, decked out
in a star-encrusted tulle gown as the reigning queen of the fashion
doll world. If she lives up to her reputation, the other dolls will
be pink with envy.
