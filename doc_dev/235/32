<TEXT>     Mr. Ryan, who held more than 1,000 patents on inventions around the world,
designed the Sparrow and Hawk missiles when he worked for Raytheon. But it was
his toy inventions that put his engineering genius into households across the
United States.;   Mr. Ryan designed about 35 of the country's best-selling
toys, including the Chatty Cathy talking doll, Hot Wheels and many electronic
toys.;   But his best-known product was Barbie, the tall, slender, young adult
doll that could be purchased with a never-ending wardrobe, boyfriend Ken, and
cars, playhouses and career paraphernalia.;   Never mind that critics said
that the doll -- with its torpedo breasts, tiny waist and disproportionately
long legs -- gave little girls a false and unachievable ideal of the female
adult figure. Just about every girl wanted one anyway, complete with clothes
and accessories.;   Mr. Ryan applied part of the wealth he acquired from his
inventions to a Tudor mansion in 1962 in the upscale Bel-Air neighborhood of
Los Angeles and turned it into a major Southern California party site.;   He
and his then-wife, Barbara, opened the grounds and public rooms of the vast
mansion for charity fund-raisers, annually hosting more than 150 events with
as many as 1,000 guests each.;   Mr. Ryan was married several times. One of
his marriages was to Zsa Zsa Gabor.;   Survivors include his wife, Magda; two
daughters, Ann and Diana; and two granddaughters.  </TEXT>
