   LOS ANGELES -- Mattel Inc. and Walt Disney Co. are out to
prove it really is a small world after all.
   The two companies, both of which target children as their
primary consumers, plan to forge close ties with a long-term
alliance that includes Mattel-sponsored attractions at Disney
theme parks, development of park-related toys, and expansion
of Disney's lucrative toy-licensing pacts with Mattel.

   Under the agreement, the companies will sell Disney-Mattel
infant and preschool toys, and other Mattel toys, at special
retail locations in and around the Disney parks. The
companies also will sponsor joint promotions tied to the huge
tourist attractions.
   The announcement, pegged in part to next year's opening of
Euro Disneyland outside Paris, underscores the importance of
overseas business for both companies. Mattel-Disney toys will
be on the shelves and the Mattel name on an attraction when
Euro Disneyland's gates open in April.
   "More of Mattel's growth, like our own, will be coming
from the international market rather than the more mature
domestic market," said Frank G. Wells, Disney's president and
chief operating officer. "If you look at the projections, the
enormity of growth in Europe exceeds that of any other
geographic section of the world."
   For Mattel, the collaboration's Disney-related products
represent a powerhouse line that could someday rival its top
seller, Barbie. With projected world-wide sales of more than
$800 million this year, Barbie is expected to top $1 billion
within a few years.
   "The Disney-related products are the second cornerstone of
our company," said John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and
chief executive officer. "Will Disney get to the level of
Barbie in 10 years? I don't know, but Disney has tremendous
potential." The alliance is also important to Mattel's
overseas strategy; about half of the company's $1.47 billion
in 1990 sales came from abroad.
   The news pushed Mattel's stock up 37.5 cents a share to
$35.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Disney's stock fell 25 cents a share to $114.625.
   Disney has long been thought to be interested in
acquisitions. A Disney spokesman said the company doesn't
comment on speculation, but said there's no Mattel-related
statement planned beyond yesterday's announcement.
   Mattel first tapped into the Disney marketing magic in
1987, when it signed a five-year accord to make infant and
preschool toys. This year, Disney-Mattel toy sales will top
$200 million. That includes toys tied to movie re-releases
such as "101 Dalmatians" and "Cinderella," as well as the
infant and preschool lines. It will soon be augmented by
products drawing on Disney's new "Beauty and the Beast."
   The new agreement extends Mattel's existing toy licenses
for 10 years, and also allows for future licenses tied to new
or re-released properties.
   The deal vaults Mattel into the ranks of a select few
Disney partners -- including Coca-Cola Co., Delta Air Lines
and Eastman Kodak Co. -- that have exclusive and enormously
valuable ties with the entertainment giant. Through the
various agreements, Mattel is tying itself to a name that
connotes Americana, family and children's toys around the
world.
   At Disneyland in California and Walt Disney World in
Florida, Mattel will sponsor the popular "It's a Small World"
attractions, which use dolls to play off an international
theme and are scheduled to be refurbished. At Euro
Disneyland, Mattel will sponsor Autopia, a souped-up version
of the minicar rides popular at the domestic Disney parks.
The ride will be tied in with Mattel's Hot Wheels and Corgi
toy cars, though Mr. Amerman said that's a small aspect of
the overall sponsorship.
   Neither company would value the attraction sponsorship or
any other aspect of the alliance, but analysts estimate
sponsorship of a Disney park attraction has a value of $10
million to $15 million over several years. It's generally
considered a modest sum for the resulting high visibility
among the estimated 60 million people who visit the three
parks each year.
   Mr. Wells calls Euro Disneyland the linchpin for all
Disney products, from movies to television shows and all
types of consumer products. The Mattel alliance is part of
Disney's efforts to keep its merchandising efforts in high
gear. Analysts also say Disney is also cleaning up some
lower-quality Disney toy products that were licensed to other
companies several years ago, when the company was less
vigilant about maintaining its image as a top-quality
consumer brand.
   "This clearly puts Mattel in the pre-eminent position for
Disney-related products," said Harold Vogel, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch Research. He noted that a few valuable licenses
are still held by competitors, including Hasbro Inc.'s
license for plush dolls of Mickey Mouse and other characters.
   Of the toys to be sold at the parks, most are expected to
have some sort of Disney tie-in, Mr. Amerman said, citing as
one possible example a Barbie in Disney characters' garb. Mr.
Wells declined to give specific figures for average sales per
square foot at the parks' retail outlets, but he said the
figure is "in many cases 10 times that of traditional retail
America."
   One important geographic area not included in the
agreement is Japan, where Disney operates Tokyo Disneyland
and Mattel is attempting to crack the retail market. Disney
properties are popular in Japan, the world's No. 2 toy
market. But much of Disney's licensing there is tied up with
the Japanese theme park's landowner and a Japanese toy maker,
Tomy Ltd.
   Neither Mr. Wells nor Mr. Amerman would discuss specific
plans for future Japanese toy licenses because of the
delicate relationships with their respective Japanese
business contacts. Mattel plans to introduce Barbie products
there first, and hopes to add other lines, perhaps including
new Disney products.
