<TEXT>     Industry officials released a downbeat report as the 10-day trade
exposition opened.;    Many companies appeared to be taking a more
conservative approach as they presented new lines, sticking with ideas that
worked well in 1990. That meant more baby dolls for girls, wrestling action
figures for boys and games and toys spun off from TV shows and comic books.;  
 The Toy Manufacturers of America, the trade group that sponsors the big show,
said sales of traditional toys -- those other than video games -- were
virtually unchanged last year. Shipments rose just 0.3 percent in terms of
dollars and 0.2 percent in terms of units.;    The group estimated video game
sales rose 20.9 percent in dollars and 33.8 percent in units.;    Officials
forecast wholesale and retail toy sales would rise 5 percent for 1991, but
they said as much as two-thirds of that increase would be from price
increases, not more sales.;    George R. Ditomassi, the trade group's
chairman, said business was difficult in 1990 because budget-conscious
consumers spent less on toys.;    Several companies expanded their lines of
wrestling toys after that segment sold well last year. Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.
has World Championship Wrestling figures, while Hasbro Inc. and Tonka Corp.
are again offering lines associated from the World Wrestling Federation.;   
Hasbro is going beyond dolls and figures. The company is also selling
wrestling gear for boys, including shirts with photos of well-developed
pectorals imprinted on them.;    Baby and little girl dolls have been big
business the past few years, and manufacturers are again competing to have the
most clever and cutest dolls.;    Hasbro introduced Baby Wanna Walk, while
Mattel extended its successful Magic Nursery line to include pets. Tyco Toys
Inc. added to its extensive Ideal line of dolls by bringing back Thumbelina, a
namesake of dolls that today's mothers once played with.;    Mattel extended
the Barbie line, adding new outfits and signing a licensing agreement with
singer M.C. Hammer of Fremont to create a doll in his likeness to fit in with
the Barbie line.;    Few manufacturers were selling toys connected with the
gulf war.; TOY SALES; More than 1.75 billion toys were sold in 1989, up only;
three percent from 1988. Here's a look at some categories; of toys; ...;
