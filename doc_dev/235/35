<HEAD>Mattel's Income Up 73 Percent</HEAD>

   Mattel Inc. Thursday reported a 73 percent gain in third-quarter
earnings and said sales grew by about a third thanks to strong
performances by Barbie dolls, Hot Wheels and other toys.
   The toy company announced after-tax income of $38 million in the
third quarter compared to $21.9 million a year earlier. Sales rose
34 percent to $410 million from $306.6 million in 1988's third
quarter.
   Quarterly earnings per share of 76 cents in the three months
ended Sept. 30 exceeded per-share earnings for all of 1988. In the
third quarter of last year, per-share earnings came to 45 cents.
   John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company's double-digit growth occurred despite lackluster
sales industrywide.
   ``Worldwide retail trade and consumer sales for Barbie, Hot
Wheels Disney Infant and Preschool toys, and products introduced in
1989 remain very strong,'' said John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman
and chief executive officer.
   ``The prospects for a strong fourth quarter are good,'' Amerman
said.
   Mattel earned $58.9 million, or $1.19 a share, through the first
nine months of 1989, up 32 percent from $25.4 million, or 53 cents
a share, during three quarters of last year.
   Nine-month revenue rose 25 percent to $877.6 million from $702.4
million.
   Mattel currently is based in Hawthorne, Calif. but it plans to
move to a new headquarters building in El Segundo by the end of
1990.
