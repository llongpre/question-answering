   Turtles-on-Ice may sound like tempting
delicacies to adventurous food fanatics but these reptiles are
inedible.
   A band of skating, human-sized Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will
stage an ice show Sunday on a rink in New York's Central Park.
   The show featuring costumed professionals on loan from the Ice
Capades is one of the gimmicks planned for this year's Toy Fair, an
annual outpouring of hyperbole to stoke enthusiasm for new
creations and old favorites.
   Toymakers spare no expense or imagination in dreaming up
attention-grabbing stunts for the annual 10-day event in New York.
   ``This is show biz. This is a fun industry and this sets a tone
of fun, excitement and adventure,'' said Frank Reysen Jr., editor
of Playthings magazine, a trade publication.
   Publicity also is serious business for a multibillion-dollar
industry in which companies rely on the capricious tastes of
children. At the trade exhibition, manufacturers try to hook buyers
from all over the country scouting for inventory that will move off
store shelves quickly.
   Toy Fair visitors _ who must be members of the trade or media
and at least 18 years old _ typically encounter clowns, actors
dressed as cartoon characters, real movie stars, sports celebrities
and outlandish creatures.
   This year a fierce but environmentally friendly intergalactic
ninja named Zen will debut, as will a 12-foot ``BRIKasaurus Tex,''
a dinosaur replica built from BRIK Toy Co. blocks. Another company
plans to assemble the world's biggest crossword puzzle with the
help of 50 schoolchildren.
   Hasbro Inc. will have on hand the New Kids on the Block to pitch
a new doll line modeled on the singing fivesome.
   Super models Christie Brinkley, Beverly Johnson and Cheryl Tiegs
will show up to plug high-fashion dolls from Matchbox Toys (USA)
Ltd.
   Anniversaries are planned for some old-timers in toyland. Etch A
Sketch will be feted for turning 30 by Ohio Art Co. while Tonka
Corp. will pay tribute as its Mighty Tonka Truck line rumbles into
year 25.
   Barbie, who celebrated her 30th birthday last year with much
fanfare, will add a new career in 1990. At a black-tie gala Monday
night, Mattel Inc. will announce that the darling of the doll world
will become an ambassador of international goodwill.
   Mattel will outline plans to sponsor the ``Barbie Summit,''
designed to bring children together from different countries to
talk about world issues. To add drama, the company has flown to New
York a 6-year-old East German girl, Anika Polzin, who had been
photographed clutching a new Barbie on her first visit recently to
West Germany.
   The most tongue-in-cheek publicity pitch may be delivered by the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles courtesy of Playmates Toys Inc. The
figures are based on a comic about four pet turtles endowed with
human proportions after they were doused by a mutagen chemical in a
sewer. They learned Ninja ways from a martial arts master mutated
into a giant rat.
   The turtles, fighting for life, liberty and the pursuit of
pizza, their favorite food, will appear around New York. The
skating show, an Easter Seal benefit, will be followed by a Meet
the Mutants autograph session.
   Industry gimmicks concocted to beseech the press for publicity
reached new levels this year. An actor in a turtle costume peddling
free pizza was dispatched Friday to woo reporters who will be
covering Toy Fair.
   A small party of the turtles and their foes were to troop around
the streets of Manhattan on Monday. A local radio station plans to
interview Wall Street brokers for reaction to New York's first
mutant parade.
   Playmates, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Playmates Holdings
Ltd., also is aggressively promoting its line spun off from the
upcoming Dick Tracy movie. The film, starring Warren Beatty and
Madonna, opens June 15.
   One hundred pairs of personalized handcuffs were sent to members
of the media. To get the keys, reporters must show up at the
Playmates showroom during the fair.
   About 350 reporters received ``talking'' invitations to see the
Dick Tracy stuff. Cards of walkie-talkie wrist telephones, costing
$8.50 a pop, contained sophisticated circuitry that summoned
individual reporters by name to the Playmates showroom.
   Why go to such trouble?
   ``This is really the only chance of impressing and reaching the
toy buyers about your product line,'' said Timothy Unger, a public
relations executive handling the Playmates account.
   With hundreds of exhibitors at Toy Fair, he said. ``it's very
important that you add as much pizazz as possible to your program.''
