<HEAD>Toymaker Says 1988 Profit Of $35.9 Million Demonstrates Recovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAWTHORNE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Mattel Inc. said Tuesday that two years
of belt-tightening and refocusing on such tried-and-true toys as
Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toy cars paid off in a modest 1988
profit of $35.9 million.
   That is far less than the $80 million Mattel earned in 1985, but
a vast improvement from losses of $8.3 million in 1986 and $113.2
million in 1987.
   The $35.9 million profit reported Tuesday amounts to 75 cents a
share. Sales in 1988 were $990 million, compared with $1 billion in
1987.
   In 1988's fourth quarter, Mattel earned $10.5 million, or 22
cents a share, compared with a $100.7 million loss in the fourth
quarter of 1987. Sales in the quarter were $287.6 million, up from
$233.8 million a year earlier.
   ``Our plan to return the company to solid profitability is on
course,'' John Amerman, chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement.
   In addition to Barbie and Hot Wheels, the company said it enjoyed
retail success with the Little Miss Makeup doll and a line of
Disney-themed toys for toddlers and pre-schoolers.
   The 1987 loss was blamed on a restructuring program that included
laying off 500 employees at Mattel's headquarters, closing several
plants overseas and doing away with marginal toy lines.
   The 1986 loss was blamed in large part on slumping sales of the
once-popular Masters of the Universe toys.
