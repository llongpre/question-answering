<TEXT>     Bibeau was preparing to assemble an accessory for her 10-year-old
daughter's Barbie doll Christmas present when a small photograph showing a man
and woman engaged in oral sex fell from the box. Writing on the back of the
photograph described a sex act between the Barbie character and a man, she
said.;   A similar discovery was also made on Wednesday in Attleboro, a town
near Rhode Island.;   Meg Camara said her 6-year-old daughter ripped open a
package containing a Barbie companion doll and found photos showing two women
having sex.;   "She said, 'Why did Santa bring me naked ladies?' How do you
explain that to a 6-year-old?" Camara said.;   Martin Meehan, assistant
district attorney, said a 5-year-old girl in Lynnfield also pulled a
pornographic photo from a Barbie Christmas gift.;   "It is sick stuff," he
said.;   In November, Middlesex District Attorney Thomas Reilly reported that
pornographic materials had been found in dozens of toy packages in Boston-area
stores, and investigators said it was possible the latest finds were connected
to the earlier ones.;   Robert Reesman, 55, of Lexington, was arrested last
month in the earlier case. He was charged with disseminating pornographic
material to minors for allegedly putting pictures and literature into packages
containing Barbie, Midge and G.I. Joe toys at a Watertown retail store.;   The
Barbie doll series is made by Mattel, a toy-maker based in El Segundo. Company
officials couldn't be reached for comment Thursday. An answering machine at
company headquarters said the offices were closed for the holidays.  </TEXT>
