<LEADPARA>  LITTLE girls are either "into dolls" or they are not. It disturbed me that
when my daughter received a doll, within seconds she would punch out the eyes,
rip off all the clothes and sling it under the bed, where it would lie naked
among the dust balls whimpering with fear.;   As a child, I was "into dolls."
In fact, I still visit toy stores and walk through the aisles of yarn hair,
dimpled knees and glassy eyes and can't resist the impulse to cradle them and
discover what they're doing this year.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Frankly, they're doing plenty. They not only crawl, walk, talk and burp,
they fill their diapers with disgusting things that could set motherhood back
200 years. A doll called Madeline has a scar from her appendix operation; a
Mermaid doll, when immersed in cold water, will change color. Big deal.;  
Another doll's hair changes color when the temperature changes. One wears
glasses; another makes sucking noises when a bottle is put to her lips. There
was one with feet that grow 2 inches a month.;   In the quest to have art
imitate life, there is a new doll on the shelves this Christmas called the
"Happy To Be Me" doll. It's touted as a politically correct Barbie with a
social agenda. Her mission? To help young girls develop realistic body images
and accept themselves as they are.;   The whole concept titillated me. Would
"Happy" have cellulite that made her look like a Cadillac with fins? A stomach
implant? Veins in the back of her knees like a New England road map? No. She
had bigger feet than fashion dolls, her legs bent, and her measurements were
36-27-38 compared to Barbie's 36-18-33, but she still didn't look like anyone
I'd seen recently in Loehmann's fitting room.;   It brings up the question,
how much reality can we stand? Barbie has endured for more than 32 years.
She's been an astronaut, a UNICEF ambassador, a summit diplomat, an airline
pilot and a Canadian Mountie.;   She's dated Ken for 30 years. Considering his
jobs have been less exciting than hers (a businessman in 1965 and a flight
attendant in 1990), neither seem threatened.;   She has not had a mother
pressuring her to give her grandchildren. She's never succumbed to
commercialism by bringing out an exercise video.;   Who is to say that Dolly
Parton didn't fantasize over Barbie's 2-inch bust or that all of us haven't
wanted to tear off our head and replace it with a new hairstyle? Barbie has
kept the dream alive. That's what dolls are all about.  </TEXT>
