   Mattel Inc., which has come through a year of sometimes wrenching restructuring and downsizing, has revised its marketing strategy to succeed in a toy business that wants more basic playthings and has fewer stores and more competition for shelf space. 

   Gone will be company funding for expensive kiddie cartoon shows whose characters are based on toys. 

   Gone, too, will be nearly 20% of the individual toys presented to retailers each year. 
Instead, a greater percentage of sales will come from longtime staples such as Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars. 
Advertising-promotional expenses will shrink too. 

   And also gone, or at least considerably downplayed, will be Mattel's vaunted attempt over the past half-decade to make toys an all-year-round business. 

   "Last year was a difficult one for the industry and for us," concedes John W. Amerman, who became chairman and chief executive officer of the world's second largest toy company a little more than a year ago. 
"But we're determined to run this company with greater marketing and financial discipline, and we're going to be highly successful in 1988 and beyond." 

   Mattel reported a net loss in 1987 of $113.2 million after one-time restructuring charges of $96 million. 
Little noticed at the time, the company also effected a "quasi-reorganization" that revalued assets upward by $68.7 million, thus reducing the negative effect of the loss on shareholders' equity. 

   Mattel in the early 1980s was a company driven to increase volume almost for its own sake, and in fact, sales nearly doubled between 1982 and 1985, Mr. Amerman notes. 
But the extra layers of management and vast expansion of manufacturing capacity became a burden as sales flattened and then turned south, he adds. 

   Mattel was starting to work on the problems. 
"And then came the Oct. 19 crash, and retailers in an unprecedented way pulled back on orders," Mr. Amerman says. 

   So Mattel speeded up its changes. 
By the end of June, Mr. Amerman will have shuttered 10 facilities accounting for 40% to 50% of the company's world-wide manufacturing capacity. 
Some 500 headquarters positions, or 22% of the total, were eliminated. 
Mattel is also keeping its inventories lower than at any time in the past few years by making "less aggressive volume projections," Mr. Amerman says. 

   But long-term health required basic changes in Mattel's marketing strategies. 

   "We've decided to concentrate on those areas where we've historically been strong, while slowly building in other areas," such as preschool, where the firm has signed a long-term licensing agreement to use Disney characters on its entire line, Mr. Amerman says. 
Mattel has cut the total number of individual toys it sells to around 650 from 800, and is shying away from heavily advertised "promotional" toys that tend to fade after one season. 

   "We want to take a rifle-shot, not a buckshot, approach to the business by picking our risks carefully instead of going for high volume across the board," Mr. Amerman says. 
"We're looking for items that'll last two to four years or more." 
Barbie, who will turn 30 next year, accounted for about 40% of world-wide sales last year and is back this year with a new advertising campaign and fashions. 

   Total advertising and promotion expenses are expected to continue dropping. 
In 1986, they were $198.2 million, or 19% of sales; last year they were $188.2 million, or 18%; and this year they are expected to drop to around $174 million, or 16%. 
Mattel has cut back on its mall and other live promotions. 

   But a major reason for the drop is that Mattel will no longer itself fund children's television programs, a practice that has come under fire by some parents' groups. 
In 1986 alone, Mattel figures it spent $6.4 million more than the advertising value it received to fund production of TV cartoons. 

   The company also will go along more with consumer buying patterns, rather than try to buck them, Mr. Amerman says. 
"I guess there's a philosophical change here, but we realize that we can't load the retailer with an awful lot of product early in the year that won't move until the last quarter."
