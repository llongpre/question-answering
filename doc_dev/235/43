   Barbie doll maker Mattel Inc. said a federal court judge
barred Lundby of Sweden AB and its U.S. unit from airing a
television commercial that promotes Lundby's Petra doll as a
friend of Barbie's.
   Judge David V. Kenyon granted Mattel's request for a
preliminary injunction to halt the commercials pending trial
of a suit brought by Mattel against Lundby earlier this
month. The suit charges Lundby with false advertising, unfair
competition and trademark violations.

   The order restrains Lundby from "directly or indirectly
identifying and/or suggesting" that any of its dolls are
related to Barbie, or any other dolls sold by Mattel.
   Officials at Lundby of Sweden USA Inc., based in Tucson,
Ariz., couldn't be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for
Mattel, based in El Segundo, Calif., said a trial date hasn't
been set.
