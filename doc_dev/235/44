<LEADPARA>  BOYS ages 11 through 17 have long been the core market for home video games.; 
  But two small video manufacturers hope to change some of that this year with
two new games targeted for little girls ages 6 through 11.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This summer Capcom USA will introduce "The Little Mermaid" video game, and
in the fall Hi Tech Expressions will follow that with a "Barbie" video game.; 
  Both companies say they hope to offer a video game that little girls will
like and will feel is exclusively theirs.;    "Until now, girls have had to
make do with their brothers' games," said Kathleen Watson, Capcom director of
marketing. "Now they can say, 'I have the Little Mermaid game and my brother
hates it.' ";    Both games differ from conventional video games in their
approach to violence: Hardly any.;    "The Little Mermaid" loosely follows the
plot of the movie.;    Ariel's friends have been captured by Ursula the sea
witch, and it's her job to set them free. But to do so, the Little Mermaid
must make it through a series of worlds, some on land and others under the
sea.;    By collecting things -- shells, little fish -- the Little Mermaid
builds her strength and eventually is strong enough to take on Ursula.;   
"Barbie" has an even more benign motif, but one that is in character for
Mattel's fashion-conscious classic.;    Barbie is asleep, dreaming about the
ball she is going to but worried that she has nothing to wear. She solves her
problem by succeeding through a series of worlds, at the end of which are
various accessories and clothes she'll need to be the hit of the party.;   
For example, in one underwater world, Barbie gets by a large octopus by
tossing it a compact and slipping behind it while the octopus is primping.;   
In other video games, when the lead characters fail they die, and you have to
start the game over again. But of course, Barbie can never die! In this game,
if Barbie fails she merely wakes up, and then you start the game again.;   
"Barbie is about glamour," says Joan Ziegler, vice president of product
acquisition for Hi Tech. "That's what we are trading on with this. It's very
pro-social and positive and not an aggressive, beat-'em-up game.";    Hi Tech
and Capcom have previously introduced video games targeted for a preschool
audience. Between the two companies there are Muppets, Disney and Sesame
Street games.;    But this is the first time both companies have decided to
introduce something that will immediately exclude boys.;    Ziegler says video
game demographics are the reason. Nintendo has sold about 30 million game
systems, Ziegler said, and the 6- to 11-year-old market accounts for about 7
percent of that. While it's only a small fraction, she said that's up from 3
percent in 1988.;    Capcom plans to bring out its Little Mermaid game in
June. Suggested retail will be $44.95.;    Barbie is scheduled to come out in
October. Suggested retail also will be $44.95.  </TEXT>
