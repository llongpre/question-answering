<TEXT>     Already, requests for the doll have come in to at least one local store --
Kay-Bee Toy and Hobby Shop in Newark's NewPark Mall. But employees there were
secretive about their plans to carry Hammer.;    "The company doesn't allow us
to talk to reporters," announced one, then another, as if they had memorized
the line in training. They referred the inquiry on this weighty matter to the
company's Lee, Mass., headquarters. There the word was that only Vice
President of Advertising Ken Cunniff could discuss Hammer, and he wasn't in.
They said he'd get back. He hasn't.;    No such security problem was
encountered at Karl's Toys and Hobbies at the Fremont Hub. Clerk Sonya Van
Sickle said she had not yet heard of the doll, but that the store probably
will carry it when it is available because it sells Barbie and Ken.;    The
new doll was unveiled at last month's toy fair in New York.;    Lisa German of
the Mattel Co., creator of the Barbie and Ken line, said Hammer was chosen as
Barbie's first celebrity friend "because he's sensational and his music
presents a positive image for children, in keeping with the Mattel image.";   
German said the Hammer doll will come in two versions, one wearing a gold
costume and the other wearing maroon. "There will also be several outfits
available," she said.;    The doll will cost about $25.;    Save up for the
children.; DOLLS, DOLLS, DOLLS: A survey of local stores revealed that the
likenesses of living people such as Hammer command a wide variety of prices
and are made of diverse materials. Joe Montana and Mark McGuire command top
dollar while Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Margaret Thatcher are cheap. They
are made of different stuff. The Gift Gallery in the Hub offers ceramic
Montanas and McGuires for between $60 and $125. The politicians, about the
same size but made of vinyl, go for $5.99 at the Petco Co. pet store, also at
the Hub. Montana and McGuire do not talk or make any sound, but the Reagan,
Bush and Thatcher dolls squeal when you or your dog squeezes them.; SHOOT YOUR
PETS: Speaking of dogs, pet owners can bring their dogs or cats to a low-cost
vaccination clinic from 4 to 5:30 p.m. Saturday at the Fremont Hub. Parasite
control and major vaccination will be available for $5 to $10 each. The clinic
will be held in the parking lot in front of Petco, near Safeway. The clinic is
sponsored by Petco and Pet Prevent-A-Care, a mobile vaccination clinic. For
more information, call (800) 339-4122.  </TEXT>
