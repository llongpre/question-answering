   Game players in Cuba can't play ``Monopoly'' legally, since
Premier Fidel Castro once ordered all known sets seized and
destroyed, saying it was ``symbolic of an imperialistic and
capitalistic system.''
   But Parker Brothers, which has sold over 100 million sets since
the game was introduced in l935, says the Soviet Union, which also
banned it, is now letting Russians mortgage little red hotels to
their hearts' content. The game, invented by a man named Charles B.
Darrow during a spell of unemployment in 1933, now is distributed
in 35 countries and in 19 languages.

   Silly Putty was invented accidentally in a General Electric
Company lab during World War II, when its scientists were trying to
develop synthetic rubber for the war effort.
   Besides providing an instant medium for fledgling sculptors,
this substance has been used to pick lint, clean typewriter keys,
level wobbly furniture, help the Apollo 8 astronauts fasten down
tools during weightless flight, and to take hand and foot prints of
the gorilla population at the Columbus, Ohio, Zoo. Its
manufacturer, Binney &amp; Smith, also says that New England Patriots
football team members squeeze Silly Putty to strengthen their hands
for catching passes.

   One of the oldest toys is the yo-yo, with origins in a primitive
weapon used by prehistoric Filipino hunters. The original version
had a sharp piece of flint attached to a long thong. If the
hunter's aim was poor, he could retrieve the weapon and try again.
   The yo-yo evolved as a court toy in 17th and 18th century France
and Spain; a painting of a nobleman holding a yo-yo hangs in the
Louvre in Paris.
   Playing with the yo-yo is a national sport in the Philippines
and is practiced around the world. Over a half a billion yo-yos
have been sold in the United States alone since they were
introduced commercially in the late 1920s, according to the
Flambeau Corporation-Duncan Toys.

   The Teddy Bear is a namesake of President Theodore Roosevelt and
originated in 1902, when the president refused to kill a bear that
his hunting party had captured and tied up for him to shoot.
Roosevelt said it would be unsportsmanlike to take advantage of the
defenseless animal.
   Publicity about the incident inspired a merchant, Morris
Michtom, to name two toy bears after the president and display them
in his shop window in Brooklyn, N.Y. According to authors Peggy and
Alan Bialosky in ``The Teddy Bear Catalog,'' Michtom received
presidential permission to market the stuffed toys under the name
``Teddy's Bears.'' The resulting success led Michtom to found the
Ideal Toy &amp; Novelty Co.

   Like a true waif, the original Raggedy Ann was a castoff found
in an attic and adopted by 8-year-old Marcella Gruelle in 1914.
   Her father, John Gruelle, a political cartoonist for the
Indianapolis News, drew a face for the stuffed, faceless doll, and
her mother, Myrtle, added a candy heart inscribed,``I love you.''
   To entertain his terminally-ill daughter, Gruelle made up
stories about Raggedy Ann. After Marcella died, he began writing
the stories as a memorial, with the first Raggedy Ann book
appearing in 1918. It later inspired the manufactured dolls, books,
TV shows, comics, movies and a Broadway musical.

   The game of tossing disks around in the air may go back before
history, but the legend of Frisbees is traceable to a story of some
Connecticut college students who made a sport of tossing empty pie
tins from Mother Frisbie's Pie Factory and yelling ``frisbie'' as
an alert to the flight of the plates.
   An entrepreneur named Fred Morrison took up the idea, selling
disks at state fairs. In the late 1940s, he sold the idea to
Wham-O, a toy company.

   That fashion plate, Barbie, reached her 30th birthday in 1989.
   Since she was introduced in 1959, the Barbie doll has had
numerous careers and lifestyles _ a model, ``flower child,'' doctor
and astronaut. Named after the daughter of the inventors, Ruth and
Elliot Handler, Barbie is the best-selling and possibly best-known
fashion doll in history.
   More than 500 million dolls representing Barbie and her clan
have been sold, and Mattel Toys, which makes Barbie, says it sells
over 20 million Barbie fashions each year.

   The Flexible Flyer, the classic snow sled for children, is 100
years old this year _ a creation growing out of a business
necessity.
   A Pennsylvania farm equipment manufacturer, Samuel Leeds Allen,
invented it to occupy his factory workers during the off-season
months to keep them from leaving for other jobs.

   According to market research by Binney &amp; Smith, the smell of
Crayola Crayons is among the scents most recognized by American
adults, along with coffee and peanut butter.
   Their research also indicates that 65 percent of children in the
United States ages 2 to 7 color or draw at least once a day, for an
average of 27 minutes.
   Alice Stead Binney coined the Crayola tradename for her husband
Edwin's crayons in 1903. It derives from the French word ``craie,''
for colored chalk, and ``oleaginous,'' or oily.
