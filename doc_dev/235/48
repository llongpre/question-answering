<TEXT>     The "Happy to be Me" doll introduced Monday has big feet and short legs.
And though not exactly dumpy, she's a bit hippier and has a slightly thicker
waistline.;    The doll's proportions reflect someone whose measurements are
36-27-38 rather than 36-18-33, said Cathy Meredig, the doll's creator.;   
"The 'Happy to be Me' doll represents the end of the unhealthy fairy tale
which implies that you have to be thin and sexy with expensive clothes and
cars to be happy," said Meredig, founder of High Self-Esteem Toys Corp.;   
"By age 5 or 6 girls are concerned about body image," said Meredig. "By
puberty, girls are dieting and developing eating disorders to counteract
womanhood's natural body changes."  </TEXT>
