<LEADPARA>  KITTY Black Perkins has her own ideas about dress-for-success: Make it pink
and bouffant, and the more glitter the better.;    For 14 years, she has been
fashion designer to the ultimate material girl, Barbie. And one thing she's
learned about the little girls who own all those little dolls is that they
think Barbie is pretty in pink.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Black Perkins, who is principal designer for Mattel Toys' fashion dolls,
works out of a studio in a top-secret design center in El Segundo. Each year
she creates 100 fashions for Barbie, the company's billion-dollar baby.;   
Picking up a blond Barbie swathed in pink, Black Perkins with a gentle rip of
Velcro removes a petal overskirt from Barbie's costume-ball gown. Holding it
to her face, she demonstrates how the overskirt doubles as a costume mask for
Barbie's owners.;    "Barbie's clothes are designed to have a lot of play
value," she explains.;    She holds up another Barbie. This one is wearing a
ruffled pink overskirt that, detached and reattached as a hem flounce,
converts a short gown to long. Or, Barbie can toss aside the ruffles on her
pretty white apron and "she's ready to cook.";    Fantasy wardrobe;  If most
of those little girls who own a Barbie -- and most are little girls -- have
never seen their mothers in either pink flounces or a frilly apron, never
mind. Barbie doesn't concern herself with criticisms from feminists that she
is a bimbo, a shop-till-you-drop airhead, a Barbie doll, if you will.;   
"This is not the way adults dress, and it's not the way they're going to dress
as adults," acknowledges Mattel spokeswoman Donna Gibbs. But, she adds, "They
live reality. They want to play fantasy.";    "If it's pretty," Black Perkins
says, "little girls want it." (If it's orange, or green, they probably won't,
she has found.);    Black Perkins did not set out to become designer to the
superstar of toyland. Growing up in South Carolina, she says, "I never had a
Barbie doll." She was 28 before she ever saw a Barbie. That was one fateful
day in the summer of 1976 when she answered a newspaper ad placed by Mattel.; 
  During that job interview -- to which she brought six years' experience
designing clothes for real people -- she was asked to take a Barbie home and
to bring her back in a week wearing a Black Perkins creation.;    What she
created was a floral print voile jumpsuit with full, tiered legs and puff
sleeves and matching wide-brimmed hat. "Really stylish," she recalled, "almost
like a garden party outfit.";    That jumpsuit never went into production, but
it got her the job. Black Perkins was incredulous -- "I couldn't believe they
actually paid people to do that.";    Right off, there were a few adjustments
to be made. As a student at Los Angeles Trade Technical College and later as a
designer for both junior and couture houses in Los Angeles, Black Perkins had
never created for a mannequin only 11 1/2 inches tall. (For the record, Barbie
has a 3 1/2-inch waist, a 5 1/2-inch bust and 5-inch hips.);    Although there
are seven other Barbie costume designers, and eight more who create her
accessories, Black Perkins designs about a fifth of what goes into Barbie's
bulging closets. She scours magazines, snoops through stores, goes to couture
shows in Europe.;    Although Black Perkins does buy on the open market,
increasingly fabrics are custom-spun at Mattel facilities in the Far East,
Europe and Mexico, where the doll and clothes are made.;    Although
seamstresses can fashion two bouffant skirts and 20 bodices for Barbie gowns
out of a mere eighth of a yard of fabric, 75 million yards of fabric have gone
into Barbie fashions over the years.;    The clothes for Barbie and Ken are
unisize, to fit all 11 male and female dolls in the Mattel fashion group.;   
On the conference table in front of Black Perkins stands Christie, Barbie's
black friend who was introduced in 1968. She wears a white lace bridal gown
with a tiny waist, big sleeves and detachable bridal bouquet.;    Christie is
a beautiful "bride," but, in designing for Barbie and boyfriend Ken and
assorted kith and kin, Black Perkins never loses sight of the fact that Barbie
is the star, "always.";    Annual wedding gown;  Barbie gets a new bridal gown
each year, and each year it's her top-selling fashion, with more than 5
million gowns sold. Of course, Black Perkins says, "It doesn't mean Barbie is
getting married. It just means she's dreaming about it." Barbie will never get
married. That would spoil the fantasy.;    Barbie is big business. In 1959 --
the year the doll was introduced -- Mattel sold 351,000 Barbies at $3 retail.
The company estimates sales of 600 million Barbies in 1990.;    A very basic
Barbie, with only undergarments, sells today for $6 or less. But Mattel
selling Barbie dolls is like Eveready selling flashlights. Flashlights require
batteries. Barbie requires clothes. Lots of clothes. To date, Barbie owners
have bought 250 million units of Barbie clothes and accessories. A lame gown
from Barbie's haute couture "private collection" may carry an $8 price tag,
but most are in the $3 to $4 range.;    The Barbie phenomenon has fascinated
psychologists and other observers of the popular culture. Black Perkins has
her own theory. When her 6-year-old daughter, Erika Nicole Perkins, plays with
Barbie, she explains, "She's in control. I'm still in control of what she's
wearing, but Barbie is hers."  </TEXT>
