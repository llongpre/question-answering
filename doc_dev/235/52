   Baby dolls that dirty their diapers and a
30-something Barbie show toymakers aren't taking many chances this
year with costly creations that must compete with video games in a
notoriously fickle industry.
   Analysts and executives say the multibillion dollar business is
largely sticking with the tried and true while supplementing
lineups with new additions that have built-in insurance, because
they are based on film characters, entertainers or existing toys
with proven popularity.
   ``There are people in the industry who are saying that
creativity is going down,'' says Gerald V. Cleary, president of the
Tonka products division of Tonka Corp. ``To some degree there may
be some truth to that. I think the reason for it is the risk
associated with product launches.''
   The old classics and newcomers will be competing for attention
when the toy industry hosts its annual bash beginning Monday. The
10-day extravaganza draws buyers worldwide who hope to spot the
next big craze _ or at least the probable sellers.
   Familiar faces in the form of Barbie, G.I. Joe plus other widely
known dolls and action figures will get prominent billing.
Old-timers Life and Monopoly will share the game spotlight with
newer entries, such as one that made a splash last year, Shark
Attack.
   Hype ranging from a Fifth Avene parade of Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles to appearances by real-life superstars are some of the
weapons toymakers are using to outdo each other in generating
publicity.
   Despite the high jinks and hyperbole, industry analysts predict
a ho-hum year in toyland.
   Sales in the $13 billion industry _ excluding the wildly
successful video game segment _ rose about 5 percent in 1989, says
the Toy Manufacturers of America Inc., sponsor of the 87th Annual
American International Toy Fair. The trade group will release
official figures the first day of the show, which features more
than 1,100 exhibitors.
   ``I think 1990 will continue the trend that began in 1987 of
conservatism,'' said Gary M. Jacobson, a toy analyst at Kidder
Peabody &amp; Co. ``I think industry revenues will be up modestly in
1990. I look to 1991 and the decline of video to free up some
dollars for traditional toys.''
   Nintendo still reigns among systems that turn televisions into
game screens. But a more sophisticated and expensive machine,
Genesis from rival Sega, did well over the holidays, indicating the
market hasn't peaked.
   New software titles will be introduced aimed at keeping the
video game business booming. Sega provided previews of one starring
Michael Jackson that inserts slick dance moves into a game plot.
   Analyst Paul Valentine of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. says themes of
recent years will be repeated and embellished. Miniatures, dolls,
stuffed animals, and video-game accessories are categories of
concentration. Toys for preschoolers _ too young for Nintendo _
will be emphasized.
   Dolls will proliferate. They'll range from high-tech babies who
eat and cry to Hasbro Inc.'s Baby Uh-Oh, who wets herself after a
bottle-feeding and even suffers simulated diaper rash.
   High-fashion model dolls resemble the real thing. Matchbox Toys'
bevy of Christie Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs and Beverly Johnson dolls
may put a few worry wrinkles in 31-year-old Barbie's brow.
   A strong 1990 contender could be Tyco Toys Inc.'s $45 My Pretty
Ballerina, said to be capable of toe dancing, even executing an
arabesque or pirouette. Tyco's Oopsie Daisy crawled and stumbled
her way to stardom last year.
   Small has been beautiful for the balance sheets of some
manufacturers, particularly Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. which is
extending its Mico Machines line that has been racing ahead of
Mattel Inc.'s Hot Wheels and Matchbox's vehicles.
   Galoob's success with miniatures has inspired others to downsize
their toys. Hasbro, for example, has decided to offer petite
versions of its famous My Little Pony herd.
   Some toymakers are banking on licensing agreements as tickets to
financial rewards. Hasbro, the country's biggest toy company,
already announced its agreement with the pop music group New Kids
on the Block. The quintet teeny-bopper sensation is spawning dolls,
puzzles and other items.
   By going after a deal with a hot group, Hasbro showed gumption _
something the toy industry must have more of if it intends to
regain market share gobbled up by video games and other competitors
for toy dollars, analysts say.
   ``I think the traditional U.S. manufacturers are going to have
to become aggressive to make inroads against video and to stimulate
sales,'' Jacobson of Kidder Peabody says.
   Lawrence Bernstein, president of Hasbro's toy division, says the
company is pursuing a new strategy: ``We will be far more
aggressive in our approach to new products than we have been in the
past.''
   For years, toy manufacturers have been criticized for playing it
too safe while waiting for the videogame fad to fade, which in some
respects seems to be a self-perpetuating problem.
   The rising cost of creating new offerings and plugging them with
expensive TV commercials has made toymakers conservative. But
retailers, who obviously want to stock winners, typically prefer to
order toys promoted on TV.
   Nonetheless, companies willing to take risks can make a killing
if their toys catch on. Playmates Toys Inc. proved that with the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the third hottest selling toy in 1989
after Nintendo and Mattel's Barbie.
   About two dozen more turtles, new enemies and accessories will
come out in 1990 and probably will get a boost this Easter from the
film starring live actors.
   Playmates, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Playmates Holdings
Ltd., has done so well with the turtles, which are based on a
comic, that it was able to land what is expected to be a lucrative
license. It won the rights to action figures based on the Dick
Tracy movie from Walt Disney Studios starring Warren Beatty and
Madonna. The film opens June 15.
   Richard Sallis, senior vice president for Playmates, recalls
that when the idea for the turtle figures came up the company
jumped on it despite the risk of a flop.
   ``I looked at the market four years ago and felt a lot of people
weren't doing anything. They weren't taking any chances,'' he said.
``When people aren't doing anything there are a lot of
opportunities.''
