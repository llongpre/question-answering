<LEADPARA>  THE HOLIDAY decorating season is just beginning, but for originality it'll be
hard to beat a Christmas tree dressed to the nines with more than 75 Barbies
in evening gowns.;   Keeping with the bubble-gum pink theme for Mattel Inc.'s
line of Barbie doll products, New York decorator Richard Des Jardins added
pink tulle bows to the boughs.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He also strung miniature lights on the tree, which was the centerpiece of a
promotional event staged by the J.C. Penney Co. in New York.;   If the idea of
a unique tree appeals, but Barbie dolls aren't your cup of tea, experiment
with other novelty items.;   Souvenir umbrellas;   Nicholas Politis, Des
Jardins' partner, suggests paper umbrellas. The little toothpick novelties
usually served with tropical drinks at Polynesian restaurants are colorful so
they stand out against the tree boughs.;   They're also light and prickly so
they easily stay in place. And they're cheap enough to be used with abandon.
He says a gross (144) costs about $12 at a restaurant supply house.;   "The
umbrellas are especially easy to place because of the way they are made,"
Politis says. "Just open them and tuck them in.";   Gambling on a look;  
Other inexpensive trimmings Politis and Des Jardins have dreamed up are
playing cards, dice and gambling chips for a casino tree and miniature plastic
animals, cowboys and Indians for a Wild West theme.;   Decorating, however,
requires patience and additional underpinnings to make the doodads stay put.; 
 Politis says fishing line and spray glue are ideal. To clothe mundane
novelties in the glamour of the season, he adds glitter.;   "What's important
in decorating any tree is to have a strong theme and to vary the elements in
terms of size or shape or both," he says.;   At the J.C. Penney gala, New York
party planner Valorie Hart extended the Barbie theme from Des Jardins' tree to
the table centerpieces.;   She mixed Barbie "environments" such as the teen
queen's pink Ferrari, dream house and bedroom with seasonal greens, garlands
with tiny stars, pink Christmas balls and tulle puffs.;   The puffs were made
by pleating a 4-inch square and tying it in the middle with a twist closure.; 
 Using the same basic idea, a novice can recycle collectibles like toys, teddy
bears and hats for unusual holiday table decorations, Hart says.;   Start with
a base of real or artificial seasonal greens such as ivy, pine boughs or
boxwood or a soft fabric that can be puddled on the table.;   Arrange the
central item on the plant material or fabric. Add decor to your taste -- dried
plant material, a pomegranate, pine cones, Christmas balls and garlands,
rearranging the display until you achieve an effect you like.;   Hart often
adds a large flower, such as an amaryllis.;   Battery-powered mini-lights add
an extra dimension to the arrangement.;   The lights, sold with holiday
decorations in department and specialty stores, usually last about six hours
before they need a new battery.;   In an economy which needs recharging as
much as the battery-powered toys from last Christmas, using recycled items or
making your own decorations seems to be the right game plan.;   New York
decorator Mary Meehan suggests letting the kids make some ornaments. Clear
plastic or plastic foam balls, glue and glitter are an easy start, she says.
Draw the designs, spread them with glue and sprinkle the glued surfaces with
glitter.;   Homemade holiday decorations can be used in the traditional spaces
as well as other rooms such as a child's bedroom or kitchen, Meehan says.;  
For a child's room, let him use home-made or store-bought decorations. Garland
a blackboard or cabinet; set up a creche in a bookcase or use stuffed animals
and dolls to arrange a doll's picnic at a small play table.;   Ribbon is a
safe and inexpensive decorating tool, Meehan says. She saves red and green
velvet ribbon to reuse each season. She festoons a tree with ready-made bows
and hangs Christmas balls and ribbons from a chandelier over her dining
table.;   For those just beginning to amass holiday decor, she advises
starting with ribbon. It's plentiful, versatile and cheap.;   "Ready-made bows
come 20 or so to a package and can be used to ornament tree and furniture,"
she says. "You can do a lot with ribbon."  </TEXT>
