   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Mattel Inc. fired off an
astonishingly early shot at the holiday shopping season by
launching a joint promotion with McDonald's Corp. tied to the
fast-food firm's popular Happy Meals for children.
   The toy maker is offering free miniature Barbie dolls and
limited-edition Hot Wheels die-cast cars with each McDonald's
Happy Meal, along with $1 to $2 coupons on Barbie and Hot
Wheels products. Although advertising for the August
promotion doesn't have a holiday theme, Mattel hopes the
tie-in will raise awareness of the core brands in parents'
minds as the company heads into its crucial selling season.

   "More than 90% of the kids in our target age group will
visit McDonald's during the month of August," said Richard De
Herder, Mattel's vice president for consumer promotions.
   Last year, Mattel linked up with Coca-Cola Co. for a huge
toy coupon promotion in November that persuaded
recession-battered consumers to buy toys they might otherwise
have forgone. Analysts said this year's campaign should help
boost Mattel's domestic sales in the face of continuing
weakness in the economy. "Sales of toys overall have been
lousy," said John G. Taylor, an analyst with L.H. Alton &amp; Co.
"This should help Mattel keep its leading edge."
   For McDonald's, the promotion offers a distinctive element
in the midst of a relentless fast-food price war. Joseph
Doyle, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., said
Happy Meals have continued to sell well even though overall
sales have been sluggish.
