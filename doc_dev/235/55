   Look under Christmas trees across the country
this year, and you'll find packages with the name Nintendo waiting
for millions of children.
   The toy industry has its first mega-hit in two years in the
Japanese-made video game. But there are a lot of smaller, home-grown
hits as well, with familiar names like Barbie, G.I. Joe and Real
Ghostbusters leading the pack.
   Nintendo has surged to the forefront of the toy industry,
although it hasn't created the hysteria that Cabbage Patch Kids did
in the mid-1980s, when some stores had several near-riots as parents
fought over the dolls that were in short supply.
   But even without shoving matches among prospective buyers, the
video game is expected to rack up a phenomenal $1.7 billion in U.S.
sales for 1988, more than double the $800 million it had last year.
By comparison, Coleco Industries Inc.'s Cabbage Patch Kids did $600
million in 1985, their peak year.
   The toy industry as a whole is expecting sales to run about even
or slightly ahead of last year's $12.5 billion, according to the Toy
Manufacturers of America, a trade group. The lion's share of that
business is done at Christmas.
   This holiday season, several Nintendo games are among the
``must-have'' toys: Super Mario Brothers II, Zelda II and Double
Dragon.
   But industry watchers caution consumers to shop early, because
supplies of the chips needed to make the game cartridges have been
tight. Rick Anguilla, editor of the trade newspaper Toy &amp; Hobby
World, predicted, ``You can count on plenty of shortages for
Nintendo softwear.''
   Nintendo represents the first major hit in the toy industry since
Worlds of Wonder Inc.'s Lazer Tag in 1986. The video game also was
the standout last year, when the rest of the industry was in a slump.
   Nintendo's success has given the Japanese company a massive 85
percent share of the video game market, up from 70 percent at end of
1987, Anguilla estimated.
   The company's sales have come at the expense of U.S.-marketed
video games, such as Mattel Inc.'s Sega and Atari Corp.'s video
system. As a result, Hasbro Inc. recently announced it was
discontinuing its Nemo video game.
   Other toy companies, such as LJN, decided against competing with
Nintendo, and instead are producing Nintendo softwear under
licensing agreements, said Anguilla, who commented, ``If you can't
beat 'em, join 'em.''
   The Japanese import was one of the few high-tech items to succeed
in 1987. Consumers spent millions of dollars on Nintendo, but they
shunned other high-priced electronic toys in favor of dolls, board
games and preschool items like play food.
   Seeing this trend, manufacturers put greater emphasis in 1988 on
these toys, which cost less to produce and are more profitable.
   The U.S. companies also gave up their dependence on action
figures _ superheroes, aliens and robots _ tied to television shows.
The toy makers helped produce the shows, but when the segment
declined, they got out of the entertainment business, which had been
another expensive proposition.
   ``A lot of manufacturers out there are getting back to what they
do best, making toys,'' Anguilla said.
   Among the casualties in the action figure segment was Hasbro's
Inhumanoids.
   While the strategy of marketing figures with a TV show is fading,
television tie-ins are not completely dead. Universal-Matchbox's
talking Pee-Wee Herman doll and Kenner-Parker Toys' Real
Ghostbusters are among the TV figures that remain big sellers,
according to Angela Bourdon, a spokeswoman for Toys R Us Inc., the
nation's largest toy store chain.
   Other action figures that are popular are Kenner-Parker's
Starting Lineup, which is based on real-life athletes, and
Playmate's Mutant Ninja Turtles.
   G.I. Joe, Hasbro's military action figure and a perennial
favorite, also continues to thrive.
   Other big sellers among boys' toys are radio-controlled cars; Hot
Wheels by Mattel; and Micro Machines, small cars and trucks produced
by Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.
   Micro Machines have helped Galoob recover from its 1987 slump,
when the company _ like many other toy manufacturers _ over-invested
in expensive high-tech failures.
   For girls, Mattel's Barbie is expected to have her best year ever
as she approaches the grand old age of 30.
   Some newer entries in the doll market are also expected to have a
good season. Those cited by Anguilla and Ms. Bourdon included Lewis
Galoob's Bouncin' Babies, 7-inch-tall, battery-operated dolls;
Hasbro's Dolly Surprise, which has hair that grows; and Mattel's
Little Miss Makeup.
   ``Dolls are going to be a monster category,'' Anguilla predicted.
   Play food _ those miniature cans of soup and vegetables _ was a
surprise hit last year and continues strong in 1988.
   Fisher-Price's Fun With Food, which led the preschool segment in
1987, is doing well again this year. The company has extended the
line to include its Magic Scan Checkout, a pretend supermarket
checkout counter that Ms. Bourdon labeled a big seller at Toys R Us.
   Among board games, Pictionary by Games Gang Ltd. and its
counterpart from Hasbro's Milton Bradley line, called Win, Lose or
Draw, are expected to remain big sellers.
   Securities analysts say the toy industry's strategy shift, plus
extensive cost-cutting among the big U.S. firms, is returning the
business to profitability. Last year, all the major companies except
Hasbro ended up in the red.
   ``In 1988 you've seen these companies stabilize and build a
foundation for future growth,'' said Paul Valentine, an analyst with
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. ``You're going to see a real resurgence by
the American companies.''
