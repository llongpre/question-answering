   Mattel Inc. said fourth-quarter net income more than
doubled to a record $29.3 million, or 46 cents a share,
pushing fullyear profit and sales to record levels for the
third consecutive year.
   Quarterly profit a year earlier was $14.7 million, or 23
cents a share, adjusted for a 5-for-4 stock split paid in
November. Sales spurted 20% to a record $513.6 million from
$428.3 million.

   The outlook is for continued growth, said John Amerman,
chairman and chief executive officer, while preparing for the
Toy Fair next week in New York. While the company doesn't
report monthly results, he said: "We're up and running in
January. {Sales} volume increased substantially above the
20%" sales increase achieved in the 1991 fourth quarter.
   Despite the strong profit report, shares of the El
Segundo, Calif., toy maker were quoted at $33.125, down 75
cents, on turnover of 1.2 million shares in late New York
Stock Exchange trading. The shares hit a 52-week high of $34
on Tuesday.
   The results were "slightly light but for reasons that
don't bother me," said Thomas Kully, a toy analyst at William
Blair &amp; Co. While operating profit was on target with his
number, taxes and advertising were a tad higher than he
expected. Sales were between $25 million and $30 million
higher than his forecast.
   For all of 1991, profit rose 24% to $112.8 million, or
$1.77 a share, from $91.2 million, or $1.44 a share, in 1990,
when profit was reduced by a $5.2 million charge for debt
retirement. Sales rose 10% to $1.62 billion from $1.47
billion. Mr. Kully expects 1992 profit to reach $2.25 a fully
diluted share vs. $1.81 a fully diluted share last year,
excluding the charge.
   Barbie, which accounted for half the toy maker's sales
last year, will continue to lead the way in 1992, Mr. Amerman
said. Barbie sales rose 14% in 1991 to $840 million from $740
million in 1990. Sales of Barbie products have been growing
at an average annual rate of 18% for the past four years. "If
you do the math and add 18%, we'd have a billion dollar
Barbie this year, although it could be 1993 before we reach
that figure," Mr. Amerman said.
   A series of new license agreements and acquisitions will
take Mattel into several new toy categories this year,
including plush toys, board games and activity games. "We
will see huge growth in plush," Mr. Amerman said.
   Last year, retailers under-ordered toys from the
re-released Disney animated film 101 Dalmatians, which turned
out to be a hit. This year, retailers "realize that the
Disney Classics" line that Mattel licenses "is a big winner .
. . and they have been buying heavily such characters as
Bambi and Pinnochio," Mr. Amerman said.
   He expects Mattel to see "five-times growth," or about $75
million in sales from board games this year, a major new
category for Mattel. In the activity toy area, he expects
sales from Aviva to double from $15 million last year. Aviva,
purchased last year, makes sports toys and equipment for
children.
