Barry Kieselstein-Cord is becoming the Paul Newman of the fashion industry. The 
New York-based jewelry designer, who has a boutique in Neiman Marcus Beverly 
Hills, has formed a partnership with Dallas-based car enthusiast David Bell to 
back "Team Kieselstein-Cord." Consisting of five Shelby racing cars and two 
professional drivers, the team will compete for the first time in a Southern 
Vintage Racing Assn. race at Moroso Park near Palm Beach, March 9-11. For the 
record, Kieselstein-Cord owns 13 cars, including a Porsche 911 and a Mercedes 
6.9.

BOB AND BARBIE: Mattel's Barbie has really gone Hollywood. Bob Mackie, best 
known as Cher's costume designer, has created a special Collectors' Edition 
Barbie. He's zipped up the world's most famous fashion doll in a gold lame, 
body-hugging gown that bares the midriff and swathed her in a white marabou 
stole. Asked if dressing Barbie was like dressing any of his long list of 
celebrity clients, Mackie mused: "She's a combination of all the best parts." 
This first Collectors' Edition Barbie from Mattel will be available in June at 
a suggested retail price of $120.

JACKET CODE: Bruce Springsteen, Bruce Willis, Cleavon Little, Emilio Estevez 
and Mickey Rourke all showed up wearing their leather jackets one recent night 
at the China Club. Do you suppose they called each other first? Rod Stewart 
bucked the trend, suited in pinstripes and a white tux shirt.

SAFARI SO GOOD: Other designers hand out tote bags when they introduce a new 
fragrance. Not so Ralph Lauren. His new $300-an-ounce Safari fragrance is part 
of an entire fantasy theme that is right out of Africa. Lauren has designed a 
line of ready-to-wear and home furnishings to complement the new scent -- the 
whole package, clothes, furnishings and fragrance is called the Safari 
Collection. Even the Polo Ralph Lauren store on Rodeo Drive has been 
transformed: The decor of leather riding boots and saddles has given way to 
leather riding boots, travel trunks and silver tea services.

FASHION STAT: A survey called "Profiles in Courtship," conducted by R. H. 
Bruskin Associates for Korbel Champagne, found the seventh most likely way to 
meet a mate is to go shopping.

FILLING A NEED WITH SOME STYLE: Dawn Wells (better known as Mary Ann on 
"Gilligan's Island") has designed a line of clothes for people who have 
difficulty dressing themselves because of handicaps or arthritis. Her garments, 
called the Wishing Well Collection, are made with full overlapping panels in 
the back that fasten with Velcro closures, replacing buttons, zippers and 
over-the-head entrances. In designing user-friendly garments, she has not 
forsaken style -- a bright red, double-breasted coat dress with black trim, a 
tuxedo-front dress in pastel colors and a panne velvet, mandarin-collar robe 
are just a few of the items in her mail order catalogue, available by calling 
(818) 840-6919.

WE'VE COME FOR YOUR DAUGHTERS: Strutting down the Paris runways are two models 
with decidedly conspicuous names -- Svetlana and Natasha. They are Soviet 
lasses signed with French modeling agency Glamour. "We plan to start scouting 
around the main cities in the Soviet Union to see who's out there for us," said 
Glamour President Jerome Bonouvreir, who plans to open a Moscow office in 
April. He got a well-manicured toe-hold on the market through Pierre Cardin, 
who is known for his longstanding manufacturing relationship with the Soviet 
Union.
