<LEADPARA>  Hey, all you fill-in-the-blank Rembrandts. It's time to think about trading
your easel for a color video monitor and your paintbrush for a "mouse" now
that the paint-by-number kit has been computerized.;   Craft House Corp., the
Toledo-based firm that dominates what there is of the paint-by-number business
worldwide, has just introduced two new paint-by-numberish IBM-compatible
software products aimed at children.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Both programs let users color drawings outlined on a computer screen. Users
pick from 120 colors displayed in an on-screen palette, then point and click a
mouse device at the segment of the picture they want to paint.;   Barbie PC
Fashion Design and Color, which will retail for $29.95, lets users pose
Mattel's eternally famous fashion doll in one of three backdrops -- at the
beach, out on the town or in a fashion show. For each occasion, the user can
dress Barbie in a wide variety of outfits.;   And we do mean wide. According
to Craft House marketing vice president Dan Johns, there are more than 2
billion possible combinations of clothes, hairstyles, shoes and accessories
for the on-screen Barbie.;   Craft House's other new software product, The
Columbus Discovers America PC Coloring program, for $14.95, lets kids paint 10
scenes of Christopher Columbus' voyages to the New World. Each scene looks
like a page from a coloring book.;   Johns said the Columbus story may be the
first of a series with educational coloring book themes.;   In both programs,
the user may opt to paint the picture according to suggested numbers, which
correspond to colors in the on-screen palette, or the user may improvise. The
user can save his or her designs for later viewing, though the programs will
not print finished work.;   These new products also befit the shortened
attention spans of the television age. A conventional paint-by-number picture
takes from one evening to a week to complete, but it's possible to finish
painting a scene in the Barbie or Columbus programs in about an hour.;  
Johns, a former plastic model kit designer and ex-Lionel Trains executive,
said Craft House hopes the new products will help increase its penetration of
the youth market. He said the bulk of paint-by-numbers users are in their 50s
and beyond.;   Johns said future paint-by-number software products may be
aimed at adults, perhaps letting them paint the cars or homes of their dreams
in whatever shades they like or according to a prescribed set of hues.  </TEXT>
