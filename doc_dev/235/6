   (During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

   BARBIE, A WELL-GROOMED PLATINUM BLONDE standing less than a foot tall, arrived in 1959 as toylands first "fashion doll." 
Her debut was greeted with skepticism. 
No child (or, more importantly, no parent) would buy a full-fashioned doll, the experts said. 
Last Year, Barbie and her well-dressed playmates produced more than $450 million for Mattel Inc. of California. 
In 30 years, children have bought and dressed more than 500 million of them. 
Mattel figures that 90% of girls aged 3 to 11 own at least one Barbie. 

   Ruth Handler, whose husband, Elliott, had started Mattel, created Barbie, naming her after their daughter Barbara. 
When Barbie caught on (351,000 were sold the first year at $3 a copy) Mrs. Handler produced Barbie's friend Ken, named for their son, a gallery of companions and a stable of pets and favorite cars (the latest, a Ferrari). 

   Barbie, who began as a teen-age fashion model, has appeared as a ballerina, a nurse, a flight attendant, an astronaut, a candy striper, a TV newscaster and a rock star. 
Each role, of course, meant a fresh wardrobe. 
Mattel sells some 20 million new outfits a year at $1 to $8 apiece. 

   The Handlers themselves did not fare quite as well. 
In 1974, the Securities and Exchange Commission descended on the company, charging that it had been reporting false earnings to keep the stock price high. 
The Handlers were forced out as directors and co-chairmen (but not as stockholders) and left saying they "deeply regretted" any damage. 

   But Ruth Handler hadn't lost her creative touch. 
After undergoing a mastectomy in 1970, she found that no one was producing suitable prostheses. 
So she designed her own, called "Nearly Me," and thus began another successful business. 

   And doll makers didn't forget the Handlers. 
This year they were inducted into the toy industry's Hall of Fame at a New York gala.
