   Will Zen Intergalactic Ninja Warrior survive against the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
   Toy retailers will ponder these questions as an estimated
12,000 buyers -- seeking to restock depleted store shelves --
pore over 5,000 new toys at the annual American International
Toy Fair in New York next week.
   Amid the uncertainty, one thing is clear: The mood at the
two-week show will be merry. Despite the recession, many toys
were sold out weeks before Christmas in 1991. And after five
years of flat sales, the industry is seeing its first real
uptick.
   "I can't remember as much optimism and buoyancy since
1987," says Sean McGowan, an analyst for Gerard, Klauer,
Mattison &amp; Co.
   The Toy Manufacturers Association estimates that toy
makers sold approximately $9.2 billion of products in 1991,
up about 5% from $8.8 billion in 1990. Says David Miller,
president of the association: "Interestingly, we're seeing
increases in just not the major manufacturers . . . but from
more than two-thirds of the 87 companies that report to us."
   Analysts note that manufacturers' sales in January were up
from a year ago, reflecting in part low inventory levels at
retail and foreshadowing more aggressive orders at Toy Fair.
"Toys "R" Us reduced their inventory by something like 15%
last year," notes John Taylor, an L.H. Alton &amp; Co. analyst.
"We're looking at some pentup demand."
   For the most part, though, exuberance won't be spawning
the extravagant experimentation of the 1980s, when electronic
toys became overnight hits -- and, just as quickly, expensive
flops. Caution remains the mainstay of the industry, whose
motto continues to be growth through diversification and
low-priced toys.
   "I think 1992 will be challenging for toy manufacturers
because of the economy not only in the U.S. but world-wide,"
says Alan Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive officer of
Hasbro Inc., the nation's largest toy maker, which like many
other makers is concentrating on toys for under $10.
   Nor is the industry's most recent success story Playmates
Toys Inc., maker of the Ninja Turtles, screaming "Cowabunga]"
Turtles sales declined to $300 million in 1991 from $400
million the previous year, say analysts, who are projecting
another decline of $100 million this year. Richard Sallis, a
Playmates vice president, doesn't quarrel with the estimates:
"We're staying with low prices, watching inventory and being
conservative."
   The decline in Ninja Turtles, combined with a leveling off
in the video-game business, has prompted toy manufacturers to
step up production of boys' toys. But that doesn't guarantee
exciting toys in the category. "About 26 new boys' action
figures were shown at Toy Fair last year," notes Jack
Chojnacki, co-president of Those Characters From Cleveland, a
toy-inventing unit of American Greetings Co. "But most are
being discontinued this year."
   This year, toy makers will unveil more than 26 new
action-figure lines. From Hasbro's Kenner unit comes Savage
Mondo Blitzers, warriors that roll on wheels and bear names
like Brains Not Included, Sewer Surfers and Butt Kickers.
Just Toys Inc. will do even better. The New York company
purchased a license to produce Zen Intergalactic Ninja
Warrior from Mark Freedman, chairman of Surge Licensing,
which discovered the Ninja Turtles buried in a comic book.
"Right now, I could retire and go fishing," says Mr.
Freedman. "But I want to see if I can do it again."
   Certain to stir some controversy will be Tyco Toys Inc.'s
Incredible Crash Dummies, made in the likeness of Vince and
Larry, the two dummies featured in the Public Service
Announcements on television promoting the wearing of seat
belts.
   Kids have two options of play. With seat belts on, the
dummies remain in one piece when the test cars (which are
part of the toy line) crash. But without seat belts, the
dummies fly through a collapsible windshield and their heads,
arms and legs come apart when they hit the ground.
   "Kids are always into what the industry calls `crash and
bash,'" says Richard Grey, Tyco's chairman. "Some customers
who have placed orders with us thought there might be some
controversy because there will be activists who will find
things to object to." But he argues, "The violence is done to
dummies, not humans."
   Tyco has high hopes for the line, expecting sales of $40
million to $50 million in 1991. That would better the
first-year sales of $23 million for the Ninja Turtles in
1988.
   Action figures will be crossing the thin pink line into
girls' toys this year, as well. Playmates is coming out with
Swans Crossing, a line patterned after a cast of characters
from a new TV soap opera by the same name for young girls.
   The queen of girls' toys is Barbie. Since 1987, the Mattel
doll's sales have grown at a compounded rate of 13%, notes
John Amerman, the company's chairman. The line accounted for
$840 million of the company's $1.62 billion in revenues in
1991, he says, and could likely reach the $1 billion mark in
a year or two.
   Mattel, the industry's leading doll maker, can expect
stiff competition from Tyco, a large part of whose growth in
the last three years has come from its girls' toys business.
The contest will heat up particularly in the baby and toddler
dolls, a category referred to in the industry as large dolls
-- 18 inches to 20 inches high.
   Analysts say the large-doll segment has grown from $60
million in 1987 to more than $300 million last year. Tyco
this year puts its skating California Roller Baby up against
Mattel's Baby Roller Blade. Both battery-operated dolls can
skate by moving their feet one at a time.
   Pregnancy is also "in" in toyland. Mattel's My Bundle
Baby, has a heartbeat and kicks, which can be felt when
clutched. And Hasbro has Puppy Surprise and Kitty Surprise.
Both carry three to five offspring each. The surprise is
finding out how many there are after each purchase.
   Helped by a real-life baby boom, makers of preschool toys
are having a boom of their own. The preschool toy business
last year grew between 12% and 14%, notes Jill Krutick, an
analyst for Salomon Bros. Inc.
   Pricing isn't as big an issue with many preschool toys,
analysts say. "Parents are entering their prime spending
years," notes Ms. Krutick. Hoping to reach that affluent
crowd, Rubbermaid Inc.'s Little Tikes unit offers a $70 Mini
Van that comes with a toy cordless phone.
   Manufacturers, though still conscious that the nation
isn't out the economic doldrums yet, are taking a few risks
with a limited number of higher-priced toys. For example, CAP
Toys Inc. will show its $90 Nolan Ryan Strike Zone Baseball,
a game whose main feature is a built-in "announcer." Pitch a
ball over the electronically wired plate and the broadcaster
not only calls the pitch but gives an account of whether it
was hit by the batter, where it landed or who caught it.
