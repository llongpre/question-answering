<LEADPARA>  BARBIE, that multitalented, eternally youthful scamp, is at it again.;    This
time, she's the heroine of a comic book. Make that two comic books, typical
for an overachiever who has succeeded at every career from astronaut to
ballerina.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     When is this babe going to start showing some age? She's worse than Dick
Clark.;    Barbie and I are roughly the same age; in the spirit of Barbie
perfectionism, I should point out that she's actually about eight months
older, though she has done a much better job of maintaining her girlish
figure.;    At 18, I used to spend my weekends shopping all day and dancing
all night. At 21, it was a breeze to cram for exams all night, then head for a
party immediately after the tests. At 25, I had no problem working all day,
then playing competitive softball and going out later for a victory
celebration.;    But my energy level has nose-dived. These days, I'm grouchy
if I don't get a full 8 1/2 hours of sleep. All I want to do at the end of the
day is go home and collapse in front of a fire built by someone else. I'm
pretty sure I couldn't get by without remote-control TV, and I'm not inclined
to make any dinner requiring more effort than opening a box.;    Granted, I'm
a lazy slug, but where does Barbie get off having enough energy and enthusiasm
to stop the C. Ment Corporation from turning a park into a parking lot, teach
us step-by-step how to "walk that Barbie walk" for exercise, dog-sit for one
friend and help cure another pal's case of wallflower-itis?;    And that's
only in the first Barbie book. The second comic, called Barbie Fashion,
features our heroine foiling a robbery of her fashion-designer friend's
clothing store, teaching readers how to make their own jewelry and jewelry
boxes and showing little sister Skipper how to get grape jelly stains out of a
white sweater.;    Barbie's white sweater, I might add, which Skipper wore
without permission. Did Barbie react like any real big sister would? Did her
eyes scrunch up and her lips curl? Did she lunge across the room with a
bloodcurdling shriek? Did she threaten to hang Skipper by her toes from the
roof of the house?;    Who are you kidding? Barbie, the very definition of
"Good Role Model," merely laughed and explained the sweater was "completely
washable and stain-resistant, so you can't ruin it." Then she washed it
herself.;    Being a little sister who did my share of washing (and ironing)
the clothes I wore without permission -- and let's be honest, what big sister
ever gives permission? -- I felt like throwing up.;    The comic books, which
sell for $1 each, also have a feature called "Career Quest." Barbie visits a
friend with an interesting job, like a fashion designer or a buyer, who
explains to Barbie (and her readers) what the job involves. Readers are also
encouraged to design outfits for Barbie and send their sketches to the
magazine.;    According to the press kit sent with the comics, Barbie has a
wardrobe of more than 6,000 outfits, including a Bob Mackie original. So what
does she need with designs from comic-book readers?;    This woman-doll is
picture-perfect pretty, with measurements that can only be achieved in real
life through extensive cosmetic surgery or starvation and legs that never end
(and she still wears high heels!), and she has never failed at anything in her
life. She's beautiful and smart, domestic and independent, savvy and nice.;   
What does this mean for the generation who grew up with the Barbie ideal? That
we'll never measure up, of course.;    Which leaves me with one question.;   
Do we really want to do this to our own daughters?  </TEXT>
