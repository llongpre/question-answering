<TEXT>     With their unblinking eyes and deep concentration you'd think the shark is
a serious threat instead of an inch-long graphic on the television screen.;   
In less than five minutes, the two 10-year-olds have become intensely involved
in this new Nintendo game called "The Little Mermaid." Both girls have taken
on the role of Ariel, the heroine of the Walt Disney animated hit movie of the
same name.;    This video game, based on the film's story line about a
mermaid, an evil undersea witch and a prince, is touted to be the first
specifically created for young girls. Its maker, and other Nintendo licensees,
are hoping to tap into a segment of the 60 million game players that has
virtually been ignored until now: the female population between the ages of 6
and 12.;    So far, "The Little Mermaid" and another game based on the Barbie
doll -- both scheduled to be on store shelves by August -- are the only two
girl-oriented games authorized by Nintendo, which lends its name to new games
developed by about 60 companies. If these two games prove to be hits with
little girls, Serena Heneghen, a spokeswoman for Nintendo, anticipates a heap
of new games will be developed with young females in mind.;    Industry
observers call "The Little Mermaid" a role-playing game because the child at
the controls becomes the mermaid, swimming through a series of danger-infested
segments (called worlds) to save her sea pals, captured by Ursula the witch.
Along the way, she dodges spiny urchins and hurls bubbles at the serpents and
poisonous fish who charge her way.;    "We think it's competitive but not in a
violent way," says Kathleen Watson, marketing director of Capcom USA, Inc.,
the Santa Clara company that created "The Little Mermaid" game for Nintendo.; 
  Games thus far -- and there are more than 400 -- have been geared toward
satisfying action-hungry adolescent boys, she explains. The strategies for the
girls' games are gentler.;    "Ariel proceeds along by gathering things like
sea shells and opening treasure chests," says Watson, "as opposed to hacking
and slashing her way through the worlds.";    Capcom anticipates that the
game's emphasis on "non-violent entertainment" will greatly appeal to little
girls -- even little girls like Shannon and Katie, who are telling each other
to kill, smash and zap the creatures that get in Ariel's way. The San Jose
cousins and their siblings recently were asked to test out the Nintendo
cartridge for the Mercury News.;    Although the feminine Ariel swims along
with auburn tresses flowing, it doesn't prevent her -- and the kids at the
control pad -- from aggressively plotting strategy and moving toward the goal
with much dodging, throwing and -- yes -- killing.;    "This game requires the
same skills as the other Nintendo games because the control pad puts a limit
on the kinds of commands and movements," explains Tim Dale, a member of Team
Nintendo, the company's professional players and trouble shooters. "The
difference is that the main character is a female that has a great deal of
appeal with girls.";    Not yet available for testing but scheduled to appear
about the same time as Ariel is a game sure to entice fashion-savvy girls. The
heroine? Barbie, of course.;    Designed by Hi-Tech Expressions in New York,
the Barbie game involves a dream that the doll has in which she floats through
the worlds acquiring clothing and accessories to get herself to the grand ball
in high style.;    "It's not confrontational at all: It's glamorous and
pretty," says Joan Ziegler, vice president of product acquisition and
marketing for the company. "When we saw a Toy and Hobby magazine rating
showing Nintendo as being the best-selling toy and Barbie in second place, we
felt very strongly that we could merge the two.";    The demographics on
primary players began to change about three years ago, according to Nintendo's
Heneghen. In 1985, the primary Nintendo users in a household were males from 8
to 15 years old. By 1988, one-fourth of the primary users were female.;   
Despite the growing number of female users, it was difficult to get away from
the deeply held notion that Nintendo was a boys' game, she says. Even today,
when the company's latest survey shows that 36 percent of Nintendo players are
female, game developers are just now zeroing in on the shifting demographics.;
   "It took us a while -- even though we've always known that girls enjoy
adventure and role-playing as much as boys," says Heneghen.;    Next on their
agenda is introducing similar girl-appeal cartridges for Game Boy, the
hand-held Nintendo system of which 42 percent of the primary users are
female.;    "We think it's popular with women and girls because it's small,
portable and you can cuddle up in a chair to play with it," says Heneghen.
"And most of the games are puzzle-type games women enjoy.";    A "smart move
capitalizing on a niche situation," is what David Rice calls the introduction
of these female-focused games.;    "Nintendo reached a saturation point and
needed to move toward a different direction," explains Rice, the executive
director of Vidion/International Association of Video in Washington D.C., an
organization that keeps members updated on industry trends and new video game
releases. "There have been unisex games, but no one had thought about
attracting little girls before now. You have to remember that (Nintendo) was
invented in a country that is very male-dominant.";    Ariel the mermaid
clearly captivates young girls like Shannon and Katie, but the character and
her cohorts in the movie and game also appealed to big brother Anthony
Capossele, 12, who was the only player skilled enough to progress through all
the worlds on his initial try.;    The younger vidkids, including Shannon's
sister Lindsay, 8, and brother Evan, 5, closely watched Anthony's movements on
the screen. They occasionally provided sound effects for Ariel -- making sea
lion noises, for instance, when she was forced to flop onto an ice floe.;   
"It's fun and challenging," said Anthony, not taking his eyes off the screen's
vivid images. "Boys would like it as much as girls, I think, because it's
pretty hard to try to figure out how to kill the bad guys."  </TEXT>
