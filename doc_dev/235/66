   Attention coupon junkies: the world's No. 2 toy maker is joining the users of discount certificates to ply its wares. 

   Mattel Inc. is preparing to flood the country with 582 million store-redeemable coupons this fall as the centerpiece of a new marketing campaign. 
The coupons offer discounts of $1 to $5 on toys including Barbie and other dolls, Hot Wheels Speed Shift 500 race sets, TV Play-Along Wheel of Fortune games, and a new line of Disney infant and preschool toys. 

   While Mattel says the effort will hardly be noticed in the annual total of 540 billion coupons distributed by U.S. retail businesses, the company believes it's the first time a toy maker has emphasized such a campaign in its marketing strategy. 
Generally, the biggest toy makers depend more heavily on early-morning television ads. 

   Mattel, based in Hawthorne, Calif., plans to continue that thrust, but it will also employ the coupon strategy to provide an economic incentive for parents to give in and buy. 

   "We're just adapting a tried and true technique to the toy business," says Robert Sansone, president of the Mattel USA unit, who joined the company last year after a 24-year career at that king of the coupons vendors, General Foods Corp. 

   The approach could well spread to competitors, according to analysts. 

   "Others will look to see if this works, and if it works, they'll follow," says Gary M. Jacobson, a toy analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. Mr. Jacobson suggests that the more-traditional rebates currently used in the business (which often involve mailing forms back to the manufacturer and waiting for a check) seem to hassle consumers, and that coupons could produce at least marginal sales increases for Mattel. 
Pawtuckett, R.I., based Hasbro Inc. is the world's largest toy company. 

   "It's succeeded with the fast food industry. 
I don't see why it won't succeed here," says Steven Eisenberg of Bear Stearns &amp; Co. 
The move at Mattel, he believes, is part of a drive to preserve a lead over rivals in some product areas while it tries to capture shelf space lost by troubled Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc., among other competitors. 

   Other analysts, though, stress that the coupon concept may need fine-tuning. 
"Barbie is red hot and Hot Wheels has emerged as one of the fastest selling toy lines in the country," says Paul Valentine of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., noting that parents always seem willing to pay a premium for the hottest toys. 
"I think they should focus promotions on slower moving products." 

   The coupons will go out next month and in November by direct mail to 70 million households. 
The packets offer four or five coupons, and provide rebates of $21 for customers spending a total of $176 on toys. 
Another part of the campaign is the issuance of coupons in supermarket tie-ins with some soft and fruit drink makers. 

   All this, says Mr. Sansone, is an attempt to advance Mattel's recent restructuring, which also involved some reduction in size. 

   "Costs are under control again" at a company whose high costs heavily penalized earnings in recent years, he says. 
"It's time to start building sales again," he added. 

   In the fiscal six months ended June 25, Mattel's net income more than doubled to $3.5 million, or seven cents a share, while sales fell 15% to $395.7 million. 

   The cost of the coupon project -- "significantly more than $5 million" he says -- won't keep Mattel from reducing overall advertising and promotion expenses to $174 million this calender year from $188.2 million last year.
