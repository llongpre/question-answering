   It's a retailer's dream _ a store opened in
time for the Christmas season, that customers flock to and that is
more successful than anyone's wildest expectations.
   A Disney fantasy for storeowners? Better than that _ it's a
Disney reality.
   The Walt Disney Co., which last year debuted three stores to
market clothing, mugs and other merchandise bearing the likeness of
Mickey Mouse and his friends, opened 10 more this year, aiming for
the big Christmas season.
   If the early returns are any indication, they will be enormously
profitable.
   Donna Moore, a vice president at the Disney stores, said the
three stores that opened in 1987 have had double-digit percentage
gains in sales over last year's results. By comparison, many of the
nation's biggest retailers have been struggling to eke out increases
of 3 percent.
   Disney anticipated the stores would be successful, but not that
successful. ``It's almost like we're pinching ourselves,'' Ms. Moore
said.
   ``We have a couple of winners that are far exceeding our
expectations,'' she added, citing the recently opened outlets at
Paramus Park Mall here and at Tysons Corner, Va., outside of
Washington.
   The other Disney stores are clustere to be the top sellers
this Christmas. The list, compiled by the trade newspaper Toy &amp;
Hobby World, is based on October toy sales.
   _Nintendo Entertainment System by Nintendo. The company is still
selling its console units to first-time buyers, but it will do big
business this season with Nintendo games, including Super Mario
Brothers II, Zelda II and Double Dragon.
   _Barbie, by Mattel Inc. The reigning queen of fashion dolls,
about to turn 30, is expected to have her biggest year ever. The
company is marketing a special holiday edition this year.
   _Micro Machines by Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. These tiny cars and
trucks are sold several to a package.
   _Pictionary by Games Gang Ltd. This board game is based on
charades, with players drawing their clues instead of acting them
out.
   _Real Ghostbusters by Kenner-Parker Toys, a division of Tonka
Corp. These action figures are based on the popular Saturday morning
cartoon show.
   _G.I. Joe by Hasbro Inc. Military action figures and vehicles
that have been best-sellers for years.
   _Win, Lose or Draw, by Hasbro's Milton Bradley line. Another
board game based on charades.
   _Hot Wheels by Mattel. Small cars and trucks sold individually.
   _Starting Lineup by Kenner-Parker. Baseball and football action
figures based on real-life sports stars.
   _Dolly Surprise by Hasbro. This doll features hair that grows
when its arm is raised.
