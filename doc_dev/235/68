   Mattel Inc. and Rollerblade Inc., a major maker of skates,
signed a world-wide licensing agreement to sell two doll
lines based on the popular sport. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Los Angeles-based Mattel will launch Baby Rollerblade, a
15-inch doll that skates on replicas of Rollerblade brand
skates, and a Rollerblade Barbie and friends line at a toy
industry trade show next month. The Baby Rollerblade doll,
which will retail for about $36, furthers the toy maker's
push into the large doll category.

   Rollerblade skates, introduced in 1980 as an off-season
training tool for hockey players, have a single blade-like
row of wheels and look something like a cross between
traditional roller skates and ice skates. Rollerblade, based
in Minneapolis, said the dolls will help introduce girls to
its new line of children's skates.
