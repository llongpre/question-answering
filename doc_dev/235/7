   On Anika Polzin's first trip outside her native
East Germany in November her parents bought her a Barbie doll.
   Now on her second excursion to the western world the
six-year-old is getting wined and dined _ make that milkshaked and
hamburgered _ by Barbie's corporate parents.
   Mattel Inc., manufacturer of the famous fashion doll, brought
Miss Polzin and her family over for a five-day holiday in New York.
They will be guests at a black-tie affair Mattel is hosting tonight
to mark the beginning of the annual American International Toy Fair
and to announce what the company is calling the ``Barbie Summit.''
   Patricia Wyatt, director of marketing for girls toys at Mattel,
said the company thought it was fitting to have Miss Polzin on hand
when they revealed plans for the event that is to be held each year
starting with the first three-day conference in New York during the
week of Nov. 19. Essay contests will be held for girls of varying
ages to compete to become ``delegates.''
   ``Through Barbie we want to bring children from around the world
together,'' Ms. Wyatt said, speaking in the almost reverential
tones Mattel people use in referring to a toy that has been a
must-have for many little girls since being introduced 31 years ago.
   Mattel reckons that enough Barbies have been sold in the doll's
lifetime that if placed head to toe they would circle the earth 3{
times. Sales of the dolls plus her entourage and their
accouterments exceeded $450 million in 1988 and accounted for 40
percent of Hawthorne, Calif.-based Mattel's total revenue.
   The summit will ``give children a forum to express their
viewpoints'' ... and ``help them share their different cultures
with one another,'' Ms. Wyatt said in an interview.
   A new Barbie Summit doll _ appropriately available in four
ethnic distinctions _ outfitted in a shimmering white ensemble will
debut at Toy Fair, an annual trade show. Proceeds from sales of the
doll will be placed in a Barbie Fund, which Mattel will donate to
children's charities.
   The towheaded Miss Polzin was tuckered out Friday afternoon from
a busy day of sightseeing, shopping and a visit to Rumpelmayer's
Restaurant, a favorite Manhattan watering hole with the young,
ice-cream eating set. But she handled an interview at her Waldorf
Astoria suite with admirable aplomb and smiled sweetly for
photographs.
   It was a picture of a beaming Anika clutching a new Barbie that
first attracted Mattel's attention.
   ``We were very moved by the photo,'' Ms. Wyatt said. ``It was
nice to know that Barbie transcended cultures.''
   The caption on the photo, which appeared in newspapers around
the world, gave her name and hometown, Schwanefeld, East Germany.
It said she was photographed after a day of western-style shopping
in Helmstedt, West Germany.
   Mattel's German affiliates easily tracked down Miss Polzin. Only
a few inquiries were needed to trace her in Schwanefeld, a tiny
village, population 270, a few miles from the border with West
Germany.
   Miss Polzin, wearing a new dress and complementing hot-pink
tights, said through an interpreter that she was enjoying her trip
to the United States.
   But signs of jet lag were still evident as she sat on a sofa
beside Minnie Mouse. She and her 10-year-old brother, Maik, and
parents, Eva and Inglof, who works for the East German railroad,
arrived late Thursday night from Frankfurt on a flight courtesy of
Lufthansa airlines.
   They already had been to the Statue of Liberty, and outings to
the Empire State Building, museums and, of course, FAO Schwarz were
planned.
