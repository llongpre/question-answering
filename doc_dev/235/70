   Barbie, the doll usually more occupied with
clothing and hairstyle decisions, didn't mean to upset anyone. But
now she stands accused by a Northwest logging group of promoting
the ``radical agenda'' of environmentalists.
   At issue was a Mattel Toys commercial in which Barbie asked her
young admirers how to make the world a better place. One
possibility, she suggested, was that ``We could keep the trees from
falling, keep the eagles soaring.''
   That drew the ire of the Oregon Lands Coalition, which charged
that Mattel and Barbie had pandered to a movement out to shut down
``the engines of this country'' and had exposed children to the
``preservationists' radical agenda.''
   The logging group, which lobbied Congress last year against
legislation aimed at protecting the northern spotted owl, also has
protested in letter-writing and telephone campaigns the
pro-environment products and activities of several other companies.
They include K-Mart, Canon Copiers, American Greeting Cards, Cotler
Manufacturing, Ralston Purina and Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   ``We've been known to activate 3,000 to 5,000 phone calls'' to
manufacturers and retailers, said Jackie Lang, spokeswoman for the
logging group. She said the coalition is part of a timber and
mining political action network that boasts 61,000 members.
   The group also has protested K-Mart's sale of ``Save the Trees''
shirts and helped persuade Cotler to discontinue a children's
clothing line which carried tags that read: ``Environmental
Protection Department. Absolutely No Hunting of Wild and Free
Animals While Wearing This Garment.''
   The Oregon Land Coalition also has assailed companies for
donating a portion of proceeds to environmental groups.
   American Greeting Cards, for example, contributes a percentage
of sales of its wildlife line of cards to the National Wildlife
Federation. Shearson markets an Eco-Logical Trust, which invests in
environmentally conscious companies, and the broker returns some
proceeds to the Environmental Federation of America. Canon is
donating money to the Wildlife Federation and the Nature
Conservancy for every used copier cartridge consumers mail back to
the company. And Ralston is supporting Global Re-Leaf, a
reforestation project, as part of a new cereal campaign.
   ``We want to wake up corporate America to the fact that
powerful, monied groups are at work shutting down the engines of
this country and they are doing it in the name of
environmentalism,'' Lang said.
   ``We need to ask the question, `Who is really in the mainstream
here?''' said Stephanie Sklar of the National Wildlife Federation.
``I would really hate to see these groups bully other companies who
are making an effort to do something positive about the
environment,'' she said.
   In the Barbie commercial, Mattel invited children to send their
ideas for making the world better to the company. The eight
American youngsters who sent the best replies won trips to New York
City for a ``Barbie Summit'' with 39 other children from around the
world. The company promised to donate about $500,000 to the cause
picked by the young summiteers.
   The Oregon Lands Coalition feared the money would go to an
environmental group, and told its members in a newsletter, ``Buy a
Barbie and your money will help stop timber harvesting.''
   As it turned out, while the environment and animal rights were
the top concerns of the U.S. children, world peace was the majority
concern of the international group. Mattel says it has not decided
which peace organization will get the money.
   As for the Oregon Land Coalition's criticism, Mattel spokeswoman
Donna Gibbs said, ``We kind of thought, how can anybody criticize a
program that is designed to give children a voice in a world they
are going to inherit?''
   Cotler said it received an equal number of telephone calls
supporting and denouncing its ``environmental protection'' line of
children's clothes. The complaints included those of the Oregon
Lands Coalition and Save Our Sawmills, of White City, Ore.
   ``The purpose of the theme was to promote an environmental
awareness with young people. Obviously we did not have the intent
to offend any one group's sensibilities,'' said Cotler spokeswoman
Martha Koletar.
   While Cotler withdrew the line, officials for most of the other
companies said they stand behind their efforts.
   ``We feel there is a corporate commitment in trying to keep the
environment clean and good for future generations,'' said Jody
Roberts, spokesperson for American Greeting Cards in Cleveland,
Ohio.
   Canon President Hideharu Takemoto said his company's Clean Earth
Campaign has enjoyed a tremendous response from ``environmentally
conscious consumers'' and the project is being expanded. So far,
the firm has donated $50,000 to the Wildlife Federation and the
Nature Conservancy.
