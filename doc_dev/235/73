To outfit little girls with fantasy wear, Pleasant T. Rowland has the most 
imaginative concept going. Rowland, a Wisconsin entrepreneur, author and former 
teacher, started her Middleton, Wis. firm, Pleasant Co., in September, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
As part of her business she included an American Girls Collection of clothes 
for girls ages 7 to 10, with matching outfits for dolls. All the clothes and 
doll costumes are inspired by the make-believe characters in the accompanying, 
American Girls storybooks that Pleasant publishes. Clothes, dolls and books are 
available by mail order only. 
</P>
<P>
The storybook characters are the old-fashioned kind. No bionic women or road 
warriors here. There is Kirsten Larson, a fictional, Scandinavian girl who 
settles on the American frontier of 1854. She wears country dresses and woolly 
separates that keep her warm on chilly Minnesota mornings. Samantha Parkington, 
an orphan who lives with her wealthy grandmother, has oodles of fancy party and 
day dresses for her activities at Miss Crampton's Academy. The scheming, 
dreaming Molly McIntire, who lives with her mother while her father fights in 
World War II, rounds out the collection of characters, with her all-American 
girl, plaid jumpers, her pj's and raincoats. 
</P>
<P>
Most outfits are available in girls sizes 6x to 16 and range in price from $45 
to $175. The dolls, dressed like various characters, are priced from about $75 
and sold with their own, personal storybook. Their clothes are priced at about 
$16 to $42, with patterns available at $10 each, for home sewers. And there 
seems to be a market for it. Business has more than doubled each year since the 
company was formed, says Tamara Hauck, vice president of marketing and product 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"Little girls are looking to emulate someone, and these characters can be used 
as role models," Hauck says of Kirsten, Samantha and Molly. "The characters 
stand for solid American values such as courage, determination, familial love 
and the rewards of friendship." Hauck contrasts these ideals to the life styles 
represented by typical "fashion" dolls, such as Barbie. "They have sports cars, 
dream houses and other material things," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Fashions for her storybook dolls and for little girls are all conceptualized by 
Rowland and made of fabrics designed in-house. Cotton twill, taffeta, velvet 
and wool are staple fabrics for clothes, flame-retardant polyester and nylon 
fabrics are used for sleep wear. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive historical research goes into the outfits, most of which (except 
perhaps the prairie dresses) are classics, meant to blend with clothes already 
in a girl's wardrobe. A case in point: the Scandinavian ensemble of woolens are 
hand-knit in black and white yarns to create a Scandinavian pattern indicative 
of those worn at the turn of the century in character Kirsten's native country. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the line are some elaborate accessories for dolls and girls. A 
girl-sized sheared rabbit-fur muff and hat is re-created for Samantha in white 
faux fur. The World War II doll, Molly, has a tiny, monogrammed handkerchief 
containing an authentic 1943 steel penny used during the war when copper was in 
short supply. Some dolls even have paper dolls to play with. 
</P>
<P>
But the accompanying books seem to be Rowland's pride. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no accident that the dolls are sold only with the purchase of a book -- 
they are not available separately," says Hauck. "One of the objectives is to 
encourage young girls to read and to learn about history." 
</P>
<P>
The American Girls Collection of dolls and fashions are available through mail 
order only. To obtain a catalogue call (800) 845-0005.
