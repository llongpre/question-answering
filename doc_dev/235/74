<LEADPARA>  Hide this newspaper, Mom and Dad, and blindfold the children. Here is a peek
at what Santa Claus is bringing next Christmas, or at least what the toy
industry hopes he is bringing.;    The 88th Annual American International Toy
Fair, which opened this morning, is a 10-day exhibition of the hottest new
toys by nearly 1,400 toy makers for more than 20,000 buyers from retailers
like Toys "R" Us Wal-Mart and Macy's.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The fair is off-limits for exactly the people the products are meant for.
"Absolutely no one under the age of 18 will be admitted to the Toy Fair," warn
the materials supplied to visitors.;    The toy industry is having its
troubles. Christmas was sluggish for most toy makers and retailers, and
disastrous for some. Child World, the second-largest toy retailer after Toys
"R" Us, said last week it was close to finding a buyer for the company.;   
Last week, Tonka Corp., the nation's third-largest toy maker, agreed to be
acquired for $516 million by Hasbro Inc., a deal that would make Hasbro the
world's largest toy company.;    For the fall, Mattel Inc. is coming out with
Shani, a black doll with a Barbie-like fondness for fashion, albeit
African-influenced. Shani means marvelous in Swahili, Mattel says.;   
Inexpensive is also a byword at this year's recession-conscious Toy Fair, as
companies try to introduce toys that are smaller and usually sell for less
than $15.;    Mattel has a whole line of toys smaller than a youngster's hand
and built around the cult film, "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," in which
crazed fruit wreak havoc on San Diego.;    Hasbro is also introducing Tell Me
Tots, tiny talking dolls less than 5 inches tall that use microchip
technology.;    "Toy Fair is an opportunity for Charles Lazarus to say,
'Here's what we will take and here's what we won't,' " said Sean P. McGowan, a
toy industry analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Co., referring to the
chairman of Toys "R" Us.;    Children and parents, speaking through the sales
rung up on computerized inventory systems, will make the real decisions for
toy retailers later in the year.;    "The smart buyers will get a little bit
of this and a little bit of that," McGowan said, "and then let their checkout
scanners determine what they'll buy a lot of.";    Hasbro's Milton Bradley
subsidiary is introducing Splat!, The Bug Squishin' Race Game, in which
hapless arachnids are dispatched with glee.;    Judging by past Toy Fairs,
these annual get-togethers are not particularly accurate indicators of what
will be the hot toys and which toy companies will come out ahead.;    Neither
Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles nor Slap Wraps, the wraparound bracelets, were
products from major exhibitors, yet both were sensations in 1990.;    And the
biggest toy company of all does not even have an exhibit at the fair. Nintendo
of America had seven of the 20 best-selling toys in the country last month.;  
 Nintendo showed its wares at a consumer electronics show in Las Vegas last
month.; TOY SALES; More than 1.75 billion toys were sold in 1989, up only;
three percent from 1988. Here's a look at some categories; of toys; ...;
