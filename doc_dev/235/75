   With an uncertain Christmas season under way, toy
company executives said Wednesday they are looking for more
business opportunities overseas to offset the sluggish U.S. retail
market.
   ``The outlook in international markets is brighter,'' John W.
Amerman, chief executive officer of Mattel Inc., said at a toy
industry conference sponsored by the investment firm Bear, Stearns
&amp; Co. Inc.
   Executives generally agreed their industry will feel pressure
from the sagging U.S. economy during the holiday season although
strong products should continue to sell well. Toy sales have
slipped along with sales of other merchandise as consumers,
uncertain about the economy and the Middle East, curtailed their
spending in recent months.
   ``It's really a mixed question,'' said Alan Hassenfeld, chief
executive officer of Hasbro Inc.
   While Hasbro expects a healthy performance from its Cabbage
Patch dolls and Milton Bradley board games, ``it might not be a
buoyant Christmas season,'' Hassenfeld said.
   Overall, the U.S. toy industry has seen slow growth in recent
years, rising from a $12.4 billion market in 1986 to $13.4 billion
last year, according to estimates from the Toy Manufacturers of
America, a trade group.
   This year, the figure is expected to climb to $14 billion.
   Those totals do not include video games, which were hot-selling
items during the 1980s. Nintendo of America Inc. projects that the
company and its licensees will sell about $4 billion worth of video
game products this year.
   But even Nintendo, which dominates the U.S. video game market,
expects to see a drop in sales of its hardware systems this year.
The company does project strong growth in its software game
cartridges.
   ``Rumors of our demise continue to be premature,'' Peter T.
Main, vice president of marketing for Nintendo, said in prepared
remarks at the conference.
   Main said that as the market for his company's products matures,
``software will continue to be the critical ingredient.''
   Hassenfeld said a maturing video game market is a positive sign
for makers of board games, such as Milton Bradley.
   Another encouraging trend is the growth in international sales,
he said. Hasbro, which does about one-third of its business abroad,
expects international sales to increase by more than 30 percent
this year, he said.
   Tyco Toys Inc., with 13 percent of its sales coming in foreign
countries, has a smaller international base but also hopes to
expand it quickly, said Richard E. Grey, chief executive officer of
the company.
   While Tyco expects its sales to grow by about 14 percent in the
next three years, it projects international growth at 30 percent
over the same period.
   At Mattel, which does about half of its business abroad,
international sales grew by 31 percent during the first three
quarters of 1990, compared with overall growth of 19 percent.
   Amerman said the company hopes to strengthen its foreign
business in the near future. In 1991, Mattel plans to introduce a
new line of Barbie dolls in conjunction with Bennetton, the Italian
apparel retailer.
   Mattel, which makes Disney toys, also hopes to see a boost in
business when a new Disneyland opens in Europe in 1992, he said.
   Amerman said Europe has about twice as many young children as
the United States, and while there might be less disposable income
in some European countries, the ``sheer weight of numbers assures
Mattel consistent growth in the early 1990s.''
