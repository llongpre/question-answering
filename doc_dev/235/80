<LEADPARA>  Barbie, GI Joe and the Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles are decidedly American
creations. But between inspiration and the toy store are thousands of Chinese
factory workers who assemble many of these kiddie favorites for American
companies.;    Because it wants to maintain access to those Chinese workers,
the U.S. toy industry is taking a leading role in battling unionists and human
rights activists who want the United States to eliminate China's
most-favored-nation, or MFN, trading status to punish the Beijing government
for its human rights policies.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The industry, which relies on China for 30 percent of its supply, contends
that Congress would create a no-win situation if it overturned President
Bush's recommended extension of China's MFN status -- which keeps tariffs on
Chinese products as low as imports from most other U.S. trade partners.;   
"The short-term ramifications of eliminating MFN would be disastrous for the
toy industry," said John G. Taylor, a toy industry analyst at L.H. Alton &amp;
Co., a San Francisco-based investment firm. "Some companies anticipated a
potential problem and have been reducing their reliance on China for sourcing
the past two years. Others would have to make a quick and painful move.";   
Certainly, China would feel the pain if Congress decided to use trade to
strike at Beijing. Congressional hearings on bills that would either eliminate
MFN or make extension conditional on China's human rights record will be held
this week and a vote on at least one of the measures is expected before Aug.
2.;    Without MFN status, tariffs on Chinese-made goods would rise an average
of 48 percent -- making the price of Chinese products uncompetitive in the
United States. Without access to the American market, as many as 1 million
Chinese workers could lose their jobs, according to some estimates.;    But
the 800 U.S. companies that have production facilities in China would also
face hardships if China's MFN status were eliminated, according to the
U.S.-China Business Council, a trade group composed of companies with
financial interests in that Asian giant. U.S. companies have invested more
than $4 billion in China, and much of that investment would drop in value if
those companies were unable to export their products to the United States at
low duty rates, the council says.;    The toy industry has about $50 million
invested in China. About 100 American toy companies import from China, and
many of those companies own manufacturing facilities in southern China. In
addition to losing a source of many low-cost toys, Americans who put the
finishing touches on Chinese-made toys might lose jobs if China's trading
status were changed, the industry contends.;    Some of the smaller American
toy companies -- those that rely on the Chinese for most of their product
supply -- would not be able to survive if China's MFN status were eliminated,
said David Miller, head of the Toy Manufacturers of America, an industry trade
group.;    Without MFN, American importers would have to pay 10 percent to 30
percent more for Chinese toys, Miller said. The added costs would be passed on
to retailers, resulting in a 30 percent to 50 percent price hike at the retail
level, he said.;    Miller also contends that as many as 25,000 American jobs
in the toy industry might disappear if China's MFN status were eliminated. The
workers who package Chinese goods or complete the assembly of toys partially
manufactured in China are most at risk, he said.;    Among those concerned
about possible job loss in the United States is Barry Alperin, vice chairman
of Hasbro, the Pawtucket, R.I.-based industry giant. Hasbro -- it has some of
its GI Joe figurines and Cabbage Patch dolls produced in China -- employs
about 8,000 in the United States.;    "We would do everything we could to
avoid (layoffs), but there could be some job loss here," Alperin said. Hasbro
would shift production to other low-wage, low-cost countries if China lost its
current trade status, he added.;    El Segundo-based Mattel Inc. is also
poised to shift or reduce its Chinese production if necessary, said Joseph
Gandolfo, president of operations at the company. Mattel's joint venture
operation with the Chinese government employs 5,000 to 6,000 in southern
China, generating toys such as the Magic Nursery dolls and Barbie at about 25
percent of the cost of manufacturing those products in the United States.  </TEXT>
