<LEADPARA>  Q  In December, my 5-year-old daughter and I sent away for a backpack from the
Barbie Fashion Fun Guide Pink Stamp Club (a system where you save pink stamps
from Barbie Fashion clothes). The merchandise requires part cash and part
stamps. We saved 20 stamps and sent the proper order form on Dec. 27 enclosing
a $2 check. My check was cashed in late January, but we have yet to receive
the backpack. My daughter is very disappointed. I wrote a letter asking about
the order but did not receive a reply. Could you please find out what's going
on?;    -- Robin Kirschenbaum, Fremont  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  A  Somehow your daughter's order slipped through the cracks, says Mary Jordan,
a consumer affairs official with Mattel Toys. The bad news is that Mattel has
no more of those backpacks. Jordan says if you want, she will send your
daughter a Barbie Fanny Pack, Neat Treats Munch Box and the Barbie Sipping
Pretty Squeeze Bottle in place of the backpack. This is a much greater value,
says Jordan. She is sending you a letter apologizing for the oversight. She
wants you to call her at a number she's including in her letter. If you don't
want this package, Jordan will make sure you receive a refund.; POSTMARK IS
PAYMENT DATE; Q  Enclosed is a copy of a letter I recently received from the
Santa Clara County tax collector's office. I mailed my check for the second
installment of my property taxes on April 3. The office claims my check wasn't
received until nine days later. I can't believe it takes nine days for a
letter to go from Campbell to San Jose. I suspected a problem when I didn't
get that tax check back in my April statement. I called the office and was
told there were a lot of envelopes sitting on the desk unopened. The tax
collector's office now wants me to pay a penalty that raises my taxes $96.99.
Could you look into it?;    -- M.S., Campbell; A  We contacted the office on
your behalf, but the penalty is still due, says Cheryl Johnson, secured tax
manager for the tax collector's office. Your letter shows an April 12
postmark, Johnson says -- two days after the April 10 deadline for making the
payment, which is due Feb. 10, without penalty. California Revenue and
Taxation Code section 2515 orders tax collectors to accept the U.S. Postal
Service postmark as the date of payment. Johnson says that in order for the
office to waive the penalties, the taxpayer must produce a registered or
certified receipt from the Postal Service to show the envelope was mailed
earlier than the postmark.; MISSING MAIL RETRIEVED; Q  I can't get my mail
delivered lately. The same thing is happening to several of my neighbors.
Please help us.;    -- Sallie Lycett, Palo Alto; A  The postal service found
that your mail and some of your neighbors' was being sent in error to the
Postal Service's computer forwarding system, where mail is supposed to go when
there's a change of address on file, says Lorraine Pleasants, a U.S. Postal
Service spokeswoman. Now that the Postal Service is aware of the problem, it
should be cleared up, Pleasants says. Because there were no changes of address
on file, the mail eventually filtered back into the system and was delivered,
she says.  </TEXT>
