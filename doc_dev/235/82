   The Cabbage Patch Kids are trying to make a comeback. 

   Hasbro, which acquired them and a few other product lines from Coleco Industries earlier this year for about $85 million, is gambling that there's still a lot of steam left in the cuddly dolls. 
The toymaker is planning a giant reintroduction of the Kids in September in the hope of restoring them to their former glory. 

   The Cabbage Patch Kids craze -- who can forget it? -- hit its zenith in 1985, raking in nearly $600 million in sales that year for Coleco. 
Demand was so great that anxious parents battled each other at shopping malls nationwide, and there was even a Cabbage Patch store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. 
But like all fads, Cabbage Patch Kids quickly ran out of gas, and today it's hard to find a four year old who even knows what they are. 

   Hasbro thinks it's positioned to change all that. 
"We fully believe it has the potential to become our No. 2 selling brand," says Al Carosi, senior vice president of marketing services at Hasbro. 

   An ambitious goal indeed. 
Sales of Cabbage Patch Kids have been in sharp decline since 1985. 
Analysts predict they will bring in about $30 million to $40 million this year. 
Not bad for a toy, but nowhere near Hasbro's No. 1 champ, G.I. Joe, which delivers about $200 million. 

   Moreover, Hasbro is planning to ride on the laurels of the dolls' original success. 
The company plans, for example, to resurrect the adoption feature that was such a hit with kids. 
But some marketing experts question whether recycling old themes will be enough to make Cabbage Patch Kids a stable performer like G.I. Joe or Mattel's Barbie. 
Kransco Group tried to do just that last year with an ad campaign aimed at revitalizing the Hula Hoop. 
But the craze, most analysts agree, never reignited. 

   To add to Hasbro's challenge, Coleco left the Cabbage Patch Kids franchise in a colossal mess. 
Coleco, which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court proceedings, ceased distributing the dolls widely and terminated all advertising and marketing programs about 18 months ago. 
Hasbro and Griffin Bacal, the New York ad agency that was recently awarded the account, are faced with a new generation of young consumers who haven't been exposed to the Kids. 

   Griffin Bacal's first TV commercials, which are being shot in Ireland this week, seek to combat that problem. 
Mr. Carosi says the $7 million campaign will stress the qualities that made the product a hot seller in the first place: the adoption factor (the idea that every Cabbage Patch doll "needs" a kid) and the uniqueness of each product (no two dolls are identical). 

   "In the later years, Coleco walked away from those two things, and we think that was a mistake," he says. 
"We're taking Cabbage Patch back to its heritage." 

   But marketing consultants warn that may not be enough to grab and hold the attention of consumers. 
"They've got to breathe some new life into the product," says Gary Stibel, principal at New England Consulting Group in Westport, Conn. 
"Hasbro will need to identify what enhancements to the collection are still available to make the bells ring." 

   Mr. Stibel says one thing Cabbage Patch desperately needs is a story that children can associate with the dolls. 
To bring a personality to the dolls, it would be wise to develop a family or a central group of characters, he says, much like that of the Barbie doll. 
She has a pal, Midge, and a boyfriend, Ken. 
"With Cabbage Patch, there are all kinds of possibilities," he says, adding it might mean developing new varieties of dolls, like Cabbage Patch adults or Cabbage Patch animals. 

   "Cabbage Patch is a wonderful brand name," Mr. Stibel says. 
"There's a lot of equity here. 
It is limited only by the creativity of the people who'll relaunch it." 

   Mr. Carosi insists Hasbro has made some advances in the area of line extensions. 
The company is readying Sippin' Cabbage Patch, a variety where the doll appears to drink when a child puts a bottle in its mouth. 
After a swig, Mr. Carosi says, the doll burps. 
And then there's the Designer Cabbage Patch line that features dolls dressed in trendy fashions. 

   Executives at Griffin Bacal say the challenge of reintroducing a fading toy isn't new to them. 
The agency worked with Hasbro in designing the marketing plan that successfully relaunched G.I. Joe in the early 1980s, the toy that is Hasbro's top performer today. 
In that case, however, the product got more than fresh ads. 
The original doll, a 12-inch mannequin that lost its luster in the early 1970s, was reintroduced as a more hip 3 3/4-inch action figure in 1982. 

   "We want Cabbage Patch Kids to be forever," says Paul Kurnit, the agency's president. 
"The Cabbage Patch concept is wonderful and has a right to be a forever product," he says. 

   Still, marketing experts caution Hasbro in managing profit expectations for the brand. 
"If they go into this with the expectation that they will be able to reignite the euphoria of 1985, they're mistaken," says Marc Particelli, senior vice president at consultants Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton in New York. 
"They will be lucky to build this up to a smaller, stable business."
