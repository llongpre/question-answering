   Hasbro Inc. on Monday reported profit
gains of 14 percent for the fourth quarter and 27 percent for the
full year.
   The company also said it discontinued its Maxie line of fashion
dolls, Hasbro's primary competition against Mattel Inc.'s Barbie,
because the doll did not meet sales expectations.
   The toy manufacturer earned $24 million, or 40 cents a share, in
the fourth quarter, up from $21 million, or 36 cents a share a year
earlier. Sales rose 5.6 percent to $417 million from $395 million.
   Income for the year ended Dec. 25 totaled $92.2 million, or
$1.56 a share, compared with $72.4 million, or $1.24 a share, in
1988. Revenue for 1989 was up about 4 percent at $1.4 billion from
1988's $1.35 billion.
   A Hasbro executive said the the toymaker's annual results were
not as good if a 1988 video game write-off were considered.
   ``But it's not as dramatic as it seems'' when tempered by 1988's
charge for the Nemo video system that never came to market, said
John T. O'Neill, executive vice president and chief financial
officer.
   Deducting that from 1988 research and development costs would
have improved earnings to about $80 million, in the range of $1.40
a share, he said.
   Hasbro, however, maintained its margins by holding costs down _
advertising increases, for instance, rose less than 1 percent.
   ``We managed very tightly in terms of operating costs and ... we
succeeded in getting a lot more leverage on our fixed costs,''
O'Neill said.
   Alan G. Hassenfeld. chairman and chief executive, said there was
balanced growth domestically and overseas, despite the strong
dollar.
   Domestic growth came from the Milton Bradley and Playskool
lines, Hassenfeld said. He said the addition of Cabbage Patch Kids
from Coleco brought more balance to Hasbro's product lines.
   Spokesman Wayne Charness confirmed that Hasbro had discontinued
Maxie. He said the decision was made about a month ago and that
Hasbro was keying on its recently announced New Kids on the Block
line as its latest fashion doll entry.
   ``Maxie was doing OK, but it really wasn't living up to the
expectations we had for it,'' Charness said.
   He refused to provide figures. The Wall Street Journal said an
analyst estimated Maxie sales last year were $20 million to $25
million, about the same as a year earlier, while Barbie sales were
approximately $375 million.
