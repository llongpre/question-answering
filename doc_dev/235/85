   Mattel Inc. posted fiscal second-quarter net income of $21.9 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $14.2 million, but predicted full-year revenue might not match last year's figure. 

   John W. Amerman, chairman, said the toy maker's improved net for the quarter ended Oct. 1 "demonstrates the success of our plan to control costs, manage the Mattel product line and direct the company toward solid, long-term profitability." 

   He added, however, that revenue for the year may be lower than the $1.02 billion the company reported for 1987 because Mattel is concentrating more on sustaining profit than on increasing revenue. 

   Quarter sales fell 4% to $306.6 million from $318.1 million a year ago. 
Inventories fell to $116 million, down 39% from $190 million. 
Mr. Amerman said both of Mattel's core brands, Barbie and Hot Wheels, are selling well in retail stores. 
The company's line of infant and preschool products featuring Disney-licensed characters and its new large doll, Li'l Miss Makeup, are also selling briskly. 

   Per-share net in the latest quarter was based on 48 million common shares and common-share equivalents, compared with 42 million shares a year earlier. 

   For the first nine months, net was $25.4 million, or 53 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $12.4 million. 
Sales fell 11% to $702.4 million from $786.2 million. 

   Nine months' per-share net was based on 48 million common shares and commonshare equivalents, compared with 40 million shares the previous year.
