   Drug czar-designate William J. Bennett, known
as one of the poorest members of President Reagan's Cabinet when he
was education secretary, hit paydirt during the few months he was
out of office and could have been a millionaire in a year if he had
stayed out.
   A lecture-circuit industry source said Bennett ``turned down $1.5
million in lectures in 1989'' when President Bush nominated him last
month to be director of National Drug Control Policy.
   During the few months after he left office Sept. 20, ``he earned
about $150,000 to $200,000, which was just getting his feet wet,''
said Don Walker, president of the New York-based Harry Walker
Agency, which got 30 percent of the fees that ranged from $15,000 to
$20,000 per lecture.
   ``I had a good few months in the private sector, the best three
to four months I ever had,'' Bennett said. ``I was told it would
have been a very good year for me.''

   A U.S. appeals court ruling requiring
wheelchair lifts on new public buses nationwide is the most
important victory yet for disabled Americans seeking access to mass
transit, plaintiffs' lawyers say.
   In its 2-1 ruling Monday, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
also upheld a lower court order that the federal Department of
Transportation eliminate a 3 percent cap on the amount of money
transit authorities must spend to improve transportation for the
disabled.
   ``The impact of the majority's decision will be very substantial
throughout the country and will interfere with the local
decision-making authority,'' Judge Morton I. Greenberg wrote in his
dissent. ``I feel the court is overreaching.''
   The majority opinion by Judge Carol Los Mansmann said a
Transportation Department regulation requiring all new buses to
accommodate wheelchairs conflicts with a regulation allowing
communities to offer only an alternative service to the disabled.

   South Florida's weather has been the envy of the
nation in recent weeks, but the abnormally hot, dry winter is
depleting the region's water supplies, drying up wetlands and
hastening the start of the wildfire season.
   From Lake Okeechobee to Key West, rainfall has been running only
about 50 percent of its historic average since December.
   Combine that with temperatures consistently in the low 80s, at
least 5 degrees hotter than normal, and you have the makings of a
drought.
   ``You might as well call it the south Florida desert,'' says
Henry LaRose, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey office
in Fort Myers. ``The trouble is, things are going to get worse
before they get better.''

   Long lines formed at the courthouse and business
boomed at the city's 25 wedding chapels today as an expected 1,500
couples began tying Valentine's Day knots in this marriage mecca.
   Beverly Swinn, who has seen hundreds of thousands of couples line
up at the Marriage License Bureau, said workers were hoping they
might get a breather this year, with Valentine's Day falling near
the middle of the week.
   Last year, when Valentine's Day fell on Sunday, 1,365 couples
purchased licenses Feb. 13 and 14.
   The bureau issued 841 licenses this weekend, said Ms. Swinn. More
than 400 were issued Monday and at least that many were expected
today, she said.

   They rolled out the pink carpet at Lincoln
Center, where the celebrities wore pink roses and sipped pink
champagne and pink Perrier. But the guest of honor didn't so much as
blush.
   That's not surprising _ she was Barbie, the doyen of fashion
dolls, who was honored Monday night for her successful 30-year
career as one of the most popular American toys.
   Mattel Inc. billed the black-tie affair as Barbie's ``Pink
Jubilee'' anniversary party. Company executives said the lavish
party, which helped kick off the annual toy industry fair, was a
fitting tribute to a toy that has shown such remarkable longevity _
and profitability.
   ``Whatever the cost is, I think it's worth it,'' said John W.
Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer.
