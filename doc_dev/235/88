   Mattel Inc., boosted by consumer demand for many of its staples such as the Barbie doll and Hot Wheels cars, posted a fivefold increase in second-quarter net income to $16.6 million, or 33 cents a share, from $3.2 million, or seven cents a share. 

   The Hawthorne, Calif., toy maker's sales for the quarter ended July 1 were $272.3 million, up 31% from last year's $207.1 million. 

   John W. Amerman, chairman and chief executive officer, said retail and consumer demand has remained "very strong" for its core brands as well as a line of licensed Disney infant and preschool toys. 

   Net income for the first half rose sixfold to $20.9 million, or 42 cents a share, from $3.5 million, or seven cents a share. 
Mattel said it would have reported per-share income of 51 cents in the latest half except for a mandated accounting change involving tax benefits. 
Sales for 1989's first half were $467.6 million, up 18% from the year-earlier $395.7 million. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the stock rose 87.5 cents to $16.75.
