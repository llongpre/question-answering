   If it weren't for kids, there wouldn't be so many excuses for
adults to visit toy departments at holiday time. There are
thousands of toys marketed, so parents have plenty of fun ahead of
them before letting the youngsters take over. Here is the barest
sampling of what's in the stores:
   DOLLS. Classic baby dolls and what might be called role model
dolls prevail.
   - The Magic Nursery Baby has to arrive before its new owner can
determine its sex, just like a real baby. Each doll comes with a
homecoming garment that dissolves in water, revealing a packet with
a card that tells whether it's a boy or girl. Every 36th doll sold
will have a card that says it's a twin, and a second doll will be
on the way when the card is redeemed with Mattel, the maker.
   - If twins aren't enough, how about Quints? Five little dolls,
complete with accessories that are color coded (to tell them apart,
of course), come from Tyco Toys.
   - Then there's a new batch from the patch. Cabbage Patch Kids
with different facial features, eye colors, hair styles and skin
tones in as many variations as the owners themselves come in
Birthday Kids, Babyland Kids, Kids' Kids that pose, and Babies
reeking of baby powder. Now marketed by Hasbro, Cabbage Patchers
still come with their individual adoption certificates and
thousands of outfits to choose from.
   - Dolls heading out in the world include the Mommy Doll from
Tootsietoy, depicting the working mothers of real life. Briefcases,
jogging sweats, granny gowns, car keys, laundry baskets and babies
of their own accessorize these model moms. According to Cindy
Stern, who created the doll (with toy clothing designer Sue Ogden),
most mothers choose versions of the doll that most resemble
themselves.
   - Artistic aspirations are captured by My Pretty Ballerina by
Tyco Toys. This doll, dressed in tights and leg warmers, can dance
on point and execute arabesques or pirouettes. She comes with her
own practice barre. Separate accessories are performance ensembles
with costume pieces and cassette tapes with music from ``The
Nutcracker Suite'' and ``Swan Lake.''
   - What's a model of a model? It could be a doll from the Real
Model Collection by Matchbook Toys, fashion plates depicting
Christie Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs or Beverly Johnson. Each doll comes
with portfolio, fashion changes, autographed pictures and beauty
booklet. The real Brinkley, Tiegs and Johnson are donating part of
their doll sales royalties to The Make-A-Wish Foundation.
   - Barbie probably is the Grande Dame of all fashion dolls, and
new versions from Mattel include the Ice Capades Barbie, Barbie and
The Beat, My First Princess, Wedding Fantasy, Air Force Barbie,
Barbie's All-Stars, Nigerian Barbie and Brazilian Barbie. Barbie
also has her first Bob Mackie gown, which the designer created for
the first in a series of collector Barbies.
   - Fashion consciousness has hit paper dolls, too. Lookin' Pretty
Dolls from Ohio Art come with press-on, peel-off vinyl fashions
that can be stored in their own carry-cases.
   - Old-world charm characterizes the Canneto Dolls from Hasbro,
made by a family in Italy. The dolls recall those grandmother had,
with country-print dresses trimmed in lace and flowers, straw or
lacy bonnets and floral bouquets. The dolls come with brushable
hair and soft bodies in baby dolls, toddlers, and little girls.
   CUDDLIES. Plenty of plush, but personalities are emerging.
   - A little fellow called F.R.O.Y.D. is sort of odd looking. He's
yellow, has a Cyrano-type nose and wears a button that says ``I
believe in you!'' He was discovered on a drawing pad one day by
former jewelry designer Carolyne Greene, who got him ready for his
debut in the toy world. F.R.O.Y.D. (for ``I'm for the reality of
your dreams'') says he was there to encourage Columbus, helping him
believe there really was something on the other side of the ocean.
He says he helped Thomas Edison see light bulbs, and Gorbachev find
a new way for Russia. ``Encouraging people to have the confidence
to make their dreams come true is my favorite thing to do. And I
don't need batteries. You can say the only accessory I come with is
your imagination.''
   - Another comforting character is Snobell, a reindeer in plush
from Applause. This pure white reindeer gets his name from the six
bells on his antlers that keep him from disappearing in the snow.
He has gray gloves and a green scarf with red tassels.
   - Also from Applause are Tiny Toons plush toys based on
characters in the Stephen Spielberg animated feature of that name.
These are teen-aged Bugs and Daffy offshoots, including Buster and
Babs Bunny, Plucky Duck, Hamton, Dizzy Devil and Montana Max.
   - Now five years old and still going strong is Teddy Ruxpin, the
talking bear from Worlds of Wonder. Said to be the world's first
animated talking toy, Teddy communicates to kids with moving eyes,
mouth and voice from casettes. This year he comes up with some new
Adventure Series tapes and storybooks, including the Do-Along
Songbook and Fire Safety with Teddy Ruxpin.
