   ``Christmas was on its way, lovely, glorious,
beautiful Christmas, around which the entire kid year revolved.''
   That was how humorist Jean Shepherd summed up the holiday season
in the 1983 film ``A Christmas Story,'' the tale of a little boy's
quest for the Christmas present of his dreams, an air rifle.
   And so it is for millions of children - Christmas is the high
point of their year. But this Christmas is a difficult one for many
of their parents, who are concerned about the economy and the
Middle East and have less money to spend on toys.
   Consumers are in a quandry, caught between financial restraints
and wanting to fulfill their children's Christmas wishes.
   Toy retailers and manufacturers already have felt the pinch.
Toys R Us Inc., the nation's biggest toy retailer, suffered a slump
in sales after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August that mirrored
the drop-off in business throughout the retail industry.
   Robert Nakasone, a Toys R Us vice chairman, acknowledged that
these are uncertain times, but he expected a merry Christmas
nonetheless.
   ``People may cut back for durables ... but when it comes down to
your kid at Christmas, it's pretty hard to say no to them,'' he
said.
   Even in relatively poor economic years, he said, Toys R Us has
had some of its best holiday seasons. In 1982, in the midst of the
country's last recession, toy sales for the entire industry rose 13
percent.
   But some industry analysts were not as sanguine. Daniel Barry,
of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., said toy sales could slip along with other
merchandise sales this season.
   Retailers and manufacturers are concerned because even one less
toy under a Christmas tree, when multiplied by the more than 60
million children age 16 and under in the country, can make for a
poor Christmas season.
   Perhaps the most sensitive area is video games, which again are
on many wish lists this Christmas.
   Retailers and video game manufacturers face several unknowns.
Given the uncertain business environment, no one is sure how many
parents are willing to invest big on Nintendo and other more
expensive video systems.
   The biggest question is whether the new systems, which offer
more advanced technology and more sophisticated graphics and sound
effects than Nintendo, can take market share from the industry
leader.
   Children who have tired of Nintendo games - or whose Nintendo
systems have worn out - are asking for the new units, known as
16-bit systems. A bit is the smallest unit of information in a
computer, and 16-bit systems can process more information and
instructions than eight-bit systems like Nintendo.
   The 16-bit systems, which include NEC Corp.'s TurboGrafx-16 and
Sega's Genesis, must overcome a big obstacle - their price.
   The basic Genesis unit has a list price of $189.95, while the
basic TurboGrafx-16 goes for $159. Those prices don't include game
cartridges, which can run $50 or more apiece.
   In comparison, Nintendo looks like a bargain. Its basic unit can
be found for under $100 in many stores, and many of its cartridges
sell at a discount because there is a glut of them on the market.
   Nintendo's hand-held model, Game Boy, also has a price edge over
its new competitor, NEC's TurboExpress. Game Boy has a list price
of $100 while TurboExpress lists for $249.
   It all comes down to how much parents want to indulge their
children and how much they can and want to spend.
   Manufacturers say they already are feeling the effects of a
cautious consumer.
   ``In a normal year, retailers in October would purchase enough
to take them all the way through Christmas,'' said Ken Wirt, NEC's
vice president for home entertainment.
   But this year, he said, storeowners so far have ordered enough
merchandise to last them only through the Thanksgiving weekend.
   Paul Valentine, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., said
manufacturers of traditional toys, such as dolls and action
figures, have had similar experiences.
   ``The turmoil in the retail industry has definitely had an
impact on the toy industry,'' he said.
   But some traditional toys are expected to be sure winners this
season, analysts say.
   Children's love affair with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is
continuing, so the Playmates Toys Inc. action figures and their
spinoffs, which include videos, books, clothes, watches and games,
should do well.
   The Simpsons are expected to be found in varying forms under
plenty of Christmas trees. Manufacturers have licenses from the
producers of the popular television series for a range of
merchandise including dolls and plastic figures.
   Dolls based on the rock group New Kids on the Block have been
selling well ever since their introduction earlier this year by
Hasbro Inc., and they're expected to be a hit again at Christmas.
   Barbie, Mattel Inc.'s long-reigning queen of toys, continues to
dominate the doll business, with new outfits, a swimming pool and
her own Corvette among the offerings.
   Meanwhile, there's been an explosion of baby and toddler dolls
as that segment continues to thrive. A parent shopping in a
well-stocked toy department or store may dozens of dolls to choose
from, with most ranging from $20 to about $60.
   There are dolls that drink, wet their diapers, fall down, cry,
shiver or take baths, and dolls that can be dressed up, made up or
have their hair dyed. The toy companies have tried to outdo one
another in making their dolls stand out. Hasbro created Baby Uh-Oh,
which soils its diapers after it has been fed. The idea turns some
adults off, but little girls love it and the dolls have been
selling well, according to Valentine.
   Another toymaker, Ideal, has aimed straight for mothers'
heartstrings by bringing back some of the most popular dolls from
30 years ago: Betsy Wetsy, one of the drink-and-wet dolls of the
early 1960s, and Tiny Tears, who weeps having her bottle.
   Besides video games and Ninja Turtles and other action figures,
boys are expected to receive toys based on Hulk Hogan and other
wrestling stars. Standard &amp; Poor's Valentine said Tonka Inc.'s
Wrestling Buddies and Hasbro's World Wrestling Federation figures
have sold well.
