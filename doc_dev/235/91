   International Business Machines Corp., taking its cue from
consumer-products companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, is
putting its muscle behind its first Pan-European product ad
campaign.
   Traditionally, the computer industry's dominant player
tailored its campaigns individually to each European country.
But increasingly, IBM has begun using virtually identical
personal computer ads throughout Europe -- the same image and
text with only the language changed for both broadcast and
print media.

   "The more Europe becomes integrated, the more important it
is to have really consistent brands" and advertising
throughout the Continent, says Felix Bjorklund, IBM's
European communications vice president. Otherwise, he says,
the executives inside a multinational client corporation will
get different images of IBM's products, depending on the
country they live in. The resulting confusion, he says, could
end up hurting sales.
   IBM can ill afford a further slump in sales. A weakening
in European markets -- long an IBM stronghold -- was a major
reason for a nearly 50% drop in the company's first-quarter
operating earnings. A successful Pan-European ad campaign
could help boost business for 1992, when many cross-border
trade barriers are set to collapse under the first phase of
the European Community plan.
   Of course, many consumer-product companies have long used
uniform European advertising. But such global marketing
strategies are only gradually spreading through the computer
industry, which historically has considered its goods
high-tech rather than mass-market. Several IBM rivals in the
European personal computer market, such as Compaq Computer
Corp. and Amstrad PLC, are also making increasing use of
uniform ads. But in higher-priced products, such as
minicomputers, standardized advertising is still unusual.
   IBM's adoption of a Pan-European ad strategy has been
gradual, starting with its first uniform corporate image
campaign a few years ago. In the fall, IBM debuted its first
completely uniform, pan-European ad campaign for a product.
On television screens around the Continent, viewers saw ads
promoting IBM's new line of mass-market, Personal System/1
PCs. Whimsical snippets showed youngsters experiencing their
first kiss and their first bicycle ride. The messages were
identical Europewide: Some things in life may be hard to
learn, but the PS/1 isn't one of them. Only the voice-overs
differed, using local languages.
   Likewise, the company is preparing standardized
promotional literature. A European cookbook, providing how-to
rules for all the company's product and service brochures,
has been developed. In English, it specifies such minutiae as
the requirement that all product brochures have
blue-and-white covers, with abstracts in the upper right-hand
corner. The abstracts, the cookbook dictates, should be two
or three sentences printed in seven lines of type, with a
tone that's "matter-of-fact, didactic and easy to
understand."
   Of course, uniformity saves money. Making one set of PS/1
television ads for all of Europe saved IBM $2 million in
creative and production costs, Mr. Bjorklund estimates.
Overall, he figures, savings made possible by uniformity lets
IBM stretch its $150 million European advertising and
promotional budget by an extra 15% to 20%.
   But there are occasional problems. For instance, IBM found
that its standardized print ads for PS/1 didn't grab as many
European consumers as it would have liked. The photographs in
the ads weren't sufficiently generic. For instance, one
pictured a PS/1 being used inside what appeared to be a
French bakery -- too nationalized for, say, a Dane to
identify with. And IBM found that distributing the more than
66 tons of PS/1 promotional literature from one central plant
ended up delaying, rather than speeding, delivery around
Europe.
   Still, with minor adjustments for such problems, Mr.
Bjorklund says, IBM has concluded that "in advertising,
there's no sense in today's world to reinvent the wheel" in
every European country.

   Judge Clears Petra Doll Ad
                                                                                                       

   A federal judge ruled that the U.S. unit of Lundby of
Sweden AB may air a modified television commercial promoting
its Petra doll.
   The judge last month granted a request for a preliminary
injunction against Lundby and its U.S. unit by Barbie-doll
maker Mattel Inc. The injunction prohibited the broadcast of
a commercial which advertised Petra as a friend of Barbie's.
Mattel had charged Lundby with false advertising, unfair
competition and trademark violations in connection with that
commercial.
   The modified commercial, in which a girl says "My Barbie
can wear Petra's clothes," deletes any reference to a
friendship between the two dolls and specifies what company
makes each doll.
   A spokeswoman for Mattel, based in Los Angeles, said the
company "will pursue the matter" if it can prove that the
revised commercial creates confusion about the source of the
Petra doll.

   ACCOUNTS: Chevron named J. Walter Thompson's San Francisco
office to handle its Ortho Consumer Products Division's
estimated $10 million advertising account. JWT, a unit of WPP
Group, succeeds Interpublic Group's McCann-Erickson unit,
which parted ways with Ortho, a maker of fertilizers and
pesticides for lawn and garden use, in January. . . .
NutraSweet, a unit of Monsanto, awarded the account for its
Desserve low-fat, low-calorie dessert line to FCB/Leber Katz
Partners, New York. Ad spending for the line, which is
currently in test market, couldn't be determined. FCB/Leber
Katz, a unit of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, handles NutraSweet's
Simplesse and Simple Pleasures lines.
                                                                                                       

   WHO'S NEWS: Michael Drake, director of media services at
BBDO, New York, was elected executive vice president at the
Omnicom Group unit. Also at BBDO, William Gray, executive
vice president and senior account director, was elected to
the board of directors.
                                                                                                       

   KETCHUM: Tom Rich stepped down as president of Ketchum
Advertising's Pittsburgh office. The agency said his
departure "was a decision mutually agreed to by the agency
and {Mr.} Rich." Mr. Rich couldn't be reached for comment.
Bob Kroyer, president of Ketchum's U.S. division, will head
the Pittsburgh office until a replacement is named.
