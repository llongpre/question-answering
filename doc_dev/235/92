   Mattel Inc. said it joined Hasbro Inc. and Kenner Parker Toys Inc. in discontinuing the use of animals in safety tests for its products. 

   Mattel, maker of Hot Wheels, Barbie dolls and other toys, said the testing involved "very few products." 

   All three toymakers had been the target of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a Rockville, Md., animal rights group. 
The group objected to many of the tests, which it said included force-feeding make-up and clays and squirting paint and projectiles into the eyes of rabbits, mice and rats. 

   Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., agreed to cease animal tests last week; Kenner, Beverly, Mass., agreed to discontinue the tests in April.
