   Mattel Inc. is closing its Philippine operations, a company official said. 

   J.D. Harper, Mattel Philippines Inc. president and general manager, said the company will cease operations Feb. 25. 
Mr. Harper said the decision reflected a world-wide slowdown in the Hawthorne, Calif.-based toy maker's sales and a "loss of confidence in the Philippines as a source of manufacturing." 

   Mr. Harper declined to elaborate. 
However, Mattel Philippines, which produces Barbie dolls mainly for export, has had longstanding labor problems. 
The decision will put more than 2,000 employees out of work. 
An additional 1,800 workers were let go late last year. 

   The U.S. parent has had recent layoffs as well. 

   Mattel began operations in the Philippines 10 years ago. 
It has been the country's largest toy manufacturer. 
According to BusinessWorld, a Philippine newspaper, Mattel Philippines' total sales of 288 million pesos ($13.9 million) in 1986 ranked 222 in the country. 
The subsidiary made a profit of 19 million pesos in 1986.
