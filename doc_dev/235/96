   Reality and make-believe mingled Monday at the
annual American International Toy Fair as hundreds of toymakers
touted their 1989 offerings to buyers from stores around the country.
   As usual, many manufacturers recruited colorful characters to
catch the eyes of buyers and grab some free publicity.
   A rifle-toting George Bush lookalike hawking a new board game was
only a few feet from authentic protesters airing gripes against war
toys, while real-life Olympic star Florence Griffith Joyner pitched
a new ``Flo Jo'' doll and developer Donald Trump made a
publicity-seeking appearance on behalf of a new board game bearing
his name.
   Nearby on the Fifth Avenue sidewalk, a unicycle-riding clown and
a life-sized green turtle _ that's human life, not amphibian life _
were among the crowd patrolled by police.
   The doyen of fashion dolls had a gala all her own Monday night. A
shimmering pink carpet was rolled out in front of Lincoln Center for
1,200 guests attending Barbie's ``Pink Jubilee.''
   Several stage and television celebrities paid tribute to Barbie
during a show commemorating her 30 years as a successful doll. New
York Mayor Edward Koch sent her some fan mail.
   ``Barbie's appearance in a wide variety of ethnic guises makes
her a great toy for New York, a city which draws unique energy from
its unparalleled ethnic diversity,'' Koch wrote in his letter.
   Elaborate promotions have become a tradition at Toy Fair, where
each year an estimated 5,000 new toys debut. Countless items on
display here will never make it to store shelves and many
much-touted toys of 1988 were absent as the 10-day trade show opened
its doors Monday.
   Amid all the hoopla, the industry reported business improved
modestly in 1988 after several disappointing years.
   ``I believe I speak for many in the industry who feel encouraged
by the performance of manufacturers in the past 12 months and are
optimistic about prospects for the future,'' said Thomas J.
Kalinske, chairman of the Toy Manufacturers of America Inc.
   One of the best omens is that publicly-held toy companies seem to
have reversed their bad fortunes of 1987, Kalinske said at a news
conference.
   Together, those companies lost about $120 million in 1987. Last
year, the same companies probably earned profits of around $120
million, according to the trade association.
   Retail toy sales rose to an estimated $12.75 billion in 1988 from
$12.5 billion in 1987. The association's figures don't include the
roughly $2.3 billion in revenue for video games last year, most of
which are foreign made.
   Although retail toy sales were virtually flat, the industry
reported a 3.9 percent pickup in sales at the wholesale level.
Manufacturers' shipments rose to $8.55 billion from $8.23 billion.
   Another good sign is that retailers are finding more customers
shopping for toys all year, instead of only during the pre-Christmas
buying binge, Kalinske said.
   A perennial problem for toymakers has been the reliance of their
balance sheets on seasonal shopping: if economic activity
temporarily falls off ahead of Christmas and causes consumers to
spend cautiously, toy makers' revenues are endangered.
   In an effort to coax customers into buying toys throughout the
year, manufacturers have emphasized items that appeal to adults as
well as children. Sociologists say this an astute marketing strategy
because families increasingly seemed to be staying home and engaging
in group activities.
   Last year's popular games such as Pictionary, or previous
successes such as Trivial Pursuit, benefited from this trend.
   Manufacturers also have had to account for the aging of the U.S.
population, which is shrinking the market for children-only toys.
   But among the biggest challenge for the U.S. toy industry is
competition from video games, by far the biggest selling items over
the past two years.
   While stores have reaped handsome returns from video games such
as the Nintendo game system, the sales steered money away from other
toys, mostly boys items.
   But some observers think that will change.
   ``I think the fad is concentrated with boys, ages 6 to 15, and
it's my belief that segment is saturated,'' said toy analyst Paul
Valentine of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
