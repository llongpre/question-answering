<HEAD>Judge Adds $46 Million to Patent Judgment Against Mattel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   A federal judge has ordered $46 million in
interest added to the $24 million judgment won in an inventor's
12-year court fight with toymaker Mattel Inc. over its ``Hot
Wheels'' toy cars, the inventor's lawyer said Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras refused Mattel's motion to
overturn the November judgment in the patent-infringement case or
grant a new trial. He also refused to triple the damages awarded to
New Jersey inventor Jerome Lemelson or to force Mattel to pay
lawyer's fees for the plaintiff.
   But in his final order, entered late Tuesday, Kocoras did set
out the procedure and percentages to be used in setting the amount
of interest Mattel must pay.
   Lemelson's attorney, Gerald Hosier, said it works out to $46
million _ making the total judgment about $70 million.
   Mattel said in a statement Wednesday that it will appeal the
patent infringement decision and is confident it will prevail.
   Lemelson, 66, a prolific inventor from Princeton, N.J., with
more than 400 creations to his credit, sued Hawthorne, Calif.-based
Mattel in 1977 for ``willful'' infringement on his patent for a
flexible track that is part of the company's ``Hot Wheels'' toy car
system.
   In its statement, Mattel said there are differences in its track
from the patent, and a similar product previously existed.
   Hot Wheels brought Mattel $545 million in sales between 1972 and
1986 and is the company's most popular offering after Barbie dolls.
   Lemelson, who got his patent for the track in 1969, said he
filed papers on his creation with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office in the mid-1960s, some time before Mattel's 1968
introduction of Hot Wheels.
   The case was filed in Chicago because its courts have a
reputation for finding in favor of inventors.
