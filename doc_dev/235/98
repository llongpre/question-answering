<TEXT>     But little girls take another view. Responding to a similar survey, they
pointed out that Ken is a dude who can't get serious about a career. He's been
a baseball player and Air Force officer (1963), businessman (1965), doctor
(1973) and flight attendant (1990). About half of the little girls polled
advised Barbie to lose him.  </TEXT>
