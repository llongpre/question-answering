   Mattel Inc. said its fourth-quarter loss, reflecting a major corporate restructuring, widened to $100.7 million from $26.9 million a year earlier. 

   The toy maker's latest loss included a $1.1 million charge for restructuring of debt. 
It said its sales slipped 14% to $233.8 million from $271.9 million. 

   A spokesman said the company had a loss of about $7 million from its toy operations in the quarter, wiping out the slight operating net that business had produced through the first nine months. 

   Mattel said that over the year it had reduced its headquarters staff by 480 persons, to the current level of 1,720, and closed plants in the Philippines and Taiwan and a small facility in Los Angeles. 
Also as part of the restructuring, the company discontinued some minor product lines to trim expenses. 

   The spokesman said the restructuring will reduce Mattel's domestic break-even costs by $200 million. 
International sales, which account for a little more than half of total sales, remain profitable, he said. 

   Mattel's stock closed Friday at $6.75, off 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

   Analysts said the loss was expected because the company had posted disappointing holiday sales and softer-than-expected sales of its "Captain Power" interactive video toy. 

   "The worst seems to be over," said Steven Eisenberg, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Mr. Eisenberg said the current industry focus on basic, less-expensive toys will help Mattel, which manufactures such staples as Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars. 

   "Mattel is fully capable of turning in a fairly good earnings performance for 1988," said David S. Leibowitz of American Securities Corp., a research firm. 

   For all of 1987, the company reported a loss of $113 million. 
Mattel said the loss included a $96 million provision for restructuring expenses and $28 million in taxes on foreign earnings. 
Its restated net loss for 1986 was $8.3 million. 

   Sales dropped about 4% to $1.02 billion from $1.06 billion a year earlier.
