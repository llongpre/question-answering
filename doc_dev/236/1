   Your Aug. 9 Asides "ACLU Defends Satanism" states that a coven of witches in Rhode Island was able, via the assistance of the ACLU, to obtain tax status as a legitimate religious body. 
This obviously piqued your editorial ire. 
If you had bothered to do your research, you would know that witchcraft (also known as Wicca) is recognized by, among others, the U.S. armed forces as a legitimate religious practice. 
You would also have been able to tell your readers that Wicca far predates the advent of Christianity and therefore has nothing to do with either God or Satan.

   Witchcraft, which can be positive or negative, has little or no similarity to Satanism, except that they both deal with the unseen world. 
Such ignorance unleashed the Salem witch hunts three centuries ago. 
Incidentally, the Rhode Island tax ruling was certainly a correct one.

   In your haste to discredit the ACLU you have played fast and loose with the facts on witchcraft. 
Witchcraft is not Satanism. 
This sad attribution was begun by the Roman Catholic witch hunters in the Middle Ages; relying on these sources is like relying on Nazis for insights on Jewish culture. 

   Witches and their covens are nothing more, and nothing less, than the remnants of the great, pre-Christian pagan religion of Europe and the Near East. 
Rather than worship a male god, witches revere the Great Goddess, an all-encompassing figure who appears even today in popular culture as Mother Nature or Mother Earth. 
Despite the lack of a bureaucracy, hierarchical priesthood or massive buildings, witchcraft assuredly falls under any definition of religion, precisely the point the ACLU was trying to make.

   Satanism is a Judeo-Christian religion; Wicca is not. 
Satanism glorifies evil and can exist only in opposition to Christ and the Judeo-Christian god. 
Wicca is in opposition to no religion except Satanism, but only because Wicca opposes all manifestations of evil. 
Wicca is a religion of healing and nurturing. 

   I have never known a witch or a coven that believed in Satan. 
Satan is from an entirely different (and to us, recently developed) religion, and we deny his existence.

   You perpetuate the tendency for Christians to regard those who worship something different from their own God as uncivilized followers of the devil, and ready for conversion to what you might consider a real, tax-deductible religion. 
But witchcraft and other "pagan" religions began long before Christianity. 

   Just because witchcraft isn't as popular as Christianity doesn't mean its churches shouldn't be given the same rights and benefits of Christian churches -- every church is protected under the First Amendment's guarantees of religious freedom. 
We can't have laws favoring one religion while repressing others, otherwise we're doomed to return to the days of witch burnings and concentration camps.
