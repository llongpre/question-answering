<LEADPARA>  POLICE and witches in St. Paul, Minn., have reached an understanding in their
dispute over freedom of religion in the city's parks.;    About a dozen
witches were conducting a midsummer religious fire-ring ceremony in a city
park the night of Aug. 2 when police arrived and ordered them to stop their
ritual and leave a public area.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     According to the witches, some of the police drew their service pistols
when they saw Bertram, the high priest of Minnesota's 100 or so practitioners
of Wiccan witchcraft, making gestures with his ceremonial dagger, actually an
ornate letter-opener.;    One of the dozen officers who came to investigate
the ceremony allegedly ridiculed the witches, accusing them of being
satanists.;    Hilary Pell, 35, a priestess of the Minnesota Church of Wicca,
said she was asked by an officer, "Do you worship the devil?";    She said she
told them she did not since Satan is a Christian concept. She said the Wicca
religion, which is derived from ancient pagan beliefs, focuses on the care of
the earth.;    Police spokesman Paul Adelmann insisted the problem "had
nothing to do with religion." He said the witches had a gallon jug of wine
(which is against park law), that the ceremonial daggers could be easily
construed as weapons in a dark wooded area and that some of the witches were
trying to control access in the fire ring area.;    Later, after some witches
lodged a complaint, Police Sgt. Vern Lee, occult crimes expert in the police
special investigations unit, and high priest Bertram (actually Philip Flom),
met over coffee and sought to patch up the misunderstanding.;    Lee said he
could appreciate the Wiccans' outrage. "I belong to a Masonic lodge and the
Shrine," he said. "You don't walk into those meetings."  </TEXT>
