   An Air Force physical therapist who says she
is a witch has been given permission to observe eight holidays in
her faith, including All Hallow's Eve.
   Airman Patricia Hutchins, 21, who says she has been a wiccan, or
witch, for four years, asked the Air Force to allow her to take
time off from Lackland Air Force Base for religious holidays, just
as it does members of other religions.
   Witches generally believe that the sun, moon, earth and all life
are divine and are personifications of all creative energy.
   Base spokesman Bob MacNaughton said Lackland's chaplain, Col.
David Engler, wrote a letter to Ms. Hutchins' supervising officers
at Wilford Hall Medical Center, asking that they follow Air Force
regulations on religious freedom.
   MacNaughton said an Air Force regulation on accommodating
religious practices states: ``Members of the Air Force are free to
express religious beliefs in a manner that is consistent and fair
to all.''
   Ms. Hutchins said she was surprised by the chaplain's expedient
help.
   ``I have found that chaplains in the Air Force are very
open-minded,'' said Ms. Hutchins. ``I was surprised they did it,
but I'm very grateful.''
   Ms. Hutchins also will be allowed to observe days marking the
changes of the seasons.
   ``As far as we're concerned, wicca is not a hostile type of
faith,'' said MacNaughton. ``Her being a witch has not presented
any problems for her in her working place or anywhere else.''
   Among the days she'll be allowed to observe are All Hallows Eve,
Oct. 31, and days marking the changes of the seasons. Hutchins
traces her faith to Celtic Ireland.
   Ms. Hutchins' husband, who also serves in the Air Force, is not
a wiccan.
   Colleagues and co-workers haven't shunned her for her beliefs,
she said.
   ``Everybody has been really good about it,'' said Ms. Hutchins.
``I work with a lot of officers and they seem to be very
open-minded and have at least read about wiccans.''
   The daughter of a Protestant minister, Ms. Hutchins said she
doesn't know of any others in the Air Force who practice witchcraft.
