<TEXT>     If the events of the past few months are any indication, women are looking
for a spiritual connection -- for a way to push the boundaries of their
religious experience beyond the ordinary confines of traditional
Judeo-Christian monotheism.;    Consciousness-raising may have been the solace
of the '70s and career development the icon of the '80s, but the '90s offer a
very different option -- the spirit.;    Today's seekers, after all, are the
daughters of the feminist revolution. Not for them the victimized heroines and
saints of the past, or the patriarchal structure of the male-dominated
religions of the Old and New Testaments.;    Their touchstones are the pagan
religions, the pre-Christian earth-centered goddess cults that stress the
harmony of the universe -- offering equality rather than hierarchy, peace
rather than war, joy rather than guilt, ritual rather than rote.;    "It's
religion without the middleman -- including sex and drugs," says Margot Adler,
a journalist at National Public Radio and the author of "Drawing Down the
Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshipers and Other Pagans in America Today.";
   Practitioners estimate that the women's spirituality movement has as many
as 500,000 followers across the country.;    Whether mainstream, new age,
goddess-oriented (a point of view expressing a female- and earth-centered
style of worship rather than a specific body of liturgy) or wiccan (a mainly
British Isles paganism named from the Old English word for witch), today's
celebrants are as varied as they are hard to count.;    "It's definitely
growing, but you'll never get hard figures," says Adler, whose book was
originally published in 1979 and, with more than 100,000 in print, still sells
more than 10,000 a year. "A group of women can start a group and not tell
anybody, and you'll have a thriving group doing rituals and who will know?";  
 What can be traced is the flourishing book industry, mostly out of San
Francisco, that the movement has spawned. Two books published in 1979 --
Adler's and "The Spiral Dance," a more personal vision by the San
Francisco-based priestess known as Starhawk -- have been particularly
influential.;    Several threads are woven through the burgeoning movement: a
dissatisfaction with the way women are treated within traditional religions, a
yearning for ritual, a desire for a historical connection, despair over the
fragmentation of society and concern about the future of the planet.;    Says
Diana Hayes, professor of theology at Georgetown University: "Within
Christianity, theology and spirituality have been male-oriented,
male-dominated, because they are the ones articulating it. But we all are
affected by who we are, where we came from, our life experience, our
relationship with God.;    "So the challenge has been to get this realization
out in the open and to have the men who dominate theological circles realize
that they cannot speak for the rest of the human race. Women do not think or
act the way men do. Therefore our spirituality will not be the same as
men's.";    A gifted speaker with an easy sense of humor, Starhawk --
priestess of the Old Religion of the Goddess and women's spirituality
superstar -- is equally at home beating time in the center of a ritual or
working the crowd at the podium of a lecture hall.;    Early interest in
witchcraft;    She also at home with what she calls the "W" word ("witch").
"Unless we understand it, we don't know why a powerful woman is so threatening
and so frightening," she says. "There was a 400-year reign of terror
particularly directed against women who were then burned alive," she says,
likening the witch hunts to the African slave trade, the Holocaust.;   
Starhawk became interested in witchcraft in her late teens when she and a
friend did a student seminar on the subject at UCLA. Now she is at the
forefront of a movement to reclaim the word for positive use.;    The picture
of witchcraft that emerges within today's women's spirituality movement is a
combination of group therapy, positive thinking, stretching exercises, guided
visualization, song and dance, and even pot luck.;    Its goddess- and
nature-oriented precepts are similar to the Old Religion of prehistoric times
and societies that fell victim to the witch hunts and persecutions of medieval
and Renaissance Europe. It is earth-centered, individualistic and
peace-loving.;    Leading a group of women in Philadelphia through a series of
activities, the 40ish Starhawk looks not unlike the tall Jewish girl from Los
Angeles she used to be. But her soft-voiced, authoritative presence and
staccato chanting and drumming command her sessions with surprising power.;   
Use of chants;  Like many women's ritual leaders, Starhawk uses chants as a
kind of surrogate liturgy -- as a blessing, a uniting force, a backdrop to
movement and dance.;    In a visualization, she takes the group to an
imaginary crossroads in the sky. "Close your eyes," she says. "Reach out and
feel and touch and smell these roads until you find one that feels like a road
in the future. Go down the road. Know you can come back to this place of power
because it is you. And remember there are many roads to the future. The road
you chose is only one possibility.";    Starhawk spends about a third of her
time teaching ritual and spreading the faith at college campuses and other
forums. She feels that people crave it. "Even people who live in cities --
like most of us -- are still connected to the cycles of nature," she says.
"Doing ritual that helps you affirm that helps us not to feel cut off from the
larger life around us, the actual life support systems that sustain our lives."  </TEXT>
