<TEXT>     He re-enacted an "exorcism" on Channel 5's "People Are Talking" show -- but
the woman he supposedly freed of demonic beings was actually his live-in
girlfriend. (She called him a "doctor." He isn't.);   Then, after organizing a
1990 "public cursing" of televangelist Larry Lea, he suddenly and inexplicably
converted to born-again Christianity. Now he's selling himself as "the witch
who switched" and finds himself in the middle of a dispute between the pagans
and the Pentecostals.;   He is Eric J. Pryor, age 32, a native of Suffren,
N.Y., who grew up in Woodstock. He has a long criminal record -- something he
willingly admits -- and has reportedly bragged about cheating people out of
their money. "I never said I was a saint," he says.;   He has, indeed, dabbled
in witchcraft for much of his life. But his latest incarnation is that of a
preacher, garbed in Army fatigues, who conducts his "Christian Gladiator
Ministries" out of San Jose's Jubilee Christian Center.;   It was quite a tale
of salvation and spiritual renewal -- a made-for-TV movie, at least -- until
Nov. 21.;   That night, ABC News reporter Diane Sawyer anchored an
investigative report on the network's "PrimeTime Live" exposing fraudulent
televangelists who manipulate their followers into giving them millions of
dollars.;   One of the show's targets was Larry Lea's Texas ministry, and
Sawyer raised serious questions about Pryor's reputed conversion and the TV
preacher's role in it.;   Pryor "was never a major leader of the pagans," she
said, citing his "long arrest record" and contending that the supposed
conversion "was accompanied by wining, dining and money.";   The program also
showed a tape of Pryor seeming to marry Sandra, his girlfriend, with the Rev.
Dick Bernal of the Jubilee Christian Center performing the ceremony -- even
though Pryor was, and still is, married to another woman.;   So, who is this
Eric Pryor? Born-again bigamist? Spiritual con artist? Or a misunderstood
convert to fundamentalism whose enemies are out to get him?;   The latter is
the role Pryor is playing most recently. Sitting in a back room Tuesday
afternoon at the Jubilee Center, a large charismatic church claiming 5,000
congregants, Pryor makes his case. On this day, the tall, gaunt, decidedly
pale Pryor is wearing a sleek suit and tie. His formerly long, bleached-blond
hair is trimmed, neatly combed back and dyed red.;   Efforts 'to shut me up'; 
 "I'm out to expose the fraud in the pagan community," he says, contending
that he is incensed at the accusations. He charges that the network expose
made use of questionable material gathered by Bay Area pagans "to shut me
up.";   Bernal explains the conversion process this way: He met Pryor on that
Halloween 1990 "People Are Talking" show, and their conversation continued at
the hotel coffee shop next door. Then he offered Pryor transportation money.; 
 "Wining, dining and money?" Bernal asks, referring to the ABC expose. "I gave
him coffee, nachos and cab fare.";   The "PrimeTime Live" report also cited a
Herb Caen column in the San Francisco Chronicle saying Pryor made $100,000
last year. Pryor vigorously denies it, maintaining that he's virtually
penniless. His only sources of income, he says, are "love offerings" from the
church and people moved by his preaching -- as well as sales of "From Pagan to
Pentecost," a $25 video version of his purported transformation. He gets $3 in
royalties per sale.;   Pryor also says he spends one day a month passing out
money to homeless people and inviting them to listen as he spreads the word.
"I do this because I've been there and I care," he tells them, "and this is my
way of serving the Lord I call king of my life, Jesus.";    As Pryor is making
his case, Bernal enters the room to offer his total support. At the same time,
however, the minister clearly is taken aback by Pryor's flashy attire,
extravagant jewelry and Rolex watch. "You're supposed to be penniless," Bernal
says with a chuckle, "and you're sitting here dressed like a riverboat
gambler.";   Later, Pryor explains that his watch, gold chains and bejeweled
rings -- some real and some fake -- are all simply more "love offerings.";  
The church has helped Pryor somewhat. It did find him a Santa Clara apartment,
Bernal says, insisting it was necessary to move him out of San Francisco in
response to death threats. Bernal also provides him with a small income --
$500 a month on top of his $600 monthly Social Security check, "but the money
didn't come until after he was converted." (Larry Lea had said on the ABC show
that Pryor was given $1,000 a month; he has since corrected that figure to
$500.);   Explaining the questionable marriage ceremony is a bit trickier,
however.;   Before Pryor and his girlfriend, Sandra, could be accepted into
Bernal's church, they had to get married, says the minister -- but Pryor was
quick to say that his wife, Nicole, had left him and he had no idea if he was
still legally married. On the advice of the church's lawyer, therefore, Bernal
says the ceremony was merely "a little spiritual ceremony, not a civil
ceremony.";   If it appeared more serious than that to ABC viewers, the
minister suggests, it's the fault of women in the church, who let it get out
of hand. Thus the tux, the wedding gown, the flowers and the marriage license
that they appeared to be signing. "My wife and some of the girls got
involved," says Bernal. "They wanted to make it special.";   Bay Area pagans
willingly agree they have been digging up dirt on Pryor's background. They
also concede that they passed on much of the damaging material used on the ABC
broadcast.;   Pagan backlash;   "I know that he has said things that are not
true," says Don Frew, public information officer for the Covenant of the
Goddess, a well-established pagan group. Frew produces a registered letter he
sent to Bernal warning that Pryor may be out to con the pagans, the Christians
or the world -- and is not to be trusted. He says Bernal never responded to
the letter.;   "I received the letter," Bernal says now. "To me it typified
the paranoia of the pagan community. They seemed to be looking for things that
aren't there. Eric's conversion was real.";   "The purpose of our doing what
was done on this was not to get Eric Pryor," says Eric Marsh, spokesman for
Bay Area Pagan Assemblies (BAPA) -- an organization made up of low-key
practitioners of Wicca, a nature-loving, goddess-worshiping sect, and various
New Age spiritualists.;   "We had someone here who was working through
falsehood to give pagans a black eye," says Marsh. "That continues to be our
reason for following this thing through and documenting it.";   Marsh is a
Wiccan, and thus is particularly miffed at Pryor for casting hurtful spells,
pretending to perform exorcisms and engaging in other other seemingly sinister
rituals.;   "He stirred up a frenzy of media attention," says Marsh, "but he
was talking about hexes and curses -- things that you simply don't do. He
claimed to be Wiccan, but he was not really involved in the Wiccan
community.";   Marsh says the televised "exorcism" ritual was "something we
have never seen before -- and it was also terrible P.R." Marsh also recalls --
and tapes of TV newscasts confirm -- that Pryor performed a bit of public
voodoo, using a black candle as Larry Lea's effigy, and cutting it in half
with a knife.;   "We were not supposed to be doing anything negative," Marsh
complains. "Claiming the effigy is equivalent to Larry Lea was completely
unethical and also serious bad juju. Other people started doing counter-magic
as soon as that happened.";   The "good" witches say they feared Pryor was a
fraud at worst, and real trouble no matter what. "If (Larry Lea) slips off the
stage and breaks his legs or something it is his own karma," Pryor said on one
TV newscast.;   Now, the reborn-again Pryor rails against pagans and gays in
the same frightening manner he had used to curse fundamentalist Christians. In
June, he spoke at a fundamentalist church in Cameron Park, and the local
newspaper quoted him as saying, "My goal is to destroy Satanism, humanism,
paganism, druidism and the practice of homosexuality in our lifetime.";  
Fringe character?;   "I would ask and even beg of Mr. Pryor that he produce
any information he can" about local pagans and their practices, responds Frew.
"He hasn't been on the inside of any major group. He has been on the fringes,
but he has never been a central player.";   As evidence, Frew cites letters
from pagan leaders Pryor claims to have known but who either can't remember
him or recall him as something of a fringe character. In response, Pryor
simply says he was a low-profile witch until he stepped forward to organize
the anti-Lea protest.;   "What do the pagans have against Eric?" asks Bernal,
the Christian fundamentalist preacher. "He has made it public that it is now
his calling in life to tell the world that witchcraft can lead to drug abuse,
alcoholism, murder . . .";   " . . . and self-mutilation," Pryor adds
eagerly.;   Recently, Pryor was guest speaker at an Assembly of God church in
Peoria, Ill., and the local paper reported straightforwardly that he preached
about making big money also being God's work: "There is nothing spiritual
about poverty. The Lord commands you to prosper.";   He is also quoted as
saying "tens of thousands across the country" once practiced paganism under
his leadership.;   It may not be reality, but it played in Peoria.  </TEXT>
