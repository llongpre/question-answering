<LEADPARA>  I'M SURPRISED that your Religion &amp; Ethics editor chose to do a story on
Stephen Mitchell's new book ("The Gospel Truth?" Dec. 21) several days before
the very reason for the Christmas celebration. Not only does Mitchell, a
non-Christian, attack the character of the New Testament in "debunking" its
unified picture of Jesus Christ, but he adds nothing to the plethora of
negative and arbitrary scholarship on the subject.;   Scholars such as
Mitchell always ignore two obvious facts in their denunciation of the gospels.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Letters  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     1. The New Testament writers either personally followed Jesus or knew those
who did. The Apostle John, for instance, says, "We have seen, we have heard,
we have touched" (1 John 1:1-3). Mitchell wasn't there. He has no scholarly
basis to declare some 2,000 years later that John is a liar. . . .;   2. The
early followers of Jesus were mostly Jews. They believed what they experienced
because they believed in the God of the Old Testament. Miracles never
surprised them because the Hebrew Scriptures are full of miracles. Scholars
who ridicule the gospel stories rarely debunk the Hebrew stories along with
them. Yet both the Old and New Testaments are consistent in their portrayal of
the same God who offers love and help to the world.;   The only point on which
I might agree with Mitchell is that even if we could positively verify every
bit of history in the gospels, we still could not, on the basis of that
history, conclude that Jesus is God's son and the world's savior. That is a
matter of faith, the same faith that sustained hostages Terry Anderson and
David Jacobsen. Those of us who believe in Jesus as mature persons and mature
Christians do so because we have experienced Christ in the midst of life's
situations. And we can assert, not on the basis of scholarly duties, but
rather on the basis of an ongoing reality, that Jesus Christ is who the gospel
writers believed him to be.;   The Rev. Warren Angel; Congregational Christian
Churches; San Jose; Holy Scripture fiction; Stephen Mitchell has a right to
believe and say that Jesus is a fraud or a nut, and honor requires that he
forthrightly so state. Instead, he chooses to water Jesus down to another good
man and Holy Scripture fiction. As for Mitchell's advice to those horrified by
his scholarly "findings" to "take it in and deal with it" -- give me a break!;
  Jesus is either who he claims to be, God's son, or a fraud and a liar.
Mitchell believes Jesus to be a fraud and a liar and the Holy Bible a hoax.;  
Larry Malone; San Jose; Bad timing; In my judgment you used abominably poor
taste in featuring the views of Stephen Mitchell (with a half-page color
photo, no less) on your Religion &amp; Ethics pages the weekend before Christmas.;
  His effort to re-create Jesus and the Scriptures according to his own image
of what Jesus ought to have said and done results in an almost total
theological and spiritual emptiness. His ideas (heresies) are not new, as he
acknowledges. They don't even come close to defining the nature, power and
uniqueness of the Christian faith. Every generation witnesses attempts to make
of Jesus just another human philosopher.;   Readers, many of whom flock to the
churches on Christmas, deserve better from you.;   Gordon A. Selbo; San Jose;
Denying the truth; As a believer in Jesus Christ, I find nothing new or
shocking in what Stephen Mitchell writes or claims in his book "The Gospel
According to Jesus.";   Mitchell is just another in the long history of
educated, intelligent people fervently seeking a way to deny the truth that
struggles to occupy their souls, their minds and their hearts.;   Dan McAfee;
Campbell; Belittling Christianity; Stephen Mitchell's book denies the virgin
birth of Jesus Christ, denies that he performed miracles and termed most of
the stories about him as "myths and legends.";   Would the Mercury have
printed such an offensive article on the eve of the holy days of other
religions? Somehow I doubt it. It has become routine to belittle and offend
Christians and their beliefs.;   Carolyn M. Rose; Santa Clara; Lazarus and the
truth; As part of Stephen Mitchell's work, he has decided that the story of
Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead had no truth in it. While I can't claim to
be a biblical scholar, I wish to point out that even the story of Lazarus may
have factual substance. As most readers know, techniques such as
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation can and have revived the apparently "dead.";  
The Lazarus story certainly raises a distinct possibility that truth lies
behind it.;   Thomas Donaldson; Sunnyvale; Lack of scholarship; If I write my
version of U.S. history and delete all the difficult issues, all the wars, all
the inhumane acts because of my belief that the United States is an
enlightened nation, will you then feature my book and my life on the front
page of the Living section?;   That is precisely what you did in featuring
Stephen Mitchell's beliefs and his book.;   It is surprising how much distance
is given to those who want to rewrite the biblical record without any thought
to real scholarship. Does Mitchell understand anything about the
legal/historical method of proving events of the past? Does he understand
anything about bibliographic tests to prove the reliability of ancient
manuscripts?;   I don't think so.;   Bret Johnson; Pleasanton; Omissions and
biases; I believe that some serious omissions and biases were riddled
throughout the article "Reborn again?" (Religion &amp; Ethics, Dec. 14), about my
conversion from paganism to fundamentalism.;   A quote by reporter Dave
O'Brian says that I bragged about cheating people out of money. "I never said
I was a saint," he quotes me. However, he never qualifies that I was talking
about what I was like before I became a Christian.;   O'Brian also talks about
a re-enacted exorcism I did on Channel 5's "People Are Talking" show. He says,
"But the woman (Pryor) supposedly freed of demonic beings was actually his
live-in girlfriend. (She called him a 'doctor.' He isn't.)" Does the term
witch doctor ring a bell to any of you at the Mercury?;   Now, as for the
pagan community's comments, O'Brian states, "Bay Area pagans willingly agree
they have been digging up dirt on Pryor's background. They also conceded that
they passed on much of the damaging material used on the ABC 'Prime Time'
broadcast." O'Brian told me during the interview that the pagan material I had
presented to him was irrelevant. Irrelevant as in what -- when it is used
arbitrarily to hurt someone like myself?;   Don Frew of the Covenant of the
Goddess, an organization that O'Brian states is a well-established pagan
group, said, "I know that (Pryor) has said things that are not true." Don Frew
wouldn't know that truth if it jumped up and smacked him in the face. And the
Covenant of the Goddess is not a well-established organization; it's just a
bunch of burnouts grasping at straws and engaging in intellectual gymnastics.;
  As for Eric Marsh, spokesman for the Bay Area Pagan Assemblies, O'Brian said
that Marsh is a Wiccan and therefore particularly miffed at me for casting
hurtful spells and pretending to perform exorcisms and other seemingly
sinister rituals. "He claimed to be a Wiccan," Marsh says of me, "but was not
really involved in the Wiccan community." I showed O'Brian my BAPA (Wicca
community) membership card, but of course that counts for nothing, right?;  
All in all, if I was a nobody from nowhere, then why did these good witches
even bother showing up at my old New Earth temple public cursing ritual of
Larry Lea? Which, by the way, was the most widely documented cursing ever on
television.;   I gave O'Brian . . . footage of my temple and showed beyond a
shadow of a doubt that I was deeply involved in the pagan community. Or is it
that the pagan community can whine and moan and have its statements reported
as fact but when a Christian makes a statement of fact and verifies it with
filmed and written documentation, it has no meaning.;   Eric J. Pryor;
