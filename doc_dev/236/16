<TEXT>     Background: Raised a Methodist, she became disillusioned with her faith in
her teens. The years that followed were spent as an agnostic as she explored
different faiths. "All I found were religions that were too patriarchal, too
high-energy or loaded with the same problems.";    Four years ago, she
discovered Wicca, a nature-oriented pagan religion whose members believe in
the control of their own destiny through karma and reincarnation. "Everything
felt right about it for me," she says, and it took a 13-page letter to
convince her family.;    Working on: President of the Bay Area Pagan
Assemblies, Christian helped found the organization "because it's hard for
pagans to find other pagans," she says. "We're not listed in the yellow pages
under churches." For the past three years, the group's monthly Gaia's Gateway
meetings at Palo Alto Unitarian Church have provided seekers of paganism a
place for informative talk and ritual.;    "BAPA's goals are outreach and
education," she says. "We want to make the public aware that we don't worship
the devil. And we want to break the negative stereotyping associated with the
practice of 'witchcraft.' " Long term, the organization would like to create
day care facilities, hospitals and nursing homes for pagans, like other
churches. In the meantime, members meet throughout the year for social events,
holidays and participate in fund-raisers to reach their goal.;    Home:
Fremont, where they've converted their spare bedroom into a personal sanctuary
for Wiccan worship. "We feel lucky because other pagan practitioners have to
use coffee tables or the tops of TV sets as altars.";    Hobbies: Bay Area
Pagan Assemblies and technical writing exclusively, she says, until she forced
herself to take a class in stained glass for diversion. She enjoys making
"nature things" with glass and swimming four times a week during her lunch
hours.;    Hero: "A friend, whose sage advice encouraged me to worry less
about today if it's not going to matter tomorrow and that what other people
think is only important to a degree.";    Most important thing to teach a
child: "To be colorblind. To respect a person's choice for a path or worship
and to not fear the differences between people.";    It's a great day when: "A
better understanding about my spirituality is affirmed. With so many
misperceptions about pagan ritual, it's nice when someone says they appreciate
and understand your beliefs.";    Friends like me for: "My perseverance.
Helping to clarify the teachings and make paganism more accepted is a path I'm
supposed to walk."  </TEXT>
