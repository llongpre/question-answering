<LEADPARA>  Drunken sex orgies? Kestryl Angell asked with a laugh. "I have never gotten an
invitation." Angell is a witch and she was answering one of the usual dumb
questions about covens.;    The reason reporters were questioning her this
week is that she was taping what has to be the world's first TV talk show for
witches. The initial installment will run June 6 but don't look for it in the
listings. It's broadcast over a public access station in Arlington, Va.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Angell is the host. The producer is her roommate Cheryl Costa, a.k.a. Lady
Cassandra, high priestess of Wicca.;    They describe themselves as "good
witches," which we think means they won't turn you into anything uglier than a
frog. They say they reject devil worship and black magic, being instead
devoted to love, trust and spiritual healing.;    Reporters on the set
describe the scene: Angell prepares an altar of burning candles, chalices, a
dagger, a pair of deer antlers, a tiny broom and icons of some goddesses whose
names the scribblers didn't catch. Her sacred space is purified by the wave of
a carved wooden wand, and whiffs of burning incense and the tinkling of a bell
give the heebie-jeebies to any evil spirits in the studio and makes them
hightail it.;    With a graceful shake of her long auburn hair, the blue-robed
priestess and her two guests sit on plump floor cushions on a braided rug
beneath the altar. Angell peers into the camera and says quietly: "Good
evening. I'm Kestryl. Welcome to my circle.";    The guests, by the way, were
Susan Hill, an electronics technician, and Diana Sunday, a technical writer.
Hill calls herself a modern Druid whose worship is "directed toward healing
the earth." Sunday follows shamanism, which evokes the world of animal
spirits.;    "After a hard day at work," Sunday explains, "I meditate and
imagine I'm a deer leaping across a meadow.";    Costa estimates that more
than 1,200 witches are living secretly in the Washington-Baltimore area but it
takes more than magic to get them to appear on TV. Apparently there's
something about announcing yourself as a witch that turns off employers,
neighbors, etc.;    Another problem of production was the usual one: money.
Costa says she conjured only enough to run local, half-hour biweekly shows for
one summer.;    Maybe the rest of us will get to see them through the magic of
reruns.  </TEXT>
