   The Salvation Army violated a woman's
constitutional right to freedom of religion when it fired her
because she practices witchcraft, a federal judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Dan M. Russell of Biloxi ruled last week that
the Salvation Army cannot discriminate against witches because it
receives federal funds for some programs.
   Jamie Kellam Dodge, a former victim's assistance coordinator at
the Pascagoula-based Salvation Army Domestic Violence Shelter, filed
a $1.25 million lawsuit against the Salvation Army. She sought
reinstatement and compensation for embarrassment, humiliation, pain
and suffering. A ruling on compensation will be made later, court
officials said.
   Dodge, 28, was fired in August 1987 after she admitted using the
agency copy machine to copy Satanic-Wiccan rituals, according to
court records.
   ``If you could see it, you would agree it was horrible. It talked
about sexual things, around the fire, lots of things that are
contrary to Salvation Army policies,'' Raymond Brown, an attorney
for the Salvation Army, said Saturday.
   The Salvation Army has not decided whether it will appeal the
decision, he said.
   Dodge's attorney, David Frazier of Pascagoula, called Russell's
decision ``courageous.''
   ``He bit the bullet and did what a federal judge is supposed to
do, to cite tough decisions in an effort to follow the law,''
Frazier said.
