   Massachusetts' ``official witch'' has begun a
letter-writing campaign to protest what she and other witches
believe are violations of their civil rights.
   Letters of complaint, stemming from news reports linking a
``witch'' to a cult of drug smugglers connected with the
ritualistic deaths of 15 people found near the Texas-Mexico border,
have been sent to major newspapers and television networks from
Laurie Cabot's Salem-based group, Witches League for Self-Awareness.
   ``We are not satanists, we do not do black magic or any evil
magic,'' said Cabot, who formed the 900-member group in 1986,
shortly after the filming of ``The Witches of Eastwick,'' a movie
witches said made them appear ``stupid.''
   In group literature, the league is described as a ``national and
international anti-defamation organization which is working to
protect the civil rights, dignity and public portrayal of over six
million Witches, Pagans and Pantheists.''
   The witches complained they have been ``portrayed in an
inaccurate, offensive and libelous manner which is in violation of
our constitutionally guaranteed civil right to practice religious
freedom, as well as freedom from harassment, discrimination,
persecution, or the incitement of the public to form adverse
opinions of members of a religious community.''
   Cabot, dubbed the ``official witch'' by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
in 1975, said Tuesday that she and other witches are part of a
legally recognized religion that is ``peaceful'' and devoid of the
evil doings associated with witchcraft stereotypes.
   The recent complaints sent to news organizations such as The New
York Times and NBC News stemmed from news reports about the
murderous cult of drug smugglers in Texas.
   Mexican police have termed Sara Aldrete, the missing 24-year-old
college student believed to be one of the cult leaders, a ``witch.''
   She has been linked to the 15 victims of the cult, some of which
were unearthed at a ranch south of the U.S. border last week.
   ``It's very loose terminology,'' said Cabot. ``These were drug
runners. What they were doing had nothing to do with witchcraft.
Witchcraft has no evil gods.''
   Cabot described witchcraft as a ``nature religion'' that uses a
mixture of astronomy, astrology and psychic powers to heal and make
things better. She said they use potions and cast spells to promote
well-being and general good.
   ``We have families, we have children, I belong to Kiwanis and
the Chamber of Commerce, you know,'' said Cabot, who once owned a
witchcraft store in Salem and is now writing books.
   She said the group hopes to ``re-educate'' people through the
complaints but added that they could someday take court action if
they believe their rights have been seriously violated.
