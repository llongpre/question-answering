THREE HUNDRED years ago on Tuesday an execution took place at Gallows Hill
near Salem Village, Massachusetts, which has since haunted America's
national consciousness. Seven women and a man were hanged for witchcraft,
mainly on the evidence of a group of village girls who were apparently
suffering fits and seizures after experimenting with the occult.
These victims turned down the chance to save their lives by confessing their
guilt. Three days earlier 80-year-old Giles Cory had been crushed to death,
with stones piled on his chest, for refusing even to plead before the
special court set up to try these innocent people. Up to this point, 20 men
and women, mostly humble people, had been executed at Salem.
This started an epidemic of denunciations and arrests in nearby towns,
during which more than 100 suspects languished in makeshift jails. The Devil
was abroad among God's people in New England, many of whom came to believe
that he might deceive judges as well as witches.
Tourists who watch reconstructions of Cory's death (complete with recorded
groans) at the Salem Witch Museum may see those events as belonging to a
remote and primitive culture. Yet now thousands of people openly choose to
be witches, attending covens and practising rituals. Thousands of books for
children are about witches, either benign or terrifying. Horror movies bare
their fangs at every other cinema and fill the video shops, while books and
magazines on the occult proliferate.
Although this explosion of interest in Satanism is mostly ersatz, recent
historical research is transforming our understanding of witchcraft in the
Western past and often suggests more disturbing parallels with modern
events.
It now seems that the most famous reincarnation of the witches of 1692, in
Arthur Miller's powerful play, The Crucible, may be a misleading view of the
true cause and significance of the witch hunt. For Miller, the victims of
Salem stand for the individual conscience against theocracy and 'the
repressions of order', with explicit reference to the odious Senator
McCarthy and his anti-communist crusade in the 1950s. Now, 40 years later,
even more sinister parallels spring to mind.
Witchcraft is back among us with a vengeance when families are torn apart on
charges of Satanic rituals supposedly attested by their own children. In the
UK, a series of ritual abuse cases were supposedly discovered by social
service investigators in the Orkney Islands and then in Rochdale, northern
England. These followed an epidemic of sexual abuse cases in Cleveland in
1987. In spite of obvious differences, these cases showed a strangely
similar pattern to that in Salem three centuries before: intense questioning
of children to produce the denunciation of adults; the inner certainty of
interrogators that evil practices were widespread; passionate denials of
guilt; and failures to obey the ordinary rules of evidence.
Miller focused on the principled defiance of theocracy by John Procter, a
man who, having fallen from grace through adultery with his maidservant,
finally tore up the confession that would have saved him, thus gaining a
moral victory over his persecutors. However, the true story of the hidden
evil in Salem Village is more subtle and has only been apparent since the
publication of a brilliant book by two young American historians, Paul Boyer
and Stephen Nissenbaum, called Salem Possessed, which finally fitted the
jigsaw together.
As Miller partly understood, the central issues were to do with the nature
of the community and the power struggle between individuals within it. Salem
Village (now Danvers) was the agricultural hinterland of the thriving port
of Salem, a dependent region lacking proper institutions and struggling even
to create its own church. The community was split between those linked to
the cosmopolitan, commercial world of the town and the poorer, less
sophisticated farmers further inland. There were two rival families from the
initial settlement: the Porters, who had grown rich from the town, and the
Putnams, whose land was being subdivided among too many children.
The epicentre of the witch hunt lay in the house of Thomas Putnam, eldest
son in the third generation. His wife and daughter were prominent among the
group of 'possessed' women. It was this group which gave the crucial
evidence of witchcraft, partly to protect themselves against suspicions of
satanic practices. They cried out in court that they had been tormented by
the accused and described visions which were held to prove that the accused
had made pacts with Devil to take possession of their souls. Putnam and his
family were the main supporters of Samuel Parris, minister of Salem Village,
another man on the economic downslope. Parris's insecurities did much to fan
the blaze of the witch hunt.
Thomas Putnam was a man with many grievances, much given to unsuccessful
lawsuits. One alleged he had been cheated over his wife's inheritance,
another - the vital one - was against his stepmother and his half-brother,
Joseph. His father had left his best land to this favoured child of his old
age, who had just married into the rival Porter family, and ostentatiously
sided with them in local politics.
Although they were never directly accused, these treacherous relatives and
the Porters were the real target for the family's anger. Almost every
accused person in the Salem trials can be connected with them in some way,
just as all the accusers were Putnams and their allies. It is highly
unlikely that there was a deliberate conspiracy. Since the weak were
attacking the strong, they could only do so in surrogate form - by imagining
a diabolical conspiracy.
Resistance began to mount when charges extended to people of real substance.
By the autumn of 1692, the leading Puritan ministers in the colony and the
Governor intervened to halt the trials; those in prison were freed.
Over the next 20 years various acts of public penance would try to atone for
what the Boston minister Cotton Mather, who was consulted about procedures
for the trials, called: 'Those errors whereby great hardships were brought
upon innocent persons, and (we fear) guilt incurred which we have all cause
to bewail with much confusion of face before the Lord.' Puritans knew how to
repent with a sincerity and force rarely shown by modern persecutors.
The persecution proved a disaster for its makers. Parris lost his position
as minister and any hopes of personal recovery. Within a generation the
surviving Putnams (other than the prosperous Joseph) had sold their
dwindling property and left.
Witchcraft prosecutions had rarely been much favoured by the churches, and
played little part in maintaining their authority, in either the old world
or the new. So the analogy conjured by the modern term 'witch hunt' - with
the show trials of Stalin or McCarthy is weak. Similarly, the traditional
witchcraft the colonists had brought from England bore little relation to
modern imitations. This 'old witchcraft' still exists in parts of rural
Europe, where a belief that one is bewitched has been known to cause death.
As recently as 1976 two brothers in Orne in France shot dead the male
'witch' they blamed for their misfortunes.
Then, as now, the basis of witchcraft had little to do with formal religion.
It is in a general sense pagan, with an immensely long history. By
comparison, the persecution of witchcraft was brief; after a scattering of
early trials in the 15th century, most executions in Europe took place
between 1580 and 1650. In all between 50,000 and 100,000 people were put to
death as witches.
Between a fifth and a quarter of these were men, while midwives, always said
to be especially vulnerable, were in fact rarely prosecuted. Educated
witch-hunters played only a marginal role; they were probably no more
representative of elite opinion than the zealous pursuers of ritual Satanism
are today. Most witches went on trial because their neighbours, who hated
and feared them, blamed them for specific misfortunes - usually the deaths
of spouses, children or animals - following a quarrel. Behind it all lay not
the clergy but their rivals, the local wizards and wise-women who functioned
as witch-doctors and were skilled in making clients articulate their
suspicions.
Population growth, economic change and harvest failures made the decades
around the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries some of the harshest ever
experienced by the ordinary people of Europe. It was natural that
accusations should multiply, and this would not have mattered so much if the
reaction had been confined to counter-magic and the occasional lynching.
Unfortunately, the pressure from below coincided with a temporary decline in
elite scepticism. The reasons for this are complex, but it should be
stressed that it was very relative. Critics of witchcraft prosecutions were
numerous and soon became more vocal, as happened in Massachusetts.
Accusations of diabolical possession was seen as particularly dangerous, for
fraud was readily suspected and quite often detected. Another famous case
was that of the Devils of Loudun in 1634, where a group of 'possessed' nuns
accused a local priest who was burned at the stake.
A sober look at witchcraft in history strips away almost all the
pseudo-historical clothing in which the modern witch cults have tried to
deck themselves. Some of their rituals and gods do have origins in pagan
culture, but the witches' 'sabbat', (a nocturnal Satanic meeting) existed
only in the imaginary world of folklore.
It is striking that many of the most lurid accounts in witchcraft trials
came from children and adolescents. This should be a reminder of the danger
of accepting their testimony in modern allegations of satanic practices. One
does not care to think too long on the nine-year-old girl from Lorraine who
told stories about going to the 'sabbat' in a cart with her whole family, as
a result of which her father, grandparents, uncle and aunt were all burned
in 1602. In later years she might have whispered to her confessor something
akin to the moving words of Ann Putnam Jr. when she was admitted to church
membership in 1706: 'I desire to lie in the dust and be humbled for it, in
that I was a cause with others of so sad a calamity to them and their
families.'
It is a poignant reminder that the real evil lies within ourselves, as much
in the age of child abuse as in that of 'demonic' possession.
