Some observers and art lovers are fretting over whether people who make art are 
going to turn timid in the face of congressional inquiries into federal arts 
funding. National Endowment for the Arts budget cuts today, rampant censorship 
tomorrow: That's the worst scenario, but, some feel, not an outlandish one. 
Will artists start reasoning that it's better to play it safe right now, until 
all this blows over -- thus employing a subtle form of censorship? Will they be 
hit with their own case of "The Wimp Factor"? 
</P>
<P>
A few may, but don't count on performance artist Curtis York. A former student 
of Utah's Weber State College and the University of Utah, York came to Los 
Angeles with $50 in his pocket to study with performance artist Rachel 
Rosenthal. After four years of presenting his own and others' work, York, 26, 
who wears leather clothes and sports a Mohawk haircut, has regularly stirred up 
controversy -- and some anger -- with a collection of politically provocative 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the working title of a piece planned for Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions: "Autoeroticurtis." Or his latest, at Highways in 
Santa Monica: "The United States of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
That's nothing compared to an early working title, which was -- Jesse Helms, 
are you listening? -- "Flaming Faggot, Burning Witch." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, York hopes that Helms, or one of his local allies, is listening. 
"This is especially meant for right-wing Christians to see. If their faith is 
strong enough, hearing a little truth about history won't shake it." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, York warns: "The time to be polite is over. No one can tell 
artists what they can and can't do." 
</P>
<P>
It is a careful tightrope York is walking with "The United States of Christ." 
With his collaborator and longtime friend, author Frosti, the professional name 
of Scott Simpson, York says his intent is to deliver a warning against trying 
to bridge the separation of church and state as well as deliver a theatrical 
message of tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Not an easy trick, considering the charged emotions surrounding some of the 
show's themes, such as abortion rights, and freedom of expression. Though a 
scene shows one of York's characters (he plays 15 in all), a Roman Catholic 
priest, flagellating himself to sexual ecstasy after flubbing a Communion 
ceremony, he also states: "I can't stress enough that this isn't an 
anti-Christian piece." 
</P>
<P>
Performance artist Rosenthal said, "He puts himself on the line morally and 
politically. His pieces are strong, but they're never a lecture. As a gay man, 
he feels threatened by religious fanatics and others who would suppress him. He 
has a fearlessness for confronting hard issues." 
</P>
<P>
York's use of complex and clashing currents in his work is consistent, even 
when it means disturbing his audience and friends. He freely admits that his 
1989 show, "Blackout," was "very sacrilegious and upset a lot of people." In 
response to "Meet the Mormons," which York, targeting the Mormon Church, 
performed last year with Robert Daniels at Highways, one letter writer to The 
Times condemned the show for "attacking prejudice with prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Frosti, York's pal since high school, said he was very offended by it, and told 
York as much. "I knew that Curtis was coming from deep personal pain when he 
did that show, but the Mormon Church as a whole shouldn't have been held 
responsible for some of his terrible experiences. Individuals should have. We 
were both raised in that religion. He had bad experiences; I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
But, York reveals that after staging "Meet the Mormons" he went through "a 
forgiveness process. I forgave the Mormons I knew growing up, and I forgave 
myself." In many ways, that performance was the catalyst for "The United States 
of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
Another was Frosti's research, triggered by his involvement in the pro-choice 
movement, into Roman Catholic Church history. Meanwhile, York had been 
performing in others' pieces, notably John Fleck's "Blessed Are All the Little 
Fishes" and the Peter Brosius/Dennis Cooper/Ishmael Houston-Jones work, "The 
Undead" (at the Mark Taper Forum's 1989 Taper Lab and planned for the Los 
Angeles Festival in September). 
</P>
<P>
"I was incredibly busy," York said, "but the ideas emerging out of Frosti's 
research demanded to be played out before an audience." Delving into Vatican 
history as a model of what happens when a religious institution assumes the 
power of the state, Frosti found useful material in books such as "Vicars of 
Christ: The Dark Side of the Papacy" by ex-priest Peter De Rosa and "Outline of 
Ecclesiastical History" by B.H. Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
A theatrical strategy emerged from the research, which was to draw parallels 
(through various characters York portrayed) between past and present. So such 
episodes as the Catholic involvement in the Inquisition, or the Vatican's 
ability to tax many of the royal courts of Europe, are interwoven with American 
Christian fundamentalist efforts to institutionalize school prayer, ban books 
or make abortion illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Why focus on Catholicism? "We're artists in the Western tradition," said York, 
"and the Catholic Church has been a powerful political force in the West. It's 
what we know. But there's a broader concern, and that is to show that it's not 
healthy for people to practice religious fascism and not know history. 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised a Christian and with Christianity's humane morals, and I'm glad 
of that. It would be cool if everyone followed the Golden Rule -- 'Do unto 
others . . . ' -- which is what the faith comes down to. But when one's beliefs 
cross over from personal choices to attempts to influence others' choices, that 
is going too far." 
</P>
<P>
When York added that "no one should be prevented from practicing their 
religion," he meant this in a personal way. As a witch and follower of the 
Wicca faith, an earth-based religion, he is cognizant of the legacy of the 
persecution of witches by more traditional religions. "Nothing more could be 
done to my religion than has already been done to it." 
</P>
<P>
He winced reporting the methods of torture of suspected homosexuals during the 
Inquisition in Spain, France and Italy, revealed by Frosti's research. York 
said the show is "including historical material that hasn't been presented 
publicly before." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, York would like to go even more public than he already has. He 
would like to go back out on the road, possibly disturbing audiences along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I want to be internationally famous or anything," he said 
sheepishly, "but I think the content in my pieces deserves to be heard by more 
people than in L.A. and New York. I'd like to go off the usual performance art 
circuit, into cities like Tucson and Boise. There are open-minded people there, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States of Christ" continues at Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa 
Monica, today and April 1, 8:30 p.m. Tickets: $10. (213) 453-1755.
