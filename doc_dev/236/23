   Our friends at the ACLU's national office try to impress on us from time to time that the ACLU is a "decentralized" organization. 
A few more cases like the following, and we may have to sign on to this explanation. 
The ACLU in Providence, Rhode Island, got a tax administrator to rule that a coven of witches is entitled to the same tax-exempt treatment as any established religion. 
"With this ruling," said the high priestess of Rosegate Coven, "we witches will definitely be able to come out of the closet and take our place in society." 
Who would doubt it? 
If the IRS doesn't drive a stake through this latest ACLU creation, expect more Americans to declare themselves operators of a "religion."
