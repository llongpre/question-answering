   Ipsita Roy Chakrabarty, self-described
witch and former schoolteacher, is accusing officials of failing to
protect witches in West Bengal state, where at least 20 suspected
sorcerers were murdered last year.
   The 44-year-old housewife went public Saturday after Chief
Minister Jyoti Basu, the top government official of West Bengal
state, disclosed the slayings during a discussion on crime in the
state.
   ``Are we repeating and perpetrating the misdeeds and mistakes of
medieval Europe ?'' Mrs. Chakrabarty said. ``Why is there nobody to
call the killing of witches in present-day India brutal and
superstitious ?''
   Basu, who heads the Communist Marxist Party in West Bengal, said
April 27 that at least 27 people had been arrested in the killings
of the suspected witches in the eastern state, which borders
Bangladesh.
   Basu had no details on how the women were killed or who was
arrested, but he said the women were slain only because they were
suspected of practicing witchcraft.
   Tribal members in parts of West Bengal believe that many women,
especially widows, have the power to heal the sick and the ability
to cast evil spells. Women thought to be witches often are attacked
when misfortune befalls members of the tribe.
   ``There is no such woman as the storybook witch,'' Mrs.
Chakrabarty told a news conference in Calcutta, capital of West
Bengal state.
   ``It is unthinkable that Jyoti Basu, leading a Marxist
government which believes neither in God nor the devil, should
nonchalantly reel out figures of the murders of innocent women as a
piece of statistics.''
   Mrs. Chakrabarty said she is the eastern high priestess of a
Montreal-based coven, which she refused to identify further.
   She told reporters that she lived in the Canadian city when she
was a young woman before returning to her parents' home in Calcutta
in 1968 to complete her education. She majored in English
literature and taught at a prestigious secondary school before her
marriage.
   Her husband is a government official, but she prefers not to
publicize his name and job title for fear of repercussions. The
couple has a 10-year-old daughter.
   ``Witchcraft is not black magic, and it need not necessarily be
evil,'' Mrs. Chakrabarty said. ``It can be misused, but that
depends on the practitioner. Any science can be evil if put into
the wrong hands.
   ``I, as the high priestess of a witches' coven, claim that we
have worked successfully for the benefit of individuals who have
been suffering from various disorders,'' she said. ``We are not
superwomen, but we have succeeded in helping where conventional
science has failed.''
   Mrs. Chakrabarty said witches use water electrically charged by
touch or rock quartz to cure the sick.
   ``Our touch can calm. Our eyes can comfort or impart energy if
the need be so,'' she said. ``We believe that the powers we invoke
from the outer elements charge us with a certain strength, which
can pass onto others.''
