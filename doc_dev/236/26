<LEADPARA>  A national organization at the forefront of First Amendment challenges has
filed suit in Sacramento to block the Woodland Joint Unified School District's
use of parts of the controversial Impressions textbook series.;    The
Mississippi-based American Family Association, which has been involved with
the recent 2 Live Crew and National Endowment for the Arts controversies, said
the suit could provide leverage against other school districts that use the
series.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The complaint, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court on behalf of two
Woodland parents, is believed to be the first in California to challenge the
content of the textbook series. It contends that Impressions "endorses and
sponsors the religion of Wicca or Witchcraft" and "violates the First
Amendment's Establishment of Religion Clause." The suit requests an injunction
against use of "occultic portions of the curriculum.";    Scott Thomas, a San
Jose attorney, said, "By requiring participation in religious activity, the
state through the school district is sponsoring religion." Thomas is serving
as local counsel in the suit for the AFA, a conservative Christian watch-dog
organization. Bob Watt, superintendent for the Yolo County district, said
Wednesday that he had not seen the lawsuit and could not discuss it.;   
Impressions has been adopted for use in elementary schools in about 70
California districts. More than 20 districts have faced attempts to have the
series banned and four have returned the books to the publisher, Holt,
Rinehart and Winston. The publishing house is a subsidiary of Harcourt, Brace,
Jovanovich.;    In the South Bay, parents have complained about the books in
the Saratoga Union School District, which uses the series in kindergarten
through fifth grades, and the Campbell Union School District, where the series
is a supplement to the core literature program in kindergarten through fourth
grades. Thomas is a parent in Campbell and has opposed the use of the series
there.;    The books were challenged last year by parents in Union City's New
Haven Unified School District, too, but the district retained the texts.;   
Impressions, a colorful collection of classic and contemporary children's
literature, has won vehement supporters and opponents nationwide since its
introduction in the mid-1980s. Supporters praise it for engaging student minds
with quality literature rather than "dumbing-down" the writing. Opponents say
the books are too violent or graphic, encourage witchcraft or Satanism and
don't have enough "American-oriented" stories.;    The suit brought by the AFA
is believed to be only the second one in the country to challenge the content
of the books. The AFA brought a similar suit late last year against a district
in Ohio.;    The implications for other districts remain unclear. Elliot
Mincberg, legal director for the censorship watchdog group People for the
American Way, said, "It reflects an attempt to open up another front in this
cultural civil war.";    While the growing controversy may inhibit some
districts elsewhere from trying the series, the books are already so
controversial in California that the suit may have little impact, he said.
Mincberg said the AFA's claims about the books are "without basis."  </TEXT>
