   Witchcraft is not uncommon in Mexico, where
open air markets sell magic amulets and powders and where one can
easily hire a witch to cast a spell on a rival.
   But an anthropologist consulted Tuesday said satanic rituals are
rare. Police believe such rituals were performed in the killings of
12 people in the northern border city of Matamoros.
   The bodies, including that of a 21-year-old University of Texas
student, were discovered in a mass grave Tuesday on a ranch just
south of the U.S.-Mexico border.
   Police said a satanic cult of drug smugglers killed them in
hopes that human sacrifice would protect them.
   ``This is the most horrible thing ever seen in the city's
history,'' said Enriqueta Hernandez, a reporter covering the story
for the Matamoros daily El Bravo. ``This is more like something you
would hear about in Veracruz or Oaxaca.''
   The southern states of Veracruz and Oaxaca are known for their
large numbers of ``brujos'', or witches, and their occult rites.
   But even in those areas, the rites are not considered
``satanic'' because they have no connection with the Christian
devil. The witches may sacrifice animals such as black-feathered
roosters, but ritual killings of human beings are almost unheard of.
   American anthropologists William and Claudia Medsen
differentiate between Mexico's traditional Indian witches and what
they call ``satanic witches'' in their 1969 book ``The American
Guide to Mexican Witchcraft.''
   ``The satanic witchcraft practiced in cities and towns is a far
cry from Indian witchcraft, although this distinction has been
ignored by anthropologists,'' they wrote. ``Indian witchcraft has
little or no connection with the Christian devil, who dominates the
suburban sorcery scene.
   ``The most feared witches in urban Mexico are those who make
pacts with the devil. A satanic witch voluntarily sells his soul to
the devil in exchange for wealth and power,'' the book says.
   An anthropologist at the National Anthropology and History
Institute said satanic cults are rare in Mexico because they are
elitist and expensive, in part because of drugs used in the
ceremonies.
   ``From colonial times, it never was successful'' in Mexico, said
the anthropologist, who asked that her name not be used.
   On the other hand, herbal medicine and use of witch doctors,
called ``curanderos,'' is common in Mexico. Most markets have
stalls where herbs are sold for cures, to cast or remove good or
bad spells or to cleanse a home of evil.
   Human sacrifice was common in the country's pre-Columbian Indian
cultures; the Aztecs killed thousands every year, usually captured
enemy soldiers, and practiced cannibalism.
   Human sacrifice is little known now, although not unheard of. It
is said to be used occasionally in rituals in which one person is
killed as part of the process of curing another.
   Tomas Rojas, a police reporter for the Mexico City tabloid La
Prensa, said one of the few cases he had heard of involved the
slaying of an unidentifed man whose headless body was discovered
about three months ago next to a hill in the northern part of the
city.
   Rojas said officials found the body near a circle of stones
enclosing a triangle. The head was found on the other side of the
hill.
