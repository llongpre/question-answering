   The killings linked to an alleged voodoo cult
of drug smugglers appear to be part of mixture of rites with
African and European elements, an anthropologist said Wednesday.
   Although human sacrifices were performed regularly in
pre-Columbian times, ``human ritual slayings are unheard of in
modern Mexico,'' said Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the
Veracruz Museum of Anthropology in Xalapa.
   ``Animal sacrifices are very common, however, as part of the
widespread superstition and witchcraft that exists in Mexico
nowadays,'' Winfield said in a telephone interview.
   Police in Matamoros, just across the border from Brownsville,
Texas, have uncovered more than a dozen human bodies apparently
used by drug smugglers practicing voodoo rites popularly known as
santeria.
   The smugglers apparently tried to offer the souls of others,
human and animal, to protect themselves from arrest and harm.
   Police had arrested several people and were looking on Wednesday
for the alleged ringleader, a Cuban in his late 40s named Adolfo de
Jesus Constanzo.
   U.S. officials say Constanzo apparently introduced elements of
santeria, a Caribbean Hispanic version of voodoo influenced by
Roman Catholicism, to the area.
   Police said the victims' bodies were mutilated and that they
found candles and kettles full of body parts and animal bones in
the ranch.
   ``I'll have to have more information and maybe look for myself
before I can analyze this further, but from what I saw on
television last night this doesn't seem to be any Mexican occult
ritual,'' said Winfield, who specializes in pre-Hispanic cultures
and their religious influence in modern times.
   ``They seem to be a Russian salad of rites from various satanic
cults which the people indulged in, probably crazed by drugs,'' he
said.
   Winfield said ``lamps'' found at the ranch were actually small
shot glasses blackened with soot and filled with wax, with a wick
stuck in the middle.
   ``These are quite common in Mexican witchcraft and are typical
of the European-Roman Catholic black magic rites inherited from
Europe,'' he said. ``But other elements like the kettles seem part
of the Haitian-African rituals practiced in many places, including
Cuba.''
   Winfield said the African rituals were brought by slaves from
Africa and adapted locally to the Catholic religion. In Brazil it's
known as ``macumbe,'' and in the Hispanic Caribbean, it's called
santeria.
   ``They vary from place to place, but the main elements are
almost all the same,'' Winfield said.
   Santeria is well-known in Florida's Latin community, especially
since 125,000 Cubans immigrated from the Cuban port of Mariel in
1980. Animal rights activists there have complained that
practitioners torture animals and may steal and slaughter pets.
   Santeria priests say animal sacrifice is legal under Florida law
if done humanely. Priests say they kill only chickens, pigs or
goats _ never cats or dogs _ and dispose of remains in a sanitary
manner.
   Southern Florida has dozens of santeria shops, called
``botanicas,'' that sell statues of gods, books of incantations,
colored beads and scents.
   In Mexican marketplaces, herbs and other items are sold for
witchcraft and the work of witch doctors, who are powerful figures
in rural areas where Indians still live much the way they did
before the Spanish came.
   During the Aztec Indian empire and other earlier cultures,
priests sacrificed slaves or prisoners of war to the gods by
cutting their hearts out or flaying or skinning them alive.
   ``Usually this involved a ceremony, usually a fertility rite,''
Winfield said.
   ``In modern Mexico witchcraft is very common and there are two
types _ black magic, which mainly tries to cause harm to an enemy,
and white magic, which seeks to do good like curing a disease,'' he
said.
   ``And, yes ... it is common to sacrifice animals like black
roosters,'' Winfield said.
