   EDITOR'S NOTE _ To hear some of them tell it, there are more
witches in North America than you can shake a broom at. One of them
is an American who emigrated to Canada, a high priest of Wicca who
is campaigning for witches' rights. Among other things, he wants a
license to perform weddings.

   He's a Vietnam veteran who spends quiet evenings
watching Cary Grant movies and would like to be reincarnated as
Fred Astaire.
   But Charles Arnold is also Canada's most visible witch, a
second-degree high priest of Wicca, the religion of witchcraft.
   ``I don't melt if water is poured over me,'' says the
40-year-old clerical worker who is campaigning for legal acceptance
of his beliefs in both a male and female divinity, the potency of
magic and absence of original sin.
   Arnold began the quest last year when he asked his boss for paid
religious leave on the Wiccan holidays of ``Samhain,'' Nov. 1, when
witches celebrate the mortality of the body and immortality of the
soul, and ``Belthane,'' May 1, welcoming summer, life and fertility.
   Humber College of Applied Arts and Technology, which employs
Arnold in its hospitality office, denied his request because Wicca
is not recognized by the Canadian Council of Churches and lacks
tax-free charitable status.
   Arnold protested to a labor arbitration board which upheld his
grievance and said: ``Wicca is obviously a religion...the modern
survival of the ancient pagan religions of Western Europe.''
   But Arnold's victory was short-lived.
   The native of Washington, D.C., who served a year in Vietnam,
became an anti-war activist and emigrated to Canada 15 years ago,
had also applied for a license to become the first Canadian witch
authorized to perform weddings.
   In a March ruling, the Ontario registrar-general's office turned
him down. It questioned the legitimacy of his ordination and the
nature of the Wiccan marriage ritual, known as a ``handfasting.''
   Arnold blamed Ontario's Protestant establishment, although
Council of Churches official Edith Shore showed some sympathy for
the Wiccans. ``Christianity was a fringe group when it started,
too,'' she said.

   Arnold complained that the Marriage Act discriminates against
Canada's 5,000 witches by making it a crime, punishable by up to
six months in jail, to perform an unauthorized wedding.
   ``They should either license me or do away with the law
altogether,'' he said, noting that Wiccan weddings are permitted in
38 U.S. states. He had to travel to Montpelier, Vt., for his own
Wiccan wedding three years ago.
   The practice of witchcraft is fairly widespread in the United
States, but precise numbers are hard to come by.
   ``It's everywhere, every big city probably has a group,'' says
the Rev. W. M. Kent Burtner, a Dominican priest based in Portland,
Ore., who studies cults. ``I see it basically as a nature religion
not associated with Satanism, but that may be skewed because of
whom I get to meet as a Catholic priest. It's a write-your-own
theology sort of a approach and it runs a real broad spectrum.''
   Lady Sabrina, a high priestess in Nashua, N.H., estimates there
are ``a couple of hundred thousand'' members scattered across the
United States, including ``a couple of thousand'' high priests and
priestesses.
   Starhawk, a San Francisco high priestess and author of ``The
Spiral Dance,'' a book about Wicca, largely agrees.
   ``I just had a conversation with someone and we decided that
there were between 250,000 and 4 million of us,'' she says. The 4
million, she explains, would include all pagans.
   ``In any case,'' she says, ``there are more of us than there are
Unitarians.''
   Starhawk says many members are underground.
   ``There is a long tradition where it is not safe to be a
witch,'' she says. ``We don't necessarily announce it. Many
people's jobs would be in jeopardy.''
   Starhawk, an author and lecturer, teaches at a Catholic college
in Oakland, Calif. Her most recent book is ``Truth or Dare
Encounters with Power, Authority and Mystery.''
   Lady Sabrina runs Our Lady of Enchantment, a Wicca mail order
school with 6,000 members representing 25 countries.
