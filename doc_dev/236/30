<LEADPARA>  Depending on which section of the Wiccan sisterhood grabs your interest,
Tuesday was Beltane, May Eve, Walpurgis Night, Cyntefyn, Roodmass or
Cethsamhain. In Czechoslovakia it was the annual "Burning of the Witches,"
which is why these Prague women put on their rock groupie outfits and went
frolicking on the banks of the Vitava River. In ancient Scotland, Beltane was
the day rents were due and debts settled. . . . We like the Czechoslovak idea
better.  </LEADPARA>
