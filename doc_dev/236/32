   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Law enforcement journals are describing a
``satanic threat'' in America and seminars on occult crime are
attracting hundreds of police officers in cities across the
country. While some experts insist the threat has been exaggerated,
the Matamoros slayings have rekindled the debate.

   The ritual slayings of 15 people by a
drug-smuggling ring in northern Mexico underscore the need for
police to be trained to recognize the signs of all kinds of occult
crime, according to a growing group of ``cult cops.''
   While the Matamoros slayings apparently had nothing to do with
devil worship, satanism has become a hot topic in law enforcement
circles.
   Law enforcement officials nationwide note an increase in reports
of satanic grafitti, animal mutilations and signs that occult
rituals have taken place. But some say the threat is being
exaggerated.
   Nonetheless, a seminar on satanism and crime sponsored by the
Connecticut State Police last month attracted more than 300 police
officers from all over New England who wanted to learn how to
distinguish serious satanists from teen-age pranksters and how to
respond to each.
   Sober law enforcement journals are running articles describing a
``satanic threat'' and telling police how to spot evidence at crime
scenes that might be overlooked by those unfamiliar with cult
practices.
   Among the new breed of cult cops, sometimes derided as
``ghostbusters'' by their colleagues, is Detective Sgt. Alan L.
Alves of Freetown. Alves has never made an arrest for a satanic
crime and has found no evidence of human sacrifices. But he's
convinced such ritual murders are occurring.
   ``The organized satanists leave absolutely no evidence,'' Alves
says. ``They're killing. That's what they believe in. They have to
make sacrifices. They're killing babies.''
   The Matamoros killings were not related to satanism, according
to Thomas Wedge, a former Union, Ohio, deputy sheriff and the
author of ``The Satan Hunter.'' Wedge makes his living lecturing
about satanism, mainly to law enforcement groups.
   Wedge, reached in Baton Rouge, La., where he was conducting a
seminar for the state police, said the Matamoros killers were
practicing a black magic version of brujeria, an Afro-Caribbean
religion.
   ``This is not an isolated case by any means,'' he said, adding
that he knows of at least one other ritual killing by drug dealers.
   Wedge said brujeria is practiced by many Cuban criminals who
came to the United States on the Mariel boat lift.
   Other experts dispute Wedge's contention that brujeria was to
blame.
   Among them is Robert D. Hicks, a criminal justice analyst for
the state of Virginia, and a former police officer in Tucson,
Ariz., where he had firsthand experience with drug smugglers and
brujeria, which gets its name from the Spanish word for witch _
brujo.
   Brujo, who are found in the Caribbean, Mexico and in Hispanic
communities all over the United States, are witch doctors or wise
men who may also practice some magic, Hicks says, but the vast
majority are peaceful and law-abiding.
   Hicks says the Matamoros killers may have drawn on elements of
the religion to promise their followers magical immunity to
bullets. Or, the cult leaders, including Alfonso de Jesus
Constanzo, a Cuban-American, may have just had an appetite for
blood and wanted to terrorize competitors and police.
   ``In northern Mexico, drug trafficking is intensely
competitive,'' Hicks says. ``Nobody knows at the moment if
Constanzo actually has some deep, abiding faith that pushed him to
commit these crimes, or if he was just a slick operator who made it
up as he went along.''
   Hicks, who is writing a book critical of the ``satanism scare''
in law enforcement circles, says the real danger is that police may
begin trampling on the religious freedoms of those who practice
non-Christian beliefs, even though there is no evidence of
criminality.
   The FBI's chief expert on cult crime, Kenneth V. Lanning, and
other law enforcement officials contacted around the country said
there is no solid evidence that crimes committed by satan
worshipers are on the increase in America.
   ``I question whether there is a true increase,'' says Lanning,
supervisory special agent at the FBI's behavioral sciences unit in
Quantico, Va., who is frequently contacted by local officials
seeking help on cases with cult overtones.
   But Wedge insists satanists have been thriving on police
ignorance and disbelief.
   ``It doesn't really matter what you or I believe,'' Wedge says.
``It's what they believe that's dangerous.''
   Connecticut state police have noticed an increase in the number
of phone callers reporting satanic activity, particularly around
Halloween.
   ``We've only had incidents of things that could be classified as
a bona fide satanic ritual, and those things did not involve any
criminal acts except minor things like criminal trespass or illegal
bonfires,'' says Sgt. Scott O'Mara.
