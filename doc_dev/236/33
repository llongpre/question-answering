   For a mystery writer, there's probably
nothing more mysterious than Navajo culture. Author Tony Hillerman
is fascinated by it, and so, apparently, are his readers.
   Coming off his second straight New York Times best seller,
``Talking God,'' Hillerman continues to examine Indian cultural
themes in ``Coyote Waits,'' due for publication in June.
   A Navajo shaman is a pivotal figure in ``Coyote Waits.'' In
``The Dark Wind,'' the first of Hillerman's books destined for
film, Hopi religion comes into play. In ``Dance Hall of the Dead''
it is Zuni religion. In ``The Blessing Way'' and ``Skinwalkers''
Navajo witchcraft is a central theme.
   Navajo police Lt. Joe Leaphorn, Hillerman's main character, is a
skeptic about witchcraft, but in several books he refers back to
one of his early cases in which he failed to take it seriously and
several people lost their lives.
   In a recent interview, Hillerman said witchcraft is real enough
and common enough to the Navajo. Navajo acquaintances have given
him several anecdotes, but there are many examples in scholarly
literature, as well.
   Hillerman related a story one Navajo once told him about seeing
a witch.
   ``It always takes place in the evening or night,'' Hillerman
said. ``It was shearing time, lambing time, and it was one of those
copper sunsets. Right on the horizon a quarter-mile or so away, he
saw the witch, a skinwalker with the head of a coyote.''
   The boy's grandmother told him to run and get his .22-caliber
rifle, and the youth took a shot at the witch.
   ``I asked him, `Did you hit him, Kenneth?' He said, `Nah, it was
a Navajo .22.'''
   Another anecdote involves an elderly weaver who called in a
crystal gazer to counteract a witch. A Durango, Colo., businessman
and his wife drove the gazer out to the woman's home and watched as
he did his ritual, Hillerman said. Staring into the crystal, the
gazer claimed the witch was a neighbor and had buried something
down the road, presumably to cause her a problem.
   ``The wife sat next to the crystal gazer and got a real strange
look on her face,'' Hillerman said. ``She said, `My God, it was
just like watching television.' She saw the same things in the
crystal that he was describing.''
   Then they went to the spot in the road, and the gazer dug up the
thing.
   ``In the Navajo culture, all goals are toward harmony, being
peaceful, working together. People who turn against this are the
worst kind of people,'' he said.
   Hillerman, who says he has learned most of what he knows about
Navajos from books, has a framed drawing of Navajo ceremonial masks
above his desk. Each mask personifies a yei, or Navajo god. And the
ceremonies and masks continually turn up in his books.
   Kokopelli, the Water Sprinkler, is a key image in ``A Thief of
Time.'' A sacred mask of Talking God kept at the Smithsonian
Institution becomes a lethal weapon in the 1989 novel, ``Talking
God.'' And such rituals as the Blessing Way, the Enemy Way and
others give texture and color to Hillerman's stories, which mix
gentle Navajo traditions with the jarring intrusion of hard-edged
Anglo culture.
   For the latter, the author said, all he needs to do is read the
newspaper.
