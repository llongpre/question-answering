   In Turin, Italy, the Roman Catholic Church has
six official exorcists to cast out demons. Magicians, seers, faith
healers, mind readers, astrologers and others dabbling in the
occult advertise regularly on television. Has Satan established a
stronghold in the ancient city famous for its religious icons?

   Real or imagined, the devil is tormenting
this sober industrial city in northwestern Italy.
   Some believe a sinister presence lurks in the shadows along the
city's broad, arcaded boulevards and haunts the medieval squares in
the nearby mountain hamlets of the Piedmontese Alps.
   The city likes to be remembered as the former seat of the House
of Savoy dynasty, the first capital of a unified Italy, the resting
place of saints and religious relics, the home of the Fiat auto
empire.
   It's also the home of the Shroud of Turin, which some believe
was the cloth with which Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body of
Jesus Christ after his crucifixion.
   But Turin has a darker reputation as a haven for Satan and his
disciples.
   There is no proof, of course. But what is certain is that the
city has six official exorcists, an underground core of devil
worshipers and thousands of people dealing in the occult.
   Specialists in the occult maintain that Turin forms part of two
``magic'' triangles representing good and evil.
   Along with Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Lyon, France, the city is
reputedly a center of ``white magic,'' a positive force. Turin is
also said to join London and San Francisco as a stronghold of
``black magic,'' which is considered harmful or diabolic.
   ``Turin has always been a place of great spiritual and magical
ferment,'' says Giuditta Dembech, a journalist and author of the
book ``Torino: Citta Magica'' (Turin: Magic City). ``It has some of
the qualities of places like Mecca, Jerusalem and Lourdes.''
   The city first attracted widespread notoriety as a devil's
playground four years ago when Turin's archbishop at the time,
Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero, appointed six official exorcists.
   Exorcism, the process of casting out demons, is an accepted
practice in the Catholic Church. Pope John Paul II has frequently
stated that the devil is a pervasive reality in today's world.
   The naming of the six exorcists in Turin followed a directive
from Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, prefect of the Vatican's
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, for churches to
exercise greater control over exorcisms.
   ``Unfortunately some of our priests had gone a little too far
and were performing exorcisms too hastily,'' says Canon Giuseppe
Ruata, who heads Turin's pool of official exorcists.
   Two events in 1988 further contributed to the city's satanic
image.
   First, the pope spoke of the devil during a visit to Turin,
saying: ``From the history of salvation, we know that where there
are saints there is also another person who presents himself not by
his name but the name of others. He is called the prince of this
world, the demon.''
   Then, a month later, Turin hosted a weeklong conference on
demonology that bitterly divided local politicians, churchmen and
academics.
   Church officials deny Turin has a greater problem with the devil
than any other cities, pointing out that Milan tops Italy with
eight exorcists of its own. Milan has a population of 1.5 million,
compared with Turin's 1 million.
   ``Turin has an image it doesn't deserve,'' Ruata, 74, said in an
interview at the archdiocesan offices. ``I wouldn't make Turin out
to be the capital of the demonic empire.''
   Most agree, however, that Turin has an unusually high number of
magicians, seers, faith healers, mind readers, astrologers and
others dabbling in superstition and witchcraft. They advertise
continuously on private television and radio.
   ``There are more than 100 of these types of agencies in Turin,''
Ruata says. ``They charge $400 as the initial fee for removing a
spell. It's a huge form of trickery.''
