   A jury convicted 23 residents
of a South Pacific atoll who claimed they were swept up by demons
or religious frenzy when they tortured to death six people during a
witch hunt.
   The seven-man, two-woman jury at the Tribunal of Papeete handed
down penalties late Thursday that ranged from three to 14 years
imprisonment for those who participated in the 1987 slayings.
   ``I find these penalties very heavy,'' said Roman Catholic
Archbishop Michel Coppenrath, the highest-ranking church official
in French Polynesia. ``The repentance of the accused is sincere.''
   The defendants, mostly fishermen and farmers from the atoll of
Faaite, showed no reaction when the sentences were read. Another
suspect, a minor, will be judged in a separate proceeding.
   The 14-year sentence went to farmer Francois Mauti, 25, on
convictions of murder, complicity in murder and inflicting mortal
blows. He led a band of disciples that organized the violence in
Sept. 2-4, 1987.
   ``I had a spirit under the spell of the devil,'' Mauti told
Judge Marcel Bihl. ``I lost my head, but I believed I was on the
holy path, shunning the evil fighting within me.''
   During the nine-day trial, the court heard defendants speak of
being swept away by evil spirits or religious enthusiasm as they
hunted down and killed neighbors they thought were possessed.
   The terror had roots in August 1987 visit by three women who
arrived from Tahiti, 300 miles to the west. The women claimed to
represent the Roman Catholic-affiliated movement Christian Renewal,
a group founded in the United States. Church authorities deny they
had any official role in the movement.
   The group already had a strong following on Faaite, a sandy
atoll where about 180 people live. The women, regarded as
``priestesses'' by the islanders, took over the community's
whitewashed church and replaced the lay preacher as the religious
authority.
   The trio's leader, Alexandra Silvia, conducted services in a
trance and told frightened islanders of her visions that God would
abandon Faaite, the defendants said.
   Miss Silvia suggested demons were in their midst, defendants
said, and the population began viewing with suspicion fellow
islanders who failed to attend her daily services.
   ``My words were misinterpreted,'' testified Silvia, a
55-year-old dental secretary who was not charged. ``I only gave
prayers that cured those who were sick.''
   But the defendants said the mood of the once-placid atoll swung
between ecstasy and dread inspired by Silvia and her assistants.
The trio left Faaite in late August and anointed seven disciples to
continue their work.
   A few days later, a 14-year-old boy reported a vision that the
devil had possessed his aunt. The islanders gathered in nightlong
prayer and finally pronounced the demon exorcised.
   They repeated the ritual with two other people. But Ioane
Harris, the assistant mayor, publicly denounced the women on Sept.
2. Maddened villagers twisted a cord around his neck, beat and
drowned him, and threw his body on a bonfire built before the
church.
   ``It was necessary to purify him,'' one defendant said. ``It was
necessary to purify the village.''
   Five more people were killed over the next two days.
   Most islanders took no part in the carnage, but it was Sept. 4
before anyone established contact with Papeete, the capital of
French Polynesia, and reported trouble on the atoll.
   The mayor, who had been on vacation, and a Roman Catholic priest
arrived the next day with police.
   Psychiatric experts testified the emotional charismatic
Christianity, mixed with ancient Polynesian beliefs in the
supernatural, produced a dangerous mass hysteria on an isolated
island lacking institutional authority. The three visitors were not
put on trial because they left Faaite before the murders.
