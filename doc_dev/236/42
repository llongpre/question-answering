   A witch doctor from an indigenous
religious cult announced his candidacy for Venezuela's presidential
election by proclaiming himself the envoy of a local goddess.
   Romulo Abreu Duarte, 52, used drums, the chanting of spells and
two altars to Indian goddess Maria Lionza when he presented himself
Monday to election officials as a candidate of the Venezuelan
Orienting Spiritual Force.
   ``This is a 100 percent spiritual vote and the only one capable
of breaking up the two-party system in the queen Maria Lionza. I am
her envoy so that this mission is fulfilled,'' said Abreu.
   The witch doctor, clad in a business suit and a manatee-tooth
necklace, told reporters, supporters and onlookers that his
decision to run in the December presidential election began with a
revelation that came in a dream.
   The Maria Lionza cult is a mixture of nature-worship, witchcraft
and Catholicism which has thousands of followers in Venezuela who
look toward the legendary Indian chief's daughter for help in
solving problems.
