<TEXT>     Unitarians are more likely to be divorced than are members of other
religious groups.;    And despite all the attention given to what devotees
call the New Age -- a spiritual movement that combines mysticism, psychology
and holistic healing -- the number of adherents, 28,000, is practically
insignificant.;    These findings are from a poll on religious affiliation
that surveyed 113,000 people around the nation, the largest and most
comprehensive effort to draw a portrait of religion in America.;    The
survey, commissioned by the Graduate School of the City University of New
York, confirms that the country is broadly religious and widely diverse, with
more than nine in 10 Americans identifying with one of a myriad of
denominations, from Presbyterian to Rastafarian.;    The survey also shows
regional and racial variations. For example, people in the Western states are
almost twice as likely to have no religion than people in the rest of the
country. The 17 percent of Oregon respondents who said they had no religious
affiliation were the largest such group of any state.;    Every 10 years the
Census Bureau asks Americans their income, their race and even how many
bathrooms they have. But fear of church-state entanglement has kept any
question about religion off the census questionnaire.;    That makes the City
University survey particularly valuable, other poll takers and sociologists
said. Martin Marty, a religion scholar on the faculty at the University of
Chicago, said that before this survey, knowledge of Americans' religious
beliefs had come from the denominations themselves or from much smaller
national polls that only provided a very broad picture of affiliation.;   
Marty said the data confirmed what already was known about larger religious
groups and provided previously unknown details about smaller ones.;    The
survey found that while 86.5 percent of Americans, or 214 million people, are
Christians, they identify in dozens of groups.;    Roman Catholics make up the
largest of these, with 26 percent of the nation's population, followed by
Baptists, Methodists and Lutherans, respectively. Jews are less than 2 percent
of the population, and Muslims are 0.5 percent.;    90% say they're religious;
 Even though these broad outlines were known before, Marty said he still
considered it "astonishing that in a high-tech, highly affluent nation, we
have 90 percent who identify" themselves as religious. "If such a poll were
done in Western Europe, the ancestral home of many Americans, you would run at
least a third or lower on every indicator," he said.;    Marty said he was not
surprised at the relatively low number of practitioners of Eastern or New Age
religions.;    "The exotic always catches the eye," he said. "But for most
Americans, they are fascinating things that they can pick up or drop but don't
change the level of commitment.";    Several of the surprises in the poll
shattered stereotypes about ethnic groups. After finding that most Americans
of Irish ancestry are not Catholic, the researchers speculated that this was
because so many are descended from Protestants from Northern Ireland and
others are the products of interdenominational marriages.;    The survey also
found that most Asian-Americans and most Arab-Americans are Christian, rather
than Buddhist, Hindu or Muslim. The authors said Christians from Arab and
Asian countries are more likely to emigrate to the United States.;    Finally,
the survey looked at marriage in light of religious affiliation. People
without a religious affiliation, it found, are least likely to marry.;    But
it found that the likelihood of being divorced is generally uniform across all
religious groups. Roman Catholics, with 7.5 percent currently divorced, are
only slightly lower than other mainstream Protestant and Jews, with 8.7
percent divorced. The Greek Orthodox have the lowest level of divorce (4.4
percent) and the Unitarians the highest (18 percent).;    Other findings; 
Among other findings:;    (check) Jews, with 1.8 percent (or 4.3 million
people), are the largest non-Christian faith represented. While a recent
estimate by the Council of Jewish Federations put the number of Jews at 5.5
million, the City University researchers did not include those who identify
culturally as Jews but not religiously.;    (check) The finding that Muslims
represent 0.5 percent of the U.S. population (or 1.4 million people) is also
less than previous estimates, which put the Muslim population at 3 million to
6 million. The difference might have to do with Christians from Arab countries
who identify culturally with the Muslim community but not religiously, the
pollsters speculated.;    (check) Of the nation's Muslims, 40 percent are
black, though less than 2 percent of the total black population is Muslim.;   
(check) The number of Buddhists (one million) and Hindus (500,000) was larger
than earlier estimates. Among smaller groups with fewer than 50,000 members
were, in descending order of size, Bahai, Taoist, Rastafarians and Wiccan.;   
The data were collected through telephone interviews with 113,000 adults from
April 1989 to April 1990 by the ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa., on
behalf of the Graduate School of the City University. The margin of sampling
error for the nationwide statistics is less than one percentage point in
either direction.; CHART: Religion in America: Snapshots; From a telephone
