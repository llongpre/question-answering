   The King of the Witches for 25 years is dead and
his designated heir has fled.
   So the Witchcraft Council of Elders, which claims 100,000
members in Britain and thousands of adherents worldwide, voted
unanimously not to pick a successor.
   Alex Sanders was the first formal King of the Witches in about
500 years, said council spokesman, High Priest Nigel Bourne.
   The witch king, who died earlier this month at age 61, decreed
in a tape recording played at his funeral that his 16-year-old son,
Victor, should succeed him as king, said his widow, Maxine.
   But his son apparently has no interest in the job and has gone
to live with friends in the United States, she said.
   In any case, she suggested, perhaps a king is no longer needed.
The Council of Elders voted to that effect Thursday night.
   ``In the old days you had a king of witches because the crops
wouldn't grow, because the country was in danger or at war, or
something like that,'' she said.
   ``After a period of seven years he would be sacrificed. In
modern times we don't sacrifice them, but nobody in their right
mind wants the job. ... It is not necessary at this time. The crops
are doing very nicely, the babies are doing nicely.''
   The Sanders family clearly regard their brand of witchcraft as
the white, or benevolent, sort.
   Geoffrey Dickens, a Conservative member of Parliament, told the
House of Commons last month that he believed witchcraft was
sweeping the country and endangering children. He said many people
convicted of offenses against children had been involved in
witchcraft initiation ceremonies.
