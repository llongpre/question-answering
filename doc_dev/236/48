Thirteen is one of the scariest numbers, but when it lands on a Friday it is 
considered the unluckiest of days and is enough to keep people home. But a 
Northridge numerologist is trying to ease fears about the odd number by 
teaching a class just after this month's Friday the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
"The number 13 is my favorite number," said Freda Amsel, wearing a necklace 
with the number 13. "It always turns up in my life and has always meant good 
things for me." 
</P>
<P>
She was born on the 13th, and often flies on that date, requesting row 13 on 
the plane. The names of her three sons -- whom she had well before she 
discovered numerology -- all add up to 13 when translated into numerological 
terms. The addresses of homes significant in her life -- her house of birth, 
first homes in New York and California, the home of her divorce and her present 
home -- all add up to 13. And this year is significant because Amsel turns 58 
(5 + 8 = 13). 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the 13 denotes a negative connotation I hope people will see its 
positive side," Amsel said. 
</P>
<P>
But the superstitious may be delighted to know that this month's Friday the 
13th is the last one until September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge professor Eloise Klein Healy, an expert and author about 
mythology and legends, said the fear of 13 has always been associated with the 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, it has been considered an extremely dangerous number," said 
Healy, an English professor. "There are 13 witches in a coven, so it is 
associated with witches. It is affiliated with an outside religion and the 
magic of numbers. In history, people were afraid of the number 13 because they 
feared anything magical -- like black magic. Look was happened to witches." 
</P>
<P>
Numerology is the study of positive and negative vibrations of numbers, made up 
by names and birth dates; a person choses to follow the vibrations for good or 
evil, Amsel said. 
</P>
<P>
Amsel teaches her class at the Cosmic Connection Metaphysical Bookstore and 
Academy in Northridge, where owner Charlene Whitaker has read Tarot cards and 
astrology charts for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"The number 13 got a bad reputation because of this," Whitaker said, flipping 
out the "Death Card" from her Tarot deck -- cards used as an ancient form of 
fortune telling. The number 13 is on the card with a grotesque skeleton and a 
rising sun in the background. "This was never meant to be death as we know it, 
but transformation. It's about destroying the old and making room for the new." 
That, coupled with the death of Jesus Christ on a Friday made the combination 
ominous. He was the 13th one at the dinner table, Amsel pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wake up thinking it is Friday the 13th and bad things are going to 
happen, then we look for bad things to happen," Whitaker said. "Thought creates 
form." 
</P>
<P>
But 13 was very lucky for 13 bank employees in Clearwater, Fla., who bet $13 in 
the lottery on the Friday the 13th in April and won $9.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Other significant 13s: 
</P>
<P>
* The "baker's dozen" in Europe means if you order a dozen, you get 13. 
Historically, it relates to 12 months of growing and harvesting crops and the 
13th is a new beginning of sharing. 
</P>
<P>
* The New York Stock Exchange and many hotels and office buildings have no 13th 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
* At 13, Jewish children become adults in bar mitzvahs or bas mitzvahs, another 
transformation, Amsel said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many misconceptions about 13 and the fears are passed on from 
generation to generation," Whitaker said. "People consider it fatalistic, until 
they learn more about it." 
</P>
<P>
The New Age philosophy of the late 1980s has peaked and people put the 
metaphysical stuff they learned to everyday practice, said Whitaker, who has 
classes at her bookstore in tea-leaf readings, crystals, self-healing, 
spiritual development and meditation. Her brightly lighted, incense-scented 
store doesn't carry materials about voodoo, black magic, satanism or 
witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
"A good psychic reminds you of who you are and what your values and priorities 
should be, thereby releasing you of fear and worry," Amsel said. "Freed from 
your anxieties, you will be open-minded to directing your own course of 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Her classes are a bit of a history lesson. "In my class everyone is curious 
about the number 13 and even the most skeptical is fascinated by the 
information on the dollar bill," Amsel said. 
</P>
<P>
She pulls out a dollar bill and points to the 13 rows of bricks on the pyramid, 
a symbol from the secret group of Freemasons that included George Washington, 
Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, as cited in "The Seal of the United 
States" by Paul Foster Case. The phrases "Annuit Coeptis" (He favors our 
undertaking) and "E pluribus unum" (From many, one) have 13 letters, the eagle 
carries 13 arrows in his left talon and the peace branch has 13 leaves and 13 
olives, according to Case's book. Although the country had 13 colonies to begin 
with, Amsel said the symbols are for a more spiritual purpose. 
</P>
<P>
(Amsel's next class on "The Mystery of Numbers" is scheduled at 7 p.m. July 25 
at the Cosmic Connection, 9250 Reseda Blvd. Admission is $10.) 
</P>
<P>
"The number is all or nothing at all," Amsel said. "You can make it have 
enormous potential for attainment or complete destruction, but it is up to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
"Friday the 13th should be thought of like any other day," Whitaker added.
