CHRISTIAN POLICE SERGEANT SEES SATAN AS AN ADVERSARY IN CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

First came the 18-year-old La Puente machinist who shot himself with a 
.22-caliber rifle in 1984 while a tape of Ozzy Osbourne's "Diary of a Madman" 
blasted heavy metal anthems from his stereo. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, a partially burned voodoo doll with pins in its groin and heart 
was found nailed to the back door of a Baldwin Park dressmaking shop. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1987, seven people were arrested for ransacking an El Monte warehouse, 
where they painted "Suicidal Death Tribe" in giant letters on the wall and 
jammed a dead rat through the plaster. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, a Covina teen-ager pleaded guilty to charges of animal cruelty 
after he and a friend were accused of mutilating several cats and using the 
blood to scrawl "666" on an elementary school wall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troubled Youths 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, they were all just troubled youths hoping to shock the rest of the 
world into paying them attention. But Randy Emon did not think so. 
</P>
<P>
Emon, a Baldwin Park police sergeant with 18 years on the force, saw a darker 
side to those incidents, a suspicion that has launched him on a bizarre and 
spiritually turbulent journey into the world of occult-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Emon has become a leading authority among a small but growing 
number of occult specialists whose expertise in such practices as satanism, 
witchcraft and Santeria is increasingly in high demand. 
</P>
<P>
Through his course at Rio Hondo College and consulting jobs, he estimates he 
has trained more than 600 California police officers in recognizing ritualistic 
crimes. Adding church and civic groups, he figures that at least 20,000 people 
have heard him lecture about animal mutilation, necrophilia and human 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Emon, a "born-again" Christian and father of three, has also been beset by 
personal conflict as he has immersed himself in a subject that is the 
antithesis of all he believes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Events 
</P>
<P>
Emon, 36, says his children have been possessed by demons just before he 
conducted seminars on the occult. He says his wife has broken out in rashes as 
she approached the boxes of demonic memorabilia that he stores in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
And he says a pentagram, the five-pointed star often used as a symbol by 
satanists, once mysteriously appeared etched in his carpet, disappearing only 
after he dropped to his knees in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel this stuff getting to you sometimes," Emon said. "I have seen 
firsthand the power that's there. I suppose, if I didn't feel a real calling to 
learn more about this, there would be a lot less pressure in my life." 
</P>
<P>
These are statements that are sure to raise the eyebrows of skeptics. Warnings 
about supernatural forces and gruesome rituals often seem overly alarmist, if 
not flat-out fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
But with the grisly drug-cult murders in Matamoros, Mexico, earlier this year 
and the self-styled satanism allegedly practiced by Night Stalker suspect 
Richard Ramirez, such notions have slowly begun to creep into the public 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Occult-Related Crimes 
</P>
<P>
Some experts now say they hear of so many cases involving blood-drained 
animals, abused children and dismembered corpses that they believe occult 
rituals will be the crime of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"When you measure it against the tremendous gang and narcotic problems we have, 
it's still not a major issue," said Detective Patrick Metoyer, a 23-year 
veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and a widely recognized expert in 
the field. "But it's something we had better be concerned with. Occult activity 
is definitely on the rise." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Gabriel Valley, as elsewhere in the state, documentation is still 
usually piecemeal and anecdotal. No police department has an officer assigned 
exclusively to such crimes. And authorities readily concede that they are not 
always equipped to decipher the clues left behind from ritualistic acts. 
</P>
<P>
That is where Emon steps in. 
</P>
<P>
When two decapitated chickens were discovered last month next to several small 
wax figurines, coconut pieces and shreds of colored cloth near a dry riverbed 
in South El Monte, it was Emon who determined that they were the remnants of a 
ritual from the Afro-Cuban religion, Santeria. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Sacrifice 
</P>
<P>
No crime was committed because the animals appeared to have been slaughtered 
humanely, with a quick and clean cut, said Dan Sturkie, district supervisor for 
county Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
"But prior to this, it would have looked to us just like someone's leftover 
dinner," Sturkie said. "Now we're recognizing things more often for what they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
The same was true for Covina police who last April arrested two youths, ages 16 
and 17, for allegedly mutilating at least seven cats, scrawling satanic symbols 
with the blood and leaving the tails in a box at the Covina Post Office. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the kids were able to convince the D.A. that it was all a joke," said 
Glenn Myers, the Covina crime prevention officer. "But it was still pretty 
scary behavior. Randy was able to look at some of the stuff and let us know 
that we had a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
Emon, an athletic, neatly groomed man who belongs to Cops for Christ, traces 
his connection with the occult back to 1985, shortly after Ramirez was captured 
and his obsession with satanic imagery revealed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incident in Church 
</P>
<P>
That same week, Emon said he saw a demon possess a woman during a Sunday church 
service, watching as her face grew contorted and she repeated in a deep 
masculine voice, "No, I don't want to leave." 
</P>
<P>
From that moment on, he said, he felt "a nudge from up there" to learn 
everything there was to know about the occult. He soon realized it would be a 
road paved with tension. 
</P>
<P>
One night, just before he was going to conduct a seminar, his eldest son 
developed a high fever as he lay on his bed, arms extended to the ceiling, 
crying, "Get away, get away." 
</P>
<P>
Emon said he placed the boy in cool water and prayed for him until the fever 
subsided. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, his younger son screamed from his bedroom that he could not 
see. Emon said he wrapped his arms around him and prayed until his son's vision 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Mere Chance' 
</P>
<P>
"I realized many of the events which had occurred . . . were not mere chance, 
but the work of Satan and his demons striving to discourage my research," he 
later wrote in a Christian magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Emon's experiences, however, are not shared by all in his field. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal feeling is that's pretty far out," said Investigator Sandi 
Gallant, the San Francisco Police Department's occult expert. "I've certainly 
never been haunted." 
</P>
<P>
Metoyer, the LAPD's expert, said he has been invited to attend satanic rituals 
but was not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see a darn thing," he said. "I didn't hear diddly-squat. I didn't see 
any devil come down." 
</P>
<P>
A professor emeritus of religion at USC even compared Satan sleuths such as 
Emon to those who conducted the communist witch-hunts during the red-baiting 
days of Sen. Joseph McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
"You interpret what you find in the light of the glasses you look through," 
said Gerald Larue, who was named "Humanist of the Year" for 1989 by the 
American Humanist Assn. "You become obsessed with the enemy. And for a 
Christian, the enemy is Satan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spiritual Encounters 
</P>
<P>
But an occult expert at the Christian Research Institute in Irvine said 
experiences such as Emon's were genuine spiritual encounters that were typical 
of devout Christians who trespass in the demonic realm. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, these things are nothing short of the bizarre," said Craig Hawkins, a 
research consultant at the institute. "But for a person who believes that there 
really is a spiritual realm, that kind of thing is not impossible at all. 
That's what happens when you enter the domain of the demonic." 
</P>
<P>
Some say Emon's deep faith even enhances his expertise. George Belanger, a 
former drummer for the occult-rock band Christian Death, said Emon was 
instrumental in helping him leave satanism behind. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Christians, when they find out you're from an occult background, they 
freak out," said Belanger, now a "born-again" Christian who lives in Glendora. 
"But Randy was very sympathetic, caring and loving. I had a lot of painful 
memories and he had a real soft ear." 
</P>
<P>
Emon, who is also director of the Christian Occult Investigators Network, a 
nonprofit research group in West Covina, says he works hard to keep his 
religious views from interfering with his police work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freedom of Worship 
</P>
<P>
He stresses First Amendment rights in all of his seminars, cautioning other 
officers that satanists -- unless their rituals break the law -- have the same 
freedom to worship as anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
His supervisor, Baldwin Park Police Chief Richard A. Hoskin, said that there 
have been no conflicts, but he acknowledged that the subject can get touchy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sensitive issue," Hoskin said. "As far as being an embarrassment, it 
hasn't really come to that. But we have tried to suggest to him that he not 
become actively involved in that while he's on duty." 
</P>
<P>
On- or off-duty, however, it's hard for Emon to escape the occult. The 30 to 40 
boxes of artifacts from his investigations piled in the garage of his suburban 
home serve as constant reminders of his encounters with the demonic. 
</P>
<P>
He has photos of decapitated pigs, record albums from heavy metal bands, such 
as Venom and Slayer, literary staples such as Anton LaVey's "Satanic Bible" and 
comic books with ads for "100 Ready-to-Use Mystic Chants." 
</P>
<P>
He has a Ouija Board that he says sent mystical messages to a teen-ager to take 
his own life. He has a cardboard shrine splattered with blood. And he has a 
small squirrel tail that he says was cut from the animal in a satanic ritual. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy is a unique individual," said Tony Palmer, whose Walnut-based firm, 
International Law Enforcement Training &amp; Consulting, hires Emon to teach 
occult seminars to police officers. "He lives this stuff. In many different 
ways."
