   A coven of witches in Rhode Island _ the
state founded as a haven for religious dissenters _ hope they, too,
will gain public acceptance now that the state has declared them a
legitimate religious group.
   Members of the Rosegate Coven want outsiders to see them as
followers of a faith, not freaks who ride brooms and cast spells.
   In a recent interview in a kitchen adorned with skulls, pictures
of sorcerers, the obligatory broom and a humorous kitchen-witch,
coven members talked about their attempts to sensitize others to
their beliefs.
   ``We have to combat centuries of conditioning. People have been
conditioned by their religion ... and society to ridicule us, not
to take anything seriously that the Christian religion doesn't put
forth,'' said the coven's high priestess, Joyce Siegrist, also
known as Lady Genevieve.
   ``People don't easily give up their misconceptions _ they really
enjoy them,'' said Siegrist, 46, also the director of the New
England chapter of the Witches' Anti-Defamation League.
   At a meeting last October, the group, which has about 40
members, decided to incorporate as a non-profit religious group and
apply for an exemption from Rhode Island sales tax. Last week, the
state tax administrator overruled an earlier decision and approved
the request.
   The certificate granting the exemption is framed and hangs in
the modest kitchen, near an enlarged photograph showing the
Rosegate ``grove,'' or overall group of about 40 initiates. The
coven, or inner core of leaders, consists of about a dozen people.
   ``Obviously the intent wasn't to save the 6 percent sales tax,''
said Julian Bradford, who handles Rosegate's public relations. ``It
was to obtain the legitimization.''
   The coven, also known as Our Lady of the Roses Wiccan Church,
decided to come out of the closet in part because of the recent
publicity about Satanists.
   ``We've been lumped with them for 800 years. It makes us stand
up and say `enough is enough,''' said Bradford.
   It doesn't make sense to the witches that people confuse them
with Satanists. To believe in Satan you have to believe in the
Judeo-Christian tradition, Bradford said.
   The Wiccans believe in a diety with male and female attributes,
whose psychic energy can be tapped by anyone. Rosegate, a Wiccan
sect, emphasizes metaphsyics rather than simple magic, and does not
use many of the props often associated with witchcraft.
   ``In our tradition we are trying to erradicate needless
superstition,'' said Siegrist, citing as an example the use of
crystal balls. ``The ball doesn't have diddly. The power comes from
within.''
   From Siegrist's kitchen office, equipped with a copying machine,
the coven puts out a newsletter eight times a year, keeps track of
its 75-subscriber mailing list, arranges witchcraft classes and
plans meetings.
   The group has a small building fund and hopes someday to open a
center, complete with sanctuary and classrooms.
   Rosegate suffers little harassment overall, said Siegrist. A
crank caller who repeatedly called during the interview was
``really the first crank I've ever had to put up with,'' she said.
   But ``the mockery is always going to exist,'' said Bradford.
``We're the victims of eight or nine centuries of bad press.''
   When hostility surfaces, ``we try our best not to return it,''
Siegrist said.
   The witches profess to be uninhibited about their beliefs but
appear to be held back by their traditional upbringings.
   Sanura, 49, the secretary and musician of the group, said she
has told only one family member she is a witch. ``Those Irish
Catholics would disown me for sure.'' She declined to give her
non-witch name.
   Bradford, who fought in Vietnam and has ``mother'' tatooed on
his forearm, said, ``We're very open about what we are because we
have nothing to hide. We welcome the opportunity to educate
others.''
   He said others are accepting when they learn he is a witch.
   ``One guy made broom jokes at work until he had a problem I
worked out with a little magic,'' he said. Bradford, who works at
an East Providence car dealership, would not elaborate on the
problem or his solution other than to say there was ``no hocus
pocus, simply the application of proven metaphysical principles.''
   Now that the coven has proven it's legitimate, at least in the
eyes of Rhode Island's division of taxation, what does it want now?
   ``Give us a corporate broom to fly us to the Bahamas,'' joked
Bradford.
