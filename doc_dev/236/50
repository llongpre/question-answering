<HEAD>Judge Says Sex Church Not Protected by Constition</HEAD>

   A couple cannot claim their sex-based Church
of the Most High Goddess is a religion protected by constitutional
freedoms and thus immune from attempts to enforce vice laws, a
federal judge ruled Thursday.
   Wilbur Tracy, 51, and his wife, Mary Ellen, 47, argued that the
church, which promises salvation through sex in exchange for
monetary sacrifices, should be protected by the U.S. Constitution.
   The couple testified the church was based on an ancient Eqyptian
religion in which intercourse with Mrs. Tracy, alias priestess
Sabrina Aset, cleansed the soul as a purification rite.
   Proof came in the form of cash or other ``tokens of sacrifice,''
Mrs. Tracy testified Wednesday.
   Mrs. Tracy said she qualified as a high priestess for the
religion in 1986 by sleeping with 1,000 men over a two-year period.
   But U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne rejected the argument,
ruling after a five-day, non-jury trial that they weren't protected
from law enforcement prosecution by constitutional religious
freedom guarantees.
   The Tracys filed the lawsuit claiming city officials pursuing
prostitution charges violated her First Amendment right to
religious freedom. Named in the lawsuit were City Attorney James
Hahn and Police Chief Daryl Gates.
   Assistant City Attorney Bryon R. Boeckman said authorities
believe Mrs. Tracy and her husband used the church as a front for
prostitution.
   ``This is not a true religion,'' Boeckman said.
   Advertised in sexually explicit magazines, the church boasted
services run by the priestess wearing a strapless red-sequined
gown, high-heeled shoes and fishnet stockings.
   The sparsely furnished church had no pews or pulpit. The few
wall hangings in place included posters of movie stars and a framed
nude photograph of Mrs. Tracy.
   The Tracys filed the lawsuit while their misdemeanor criminal
convictions for prostitution and running a brothel are on appeal.
   They claim divine inspiration prompted them to revive an ancient
Egyptian religion in which man justifies his sins by having sex
with church priestesses.
   She said initiates needed to confess and have sex before they
could be considered for sin ``negation'' and ``purification,''
   Then ``sacrifices'' of cash or other valuables were required to
show dedication to the church before having sexual intercourse.
   ``The rituals would end if there were no sacrifices?'' asked
Byrne.
   ``Correct,'' Mrs. Tracy answered. ``There is no purpose to
having your sins negated if you do not wish to emulate God.''
   She denied that she sought specific payment amounts. During her
criminal trial, testimony included allegations she demanded minimum
payments of $150.
   ``It's up to a person to decide if it's an acceptable
sacrifice,'' she said.
   She testified Tuesday that she collected about $50,000 in
donations during a three-year period, but did not keep records
regarding followers beyond their first names and telephone numbers.
   She acknowledged that about 50 percent of the men paid only one
visit and never returned.
   ``I don't think that's very unusual for any religion,'' she said.
