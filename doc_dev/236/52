   Bishop Edir Macedo Bezerra, the church's founder and leader,
directs his message straight at spirit worshipers.
   ``Ogum, show yourself. Exu, I summon you. Then you're going to
BURN in the name of Jesus,'' he screams, invoking the African spirit
gods at a weekly exorcism ceremony at the church's headquarters in
Rio's Abolicao district.
   Scores in the audience swoon as they ``receive'' the spirits.
Ushers guide them forward to the stage, where Macedo Bezerra calls
on the Holy Spirit to expel the entities.
   Gradually the ``possessed'' parishioners recover with a shudder
and are helped back to their seats.
   ``Spiritists are more sincere than evangelists or Catholics,''
says Macedo Bezerra, a former spirit worshiper himself. ``We have
the greatest compassion for them. But we must show them they're on
the wrong road and rip the devil out of their bodies.''
   However, some Pentecostal followers have been accused of trying
to convert disbelievers by force.
   Oju Oba, an African-culture group in Rio that assists spirit
centers, says it receives almost daily complaints of aggression by
Pentacostalists.
   ``One spirit center was stoned. In another, a girl was
sequestered by Pentecostalists and preached to for three days,''
says Jairo Pereira de Jesus, a member of Oju Oba.
   Candomble followers say the main problem is a misunderstanding
about Exu, a deity symbolized by a phallus and iron spikes and often
equated with the devil.
   ``The idea of heaven and hell doesn't exist in African religions.
Exu is the dynamic principle, vitality, fertility, transformation,''
says Gesia de Oliveira, a member of Oju Oba and a Candomble
practitioner.
   The Brazilian Catholic Church has given up trying to repress
spirit cults. Instead, some priests want to ``Africanize'' the
Catholic ritual to compete with the cults.
   ``Candomble has a great fraternal element. Catholics go to Mass
and remain anonymous. It's not a meeting of brothers,'' says the
Rev. Felix Neefjes, a Dutch-born priest in the Ecumenism and
Religious Dialogue sector of the Brazilian Bishops Conference. ``The
Church has to ask itself if it's corresponding to the people's
needs.''
   Da Silva, a doctor of theology and dean of the Theological School
for the archdiocese of Sao Paulo, heads a clerical campaign to bring
together Catholicism and African religions.
   In some Masses, samba music is played on atabaques, agogos and
other African instruments. Sometimes the altar is removed and
flowers and fruit offerings placed on a cloth laid on the floor,
African-style.
   ``African culture is our common mother,'' da Silva says. ``To
Africans, the earth is the altar of God, Olorum. The black Catholic
is rediscovering this.''
   Da Silva concedes that some bishops ``are upset'' at the changes.
   ``They know only the Roman way, the European way,'' he says.
``But this is a new vitality. It is the Latin American church
renewed.''
   Some believe the Roman Catholic Church has become too
accommodating since the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65.
   ``The Church is afraid of losing people,'' says Carden of the
Christian Research Institute. ``It can't catechize them, so it wants
to make them feel at home and not leave the Church. It's a very
serious compromise. They're talking about African gods and
anti-biblical things.''
   Many spirit worshipers just wish Christians would leave them
alone.
   Mae Meninazinha de Oxum, or ``Mother Little Girl of Oxum,'' is a
Candomble priestess in Sao Joao de Meriti, a poor city north of Rio.
Recently she literally had to bar her door to prevent
Pentecostalists from invading.
   ``They cursed us and said we would burn in hell,'' she says.
``They're fanatics. We respect all religions, but we are not
respected.''
   Mae Beata de Iemanja, a priestess at the Yle Omi Oju Aro
Candomble center in the nearby Sao Mateus district, also has battled
police and preachers to preserve her religion.
   ``I was baptized a Catholic, but today, knowing what I do of the
religion of the orixas, I wouldn't do it,'' says the 57-year-old
priestess, dressed in the traditional white lace dress, turban and
colored ritual necklaces of Candomble. ``Nature is our religion.
Nature purifies, blesses, does everything. It has force.
   ``When Olorum made the world, he made a place for everything he
created. So why fight? We are all children of Olorum.''
