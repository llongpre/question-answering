   A man suspected of leading a cult that performed
human sacrifices on a Mexican ranch was exposed to secretive
Afro-Caribbean religions that ritually slaughter animals and rely
on magic.
   But a Santeria priest and others familiar with the practices of
Santeria, voodoo and other obscure religions likened the Mexican
drug-smuggling cult more to the mass suicide in Jonestown led by
Jim Jones.
   At least 13 bodies have been found this week in shallow graves
in Matamoros, Mexico. Suspects in the slayings have said they
killed at the demand of Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, whom they called
``godfather.''
   They said Constanzo, 26, and Sara Maria Aldrete, 24, called the
``witch,'' believed human sacrifices gave the members of cult
protection from harm and helped them in a drug-smuggling operation.
   Constanzo, a Cuban-American who grew up in suburban Miami, is
still being sought.
   ``He's had some sort of exposure to Santeria, I wouldn't deny
that, but I wouldn't say he's a Santeria priest,'' said Willie
Ramos of Miami, a Santeria high priest.
   Santeria is a largely underground religion that melded the
beliefs of slaves from present-day Nigeria with Hispanic culture in
the Caribbean and parts of South America.
   ``Let's compare it to Jonestown in the sense that the guy in
Jonestown was deranged and demented. He got all these people to
follow him to the extent that he got these people killed,'' Ramos
said.
   Human sacrifice has never been practiced ``in the approximately
400 years that the Afro-Caribbean cults have survived in the New
World,'' he said.
   Mercedes Sandoval, a professor at Miami-Dade Community College
who has studied Santeria for nearly 40 years, said religious
beliefs could not be blamed for the slayings.
   ``It was not the religion that got them into drugs. It was the
drug dealing that led them to try to get protection through
religion,'' Ms. Sandoval said.
   Dr. Charles Wetli, Dade County deputy chief medical examiner who
has studied the religions for a decade as part of his work, agreed
with Ms. Sandoval.
   ``The drug-smuggling activities and the homicides are totally
unrelated to the religion,'' Wetli said. ``If you're a drug
smuggler, you can pray to some of these gods to help you with your
drug smuggling.''
   Blood from Santeria animal sacrifices can form an alliance with
gods of nature and protect the believers, a reason offered by
Mexican authorities as a motive for the killings at the ranch
across the border from Brownsville, Texas, Ms. Sandoval said.
   Constanzo ``probably was seeking assistance from magical systems
to get protection, and then he himself developed his own ritual.''
   Ms. Sandoval estimated as many as 25,000 people in south Florida
are regular Santeria followers, and they also can be found in New
York, New Jersey, California, Venezuela, Colombia and Spain.
   Constanzo's family, which lived in a middle-class neighborhood
west of Miami until 1984, left headless chickens, geese and goats _
animals used in Santeria rituals _ on doorsteps and street corners,
said neighbors.
   Ms. Sandoval said symbols of Santeria were present in the farm
shack where investigators believe the victims were killed, but
television pictures also revealed human skulls commonly used in the
practice of palo mayombe.
   Palo mayombe, with origins in Congo, uses human skulls in its
rituals, but Ms. Sandoval and Wetli said they are obtained through
medical supply stores, from medical school students and, only
occasionally, through grave robbing.
   ``I think what we have here is a case of some very sociopathic
people ... that may have been exposed to Santeria or some other
magical system,'' Ms. Sandoval said. ``I think we are dealing with
a deranged person.''
   Former neighbors recalled the Constanzos as Santeria followers
and referred to Constanzo's mother as a witch.
   Norma Brito, who bought the Constanzo's house after a bank
foreclosed on it in 1984, said she found the remains of an altar
with candles, wax and fruit when she moved in.
