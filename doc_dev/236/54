   Animal torture and slayings attributed to
devil worshipers and the Afro-Cuban Santeria religion appear to be
increasing, and authorities are researching the tricky legal
question of how to stop it.
   The City Board of Animal Regulation, which has relied largely on
anecdotal accounts of increased ceremonial mutilation of animals,
has asked for a report on the matter, outgoing board member Arthur
Margolis said Thursday.
   ``All I am aware of as an activist is that there have been
animal sacrifices by satanist groups and other groups,'' said
Margolis. He said the study should supply documentation of the
problem.
   In suburban Hawthorne, authorities raided a home last week and
seized 22 chickens, two goats, a piglet and a lamb. The officers
also found four goatskins, several chicken carcasses, and evidence
of backyard animal slaughter. The owner denied Santeria practices.
   Reed said authorities last fall found six goats bound and kept
in the bathroom of a Culver City home, along with several chickens.
Candles and other religious items suggested Santeria, and the
owners were charged with animal cruelty.
   Margolis, an attorney, hopes the report will lead to
consideration of a law banning animal deaths and tortures as part
of a religious ceremony. He admitted a First Amendment fight would
immediately follow, as it already has in one city.
   Officials in Hialeah, Fla., a mostly Hispanic city near Miami,
passed three laws in 1987 aimed at the Santeria Church of Lukumi
Babalu Aye, the first public church of the sect opened in Florida.
Los Angeles has no such established church.
   The Hialeah laws prohibit sacrifice of animals, including goats,
pigs, cows, poultry, cats or dogs, animals which sect members
slaughter during so called ``red magic'' rituals that seek favors
or advice from their gods.
   The church sued the city in federal court alleging the laws
violated their constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion.
The suit is pending.
   Charlene Drennon, West Coast director of the Humane Society of
the United States, said she believes a model law drawn up by her
group would meet constitutional tests.
   ``There have been several cases where the Supreme Court has
decided how far religious freedom can go,'' she said Thursday in an
interview from her Sacramento office. She cited a Supreme Court
ruling that said smoking marijuana could not be regarded as a
religious practice.
   Ms. Drennon said, however, that education was a better approach
than law enforcement when dealing with a clash between religious
practices and animal welfare.
   ``I think it needs a very heavy duty emphasis on educating
people,'' she said.
   Santeria is a mix of Roman Catholicism, voodoo, and African
rituals attributed to the Yoruba tribe of Nigeria. Some Roman
Catholic saints borrowed by Santeria have come to represent African
gods.
   The followers are secretive about their practice, and in most
places do not have special places of worship. Efforts were
unsuccessful to contact Santeria followers or priests, called
santeros, in Los Angeles or Hialeah.
   The establishment of the religion in Los Angeles is largely
manifested by the profusion of ``botanicas,'' stores which sell
supplies, statues and pictures used in Santeria and other rituals.
   Sociologists believe there may be as many as 50,000 practioners
of Santeria in the Los Angeles Cuban immigrant community.
   Anthropologists estimate that related, similarly derived
religions have 100 million followers in Latin America and the
United States.
   Reed said authorities last fall found six goats bound and kept
in the bathroom of a Culver City home, along with several chickens.
Candles and other religious items suggested Santeria, and the
owners were charged with animal cruelty.
