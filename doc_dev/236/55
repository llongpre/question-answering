   A self-proclaimed sex priestess who bedded
down with her followers says she first asked for proof _ in cash or
other ``tokens of sacrifice'' _ that they viewed sex as a religious
experience.
   Mary Ellen Tracy, known to her flock as Sabrina Aset, testified
in federal court Wednesday in her lawsuit accusing city officials
of violating her religious freedom in pursuing prostitution charges
against her.
   Mrs. Tracy and her husband, Wilbur, have been convicted of
prostitution and running a brothel.
   Assistant City Attorney Bryon R. Boeckman said the couple used
their Church of the Most High Goddess as a front for prostitution.
``This is not a true religion,'' Boeckman said.
   Advertised in sexually explicit magazines, the church boasted of
services by a priestess wearing a strapless red-sequined gown,
high-heeled shoes and fishnet stockings.
   The sparsely furnished church had no pews or pulpit. The few
wall hangings included posters of movie stars and a framed nude
photograph of Mrs. Tracy.
   The couple claim divine inspiration prompted them to revive an
ancient Egyptian religion in which man justifies his sins by having
sex with church priestesses.
   Ms. Tracy said initiates needed to confess and perform oral sex
on her before they could be considered for purification. Before
intercourse, sacrifices of cash or other valuables were required to
show dedication to the church, she said.
   ``It's up to a person to decide if it's an acceptable
sacrifice,'' she said. During her criminal trial, testimony
included allegations she demanded at least $150.
   She told Judge William Byrne on Tuesday that she collected about
$50,000 in donations in three years but kept no records on
followers beyond their first names and telephone numbers.
   The woman, who claims to have had sex with thousands of men,
said she told followers their donations were tax deductible, but no
receipts were issued.
   She acknowledged that about half the men paid only one visit to
the church and never returned.
   ``I don't think that's very unusual for any religion,'' she said.
