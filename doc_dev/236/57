   A court Monday began trying 25
residents of a South Pacific atoll who are accused of torturing to
death six islanders in a hunt for demons and sorcerers.
   Testimony in the trial, described as the largest ever in French
Polynesia, is expected to focus on how a small number of people
could terrorize a larger group in the name of religion.
   Archbishop Michel Coppenrath, the Roman Catholic leader in
French Polynesia, said the case involves ``simply a religious
perversion due to an abuse of trust and a lack of authority on the
island.''
   The defendants, representing about an eighth of the population
of the South Pacific atoll of Faaite, are accused of murder,
inciting violence and other offenses during two horror-filled days
in 1987.
   According to investigators, three women came to the atoll in
August 1987 from Tahiti, 310 miles to the west. The trio claimed to
be faith-healers connected to the Roman Catholic-affiliated
movement Charismatic Renewal, founded in the United States in 1967
and active throughout much of Polynesia.
   However, Coppenrath, who spent 15 days on Faaite counseling
families after the killings, said the women were not authentic
representatives of Charismatic Renewal.
   The women were regarded as priestesses by the islanders and
gained enormous influence, investigators said. Faaite's mayor was
away, and there were no police or religious authorities posted
there.
   At one point, the women ordered a crippled man to get up and
walk. When he failed, they said demons were interfering with their
work, investigators said.
   The women instructed the islanders to repent of their sins and
departed within a few weeks.
   However, they left behind a dozen youthful disciples who divined
on Sept. 2 that the assistant mayor, Iaone Harris, was possessed by
demons.
   The disciples held hallucinatory seances in the tiny church and
repeatedly dunked the official in sea water to ``purify'' him,
investigators say. They say he died, allegedly after severe
beatings, and the disciples burned his body at the church.
   His death set off a two-day hunt for sorcerers conducted by half
the islanders against the others, investigators said. Three more
men and two women were burned alive, included a mentally disturbed
man and a mother who pleaded for the life of her son.
   Ten children of the atoll were orphaned by the violence.
   Four more executions planned for Sept. 4 were thwarted when
frightened islanders established telephone contact with officials
in Papeete, the French Polynesia capital.
   The mayor, a priest and a police unit arrived and suppressed the
witch hunt. Many of the suspects interrogated by police professed
to be upholding the Christian faith.
   The proceeding before the Tribunal in Papeete will feature 15
islanders testifying against 25 neighbors. The jury is expected to
have a verdict after two weeks' testimony.
