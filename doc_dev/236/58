   A scholar for the nation's largest ecumenical
group says the U.S. Supreme Court weakened religious freedom when
it said a state could punish two men who used an illegal drug in a
church ritual.
   ``The main pillar upholding the venerable and precious right of
religious liberty in the Constitution has been virtually
repealed,'' said Dean Kelley, speaking Tuesday at a Pittsburgh
conference of the National Council of Churches.
   Needless language in the recent ruling means states easily can
prosecute people who cite their beliefs as reasons for violating
laws, said Kelley, the church council's director of religious
freedom and an authority on church-state relations.
   Board members of the council, which represents 32 church
organizations with 42 million members, agreed to draft a resolution
calling for the high court to reconsider the April 17 ruling.
   The justices, in a 6-3 decision, said Oregon officials could
withhold unemployment pay from two members of the Native American
Church who used peyote, a hallucinogenic drug derived from a
cactus, as part of their worship.
   ``It's not just the Indians that caught it in that case. It's
all religions, including ours,'' Kelley said.
   ``This case holds that criminal punishment of the central
religious ritual of an ancient faith raises no issue under the free
exercise clause and requires no justification!'' wrote law
professor Douglas Laycock, of the University of Texas, in remarks
prepared for the church council.
   The court weakened the freedom of religion clause in the Bill of
Rights when Justice Antonin Scalia's majority decision said
prosecutors must show only ``a rational means to achieve a
legitimate end'' to obtain a conviction when religion is used as a
defense, Kelley said.
   Previously, the government needed to establish a ``compelling
state interest'' to override the constitutional protection of
religious freedom, he said.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who voted against the workers but
dissented from the majority opinion, said the court didn't need to
lift the ``compelling state interest'' provision.
   ``It's a whole new ball game now,'' Kelley said. ``The
ecumenical communions have tended to be very relaxed about alleged
threats to religious liberty ... but the time has come for real
alarm.''
   Kelley said the high court's ruling affects dozens of pending
cases involving religious freedom, and one faith already has noted
the effects of the Oregon case.
   The justices told Minnesota's high court to use the peyote
decision in reconsidering a ruling involving Amish farmers in that
state.
   The Minnesota justices said the state couldn't enforce a law
requiring Amish buggy drivers to place a bright orange triangle on
their vehicles. The Amish considered the triangles garish, and
agreed to use silver reflectors.
   In another case in Clearwater, Fla., the high court's ruling
supersedes a federal judge's ruling that the city can't force
churches to disclose financial data if they accept donations,
Kelley said.
   Also, 49 states have laws protecting the confidentiality of
talks between a priest and members of his congregation, but the
high court's ruling could force the clergy to reveal information if
those states repeal those laws. West Virginia is the only state
that doesn't have a law protecting communications with priests.
