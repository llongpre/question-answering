<HEADLINE>  HIGH PRIESTESS OF SEX CHURCH RELEASED FROM PRISON  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Prison overcrowding and credit for time served shortened her sentence from
a year to about 150 days, according to her husband, Will Tracy.;   "She was
released at 1:35 this morning and walked out the door," said Deputy Benita
Hinojas of the Sheriff's Information Bureau, who said Mrs. Tracy was released
from Sybil Brand Institute for Women, a county facility.;   Mrs. Tracy, who
was called Sabrina Aset by her followers, claimed she was the priestess of an
ancient religion that required her to conduct sexual rituals in exchange for
money.;   But she was convicted of operating a house of ill fame and two
counts of prostitution. Prosecutors argued that her Beverly Hills home was in
fact a brothel, and her "acolytes" were customers.;   Mrs. Tracy and her
husband appealed the conviction, saying that their activities were protected
by the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech and religion.;   But the
conviction was upheld on appeal. Now the Tracys, acting as their own lawyers,
have petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their case, her husband said.; 
 No decision has been made on that petition.;   The Tracys said the Church of
the Most High Goddess was the oldest religion in the world, and that some of
the religion's roots are found on Egyptian scrolls.;   Mrs. Tracy was raised a
Catholic and became a Mormon before becoming a high priestess.;   When the
church was in operation, it was advertised in the Hollywood Press. Men who
wanted to attend services called to arrange an interview with Mrs. Tracy, who
would accept or reject their request.;   Upon their arrival at her home, they
participated in a series of rituals, including sexual ones. Afterward they
left a "sacrifice" that was usually money -- the practice that led police to
arrest Mrs. Tracy.  </TEXT>
