   Cheryl St. John doesn't cast evil spells.
She'd rather bake chocolate raisin bread than stir eye of newt and
toe of frog into a bubbling cauldron. And she carries her
broomstick in the trunk of her suburban sedan.
   ``I'm a good witch, but bad witches have more fun,'' she says
with a mischievous wink.
   By day, she's a 37-year-old computer programmer who dresses for
corporate success. By night, she's Lady Cassandra, the black-clad
high priestess of three covens of metropolitan Washington D.C.
witches who worship an ancient goddess of fertility.
   She's also a shaman, ``a sort of traveling chaplain'' who visits
divorcees, drug addicts, cancer patients and other witches who need
the healing hand of a spiritual companion in their time of
suffering.
   She takes along a canvas gym bag stuffed with the tools for a
portable altar _ a goddess image, chalices, incense, candles,
broom, hand-carved wand and a beribboned sword, her badge of
witching authority.
   The broom, incidentally, is not for riding the skies under a
full moon. The bride and groom jump over it for good luck at
witches' weddings, or ``handfastings.'' Following centuries-old
tradition, Ms. St. John uses her broom to make sure the altar's
``magic circle'' is swept clean of evil thoughts.
   ``I'm everything the pastor in your local church would be,'' she
says. ``I marry 'em and I bury 'em. I specialize in healing the
heart. I let the doctors work with potions, and I work with the
soul.''
   Her followers gather regularly around a coffee table altar in
Ms. St. John's townhouse in this Washington suburb for an evening
of meditation, worship and study of the Wiccan religion, a
nature-loving pagan faith with roots in ancient Western Europe.
   Her branch of the Wiccan tradition celebrates the feminine
virtues of life-giving, nurturing and respect for the environment,
with true equality of the sexes. She traces its origins to the
pre-Christian Celtic isles.
   ``We are the snakes that St. Patrick chased out of Ireland,''
says Ms. St. John, who regards snakes as holy.
   Eight times a year, her witches join hundreds of others in
forested parks or rented hotel ballrooms to celebrate seasonal
holidays on the Wiccan calendar with festivals of dancing, singing
and storytelling. The most joyful event, naturally, is Halloween,
which marks the Wiccan new year.
   Ms. St. John, a psychic who entered the witchhood eight years
ago, estimates there are 1,000 or more witches or serious students
of witchcraft in the Washington area, and perhaps 20,000 or more
throughout the United States. Other estimates range as high as
100,000, but nobody knows for sure.
   Most witches have stayed in the broom closet, fearful of job
losses, evictions, social ostracism and the vengeful wrath of
fundamentalist preachers if they're found out.
   Ms. St. John decided to go public when she became outraged over
accusations that witches practice devil worship and black magic, or
that they boil babies to obtain the fat for making altar candles.
   ``Most of our people use magic to heal themselves and bring what
we need into our lives,'' she said. ``There are a lot of wackos out
there, but we're as ethical a bunch of people as you're ever going
to meet. Our basic law is `do as you will, but harm none.'''
   It's not all toil and trouble, however.
   She may be a good witch, but Ms. St. John occasionally uses her
magical powers for some innocent fun.
   ``I use it to get parking places,'' she said. ``When my friends
and I go out to eat, I will visualize the restaurant in my mind and
visualize a parking space close by. When we drive up, it's there.
   ``You make it happen in your mind, and it happens,'' she said.
``That's what magic is all about.''
