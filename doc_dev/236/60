   The 20 people executed during the infamous Salem
witch trials of 1692 are mostly remembered in history lessons and
tourist attractions, but some of their descendants are organizing to
emphasize their humanity.
   ``We want to keep the memory alive,'' said Howard Hay of Boston,
a descendant of accused witch Susanna Martin. ``This type of thing
keeps happening around the world. People keep getting persecuted. I
don't know if we'll ever learn the lesson.''
   He is president of the recently formed Sons and Daughters of the
Victims of Colonial Witch Trials, which has 45 members, all direct
descendants of the trial victims.
   Hay founded the group with Wayne Higley of Stoneham, a descendant
of accused witch Rebecca Nurse. They are members of numerous
genealogical societies and discovered their link to the witch trial
victims while researching their lineage.
   Using standard statistical formulas, they say there could be up
to 20 million descendants of the accused witches in the United
States. One of the more famous, according to Gary Boyd Roberts of
the New England Genealogical Society, is Joan Kennedy, former wife
of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, whose ancestry dates back to accused
witch Mary Esty. She is not a member of the group.
   The witchcraft hysteria began during the winter of 1691 when a
West Indian slave, Tituba, told voodoo tales to a group of young
girls and taught them palmistry and magic.
   Tituba and two other women were killed as witches after a doctor
examined them and pronounced them bewitched. The scare continued for
about a year, resulting in the execution of 20 people and the
imprisonment of 150.
   The descendants' group is concentrating on the approaching 300th
anniversary of the witch trials. They hope to hold an observance on
Gallows Hill in Salem, where accused witches were hanged.
   ``Until now, there hasn't been anything to really remember them
by,'' Hay said. ``There hasn't even been so much as a plaque. We
want people to know the real story. These people were human beings
who were unjustly accused.''
   Higley said many of those first accused of witchcraft were either
community outcasts or victims of neighborhood feuds.
   The group said the city of Salem has been uncomfortable about
remembering the accused witches except in terms of tourist promotion.
   ``These people had no connection with witches,'' Higley said.
``It was a sad time in colonial history. We don't hold a grudge
against Salem but we do think there should be something there to
remember them (the victims).''
   Higley and Hay have overseen the design of a 14-foot, seven-ton
bronze statue of three of the accused witches _ Sarah Cloyce, Mary
Esty and Rebecca Nurse _ which they would like to see stand at the
Old Burying Ground in the heart of Salem.
   The city has not yet approved their proposed site, not far from
the grave of Magistrate John Hathorne, one of the chief hanging
judges who sentenced Esty and Nurse to death.
   The three women depicted in the statue were sisters, daughters of
William Towne of Topsfield.
   Nurse was in her early 70s when she was accused of witchcraft and
arrested. When her sisters, Cloyce and Esty, defended her, they also
were arrested and sentenced to death. Though Esty and Nurse were
executed, Cloyce was left to linger in prison.
   Cloyce was released in 1696. Magistrates of the crown, sent to
investigate the witch trials, presented her with three gold
sovereigns in memory of her two sisters and herself. She died three
weeks after leaving prison.
   Higley and Hay hope people viewing the statue will see the three
sisters _ and everyone else persecuted during the trials _ as real
people.
   ``It'll be the first time anyone has shown these people as real
human beings,'' Higley said.
