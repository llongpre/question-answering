   The ritualistic killings of at least
13 people in Matamoros and the recent slayings of 12 in this
U.S.-Mexican border town are linked only by drugs, not cults, an
authority said.
   Police this week were investigating the discovery of at least 13
bodies in shallow graves in Matamoros, just south of Brownsville,
Texas. Suspects in the slayings have said they killed at the demand
of Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, whom they called ``godfather.'' They
said Constanzo, 26, and Sara Maria Aldrete, 24, called the
``witch,'' believed human sacrifices gave the members of cult
protection from harm and helped them in a drug-smuggling operation.
   Earlier this month, authorities in Agua Prieta discovered the
bodies of three women and nine men in a blood-splattered well and a
lime-treated spectic tank on an abandoned ranch about 1,000 yards
from the U.S. border. Police said the killings were believed to be
drug related.
   ``There is a special motive involved in the Agua Prieta case
which has nothing to do with voodoo or witchcraft or religion or
satanism,'' Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said in Tucson,
Ariz., on Thursday. ``The mutilation of the bodies, in my judgment
_ the killings were torture killings as a result of retaliation, a
squabble amongst dopers.''
   Dupnik would not elaborate on the motive, ``but it has nothing
to do with cults or religion or satanism.''
