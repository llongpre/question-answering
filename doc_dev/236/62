   EDITOR'S NOTE _ African voodoo rituals blend with Roman
Catholicism and Jimmy Swaggart-style Pentacostalism in Brazil.
Officials estimate that 90 million of Brazil's 144 million people
practice some form of spiritism, but many of them list their
``official'' religion as Catholic.

   In a packed meeting hall on Rio's
poor North Side, a Pentecostal preacher screams the names of African
voodoo gods as scores of ``possessed'' followers surge forward to be
exorcized.
   At a nearby Roman Catholic church, a priest says Mass as the
congregation sways to the throbbing beat of the ``atabaques,'' the
traditional wooden drums used in Candomble spirit rituals.
   Persecuted for years, Afro-Brazilian spirit cults such as
Candomble, Umbanda and Macumba today are regarded as serious rivals
to Christianity in Brazil, the world's largest Roman Catholic
country.
   Catholics and Protestants are striving to win converts among the
tens of millions of spirit worshipers.
   ``We want to intensify the religious dialogue with our brothers
in Candomble and Umbanda. We have more things in common than
divergencies,'' says the Rev. Antonio Aparecido da Silva, a leader
of the Catholic Church's Association of Black Pastoral Agents.
   On paper, Roman Catholicism is by far Brazil's dominant religion,
brought by Portuguese settlers 400 years ago.
   But millions also follow cults descended from Yoruba and Bantu
religions originally practiced by African slaves. Over the
centuries, the cults picked up elements of Roman Catholicism, native
Indian faiths, European witchcraft and Kardec spiritism and became
uniquely Brazilian.
   The Christian Research Institute in Sao Paulo estimates that 90
million of Brazil's 144 million people practice some form of
spiritism, although many still give their ``official'' religion as
Roman Catholic.
   ``Brazilians have multiple religious loyalties simultaneously,''
says Paul Carden, director of the institute. ``They go to
Seicho-no-Ie (a Buddhist sect) on Wednesday, an Umbanda ritual on
Friday and Mass on Sunday. The option depends on the need of the
moment.''
   Since 1970, the number of Brazilian Catholics has dropped from 92
percent of the population to 85 percent. Meanwhile, the number of
Protestants _ and especially Pentecostals _ has tripled to nearly 15
percent.
   ``Roman Catholicism is a baptizing-marrying-and-burying religion,
but not relied on for everyday needs,'' Carden says. ``The two major
options today are Afro-Brazilian spirit religions and Pentecostal
Protestantism. They are making the most converts at this time.''
   The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Brazil's
fastest-growing Pentecostal church, says that more than 90 percent
of its members are former spirit worshipers.
   Jose Paiva de Oliveira is president of Brazil's Candomble and
Umbanda Federation, which claims 50 million members. He is revered
as a ``babalao alaba,'' which he says is ``like the Pope'' of
Afro-Brazilian religions.
   Millions believe Pai Paiva (Father Paiva) can predict the future,
talk to the dead and cure the ill with herbs or by reading
``buzios,'' or sacred seashells. He often participates in the ritual
sacrificing of goats, sheep and chickens to the African gods.
   Those who follow his counsel include top-ranking government
officials including, it is said, President Jose Sarney.
   ``If I wasn't right most of the time, I wouldn't have
credibility,'' he says. ``Sixty percent of government officials come
to me...The senator who wants to be minister, the colonel who wants
to be general. Of course the top brass don't come personally. They
send underlings.''
   The religious rivalry grew in the 1970s, when a population boom
and Brazil's ``economic miracle'' brought a flood of migrants from
the countryside to urban slums.
   ``People leave their little hometown, go to the big city and,
poof, their identity is gone, they're floating,'' Carden says.
``They've got to establish roots, have a role, a community.
Pentecostalism and Afro-Brazilian religions provide it.''
   The Pentecostals also got a boost from television and the popular
programs of U.S. evangelists such as Jimmy Swaggart and Rex Humbard.
Today, dozens of U.S.-based Protestant churches operate in Brazil.
   But the big success story is a Brazilian sect, The Universal
Church of the Kingdom of God. Founded in 1977 with 30 members, today
it has more than 600 churches in Brazil, two in New York and one in
New Jersey, with a daily attendance of some 500,000. The church also
runs a publishing house, two radio stations and a morning TV program.
