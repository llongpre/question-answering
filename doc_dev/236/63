   Witch doctors told Story Musara his
stomach, distended to double the size of a football, was bewitched.
   Western-trained doctors said the 36-year-old office clerk had
cirrhosis of the liver and his bloated belly was a symptom.
   Evil spirits casting spells was the more believable diagnosis to
Musara, the product of a culture steeped in superstition, but both
healers prescribed similar treatment: tablets and herbs rich in
vitamin B, and lay off those nine bottles of beer a day.
   ``It doesn't really matter what the diagnosis is, just as long
as the treatment is right,'' said Dr. Chris McCormick, who treated
Musara. ``You should never disbelieve the power of traditional
African medicine.''
   About four-fifths of the 9.5 million people in this southern
African nation prefer the mystical rituals and elixirs to Western
medicine, according to a study by the University of Zimbabwe.
   In the last decade, the witch doctors - called n'angas - have
regained some of the respect they enjoyed in ancient African
culture.
   Zimbabwe is one of the few African countries to give them
official status, through the 24,000-member Zimbabwe National
Traditional Healers Association. The association was formed soon
after independence in 1980.
   During British colonial rule in what was called Rhodesia, white
settlers condemned witch doctors as pagans and devil worshippers.
   Nine decades of laws against witchcraft reduced the number of
people learning traditional medicine, and rapid deforestation after
independence made the 500 varieties of healing plants in Zimbabwe
more difficult to find.
   ``It's unfortunate so much has been lost,'' said Gordon
Chavunduka, head of the healers association and a university
professor of sociology.
   ``There was once a time, when people had a pain they just walked
into the bush and picked the plant. The whole country is our source
for medicine and many of us don't realize that.''
   The rediscovery of herbal medicine stems from the high cost of
modern medical treatment as well as tradition.
   A bottle of 30 vitamin C tablets costs the equivalent of $3.25,
nearly a day's pay for the average worker. Visiting a
Western-trained doctor costs up to $10 just for the consultation.
   Going to a n'anga, on the other hand, costs $2.50 to $5,
depending on the illness and form of treatment.
   Joseph Harrison, a 49-year-old n'anga, says many of his remedies
were passed down through generations of his family and new ones
come from his dreams.
   Two of Harrison's remedies are ``hloni,'' an animal quill that,
when pressed to a patient's forehead, discourages enemies from
seeking revenge, and a yellow powder he describes as ``the best
aphrodisiac in southern Africa.''
   Traditional medicine is practiced in many African countries,
   Witch doctors in central Africa suture wounds with the snapping
jaws of live soldier ants. In Tanzania and Uganda, traditional
healers treat epilepsy and blindness with herbs.
   Zimbabwean n'angas in feather headdresses claim they can heal
ailments ranging from sprains to cancer and mental disorders by
throwing bones, chanting incantations and stirring mixtures of
herbs and animal parts.
   McCormick, the physician who treated Musara, said part of the
witch doctors' success was attributable to the belief of their
patients.
   ``I know of several people who have been cured because of their
blind faith in traditional healing,'' he said.
   Sometimes, that faith can have tragic consequences.
   In the reception room of a township clinic a few miles southwest
of Harare, 6-year-old Regis Nyamba lay on a bench, his head swollen
to four times normal size by encephalitis that had made him
permanently retarded.
   He had been taken to a n'anga.
   ``Regis could be a healthy boy today if he came to my clinic
first,'' said a physician treating hin, who asked not to be
identified. ``Healers will have a bash at something and if it
doesn't work, they send the patient to me. By then it is often too
late.''
   Regular doctors accuse traditional healers of being unhygienic
and using untested medicines.
   A Zimbabwean AIDS victim claimed he contracted the deadly virus
from a n'anga who used a contaminated razor in treating him.
   N'angas accuse Western-trained physicians of arrogant
intellectualism.
   ``Some Western doctors don't understand that part of the success
behind traditional medicine is the interplay of the spiritual and
physical worlds,'' said Chavunduka, head of the healers
association.
