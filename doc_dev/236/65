   On a June day nearly 300 years ago, two
young women were hanged in Salem village, and by the end of the
summer, colonists had executed 13 women and seven men convicted of
being witches.
   Now a sculptor is nearing completion of the first memorial
honoring the victims of the Salem witch hysteria of 1692.
   ``Tourists would ask me where the witch trial memorial was and I
would have to say, `I don't know,''' said artist Yiannis
Stefanakis, who began work on the statue in August 1986. ``Then I
found out there wasn't one. I decided that, after almost 300 years,
these unfortunate people should be remembered.''
   His 14-foot bronze statue depicting three sisters accused of
witchcraft is to be dedicated in October on Gallows Hill. He is
preparing the mold for bronze casting next month, and memorial
organizers are seeking contributions to cover the $300,000 needed
for foundry and mounting expenses.
   The organizers also need city approval for use of the site.
   Stefanakis said he selected the sisters _ Sarah Cloyce, Mary
Esty and Rebecca Nurse _ as subjects for the statue because they
embodied the irony of the witch trials. Most of those accused were
well-established members of the community and devoted church goers.
And only those who confessed their guilt in court were spared.
   Nurse, who was 71 when hanged in July 1692, was the only one of
the accused witches to be excommunicated. Esty was hanged along
with seven other people on Sept. 22, 1692, the final day of the
executions.
   Cloyce was awaiting execution but was reprieved and spent her
life trying to vindicate her sisters' reputations.
   The witch hysteria began with innocent gatherings of young girls
fascinated by the mystical lore of Tituba, a Caribbean slave of a
Salem clergyman. Two sisters were so aroused by the clandestine
meetings that they would cry and shake uncontrollably. Other girls,
ages 13 to 20, began to imitate the behavior to get attention.
   Asked to explain their affliction, the girls began to accuse
townspeople of witchcraft. Nearly 200 people, including a minister
and the wife of the governor, were charged.
   Curiously, Tituba and others who confessed were spared. Only
those who steadfastly proclaimed innocence were hanged. One man was
pressed to death with rocks.
   ``The Salem witch trials were not unique. There were others in
the colonies and England,'' said Anne Farnam, president of the
Essex Institute in Salem, which houses the original trial records.
``But Salem was by far the worst episode.''
   Farnam said a large witch trial memorial proposed in 1903 was
abandoned because of cost and lingering guilt.
   ``There were still some negative feelings about the trials,''
said Farnam. ``There are even still some who don't want to
acknowledge the trials, but after 300 years we've loosened up a
bit.''
   The Essex Institute keeps a log of descendants of the accused,
some of whom are expected to attend the statue unveiling.
   ``We wish there were more artifacts from the period, but I
really don't think they wanted to save anything,'' said Patty
MacLeod, director of the Salem Witch Museum. ``I think (the statue)
will serve well, if only as a reminder that nothing like this
happens again.''
