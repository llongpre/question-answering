   In a rare revision of Mormon ritual, the
church has dropped wording that required women to pledge to obey
their husbands and portrayed the clergy of other religions as
agents of Satan.
   Women must now vow to obey God rather than their husbands in the
``endowment'' ceremony, a ritual the church teaches is necessary to
enable members to live with God after death. The ceremony is
performed only once for each person, but a member may go through it
countless times as a proxy for those who have died.
   The revised ritual, which took effect last month in ceremonies
performed in the 43 temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, is being greeted with enthusiasm by church
members who say it reflects greater sensitivity toward women and
other religions.
   ``The temple is an important part of my spiritual life and the
changes have allowed me to go to the temple with renewed joy,''
said Lavina Fielding Anderson, editor-elect of the Journal of
Mormon History.
   Mormons attending temple were read a statement from the
governing First Presidency informing them of the changes. The
statement said the revisions were unanimously approved by the
three-member body and the advisory Council of the Twelve Apostles.
   Bruce L. Olsen, managing director of the church's communications
office, said church leaders would not comment on the revisions
because temple ceremonies are considered too sacred for public
discussion.
   But some church members praised the changes.
   ``I think we're gradually moving away from the subjugation of
women,'' said Ross Peterson, co-editor of Dialogue, an independent
Mormon journal.
   ``I think (church leaders) are developing a recognition that
there are many highly intelligent, independent, capable and
educated women in our ranks today who have a great deal to offer.''
   Among other changes, a theatrical portion of the ceremony that
included a non-Mormon ``preacher'' paid by Satan to spread false
doctrine has been excised.
   ``The general consensus is that it's a breath of fresh air,''
Peterson said. ``You don't put down other churches or imply that
they are Satan's children.''
   Rebecca England, a member of the planning committee of the
independent Mormon Women's Forum, said the changes may boost temple
attendance.
   ``I know quite a number of Mormons who stopped going to the
temple because they found it demeaning,'' she said. ``And I think
this revised ceremony addresses many of the concerns that they and
I, as a feminist Mormon, have had.''
   Mormon women cannot become priests. Nor can they serve in the
local lay clergy or the church hierarchy.
   The Mormon Church, based on revelations that Joseph Smith said
were brought to him in the 1820s by heavenly messengers, claims to
have 7.3 million members, with the largest concentration of church
members in Utah, California and Idaho.
   The framework of the endowment ritual, apart from editing to its
current length of about 90 minutes and adoption of film to portray
part of the ceremony, has remained mostly intact since Smith's day.
   The endowment ceremony is considered a prerequisite for Mormons'
goal of living with God after death in the ``celestial kingdom,''
the highest stage of glory a church member can achieve.
   The ceremony includes instruction _ in a theatrical setting _ on
creation, Adam and Eve's expulsion from the Garden of Eden and
God's plan of redemption.
   Members usually go through it at young adulthood, before
marriage or prior to embarking on a mission for the church. It also
is performed prior to young males receiving the Melchizedek
priesthood, the church's highest priesthood, at age 19.
   Graphic depictions of penalties for breaking sacred covenants,
considered gruesome by some, also were among the recent deletions.
   ``It's not as harsh,'' Peterson said of the new version. ``It's
more uplifting. It's softer and gentler.''
