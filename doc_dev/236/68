   Violence and human sacrifice among believers in
occult religions usually involve a mixture of pantheistic beliefs
that often are distortions of ancient rituals.
   That kind of mingling and twisting of strange, heterodox ideas
and practices seemed apparent in the gruesome killings of at least
13 people near Matamoros, Mexico, across the Rio Grande from
Brownsville, Texas.
   There were hints of assorted primitive religions and
superstitions, perhaps stemming from traditions such as these, or
aberrations of them:
   _Satanism is characterized by its antagonism toward the
Christian deity and worship of the adversary, Satan. Devotees
consider him a supreme being of evil, rivaling God.
   Their rites consist of mockery or perversion of Christian
ritual, sometimes called the Black Mass at which Satan is believed
to preside. Ritual killings sometimes have been associated with the
cult.
   It also has been linked to assorted sexual, sado-masochistic and
psychopathic activities, including grave robberies and
blood-letting, both animal and human.
   Symbols of the cult include the pentagram, a five-pointed star
with the single point down, and the ``horned god'' in the form of a
goat.
   _Voodoo is a set of animistic beliefs and rites stemming from
Africa, and sometimes interweaving Roman Catholic practices in its
form that became pervasive in Haiti.
   Voodoo worshipers believe in one God but also in numerous
spirits or lesser deities. Magic and witchcraft have proliferated
in relation to voodoo, including casting of spells and fates on
others, good or ill. This often involves use of effigies of
another, along with bits of clothing or hair from the person.
   Certain advanced practicioners, or ``houngans,'' are considered
healers, also enabled to take posssession of the spirit of others.
Singing and dancing are part of the rituals.
   The chief deity is called ``Damballah,'' sometimes symbolized by
a serpent.
   _Santeria is an offshoot of voodoo that has spread into Latin
America and which calls its main god ``Chango,'' a god of fire and
stone. Santeria, like voodoo, involves use of various botanical
ingredients and other items considered magic.
   Related cults have derived from Santeria with pantheons of gods
such as Elegba, god of luck; Ogun, god of metal; Ifa, god of
divination, and Eshju, the trickster.
   Practices of Santeria and its related cults include animal
sacrifice, polygamy, ecstatic dancing and the appeasement of gods
by various offerings.
   Derivatives of these cults and aberrations of them also have
turned up in various parts of the United States.
