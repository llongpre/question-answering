   Witchcraft is a legitimate religion and
its churches, or covens, are entitled to the same tax breaks as
those of more established religions, the state division of taxation
has ruled.
   ``With this ruling, we witches will definitely be able to come
out of the closet and take our place in society,'' said Joyce
Siegrist, 45, high priestess of Rosegate Coven. She said the coven
has a core group of 11 members and 30 to 40 initiates.
   The ruling announced today by Tax Administrator R. Gary Clark
overturned an earlier decision that said the coven did not meet
criteria for being a church.
   The coven, also known as Our Lady of the Roses Wiccan Church,
will no longer have to pay state sales tax for supplies.
   ``This decision demonstrates that, with a properly presented
case, even unusual or small religious groups can be treated equally
with more mainstream religions by the state,'' said A. Gregory
Frazier, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who announced the
decision. He represented the witches in an administrative hearing
in May.
   Hearing officer Sandra J. Murphy, who recommended that Clark
grant the exemption, ruled July 20 that the coven fulfilled most of
the state Supreme Court's criteria for determining the legitimacy
of a religion.
   The Wiccans are a nonprofit group, not set up for the purpose of
avoiding taxes, and have a litany or system of prayer, as well as
specific doctrines and practices that all members of the coven were
expected to follow, Murphy ruled.
   Last fall, when the tax exemption was denied, the division's
questions indicated that officials were focusing on the apparent
lack of formal theology schools for training wiccan clergy, and
also on their willingness to allow members to belong to other
churches, Frazier said.
   The latter argument was rebutted when the Rev. Thomas Ahlburn,
senior minister of the First Unitarian Church of Providence,
testified that his church and many Eastern religions also permit
their members to belong to other faiths, Frazier said.
