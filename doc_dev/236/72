<TEXT>     In the brooding winter of 1691-92, a curious malady -- born of boredom,
Puritan sexual repression or whatever -- gave rise to a brief but virulent
witch-hunting hysteria. By the time it ended, hundreds of men, women and
children were accused of being servants of Satan. Nineteen were hanged; one
man was crushed to death under a pile of stones for refusing to plead guilty
or not guilty.;   For those who were set free from prison after the hysteria
died out, household goods and land were often lost to pay the jailer for their
keep. For them and others who escaped to surrounding colonies rather than face
death or imprisonment, reputations were destroyed.;   Those who pleaded guilty
to the charges (often to avoid the death sentence -- judges thought it best to
keep them alive to identify other potential victims) could hardly be expected
to return to normal lives.;   The Salem witchcraft hysteria was mercifully
brief compared with the centuries-long witch trials in England that claimed
thousands of lives. Nor was it the first and only rash of witch hysteria in
the United States, having been preceded by an equally nasty episode (15
hanged) in Hartford, Conn., in 1662.;   But witchcraft is what Salem is
remembered for, and what better time to give the cauldron of the past a stir
than at Halloween? But to discover Salem is not only to relive its shame, but
to discover its picturesque cottages and stately houses, its illustrious
history as one of Revolutionary America's main seaports and as a prosperous
commercial link with India and China.;   A quiet town on Boston's North Shore,
Salem is a cheerful, pleasant place, even under overcast skies. It has none of
Boston's brusque manners; old Yankee hospitality prevails.;   To be sure,
Salem banks on its notoriety with a plethora of witch-oriented tourist
attractions and is a haven of witchy souvenirs year-round.;   For a sound and
very non-hysterical historical perspective on the witchcraft trials, a visit
to the Salem Witch Museum in Washington Square should be the first stop.;  
Here, visitors step into a cavernous room. The doors close and voices out of
the dark begin to weave the tale of tragedy that began with the sudden
rantings of 13-year-old Ann Putnam, one of several young Puritan girls who had
listened to the black magic stories of Tituba, the West Indian slave of a
village minister.;   Eerie tableaux dramatize the wildfire spread of suspicion
and its frightening aftermath as helpless widows, pregnant women, husbands and
even a 5-year-old child were accused of being familiars of the devil. Sanity
and civility were restored only after the accusations got out of hand (the
wife of the Massachusetts governor was accused of being a witch) and several
of the girls who claimed to have been possessed by spirits recanted.;   The
Witch Dungeon, 16 Lynde St., presents a less accurate, more gruesome slant on
the trials. Not the actual dungeon but a seedy approximation, the Witch
Dungeon offers little more than cheap theatricals for the admission price.;  
The homes of various participants in the witch trials are featured on the
Heritage Trail, a pleasantly varied walking tour of old and new Salem. The
jumping off points for the self-guided tour are a visitors' kiosk in the
middle of the East India Square parking lot or Museum Place, across from the
Peabody Museum.;   The staff will provide maps and tips (they can tell you at
what hours, for instance, the House of the Seven Gables will offer public
tours, as it is often closed for private tours).;   Then just follow the red
line that starts at Salem Marketplace and winds its way through such points of
interest as the Burying Point and Pickering Wharf.;   The Burying Point is the
oldest cemetery in Salem and the final resting place of such notables as Capt.
Richard More, a passenger on the Mayflower, and John Hathorne, a judge at the
witch trials.;   Nathaniel Hawthorne, it is said, was so mortified by his
ancestor's role in the trials that he changed the spelling of his name and
refused to speak of the subject. But that didn't stop him from expiating his
nagging conscience with his tale of the mighty Pyncheon family brought low in
"The House of the Seven Gables.";   Pickering Wharf is a good place to take a
break from the tour with its gourmet eateries and fun-to-browse shops.;   The
Salem Maritime National Historic Site harkens back to Salem's bustling days as
a commercial wharf. The Custom House, where young Hawthorne was once employed,
commands a fine view of the harbor.;   The House of the Seven Gables is a
must-see, so expect crowds. Small groups are given a 12-minute videotaped
introduction to the house and its occupants and then led through the
remarkably sturdy structure (built in 1668, it was renovated several times).; 
 A highlight of the tour is the steep, claustrophobic climb up the secret
staircase between the dining room and a gabled bedroom. The hidden passage was
believed to have been used by one of the owners, Susannah Ingersoll, to hide
runaway slaves as part of the Underground Railroad. Before that, it might have
been used to hide taxable cargo from British troops.;   Ingersoll, Hawthorne's
cousin, regaled her young visitor with stories about the house's past and
inspired him to write his novel.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For tourist
