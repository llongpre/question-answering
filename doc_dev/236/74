   Whether they come in the form of occult goods aimed
at teen-agers or as amulets sold at mainstream shrines and temples,
lucky charms are a staple of Japanese life _ and a profitable
business.
   Each year tens of millions of Japanese adults flock to Shinto
shrines and Buddhist temples to buy charms said to bring luck or
ward off nearly any kind of calamity imaginable.
   During the three-day New Year's holiday alone, priests at the
Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine in Kamakura, southwest of Tokyo, expect
to sell 300,000 lucky arrows, according to Atsushi Takahashi, a
shrine spokesman.
   ``The New Year's holidays are our busiest season, and we expect
nearly 2 million people to visit,'' Takahashi said.
   If all the lucky arrows are sold, at 800 and 2,000 yen ($6 and
$16) each, the Shinto shrine will take in over $2 million. And
arrows are just one of nearly a dozen charms sold at the shrine.
   Money made from sales of amulets is considered a contribution,
and the shrines and temples pay no tax on the income.
   ``Sales of charms are what keep many shrines in the black,'' said
a priestess at another Kamakura shrine. ``But sometimes I wonder
whether people who buy the amulets aren't missing the real point,
which is faith in the divine,'' she said, requesting anonymity.
   Tourist maps are sold at the Kamakura train station which show
the location of major temples and list each one's divine favors _
including business prosperity, improved eyesight and even the
prevention of cancer.
   Most of the charms are colorful, pocket-sized pouches which
contain a talisman or drawing of a deity.
   ``The popularity of amulets may be due to the abundance of money
in Japan and people's desire for material things,'' said the
business director of Kiyomizu-dera, a major Buddhist temple in
Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital.
   ``But we don't consider that as necessarily bad,'' he said,
identifying himself only as S. Aoki. ``The point is that if they
didn't have any faith at all, they wouldn't come here in the first
place.''
   Kazushi Sano of the Association of Shinto Shrines, which
supervises the nation's 80,000 shrines, said there are no written
rules regarding amulets, but added his organization discourages
their sale in department stores or other commercial outlets.
   ``That would be rude to the gods,'' Sano said.
   ``It's hard to judge whether the amulets are effective,'' he
said, ``because they involve divine powers that people can't always
understand.''
   Charms and the principle behind them, ``genze goriaku'' or
benefit in this world, can be traced back for centuries. They are an
integral part of Japanese religious faith.
   Most Japanese at times worship in both Shinto and Buddhist
settings, often holding weddings at Shinto shrines and funerals at
Buddhist temples. Having charms from both faiths at one's home is
common.
   But a recent increase in sales of occult amulets to junior and
senior high school girls has raised eyebrows in the mass media.
``We've been flooded by reporters in the past year,'' said Kazuo
Arai, an employee of Tokyo's ``Little Witch House.''
   Though not affiliated with either the Buddhist or Shinto faith,
the shop draws a steady flow of schoolgirls with nearly 200 kinds of
charms supposed to improve one's popularity or love life.
   ``Little Witch House'' itself is small, but is run by a company
which publishes ``My Birthday,'' a monthly teen magazine with a
circulation of roughly 400,000 nationwide. Much of the magazine is
devoted to explanations of fortune-telling, charms and incantations,
Arai said.
   ``The girls come here seeking help with problems they face in
their day-to-day lives,'' he said. ``They're young, inexperienced
and look to the charms to help them in situations they don't know
how to handle.''
   ``What the girls are doing is basically the same as what adults
do when they buy charms at shrines,'' Arai said, adding that they
may be imitating their parents, who can often be found at shrines
during the examination season buying amulets said to help students
pass.
   Most of the charms _ pendants, rings and brooches _ sell for less
than $10.
   ``They don't seem to be very serious about the charms' effects,''
he said, ``and I think they are finding a good balance'' between
reality and fantasy.
   Arai said visitors are told ``some problems can't be solved by
magic,'' and employees offer a sympathetic ear to girls who may just
need to talk about their troubles.
