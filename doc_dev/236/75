BURNING ISSY, Melvin Burgess, Andersen Press, Pounds 6.99, 155pp.
THE witch, that hardy perennial of literature for children cackles lustily,
dresses top-to-toe in black, with pointed hat, pointed shoes - and a pointed
chin. Her long, horny finger nail beckons from behind every gnarled oak.
Though timelessly old, she is youthfully mischievous; and when she flies
through the starless skies at midnight, her tatterdemalion skirts stream
back in the wind. And she may or may not on closer inspection prove to be
your own grandmother. . .
In short, the witch of the average children's book has been reduced to a
harmless figure of fun: neutered; superannuated; robbed of her sting.
Which leads us on to a puzzling question: why cannot writers of books for
children, given their degree of fascination with these poor creatures, ever
tell the truth about witches? Melvin Burgess has endeavoured to do just that
in his second novel, Burning Issy, which deals with the persecution of the
tribe in 17th-century England.
One difficulty, of course, is that the subject is frightening, morally
repugnant, and a horrifying indictment of the established church; and this
novel does not try to avoid these problems. In fact, it is brutally honest
in its treatment of the subject, and for that reason alone parents who buy
this book for their children or recommend it to others should be warned of
such incidents as the one in which a parson, in order to extract a
confession from a child that he believes to be a witch, grasps hold of her
wrist and holds it as steadily as he is able over a naked candle flame.
This remarkable historical novel erupts into life from the very first page.
A beggarwoman thrusts a warm bundle into the arms of a man who happens to be
passing through the market square of a small village in the West Riding of
Yorkshire. The unwilling, though kindly, recipient carries the unexpected
gift, wrapped in filthy rags and coughing like a cat, back home to his son
and daughter. It's a pitiful sight indeed beneath the swaddling bands - all
blotched, red skin on its two-year-old face as if it had been burnt in a
fire.
The child, Isabel, is both welcome and not welcome in these parts. The
villagers whisper that it's the devil in hell who owns her, and that's why
they call her Burning Issy. The child herself is terribly afraid of fire,
even going so far as to shun the light of the candle at her own bedside. It
seems that she can never quite efface some terrible, searing memory of
burning.
Solitary by nature, her only playmate is Jennet, daughter of a local witch
who, some day soon, will be obliged to pledge herself to the devil too.
Issy, fascinated by the goings on up Malkin Hill where the witches weave
their spells, sneaks up with her foster-brother to observe the hags shaping
their wax images as they spit and curse into the flames.
The oldest witch senses the presence of strangers and they are caught; but
Issy, possessed of her own brand of magic, pitches the old crone Demdyke
into the fire, and for that act of gross impertinence the witch makes an
image of the foster-brother Ghyll and threatens to kill him, little by
little over the next fortnight or so by melting his effigy over the fire.
The only way out is for Issy to give herself, body and soul, to the witches;
and, in their opinion, that is only right and proper. Has she not already
demonstrated by the use of her own strange powers that she is no ordinary
mortal?
Freedom comes with the return of the woman who gave Issy away. Having
tricked Issy's adopted family into believing she has wrested the image of
Ghyll from the witches, she and Issy travel north to the woman's house.
But the forces of repression in the shape of the brutal witch-finder Bawdwen
are closing in. At the novel's end Issy, Jennet and the other local witches
are captured and forced to recant or suffer the terrible consequences.
This novel helps us to understand not only that many witches were nothing
worse than poor, persecuted beggars, but also that their beliefs were
grounded in a set of religious practices that often antedated Christianity;
vestiges of a paganism that the furiously proselytising Christians of the
day could show no mercy toward.
There was a terrible climate of superstition and fear in which the words
'Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live' were intoned from every pulpit.
For all the impressive simplicity of the language of this book, the
complexity of its ideas and the stark, brutal honesty of so many of its
scenes suggests a readership of 10 and above.
