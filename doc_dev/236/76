DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAIR CLAIMING TO RUN CHURCH ARE CHARGED WITH 
PROSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canyon Country husband and wife who say they operate a church in which sexual 
acts are part of the religious services have been charged with operating a 
house of prostitution, the Los Angeles city attorney's office reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy, 51, and Mary Ellen Tracy, 46, were charged Tuesday with the 
offense, a misdemeanor that carries a penalty of up to six months in jail and a 
fine of $1,000, said Deputy City Atty. Alice Hand. Mary Ellen Tracy also was 
charged with two misdemeanor counts of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys operate the Church of the Most High Goddess, in which Mary Ellen 
Tracy carries the title of high priestess, in a house in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys claim they operate a legitimate church in which high priestesses 
absolve the sins of male followers through intercourse in sexual religious 
rites that they say predate Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
They contend that the church's rites are protected by the First Amendment of 
the U.S. Constitution, guaranteeing freedom of religion. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what they claim," Hand said. "It is a First Amendment issue and we will 
have to deal with it," if the Tracys raise that as a defense, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested the couple at the house April 11. Authorities said 
Mary Ellen Tracy asked an undercover vice officer for a $150 donation for the 
church and told him to perform oral sex on her to show his allegiance to the 
church. The Tracys were arrested after the officer refused and was ordered to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy was originally charged with pimping, but the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office declined to file the felony charge and referred his 
case to the city attorney's office.
