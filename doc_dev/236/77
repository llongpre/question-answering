   Two dozen islanders accused of
torturing to death six people have told a court they were possessed
by the devil or seized by religious fervor during a hunt for evil
spirits in 1987.
   All week the jury has been considering the case, which focuses
on two days of terror on the remote atoll of Faaite after a visit
by three women who claimed to represent a charismatic movement
founded in the United States.
   Psychiatric experts testified that the charismatic movement,
mixed with ancient Polynesian beliefs in the supernatural, produced
a dangerous mix on an isolated island lacking institutional
authority.
   The three women, whom investigators ruled never ordered the
killings, are not on trial.
   But witnesses say the violence had its roots in a visit that
August by the three women from Tahiti, about 310 miles west.
   ``I had a spirit under the spell of the devil,'' one of the
islanders from Faaite told Judge Marcel Bihl of the Papeete
Tribunal on Thursday. ``I lost my head, but I believed I was on the
holy path, shunning the evil fighting within me.''
   Other defendants, clad in bright tropical shirts and white
trousers, said they lost self-control during the search for demons
and sorcerers.
   The 24 defendants are charged with murder, inciting violence and
other offenses.
   The women claimed to represent the Charismatic Renewal, a
movement founded in 1967 and affiliated with the Roman Catholic
Church. However, church authorities said they had no connection
with the women.
   At the time, the movement already had a strong following on
Faaite, an atoll studded with white sand beaches and about 180
residents.
   The women, regarded as priestesses by the islanders, took over
the tiny whitewashed church and, by force of personality, replaced
the lay preacher as the religious authority on the atoll, witnesses
said.
   The trio's leader, Alexandra Silvia, conducted services in a
trance and told frightened islanders of her visions that God would
abandon Faaite, the defendants said.
   She suggested demons were in their midst, and the population
began viewing with suspicion fellow islanders who failed to attend
her daily services.
   In late August that year, the trio left Faaite and gave roses to
seven islanders, designating them as disciples to continue their
work.
   On Sept. 2, Ioane Harris, the assistant mayor, publicly
denounced what was happening.
   One defendant told the court he looked into Harris' eyes and
believed him possessed. Maddened villagers tightened a cord around
Harris' neck, held a crucifix before his face, and beat him
senseless.
   They then drowned Harris during a ritual in the lagoon and threw
his body on a bonfire built under palm trees in front of the church.
   ``It was necessary to purify him,'' one of the defendants calmly
told the court. ``It was necessary to purify the village.''
   Five more people were killed over the next two days. One, a
mentally handicapped young man who claimed to be Jesus Christ, was
burned alive.
   Informed of the killings, the mayor arrived on Sept. 4 with a
Catholic priest and a squadron of police in time to stop further
violence.
   The jury was expected reach a verdict after two weeks' testimony.
