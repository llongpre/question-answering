<HEAD>Couple Charged with Prostitution Say Sex Is Their Religion</HEAD>

   A couple offering sex to followers of their
Church of the Most High Goddess say their arrests on
prostitution-related charges violate their religious freedom.
   Will and Mary Ellen Tracy were arrested last week, Mrs. Tracy
for investigation of prostitution and her husband for investigation
of pimping. Both are free on $2,000 bail.
   Mrs. Tracy, 46, said she and other ``priestesses'' absolve the
sins of male followers with sex acts in what she claims is a
revival of ancient Egyptian religious rites. Her husband said
followers must contribute money or services to take part in the
rituals.
   ``Anything God wants from me, I will give him,'' Mrs. Tracy
said. ``If he wants me to be monogamous, I'll be monogamous. If he
says go have sex with 20,000 men, I'll do it.''
   Tracy, 51, said he will ask that the charges be dismissed on
grounds of freedom of religion.
   ``If you accept money for a sex act, it's prostitution,'' said
Detective Alan Vanderpool.
   The couple live in Santa Clarita, 30 miles from downtown Los
Angeles, but operate their church out of a four-bedroom,
Spanish-style rented house near Beverly Hills.
   The sparsely furnished house has no pews or pulpit. The few wall
hangings include posters of movie stars and a nude photograph of
Mrs. Tracy. The priestesses wear strapless red-sequined dresses,
fish-net hose and black spiked heels.
