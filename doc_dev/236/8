   A coven of witches has won tax exempt
status in Rhode Island as a legitimate religious group.
   ``With this ruling, we witches will definitely be able to come
out of the closet and take our place in society,'' said the coven's
high priestess, Joyce Siegrist, also known as Lady Genevieve.
   Tax Administrator R. Gary Clark said he overturned the state's
initial ruling, that the Rosegate Coven did not qualify for a sales
tax exemption, because it proved on appeal that it met the
guidelines for legitimate church groups as set out by a 1986 Rhode
Island Supreme Court ruling.
   Administrative Hearing Officer Sandra Murphy said Tuesday that
she heard about 2{ hours of testimony in May and undertook
extensive research on her own before recommending the action that
Clark took on July 28.
   ``I'm happy that anyone who is practicing a religion in earnest
is able to do so without state impediment,'' she said.
   The coven, also known as Our Lady of the Roses Wiccan Church,
has 30 to 40 members in Rhode Island and meets approximately three
times a month for rituals, said Siegrist.
   The core of the Wiccan worship is belief in a diety with male
and female attributes, whose psychic energy can be tapped. Although
the power can be used for good or ill will, witches do not use it
for destructive purposes.
   When the tax exemption was denied last fall, the division's
questions indicated tax officials were focusing on the apparent
lack of formal theology schools for training Wiccan clergy, said A.
Gregory Frazier, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who
represented the witches in the administrative hearing in May.
   He said officials also questioned the group's willingness to
allow members to belong to other churches while claiming coven
membership.
   That argument was rebutted when the Rev. Thomas Ahlburn, senior
minister of the First Unitarian Church of Providence, testified
that his church and many Eastern religions also permit members to
belong to other faiths, Frazier said.
   Under state laws, a religion must be a nonprofit group, not set
up for the purpose of avoiding taxes. It must have a litany or
system of prayer, as well as specific doctrines and practices that
its members are expected to follow.
   Clark said the connotation of ``witches'' may have made it more
difficult for the state.
   ``If all the facts were identical and they were not called
witches but were called brothers and sisters, for example, it
probably would not have been anywhere nearly so'' controversial, he
said.
   Murphy said she didn't think the decision would set a precedent.
   ``This was very logical, very straightforward and very
unemotional,'' she said, noting the coven is empowered by the state
to officiate over marriage and burials.
