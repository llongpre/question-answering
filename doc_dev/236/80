   Satirical cartoonists have launched a scathing
attack on Buddhism and superstitious rituals such as fortunetelling,
which are enjoying a resurgence after 40 years of communist
suppression.
   ``Today you will suffer financial losses,'' a fortuneteller in
one cartoon intones as he holds a customer's palm in one hand and
takes a hefty fee with the other.
   Another shows a man with a bad leg going from temple to temple to
pray for healing and finally being carried into a hospital on a
stretcher.
   More than 120 such cartoons were part of an exhibit called ``Away
With Superstition and Ignorance,'' shown this week in Beijing and
four other cities.
   Cartoonist Xu Jin said the artists timed the show for just before
the Feb. 6 celebration of the Lunar New Year, traditionally one of
the most superstitious dates on the Chinese calendar.
   Setting off firecrackers, still popular on the holiday,
originally was intended to scare away evil spirits.
   ``We have a mission to help educate people,'' Xu said. ``It's not
just a matter of people losing money to witch doctors and
fortunetellers, it's also a problem of increasing the scientific
spirit.''
   The rebuilding of temples and the worship of Buddhist gods also
come in for heavy attack.
   One cartoon shows a man answering the telephone in a government
office and telling the caller that all the officials have ``gone to
the front line.''
   ``Where exactly?''
   ``To the Dragon King Temple to burn incense,'' comes the answer.
   Wang Xiuqiao of the Chinese Research Institute for Popularizing
Science, which helped organize the exhibit, said it often is hard to
separate religion from superstition.
   ``Religion often uses superstitious elements, for example, if it
claims to be able to cure people who are ill,'' she said.
   China says it allows freedom of religion. But it is more tolerant
of Christianity _ which most Chinese see as alien _ and other
minority religions than it is of Buddhism, which has deep roots
among the Chinese and greater potential to spread.
   Religion and superstition played a large role in daily life in
pre-Communist China, especially in the countryside.
   Omens were seen in everyday events _ such as a crow passing
overhead _ and people consulted diviners before making important
decisions. Single women made offerings at ``maidens' temples'' in
hopes of finding good husbands, and married women prayed to other
gods for sons.
   The communists quashed most such practices after taking power in
1949. But the rituals have enjoyed a comeback recently as the
government has relaxed controls and peasants have acquired more
money.
   In the prosperous southeast, rice fields once again are dotted
with small ancestral shrines and tombs newly built by peasants or
renovated after decades of neglect.
   ``After they build a new house and buy a washing machine, (rich
peasants) have nothing else to spend money on so they rebuild the
family shrine,'' Ms. Wang said. ``Also, they want to show their
gratitude for their wealth and ask the gods to keep the government
from changing its policies'' of allowing some private industry.
   The official media often complain that building shrines and tombs
wastes money and land, and call diviners and witch doctors cheats.
   All were targets at the cartoon exhibit, which drew about 24,000
viewers during an eight-day showing at the China Art Gallery in
Beijing.
   One that drew chuckles from viewers showed a spiritualist telling
a fearful family that their goat, chicken and TV set harbored evil
spirits. The spiritualist loaded them onto his cart and set off,
calling cheerfully, ``Now I have all the evil spirits.''
   Others took swipes at the new fad of computerized fortunetelling,
touted by its hawkers as scientific. Customers feed their birthdate
into a computer and get a printout with their fortune.
   ``We just came to laugh; hardly anyone in Beijing believes in
these things,'' said a young woman who giggled over the cartoons
with her boyfriend.
   Ms. Wang agreed most city dwellers aren't as superstitious as
rural residents.
   But she said even in the cities people are turning to old beliefs
because of a crisis of faith in the government.
   During the 1960s and 1970s, she said, ``people developed the
habit of worshipping Chairman Mao (Tse-tung) as a god. Now they
don't have Mao so they look for other gods.''
