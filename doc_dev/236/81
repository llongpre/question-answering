<LEADPARA>  Perhaps I'm naive, but I'm still amazed at how persistently hatred wraps
itself in religion and bigotry calls itself conservatism. Ken Kersey's "Gay
rights bill threatens society" (It Seems to Me, Sept. 13) clumsily performs
this hackneyed charade once again, with feeling.;   To accept Kersey's view is
to believe that gays are diseased and character disordered sub-human ogres
slavering to molest children and infect heterosexuals, with an army of
attorneys waiting in the wings to wreak legal havoc upon those who protest
their pillage. AB 101, Kersey obliquely claims, would force child care centers
to hire avowed child molesters.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Kersey would have us believe that, but for local gay-rights ordinances,
venereal disease would vanish, women would not be battered, and the homeless
would all find homes. Can a reasonable person believe any of this?;   If Ken
Kersey's calumny is "religiously oriented," to use his phrase, I shudder to
think what secular order he would endorse. The one that first comes to mind
was supposed to last a thousand years, but didn't.;   Kersey's arguments do
not persuade this heterosexual male Republican. But I am persuaded that AB 101
would legally limit the means by which bigots could act out in public business
their fearful hatred of those whose imagined private bedroom behavior they
disapprove. Private consensual sexual acts among adults are protected from
state intrusion by California law. All AB 101 will endanger is the right of
the hateful to conduct witch hunts and inquisitions into the legally private
activity of consenting adults.;   -- George Byrd;   Menlo Park; I never cease
to be amazed at the way clever people can use arguments that appear to be
rational to justify bigotry and prejudice. The article by Ken Kersey in his
objections to AB 101 is a case in point. If his arguments appear rational, it
is only because his basic premises are wrong and his allegations totally
inaccurate.;   Kersey first assumes that "homosexuality is unlike present
legal minorities" because, he alleges, it is a matter of moral choice.
Actually, sexual orientation is probably determined before birth, is seldom if
ever chosen by a person, and is no more a matter of morality than is
left-handedness or hair color.;   Then, he illustrates his argument with
irrelevant information. For example, he alleges that AB 101 would force
religiously run organizations to be shut down if they do not comply. Actually,
they are exempted. It is sad and ironic, however, that religious organizations
should be exempted, for it seems to me that they should be at the forefront of
the battle for equal rights for everyone.;   The approximately 10 percent of
the human population that is born lesbian or gay has spiritual gifts that are
needed by our churches and communities as a whole. Kersey's bigotry perversely
illustrates why gay and lesbian people need and surely deserve equal
protection under our laws.;   -- Richard K. Miller;   Minister, First
Christian Church;   San Jose; I am thoroughly disappointed that the Mercury
News would print an article like Ken Kersey's, thus giving it a veil of
legitimacy. Although homophobes like himself will probably never change their
beliefs, perhaps some uninformed reader might actually get caught up in his
vitriol and believe his twisted logic. Perhaps Kersey's concern about the cost
to taxpayers of "needless" lawsuits can be offset by removing the tax-exempt
status of politicized churches like his own.;   -- Scott Lechert;   Oakland;
Should anti-discrimination laws be struck down for the sake of fear and hate?
This seems to be Ken Kersey's message. He would have homosexuals discriminated
against in housing and employment for fear of spreading disease, increasing
homosexual rape and compromising his own morality.;   If one can discriminate
on the basis of perceived morality then there are a great many witches for the
reverend to hunt. Would he also turn away sexually active single
heterosexuals, single parents, divorcees, people with unusual hairstyles?;  
Should we foster acceptance of our differences and work toward peaceful
communities for all? Or should the witch hunt begin?;   -- Joe Miller;   San
Jose; If Kersey is concerned about who goes into our day care centers, I
suggest he start a campaign to fire all straight men. Straight men commit more
than 90 percent of all molestations, rapes and all violent crimes in general.
Based on these statistics, it is men like Kersey who are the risk to our
children, not us.;   Loretta M. Jackson;   Mountain View; I suppose that a
paper of the Mercury News' stature must present all sides to an issue, but the
article by Ken Kersey was so bereft of intelligence, understanding and logic
that I must object.;   Kersey falls into the usual trap that snares most gay
rights detractors who base objections on religious grounds, that sexual
orientation is not an immutable condition, therefore it should not enjoy true
minority status. Religious belief is hardly something over which a person has
no control. By Kersey's argument, all laws protecting religious beliefs should
be struck down.;   If Kersey would actually read AB 101, he would find that
there is no mention whatsoever of "homosexual behavior." It merely provides
that people not be discriminated solely on the basis of sexual orientation.
That is it and that is all of it.;   -- John M. Higdon;   San Jose  </TEXT>
