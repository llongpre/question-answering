   Name-calling is common in election campaigns, but it's unusual when a candidate can call an opponent a witch -- and be right. 
Such is the case in Salem, Mass., where one of the potential candidates for mayor is a self-proclaimed witch. 

   The mayoral race in this city of 38,000, famous for its witch trials of 1692, began to heat up several weeks ago after an anonymous caller phoned a local newspaper and suggested there was a warlock on the City Council. 
No name was mentioned, but the implication was clear, says Councilman Robert Gauthier, who claims the charge -- which he denies -- was directed at him. 

   "It just so happens that as soon as I took out my papers to run for mayor," he explains, "someone kept calling in and saying, 'Who's the warlock on the City Council?'" 

   Eventually, the brewing controversy came to the attention of Anthony Salvo, the incumbent mayor. 
Hoisting the flag of reason, he explained that "anybody with average intelligence doesn't believe in witchcraft." 

   Such remarks prompted Laurie Cabot, a self-proclaimed witch, to request an application. 
"If there's a problem of knowing who's the witch running for mayor," she declares, "I'll run for mayor." 

   Ms. Cabot, a local businesswoman given to wearing a long dark cape, is a familiar figure in Salem. 
She has twice asked the city to appoint her Salem's "official witch" but so far has been turned down. 
The purpose of her candidacy, she says, would be to exercise her "constitutional rights and the rights of all witches" and to "educate" people who don't understand what witchcraft is. 

   At least two of Ms. Cabot's potential opponents (no one has yet filed officially to enter the race) seem unworried about the prospect of any tactical hex throwing. 
"She's a lot stronger than people thought she was," says Mr. Salvo. 
"I take her seriously like I take every other candidate seriously." 
Mr. Gauthier, who believes his family friendship with Ms. Cabot led to the rumor about him, adds, "She has a lot of friends in this city." 

   Josephine Fusco, the city clerk, appears only slightly less blase. 
"We never expected the Witch City was going to have a witch for a candidate," she says. 
"It's just unusual." 

   For her part, Ms. Cabot is confident of her chances. 
"I know I would win if I run," she says, noting that she's probably a shoo-in among Salem's voting-age witches.
