   A sculptor says that opponents of a proposed
statue in memory of 20 men and women executed 300 years ago as
witches are just trying to foreget what happened.
   Yiannis Stefanakis is trying to give the city a 14-foot-high
bronze to commemorate the witches, but some residents say greed is
behind the seven-ton sculpture they say will be a tourist
attraction.
   Supporters say the critics want to forget what happened in 1692
and the sculpture is a public apology to the 20 people executed
then.
   ``People like them are the same people who 300 years ago caused
the death of these 20 people. They are still doing it today. It's
an injustice,'' Stefanakis told The Boston Globe in a story
published today.
   Stefanakis, who said he supports himself by making wax molds for
a chocolate company, was inspired to create the statue three years
ago by ``Three Sovereigns for Sarah,'' a film about the Salem
witchcraft trials.
   He said he raised $2,500 in private financing and also got
donations of transportation and a rent-free studio. He said he
hoped to present his work to the city as a gift.
   ``Most people want to forget about what happened in 1692,'' he
said. ``Three hundred years have gone by, and they have done
nothing to commemorate those victims. I decide to step in and make
a statue, and now they form a committee.''
   The Salem Witchcraft Tercentenary Ad Hoc Committee opposes the
statue and is planning an official memorial, said the Rev. John
Szala of the First Salem Church, who heads the committee.
   He said the committee believes planting trees or putting the
names of the 20 victims on plaques with an eternal flame would be
more appropriate.
   And, he said Stefanakis is an outsider who has ignored local
opinion and is ``using a tragic event to make a dollar.''
   ``No one knows how much it cost,'' Szala said. ``To whom does
this man answer? Who receives his financial reports?''
   Stefanakis' publicist, Eleanor Parker, said Stefanakis may make
$40,000 for his three years of work.
   Wayne Higley Jr., a descendant of Rebecca Nurse, one of the
victims depicted in the sculpture, supports the statue.
   ``When the statue is unveiled in October, people will see the
expression of Sarah Cloyce (another victim) looking down at them,''
he said. ``The look on her face says, `Look at what they have done.
Don't let this happen.'
