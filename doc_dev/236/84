<P>
A Canyon Country woman who claims to be a priestess of an ancient Egyptian 
religion was convicted today of two misdemeanor counts of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
After 3 1/2 days of deliberations, the six-man, six-woman Municipal Court jury 
returned the guilty verdict against Mary Ellen Tracy, 46, also known as Sabrina 
Aset, high priestess of the Church of the Most High Goddess. The jury also 
convicted her husband, Wilbur, 51, of one count of operating a house of 
prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had contended that under the tenets of their religion, sex was used 
as a purification ritual and that Mary Ellen Tracy had to have sex with 
thousands of men to attain her standing as a high priestess. But the jury 
apparently decided the Tracy's West Los Angeles two-story, Spanish-style 
"church," complete with an office, living room and four bedrooms, was a thinly 
veiled brothel.
