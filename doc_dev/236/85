   An Afro-Cuban sect that slaughters chickens,
turtles and sometimes goats as part of its ritual is challenging a
town's ban on the practice, saying it violates religious freedom.
   A trial began last week in the federal lawsuit filed by Santeria
priest Ernesto Pichardo and his Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye in
suburban Hialeah, the first known church in the usually secretive
sect.
   The dispute between the Santeria church and the town of Hialeah
raises questions of religious persecution and animal cruelty as it
delves into the most unsettling Santeria ritual _ animal sacrifice.
   The religion was linked _ mistakenly _ to a sadistic
drug-smuggling cult after human remains were found in Matamoros,
Mexico, last April.
   Experts on Santeria and its practitioners have said that human
bones are not part of any Santeria ritual. But chickens, pigeons,
doves and turtles, and occasionally goats and pigs, are sacrificed
for the initiation of priests, in faith-healing and for help in
love, business and family affairs.
   Sometimes, the animal remains are cooked and eaten, but in some
cases they are left by roadsides or in other public places.
   The trial in Pichardo's lawsuit began Monday and will continue
this week. U.S. District Judge Eugene Spellman is hearing the case
without a jury.
   Officials in Hialeah, a predominantly Hispanic city on the edge
of Miami, deny that their efforts to limit Santeria rituals amount
to an attack on religion. Instead, they cite such factors as the
possibility of infection spread by animal carcasses, cruelty to
animals, and the danger that children who witness the sacrifices
will be psychologically scarred.
   In court documents, city attorneys noted that bans on snake
handling and marijuana smoking have been upheld even when the acts
are considered an integral element of a religion.
   Santeria, believed to have more than 50,000 followers in the
Miami area, had its origins in the region of Africa that is now
Nigeria. It was carried by slaves to Cuban sugar plantations,
adopted many Roman Catholic saints as guardians and evolved into a
folk religion that remains largely underground. Most adherents are
Cubans or Cuban-Americans.
   Pichardo, 34, says he is trying to remove the stigma against the
religion as a low-class practice and institutionalize its rituals,
which previously have been performed largely in private homes.
   After he announced plans for his church in 1987, the city
delayed its opening with extensive zoning and building code
requirements.
   ``Once we complied with everything they threw at us, then it
became an animal sacrifice issue,'' said Pichardo.
   The council voted to outlaw sacrifices, allow animal slaughter
only for human consumption, prohibit the possession of animals for
slaughter or sacrifice, and incorporate the state animal cruelty
law in city ordinances.
   Pichardo accuses city council members of discrimination and
misusing their political power because of their personal religious
convictions.
   Dr. Charles Wetli, a witness for the church, testified last week
that most Santeria adherents ``are practicing it because of white
magic or neutral magic'' to produce good results, not to hurt
others. As chief deputy medical examiner in Dade County, he has
studied Afro-Caribbean religions as part of his work.
   In Santeria ceremonies, a few feathers are sometimes plucked
from live chickens, but never all of them, he said. A bisected goat
left on a Miami Beach street and cases when human bones _
apparently obtained after people died of normal causes _ have been
boiled in cauldrons were, in his view, signs of a different
Afro-Caribbean cult called Palo Mayombe.
   Pichardo said Santeria's history of practice in the home hurts
his effort to bring the religion into the open, and may have
contributed to the mistaken link of Santeria to the Matamoros mass
killings this spring.
   The alleged leader of the Matamoros cult, Adolfo de Jesus
Constanzo, was a Cuban-American raised in Miami around Santeria
practices, but the cult's use of human bones in its rituals
deviated from accepted Santeria principles.
   ``It sets off this domino effect and sort of darkens the idea in
people's minds of what we are,'' Pichardo said. But the attention
generated by the mass murders also helped educate the public, he
said.
   ``There is an enormous lack of material in English that
seriously deals with the subject matter,'' Pichardo said, ``which
allows for a lot of myths to roam around.''
