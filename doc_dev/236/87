DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE REFUSES TO HALT SEX CHURCH INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge on Monday refused for the third time to issue a court order 
barring police from investigating a Canyon Country couple who operate a sex 
church, which prosecutors say is a front for prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William M. Byrne Jr. had twice refused to grant the court 
order requested by Will and Mary Ellen Tracy, the self-proclaimed high priest 
and priestess of the Church of the Most High Goddess. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys argued that the First Amendment shields their church, which includes 
sex acts in its rituals, from prosecution and have said that they will continue 
to practice their religion. Police said the Tracys are practicing prostitution 
because male worshipers make donations, often cash, to participate in sexual 
rituals with Mary Ellen Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Municipal Court jury believed police and convicted Mary Ellen 
Tracy in September on two counts of prostitution and one count of running a 
house of prostitution. Her husband was convicted of running a house of 
prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys are free on bail while they appeal.
