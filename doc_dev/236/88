   A church plans to burn books by Moslems and
Jehovah's Witnesses along with pornography and ``satanic
paraphernalia'' on Saturday in what the church's pastor hopes will
become an annual event.
   ``Our purpose is to rid our city - and throughout the years
we'll continue to rid our city - of more satanic paraphernalia, and
then we believe the Holy Spirit will have a greater freedom to
flow,'' the Rev. Donovan Larkins, founder of the non-denominational
Victory Bible Church, said Thursday.
   The church distributed fliers in several neighborhoods this week
inviting people to bring in books by Moslems and Jehovah's
Witnesses; books on New Age religions, witchcraft, yoga,
transcendental meditation and Christian Science; horoscopes;
playing cards; and ``secular albums, tapes and bumper stickers.''
   Larkins said he doesn't care if his bonfire offends everyone in
the city.
   ``What God says is what's important to me,'' he said.
   He suggested that anyone who wonders why items from other
religions were chosen should ``come to our church ... so that we
can expound to them the unadulterated word of God.''
