   Neighbors say the family of the suspected cult
leader implicated in a dozen gruesome slayings in Mexico followed
the Santeria religion and practiced animal sacrifices at their
suburban Miami home.
   But an anthropologist who studies Santeria, an Afro-Christian
religion, on Thursday discounted its role in the ritual murders
near Matamoros, Mexico.
   Santeria is a largely underground religion that melded the
beliefs of slaves from present-day Nigeria with Hispanic culture in
the Caribbean and parts of South America, said Mercedes Sandoval, a
professor at Miami-Dade Community College, who has studied Santeria
for nearly 40 years.
   She estimated as many as 25,000 people in South Florida are
Santeria followers, and they also can be found in New York, New
Jersey, California, Venezuela, Colombia and Spain.
   Blood from Santeria animal sacrifices can form an alliance with
gods of nature and protect the believers, a reason offered by
Mexican authorities as a motive for the killings at a ranch used by
marijuana smugglers, she said.
   Suspected cult leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo ``may have been
exposed to Santeria and other magical systems,'' Ms. Sandoval said.
``He probably was seeking assistance from magical systems to get
protection, and then he himself developed his own ritual.''
   Constanzo grew up in Dade County, west of Miami, in a
Cuban-American family that left headless chickens, geese and goats
_ animals used in Santeria rituals _ on doorsteps and street
corners in their middle-class neighborhood, said neighbors.
Constanzo lived in the area until 1984.
   But Ms. Sandoval said human sacrifice has never been a part of
Santeria practices. She noted Santeria symbols were present in the
farm shack where investigators believe the victims were killed, but
pictures also revealed symbols such as human skulls, used in the
practice of palo mayombe, a separate religion that has its origins
in the Congo.
   ``I think I saw an ochosi (on television reports on the
slayings). That's the god of hunting from West Africa. He is also
perceived as the god that owns the traps,'' she explained. ``Many
people who are in conflict with the authorities pray to him to get
them out of jail. That is a connection with Santeria.''
   ``Even people who practice palo mayombe don't kill,'' she said.
   Dr. Charles Wetli, Dade County deputy chief medical examiner who
has been studying Afro-Caribbean cults for more than 10 years,
agreed ``the basic tenets are not ones that encourage human
sacrifice.''
   Ms. Sandoval has contacted several Santeros, Santeria priests,
in the Miami area since the ritual aspect of the slayings became
known, but there was no indication Constanzo had been initiated as
a priest.
   She suspected Constanzo was dabbling in magical religions to
terrorize his followers as a way of controlling them.
   ``I think what we have here is a case of some very sociopathic
people ... that may have been exposed to Santeria or some other
magical system,'' Ms. Sandoval said. ``I think we are dealing with
a deranged person.''
   Willie Ramos of Miami, a Santeria priest who leads initiation
ceremonies for new priests, said he was infuriated by stories
linking the Mexican cult to the practice of Santeria, voodoo and
other rituals with a base in the Caribbean.
   ``He's had some sort of exposure to Santeria, I wouldn't deny
that, but I wouldn't say he's a Santeria priest,'' Ramos said of
Constanzo.
   Former neighbors recalled the Constanzos as Santeria followers
and referred to Constanzo's mother as a witch.
   ``They had sheep and chickens in the back yard,'' said Carmen
Reigada, another neighbor. ``They were troublemakers.''
   Norma Brito, who bought the Constanzo's house after a bank
foreclosed on it in 1984, said she found the remains of an altar
with candles, wax and fruit when she moved in.
   Law enforcement agencies in South Florida refused to say whether
any of Constanzo's relatives still live in the area.
   A warning that Constanzo mighting be heading for South Florida
is being read to Metro-Dade officers at roll calls, but ``at this
time we're not taking any active stance on it,'' said Detective
Marie Chaney.
