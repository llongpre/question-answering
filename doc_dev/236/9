   ``I have performed marriages and have tax-exempt status, but I
only know 12 or 15 others who have tax exempt-status,'' she says.
``You really have to fight to get it.''
   ``Many of us in California perform marriages, but here if you go
through the trouble to sign the papers and take a blood test, you
can get licensed to perform marriages,'' Starhawk says. ``A dog
could get the license here.''
   Lady Sabrina, whose church is open to the public on Friday
nights, says she never heard of Charles Arnold, but that does not
surprise her.
   ``For a while a woman in Salem, Mass., who was picketing the
movie `Witches of Eastwick' became very well known. Since there is
no central organization, whoever makes the most noise becomes the
most prominent witch.''
   Arnold, a soft-spokeman man with a beard, says he was initiated
as a priest in witchcraft traditions dating back thousands of years.
   Each coven, grove or temple chooses its own rituals and vows.
Some covens meet in the nude, but Arnold's group prefers robes.
   He offered this description of a Wiccan wedding:
   Inside a magical circle, the male and female divinities are
summoned along with the guardians of the four elements _ air,
water, fire and earth.
   The groom's left hand is bound to the bride's right hand and
some choose to draw blood from their skin and touch like blood
brothers.
   Couples exchange rings, bracelets or floral crowns; step over
flames for purification and fertility, and jump over a broom to
symbolize household unity.
   Traditional gifts include bread (for plenty), silver
(prosperity), salt (health) and wood or coal (physical and
emotional warmth).
   Before the priest pronounces them husband and wife, he invokes
the couple ``to pleasure one another,'' Arnold says. ``We don't cut
sex off from the rest of life. We don't make a big thing out of it
either.''
   At the heart of the primitive religion lies the power of the
male and female in nature, symbolized by the god usually referred
to by the Celtic name Herne, and the goddess known as Cerridwen or
Athena or Isis, Arnold said.
   Wiccans also believe in the mysteries of magic, reincarnation
and in celebrating the rites of passage, such as first menstruation
and menopause.
   ``We go through life after life to learn and evolve and progress
to the point where we rejoin the god and goddess,'' Arnold says.
``Behind them, there is something we can't even identify, the unity
they come from.''
   Witches don't go around laying curses on people, and they don't
conduct human or animal sacrifices, eat babies or worship the devil
as depicted in folklore and comics, he said.
   But the craft does have a practical side.
   ``I mix up potions and my wife makes some of the finest liqueurs
you've ever tasted,'' Arnold says. ``I use wormwood and calendula
(a rare herb) in vinegar to take bruises away and lavender vinegar
for sunburn.''
   Arnold says he discovered his religion 10 years ago after
intuitively constructing a Wiccan altar in his home. A woman he was
dating happened to be a witch and was startled to see the altar.
   Leader of the 50-member Temple of the Elder Faiths in Toronto,
Arnold was raised in New Jersey by a grandmother who read tea
leaves.
   ``We believe that if you are meant to find the craft, you
will,'' he says. ``Many traditional Wiccans think we're growing too
fast and this will water down the religion and may actually destroy
it.''
   He said covens usually meet on eight sabbaths coinciding with
the year's solar and lunar cycles. The average age in his group is
27 and members include a real estate agent, a schoolteacher and a
naturopath.
   ``Covens are closer than most families. Members tend to be more
imaginative than most people and a little bit eccentric,'' said
Arnold, a published poet and expert on ritual body decoration.
