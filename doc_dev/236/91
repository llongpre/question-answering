   Most wizards make magic with
wands, crystal balls or an old potion or two.
   Paulo Coelho doesn't buy that hokey stuff. He makes literary
magic with a Toshiba personal computer.
   Coelho, a new-wave sorcerer with a touch for turning yarns of
witchcraft and mysticism into best-selling books, has in one magic
leap become Brazil's No. 1 literary sensation. His three novels,
``Brida,'' ``Diary of a Wizard'' and ``The Alchemist,'' have been
Brazil's top best sellers for more than two months.
   The trio, soon to be translated into four languages, have sold
more than 1.3 million copies and grossed almost $1 million in two
years in a nation where half of the population of 150 million is
illiterate.
   ``This is a divine gift from the spirits beyond,'' crooned
Coelho, sitting barefoot on a black couch with leopard fur pillows
in his beachfront apartment, his legs crossed and arms extended in
the ``Lotus'' position to ``attract positive forces.''
   Maybe so, but Coelho has cleverly tapped into Brazilians'
traditional love of African voodoo-style cults, generally lumped
together under the term Macumba and descended from Yoruba and Bantu
religions practiced by slaves.
   Some 90 million Brazilians of all races and classes for years
have freely mixed elements of the predominant Roman Catholicism
with native Indian faiths, European witchcraft and spiritism to
form the uniquely Brazilian cults.
   Last year, nationwide sales of occult books grew twice as fast
as all others, with Coelho leading the blitz.
   ``Magic is inside all of us,'' the author says. ``We can all use
it to find happiness. I merely bring this idea to the people's
eyes.''
   The message has struck a deep chord in a public mired in
four-digit inflation, deteriorating social services and rising
unemployment.
   Coelho's latest novel, ``Brida,'' a steamy tale of a young Irish
woman named Brida O'Fern who is initiated as a witch in Spain's
Pyrenees Mountains, was panned outright by major magazines as an
``esoteric, poorly written jumble of metaphysical tales, drowned in
diffuse mysticism.''
   But Brazilians love it. The 100,000 first edition copies sold
out in weeks as the book roared to top of best-seller lists. A
second edition is due out to meet soaring demand.
   Even President Fernando Collor de Mello and Economy Minister
Zelia Cardoso de Mello are avid fans, having read all three books.
They've even called Coelho on several occasions.
   ``The more society becomes materialistic, the more people search
for spiritual fulfillment,'' said Nelson Motta, a Rio cultural
editor. ``Coelho's books are about just that - the search for the
soul.''
   Coelho, born in Rio on Aug. 24, 1947, appears to be a man torn
between modern-day logic and ancient superstition.
   After earning a law degree at Rio's Candido Mendes College, he
became a Buddist, Hare-Krishna, Child of God and Shintoist and
indulged in just about every hallucinogenic drug known.
   Coelho tried to be a playwright, journalist and musician. ``But
nothing clicked,'' he said, until he experimented with black magic,
and demons called on him in his Copacabana apartment one night in
1974.
   ``It was two days of horror,' said Coelho, his eyes brimming
with tears. ``But my destiny was forever marked.''
   In 1981, he said he ``felt a craving for the forces'' sold all
his belongings and toured Western Europe, Morocco and Transylvania,
Romania, by car with $17,000 in cash in his pockets.
   During a visit to the Dachau Nazi concentration camp in Munich,
Germany, Coelho says a spirit appeared before him and persuaded him
to become a full-fledged wizard.
   During the five-year initiation, Coelho roamed the far corners
of the Earth - from the pyramids of Egypt, the Sahara Desert and
the Atacema Desert in Chile, to Elvis Presley's Graceland mansion
in Memphis, Tenn.
   In 1986, he completed his oath, walking six hours a day for 70
days from the Pyrenees Mountains along the ``sacred path'' of
Spain's northern coast to the city of Santiago de Compostela.
Coelho says the Regnum Agnus Mundi order is an honorary, sacred
society of wizards founded in 1492 by a group of magicians in a
tiny village in northern Spain.
   He drew on his travels to write the ``The Alchemist'' and
``Diary of a Wizard,'' both of which are now in their 39th
editions.
   Today, Coelho hardly cuts the image of a wizard. He sports
running shoes, bleached jeans, T-shirt and leather jacket, silver
bracelet and a butterfly tattoo on his left forearm.
   The only drug he takes now is aspirin. His salt-and-pepper hair
and Fu Man Chu beard are kept meticulously trimmed.
   Coelho's home office smacks of corporate taste: architect lamps,
chordless telephone, computer, file cabinets, FAX and answering
machine with a message giving callers a spiritual blessing.
   Only the framed wizard diploma from the Spanish order Regnum
Agnus Mundi, his 18th-century steel sword and wooden serpent
scepter hint the presence of a sorcerer.
   His manner direct and disarming, Coelho has mastered media
promotion. One TV talk show host recently asked what powers he
possessed, and Coelho responded wryly: ``I can control the wind.
Just let me know what direction and I'll pucker up and blow.''
   But Coelho doesn't take the spirits lightly. Three times a day
he locks himself in a room, sitting crosslegged and wearing his
black cape, to meditate.
   Despite the deluge of fan mail and phone calls from bankers,
stock brokers and corporate executives asking for spiritual advice,
Coelho refuses to give private sessions, read cards or palms or
tell fortunes.
   ``If I opened a magic school or started my own religion, I'd be
rich,'' he said. ``But the spirits would strike me down if I did.''
