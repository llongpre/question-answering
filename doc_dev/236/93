   Barre Toelken will tell you a Navajo coyote
story in January, but no amount of prodding will get it out of him
in June.
   ``They have to be told in the winter or you will screw up the
weather pattern,'' he says.
   The traditional tribal moratorium on coyote yarns begins with
the first lightning strike in the spring. Then mum's the word until
the first killing frost of autumn.
   Toelken, 55, has spent years collecting and studying the
folklore of the Southwest _ tales, folk songs and ballads that echo
ever fainter down the decades. To many modern minds, his obsession
is, well, puzzling.
   ``There is still a notion that folklore is baloney. I don't know
any other field that has to explain itself any more than we do,''
Toelken says. ``If someone says they are a doctor or a plumber,
people say that's fine. But when I say I'm a folklorist, people
say, `That must be wonderful for your children, but what do you do
for a living?'''
   Toelken ``does'' folklore as a professor at Utah State
University. Although his doctoral degree is in medieval literature,
he became enthralled with American Indian culture in 1954 when he
and a group of friends left college to mine uranium on the Navajo
reservation in southeastern Utah.
   ``We started out driving down there on weekends and got more
interested in living among the Indians than going to school,'' he
says.
   After uranium mining played out, Toelken was invited to stay on
the reservation at Montezuma Creek with a Navajo family by the name
of Yellowman. It was during that first winter that he learned about
coyote stories, which are not all humorous but always carry a moral.
   ``Instead of lecturing people, the Navajos tell stories about a
coyote,'' he says.
   At first, he was simply entertained by the tales. But as his
studies in folklore progressed, he returned to the reservation and
made several tapes of the stories after agreeing never to repeat
them during the summer.
   Storytelling is an integral part of the study of folklore. For
Toelken and others, it reveals elements of society not recorded
anywhere else.
   ``Folklore is about the live part of the culture rather than the
dry part you get through the books,'' he says. ``The values and
ideas important to a group of people are often too abstract to talk
about, and when they are told in stories they are more vivid in
their explanation.''
   Toelken says Navajos aren't the only people who use stories to
explain themselves. Mormons, for example, tell stories about three
Nephite men from the Book of Mormon who have been allowed to roam
the Earth for ages, never dying.
   In the stories, he says, the three sometimes perform heroic acts
such as saving a child's life when no other adult is around. In
some versions, they appear as people in need. When the faithful
help them, they are blessed.
   Folklorists, Toelken says, are not in the business to determine
the truth of the stories they study, but focus on the purpose they
serve for the people who tell them.
   ``Studying the unwritten vernacular of a society reveals
important and mostly unrecorded facts about it,'' he says.
   While the Nephite tales may promote faith among Mormons, coyote
tales are sometimes used to explain nature. One tells that the
animal's eyes are yellow because a coyote once threw his eyes high
in the air so he could see long distances.
   ``Of course, it didn't do any good,'' Toelken says. ``And then
he had to use (yellow) pine pitch to make them stick again.''
   The stories often carry a health message. ``From the Navajo
point of view, the religion is based on health and anything out of
balance creates sickness,'' he says.
   But collecting coyote stories is not without hazard. Last fall
Toelken was asked to be a patient in a ``blessingway'' ceremony on
the reservation aimed at promoting harmony in a person's life and
warding off ``skinwalkers,'' or witches.
   ``Witches take language apart and analyze it. My scholarship of
Navajo coyote stories was making people nervous,'' he said.
   After Yellowman died while being treated for Navajo witchcraft,
Toelken agreed to participate in four such ceremonies to ease the
minds of other family members. He will go through another later
this year.
   For Toelken, a big part of his study of folklore is the Fife
Folklore Conference each June at Utah State. This year the
conference focused on storytelling, but again served to boost the
legitimacy of the odd discipline.
