Henson Film Applauded: The late Muppet creator Jim Henson's movie "The 
Witches," about a dastardly scheme to turn children into mice, won him 
posthumous plaudits Thursday from London critics.

The movie stars Anjelica Huston as the head witch. "It leaves us a testament to 
the glory that was Jim Henson," Nigel Andrews wrote in the Financial Times. 
Annabel Llywelyn-Cowper, who described herself as high priestess of two English 
covens, wrote in the Independent that the film's effects were admirable but 
that it perpetuated the "tired old theme (of) the witch as loathsome creature 
hellbent on destroying young lives." It opens in the United States in the fall.
