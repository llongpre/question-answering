   A liberal activist group is urging
Republicans to repudiate a comic book being touted by conservative
evangelist Jerry Falwell that portrays Michael Dukakis as a
supporter of witchcraft and bestiality.
   Falwell is urging his followers to paper the political landscape
with copies of the 30-page book, titled ``Magical Mike: The Real
Story of Mike Dukakis.'' Among other things, it depicts the
Democratic presidential nominee in a dress, wig and pearls.
   ``The last thing the Bush campaign, the Republican Party and the
presidential campaign need is the distribution of 10 million copies
of a comic book that's chock full of enough intolerance to offend
just about everyone except Jerry Falwell,'' John Buchanan, chairman
of People for the American Way, said Friday.
   In Washington, Dick Hafer of Lanham, Md., the book's producer,
said in an interview Friday night that the material is all
documented and the drawings are stylized to make a point.
   ``I think it's fair,'' said Hafer, who calls himself the
``Comics Commando'' on the booklet. ``I think it certainly has a
point of view ... I'd say it's accurate, that's the most important
thing,'' he added.
   Hafer said he has done other comic books on political topics,
including one called ``Every Family Has One'' during Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy's 1982 re-election race, depicting the Massachusetts
Democrat as a black sheep.
   In the Dukakis comic, the Massachusetts governor is called
``Sheriff Pansy'' for his crime-fighting record, especially the
state's prison furlough program.
   The book suggests that Dukakis would ruin the nation's defense
system and describes him as an enemy of babies for his stand in
favor of women being allowed to have abortions. In one drawing,
Dukakis is dressed in doctor's garb holding the hose of a vacuum.
   Elsewhere, a supporter is shown holding a sign that says: ``The
best baby is a dead baby.''
   Falwell, founder of the conservative Moral Majority, displayed
the book Thursday night at a rally in advance of the Monday start
of the Republican National Convention.
   Samples of the booklet had been passed out before Falwell spoke
and he subsequently explained how he had been impressed with the
artist who drew the comic book and purchased several thousand
copies to bring with him to New Orleans.
   He urged the audience to buy some on their way out of the
meeting and distribute them to everyone they knew.
   ``I want to shoot the guy's legs out from under him,'' Falwell
said of Dukakis. ``I want to expose him. This man is to the left of
Walter Mondale, George McGovern and, maybe, to the left of (Soviet
leader Mikhail) Gorbachev.''
   Asked whether he agreed with Falwell's aim, Hafer said, ``I
would like to see people have a chance to get all this information
in one spot. I think people who have the facts can make a good
decision.''
   One page in the comic book lists what it describes as bills
Dukakis filed in 1970 as a state representative, including measures
repealing a law punishing blasphemy, the law against fornication
and ``the law prohibiting the crime against nature (either with
mankind or with beast).''
   The book says Dukakis appointed a ``priestess of witchcraft as
the official witch of Salem'' over the objections of the Salem City
Council and questions whether the Greek Orthodox church is aware of
this.
   The book also suggests that Dukakis panders to special interest.
At one point it shows him dressed as a woman with a wig, dress and
strand of pearls. At another, it has him riding the shoulders of
Jesse Jackson.
