   United Methodist military and other
chaplains may not carry or use weapons, even for self-defense, says
the denomination's division of chaplains.
   Clarifying a long-standing policy prohibiting chaplains from
carrying weapons, the United Methodist Chaplains' Divison notified
its 666 military and 707 non-military chaplains:
   ``Weapons will neither be worn, carried or used in the conduct of
one's ministerial responsibilities, either officially or
unofficially. The violation of this policy is cause for immediate
loss of endorsement.
   ``To carry or take up firearms in order to protect one's own life
or the lives of one's companions is incompatible with the role of
chaplains. As representatives of ... Christ, we are not free to
injure or take another's life in order to protect our own life or
the life of an associate.''

   A survey finds that of 4,500 recipients of
assistance from Roman Catholic agencies in Ohio, nearly two-thirds
of them had only enough food on hand for one meal or less.
   Jim Tobin, associate director of social concerns for the Ohio
Catholic conference, says the survey shows basic needs of the poor _
food, clothing and shelter _ are not always being met.
   Citing a four-year decline in food stamp recipients, from 89
percent of clients to 59 percent, he says, ``our agencies and
programs are simply not able to pick up where the government
programs have cut back.''

   In one of the few Episcopal Church
dioceses that have not yet permitted ordination of women, Long
Island's Bishop Robert C. Witcher say he is clearing the way for it
despite his own objections.
   Convinced that the diocese favors it, he says he is turning over
several responsibilities, including the ordination process, to
Coadjutor Bishop Orris G. Walker Jr., who says he favors ordaining
women.
   The diocese now has three women deacons eligible for ordination
to the priesthood and Walker says it is likely they will be ordained
early next year.
   Walker automatically is to succeed Witcher, who plans to resign
two years hence.

   Metropolitan Philip, head of the
Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America, says
relations among various Eastern Orthodox branches on this continent
are ``at their lowest ebb.''
   In an interview in his denomination's periodical, The Word, he
said the conference of bishops of 14 Eastern Orthodox branches in
America is ``almost dead.''
   He said Archibhsop Iakovos, head of Greek Orthodoxy in the
Americas, had directed its bishops not to take part in liturgies
with Antiochian Evangelical Orthodox clergy.
   Philip said ``such acts do not contribute to a healthy Orthodox
climate of peace, cooperation and unity.''
