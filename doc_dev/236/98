A Long Beach man who has done investigative research to debunk faith healers 
and satanist cult scares has been named new editor of the Humanist, the nearly 
50-year-old magazine of the American Humanist Assn. 
</P>
<P>
David Alexander, 46, will succeed Lloyd Morain, 73, starting with the 
bimonthly's September-October issue. 
</P>
<P>
Published in Amherst, N.Y., the magazine's circulation is between 25,000 and 
30,000 -- at least four times the membership of the association. 
</P>
<P>
"The membership (of the American Humanist Assn.) is disproportionate to the 
effect that humanist ideas have in society," Alexander said. Author Isaac 
Asimov is president of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, who has worked as a magician, photographer and private investigator, 
wrote the lead article in the March/April issue of the Humanist. The article 
criticized the growing number of occult crime experts and anti-satanist 
"hysteria," drawing heavily on a debunking study done by the Committee for the 
Scientific Examination of Religion, chaired by Gerald Larue, a USC professor 
emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been associated with James (The Amazing) Randi for years," Alexander 
said, "and I was one of his chief investigators for his book on faith healers." 
Randi, a frequent guest on Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show," was given the 1990 
Distinguished Service Award at the organization's annual convention in Orlando 
last weekend. Broadcast executive-entrepreneur Ted Turner was given the 
Humanist of the Year Award. 
</P>
<P>
Although the organization is incorporated as an educational body -- not a 
religious body -- the magazine and the organization often delve into religious 
and ethical issues, but from a non-theistic, skeptical point of view. 
</P>
<P>
The Humanist magazine will be 50 next January. "It goes to virtually every 
major library," Alexander said.

Rabbi Harold Schulweis, a Conservative rabbi who leads Valley Beth Shalom in 
Encino, put a large crack in what he called the "Jewish Berlin Wall" when he 
spoke to an Orthodox group at Beth Jacob Congregation in Beverly Hills on a 
recent Sabbath. Orthodox and Conservative synagogues have been traditionally 
off-limits to rabbis of each other's tradition, especially as religious and 
political issues have divided the strict Jewish law observing Orthodox and the 
more modernizing Jewish branches. It was not surprising last September when 
Rabbi Daniel Landes of Beth Jacob was warmly received at Schulweis' synagogue 
-- the first half of their bold exchange. But Schulweis' appearance before the 
Upstairs Minyan of Beth Jacob last month was preceded by heavy criticism from 
other Orthodox rabbis. But Leo Noonan of the Jewish Journal reported that the 
overflow crowd "broke into loud applause for the Conservative rabbi" amid cries 
of a job well done. Schulweis, praising the "courage and warmth" of Rabbi 
Landes, said in his talk that if Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews don't end their 
mutual hostility that violence and permanent polarization are likely. Schulweis 
suggested more such pulpit exchanges.

Father Alfred LoPinto, 45, now ending a five-year term in Washington as 
executive director of the U.S. Catholic Bishops' social justice-funding 
Campaign for Human Development, was named this week as new executive director 
of Catholic Charities in the San Bernardino Diocese. Bishop Phillip F. Straling 
also appointed LoPinto, who will start his duties Sept. 1, as rector of Our 
Lady of the Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino.

Fearing that Christian churches in general are perceived by the public as being 
anti-abortion, a 350-member United Methodist Church in Monterey Park has 
scheduled a convocation for 2 p.m. Sunday to affirm the denomination's stance 
"to safeguard the legal option of abortion." The Rev. Barbara Kilgore, pastor 
of the host Sage Memorial United Methodist Church, said the forum will also 
deal with family planning and world population problems.

The 25th renewal of Mary's Hour, a revived devotional event sponsored by the 
Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese, will be held in East Los Angeles for the 
first time on Sunday. Archbishop Roger M. Mahony will preside and give the 
homily at East Los Angeles College Stadium. The program is expected to run from 
3 to 5 p.m.

"Are You Running With Me, Jesus?" was a religious best-selling collection of 
poetic prayers two decades ago. This Sunday at St. Augustine-by-the-Sea 
Episcopal Church in Santa Monica, its author, Father Malcolm Boyd, will be 
joined by eight other Episcopal priests for readings, starting at 5 p.m., from 
the revised and expanded edition of the book. JOHN DART
