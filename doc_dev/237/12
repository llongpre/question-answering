   The nation's only public diamond mine
_ which yields about 1,400 gems a year to tourists _ will be opened
to test drilling by four private mining companies in a plan
criticized by environmentalists.
   The exploratory drilling at Crater of Diamonds State Park could
lead to commercial mining at the park, which presently allows
anyone with the $3-a-day price of admission to seek his fortune in
the soft blue-gray soil.
   The state Parks, Recreation and Travel Commission voted 12-0 in
favor of the plan Thursday. If commercially viable deposits are
found, the state could award mining rights to one of the four
companies cooperating in the test drilling.
   The Sierra Club and the Friends of the Crater of Diamonds oppose
the plan, and have threatened legal action to block the exploratory
work. They say businesses don't belong in state parks, and warn the
drilling could open the way to logging or gravel mining in the area.
   The decision to allow exploratory drilling came more than 2{
years after Gov. Bill Clinton's appointed a Diamond Mining Advisory
Task Force to study the prospect of commercial mining at the park
   An advisory team will meet by mid-January, said John Morgan, a
consulting engineer who advised the state. Drilling could begin as
early as April.
   The state got control of the 888-acre park in southwestern
Arkansas in 1972, after a private mining company went bankrupt.
Visitors are allowed to prospect in a 35-acre plowed field, and
it's said people have taken away diamonds as large as 40 carats.
   About 78,000 people try their luck at Crater of Diamonds each
year.
   An independent contractor selected under state bidding
procedures will conduct the tests, working for the state and the
four mining companies.
   The four companies are Kennecott Inc. of Salt Lake City;
Capricorn Diamonds of West Perth, Australia; Continental Diamonds,
which is controlled by a Canadian gold company called Galactic
Resources Ltd., and Arkansas Diamond Development Co., owned by
Texas and Arkansas business people.
