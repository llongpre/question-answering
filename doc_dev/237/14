FT  23 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Funds sought for diamond
projects

Ashton Mining of Australia has two exciting diamond projects that, if all
goes well, might be mined in 1997, according to Mr John Robinson, the chief
executive.
The race is between Ashton's Merlin prospect in the Batten area of
Australia's Northern Territory, where the company has been exploring for 15
years, and its new diamond province in Finland.
Ashton has been exploring in Finland for eight years but kept its operations
there secret until September this year because Finnish laws do not provide
for large and long-life exploration licences. The company is still not
revealing the precise locations of some of the prospective areas in Finland
where it has found 'commercially significant concentrations' of diamonds.
Mr Robinson, speaking to analysts in London this week, said that Ashton was
looking at options for substantial further funding if the projects lived up
to their present promise. The least attractive option would be to bring in a
partner for joint ventures. He preferred the idea of floating projects so as
to bring in public money.
Ashton is Australia's biggest diamond mining company via its 40 per cent
holding in the Argyle mine in Western Australia, the world's largest
producer in volume terms. Argyle's present reserves guarantee its open pit
operations through to 2004 but Mr Robinson said there was a good chance that
moving to underground mining could extend the mine's life considerably.
He was 'very optimistic' about diamond market prospects for the next 10
years. Demand would grow strongly as new markets, such as China, India and
Mexico, developed from a small base. On the supply side, apart from Ashton's
two projects, only the discovery by another Australian group, Broken Hill
Proprietary, in Canada's North West Territories, seemed to offer much
promise. He admitted, however, that there were unanswered questions about
the size of Russia's diamond stockpiles and what it might do with those
gems.
