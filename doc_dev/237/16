   Here are answers to commonly asked questions about
diamonds.
   What are diamonds?
   Diamonds are crystallized carbon which has been subjected to
prolonged, steady heat and pressure. They were formed up to 120
miles under the earth's crust billions of years ago.
   Where are diamonds usually found?
   Diamonds were brought to the earth's surface by volcankc
eruptions, so they are found in volcanic rocks known as kimberlite
and lamproite, as well as scattered in river beds, swamps and on
beaches.
   Diamonds are mined in about 20 countries. Australia is the
biggest producer in terms of volume, or 35 million carats in 1988.
In terms of value however, Soviet Union, is considered No. 1,
although the value of its production is a secret.
   How are diamonds mined?
   Diamonds are obtained largely through underground mining or via
a dredging process. Diamond-embedded rocks are squeezed to allow
the diamonds to roll free. Slurry is put in water and the heavier
diamonds sink to the bottom.
   When were diamonds discovered?
   About 2,500 years ago, in India. They were thought to have
special protective powers, worn in arm amulets and placed in sword
hilts.
   Can diamonds be manufactured?
   Yes. General Electric Co. developed a method of synthesizing
diamonds in the 1950s, but experts say natural ones are best.
   How are diamonds graded?
   By carat weight, clarity, color, and cut. A carat is 200
milligrams. There more than 5,000 categories of diamonds, and the
colorless, clear diamonds are the most valued, although blues and
pinks are highly prized.
   In what shapes are diamonds cut?
   The most popular cut is brilliant, a round-shape with 57 facets.
Other classic cuts are pear, oval, marquise, and emerald. New cuts
such as the heart shape have been introduced in recent years.
   How much do diamonds cost?
   Prices vary considerably, but the wholesale price of the highest
grade one-carat gem is about $16,000.
   Does diamond jewelry appreciate in value?
   Sometimes, over a long period of time. But people don't tend to
buy diamonds as a financial investment.
   What is the world's largest diamond?
   The Star of Africa, a 74-facet, 530.2-carat pear gem placed in
Britain's Royal Sceptre. It was found in a mine in Pretoria, South
Africa, cut in 1908 and presented to King Edward VII.
   Why do women wear diamond engagement rings?
   The diamond became a symbol of conjugal fidelity because of its
resistance and endurance. It was introduced into European wedding
ritual in the 15th century.
   Who sang ``Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend?''
   Marilyn Monroe, in the title song of the 1949 movie ``Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes.''
