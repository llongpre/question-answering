FT  29 AUG 94 / De Beers sucks jewels off seabed

Seventeen nautical miles off the coast of Namibia, armed with techniques
that would not be out of place in a science fiction novel, De Beers is
vacuuming diamonds from the seabed 125 metres below.
The South African group, which dominates the world's diamond business, is
pushing mining technology to the limit, to explore for and recover tens of
thousands of very small precious stones scattered across hundreds of square
kilometres of seabed.
The Debmar Atlantic, a converted oil exploration vessel, has been turned
into a floating diamond mine. It sucks up tonnes of material a minute from
which the diamonds are sorted. Then, for security reasons, the diamonds are
canned on an automated production line, with technology most commonly used
for peaches and pineapple chunks.
Each can is filled with a mixture containing up to 1,900 diamonds.
De Beers Marine, a wholly owned subsidiary of the group, is the only company
operating at these depths. The stones in these Namibian waters are 60m years
old and may have travelled 1,500km, washed down the Orange River by
thunderous downpours in the Transvaal.
To locate the diamonds, De Beers meticulously sampled an area as large as
Holland.
Only the most durable diamonds survived the trip, according to Mr Graham
Rees, DBM's general manager. Nearly every one recovered is of gem quality,
which is what makes the considerable expense of fishing them out of the sea
worthwhile.
DBM has spent about Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) to buy and convert its seven
vessels. More than Dollars 50m has been spent exploring since 1991.
The Debmar Atlantic uses a huge drill to get at the stones. A short
helicopter hop away its sister vessel, the Louis G Murray, is using an
under-sea robot crawler, as big as a truck, with hydraulic drills operated
electronically from the ship.
Last year DBM sucked up 302,754 carats of diamonds from the sea bed, 16 per
cent more than in 1992. This year the seabed is likely to yield even more
carats, according to Mr Rees.
It is impossible to say how much the seabed diamonds are worth but DBM's
production last year was about a third of Namibia's diamond output in carats
and more than that in value.
