   De Beers tightened its grip on the global diamond
market Wednesday with an exclusive five-year deal to sell the
Soviet Union's rough diamond output, which could total more than $5
billion.
   The financially strained Soviet Union, among the world's biggest
gem diamond producers, will get a $1 billion advance against future
diamond sales.
   De Beers' London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling
Organization, will strengthen its position as the world's dominant
diamond seller. It already markets 80 percent of global rough
diamond production of some 100 million carats.
   The Soviets do not disclose their output.
   The nation reached the deal because it wanted to sell a huge
stockpile of diamonds without disrupting the stable world diamond
market, De Beers said.
   The Soviet Union had refused to deal directly with the South
African-based company because of its home country's policies of
racial separation, but now is willing to do business openly with De
Beers' new Swiss arm, De Beers Centenary AG.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. established the publicly-held
Swiss company in May to head the non-South African businesses of De
Beers, which is controlled by the wealthy Oppenheimer family of
South Africa.
   De Beers Centenary said in a statement released in Lucerne,
Switzerland and made available in London that it reached the
agreement with Glavalmazzoloto of the Soviet Union for the
exclusive export and sale of the USSR diamond production.
   Glavalmazzoloto is the main administration for precious metals
and diamonds under the Soviet Union's council of ministers, De
Beers said.
   De Beers' Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Centenary Holdings SA,
has agreed to advance Glavalmazzoloto $1 billion against future
diamond deliveries. Repayment would be made over five years
beginning in November.
   The Soviet diamond stockpile will be held at De Beers'
London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, as
collateral for the advance, De Beers said.
   The organization, a 57-year-old cartel, has the financial
resources to hold large stocks of diamonds, which is how it keeps
the market stable.
   Although De Beers said it had had no direct contact with the
Soviet Union since 1963, diamond experts say De Beers already sells
most of the Soviet Union's West-bound diamonds.
   ``We have not had an official agreement with the Russians. In
the past, obviously, being major distributors of rough (diamonds),
Russian diamonds have found their way into the rough,'' said De
Beers spokesman Roger Van Eeghen. ``It came through other sources,
other channels.''
   All the world's major diamond producers, including Botswana,
Australia, Tanzania, Zaire and Namibia, have sales contracts with
De Beers Centenary. The Central Selling Organization had sales of
$4.09 billion last year.
   De Beers must renegotiate several key contracts this year, which
experts have said might loosen its grip on the diamond market.
   The formal marketing of the Soviet diamonds, like those from
elsewhere, will take place in London and Lucerne, De Beers said.
   Julian Ogilvie Thompson, De Beers chairman, said the deal would
bring ``continued stability and prosperity of the international
diamond industry.''
   Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of De Beers Centenary,
said the Soviet Union, at a time of ``considerable financial
strain,'' was able to raise a $1 billion loan while signing a
contract assuring it of ``a steady flow of funds from diamonds''
over the next five years.
   Large-scale diamond mining began in the Soviet Union in the
1950s and is concentrated in the Yakutia region of North Eastern
Siberia, De Beers said.
