diamond find in Finland

The mining industry has been startled by an out-of-the-blue revelation that
Ashton Mining of Australia, has discovered a diamond province in Finland. It
also said that 'the prospect for a commercial discovery is considered to be
high.'
While other companies have been scouring Canada's Northwest Territories,
African, Australia and even deep down in the depths of the sea for the gem
stones, Ashton secretly has been prospecting in Finland, a country
best-known for base metals production, for eight years.
Mr John Robinson, chief executive of Ashton, which is one-third owned by the
state-controlled Malaysian Mining Corporation, said his company had found
two fields of kimberlite pipes and a number of isolated kimberlite
occurences - 21 kimberlites in all - and most of them were diamond-bearing.
One pipe of about two hectares in surface area had yielded 26 carats of
diamonds of more than 8mm in size per 100 tonnes from a 23-tonne sample,
with a weighted average of 17 carats per 100 tonnes.
'The results to date confirm that the basic geology in Finland is
prospective for the discovery of an economic diamond deposit and that
Ashton's exploration techniques are effective in glacial terrain,' said Mr
Andrew Button, Ashton's group general manager of exploration and
development.
'New targets in Finland are being generated and testing is continuing in
this exciting location. The exploration areas are close to established
infrastructure and the prospect for a commercial discovery is considered to
be high,' he added.
Independent experts agreed. 'This compares favourably with most of the
discoveries in the Northwest Territories, said Mr Roger Ellis, editor of the
Mining Journal.
Ashton is a 40 per cent joint venturer in the Argyle mine in Western
Australia which is the biggest diamond producer in the world in carat (but
not value) terms.
It is not alone in looking for diamonds in Finland. The annual meeting of
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, was enlivened this year by the
presence of two members of the Finnish Sami population (the Laplanders) who
complained that the UK-based group was seeking permission to excavate in
parts of Finland where they had reindeer grazing rights.
Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, said this week the group had, indeed,
staked large tracts of land in Finland, mainly because of its potential to
yield diamonds.
Meanwhile, Ashton has accelerated the pace of its activities in Finland and
is building a broader presence in the Nordic/Baltic region, including
Norway, Sweden and Karelia.
