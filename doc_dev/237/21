FT  13 AUG 94 / Investors count cost of diamond rush: Few winners after
Canadian prospecting frenzy

A shock has hit hundreds of investors on the Toronto and Vancouver stock
exchanges in the past week. In just two days, more than half a billion
dollars was wiped from the value of exploration companies which have been
involved for three years in a diamond rush over an area almost as big as the
UK in Canada's Northwest Territories.
The sell-off was triggered by an announcement from Kennecott, the US
subsidiary of the UK mining group RTZ, that samples from one much-touted
kimberlite pipe do not contain enough precious stones to justify further
exploration.
The international mining community was caught off guard. Kennecott had
carried out its tests in utmost secrecy at a gold mine near Yellowknife, the
Northwest Territories' rough, boisterous mining centre. It refused even to
share progress reports with its partners in the project. 'We were absolutely
dumbstruck,' says Mr John Hainey, mining analyst at Canaccord Capital, a
Toronto securities firm.
Kennecott's shell-shocked junior partners watched their share prices dive by
as much as 85 per cent. Three of them - Dentonia Resources, Horseshoe Gold
Mining and Kettle River Resources - were worth a combined CDollars 178m
(Pounds 83m) the day before Kennecott dropped its bombshell. Two days later,
their market value had shrivelled to just CDollars 30m. The three companies
have called off a planned merger.
The Great Canadian Diamond Rush thus passes into history as another sobering
reminder of how the merest whiff of riches under the ground can sweep
entrepreneurs, hard-nosed analysts and gullible investors off their feet.
Any geologist will confirm that the chances of finding enough diamonds to
justify more than one mine in a single area are never high. Diamonds are
found in the greyish rock known as kimberlite. But only about one out of
every 200 kimberlite pipes contain diamonds, and no more than one in 20 of
those has enough big stones to justify a mine.
Such long odds did not discourage exploration companies from flocking to the
Northwest Territories, nor analysts from recommending their shares, in the
ambiguous phrase of one recent report, as a 'strong speculative buy'.
Mr Hainey invokes a gambling metaphor. 'The prize is so high,' he says.
'People are prepared to put their money into the lottery.' As with a
lottery, one big winner will probably yet emerge from the Northwest
Territories. A consortium of Australia's BHP Minerals and its Canadian
partner, Dia-Met Minerals, is expected to start construction early next year
on a mine near Lac de Gras, about 300km north-east of Yellowknife. On
present indications, the mine will be one of the world's premier diamond
producers.
The story of BHP and Dia-Met's achievement is perhaps even more impressive
than Kennecott's disaster.
The Northwest Territories presents unusual challenges for men and machines.
The vast expanse of treeless tundra is covered by snow and ice for more than
half the year, with temperatures dropping so low in mid-winter that trucks
and machinery must be kept running around the clock to prevent their engines
freezing. A shovel's metal blade becomes so brittle that it is liable to
snap when weight is put on it.
Diamond fever in the Frozen North goes back to the early 1980s. Mr Hugo
Dummett, a geologist working for Superior Oil, was tipped off by a bush
pilot that De Beers, which controls the world diamond market, was
prospecting near the Mackenzie River.
Under cover of darkness, Mr Dummett and Mr Charles Fipke, a Canadian
geologist and Dia-Met's founder, landed a helicopter close to the De Beers
lakeside camp and picked up eight or nine samples of their own.
Superior Oil got out of mining exploration after it was bought by Mobil, the
US energy group. But Mr Fipke continued the search, slowly moving eastward
towards the source of the vast ice sheet which scraped up - and then
deposited - metal-bearing rocks across northern Canada millions of years
ago.
The long search almost broke Dia-Met. Mr Fipke recalled in an interview last
year that several big mining companies which he approached for funds 'turned
us down flat'.
Several fellow-directors at Dia-Met walked out. By 1987, only Mr Fipke's son
and a pilot were left to help him sample the kimberlite outcrops.
In the meantime however, Mr Dummett moved to BHP. He persuaded his new
Australian bosses to form a joint venture with Dia-Met in 1990.
The breakthrough came a year later, about 600km east of the Mackenzie River.
Samples from a kimberlite pipe beneath Point Lake yielded 101 carats of
diamonds, equal to about 70 carats per 100 tonnes, which is well above the
grade normally required to justify a mine.
Dia-Met's success set off the prospecting frenzy. Claims covering 53m acres
(81,700 square miles) have been staked in the Lac de Gras area over the past
three years.
Mr Gordon Stewart, whose Yellowknife-based company ferries supplies to
remote mining camps, estimates that business has 'very easily doubled'. His
company has arranged over 2,000 supply flights over the past 12 months.
Subsequent work by BHP and Dia-Met around Lac de Gras unearthed even richer
deposits than Point Lake. The two companies have advanced to a full
feasibility study which should be completed around the end of the year. If
all goes to plan, the BHP-Dia-Met mine will be in production by 1997.
Anyone who shared Mr Fipke's early optimism has made a fortune. Dia-Met
shares, which were trading at around 70 cents in August 1991, soared to a
peak of over CDollars 60 earlier this year, when they were split
two-for-one.
As the company with the best chance of developing a mine, Dia-Met was
relatively unscathed by last week's crash. Its subordinate voting shares
currently change hands at about CDollars 17. From being close to bankruptcy,
Mr Fipke, who appears in Dia-Met's latest annual report wearing his
favourite weather-beaten brown jersey and blue jeans, is now worth CDollars
120m.
Hopes for a second Lac de Gras diamond mine had been pinned on the Kennecott
joint venture. But Kennecott, which came to the NWT relatively late, was
more impatient and less deliberate than BHP. 'They showed up with a blank
cheque book and signed up everybody close to the to Dia-Met claim block,'
recalls a geologist at one rival company.
Kennecott also cut corners in its bid to catch up to the Australians. While
BHP gradually increased the size of its samples, the US company went
straight from a small 2-tonne sample to a costly, underground programme
involving about 5,000 tonnes.
With Kennecott and its partners now licking their wounds, attention has
shifted back to De Beers. The South African group recently signed a
tentative agreement with two junior exploration companies, Tanqueray
Resources and Mill City Gold, which are confident that they have a promising
prospect at Yamba Lake, north-west of Lac de Gras.
De Beers has taken samples from Yamba Lake to its laboratories in South
Africa for further tests. It is due to decide in the next few weeks whether
to press ahead with the joint venture. The question however, is whether
investors who have suffered heavy losses are in any mood to put more money
into the Lac de Gras diamond play. Last week's setback could deprive many
small companies of the capital they need to continue their search.
Mr Stewart, whose Yellowknife supplies business has profited handsomely from
the boom, is among those who has lost heavily on his investments.
Despite the setback however, it probably would not take much to revive the
irrepressible confidence (some would call it greedy recklessness) which is a
hallmark of mining exploration. Another speculative bubble could quickly
appear if De Beers or one of the other companies makes another encouraging
find.
News of the Kennecott debacle was only a few hours old when mining analysts
at Credit Lyonnais Laing in London were advising clients that 'any fall in
the share price of (De Beers' new partners) must be considered a strong
buying opportunity.' By the middle of this week, many of the junior
companies' shares were starting to creep back up again.
