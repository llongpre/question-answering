   Australia's Argyle diamond mine is expected to produce more than its target of 25 million carats this year, accounting for more than one-third of the world's diamond production, the Bureau of Mineral Resources said. 

   The bureau said the mine, which is 57%-owned by CRA Ltd., produced 21.4 million carats in 1986's first three quarters, in contrast to 7.1 million carats in all of 1985.
