</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruth Watters pulled a tiny, sparkling stone out of a paper bag and held it up 
in the intense sunlight, asking for a second opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just walking alone and I saw it on the ground," Watters, of St. 
Petersburg, Fla., said. "Does that look like a diamond to you?" 
</P>
<P>
Only here, at Crater of Diamonds State Park, would that question not sound 
foolish. The park, tucked into the lush pine forests of southwest Arkansas, is 
the only place in North America ever to produce gem-quality diamonds and the 
only diamond mine in the world that allows the public to find and keep the 
gems. 
</P>
<P>
For $3 (or $1.50 for children), visitors may dig and scratch at about 35 acres 
of gray volcanic soil and dream of finding a stone that will dwarf "Uncle Sam," 
the 40.23-carat record-holder found here in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
Already on this day, two lucky prospectors had found diamonds, bringing this 
year's count to 533. But the fun has been tempered by controversy lately, ever 
since the state decided it might sell the park's most productive sections to 
private mining concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, diamond-mining interests persuaded the Arkansas Department of 
Parks and Tourism to initiate testing to determine the size and shape of the 
diamond-bearing ore deposit. Four potential bidders put up $87,500 each to pay 
for the testing, and a Tennessee company under contract to the state began 
drilling on July 8 with an apparatus that resembles an oil-well drill rig. 
</P>
<P>
The test drilling prompted a federal lawsuit this year by conservationists who 
contend the tests are a prelude to full-scale commercial mining at the park. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be like shooting the last whooping crane or killing the last bald 
eagle," said Terry Horton, director of the environmentalist Arkansas Wildlife 
Federation, which is among the suit's plaintiffs. "It's so unique that the very 
idea of turning it into a commercial mining operation is vulgar." 
</P>
<P>
Since the state bought what had been a privately owned mine in 1972 for 
$750,000, about 14,000 diamonds have been plucked from it. The 889-acre park 
averages 700 visitors a day. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Gov. Bill Clinton appointed a task force to study the idea of 
commercializing the park. That led to the Department of Parks and Tourism's 
decision last year to give testing the go-ahead. The federal Department of the 
Interior, which granted the state $720,000 of the purchase price 18 years ago, 
initially opposed the drilling but changed its stance last July, although 
Clinton now says he is against commercialization. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several diamond-mining companies contended that commercial 
operation would be a boon to economically depressed Murfreesboro and its 1,900 
residents. A spokesman for Arkansas investors interested in a private mine said 
that such an operation would create 400 permanent jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal drawn up by the task force two years ago set aside for the mining 
company the entire 35-acre field that the state now plows regularly for public 
mining and envisioned a huge pit reaching hundreds of feet deep. The state 
would keep part of the park for public use, but Jim Cannon, the park 
superintendent, said the rest of the park's ore deposits are of a different 
type that is too hard to plow. Opponents say commercialization would leave the 
public to scour the park's least productive areas and destroy the 
diamond-hunting experience. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists' lawsuit contends that converting the public land to 
private use is illegal. The federal Land and Water Conservation Fund Act 
prohibits such conversion unless the lands taken away are replaced with other 
lands of like value and use. 
</P>
<P>
But the Interior Department allowed testing a year ago as a temporary 
non-conforming use. U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright thus far has 
allowed the first phase of testing to continue but has hinted that she might 
rule on a permanent injunction by Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, visitors continue to scan the surface and dig as usual, while the 
drill rig hums away.
