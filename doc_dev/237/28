   The Soviet Union will get more badly needed
foreign hard currency by selling its rough diamonds exclusively
through the South African giant De Beers in a five-year
multibillion-dollar agreement.
   The company is advancing the Soviets $1 billion against future
diamond sales, said officials who announced the agreement on
Wednesday.
   The Soviet Union, among the world's largest diamond producers,
reached the deal with De Beers because it wanted to sell a huge
stockpile of diamonds without disrupting the market, De Beers said.
   The Soviet Union had refused to deal directly with the South
African company because of apartheid, but now is willing to openly
do business with De Beers' new Swiss arm, De Beers Centenary AG.
   South Africa-based De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., controlled
by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa, established the
publicly-held Swiss company in May.
   De Beers Centenary said in a statement that it reached the
agreement with Glavalmazzoloto of the USSR for the exclusive export
and sale of the Soviet Union's diamond production.
   Glavalmazzoloto is the main administration for precious metals
and diamonds under the Soviet Union's council of ministers, De
Beers said.
   It said its Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Centenary Holdings SA,
has agreed to make a secured advance of $1 billion to
Glavalmazzoloto against future diamond deliveries.
   Repayment would be made over five years beginning in November,
it said.
   Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of De Beers Centenary,
said as a result of the agreement that the Soviet Union, at a time
of ``considerable financial strain,'' was assured ``a steady flow
of funds from diamonds'' during the life of the contract.
   Company officials estimated the contract could be worth as much
as $5 billion.
   Moscow has been seeking foreign credit as it tries to bring
market-oriented reform to an economy plagued by shortages.
   The Soviet diamond stockpile will be held at De Beers'
London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, as
collateral for the $1 billion advance, De Beers said.
   The organization, a 57-year-old cartel, has the financial
resources to hold large stocks of diamonds, which is how it keeps
the market stable.
   Although De Beers said it had had no direct contact with the
Soviet Union since 1963, diamond experts say De Beers already sells
most of the Soviet Union's West-bound diamonds.
   All the world's major diamond producers, including Botswana,
Australia, Tanzania, Zaire and Namibia, have sales contracts with
De Beers Centenary. The Central Selling Organization, as a result,
markets 80 percent of the world's rough diamond production of some
100 million carats.
   The organization had sales of $4.09 billion last year.
   Large-scale diamond mining began in the Soviet Union in the
1950s and is concentrated in the Yakutia region of North Eastern
Siberia, De Beers said. The Soviet Union doesn't disclose the value
of its output.
