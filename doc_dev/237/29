De Beers, the South African group that dominates the world diamond business,
yesterday secured its position in Namibia for the next 25 years - or until
the diamonds run out - by effectively handing over to the government there
50 per cent of its subsidiary, CDM.
The company will be reconstituted as Namdeb Diamond Corporation in which De
Beers and the Namibian government will each own 50 per cent. The government
will not be putting any capital into the new organisation.
Mr Sam Nujoma, Namibia's president, said yesterday that his country would,
via tax and dividends, collect additional revenue from the country's diamond
operations. For the present financial year Namibia has budgeted to collect
USDollars 56m in taxes and duties from these operations, based on depressed
1993 earnings.
Nevertheless, the signs are that De Beers is pleased with the deal,
completed after two years of tough negotiations and similar to its
arrangement with the Botswana government.
The accord signed in Windhoek gives De Beers:
The assurance that it will be able to continue to exploit its existing on
and off-shore assets in the country and that its renewable prospecting
licences will protected;
A guarantee that all of Namdeb's output will be marketed through De Beers'
London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls 80 per cent of
world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds;
Retained control of De Beers Marine, the company that provides the
technology and equipment for off-shore diamond mining. Debmarine, which last
year, in terms of carats, accounted for about one quarter of the diamonds
CDM produced, will have only a contractual relationship with Namdeb.
Also, CDM's part-interest in the Navachab gold mine, near Karibib, will be
retained by De Beers under the accord.
Revenues from diamonds account for 11 per cent of Namibia's gross domestic
product and 34 per cent of its export earnings.
Mr Nujoma said yesterday: 'No longer will Namibia's diamond industry lurk in
the darkness of suspicion and strike; we are now forging an equal
partnership subject to the disciplines of both public scrutiny and the
private market.'
CDM, which moves huge tonnages of beach sands to find most of its diamonds,
is by no means De Beers' largest producer. Its output, down from 1.5m carats
in 1992 to 1.1m last year, is overshadowed by Botswana's 14.7m carats, down
from nearly 16m.
