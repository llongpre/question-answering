THE AUSTRALIAN Securities Commission is investigating whether the
pronouncements of a 91-year old New York rabbi played a role in a share
buying spree that raised the market value of a small mining company from
ADollars 200m to ADollars 1bn in less than a month.
The commission also wants to know why a diamond strike described as
'significant' by Melbourne-based Great Central Mines is judged uneconomic by
its joint venture partner, Stockdale Prospecting, a subsidiary of De Beers,
the South African mining house.
Australian regulators became interested in Great Central when its share
price rose sharply in March, during a series of US 'roadshow' presentations
by Mr Joseph Gutnick, the chairman. The company's American Depositary
Receipts had just begun trading on the Nasdaq over-the-counter exchange.
The ADR price rose from USDollars 5 on March 10, when Mr Gutnick arrived in
the US, to about Dollars 14 on March 29. The price boom was paralleled in
Australia, where the shares soared from ADollars 4.45 to ADollars 18, mostly
on overseas buying.
Even by the speculative standards applied to exploration companies, the
valuation appeared generous. Great Central, which has no significant
operating income, made a net loss of ADollars 3.9m last year on turnover of
just ADollars 1.2m.
However, the identity of the buyers remains something of a mystery, as is
the reason behind the sudden surge in demand.
One colourful explanation that has surfaced in the US and Australia is that
the buyers were Lubavitcher Jews impressed by a video recording in which
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson says that gold is there for Mr Gutnick and
urges continued exploration.
Rabbi Schneerson is the Russian-born leader of the ultra-orthodox
Lubavitcher sect, based in the Crown Heights district of New York. The
movement has a worldwide following of about 200,000, and the Rabbi's words
 -disseminated by a large publishing organisation  - carry great weight
among Lubavitchers. Some regard him as a messiah.
But there are two serious flaws in the theory that the video recording
triggered the surge in demand for the shares:
The Rabbi's friendship with Mr Gutnick had been public knowledge among
Lubavitchers since at least 1987, and the video is several years old. It is
not clear why it should suddenly prompt a buying spree.
The video appears not to have been shown at Great Central's roadshows, and
the Rabbi's endorsement was not a major feature. Mr Herb Lanzet, the New
York-based public relations man who arranged the four-city tour, says he did
not see the 'rabbi video' until later, although a separate 'corporate video'
was produced for investors.
If the buyers were not zealous Lubavitchers, who were they? Efforts to
market the stock seem initially to have been confined to a select few. In
Denver, for example, none of the top brokerage houses were invited, nor were
the local gold-mining trade association or big institutional investors.
Mr Roger May, of a small broking house called Schneider Securities, did
receive a telephone call from Mr Lanzet, who was known to his firm, and a
visit from Mr Gutnick. But Mr May says that Great Central's two-man
presentation, made in Schneider's offices, was 'no real hype'.
Mr May bought ADRs for several accounts at USDollars 5.37 1/2 , which were
then sold at USDollars 12. 'Herb and Paul (Mr Lanzet's assistant) said it
was a good thing,' he says.
According to Mr Gutnick, the roadshows were designed to present Great
Central as a serious exploration company with significant prospects in both
gold and diamond mining.
No one disputes that Great Central has a knack for discovering gold mines.
Five years ago it found and then sold the Plutonic deposit in Western
Australia, which produces 200,000 ounces of gold a year. Now it is
evaluating another discovery at nearby Bronze Wing.
But there is controversy about Great Central's claim to have found a
promising diamond deposit on land at Nabberu, not far from Bronze Wing,
where it has a joint exploration arrangement with Stockdale.
Great Central told the Australian Stock Exchange last month that 'four fine
diamonds' had been discovered in what it had earlier described as a 'major
diamond bearing . . . province'.
A few days later, trading in the shares was temporarily suspended at the
company's request, pending the release by Stockdale of an evaluation report
requested by the exchange. When it came, the report said the joint venture
had found kimberlites (diamond bearing rock formations), but 'none . . .
has, thus far, been demonstrated to have economic potential'.
Mr Gutnick, who says the company has never claimed anything more than a
significant prospect at Nabberu, accuses Stockdale of playing down the
significance of the diamond find to protect its own interests in the area.
'De Beers have a reputation for trying to discredit any joint venture
partners that may be a threat to their monopoly,' he says. 'We are convinced
there is a good chance that there is a good quality diamond mine there
because de Beers has told us that."
Stockdale was reluctant to comment, but Mr Robert Danchin, exploration
manager asks why the company would play down the prospects of a potential
mine in which it is a joint venturer.
'I am heartily fed up with the whole business,' he says.
Stockdale's bearish assessment of the diamond prospect has taken some of the
steam out of the shares, but Great Central is still trading at about
ADollars 14, valuing the company at more than ADollars 750m.
Mr Gutnick, meanwhile, is plainly unfazed by the sudden publicity
surrounding his company. He has returned to the US, where he is conducting a
second 'road-trip'. Accompanied by Great Central's geologist and an outside
gem specialist, he has visited Florida, Atlanta, St Louis and is now heading
on to Chicago  - the second visit to the Windy City. This time, Great
Central's ADRs have behaved more sedately, fluctuating around the USDollars
10-mark.
