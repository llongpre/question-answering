almost overlooked - Kenneth Gooding talks to the British-born lady geologist
who in 1972 found Australia's first diamond

Companies scrambling to take part in Australia's biggest diamond exploration
boom for many years owe a great debt to Ms Maureen Muggeridge.
This British-born geologist earned a place in geological history when she
found Australia's first diamond in 1972 - before that many experts believed
there were no diamonds to be found in the country, despite its huge size,
because the geology was wrong.
She was also part of the team that seven years later located the Argyle AK1
deposit in the far north of Western Australia, one of the country's most
important mineral discoveries and now the world's largest diamond producer,
at least in terms of the weight.
Ms Muggeridge, now 46, was born in Croydon, near London, and is the niece of
the late Mr Malcolm Muggeridge, the eccentric British writer. She spent her
childhood in Nigeria and earned her geology degree at St Andrew's
University, Glasgow. She recalls she then set out for Australia 'to get some
sunshine unquote'.
She was given a job by Tanganyika Holdings, which then was the only company
seriously exploring for diamonds in Australia, apart from, inevitably, De
Beers, the South African group which dominates the industry, via its
subsidiary Stockdale. Tanganyika was eventually absorbed by CRA, one of
Australia's big mining groups and one capable of finding the large sums
required to finance a diamond mine.
Ms Muggeridge recalls that the vital clues to the massive Argyle deposit
were nearly missed. 'I was a bit pushy and insisted we leave no gaps in the
exploration work.' So with only one geologist assistant she set out in a
helicopter on what proved to be an immensely profitable sortie for CRA. One
consolation was that her assistant on that trip was Mr John Towie, now a
director of rival Australian diamond exploration group, Triad Minerals, whom
she had then just wed.
The 38 diamond grains in the sample they sent back for testing could have
fitted easily on the head of a match. Once those traces had been found,
however, it was an easy task to trace them back to the Argyle deposit.
'Searching for diamonds is much worse than looking for a needle in a
haystack,' says Ms Muggeridge. 'At least you can burn down the haystack and
use a metal detector. Success in diamond exploration depends heavily on the
expertise of the people involved and, because diamonds and their host rocks
are so rare, they are extremely hard to find and a long term approach is an
absolute necessity.'
For the past five years she has been exploration director of Moonstone
Diamond Corporation, which last November raised ADollars 5m (USDollars 3.6m)
on the Australian Stock Exchange, enough for two year's exploration work.
Ms Muggeridge was among the speakers at the first Australian Diamond
Conference here in Perth last week.
The standing room only event was one indication of how diamond fever has
taken hold in Western Australia. Another came from Mr Michael Thomson of
stockbrokers Eyres Reed when he estimated that in the past year diamond
exploration companies in Australia had raised at least ADollars 72m.
As usual in mining booms, many of the companies involved are as interested
in bulling up their share prices as in looking for gem stones. This has led
to some unease and complaints, particularly about the way some report their
exploration results - so far no set procedures have been fixed for this.
At the conference Mr Wolf Marx, convener of the diamond reporting committee
of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, read from a number
of recent explorers' reports that left out crucial information such as the
value of diamonds found or referred to values or even connotations of value
(such as 'gem' or 'near gem') of a small number of diamonds that were
potentially misleading.
'Diamond exploration geologists, exploration managers and even chairmen of
mining companies are unlikely to have sufficient expertise to give accurate
assessments of diamond values,' he explained. 'This is made worse if the
stones are micro diamonds which, by definition, cannot be considered to have
any value other than scientific.'
Delegates cheered up, however, when Mr Chris Jennings, an international
explorer associated with the discoveries in the North West Territories that
caused Canada's recent diamond rush, said new technical expertise and
knowledge justified more exploration in Australia, including in those areas
already studied for diamonds. 'Since Argyle there has been no intense
exploration in Australia,' he said. 'There are probably big areas where
there is some sort of potential for diamonds - I feel confident about it.'
Nevertheless, finding those diamonds will not be easy. Mr Yannic Mercier,
Geneva-based chairman of Ms Muggeridge's Moonstone Corporation, jokingly
told delegates that when he was first invited to invest he replied: 'Setting
up a diamond exploration company raises only two questions; how much money
you want to lose and how long will you give yourself to lose it'.
