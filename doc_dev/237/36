   A multimillion dollar agreement to import
Angola's diamonds announced this month by New York-based Lazare
Kaplan International could translate into more than just much-needed
hard currency to the war-ravaged southern African nation.
   Under terms negotiated with Endiama, the Angolan state diamond
company, Lazare Kaplan will import $20 million a year in
high-quality, uncut gem diamonds for processing at its plant in
Caguas, Puerto Rico, company spokeswoman Amy Wiener said in a
telephone interview from New York.
   Wiener said the first shipment has arrived for cutting and
polishing in the plant.
   The agreement is the first major international business deal
announced with the Marxist-oriented government since the signature
Dec. 22 of U.S.-brokered accords by Angola, Cuba and South Africa on
the phased withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   The withdrawal is being made in return for the independence of
the South African-controlled territory of Namibia, formerly known as
South-West Africa.
   ``I was impressed by the fact that all those with whom we met in
Luanda took a business-like, non-ideological approach,'' LKI
Chairman Maurice Tempelsman said in a company news release.
   ``In view of the close diplomatic cooperation between the
American and Angolan authorities in connection with the withdrawal
of South African and Cuban forces from Angola and Namibia, there is
no reason why this agreement should not be followed by many mutually
beneficial examples of economic cooperation between our two
countries.''
   The United States has no diplomatic relations with Angola, which
gained independence from Portugal in 1975 after a 14-year colonial
war and has since been fighting U.S.-and South African-backed rebels.
   Ms. Wiener said the diamond importing agreement, the first LKI
has made with Angola, was indirectly related to the December accords.
   ``The peace process was moving forward, and continues to move
forward,'' she said. ``It can only help business, and we're
encouraged by it.''
   South Africa agreed to stop supporting Jonas Savimbi and his
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, but the United
States continues to supply about $15 million a year in military aid
through bases in neighboring Zaire.
   Before his inauguration, President Bush wrote Savimbi assuring
him of continued U.S. support in order to pressure Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos into negotiating.
   Nearly 90 percent of Angola's hard currency earnings come from
oil pumped mainly by an Angolan-American consortium in fields near
the mouth of the Zaire River.
   Under Portuguese rule, Angola was exporting between 5 percent and
8 percent of the world's diamond production. Exports fell following
independence but rose in 1981-82 to 1.3 million carats worth $165
million.
   In 1987 the Portuguese company SPE (Portuguese Entrepreneurial
Society) signed a cooperation agreement with Endiama, and 50
Portuguese technicians are working in Angola as diamond mining
advisers.
   A delegation from Endiama visited Lisbon earlier this month
following a trip to the United States, and there have been newspaper
reports here of a possible joint venture between Portugal and Angola
in mining and finishing.
   Throughout the 1980s Portugal has been an illicit export route
for unfinished Angolan diamonds. The Lisbon daily Europeu said the
illicit trade amounted to $200 million in 1983 alone.
   In 1984, Savimbi-led rebels attacked diamond mines in
northeastern Angola, and production fell off sharply.
   The area was later divided into production blocs and leased to
mining companies in the same way Angola has awarded concessions to
oil companies. The Angolan army now provides security in the
diamond-mining areas.
   Ms. Wiener said LKI does not plan to become involved in actual
diamond mining in Angola.
