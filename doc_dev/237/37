BHP Minerals and its Canadian partner have given the clearest indications
yet that they are set to go ahead with construction of North America's first
diamond mine in the Lac de Gras area of the Northwest Territories.
Announcing another round of encouraging drilling results, BHP and Dia-Met
Minerals said that they planned to expand the airstrip at the remote site
300km north-east of Yellow-knife. About 170 people are already working at
the site.
BHP is also assembling data for environmental impact studies, and holding
talks with local communities to address their concerns about mining
development.
The partners are not scheduled to make a final decision on a mine until the
end of this year. But Mr John Hainey, analyst at Canaccord Capital in
Toronto, predicted that, based on the latest results, BHP and Dia-Met will
initially develop two high-grade kimberlite pipes, known as Koala and Panda.
The latest sample from Koala, weighing 1,193 tonnes, yielded 6,600 diamonds
with a total weight of 893 carats. The average grade was 0.75 carats a
tonne. The Panda pipe, which is almost adjacent to Koala, yielded a total of
270 carats from 230 tonnes of ore, giving an average grade of 1.18 carats a
tonne.
BHP and Dia-Met also announced the first results from two other pipes,
Misery and Falcon. The Misery deposit, which is 44km from Koala, produced a
grade of 0.75 carats a tonne from a sample of 132 tonnes. These results
included one 4.2 carat stone 'of very significant value'.
The partners were expected to disclose further details of their plans at
Dia-Met's annual meeting yesterday at its head office in Kelowna, British
Columbia.
