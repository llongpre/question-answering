   Two companies are trying to add some glitter to the drab copper
and iron-ore mining scene of far northern Michigan.
   It started as a glint in a Dow Chemical Co. metallurgist's eye.
First Dow, and now a Colorado company, Crystal Exploration Inc.,
entered the search for diamonds in the state's Upper Peninsula.
   Seven Kimberlite pipes _ volcanic rock shafts that can yield the
earth's hardest mineral _ have been discovered.
   Core drilling has unearthed a scattering of sand-grain sized
diamonds, too few and too small for commercial production. But the
explorers say the search is young.
   The pipe formations are in a 40-mile area around Iron Mountain
and Crystal Falls, at the western end of the Upper Peninsula along
the Wisconsin border.
   In the few places on earth they are found, Kimberlite pipes
occur in clusters of up to several dozen, said James Huml, a Dow
research associate.
   Huml, a metallurgist by trade and geologist by avocation, said
he thinks there are more than a dozen Kimberlite pipes in the Upper
Peninsula.
   Dow has searched for six years. Now more exploration and mining
expertise is needed, Huml said. ``Dow is not a hard-rock mining
company.''
   Dow recently sold its mineral leases and geological data, for an
undisclosed amount, to Crystal Exploration Inc., a Colorado
subsidiary of Sydney, Australia's Restech International Ltd.
Restech has mineral exploration and gold mining operations in
western Australia.
   It will carry on the search, while Dow holds onto an option to
take part in the exploration and development, and to share in any
profits.
   Occasional diamond finds in Ohio farm fields in the late 1800s
and early 1900s long had geologists looking to te north, said
Crystal Exploration's president, Sigfried Muessig.
   Muessig said a Kimberlite pipe, named for Kimberly in the
diamond-mining region of South Africa, is the only formation known
to produce the gems.
   ``It is a cylindrical formation where volcanic rock has come up
120 miles from the bowels of the earth, and the heat and pressure
have formed the diamonds,'' he said.
   ``It's a very rare occurrence,'' Huml said. Other Kimberlite
pipes have been found in Arkansas, Kansas, Wyoming and Colorado.
None commercially produce diamonds.
   There were no volcanic remnants in Ohio, so geologists thought
glaciers carried the diamonds there from Canada, Muessig said.
   But he said the focus shifted in 1981 when the U.S. Geological
Survey found a Kimberlite formation _ the Lake Ellen Pipe _ about
10 miles northeast of Crystal Falls.
   It was evidence that volcanoes smoked and spewed nearly 200
million years ago in the Upper Peninsula, and possibly generated
the heat and compression forces to leave a diamond treasure behind.
   The glaciers flattened the volcanoes, but since 1981 Dow has
found six more Kimberlite pipes _ several hundred feet across at
the surface and covered by volcanic debris, Huml said.
   In Dow's explorations, he said, ``We have found microdiamonds,
generally small, less than a millimeter in diameter. They are
grain-sized.''
   But the explorers still think the western Upper Peninsula was
the source of the gems found in farm fields to the south. ``We
think there is good potential, because of the historical finds,''
Muessig said.
   Crystal Exploration will do more sampling in the already
discovered pipes in the next year, Muessig said, and will continue
exploring for more Kimberlite formations, ``in hopes the next pipe
we discover will have gem-quality stones.''
