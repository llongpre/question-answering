THE HANDFUL of companies with diamond mining expertise have been deluged
with inquiries and proposals in the past year following the excitement
generated by discoveries in Canada's North West Territories.
Ashton Mining, the Australian company with a 40.1 per cent stake in the
Argyle diamond mine, the western world's biggest producer in volume terms,
has had more than a dozen offers to analyse, says Mr John Robinson, chief
executive. 'The renewed interest in diamond exploration has flushed out many
opportunities and we have been putting them through a stringent screening
process.'
Mr Robinson, insists that, if all the exploration activity produces a new
diamond mine, it would not destabilise the market. He points out that world
diamond output fell by 3 per cent in value to USDollars 6bn last year and
'production in Russia is falling, Zaire's output is down 25 per cent and in
1993 there has been only a trickle of diamonds from Angola'.
Ashton has settled on three projects in Canada: the Lupin joint venture in
the Northwest Territories where Ashton has the right to buy 51 per cent of a
project covering 6,300 square km (2,400 square miles) in the Slave Lake
province from Pure Gold Resources; some 15,500 sq km in the Peace River
district of Alberta, where Ashton is earning 51 per cent, again from Pure
Gold Resources; and the James Bay venture in Ontario where Ashton can earn
51 per cent from KWG Resources.
Mr Robinson says that all this activity has forced Ashton into an abrupt
switch of emphasis away from gold, in which it was getting more involved,
and towards diamonds. Consequently, the company is to reduce its 90 per cent
shareholding in the Mt Muro gold project in Indonesia which requires about
ADollars 110m to bring into production.
Outside Canada, Ashton is putting together a formal licence application
after signing an agreement in principle for a diamond joint venture with the
government in Karelia, western Russia. The area of the licence covers about
two thirds of the republic.
Ashton has 51 per cent of another diamond project in the Great Lakes area of
Michigan, US, but Mr Robinson says the most prospective area in the
portfolio  - because it is the most advanced  - is in the Northern Territory
of Australia where the company has a 67.7 per cent interest. Samples from
the Merlin prospect in the area last year produced 20 commercial size
diamonds, one in four of them of gem quality and the largest of 2.44 carats.
The Argyle mine's output this year is forecast to be close to the record 39m
carats produced last year, says Mr Robinson, who is in London to talk to
institutional investors.
