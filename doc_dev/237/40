ASHTON MINING, 40 per cent owner of Australia's big Argyle diamond mine, has
entered the Lac de Gras diamond hunt in Canada's Northwest Territories,
writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. It has formed a joint venture with a
Canadian exploration company and has shipped four tonnes of mineral samples
to its laboratories for testing.
So far Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary, the UK's RTZ (through Kennecott,
its US subsidiary) and De Beers of South Africa have been the only prominent
international companies known to be active in the hunt. Altogether 5.2m
hectares (13m acres) have been staked.
