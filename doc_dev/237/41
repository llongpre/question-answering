   DE BEERS CONSOLIDATED MINES LTD. said it reached agreement with South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers for wage increases covering about 9,000 black diamond miners. 

   The agreement, reached after four months of negotiations, provides for a wage increase of 18%, or 70 rand ($34.22) a month, for an unskilled, novice miner. 
That will raise the minimum wage at the group's mines to 480 rand ($234.60) a month. 

   Overall, wage increases for eight categories of worker were agreed upon. 
A skilled miner in the top category will receive a monthly increase of 190 rand, raising the top monthly wage to 1,400 rand. 

   The increases are retroactive to May at some mines and to June at others. 

   De Beers controls more than 80% of the world's diamond market. 

   At the end of August, the National Union of Mineworkers ended a three-week strike against gold and coal mines. 
The union won increased vacation pay and improved death benefits. 
It had sought an across-the-board wage increase of 27%, but the mine owners stuck to the boosts of between 15% and 23% implemented prior to the strike.
