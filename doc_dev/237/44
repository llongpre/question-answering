   Tourists dream of instant wealth at
North America's only diamond-mining park. But companies with the
same hopes for the Crater of Diamonds State Park have
environmentalists worried.
   ``This land belongs to the public and should be preserved, not
used to line somebody's pockets,'' said Jim Stanley, a Little Rock
attorney representing the Sierra Club, part of a coalition of
environmental groups threatening legal action to stop the potential
exhaustion of a unique natural resource.
   Retiree James Archer is a regular among the 700 visitors a day
who sweat and swear on diamond digs for just a $3 admission ticket.
Archer, 64, shovels clumps of dirt into a wire-screened pan then
dunks it vigorously in a large tub of water, allowing heavy
material _ diamonds, he hopes _ to settle. Most of his pans turn up
nothing and others produce diamonds the size of a pinhead. But for
the discoverer even small stones carry the satisfaction of
Tiffany's finest.
   ``I don't care if I find a big diamond,'' Archer said. ``I just
want to keep a-digging.''
   The largest diamond found at the park was a 40-carat, 33-point,
light-pink stone unearthed in 1925 by miners and dubbed ``Uncle
Sam.'' The largest found by a tourist was a 16-carat, 37-point,
white stone dug up in 1975.
   The state has moved cautiously in its authorization of
commercial core drilling on the 35-acre field in southwestern
Arkansas. Gov. Bill Clinton in 1986 appointed a Diamond Mining
Advisory Task Force to study the idea of mining at the park, and
the state Parks and Tourism Commission distributed paperwork to
more than 50 companies or individuals who might be interested.
   ``It has forced us to ask a lot of questions about what we
really want out of the only resource of its kind in the U.S.,''
said Richard Davies, the acting director of the Parks and Tourism
Department.
   ``It also made us realize that we made some strategic mistakes
at the park, because the crater is not very user-friendly.'' A
35-acre plowed field where people can look for diamonds is
inaccessible to the handicapped and doesn't have water fountains,
restrooms or other amenities.
   The commission voted last month to work with four companies who
will share the estimated $350,000 cost of initial studies plus the
cost of any litigation. Test drilling could begin by April if the
process is not delayed by a lawsuit by the Sierra Club and the
Friends of the Crater of Diamonds.
   ``This is something completely new in mineral exploration,''
said John Morgan, a consulting engineer who served as a state
adviser. ``You have four companies cooperating with the state to
conduct tests in the most effective manner. Normally, they would be
slitting each other's throats.''
   Should the state decide to allow mining, only the companies
paying for the initial studies will be allowed to seek digging
rights, Davies said. ``I think a lot of these companies are used to
spending money on a gamble.''
   Environmentalists who attended an earlier commission meeting at
which preliminary core drilling was approved say even those tests
could mean diamonds aren't forever at the park. ``We see this as a
foot-in-the-door type thing. If they get the test drilling in
there, it defeats the principle of inviolacy of park lands,'' said
Stanley, the Sierra Club attorney.
   ``It's a lose-lose situation. If the results come back and they
say there are lots of diamonds there may be incredible pressure to
open it to commercial mining. If they come back and say it's a dry
hole, then much of the mystique of the park may disappear.
   ``We prefer to leave a little bit of the aura of mystery out
there.''
   To allow tests, the Interior Department had to grant a
``temporary non-recreational use'' of the diamond field. ``This is
a political decision,'' said Dean Banks, coordinator of Friends of
Crater of Diamonds State Park.
   Past drilling has shown that the diamond-bearing ore goes down
at least 205 feet. Six to 10 feet of earth have been scraped away
in 50 years, so the park could last centuries, said Superintendent
Jim Cannon. No projections have a commercial site in production
past about 50 years, he said.
   Cannon, 39, doesn't like to talk politics, but he does like to
brag about the crater, where he has been in charge since 1973.
``Personally, I'm cautious about any major changes in the park that
would have a major impact, and this certainly would have a major
impact,'' he said of testing.
   Attempts for more than a century to commercially mine diamonds
at the site have flopped, he said, because of a lack of experience
or capital. The mine was idle when the state acquired it for
$750,000 in 1972.
   Bad luck and bad feelings also figured in past failures, Cannon
said. One father-son team found itself facing 36 lawsuits after a
year in operation and their mining plant was gone after three
mysterious fires in one night.
   The four companies that will take part in the studies are
Continental Diamonds, 51 percent owned by Galactic Resources Ltd.,
of Vancouver, Canada; Arkansas Diamond Development Co., owned by
Sunshine Mining Co. and Exdiam Inc., both of Dallas, and Rhombus
Inc. of Little Rock; Capricorn Diamonds of West Perth, Australia;
and Kennecott Inc. of Salt Lake City.
   Such companies may offer improved technology and big backing,
according to Cannon. Even so, they're gambling _ just like the
hopeful tourists who slog through the often muddy field bearing
shovels and pans.
   ``It's a combination of curiosity and quick riches. Gambling _
an idea of buying a $3 ticket and perhaps finding something of
untold worth.''
