FT  26 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet diamond loan honoured

IN SPITE of the turmoil in the Soviet Union, the country has been
punctilious in making loan repayments and delivering diamonds against the
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.95bn), five-year sales agreement signed last year with
De Beers' international rough (uncut) diamond cartel.
The Soviet Union, the world's second-largest diamond producer, joined the
cartel organised by De Beers, the South African mining group, last July. De
Beers loaned the country USDollars 1bn.
Mr Gary Ralfe, a De Beers director close to the Soviet deal, said yesterday
that the last Dollars 150m of the loan had been drawn down in January, about
three months later than first expected. Soviet diamond stockpiles, being
held as collateral, had been transferred to the London offices of De Beers'
Central Selling Organisation (CSO).
Speaking in London after De Beers published its annual report, Mr Ralfe said
that the Soviet diamond mines were working normally in spite of the
upheavals, possibly because they were in such a remote area and because the
standard of living was relatively good.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of De Beers, said he was now confident
that his group's diamond sales would this year match the Dollars 4.2bn
achieved in 1990.
In the early part of this year the rough diamond market had been dominated
by the Gulf war, which curtailed polishing activity in Israel for several
weeks and reduced trading activity everywhere. But the first three of the
CSO's monthly diamond sales were 'reasonably satisfactory, which indicates
the underlying confidence in the trade'.
The diamond industry was well-positioned to grow, he added.
De Beers' sales contract with Botswana, the world's most important rough
diamond producer in value terms, ended in December, but Mr Ogilvie Thompson
said he expected a new one would be signed in a matter of weeks. He also
expected the CSO would continue to sell all Botswana's diamonds in spite of
the calls by some politicians for up to 20 per cent to be sold
independently.
