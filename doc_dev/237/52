   A ban on imports of diamonds mined in South
Africa could be ineffective and probably would be widely evaded,
according to a a congressional study released Friday.
   Such a ban would have little effect on South Africa's economy,
said the study by the General Accounting Office, the investigating
arm of Congress, because diamonds are only about 2 percent of the
country's exports.
   Diamonds are not covered by the 1986 law that imposed various
trade sanctions on South Africa in an action against the country's
racial separation policy, apartheid. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., asked the General Accounting Office for a report on the
feasibility of banning imports of South African diamonds.
   Diamonds cannot be physically distinguished by country of
origin. The DeBeers Central Selling Organization, which buys most
of the world's diamonds and markets 75 percent to 85 percent of all
diamonds sold in the world, already has refused to cooperate in
keeping track of South African diamonds.
   DeBeers' mines in South Africa, Botswana and Namimbia account
for 36 percent of world production, and 17 percent of the value of
the sales of the selling organization come from diamonds mined in
South Africa, the GAO report noted.
   Diamonds are traded so often before reaching the major consuming
countries that ``many opportunities would arise to create false
certificates of origins for diamonds of South African or unknown
origin,'' GAO said. False certificates already are reported used
for sales to India, which bans diamond imports from South Africa,
the agency said.
   The only possibility of an effective ban would come through
agreements between the United States and other nations with major
diamond cutting indusrtries _ Belgium, India and Israel, the report
said.
   In such a case, GAO said cutters could be forced to chose
between buying from DeBeers and direct purchases from producing
countries, and the producers might not sell to them because they
derive advantages from their DeBeers connection _ notably the
company's marketing expertise and policy of buying diamonds even
when the market is weak.
   But if the producers broke loose, they could capture some of
DeBeers' profits, either independently or in a cartel, at the cost
of assuming the risks of market fluctuations, GAO said.
