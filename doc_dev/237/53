FT  11 JAN 93 / Cartels appear to be forever: The diamond market has been
stabilised

There is an almost tangible feeling of relief in the diamond-cutting centres
of Antwerp, Bombay and Tel Aviv, because the diamond producers' cartel run
by De Beers of South Africa has regained its tight grip on the market.
Only a few months ago, a large number of unwanted stones was flooding the
market, and there were fears that rough (uncut) diamond prices might
collapse.
But now traders suggest that prices are getting firmer, and there are
shortages of particular types of polished stones. 'Rough (diamond) buyers
say the market is now in balance rather than a buyer's market as it was a
few weeks ago,' says Mr Mark Cockle, editor of Diamond International, the
trade publication.
A few traders suggest that De Beers' first rough diamond price increase
since a 5.5 per cent rise in March 1990 is not far away.
However, both diamond producers and De Beers itself have incurred
considerable financial pain to return the market to stability. Sales by the
group's London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls at least
80 per cent of world trade in rough diamonds, fell 13 per cent from the 1991
level to Dollars 3.147bn last year - the lowest for five years. De Beers
warned last summer that it might cut its 1992 dividend in March, and
industry observers say it used up all the Dollars 800m cash it had in the
bank at the end of 1991 and was forced to borrow.
Mr Harry Oppenheimer, whose father founded De Beers and sister company the
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, and whose family still
effectively has control, said recently: 'Paying dividends is a high
priority, although in the nature of De Beers not necessarily the highest.
The highest priority is keeping the money together to protect the diamond
industry so that we'll continue to pay dividends for another 100 years.'
Apart from its own production in Namibia and South Africa, De Beers has
contracts to sell most of the rough diamonds produced by Angola, Australia,
Botswana, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Tanzania and Zaire. It
operates a 'buffer pool', stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating
stocks when demand runs ahead of supply.
Rough stones are released to the market in a controlled stream, through
'sights' offered by the CSO 10 times a year to about 160 carefully chosen
buyers. De Beers offers the quantities and types of diamonds that its market
intelligence network indicates the market can absorb. Each buyer is offered
boxes of diamonds costing between Dollars 500,000 and Dollars 25m and has to
accept or reject them all.
Traders maintain that the CSO reduced the value of diamonds on offer at each
of the last five sights of 1992 to a total of about Dollars 300m - low by
recent standards. At the same time, De Beers told diamond producers to cut
their previously agreed deliveries by 25 per cent (permitted under CSO
contracts at times of stress), which means the company's stockpile is not
growing at such a fast rate.
Last year De Beers also had to cope with an unexpected flow of rough
diamonds from Angola where, at its peak, about 50,000 private enterprise
diggers were picking stones from dried-up river beds.
The stones were smuggled out of Angola, mainly to Antwerp, where De Beers
tried to buy them. At the height of the rush, De Beers' buyer in Antwerp
spent nearly Dollars 40m in one week.
The group estimates that about Dollars 500m worth of stones was smuggled out
of Angola last year, representing a 10 per cent addition to world supply.
This compares with Angolan production of about 1m carats of rough diamonds
worth about Dollars 100m in 1991.
Renewed political tension and war in the country recently has stopped the
smuggling and even brought an end to the government's own diamond
production.
Rumours of substantial smuggling out of Russia have also dogged the market.
However, De Beers says the five-year marketing contract signed in 1990 with
the then Soviet Union allowed 5 per cent of production to be sold outside
the cartel. The rough diamonds surfacing in Moscow for export to the west
outside the cartel's channels are mainly from this source, according to De
Beers.
When the contract was signed, De Beers advanced the Soviet Union a Dollars
1bn loan, and Soviet diamond stocks were moved from Moscow to London as
collateral. De Beers says that, in spite of the subsequent political
changes, Russia has kept its side of the deal and paid interest on the loan
on time.
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at the Credit Lyonnais Laing financial services
group, says it is good news for the diamond market that stability has been
achieved at CSO sales levels above those seen through much of the 1980s (see
chart). But he suggests there will have to be substantial growth in demand -
about 6 per cent a year following a 'recovery' year with 12 per cent growth
 -to absorb all potential supply by the late 1990s.
Ironically, much of the extra supply is coming from De Beers's new R1.1bn
Venetia mine in the northern Transvaal which, when in full production later
this year, will become South Africa's biggest diamond mine.
Mr Coulson says: 'Some suggest it won't be until 1998 that the market will
be entirely in balance - and the CSO will still be left with a substantial
diamond stockpile to finance.' De Beers is looking east to help mop up the
extra supply. Having developed the Japanese appetite for diamonds virtually
from scratch over the past decade, the company is looking to new markets in
China and India by the end of the 1990s.
