ASHTON Mining, the Australian diamond miner, plans to swell the nation's
heavy schedule of private equity raisings with the ADollars 112m (USDollars
75.2m) flotation of its gold production interests.
Ashton directors said yesterday the company would consolidate its Australian
and Indonesian gold interests into a company called Aurora Gold, and
initially make a placement to institutional shareholders.
Private investors would then be offered 25 per cent of the placement shares,
with Ashton retaining a 30 per cent stake in Aurora, which would potentially
rank among the top 10 Australian gold producers.
Ashton, 47 per cent controlled by Malaysian Mining Corporation, is a partner
in the Argyle diamond mine in Western Australia. Ironically, the company
appeared to be moving its investment strategy away from gold as recently as
March this year.
At that time, directors said the company would focus on opportunities in the
diamond sector and place its Mount Muro gold mine in Indonesia out to
tender.
But that was when the gold price was languishing at around Dollars 327 an
ounce. Since then, the price has strengthened by around 20 per cent,
prompting a rush by investors for Australian gold stocks.
The gold price jump was seen by analysts last night as the main factor
behind Ashton's change of heart. Assets likely to be offered in the Aurora
float include Mount Muro and interests in the Laverton, Harbour Lights, and
Bardoc properties in Western Australia.
Ashton's share of gold production from these properties rose from 131,465oz
to 135,307oz in the latest year. Mount Muro has the potential to produce
around 150,000oz per year. Ashton shares yesterday closed 6 cents higher at
ADollars 2.22 on Australian stock exchanges.
