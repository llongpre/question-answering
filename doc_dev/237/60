   The De Beers diamond firm has
announced the discovery of an egg-sized, 599-carat diamond and said
it is currently the world's largest uncut diamond with an estimated
cut value of $30 million.
   Officials of the South African company said the white diamond,
dubbed ``The Big Rock,'' was found at a mine near Pretoria in July
1986, but its discovery was kept secret to all but a handful of De
Beers executives.
   De Beers' chairman Julian Thompson announced the find at the
firm's 100th anniversary banquet in Kimberly Friday night.
   ``It's a perfect blue-white color,'' said South African gem
expert Gaby Tolkowski, who will cut and polish the stone.
   There have been larger raw diamonds uncovered previously, but
they were cut into smaller gems.
   The 1988 Guinness Book of World Records recorded the Cullinan
diamond as the world's largest uncut diamond ever found. It was
discovered in 1905 near Pretoria and weighed 3,106 carats, or more
than 1.25 pounds.
   The Cullinan was cut into 105 stones, including the 530.2-carat
Star of Africa, the world's largest known cut diamond, according to
Guinness. The Star of Africa is the centerpiece of the British
royal scepter.
   In its cut form, the ``Big Rock'' is expected to be about 350
carats and sell for an estimated $30 million, the company said.
   DeBeers is the world's largest diamond company and controls an
estimated 80 percent of the world's diamond production through its
central selling organization in London.
