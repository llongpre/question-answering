   The De Beer diamond cartel said it will raise
prices for rough gemstones an average of 13.5 percent because a
weak dollar has increased demand for their products in Asia and
Europe.
   De Beers, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, controls 80
percent of the world's rough diamond market through its
London-based marketing arm, Central Selling Organization.
   Sales of diamonds are priced in dollars and have been boosted by
the drop in the U.S. currency, which makes them cheaper to holders
of Japanese yen and European currencies.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said the price increases for a
broad range of uncut diamonds will take effect May 3.
   ``The increases are not weighted toward any particular
category,'' said spokesman Richard Dickson.
   When De Beers last raised its prices, by an average 10 percent
on Oct. 5, the biggest increases were for better-quality diamonds.
That was the only price increase in 1987 and followed a jump of
14.5 percent, in two steps, in 1986.
   De Beers does not disclose its prices.
   But, as an example, the wholesale price of a polished,
one-carat, D-flawless diamond _ the highest grade _ costs about
$15,000.
   The cartel sets prices for rough diamonds only. It operates a
pipeline of diamonds from its mines in Africa and Australia to
dealers and cutters in the world's major diamond centers _ Antwerp,
Bombay, New York and Tel Aviv.
   ``The rough market is strong, the prices of polished diamonds
are strong, retail demand is good,'' Dickson said. ``Much of the
motor for the momentum behind demand is coming from Japan and
Southeast Asia.''
   De Beers enjoyed record sales of $3.075 billion in 1987, up 23
percent from sales of $2.5 billion in 1986.
   Diamond sales, which slumped in the early 1980s, jumped even
though De Beers cut supply after the Oct. 19 stock markets' crash,
Dickson said.
   ``We carried that cautious policy through the early part of
1988. We reacted very quickly. What we wouldn't want to do is sell
diamonds that the market couldn't absorb.''
   Jewelry sales generally were strong at Christmas, he added.
   ``The mood is optimistic and we would look foreward to 1988
being a good year,'' said Dickson.
   De Beers holds about 10 ``sights'' _ or sales _ for
international diamond dealers a year, Dickson said.
   Most of the world's diamonds are industrial diamonds, used
mainly for drilling because they are so hard. From 10 percent to 20
percent are gems.
