   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. plans to split
its foreign operations from its South African business in an
apparent move to shelter the huge diamond mining company from
political turmoil in South African.
   De Beers said Tuesday the plans were intended to focus attention
on the company's international nature and its true business value.
   ``Basically it's going to lose some, if not all of the discount
of being a South African share,'' said Rob Davies, a mining analyst
at Shearson Lehman Hutton International in London.
   De Beers also announced its net profit soared 37 percent last
year.
   Chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson denied there were political
reasons for the company's split.
   Speaking at a Johannesburg news conference that was relayed to
London, he said the split would give De Beers better access to
international capital markets; enable shareholders to better
identify earnings, dividends and assets attributable to the South
African and foreign sides of the business; and allow the two sides
to develop their businesses better.
   Analysts said the move would insulate the company _ which in
1989 made 80 percent of its profit from foreign businesses _ from
its South African ties and from moves to end white-minority rule in
that country.
   The African National Congress party has said it would
nationalize South Africa's mines and other major sectors of the
economy, if it comes into power.
   Furthermore, many investors are reluctant to invest in South
African companies because of its government policies of racial
separation. In the United States, government sanctions prohibit
Americans from making fresh investments in South African equities.
   ``It should open up the share to a wider market,'' Davies said
of the De Beers plan.
   Ogilvie Thompson also denied that the plan was linked to Minorco
SA's failed hostile takeover bid for the British mining company
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC last year.
   The bid by Minorco, which is controlled by De Beers and the
associated Anglo American Corp., was seen as an attempt by South
Africa's Oppenheimer family to diversify its gold and diamond
mining empire further outside South Africa.
   Under the proposed split, De Beers' South African company will
continue to be called De Beers Consolidated Mines. De Beers'
foreign businesses would be grouped under a Swiss company, De Beers
Centenary AG, although both companies will be headed by the same
board of directors.
   De Beers said it would give existing shareholders one share in
Centenary for each De Beers share they own. The two shares will be
tradeable only as a single unit on the nine exchanges where De
Beers shares are traded, the company said.
   De Beers said it would retain a 9.5 percent stake in Centenary.
   John Taylor, an analyst at the London investment firm James
Capel and Co., said, ``Essentially, it's an extremely cheap share.
People were giving it a low rating because of the politics of
investing in South Africa.''
   The split means ``the political risk to a certain extent has
disappeared,'' Taylor said. De Beers can just allow shares in the
companies to trade separately if the situation in South Africa
deteriorates, he said.
   The plan is subject to final approval by South African
regulators, who have approved in principle. It also must be
approved by shareholders. Support already has been given by Anglo
American, which has a 33 percent stake, and De Beers Botswana
Mining Co. (Pty) Ltd., which holds 5 percent.
