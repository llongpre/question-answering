Almazy Rossii-Sakha, Russia's biggest diamond mining company, is seeking
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) to invest in two new diamond mines over the next
10 years, Mr Vladimir Piskunov, company vice-president, said in London
yesterday. The deposits are in the Prilensk and Daldyino-Alakitsk regions,
writes Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent. He said that the company's new
Jubilee (or Ubilinnaya) diamond mine, which cost about Dollars 500m, would
be in production next year. Mr Piskunov said the mine needed only Dollars
10m more. Western analysts pointed out that this implied the start-up would
be at least three years behind the original schedule.
