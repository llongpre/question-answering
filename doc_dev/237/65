   The De Beers diamond cartel of South Africa, citing
strong demand, says it is increasing prices for rough gemstones an
average 15.5 percent.
   The price increase for a broad range of uncut diamonds, announced
Tuesday, is effective next week. It follows a 13.5 percent increase
last May and a 10 percent increase in September 1987.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., which is based in Johannesburg,
controls 80 percent of the world's rough diamond market through its
London-based marketing arm, Central Selling Organization.
   It does not disclose what the prices are.
   The cartel only sets prices for rough diamonds, which it doesn't
disclose, and operates a pipeline of diamonds from its mines in
South Africa and Australia to dealers and cutters in the world's
major diamond cutting centers, Antwerp, Bombay, New York and Tel
Aviv.
   It holds about 10 ``sights'' _ or sales _ for international
diamond dealers a year, with the next one scheduled for next week.
   ``We are responding to prevailing conditions in the market. It
was market-led,'' spokesman Richard Dickson said Thursday about the
price increase.
   Demand for rough diamonds of two carats and less is especially
strong, he said.
   ``The industry is anticipating another good year in 1989 from
retail diamond and jewelry sales,'' Dickson said.
   The generally weaker dollar has helped sales because diamonds are
priced in dollars and holders of Japanese yen and European
currencies get more for their money.
   In addition, sales should improve in Japan after April 1 when a
15 percent tax in Britain on luxury items costing about $300 or more
is replaced with a flat 3 percent sales tax on all items, Dickson
said.
   The markets in Israel and India are particularly strong, with
good advances also in New York and Belgium, he said.
   ``We are bringing rough prices up in line with those prices of
polished diamonds that are prevailing within the diamond cutting
centers,'' he said.
   The organization had record sales of $4.2 billion in 1988, up 37
percent from $3.08 billion in 1987, the previous record.
   Most of the world's diamonds are industrial diamonds, used
primarily in drilling. Between 10 percent and 20 percent are gems.
