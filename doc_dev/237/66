Reliance Industries, the Indian petrochemicals and textiles conglomerate,
yesterday said it was one of five contenders chosen by the Indian government
to explore and develop potential diamond mines in the central Indian state
of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional diamond mining area.
De Beers, the international diamond group, was among the bidders which made
presentations to the state government last week. The contract is likely to
be awarded later this month, and the successful bidder is expected to spend
Rs1.5bn (USDollars 48m) on the exploration and development of diamond
deposits.
Reliance, India's largest private sector company, has also bid for a
facility to produce methane gas from coal in Mehsana district, in Gujarat
state. The company will spend Rs150m for the initial exploration required,
if its bid is successful.
The Indian government recently liberalised the country's coal, gold and
other mining industries. They were formerly under the tight control of the
government.
Reliance's forays into mining follow its successful bid earlier this year to
develop three medium-sized oil and gas fields off India's west coast
together with Enron, the US power company. Reliance's 9m tonne crude
petroleum refinery is being set up in nearby Jamnagar at a cost of
Rs51.42bn, which was raised through an ambitious public issue last year.
Reliance also hopes to enter the recently liberalised Indian
telecommunications industry.
The company has proposed to the government that it will build and operate a
nationwide telecommunications network, providing 10m new telephone lines in
the next decade, rural telecoms services and public call offices.
The government is still in the process of finalising its telecoms policy.
Reliance yesterday declared its audited results for the year ended March 31
1994, saying it had established a record total income of Rs54.61bn. The
company reported a net profit of Rs5.75bn on sales of Rs53.45bn, compared
with last year's profit of Rs3.22bn on sales of Rs41.06bn.
A spokesman for the company said Reliance was now 'India's largest
corporation in terms of sales, operating profit, cash profit, net profit,
net worth and assets'.
The company's directors have recommended a dividend of 51 per cent for the
year, constituting a dividend payout of Rs1.39bn. The dividend, the largest
in the private sector, will be shared by the company's 2.4m shareholders in
India and abroad.
