   The De Beers diamond cartel said Wednesday it was
increasing prices for rough gemstones by an average of 13.5 percent
as worldwide sales sparkle despite last fall's stock market crash.
   Sales of diamonds, which are priced in dollars, have benefitted
from the drop in the U.S. currency, which makes them cheaper to
holders of Japanese yen and European currencies.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., a Johannesburg-based concern
which controls 80 percent of the world's rough diamond market
through its London-based marketing arm, Central Selling
Organization, said the price increases for a broad range of uncut
diamonds would take effect May 3.
   When De Beers last increased its prices, by an average 10
percent on Oct. 5, it boosted its prices for the better-quality
diamonds the most.
   But spokesman Richard Dickson said the latest increases ``are
not weighted toward any particular category.'' De Beers does not
disclose actual prices.
   The October price increase was the only price increase in 1987
and followed an increase of 14.5 percent in two stages in 1986.
   The wholesale price of a polished, one-carat, D-flawless diamond
_ the highest grade _ was more than $17,000 in April.
   The cartel, which sets prices for rough diamonds only, operates
a pipeline of diamonds from its mines in Africa and Australia to
dealers and cutters in the world's major diamond centers _ Antwerp,
Bombay, New York and Tel Aviv.
   ``The rough market is strong, the prices of polished diamonds
are strong, retail demand is good,'' Dickson said. ``Much of the
motor for the momentum behind demand is coming from Japan and
Southeast Asia.''
   De Beers reported record sales of $3.075 billion in 1987, up 23
percent from sales of $2.5 billion in 1986.
   Diamond sales, which slumped in the early 1980s, jumped even
though De Beers cut supply after the Oct. 19 stock market crash,
Dickson said.
   Jewelry sales generally were strong at Christmas, he said.
   ``The mood is optimistic and we would look forward to 1988 being
a good year,'' Dickson said. But he declined to provide a forecast.
   De Beers holds about 10 sales for international diamond dealers
a year, Dickson said.
   Most of the world's diamonds are industrial diamonds, used
primarily for drilling because they are so hard. Between 10 percent
and 20 percent are gems.
