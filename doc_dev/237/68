DE BEERS, the South African company that controls the world diamond market,
and the Namibian government are holding talks which could lead to the
government taking an equity stake in De Beers's Namibian subsidiary,
Consolidated Diamond Mines (CDM).
Such an arrangement would probably parallel arrangements in Botswana where
the government holds a stake in the company Debswana.
A joint statement from De Beers and the Namibian government said the talks
would concern their relationship and the future of the country's diamond
industry. Mining, and the diamond industry in particular, is an important
part of the Namibian economy.
The talks come after a week in which De Beers incurred the wrath of
investors by revising downwards prospects for the second half of the year.
It is not clear what the Namibian government will offer in return for an
equity stake, assuming it is not donated. In Botswana, new shares were
issued in exchange for De Beers gaining control of a diamond stockpile, but
Namibia has no equivalent stockpile.
