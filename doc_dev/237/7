forecast to have global impact

THE LAC de Gras area in Canada's Northwest Territories will be developed
into a diamond producer rivalling Botswana, the world's biggest producer of
gem diamonds in value terms, according to the Credit Lyonnais Laing
financial services group.
The area - or camp - as a whole might have the potential to add 20 per cent
to total world rough (uncut) diamonds production and one third to world gem
diamonds output, says analyst Mr Roger Chaplin in a special study of the Lac
de Gras phenomenon, which has seen 40,000 square km (16,000 square miles)
staked in the biggest rush for land seen in North America.
Mr Chaplin suggests that the first diamond-containing kimberlite pipe
drilled in the area - called the Point Lake pipe - is 'giving world-class
results and we estimate a value of approximately USDollars 2bn for this pipe
alone.
'There are many more pipes to be found, some of which are likely to exceed
the Point Lake pipe in size and grade,' he adds.
The study estimates that the Point Lake pipe may have reserves of more than
105m carats of diamonds and says a conservative estimate of production would
be about 3.5m carats a year, possibly expanding to 7m carats in time. 'These
reserves would have a gross in-situ value of about USDollars 9bn and could
generate revenues of at least Dollars 300m a year, growing to about Dollars
600m.'
Mr Chaplin points out: 'This is equivalent to a gold mine producing 800,000
to 1.7m ounces of gold a year - but far more profitable. To put the size of
the potential mine into perspective in the diamond industry, there are only
five diamond mines in the world which produce at more than 3m carats a year
and between them these major operations account for about 75 per cent of gem
diamonds production.'
He suggests that, although the share price of Dia Met Minerals, the Canadian
company that discovered Point Lake and is now backed by Broken Hill
Proprietary, Australia's biggest natural resources group, has risen by 2,000
per cent in the past year, if CLL assessment of the discovery is correct, it
is still undervalued.
Some other analysts are not so enthusiastic. Mr Rob Weinberg at the Societe
Generale Strauss Turnbull financial services group points out that Dia Met's
share price puts a value of Dollars 290m on its exploration properties,
which is equivalent to 36 per cent of Australia's Argyle mine. 'We can't
help feeling that that is somewhat excessive.' Argyle is producing about
33.6m carats of diamonds a year, of which about 1.7m are gem diamonds.
Others point out that, although there are more than 3,000 known kimberlite
deposits in the world, only 1,000 contain diamonds and only between 50 and
60 have ever proved economic.
