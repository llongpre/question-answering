diamond finds

ECHO BAY Mines, a medium-sized gold producer with four mines in Canada and
the US, says some claims it controls near last November's kimberlite find in
the Northwest Territories could also contain diamond 'pipes'.
The staking rush at Lac de Gras, 200 miles north of Yellowknife, the NWT
capital, now covers 13m acres and has reached Echo Bays' Lupin gold mine and
its 17,000-acre mining lease.
More test results are expected shortly from a 160-tonne bulk sample
extracted from the Dia Met/BHP-Utah property. On May 21 the joint venture of
Canada's Dia Met Minerals and Australia's BHP group reported indications of
90 carats of diamonds with 25 per cent potentially of gem quality.
Echo Bay held exploration leases just east of the discovery, said Mr Richard
Kraus, the company's president, after the annual meeting in Montreal. Also
the winter road connecting Yellowknife and the Lupin mine crossed Lac de
Gras near the discovery.
He said diamond exploration was very expensive and if Echo Bay wanted to
explore its claims further 'it would be done with partners'.
'We are helping other companies in the logistics of diamond exploration. I
can't say more because we are in registration with a USDollars 100m
convertible preferred issue.'
Echo Bay's four mines, including Lupin, produced 734,000 troy ounces of gold
and 5.6m ounces of silver last year. In the first quarter, it posted a small
loss because of low bullion prices but the company said it expected a
gradual recovery in the gold price to Dollars 360 to Dollars 375 an ounce by
the end of the year.
This, together with the new stock issue, would bolster cash flow and enable
debt to be reduced from the present Dollars 257m.
Mr Kraus said Russian sales had peaked and Asian prosperity was creating
excellent fundamentals for gold. Far East fabricated demand, mostly for
jewellery, was now three times North America's and world mine output was not
growing.
Echo Bay has cut manpower by 15 per cent to 1,934 without affecting output.
The Lupin mill's capacity will rise 15 per cent to 2,300 tonnes a day next
year. Other improvements are coming at the Nevada mines and another mine in
Washington State. Two Alaskan properties are ready to move ahead when gold
prices improve.
Exploration is focussed on the Northwest Territories, British Columbia,
Alaska, Washington State, Nevada and the western Rockies. In addition a
senior executive is examining possibilities in the former Soviet Union.
