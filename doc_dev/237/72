BHP Minerals has begun talks with the international diamond trade on ways to
market output from the Australian group's potential new mine in northern
Canada.
The discussions reinforce optimism that BHP and its Canadian partner, Dia
Met Minerals, will press ahead later this year with construction of a mine
in the Lac de Gras area, 300 km north-east of Yellowknife, capital of the
Northwest Territories.
Mr Hugo Dummett, BHP's director of exploration in North America, says that,
'if all goes according to schedule', the property could be in production by
1997.
Mr Dummett adds that BHP has held discussions 'with everyone in the
marketplace', including De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation,
which organises the cartel that controls the world rough (uncut)diamond
trade. He says, however, that so far 'no commitment has been made to
anybody'.
BHP says that it has assured other players that it recognises the delicate
balance of the market and that it will act 'responsibly' in marketing stones
from the Lac de Gras deposit. Analysts expect that at least a portion of the
mine's production will be channelled through the CSO.
A final decision on the mine and on the distribution of its production will
not be made until completion of a bulk-sampling programme, which is about to
get under way. BHP has imported a 10-tonne bulk-sampling plant from South
Africa and has set up a 112-person camp at the site. The plant will test at
least 8,500 tonnes of rock from at least two of the most promising
kimberlite pipes.
Mr John Lydall, analyst at First Marathon Securities in Toronto, predicts
that, based on exploration results from 15 of the 26 pipes discovered so
far, the Lac de Gras property could generate 'substantially' more cash flow
than even American Barrick's flagship Goldstrike gold mine in Nevada.
According to estimates by diamond appraisers in London and Antwerp, the
value of the most recent Lac de Gras samples equates to USDollars 140 per
tonne of mined material. Assuming mining and processing costs of about
Dollars 27.50 a tonne, Mr Lydall calculates a gross profit margin of some
Dollars 12.50 a tonne. This would translate into a pre-tax cash flow of
Dollars 1.7m a day from a mine with a daily throughput of 15,000 tonnes.
Mr John Hainey, analyst at Canaccord Capital in Toronto, tentatively
predicted in a recent report that four or five kimberlite pipes would be
developed at Lac de Gras.
