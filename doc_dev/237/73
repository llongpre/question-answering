   LONDON -- Diamond sales of De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd. "fell substantially" in the first quarter, Julian
Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said.
   Compared with the year-earlier period, first-quarter sales
slumped by a third to around $1 billion, De Beers officials
and dealers said.

   The downturn, which is a continuation of poor sales in the
second half of last year, was the result of weakening
economies and uncertainty during the Gulf conflict, Mr.
Ogilvie Thompson said.
   In the first three months of 1990, however, the sales
known as "sights" were unusually high, Mr. Ogilvie Thompson
said. Japanese dealers were then buying ahead of changes in
the turnover tax, he said. So the latest first-quarter
decline must be considered in perspective, he said at a
London press conference.
   Nevertheless, trade is slower at the main diamond centers
of Antwerp, Tel Aviv and Bombay, De Beers officials said. As
a result, De Beers, which controls 80% of the world's rough
uncut diamonds, is supporting the market by reducing amounts
of diamonds sold to the centers, they said.
   Last year, U.S. imports of rough and polished diamonds
fell to 7.5 million carats worth $3.9 billion from 10.2
million carats valued at $4.3 billion, said the American
Diamond Industry Association. The volume of sales fared worse
than value because of a slump in low-quality diamonds, mainly
supplied by India. A carat equals 1/142 of an ounce.
   Diamond markets in Europe and Japan were better than in
the U.S. last year, dealers said. But this year's surge of
the dollar has raised the price of diamonds in local
currencies, dealers said. Economies are also slowing down and
denting demand for luxury goods, they said.
   To counter the downturn in the market, De Beers's
marketing budget will be around $150 million this year, Mr.
Ogilvie Thompson said. The diamond jewelry trade will also be
spending around $30 million, De Beers officials said.
   Meanwhile, De Beers is anxious to preserve its diamond
cartel of producers in the present weak market, dealers say.
It recently negotiated a contract to sell three quarters of
Angola's production and is discussing new contracts with key
producers Botswana and Australia, they said.
   De Beers is expected to sell all of Botswana's output, Mr.
Ogilvie Thompson said. But negotiations with Australia will
continue for longer than expected, said Nicholas Oppenheimer,
a De Beers director. Australia wants to sell a much higher
proportion of its valuable gems independently on world
markets, dealers said.
