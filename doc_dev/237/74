RUSSIA HAS exported 30 tonnes of gold so far this year and its official
reserves now stand at a total of 210 tonnes, the chief of the republic's
co-ordinating body for precious stones and metals said yesterday.
Mr Yevgeny Bychkov said that 75 tonnes of the gold reserves were with the
Russian central bank, while the remaining 135 tonnes are being held by his
Committee for Precious Stones and Metals.
The latest reserve figure, dating from June 1, is lower than the 240 tonnes
figure (of January 1) given as the reserves of the whole Soviet Union before
the country collapsed in December 1991.
The decline in reserves has occurred because very little gold has been
extracted since the Soviet reserves were transferred to Russia (the Russian
gold mining season begins in May and ends in November) and 'we have had
expenses to cover in the mean time', Mr Bychkov explained.
He said figures for annual gold production remained confidential. But he
dismissed a forecast he attributed to Mr Valery Rudakov, head of the state
Rosalmazzoloto gold and diamond mining conglomerate, that production was
expected to fall by 30 per cent this year.
He also said that the gold needs of domestic industry (jewellery and
electronics) would total about 90 tonnes for this year.
The government had also committed itself to exporting at least 25 per cent
of gold production, so that it could pay producers some hard currency.
According to one western estimate, total gold production of the former
Soviet Union last year was 220 tonnes, and could fall to 200 tonnes in the
next three years.
Mr Bychkov admitted that a key priority was to attract investment into the
flagging gold industry, but suggested it was unlikely that an Australian
consortium called Star Technology Systems would be allowed to conclude a
deal making it the first foreign company to buy into a Russian gold mining
enterprise.
He said he had already held preliminary talks with international mining
companies, including RTZ and Newmont, on ways in which they could do
business in Russia.
He said the Sukhoi Log mine, Russia's largest proven hard rock gold deposit
and part of the state-owned Russian company Star wants to be buy into, would
most likely be put out to tender - a process that would take a long time.
Lenzoloto, the Russian enterprise in question, has said it needs money fast,
to keep up work already begun on this and other parts of its operations. Mr
Bychkov said the Russian state would give it Dollars 16m  - proceeds from
other gold sales - to keep going. 'It is a form of government help,' he
said.
Although copper is not part of his responsibilities, Mr Bychkov revealed
that Russia also planned soon to put out to international tender the
development of one of its biggest copper mines - at the Udokan site in
Siberia.
He said that the government also hoped that freeing the domestic price of
gold to a world level of Dollars 11 a gramme (Rbs85 according to the
official market exchange rate) would stimulate output.
That was the price the state would pay producers for their gold. But
unresolved difficulties remained.
One was how to support the self-employed brigades that undertook seasonal
mining but remained dependent on big state-owned enterprises for equipment.
Another was how to restructure the enterprises themselves.
Mr Bychkov, who was appointed to the head of the committee formed by
President Boris Yeltsin in November after he was cleared of wrong-doing in a
scandal over illicit diamond sales, said he remained dissatisfied with
Russia's partnership with De Beers' Central Selling Organisation.
A deal concluded between the CSO and the Soviet Union in July 1990 gave
Moscow a Dollars 1bn loan against future diamond deliveries.
The five-year agreement also gave De Beers the exclusive right to sell
Russian uncut (rough) diamonds on international markets.
Mr Bychkov said Russia had no alternative but to abide by the deal, but
suggested that it inhibited Russia from polishing more of its own stones.
He said Russia had both the know-how and the equipment to engage in the more
profitable activity of cutting its own diamonds, rather than exporting rough
stones. But even though nothing in the De Beers deal banned Russia from
trading in polished diamonds, it still lacked the marketing skills to do so
on any significant scale.
