KENNECOTT, THE North American subsidiary of Britain's RTZ, is the latest in
a growing list of leading mining companies to join a stampede for diamonds
in the remote Northwest Territories and Canada's prairie provinces.
Kennecott, whose activities in Canada consist mainly of joint ventures with
junior exploration companies, has teamed up with Aber Resources in the area
centred on Lac de Gras, about 350 km (220 miles) north-east of Yellowknife,
the territories' capital. In exchange for investing CDollars 10m (Pounds
4.3m) over the next five years, Kennecott has obtained a right to a 60pc
interest in the project.
The Canadian mining industry has been buzzing with rumours about a rich
diamond deposit since last November when Dia Met Minerals, another junior
company, announced that it had found some small stones under Lac de Gras.
BHP-Utah Mines, a subsidiary of BHP of Australia, has rights to a 51 per
cent interest in the Dia Met property.
Share prices of Dia Met, Aber and other companies involved in the hunt have
rocketed on the Toronto and Vancouver stock exchanges. Dia Met said in May
that a sample of 160 tonnes of ore yielded at least 90 carats of diamonds,
of which about a quarter appear to be of gem quality.
Mr Ed McLeod, mining recorder for the Department of Energy and Mines in
Yellowknife, said yesterday that sales of claim tags for the Lac de Gras
area increased sharply in May and June. A total of 4,243 claims covering
9.6m acres, or 15,000 square miles, were staked by July 15. Another 3,900
sets of tags, each entitling the holder to one claim, have been sold.
Mr John Stephenson, president of Kennecott Canada, said evaluation work was
still in a 'very early' stage. He said that RTZ might issue more details of
its work at Lac de Gras within the next few days.
Monopros, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of De Beers, is understood to
have expanded its presence in Canada in recent months as a result of the
activity in the Northwest Territories. An official of the company, which is
based in Toronto, said that it had just started a sampling programme - the
first stage of on-the-ground investigation - in the Lac de Gras area.
Exploration has also accelerated in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Besides
Monopros, the most active prospectors in Saskatchewan are Uranerz of Germany
and Cameco, the large Canadian uranium producer. The focus of their
attention is an area close to Prince Albert, in the centre of the province.
