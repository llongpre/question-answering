   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. will add two directors from Botswana and buy a diamond stockpile from the black African state, the company said. 

   De Beers, a South African company that controls 80% of the world diamond market, said it agreed to issue 20 million shares valued at about $225 million and to pay some additional cash to De Beers Botswana Mining Corp., jointly owned by the government of Botswana and De Beers Consolidated. 

   After the share issue, De Beers Botswana will own more than 5% of the South African concern's shares. 
In return, De Beers Consolidated will acquire a stockpile of diamonds built up by Botswana during a diamond-market depression from 1982 to 1985. 
De Beers wouldn't disclose the size of the cash payment or the diamond stockpile. 

   "We have had a relationship with Botswana for 20 years; we discovered the diamonds and helped manage the mines," said Gary Ralfe, a director of the Central Selling Organization, De Beers's London-based marketing division that controls the international market in rough diamonds. 
He wouldn't comment on any political implications of naming persons from the black African state to the De Beers board. 

   De Beers Botswana will choose the executives who will join the De Beers Consolidated board, Mr. Ralfe said.
