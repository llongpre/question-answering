De Beers tightened its grip on the global diamond market Wednesday with an 
exclusive five-year deal to sell the Soviet Union's rough diamond output, which 
could total more than $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The financially strained Soviet Union, among the world's biggest gem diamond 
producers, will get a $1-billion advance against future diamond sales. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers' London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, will 
strengthen its position as the world's dominant diamond seller. It already 
markets 80% of global rough diamond production of some 100 million carats. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets do not disclose their output. 
</P>
<P>
The nation reached the deal because it wanted to sell a huge stockpile of 
diamonds without disrupting the stable world diamond market, De Beers said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union had refused to deal directly with the South African-based 
company because of its home country's policies of racial separation, but now is 
willing to do business openly with De Beers' new Swiss arm, De Beers Centenary 
AG. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. established the publicly held Swiss company in 
May to head the non-South African businesses of De Beers, which is controlled 
by the wealthy Oppenheimer family of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers Centenary said in a statement released in Lucerne, Switzerland, and 
made available in London that it reached the agreement with Glavalmazzoloto of 
the Soviet Union for the exclusive export and sale of the U.S.S.R. diamond 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Glavalmazzoloto is the main administration for precious metals and diamonds 
under the Soviet Union's council of ministers, De Beers said. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers' Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Centenary Holdings SA, has agreed to 
advance Glavalmazzoloto $1 billion against future diamond deliveries. Repayment 
would be made over five years beginning in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet diamond stockpile will be held at De Beers' marketing arm as 
collateral for the advance, De Beers said.
