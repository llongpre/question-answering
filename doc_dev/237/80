   Mining Company Sees
   Dollars in the Brown

   AN AUSTRALIAN diamond mining company hopes it can turn a
glut of brown diamonds into more green.
   The brown stones, often found in the same deposits as
clear ones, traditionally have generated little consumer
demand because they don't fit the popular image of diamonds.
But Argyle Diamonds is trying to change that, calling the
brown gems "champagne" and "cognac" in a new marketing
campaign. "We're trying to make a virtue of color," says
David Karpin, managing director.
   Argyle's mines produce more than a third of the world's
diamonds, but 40% of its gem-quality stones are brown. It
will spend $5 million this year on its marketing campaign,
with trade ads already running and consumer ads scheduled to
start in West Coast test markets this summer.
   But the effort is likely to meet resistance at the retail
level. Few stores handle brown diamonds, and the industry,
made up of single stores and small chains, tends to be
tradition-bound.
   Argyle also may have to negotiate some mine fields at De
Beers Consolidated Mines, the huge diamond cartel that buys
most of the world's diamond production -- including much of
Argyle's. De Beers says it looks on Argyle's brown push as
"complementing our efforts." But some industry people say De
Beers fears the Argyle effort may cannibalize sales of
colorless diamonds.
   Mr. Karpin says Argyle aims to expand rather than shift
diamond sales. He adds that it won't use brown diamonds for
engagement rings, long a De Beers mainstay, because of
tradition.
                                                                                                       

   Public Broadcasting Has
   Firm Corporate Funding
                                                                                                       

   DESPITE the recession, corporate support for public
broadcasting is surprisingly firm. But fund raisers are
working harder.
   Many big companies, including Primerica and RJR Nabisco's
Nabisco Brands subsidiary, recently committed to substantial
new underwriting projects. Ford Motor and General Electric,
both longtime supporters, say their contributions have edged
up. Few companies have cut back support, say public
broadcasting officials.
   "We're holding our own," says Lance Ozier, director of
national underwriting and program marketing of WGBH-TV in
Boston.
   But public broadcasting fund raisers have had to become
more aggressive, throwing in parties as well as book and
video deals to spur underwriters to sign up. "It used to be
you'd get contributions out of philanthropy," says Chris
Oshikata, director of marketing and communications at
Minnesota Public Radio. "Now you have to be accountable on
everything."
   The length of most underwriting commitments -- often two
to three years -- also may be a reason for public
broadcasting's stability. Unlike ad spending, underwriting
"isn't a spigot that turns off," says Karl Koss, a consultant
to independent TV producers and former GE advertising
manager.
   Still, the broadcasters will find it tough to match the
banner year they had in 1990. Public Broadcasting Service saw
corporate support of programming rise 10% in the fiscal year
ended in June. National Public Radio, making a 20th
anniversary pitch, saw underwriting more than double in the
year ended last September.
                                                                                                       

   Removing Financial Risk
   May Not Boost Sales
                                                                                                       

   MARKETERS of big-ticket items try money-back guarantees to
coax reluctant buyers off the fence, but results have been
mixed.
   Over the past year, some car makers, including Volkswagen
and General Motors' new Saturn line, have introduced such
guarantees, offering to take cars back with virtually no
questions asked. Deere &amp; Co., which began a 30-day guarantee
for its walk-behind lawn mowers in 1988, recently added
riding mowers and garden tractors to the program.
   Now Boston Whaler, a maker of power boats, is offering its
own version. The firm, a unit of Reebok International, will
pay 20% over book value for boats up to two years after the
sale. That should let buyers get back nearly everything they
pay, says Paul Birbarie, a boat dealer in Branford, Conn.
   Such programs help convey a sense of quality, especially
for a new line like Saturn, which lacks a track record. "It
helps consumers pass that last obstacle: What if something
happens to me in the future?" says Barry Culkin, president of
Boston Whaler.
   But the guarantees also can be expensive: Return rates
range as high as 3.5%, and returned items can't be resold as
new. And the buyers such guarantees attract aren't always
legitimate. "We've had some cases where we're convinced they
took a 30-day joy ride," a Saturn spokesman says.
   Volkswagen, which began offering a 30-day-or-3,000-mile
guarantee last August on its Passat model, ran the program
for only three months and has no plans to conduct it again.
The guarantee boosted recognition of the car, but most buyers
who kept the cars would have bought them anyway, a
spokeswoman says. "The guarantee didn't really swing any
other needles."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   HILLS Bros. plans a national rollout next week of Perfect
