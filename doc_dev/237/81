A long-awaited report from the Dia Met/BHP joint venture has added
credibility to the diamond-staking rush in Canada's North West Territories.
BHP Minerals of Australia, which is managing and financing exploration for
the joint venture, says further drillcore testing indicates potential
diamond-bearing kimberlites beyond its original Point Lake find in the Lac
de Gras area, north of Yellowknife.
The Dia Met/BHP report was the first since Dia Met was listed on the Toronto
Stock Exchange on November 9.
The report covered results from restricted core and surface samples from
nine new kimberlite 'pipes' located last summer. It said 500 diamonds found
in the samples included 22.5 per cent over 0.5mm diameter and the rest micro
diamonds of smaller diameter. A bulk test of two more pipes is planned this
winter.
'This will give carats per 100 tonnes and an indication of gem quality,'
said David James, mining analyst with Richardson Greenshields Canada in
Winnipeg.
The Point Lake bulk tests returned 101 carats from 160 tonnes of kimberlite
sample material.
BHP warned again that there is a long way to go before the deposits could be
proved commercial.
