A CANADIAN-AUSTRALIAN joint venture has confirmed the scope of last
November's diamond find 200 miles north of Yellowknife, the Northwest
Territories' capital.
The kimberlite find by Dia Met/BHP Minerals started the biggest Canadian
staking rush since the Hemlo gold discoveries in northern Ontario in the
1970s.
Dia Met said further US tests of a bulk sample of Point Lake kimberlite
showed the weight of the tiny diamonds recovered was 101 carats, compared
with 90 carats reported on May 20, and that about a quarter were gem
quality.
Dia Met emphasised that the 160-tonne rock sample was small and much more
exploration was needed. BHP, the Australian mining group, is the operator of
the Point Lake exploration programme.
