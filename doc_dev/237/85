INCONCLUSIVE SURVEY STALLS PLAN FOR MINE

Federal officials say a controversial plan to operate an open pit mine in 
exclusive Sand Canyon has been left in limbo because land surveys could not 
determine whether Eureka Consolidated Development has a right to mine the site. 
</P>
<P>
Federal surveyors failed to establish whether a proposed iron silicate ore mine 
is within an area of Angeles National Forest where mining is allowed, said 
Richard Borden, a special projects coordinator for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
Eureka Consolidated staked its claim to the proposed Black Diamond Mine under 
an 1872 federal mining law that allows prospecting on some public lands. But 
the area's rugged terrain -- plus confusing maps from the 1890s -- have made it 
impossible to determine whether the proposed Black Diamond Mine lies within 
legal mining territory. 
</P>
<P>
The questions raised by the surveys prompted the Forest Service to halt work on 
an environmental impact report, Borden said. Resolving the questions would 
require a $200,000 land survey, but "we don't have the money to do that work," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Forest Service spent $15,000 for a survey in December and January, but that 
effort only raised the questions that now perplex the agency, Borden said. 
Although the 1872 law allows mining in national forests, Congress declared 
portions of Angeles National Forest off limits to miners in 1928, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Borden said, is tracking down the boundary line drawn by Congress. 
"Nobody knows where that line is," he said. The proposed mine is about four 
miles south and one-quarter of a mile east of the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancies in the boundary lines were discovered more than a year ago 
when four Sand Canyon homeowners near the proposed mine became embroiled in a 
property dispute. The dispute came to the attention of Minebusters, a 
homeowners' group, which raised the issue last July when it submitted 55 points 
challenging a draft of the environmental impact report prepared by the Forest 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
Minebusters has not declared victory in its fight, but group leader Mike 
Levison said the inconsistent surveys "pretty much eliminate the prospect of a 
mine there in the immediate future." 
</P>
<P>
But in a June 22 letter, Eureka Consolidated asked the federal Bureau of Land 
Management to survey the proposed mine site. Barbara Maxfield, a bureau 
spokes-woman, said the agency had not yet reviewed the request. A final 
decision will be made by the bureau's state director, Ed Hastey, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Levison said the bureau should not use public funds to promote a private 
venture. "There must be something more important on their agenda than to 
justify a questionable mining claim," he said. If Eureka is serious about 
mining in Sand Canyon, he said, the company should offer to pay for the survey. 
</P>
<P>
George Warsaw, company president, said that Eureka is still committed to the 
Black Diamond Mine and that the survey problem could be resolved soon. "I don't 
imagine it'll take too long," Warsaw said. He refused to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Minebusters, which has fought the mine for six years, claims that crushers used 
to grind ore into small chunks would disrupt the quiet of the secluded canyon. 
Sand Canyon is considered Santa Clarita's most exclusive area, dotted with 
Tudor-style estates and Arabian horse ranches.

of area was voted off limits in 1928. MATT MOODY / Los Angeles Times
