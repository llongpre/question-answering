<HEAD>Minorco Wins A Majority Stake In Gold Fields, Has Another 21 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Minorco SA said Wednesday enough shareholders have
accepted its hostile $6 billion bid for Consolidated Gold Fields
PLC to give the South African-controlled bidder a majority stake
and another three weeks to proceed with the offer.
   If it hadn't won the majority stake, Minorco's offer, the
equivalent of 3.5 billion pounds, would have expired at 1 p.m.
Wednesday.
   ``We are naturally pleased at the market's judgement and will
now consider very carefully what action to take,'' said Chairman
Sir Michael Edwardes said.
   Gold Fields Chairman Rudolph Agnew responded, ``We don't believe
that it is in the interests of Gold Fields and its shareholders for
Minorco to gain control. We don't intend to be swayed from our
responsibilities by the bully-boy tactics of Minorco.''
   The takeover of the British gold mining giant would be Britain's
largest corporate acquisition ever. The battle has been a
protracted and expensive one.
   Minorco, the Luxembourg-based investment arm of the South
African Oppenheimer family's gold and diamond mining interests,
said it had counted acceptances from holders of 53.21 million Gold
Fields shares, representing 24.9 percent of all Gold Fields' stock.
   Together with the nearly 30 percent already owned by Minorco,
the acceptances bring its stake to 54.84 percent, or 117.16 million
shares.
   That means that under British takeover regulations, Minorco now
has 21 days to clear up any other outstanding conditions on the bid.
   Principal among these is the lifting of a preliminary injunction
issued by a U.S. court that bars Minorco from purchasing more than
30 percent of Gold Fields shares.
   On Monday, the U.S. court refused to lift the injunction, which
arose from an antitrust suit.
   ``The (U.S. antitrust) litigation will proceed to a full
trial,'' Agnew said Wednesday.
   Minorco has twice sweetened its offer since it first launched it
in September. It currently is offering half a Minorco share and
11.75 pounds in cash for every Gold Fields share.
   Gold Fields has fought the offer vigorously, offering its
shareholders a special dividend if it doesn't meet it own earnings
targets. It has raised concerns about the concentration of control
over the world's gold supplies and potential harmful effects to
Gold Fields from being owned by a South African-controlled company.
   Minorco is 60 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. and De Beers
Consolidated Mines Ltd., the Oppenheimers' gold and diamond mining
giants.
