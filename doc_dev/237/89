FT  19 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Taking the heat out of diamond
fever - The Australian Stock Exchange's new code for reporting discoveries

Diamonds, always a girl's best friend, have in recent months also become a
stock market speculator's dream. So much so that the Australian Stock
Exchange has quietly adopted a new reporting code for diamond exploration
results, mineral resources and ore reserves.
This has been devised by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee - a
standard-setting body formed in the nickel boom days of the early-1970s and
backed by the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the Australian
Mining Industry Council, and the Australian Institute of Geoscientists.
The code, says the committee, represents the first time anyone has attempted
to standardise the way in which diamond discoveries should be reported and
ensure that investors are given a reasonable idea of the commercial
significance of exploration results. The problem is simple: diamonds, by
their nature, are easy to find, but discovering a large-scale,
economically-viable diamond resource is another matter entirely.
'To the best of my knowledge, it's also the first time such a standard has
been adopted by a stock exchange,' adds Mr Ray Schoer, director of
operations at the ASX. The Australian exchange, however, may not be out on a
limb for long: the JORC reports inquiries and requests for copies of the
code from both the US and Canada, where a diamond rush has been under way
for a couple of years.
Laudable though the initiative may be, it comes not a moment too soon. Two
recent incidents in Australia have demonstrated all-too-clearly the
volatility which can surround diamond-related stocks.
The first was Great Central Mines, a Melbourne-based exploration business
whose shares jumped from around the ADollars 7 to as much as Dollars 19 last
spring, capitalising the loss-making company at a staggering ADollars
1bn-plus.
That performance was influenced by a discovery of 'microdiamonds' in the
Greater Nabberu region of Western Australia, which GCM's chairman and
managing director, Mr Joseph Gutnick, described as 'significant' but was
judged uneconomic by the company's joint venture partner, Stockdale
Prospecting, a subsidiary of De Beers, the South African mining house.
Today the twinkle has faded. GCM's shares are back in the ADollars
9.50-Dollars 10 range, despite some institutional support in the wake of a
rather more substantial gold discovery.
The second instance of runaway diamond shares occured only last month, and
concerned Cambridge Gulf Exploration, a stockmarket newcomer. Cambridge
shares, which had been issued at 25 cents in July, surged above ADollars 4
in mid-December on news that the company had found diamonds in the Bonaparte
Gulf, off Western Australia. When Cambridge released the details of this
discovery - stemming from a small sample of sea-bed gravel - the ASX
demanded more information about the sampling methods, the location of the
discovery, and so on. Today, the shares are trading at about ADollars 2.20.
But, while GCM and Cambridge have grabbed the headlines, one JORC member
says that the lack of guidelines on diamond-related reporting was a much
more fundamental problem. 'GCM and Cambridge were just a manifestations of
the fact that diamonds were becoming hot news. But a dozen other companies,
perfectly straightforward, were also unsure how to present their results'.
In essence, the new code aims to ensure that anyone reporting diamond
exploration results gives investors some clues as to the commercial
significance of the find. It carries a cautionary note, for example, stating
that diamond valuations 'have only been considered reliable on parcels of at
least 2,000 carats of diamonds from a single deposit'. 'Valuations placed on
a small number of diamonds from exploration samples become meaningless and
are likely to be misleading,' it continues.
The code goes on to require details of the professional valuation experience
of anyone reporting on a parcel of diamonds; to set out sampling information
required; to insist that reports of indicator minerals be prepared 'by a
suitably qualified person; and formally to define 'microdiamonds' as those
being less than 0.4mm in size and weighing less than 0.001 carats.
'By definition, pre-resource mineralisation must be considered to be
mineralisation of significance,' states the code. 'The occurence of
individual diamonds or microdiamonds in surficial desposits or from
inadequately-sized samples from a primary or secondary rock source would not
usually qualify as pre-resource mineralisation'. In short, while the outback
may glitter, that, in itself, does not mean anything of substance.
For all practical purposes, says Mr Schoer, the new strictures come into
effect immediately. Existing listing rules demand that the market be kept
informed. So, citing this broad requirement, the ASX will require
exploration companies to meet the best practice levels set down in the code.
Analysts are generally grateful. 'I think it will be a great help to
investors,' says Mr David Kauler at Pru-Bache, for example. 'I think it is
fair to say that there is a problem in industry reporting, especially with
the junior explorers. This will go a long way to improving the quality of
the results.'
