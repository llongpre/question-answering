BHP MINERALS of Australia and its Canadian partner, Dia Met Minerals, are
expanding their operations in Canada's Northwest Territories amid growing
indications that they have discovered one of the world's richest diamond
deposits.
The two companies say that they have decided to build a bulk-sampling plant
and a camp capable of housing 110 people on their prospecting claims in the
Lac de Gras area, 310km (190 miles) north-east of Yellowknife.
An underground working area is also under construction at the site to
extract samples from one of two especially promising kimberlite pipes -
kimberlite is the dark, usually blue, soil in which diamonds are found. The
plant will test samples of between 3,500 and 5,000 tonnes from each of the
two pipes.
Investors responded enthusiastically to the latest test results released by
BHP and Dia Met.
Dia Met's share price soared CDollars 6.50 in early trading on the Toronto
stock exchange yesterday to CDollars 53.50 (Pounds 26). Share prices of
other companies involved in the Northwest Territories diamond rush also
climbed sharply.
Analysts at Pacific International Securities of Vancouver said in a report
yesterday that it was confident Canada would become a major diamond
producer, and that the Lac de Gras property would remain in production for
'many decades'.
BHP and Dia Met say that they have discovered a total of 26 kimberlite pipes
in the Lac de Gras area. Based on valuations by diamond specialists in
Antwerp and London, stones discovered in three of the pipes have a value of
between USDollars 81 and Dollars 112 a carat. According to Pacific
International, gem diamonds recovered from the Jwaneng mine in Botswana, the
biggest producer of gem quality diamonds, have an average value of about
Dollars 100 a carat.
One of the Lac de Gras pipes yielded 62.11 carats from a sample of 49.8
tonnes, with 31 per cent of the stones identified as being of gem quality. A
sample of 80.5 tonnes from another pipe yielded 40 diamonds with a diameter
of more than 1mm, among which was one colourless stone measuring more than
2mm.
