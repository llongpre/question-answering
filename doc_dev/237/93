Anglo American, South Africa's largest mining and financial group, is to
unbundle Johannesburg Consolidated Investment, an associate mining house
with a market capitalisation of R13bn (Dollars 371m), in a move which could
give black business a significant stake in the country's mining and
industrial sectors.
JCI said that it envisioned one company holding the group's platinum
interests, which include Rustenburg Platinum Holdings, the world's largest
producer.
A second company will be formed to hold JCI's other mining and minerals
interests, which include gold, coal, diamonds and base metals. JCI controls
several large gold mines in South Africa. It also has an interest in diamond
group De Beers Consolidated.
The third group will include JCI's industrial interests, including shares in
food group Premier and UK-based catalyst producer Johnson Matthey.
JCI said it would list the shares in all three companies separately. 'Key
objectives of the exercise include enhanced share value and the creation of
a platform for the future introduction of black business interests into
South Africa's mining and industrial sectors,' the group said.
'Anglo and JCI are strongly of the opinion that black South Africans should
be given every encouragement to participate meaningfully in mining and
industrial finance groups,' it added.
The flotation of the mining and industrial interests could prove a platform
for the black community's involvement in those sectors.
It is understood that overseas or local institutions could invest in more
than one black business consortium, which would acquire control of JCI's
mining and industrial interests. Anglo, meanwhile, would retain the group's
platinum mining and diamond trading operations.
Companies in the Anglo fold have recently been in the forefront of moves to
widen black business ownership. Last month, Southern Life, the group's
listed life assurer, disposed of its insurance subsidiary African Life to a
consortium of black businessmen in a R160m (Dollars 38m) transaction.
