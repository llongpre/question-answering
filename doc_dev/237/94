Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, and its Canadian
partner, Dia-Met Minerals said yesterday that they were expanding the scope
of their proposed diamond mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, writes
Nikki Tait.
The companies said that an updated project development plan, submitted to
the Canadian government, had been enlarged to five diamondiferous kimberlite
pipes, instead of the three previously suggested. With the inclusion of the
two extra pipes, the potential project life could be extended from 20 years
to 25 years.
If project approvals are granted next year, the first production could occur
in 1997. BHP said that initial production would be at 9,000 tonnes of
kimberlite per day, rising to 18,000 tonnes per day by the 10th year of
production.
