TWO French banks, Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, have invested
CDollars 13m (USDollars 10.4m) in Dia-Met Minerals, a British Columbia
company which is at the centre of a stampede for diamonds in Canada's
Northwest Territories.
The banks have bought 350,000 Dia-Met shares, equal to 3.5 per cent of the
total outstanding, in a private placement priced at CDollars 39 a share.
The deal was put together by First Marathon Securities of Toronto. Dia-Met's
share price has soared in the past year from less than CDollars 5 to a peak
of CDollars 60 in the wake of its discovery of diamonds in the Lac de Gras
area, 350km north-east of Yellowknife.
The company said last May that a sample of 160 tonnes of ore had yielded at
least 90 carats of diamonds, of which about a quarter appeared to be of gem
quality. BHP, the Australian mining group, has rights to a majority interest
in the Dia-Met property. De Beers and Kennecott, the North American
subsidiary of Britain's RTZ, are among numerous other companies which have
joined the diamond stampede, in which a total of about 23m acres has been
staked.
Mr John Lydall, First Marathon's mining analyst, said in a report that
exploration was still at an early stage and 'a huge amount' of work remained
to be done. He said 'this entire exploration play remains an opportunity for
prudent speculation'.
