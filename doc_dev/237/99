   Inco Ltd., the Western world's largest producer of nickel,
plans to enter the diamond business by purchasing a stake in
a mine from the government of Ghana.
   The operation, known as Ghana Consolidated Diamonds Ltd.,
would be owned 20% by the government and 40% each by
Toronto-based Inco and its joint venture partner, Lazare
Kaplan International Inc., a New York-based diamond merchant.

   With an initial investment by the two private partners
estimated at $20 million, Inco said annual production at the
neglected mine could be expanded within seven years to about
500,000 carats of mainly industrial diamonds, from about
150,000 carats currently. Output eventually would reach one
million carats a year, Inco said. The mine currently has
reserves of 11 million carats.
   Lazare Kaplan estimated a carat from the mine would fetch
about $40 on world diamond markets.
   The transaction, subject to a final agreement with the
Ghanaian government, is expected to close in about a year.
