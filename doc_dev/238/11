   The defunct U.S. Football League lost an appeal of the jury verdict in its antitrust suit against the National Football League. 

   The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a July 1986 jury verdict that found the NFL had a monopoly on professional football in the U.S. 
But the jury awarded the USFL only $1 in damages, concluding the older league hadn't monopolized fall football telecasts and hadn't pressured major TV networks to refuse to offer the new league a fall contract. 

   Under federal antitrust law, the damages were trebled to $3. 

   The USFL had sought either a new trial or a new look at the damage claim. 
But the appeals court said evidence was "ample" that the USFL didn't make "the painstaking investment and patient efforts that bring credibility, stability and public recognition to a sports league." 

   The panel noted that various USFL moves "eroded fan loyalty and reduced the value of USFL games to television," ending "by its own hand any chance of a network contract." 

   The USFL folded in mid-1985 after losses of more than $200 million over three seasons. 
The suit accusing the NFL of predatory tactics was filed in October 1984. 

   Harvey D. Myerson, attorney for the USFL, couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Robert B. Fiske Jr., counsel for the NFL, said the decision "confirms what has been our basic position from the outset: that the USFL's problems were caused by its own mismanagement, not by any misconduct by the NFL."
