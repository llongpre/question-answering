   A federal judge rejected the U.S. Football League's effort to carve out a niche on network television, thus closing the books on the initial trial phase of the league's $1.69 billion antitrust suit against the National Football League. 

   The USFL, which received only $1 in damages in the trial, had filed a motion for injunctive relief based on the jury's finding that the NFL monopolizes professional football in the U.S. 
A motion for a new trial also was denied. 

   But in his ruling, Judge Peter K. Leisure noted that the jury's monopoly finding was limited strictly to the market for professional football; the six-person jury specifically ruled that the NFL didn't monopolize the TV market. 

   Harry Usher, USFL commissioner, said the league will appeal the case. 
That appeal would focus, he said, on what he charged were Judge Leisure's "confusing and erroneous" instructions to the jury, his pre-trial rulings, which Mr. Usher said narrowed the case, and on the judge's refusal to grant injunctive relief despite the jury's finding that the NFL was a monopoly. 

   In its request for injunctive relief, the USFL proposed three different plans that in effect would have limited the NFL to two of the three major commercial networks; the league currently has contracts with all three. 

   The USFL suspended operations in early August after the jury's initial ruling.
