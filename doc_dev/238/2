   Oregon doesn't have a National Football League
team, but it may soon become the only state in the nation to offer a
lottery game based on the point spreads of NFL games.
   NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle is threatening legal action, saying
such a betting game would harm the integrity of professional
football.
   Boosters of the game say it would tap a new audience for the
Oregon Lottery and could be used to raise money for college sports
programs.
   Gov. Neil Goldschmidt initially said he shared Rozelle's concerns
about the game, which for a $1 investment would allow players to
predict the outcome of some or all of the 14 weekly NFL games
against the point spread.
   This week, however, Goldschmidt said that after discussing the
game with lottery officials he's warming up to the idea.
   ``I'm not saying I would prefer to do what it is they're
proposing, but my comfort level is slightly higher than it was,''
the governor said at a news conference Tuesday.
   Goldschmidt has said he supports a bill pending in the
Legislature calling on the lottery to create a new game to generate
up to $9 million a year for Oregon intercollegiate sports. In
general, proceeds from the Oregon Lottery are used for economic
development programs, which can ben anything from a current prison
construction program to local sewer improvements.
   Oregon Lottery Director Jim Davey hopes to use the NFL betting
game for the college sports fund, although he's drawing up a list of
possible alternatives.
   New games must be approved by the five-member Lottery Commission,
which can act without the governor's approval although the members
and Davey are appointed by the governor and serve at his pleasure.
   The commission members are considering meeting in the next two
weeks and have said they support the proposal. Chairman Debbs Potts
said earlier this week that he hoped the commission would approve
the game.
   Under the lottery's proposal, players would try to predict the
outcome of four to 14 games against the point spreads set by Nevada
casino oddsmakers. The more games they bet, the more money they
could win, from about $8 for a perfect four-game card to about
$8,000 for a perfect 14-game card.
   Though Oregon's lottery is small by national standards _ $150
million in annual sales _ the football betting game proposal is
viewed by the NFL ``with genuine alarm,'' Rozelle said in a recent
letter to Goldschmidt.
   The NFL chief said linking a lottery game to the outcome of NFL
games would jeopardize the public's confidence that every player was
doing his best and that referees were calling plays as they see them.
   ``It could change the fundamental character of fan interest in
the game,'' League spokesman Jim Heffernan said in a telephone
interview from NFL headquarters in New York. ``They would not be
concerned about who won the games but by how many points a team
wins.''
   Davey said people already bet millions of dollars each year on
NFL games, whether legally in Nevada or through bookies and office
pools elsewhere.
   ``It's already happening, and all we're doing is tapping into
that market,'' the lottery director said.
   Heffernan argues, however, that there's no comparison between the
long-established legalized gambling in Nevada and proposals
elsewhere to base lotteries on NFL games.
   ``It's already on the books in Nevada,'' he said. ``The National
Football League can't repeal a law in Nevada. But certainly, with
something that's not on the books, we can voice our opinion.'
   The league might sue Oregon if the state goes ahead with a
football lottery game, Heffernan said.
   The league took the state of Delaware to court when that state
tried a football betting game. But the lawsuit became moot after
Delaware gave up its game after one season in 1974 because it lost
money.
