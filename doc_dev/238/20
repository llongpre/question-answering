<LEADPARA>  The World League of American Football is about to embark on a mission:;    "To
globalize American football and export it worldwide," said Mike Lynn,
president of the WLAF and former general manager of the Minnesota Vikings. "We
plan to go anywhere we can develop a market."  </LEADPARA>

WLAF KICKS OFF SEASON SATURDAY  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>      This global takeover, intended to spread the joy of the forward pass and
nickel defense to the far corners of the earth, begins Saturday. The league
opens its 10-game season in limited fashion, beginning in six U.S. markets,
Montreal and three European cities: Barcelona, Spain; Frankfurt, Germany; and
London.;     Not surprisingly, the birth of yet another football league has
been greeted with a healthy dose of skepticism. After all, the last
professional football ventures -- the USFL (1983-85) and the World Football
League (1974-75) -- went down in flames.;  THE 'WORST YEAR' TO START SINCE
1945;  And given the economic and political climate, there's plenty of reason
to question why this one will succeed.;     Even the optimistic Lynn concedes
that the timing of the league's debut is problematic.;     "We picked the
worst year since 1945 to start a new international sports league, not only in
terms of economic conditions, but in terms of the Persian Gulf war," Lynn said
from the WLAF offices in New York.;     But unlike other recent football
ventures, this league has the support and financial backing of the NFL, which
could profit greatly from worldwide interest in football.;     And unlike
leagues in the past, the WLAF has a strict cap on salaries. Contracts are
signed with the league, rather than with teams, to prevent the salary wars
that plagued the USFL.;  League has control; over player salaries; "New
leagues have failed because of economic reasons," Lynn said. "The single
biggest reason they fail is that their expenses are greater than their income.
But we have control as a league over what owners can pay in salaries, and we
will not pay more than we take in.";     Though the league has the support of
the NFL and is intended to help develop an international market as well as
potential expansion sites in the United States, Lynn said the WLAF is not
designed to be a developmental league for the NFL in terms of players.;     "I
think we're going to develop our own stars," Lynn said. "And we're going to
develop an athlete that can play in our league but may not be able in the
NFL.";     WLAF rules will differ from the NFL's, including a 35-second clock
and radio transmitters linking quarterbacks and coaches, making the no-huddle
offense a prominent feature. Several other rules will be implemented not only
to keep the game entertaining for new fans, but also to keep the length of
games under three hours.;  Expansion could; occur next year; Lynn said the
league is prepared to expand as soon as next year, but the initial goal is to
establish 10 solid teams. The next 2 1/2 months will determine how sound the
league is.;     Lynn said the Persian Gulf war -- now that it is over -- might
actually help the WLAF get off the ground.;     "There is a high euphoria and
a desire for things American," he said. "In Europe, America has never been
more popular.";    But whether that means that Americans in helmets and pads
-- rather than combat fatigues -- will be welcomed abroad remains to be seen.  </TEXT>
