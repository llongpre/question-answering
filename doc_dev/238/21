<LEADPARA>  In Europe, Joe Montana thought he would enjoy a brief hiatus from the
autograph-seekers, gawkers and clamorous fans who intrude upon his daily life
in the United States.;    The NFL is doing all it can to ensure that he won't.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I thought I would find some peace," said Montana, whose respite from
attention was short-lived. Every afternoon when he steps off the gargantuan
practice field next to Berlin's Olympic Stadium, the people start running
after the 49ers' quarterback, whose stardom transcends the time zones.;   
"Everyone, they know Montana, they know of 49ers," says Roland Gebauer, 22,
one of the 500 or so Berliners who watched the 49ers practice Thursday against
the Chicago Bears.;    "Forty-Niners rule!" a group of German schoolboys
scream, waving a banner as the players trot by. "Rice rules!" Wide receiver
Jerry Rice can't escape it, either.;    All over Berlin, NFL shirts, jackets,
caps, footballs and helmets are displayed in storefronts, part of the almost
$10 million the league expects such licensed products to bring in this year
from overseas.;    Out at the field, the selling is more subliminal, but just
as effective.;    The week of practices leading up to Saturday's American Bowl
exhibition game between the 49ers and Bears is open to the public. An
NFL-sponsored clinic is open to German coaches eager to brush up on
techniques.;    And the game itself, the NFL hopes, is an open door to
perpetuating the aura of American football in Europe and across the world.;   
"I think all of us would like to see this become the No. 1 international
sport," says newly appointed NFL President Neil Austrian, a New York
investment banker who knows what it takes to make money in these economically
troubled times.;    Go global.;    This preseason, as it has since 1983, the
NFL is doing just that, staging exhibition games and bringing its headliners
to Berlin, Tokyo and London's Wembley Stadium, where American Bowl contests
have been played every year since 1986.;    Feeding an appetite;  Enormously
successful, the games exploit the NFL's inherent panache, bringing that image
to countries hungry to embrace all that is American.;    While the
introduction this year of the NFL-sponsored World League of American Football
has helped bring the game overseas, the American Bowls are what bring out the
stars -- and capture the imagination.;    "Baseball is not the American
pastime -- professional football is," Austrian says. "It has star quality.";  
 And this is all part of a grand plan to expose the most American of sports to
a world that, for the most part, thinks of a football as round, not oblong.;  
 Where does it begin?;    On television, of course. Thanks to years of
satellite broadcasts of NFL game highlights, German youngsters see Montana and
Rice, Fridge, Marino and Elway. They are awestruck by the size and strength of
defensive linemen, the speed of wide receivers, the explosiveness of running
backs.;    "They are the greatest athletes in the world," says Frank Stahnke,
23, considered by many to be the greatest wide receiver in Germany, where club
football is rapidly gaining fans.;    First organized in 1979, prestigious
Division I league football in Germany has 15 semi-professional teams in two
groups, with such names as the Cologne Crocodiles, Monheim Sharks and Bad
Homburg Falken.;    Naturally, the exposure-hungry NFL was the catalyst.;   
Stahnke, the star of Berlin Adler, winner of two consecutive German Super Bowl
titles and well on its way to its third, remembers stuffing socks in the
shoulders of his shirt and sprinting with a rugby ball when he was 5,
emulating the NFL stars he saw on TV.;    Development programs; He and
teammate Roman Motzkus, 22, came up through Berlin Adler's development program
as 16-year-olds. Linebacker Jorg Opulchlik, 27, answered an ad in a store
window for players. David Spencer, 30, an ex-USFL player living in Germany,
did the same.;    "These guys are so hungry for knowledge about this game and
we just can't get enough," says Spencer, a self-proclaimed "utility man.";   
Says Austrian: "Ultimately, and it's hard to put a time frame on this, we'd
like to be one of the true international sports. . . .;    "We're not saying
we're going to overtake soccer -- that's a ludicrous goal. But I think we can
have a real international sport, in the truest sense of the word."  </TEXT>
