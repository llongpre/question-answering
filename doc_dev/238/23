   The National Football League criticized the
District of Columbia on Thursday for a planned lottery that would
allow residents to bet on professional teams and said it will
consider suing the city.
   NFL spokesman Joe Browne said the league opposes gambling
``legalized or otherwise'' and would review the lottery and explore
its options, including litigation.
   ``With increased betting on sports, the nature of fans would
change and they would become more concerned about winning bets than
seeing their team win a game,'' said Browne.
   The city's Lottery and Charitable Games Control Board
tentatively approved the plan Wednesday night. It would have to be
approved by city lawyers and passed again by the lottery board,
following a 30-day comment period, before it could be started.
   Although a similar sports lottery is under suit in Oregon, the
district's would be the first in the nation to allow wagering by
residents of an area on their region's home teams.
   The NFL say such legalized gambling would make it easier to fix
games, unlawfully makes money from their private enterprise and
could turn fans against their home teams.
   Browne said, for example, Washington Redskins fans may jeer the
football team as it protects a three-point lead in a game in which
the team is favored by four points.
   ``We don't want to create a situation where ... people are more
concerned about how much a team wins by rather than if they win,''
he said.
   ``Our players are straight and they play hard,'' said Abe
Pollin, owner of hockey's Washington Capitals and basketball's
Washington Bullets. ``But what would happen if fans started booing
them because even though they were playing well, they didn't cover
a point spread? The whole thing is very negative.''
   Under the district's proposed game, a bettor would wager on a
minimum of four games on each betting card. The bettor could choose
up to 14 games on each of four cards. Point spreads would be used,
just as in illegal gambling. Prizes would range from $1 to $4,000,
depending on the number of selections and correct picks.
   The Redskins, Capitals, Bullets and nearby Baltimore Orioles
would be included in the district's planned betting.
   The National Basketball Association is suing the ports betting
lottery in Oregon, which allows wagering on professional football
and basketball games.
   Oregon has no professional football team and its NBA franchise _
the Portland Trailblazers _ are exempt from the game.
   The NFL lost a suit to block a similar game in Delaware in the
1970s. The state later dropped the game due to a lack of interest.
   Pollin said he would talk with NBA Commissioner David Stern and
National Hockey League President John Ziegler about to prevent the
game from getting started.
   ``I think it's absolutely horrible and it sends a terrible,
terrible signal to people involved in sports,'' said Pollin. ``The
idea of that money could be legally wagered on professional sports
is a terrible thing.''
   ``We're trying to teach our young people to lead very straight
lives and then this sort of thing comes along,'' he added.
