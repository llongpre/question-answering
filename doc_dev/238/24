A decade ago, Rick White wrote a master's thesis on the business of baseball. 
Today he is one of baseball's most successful businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
For four years, the former Southern Californian has presided over soaring sales 
of official baseball memorabilia -- everything from traditional caps, pennants 
and baseball cards to more exotic orange Orioles beaks and Angels air 
mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
White is president of Major League Baseball Properties, which licenses 
souvenirs and apparel bearing major league team insignia. The former Chapman 
College student returned to Orange County on Friday for an annual convention of 
350 memorabilia makers, culminating with today's All-Star game at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
According to sports business observers and competitors, White deserves much of 
the credit for transforming the memorabilia business from a marginal operation 
to a major source of revenue and improving Major League Baseball's financial 
fortunes in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been phenomenal growth in the sale of baseball souvenirs, and Rick 
White has been the main reason," said Brent Diamond, publisher and editor of 
Team Licensing magazine, which monitors sale of paraphernalia sponsored by 
professional sports teams. "He's the marketing force that's driven almost all 
of their recent success." 
</P>
<P>
Major League Baseball turned a profit for the first time in decades in 1986 and 
has remained in the black ever since. From 1986 to 1988, league attendance 
jumped 11.5%, and radio and television revenue increased 33.5%. 
</P>
<P>
But the gains in attendance and broadcast revenues are dwarfed by growth in 
sales of official baseball merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, retail sales of Major League licensed goods totaled $225 million. The 
figure soared to $700 million in 1988 and is expected to top $1 billion this 
year. Major League Baseball, including the 26 teams and the commissioner's 
office, gets about 4% of that total and then divides it based on an undisclosed 
formula. 
</P>
<P>
This year's expanded sales put baseball ahead of the National Football League, 
which has long dominated the memorabilia market, according to White. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Vuono, senior director of licensing for the NFL, said it is unclear 
whether Major League Baseball is now the leader. The NFL declines to disclose 
its souvenir royalty revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"That sort of thing is hard to measure, and we don't release any figures," said 
Vuono. "But Rick has done a tremendous job in centralizing and developing their 
business . . . and most retailers say we're about even." 
</P>
<P>
White, 36, began his career with Major League Baseball after completing a 
"regression analysis" of baseball salaries for his master's thesis at Purdue 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured out that Hank Aaron should earn the most, and he did," said White, 
who had been an all-star catcher at La Mirada High School and student body 
president at Chapman College in Orange. "Sometimes you have to prove the 
obvious." 
</P>
<P>
After a short stint as a public relations officer for baseball's umbrella 
organization and then as an assistant branch manager with Carnation Co., White 
went back to work for Major League Baseball in 1979. He was assigned to Major 
League Promotions, the forerunner of Major League Baseball Properties. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were somewhat sloppily run then," said White. "Commissions varied 
radically, and the league, the teams and everybody else marketed the goods. 
(Then baseball commissioner) Bowie Kuhn didn't want to clog up the game with a 
lot of commercialism." 
</P>
<P>
When Peter Ueberroth took over as commissioner in 1984, however, things 
changed. Under pressure from both players and owners, Ueberroth centralized 
souvenir sales within Major League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Paraphernalia sales had been paired with an unprofitable media operation, which 
was spun off as Phoenix Communications in 1985. A former Time Inc. executive, 
Charlie Bear, was hired as a consultant for the new souvenir sales group, and 
an overall marketing plan was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"We found the money teams were making (on memorabilia), even after a World 
Series, wouldn't even pay for a utility infielder," White said. "Peter allowed 
us to make a change. He didn't tell us how to do anything but said we had to 
create some sort of strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Bear and White worked together to forge a marketing plan, which was designed to 
follow the NFL strategy of centralized sales, publicity and trademark 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"They got a late start and learned from the NFL's mistakes," said Diamond at 
Team Licensing magazine. "They've seen by far the most growth, largely because 
Rick put together a good marketing program." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, Major League Baseball assumed responsibility for stopping 
counterfeit goods. When the program began back in 1986, shipments of unlicensed 
foreign-made baseball products were turned back at the borders, and retailers 
were assured that they would not be undersold by makers of inferior products 
who cut separate deals with team owners. 
</P>
<P>
Around the same time, Major League Baseball also dumped 25% of its former 
licensees and began seeking more established producers. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 2 1/2 years, the organization has spent more than $6 million to 
police and prosecute counterfeiters. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to establish ourselves as an upper-end producer," White said. "So we 
are opening our own stores and are working with major department stores." 
</P>
<P>
As part of that move, the league last year began sponsoring the Diamond 
collection of authentic major league style apparel and the Cooperstown 
collection of historically accurate uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the league opened five Major League souvenir and apparel stores, in 
San Diego, Oakland, New York, Pittsburgh and Milwaukee. It plans to open two 
more by the end of 1989 -- one in Brea and one in Boston. The stores sell 
parkas, towels, sheets and even wallpaper, as well as more traditional items. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, White said, Major League Baseball Properties will begin more 
joint ventures with players and increased marketing of such collectibles as 
baseball cards and old jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if anything could dampen demand for Major League-sponsored goods, White 
mentioned counterfeiting, over-saturation of the market, and, of course, a 
players' strike. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't play baseball, we don't make money," he said. "It's that simple."
