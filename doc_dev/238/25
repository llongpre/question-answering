   They average $230,000 in salary for working less than six months of the year. 
If they are injured on the job, their employers assume medical costs. 
When they close out their careers, their employers pay them a handsome pension. 

   But that's not enough, say the 1,400 striking players of the National Football League. 
They want "free agency" -- the ability to sell their services on the open market to the highest bidder among the league's 28 employers. 
That way, they say, they can bring their average compensation closer in line with that received by their peers in professional baseball and basketball. 

   The NFL Players Union complains that, in the league's system of free agency, players are little more than chattel property of NFL owners. 
First, it argues, the league conducts a draft of college seniors, granting each of its 28 franchises exclusive rights to the players selected. 
Then when a player's contract with a particular club expires, he may offer his talents to other teams, but his original club has the right to match any rival offers. 
If a player signs with another team, his original employer is entitled to compensation in the draft based on the player's salary level. 

   Over the past 10 seasons, roughly 2,000 players have qualified for free agency. 
Only one has signed with another club. 
This statistic, the players' union maintains, is prima facie evidence that the NFL enforces a closed labor market. 

   The players' grievance reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of their profession. 
By suggesting that the owners are engaged in labor-market collusion, the players imply that the 28 NFL clubs operate as competitive, independent enterprises. 
The clubs do compete -- but only on the playing field. 
Where matters of finances are concerned, it's one for all and all for one. 

   The league has a formula for evenly apportioning revenues from television contracts, licensing arrangements, gate receipts and other sources among the 28 franchises. 
No matter how successful or unsuccessful a team is on the playing field -- whether it is a Super Bowl contender or league doormat -- it receives approximately the same amount of league revenue as any other club. 

   Thus, the addition or subtraction of a player -- no matter how talented -- has little if any impact on an NFL club's bottom line. 
It is unlike professional baseball or basketball, in which a star player can not only make a difference in a franchise's fortunes on the field, but off the field as well. 
Indeed, a popular player in those sports -- a Larry Bird or a Dwight Gooden -- can measurably boost a club's attendance, and thereby increase revenues. 
Attendance figures much less in an NFL club's profitability and owners rely less on individual performers to draw fans to the stadiums. 

   The NFL is not an entire industry. 
It is more a single entity, with 28 appendages. 
Any owner under the delusion that he is operating in a competitive market would threaten the stability of the entire institution. 
The same goes for the players. 
Whatever individual club they play for, they ultimately work for "NFL Inc." 
NFL Inc., with its 28 subsidiaries, competes collectively for consumers' entertainment dollars. 
The sooner the NFL players recognize this, the sooner they can stop throwing eggs at other "free agents" and get back to playing football.
