<LEADPARA>  A program for IBM PCs and compatibles can let football fans who are convinced
that the home team coach is calling plays with a defective Ouija board call
the shots for any team in the league.;   NFL Pro League Football, at $79.95
from Micro Sports Inc., takes the cerebral approach to bone-crushing,
concentrating on offensive and defensive strategies. Emphasis is on calling
the right play, and the opposing coach can be the computer or a human. There's
even a modem option so the human need not be in the same room.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The program comes with NFL teams from the past five years, and if you want
to match the 1988 Chicago Bears with the 1990 New York Giants, that's no
problem.;   The game plays in two basic modes, head-to-head and pro league. In
head-to-head, you call each play. In pro league, the team you selected will
play out a full game according to the game plan you approved.;   Although the
program has some animation, watching the screen isn't the point as much as
watching the game.;   Installation is easy, but you need good command of the
game to play. Set aside a solid half-hour to study the play cards, where each
play is identified by two digits and more codes tell how the play should go --
whether the quarterback should drop straight back on a pass, for example, who
the intended receiver is, what sort of a pattern he'll run and the distance
the play was designed for.;   The game is licensed by the National Football
League and NFL Players Association and requires a DOS machine with EGA or VGA
color graphics and a hard drive with almost 2 megabytes of free space. A
printer is handy because the software will generate play-by-play and scouting
reports and stats. And, of course, you'll need a modem if you want to play a
long-distance opponent.;   Both 5 1/4-inch and 3 1/2-inch floppy disks are
included. NFL Pro League Football is available at software stores. You can
also call (800) 937-7737 or write to Micro Sports Inc., P.O. Box 1178, Hixson,
TN 37343.  </TEXT>
