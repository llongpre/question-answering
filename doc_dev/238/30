"Most Americans," Dan E. Moldea says, "view sports as a vehicle of inspiration 
and entertainment" -- and as something to bet on. The estimated 25 million 
people who wager tens of billions of dollars on National Football League games 
each year eagerly accept the NFL's assurances that these games are honest. They 
don't know, or don't care, that the 10% "vigorish" that bookmakers charge on 
losing NFL bets provides the underworld with more illegal gambling income than 
all other sports combined. They prefer to believe that the league has 
rigorously investigated gambling and drug scandals, that team owners are 
sportsmen and that players always give their best. These are myths, Moldea 
says, but "powerful forces in America have built empires around these myths."

The truth is quite different, according to Moldea, a veteran crime reporter 
whose last book was "Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA and the Mob." The NFL 
claims that gamblers have made only two attempts, both unsuccessful, to fix 
games in the league's 60-year history. Instead, Moldea says, as many as 70 
games may have been fixed outright or manipulated to affect the point spread 
set by mob-connected oddsmakers. Even when games are honest, gamblers use their 
close ties to the NFL to gain inside information. Widespread drug use by 
players gives the mob even more leverage. What Moldea calls "the sweetheart 
relationship between the federal government and the NFL" has reduced many a 
promising investigation into the league's dirty secrets to the equivalent of 
three downs and a punt.

"Interference," in contrast, is like a hard-nosed fullback, gracelessly written 
but packed with names, dates and places, hitting the holes until the defense -- 
one's incredulity -- gives way. This is not the first time such accusations 
have been hurled; longtime NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle dismissed a 1983 PBS 
TV expose of the league as "a rehash of press clippings, gossip and rumor." 
Moldea's targets could say the same, but the weight of evidence is 
overwhelming. Moldea, shows, for example, how former Los Angeles Rams owner 
Carroll Rosenbloom partnered mob figures in business throughout his career. He 
was also a heavy gambler who, when he owned the Baltimore Colts, bet $1 million 
on them to win the 1958 NFL championship game with the New York Giants -- a sum 
that puts the recent Pete Rose baseball scandal in perspective. And Rosenbloom, 
Moldea makes clear, was -- and would be today -- just one of the boys. Michael
