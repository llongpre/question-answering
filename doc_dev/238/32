   NEW YORK -- Neil R. Austrian, a managing director of the
investment-banking firm Dillon, Read &amp; Co., was named to the
new position of president of the National Football League.
   Mr. Austrian, 50 years old, will be responsible for the
league's business and financial operations, including all NFL
broadcasting, special events and other revenue-producing
activities. Mr. Austrian, who will assume his post this
spring, will also have responsibility for the NFL Films and
NFL Properties units.

   The league said the creation of a presidency is part of
the reorganization of league operations approved by the 28
clubs in November. The reorganization followed a review of
league operations by consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton. Mr.
Austrian will work closely with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue,
who supervises all league activities and determines league
policy.
   Mr. Austrian, a former chairman and chief executive of the
cable channels Showtime/The Movie Channel Inc., becomes the
second executive with an entertainment and media industry
background to assume a major position in professional sports.
Francis T. Vincent Jr., who had been chief executive at
Columbia Pictures Inc., is commissioner of Major League
Baseball.
   Mr. Austrian, who also has ad agency experience, said he
has been talking with Mr. Tagliabue about some issues
regarding the NFL and television, including the scrambling of
broadcast signals for some games into restaurants and
taverns.
   The appointment of Mr. Austrian, who is a self-described
football fan who grew up in the Bronx, N.Y., comes as the NFL
is also exploring the idea of delivering some games to
viewers on a pay-per-view basis by 1993. This is the final
year of the NFL's four-year, $3.6 billion contract with the
three major broadcast networks as well as two cable networks,
all-sports ESPN and the vintage movie-oriented TNT, a
subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
   The NFL has said the move to pay-per-view wouldn't replace
free broadcasts, nor include the Super Bowl or playoff games.
