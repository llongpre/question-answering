<LEADPARA>  Here's one more reason to hate Washington: The Redskins are 9 and 0.;   As if
bounced checks and bad restaurant debts weren't enough, the nation's capital
once again is conspiring to stick it to the 50 states.  </LEADPARA>

WASHINGTON IS CRAZY ABOUT THE REDSKINS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     More than halfway through this National Football League season, the
Redskins are the lone unbeaten team -- the 13th team since World War II to go
9-0. If you thought folks here were talking about economic jump-starts --
well, they're talking Super Bowl.;   "We love our Redskins," said Stephen
Hess, a Brookings Institution scholar who usually studies government. "We're
crazy about 'em.";   The rest of the country apparently is not. The Redskins
may be blessed with the most passionate, single-minded hometown fans in pro
football, scholars and football observers say, but they will never be
America's Team.;   "People hate Washington," said Richard Lapchick, director
of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society in Boston. "They are fed up
with government, and Washington teams embody it.";   "They're the
establishment team," said Joe Horrigan of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in
Canton, Ohio.;   "They're the team of the permanent bureaucracy and
government," said Condoleezza Rice, a former member of the National Security
Council who teaches at Stanford University and follows the Cincinnati Bengals
and Denver Broncos.;   Heck, even the guy at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. doesn't
root for the Redskins. George Bush publicly picked the Houston Oilers to beat
the Redskins last Sunday at RFK Stadium. Like some of his other recent picks,
this one was wrong.;   That the town's most prominent resident would decide
that the astute choice was anti-Redskin, however, says something about the
team's appeal beyond the capital region -- or perhaps about Bush's concern
that the Redskins' name is, indeed, politically incorrect.;   "It definitely
hurts when the Bushman, the guy who lives here rent-free, says he wants
Houston to win," said Tony Kornheiser, a sports columnist for the Washington
Post. "If America's No. 1 fan, the guy who was born in nine different states,
turns his back on the neighborhood team, what are people supposed to think?"; 
 The NFL determines team popularity by calculating sales of licensed items
sold by its subsidiary, NFL Properties. Based on current numbers, the
undefeated Redskins rank only ninth in merchandise sold, said Ann McDowell,
senior licensing manager. The Raiders, 49ers and Giants lead the list.;   In
fact, in the previous eight years, the Redskins never have ranked first, she
said.;   "That's nine out of 28 teams!" Jack Kent Cooke, who owns the
Redskins, said about this year's rankings. "I think the Redskins are
tremendously popular.";   As for the city's bleak image rubbing off on his
team, "the football team transcends the alleged -- the alleged! --
unpopularity of Washington" is all Cooke will say on the record.;   But Cooke
himself blurs the line between the team and its political environs by filling
his box with establishment heavies. For instance, in attendance for the
Redskins' 16-13 overtime victory over Houston were Vice President Dan Quayle,
conservative columnist George Will and Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, a
Democratic presidential candidate. Checking out the occupants in Cooke's box
is itself a Washington sport.;   Like Bush, many people who have worked in the
White House support teams other than the Redskins, Stanford's Rice said.;  
"Everyone is a transplant," she said. "They don't glom onto the Redskins the
way Congress does. It's another example of split government.";   For the rest
of Washington, there are few split loyalties. The Redskins are icons, selling
out their 55,000-seat stadium this season, as they have since 1966.;   In a
city divided by party identification, class, race and crime -- a city without
a major league baseball team -- the Redskins remain the single common thread,
say people who live here.;   "They may be the only unifying force," said Wes
Heppler, an attorney who moved here 11 years ago from Detroit and still roots
for the Lions. "I've never seen a city that devotes so much press time, air
time -- so much time -- to a sports team.";   Some of that coverage is now
focusing on the Redskins' name, which Webster's Dictionary lists as an
offensive term. American Indian groups intend to protest outside each
remaining home game. But Cooke's son, John Cooke, recently told the Washington
Post, "We're keeping the name.";   With anti-Washington sentiment at perhaps a
record high, naming capital teams won't become any easier, either.;   "If a
baseball team ever comes back to Washington," said Brookings scholar Hess,
"believe me, it will not be called the Senators."  </TEXT>
