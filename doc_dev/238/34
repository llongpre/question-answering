<LEADPARA>  A NEW football card set that represents a major project by NFL Properties will
be issued this year, two sources connected to the league revealed last week.; 
  The set will be called ProLine Portraits, and the cards will be designed as
an upscale product to rival the quality of the cards from Upper Deck, which
will issue a football set under licenses from the NFL and NFL Players
Association (NFLPA).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The sources, who asked for anonymity, emphasized that the set is being
created and controlled by the NFL, although Pro Set, another licensee, will be
involved in the manufacturing and distribution.;    The NFL's control is
significant because the league needed to sign up players -- to buy their
rights -- and by doing that, the league has moved into territory previously
controlled by the NFLPA.;    The willingness of players to cooperate with
league management could spell disaster for the NFLPA, which may find its
licensing fees and merchandising royalties severely undercut by management
projects. Fees and royalties have been the financial lifeblood of the NFLPA
and critical to funding litigation against the league.;    Until recently,
licensing control basically was divided, with logo and design rights belonging
to the league and player rights belonging to the NFLPA. But the league took a
major step in a new direction earlier this year when it signed 11 quarterbacks
for endorsement deals, and the two sources said last week that there already
are about 100 players in the fold for the ProLine cards.;    ProLine cards
also may prove to be an economic challenge to consumers. Although one source
said ProLine is expected to have a lower retail price than Upper Deck, the
problem for collectors is the proliferation of brands. Every season, budgets
have to expand substantially to accommodate a complete collection of football
cards.;    Last season, the principal national sets were issued by Action
Packed, Fleer, Pro Set, Score and Topps. Those sets will return for the 1991
season, accompanied by ProLine, Upper Deck and a set from Pacific Trading
Cards (a Lynnwood, Wash., company), based on a license the NFL announced at
the end of March.;    As recently as 1988, Topps had the national market to
itself.;    In the style of Pro Set, the Dallas-based company that shares
ownership of a manufacturing plant with NFL Properties, the ProLine set will
include some kind of prize system that gives collectors a chance at
memorabilia. Pro Set, for example, has given away such items as a Joe
Montana-autographed helmet.;    Still, the key question remains whether the
marketplace can support what seems to be a glut of card products. The research
done by NFL Properties must have predicted a very healthy collecting
environment for at least the near future.;  WLAF CARDS: One of the features of
Pro Set's 1991 set will be 32 World League of American Football cards,
including cards for the head coach and a quarterback from each team. There
also will be a card for Mike Lynn, the league president.  </TEXT>
