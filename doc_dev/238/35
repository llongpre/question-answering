NFL'S OWNERS IN RIFT?; 
</P>
<P>
THEY MAY SPLIT OVER COMMITTEE'S CHOICE OF FINKS

A fight between the National Football League's two principal factions is likely 
Thursday if an NFL committee persists in its plans to recommend a new 
commissioner at that time, a club owner said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Culverhouse, president of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said that many of the 
league's newer owners are bitter over two of this week's developments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The selection committee's unanimous endorsement of Jim Finks, general 
manager of the New Orleans Saints, to succeed Pete Rozelle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The plan to round up NFL owners on less than a week's notice for a special 
meeting to choose the commissioner Thursday in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm outraged that they would unanimously recommend Jim Finks," Culverhouse 
said. "They said they would present three or four names -- and they come up 
with one man. 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, it's an outrage to call a league meeting for July 6 on six days' 
notice. That's two days after a four-day holiday -- a holiday for which many 
people made travel plans long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I'm leaving as planned for South America tomorrow. Other (owners) 
are overseas or out of town. It's inexcusable for them to call (a meeting) at 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the most important NFL meeting any of us will ever attend -- 
after all, we're selecting a commissioner -- and they call it on unbelievably 
short notice. That's arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
Other owners made similar points but asked not to be quoted. 
</P>
<P>
The co-chairmen of the selection committee, Lamar Hunt of the Kansas City 
Chiefs and Wellington Mara of the New York Giants, were unavailable, as was 
Finks. 
</P>
<P>
All were observing a long weekend over one of the few national holidays 
available to pro football people, who, Culverhouse noted, play games during 
many of the other holiday periods. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to reach the chairmen, Culverhouse, saying he was speaking for several 
of the newer owners, wired both Mara and Hunt to express discontent. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I urge you to reconsider your plans,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finks has been called the favorite of the NFL's old guard. 
</P>
<P>
The other faction is largely made up of owners who have come into the NFL in 
recent years. Eight clubs have changed hands in just the 1980s -- Denver, 
Philadelphia, San Diego, New Orleans, Seattle, Minnesota, New England and 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The presidents of these teams, who paid up to $100 million apiece for 
franchises, say their problems are much different from the problems of the 
old-guard owners, some of whom paid little or nothing for their franchises in a 
different era. 
</P>
<P>
The newer group is concerned that Finks or any other old-guard choice might 
ignore them and their large debt structures. 
</P>
<P>
If Finks is the only candidate endorsed, they said they'll nominate a candidate 
of their own at the Chicago meeting, precipitating a fight. 
</P>
<P>
It takes 19 of 28 owners' votes to elect. 
</P>
<P>
"When the (selection) committee was named at the spring meeting (in March), 
they said they'd come up with several (candidates) for us to (consider)," 
Culverhouse said. "That's what we want." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he expects if Finks' name is the only one presented, Culverhouse 
said: "The (old guard) will be in deep trouble." 
</P>
<P>
It's a sore point because, to begin with, the new owners' faction was bitter 
that none of them was named to the selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
"That committee represents one point of view," said Norman Braman, owner of the 
Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Hunt and Mara, the selection group includes Art Modell of 
Cleveland, Ralph Wilson of Buffalo, Dan Rooney of Pittsburgh and Robert Parins 
of Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"When the committee was named, I was afraid of something like this," a younger 
owner said. 
</P>
<P>
Culverhouse said: "I think they should postpone the meeting for a week or 
schedule it to coincide with a (special Chicago) meeting already scheduled for 
July 18." 
</P>
<P>
Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie, set to leave for Europe Sunday, said his plans 
were now unsettled.
