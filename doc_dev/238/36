The Oregon Lottery's venture into sports with wagering on professional football 
expanded today into basketball over strong protests and a lawsuit from the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
The new version of the betting game Sports Action includes outcomes of the 
weekend's National Basketball Assn. contests. (See Durslag, C3.) 
</P>
<P>
The lottery has been operating the weekly Sports Action game based on National 
Football League contests since Sept. 6. The new version of the game will 
include both football and basketball until the NFL playoffs end in late 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Action tickets go on sale each Wednesday for the coming weekend's games. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery Director Jim Davey said Tuesday that the new version of the game was 
all set despite the fact that the NBA took legal action last week seeking to 
prohibit sales. 
</P>
<P>
No restraining order was requested in the lawsuit brought in federal court in 
Eugene, and Davey said no date has been set for a court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is on," he said, urging bettors not to hold back because of the legal 
cloud. 
</P>
<P>
"People shouldn't hesitate in buying tickets because of the lawsuit," Davey 
said. "It's not going to impact them one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL protested when the lottery began its football game, the only one of its 
kind in the country, but did not take legal action. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA argues that the game will unfairly exploit the league's property 
rights, infringe on trademarks and violate federal gambling laws and state 
constitutional provisions. 
</P>
<P>
The betting system for NBA-related games is the same as for the football game: 
About 14 basketball games will be listed on each weekend's betting lineup. Bets 
will be based on point spreads developed by a Las Vegas odds maker. Bettors can 
wager at least $1 on three to 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Portland Trail Blazers are not included in the game in what Davey said was 
a courtesy to the home state team.
