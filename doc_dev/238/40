   The National Football League's new $1.43 billion television contract is expected to help bolster network profits, but it is a gamble for ESPN Inc. 

   The NFL said it has approved a new three-year contract with CBS Inc., National Broadcasting Co. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. for rights to air NFL games. 
The NFL also agreed to sell rights for 13 games to ESPN, a 24-hour cable sports programming service that is 80% owned by Capital Cities/ABC. 

   Overall, the new package reduces rights fees to the NFL by about 3%, to about $476 million annually, from about $490 million in 1986, the final year of a five-year, $2.1 billion contract with the networks. 

   The networks had been seeking a reduction in fees in the face of a soft advertising market for sports programs and declining viewership of games. 
Last year, the networks had losses totaling about $75 million on broadcasts of NFL games, though they made a slight profit on the overall five-year package, industry sources said. 

   Network executives hope the transaction will be a benchmark in future negotiations for other sports rights fees, including major league baseball, which is currently in the middle of a six-year contract. 

   Kenneth D. Schanzer, executive vice president at NBC Sports, said the NFL's willingness to reduce fees "is significant beyond measure because it augurs a new climate in the sports television marketplace. 
The NFL has historically been the bell cow." 

   Under the contract, CBS will continue to broadcast Sunday games, though its rights fees will fall more than 6% from the last year of the previous agreement to about $150 million annually. 
NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, also will continue to air Sunday games, but sources say its fee was cut more than 10% to about $120 million annually because of weaker viewership of its package. 

   ABC will pay about $115 million each year -- about flat from a year earlier on a per-game basis -- for 16 "Monday Night Football" broadcasts, but it dropped five "special" games that were aired under the old contract. 
ESPN bought rights for eight regular-season Sunday night games, four exhibition games and the Pro Bowl for about $50 million a year, sources said. 

   The NFL considered bids from several cable concerns as it sought to make up the revenue it expected to lose from the networks. 
"This is the toe in the water for cable with the NFL," acknowledged one network executive who asked not to be identified. 
"The league -- as it looks ahead long-term, like all other sports leagues -- thinks cable is where it is at." 

   But the transaction is a gamble for ESPN, which currently reaches 41 million homes through about 4,000 cable systems. 
ESPN hopes to cover the cost of the contract through advertising revenue and increased subscriber fees, which are paid by cable system operators. 
But it will have to compete for viewers against network prime-time programming. 

   Roger Werner, executive vice president of ESPN, said the increase in the current subscriber fee of 27 cents a month would be "substantially less than 20 cents per subscriber per month." 
If the charge was 10 cents a month for all 41 million homes, for example, the resulting $49.2 million a year would come close to covering ESPN's rights payments. 

   ESPN is expecting a rating of nine to 10 for its NFL games, more than double the ratings of its college football broadcasts. 
One rating point equals 874,000 homes with televisions. 

   Mr. Werner said he assumes advertising rates on ESPN's NFL broadcasts will be slightly less than for comparable network games, but those rates will still be the highest ever for cable telecasts. 
The highest advertising rate ESPN has charged was $12,000 to $14,000 per 30 seconds on its Saturday night college football broadcasts.
