   The pet product industry's annual trade show is
not a place dogs would find rough, rough, rough.
   It's a world where dogs strut in T-shirts and neon sun visors,
fish live in designer aquariums and birds eat from National
Football League helmet feeders.
   The 485 booths at the American Pet Products Manufacturers
Association show have such standard fare as pet foods, Kitty Litter
and bird cages, but also offbeat items.
   There is a full line of NFL-licensed items that identify pets
with their favorite team _ or at least the team of their owner.
   ``It's important to get kids and adults to think about their
pets and bring them into the family, not just look at them as
disposable things,'' said Karen Long MacLeod, editor of the trade
publication Pet Age. ``Those products are designed to keep pets
healthy and to have fun.''
   Anne McDowell, senior licensing manager for NFL Properties Inc.,
said the idea for the NFL pet products came from a dinner party
attended by a league official in Pittsburgh, where the hosts had
knit a Steelers sweater for their dog.
   When the NFL decided to sanction pet products bearing team
logos, Ms. McDowell said, ``We decided, don't do it piecemeal. Go
all the way. Let's do everything.''
   Animal T-shirts, sweaters, dinner bowls, beds, collars and bird
feeders all bear NFL insignias.
   There's a variety pack of rawhide chews in the shapes of
helmets, footballs, jerseys and pennants.
   The three-day show was ending today.
