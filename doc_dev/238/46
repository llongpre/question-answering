   The justice of gender in the locker room was
supposed to be settled 12 years ago. Courts gave women
sportswriters equal access to dressing rooms so they would have the
same chance as men to do their jobs.
   Yet the issue of women in the clubhouse keeps making headlines.
Denise Tom of USA Today was barred Monday night from the Cincinnati
Bengals' dressing room hours after the National Football League
named an investigator to look into charges of harassment of Boston
Herald reporter Lisa Olson.
   ``We go into locker rooms not because we want to, but because we
have to,'' wrote Christine Brennan, a sportswriter with The
Washington Post and one of pioneers who fought for equal access.
   ``It's not exciting or sexy or tantalizing. It's cramped and
steamy and messy,'' she said. ``But most stadiums are too old to
have a room big enough for all reporters and all players to meet
for interviews. So the only place we can do our jobs is the locker
room.''
   About 500 women work as sports journalists, according to the
Association for Women in Sports Media. They have the same right to
do their jobs as women who drive trucks, mine coal, doctor the sick
or practice law.
   Precedent was established in 1978 when a federal judge ruled
Melissa Ludtke, a reporter for Sports Illustrated, could go into
the New York Yankees' clubhouse. Barring her violated her
constitutional right to equal protection under the law, Judge
Constance Baker Motley ruled.
   In 1985, Commissioner Pete Rozelle ordered all NFL teams to
treat reporters equally in interview areas, regardless of sex. Some
teams like the Dallas Cowboys set up rooms where players could be
interviewed; others handed out bathrobes or towels to players.
   Major league baseball provided equal access that year, too.
Basketball and hockey already had set open policies. The National
Basketball Association schools rookies on how to deal with the
media - male and female.
   But the going has hardly been easy for women in the world of
jocks, where clubhouses smell of sweat and salve and soiled
athletic supporters but where reporters have to go for interviews.
   In 1986, Susan Fornoff of The Sacramento (Calif.) Bee received a
live rat wrapped in a shoe box from Dave Kingman of the Oakland
Athletics. Joan Ryan of The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel once told of a
player from a defunct football league who ran a razor up her leg as
she conducted an interview.
   Earlier this year, intern Jennifer Frey of the Detroit Free
Press was told by Detroit Tigers pitcher Jack Morris: ``I don't
talk to people when I'm naked, especially women, unless they're on
top of me or I'm on top of them.''
   When the newspaper complained, Tigers president Bo Schembechler
wrote back: ``No female member of my family would be inside a men's
locker room regardless of their job description.''
   Now, former Watergate investigator Philip Heymann has been named
to look into charges that New England Patriots' players exposed
themselves and made suggestive remarks to Olson on Sept. 17. The
Herald reporter called it ``nothing less than mind rape.''
   Tight end Zeke Mowatt was fined $2,000 and apologized, but
denied making lewd gestures or comments. He said the only thing he
told her was: ``You are not writing; you are looking.''
   Patriots owner Victor Kiam at first called the locker room
incident ``a flyspeck in the ocean,'' then told the paper it was
``asking for trouble'' by sending a female reporter into a football
dressing room. He was also quoted as calling her ``a classic
bitch.''
   After the National Organization for Women called from a boycott
of Remington Products Inc., which Kiam owns, he took out full-page
ads in The New York Times, the Boston Herald and The Boston Globe.
   Kiam apologized and said ``there's no excuse for what
happened.'' He also denied calling her a name.
   She was booed at Sunday's game.
   In Seattle, Bengals Coach Sam Wyche kept USA Today's Tom from
the locker room because ``our guys don't want a woman to walk into
a situation like that.'' In the past, Wyche has closed the locker
room to all reporters in violation of NFL policy and was fined last
year.
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Wyche faces another fine for
not letting a woman into the locker room.
   ``If he wants to make a stand on he issue, he can make a stand
on the issue. He will be fined very heavily for it. If he wants to
quit, he can quit, because he has been warned twice already,''
Tagliabue said.
   Tuesday's edition of USA Today contained a column by
sportswriter Rachel Shuster aimed at NFL brass. She concluded:
``We've earned our place in the locker room. Now, just give us some
respect, and we'll do our jobs and let you do yours.''
