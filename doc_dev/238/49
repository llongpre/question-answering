   The National Football League is close to an agreement on television broadcast rights that would reduce fees paid by the three major networks as much as 10%, broadcasting executives said. 

   The NFL could announce as early as this week a new three-year contract with CBS Inc., Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit, executives said. 
The NFL's annual meeting begins today in Hawaii. 

   Executives said that under the new contract, the three networks will pay slightly less each year than the $490 million they paid the NFL in rights fees in 1986, the final year of a $2.1 billion, five-year contract. 
The networks, which reportedly lost as much as $75 million broadcasting NFL games last year, have been seeking lower fees in light of a softer sports advertising market and declining viewership of games. 

   To make up lost network revenue, the league is also expected to announce a fourth rights package with a cable concern, possibly ESPN Inc., Time Inc.'s Home Box Office unit, or Cable Football Network, a consortium of cable companies. 
ESPN, a cable sports television service, is 80%-owned by Capital Cities/ABC. 

   The cable concerns have bid on a package of eight Sunday night games, four exhibition games and the Pro Bowl, sources said. 
ABC will continue to air Monday Night Football, though ABC reportedly is dropping five "special" broadcasts of games on other nights. 

   An NFL spokesman wouldn't confirm or deny reports of progress at the talks.
