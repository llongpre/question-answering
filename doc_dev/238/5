Miami Dolphin owner Joe Robbie, who two years ago moved the NFL team to his own 
privately financed stadium, died Sunday at age 73, Coach Don Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie, who had reportedly been ill in recent months, died at an undisclosed 
Miami-area hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I was aware he was seriously ill, but I only found out about this a half hour 
ago, and it's still a shock," Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate information on the cause or exact time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and 11 children, three of which work 
for the Dolphins. Late last year, he announced the establishment of a living 
trust for the franchise that he said ensured family ownership for at least the 
next generation. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie was a successful trial lawyer when he got involved in the sport in 
August 1965 at age 49 with a franchise in the American Football League. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Robbie hired Shula as coach. In his first season, Shula improved the 
Dolphin record from 3-10-1 in 1969 to 10-4. Two years later, the team compiled 
a 17-0 record -- still the best in league history -- to give Miami its first 
NFL championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins repeated as NFL champion in 1973 and have won five AFC titles and 
have pro football's best record since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Dolphins moved their home games from the half-century-old Orange 
Bowl to $115 million Joe Robbie Stadium. Super Bowl XXIII was played there last 
Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie put up all his possessions -- including the Dolphins franchise -- as 
collateral to assure completion of construction. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie was born July 7, 1916, in Sisseton, S.D. He attended Northern State 
Teachers College in Aberdeen and the University of South Dakota Law School. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie, a Democrat, served in the South Dakota Legislature. He ran 
unsuccessfully for governor in South Dakota and for a U.S. House seat in 
Minnesota.
