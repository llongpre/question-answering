A legalized sports betting initiative proposal for next year's November 
election ballot was filed on Monday by a Southern California assemblyman, who 
said it could raise up to $100 million a year in new revenues for senior 
citizen programs, law enforcement and fire protection services. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, right across three of California's four borders -- in Nevada, at 
Tijuana, and now in Oregon -- legal football betting is taking place," said 
Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), who says he likes to gamble on 
football games but dislikes having to leave the state to do so. "We are 
exporting literally millions of California dollars that ought to be spent 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd's office reported $1.2 billion was wagered on professional and college 
football games in Nevada sports rooms in 1987. Oregon initiated lottery-style 
professional football card betting in September and took in $221,244 during the 
first week. 
</P>
<P>
The National Football League is against the proposed legalized sports betting 
initiative. California Lottery officials said they have no position on it at 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL is unalterably opposed to any type of gambling on NFL games," said Jim 
Heffernan, the league's public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
"No comment," said Joanne McNabb, communications director for the lottery, 
which probably would lose some business if the initiative is qualified and 
approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials estimate that between $7 billion and $10 billion is 
illegally wagered on sporting events in California each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Legalized, licensed sports betting would not only cut significantly into the 
revenues of the underworld," Floyd said, "but obviously add millions of dollars 
to our public treasuries." 
</P>
<P>
The sponsor of the initiative, filed with the attorney general's office in the 
first step of the process, will need to obtain the valid signatures of 595,485 
registered voters on petitions in order to qualify it for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd noted that voters approved the state lottery the first time it qualified 
for the ballot after the idea had been blocked in the Legislature for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Poll results show a close relationship between popular support for the lottery 
and for sports betting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed initiative, legalized sports betting on all professional and 
college sporting events could take place at horse racing tracks and, subject to 
local approval, in licensed clubs. Betting on community college and high school 
sports would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
A new state gaming commission would have jurisdiction over the sports betting 
system. Each betting facility would set its own wagering parameters and house 
rules. Athletes and managers who bet on their own sport would be subject to 
felony prosecution and up to three years in state prison upon conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd estimated that the state could receive up to $50 million a year from 
taxes on legal wagers for senior citizen programs, and local government could 
obtain another $50 million from tax revenues to help finance police, fire and 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the $210.8 billion reaped annually by legalized gambling on a 
nationwide basis makes it the "hottest growth industry" in the U.S. economy of 
the 1980s. "I want California to share in that growth in the 1990s," Floyd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the state lottery, he said, the initiative would not put the state 
directly into the business of conducting gambling because it would only license 
private operators. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd also dismissed the idea that the initiative could increase compulsive 
gambling. "You don't close supermarkets to combat overeating," he said. "The 
first step in helping compulsive bettors is to remove the stigma of 
criminality."
