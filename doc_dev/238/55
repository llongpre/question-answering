NEWSWIRE: SEAHAWKS' BURSE FAILS DRUG TEST, OUT 30 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Second-year fullback Tony Burse, trying to earn a spot on the Seattle Seahawks 
roster, was suspended for 30 days by the National Football League for violating 
the league's substance abuse policy, the NFL said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks were notified by the league Friday that Burse, who will not be 
allowed to practice with the team until Sept. 6, had tested positive for drugs 
in the NFL's mandatory preseason test. It was not known what substance was 
found in the test. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Chuck Knox refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Morning News Tribune in Tacoma said the league told the Seahawks that Burse 
was a "Step Two" violator, meaning it was the second time he had failed a test 
since NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle implemented his drug plan last year. A 
30-day suspension is mandatory for second-time violators. 
</P>
<P>
If Burse failed a third test, he would be banned from football for an 
indefinite period. 
</P>
<P>
Burse failed one test during training camp last year. 
</P>
<P>
Burse, 24, has not practiced with the Seahawks since suffering an ankle injury 
during practice Tuesday. He did not play in the team's 16-10 overtime victory 
over Phoenix in Tempe, Ariz., Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 220-pound Burse, from Middle Tennessee State, was a 12th-round 
draft pick of the Seahawks in 1987. He made Seattle's roster for the 1987 
season and played in 12 games, mainly on special teams, but was cut during the 
1988 exhibition season. He also tested positive for drugs for the first time 
during that period.
