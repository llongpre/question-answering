<P>
An agreement allowing a single company to supply 90% of the helmets used in 
National Football League games does not violate antitrust laws, a judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
In a 28-page opinion issued Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge James B. Zagel 
refused to issue a permanent injunction halting the agreement between Riddell 
Inc. and NFL Properties, the league's licensing arm. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction was sought by a Litchfield, Ill., company that said it once 
provided 40% of the helmets used by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Under the April, 1988, agreement, Chicago-based Riddell provides free helmets, 
shoulder pads and other gear to the league's 28 teams. In return 90% of a 
team's players use its helmets. Players who wear helmets by other companies 
must conceal those companies' logos. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Schutt Athletic Sales Co. of Litchfield argued that Schutt could be 
forced out of business because the agreement hurt the company's sales of 
helmets to college and high school teams.
