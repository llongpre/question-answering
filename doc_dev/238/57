Officials for the NFL and the major television networks said Thursday that they 
were stunned by the response of sports-bar owners angered over the scrambling 
of NFL telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
But league and network officials also said that, despite the national outcry, 
scrambling would not be reversed and no option to "de-scramble" would be made 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"This story has been picked up all over America, and indeed, the response has 
been surprising . . . overwhelming," said Val Pinchbeck, the NFL's vice 
president in charge of broadcasting. "But we're not going to change what we 
started. We and the networks agreed we would move toward scrambling, and that 
we have done." 
</P>
<P>
Pinchbeck said National Football Conference games carried on CBS would be 
"fully scrambled" by the start of the season Sept. 9. He said scrambling of NBC 
telecasts involving the American Football Conference would be complete "at 
least by mid-season." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Home Box Office, ESPN, TNT and cable outlets offering "de-scrambling" 
packages, in which subscribers buy a decoder and also pay a fee, the NFL plans 
no such option "at any point in the future," Pinchbeck said, adding that only 
local affiliates would have the ability to receive network games. 
</P>
<P>
Sports-bar owners have in the past attracted customers with rooting interests 
in NFL teams in other parts of the country by showing games not available 
through local affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Norman Lebovitz, the owner of Sluggo's, a family-oriented 
restaurant that prides itself on its Chicago sports theme, said he had been 
named chairman of a Southern California organization called the Assn. for 
Sports Fans' Rights. The group held its first meeting in Hillcrest Monday 
night, and more than 40 people -- including eight lawyers -- attended. 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz said his group had joined forces with Sports Fans of America, a 
Miami-based organization that has waged war in the courtroom over the showing 
of Dolphins games "blacked out" in Southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard from organizations in Philadelphia, Phoenix, Los Angeles, New 
Orleans, San Francisco . . . These people are outraged," said Lebovitz, who 
operates Sluggo's in three San Diego locations and has traditionally drawn 
large crowds for telecasts of regional NFL games involving the Bears. "I'm 
talking to hundreds who represent thousands. It seems grass-roots America is 
taking this as a personal offense." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) said he had heard from constituents outraged over 
the NFL's decision. As a member of the House Committee of Energy and Commerce, 
Bates said he planned to ask the subcommittee on telecommunications to 
investigate NFL scrambling and decide whether it was legally appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"I have real reservations about it," Bates said. "So I'm considering 
legislation to prevent the league from doing it. At this point, it depends on 
public reaction. If it continues to come down soundly against the NFL, I think 
the bill can pass. It seems to me the NFL got hysterical and is going against 
the majority and the needs of consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Kerr, a spokeswoman for CBS Sports, said from New York that scrambling 
was done at the request of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL asks us to do it, because it protects the interests of the home team," 
Kerr said. "If you're with the Rams organization and somebody in Southern 
California has the capability of sitting home or going to a sports bar and 
watching multiple games, that threatens attendance of Rams' home games. 
Scrambling protects the popularity of local teams." 
</P>
<P>
But Pinchbeck says the opposite, that scrambling was a "condition" spelled out 
by the networks in the four-year, $3.6-billion agreement that takes effect this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
And Jay Rosenstein, vice president for sports programming at CBS, said that 
scrambling had been the "mandate" of local affiliates to the networks since 
negotiations for the new agreement began. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL has its own reasons for wanting to protect its copyright," Rosenstein 
said from New York. "We have a number of issues vis a vis the network-affiliate 
relationship. When you spend that kind of money ($1.5 billion by CBS alone) to 
provide football to local affiliates, you expect the games to be watched. The 
opportunity to sell commercials in those games is a way of getting back our 
rather substantial investment." 
</P>
<P>
Rooftop "dishes" that pick up signals beamed from satellites receive only 
network feeds, and not the broadcasts of local stations. Thus, users of such 
technology don't see local and regional commercials. (National, network 
commercials are fed via satellite.) 
</P>
<P>
A senior official at NBC, requesting anonymity, said the networks demanded 
scrambling because of the threat represented by dish owners and patrons of 
sports bars to the Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"If every football fan in America went to sports bars to watch the games, there 
would be nobody at home watching games," the official said from New York. 
"That's what we want, that's what we live by -- people at home watching games. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertisers don't pay the dish owner. They pay the networks and the local 
affiliates. If you're not watching at home, you represent an audience that 
can't be measured -- by the Nielsen ratings or any other survey I know of." 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz, the San Diego restaurateur, said attorneys for the Assn. of Sports 
Fans' Rights are "exploring the possibility" of obtaining an injunction to 
prevent scrambling on Sept. 9. He said that the "1,000 or so" sports bars 
across America would "simply go out of business" if scrambling is enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the NFL is vulnerable in the antitrust area."
