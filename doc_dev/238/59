   Labor gridlock gripped much of the professional sports world yesterday. 

   The professional basketball players union filed suit against the National Basketball Association in a Newark, N.J., federal court, charging that the league's annual draft of college players, its team salary caps and its provision for first refusal rights on players seeking to switch teams violate antitrust laws. 

   Meanwhile, the impasse in the National Football League's labor talks continued as league owners prepared to resume play Sunday with nonunion players and about 35 others who crossed picket lines. 

   During prolonged negotiations with the league, the NBA Players Association has been seeking to abolish the draft, the salary cap ($4 million per team last year) and the right of first refusal, which it claims restricts players' movement and earning power by reducing competition among teams for their services. 

   So far, little progress has been made on those issues after nine sessions. 
The league's collective bargaining agreement expired June 15 and a negotiated moratorium on signing rookies and free agents expired yesterday. 

   Lawrence Fleisher, the union's general counsel, said the union has sought an expedited proceeding in the hope of avoiding a lockout or strike. 
He didn't rule out the possibility of a strike but said players are free to sign contracts and report to training camp Oct. 9. 
The NBA season begins Nov. 6. 

   Russell Granik, executive vice president of the NBA, said the league remains "very comfortable in our position that until there is a new agreement or a work stoppage, we are required to operate under the last collective bargaining agreement." 
He pointed out that the validity of the draft and the salary cap were affirmed by both a trial court and appellate court last year in a case brought by player Leon Wood. 

   On the NFL front, players continued to return to their teams. 
So far, however, only a small percentage of the union's 1,585 members have decided to return for this week's games. 
Fans were also returning -- their tickets. 
NFL teams reported thousands of requests for refunds and said they expected thousands more. 

   Neither side has moved to resume talks, preferring instead to wait and see who gets the upper hand after this week's games. 

   The NFL and NBA represent two of the nation's four major professional sports leagues, along with Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League. 
In recent years, only the NHL has avoided a work stoppage.
