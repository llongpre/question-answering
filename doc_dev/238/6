There are few people more familiar with the problems of the National Football 
League than Paul Tagliabue. It has been his rather difficult job to defend the 
league against the glut of lawsuits that contributed to Pete Rozelle's 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue was the loser in the suit brought by the Los Angeles Coliseum 
Commission against the NFL for antitrust violations. The jury awarded the 
commission about $20 million in damages for the league's violations of 
antitrust laws. The suit cost the NFL $10 million in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, he was the loser in the suit brought by the United States Football 
League against the NFL. However, the USFL asked for $1.6 billion but was 
awarded only $3 in damages. That defense cost the NFL $26 million in legal fees 
and greatly enhanced Tagliabue's reputation among the league's owners. 
</P>
<P>
And he was the loser in the Raiders' antitrust suit against the NFL for trying 
to stop the team's move to Los Angeles from Oakland. The NFL had to pay $20 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue joined the powerful Washington law firm of Covington &amp; Burling in 
1969. After being made a partner, he almost exclusively handled the league's 
Washington affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the losses, Tagliabue's reputation as an excellent antitrust lawyer has 
remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of his selection as NFL commissioner was met with equal 
enthusiasm by his courtroom opponents and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a fine gentleman and a scholarly lawyer, and unlike his predecessor he 
may pay some attention to antitrust laws," said Max Blecher, an attorney who 
represented the Coliseum Commission against the NFL. "He'll keep them on the 
straight and narrow, I hope. They need it." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Pregerson, formerly a U.S. district judge now at the 9th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals, also had positive recollections of Tagliabue during the 
Coliseum trial. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding lawyer and certainly has a complete understanding of how 
the league functions, knows all the owners and I'm sure many of the players," 
Pregerson said, while admitting that he has never seen an NFL game in person or 
on television. "He made some cogent arguments, and my impressions were always 
very favorable and straightforward." 
</P>
<P>
Peter K. Leisure, the U.S. district judge who heard the USFL-NFL trial, was 
also impressed with Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a man for all seasons, even though we're only talking about a fall 
season," Leisure said from his office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"He takes great care in approaching very difficult problems, shows patience and 
thoroughness and above all has a high intellect. I could not be more pleased to 
hear that he would be at the helm during difficult times as well as good times 
for the National Football League and professional sports in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue is a specialist in antitrust law and the author of "Antitrust 
Developments in Sports and Entertainment," which appeared in the Antitrust Law 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Sullivan, a professor at the University of California and one of the 
country's leading experts on antitrust law, said the choice of Tagliabue is a 
good one. 
</P>
<P>
"I have general impressions of him as being a very competent, rather balanced 
type of person and probably a wise choice," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Antitrust legislation is at the heart of the NFL problems. The league has long 
contended that its monopolistic practices are used to increase competition 
rather than to discourage it. Tagliabue told Fortune magazine: "Any normal 
business can decide where it wants a plant, but we're treated like a group of 
conspirators rather than a meeting of the board." 
</P>
<P>
This is a view that the courts have not accepted, instead ruling that each team 
is a separate entity. The NFL has long sought an exemption similar to the one 
granted major league baseball. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said 
in 1922 that baseball is a national pastime and exempt from antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue also represented the NFL in the suit filed by the National Football 
League Players Assn. after the 1987 strike. The matter is yet to be decided by 
a Minneapolis court. 
</P>
<P>
Still, his reputation is not one of being anti-union. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have him listed as a union buster," said Virginia Diamond, an 
attorney with the AFL-CIO. "We've never considered Covington &amp; Burling a 
union-busting firm." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFLPA, said that he expects good 
relations with the new commissioner. "I want to congratulate Paul Tagliabue on 
his selection as NFL commissioner and I look forward to working with him," 
Upshaw said in a statement. "I have always found him a straight-forward 
thinking type of person interested in resolving differences."
