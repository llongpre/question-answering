NEWSWIRE: SANDERS TO TURN PRO NEXT SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders notified the National Football League 
Thursday that he is turning pro, setting up a possible test of the league's 
restrictions against drafting underclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sanders is not expected to comment before a news conference Saturday 
at Denver, Oklahoma State's probation for recruiting violations probably 
figured in his decision. The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. banned the 
university from bowl games for three years and from television appearances for 
two. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' status with the NFL, however, is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
Myron Roderick, Oklahoma State athletic director, said it was his understanding 
that even if Sanders chose not to play in the NFL, that he could not return to 
play in college. 
</P>
<P>
A junior, Sanders is ineligible for either the regular or supplemental drafts 
without a special exemption from Commissioner Pete Rozelle. Rozelle has granted 
about six of those exemptions a year for the past 20 years, mostly to players 
who were never drafted. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, Rozelle has cited the possibility that if he turned down the 
request, the league's policy might be challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
NFL sources, however, have indicated the league is more inclined to go to court 
now to test its rules against drafting underclassmen.
