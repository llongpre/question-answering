The job is Jack Kemp's if he wants it, the owners of several National Football 
League clubs indicated privately here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be only one hitch: Does he want to be the NFL commissioner or 
continue as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in President Bush's 
cabinet? 
</P>
<P>
As the former congressman from Buffalo, N.Y., grapples with that question, the 
owners of most NFL clubs are here also discussing it. They also are sizing him 
up with the other candidates for the position that Pete Rozelle is vacating. 
</P>
<P>
The owners will not say flatly that they want Kemp because of the possibility 
that he doesn't want the job. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Kemp, formerly a quarterback for the Buffalo Bills in the 1960s, 
didn't return phone calls to those he knew were seeking his comments on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Kemp issued a statement through a department spokesman: "His plans are 
to fulfill his commitment to serve in the Bush Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the six-owner committee researching Kemp and other candidates met at 
length Tuesday night in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The co-chairmen, Wellington Mara of the New York Giants and Lamar Hunt of the 
Kansas City Chiefs, said they wouldn't discuss the findings before making their 
report to the convention today. 
</P>
<P>
A site for Super Bowl XXVI in 1992 also will be selected this afternoon. The 
game will be played in a northern domed stadium, probably at Indianapolis or 
Seattle. The other candidates are Minnesota and Detroit. 
</P>

NFL Notes 
</P>
<P>
The new international football league will begin play next April, its 
commissioner, Tex Schramm, said after meeting with an owners' committee 
Tuesday. Schramm's plans: Teams will be based in New York, London and 10 other 
cities, including six foreign cities. The West Coast franchise isn't likely to 
be in Los Angeles. The league will be owned by stockholders, including some NFL 
club owners, and the players will also be owned and paid by the league. The 
teams are to be franchised to local owners.
