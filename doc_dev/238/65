   The nation's only state-run football pool
based on the point spreads of NFL games began taking bets today.
   ``The system is up and running,'' said Oregon Lottery Director
Jim Davey. He said retailers sold about $1,100 worth of bets
statewide in the game's first three hours, which he called ``pretty
good.''
   The National Football League has threatened legal action against
the state, charging that the pool, called Sports Action, will hurt
the integrity of professional football.
   But Oregon's move has inspired other states to consider offering
such pools. The pool was created as a way to generate money for
athletics and scholarships at Oregon's colleges.
   The point spreads are to be made each week by Michael ``Roxy''
Roxborough, an oddsmaker in Nevada. Sports Action bets can be made
as late as Sunday afternoon each week, provided that the games being
played haven't started.
   Players can bet on four to 10, or all 14, NFL games each week.
Wagers can be for $1-$5, $10 or $20 on each entry form.
   ``I imagine the betting will pick up toward the weekend,'' Davey
said. ``The first NFL game isn't until Sunday morning, so people
have lots of time to think about it.''
