   The National Football League players union may finally be
gaining ground in its novel quest: to get broader free-agency
powers after having dropped its collective-bargaining
functions.
   The union, the NFL Players Association, moved to end its
bargaining functions in 1989. The aim was to strip the NFL of
its antitrust exemption, and thereby attack the league's
restrictive free-agency system. A free agent is a player
whose contract is up and is eligible to negotiate with other
teams. But the current NFL system, requiring compensation to
the player's original team, keeps a lid on free-agent
movement.

   Two recent court decisions indicate that the union may
finally be scoring with its legal strategy. In the past two
weeks, two federal judges have separately agreed: absent
collective bargaining, the NFL is absent its antitrust
exemption. The league is potentially vulnerable to unfettered
player mobility, huge damages awards and undoing the player
draft.
   In the midst of a lucrative four-year $3.6 billion
television deal and enjoying record league attendance, most
NFL teams are currently profitable. Judging by the example of
baseball, a more-open system of free agency would push up
player salaries and cut into profits.
   "They have a lot to worry about and the players have a lot
to be pleased about," said Doug Allen, assistant executive
director of the players union.
   In the more important case, U.S. District Judge David Doty
of Minneapolis ruled that since the players union no longer
exists, for collective-bargaining purposes, neither does the
NFL's antitrust exemption. That allowed a suit filed by New
York Jets running back Freeman McNeil and seven other players
to move forward, toward a February 1992 trial date. They
charge the NFL's restrictions on free-agency violate
antitrust laws.
   The NFL promptly appealed to the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, contending the Players Association's scrapping of
union status is "nothing more than a ploy designed to
increase {its} leverage in subsequent bargaining."
   The NFL's labor-relations executive vice president, Harold
Henderson, also played down the decisions. "Momentum in
litigation swings back and forth as much as an athletic
contest," he said. "We are a long way from a litigated
resolution."
   But outsiders generally agreed the Doty decision was
significant. "We're still looking down the road a long way
before the owners are vanquished in court," said Gary
Roberts, vice dean of the Tulane University Law School and a
former lawyer for the NFL. "But Doty's decision moved the
ball forward for the players association. They're getting
toward midfield."
   Judge Doty was previously overturned by the Eighth Circuit
on a similar NFL matter. He found in favor of player Marvin
Powell, in a free-agency suit similar to Mr. McNeil's. But a
three-judge panel held that the players had collectively
bargained away their rights to free agency. The appeals court
exempted the NFL from antitrust challenge as long as a union
existed. The union soon began decertification proceedings, in
late 1989.
   With that issue removed, said Martin Greenburg, associate
director of Marquette University Law School's National Sports
Law Institute, "There's a good chance this will be upheld."
   The other decision, by U.S. District Judge Royce C.
Lamberth of Washington, D.C, came in a union suit filed on
behalf of "developmental squad" players. Their
$1,000-per-week pay on each team, the union charged, amounted
to illegal price-fixing. Judge Lamberth ruled the NFL lost
its antitrust exemption as of the expiration of the union's
last collective bargaining contract, which expired in 1987.
   That case is more limited, involving NFL scrubs rather
than stars. But, said Jim Quinn, the union's lead lawyer on
the McNeil case, "Clearly, {Judge Lamberth's} decision will
help us with our appeal on McNeil."
   The developmental-squad decision could also be a leading
indicator of the NFL's financial jeopardy. The union's Mr.
Allen sees potential damages totaling $80 million on the
developmental-squad case, when trebled. The NFL's exposure on
the McNeil case and possible companion suits would dwarf that
sum.
   That's why many see pressure building for NFL-initiated
settlement talks, which Mr. Henderson, the NFL labor
executive, acknowledges. "The league feels very strongly that
relying exclusively on litigation is counterproductive," he
said. "We're beginning to explore alternatives."
