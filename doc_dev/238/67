   The National Football League announced its schedule for the 1987-88 season, and it contained good news for ESPN, the latest member of the league's broadcast team. 

   The cable sports network got some strong drawing cards for its first year of Sunday night NFL telecasts. 
The cable channel, for instance, will get to show eight of last year's 10 playoff teams and some appealing matchups among traditional rivals. 
Of the eight Sunday night regular-season schedule games it captured, half feature at least one team from the nation's three largest television markets -- Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. (Earlier, ESPN got rights to four pre-season telecasts.) 

   This is the first time the NFL has gone to cable TV. 
The cable sports network paid a total of $153 million for a three-year contract to join the three broadcast networks in carrying NFL games. 
There had been some concern about whether ESPN -- which is owned 80% by Capital Cities/ABC Inc. -- would get a strong enough schedule to appeal to advertisers and to cable operators, who will be asked to pay extra for the games. 

   That concern may shift to CBS and NBC, whose schedule of premium games will be depleted by the addition of ESPN's telecasts to the 16 Monday night games on ABC. 
"I'm a little apprehensive about the games being taken out of our schedule," said Neal Pilson, president of CBS Sports.
