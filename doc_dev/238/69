   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration to offer its opinions about key limitations on free
agency in the National Football League.
   The court asked Justice Department lawyers to comment on a lower
court's ruling that NFL restrictions on a player's switch to another
team do not violate federal antitrust law.
   The justices are not expected to say whether they will review
that ruling until hearing from the government lawyers, which could
take months.
   No further court action in the case is likely before October,
when the justices return from their summer recess, scheduled for
late June or early July.
   The antitrust case is an outgrowth of a 24-day strike in 1987 by
the National Football League Players Association. The walkout ended
without a new contract between the players and the league's 28 team
owners.
   But the owners continued to enforce an expired contract, signed
in 1982, containing provisions that restrict free agency.
   The provisions limit a player's ability to negotiate and sign
with a new team. The player's original team is given the right to
match a competing club's offer.
   If the original team declines to match the offer, the player's
new team must compensate the other team with draft choices.
   The provisions are called the league's first refusal-compensation
system. The NFL has a separate provision, known as Plan B, in which
teams protect 37 players and permit the rest to become free agents.
   The players association filed a federal lawsuit in 1987, accusing
the league and team owners of violating antitrust law by enforcing
the first refusal-compensation system after the expiration of the
1982 contract.
   The owners said they are exempt from antitrust law, arguing that
the old collective bargaining agreement still is valid. They said
the players union is trying to win in court what it was unable to
win at the bargaining table.
   U.S. District Judge David Doty of Minneapolis in 1988 ruled in
favor of the players, ordering a trial to determine whether the
owners were guilty of antitrust violations.
   But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Doty's
decision last November.
   In a 2-1 ruling, the appeals court said the league and owners
were exempt from antitrust law because of the previously negoiated
union contract.
   The players' choice now is between further negotiations or a
strike, the appeals court said. Permitting them to sue under such
circumstances would upset the ``level playing field'' created by
federal labor law, it added.
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Gerald W. Heaney said the appeals
court ruling ``permits the owners to violate the antitrust law
indefinitely.''
   The 8th Circuit court's decision was hailed by the owners as a
major victory that would spur the players to return to the
bargaining table.
   The players association responded by de-certifying itself as the
players bargaining agent, a move designed to nullify the 1982
contract and revive the antitrust suit.
   Nine current and former union officials substituted themselves
for the association in filing the appeal acted on today.
   They said the 8th Circuit court ruling amounts to ``a virtually
unlimited antitrust exemption for employers in unionized
industries.''
   Eight states supported the appeal, saying their efforts to
curtail anti-competitive behavior could be hampered by the appeals
court ruling. The states are New York, Arizona, Hawaii, Louisiana,
Michigan, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.
   The case is Powell vs. NFL, 89-1421.
