<LEADPARA>  HUDDLE up, female 49er Faithfuls. You can pass those bulky team jackets and
shapeless sweat shirts back to the guys. Come September, you'll be able to
declare your NFL team allegiance with a wardrobe designed exclusively for
women.;    For starters, there's a red and white leather jacket with gold
fringe, a mock turtleneck sweater, a fleece warm-up suit, a print pullover
with an abstract football player charging, and even a chic rain poncho so you
can say goodbye to the plastic garbage sacks on cold, rainy days in
Candlestick Park.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It's all part of the new NFL Spirit Actionwear for Women from the New
Jersey-based sweater company of Cliff Engle. Prices range from $60 for a
fleece pullover to $900 for the fringed leather jacket.;    Robert De Martino,
executive vice president of Cliff Engle, is projecting first-year retail sales
of $8 million to $9 million, rising to more than $50 million by the third
year. Future plans also call for expanding the NFL Spirit line into other
areas of women's clothing, including sleepwear and lingerie.;    De Martino
backs up his optimistic sales projections with a blast of statistics:;   
(check) "The NFL did $1.4 billion at retail in 1990, but not one dime was
spent on anything specifically manufactured for women.;    (check) "Forty-two
percent of everyone who watches or attends NFL games is a woman.;    (check)
"The NFL has a couple of official catalogs and 68 percent of purchases are
made by women. Of those, 86 percent are purchasing for themselves items like a
T-shirt or a team jacket. But until this point it's strictly a man's item and
they're wearing the same jacket a boyfriend or husband has.;    (check)
"Citibank issued Visa affinity cards (with NFL team logos) to 37,000 women in
their names only, not combined with a husband.;    "Somebody's been missing
the boat," De Martino concludes.;    Recognizing a market niche, De Martino
talked to NFL Properties, which handles licensing for all 28 teams. Cliff
Engle already held licenses for NFL men's shirts and sweaters, as well as
licenses for men's sweaters with the National Hockey League, Major League
Baseball and the National Basketball Association.;    The company hired Ruth
West, known within the fashion industry for her innovative designs at Ocean
Pacific, to design the first NFL Spirit collection. It was previewed at an NFL
Properties meeting for its 423 license holders and 600 retailers at the Super
Bowl.;    "We've shown the line to 52 retailers so far this year and we've
taken 52 orders," boasts De Martino. Bay Area stores that have placed orders
include Sports Fan, Macy's and Nordstrom.;    "We went fairly heavy with it,
mainly in Niners (colors)," says Bob Blonder, who ordered $86,000 worth of the
NFL Spirit line, including more than two dozen of the fringed jackets for his
10 Sports Fan stores.;    "I think it's going to sell pretty good, especially
at Christmas. A lot of husbands will buy it for their wives," Blonder says.;  
 To kick off the line, NFL Properties and Cliff Engle are launching a
cooperative $1 million advertising campaign featuring Jennifer Montana
modeling the 49er version of the $900 fringe jacket. That famous number 16
jersey is hanging behind her and the ad says "This Montana has a style all her
own.";    While it describes her as "wife of All-Pro 49er quarterback," it
fails to mention that quarterback's first name. The ads are now running in
trade journals such as Women's Wear Daily and in August will pop up in Elle,
Vogue, People, Cosmopolitan, Sports Illustrated, US and other magazines.;   
"Jennifer is the first lady of football, she's attractive and a former model
so it made a lot of sense and it's done incredible things for our sales (to
stores) in the Bay Area," says De Martino. However, he says he has contacted
both Candice Bergen and Jamie Lee Curtis, "who have more national appeal," for
possible future advertising campaigns.;    One obvious customer who hasn't
called is Eddie De Bartolo, owner of the 49ers and known for his gift-giving
when it comes to players' wives and girlfriends.;    "We haven't done anything
with the teams on a direct basis; we just haven't had time," De Martino says.
"From a selfish standpoint, what we're going to sell to teams doesn't make or
break us. It's more important to sell to established retail stores."  </TEXT>
