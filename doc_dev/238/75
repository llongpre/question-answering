Former Dallas Cowboys President Tex Schramm said today that although he would 
be reluctant to act as interim NFL commissioner, he would listen to whatever 
proposal the league owners might offer him while they search for a permanent 
successor to Pete Rozelle. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was announced this morning that three members of the dissident 
owners' faction will be included in the process of finding Rozelle's 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Both Schramm and former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach will be nominated 
for the commissioner's job Tuesday, when NFL owners gather in Chicago. (See 
Sports, Part III). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hedged on Response 
</P>
<P>
Staubach, in a statement released from his real estate office, said he has no 
desire to become commissioner. Schramm, however, hedged when asked if he might 
consider the job on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had 39 years of association with the National Football League," Schramm 
said. "It is by far the better part of my life. I have a tremendous emotional 
feeling as far as the league is concerned. I would do anything I could to help 
the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a search committee made up of veteran NFL owners 
recommended New Orleans President Jim Finks as the new commissioner. Eleven 
dissident owners abstained when Finks' name was put up for a vote, preventing 
him from obtaining the needed 19 votes. 
</P>
<P>
The dissidents were to meet tonight to ratify a plan that would allow them to 
get together with selection committee members Tuesday at the owners' meeting, 
originally called to announce plans for a new international spring league. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lynn, president of the Minnesota Vikings and one of the leaders of the 
dissident faction, said today that Finks continues to be an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, Lynn, Edward DeBartolo Jr. of San Francisco and Patrick 
Bowlen of Denver will meet with three members of the selection committee, 
headed by Wellington Mara of the New York Giants and Lamar Hunt of Kansas City. 
That meeting could take place Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Also included will be representatives of Heidrich and Struggles, the talent 
search firm that cut the list of candidates from 101 names at the start to six 
finalists and finally to Finks. The expanded group will look at the material 
that Heidrich and Struggles and the search committee used to arrive at the New 
Orleans president as its choice. 
</P>
<P>
Schramm, who left the Cowboys to become chief executive officer of the newly 
created World League of American Football, will attend Tuesday's owners' 
meeting in behalf of the new league. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flattered at Prospect 
</P>
<P>
Staubach, meanwhile, said although he is flattered at the prospect of having 
his name considered for commissioner, he would not accept the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great deal of gratitude and respect for the NFL, and it is an 
attractive thought to be considered for the commissioner," Staubach said. 
"However, at this time my life is consumed with building my real estate company 
on a national basis, and I am committed to this goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the challenge of the real estate business, and I am enjoying it. I will 
have to say, 'no.' "
