   The Federal Trade Commission is expected to accuse CBS Inc. of violating antitrust law during the network's 1987 negotiations with the National Football League for broadcast rights, say attorneys familiar with the issue. 

   After an 18-month investigation, the agency's staff has concluded that CBS improperly reduced competition through its effort to keep Fox Broadcasting Co. from winning the right to telecast Monday night football games, the attorneys said. 
The NFL and ABC, which ended up keeping the Monday night telecasts through the end of the 1989 season, aren't expected to be charged with any wrongdoing. 

   Commissioners today are scheduled to consider filing a formal complaint against CBS, along with a proposed consent decree settling the charges, according to government and industry officials. 
The proposed agreement would have CBS promise to refrain from anti-competitive activity in the future, and CBS wouldn't face additional legal action and wouldn't give up additional broadcast rights. 
The sources said the agreement has been approved in principle by the agency's staff and by network officials. 
But a CBS executive denied that and said, "We don't expect to enter into a consent decree. 
We will not." 

   The investigation has been watched closely by the networks, cable television companies and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee because it is likely to set a benchmark for antitrust enforcement involving NFL broadcasts. 

   Commissioners have been kept informed of the negotiations and are expected to go along with the staff's recommendation and announce the decision within the next few days, but they could demand some last-minute changes or order further legal analysis. 
FTC press officers declined to comment. 

   A CBS spokesman declined to comment on the status of the case. 
"There was an FTC investigation, and we cooperated fully," the spokesman said. 
"All we can say officially is the FTC has yet to rule on this." 

   Val Pinchbeck, the NFL's director of broadcasting, said the league also cooperated with the commission, adding that "we did nothing whatsoever that was wrong." 

   The investigation is bound to shake up the way the NFL and the networks negotiate future contracts. 
Today's closed-door meeting also may spell out for the first time whether the commission's strongly free-market oriented majority accepts earlier Justice Department interpretations that cable television isn't covered by an antitrust exemption that Congress granted to the NFL in 1961 permitting joint negotiations with CBS, ABC and NBC. 

   Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) warned the NFL during a congressional hearing last year that the league's bidding procedures and contacts with cable operators "might well violate the antitrust laws." 

   During the 1987 negotiations, Fox, a unit of News Corp., is believed to have outbid ABC for the Monday night games. 
Launching its effort to build a fourth network and eager to land the NFL games as an early sign of legitimacy, Fox reportedly bid $7 million for each Monday night telecast, compared with the $6.2 million to $6.5 million offered by ABC, now a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. 

   However, ABC sweetened its bid by having its 80%-owned cable channel, ESPN, agree to a three-year, $153 million contract with the NFL to carry certain games. 

   CBS isn't believed to have submitted a bid for the Monday night games. 
But persons familiar with the investigation said the commission, among other things, has been delving into whether CBS improperly interceded to help ABC by threatening or suggesting that it would renegotiate or back out of its own portion of the NFL's overall $1.4 billion broadcast package if Fox landed the Monday night rights. 

   Jamie Kellner, president of Fox Broadcasting, said the company never filed a complaint over the bidding outcome. 
But if the commission determines that "there's been wrong done, it's a different situation," he said. 
Mr. Kellner declined to elaborate what action Fox might consider. 

   Douglas Melamed, an attorney representing ABC and ESPN, declined to comment on the pending investigation, except to say that "neither ABC nor ESPN engaged in any improper or unlawful conduct."
