<HEAD>Tagliabue Named NFL Commissioner</HEAD>

   Lawyer Paul Tagliabue was elected commissioner
of the National Football League today to replace Pete Rozelle, who
said seven months ago that he wanted to retire.
   Owners of the 28 NFL franchises broke a deadlock over the
selection by appointing a five-man committee Wednesday night to
recommend a choice. Dan Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers, chairman
of the committee, said it unanimously recommended Tagliabue for a
five-year term.
   Tagliabue, 48, is an NFL counsel and has been a league insider
for 20 years.
   An early favorite for the job, New Orleans Saints president Jim
Finks, issued a statement congratulating Tagliabue.
   ``He will be an oustanding commissioner, and should serve the
NFL for many years to come,'' Finks said.
   Art Modell of the Cleveland Browns, a Finks supporter, said
Finks turned down an offer to be president of the NFL in charge of
football operations.
   ``The intention was to bring both Paul Tagliabue and Jim Finks
into leadership roles,'' Modell said.
   Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Association,
said players were glad to see the selection process completed. He
described Tagliabue as a problem solver.
   ``We've met in the antitrust arena and on issues including drug
testing,'' Upshaw said in Washington. ``I find him to be very
straightforward and he wants to solve problems. He understands
things have to be done and has never been opposed to taking action
to solve problems.''
   Tagliabue has left his Washington office for Cleveland when the
selection was announced and could not be reached for comment today.
