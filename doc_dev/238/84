</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago this week, Jim Finks, the pro football veteran who as president of 
the New Orleans Saints has run the franchise since the middle '80s, was 
apparently on his way to a bigger job -- running the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
On the last ballot, though, Paul Tagliabue edged him, putting Finks in a role 
as observer instead of manager. 
</P>
<P>
His assessment Monday of the man who beat him: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tagliabue is doing an outstanding job on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The commissioner has plenty to learn about public relations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all impressed with the energy and ability that Paul has shown in trying 
circumstances," Finks said. "He's really getting his arm around the job. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing he has to learn he will learn -- that everything a commissioner 
says is news. There's no such thing as a throwaway line by an NFL 
commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
Finks was referring to, among other things, three recent Tagliabue remarks 
delivered in a spirit of optimism and openness. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The NFL's owners could have a new collective bargaining agreement with the 
players before the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The league could expand from 28 to, say, 30 teams in the absence of a 
collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could expand to Canada someday. 
</P>
<P>
Such comments have generated dismay and dissent, requiring Tagliabue to change 
or modify his original positions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Canadian friends were on my phone within an hour after they heard 
(Tagliabue)," Finks said, noting that the owners of Canadian Football League 
teams want their country's largest cities to stay in their own league, not jump 
to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
As for pro football's labor problem, the NFL's owners say they haven't talked 
at all to the players lately about a collective bargaining agreement. Most 
owners, moreover, don't want to expand without one. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete (Rozelle) was awfully gifted at seeming to say a lot while actually 
saying almost nothing," Finks said, referring to Tagliabue's public 
relations-minded predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
"(Otherwise), I have been personally impressed by Paul's fast start. The thing 
we like about him is that he is very responsive to league problems." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Buck played his college football at the University of Maine, which is 
hardly an NFL factory. But Buck is the Saints' future, they're saying here. 
</P>
<P>
A rookie quarterback who stands 6 feet 3 and weighs 227, he apparently has the 
arm strength and accuracy the club needs to make a Super Bowl move someday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is the first qualified young prospect the Saints have had since we've 
been here," said Finks, the club president and a former NFL quarterback 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"But give him two years. I like to give any young quarterback a couple of years 
before you expect too much of him." 
</P>
<P>
So it will be at least that long before the Saints are a championship 
contender. With their present cast they can win games but not Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Six highly regarded teams might have seriously damaged their playoff chances 
Sunday by blowing their opening games. 
</P>
<P>
Few NFL teams win division titles after losing on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
That was notably true last season -- and also the year before -- when the six 
division champions each year all won the first week. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, since the league's 16-game schedule began in 1978, only 33 of 154 
opening-day losers have made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Among Sunday's losers were six preseason favorites: Minnesota, Philadelphia, 
Denver, Houston, San Diego and the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Among the winners were six teams that now have better chances: Washington, 
Atlanta, Cincinnati, Kansas City, the New York Giants and the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
On a day when the Chicago Bears' defense made Coach Mike Ditka a 17-0 winner 
over Seattle, the NFL's two run-and-shoot teams, Detroit and Houston, lost. 
</P>
<P>
"You've still got to have a tight end to win in this league," said Ditka, an 
old tight end himself. "The run and shoot will never make a believer of me 
until they win consistently." 
</P>
<P>
That is the Establishment view in the NFL. And in the first of 17 weeks of 1990 
pro football, it seemed clear to all the old pros in the country that what beat 
Detroit and Houston was their tight end void. 
</P>
<P>
There was considerable evidence Sunday, however, that it wasn't that. It wasn't 
the run-and-shoot machinery that broke down. 
</P>
<P>
The more probable reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Atlanta, where the Falcons won, 47-27, Coach Jerry Glanville was lucky 
to catch the Oilers on opening day, before they could sort out all the blocking 
variances of their run and shoot. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, any of the four Houston fumbles that moved Atlanta to its quick 
24-0 lead could have happened -- they have often happened on other days -- in 
the I-formation, or the single wing or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
When not fumbling, Houston quarterback Warren Moon led all of Sunday's NFL 
passers with 397 yards and threw four times for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Detroit, where the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won, 38-21, quarterback Vinny 
Testaverde finally played the game his admirers have been awaiting for four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
One explanation is that the Buccaneers are finally teaming him with an 
extraordinary talent, former Charger runner-receiver Gary Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde and Anderson won by keeping the ball away from Detroit's run and 
shoot in the last three quarters -- holding possession for 30 minutes 49 
seconds to Detroit's 15:21 -- after quarterback Rodney Peete had marched the 
Lions 80 and 73 yards to a 14-7 lead in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the New York Giants, beating the division-rival Philadelphia Eagles proved 
impossible last year, and also the year before. 
</P>
<P>
After four big games by their quarterback, Randall Cunningham, the Eagles stood 
4-0 in their last four against the Giants going into Sunday night's rematch at 
East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
But last week the Giants made an inspired move. When the Eagles unloaded backup 
quarterback Matt Cavanaugh and his $510,000 salary, the Giants promptly signed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
They gained a prompt dividend on the $510,000, beating the Eagles this time, 
27-20. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wanted a spy, we could get one a lot cheaper than that," Giant General 
Manager George Young protested. 
</P>
<P>
Cheaper? Sure. But better? 
</P>
<P>
The backup quarterback is the best informed agent on any club, bar the starter, 
maybe, and a few coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not naive enough not to know (the Giants) would ask me some questions," 
Cavanaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh is a 13-year pro. The moral for the Eagles, perhaps, is that it would 
be a good idea next time to dismiss experienced backups before training camp, 
not after. 
</P>
<P>
Quote Dept.: 
</P>
<P>
David Meggett, the Giants' 178-pound running back, after his second long punt 
return in consecutive regular-season games had knocked the Eagles back in the 
third quarter, 20-10: "I don't know if it was a turning point, but it put a 
heavy weight on those guys to carry." 
</P>
<P>
Lindy Infante, Green Bay coach, on how he got to the Packers: "If I didn't have 
two good years as a Cleveland (assistant), I wouldn't be here. Bernie (Kosar) 
is probably the reason I have the job." 
</P>
<P>
Agent Mike Moye after Miami lineman Cortez Kennedy signed with Seattle for a 
reported $6.5 million for five years, $2.5 million of it as a signing bonus: 
"(Kennedy) is the highest-paid rookie defensive back in the history of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Walsh, NBC analyst, on Bear Coach Mike Ditka's relationships with his 
players: "You can only be real severe when you know the (players) can do 
everything you ask. When they (can't), you have to be real careful of affecting 
their confidence when shaking them up." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kazor, the Bears' tight end coach, on Ditka: "If I had a dollar for every 
time (Ditka) cussed me out, I wouldn't be here. It would be like winning the 
Lotto." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Henning, San Diego coach, on the NFL: "Your lock on a job in this league is 
only as strong as a locksmith's. A locksmith is a guy who comes in and cuts the 
lock." 
</P>
<P>
Don Shula, Miami coach, after running back Sammie Smith had gained 159 yards -- 
behind the blocking of No. 1 draft choice Richmond Webb and No. 2 draft choice 
Keith Sims -- as the Dolphins overcame New England, 27-24: "Our two rookies are 
going to be extremely good players. I wish that were the biggest of my 
worries."
