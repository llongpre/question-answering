<LEADPARA>  MOTHERS Against Drunk Driving (MADD) has commended Commissioner Paul Tagliabue
and the National Football League for recognizing drunken driving as a serious
offense -- one for which pro football players could be penalized if they are
convicted.;    In the past, the NFL has suspended players after a second
violation of its substance abuse policy. The revised policy for 1991 will
enable the league to suspend players after an initial drug or alcohol-related
violation of the law.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Alcohol is a drug," said MADD National President Micky Sadoff.
"Professional athletes serve as role models for young people and for a player
to be convicted of a drunk-driving offense and not receive any kind of
reprimand from the league sends a mixed message to society.";    Sadoff said
MADD wrote to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue in early 1990 encouraging the
league to examine the public image being portrayed by professional athletes
who had been charged with driving while intoxicated. The letter, sparked by
several drunken driving incidents involving NFL players, asked the league to
develop a policy to deal with this behavior.;    According to Greg Aiello, an
NFL representative, the commissioner will review the facts of any
alcohol-related incident and the player will be offered a hearing before
disciplinary action is imposed. The penalty will depend on whether the
conviction is a felony or misdemeanor; if other people were injured by the
player's conduct; and if there is a history of drug or alcohol-related
misconduct by the player.;    "We hope the NFL's decision to include drunk
driving in the same category as drug abuse will set an example to the other
professional sports leagues. It's illegal to drive while intoxicated and it's
illegal to drink if you're under 21," Sadoff said.;    About half of all fatal
traffic crashes last year were alcohol-related, totaling more than 22,000
deaths. Another 345,000 people were injured in such crashes and about 1.8
million people were arrested for driving while intoxicated.  </TEXT>
