NEWSWIRE: NFL SUSPENDS SAINTS' WARREN FOR DRUG USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defensive end Frank Warren, coming off the best of his nine seasons with the 
New Orleans Saints, was suspended from the NFL for at least a year Monday after 
testing positive for drugs a third time. 
</P>
<P>
The league's three-violation policy was established in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A first violation is kept confidential, a second means suspension for four 
weeks and a third-time violator is suspended for life with the option to 
reapply in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Warren, 6 feet 4 and 290 pounds, was never suspended as a two-time violator, 
and there was no explanation of that. 
</P>
<P>
NFL spokesman Jim Heffernan said he did not know when the second or third 
violations occurred. Team officials refused to provide the details and Warren 
did not return telephone calls.
