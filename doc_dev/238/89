TOO NOISY CHEERING WILL BRING PENALTIES

<P>
If you're planning to see a pro football game next fall, be careful when and 
how you cheer, and how long. And how loud. 
</P>
<P>
Noticeably noisy cheering -- at the wrong time -- could bring a penalty of 50 
yards or more against the home team. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the 28 National Football League clubs decided that at the winter 
meetings at Palm Desert Tuesday, when they empowered their officiating crews to 
penalize teams for overzealous crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Referees were authorized to confiscate timeouts or, if necessary, walk off 
penalties against teams whose cheering fans raise the noise level to a pitch 
that disrupts the other team's communications. 
</P>
<P>
At the Seattle Kingdome, for instance, visiting quarterbacks have for years 
complained that their teammates often couldn't hear the signals in the din. 
</P>
<P>
But until now, the NFL has maintained that anti-rabble legislation was 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
As Tex Schramm of the Dallas Cowboys, chairman of the league's competition 
committee, used to say: "You can penalize teams and players -- but not crowds." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's legislation -- approved by a 21-7 vote -- was unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ram Coach John Robinson: "It isn't a bad precedent to ensure the normal 
functioning of a game. The colleges have a rule like this." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL rule provides for an unlimited number of yards penalized. Although 
football teams and players can be penalized a maximum of 15 yards for even the 
most flagrant foul, a crowd that refuses to quiet down could draw a penalty of 
50 or 90 yards or even more. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually (from the five-yard line in) it would be only half the distance of 
the field," Schramm said. "So you could never score a touchdown (on the 
penalty)." 
</P>
<P>
Two competition committee spokesmen, Schramm and Miami Coach Don Shula, 
outlined a three-step, noisy-stadium procedure: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The referee will first advise the fans and the defensive players that there 
will be a penalty unless the clamor abates. 
</P>
<P>
If it doesn't, he will take away one or more timeouts -- assuming the home team 
hasn't used them all. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Then he will penalize the home team five yards at a time as long as 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, one lost timeout, or one penalty, will be enough," Schramm said. 
"The timeouts will go first because most coaches would rather take a penalty 
than lose a timeout." Shula, representing the coaches, approved of the rule. 
</P>
<P>
"The offenses are so sophisticated now that they can operate with hand signals 
in a noisy stadium," he said. "But the problem is that this limits what you can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL conceded that the rule violates the free speech amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a slight infringement," Schramm said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, many sports fans have breached the same precept. 
</P>
<P>
"They have prevented the offensive teams from being able to communicate," Shula 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The league's battle against fake injuries took the form of a statement by the 
competition committee, unopposed by the convention, recommending fines and 
suspensions -- and in serious cases loss of draft choices -- for clubs, coaches 
and even physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Two members of the committee, Schramm and Shula, urged the NFL's referees to 
assume that in any instance, a stricken player is injured, even if he has taken 
two or three previous dives, but to put in motion strong disciplinary measures 
if they "sense a pattern" of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was a response to a widely publicized incident last year when the 
Seattle Seahawks were accused of faking injuries six times in one game to foil 
the Cincinnati Bengals' no-huddle offense. 
</P>
<P>
That offense is entirely legal, the competition committee ruled, supporting 
Commissioner Pete Rozelle's position. 
</P>
<P>
Will a mere statement slow the feigning of injuries? 
</P>
<P>
"I think this will stop it," Schramm said. 
</P>
<P>
The league also modified its rule against roughing the passer, enjoining 
rushers from heading for a quarterback's knee when they have a clear path in. 
</P>
<P>
The new language is designed to prevent attacks such as that of Philadelphia's 
Andre Waters on the Rams' Jim Everett last year. 
</P>
<P>
Waters said afterward that he got the only part of Everett he could reach. And 
to some observers, that's the way it looked. 
</P>
<P>
Among others on the competition committee, Shula, however, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"He was obviously going for the knee," Shula said.
