   Every time the National Football
League's stars butt heads on network television, Julie Nimmons
says, her company is being thrown for a loss.
   She is president of Schutt Athletic Sales Co., which had
supplied 40 percent of the helmets used by NFL players until this
year, when the NFL's licensing arm signed an agreement with her
prime competitor, Chicago-based Riddell Inc.
   In an agreement with the NFL, Riddell is making helmets,
shoulder pads and other gear available to the league's 28 teams for
free if 90 percent of a team's players use its helmets. Players who
wear helmets by other companies must conceal those companies' logos.
   That agreement has landed the two companies in the Chicago
courtroom of U.S. District Judge James Zagel, where lawyers for
Schutt argued at a trial in September that Riddell has violated
federal antitrust laws. A decision is pending.
   ``Other people want to emulate their heroes,'' Mrs. Nimmons
said. ``They will use what their heroes use.''
   She said her central Illinois-based company could be forced out
of business by the agreement, which she says hurts its sales of
helmets to college and high school football teams.
   But David Kagan, an attorney for Riddell, said football helmets
aren't ``impulse'' items that coaches or equipment managers would
buy after glimpsing the helmets during televised NFL games.
   ``No one has ever tried to advertise football helmets on TV like
you would dishwashing detergent or bubble gum, because no one is
interested in that sort of thing,'' Kagan said. ``You would no more
advertise a football helmet than you would a B-1 bomber.''
   No money is involved in the Riddell-NFL deal. Riddell is gaining
exposure that might help the company launch a line of running shoes
and sportswear, Kagan said.
   Mrs. Nimmons contends that exposure is worth $750,000 a game or
$12 million a season _ the amount her company would have to pay for
television advertising during NFL games to match Riddell's air time.
   That is more than her company's annual gross receipts from
helmet sales, she said.
   Schutt, the nation's second-largest manufacturer of football
helmets, is privately held and Mrs. Nimmons declined to provide an
exact sales figure.
   Fortune magazine estimated Riddell's annual sales at $20 million
for 1988. Riddell officials did not return repeated phone calls.
   Frank Vuono, vice president of NFL Properties, which handles the
league's licensing rights, said the NFL hooked up with Riddell
because the company has been a licensee of NFL Properties for
years. A licensee has the right to market helmets with clubs' names
on them.
   ``Riddell has always provided good service to the clubs, and
it's not much of a change in the status quo,'' he said.
   In the last 10 years, the number of major football helmet
companies has dropped from 18 to three because of lawsuits over
helmet safety, Mrs. Nimmons said. The other major manufacturer is
BSN Corp.
   That trend has helped drive helmet prices higher, said John
Horan, editor of Sporting Goods Management News.
   ``A coach is probably paying $120 for a helmet that, taking away
the insurance and given a competitive situation, would probably
cost a fraction of that,'' Horan said.
   Deals like Riddell's will only push the price higher, Mrs.
Nimmons said.
   ``The cost of providing all those free goods will be borne by
the consumer,'' she said. ``All of a sudden the poor guy is paying
for the rich guy to get free stuff.''
