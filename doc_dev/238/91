   WASHINGTON -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
charged the National Football League with "a very personal
foul," alleging age discrimination against a veteran referee.
   The EEOC filed suit in federal district court in New York
against the NFL, claiming it discriminated against Benjamin
Dreith by demoting him because of his age from referee to a
line judge in February 1990. In addition, the league refused
to renew his contract after last year's football season. Mr.
Dreith is now 66 years old.

   The agency also contends the NFL, since at least September
1987, has carried out an "unlawful employment practice" of
subjecting officials who are over 60 to greater scrutiny of
their job performance. Moreover, it said the league puts
pressure on game officials to retire or take an off-the-field
job, such as working in the television instant-replay booth,
when they turn 60.
   The EEOC sought reinstatement as a referee with back pay
for Mr. Dreith. It also asked the court to provide similar
relief for any other NFL official affected by the policy and
to stop its alleged practice of discriminating against
employees over 60. The agency noted that Congress has
prohibited any mandatory retirement age.
   Mr. Dreith has been a visible, sometimes colorful, NFL
referee -- the top on-the-field assignment for officials --
since the early 1960s. Well-respected by many football fans,
his most notable performance came several years ago after a
scuffle between New York Jets defensive lineman Marty Lyons
and Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly. Mr. Lyons had
tackled Mr. Kelly, who pushed Mr. Lyons, who then slugged Mr.
Kelly.
   On national television, Mr. Dreith announced a penalty
against the Jets lineman. Holding out his arm and flailing it
downward in a clubbing motion, Mr. Dreith, in a deep voice,
declared a personal foul against "No. 93 on the defense, down
there giving him the business."
   NFL referees, like players, are evaluated as to their
"performance and competence on the field," according to
league spokesman Joe Brown. He said the NFL is looking
forward to explaining to the court Mr. Dreith's "so-called
demotion," adding that it isn't unusual for game officials to
switch to or from referee jobs and that pay is based only on
years of experience, not position. He said the league doesn't
have a retirement policy based on age. The NFL, he said,
currently has 107 game officials, including 11 who are in
their 60s.
   EEOC regional attorney James Lee said, however, that Mr.
Dreith has been given high ratings by the NFL and that he
"was performing better than some of his counterparts." Mr.
Dreith has passed his NFL physicals, Mr. Lee indicated.
   He also said that Art McNally, head of officials for the
NFL, has said in writing that age is a consideration in
deciding when game officials should retire.
