NEWSWIRE: SCHRAMM TO HEAD NFL'S INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tex Schramm, the architect of "America's team," took on the job of 
transplanting the interest in the National Football League overseas when he 
resigned Tuesday as president of the Dallas Cowboys to head the experimental 
International Football League. 
</P>
<P>
The man who ran the Cowboys for all of their first 29 years turned in his 
resignation on the day NFL owners unanimously approved the sale of the 
franchise to Arkansas oilman Jerry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Although it appeared to be an amicable parting -- "We're flying back to Dallas 
together," Schramm said -- there was no alternative because Jones has taken 
over control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I still wanted to make something work with Jerry after that happened," Schramm 
said. "But I had to be realistic. Nothing was going to be the same and I had to 
move on." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL hopes that the new league will popularize the sport around the world 
while serving as a feeder league.
