The NFL owners, still following where Commissioner Paul Tagliabue leads, made a 
new effort Tuesday to shorten the overall time period of their 60-minute game. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the new commissioner's priorities. An average NFL game last 
season ran 3 hours 11 minutes, which was, in his view, much too long. 
</P>
<P>
"(The NFL) needs a three-hour game," Tagliabue said. "And the action we took 
today will move us in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
The action: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The clubs voted to pare NFL halftimes from 15 minutes to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And they voted to save another five or six minutes by getting the game 
clock going sooner in selected situations. 
</P>
<P>
A football clock doesn't run continuously. It is stopped when, for instance, 
the ball goes out of bounds, or when a penalty is called, or after kickoff 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
And for years in NFL games, it hasn't been restarted until the center snapped 
the ball to the quarterback for the next play. 
</P>
<P>
To save time this season, the game clock will be restarted when the referee 
gives his familiar ready signal -- instead of on the snap -- on three kinds of 
occasions: after a player goes out of bounds, after a declined penalty and 
after kickoff returns. 
</P>
<P>
The only exceptions, the NFL decided late Tuesday, will come in the final two 
minutes of the first half and the final five minutes of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
In another change, the 30-second clock will become a 25-second clock this 
season, matching the time allowed for college teams to put the ball in play. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue appointed a new realignment-expansion committee to go to work on one 
of the league's most difficult problems. 
</P>
<P>
It is a committee of the whole -- consisting of the chairmen of the league's 
top committees -- plus Tagliabue, who said he will be the chairman of the 
chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, the NFL has expanded two cities at a time," Tagliabue said. "I 
would expect that we'll add two teams within two years or so, giving us 15 
teams in each of two conferences, with five teams in each division." 
</P>
<P>
Realignment, however, will not come until at least 1994, and it hasn't happened 
since 1969, when Pete Rozelle settled the infighting with a blind lottery.
