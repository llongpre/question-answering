<TEXT>     Justice Department lawyers said the case could have sweeping impact for
collective bargaining nationwide, particularly in other professional sports
and for the entertainment industry.;    The case stems from a 24-day strike in
1987 by the National Football League Players Association.;    The strike ended
without a new contract between the players and the league's 28 team owners.
But the owners continued to enforce an expired contract, signed in 1982,
containing provisions that restrict free agency.;    The provisions limit a
player's ability to negotiate and sign with a new team. The player's original
team is given the right to match a competing club's offer.;    If the original
team declines to match the offer, the player's new team must compensate the
other team with draft choices.; Dick MacPherson, the coach at Syracuse the
past 10 seasons and a former NFL assistant, was named today as coach of the
New England Patriots, the league's worst team.;    He succeeds Rod Rust, who
was fired last Friday after the team went 1-15 in its only season under him.; 
  MacPherson, the Patriots' third head coach in three years, was hired to
restore a winning record to the franchise.  </TEXT>
