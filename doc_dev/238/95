   The National Football League seems to be living
proof that the rich keep getting richer.
   The league's television income soared to nearly $3 billion on
Thursday when CBS agreed to a four-year contract that maintains its
Sunday NFL package. The deal, which cost the network $1.06 billion,
or $265 million a year, includes rights to the 1992 Super Bowl in
Minneapolis.
   ``We are tremendously pleased to continue our 34-year
association with the NFL and NFC games,'' CBS Sports president Neal
Pilson said. ``Retaining our Sunday package was a key element in
our long-term corporate strategy of providing broadcast coverage of
dominant sports franchises.''
   No matter, apparently, what it costs.
   Pilson had previously dipped into the CBS coffers for $1.06
billion for four years of baseball, $1 billion for seven years of
the NCAA basketball tournament and $543 million for the next two
Winter Olympics.
   The CBS contract followed the NFL's $900 million deal with ABC
for the Monday night package, an extra tier of playoff games which
the league provided, and the silver anniversary Super Bowl at Tampa
in 1991.
   As appetizers for those two fancy network agreements, NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue and his television negotiators
completed twin $450 million cable contracts with ESPN and TBS for
Sunday night games.
   Still to be heard from is NBC, locked in negotiations for its
piece of the NFL pie following expiration of its three-year, $360
million deal.
   Including the NBC pact, which the Wall Street Journal reported
could be signed as early as today, the NFL could reap some $3.6
billion in total for four years of television rights _ a 90 percent
jump over the annual cost of the previous football contracts.
   Consider the increases in fees the league has already forged.
Under its previous deal, ABC paid $120 million a year. That's gone
up to $237.5 million per year in the new contract.
   CBS previously had a three-year, $450 million contract. The
price tag on the current contract amounts to a 76 percent increase.
   ESPN was paying $150 million for 24 regular season games and
three Pro Bowls. Now, with TBS added to the equation, cable
television antes up six times that figure.
