   ESPN Inc. said it scored its highest rating ever with its first telecast of a National Football League game Sunday night. 

   Based on ESPN's subscriber base of 42.8 million homes, the pre-season game between the Chicago Bears and the Miami Dolphins received an 8.9 rating and was watched in 3.8 million homes. 
ESPN's previous record was 8.0, for a 1985 college basketball game between Georgetown University and St. John's University. 
Each rating point equals 1% of the homes receiving ESPN broadcasts. 

   The overall rating, based on the 87.4 million U.S. homes with television sets, was 4.4, but ESPN doesn't recognize that number because cable is available in slightly less than half of those homes. 

   The network, which is 80%-owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc., paid $153 million over three years to win an intense bidding contest and become the first cable outlet for NFL games. 
This year, it will air four pre-season and eight regular season games, as well as the Pro Bowl, the league's all-star game. 

   The Sunday rating far exceeded the network's projection of a 5 rating for the pre-season games. 
ESPN has projected a 10 rating for the regular season games. 
As part of its contract with the NFL, the game also was broadcast on over-the-air stations in Chicago and Miami, where an additional 1.2 million homes tuned in, an ESPN spokesman said.
