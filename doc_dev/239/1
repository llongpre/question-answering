<LEADPARA>  KEVIN Costner's Robin Hood might as well hang up his quiver and bow. Thelma
Dickinson and Louise Sawyer, from Nowheresville, Ark., have gotten the drop on
him as the summer's first honest-to-gosh folk heroes.;    The unlikely
fugitives, played to a fare-thee-well by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, ride
a wave of violence and dumb luck to become the objects of a three-state police
chase in "Thelma &amp; Louise" (opening today).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     En route to their place as cinema legends, these armed-and-defiant best
buddies thumb their noses at sexist scum everywhere and embrace in a show of
sisterhood. When things are looking very bleak and the cops are closing fast,
the initially timid Thelma gets this wild look in her eyes and confesses, "I
don't ever remember feelin' this awake.";    Directed without a single false
move by Ridley ("Alien") Scott from an original script by Callie Khouri, "T&amp;L"
is a road movie in the noblest sense of the term. It combines elements from
"Bonnie and Clyde" and "Easy Rider" to chart the spiritual awakening of a pair
of closet outlaws. Kept under thumb too long, they finally blurt out the
equivalent of "We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take it anymore!";   
And what ticks off these modern-day Bonnie Parkers? Simple answer: Dumb men.
Longer answer: Louise's musician boyfriend who, after all these years, still
doesn't know how to commit, and Thelma's slob of a car-salesman husband,
Jimmy. These guys have made an art of humoring and humiliating "the little
woman.";    Which is why Louise, a chain-smoking waitress, and Thelma, a
chirpy homemaker, have packed up Louise's blue Thunderbird convertible and
planned a two-day fishing trip. (The irony: At this juncture they only know
how to "drop out" in male terms.);    Women on the run; The friends' first pit
stop is a bad one. Thelma is nearly raped by a honky-tonk Casanova and Louise
rides to the rescue. What the assailant doesn't count on is Louise's pent-up
hatred for men in general. He pays the supreme price and our heroines are
suddenly fugitives -- on the run from the law as well as their old lives.;   
And as they high-tail it to Texas and beyond, their characters merge and
evolve: Louise begins to relax and savor the new-found freedom; the
once-flighty, uptight Thelma discovers untapped reserves of rebellion, as well
as a natural talent for convenience-store stickups. "I know it's crazy, but I
just feel like I got a knack for this s---," Thelma squeals as Louise guns the
getaway car.;    "Thelma &amp; Louise," set to a slide-guitar score by the
prolific Hans Zimmer, is an easy film to dismantle. There will be those who
point to its severe credibility gap, arguing that two women in a blue vintage
T-bird would be as easy to spot as Santa Claus in August. Others will argue
that Scott conveniently sidesteps the violent fallout of his situation by
repeatedly doubling back into hangdog farce. (Easy laughs abound, including a
running joke about a lecherous truck driver who finally gets his
comeuppance.);    Danger and humor; Both criticisms are legitimate. "Thelma &amp;
Louise" only works if you buy into Scott's intermingling of danger and humor,
feminist posturing and wacky asides. He isn't after something like Terrence
Malick's "Badlands" or Arthur Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde," both of which deal in
escalating violence. "T&amp;L" is closer in tone to Steven Spielberg's "Sugarland
Express," with Goldie Hawn leading half the state police in Texas on a merry
chase.;    Sarandon and Davis are perfect in the leads. Sarandon is the earthy
anchor, the moody older woman who expects, and finds, the worst in everyone.
Davis is even better in a performance that far outshines her Oscar-winning
work in "The Accidental Tourist." Her Thelma is every pent-up kid on his or
her first joyride. She's a kook and a flirt who, we soon discover, is as
combustible as liquid TNT.;    As for the good ol' boys who pass through our
heroines' lives, they may, for the most part, be underhanded rats, but they're
memorable underhanded rats. Christopher McDonald is hilarious as Thelma's
husband; Brad Pitt steals every one of his scenes as a suspiciously
accommodating hitchhiker whom Thelma cuddles like a stray pup; and Harvey
Keitel, now also in "Mortal Thoughts," turns in what may be his most likable
performance to date as a cop. who secretly empathizes with the women.;   
"Thelma &amp; Louise" is quirky, exuberant fun -- a bit of feminist
wish-fulfillment with the hypnotic sweep of "Easy Rider" and the smarts never
to take itself too seriously.; Thelma &amp; Louise; (star)(star)(star);  Rated: R
(for violence, profanity);    Cast: Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis;    Director:
Ridley Scott;    Writer: Callie Khouri  </TEXT>
