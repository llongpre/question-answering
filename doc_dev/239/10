<LEADPARA>  YO, BRO, catch this.;   "Livin' Large," which bum rushes theaters today, is
about an Atlanta homeboy named Dexter, played by Terrence "T.C." Carson. What
he wants to be is the Man. At least, he wants to be the man on the TV news.
But he talks like a rapper. He dresses funky. And no way are they putting that
on the white man's show.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But then our homeboy gets film of himself breaking up a hostage situation.
And suddenly the white folks think he's def and give him a job.;   They also
give him a make-over. And Dexter begins to talk a tad differently. His clothes
take on that ever-so-starched Brooks Brothers look. He seems to be turning
just a touch -- dare we say it? -- Caucasian.;   Dexter's friends warn him
that he's changing. But he likes what he sees. He likes the fat salary, the
perks, the stardom and the penthouse apartment in Whyteman Towers. And when
Kate, the ravenous executive producer (Blanche Baker), steers him away from
investigative reporting in favor of slash-and-burn attacks on the black
community, he happily goes along.;   There's a great idea for satire here. TV
news is an easy target, but it's still fun to hit it squarely. A reporter at
the station is killed in the line of duty -- and is posed tenderly in
hisREVIEW; casket clutching a microphone. The executive producer loads the
shows with stories on UFOs and Siamese twins. Flashy graphics rule the day.
When Kate proposes a particularly bizarre ratings ploy, even Dexter draws back
in horror. "You're joking," he says. "I never joke about ratings," she
replies.;   Apart from the reheated "Network" jokes, there's also a very real
story here about assimilation, and fitting in, and whether it's truly
desirable to cater to a majority just to get ahead. It's nice to see that
addressed, even in passing.;   But then recent films made for young black
audiences seem more serious than the films being made for primarily young
white audiences. Black teens see themselves up on the screen in "House Party"
and "Boyz N The Hood." White teens see themselves getting speared by Freddy.
Black teen-agers can see inventive movies by John Singleton and Charles Lane.
White teen-agers are given movies by John Hughes, who has been making films
about Chicago for more than 15 years and still can't find a black
neighborhood.;   "Livin' Large" has the chance to tell an interesting story
about prejudice. But then it sabotages itself. And the weapon is its own
casual, clumsy racism.;   Dexter doesn't just try to be white. He becomes
white. His nose becomes aquiline. His eyes turn blue. His hair turns blond.
It's the old horror film transformation, only this time it's "An American
Honky in Atlanta." In a kind of climax midway through the film, he even
forgets how to dance.;   Some of this is funny. But the transformation --
which only Dexter can see, on television -- becomes more pronounced every time
he does something underhanded, or callous, or cruel. And the Dorian White
message becomes uncomfortably clear: Be evil, turn Caucasian.;   Is that kind
of message acceptable in a satire? Would it be acceptable if this were a film
about business executives, and every time the characters did something
unethical they looked a little more Asian? Or Arab? Or whoever we're supposed
to be hating at the moment?;   Maybe it's a minor point. Whites, after all,
are a majority in the United States. They don't face systemized racism. They
haven't had to suffer through 70-odd years of Hollywood stereotyping.;   But
any stereotype is hurtful, and the film indulges in a lot of them. In pure
"Sanford and Son" style, all black women are hellions, all black men are
comical, all white men are clowns or ineffectual drunks and all white women
are manipulative monsters.;   The film was directed by the veteran Michael
Schultz, who should know better, and is acted largely by a cast of novices.
Carson is winning as Dexter Jackson, and Nathaniel "Afrika" Hall is fine as
his friend, Baker. Lisa Arrindell has a kind of sweet intensity as Dexter's
fiance, Toynelle -- she's so good she seems to be in a different movie.;  
Baker -- the adult daughter of '50s sex symbol Carroll Baker -- plays the
executive producer with clenched teeth and barely suppressed sexuality. She
doesn't just chew the scenery, she cuts it up with a knife and fork and washes
it down with the supporting cast. It's the kind of performance that's
absolutely wrong for satire, which needs to be played very seriously and
straight to be funny at all.;   But then a number of things in this movie are
very wrong.;   Livin' Large; (star) 1/2; Rated: R (profanity, sexual
encounters); Cast: Terrence "T.C." Carson, Lisa Arrindell, Blanche Baker,
Nathaniel "Afrika" Hall; Director: Michael Schultz; Writer: William Mosely
Payne; Running Time: 1 hour, 36 minutes  </TEXT>
