   Richard Maltby Jr. and David Shire think of
``Closer Than Ever,'' their off-Broadway hit now on view at the
Cherry Lane Theater, as a collection of musical short stories.
   It's not a musical revue and not a book musical, but 25 musical
numbers about contemporary people and the things they do and the
things they feel.
   ``The characters are more three-dimensional than you usually
find in a revue,'' says Shire, the curly haired, soft-spoken half
of the songwriting team. ``And the stories are thematically
related.''
   ``You find yourself moved the way that you would be moved at a
musical or a play,'' Maltby adds. ``I don't know anybody who ever
was moved by a revue. It's not the hallmark of revues to get your
emotions.''
   The four performers _ Brent Barrett, Sally Mayes, Richard Muenz
and Lynne Wintersteller _ sing their hearts out.
   In one wistful song called ``My Life,'' a woman reflects on what
has happened to her failed marriage and faltering career. In
another, a man sings about himself, ``One of the Good Guys,'' who
thinks about the possibility of an affair but keeps true to his
marriage. In a third, ``If I Sing,'' a son pays homage to his
father, thanking him for the success he has had in life.
   Much of the revue started about five years ago as an ``urban
file'' in Maltby's home computer. At the time, the lyricist began
saving notes and jottings from conversations with friends _ most of
them in their late 40s.
   ``They were primarily stories our friends had told us about
their lives,'' Maltby was saying the other day. He thought they
might make interesting subject matter for songs.
   At the same time, Shire, who lives part of the year in
California, bought new synthesizer equipment that he planned to use
for film scoring, something he has done a lot of in movieland.
   ``When I got these new toys, I went into a real improvisational
binge to try them out,'' the composer says. ``Because they were
high-tech, I was playing around with urban sounds. Richard had
said, `Think urban.' So I opened up a computer file in my sequencer
and collected a lot of music.''
   Out of their collaboration came the songs for ``Urban Blight,''
a small revue about the perils of living in New York. The show,
which also had sketches by such established playwrights as
Christopher Durang, Wendy Wasserstein and Terrence McNally, had a
short run at the Manhattan Theater Club.
   But the performers were more actors than singers. Both Maltby
and Shire felt the songs' full potential hadn't been tapped and
wanted to use them again. Some ended up in ``Closer Than Ever.''
   Other songs for ``Closer Than Ever'' were orphans from ``Baby,''
the duo's one Broadway musical that had a seven-month run during
the 1983-84 season.
   ``Twelve songs wound up in `Baby,''' Shire says, ``But we wrote
approximately 50. Some of them deserved to be put away forever.
Others were redundant, but there were three or four which we were
quite proud of and the plot ultimately didn't have room for.''
   Material from ``Baby'' and five songs from ``Urban Blight,''
plus what Shire calls ``odds and ends,'' were ultimately pulled
together by Maltby's assistant, a young director named Steven Scott
Smith, for an evening of entertainment called ``Next Time Now.'' It
was performed last spring by three singers at a New York cabaret
spot called Eighty-Eights. The response was good enough to
encourage further work.
   That refinement occurred at the Williamstown Festival in
Massachusetts in July when Maltby came aboard as co-director of the
show. New songs were written and one more performer added.
   ``A lot of the songs are related to things in our life,'' Shire
says. ``Our work since `Baby' has tended to be more personal, the
things we are feeling and what our friends are feeling. Our
experiences with our wives, our fathers or with fatherhood, for
example.''
   ``And what could have been a grab bag of material turned into an
evening of portraits, a collection of self-contained songs,''
Maltby says.
   Maltby and Shire have been writing together for more than 30
years. They met as freshmen at Yale. Both had musical backgrounds _
their fathers were both bandleaders.
   Musical theater fans know their earlier revue ``Starting Here,
Starting Now,'' which had a short run off-Broadway in 1977. The
show, mostly songs from unproduced Maltby-Shire musicals, became a
cult favorite, thanks to a recording by RCA Victor and numerous
productions around the country. RCA has recorded ``Closer Than
Ever'' in its entirety and will release it in January.
   The two men have also worked separately and with others.
   Maltby was the director of the hit Fats Waller revue ``Ain't
Misbehavin''' and was co-lyricist for ``Miss Saigon,'' London's
newest musical smash which is expected on Broadway in the fall. He
has also written the lyrics for ``Nick and Nora,'' a musical
version of ``The Thin Man,'' also due in New York next season.
   Shire has written scores for more than 40 movies, including
``The Conversation,'' ``All the President's Men'' and ``Farewell,
My Lovely.'' He also picked up an Oscar as composer of the song
``It Goes Like It Goes'' from ``Norma Rae.'' And he's currently
working on a stage adaptation of Joseph Heller's novel, ``God
Knows,'' with Joseph Stein and Barry Harman.
   Still, they have always come back to work with each other.
   ``We've worked every way possible, but mainly sitting together
in rooms for very long periods of time being each other's gadfly,
cheering section and artistic conscience,'' Shire says. ``We throw
away a lot of each other's material.''
   Maltby and Shire worked on ``Closer Than Ever'' right up to its
opening in November, adding a new song shortly before previews
started and carefully going over lyrics to existing ones.
   ``Truthfully, most of the songs never have a moment when they
are done,'' Maltby says. ``There just is a moment when you stop
working on them. Then suddenly, you go into rehearsal and somewhere
along the way you realize they are in the show.''
