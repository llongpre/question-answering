Steven Bauer is wasted in the silly, old-fashioned 1984 Thief of Hearts 
(Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) as a sleek San Francisco burglar who falls for a 
high-tech interior designer (Barbara Williams) when he reads the drivel in her 
stolen diaries. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Apted's well-made but thin 1984 Firstborn (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) 
finds Teri Garr's vulnerable, well-fixed divorcee falling for an 
all-too-obviously dangerous loser (Peter Weller), whose sons (Corey Haim, 
Christopher Collet), ages 10 and 15 respectively, view with increasing horror. 
</P>
<P>
The deft and amusing Back to the Beach (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) 
imagines that Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon of all those "Beach Party" 
movies of the early '60s got married and settled down in Ohio where Frankie has 
become a workaholic champion car salesman and Annette a model housewife and 
mother; what gets them back to Malibu is a visit to their daughter. The film is 
nostalgic without being embarrassing and knowing without being either cruel or 
cynical. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Franklin's 1981 Road Games (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a nifty 
Australian thriller starring Stacy Keach as a truck driver and Jamie Lee Curtis 
as a hitchhiker who are pursued by a killer across a vast desert. Nice 
Hitchcock touches along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Battle Beyond the Stars (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a "Star Wars" carbon 
with a "Seven Samurai" plot; cut-rate but blessed by a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Terence Malick's 1978 Days of Heaven (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is one of 
the most beautiful color films ever made, a poetic turn-of-the-century love 
triangle set against a wheat harvest in the Midwest and involving Richard Gere, 
Brooke Adams and Sam Shepard. Nestor Almendros won an Oscar for his glorious 
70mm camerawork. 
</P>
<P>
The Kidnapping of the President (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.), a not-bad 1980 
theatrical production that was sold directly to TV, stars Hal Holbrook as a 
U.S. President who fails to heed the warning of Secret Service deputy director 
William Shatner that a group of South American terrorists may be planning to 
disrupt his visit to Canada. With Van Johnson and Ava Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
Elia Kazan's unforgettable 1955 film of John Steinbeck's East of Eden (Channel 
13 Friday at 8 p.m.) stars James Dean as the tormented Salinas Valley youth 
with a stern father (Raymond Massey) and a mother (Jo Van Fleet) who turns out 
to be the local hard-bitten madam. 
</P>
<P>
A Special Day (Channel 28 Saturday at 10:40 p.m.), Ettore Scola's stunning 1977 
film of strong contemporary implications, teams Sophia Loren as weary, 
oppressed Roman housewife and mother of six and Marcello Mastroianni as a 
homosexual threatened with imminent deporation to a concentration camp who meet 
during Hitler's triumphant procession through Rome on May 6, 1938.
