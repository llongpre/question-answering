   A Zimbabwean diplomat who was expelled
from the United States for allegedly abusing his 9-year-old son
said the boy returned home today from New York accompanied by a
Zimbabwean social worker.
   Diplomat Floyd Karamba said his son, Terrence, was immediately
placed under the care of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the
semi-official Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency reported.
   ``My son arrived this morning accompanied by a Zimbabwean social
worker and is in normal condition,'' Karamba was quoted as saying.
   U.S. officials said Terrence Karamba left New York for Zimbabwe
on Sunday accompanied by a Zimbabwean social worker. He will not be
returned to his father's custody, according to reports today in the
New York Daily News, the Washington Post and the Washington Times.
   Zimbabwe has said it will place the boy in the auspices of the
courts and the state ministry of social welfare, said Robert J.
McMahon, director of the New York social services agency that cared
for the boy for the past two months.
   McMahon, head of St. Christopher-Ottile Services for Children
and Families, was also quoted today saying the Zimbabwean
government said the Karamba family will undergo counseling in hopes
of eventually reuniting Terrence with the family.
   A New York government agency had charged that Floyd Karamba had
beaten the boy, who in December was removed from his home and
placed in foster care.
   The father, who served for more than a year as a member of
Zimbabwe's delegation to the United Nations, was ordered Dec. 21 to
leave the United States because of what State Department officials
called ``clear evidence of child abuse.''
   In January, the Supreme Court refused to block the U.S.
government from sending the boy home despite arguments from the
Legal Aid Society that the boy was afraid to go home.
   McMahon said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., interceded
and persuaded the State Department that the boy should not be
returned immediately.
   The State Department had a psychiatric consultant accompany the
boy on his trip home and also engaged a law firm in Zimbabwe to
monitor his case, the Post reported.
