  [Text] Haitian Armed Forces Headquarters announced that the 
forces of order conducted simultaneous operations in the regions 
of Malick, Petionville, Thomassin 23, and Carrefour-Marin, 
Croix-des-Bouquets, on 5 March. During these operations, a 
stockpile of weapons, ammunition, and explosives were seized, 
and some people were arrested. 
  The preliminary elements of the investigation, according to 
the press release, confirm that this group of terrorists 
intended that same day to attack military posts in the capital 
and in the Central Department, to perpetrate attacks against 
civilian leaders, and against members of the Haitian Armed 
Forces and their relatives. 
  The Army Headquarters, in this press release, asks all 
Haitians for actions favoring the spirit of dialogue, 
consultation, and reconciliation in view of finding a Haitian 
solution to our country's problems, for too long wounded by the 
division among its children.
