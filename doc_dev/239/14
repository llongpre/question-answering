   For the second time in little more than a
year a sailor has died in a training pool at the Pensacola Naval Air
Station, and an investigation has been ordered, Navy officials said
Saturday.
   A naval aviation reserve officer candidate collapsed and died
Friday in shallow water after completing an abandon-ship drill, said
Navy spokeswoman Maggie Malick.
   Michael J. Fedie, 22, of Altoona, Wis., was participating in a
drill that requires students to jump off a tower and swim a short
distance underwater while holding their breath.
   ``He had completed an abandon-ship drill and was walking out of
the pool when he collpsed,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Robert Tyler.
   After he fell back into the water, safety officers pulled the
trainee from the pool and administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation
before an ambulance took him to the off-base Pensacola Naval
Hospital, Tyler said. Doctors pronounced him dead about 4:15 p.m.
   ``An investigation has been ordered by the chief of naval air
training at the base to determine the circumstances of the death,''
Tyler said.
   Preliminary autopsy results indicated the cause of death was
acute cerebral edema, said Kay Esty, a spokeswoman for the Naval
Education and Training Command. Edema is an abnormal accumulation of
fluid. She said a final autopsy to confirm the cause of death would
not be completed for several weeks.
   Fedie's father, Felix, described his son Saturday as an
``excellent swimmer.''
   Fedie, from Altoona, Wis., said based on his information from the
Navy, it did not appear foul play was involved in his son's death.
   After the March 2, 1988, drowning of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki,
19, of Appleton, Wis., five instructors were disciplined, the
commander of the Naval Aviation Schools Command, Capt. C.L.
Lavinder, was officially reprimanded prior to his retirement and
four other supervisors were given warning letters.
   The death of Mirecki during rescue-swimmer training triggered a
Navy-wide review of hazardous training and resulted in changes in
procedures at the Navy Rescue Swimmer School, including a ban
against touching students by instructors.
   A pathologist concluded that Mirecki had a phobia about being
dragged underwater, which triggered heart failure before he drowned.
   Felix Fedie, father of the sailor who died Friday, called his son
``an excellent swimmer.''
   ``He was a great, great kid,'' Fedie said Saturday from his home
in Altoona, Wis. ``He was smart and outgoing.''
   He said his son planned to return to Wisconsin after the swimming
program to complete an engineering degree at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, and then planned to resume flight training.
   In the Mirecki case, Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Combe, 28,
of Tempe, Ariz., lost a stripe and was sentenced to 90 days in the
brig after being found guilty of negligent homicide at a
court-martial for holding Mirecki's head under water.
   The other four instructors received administrative penalties of
fines or rank reductions, but the officer in charge of the rescue
school, Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, was exonerated at another
court-martial.
   The other instructors had been accused of forcing Mirecki back
into the pool after he had panicked and climbed out, ordering other
students to turn away and sing the national anthem while Combe
dunked him.
   Mirecki's family has filed a $20 million claim against the Navy.
