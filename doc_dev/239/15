   A 13-year-old honor student was
sentenced Friday to 30 years in prison for fatally stabbing a
schoolmate 97 times, but the sentence will be evaluated when he
turns 17.
   Terrence, who was 12 when the slaying occurred, showed no
emotion when the verdict was read Thursday or when the sentence was
ordered.
   He will begin his sentence at a state youth facility. When he
turns 17, a judge will decide whether to release him or order him
to serve the rest of his sentence in a state prison.
   Terrence Sampson was convicted of murder in the December 1989
death of his next-door neighbor, Kelly Brumbelow, 13. He was tried
under a law allowing youths as young as 10 to be tried as juveniles
and adults.
   Kelly was found dead under a wood pile in the Sampson's
backyard.
   The two were honor students in the seventh grade at C.D. Fulkes
Middle School. Terrence played on the football team and Kelly was a
cheerleader.
   The boy's attorney, Chris Gunter, said he will appeal the
conviction.
   `Like I said in my closing arguments, no matter what the facts
are, he was just 12 years old at the time, and I really do question
whether he understood the concept of death,'' Gunter said.
