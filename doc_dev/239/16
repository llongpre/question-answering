   Hunger, disease, war and years of
economic hardship are ravaging the bodies of Africa's children and
traumatizing their minds, the U.N. Children's Fund said Wednesday.
   While the situation of children in much of the world has
improved, children in Africa have quietly fallen victim, often
fatally, to cuts in social spending and wars in which they are
killed or turned into child killers, the organization said.
   At a ceremony to launch its 1991 report on the State of the
World's Children, the UNICEF director in the Ivory Coast, Malick
Sene, listed statistics he said were ``a scandal'' and challenged
the morality of a world tat allows such horrors. Sene is from
Mali.
   He said Africa is the only continent where social spending has
been cut dramatically, where most children never go to school and
where most people wake daily to the fear of not finding enough
food.
   Africa has the world's highest rate of child deaths from easily
preventable disease and infections - more than one-third of the 15
million deaths each year attributed to such causes. Nearly half the
world's 25 million refugees are African children and their mothers.
   Sene said Africans have done little to combat such new social
phenonena as the large numbers of street children created by
poverty and urban migration, and the deadly AIDS virus that in
Africa affects women and children in equal numbers to male victims.
   ``Most terrifying of all is the situation of children embroiled
in conflicts despite themselves - child soldiers, child killers
(created by) conflicts whose violence will produce incalculable
traumas,'' he said.
   ``What can we say about the particularly sad scandal of refugee
children, for example - scores of thousands just in our region
today. Exploited children, enslaved children, children daily
ravaged by famine and hunger while we talk of human rights for
adults,'' Sene said.
   Such outrages against children pose a moral problem that UNICEF
believes can be solved if developed countries keep their promises
to improve the lives of the world's children using money diverted
from defense spending, he said.
   Sene said UNICEF estimates the $20 billion needed to produce
healthier children by the turn of the century amounts to just 10
days of world expenditure on armies and munitions.
   African governments, particularly the military administrations
that hold sway in West Africa, long have been criticized for
allocating large amounts of their budgets for defense and little
for social services.
   Health and Social Protection Minister Alain Ekra of the Ivory
Coast, one of a handful of civilian governments in the region, said
the health of his relatively wealthy country's children has
deteriorated. Last year, the Ivory Coast cut the ministry's budget
by 30 percent.
   ``The situation of children and women improved rapidly in the
first two decades after our independence (in 1960) thanks to
appreciable efforts by the government,'' he said. ``Unhappily,
because of a runaway birth rate and persistent economic recession,
we are seeing a stagnation, even a deterioration in the
situation.''
