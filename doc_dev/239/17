   Three small plane crashes left one man dead and 10 injured
Tuesday and six others were injured when severe weather buffeted a
Braniff Airlines jet on its approach to Orlando, Fla.
   The Braniff jet landed safely and none of the injuries from the
four incidents appeared to be life-threatening.
   Meanwhile, a Taca International Airlines Boeing 737 lost power
in both engines while making an approach in heavy thunderstorms and
glided to a safe landing near an abandoned airstrip 24 miles short
of New Orleans International Airport. None of the 36 passengers and
nine crew members was hurt.
   In Pontiac, Mich., the pilot of a home-built airplane died after
his aircraft crashed at Oakland-Pontiac Airport, officials said.
The other crashes occurred during a commuter plane's takeoff in
Lawton, Okla., and after a U.S. Customs Service plane lost power
outside San Angelo, Texas.
   Police identified the victim as Harold R. Chappell Jr., 48, of
Ortonville, whose plane crashed at 3:07 p.m. EDT.
   Chappell died after two hours of surgery at Pontiac Osteopathic
Hospital, said Dr. David Malicke, an emergency room physician.
   Chappell was circling the airport when a section of material
covering one wing peeled away from the wooden frame, causing a loss
of lift and sending the plane into a spin, police said.
   In Oklahoma, an Atlantic Southeast Airlines commuter plane
crashed on takeoff from Lawton Municipal Airport, injuring the six
passengers and two crew members aboard, authorities said.
   ``I saw smoke pop up and had no idea where it was from,'' said
Sissy Anderson, a receptionist at Jet Away, an aircraft servicing
and maintenance company. ``They say it was taking off, bounced down
and hit the ground, bounced and hit again before the fire broke.''
   There were unconfirmed reports the 18-passenger Bandarante
plane, which authorities said was bound for Dallas, lost an engine
on takeoff.
   Two people were in serious condition at Comanche County Memorial
Hospital and a third person was listed in good condition, said
spokeswoman Kelly Brack.
   Brad Mitchell, a spokesman at Southwestern Medical Center, said
three people were in stable condition with cuts and bruises and two
others were being examined.
   Braniff's Flight 723 carrying 55 passengers from Indianapolis
was hit by heavy rain and winds at 13,000 feet and about 35 miles
west of Orlando International Airport, an airline official said.
   ``The seatbelt signs were on, but it happened suddenly,'' said
Braniff Vice President Jim Thomson.
   The BAC-111, two-engine aircraft landed safely without any
emergency procedures shortly before 4 p.m. EDT and did not appear
to be damaged, he said.
   Four passengers and two flight attendants were in stable
condition with cuts and bruises that did not appear serious, said
Joe Brown, spokesman for Orlando Regional Medical Center.
   Two flight attendants were treated for minor cuts and abrasions
and released from Humana Lucerne Hospital, said spokesman Larry
Harrell.
   The National Weather Service reported a band of thunderstorms
hit central Florida during the afternoon.
   Boaters rescued two men after a U.S. Customs Service plane lost
power in both engines and crashed into a lake outside San Angelo,
Texas, officials said.
   A pilot and a student pilot were practicing takeoffs and
landings from Mathis Field when their Cessna lost power, said
Charles Conroy, a Customs spokesman in Houston.
   The men were being treated at Angelo Community Hospital, but
their injuries were not considered to be life-threatening, nursing
supervisor Mike Wood said. Conroy said the men, whose names were
not released, suffered facial cuts.
