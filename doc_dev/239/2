   Former congressman Wayne L. Hays was
eulogized as a friend of common folk and an ally of Washington's
power elite at a funeral service.
   Hays died Friday after suffering a heart attack at his home in
this eastern Ohio city. He was 77.
   ``Wayne Hays lived and breathed his job as representative of the
18th congressional district,'' said John Malick, a Belmont County
commissioner and longtime friend of the 14-term congressman.
   ``No request was denied. He was fair to Republican and Democrat
alike, rich or poor, black or white. It made no difference.''
   There was no mention, however, of Hays' affair with House clerk
Elizabeth Ray in 1976 that touched off a payroll-sex scandal that
drove him from Congress.
   About 170 people wore heavy coats and gloves during the service
in the East Richland Evangelical Friends Church after its furnace
broke down the previous night.
   Fred Diab, a friend of Hays since childhood, said family members
were disappointed at the turnout but blamed confusion over an
earlier announcement that the service would be closed to the public.
   Hays' wife, Pat, had planned a private service but later changed
her mind, said Monte Beck of the Beck Funeral Home. ``She decided he
was a public man, so why not have a public funeral.''
   Only a few local officeholders attended the funeral. Former
Cleveland Mayor Dennis Kucinich and former U.S. Rep. Robert
Mollohan, D-W.Va., paid their respects on Sunday at the funeral
home, Beck said.
   Malick said Hays was a gentle man who looked out for his
constituents, and he recalled a day when Hays was traveling to
Cleveland and stopped to help a farmer.
   ``He was riding along and saw a cow out in a field calving. Wayne
stopped the car, got out, notified the farmer and stayed there with
him to help deliver that calf,'' Malick said. ``He was an hour late
for his meeting in Cleveland, but that's the way Wayne was.''
   Hays also was known for bringing prominent people from Washington
to Belmont County, Diab said.
   ``I'll never forget when he brought John Kennedy here in 1960,''
Diab said.
   ``You never knew who was going to show up down here with Wayne.''
   Malick said Hays counted Kennedy, presidents Harry Truman and
Lyndon B. Johnson and former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger
and Dean Rusk among his allies in Washington.
   Hays was elected to his first term in the U.S. House in 1948. He
became chairman of the House Administration Committee in 1971 and
chairman of the House Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
two years later.
