   A man convicted in the racially
motivated shooting of a black youth has been sentenced to the
maximum of 14 years and eight months in state prison.
   Mark Shane Lashley, 29, was sentenced Tuesday by Superior Court
Judge John Shook, who convicted Shook in a non-jury trial last
month of second-degree attempted murder, a felony civil rights
charge and a misdemeanor civil rights count.
   Shook called the 1988 shooting in Playa del Rey an ``egregious
offense against society for which (Lashley) will be punished
severely with a maximum sentence, which is so justly and richly
deserved.''
   According to trial testimony, 14-year-old Terrence Goudeau and
three young cousins were fishing on June 26, 1988, when Lashley and
two friends shouted racial slurs at them.
   The boys yelled back and the argument escalated, ending when
Lashley aimed a .22-caliber rifle at Goudeau, who ran, shielding a
12-year-old cousin.
   Goudeau was shot in the back, and a bullet nicked a lung. Bullet
fragments remain embedded near his spine.
   Lashley's attorney, Lloyd Riley, who is black, called the prison
term unreasonably harsh and said there was ``too much emphasis on
the factor of race.''
