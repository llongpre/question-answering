ROLLING HILLS CONSIDERS MOVIE-MAKING BAN 
</P>

The Rolling Hills City Council is considering adopting an ordinance that would 
prohibit commercial film making in the gated community. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff was ordered Tuesday to prepare a proposed ordinance in the wake 
of recent complaints from residents that the filming of a television movie 
created traffic and noise problems. Residents also complained about filming at 
night in the city, which restricts lighting. One resident said the film 
company, which was filming at a vacant house, cut some vegetation on her 
property to improve the view. 
</P>
<P>
Filming took place over a 10-day period on Eastfield Drive, one of three main 
access roads to the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Terrence Belanger said in a telephone interview that Sapphire 
Productions gained access to the city with a pass issued by the Rolling Hills 
Community Assn., which controls the private streets. Tom Boyd, president of the 
association, said the group was unaware of how much time filming would take 
when it issued the pass. 
</P>
<P>
Belanger said the city, which is entirely residential, does not restrict film 
making but does prohibit other commercial activities. 
</P>
<P>
The ctaff presented an ordinance used by other California cities to restrict 
filming. But rather than adopt that ordinance and possibly add more restrictive 
measures, the council asked the staff to determine whether film making can be 
outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can stop it, boy, more power to us," Councilwoman Jody Murdock said. 
</P>
<P>
The staff will report on the proposed ordinance at the next City Council 
meeting Sept. 11.
