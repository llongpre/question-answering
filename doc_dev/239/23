<TEXT>  Some of the greatest culinary talents in California have joined forces to
create "The Open Hand Celebration Cookbook" (Simon &amp; Schuster, $22). The book
includes menus and recipes from 69 chefs. Columnist and chef Stanley
Eichelbaum, who compiled and edited the collection, sums up the theme as "fun
and festivity: food as a celebration of life, food as a pleasurable
accompaniment to a joyous occasion." Featured occasions include a feast for
Ramadan and a football-watching party in front of the TV. A portion of the
book's proceeds will benefit San Francisco's Project Open Hand, a food service
that delivers freshly prepared meals to people with AIDS.; PEAR AND SWEET
POTATO SOUP; 1 tablespoon olive oil; 1 onion, sliced; 3 ribs celery, sliced; 3
leeks, mostly whites, cleaned and sliced; 3 shallots, chopped; 1/4 cup peeled,
chopped ginger; 4 pears, peeled and cored; 4 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut
into small pieces; 4 cups chicken or vegetable stock; Salt and white pepper to
taste; 1/2 cup low-fat yogurt, plus extra for garnish; Pickled ginger for
garnish (optional);  Heat olive oil in a large pan, and saute onion, celery,
leeks, shallots and ginger until translucent. Add pears (reserve some pear for
garnish), sweet potatoes and stock. Stir, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and
allow to simmer for 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Puree the soup in
a blender or food processor. Set aside and chill.;   When soup is cold, whisk
in the yogurt. Serve cold, garnished with a dollop of yogurt, a slice of
pickled ginger (if using) and the reserved diced pear. Makes 6 servings.;   --
From Peter M. DeMarais,; executive sous-chef,; Sheraton Palace Hotel,; San
Francisco; FUSILLI WITH RICOTTA CHEESE; 4 cups ricotta cheese; 2 eggs; 3/4
teaspoon salt; 3/4 teaspoon black pepper; 1 cup cream; 12 ounces fusilli
pasta; 4 tablespoons finely chopped parsley; Grated Parmesan cheese;  In an
electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the ricotta, eggs, salt
and pepper. Beat well for 4 to 5 minutes, until the mixture becomes fluffy. On
slow speed, gradually add the cream, and beat until incorporated. The mixture
should be thick but saucelike.;   Cook the pasta in boiling, salted water
until al dente. Drain the fusilli of all but a bit of cooking water (a little
will keep the pasta moist). Transfer to a bowl. Quickly toss with the ricotta
mixture and parsley. Serve with Parmesan cheese. Makes 4 servings.;   -- From
Donna Nicoletti, chef and part owner,; Undici restaurant,; San Francisco;
CHICKEN VESUVIO; 2 pounds small roasting potatoes, cleaned and cut in half;
Olive oil; 3 teaspoons chopped garlic; 2 teaspoons dried oregano; Salt and
pepper to taste; 2 frying chickens, 2 1/2 pounds each, cut into thighs,
drumsticks, half-breasts and wings;  On a baking sheet, toss the potatoes with
olive oil, 1 teaspoon of the garlic, 1 teaspoon oregano and a good amount of
salt and pepper. The olive oil should lightly coat the potatoes. Bake in a
preheated 400-degree oven for 30 minutes, turning occasionally.;   Heat some
oil in a saute pan. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper, and sear,
skin-side down. Toss in remaining garlic. Sprinkle remaining oregano on the
chicken, making sure not to drop it into the oil, as it will burn. Turn the
chicken, and sear the other side. Transfer to a baking pan, and roast in a
400-degree oven, 20 minutes for the breasts and 30 minutes for the other
parts. Serve with the potatoes. Makes 4 servings.;   -- From Donna Nicoletti;
