<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  TIME was Frankie and Johnny were content to be just down-and-dirty lovers.
Today, in the Al Pacino-Michelle Pfeiffer movie carrying their names, they're
New Yawk neurotic, deeply troubled and insecure. We know they'll eventually
collapse into each other's arms, more out of exhaustion than any belief they
are "made for each other." But this won't happen until much soul-searching and
hollow protestations, especially by Frankie.;   "Frankie &amp; Johnny," you see,
is one of those brash "modern" romances that reverses the formula by
demonstrating, in dispiriting detail, why two lonely hearts don't have a
chance at happiness. But then, after pummeling them -- and us -- for two
hours, it reverts to the safe "Happily ever after . . ." fade-out.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Unfortunately, "Frankie," directed by the very very hot Garry Marshall
("Pretty Woman"), overdoes it with the tears and hysteria and grandstand
proclamations. By fade-out time, we've had it up to here with both the
principals. We don't care if they split or stay together or embark on a trendy
"open" relationship. Just, please, get them out of our face!;   Taken from
Terrence McNally's off-Broadway play "Frankie and    Johnny in the Clair de
Lune," this off-putting mix of schmaltz and seediness features Pacino as a
recently paroled forger and Pfeiffer as a severely uptight waitress whose past
relationships have left her wary of men. It's been three years since her last
lover and Frankie has finally talked herself into enjoying the solitude.;  
Besides, who needs company when you can apply the Heimlich maneuver to
yourself? Or when there are vicarious thrills to be had by watching, a la
Jimmy Stewart in "Rear Window," the hard-luck cases across the courtyard?;  
Johnny, of course, has other ideas. The new short-order cook at Nick's Apollo
Cafe, where Frankie waitresses and ministers to the needs of ancient regulars,
Johnny pursues Frankie with the single-mindedness of a Sidewinder Missile.
First by asking her out. Then by sleeping with a fellow waitress (Kate
Nelligan) he knows will spill her guts to co-workers the morning after. And
then by showing up at her apartment unannounced.;   Talk about sexual
harassment.;   This being a coarse-but-heartwarming street fable, Frankie
finally acquiesces to the guy she finds sort of cute, but overbearing.;   But
then the old fears resurface and she retreats. Johnny's response: to come on
even stronger, crashing Frankie's bowling night, phoning non-stop . . .
stressing how the fates have decreed they live out their tawdry lives
together. After all, their names are Frankie and Johnny; they're both from
Altoona, Pa.; they both swoon to late-night Muzak renditions of Debussy.;  
"Frankie" isn't a hard-luck romance, it's a horror story -- every woman's
worst nightmare.;   It's also phony from the word go. Marshall, who cut his
teeth (and made his fortune) on prime-time sitcoms, here offers a grating,
R-rated spin on his "Laverne &amp; Shirley." (Series star Penny Marshall, Garry's
sister, even has a Port Authority cameo.) Every New York cliche known to man
-- and Neil Simon -- has been packed into this film. We get the hateful
pedestrian, the fender-bender combatants, the insulting uptown patrons, the
noisy but protective gay neighbor (a relatively understated Nathan Lane), the
gleefully sadistic waitresses. Marshall's Big Apple is more than rotten; it's
one big crime scene.;   This setting, of course, is supposed to balance out
the inherent corniness of McNally's urban fable. It might if we felt the
principals grew out of their grim milieu. They don't. And we don't. Which
accounts for why everyone overacts so ferociously.;   The usually terrific
Nelligan ("Eye of the Needle") is particularly hard to take. Her waitress Cora
was obviously modeled after Diane Ladd's Flo in "Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore." The big difference: Flo was loud and full of heart while Cora is
just obscene and full of it. Her character -- and the other pushy but pathetic
types at Nick's -- are meant to place the star lovers in some kind of context.
Thanks to Marshall's ham-handed direction, they come off looking pitiful, like
so many drowned rats.;   As for Pacino and Pfeiffer, they have their moments
but are never really convincing. Pacino in grease-splattered apron and
bandanna is just Michael Corleone in the Witness Relocation Program. He's too
much the live wire to stoop to the desperate "little guy" -- his early
apprenticeship in "Panic in Needle Park" and "Scarecrow" notwithstanding.
Pfeiffer, even made up to look drawn and pale for the early scenes, is
blindingly beautiful. She's about as believable as something the cat dragged
in as Garbo at the Tri-City Bowl-a-rama.;   Think of "Frankie &amp; Johnny" as an
early Halloween offering and gasp accordingly.; Frankie &amp; Johnny; (star) 1/2;
