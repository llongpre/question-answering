   Home video distributors have many ways of
peddling their wares to movie enthusiasts who normally only go to
the video store to rent or buy the blockbusters or the hot movie of
the month.
   It called packaging _ and that's with a capital ``P.''
   While home video fans will flock to fetch Steven Spielberg's
``Empire of the Sun'' when Warner Home Video releases it on Aug.
10, many will find it difficult to rent, with long waiting lists.
Others might be lured by older and less popular movies.
   HBO Video has a summer sales program it calls ``Video Thrills,''
featuring 11 of its top action movies. They include ``Psych-Out,''
starring Jack Nicholson; ``Let's Get Harry,'' with Mark Harmon and
Robert Duvall; and ``Wild in the Streets,'' starring Richard Pryor
and Christopher Jones. The movies retail for $19.99.
   ``We've designed this promotion to appeal to the consumer's
desire for action-adventure titles during the summer months,'' said
Tracy Dolgin, a marketing vice president at HBO.
   Warner also has an action series called ``Heroes.'' The movies
retail at $19.98 and include ``Heartbreak Ridge,'' ``The Road
Warrior'' and ``Sharky's Machine.''
   Paramount Home Video has ``Double Play'' _ two movies for
$19.95. Audrey Hepburn stars in ``Sabrina'' and ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's.'' Cary Grant is featured in ``Houseboat'' and ``To Catch
a Thief.'' There's also ``Up in Smoke'' and ``Cheech &amp; Chong'' and
``A Place in the Sun'' with ``Sunset Boulevard.''
   Virgin Vision offers a ``Freedom of Choice'' promotion in July
in which consumers may purchase one feature for $79.95 and get a
second for $14.95. Titles include: ``Man Outside'' with ``House of
Death''; ``Car Trouble'' with ``Midnite Spares''; and ``Ping Pong''
with ``Cry of the Innocent.''
   Videos reviewed this week: ``Orphans,'' ``Prick Up Your Ears''
and ``Wall Street.''

   ``Orphans'' (Lorimar Home Video, VHS-Beta: $79.95, Rated R)
   
   The comical mugging that opens the 1987 film ``Orphans''
indicates the dark humor to follow, but does nothing to prepare you
for the flip side _ the frightened, frightening relationship
between the hotheaded mugger and his younger brother, orphans who
keep out the world in a big decaying house in Newark, N.J.
   The actors in Alan J. Pakula's movie _ Albert Finney, Matthew
Modine and Kevin Anderson _ turn out stunning performances in a
play-like movie based on Lyle Kessler's award-winning stage drama.
   The older brother (Modine) builds a cocoon, venturing out to
make a living mugging and stealing and virtually imprisoning his
brother (Anderson) by telling him he will have an allergic reaction
and die if he goes outdoors.
   Into their violent, unreal world comes a staggeringly drunk
gangster on the run (Finney), himself an orphan and able in a flash
to dissect the complicated relationship he finds in the brothers'
littered house.
   The story is implausible but it doesn't matter much as you watch
what inevitably follows the disarming gangster's intrusion into the
orphans' lives. Modine's character, who believes he's abducted the
gangster and intends to hold him for ransom, sums it up when he
says, ``He's taking over. ... He's supposed to be a kidnap victim.''

   ``Prick Up Your Ears'' (Virgin Vision, VHS-Beta: $79.95, Rated R)
   
   A story of talent and torment, ``Prick Up Your Ears'' tells the
real-life story of British playwright Joe Orton's rise from a
working class background, to the heights of success, to a brutal
end.
   Orton (Gary Oldman) was a raw talent with a lust for life who
studied drama in London. There, he met Kenneth Halliwell (Alfred
Molina), a more cultured writer who becomes his homosexual lover.
   The two lead a closet existence before they're jailed in
different prisons for defacing library books. Orton uses the
separation to grow on his own, becoming one of the brightest
talents in London after his release.
   His career skyrockets when he connects with high-powered agent
Peggy Ramsay (Vanessa Redgrave). She nurtures his talents,
arranging for him to meet Paul McCartney for a screenplay about The
Beatles.
   Success drives the wedge deeper between Orton and his jealous
roommate, Halliwell, a psychotic whose mother died of a wasp sting
when he was a child and whose father committed suicide. Halliwell
is being left behind, covering his disappointment as clumsily as he
covers his bald head with an ill-fitting wig. The emotions boil
over to dark rage.
   To make sure he doesn't lose his lover, Halliwell hammers him to
death in a grisly scene, then takes his own life.
   The 111-minute video is rated R, mainly for homosexual love
scenes and shadowy men's room sex.

   ``Wall Street'' (CBS-Fox, VHS-Beta: $89.98, Rated R)
   
   When ``Wall Street'' hit movie theaters last year, the real
street was crashing and high-rolling traders such as Ivan Boesky
were being marched to prison.
   Anyone who thinks this movie offers any real insight into the
quirks and greed that make stock market life so enticing will be
disappointed.
   One of the many implausible aspects of this film written and
directed by Oliver Stone is that there isn't a single decent
woman's role. It could be that the film is implicitly blaming
testosterone for Wall Street's vices.
   But who cares? This movie is great silly fun, fueled by superb
acting from Oscar winner Michael Douglas, father and son Martin and
Charlie Sheen, Hal Holbrook and Terrence Stamp. There's even a
terrific walk-on by Sylvia Miles as a pushy East Side real estate
saleswoman.
   Douglas is suitably sinister as Gordon Gekko, Wall Street
dealmaker, dream-weaver and crusher of innocent companies. The
younger Sheen plays Bud Fox, a young Sammy Glick-type broker who
sees Gekko as his ticket to the big bucks. He will do anything to
get into Gekko's empire of beautiful women, limousines, cocaine and
mega-deals.
   While at Gekko's beach house he meets a beautiful but vacuous
interior decorator played (Darryl Hannah) who has big money dreams
of her own. Fidelity, it turns out, is not her strong suit _ nor
are brains.
   Gekko spins out such wisdom as ``greed is good,'' and ``every
battle is won before it is fought.''
   Fox ingratiates himself to Gekko by becoming a corporate spy and
feeding him insider information.
   But when he finds himself embroiled in a take-over scheme that
threatens to break up the airline for which his father works, this
proves too much even for the avaricious young Fox.
