The bounty of Sonoma and the diversity of its products are limitless. We pride 
ourselves on being able to achieve the epitome of the art of living.

 -- JOY STERLING, 
</P>
<P>
Iron Horse Vineyards 
</P>
<P>
A black stretch limo zooms past plush vineyards, then turns up a winding road 
toward a replica of a French chateau: Jordan Winery. The passengers are heading 
to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Airport limousines carrying wine trade pilgrims -- wine buyers, distributors, 
visiting winemakers from around the world -- are commonplace in the Napa and 
Sonoma Valleys. So too, these days, is the growing number of winery chefs. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bowman, Jordan's hospitality director and vineyard host, recalls that 
as recently as three years ago only six wineries had resident chefs. Today the 
number has probably tripled. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes business sense," says Bowman. "The table is the best environment to 
appreciate wine, whether you do it at home for your own enjoyment or at a 
winery for business." 
</P>
<P>
Beringer Vineyards was among the first large wineries to see the business 
sense. It started a professional chef's program in 1979 (Robert Mondavi Winery 
had installed a culinary program in 1976) which later showcased nationally and 
internationally renowned chefs. Beringer public relations director Antonia 
Allegra points out that as wineries merge with large corporations (Sterling 
Vineyards and Domaine Mumm have joined Seagram's, for instance; Inglenook, 
Beaulieu and Christian Brothers have been purchased by Heublein), the job of 
entertaining winery guests has become more of a business than a home 
entertainment event. 
</P>
<P>
Dolores Cakebread still performs the cooking duties at Cakebread Cellars, with 
the help of professionals, but she is an exception. Today the wife of the owner 
is less likely to play cook than co-host. "Most see their role as a business 
partners rather than cooks," says Allegra. When it comes to cooking, wineries 
will look around for a chef to match their style. 
</P>
<P>
Iron Horse Vineyards snapped up Mark Malicki right after he sold Truffles, a 
trend-setting restaurant in Sonoma County. His creativity, Culinary Institute 
of America (CIA) training and experience at New York's River Cafe where what 
owners Barry and Audrey Sterling were looking for. They like to entertain 
artists and writers as well as people in the wine trade. 
</P>
<P>
For a dinner honoring architect Frank Gehry, he created an entree which was a 
culinary interpretation of the artist's sculpture. When Barry Sterling wanted 
something "thoroughly American" after an austere trip to China, Malicki 
answered the request by drawing a straight line from Nanking to the United 
States, landing in Savannah. It was a regional Savannah menu he served. 
</P>
<P>
Malicki is an advocate of healthful, low-cholesterol essences, or "infusions," 
as they are sometimes called. His essences are derived from olive oil produced 
on the property for private use, flavored with herbs, seeds and vegetables. 
"The oil-based essences are a great substitute for cream and butter and they 
are very versatile," says Malicki. 
</P>
<P>
He uses the essences to baste meat, poultry, fish, shrimp or other shellfish, 
salads and vegetables. Fruit essences made with peanut or almond paste and 
fruit juices are used as sauces for desserts. 
</P>
<P>
The Iron Horse gardens, Jeffersonian in scope and character, are a source for 
Malicki's inspiration. In sawed-off wine barrels perched along the roadside 
leading to the farmhouse grow 32 different species of tomatoes, hybrid 
lettuces, squashes, artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, fava beans and leeks, as 
well as countless herbs. 
</P>
<P>
The Sterlings, Malicki and co-owner Forrest Tancer function as a team of wine 
and food tasters. They have discovered that eggs, especially omelets, go well 
with sparkling wines. "Avocado, as in guacamole, is also terrific with 
sparkling wine," says marketing director Joy Sterling, who adds that coconut 
cream with sparkling wine is another knockout combo. 
</P>
<P>
Other successes with sparkling wine are oily fish, ginger, shellfish and 
chicken. Thumbs down foods? Fruit, cheese and chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Vineyard and Winery, founded in 1972, not only looks like a traditional 
French chateau but is unmistakably organized like one. The 32-seat oak dining 
table is laid with French royal blue china and decorated with masses of 
magnificent pastel hybrid roses grown on the property. (Roses are traditionally 
planted along fences of vineyards to color-code wine grapes; red for red wines, 
yellow and white for white wines). 
</P>
<P>
Guests of the winery sit down to a meal cooked by Brooklyn-born, French-trained 
John Caputo, and his assistant, Jean Reynolds, who also apprenticed in top 
restaurants in France. A typical lunch menu might include seafood salad with 
couscous and mint, served with a smooth 1987 Jordan Chardonnay. Grilled chicken 
served on a bed of corn and asparagus would be accompanied by a 1986 Cabernet 
Sauvignon. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's guidelines to wine and food pairing emphasize the simple idea of 
harmony between the food eaten and the wines served. The soft, rich elegant 
Jordan wines are meant to complement rather than overpower the food. "Our 
philosophy of matching food and wine is one of creating a partnership of 
flavors between the two," says Caputo. 
</P>
<P>
Some general rules followed at Jordan include serving "white wine before red, 
young before old, lesser before greater, and dry before sweet." However, Caputo 
warns against over-analyzing food and wine. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes the romance out of it. We're not scientists, we're cooks and chefs. 
The part we enjoy is the unscientific aspect." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Danko is the resident chef at Chateau Souverain and executive chef of its 
restaurant. Like several other wine country chefs, he is a protege of author 
and teacher Madeleine Kamman. (See story on Madeleine Kamman, p. 21.) He would 
pair smooth-textured avocado with Chardonnay, oysters with acidic Sauvignon 
Blanc. "It has the same effect you find as when you team port with Stilton," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He has found that Sauvignon Blanc goes well with smoked fish and Fume Blanc 
with roasted peppers. Veal is particularly suited to white wine, and red wines 
become flavorful when teamed with roasted red meats, bacon and even red beets. 
</P>
<P>
Cottage industries that started with the hippies of the early '70s have helped 
Sonoma come into its own as an important food center, says Danko. "There is a 
thriving oyster industry,and Sonoma has become the poultry capital. The county 
also produces some of the best goat cheese and lamb in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just beginning to appreciate the land and what it offers. The 
county has the best of everything. Chardonnays in Sonoma are some of the finest 
and the Pinot Noir resembles those of Provence and Normandy." 
</P>
<P>
With such offerings a chef's scope is unlimited. "We use what we feel will 
balance food with wine," says Danko. "Much of what we do is dictated by the 
land. It's like letting the environment take over the body." 
</P>
<P>
Health concerns in cooking have also influenced Danko's direction in cooking. 
"We take the fat off everything now," he says. They have also led him to create 
meat essences for flavoring sauces by cooking down beef, veal and lamb, game 
birds without fat. He uses a less fatty and less heavy demiglace, originally 
described by Escoffier and resurrected by Madeleine Kamman. 
</P>
<P>
CIA graduate Stephen Benson, who perfected his skills at La Costa Hotel and Spa 
in Carlsbad, Mille Fleurs in Rancho Santa Fe and other Napa Valley restaurants, 
prepares meals for Cain Cellars owners Joyce and Jerry Cain and also for winery 
events and private parties. 
</P>
<P>
The California native brings much of his German heritage into his cooking: 
braised red cabbage, light sauces and reductions. Wine from the 552-acre Cain 
property provides the inspiration when Benson cooks. 
</P>
<P>
Sauvignon Blanc, for instance, suggests sipping with appetizers. Chardonnays 
are paired with first course dishes such as crab cakes, buttery seafood dishes 
and creamy sauces. Meat or poultry entrees might call for red wine, especially 
when fruit, such as black currants, and pepper are used in the meat sauce. 
"Pepper brings out wine wonderfully," Benson says. 
</P>
<P>
Benson enjoys using ingredients from local farmers, such as Peter Forni and 
Lynn Brown, who operate a small farm in Napa and specialize in 40 varieties of 
hybrid lettuces supplying many local chefs. Much of their produce is also 
air-shipped to top restaurants around the country. 
</P>
<P>
So dedicated are some chefs to the art of food and wine pairing, they have 
developed their own principles. Beringer's Patricia Windisch has made a 
scientific study of the art of "pairing" and concluded that acid in food should 
be kept just below the acid level in the wine. 
</P>
<P>
"When using a Chardonnay that seems acidic and a chicken or seafood dish is 
being served," she wrote in her research paper, "Secrets of a Winery Chef," 
"add an acid to the sauce in the form of lemon, lime, balsamic vinegar or 
reduced wine. That touch of acid in the dish will soften the acidic quality of 
the wine; conversely, when the wine seems low in acid, a creamy sauce that is 
high in lactose (sugar) and more alkaline in character will help raise the 
acidic perception of the wine." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, in a meal created for a designer's show house luncheon Windisch 
paired macerated melon and berries with Late Harvest Johannisberg riesling, a 
rather sweet and fruity wine. 
</P>
<P>
Napa's century-old Inglenook Vineyard, tucked in a "nook" of the Rutherford 
Hills, first installed a resident chef in 1980. After a competition involving 
more than 60 candidates, the job went to Jamie Morningstar, a CCA graduate and, 
by coincidence, a great-granddaughter of Gustave Niebaum, Inglenook's 19th 
century founder. She prepares special meals for guests of the winery, holds 
classes in matching of food and wine, and travels widely to showcase the 
Hueblein-owned Inglenook estate bottled wines (not to be confused with 
Inglenook jug wines). 
</P>
<P>
"I have found," she says, "that matching acidic wine with acidic foods tends to 
have a neutralizing effect. A Sauvignon Blanc, for instance, which is acidic, 
plays well with bold flavors of salsas and other fiery foods. Chardonnays, 
which are less acidic, find harmony when paired with pastas and rich, creamy 
sauces." 
</P>
<P>
For a dish of chicken topped with a herb butter, Morningstar selected 1985 
Cabernet Sauvignon from the Inglenook-Napa Valley. With strawberries macerated 
in liqueur she served 1986 Late Harvest Gewurztraminer, to match the sweetness 
of the strawberries and liqueur at harmonious levels with the wine. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Velardi, a graduate of the California Culinary Academy (CCA) in San 
Francisco, was resident chef for the officers on a Sagafjord-Cunard Lines 
Alaska cruise before joining Gloria Ferrer Champagne Caves four years ago. In 
keeping with Gloria Ferrer's Spanish origins (the parent company is Freixenet, 
a leading producer of methode champenoise sparkling wine in Spain), Velardi 
serves tapas on the winery patios each Sunday. She also prepares meals for 
visitors in the wine trade. The winery is also open to privately catered events 
and weddings. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of staff winery chefs is becoming so fashionable that neighbors hardly 
can keep up with growing numbers. Few wine country residents, for instance, 
could tell you that the small (20,000 case) Frog's Leap Winery now boasts a 
resident chef. True, Bev Salinger also handles office duties, but the CCA 
graduate is still called upon several times a week to entertain private guests 
of the owners, Larry Turley and John and Julie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Frog's Leap sits back from the road in rustic surroundings that suggest the 
romantic countrified rompings of a modern Marie Antoinette, undistinguished but 
for the bright green mail box that identifies the winery to 
"by-appointment-only visitors." A babbling brook behind the main house shimmers 
in the midday sun streaming through lacy oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The air is filled by the aroma of huge Washington State oysters barbecuing on 
the grill. The oysters, purchased at Johnson's Oyster Farm at Point Reyes in 
nearby Marin County were specifically selected to complement the 1986 Sauvignon 
Blanc being served. 
</P>
<P>
Salinger, who worked for 10 years at Domaine Chandon before joining Frog's 
Leap, believes that some portion of the wine appearing in the food should be 
the one served with the food. A Cabernet Sauvignon used in a sauce for lamb 
would also appear on the table as the wine of choice. A strawberry coulis 
served with chocolate might contain a touch of Zinfandel, which also 
complements chocolate desserts. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the recipes and menus with wine suggestions derived from the 
Napa-Sonoma chefs.
