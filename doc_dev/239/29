<LEADPARA>  JUDGING by the enthusiastic couples at a recent screening of "Frankie &amp;
Johnny" -- wisely released amid thrillers and violent action pictures -- this
undoubtedly will be the date movie of the season.;   Producer-director Garry
("Pretty Woman") Marshall's latest entry is a feel-good picture, to be sure,
but a dream that's just too good to be true.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The film is based on "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune," a quiet,
off-Broadway stage hit by Terrence McNally, who also wrote the film. The story
concerns Frankie (Michelle Pfeiffer), a lonely waitress, and Johnny (Al
Pacino), an ex-con. Frankie and Johnny (yes, the song is referred to
constantly) meet at the Apollo Cafe in New York, where Frankie works. Johnny
strides in and applies for the position of short-order cook and before you can
say meatloaf, he has disarmed the joint -- with the notable exception of
Frankie.;   See where this is going? Before long, Johnny is pursuing Frankie
like a rabid squirrel.;   Wisely, the film divides its time between the
marathon arguments and assignations of Pacino and Pfeiffer and the comic
relief of the knockout supporting cast.;   Particular standouts are Nathan
Lane as Frankie's relentlessly funny gay neighbor and best friend, Tim; Hector
Elizondo as the cafe's proprietor, Nick; Kate Nelligan as the brassy but
lonely waitress Cora; and Jane Morris, whose performance as the mousy waitress
Nedda is uproarious.;   Marshall's mistake is in trying to make us believe we
truly know these characters; he spends the picture holding every character up
to the principals. Similarly, a series of heavy-handed scenes (lifted
shamelessly from "Rear Window") is inconsistent and muddled.;   That being
said, "Frankie &amp; Johnny" is at its best in the face-offs between Pacino and
Pfeiffer. That they are stars works against their attempts at realism, but
they overcome this hurdle.;   Pfeiffer is too glamorous for the role, written
for Oscar-winning Kathy Bates, but she quickly makes the audience forget that
with a carefully orchestrated performance. Pacino is pure charm, and despite
being pushy and overbearing at times, his expressive eyes betray his motives
as genuine. You gotta love this guy.;   Marshall's days as a sitcom king
("Laverne and Shirley") are evident; the methods and the plot are familiar.
But "Frankie &amp; Johnny" doesn't disappoint. Since it bypasses the brain and
shoots directly at baser instincts, the film likely will get the better of
many cynics who go in prepared to hate it.  </TEXT>
