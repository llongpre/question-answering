<HEAD>British Hostage's Brother Appeals For His Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>

   The brother of British hostage John
McCarthy appealed today to his captors to release McCarthy before
his ailing mother dies.
   The Arabic-language statement was issued in Beirut and signed by
McCarthy's brother Terrence.
   ``I plead with you in the name of mercy and justice for which
Islam is known, to fulfill the wish of an ailing woman to see her
son before she dies,'' the statement said.
   The Beirut office of the London-based Worldwide Television News
network distributed the appeal.
   McCarthy, a journalist, was working for WTN when he was kidnapped
April 17, 1986, as he was being driven to Beirut airport to catch a
flight to London.
   It was the fourth such appeal in two weeks. McCarthy's father,
Pat, pleaded for McCarthy's release on June 20, saying the captive's
mother, Sheila, was ``gravely ill in hospital.''
   ``She is dying in one of London's hospitals. Bring back John for
her so that she departs this life peacefully,'' Terrence McCarthy's
appeal said.
   ``Please bring back the smile to the face of the McCarthy family
at this critical period. Please release John,'' it concluded.
   McCarthy, 32, is one of 14 foreigners held captive in Lebanon.
   His brother's message did not name any of the Moslem extremist
groups holding hostages, because none has claimed to hold McCarthy.
   Nine Americans are among those held. The hostage held longest is
American journalist Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
