   Florida's Supreme Court reversed the
conviction of a death row inmate Thursday and ordered his fourth
trial in the murders of three adults and two children.
   In a 4-3 ruling, the court said Douglas Jackson deserved another
trial because the prosecutor in his third trial improperly
questioned him about his conviction in the first trial.
   The first verdict was overturned because his defense attorney was
taking medication for a head injury during the trial. Jackson's
second trial ended in mistrial.
   Jackson was convicted in his latest trial of killing Walter
Washington, 25; his wife Edna, 21; Larry Finney, 26; and Terrence
and Reginald Manuel in March 1981. Their bodies were found in the
charred hulk of an car on a remote stretch of road.
   The three adults died of shotgun wounds. Terrence, 4, and
Reginald, 14 months, Mrs. Washington's sons, died of smoke
inhalation.
   The killings occurred after Jackson's estranged wife, Karen,
quarreled with him and left home to live with the victims.
   ``The prejudicial effect upon a jury of testimony that a
defendant has been previously convicted of the crimes for which he
is now on trial is so damaging that it cannot be said beyond a
reasonable doubt that a jury would return a verdict of guilty absent
the testimony,'' the court's majority opinion said.
   But Justice Stephen H. Grimes argued that the cross-examination
remark was ``harmless error.''
   ``Moreover, there is every reason to believe that the jury was
already aware that this was not Jackson's first trial,'' Grimes said
in his dissenting opinion.
