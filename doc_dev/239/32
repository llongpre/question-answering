   Terrence Lore Smith, author of the
best-selling novel ``The Thief Who Came To Dinner,'' was killed in a
traffic accident on an icy road. He was 46.
   Smith, who died Wednesday, wrote eight mystery novels. The most
famous, ``The Thief Who Came To Dinner,'' was completed in 1969 and
was published by Doubleday and Pocket Books. It reached No. 7 on a
national best-seller list and was made into a movie that starred
Ryan O'Neill.
   He also wrote ``The Looking Glass Murders,'' ``Murder Behind
Closed Doors,'' ``Yours Truly, From Hell,'' ``The Money War,'' ``The
Devil and Webster Daniels,'' ``Grownups and Lovers,'' and ``Who
Killed the Pie Man?''
   He co-authored ``Different Drums'' with his father, Charles
Merrill Smith, who died in February 1985.
   Smith was born Oct. 27, 1942, in Freeport, Ill. He lived in
Bloomington, Ill., until he moved to Colorado Springs in 1980. He
recently moved to Woodland Park.
   Smith had worked for about a year as a courier for the Pikes Peak
Library District. He died while driving a library district van on an
icy road. The van went out of control and was struck by another
vehicle, authorities said.
   ``He was a very, very capable and dear employee _ very well
liked,'' said Bernard Margolis, director of the library district.
``He was very appreciated by his colleagues. ...
   ``He liked people, he liked the library and he liked the world of
books.''
   Before joining the staff, Smith worked as a counselor at the
Brockhurst Ranch and the ARK, two alcoholic rehabilitation centers
in Green Mountain Falls. He was a state-certified drug and alcohol
counselor.
   Smith was a member of the Mystery Writers Guild of America.
   He married Harriet Hahn Smith on March 20, 1971, in Middletown,
N.Y. She is a columnist and deputy features editor of the Colorado
Springs Gazette Telegraph.
   Smith is survived by his wife; his mother, Mary Lore Smith of
Bloomington; a sister and four daughters.
   Funeral services were incomplete.
