<LEADPARA>  Shon Lewis and Terrence Adams have run away from their share of defenses, and
Friday night was no exception.;   The Wilcox backs scored two touchdowns
apiece and combined for 269 yards rushing to propel the Santa Clara Athletic
League-champion Chargers to a 42-8 romp over visiting Pioneer in the opening
round of the Central Coast Section Division I 3A football playoffs.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The win moves Wilcox into the semifinal round at 4:30 p.m. next Friday at
San Jose City College against the winner of today's 7:30 p.m. game between
Leland (7-3) and Los Gatos (6-3) at Los Gatos.;   Wilcox, ranked second in
Santa Clara County, defeated No. 8 Los Gatos 14-7 in a regular-season game in
September.;   Lewis, who rushed for 156 yards in 11 carries, ran 70 yards for
a touchdown on Wilcox's first play from scrimmage, and he made it 28-0 on a
50-yard run with 17 seconds remaining in the first half.;   His Friday night
output elevated his season totals to 1,638 yards in 150 carries and 22
touchdowns.;   Adams contributed first-half TD runs of 5 and 13 yards, and
finished with 113 yards in nine carries. He opened the third quarter with a
50-yard run to the 15, which led to a touchdown.;   "Shon and Terrence are
very impressive backs; they continue to get the job done," Wilcox Coach John
Sepulveda said. "You're certainly not going to find two backs of that caliber
in many high school backfields.";   No argument from Pioneer Coach Dan Lloyd.;
  "They had too much speed for us," Lloyd said. "Especially Lewis. Once he
broke beyond the line of scrimmage on his two touchdown runs, there was no
catching him.";   Wilcox quarterback Jermaine Mitchell joined in on the
scoring barrage in the third quarter, running 9 yards for one TD and throwing
a 32-yard pass to Nate Reyes for another.;   Pioneer (6-4), which finished
second in the Santa Teresa Athletic League, avoided a shutout when quarterback
Brian Yoshikawa scored on a 1-yard sneak with 34 seconds remaining.;  
Sepulveda also put in a good word for his forgotten unit -- the defense.;  
"It seems that Shon, Terrence and our offense receive most of the attention
from everyone, but our defense is pretty good, too," the coach said. "Todd
Banuelos, one of our inside linebackers, had an especially good game tonight.;
  "Todd has been doing the job since we lost David Yee to a knee injury a few
weeks ago, but David will be back in the middle with Todd for our next game.";
