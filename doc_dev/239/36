   Terrence McNally's ``The Lisbon Traviata,'' which
opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater Club, is more
than a play about obsession. It is two very different plays about
obsession.
   The first act is a blithe, bitchy look at one fan's extreme
fascination with opera; the second, a melodramatic and deadly
examination of a gay love affair gone wrong. The two don't tie
together neatly, but they make for some compelling, often
entertaining and even unnerving theater.
   McNally, author of ``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,''
excels at the knowing put-down, the slightly sour but funny
observation. In the past, he has skewered New York theater people in
``It's Only a Play.''
   In ``The Lisbon Traviata,'' he dissects opera buffs, specifically
the homosexual fans who idolized certain female stars. These are the
men who call singers only by their first names, who have
encyclopedic knowledge of opera trivia and who buy every recording
made by their heroines.
   Mendy (Nathan Lane) is one such true believer, a worshipper of
Maria Callas. He learns his good friend Stephen (Anthony Heald) has
purchased a pirated recording of Callas' 1958 performance of ``La
Traviata'' in Lisbon.
   Much of Act 1 deals with Mendy's attempts to obtain a copy of the
record. In between the pleading and cajoling, the two men dish and
then demolish just about every diva around from Marilyn Horne to
Beverly Sills to Joan Sutherland. Their comments are mean, unfair
and funny.
   Yet there is a sadness, almost a desperation, underlying the
revelry.
   ``Opera doesn't reject me,'' Mendy sighs. ``The real world does.''
   Wearing a too-tight bathrobe, Lane flounces around an overdone
Manhattan apartment, designed by Philipp Jung to look like the
outside of a box of Valentine candy. Lane's is a joke-filled role
guaranteed to win audience sympathy, but the actor never succumbs to
buffonery or soap opera histrionics. He finds both the humor and the
humiliation in the character.
   Stephen is more enigmatic and not very likable, a trait that
doesn't really become apparent until the second act. By then, the
locale has switched to Stephen's apartment, a stark, sparse living
space filled with expensive stereo equipment and scores of neatly
shelved records and CDs.
   And the comedy has disappeared in favor of melodrama involving
Stephen, his lover Michael and Michael's new boyfriend. The plot
takes on aspects of grand opera as Stephen forces the play to a
tragic conclusion.
   The playwright has improved the play since its last incarnation
at a small off-off-Broadway theater four years ago. McNally has
enriched the second act, giving Michael a strong speech explaining
why he is leaving Stephen.
   Heald turns in a riveting performance as Stephen, whose fondness
for opera colors his real-life relationships. Dan Butler is fine as
the disgruntled lover. He forcefully articulates what is wrong when
someone only focuses on what he likes.
   From the comedy in Act 1 to the tragedy in Act 2, director John
Tillinger keeps a firm hand on the proceedings. The two acts may not
mesh, but they both point out that there are consequences when life
tries to imitate art.
