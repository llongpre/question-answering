   Terrence A. Elkes will leave his post as chief executive officer of Viacom International Inc., according to a source close to Viacom. 

   Viacom was recently acquired by National Amusements Inc., a Dedham, Mass.-based theater chain that took an 83% stake in the entertainment concern. 

   Mr. Elkes, attending a planning meeting in Nantucket, Mass., couldn't be reached, but a spokesman for him declined comment. 
Sumner Redstone, chairman of National Amusements, attending the same meeting, declined comment on Mr. Elkes's status at the company. 

   According to the Viacom source, Mr. Elkes's employment will be "terminated," allowing him to take advantage of so-called golden parachute provisions put in place before the company was acquired by National Amusements. 
Although the amount due to Mr. Elkes under the provisions couldn't immediately be determined, it is said to exceed $2 million. 
Mr. Elkes also held Viacom stock and options valued at $23 million at the time that National Amusements acquired the company. 

   Mr. Elkes and his management team attempted a leveraged buyout of Viacom, but in March lost a bitter bidding war to National Amusements, which is controlled by Mr. Redstone. 
A handful of other top executives involved in the buyout attempt are also expected to leave the company. 
Mr. Redstone also declined comment on other Viacom executives. 

   It isn't clear whether Mr. Redstone will name a successor to Mr. Elkes right away, but he indicated he is talking to outsiders for other senior positions at the company. 
One such position is the top job at Showtime/The Movie Channel Inc., a unit. 
Mr. Redstone said a number of entertainment industry executives have approached him about top positions at Viacom. 
Mr. Redstone is also said to have approached Time Inc. planning executive Winston Cox about the Showtime post. 
Another candidate is said to be Terrence A. McGuirk, currently president of Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s cable network sales unit. 
Mr. McGuirk declined comment; Mr. Cox couldn't be reached for comment. 

   After National Amusements won the bidding war for Viacom, Mr. Redstone indicated that he was open to keeping Mr. Elkes and other management in place; Mr. Redstone has little expertise in Viacom's cable, broadcasting and program production operations. 
But relations between Mr. Elkes and Mr. Redstone remained strained. 
Moreover, Mr. Elkes is said to want to pursue other interests. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Redstone has said he is considering the sale of partial interests in a number of Viacom assets, including Showtime and cable programming networks MTV Networks and Nickelodeon. 
Mr. Redstone said yesterday that he was in discussion with a number of companies, but he declined to name them.
