   Nathan Lane, who has finally won critical
acclaim in Terrence McNally's off-Broadway hit, ``The Lisbon
Traviata,'' knows the pitfalls and pratfalls of an actor's struggle
upward.
   Lane thought his breakthrough into public recognition would come
with the play ``The Film Society,'' in which he played the lead, a
teacher in a private school in South Africa.
   But it had to wait for his present role, playing a hilariously
fanatic fan of diva Maria Callas, obsessed with hearing a pirated
recording of her singing ``La Traviata'' in Lisbon.
   Critics praised ``The Lisbon Traviata,'' now at the Promenade
Theater, and singled Lane out for their highest accolades.
   ``I've taken a big step in my career,'' Lane says. ``I feel
acceptance and respect. This sort of critical reception does have
an effect in the business.''
   Only 30 now, Lane began perfroming as a child.
   ``When I was in the sixth grade, we did a production of `Around
the World in 80 Days,' abbreviated, maybe 32 days,'' he says. ``I
played the servant to Phileas Fogg. They're being attacked by
Indians on a train. I went to hide. I was a chubby kid and I took a
little suitcase and crouched behind it. I was much larger than the
suitcase. It got a big laugh. ...
   ``It was like blood to a vampire. I thought, `This could be nice
to do.' I was bitten by the bug.''
   Lane was born in Jersey City, N.J., got a scholarship and
intended to go to college, but at the last minute took a job
touring the state in a musical about the history of New Jersey.
   He did dinner theater and summer stock.
   ``Eventually I moved to New York and starved,'' he says. ``I did
singing telegrams, sold TV Guide and cookbooks by phone, did
telephone polls. I called wheat farmers about what insecticide they
were using.''
   Lane did stand-up comedy with a partner. He was in ``One of the
Boys,'' a TV series that shot only 13 episodes, then got an
audition in 1982 for Noel Coward's ``Present Laughter'' directed by
and starring George C. Scott.
   ``It was the easiest audition I ever did,'' he says. ``Two days
later they called and said, `You got it.' I thought they'd get
somebody more established in the theater. It was my Broadway debut.
   ``No show since has gone as easily. George C. Scott was such a
gentleman, so great to me, like a father. If he'd asked me to jump
off the Brooklyn Bridge, I would have.''
   Asked whether scripts are pouring in now that ``The Lisbon
Traviata'' is a success, Lane says no, then amends it to, ``One
poured in today.''
   Director John Tillinger, who had directed Lane here in 1988 in
``The Film Society,'' suggested he be auditioned for the role of
Mendy in ``The Lisbon Traviata.''
   Lane, who considers himself a character actor not a comedian,
says: ``I love working with John. He's the first director in a long
time who thought of me in terms of more than just comedy.''
   Some people go to see ``The Lisbon Traviata'' without knowing
whether it's a comedy, tragedy, musical or drama, Lane says.
   ``It's a successful play,'' Lane says. ``If they aren't familiar
with the world they're going to enter, they're in for a big
surprise. The opera jokes are self-explanatory. Stephen says,
`Marilyn Horne sings like a truck driver.' I say, `Marilyn Horne IS
a truck driver. She was discovered driving a fork lift in a Los
Angeles gravel pit.'
   ``And after the initial realization that all the characters are
gay, the play becomes very universal.
   ``Slowly you realize it is about the fear of getting older and
of being alone and feeling so desperate about that you'd rather
kill your lover than let him leave you.
   ``I think it's a brave play, because it deliberately turns dark
in the second act,'' Lane says. ``By the end of the first act, you
see the darkness coming and the pain an sadness that is there, if
you're really paying attention. Some people feel cheated; they
thought it was just going to be laughs.
   ``People have walked out. It gets very frank. The moment of
nudity is not gratuitous. For Stephen to go home and see a nude,
young man there is meant to be shocking.''
   Older men and women whom one would expect to be put off by the
sexual frankness seem to respond to the play more than anyone, Lane
says. One older man told him: ``This was an old-fashioned drama
told in a whole new way. This is the most moving experience I've
had in the theater in 20 years.''
