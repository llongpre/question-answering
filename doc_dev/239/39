<HEAD>CFTC Charges 22 Traders in Alleged Bond Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Twenty-two Chicago traders face large fines and
possible suspension for their alleged roles in a scheme to
pre-arrange trades for U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said the traders
executed a series of transactions with Robert J. Griffin, a floor
broker on the Chicago Board of Trade, between July 10 and 24, 1986,
that ``were of the character of ... fictitious sales and that as a
result ... all of the traders caused prices to be reported that
were not true.''
   The six-count complaint disclosed Monday in Washington also
charged Griffin, who was trading on behalf of customers, with
fraud, alleging that his customers suffered losses because he
traded with the other 21 traders rather than file the orders
competitively.
   Griffin's attorney, Matt Lydon, denied the CFTC charges.
   ``The trades were executed at prices which were the best
attainable by the customers,'' Lydon said.
   The CFTC said a hearing before an administrative law judge would
be scheduled. The accused traders face possible penalties ranging
from fines of $100,000 per violation to revocation or suspension of
their licenses and trading privileges.
   The CFTC charges follow disclosures a few months ago that the
FBI was winding down a two-year undercover probe of alleged
wrongdoing among traders at the Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``I think the CFTC is pressing on this because of the FBI
investigation,'' one trader named in the complaint told the Chicago
Tribune. His name was not printed.
   ``They are trying to use this as a ploy to show Congress that it
(the CFTC) is a necessary agency,'' another trader named in the
complaint told the newspaper.
   Mark Prout, a spokesman for the Board of Trade, said after the
exchange became aware of the investigation in May 1988, it asked
the CFTC for permission to take over the probe, but received no
reply.
   Those named in the complaint were:
   John K. Angelo, Hinsdale, Ill.; Leonard Cahnmann and Roy E.
Erickson, Northbrook, Ill.; Terrence M. Corby, Brian D. Fox, George
D. Leventis, Yossi Morik, Peggy Anne Ogorek, Keith M. Rudman,
Thomas M. Schwarz, Pemberton H. Shober Jr. and George Tomlinson,
Chicago; Ronald J. Cohen, Arlington Heights, Ill.; Edmund J.
Conroy, Willowbrook, Ill.; Robert D. Furst Jr., Deephaven, Minn.;
Robert J. Griffin, Winnetka, Ill.; Terrence P. Madden, LaGrange,
Ill.; Bruce A. Nixon, Long Grove, Ill.; Anthony J. Roti, Glenview,
Ill.; Mary A. Rowell, Glencoe, Ill., and Dennis M. Sullivan,
Highland Park, Ill.
