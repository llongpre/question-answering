   When actress Bonnie Franklin first tried to land
the role of Frankie in ``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,''
she couldn't even get an audition.
   Frankie, a wary, never-married waitress in a definitely
down-scale diner, wasn't anything like Ann Romano, the divorced,
working mother of two girls on TV's ``One Day at a Time,'' the role
Miss Franklin played for nine years.
   Casting directors, Miss Franklin says, ``think that's who you
are, rather than what you play. It's real frustrating because I
know what I can do.''
   Kathy Bates and Kenneth Welsh, the original Frankie and Johnny,
were replaced by Carol Kane and Bruce Weitz. When Kane and Weitz
decided to leave, Miss Franklin put in another, this time
successful, appeal to audition.
   Miss Franklin and Tony Musante, known from TV's ``Toma,'' went
into ``Frankie and Johnny'' on Sept. 13, after three weeks'
rehearsal. They're enjoying the collaboration so much they want to
work together again.
   ``We're so lucky,'' she says. ``There're only two of us out
there on stage. The trust has to be extraordinary. It could have
been we didn't trust each other and didn't get along.''
   The play is about the relationship between a waitress and a
short-order cook. He decides on their first date they should become
a couple. She, having been physically hurt and then dumped by a
longtime lover, wants a man in her life but is afraid to allow
herself to be vulnerable again.
   ``It's a wonderful play,'' Miss Franklin says. ``The more I do
it, the more I love it.''
   Audiences identify with Frankie, Miss Franklin says. ``She is
afraid to be left, damaged and hurt again in her life. I think
elements of that are in all of us.
   ``Johnny pushes so hard. Men don't want to see themselves as
steamrollers. But he's saying `Love me; let me into your life.' He
finally tells her, `I'm not good with people.'
   ``I think people get things from the play, wherever their own
pain is _ children, marriage, commitment or whatever. This is such
a love story. We've all had successes and failures in that part of
our lives. I think that's what affects so many people. And Terrence
McNally writes so beautifully, in a certain poetic rhythm.''
   She saw the play originally, Miss Franklin says, after her
husband of eight years, producer Marvin Minoff, saw it with his
daughter.
   ``I loved it,'' she says. ``I knew I would be wonderful in it
and I wanted to play it. I knew the director, Paul Benedict. We
both worked in Norman Lear's factory. He was in `The Jeffersons'
for nine years as the U.N. representative.
   ``I called him and said, `I saw your play and I want to replace
Kathy.' He said, `I'll put you on a list.' The producers didn't see
me. Maybe it was because of `One Day at a Time.' I wouldn't be
playing the mother of two kids.'' Miss Franklin recalls that after
her Broadway debut in the musical ``Applause'' she had trouble
being considered for anything other than musicals.
   She thought she'd have lots of time to see movies and friends
while acting in New York, Miss Franklin says, but finds that only
from noon till 4 p.m. can she ``have a life other than the work.''
   She starts preparing for the play about 4 p.m. ``I take a nap. I
get up and wash my hair. I think it is important for the show that
my hair not have a real stylish cut. I bought an ankle bracelet,
three rings and earrings and painted my toenails. That's all
Frankie.
   ``I take a good, strong half-hour walk to the theater. When I
get there, I light a candle, put on classical music and do vocal
exercises. There's a lot of talking in this play.''
   Asked about the future, Miss Franklin says, ``I know I'm going
back home to Los Angeles in January. I think it's important I have
a marriage. I wouldn't mind going back on TV. Tony and I are hoping
we'll get Terrence McNally to write us a series.''
