<TEXT>  Putnam, 320 pp., $19.95; BECAUSE so much of Karen Karbo's second novel deals
with the topic of marriage, which Voltaire once called "the only adventure
open to the cowardly," the title, "The Diamond Lane," has a nice double
meaning. The diamond lane, as every freeway commuter knows, is the one place
in the world where it's against the law to be single.;   Actually, this
astringent, humorous novel tackles two subjects ripe for satire -- the
Hollywood movie industry and marriage -- both notoriously fickle institutions
requiring blind hope to sustain life.;   In the film business, people spend 90
percent of their time hoping for the deal, the option, the big break, even a
lunch meeting. In marriage, about the same amount of energy is devoted to
hoping for intimacy, longevity and happiness. "It's psychological work, having
hope," as one character in this novel says.;   This is something Mouse and
Mimi FitzHenry, two sisters originally from the San Fernando Valley who are
now in their mid-30s, understand very well. They just hope for very different
things.;   Mouse, whose real name is Frances, is a no-nonsense documentary
film maker who has lived in Africa for many years. She's one of those women
for whom clothes and makeup are inconsequential. She and her English
boyfriend, Tony, are willing to go unwashed for weeks and live on handouts in
order to turn out unsalable documentaries on tribal marriage customs.;   
Mimi, on the other hand, is a creature of Hollywood, an aspiring actress and
screenwriter who toils away as a lowly secretary in a production office, a
woman obsessed with her appearance and weight, willing to accept the crumbs of
attention tossed her way by the obtuse and whining Ralph, her married lover,
another would-be screenwriter whose latest script is "Girls on Gaza.";   
Mouse and Mimi are reunited when Mouse is summoned home by a family medical
emergency. (Their mother, Shirl, is clobbered by a ceiling fan in a
restaurant). In Los Angeles, Mouse finds herself yielding to pressure from her
ailing mother to marry Tony, who has returned with her only to immediately
succumb to the make-a-megabuck syndrome.;    As if the prospect of Tony's
sellout and the upcoming marriage weren't disconcerting enough, Mouse
discovers a Los Angeles of new and unfathomable oddities has sprung up in her
absence: "The mysteries of life had multiplied like mold in a bag of cheap
hamburger buns during a heat wave.";   The marriage of Mouse and Tony turns
into a farce when Shirl, who has received a handsome insurance settlement from
the ceiling fan accident, turns over $100,000 in order to stage the wedding of
the century. Ivan, a seedy but talented documentary maker who is Mouse's
ex-boyfriend as well as Mimi's ex-husband, persuades Mouse to let him film the
preparations for the big event, much to Tony's displeasure.;   Part of what
Karbo is satirizing in this novel, in an often very wicked fashion, is the way
the ordinary rituals and activities in life -- love, work, marriage -- get
twisted into the most bizarre shapes when money and Hollywood values enter the
picture. Modern, urban, upwardly mobile American life -- especially as played
out in a myth-making center such as Los Angeles -- is really Karbo's subject.
She understands the banalities and excesses, the contradictions and
absurdities of living in a place where knowing not to put glitter in your
stucco is construed as good taste. (box)  </TEXT>
