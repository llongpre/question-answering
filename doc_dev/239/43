   Shanna Reed spent a summer week roughing it
in the backwoods of Maine _ a tough-it-out struggle which might
serve her well in her new job with the Marines in CBS' ``Major
Dad.''
   In the coming fall season, Maj. J.D. ``Mac'' McGillis (played by
Gerald McRaney) is transferred to a small Marine base in Virginia.
Reed plays his wife Polly, who braves the hazards of a job on the
post newspaper.
   The show began last year with Major McGillis as a gung-ho
Marine, a bachelor in his early 40s, who has a whirlwind courtship
with a widow with three daughters and suddenly finds himself in a
house full of females.
   In the break between seasons of ``Major Dad,'' Reed went on a
strenuous canoeing trip on the Androscoggin River and Umbagog Lake
in Maine.
   The canoe trip had some aspects of a military adventure.
   ``There were 12 of us, including two guides, in six canoes,''
she said. ``Every day we had different duties, like navigator one
day, cook the next. The guides didn't interfere. We took a wrong
turn one day and had to paddle back. ``We forgot our tents, so we
roughed it. I covered myself head to foot and wrapped myself in
mosquito netting and still got bit. The thing I got the most out of
was the teamwork. Everyone needed someone else.''
   In the second season of ``Major Dad,'' the show moves to
Virginia and enlists three new characters. The camp is on the
bubble _ military cutbacks threaten it with closing.
   A lot of the comic conflict, however, will come from Polly's new
job as a reporter on the camp newspaper.
   ``Mac's in charge of the newspaper, so her articles will be
edited by Mac and the general,'' she said. ``She'll have to do some
rewriting. I'll be the editor of the feature section, called `At
Ease.' We'll live on base, so the kids will also be involved in the
military system.''
   ``Major Dad'' is the fourth series for Reed. She was in ``For
Love and Honor'' (another military series), ``I Had Three Wives''
and ``The Colbys.'' She was also a semi-regular on ``HeartBeat''
and starred in the soap opera ``Texas.''
   ``Polly's feisty, and I know that's an overused description, and
intelligent and independent,'' Reed said. ``She'll jump in over her
head and find herself overwhelmed. I want to see more of that,
where you have someone who's not completely comfortable in her
environment. She has a lot of good qualities. I don't have kids,
but I hope to be the kind of parent she is. She values
communication and honesty with her kids.
   ``She's a romantic at heart. An overboard romantic, which I'd
like to see more of. We have to keep romance a prominent part of
the show. I think Mac and I have good chemistry. You have to get to
the husband and wife and get beyond their work.''
   Reed was born in Kansas City, but grew up in Phoenix. She began
dancing at 16, and after a year of college went to Las Vegas and
joined the Folies Bergere at the Tropicana.
   ``I was very green, but I had a lot of energy. I never thought
about acting until I spent a year and a half in the road company of
`A Chorus Line.' I moved to New York and got into the stage play
`Dancin',' and I started taking acting lessons.''
   Reed is married to Terrence O'Hara, a movie director and former
actor she met in acting class.
   In addition to Reed's camping adventure, she went to Europe this
summer to appear in the latest remake of ``Three Coins in the
Fountain,'' the story of three women seeking romance and fun in
Rome.
   This version, co-starring Loni Anderson, Stepfanie Kramer and
Anthony Newly, will be broadcast on CBS. The original, which won an
Oscar for its theme song, was made in 1954. A remake was released
10 years later, but the location was moved to Spain.
   The latest edition returns to Rome, but only a bit was filmed in
the Eternal City.
   ``We filmed most of it in Luxembourg, using it for Rome,'' Reed
said. ``Apparently it was cheaper and they had a warehouse we used
for a sound stage. They were shooting a `Dracula' movie at the same
time we were there.''
