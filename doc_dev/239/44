   New Musicals, an ambitious laboratory for the
development of new American musical theater, has folded after only
one production, it was announced Monday.
   The production company was terminated July 25, one month after
its first show, ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' closed out a
disappointing run at the State University of New York at Purchase.
   ``I overestimated the box-office income and undercapitalized the
operation,'' said Martin J. Bell, producing director of New
Musicals. ``The size of our audience could only support workshops
or small musicals, which was contrary to our mission.''
   ``Spider Woman'' was a lavish musical version of the Manuel Puig
novel. It had a book by Terrence McNally, a score by John Kander
and Fred Ebb and was directed by Harold Prince. The musical, which
starred John Rubinstein and Kevin Gray, played an eight-week
engagement in Purchase, from May 1 through June 24.
   New Musicals had a $10 million budget for its first year which
was to have included three more musicals. Investors, including
Capital Cities-ABC, Inc., Columbia Artists Management, Inc., and
Jujamcyn Theaters, had put up a total of about $2.5 million to get
the project going.
   Other moneys were expected from the box-office receipts of
``Spider Woman,'' which drew less than 40 percent capacity at a
1,375-seat theater in the university's performing arts complex.
   Bell said the box-office receipts were hurt by the mostly
negative reviews, especially in The New York Times. The producer
had asked that critics not review the show because it was a work in
progress and that a review ``defeats what we're trying to do
here.'' Besides the Times, the musical was reviewed by the Daily
News, the New York Post, The Associated Press and several other
publications.
   ``My heart is broken, but working on `Kiss of the Spider Woman'
with Hal Prince, John Kander, Fred Ebb, Terrence McNally and the
rest of the gang was worth it all,'' Bell said. ``There were times
sitting in that theater during the process when I knew this was the
only place on Earth I wanted to be.''
