<DESCRIPT>  CELEBRITY; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WATCH the screen sizzle when Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston get together
for "The Bodyguard.";   Producer Jim Wilson reports that the screen chemistry
is definitely there between the Oscar-winning actor and the singing star.
Houston makes her big-screen debut in the picture about an ex-Secret Service
agent who becomes involved with the actress/singer he's hired to protect from
a fanatical fan.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Houston screen-tested for the part with Costner -- and scored well. At the
producer's request she is not taking any acting lessons in preparation of the
film's November start. "We want her to come off naturally, with a virgin
quality," says Wilson.;   Plans call for Houston to sing two or three songs in
the Warner Bros. production, although, stresses Wilson, "This will in no way
become the Whitney Houston show.";   He adds that the property has been
knocking around for years -- many years. In fact, it was originally planned as
a vehicle for Diana Ross and Steve McQueen, who died in 1980.;  
Interestingly, Lawrence Kasdan did not write it as an interracial love story
-- and it isn't one now. The matter of color will never be touched upon in
"The Bodyguard.";   BIG-SCREEN SCENE: Producer Dan Melnick is in discussions
with directors for "Renegades," and when -- and only when -- one has been
hired will he deal with the subject of a leading man. "Renegades" is the film
in which Julia Roberts and former fiance Keifer Sutherland were to star.
Sutherland counted himself out after his split with Roberts and, says Melnick,
the field's wide open -- in spite of rumors that Roberts' current beau, Jason
Patric, will fill the bill. Those rumors, insists Melnick, were made out of
whole cloth.;   TOUGH DUTY: Judith Krantz's "Secrets" soap opera is gearing up
for its European production shoot. Sixty-five episodes of the new daytime soap
will be shot in Monte Carlo and Milan by next April. Meanwhile, Krantz and
husband Steve are busy here at home. She's completing her next potential best
seller; he's producing several small-screen projects -- including the
adaptation of her "Dazzle" novel.;   CHRISTMAS IN JULY: The CBS-TV movie
"Christmas on Division Street," scheduled for Dec. 15 airing, is set in
Philadelphia in the winter, but was shot in Vancouver in the summer, reports
writer-producer Barry Morrow. He explains, "It was the only time I could get
Fred Savage and Hume Cronyn, who co-star, together." Morrow fought against the
summer shoot. "We needed snow for the story and I didn't think we could do it
realistically with artificial means. I was wrong. We used potato flakes,
blankets of white crepe, an ice machine -- and hauled snow down from an
iceberg. As a Minnesota native, I know what cold looks like -- and this
picture looks cold."; From Liz Smith in New York;   TALK OF THE TOWN: People
are talking about the hot new book by Eileen Franklin-Lipsker and William
Wright, "Sins of the Father," subtitled "The Landmark Franklin Case: A
Daughter, a Memory and a Murder" and being published by Crown later this
month.;   In a murder trial in Redwood City last January Franklin-Lipsker
testified that after 20 years, she suddenly remembered that her father had
killed her childhood playmate in Foster City. Her father, George T. Franklin
Sr., was convicted of first-degree murder in November and sentenced to life in
prison. He has appealed.;   Now Lesley Stahl of "60 Minutes" has gotten the
jump on this story -- she will interview Franklin-Lipsker tonight on CBS.;  
BENEFIT TIME: There is another terrific benefit on Thursday for the Manhattan
Theater Club's 20th anniversary -- a screening of Terrence McNally's
play-into-film "Frankie &amp; Johnny," starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino.  </TEXT>
