   At 41, veteran hard rocker Iggy Pop is on
the comeback trail with what he feels is a clearer head and more
control of his music.
   Pop left the music scene in 1982, disillusioned after a 14-year
career. He resurfaced briefly with the 1986 album, ``Blah Blah
Blah.''
   ``I realized the way I was approaching my life and work had
become untenable,'' he said in a recent interview.
   ``I couldn't go on saying, `Let's get a couple of grams of blow
and write a song. Let's get stoned before the gig. Let's get stoned
after the gig. I'm in town, where are the girls?''' he said. ``I
was living the classic wild style, and that was no longer working
for me.''
   Pop said that lifestyle ``crept up on me slowly for years, and
it was a lot of work to change my way of thinking. I'm not AA or
anything. My ethic is that I work hard, do what I do under my own
power, and at the end of the day, like everybody else in the world,
I do what I can get away with.''
   Pop, who performs Sunday at the University of California,
Irvine, has just released the album ``Instinct.'' Admitting it may
be ``too steaming, too overdrive,'' he nonetheless says he's proud
that ``it's me, it's honest.''

   Charlie Daniels says he has quit
performing one of his biggest hits, ``Long Haired Country Boy,''
for fear that it glamorizes drug and alcohol abuse.
   The 1974 song talks about ``getting stoned every morning and
drunk every afternoon.''
   Daniels said in an interview Thursday the song was written in
fun but he did not want to make it appear that the record was
glorifying drinking and drug use.
   ``Times change, and I decided to take it out of the show. It was
the Christian thing to do,'' said the leader of the Charlie Daniels
Band. The five-piece country-rock group is also known for ``The
Devil Went Down to Georgia,'' ``Uneasy Rider'' and ``The South's
Gonna Do It Again.''

   U2 vocalist Bono, who says past live footage of
his band seemed ``like pornography to me,'' is hopeful the
Grammy-winning Irish group's upcoming concert film captures its
commitment to rock 'n' roll.
   ``There's a lot at stake for us. It's something almost sacred,''
the singer said about ``U2 Rattle and Hum'' in the November issue
of Premiere magazine.
   ``It's what we do best,'' he said. ``We've never really been
able to make records. We're a live band, and that's more important
to me than the records.''
   Bono said ``U2 Rattle and Hum'' will show a side of him unknown
to those who've never seen the band live. ``Being on a stage is a
special place, a place apart. It's where I reach down into myself
and bring up stuff. ... There are times onstage where I completely
lose myself.''
   U2 will release a double-album soundtrack to the film, which is
directed by Phil Joanou.

   Prince Andrew said in a rare interview Thursday
that the long separations that his job as a junior officer demands
have been hard on his marriage.
   ``Before getting married I never bothered about going away
because it was fun. But I think to be split from one's wife for so
long cannot be good for the long-term relationship,'' Andrew told
Press Association, the British domestic news agency.
   Andrew, the Duke of York and a lieutenant aboard the HMS
Edinburgh, was separated from his wife, Sarah, from June until
mid-August when their first child was born, and for another month
until they met in Australia, where they are on an official visit.
The interview was conducted in Sydney.
   ``I don't like it, full stop,'' he said of the separations, but
added: ``You just have to take it, otherwise the navy could not
exist.''
   Andrew, 28, married Sarah Ferguson in July 1986. They have a
2-month-old daughter, Beatrice. Andrew has been in the navy for
nine years.

   A mistrial has been declared in a $2.75 million
suit filed against pop icon Prince by a TV cameraman who claims one
of the singer's bodyguards roughed him up.
   In declaring the mistrial Wednesday, Common Pleas Judge Frank J.
Gorman admonished The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer for revealing that
the camerman, James R. Gates, had rejected a $100,000 out-of-court
settlement over the 1984 incident. Gorman said the story would
prejudice the trial.
   When Prince's lawyer Terrence J. Kenneally asked Gorman to
declare the mistrial, Gates' lawyer, Jeffrey M. Embleton, said he
would not object.
   Prince offered testimony via videotape Tuesday. He is currently
on tour to promote his ``Lovesexy'' album.
