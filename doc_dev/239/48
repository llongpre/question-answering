Ted Danson, nominated eight times for the Emmy Award as best actor in a comedy 
series, finally won it on Sunday in the nationally televised 42nd Annual 
Primetime Emmy Awards. Candice Bergen won top honors for best actress in a 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess this means you'll be saying 'You were robbed' to some other boy," 
Danson kidded the black-tie audience in the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. He plays 
Sam Malone, the womanizing bartender in the NBC comedy "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
His co-star, Kirstie Alley, earlier had ribbed Danson about his poor track 
record, likening it to a sexually unfulfilling trip to the drive-in theater. 
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly what happened to me in the drive-in," Danson said when he won. 
"The whole drive-in stood up and cheered." 
</P>
<P>
Bergen, who won for the title role on CBS' "Murphy Brown," thanked her fellow 
cast members "for helping me with my marks every week." 
</P>
<P>
"Delta (Burke) is going to be waiting for me in the parking lot," Bergen said, 
referring to a fellow nominee. "I really feel twice blessed." 
</P>
<P>
Alex Rocco won the Emmy as comedy's outstanding supporting actor for his 
portrayal of sleazy talent agent Al Floss in "The Famous Teddy Z." The 
supporting actress award for a comedy went to Bebe Neuwirth, the self-possessed 
psychoanalyst on "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, lady," said a stunned Rocco upon accepting his statuette. "My gratitude 
to Hugh Wilson for creating Al Floss, the most fun character I ever played." 
</P>
<P>
Said Neuwirth, who plays Lilith on "Cheers": "I'm overwhelmed. I'd like to 
thank all my friends and family who said go ahead and take the job in 
television in Los Angel es." 
</P>
<P>
"The Wonder Years" collected trophies for best directing (Michael Dinner) and 
writing (Bob Brush) in a comedy series.

television presence.

audience of 150 million. Nations receiving the show included Bangladesh, Costa 
Rica, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
