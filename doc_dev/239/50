   Jean Holloway Tobin, a radio, film
and TV scriptwriter whose credits included ``Wagon Train,'' ``Dr.
Kildare'' and ``Marcus Welby, M.D.,'' has died of a stroke. She was
72.
   Mrs. Tobin, who died Saturday, began writing for radio with
``The Kate Smith Show'' in the late 1930s.
   While still in her 20s, she wrote for such prestigious shows as
``The Hallmark Radio Hall of Fame,'' where she condensed major
contemporary novels into 30 minutes of air time; ``Mr. President,''
where each week Edward Arnold portrayed a different president, and
``Mayor of the Town,'' a melodrama with Lionel Barrymore.
   From 1946 to 1948 she wrote the film musicals ``Till the Clouds
Roll By,'' ``Words and Music'' and ``Summer Holiday,'' an
adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ``Ah Wilderness!''
   After moving to television, where she wrote scripts for such
shows as ``How the West Was Won,'' she met her husband, Dan Tobin,
who played Terrence Clay on ``Perry Mason.'' He died in 1982.
   Her TV writing career extended into the 1970s with the pilot for
``The Ghost and Mrs. Muir'' and other shows.
   She had no immediate survivors.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.
