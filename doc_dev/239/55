<TEXT>  Her Oscar nomination for best actress shows that Hollywood recognizes that
Bates is a terrific actress, even though the films of plays Bates did on stage
have gone to more glamorous actresses. Sissy Spacek got the part Bates
originated in 'night Mother; Diane Keaton played Bates' role in Crimes of the
Heart. And though Terrence McNally wrote Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de
Lune with Bates in mind, the film role went to Michelle Pfeiffer. "Well,
that's Hollywood," Bates sighed when the Los Angeles Times brought the subject
up. "For years it's been said that Hollywood is patriarchal. Or that it reacts
to Madison Avenue holding up these gorgeous, slim 19-year-olds as role models.
. . . But what it's begun to do to me as a woman is to make me feel that I'm
not good enough because I'm not attractive enough." But she feels no animosity
toward Pfeiffer. "I've liked just about everything I've seen her do. And I'd
like to work with her. . . . I'm sure she would like to do really good roles,
just like I'd like to do really good roles, and not have it be about what she
looks like, or what I look like.";  JEREMY IRONS; (box) Not all the British
are coming; Best actor nominee Irons follows in the footsteps of such Brits as
last year's winner, Daniel Day-Lewis, and the actor who collected more Oscar
nominations than any other, Laurence Olivier. But Irons has no intention of
going Hollywood: "I distrust many of the American standards: If you're
successful you're good; if you're unsuccessful you're bad," he told Fame. "I
thought: Whatever I have is because I am English. If I work in America, I'll
be like a transplanted flower. I'll become the Englishman abroad, the resident
David Niven. . . . Bright American actors know that it's mostly cyclical in
the business, and for some it's just a short burn. Sean Connery -- he's a
great movie actor, but he has a very cyclical career. John Hurt is always
being rediscovered. I sort of felt that by the age of 70 I'll have had a
better time living and working in theater in London.";  MARY McDONNELL; (box)
Getting in the swim of things; McDonnell won her supporting actress nomination
for her second film, Dances With Wolves. You may have seen her in the movie
Matewan, or the TV sitcom E/R with Elliott Gould. Her co-star and director,
Kevin Costner, is her biggest fan: "As a director, your big fear is that at
some point the actor won't come out of the trailer," he told Premiere. "But
every time I looked back, Mary was there -- for 100 days on the prairie. She
was my hero. She is my hero." McDonnell thinks she got the backbone she needs
as an actress because she was a competitive swimmer when she was growing up:
"It wasn't hard for me to develop the ideas of discipline and pressure and
having to be ready at the moment the whistle blows, and you're on.";  ANDY
GARCIA; (box) Cuba, si; stereotypes, no; Supporting actor nominee Garcia hopes
to make a film that will express his love of Cuban music. "No one is more
Cuban than me," he told American Film. "My culture is the basis of my
strength." But he doesn't want Hollywood to start stereotyping him. "I'm an
actor. I also happen to be Cuban-American. But that doesn't make me a
Cuban-American actor. Is Dustin Hoffman a Jewish-American actor? In order to
stop the racism, in order to stop the stereotyping, we all have to be
considered -- all of us -- actors first. And may the best actor for the part
get the part. Not the best Hispanic actor. Because if not, then I shouldn't be
playing an Italian in The Godfather, and Al Pacino shouldn't play a Cuban in
any other movie, and Eddie Olmos shouldn't play a gypsy in Triumph of the
Spirit."  </TEXT>
