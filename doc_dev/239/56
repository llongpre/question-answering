   NBC's legal drama ``L.A. Law'' won three
top honors in Sunday's 42nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards show,
while ABC's mysterious ``Twin Peaks,'' with 14 nominations, won the
hole in the doughnut.
   ``L.A. Law'' won best drama, writing and best supporting actor
for Jimmy Smits. ``Twin Peaks,'' a post-Modern tale of murder,
assion and diner food in the Pacific Northwest, won only for its
editing and costuming in non-televised awards Saturday.
   CBS' newsroom comedy ``Murphy Brown'' won for best comedy series
and Candice Bergen, who plays the title role, won for best actress
for a second consecutive year.
   Tracey Ullman, the British comedian who quit her critically
acclaimed but low-rated ``Tracey Ullman Show'' last spring, won the
most trophies of anybody. Her series and a special combined for six
statuettes.
   In the network competition, ABC emerged with 22 awards, followed
by NBC with 18 and CBS with 14. The Fox Broadcasting Co. won nine
awards, and cable television's Home Box Office collected eight.
   The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences chose as best
miniseries NBC's ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story,'' an account of
the torture-slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena. ``This is
a victory for him, too,'' said executive producer Michael Mann.
   Patricia Wettig, who plays the cancer-stricken young mother on
ABC's ``thirtysomething,'' won the best dramatic actress trophy,
and Peter Falk won the Emmy for outstanding actor in a drama
series.
   ``I would really like to thank all the women with cancer who
have shared their stories with me so wholeheartedly,'' Miss Wettig
said. ``I shared their insights and their fears. I truly salute
their courage.''
   Falk, 63, who has played the rumpled homicide detective since
1971, told the Pasadena Civic Auditorium audience it was his
birthday. ``You know, to get one of these things at any age is
nice, but when you hit 41 . . ,'' he said.
   Marg Helgenberger, who plays the prostitute K.C. on ABC's
``China Beach'' won for best supporting actress in a dramatic
series, and Smits, who plays Hispanic lawyer Victor Sifuentes on
``L.A. Law,'' won as supporting actor.
   ``I want to thank all of the Vietnam vets who have so graciously
shared their experience with us,'' said Miss Helgenberger, who
thanked ABC for its last-minute decision to renew the Vietnam
series: ``You won't regret it.''
   The award for best dramatic direction was shared by Thomas
Carter, for ``Equal Justice'' and Scott Winant for
``thirtysomething.''
   Miss Ullman was honored with a pair of Emmy awards in the
music-variety category for her work as star and a writer of ``The
Tracey Ullman Show.''
   ``Oh, blimey, this brings it all full circle,'' she said. ``I
miss the show a whole lot. Maybe I shouldn't have been so cavalier.
Maybe I should have taken that ten minutes in the middle of `The
Simpsons,''' she said.
   The hit Fox cartoon series, selected as top animated program in
earlier awards, began as brief commercial ``bumpers'' on her
program.
   ``I breast-fed those little devils,'' Miss Ullman told the
black-tie audience moments after she and her show's writers shared
the writing Emmy with comedian Billy Crystal and his HBO special
``Midnight Train to Moscow.''
   ``In Living Color,'' the irreverent Fox sketch comedy show won
the best music-variety Emmy. ``Above all, I'd like to thank my
family,'' said Keenan Ivory Wayans, the show's star and executive
producer. ``My mother and father are here tonight. This is for you,
Ma.''
   ``Cheers'' finally brought an Emmy to Ted Danson, nominated
eight times for best actor in a comedy series for his role as
womanizing bartender Sam Malone.
   It was the eighth consecutive year, every year the show has been
on the air, that Danson was nominated. His other Emmy nomination
was in 1984 for the TV movie ``Something About Amelia.''
   Danson's award was presented by the animated family from Fox's
``The Simpsons.'' The series' obnoxious son, Bart, shredded the
envelope containing the winner's name and thn jokingly announced
himself as the recipient.
   Danson said it was ``appropriate'' to receive his trophy from
cartoon characters. ``I feel a little weird. I felt like if it
didn't happen this year it would be more embarrassing than ever
before.''
   Hume Cronyn, who starred in HBO's ``Age Old Friends,'' won for
best actor in a miniseries or special. Barbara Hershey, the lead in
CBS' ``A Killing in a Small Town,'' won the Emmy for best actress
in a miniseries or special.
   Playwright Terrence McNally was voted the Emmy for writing in a
miniseries or special for ``Andre's Mother,'' a drama about AIDS.
   Joseph Sargent was named best director in a miniseries or
special for his work on CBS' ``Caroline?'' Vincent Gardenia won for
supporting actor in a miniseries or special, given for Home Box
Office's ``Age Old Friends.''
   Eva Marie Saint took the trophy for supporting actress in a
miniseries or special, co-starring in NBC's ``People Like Us.''
   Alex Rocco won the Emmy as comedy's outstanding suppporting
actor for his portrayal of sleazy talent agent Al Floss in ``The
Famous Teddy Z.'' The supporting actress award went to Bebe
Neuwirth, the self-possessed psychoanalyst on ``Cheers.''
   ``The Wonder Years'' collected trophies for best directing
(Michael Dinner) and writing (Bob Brush) in a comedy series.
   A special recognition was given to puppeteer Jim Henson, who
died earlier this year. Leonard Goldenson, founder of the American
Broadcasting Cos., was selected as the recipient of the annual
Governor's Award. He joins such previous winners as Grant Tinker,
Lucille Ball, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope and Alistair Cooke.
   The Emmy for outstanding achievement in casting was announced in
August. It went to Randy Stone and Holly Powell for casting CBS'
``The Incident.''
   The telecast was seen in more than two dozen countries. The
academy estimated 150 million people would see the show outside the
United States, including viewers in Bangladesh, Costa Rica,
Nicaragua and Venezuela.
