   Douglas ``Wrong Way'' Corrigan, the
American aviator who took off from New York for California 50 years
ago and wound up in Ireland, got a shirt Tuesday to match the tie
he bought in Dublin in 1938.
   Corrigan, 81, from Santa Ana, Calif., arrived in Ireland on
Monday to mark the 50th anniversary of the flight that he still
insists was all a mistake.
   When he arrived 50 years ago, Corrigan said he had no decent
clothes to wear for the spontaneous ceremonies that celebrated his
flight, so he bought a tie at Clery's in Dublin.
   Clery's is still open, and Corrigan still has the tie. He
brought it when he revisited the shop and received a matching shirt
as a gift.
   Earlier Tuesday, Corrigan had breakfast with U.S. Ambassador
Margaret Heckler, then called on the lord mayor of Dublin, Ben
Briscoe.
   Corrigan has always maintained a frozen compass misled him into
heading east to Ireland instead of west to California.

   Most people have a garage sale when they clean
out their homes. When Elton John empties his house, there's an
auction.
   And Sotheby's expects the assortment of 2,000 odd and garish
items to bring in $5 million.
   ``He said he wanted to have the house cleared, and that was
quite a project,'' said Hillary Kay, head of Sotheby's collectibles
department in London.
   Among the items taken from the rock star's house in Windsor,
England, were a pair of 54-inch boots worn by John in the film
``Tommy''; the Statue of Liberty outfit he wore during his
Bicentennial tour of the United States; and 100 pairs of
eyeglasses, including models trimmed with feathers, furs and light
bulbs.
   The auction will be in London in September, but the collection
went on display Tuesday at Sotheby's in Manhattan.
   ``I've been thinking about this for five or six years, and now
the time is right,'' John said in a statement. ``I'm changing
direction now. I'm going to be ultramodern.''

   Comic Charles Fleischer, the voice of cartoon
character Roger Rabbit in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' wore a hare
suit when he delivered Rabbit's lines, and he said it helped his
concentration.
   ``My approach was as an actor _ not a voice person. The only
difference was I was off-camera,'' he said. ``It was a Zen-like,
egoless way to perform. All I had to do was concentrate on the
voice.''
   Fleischer, 37, likes to call his Rabbit acting technique
``transprojectional acting'' and has dubbed the bunny's peculiar
speech impediment as ``CCF,'' which stands for ``consonant cheek
flutter.''
   Crew members from other sets when Roger Rabbit was being filmed
in London would see Fleischer in costume. ``They'd say, `Wow, this
Roger Rabbit movie can't possibly work. The guy looks nothing like
a rabbit.'''
   Fleischer said the role changed his career. ``The phones are off
the hook. It's not ringing. Just off the hook.''

   Actor Patrick Duffy, who has a sister on the
city's police force, will take part in a two-hour television
documentary on the Green River serial murder case.
   The Green River serial killer officially is blamed for the
deaths of as many as 48 young women, many of them prostitutes, from
1982 to 1984. The case has been described by police as the nation's
worst unsolved, recognized serial murder case.
   The show will be broadcast in December in hopes viewers might
provide leads in the case, said Detective Myrle Carner, who
suggested the documentary.
   Duffy, star of the television series ``Dallas,'' was selected
because his sister, Joanne Hunt, is a police lieutenant, and
because of their parents' violent death, police said. Terrence and
Marie Duffy were killed during a robbery at their Montana tavern in
1986.
   The case takes its name from the Green River in south King
County, where the bodies of the first five victims were found.

   Actor Hal Holbrook says it's no
accident that he's only just now taking on a film directing job.
   ``I haven't wanted to (direct),'' Holbrook said. ``Actually,
I've avoided it. I was afraid I'd miss a good acting job.''
   Holbrook will direct ``Staggerwing,'' a movie about a modern-day
Jesse James, next year in rural Arkansas.
   Holbrook, known for his one-man ``Mark Twain Tonight'' show, was
in Little Rock for a reception in his honor.
   Holbrook actually has directed several episodes of ``Designing
Women,'' the television series featuring his wife, actress and
singer Dixie Carter. But he said Monday, ``I'm not a real director
yet.''

   Alabama's largest city police force was
no match for the Amazing Kreskin.
   The mentalist had police officers slap him in handcuffs at City
Hall and hide the key within an eight-block area.
   When Police Chief Arthur Deutsch and the officers returned from
hiding the key, the chief told Kreskin, ``I dare you.''
   Then Kreskin led officers up and down some streets to the ground
level of the City Hall parking garage, where he went to Deutsch's
car and found the key on top of the left front tire.
   The whole episode took less than 10 minutes.
   And for those with any doubts about Monday's publicity stunt for
Kreskin's Birmingham appearances, the chief said, ``It was strictly
on the up and up.''
