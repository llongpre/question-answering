   ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' is nothing if
not ambitious, an attempt to stretch the American musical theater
beyond such landmark concept musicals as ``Cabaret,'' ``Company''
and ``Follies.''
   If its ambition sometimes overwhelms its execution, well, that is
why there is New Musicals, a for-profit laboratory for the
development of new shows at the State University of New York in
Purchase. The show, playing at the school's Performing Arts Center,
runs through June 24.
   But ``laboratory'' is not the word to describe this production
directed with remarkable fluidity by Harold Prince. ``Kiss of the
Spider Woman'' is of Broadway size, scope and quality. And that's
why it may be so difficult to really change the show without a major
overhauling of its production values.
   The musical is based on the Manuel Puig novel that later became a
movie starring William Hurt and Raul Julia. It tells the story of
two men jailed in an unnamed Latin American country. Valentin is a
political prisoner. Molina is a sexual offender, a flamboyant
homosexual charged with molesting a minor.
   ``Spider Woman'' chronicles their time together in a cell _ from
hostility to acceptance to understanding to love. What cements their
relationship is Molina's retelling of old movie plots, particularly
a hoary, 1940s movie musical called ``Man Overboard.''
   Numbers from this Technicolor song and dance alternate with grim
prison scenes. If the idea sounds familiar, it's similiar to what
Prince and the songwriting team of John Kander and Fred Ebb did in
``Cabaret,'' their first collaboration nearly 25 years ago. In that
show, set in the late 1920s, a Berlin cabaret became a symbol for
Germany's ominous embrace of Hitler.
   In ``Spider Woman,'' the symbolism is not as obvious. The movie
musical numbers pale in comparison to the story of two men who
gradually gain mutual self-respect through the telling of this hokey
celluoid tale in which Molina and the movie heroine become one.
   The Kander and Ebb score contains some of the team's most complex
and challenging work. Kander's melodies are among the best he has
ever written, and they are showcased effectively in Michael Gibson's
evocative orchestrations. Ebb's lyrics don't settle for the obvious
or glib.
   Their numbers range from sweet love songs _ there's a stunning
quartet called ``Dear One'' _ to stirring political anthems to
exotic tropical dance numbers.
   The musical actually contains a score within a score, one set of
songs being part of the movie musical Molina is spinning for
Valentin. It's here where the musical falters, not so much in the
songs but in the conventional staging by choreographer Susan Stroman.
   Molina is enraptured by these movie musical scenes, and
theatergoers should be, too. But more often than not, the numbers
just mark time, making one question Molina's taste and obsession
with the silver screen. One particularly athletic number makes the
male dance ensemble look like the cast of ``Mister Roberts'' doing
aerobics.
   Not until nearly the end of the evening when the movie and real
life merge in the driving, rhythmic title song does Stroman's work
come together.
   Playwright Terrence McNally, who provided the book, has more
success, particularly with the quiet, intimate scenes between the
two prisoners. John Rubinstein, never stooping to caricature, makes
a credible, even moving Molina. Kevin Gray is more enigmatic as the
mysterious political prisoner Valentin, although he has the show's
best voice and uses it well.
   Lauren Mitchell, who plays the show's title character, is saddled
with most of those mediocre movie production numbers. But her
personality is not forceful enough, making one wish for the sensual
and hypnotizing Sonia Braga who galvanized the movie version of
``Spider Woman.''
   The physical production of the show, designed by Thomas Lynch, is
huge, filling the stage of a theater that has the ambiance and charm
of an airplane hangar. The supposedly tiny prison cell for Molina
and Valentin looks bigger than most Manhattan apartments.
   The distance between the playing area and the audience puts any
meaningful character development at a disadvantage, although the
wide spaces allow lighting designer Peter A. Kaczorowski to splash
some stunning displays of light, symbolizing prison bars, across the
stage.
   Prince and his creative team have work to do, despite their
strong, uncompromising story and wonderful score, if the show
eventually is to make its way to Broadway. ``Kiss of the Spider
Woman'' knows what it wants to say. Now it just has to find a more
effective way to say it.
