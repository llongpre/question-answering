<LEADPARA>  THERE'S no accounting for tastes when it comes to humor, which may explain why
HBO's "Dream On" returns for a second season this Sunday night. Left to me,
"Dream On" would be tied to a ton of lead weights, resting at the bottom of
the Marianas Trench.;    This weekly series follows the trials and
tribulations of Martin Tupper, a Manhattan book editor who's still hung up on
his ex-wife, Judith, even though she's now married to Dr. Richard Stone, a
physician with the aura of a young, handsome Albert Schweitzer.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The trademark gimmick of the show is that we get to "see" what's going on
in Tupper's mind through the use of vintage TV clips; his "thoughts" are
voiced every now and then by actors in quick takes from old TV shows.;    It's
played so broadly that it ought to be an animated cartoon. It also feels
obliged to work in nudity and four-letter words whenever possible, just to
remind us we're watching unregulated, uncensored pay TV.;    But I recognize
that this is just my opinion and that many others disagree. This show was, in
fact, picked as the best cable series of 1990 in a poll of TV critics by
Electronic Media, a broadcasting trade weekly.;    As it happens, "Dream On"
has become a sort of "in" show in Hollywood, attracting lots of big names who
want to participate in all the "fun." This is kind of what happened with
"Batman" in the 1960s and Shelley Duvall's "Faerie Tale Theatre" in the
1980s.;    In the special one-hour season premiere, for example, movie stars
Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers join actor/rock star David Bowie as featured
players while the stars who contribute cameos include Sylvester Stallone,
Ricardo Montalban, Eva Gabor and Yvonne De Carlo. Sunday's episode is directed
by executive producer John Landis, whose feature films include "The Blues
Brothers," "Trading Places" and many other biggies.;    The ludicrous premise
of Sunday's show is that a movie company has decided to film Stone's life
story. While Stone is off helping save a rain forest in Brazil, Judith (Wendie
Malick) and Martin (Brian Benben) decide to visit the set to see how they're
being portrayed.;    It's misfortune from the start. The director (Bowie)
turns out to be a foul-mouthed autocrat who spots Judith on the set and
mistakes her for the actress (Rogers) he's hired to play Judith.;    "That
blouse is a disease," he snarls at the shocked Judith. "This is not the wife
of Richard Stone. This is the wife of a civil servant from Bayonne, New
Jersey. There's no style, no wit, not a trace of sexuality!" The director then
makes a very crude remark about Judith's private parts, which not only offends
Judith, but ought to offend most viewers as well.;    Once the
misunderstanding is straightened out, Judith and Martin are allowed to watch
the shooting. Immediately, Martin notices Judith is being played as a most
desirable woman, but he's being portrayed as a wuss. Which goes to show we
often don't see ourselves the way we really are.;    Ultimately, Judith finds
herself falling for the actor who's playing Richard (Berenger) while,
unaccountably, Mimi Rogers gets the hots for Martin. This leads to many scenes
of Rogers in bed with a wuss.;    However, Rogers does not do nude scenes, at
least not for TV money, so the story has to go elsewhere for the compulsory
toplessness: Martin keeps wandering into the wrong set, where they're filming
a cheap horror movie about naked girls being chased by a giant human fungus.; 
  If you're wondering how they worked Sly Stallone into all this, it comes in
a scene in which Stallone is doing a talk show and is asked if he has any
regrets about his career.;    "I have only one regret," he says. "It's not
playing Richard Stone in 'The Richard Stone Story.' ";    The other cameo
performers are equally wasted, none so cruelly as De Carlo.;    "It wasn't
always this way," she observes, followed by one of Martin's "dream" clips
showing her in her curvaceous youth.;    Among the "Dream On" regulars, only
Malick is remotely bearable. But her character is way too ditzy for my taste.
Maybe I'm just out of patience with sitcoms in which the characters are people
I'd try to avoid in real life.;    So I'm afraid "Dream On" is starting its
second season as tasteless and unfunny as it was last season. Spending an hour
with this is the best way to appreciate "Cheers" and all the other really
funny shows we get free.  </TEXT>
