   Larry Bryggman is a cardiologist by day, a
dentist by night.
   Bryggman is, of course, an actor.
   He has been a villainous cardiologist on the TV soap opera ``As
the World Turns'' for 21 years and is now in ``Prelude to a Kiss,''
a Broadway hit at the Helen Hayes Theater.
   He plays Dr. Boyle, a New Jersey dentist who is the father of a
young woman who exchanges souls with an old man at her wedding
reception. The main characters are the young couple, played by
Mary-Louise Parker and Timothy Hutton. Barnard Hughes plays the old
man.
   In ``As the World Turns,'' Bryggman's Dr. Dixon has endured
while some characters have been written out.
   ``I've been there so long I have a value to them now,'' he says.
``I think Dr. Dixon has been married six times. For the longest
time he was married to the same woman. Then all of a sudden he
started marrying everybody. They change writers and writers write
differently.''
   As a stage actor, Bryggman has been quite versatile.
   ``I think you should feel you can do anything that comes
along,'' he says. ``But you should know what you project and what
you do well.''
   When he was growing up in Concord, Calif., where his father made
neon signs, Bryggman wanted to be a musician.
   ``My mother was a piano teacher and I studied piano from the
year one,'' he says. ``When I got into school I started taking
other instruments, woodwinds and percussion. I was in all the bands
and orchestras through school. I played in a group of my own in
pubs around town.
   ``I just decided one day to try acting and I did a couple of
shows in high school. I liked it. When I graduated I enrolled at
the City College of San Francisco as a drama major.
   ``Within two years I was in New York. A lot of my friends went
south to Los Angeles to movies. I didn't want to do that. I always
wanted to be in the theater.''
   The first thing Bryggman auditioned for in New York was a soap
opera, to replace an actor who was going to Vietnam. They said
they'd hire him but he should check with his draft board. He did
and his induction papers had been mailed that day. He spent the
next two years in the Army.
   Back in New York in 1969, his agent sent him to read for an
``under five'' on ``As the World Turns.'' ``That means less than
five lines,'' he explains.
   When the ``under five'' became far more than five, ``My attitude
and my agent's attitude was, it was a good part-time job that I
needed to make enough money to support my hobby, which is the
theater.
   ``This TV show has been good for me. I've not had to go to
California to live.''
   Before ``Prelude to a Kiss'' opened on May 1, Bryggman was
Banquo in Shakespeare's ``Macbeth'' at the Public Theater. ``Joe
Papp called my agent and offered me the job,'' he says.
   ``I thought, `Have I finally reached that magical place where I
don't have to audition any more?' I don't think that's true.''
   Bryggman played one of the tribunes _ ``one of the slick guys
who went around and caused all the trouble'' _ in ``Coriolanus,''
directed by Steven Berkoff.
   ``In `The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel,' Al Pacino and I had
the whole first act,'' he recalls. ``But I wasn't in the second act
at all.''
   He also was in Pacino's ``Richard III'' on Broadway.
   Bryggman played Pozzo in an off-Broadway production of ``Waiting
for Godot'' for six months.
   A year ago, Bryggman had a 56-minute monologue in Terrence
McNally's ``Prelude and Liebestod'' off-off-Broadway. A conductor
speaks his thoughts while conducting ``Tristan und Isolde.'' He
hopes it'll be done again next season off-Broadway.
   Bryggman, whose name is Swedish, is a member of the
off-off-Broadway Manhattan Class Company, which staged ``Prelude
and Liebestod.'' ``We take a play from its early draft and stay
with it right on through,'' he says. ``It's great to work with the
playwright. I like working on new material. I like the attitude and
spirit there.''
   In his personal life, Bryggman has two ex-wives and three
children, a daughter, 29, who works for Home Box Office in
California, a son, 24, studying film scoring at the Berklee College
of Music in Boston and a son, 20, installing burglar alarms on Long
Island.
   He lives in Manhattan with a Scotch terrier and has a 30-acre
farm, with 10 acres in crops, in upstate New York. ``I try to take
care of it myself,'' he says. ``Another fellow helps me with
plowing and cutting.
   ``We do a Sunday matinee and I get to the farm about 8. I jump
on the tractor and cut a back field by 10:30 with the lights on. I
get up at 6 Monday and start work, finishing by 7 that evening.
   ``The neighbors all must stand around and laugh, `The crazy
actor's back here again.'''
