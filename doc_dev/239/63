   The urge to run away and hide, or at least
cringe, at the prospect of a television ``family drama'' usually is
justified.
   Television, after all, gave us ``Eight is Enough'' when four or
five of them would have been too many.
   Most TV scriptwriters don't seem to understand the drama of
families. They give us the unrelenting bummer of ``Family'' or
Huxtables-gone-bad or headline demons so disfiguringly evil as to
be unrecognizable as human.
   Happily, that's not true of ``Rising Son,'' a made-for-TV movie
Monday night on Turner Network Television. A jewel of a cast
creates an uncompromising, remarkably intelligent portrait of a man
and his family in crisis.
   Big, bearish Brian Dennehy plays Gus, a proud, working-class
hero who's made his way up from the factory floor to production
manager. We meet him in 1981, while the demise of his ``aging,
Rustbelt factory'' looms ever nearer.
   Matt Damon plays his son Charlie, a 19-year-old who's no longer
a boy and not yet a man. He wants to drop out of pre-med studies at
Penn State and work in the factory but can't work up the nerve to
tell Dad.
   Piper Laurie, in one of her richest performances in recent
memory, plays Gus' wife, Martha. Although her part is written
small, she creates a fully realized character in every gesture and
glance.
   Dennehy has never been better, or subtler, in showing us a man
in grave trouble. When Gus's factory closes, we see his humiliation
in his stubborn refusal to adapt. His face fills with chickens
coming home to roost.
   Just like alcoholism or drug dependency, his crisis wrecks the
family's precarious equilibrium.
   The movie's producers said they wanted to create a ``kitchen
sink'' drama like those of the postwar theater, particularly Arthur
Miller's ``All My Sons'' and ``Death of a Salesman.''
   They got more than they bargained for in screenwriter Bill
Phillips' subtle, unhistrionic script and its delivery by actors
who don't need to shout to convey their emotions.
   The strong supporting cast _ especially Tate Donovan as older
brother Des and Carol Longstreth as Charlie's ex-girlfriend _ give
us immediate, life-size characters.
   Sandy Sissel's photography _ especially in the last scene, when
night steam rises from a luminous blue lake _ is beautiful. She
shows the grace and dignity in the faces of workers without
resorting to beer-commercial sentimentality.
   Gary Chang's score is unobtrusive, beautiful counterpoint to the
night moods of the film.
   Director John Coles, making his second feature film, made the
kind of movie that big studios won't do nowadays because it has no
``blockbuster'' potential, no chase scenes, and it's uncomfortably
close to real life.
   Given the poor quality of theatrical movies this summer,
``Rising Son'' is a good reason to stay home to watch a fine movie
with real characters, a believable story that says something about
life and families:
   Families are messy; they're loud, riddled with conflicts and can
be very uncomfortable; sometimes they're even crazed and
pathological; and, yes, they're often the only comfort between us
and the long, cold, dark.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   TIMESHIFTERS ALERT! DEPT.: ``P.O.V.,'' the non-fiction TV show
has proved itself one of the best bets on television this summer,
and Tuesday night it offers the first national broadcast of the
classic documentary ``Salesman.''
   ``Salesman,'' a theatrical release during the late '60s, was a
tremendous critical success. It's a black-and-white chronicle of
six weeks in the lives of Bible salesmen from Greater Boston who
are peddling a $49.95 Bible in the neighborhoods of Opa Locka,
north Miami.
   ``Salesman'' was the first feature film to use the ``direct
cinema'' style that emerged in the early '60s with the advent of
hand-held cameras synchronized with portable tape recorders.
   It was produced by the fabulous Maysles brothers, Albert and
David, whose film of the Rolling Stones' 1969 tour, ``Gimme
Shelter,'' marked the end of the '60s at the infamous concert in
Altamont, Calif.
