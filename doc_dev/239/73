   ``Right Behind the Flag'' by Kevin Heelan is one
of those mysterious little comedies that starts strong and then
fades in the finish, in this case because of a murky plot
permutation involving drugs.
   Heelan's angry banter is fast, funny and frequently on target as
it illuminates the angst of an air-conditioner salesman named
Bernie who has little good to say about the state of the world,
particularly what is happening to his rapidly gentrifying
neighborhood on Manhattan's West Side.
   Bernie rails against the world, particularly its moral
bankruptcy and then is faced with a crisis when his good friend
Frankie stands to make a lot of money from the distribution of
``high-tech pharmaceuticals'' to Manhattan yuppies.
   Kevin Spacey exposes his soul and a great deal more in capturing
Bernie's manic desperation. The actor sustains the character's
intensity even when the story sags. It's fascinating to watch his
anger grow, wondering how or if he can contain it.
   But Heelan lets the play get away from him, particularly when he
mixes in a female reporter (Amy Aquino) who shows some feeling for
Bernie and a baby-faced drug kingpin played with smarmy skill by
Paul McCrane. Neither is developed satisfactorily.
   ``Right Behind the Flag,'' a production at off-Broadwa's
Playwrights Horizons, can be savored for Spacey's performance.
Otherwise, it's a dead-end for much of Heelan's dark dialogue.

   ``There are 8 million stories in the naked city, and you don't
want to hear any of them,'' proclaims a character in ``Urban
Blight,'' a new musical revue at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater
Club.
   Yes, you do, particularly since some of the stories are by such
talented writers as Christopher Durang, Wendy Wasserstein, Jules
Feiffer, George C. Wolfe, Terrence McNally and A.R. Gurney Jr.
   As in an any revue, there are high and low points, but the peaks
outnumber the valleys in ``Urban Blight,'' and director John
Tillinger doesn't let the evening dawdle.
   Wolfe's scabrous satire of lovemaking in the 1980s is
particularly funny, ending with the partners wrapping themselves in
Saran Wrap before the final fadeout. Equally mirthful but just as
unsettling is Durang's look at one of those female comics who will
do anything for a laugh, even insult themselves. It contains a
terrific performance by the squeaky-voiced Faith Prince who
displays a superb sense of timing.
   More somber topics are covered by ``Andre's Mother,'' McNally's
poignant examination of what happens after the death of an AIDS
victim, and a monologue by Arthur Miller on what a burglary does to
one's sense of material possessions.

   ``V &amp; V Only,'' a new play by Jim Leonard, has a modest sense of
place, but almost no sense of story to hold an audience's interest.
The season finale at off-Broadway's Circle Repertory Company
concerns the crumbling of the old order _ in this case, an old
Italian coffee shop in New York's Little Italy, giving way to the
gentrification.
   The coffee shop in all its fading linoleum glory has been
captured perfectly by set designer John Lee Beatty. Playwright
Leonard has more trouble defining its owner and customers. Most
come through as cliches _ the ailing owner, Vito; his dumb but
good-natured assistant; a vulgar but wisecracking cop who's always
looking for a handout and a lonely widow who complains about her
daughter.
   The play's one interesting character is Nick, played with the
right degree of macho defiance by Erich Anderson. He's the
superintendent of the building and stands to make the most when the
building goes co-op. But Leonard doesn't do much with Nick, except
set him up for the evening's violent and unsatisfactory conclusion.
``V &amp; V Only'' is one little restaurant to avoid.
