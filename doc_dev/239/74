<LEADPARA>  NOBODY should expect a movie about the deadly trail of a single crop of
cocaine to be uplifting, but there's no way to describe what a downer of a
mood you'll be in if you watch "Seeds of Tragedy," tonight's Fox network movie
premiere.;    Best I can do is suggest you'll feel like someone's been hitting
you on the head with a sledgehammer on your way home from a funeral.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That doesn't mean "Seeds of Tragedy" is a total bummer. After a slow start,
it really starts humming. Stick with it, and your emotions really will go
through a wringer.;    "Seeds" uses a "La Ronde" style of story-telling, in
which you follow an object as it passes through the hands of several
characters, changing their lives in the process. In this case, the "object" is
a substance -- a single crop of coca, harvested in the South American jungle
and eventually sold on the streets of Los Angeles.;    The point is made
vividly: Cocaine is the business of desperate people who grow more coldhearted
and cruel the longer they deal in it.;    The movie begins with the image of a
Peruvian boy named Carlitos (Lucino Hernandez), gathering the coca leaves his
father grows on the slopes of a verdant mountainside. His father, Raul (Juan
Ibarra), knows the dangers of the illicit trade, but his family is broke, and
his wife expects another child soon.;    So he starts selling coca to a nearby
village contact for $100 a kilo.;    Ultimately, the rock cocaine winds up in
the hands of a frantic young black man named Deion (Lahmard Tate), who owes
money to both the local Anglo drug kingpin and the Mexican cholos who prowl
the streets of East L.A. He must pay off both in a single night -- or die. To
do it, he must sell the crack made from the coca harvested by little Carlitos
at the movie's start.;    In between, the coca destroys or deeply marks the
lives of several people in a series of incredibly graphic scenes for a
made-for-television movie. Among them:;    (check) The brutal murder of a
stool pigeon at a banquet in the headquarters of a Colombian drug lord. His
brains are simply blown all over the table before the dirty dishes are
cleared.;    (check) The machine-gun execution of a group of L.A. drug dealers
by a rival gang that's after a big shipment.;    (check) The humiliating
debasement of a drug-addicted L.A. housewife (Terry Finn), who's forced to
perform oral sex on her dealer to get more crack, then goes into the
convulsions of an overdose.;    The film's four best performances come from
actors playing people so terrified by their involvement in drugs that their
paranoia leaps off the screen right into your face: Finn as the degraded user,
Tate as the overextended street peddler, Sarah Buxton as an innocent young
woman duped into transporting the drug shipment to L.A. in the trunk of a car
and Lisa Lord as a drug dealer's girlfriend, who betrays him out of passion
for a rival drug dealer.;    In one of the film's best scenes, Buxton
discovers the drugs in the trunk when her car has a flat and she goes for the
spare. As fate would have it, a Highway Patrolman stops to help her. Her
terror is unforgettable.;    The film's most harrowing scene comes when Lord
first learns her betrayal has resulted in the execution of all her friends,
then realizes she's also doomed. The sequence in which she begs for her life
in a basement littered with bodies will chill you to your bone marrow.;    For
all its visceral excitement, though, the real problem of "Seeds of Tragedy" is
the lack of involvement with any character. You just don't know anybody long
enough to really care.;    "Seeds" is even more grimly realistic than "River's
Edge," the powerful earlier film from the same producers, Sarah Pillsbury and
Midge Sanford. But it's definitely a depressing two hours. If you watch,
better have a Laurel and Hardy comedy ready to cheer you up afterward, or
you'll be too glummed-out for your own good.; 'Dead on the Money';  Tonight's
TNT movie premiere, "Dead on the Money," wants to both amuse us and keep us in
suspense. It doesn't succeed in either mission.;    Amanda Pays ("Max
Headroom," "The Flash") plays an aspiring actress who's wooed by Corbin
Bernsen ("L.A. Law"), only to learn he wants to use her in a scam to fleece
his rich cousin (John Glover) and his even richer aunt (Eleanor Parker). The
gimmick: Pays looks like Glover's dead wife, who Bernsen believes was murdered
for an insurance payoff. Bernsen thinks Glover will fall in love with Pays,
marry her and give her the opportunity to find evidence implicating Glover and
Parker in the former wife's murder.;    Dumb idea? You got that right. Pays,
who is Bernsen's real-life wife, doesn't look that dumb. Unfortunately, the
only way to get through this movie is to believe she's the dumbest person ever
born, so dumb that she'll do all the stupid stuff the writers force her to do
before the ludicrous finale. If you're smart, you won't be around to see it.  </TEXT>
