<LEADPARA>  ONE of the surest ways, if not one of the quickest, to break into acting is to
have your child grow up to direct feature films.;   Consider the mother of the
gangster played by Joe Pesci in last year's "Goodfellas." She insisted on
feeding a meal to her son and his friends while they were on their way to bury
a body; the part was awarded to Catherine Scorsese, the mother of the film's
director, Martin Scorsese.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     One of the funniest lines in the 1989 comedy "When Harry Met Sally . . ."
-- a woman, ordering lunch after overhearing Meg Ryan simulate an orgasm in a
deli, tells the waiter, "I'll have what she's having" -- was delivered by
Estelle Reiner, the mother of the movie's director, Rob Reiner. And the father
of a family of accountants in "Look Who's Talking," a man who laughed
frequently but never spoke in the 1989 comedy directed by Amy Heckerling, was
played by Heckerling's father, Louis Heckerling, a retired certified public
accountant.;   A mom's best friend; With all of Hollywood to choose from, why
go to Mom and Pop to cast a role, even a cameo? Parental relationships, after
all, are the meat and potatoes of the analyst's work, the stuff of the
subconscious. Are directors out to prove something? Or is there something
quietly condescending at work, the chance to tell a parent what to do?;   John
Landis, whose mother was a bag lady in his 1983 film "Trading Places" and has
had small parts in many of his other films, has a simpler answer. He casts his
mother and stepfather whenever possible because, as he puts it, it's "fun.";  
Hollywood has a tradition of using nepotism to launch a relative in films.
Francis Coppola virtually gave his father a career scoring films by hiring him
for the first "Godfather" movie in 1972. Before his death last April at the
age of 80, Carmine Coppola had collaborated with his son on seven other
movies.;   Daddy's little girl; Bill Lee's fame as a composer and musician
increased after he composed the scores for the first four films made by his
son, Spike Lee. (Bill Lee also had an acting role, as the father Sonny
Darling, in his son's early film "She's Gotta Have It.");   Not all cases of
nepotism, of course, prove as successful. Patricia Hitchcock, daughter of
Alfred, didn't have much of a career outside her father's movies. And when
Coppola cast his daughter, Sofia, in "Godfather III," the critical drubbing
recalled the reception Anjelica Huston received in her first role -- the
disappointing 1969 movie by her father, John Huston, "A Walk With Love and
Death.";   In 1985, Huston directed his daughter to an Oscar in "Prizzi's
Honor." (In 1948 he did the same for his father, established actor Walter
Huston, in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.");   But most of the parents,
even those who are card-carrying members of the Screen Actors Guild, don't
regard themselves as professional actors. Their children aren't hiring them to
augment their pensions or to establish second careers. There's something else
going on. Landis may call it fun, but other directors use different words --
love, guilt, repayment.;   "I think there's a generally benevolent idea at
work here," says Dr. Harvey Roy Greenberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry
at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. "An idea of a debt
repaid, maybe a little stroking of parental narcissism.";   Dr. Peter
Steinglass, director of the Ackerman Institute for Family Therapy in
Manhattan, compares directors casting their parents to the tradition of the
family business, which has generations working side by side. But here, the
parents are spectators rather than power players. Their parts are small; their
pay is minimal; the real intergenerational conflicts are being acted out by
characters in a script.;   Mother love; David and Jerry Zucker's mother,
Charlotte, began her screen career when her sons began theirs, playing a
jurist in the 1977 satire "Kentucky Fried Movie," which her sons co-wrote.
"They could have a Charlotte Zucker film festival," says David Zucker.;   He
says his motivation is clear. "She was originally an actress. Then she kind of
gave that up to raise us, and now we're paying her back." Charlotte Zucker,
who studied acting at Brooklyn College before she moved to Milwaukee and
taught junior high school English, has been in every movie her sons have
made.;   One doesn't need psychoanalytic training to detect some competition
between the Zucker brothers on that score. Jerry gave his mother the most
lines, as a suspicious bank teller, in last year's "Ghost." But David gave her
the most memorable bit as Ricardo Montalban's secretary, Dominique, who
becomes a programmed assassin in the first "Naked Gun," in 1988.;   When David
sent his mother the script for the "Naked Gun" sequel, Charlotte Zucker
remembers, "He said, 'I'm sorry, Mom, but there are just no female parts that
are good. Nothing like Dominique.' " Instead, she can be seen, briefly,
sitting at a table while a man in a wheelchair is sent catapulting over the
moon. She's the one on the left; her daughter, Susan Breslau, is on the
right.;   "Let him feel guilty," says Charlotte Zucker, with a laugh. "Next
time, let's see if I get a better part." When asked about Estelle Reiner's
attention-grabbing role in "When Harry Met Sally . . .," she said: "My kids
never gave me a line as good as that. Now there's a mother who could be proud
of her children. That's a good child.";   Estelle Reiner asks, "Wasn't my son
nice to give me that role?";   Her son says, "There's guilt, there's love,
there's wanting to make your mother happy.";   The deli scene was shot at
Katz's in lower Manhattan, and Reiner remembers sharing lunch -- hot dogs --
with his mother during a break. He also remembers feeling "just totally
mortified" when it came time to direct the scene.;   Typecast; "Here I am with
Meg," he says, "and she's a little nervous because she has to do that scene.
She was holding back in the first couple of takes, and I had to show her what
I wanted. So, I'm having to act out an orgasm in front of my mother. It
doesn't get any more inhibiting.";   Estelle Reiner, encouraged by her success
on screen, now sings jazz professionally, appearing regularly at the Vine
Street Bar and Grill in Los Angeles. A friend, the jazz critic, historian and
sometime composer Leonard Feather, has written a song that's now part of her
act, "I'll Have What She's Having.";   Martin Scorsese also seems to have
given his parents a new career by casting them in his movies. He uses his
parents -- particularly his mother -- in his films about Italian-Americans, a
practice he began when he made his first films in college.;   "I didn't have
to have somebody act the mother," says Scorsese about casting Catherine
Scorsese in such films as "It's Not Just You, Murray," "King of Comedy" and
"Mean Streets." "She is the mother. It's kind of a shortcut.";   His parents
grew up in the Little Italy section of Manhattan. Using his parents in films
about Italian-Americans, Scorsese says, "helps me a great deal." They provide
him with historically accurate details, like the card game that Scorsese's
father, Charles, plays in the background of "Raging Bull.";   Family films;
Catherine Scorsese had her biggest featured role in last year's "Goodfellas,"
as the mother of the killer played by Pesci. Scorsese says that his mother's
performance in "Goodfellas," her warmth and confusion, helps "humanize the
gangster" character.;   "That's the kind of thing that an actress could do,"
Scorsese says, "but I wanted it more genuine. I wanted it from someone where
it's second nature.";   The director's 1974 documentary about his parents,
"ItalianAmerican," has recently been released on videotape and will have its
television premiere on the Bravo cable channel on Sept. 28. Scorsese shot it
over a weekend, without a script. "My son Martin thinks it's the best thing he
ever did," says his mom.;   Now Catherine and Charles Scorsese have membership
cards in the Screen Actors Guild and work for a variety of directors. Any
movie that's shot in Little Italy, the Scorseses' son acknowledges, "they're
in it." Catherine Scorsese was buying a loaf of bread as Cher entered a bakery
in Norman Jewison's "Moonstruck" in 1987 and was seen complaining about the
neighborhood to Andy Garcia in Coppola's "Godfather III.";   Charles Scorsese
served as a technical adviser while Coppola was filming in Little Italy. The
Scorseses were extras in "Prizzi's Honor" and spent a week last year working
with Spike Lee on "Jungle Fever," although their scenes were cut.;   Although
Scorsese's parents often play colorful, if small, roles in his films, the
parents of most directors get less consequential parts. They fill out an
audience or restaurant scene; they walk up a subway staircase while a star
walks down.;   Landis cast his stepfather, Walter Levine, as a prison guard in
his 1980 comedy "The Blues Brothers." The father of the director Rick
Rosenthal was the judge who sentences Sean Penn in the 1983 film "Bad Boys,"
which led to his playing another judge in Heckerling's "Johnny Dangerously" in
1984.;   "I'm not sure I want to say which scene I was in," says Michele
Rifkin, who had a small bit in her son's movie, "because I looked just awful."
Her son is Adam Rifkin, 24, whose first nationally distributed film, "The Dark
Backward," is currently playing in New York City.;   The film cost $1 million
to make, despite a cast that includes Judd Nelson, James Caan, Rob Lowe and
Wayne Newton. Rifkin's grandmother, Elizabeth Sokol, is the one wrapped in
bandages alongside Nelson in a doctor's waiting room; his mother plays a
seamstress with no talent for makeup.;   Extra trouble; A certain anxiety is
not unusual when directors cast their parents. Before shooting "Look Who's
Talking," Amy Heckerling admits, she was concerned about her father's acting.
"I was worried," she says, "because my father had to be reading the Journal of
Accountancy and laughing. I think it's really hard to laugh on camera at
nothing.";   But because of union rules, it proved more difficult to get
Heckerling's mother, Doris, into the movie. The Screen Actors Guild and the
major studios are currently in a dispute about the hiring of extras.;   The
studios would like to hire anyone and pay them minimum wage, which is about
$40 a day; the union wants to keep extra work under its jurisdiction, which
would give the extras $98 a day and benefits.;   "The Screen Actors Guild is
concerned any time roles are offered to nonprofessionals," says John McGuire,
the guild's associate executive director. By "nonprofessionals," McGuire says
he means "people who are not professionally trained and who are not seriously
pursuing a career in films.";   Louis Heckerling is not a member of the guild.
"I was able to get my father in on the basis of a special skill, which was the
adding machine," explains his daughter.;   Landis' parents have faced the same
conflict. His stepfather had, in Landis' words, "perhaps his greatest role
ever" in "The Blues Brothers," but his mother's scene didn't survive the final
cut. "It's hard to tell any actor," says Landis. "You feel guilty." But not
guilty enough, generally, to do what Landis did next, which was to give his
mother a credit anyway: "Woman on the cutting-room floor: Shirley Levine."
