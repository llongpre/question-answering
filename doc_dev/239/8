   Returning to his bad-guy beginnings, Richard
Gere is back in the movie fast lane after a lapse that had
Hollywood wondering if he was more interested in causes than an
acting career.
   Gere crashed onto the movie scene in 1977 as one of Diane
Keaton's sleazy boyfriends in ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar.'' It was a
small part and helped get him the lead as the male prostitute in
the seamy ``American Gigolo'' in 1980.
   He soon became a top leading man, most notably in the 1982 hit
``An Officer and a Gentleman.'' A few bombs followed, then a long
absence from the screen. He seemed to be devoting all his energies
to alerting the public to the longtime Chinese repression in Tibet.
   Now Gere has returned to the movie bigtime in Paramount
Picture's ``Internal Affairs,'' starring as a crooked cop. The film
received mixed reviews from critics, but has found favor with
audiences, earning $11 million in two weeks.
   Gere next appears in a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts,
``Pretty Woman,'' for Touchstone Pictures.
   ``Internal Affairs'' casts Gere as Dennis Peck, a veteran Los
Angeles street cop who has become an expert in extortion and
murder-for-hire. Andy Garcia is the detective who investigates him.
Peck is a thorough sleaze and misogynist, but Gere doesn't see him
that way.
   ``He doesn't think he's bad. You know, this was a very tough
script. It was a very disturbing read, as well as to see it. I had
to really look into it to see what was so disturbing and what was
worthwhile about the film,'' Gere said.
   ``I realized that it was similar to Iago and Othello. It was
that kind of evil: the evil of Iago. In Peck's case it was the same
as Othello; it was jealousy that he pinpoints.
   ``The more I looked into him, the more I saw of this incredible
megalomaniac control _ not the small kind that we have in most of
our lives, but an extraordinary kind of octopus of arms and
tentacles going out in all directions. He had five wives and ten
kids, and he controlled these families as well as the police
department. But on the other hand, he did not need to be more than
a foot soldier.''
   Gere plays his own age, 40, graying hair and all. He sounds like
an old-timer when he comments about co-star Garcia: ``I saw in him
_ he's in his early 30s _ a lot of myself when I was his age. I had
the same level of intensity that he's coming from.''
   He added with a grin: ``I keep telling them I can play 18 but
they don't believe me. (Age) doesn't bother me either way. There
are a couple of films I'm developing that would be aging movies,
from the late 20s into the 50s. Certainly playing the younger of
those characters I would dye my hair.''
   Throughout his career, Gere has never been comfortable with
interviews. But he seemed more at ease when he was recently here to
promote ``Internal Affairs.'' Except for the little-seen ``Miles
From Home,'' he has been absent from the big screen for three
years. During much of that time he devoted himself to the cause of
his longtime friend, the Dalai Lama. The actor helped establish
Tibet House New York, aimed at preserving the country's heritage.
   Two events last year helped bring Tibet's plight to the world's
attention, he said, citing the massacre during pro-democracy
protests by Chinese students in Tiananmen Square, and the awarding
of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama _ Gere attended the
presentation ceremonies in Oslo, Norway.
   He said Tiananmen Square was ``perhaps 10 percent of what the
Chinese have been doing every day in Tibet for 35 years.''
   Gere was born in Philadelphia and grew up on a farm near
Syracuse, N.Y. He remembers his debut as an actor: ``My first role
was Santa Claus in the second grade. My mother made the costume
herself, which she still reminds me of. In high school I played the
president of the United States, and the entire audience of my peers
started howling that Dick Gere was playing the president.
   ``At 19 I left college (University of Massachusetts), thinking I
had done nothing with my life. That's when I went into repertory.''
   After work at the Provincetown Playhouse and the Seattle
Repertory Theater, he played off-Broadway roles and Danny Zuko in
the New York and London companies of ``Grease.'' His film debut
came in Terence Malick's ``Days of Heaven.'' He also co-starred in
the Broadway production of ``Bent'' after ``American Gigolo.''
   A series of mishaps _ ``Breathless,'' ``Beyond the Limits,''
``The Cotton Club,'' ``King David,'' ``Power,'' ``No Mercy'' _
spelled trouble for Gere's career. But like John Travolta with
``Look Who's Talking,'' he appears on the rebound.
   Of his recent absence, he said: ``It wasn't the wisest thing in
the world, but I'm in this for the rest of my life. As long as I
can keep growing as an individual, the career will take care of
itself.''
