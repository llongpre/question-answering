   It's not often a playwright gets a second chance
with a play, much less a third.
   Terrence McNally has had three productions of ``The Lisbon
Traviata'' done in New York since 1985. And the latest incarnation,
which opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's Promenade Theatre, is the
most satisfying yet.
   What the playwright has done is more than refine the second
version performed earlier this year at Manhattan Theatre Club. He
has radically changed its ending and deepened the characters,
particularly its protagonist, a bitter, cynical and self-centered
homosexual named Stephen.
   McNally's play deals with the comic and tragic sides of
obsession, in this case the adoration of opera star Maria Callas.
   The comedy occupies most of Act 1 and is anchored in the
character of Mendy, played with comic bravura by Nathan Lane.
Swaddled in a sagging, red satin bathrobe, Mendy sashays through
the first act, mocking every opera diva except the divine Maria.
She is his reason for living. And when Stephen tells him he has a
pirated recording of Callas' ``La Traviata,'' sung in Lisbon, Mendy
must hear it.
   Stephen shares that obsession and has another obsession of his
own, the breakup of his relationship with Michael, a doctor, who
has found someone else. This triangle becomes the focus of the
emotionally charged second act.
   In earlier versions, it was difficult to shift gears, to make
the adjustment from the wicked hilarity of Act 1 to the dramatic
fireworks of Act 2.
   McNally has made the play less violent but also more believable.
He has sacrificed a grand, almost operatic gesture for what is a
more likely and much sadder conclusion.
   Other members of the MTC cast repeat their performances here.
Anthony Heald is remarkable as the unhappy and sour Stephen. It's a
difficult role, halfway between hero and villain. Heald
successfully negotiates the contradiction. Dan Butler plays his
lover with dignity and a quiet intensity that is compelling, while
John Slattery is fine as the man who comes between them.
   This new production confirms that ``The Lisbon Traviata'' is one
of McNally's best plays, full of slashing, savage wit and an added
dimension of humanity that comes from its much more realistic and,
ultimately more moving, finale.
