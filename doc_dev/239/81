   Richard Barr, a Broadway producer and director
who presented the Tony-award winning ``Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?'' by Edward Albee, has died at age 71.
   Barr, a Manhattan resident, died Monday of liver failure at Mount
Sinai Hospital. He had been suffering from exposure to HIV, the
virus associated with AIDS, said Shirley Herz, his spokeswoman.
   Barr, who was president of the League of American Theaters and
Producers for 21 years until his death, was preparing a new Albee
drama, ``Marriage Play'' for Broadway.
   He presented many of Albee's plays on and off-Broadway including
``Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?'' ``A Delicate Balance'' and
``Seascape.''
   Barr also presented some of the first works by such authors as
Sam Shepard, Lanford Wilson, John Guare, A.R. Gurney and Terrence
McNally through the Playwrights' Unit, a production company he
founded with Albee and Clinton Wilder.
   Born on Sept. 6, 1917, Barr grew up in Washington and graduated
in 1938 from Princeton University, where he acted in plays.
   He began his theater career in the late 1930s working for Orson
Welles' Mercury Theater and was a production assistant for Welles'
radio program ``War of the Worlds.'' He also worked as Welles'
executive assistant on the film ``Citizen Kane.''
   Barr first began producing plays on Broadway and on tour during
the late 1940s and early '50s, but attracted considerable attention
off-Broadway in 1960 with a double bill of one-act plays, ``Krapp's
Last Tape'' by Samuel Beckett and Albee's ``The Zoo Story.'' He went
on to present more works by Albee off-Broadway including ``The Death
of Bessie Smith,'' ``The Sandbox'' and ``The American Dream.''
   One of Barr's biggest successes was the Broadway production of
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' The story of a disintegrating
marriage, the play starred Uta Hagen and Arthur Hill and opened on
Broadway at the Billy Rose Theater in October 1962. It won the Tony
award for best play the following year.
   Among Barr's other successes were ``The Boys in the Band'' in
1968 and ``Sweeney Todd,'' the Stephen Sondheim musical, in 1979.
His last production was James Duff's ``Home Front'' which had a
short run on Broadway in 1987.
   Barr is survived by his mother, Ruth Baer, and two sisters, Carol
Fischer and Barbara Luchs, all of Washington.
