<LEADPARA>  The 49ers whittled their roster to 47 players Sunday to meet today's deadline.
But one decision was made easier for them, because of cornerback Darryl
Pollard's misfortune.;   Pollard underwent surgery late Saturday to repair a
broken fibula in his left leg and will be out at least 12 weeks, according to
a team spokesman. The injury, sustained Friday in the 49ers' final exhibition
game against Seattle, was originally thought to be torn ligaments. But surgery
revealed a broken bone, and a pin was inserted in Pollard's leg.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Pollard will almost certainly be placed on injured reserve before today's
final cuts, meaning he will be lost to the 49ers for the season. Joining
Pollard on the injured reserve list will probably be rookie offensive lineman
Scott Bowles, who has a pinched nerve in his neck, and rookie running back
Sheldon Canley of San Jose State, who has a hamstring injury.;   The 49ers
must waive 13 players or place them on reserve lists by 9 a.m. today.;  
Though team officials were unavailable to reporters Sunday, a team source
confirmed that the candidates to be waived today are punters Ralf Mojsiejenko
and Paul McJulien; linebackers Antonio Goss, Martin Harrison and LeRoy
Etienne; offensive linemen Dean Caliguire and Tom Neville; defensive lineman
Alonzo Mitz; and running backs Terrence Flagler and Adam Walker. The source
said the list could change in late meetings.;   Flagler, the 49ers'
first-round pick from Clemson in 1987, was told he would be leaving the 49ers
for the second time. Since rejoining the team two weeks ago, he has rushed 17
times for 19 yards in two exhibition games.;   "Hopefully, I can get picked
up," Flagler said. But that seems unlikely. Since being traded last year,
Flagler has been let go by both Dallas and Phoenix.;   The 49ers will probably
place rookie running back Ricky Watters, rookie offensive lineman Harry
Boatswain and rookie cornerback Merton Hanks on injured reserve after today's
cuts.;   Moving players to injured reserve after the cuts will open spots for
other players, who can be brought back. But the 49ers will have to expose
players they hope to keep on the waiver wire.;   Last year the 49ers waived
linebacker Keena Turner and punter Barry Helton in the final cut and brought
them both back the next day when they went on injured reserve.;   The 49ers
called both punters Mojsiejenko and McJulien in Sunday and will waive both,
with the intent of bringing one back.;   "That's my gut feeling," said
Mojsiejenko, who was told he was released.;   Neither is likely to get claimed
off the waiver wire.;   The 49ers may also take risks with offensive linemen.
Boatswain may be placed on injured reserve and either Caliguire or Neville
will be recalled. Guard Ricky Siglar, waived last week, was back at the 49ers
facility Sunday and may be re-signed next week as an insurance policy.;  
Bowles suffered a stinger in his neck last week that has weakened his arms. He
did not dress for the Seattle game.;   "They told me they were going to decide
tomorrow," Bowles said. "They may put me on I.R.";   It is unlikely that the
49ers will take a risk of losing any promising young prospect, preferring
instead to keep them within the system, even if it means stashing them on
injured reserve for a year. Last year, the 49ers tried to sneak rookie
defensive back Anthony Shelton through the waiver wire and lost him to San
Diego, a move the team regretted later.; POSITION BY POSITION LOOK AT 49ERS;
