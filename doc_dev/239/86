<LEADPARA>  ALREADY, at age 12, he's worried about being typecast.;   "Everybody always
says to me when they see me, 'Oh, that's Macaulay Culkin, the 'Home Alone'
kid,' " says the towheaded star of the third-highest grossing film of all time.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     His theatrical sigh is worthy of a Barrymore. "But I don't always want to
be thought of as just the 'Home Alone' kid, you know?";   He leans forward in
his chair menacingly, affecting a look of pain even Al Pacino would envy.;  
"There's more to me, you know? I'm not Macaulay Culkin, 'Home Alone' kid. I'm
Macaulay Culkin . . . ," he searches for the word, and finds it, " . . .
Actor.";   To be honest, he's more than that -- much more, thanks to the
international success of "Home Alone," which last year grossed more than $300
million in the United States. In the past year, he has nabbed more magazine
covers than Cher and become the most sought-after Hollywood child star since
Shirley Temple. Last week, he hosted "Saturday Night Live.";   He is, in
short, a prepubescent phenomenon who makes as much per picture as Meryl
Streep. For "Home Alone" he received $150,000; for the sequel, his paycheck
will be $4 million).;   But Macaulay, dashing in jeans and what looks to be a
Garanimals top, says you must understand something: He's not in it for the
money. Oh no, no, no.;   Making allowances;   "I only get five bucks a day,"
he says coolly. "My parents take care of the rest." His concern, he says, is
the work. "I like to act. Acting is my thing. And that's why I wanted to do
'My Girl.' ";   Indeed, the part Macaulay plays in his "Home Alone" follow-up
is the juiciest child part to come down the pike since the role of Bonnie Blue
Butler in "Gone With the Wind." In "My Girl," Macaulay plays Thomas J.
Sennett, a shy, sweet child allergic to just about everything, who pals around
with Anna Chlumsky's Vada Sultenfuss, the hypochondriac daughter of a
mortician (played by Dan Aykroyd). But although Anna has the larger part,
Macaulay's is more dramatic. After all, he gets to play out every actor's
fantasy: a death scene.;   "I get stung to death!" he says, incongruously
chipper as he explains the film's climax. "What did I think when I was doing
it? I thought, 'I'm crazy! What am I doing here! Cut, cut, cut!' ";   He
laughs so long he has trouble catching his breath; then he calms himself and,
like a pro, explains the pivotal scene.;   "There were millions of bees around
me, see? And they put this pollen stuff on each finger, see? That's how they
got the bees to swarm around me. I got stung once. See?" Macaulay shows off a
long-healed war wound on his toothpick-thin right arm. "But I just kept on
acting, even with the bees." His lips curl into a smile. "It was the most
challenging scene of my career.";   News of Macaulay's death scene in "My
Girl" filtered out of Hollywood in mid-October, when columnist Marilyn Beck
broke the news. She said she revealed all so that parents who planned to take
their children to the movie could prepare a lecture on life and death. Howard
Zieff, the director of "My Girl," wasn't too pleased.;   "That was
irresponsible," he blasts. "And it's been blown way out of proportion.";   The
scene is presented in good taste, Zieff insists. An earlier cut was much more
graphic, showing Macaulay being ravaged, in slow motion, by mean little
stingers. (Anna and Macaulay, when they saw the early cut, deemed the scene
"totally cool.") But now, the film is edited so that Macaulay death occurs
off-camera.;   Brian Grazer, the film's producer, isn't too concerned with all
the commotion the death scene has whipped up. He says the film has been
screened by several child psychologists, all of whom agree the movie handles
the scene responsibly.;   "I think this kind of thing is good," he says, when
asked about Macaulay's screen demise, "because it might provoke an honest
discussion between parent and child.";   As for younger children, too young
for family discussions, Grazer says not to worry. "I have young children, and
they saw the film, and the emotional impact of the scene went right over their
heads. Adults in the theater were crying; (the kids) were just waiting for the
next action scene.";   Macaulay suggests his younger fans enter the theater
with a stiff upper lip and an open mind. "It might upset them," he says,
completely stone-faced. "But this movie shows what kids should learn -- that
people do die." He throws up his hands. "You live, and then you die. That's
life, you know?";   Yeah, but what was it like to have to crawl into a coffin
at the age of 12? "It was good," he said wearily, "because I got to catch up
on my rest.";   Indeed, Macaulay has had a whirlwind year. "I do wish I could
do the things that other kids do," he says.;   When he's not traveling or
attending private school in New York state, where he lives with his parents
and six brothers and sisters ("My mom's trying to have another, but I don't
think so!"), Macaulay says he concerns himself with trying to find the plum
roles. "My dad reads the scripts and then tells me about it. Then, we
decide.";   Some Hollywood insiders have a different tale to tell, however.
Kip Culkin, the stories go, has become a Svengali who is more than happy to
exploit his son's star power.;   One story revolves around director Michael
Lehmann (of "Heathers" fame), who for the past year has been working on a film
called "The Good Son." When actor-turned-manager Kip Culkin saw the script, he
reportedly asked if Macaulay could read for the starring role, a 14-year-old
bad seed of a boy.;   The littlest prima donna?;   Lehmann agreed, the story
goes, but after the meeting, told Culkin that his son was too young and
unseasoned. Lehmann continued the process of casting and mounting the film.
Sets were built, and the lead roles were cast.;   But suddenly, Culkin
reportedly decided to play hard ball. Sources say that he told 20th-Century
Fox Chairman Joe Roth that Macaulay would not do "Home Alone 2" unless he
landed the "Good Son" role (Fox is producing both pictures). So, even though
the cameras were ready to roll in February, "The Good Son" was postponed until
after the "Home Alone 2" winter shoot, resulting in a Fox loss of millions of
dollars.;   Lehmann, who is said to be devastated over having his power
usurped by a 12-year-old, isn't talking; neither is Culkin.;   Macaulay,
however, is happy to talk, though he seems a tad confused on the subject. He
says he might be doing "The Good Son," but doesn't know when because "my mom
and dad take care of that." He also claims to be in the dark over when "Home
Alone 2" will start filming. "I heard maybe February, maybe March." Actual
starting date: mid-December.;   There are rumors, too, that Macaulay has
become a prima donna, who, some whisper, demanded rewrites on "Home Alone 2"
because he didn't like his lines. He denies this. "I just do it the way it was
written," he says.;   Jamie Lee Curtis, who stars in "My Girl" with Macaulay,
agrees that he's no handful. "He's a normal little boy who listens to Vanilla
Ice on his Walkman and likes to ride his bicycle. He's the farthest thing from
a brat you could find.";   Michael and Macaulay;   Rumors about his runaway
ego batted down, Macaulay freely discusses other topics, like his strange
friendship with Michael Jackson. For the record, he says, Jackson did not
treat his family to a trip to Bermuda as the tabloids have it. "It was just
me!";   What do the two do together when ensconced in Jackson's Disneyland of
a home? "We play video games . . . He's like me, he likes to have fun.";  
Like all superstars, of course, Macaulay says he is pursued by rabid fans. But
the kids who corner him aren't too bad, he says. "They just want to know,
'Hey, can you get me a role in 'Home Alone 2?' ";   As for all those little
female groupies -- forget it. Unlike most male stars who use their star-power
cachet to play the field, Macaulay is a one-woman man.;   "I already have a
girlfriend, you see," he says, smiling coyly. "And she's a younger woman.
She's going to be 11 in December."  </TEXT>
