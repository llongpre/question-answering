Ever been so wretched that you ate Spaghetti-Os cold from a can? That the clean 
unsorted laundry piled up until it threatened to overrun the place? That's 
major depression, and the wonder is that its numbing realities could be part of 
a movie with the surprise and the elation of "Men Don't Leave" (throughout San 
Diego County). The year's first tonic, it's a tender, beautifully acted, 
diabolically droll film on the subject of love, loss and the sheer blissful 
unpredictability of life. 
</P>
<P>
It's that unpredictability that holds the movie's charm, not the picture's 
subject matter, which is moving but far from startling. It's the what-if 
nightmare familiar to every neurotic worthy of the name: "What would I do if I 
lost you?" Renovating their comfortable house in the suburbs of Baltimore, the 
Macauleys -- John (Tom Mason) and Beth (Jessica Lange) and their sons, teen-age 
Chris (Chris O'Donnell) and 9-year-old Matt (Charlie Korsmo) -- are a 
close-knit, cheerfully ordinary family until tragedy hits. 
</P>
<P>
Director Paul Brickman, in his first film since "Risky Business," and his 
co-writer, Barbara Benedek (of "The Big Chill" and, alas, "Immediate Family"), 
give this not-uncommon situation unexpected delights of character. While "Men 
Don't Leave" is rooted in real emotions, it also has the highest concentration 
of grand and endearingly offbeat characters since "The Accidental Tourist." 
</P>
<P>
They include Joan Cusack as a preternaturally self-assured hospital X-ray 
technician; Kathy Bates as the Baltimore gourmet shop owner who finally employs 
the widowed Lange, and Arliss Howard as a witty, laconic composer whose music 
is scored for typewriters, full orchestra and pedal steel. The secret, of 
course, is that none of the three consider themselves offbeat; they simply go 
about their lives at an oblique angle to the rest of the functioning world. 
</P>
<P>
Lange's first months on her own with her sons are a litany of necessary 
adjustments: the crackerbox Baltimore apartment that takes the place of their 
overmortgaged, underinsured house; Lange's desperately overbright job 
interviews and the boys' unexpected choices of new friends in the big city. For 
O'Donnell, it's Cusack, a ditsy "older woman" in their apartment building; for 
Korsmo, it's a friendly fellow fourth-grader who uses a switch-blade to divide 
his Milk Duds and whose after-school activities would give his parents 
nightmares, if they ever suspected them. 
</P>
<P>
The screenplay is most perceptive as it suggests the ways that even the most 
closely knit family can unravel. Lange must cope with her 17-year-old's playing 
man of the house -- at her house and Cusack's; with her 9-year-old's poignant 
search for an ideal family, and with her own growing depression as she tries to 
keep every base covered at once. 
</P>
<P>
The script may strain our good will slightly with its lottery-ticket subplot or 
with Arliss Howard's deadpan Charles Simon, who seems to have every virtue -- 
including being recently unattached. Immediately intrigued by Lange, his remedy 
for her sadness is an uninhibited night out at a polka hall "where everybody's 
fatter than you and there's no shame." A lusty, measurable attraction springs 
up between the two, both recovering souls, but unfortunately Howard arrives too 
soon in her mourning process. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Macauley emerges as a performance of heart, complexity and enormously 
subtle shadings, Lange's best since "Tootsie." It's nice to have an outlet for 
Lange's humor again, in physical moments like her hilarious polka scene, or as 
she snarls in outrage as the professionally soothing Cusack marches in to treat 
her clinical depression. 
</P>
<P>
"Men Don't Leave" (rated PG-13) doesn't depend on Lange's virtuosity alone, 
however; it's ensemble stuff in the hands of an uncommonly sensitive and 
inventive director. Its most poignant scene goes to Chris O'Donnell, pleading 
his mother's case with Howard. Brickman wisely keeps his camera on the boy's 
agonized face and lets the scene run until it cracks the heart. 
</P>
<P>
In among these adult pros -- including a Cusack at the very top of her form and 
a hell-for-leather character for Kathy Bates -- what Brickman has gotten from 
these two young debuting actors is stunning. Subject to a barrage of 
conflicting emotions, O'Donnell is sensitive, funny and furious, by degrees, 
and the younger Korsmo seems likely to take over from the gifted Lukas Haas as 
that actor grows into older roles. 
</P>
<P>
Every single technical credit is fine: Bruce Surtees' moody, evocative lighting 
camera work; Richard Chew's impeccable editing; Susan Becker's deliberately 
unchic costumes for Lange; the production design of Barbara Ling and Curt 
Frisk's sound recording, which turns the noise of that X-ray, buckling in 
O'Donnell's hand as he prepares to meet adulthood, into witty aural 
punctuation.
