Steven Bauer is wasted in the silly, old-fashioned 1984 Thief of Hearts (KCOP, 
Sunday at 6 p.m.) as a sleek burglar who falls for a high-tech interior 
designer (Barbara Williams) when he reads the drivel in her stolen diaries. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Apted's well-made but thin 1984 Firstborn (KCOP, Monday at 8 p.m.) 
finds Teri Garr's vulnerable, well-fixed divorcee falling for an 
all-too-obviously dangerous loser (Peter Weller), viewed by Garr's sons with 
increasing horror.

Sunburn (KTTV, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) finds Charles Grodin as a cocky, nebbish 
insurance investigator looking into a death in Acapulco and renting Farrah 
Fawcett to cover as his wife. Sloppy, witless, forced, characterless. 
</P>
<P>
The deft Back to the Beach (KCOP, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) imagines that Annette 
Funicello and Frankie Avalon of all those "Beach Party" movies of the early 
U60s got married and settled down in Ohio. The film is nostalgic without being 
embarrassing and knowing without being either cruel or cynical.

Richard Franklin's 1981 Road Games (KTLA, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a nifty 
Australian thriller starring Stacy Keach as a truck driver and Jamie Lee Curtis 
as a hitchhiker who are pursued by a killer across a vast desert. Nice 
Hitchcock touches along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Battle Beyond the Stars (KTTV, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a "Star Wars" carbon with 
a "Seven Samurai" plot; cut-rate but blessed by a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Terence Malick's 1978 Days of Heaven (KCOP, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is one of the 
most beautiful color films ever made, a poetic turn-of-the-century love 
triangle set against a wheat harvest in the Midwest and involving Richard Gere, 
Brooke Adams and Sam Shepard. Nestor Almendros won an Oscar for his glorious 
70mm camerawork.

<P>
The Kidnapping of the President (KTLA, Friday at 8 p.m.), a not-bad 1980 
theatrical production that was sold directly to TV, stars Hal Holbrook as a 
U.S. President who fails to heed the warning of Secret Service deputy director 
William Shatner that a group of South American terrorists may be planning to 
disrupt his visit to Canada. With Van Johnson and Ava Gardner.

Photo, Director Elia Kazan's unforgettable 1955 film of John Steinbeck's "East 
of Eden" (KCOP, Friday at 8 p.m.) stars James Dean as the tormented Salinas 
Valley youth with a stern father and a mother who turns out to be the local 
hard-bitten madam. With Julie Harris.
