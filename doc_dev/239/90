   Art collector Robert Berdella told
investigators his fascination with the 1965 movie ``The Collector''
may help explain why he tied up six men and sexually tortured them
before killing them.
   The movie starring Terrence Stamp and Samantha Eggar is about a
man who keeps a woman in chains in his basement hoping she will fall
in love with him. She eventually dies of pneumonia.
   ``He said he had seen that movie several years ago and that he
may have fantasized about living out what was depicted in that
movie,'' said Sgt. Troy Cole, who headed the investigation into the
killings.
   Berdella first described the movie during the three days he was
interviewed last week, and then remembered its title, said Det.
Albert DeValkenaere.
   ``Sometimes he just would head off in other directions,''
DeValkenaere said. ``He didn't come right out and say this (the
movie) is why'' he killed the men.
   Berdella had remained silent about his motives since his arrest
in April. He reached agreement to confess to the killings to avoid
the death penalty.
   Berdella, who had admitted one murder earlier, confessed to five
more Monday and was given life prison sentences in the deaths.
   Two of the victims suffocated, one died of blood loss and
infection from being sexually tortured and three others died of a
combination of being gagged and injected with animal tranquilizers.
   Berdella kept the victims tied to a bed in his midtown Kansas
City home until their deaths.
   Berdella owned a flea-market shop, Bob's Bazaar Bizarre, where he
sold trinkets from around the world as well as jewelry he designed
himself. Most of his collected artifacts, including 2,000-year-old
Roman vials said to be filled with tears, Tibetan exorcism knives,
costume masks from Sri Lanka and puppets from Asia and Thailand,
were sold at an auction to help pay his legal bills.
