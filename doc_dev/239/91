The Venice Film Festival has reached an alarming stage. Instead of feeling
as we critics should during these events - like hardworking martyrs to art
with subtitles permanently dancing before our eyes - we have been enjoying
almost every new movie.
From the latest Woody Allen comedy Bullets Over Broadway we jaunt over to a
midnight Harrison Ford romp, Clear And Present Danger. From a jolly Spanish
film about love and acrobatics, The Tit And The Moon, we proceed to a
nailbiting, inspired Danish TV series about a haunted hospital, The Kingdom,
before skipping over to Heavenly Creatures, a truth-based New Zealand black
comedy about two schoolgirls who murder for their friendship.
Jury president David Lynch was seen leaving this last in a glow of
approbation, so the Golden Lion may reach a long paw into the Antipodes next
Monday. Heavenly Creatures was co-written and directed by Peter Jackson,
best known for spoof splatter films like Brain Dead. Here he has held back
on the flying intestines but not the sense of camp hyperbole.
This 1950s Christchurch is awash with picket-fence prettiness and twittering
moral decency - Lynch territory par excellence - as Pauline (Melanie
Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet) form their fantasy-filled friendship.
This is fed by their own tales of castles and kings, and served by Jackson's
blithe camera arabesques and transformation scenes. Gasp at the Sound Of
Music-style helicopter shot of Juliet running over a hill; gasp again when
that landscape is metamorphosed into a lush palace garden. Unicorns,
fountains, butterflies large as hang-gliders ..
It all ends in blood and tears, as the two girls' parents, who condemn the
friendship as 'unhealthy' and 'unwholesome', predict it will. But for the
audience, what a movie ride before we hit the buffers.
The only other Venice movie on this scale of robust postmodernism - witty
exaggeration built into the po-faced melodrama - was Lars Von Trier's The
Kingdom.
This is not a movie at all but more a four-part, 4 1/2 -then-two-hour TV
series, shot with a handheld camera in poverty-row monochrome. But it proves
the Danish director of acclaimed style-pieces The Element Of Crime and
Europa can turn on the magic without tricksy optical effects.
In this Lynch-lore festival you could call The Kingdom 'Twin Peaks in a
hospital': teasingly quotidian setting; weirder and weirder characters;
emergency outbreaks of non-sequitur; the apocalypse of ghosts and guilty
secrets.
But Trier and Niels Vorsel's script has a start-to-finish logic that Peaks
never quite had. Its perfectly meshed characters - the sarcastic Swedish
neuro-consultant, the solemnly deranged anatomy lecturer, the
hypochondriacal old lady who hears 'voices' in the lift shaft - give the
story a strong, even Ibsenite, vertebra, while the wacky toll of severed
heads, masonic rituals and self-destruct surgery provides the gymnastic
freedom of narrative.
In the vain quest for a dud film at this festival we critics tried
everything. A Woody Allen film without Woody? That might be a trial. But no
 -it was Bullets Over Broadway, a sparkling comedy of theatre manners, with
gangsters, gags and the funniest not-by-Woody performance in the entire
Allen cannon. This was Dianne Wiest's vainglorious actress: sighing,
soaring, scatterbrained, Gloria Swanson crossed with Margaret Dumont.
Then there was the movie from Spain's Bigas Luna, late of Goldenballs, about
the little boy, his older pal and the big-breasted circus ballerina they
fight over. Tiresome Fellini rip-off? No. Charming, stylish and funny.
How about Jefery Levy's SFW? This rock-scored, kaleidoscopic US movie is
about a young hostage-crisis survivor (Backbeat's Stephen Dorff), who after
36 days in a convenience store at the mercy of a lunatic's video-camera
whose images were broadcast 'live' across the nation, tries to adjust to the
vulgar glare of media heroism. It threatens to be a glib, easy-target
topical melodrama but gains in wit and bite as it goes on.
The only undisputed flops have been Alexandre Rockwell's Somebody To Love -
a drippy New York love story set among what seem to be the underworld folk
left over from Woody Allen's film - and Ermanno Olmi's The Bible Part 1.
This is subtitled Genesis: Creation And Flood - and yes, Olmi plans to film
the entire Good Book.
Not like this, we hope. The Noah sequence aside, with its eye-catching ark
and brief warmth of human detail, the film is no more than a glorified
nature documentary set to a maunderingly 'prophetic' voice-over.
The Olmi style seems even more ossified in a festival that has just produced
Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers. Some people loved this film, some hated
it. The only sane response is to do both.
Based on a story by Hollywood's favourite enfant terrible Quentin Tarantino
(Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction), the movie is a two-hour bloodbath. The main
terrorists are a young couple (Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis) who, after a
cross-country murder spree in the film's first half, repeat the mayhem when
they break out of jail in the second.
That Oliver Stone was becoming an eccentric film-maker we knew from the St
Vitus style of JFK. But even that seems measured beside the poetic epilepsy
of this film. Manic jump-cuts; topsy-turvy angles; high-speed alternations
between black-and-white and colour, film and video, reality and
hallucination; split-second bits of newsreel, animation.
Since the soundtrack also bawls out rock music, some have called the whole
thing a feature-length pop promo. But it is much more. Despite the suspect
encouragement it might offer susceptible filmgoers - that killing is
exhilarating - it is inspired.
The fragmented approach is not arbitrary. Stone offers us different ways of
viewing the same story at the same time: documentary, fantasy, home movie,
even sitcom. Scenes from the girl's childhood are enacted as clips from a TV
comedy series, with comic Rodney Dangerfield as Dad and canned laughter
greeting each dialogue exchange. Later, Stone derides the couch potato
culture again in the figure of an Aussie-accented tabloid-TV interviewer
(Robert Downey Jr, very funny) who follows the couple's jailbreak live.
Natural Born Killers is an alarming work, and for some a demented one.
(Tarantino himself has disowned the movie). But you cannot expect tranquil
responses to a film that proposes a whole new direction for film-making
itself - and that never offers spectators the soft option of a single,
moralising perspective on its bloody subject.
