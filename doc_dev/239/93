"PIGLET SIDLED up to Pooh from behind. 'Pooh,' he whispered. 'Yes, Piglet.' 
'Nothing,' said Piglet, taking Pooh's paw. 'I just wanted to be sure of you.' "

This is from A. A. Milne's "Winnie The Pooh" and is probably the thing that 
made Dorothy Parker, the "Constant Reader" of The New Yorker, write, "Tonstant 
Reader frowed up!"

AS LONG as we are in a positive vein, let's send up a post-Thanksgiving hosanna 
for the Walt Disney guys and their new production, "The Little Mermaid," the 
first traditional fairy tale of its kind from the Disney animators since 1959, 
when they released "Sleeping Beauty." What a winner for the coming Christmas 
season! And if you have noticed that some Disney commercials appeal to kids, 
while others appeal to grown-ups, well, that's how the film goes as well. This 
wonderful experience is a treat for everybody in the family.

I loved the crab impresario, Sebastian (voice by Samuel E. Wright), and his 
Jamaican and calypso and reggae styles. Then there is Ursula, the sea witch, 
looking divine and with the voice of actress Pat Carroll. Kudos to "Little Shop 
of Horrors" songwriters Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. Their songs are catchier 
than anything new on Broadway.

H-E-R-E-'S EDDIE! The "Tonight Show" sidekick, Ed McMahon, is going to wed his 
new girlfriend, Joanna Ford, in July. By then, he assumes his tempestuous 
divorce from wife, Victoria, will be all over and done with. Ed already told 
Joanna to go out and buy them a new house in the $5-million range. Joanna has 
found a place in the $8-million category. Not bad for a restaurant maitre d' 
from Ma Maison in Hollywood.

SOCIAL SPLITS from the nation's capital: Muffy and Henry Brandon have separated 
and split -- amicably. She was Nancy Reagan's first White House press 
secretary, leaving that job to go into international public relations. He was 
the former Washington correspondent for the London Sunday Times, now retired.

IF YOU think Kathleen Sullivan looks better and acts happier these days on "CBS 
This Morning," it's most likely because she IS. Kathleen had some rough times 
earlier this year, particularly when her parents were seriously injured in an 
automobile accident. I believe Kathleen had trouble finding a sympathetic ear 
at CBS for her personal problems. But now her parents are doing well. And 
Kathleen is "working out" these days with a fabulous new trainer. And, she has 
a new executive producer, Eric Sorenson of L.A.'s KCBS, who has helped smooth 
her path.

"THE LISBON TRAVIATA" is another reason to go to the Big Apple. This wonderful 
Terrence McNally play will slay you if you love opera; but even if you are like 
Jiggs of the comic strips, you'll enjoy it. Beverly Sills celebrated her 33rd 
wedding anniversary a week ago by dropping in to see it with hubby Peter 
Greenough. The opera diva just adored it; "It knocked me out," says she.
