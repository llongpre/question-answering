USC STUDENT FILMS SHOW TALENT AND HUMANE QUALITY

The lavish University of Southern California Cinema School program "First 
Look," which begins tonight, offers 26 student films in four programs, most 
mixing the usual USC high polish and technical expertise with the new emphasis 
on challenging scripts encouraged by Frank Daniel, dean of the school. Overall, 
it's a fine selection. 
</P>
<P>
The screenings, which continue on Thursday, next Tuesday and June 22, all at 
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, at 7:30 p.m., 
show less high-concept glitz, more humane grit. 
</P>
<P>
For the students themselves, there's a new inducement: a school agreement with 
Jonathan Krane of Management Co. Entertainment Group, which will underwrite the 
semi-annual showings, to develop one or more of these scripts and finance one 
or more directors. A fine spur, but it suggests a problem: As in many other 
college film programs, USC's, as of now, doesn't guarantee a fair contest. Some 
films look as if they cost $100,000 or more; some, obviously much less. As 
always, the student who, through independent means or family connections, has 
access to more money, gets a built-in, highly questionable edge. 
</P>
<P>
Those moral issues, however, are for others. We can content ourselves with a 
salute to all the participants: all the high talent and hard work visible here. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's screening includes two engagingly paranoid "What if?" comedies: Bruce 
Worrilow's "The Worst That Could Happen" -- what if an energetic pet-shop Don 
Juan impregnated all three of his revolving girlfriends? And Tony Kant's 
darker-hued "An Even Break" -- what if a distracted wrecker involved in a 
custody battle tore down the wrong house and got blackmailed by his boss into a 
life of crime? Also: Sharon Altman's charming ethnographic cartoon, "Maheo's 
Dance," and David Parks' "Images" a marriage memoir that suggests TV ad 
montages at their most lushly sorrowful. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat more serious is James Middleton's "Solo Run," a very compassionate 
study of the relationship of a young boy, his lesbian mother and his prejudiced 
father and stepmother. And David Hartwell's "Slipknot" -- longest and flashiest 
of the films -- uses Spielberg-DePalma camera angles and glistening colors for 
the hysterical story of a young girl watching her brother slide into drugs and 
madness. Hartwell doesn't indict the usual villains of these "Splendor in the 
Grass"-style romantic essays -- the parents -- and, at times, he overtips into 
"Reefer Madness" camp. But he doesn't shoot a dull frame and his lead actress, 
Kate Hall, has powerful moments. 
</P>
<P>
Program 2 (Thursday) includes two interesting documentaries: Brian Fairlee's 
"My Friends, My Friends" on teen-age drunk driving in a small Northern 
California town and Maria Gallagher's more ambitious "Face Value," which 
follows a young 15-year-old prospective cover girl through the glib wilderness 
of high-fashion huckstering. Elizabeth Passarelli's "Dark Rooms," a blend of 
documentary techniques and drama, re-creates the dilemma of a young girl 
date-raped at a party, with unusual truth and objectivity. Mar Elepano and 
Screescanda's "A La Turk" adds visual embellishments patterned on Norman 
McLaren and Oskar Fischinger onto the Dave Brubeck Quartet's "Blue Rondo." And 
"Channing," directed by John Shorney and written by Adam Belanoff (one of 
several films transferred from video), has effective low-key child acting -- by 
Gary Cohen and Joshua Smith, in a pleasant, if oft-repeated, tale of the brainy 
kid and his schoolyard tormentor. 
</P>
<P>
On Program 3, (next Tuesday), another, more conventional small town -- with 
youngsters seeking escape, ensnared by villains and daddy-cops -- turns up in 
"Shelter in the Storm," directed by David Klass, written by Alex Graves. Both 
"Jack Falls Down" (directed by John Kim, written by Michael Matlock) and "Life 
Could be Worse" (directed by Ron Rosen, written by Jeff X. Rothstein) offer 
romantic fables about games with the hereafter. Death intrudes in the former, 
to bring a couple of insurance people dangerously together in a clock-race 
dance of murder. In the latter, more comically, an obsessed Jewish mortuary 
owner, gets advice from the beyond on handling his recalcitrant son; here, the 
acting ensemble tempers sitcom exaggerations with cute, deft little throwaways. 
</P>
<P>
On Program 4 (June 22), Todd Yellin's racily funny, high-pressure "The Eternal 
Pitch" has another clock-race: a gambling telephone salesman trying to snap up 
10 customers by midnight to save himself from disaster. Howard Slavitt's 
"Summer Rain" is another memory piece -- with sexual tensions lurking under a 
Norman Rockwell period family outing. Charles Evans' "Second Son," a slightly 
strained melodrama about a rich boy seeking to rescue his black ex-maid from 
drunkenness and her macho Marine son, has poignant central performances by 
singer Ketty Lester, Byron Thames and Michael James. And Dennis Dimster-Denk's 
"Concrete River," the only overtly experimental work, is a good, 
impressionistic study of the L.A. freeways, with an undercurrent of malaise and 
melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
One fascinating comparison: The widely different films that two directors, 
Rusty Gorman and Nicole Bettauer, make from the same screenplay: Paul 
McCudden's excellent medieval fable, "Tree of Battles" -- with its intense 
evocation of a plague-ridden France, a wandering, English knight and the French 
peasant boy yoked to him, by death and isolation. Both versions work: Gorman's 
(on Thursday) is more real, rawer, closer to the ground, shot through the weeds 
and dirt; Bettauer's (next Tuesday) is more glossily epic and picturesque, in 
the "Ladyhawke" vein.
