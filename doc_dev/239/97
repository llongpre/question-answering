*** BRANFORD MARSALIS ET AL. "Music From 'Mo' Better Blues' "; Columbia 
</P>
<P>
This album by the Marsalis quintet, with Terrence Blanchard in the trumpet role 
played in the film by actor Denzel Washington, is an amalgam of hard bop, 
R&amp;B and other diversions and will appeal mainly to those who have seen the 
film. The title cut, and the ballad "Again Never," both composed by Spike Lee's 
father, Bill Lee, stand out. There are two versions of W.C. Handy's antique 
"Harlem Blues," updated and sung by Cynda Williams, the actress/vocalist who 
performed the songs on screen. Caveat: fast forward through "Pop Top 40," an 
out-of-context pseudo-pop affair, and "Jazz Thing," a simplistic pocket history 
of jazz in rap form.

*** ANDRE PREVIN "Uptown" Telarc 
</P>
<P>
Previn edges even closer to pristine form in this, his second comeback-to-jazz 
celebration. Bassist Ray Brown is on hand again, and this time the guitarist is 
the long-respected Mundell Lowe. The subject matter helps: six Harold Arlen 
songs, seven Ellingtons, and one Duke-associated pop tune, "Five o'Clock 
Whistle." Previn nudges his way obliquely into a sensitive "Come Rain or Come 
Shine," and achieves a spiritual beauty on "Come Sunday." Except for the 
slightly hasty "It Don't Mean a Thing," everything swings with the utmost ease.

**** TERRY GIBBS DREAM BAND "Volume Four: Main Stem" Contemporary 
</P>
<P>
This Gibbs CD is surely the livest live session on record. Here are 17 men and 
a woman (pianist Pat Moran) who think as one, captured with brilliant sound (by 
the late engineer Wally Heider) at the Summit, the Hollywood nightspot that now 
houses the Club Lingerie. The leader's vibes are ingeniously woven into the 
arrangements by Bill Holman, Shorty Rogers and Al Cohn along with booting 
contributions by such soloists as trombonist Frank Rosolino, reedmen Joe Maini 
and Richie Kamuca and drummer Mel Lewis, all sadly no longer around, as well as 
by trumpeter Conte Candoli and saxman Bill Perkins, who are still vitally among 
us.

** 1/2 CYBILL SHEPHERD "Vanilla" Gold Castle 
</P>
<P>
At her best, actress/singer Shepherd has revealed a genuine talent with a jazz 
sensitivity; however, this reissue of a date made in 1979, after she had 
returned home to Memphis, is weighted down by a ragged band -- Fred Ford and 
his Beale Street Orchestra. Except for the inane title tune, most of the songs 
are jazz/pop standards. Still, there is a rare value here in the person of the 
late Phineas Newborn, a jazz piano giant, and his rhythm section -- his brother 
Calvin (guitar), Jamil Nasser (bass) and Bill Tyus (drums). Shepherd is in good 
voice on "My Ship" -- where Newborn has the first chorus to himself and where 
the band is too subdued to be disconcerting. Questions: Whatever became of that 
fine album she made backed by Stan Getz? Why doesn't she return now to the 
studios, to make the superior jazz session of which she is capable?

*** 1/2 VINCENT HERRING "American Experience" Music Masters 
</P>
<P>
Herring, now 25, taped these sessions in 1986 and 1989 with two different but 
equally compatible hard bop groups. Heard recently in Nat Adderley's quintet, 
he has emerged as one of the most passionate new voices on alto and soprano 
saxophones. He is represented as a composer along with Charles Lloyd, Horace 
Silver and his pianist Bruce Barth. The earlier cuts, made when he was only 21, 
reveal that he had already reached a rare plateau of maturity. Herring has come 
a long way from the streets of Manhattan, where he was playing outdoors as 
recently as 1984. LEONARD FEATHER
