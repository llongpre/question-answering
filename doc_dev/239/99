To review or not to review.

The dilemma has spun a web of controversy and conflict around "Kiss of the 
Spider Woman," the first offering of an ambitious, for-profit laboratory for 
new American musicals. 
</P>
<P>
A musical version of the film that won William Hurt an Oscar was reviewed today 
in The New York Times by its chief theater critic, Frank Rich, despite pleas by 
the organization presenting what it calls a workshop production. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, New Musicals, says it had sought a no-review policy from the 
media for its season of shows that began May 1 with "Spider Woman." The musical 
is being performed through June 24 at the State University of New York at 
Purchase, 25 miles north of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to create an alternative method of development to Broadway," Martin 
J. Bell, producing director of New Musicals, said Thursday. "If the Times 
policy stands, I would recommend to a writer or a director that they do a show 
right on Broadway instead of coming here. What they did was invade the work 
process here." 
</P>
<P>
A review by Rich usually can make or break a show on Broadway. New Musicals had 
hoped to keep The New York Times from reviewing the show, which is undergoing 
changes and rewrites during its two-month run in Purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Rich's review, largely negative, finds irony in what he describes as the overly 
elaborate, Broadway-style staging. 
</P>
<P>
Other New York critics were informed of the Times' decision to review the show, 
and several decided to do their own pieces before Rich's notice came out. 
</P>
<P>
Clive Barnes, theater critic of the New York Post, said the Times' review 
policy made it impossible for him to ignore the musical. He panned the show in 
Thursday's newspaper, but was even more scathing about The New York Times' 
policy for the show. 
</P>
<P>
A Daily News critic will review the show today and other critics, including 
those of Variety and The Associated Press, plan to review it soon. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in "Kiss of the Spider Woman" has been high since the project was 
announced in January. The musical involves some of Broadway's biggest talents. 
</P>
<P>
The show is directed by Harold Prince, director of "The Phantom of the Opera," 
and has a book by playwright Terrence McNally. The score was written by John 
Kander and Fred Ebb, the team behind "Cabaret" and "Zorba."
