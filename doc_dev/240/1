The first half of the rugby season has given us a taste of how the game will
work once it becomes a non-stop year-round international sport. Over the
past 10 weeks, the Springboks have been in Wales, Scotland and Ireland and
Romania and Canada at Twickenham. The international games followed each
other rapidly.
After next year's Rugby World Cup in South Africa only three countries will
definitely pre-qualify for the 1999 finals - the two finalists and the
winner of the third place play off (a fourth may also pre-qualify if the
host is not one of the first three nations).
England may well pre-qualify as hosts but there is a good chance that
Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France will have to pre-qualify. The increase
in matches will stretch the international rugby calendar throughout a full
season.
One immediate result of this autumn's proliferation of internationals was to
marginalise non-international matches, namely the Varsity Match.
The internationals provided some pointers to world cup form. The Springboks
are nearly a great side. Against Scotland they were magisterial. They were
more fortunate the following week against a fighting Welsh side who have
found their pride and commitment again.
The Welsh had only one game plan and it did not involve using their
three-quarters. Instead Neil Jenkins, at fly half, kept the ball in front of
his forwards in the hope that the Springboks would give away penalties. It
nearly worked.
At least, in Derwyn Jones, the 6ft 10in lock, Wales now know they can win
line-out ball at will. It will be interesting to see if Alan Davies, the
Welsh coach, changes his one dimensional tactics for the forthcoming Five
Nations Championship.
For the South Africans, the Barbarian fixture in Dublin, was one game too
many. They graciously made five changes to their test team to give all their
squad the chance to play and thus revealed that they do not yet have a squad
that will win the world cup.
Few would disagree that in three of the five critical positions - at
full-back hooker and No 8 - they have, the best players in the world: Andre
Joubert, Ulrich Schmidt and Rudulf Straeuli. But at both half back positions
the jury is out. True, Joost van der Westhuizen, the scrum half, ducked and
dived to great effect against Scotland but his passing from the base of the
scrum was woeful and this meant that his fly half, Hendrik Le Roux, was
rarely ever able to impose his personality on his side's tactics.
Almost by error, the South Africans found a game plan based on their
emerging back row of Francois Pienaar (an inspirational captain and a public
relations dream), Ruben Kruger (the best player on tour) and Straeuli. By
their athleticism and presence this trio took games, shook them hard and
seized the initiative time and time again.
The Springboks looked tired alter the Welsh game. The time has come to move
the Barbarians game and follow the example of cricket. Cricket tours start
with a soft opener against the Duchess of Norfolk's XI at Arundel. Visiting
rugby teams should start with the Barbarian fixture and the gate should go
to charity.
England easily, if somewhat clumsily, defeated a poor Romania XV and then
last week turned the screw against a battling Canadian side. The team is
beginning to settle - Simon Shaw, the uncapped Bristol lock, needs a few
games in the Five Nations' championships to bed him down ready for the World
Cup; Ian Hunter needs to be rehabilitated on the right wing and Mike Catt
will one day prove a brilliant deputy for Rob Andrew.
In the 1991 Rugby World Cup side, England finally decided that what mattered
most on the right wing was that the player would give no tries away and be
safe under the high ball. They chose a centre, Simon Halliday to play on the
wing. The same thought must be occupying Jack Rowell, the current England
coach.
He knows that Tony Underwood, who played on the right against Canada, is not
up to international rugby but he is unsure - rare for him - of the solution.
I suspect Philip de Glanville and Mike Catt will be tried out at some time
over the next few months.
England have developed an ability to raise their game for big matches. Their
15-a-side approach is how the game is played in New Zealand and Australia
and one effect is that the scorelines are much higher. Running rugby
involves a greater risk but is much more fun to play and to watch.
The Varsity Match was a classic. Cambridge emerged from the tunnel on to the
Twickenham turf slowly and deliberately reminiscent of the Scots under David
Sole four years ago at Murrayfield when the foe was England and a Grand Slam
was at stake. Cambridge played a wonderful game and deserved their win.
Naturally, it hurt, being an Oxford Blue, to see Oxford lose. At one time in
the second half they looked as though they were going to concede 40 points
but rallied and nearly won the match.
Cambridge used a tactic I had not seen before. At the maul, their forwards
did not pile in blindly hoping that somehow sheer strength would see them
through. They kept popping the ball up to the next player coming in. As a
consequence they ripped the Oxford defence to shreds. It was compelling to
watch.
Cambridge showed the northern hemisphere countries, who are fed up with
arguing the rights and wrongs of the turn-over law, a way to use it more
constructively.
The up-coming Five Nations Championship should have been moved to April so
the participants could have used it as the final stage of their build up. As
it is, the championships serve only to interrupt their preparations.
Scotland, unless they can drop Gavin Hastings, do not have a hope and will
win the wooden spoon. Ireland and Wales still have to demonstrate that they
understand the word variety. England and France again look as though they
will fight it out. England have so often been the favourites these past six
years, but have won only twice. The probability is that France will emerge
as the Five Nations Cup holders for 1995.
