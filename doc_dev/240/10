Two weeks ago, I took one of the Sydney's new double decker trains to North
Sydney to watch the rugby union semi-final between Warringah and Gordon.
The ground has a Field of Dreams quality to it; it is a quaint and mellow
oval which could easily double as a home for a Palm Court orchestra and it
is owned not by Warringah or Gordon or by the Sydney or New South Wales RFUs
but by the local council. As such it plays home at weekends to the North
Sydney professional rugby league team and a host of rugby union sides,
something we, in England, find unacceptable, although why we do, is hard to
fathom.
Although Gordon caused an upset last year by winning the Grand Final -
Randwick, the best side, had done a Bath, losing their concentration, and
the match, in an early round - this year they have been a shadow of
themselves. Warringah, with a strongish pack and fielding the best player,
Mark Catchpole (son of the legendary Ken Catchpole), at scrum-half, were
favourites.
The game was played under floodlights to attract a larger crowd; the first
rugby league semi-final, which drew 40,000 to the Sydney Football Ground
that afternoon would have offered over-powering competition.
As I watched Gordon and Warringah my mind wandered, the game had little
attraction for the neutral spectator and I kept thinking that I had seen
parts of the ground before. It was not until later that it dawned on me that
the stands had come from the Sydney Cricket Ground when the 'hill' was
dug-up.
In the end, in front of 8,000, Warringah emerged the winners by 29-18 though
Gordon were much the better side. Warringah went on to lose to Randwick a
week later.
It was an unfair comparison but a week earlier I had been in the Bosch
hospitality suite at Ellis Park in Johannesburg to watch Transvaal narrowly
beat Western Province in the Lion Cup, South Africa's equivalent of the
Pikington Cup, in front of 42,000 spectators. That day, there were 20
prospective international players on show. At North Sydney there were none.
Sydney is essentially a village, you go to a bar or restaurant and bump into
the strangest of people. I ran into Sir Nicholas Shehadie who was Lord Mayor
of the city when I first visited in 1975 with the England rugby team. He
invited me to a game that weekend, the major rugby league semi-final between
Canberra and Canterbury at the SFG, where a month earlier the Wallabies had
beaten New Zealand in the Bledisloe Cup with that tackle by George Gregan.
There was a buzz in the air. The media was excited and at the many
breakfasts, brunches and cocktail parties that morning, the talk was of the
game.
The ground, by Australia's best known architect, Philip Cox, ranks alongside
those at Murrayfield and Old Trafford. Sir Nick chairs the trust that also
looks after its neighbour, Sydney Cricket Ground.
We were joined at his table for lunch by, among others, a cabinet minister
and David Campese, the Wallaby back, fresh, or rather, unfresh from his
French Barbarian appearance in Paris against the Barbarians.
Big-spending rugby league club, Canberra Raiders, have had the most
brilliant season. Their full back, Brett Mullins is the best player in the
world and their line up also includes Mal Meninga, although he is well past
his sell by date.
Canterbury on the other hand are the local side made good, deeply embedded
in the culture of their south Sydney suburb. It is not unusual for them to
hold Greek or Italian family days. They have established a strong link with
the underclass in Sydney and they have carefully exploited their underdog
position.
The game was played in perfect conditions in front of a capacity crowd of
42,000. With just under two minutes to go to full-time, Canterbury led by
17-12. At the last, they succumbed to a try by the post and with the scores
level, the game went to over-time.
It was heart-in-the-mouth stuff and a replay seemed on the cards until
Canberra's Darryl Harrigan, a former New Zealand rugby union player,
squeezed in a drop goal late-on to take the game by one point.
All the talk - in South Africa, in Australia and in New Zealand - is about
how rugby union will go open. No-one, that is no one administrator or
player, has a blue-print that works beyond their own country.
In South Africa, the revenue from the provincial games runs into millions of
pounds. As a result, players are training five days a week and being
appropriately enriched for their full-time commitments. Nowhere else in the
world, except perhaps France, is this possible.
In Australia, Nick Farr-Jones, the captain of the 1991 Rugby World Cup
winners, suggested that the best solution for union, very much the poor
relation to League, was to: 'replicate the cricket scenario. We have grade
cricket, Sheffield Shield matches and internationals. The grade cricketer
gets nothing, the state cricketer receives appearance money and the
internationals are paid well.
'Rugby must do the same - club rugby doesn't have the support to pay
players; state and national rugby does. We must find a way to compensate the
players fairly for their efforts but l would advise against the players
giving up their day-job.'
Farr-Jones does not believe it would be wise for players just to play rugby
and not have some regular employment.
David Kirk, the All Black captain of the 1987 world cup winners, said in
Wellington, where he works as the adviser to the Prime-Minister, Jim Bolger:
'The change in emphasis in the game where players are seeking payment has
brought a greedier, less intelligent player into union.
'Too many of our current squad are unemployed or euphemistically employed by
unions or self-employed working somewhere in the so called sports business.'
Last Saturday, I watched quite the best game of rugby l have seen since the
All Backs demolished London at Twickenham a year ago, when I attended the
Auckland versus Otago match in New Zealand. The score, 46-30 to Auckland,
belies the quality of the skills on show. This was, I was told, how
Auckland, last season' champions, have been playing for three seasons and is
the legacy of a previous coach, John Hart.
I was fortunate to arrive in time fo the NZRFU Council's vote to decide on
who would coach the All Blacks for next year's world cup.
Laurie Mains, the incumbent, having lost an unprecedented four out of six
Tests this season was returned by 11 votes to eight. Poor John Hart was
defeated for a third time and will not stand again.
The debate about the 'coach' has dominated the news for three weeks and the
decision to re-appoint Mains became the lead story for the 1pm, 6pm and late
evening news programmes on all three TV networks.
That night, I saw a piece of graffiti: 'To win the world cup in '95, NZ
needs a coach not a Lawrie.' But do not write off New Zealand yet.
