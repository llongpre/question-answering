Something is wrong. Something is going right with English sport.
First, Terry Venables' appointment is applauded, second, Ray Illingworth
comes in from the cold to take the reins of the England cricket team and,
late yesterday, the Rugby Football Union continued this uncanny run of
common sense by appointing Jack Rowell, the Bath coach, to be the new guru
for the national side.
The announcement was expected on Monday - but its timing gives him the
chance of being fully involved with this afternoon's game.
Rowell's appointment will be widely welcomed, except perhaps by a few
die-hards within the RFU executive committee. Rowell's precise role will
need to be carefully defined over the coming months. He may want to merge
the role of manager and coach.
Dick Best is the present England coach, but the jury is out on his
contribution to the England set-up over the past three years. He is an
enlightened coach but his work for England has gone largely unnoticed. Geoff
Cooke has retained all the power in selection.
In particular, Best lost the case for Stuart Barnes, the Bath captain, as
the pivot on which to base his England team. Without Barnes, a running
outside-half, Best lost the architect of his tactics.
Instead, we have had a diet of unrelieved boredom from the England camp, the
win against the All Blacks notwithstanding.
The England team, instead of building another dimension to their game, as
the Australians did between their Grand Slam in 1984 and their winning of
the World Cup in 1991, has gone from rags to riches to rags in an identical
period of time. And, in between, France and now Wales have made great
strides to catch up.
Cooke's control of the England team was suffocating the side. He needed to
relieve Carling of the captaincy and allow Dean Richards, one of his
bete-noires, the chance to lead the side until after next year's Rugby World
Cup.
Rowell's appointment may lead to a shake-up in the England team. He will
probably replace Andrew with Barnes and ask Will Carling to stand down as
captain. He is also likely to call on all his powers to ensure a fit Jeremy
Guscott at centre. If one player has been missed this season, it has been
Guscott.
We might just have reached the same conclusion over gifted Welsh centre
Scott Gibbs who has also been absent for the tournament. Without him though,
Welsh back play has matured and developed beyond expectations.
This is not just because of Neil Jenkins' coming of age, but because of his
right-hand man in the centre, Nigel Davies. For me, Davies has been the
player of the championship. Unsung and largely unheard of, he missed the
Canadian debacle in November and, through injury, the French game four weeks
ago.
But Davies has an acute tactical brain, safe hands and is a sound kicker.
Above all, he has one exceptional gift, he makes time for himself. The
Llanelli player will have his toughest game today against Carling. It will
be one to savour.
Romantics will want a Welsh victory. After all, there were supposed to be
only two teams in this championship, England and France. My how we all got
that wrong.
Commentators are already concluding that Wales' chance of achieving the
Grand Slam has come too early for the team. This is nonsense. Nothing comes
too early in sport.
Nevertheless, this is a wounded England side and there is nothing more
dangerous. They played so abjectly against Ireland that they still have
something to prove to their loyal supporters.
The side has developed a symbiotic relationship with them and they will want
to provide a game to talk about and a game with which to thank Geoff Cooke
for his sterling work over the past seven years.
The game again hinges on the play of the respective back-rows. Dean Richards
has that uncanny knack of always being in the right place at the right time.
His presence enables Ben Clarke to play a slightly wider game, one that best
fits the likes of Victor Ubogu and Tim Rodber. It is their pace over the
ground - which the Welsh lack - where the game will be won.
I do not see England being unduly bothered about tries in spite of the media
interest. They will want a win and will steel themselves to ensure it is by
the requisite 16 points so that they can claim the championship. I believe
they will do it. Twickenham is again host to another mighty occasion.
