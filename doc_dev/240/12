England expects. England supporters expect a win this afternoon at
Murrayfield. They will not be too bothered by the score so long as it is a
win. A loss would be too frightening to contemplate. It would mean a triple
whammy of lost causes - the Calcutta Cup, the Triple Crown and the Grand
Slam.
England's famous victory against the All Blacks belonged to their
preparation for the 1995 World Cup, the venue for which is still in doubt.
For now it will have to be stored in the players' mental freeze frames.
Today, England begin their participation in the Five Nations Championship,
which is a tournament that has little or no bearing on the World Cup. Its
onlyplus is that it gives Geoff Cooke, Dick Best and Mike Slemen, the
England management and coaching team, a chance to build a squad of 25
international players, ready to anticipate the bigger prize. The reality is
that Scotland, Ireland and Wales have only the Five Nations Championship in
their sights.
Scotland still cannot believe that they have declined so quickly. A year ago
at Twickenham they looked to have the measure of England until Craig
Chalmers was injured and, after that Stuart Barnes produced that famous
'shimmy' in his own 22 and, aided by Jeremy Guscott, Rory Underwood scored
an audacious try.
Even in New Zealand, when the Scottish members of the Lions pack were shown
to be technically deficient, folk in the Border towns thought it an
aberration and, that once home, the players would prove their worth. Alas,
the horror story continued.
Ian McGeechan, coach to the 1993 Lions side, was able to conjure a Grand
Slam for them in 1990 yet this may well have been their nemesis.
Their own competitive structure is too insular and its talent is spread too
wide. Scotland desperately needs a Five Nations club championship. They have
again juggled their players after the defeat by Wales three weeks ago.
Chalmers may have left the stage for good, which would be a great loss to
Scottish rugby. He was always one for taking risks. Gregor Townsend, his
successor, has as much to carry on hisshoulders as Gary Armstrong, the
absent soldier, now returned. Armstrong will at least let Kyran Bracken, his
England counterpart, know he has been in a game.
When the England team was announced last weekend, there was jubilation
thatNeil Back of Leicester has at last, for whatever reasons, forced himself
into the side for his first cap. Back has the ability, rather like French
flanker Jean-Pierre Rives in the late 1970s and early 1980s, to take a game
by the scruff ofits neck.
His inclusion means England can play a wider game. Indeed, the tactical
options they have with him on board, are embarrassing. His speed tothe loose
ball, followed closely by Ben Clarke, playing in his favoured No 8 position,
means that the English backs will have a chance to run much more ball.
This will test the nerve of the Underwood brothers. Rory has not looked his
old self and needs one of his magical tries to convince supporters that he
has not lost his appetite for the game. His brother, Tony, needs to prove he
is a better footballer than either Mike Catt, of Bath, on the bench for the
first time, or Northampton's Ian Hunter.
Even without Back, the three quarters should be working with more ball
because of the brilliance of scrum-half Bracken's open play. He passes
first. Morris, his England predecessor, always checked the closerange
opportunities for a split second longer than was necessary and then passed.
Moreover, Bracken's pass is longer and gives Rob Andrew at stand-off more
space.
There was also a cheer in our household for the return of Jon Hall, theBath
captain. When international players fail to make the final trial - or these
days the new year training squad in Lanzarote - their playing ceiling is
lowered and they have to come to terms with playing only club rugby, going
on the after-dinner speech circuit and captaining Charity XVs on Sundays or
Gash XVs that open new clubhouses.
Such was my lot in 1980 when, after seven years of final trials and the odd
cap and tour overseas, I was asked to captain a rag bag of a Bath side
against Devizes RFC to celebrate their golden anniversary. It wasthe end of
April, the ground was concrete hard, and the kick-off was at 5pm on a
weekday afternoon - not a time to endear you to your employer when you have
already played 50 games in the season and used up every excuse in the book
as to why this game, above all the others, is vital.
We were losing, much to the enjoyment of the large crowd.
They ran yet another ball at us and, as I was watching this from my
unfamiliar position of fly-half, I thought that if they were to score we
would be sunk. From nowhere appeared a burly youth. He cut the winger down,
got up from the floor and immediately tackled the full-back into touch.
Wing fo rwards rarely consider such action in a friendly. This was no
ordinary wing forward. This was Jon Hall and I have followed his progress
over the past 14 years with keen interest.
He has had appalling luck with injuries and lesser mortals would have been
content merely to play. Not Hall. For him international rugby is a drug and
before he retires he wants one last chance to appear in a World Cup final.
He is one of the few players whose upper body strength is such that he could
have easily converted to rugby league.
At Lansdowne Road, in Dublin, Wales take on Ireland, where they have a good
record over the past eight years, with three wins from four games.
Ireland are always difficult at home and the crowd has become an integral
part of their game. They will need all their support.
Against France in Paris they were woeful and were lucky that it was the
opening game of the tournament. Wales look to have steadied their shipand
made some sensible selections. They should win but much will depend on the
weather.
