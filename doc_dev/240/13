Today fortress Twickenham (two huge raking new stands built; two to go),
again posts 'house full' notices. In the process, the gate for the
Pilkington Cup Final between Bath and Leicester will beat the 66,000 for the
Varsity match last December and set a new world attendance record for a club
game.
Bath and Leicester are by some way the leading two clubs in the four home
unions. They badly need a European club competition if they are not to grow
stale.
Leicester were the team of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Before leagues
became established, the cup competition was the criteria by which success
was judged. Losing finalists in 1978, Leicester then won three cups in a row
and were losing finalists again in 1988 and 1989 (against Bath). It was only
last year that they began to re-emerge, winning the cup against Harlequins.
In the 1970s Leicester played a style of rugby which was exciting, open,
adventurous, intelligent and pacey. Generally they did this with a small but
perfectly competent pack and a fast-ish back-row. Critically, in the five
single positions on the field, hooker, number 8, scrum half, outside half
and full back they had five international players: Peter Wheeler, Gary Adey,
Nick Youngs, Les Cusworth and Dusty Hare.
A decade on there is only one international in these single positions, the
evergreen number 8, Dean Richards, the players' choice for player of the
year.
Bath, by comparison, were a joke side. I should know. I played for them for
four years. Under 'Grocer' Jack Rowell this has changed. Bath emulated
Leicester. They have done that very difficult thing. They have, like the
Australian national side, managed change successfully.
With Rowell being elevated to the England coach is this the end of the line
for them? Brian Ashton, Rowell's successor, has been his assistant coach. As
a player, Ashton was desperately unlucky not to be capped by England. He
was, with Jacko Page, one of the two best scrum halves in the country.
In the 1970s, Page played when England beat Scotland 7-6 - but he was not
selected for the Australian tour of 1975. Ashton went as the senior player
with Peter Kingston from Gloucester (also uncapped) as his deputy.
The week of the first international Ashton had a family bereavement and flew
home. Kingston won two caps and we never heard from Ashton again.
Under Rowell, Bath's success has been quite astonishing, beyond anything the
city has experienced before.
Leicester always had a more serious pedigree. Their annual game on Boxing
Day against the Barbarians, which dates back to 1909, has always been a
sell-out. Nevertheless, their comparative lack of success in the middle and
late 1980s forced them to advertise for a chief coach. They made the
sensible decision to bring in a fresh face, Tony Russ, from the Saracens
club and have worked hard to make the jump back to first class.
A win this afternoon would be a deserved return for their work.
It will not be easy. Bath are a formidable team, able to soak up enormous
pressure and score the winner when the game is two minutes into overtime.
Just ask Harlequins who lost in the semi-finals this year and in an epic
final two years ago.
It is now Bath who have the five internationals in the five crucial
positions: Graham Dawe (playing better than ever), Ben Clarke (ditto),
Richard Hill, Stuart Barnes and Jon Callard.
But, their best player of the season is undoubtedly Mike Catt who was capped
right at the end of the game against Wales. Catt reminds me of Jean-Claude
Gachassin, the free-thinking French three quarter of the 1960s who could
play anywhere and frequently did. He was rugby's equivalent of Johann
Cruyff, the Dutch soccer star.
In eight days, the builders will start hacking at Twickenham's West Stand.
Its replacement should be complete within 15 months. The RFU borrowed Pounds
24m before they knew that their share of the next television contract for
the Five Nations Championship would net them close to Pounds 12m.
Rugby's negotiators managed to keep two secrets. The first was that Sky, the
satellite channel, was never interested; the second was that the bidding
between ITV and BBC was very close. In sealed bids ITV offered Pounds 27m;
BBC topped it by Pounds 250,000.
Next Friday, at the Dorchester, rugby pays homage to the the Penguins and to
Tony Mason and Alan Wright, two stalwarts of Sidcup who founded the touring
side 35 years ago. Since then the Penguins have visited 32 countries
including the Soviet Union in 1977, Brazil in 1984 and Malaysia in 1994.
For players past and present, rugby is still the best amateur team game in
the world. The Penguin club epitomises this perfectly.
