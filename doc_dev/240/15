FT  20 FEB 93 / Rugby Union: Awkward Norster puts his expertise on the line

THE LION-HEARTED defence by Wales in their Five Nations rugby union victory
over England two weeks ago has overshadowed one important aspect of the
game. The Welsh line-out work was superb. A supposed weakness was turned
into a strength.
This was a surprise, to put it mildly. Not long ago, Wales won only two
line-outs in an entire game against Australia, prompting one journalist to
write: ' . . . in the first half Wales won a line-out and in the
second-half, just to prove it was no fluke, they won another.'
The improvement is due mainly to Robert Norster, the Welsh team manager who
was one of the most effective line-out forwards in Europe during the 1980s.
He was awkward and thoughtful, determined and courageous, and these
characteristics helped him overcome a lack of inches. He is 6ft 5in and Wade
Dooley, England's big lock, is 6ft 8in - yet, in their meetings, it was
always Norster who came off better. Now he is passing on to his team what he
learned then.
The key to Norster's success as a player, and Wales' line-out performance
against England, is attention to detail. 'The line-out is a team
performance,' he says. 'It is not just about who jumps highest. You need a
bit of skill, accuracy and team-work. You have to work as a team, and we
did. I am happy to say that we won more than 80 per cent of our own ball
against England.'
There is much preparation before Wales play an international these days. The
technical department of the Welsh Rugby Union records each of their team's
games and those of future opponents. (A camera will be at Lansdowne Road in
Dublin this afternoon filming Ireland against France, to help Wales prepare
for their remaining matches in the Five Nations championship). Then,
sections of each match are compiled and sent to the players concerned.
Before the England game, the Welsh line-out forwards were sent clips of
England's line-out performances against Canada, South Africa and France
earlier this season. Then, at practice, Norster urged them constantly to try
new techniques and refine old ones.
He stressed variety and surprise. He made them rehearse their line-out
calls, routines and support systems. The result was that Gareth Llewellyn,
the big Neath lock, had his best game yet in the line-out for Wales and
fellow-lock Tony Copsey turned in a good performance, too.
It was typical Norster, who says self-mockingly: 'Even my friends would say
I am a bit over-regimented.' Derek Quinnell, the former British Lion who now
manages the Wales A team, adds: 'As a second-row forward, Bob was forever
organising people around him so that he could give of his best. He would
analyse his opponents and work out how best to counter them.
'He would sometimes make his opponents move forward to compete with him for
a ball, and sometimes make them go back. His style was to stand out of the
line-out and leap into it. He was very agile for a big man, spring-heeled, a
genuine leaper.'
Norster grew up in a hard school. Born in Ebbw Vale in 1957, his first rugby
experiences were with Abertillery; and he joined the famous Cardiff club in
1978, the year after he became a member of the Welsh national squad. Norster
did for his country in the '80s what another Lion, Delme Thomas, had done in
the '60s and '70s. Both won priceless line-out ball, often against bigger
and stronger men. In theory, neither was quite tall enough; but they made up
in technique what they lacked in physique. Both recorded outstanding Sargent
jumps, the method used to measure a standing jump.
As he developed, Norster acquired an uncompromising hardness. He needed it
in New Zealand when he played in two Tests for the Lions in 1983, and again
in one Test against Australia's Wallabies in 1989, as well as in 34
internationals for Wales between 1982 and 1989. He needed it, too, when
Wales beat England in the 1987 World Cup and, against the odds, at
Twickenham in 1988 - after which England coach Roger Uttley said ruefully:
'A player like Norster will always give you trouble.'
Most of all, Norster needed his hard-nosed attitude against Ireland in
Dublin in 1988 when chasing the Triple Crown (victories against all three
home countries in the Five Nations championship). Wales were up against it
and so was Norster, who had trapped a shoulder nerve after catching a
line-out ball and was in constant pain. Yet, he turned in a performance of
such courage that Stephen Jones was moved to write in the Sunday Times that,
in the second half, 'Norster grabbed hold of Wales and simply flung them at
the Triple Crown.' Wales won 12-9, sneaking home in the dying minutes, and
went on to win the Crown.
Even in rugby union's new professional atmosphere, it might surprise many to
learn that the Welsh players are backed up by their coaching staff, a
selection committee and selection adviser, two doctors, two
physiotherapists, a fitness adviser, a sports scientist, a match analyst and
a dietician. But it all tallies with Norster's philosophy. 'Attention to
detail has always been, and always will remain, an essential ingredient in
our preparation,' he wrote in the programme notes for the Wales v England
game.
At Murrayfield in Edinburgh this afternoon, we will see what ploys Norster
has thought up when Wales face the strong line-out threat posed by the
Scots. But you can be sure of one thing: like Baden Powell and the Scouts,
Norster will be prepared.
