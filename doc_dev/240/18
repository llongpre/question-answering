England began last year's Five Nations Championship with a one point win
against France 16-15 and then lost by a point to Wales 9-10. If justice has
anything to do with rugby, England would have lost to France and beaten
Wales. The loss to Wales showed that Will Carling could not think on his
feet.
Two weeks ago against Scotland it was the same story. This time it was not
just Carling who failed to read the game but his lieutenant Brian Moore, who
led the pack. Time and again, Neil Back was exposed at the end of the
line-out; time and again the Scots cut off the route from Kyren Bracken, the
scrum half, to Rob Andrew, the fly half, and lured Bracken into unsupported
runs before ambushing him.
In recent years the public has revised its expectations from England always
winning, to England always winning with something in reserve. This afternoon
a one-point win for England over Ireland at Twickenham will count as a
national disaster. The team must not only beat the Irish, but must beat them
comprehensively; for the England management has decided that this is the
side that will beat France, the strongest team in the competition, in Paris
in a fortnight.
England's back play is constipated. I am tired of reading that the new laws
make it more difficult for the three quarters. At the Parc des Prince in
October, in the Second Test between France and Australia, Michael Lynagh
destroyed the French side by running and attacking them whenever he had the
ball in his hands. He hardly kicked at all.
Only Stuart Barnes and Mike Catt, both of Bath, can follow Lynagh's example
for England. Rob Andrew has a fine pedigree but his game has always lacked
vision.
Ireland will follow Scotland's lead and bombard Jon Callard with Garryowens.
Neither of the Underwoods is secure under high balls and Callard, who
remained largely untested against New Zealand, struggled when Scotland used
this ploy. I would have preferred Ian Hunter to play on the right wing to
act as a sweeper for Callard or even to switch with him in certain
circumstances. Gone are the days when wingers just stayed on their wings.
Tony Underwood missed a try against the All Blacks by carrying the ball
under the wrong arm so he could not hand-off his tackler. He did it again in
the Scotland game and again missed a try. He is fortunate the selectors have
such patience. In player parlance, he owes England one: in my book, he owes
England two.
For Ireland, Eric Elwood has been magnificent. Magnificent at kicking that
is. But the Irish strategy is hard to read. Elwood will soon be compared to
an illustrious predecessor, Tony Ward, who was frequently criticised for
playing just a kicking game. Will Elwood be allowed to play a wider game and
is he capable of it? Poor Simon Geoghegan - the Irish winger must be
starting to feel a forgotten man.
Against France, Ireland had one tactic: to kick the ball over the French
defensive lines. It failed but they went on playing that way and appeared
happy for Elwood to kick goals. Even though these tactics lost against
France and Wales, I doubt that they will be any different at Twickenham.
The French take an unchanged side to Cardiff where they have not lost to
Wales since 1982. The French front five is one of the heaviest in rugby
history, but the back row of Abdelatif Benazzi, Philippe Benetton and Marc
Cecillon could be severely tested. All three are specialist No 8s picked for
the lineout in spite of their lack of mobility in the loose.
The Welsh had done the psychologically difficult bit - they won their
opening game against Scotland and followed it up with a composed win against
Ireland. But their chance for their first Grand Slam since 1978, has been
undermined by injuries to their backs.
The shortage of tries and the increased importance of penalties, such as the
controversial kick for handling in a ruck that gave England victory over
Scotland, have exercised the rugby world this past fortnight. Since rugby is
supposed to be a handling game, I do not understand why it is an offence to
handle in the rucks, provided the player is not preventing the ball being
played.
The laws governing penalties are a muddle. The 'double' penalty that allows
sides to kick to touch and still gain the throw in has made line-outs even
more important. From the line-out the fly half then kicks the ball up in the
air in the hope of winning the scrum from the ensuing 'turnover' maul or
ruck. This is American football not rugby football.
The penalty laws have so changed the nature and balance of the game that the
international laws committee should reverse them at the end of these
championships. They could also add a rider that an offence committed in the
'penalty' area of the defensive side's 22 should result in a penalty in
front of the posts.
