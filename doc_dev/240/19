NED HAIG and David Sanderson are the two Scotsmen credited with inventing
seven-a-side rugby late in the last century - the first tournament was held
at Melrose in 1883. I wonder what their reaction would be to the World Cup
Sevens tournament which began at Murrayfield, Edinburgh, yesterday morning
and finishes tomorrow afternoon?
Perhaps it is better not to ask. On the other hand, the Scots themselves
have given it an emphatic vote of approval. Tickets worth more than Pounds
1m have been sold and many more would have been sold if the rebuilding of
the west stand been finished. As it is, ground capacity is limited to
37,500.
The Sevens are brought to you by the same people who ran the full-scale
World Cup in Britain in 1991 - Rugby World Cup Ltd. ITV is transmitting
several hours each day. The sponsors are similar: Famous Grouse, Mizuno,
Bass Breweries and South African Airways. In subsidiary roles are Unisys;
Gilbert, the ball manufacturer; Umbro, the equipment maker; Medisport, the
supplier of medical equipment, and Citroen.
The World Cup Sevens is an ambitious title for an event that might in time
become as all-embracing as its name suggests but is little more at present
than an upstart cousin to the real sevens tournament the Hong Kong Sevens,
which was staged recently. The World Cup Sevens to that event is as
margarine is to butter.
There will be similarities, one of the most likely is that southern
hemisphere countries will dominate at Murrayfield as they did in Hong Kong
where the semi-finalists were Fiji, Australia, Western Samoa and New
Zealand.
Fiji, in particular, concentrate on sevens these days, perhaps to the
detriment of their performance at the 15-a-side game. They have competed in
25 events already this year and, in Waisale Serevi, they have the
outstanding sevens player in the world. Watch for him. He has a most
distinctive style: one minute he is lurking at the back of his team, some
way from the ball; the next, he will be running in for a try.
The Australians are making a big effort to win at Murrayfield, the undoubted
incentive being the chance of adding the sevens to their World Cup title.
Their team is built around David Campese (who is even more devastating at
sevens than at 15-a side), Michael Lynagh and the huge, strong and fast
forward Willie Ofahengaue.
Sevens is a lot more than half as enjoyable and half as good as the fuller
version. At its best, it can be sublime: seven men weaving intricate
patterns on a full-size pitch until one or two of them, by deft handling and
quick interplay, work a man clear. Then, watch him go  - sometimes, from 60
or 70 yards.
I grew up watching Ian Laughland mastermind London Scottish to victory in
the Middlesex Sevens in the 1960s, and then Gerald Davies dazzle his
opponents with speed and footwork when he helped London Welsh dominate this
event 10 years later. Those days are gone, along with pounds, shillings and
pence and the three point and four-point try. No longer are speed and guile
the two most important characteristics in sevens. A substantial physical
presence is just as important.
The Fijians and Samoans have brought a physical edge to sevens that has
turned it from a sort of high-speed touch rugby to a high-speed,
highly-physical game. The final in the recent Hong Kong tournament was
described by Dick Best, the England coach, as one of the most brutal games
he had ever seen.
Each player needs to be fast, most should be robust, and one or two in each
team must be play-makers. These are the characteristics needed to cope with
someone like Fiji's Mesaka Rasari who is 6ft 5in, more than 17 stone - and a
sprinter.
While the World Cup Sevens provides a feast of rugby, it is an
organisational nightmare: 24 teams - including many hardly known for their
rugby such as Latvia, the Netherlands, Korea and Spain - compete in four
pools of six. Minutes are vital. The semi-finals tomorrow start at 15.32 and
15.49 and the final iself at 17.16. Blink and you miss a match.
Weather permitting, the tournament will demonstrate the attraction of sevens
rugby. But there are doubts it will catch on in Europe as it has in the
southern hemisphere. Weather, fixtures, and the strength of the 15-a-side
game are all against the growth of the shortened game. So, you had better
make the most of it while you can.
