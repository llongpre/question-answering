SO YOU thought rugby union was an amateur game? You thought it was the game
that was played for love and that those who wanted to play for money went
north, to play rugby league.
It was - once. But it is not any longer. The world has been stood on its
head. Rugby has gone from being a game of no money to a game of big money.
There is more money in the best rugby union clubs in England and Wales than
in the worst professional rugby league clubs.
For example, Gloucester handed over their commercial affairs to businessman
Mike Burton, a former England player, and in one season earned themselves
Pounds 140,000. Harlequins, the acme of rugby union clubs, signed a Pounds
350,000 four-year sponsorship deal with Flowers Bitter. A Heineken league
game between Swansea and Llanelli last month was almost certainly the first
club match in Britain to generate a turnover of Pounds 100,000.
For Llanelli, traditionally one of the richest clubs in British rugby, this
was the gilt on the gingerbread. This bonanza game came a week after the
club banked Pounds 18,000 for retaining the Welsh Cup last season. It came
within a month of the club receiving Pounds 10,000 for taking part in the
Heineken League and extending its sponsorship deal with Crown Buckley, the
brewers, for another three years for Pounds 150,000.
Such success among the leading clubs in the game is highlighted by the odd
exception. Bath, winners of the Courage League and Pilkington Cup last
season, nevertheless managed to lose Pounds 5,000. At Moseley's annual
meeting members were told the club was Pounds 120,000 in debt. Such
exceptions highlight the general situation, however.
With so much money sloshing around, it is no surprise that some of it is
making its way back to the players in one form or another. Here are some of
the things that have been said about money in rugby union these past 18
months:
A little over one year ago the coach of a leading London rugby club told the
following story. One of his most promising young forwards had come to him in
a state of some agitation having been offered Pounds 20,000 to move to a
particular club. What should he do?
The coach did not want to lose this player, whom he had coached since the
youngster had joined the club as a junior but the club had no money to pay
players. 'Go if you really want to' said the coach. 'Go with my blessing.'
Each member of England's World Cup squad expects to receive between Pounds
5,000 and Pounds 10,000 from their Run with the Ball campaign, launched
during the build-up to the World Cup and officially approved by the
International Board.
Danie Serfontein, the president of the Rugby Football Union, alleged that
some players had been offered Pounds 5,000 to switch clubs.
David Campese, the Australian winger, said he was rugby's first millionaire.
The Australian, allegedly earning Dollars 250,000 annually for appearing for
Milan, later said he was half joking. It is thought he was not joking at
all.
A leading player was being wooed by rugby league. Three businessmen got
together and by guaranteeing him Pounds 50,000 annually ensured he remained
in rugby union.
In South Africa, captaincy of one province is said to carry a salary of the
equivalent of Pounds 25,000.
'I know of a handful of players in the Scottish game who are paid for
playing,' wrote David Sole, the former Scottish captain, in his
autobiography . . . even small clubs in Wales are said to be paying players
Pounds 40 and Pounds 50 for each game. Sole alleges that one Welsh
international switched clubs because his pay was increased from Pounds 200
to Pounds 300.
It has become accepted practice for leading players to move from one club to
another. One forward approached two clubs, offered his services and asked
for a car in return. He was turned down by both. 'I now realise the best
players think the clubs have become benevolent societies for out of work
players' said David Watkins, team manager of Newport.
Some leading clubs are able to offer players a car, job and accommodation
and in very rare cases, all three.
A question: Is this money bad for the game? It has certainly changed the
face of it at the highest level. Rugby is fiercer. There is a real edge to
League games. The start of Northampton's match against Bristol in division
one of the Courage Leagues was as fierce as any game I have ever seen.
I dislike the abuse of the spirit of the laws, if not the laws themselves,
in rugby these days. Last Wednesday night during the game at Cardiff between
a Welsh XV and Italy, physios were on the pitch attending to injuries the
moment a player went down. Once upon a time, a trainer had to be invited on
by the referee.
By the same token, there is no adherence to the understanding that the
referee controls who is on the field. At one point while Wales were kicking
at goal two of the team's attendants were on the field handing out drinks.
And another thing. The replacement law is being used as a substitution law
in some countries. There is no observance of the spirit of the law which is
that a player can only be replaced if he is too injured to carry on.
So if everything else is changing, what is wrong with the arrival in the
game of large sums of money? Here is one way to control it. Name one home
game as belonging to the players in the way that footballers and cricketers
are granted testimonials and benefit matches and let them take the entire
gate, the money to be held in trust until they retire.
Rugby is played by thousands of clubs and market forces will determine which
gets the money and which does not. I suspect that in a few years the game
will comprise those clubs with money and the rest - and the rest will be the
majority. Is that such a bad thing?
