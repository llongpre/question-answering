MY FRIEND Dai is a rational sort of chap. He lives near Birmingham (well, no
one is perfect) and writes calmly and only occasionally irascibly about
golf. There is nothing to suggest he has rabid tendencies. Yet, this man is
metamorphosed on occasions such as today when Wales are playing rugby
against England.
A couple of years ago, we were in Jacksonville, Florida, on the day Wales
faced England. In the early evening, Dai returned from telephoning home with
a smile as large as his stomach (which was, and is, ample). 'We stuffed 'em,
12-9,' he said. It did not matter that it was a rotten game. The only
important thing was that the men in red had won.
England versus Wales is, indeed, like no other rugby match. Wales against
Ireland is a meeting of (fairly) like-minded Celts. Scotland against France
has its own particular appeal, notably because the Scots have never won at
the Parc des Princes in Paris (or beaten France in Paris since 1969, for
that matter). But England v Wales has an edge that is sporting and
sociological, physical and political.
'Forget the All Blacks, the Wallabies, and the Springboks,' said David
Watkins, the former Wales and British Lions international. 'It's beating
England, the oppressors, that fires the imagination of every Welshman.'
In my view, the Welsh and the English are like the French and the English.
They are not meant to co-exist, and it is unfortunate that the two countries
are in such close proximity. One can sing, the other cannot. One can play
cricket, the other cannot. One owned the mines and the steel works, the
other worked in them. One bred sheep, the other stole them. One supplies the
water, the other drinks it.
Character and temperament are two differences that mark out the Welsh from
the English. Language is a third; Gareth Edwards and Barry John used to
confuse opponents by talking to one another in Welsh.
George Ewart wrote in The Strength of the Hills: 'No one can understand the
seriousness that is paid to rugby in Wales unless he views it as a social
and political affirmation of its nationhood. For a nation that has existed
for many years as subject to a more powerful one, it is the sheet anchor of
its self-respect.'
You need only a slight grasp of history to be aware of the sense of
injustice the Welsh can summon up against the English - and do, regularly.
Before the game in Cardiff in 1977, skipper Phil Bennett is said in his team
talk to have dwelled on every sociological and political slight delivered to
the Welsh by the English.
'They have taken our coal, our water, our steel. They buy our houses and
they only live in them for a fortnight every 12 months. What have they given
us? Absolutely nothing. We've been exploited, raped, controlled and punished
by the English - and that's who you are playing this afternoon.' (Wales won,
14-9).
In speech, England and Wales are two nations divided by a common language.
In England, the game is often known as rugger. In Wales, it is rugby - and
you will be laughed out of a pub if you start talking about rugger.
In literature, the difference is striking. England's rugby heroes are
described as if they are Greek gods. Of Ronnie Poulton-Palmer, it once was
written: 'The wondrous Poulton, the fleet and flaxen, a golden-haired Apollo
who stood as a symbol of the heart of England.' By comparison, the Rev Frank
Marshall damned with faint praise when he described Arthur Gould, of Wales,
a truly great player and one far superior to Poulton-Palmer, as: 'The
greatest centre three-quarter that has ever played.'
In their book Rugger, published in 1927, former England internationals
Wavell Wakefield and HP Marshall wrote: 'A man who plays (rugby) must be
ready to give and take hard knocks, but he will take and give them with a
grin. He will need courage and determination and a sense of humour, and he
must learn the meaning of unselfishness.'
Contrast that with this passage by Richard Llewellyn in How Green Was My
Valley, published only a few years later: 'But Cyfartha is like a
fisherman's net. The fly-half has been too clever and wants the try himself,
and on he goes, tries to sell a dummy, and how the crowd is laughing, for to
sell a dummy to Cyfartha is to sell poison to a Borgia.'
In spite of the two countries' differences, one date has considerable
significance for both: June 8 1987 when Wales beat England 16-3 in Brisbane,
Australia, in a quarter-final of the first World Cup. I think that was the
worst result for Wales and the best thing to have happened to England. The
Welsh reaction was to gloat - again proving themselves superior to their
oldest and bitterest rivals. The reality was that this victory covered
serious deficiencies. What was wrong quickly became apparent, and Wales
entered a trough comparable to that between 1923 and 1930 when they won only
nine of 32 games.
England, by contrast, began a recovery programme that has made them one of
the three leading nations in world rugby. In their past three meetings with
Wales, the English have scored 83 points, the Welsh only 12.
'Wales is proud of this victory. Welsh peers and labourers - with all the
intervening stratas of society - were united in acclaiming and cheering the
Welsh team. It was . . . a victory for Wales that probably is impossible in
any other sphere.' So wrote the Western Mail, the national daily newspaper,
the morning after Wales had defeated the 1935 All Blacks 13-12 at the Arms
Park. The same might be said if the Welsh win at Cardiff this afternoon.
