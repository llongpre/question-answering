The World Cup has grown so large that it blots out the sun for five weeks
and throws into shade other sports events for months before and after. But
around the orgy of marketing and broadcasting there was a normal sporting
year, with an abnormal number of extreme highs and lows.
The Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, in February opened in a blaze of
publicity after Nancy Kerrigan, a figure skater, was attacked with a crow
bar during the US trials by Jeff Gillooly, the husband of her chief rival
Tonya Harding.
Kerrigan lost at the Olympics to Oksana Bayul of the Ukraine. In Britain,
24m people tuned in to watch Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean try in vain
to regain the Olympic ice dance title. Instead, the hero of the games was
the impossibly noble Norwegian Johan Olav Koss, an Easter Island man on
blades, who won three golds and set three world records.
The unfancied Welsh won the five nations championship in rugby, though
nobody could quite work out how they did it. Wigan won the double in rugby
league. But the visits of the Australian rugby league team and the South
African union side suggested that the centre of gravity in both sports
remains firmly in the southern hemisphere.
The balance of power in golf is also shifting south of the equator. Nick
Price of Zimbabwe won the Open and the US PGA. While Ernie Els of South
Africa won five tournaments, including the US Open, and a record Pounds
1.8m.
Cricket had its share of heroes and villains. Brian Lara broke Sir Garfield
Sobers' test scoring record with 375 against England in Antigua in April,
then joined Warwickshire, helping them to win three trophies, and scoring
501 against Durham at Edgbaston.
The England Test team continued to reel from crisis to crisis, pausing only
to raise their fans' expectations cruelly with competent performances
against West Indies in Barbados, where Alec Stewart scored two centuries,
and against South Africa at the Oval, where Devon Malcolm took nine wickets
for 57 runs to save the series. The nadir among many low spots was the
unseemly matter of the dirt in captain Mike Atherton's pocket. The England
team finished the year supine at the feet of Shane Warne, the Australian
spin bowler.
The Formula 1 drivers' championship was decided in the last Grand Prix in
Adelaide where Michael Schumacher collided with Damon Hill at speed.
Schumacher was widely accused of crashing deliberately to preserve his lead
in the championship. Like all the drivers, Schumacher is acutely aware of
the dangers of losing control. The whole season was raced under a pall after
Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger died in much-replayed crashes. If
Schumacher was so desperate to win that he was prepared to risk being a
posthumous champion, then he has crossed the line between bravery and
lunacy.
Perhaps the anti-blood sports league should found a branch to protect
humans. It could demonstrate at grand prix circuits, American football games
and boxing matches. Boxing resembles professional wrestling more every year.
But wrestling has better costumes, fitter performers and more plausible
fights.
Twenty years ago in Kinshasa, a superbly fit 25-year-old faced Muhammad Ali,
32 and deemed to be over the hill, for the world heavyweight title. Ali won.
George Foreman lost. It is a measure of how far boxing has decayed that in
November, Foreman, now an overweight, bald, grandfather, regained the
heavyweight crown.
It is easy to understand why Frank Bruno was so willing to foresake
pantomime in search of yet another last boxing pay-day, since there is less
and less difference between the two.
Tennis also needs a serious heavyweight champion. Martina Navratilova
retired; Monica Seles refused to unretire; Steffi Graf often played as if
she was thinking of retiring; and Jennifer Capriati, retired, was arrested
in a drugs raid, and then came back. The WTC raised the minimum age for
players to protect them from burning out. It then waived the rules to admit
two 14-year-olds with star quality: Martina Hingis and Venus Williams.
Pete Sampras finished the year as men's number one. He is the leader of an
elite of hard-working young men without charisma who hit the ball very hard.
The exception is Andre Agassi, who returned after a five-month lay-off and
won the US Open unseeded, pleasing those who still believe in genius.
The apex of the soccer year was not the World Cup final but the European Cup
final in May. Milan swept aside Barcelona 4-0 with a performance that seemed
to herald a new era for the club and the sport. Instead, the club's fortunes
have mirrored those of its owner, Silvio Berlusconi. In the autumn, Milan
lost the World Club final to Velez Sarsfield, a poor and unglamorous club
from Buenos Aires.
The World Cup in the US opened well. Fifa, world soccer's governing body,
had, it seemed, got it right. The stadiums were full; the referees enforced
new, harsher laws and, as a result, goals and play flowed.
A darker note entered in the second round after Diego Maradona was expelled
for drug-taking and Andreas Escobar was shot after scoring an own goal which
helped eliminate Colombia, one of the pre-tournament favourites.
Matches were staged at midday or in mid-afternoon to accommodate European
television viewers, and the soccer began to suffer.
Players had to work in conditions that ran from sweat-shop (New York),
through steel-foundry (Dallas) to Turkish bath (Orlando).
Teams that had spent five weeks playing in steam ran out of it in the end.
The final was a weary spectacle. It yielded no goals and was decided by the
inability of the cramped legs of Franco Baresi and Roberto Baggio to keep
their penalties down.
The finals still yielded rich memories: Baggio's last-minute heroics, George
Hagi's guile, Hristo Stoichkov's explosiveness, Saeed Owairan's unorthodoxy,
Romario's gift for the unexpected, the Nigerian mix of delicacy and power,
the attacking teamwork of the Spaniards. The World Cup provided some light
in the year of the crash and the crow bar.
