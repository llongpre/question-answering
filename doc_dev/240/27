The Five Nations Championship opens this afternoon with France (the
champions) playing rejuvenated Ireland, and Wales (the holders of the wooden
spoon) entertaining Scotland in Cardiff. These games will provide an early
test of how much the coaches have learnt from last season's experience with
the new laws.
This is the second year since the changes. Two changes have proved
particularly significant. The first is that if a penalty is kicked into
touch, the team doing the kicking is awarded the throw-in. As the number of
penalties has grown this has put a premium both on the line kicker, who
cannot afford to miss touch, and the line-out. Win the line-out and you win
the match.
The second-row forwards must now be better line-out performers than
scrummagers. The hooker must throw in better than he can hook. It does not
matter (as the French have shown) who throws in, as long as they throw
accurately.
Throwing has changed too. The two hookers in Cardiff today, Garin Jenkins
and Ken Milne take the ball behind their head (and therefore out of their
line of sight). Darts players throw from in front of their face and it makes
sense for hookers to follow suit, as does Sean Fitzpatrick, the New Zealand
captain.
The French won the first Test against Australia in October but this was a
fluke because they lost the line-outs. If the Welsh second row pairing of
Phil Davies and Gareth Llewellyn out-play the new cap, Shade Munro and the
old stager, Neil Edwards, as they should do, then Wales should win.
From the line-out the object is to cross the imaginary gain-line as close to
the forwards as possible. This has meant that all three back-row players and
the scrum-half try to batter their way through the first line of defence.
Expect endless variations on this theme from the Scottish trio of Derek
Turnbull, Robert Wainwright and Iain Morrison. The key is to make sure that
the ball comes back on your side.
When their teams win this position, the fly-halves, Gareth Jenkins and Craig
Chalmers will hoof the ball up in the air - the 'bomb' in rugby league, the
more prosaic Garryowen in union. When the ball comes down a defender will
catch it surrounded by the opposition who will make sure the ensuing maul or
ruck is inconclusive so their team wins the put-in at the scrum. This change
in the laws has altered the very nature of the game.
Wales have no players of sufficient individual brilliance to win matches on
their own. Scott Quinnell, Rupert Moon and Neil Jenkins at number eight,
scrum-half and fly-half respectively have to hold the side together. Jenkins
is having a fine season at club level but has struggled in his 17
internationals (much as Rob Andrew did during his first 20 caps). Wales so
badly need a fly-half. I hope it is his day.
The only certainty about Scotland is that they will turn up for the game.
They will need to experiment early on in the line-out by shortening them and
must not be afraid to run the ball from deep positions. Too often they have
waited until the last quarter of the game before gambling and too often they
have depended on Gavin Hastings' place kicking abilities.
Wales and Scotland fear failure and will keep their tactics simple. Both
teams will kick for yardage again and again. Wales must win. Scotland cannot
afford to lose.
