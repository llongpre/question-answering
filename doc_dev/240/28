Since England's disappointing tour there in May, South African rugby has
hardly been out of the news. Fracas on the field has been matched by verbal
dust-up off it. Recently, Dr Louise Luyt, the SA President said in an
interview that rugby union would be professional by 1995, that Home Union
officials should be fired and that the 1991 World Cup was laughable.
No one within the hermetically sealed committee rooms of the four Home
Unions knows how to read the 'new' South Africa. It was not always thus.
Five years ago, when the political map of that country was more certain or
at least more dependent on the Afrikaner vote, rugby union, unlike nearly
every other sport in the world, helped prop up the political status quo in
South Africa.
There were no boycotts, no ban on players, referees or administrators
visiting the country from the body that pretended it represented the world
view of rugby, the International Rugby Board.
England toured there in 1984; New Zealand tried to tour in 1985 but a
successful court case led by the affable New Zealand rugby player Paddy
Finnigan QC stopped the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in their tracks in
the high court in Wellington. When Judge Casey deliberated at a special
sitting on a Saturday morning in Wellington, the whole of the country was
rooted to the spot. A packed public gallery trailed outside, blocking
traffic. When he found in favour of Finnigan the applause of the gallery
reached out, like a Mexican wave, to the streets and beyond.
New Zealand, whose own rugby union had toured South Africa without Maoris to
accommodate the apartheid policies of the South Africans, was posting notice
that it was growing up. Within months, the British Lions due to tour South
Africa in 1985, fearful also of a legal challenge, called off the tour. Only
the French, as ever, decided to break ranks, touring in 1990.
But there were two other tours. The first was the Andy-Haden-inspired
renegade tour of South Africa by a New Zealand Cavaliers side, and the
second was a group of international players who played in the white South
African rugby board's centenary matches in 1989.
Haden denies there was any incentive other than pride for the team he
secretly assembled. But the 1989 tour was altogether different. Such was the
subterfuge, allegation and rumour within the Welsh Rugby Union of the
amounts of money given to players and administrators who attended those
celebrations that a report was commissioned.
That report, of which there are three versions - one of over 2,000 pages,
one of about a 1,000 pages, and a shorter report of only 13 pages. I have a
copy of the shorter version. It states:
' . . . Had we been deciding this issue (payment) on the balance of
probabilities that, from the evidence heard, we would have found that most
(and quite possibly all) of the players were handsomely rewarded for going
to South Africa. By that we mean that they received money, and not just the
incidental benefits. At least one player received at least Pounds 30,000 and
others as much or broadly comparable figures . . .'
The report carefully lays the blame on the players but I am sure that the
administrators who attended were also well rewarded.
Who paid? Why, the South African Rugby Board under that wily old fox Danie
Craven.
The irony is that this report was carried out by Vernon Pugh QC, then an
innocent by-stander in Welsh rugby affairs. Three years later he is both
chairman of the Welsh Rugby Union and the International Rugby Football
Board. Two weeks ago, Luyt failed to appear at the interim IRFB board
meeting in Vancouver, where he was to be asked to explain his remarks on the
four Home Unions.
I would guess, therefore, that if you were Pugh, almost the last country you
would want to confront on and off the field currently would be South Africa.
Yet South Africa are in Wales and carrying all before them.
Once the sporting isolation was imposed, club rugby in South Africa
gradually became a bit-part player to the provinces. The provinces owned the
grounds and had the television and sponsorship. And with no one to play, the
country had little choice but to turn its provincial championship into a
mini-international series.
The gates were huge, frequently topping 40,000, often reaching the 65,000
capacity of the larger grounds. Consequently the amount of money piling up
was unreal in an unreal country. That money meant that South African rugby
union could stop its players following the country's cricketers to Australia
and England.
To keep them, deals were done. These started with inflated expenses and
turned almost into payments and then salaries. Luyt knows the score. What
irritates him is that he believes this is the direction all top-level rugby
union must go. He cannot fathom why the four Home Unions are hiding the
truth. He knows how much some of them were paid to come to South Africa in
1989.
Meanwhile, the side South Africa has brought to Wales and Scotland is good
verging on excellent. It is hard to see any real weaknesses except that the
team has not yet gelled completely and sometimes coasts when it is ahead.
There are some great players - Japie Mulder and Brendan Venter in the centre
and Mark Andrews and Dirkus Hatingh in the second row - but, as always,
South Africa takes time to settle when overseas. Just the public scrutiny is
hard for them to take coming, as they do, from a society that hid the truth
for so long.
They were last in the UK only two years ago when the last team of the Naas
Botha era played against England. Botha briefly played American football for
the Dallas Cowboys and yet was re-admitted to the amateur game immediately
his contract ended. On the field, Botha led South African rugby down too
many blind alleys because he saw the game only in yardage; making huge kicks
to take his forwards over the gain line.
Two years on, this side is fitter, faster, heavier up-front and stronger in
every position. Its only problem, apart from a still over-vigorous approach,
is that it cannot decide on a half-back partnership. Nonetheless, the
Springboks are preparing to be crowned world champions next year at Ellis
Park, Johannesburg.
