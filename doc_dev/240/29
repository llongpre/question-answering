English rugby's governing body, the Rugby Football Union, has decided that
it will not go it alone in the current television negotiations for the Five
Nations championship. The RFU's executive committee met yesterday afternoon
and decided to present a united front with its counterparts from Ireland,
Wales and Scotland.
Rugby's television contract from September 1, 1994 is for sale and as rugby
is a sport of political intrigue, the debate about who will win has caused
much commotion and emotion off the field. War broke out on the four home
unions television sub-committee when the RFU suggested that the traditional
equal split of everything needed reassessing.
The problem is that the French Federation de Rugby already has its own deal
for the Five Nations and for years has received more money than any of the
four home unions. The RFU was tempted to follow the French example.
At least yesterday's meeting means there will be an equal split of the
television revenues, but from only the domestic rights of the Five Nations
Championship. 'We're still thinking of a three-year deal,' said Dudley Wood,
the RFU secretary, 'but we wouldn't rule out a five-year option if the money
was right.'
When the Five Nations Championship television contract was last put out to
tender, three years ago, there were two bidders: ITV and BBC. ITV was
confident that having secured the 1991 Rugby World Cup it would win the Five
Nations as well. It did not. The BBC bid Pounds 10m which the four home
unions split equally.
But it was not quite that equal. Sport is not taxed in the Irish Republic,
so the Irish RFU's Pounds 2.5m is tax free. Wales' share was augmented by a
Pounds 1m contract with BBC Wales for club rugby.
The Four home unions need large amounts of cash. The English, Scots and
Irish are rebuilding their stadia. All are following England's lead in
expanding their infrastructure.
If a broadcaster came up with a generous five-year offer, the four home
unions would be compelled to take it. There are also signs that the RFU's
loyalty to the BBC may be wavering. 'We will have to go to the highest
bidder,' said Wood. 'We have the Twickenham West Stand to rebuild.'
For the first time, Sky Sports will be a contender. Sky follows Rupert
Murdoch's philosophy of using big sports events to build viewing figures.
Murdoch's Fox Network in the US has just paid Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn)
for NFL Football and has already made a play for the 1998 Winter and 2000
Summer Olympics. If Sky bids for world rights for the Five Nations for the
next five years it could push the price above Pounds 60m.
England's argument for more of the cake is irrefutable. Its team is the box
office draw and Twickenham was full for the London Division game against the
All Blacks, and the Varsity Match established a new record for a club game.
Wales could not sell out its fixture against Canada; Ireland failed to fill
Lansdowne Road for its game against Romania.
In order to attract the highest price the home unions will have to make
their fixture schedule more attractive. They can introduce a season-opening
fixture, for example a President's XV v a World XV (with the gate going to a
rugby charity; an idea that has been considered and turned down by
Twickenham). The Barbarians game could be moved to the beginning of all
tours and make way for a Lions match at the end. The Five Nations matches
could be played on both Saturdays and Sundays and moved nearer to the end of
the season to allow club and provincial rugby to breathe.
The four home unions sub-committee has been slow to understand the changes
in the media since the last television contract was negotiated. It simply
cannot afford to get it wrong this time.
