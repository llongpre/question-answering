ELEVEN weeks ago I sat in the press box at Twickenham filled with
apprehension as England faced Australia in the final of the World Cup.
England had played heroically to defeat France and Scotland in eight days -
away from home, at that - but now, surely, their number was up against the
most gifted all-round team in the event.
So Australia's victory was not unexpected (they had beaten England 40-15
only a few months earlier). What was a surprise was England's stubborn
resistance. They outplayed the Australians in the second half when facing
the wind and outscored them by two penalties to one. Had England played to
their forwards, who were colossal that November afternoon, as they had in
their two previous matches, they could have beaten the Aussies.
But they did not. Instead they contributed enormously to a thrilling final
that did as much for rugby around the world as anyone could have wished.
Now here we go again. This afternoon England face Scotland at Murrayfield
and Wales play Ireland at Lansdowne Road. The 1991-92 five nations'
championship will not equal the World Cup in many aspects, if any. The
standard of play will be lower, the players less well-prepared and
motivated, but it is certain to add a bit of zing to life between now and
March 21.
During the World Cup, Finlay Calder, the Scottish captain, said he thought
the championship would diminish in significance in coming years,
overshadowed by the World Cup. I think he is wrong. The World Cup has raised
the public's awareness of the game and thus of the five nations. Rugby has
never been so popular; as a result, this championship is the most widely
anticipated ever.
Every ground will be full for the eight matches (610,000 spectators will
attend in all, paying Pounds 16m). England's home matches at Twickenham
could have been sold out three times over.
What makes the 1991-92 five nations so interesting are the questions that
can be asked: can England, under new coach Dick Best, win the grand slam
again? The odds are against them, even though they are the best team.
Successive slams have been won only three times in 82 years.
How will Scotland fare without the magnificent back row that was together
for 22 matches and outstanding scrum-half Gary Armstrong? Was Ireland's
stunning performance against the Australians in the World Cup quarter-finals
a fluke? The Irish have more match winners and more depth than for years and
they have, as Yeats said, 'still the indomitable Irishry'. What will these
virtues bring them in the coming weeks?
A much more significant question is whether Wales can make significant
progress towards parity with the other countries instead of being their
whipping boys.
This is an important matter to me. I am a Welshman. I was born in Wales of
Welsh parentage. My grandfather was involved in selecting schoolboy players
in Wales and remembers choosing a promising full-back named Vivian Jenkins.
I went to school in south Wales and on holiday in north Wales. I have sung
Welsh in Wales. I am Welsh from top to toe.
There was a time when I would have said it was good for Wales to lose a
match. It would puncture the complacency that existed around Cardiff. For
example, it would have been better for Wales if they had been run into the
ground by England in that notorious match in 1980, the match in which Paul
Ringer was sent off early on. Instead, a sordid game went down in Wales's
history as a glorious defeat.
Wales's third-place finish in the first World Cup in 1987 was also
unfortunate, for it papered over the cracks in their game. 'Well, boys, we
can't be that bad can we if we came third in the World Cup,' went the
argument.
But now, I have had enough of defeats. I am desperate for a Welsh victory.
Just as it used to be said that English rugby was strongest when Gloucester,
Coventry and Northampton were at their best, so British rugby is strongest
when Welsh rugby is at its best. Welsh rugby is the heartbeat of the game in
Europe. If Welsh rugby was as strong as it was 15 or 20 years ago, the
British Lions would be unbeatable.
When Welsh rugby is weak, as it is now, British rugby is diminished by far
more than one quarter. 'When Wales are out of rugby, rugby is out of sorts,'
says Tony O'Reilly. Welsh rugby is so out of sorts at present that only one
Welshman would get into a British Lions' side.
The good news for those from the land of the leek is that Alan Davies has
set about his duties as coach to the national team with flair and vision. He
replaced the Stakhanovite coaching techniques of his predecessor with a
lighter, defter touch. He raised the players' confidence, tried to make
rugby a game to enjoy, not endure. He has employed sportsmen and coaches
from other disciplines to talk to his players about fitness and has
recruited some of the most influential names from Welsh rugby of the past
two decades to help.
Whether it will be sufficient for Wales to achieve Davies's target of
winning one of their four matches in the five nations remains to be seen.
Wales have to play France at home, which is far better than facing them in
Paris.
England, however, must be faced at Twickenham. How Wales will set about the
task of countering the twin towers of Martin Bayfield and Wade Dooley,
England's gigantic locks is just one question that will be answered in the
next five weeks.
All I want is the start of a Welsh revival, a sign of something to sing
about. A strong Welsh team is good for the game. No one can deny that, not
even an Englishman.
