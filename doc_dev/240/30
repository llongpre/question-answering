Dudley Wood is a big lad. He needs to be. As secretary of the Rugby Football
Union, he sits on a rugby throne whose power and wealth has swelled in the
seven years that he has occupied it. Since 1986, the Rugby Union's business
has grown from Pounds 5m to nearer Pounds 45m; the staff from 50 to more
than 100. It owned the Twickenham ground, an assortment of allotments,
better known as car parks, and 26 houses nearby, now it has a rebuilt
stadium and a second ground complete with hotel in Wolverhampton. You have
to pinch yourself to remember that all this has happened while the economy
has been in reverse.
This increased financial strength has made England the dominant nation in
the talking-shop which some refer to as the Four Home Unions committee. But
on the field progress has stalled. The All Blacks triumphal progress round
Britain suggests that this afternoon's international will provide another
demonstration of the gap between England and the top nations in the southern
hemisphere. Wood is using his muscle to persuade the other home unions to
accept changes which serve England's aspirations rather than their own
interests. Wood plans changes to club rugby in Europe, in the way tours are
handled and in the five nations championship and the distribution of the
television revenue it generates.
'In future we will be looking to develop a Test series against an incoming
country like Australia. I suspect this would be two Tests. it would be nice
to think that we could hold one in the north and one at Twickenham. We had
the South Africans at Elland Road (Leeds United's ground) last year and this
year the crowds at Anfield (in Liverpool) and Gateshead for the New
Zealanders suggest there is a large audience for our game,' said Wood.
The reality is that with Pounds 28m raised to complete the north and east
stands at Twickenham - the latter is opened today - and the west stand due
for rebuilding starting in May,a two Test series would have to be played
entirely at Twickenham in the immediate future to maximise income.
Whether English rugby remains fashionable depends on how the team fares in
the world cup, due to be held in South Africa in 12 games', or 19 months',
time. Certainly, England's club structure, though heaving under the strain
of home and away Courage league fixtures, is vibrant and the envy of all,
save the French.
The Welsh, whose domestic league is sponsored by Heineken beer, want to
improve competition for their top clubs and have urged the creation an
Anglo-Welsh league. Woods said: 'There is no urgency to establish an
Anglo-Welsh league. The home and away fixtures must stay for one more
season, so we can best see how to adjust the numbers in the top three
divisions. There's no flexibility at present and if we had a bad winter I'm
not sure how we would fit in those matches cancelled.
'The four English clubs who met their Welsh counterparts the other day did
telephone me to tell me what they were doing. Of course, we understand that
these fixtures were and are important to them and add extra spice and
revenue. It is probably true too that at the moment the Welsh clubs need the
English clubs more than we need them. We have sponsorship deals to honour -
in Courage's case we've another three and a half seasons to go - and we
won't be dictated to by other sponsors.
'Adding more to the time-table would impact on the Five Nations which we
have been trying to push back towards the end of the season but we cannot
convince the French who do not wish to move their club competition. I'm not
sure we can expand it either. Romania is not the strength it was and our B
team has comprehensively beaten Italy and Spain so they must wait. America
is struggling and only Canada would be worth considering and two leagues of
five probably wouldn't work.'
The Five Nations Championships is the envy of all other sports. No-one in
their right minds would tamper with it, except . . . except . . . the
tournament is not serving the aspirations of French or English rugby.
The quality of the play in the five nations has fallen. The standards set by
Australia in the Parc des Princes three weeks ago against France and the
power of the All Blacks showed last Saturday against an embarrassingly weak
Scotland team, showed that it has become too inward looking.
While New Zealand has its sights on the World Cup in 1995, England has its
sights on the Five Nations and the World Cup. To some extent the Five
Nations is now an irritant in the preparation of the squad. Yet, it is the
proverbial jewel in the crown where television is concerned even though the
existing contracts are confused.
In France, the broadcaster Antenne 2 owns the rights for France's
championship home games until 1995. The BBC owns the rights to games in the
UK until 1994. Another UK broadcaster - Sky or ITV - could buy the rights to
the French games from Antenne 2 and put any new UK deal in jeopardy.
Ireland's state broadcaster RTE could do a similar deal. There is nothing to
stop them.
The Four Home Unions television sub-committee has not kept abreast of
developments in the European media and is still trying to formulate a
contract to put out to tender. Wood conceded as much: 'It has been a tricky
series of negotiations between the four home unions and about what we want
to put in the tender. We are aware of the holes that exist.'
In the past the four home unions have divided the cake into equal parts and
though Wood would not commit himself it is apparent that this will no longer
be the case. England, with the largest rugby population, will receive more
than the others, possibly as much as 40 per cent of the total.
The senior clubs, who want to negotiate their own television contract, shot
themselves in the foot a few weeks back. Racing at Ascot was called off and
BBC television offered to take the second half of the Wasps v Bath game live
for Pounds 15,000. The senior clubs refused, fearing it would harm their
gates that afternoon. Televising it would have given them some idea of the
pull of the leagues and some reaction from their sponsors.
It is sometimes easy to forget that all these developments have come about
because of the 15 England players who will try to stem the All Black tide
this afternoon. It is they who have created the increasing demand for the
game. Their development is being held up by the parochialism of the home
unions. If they had their way, I believe, they would want England to plot
its own future independent of the other three home countries.
