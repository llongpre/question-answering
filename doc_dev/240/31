THERE ARE not many days when I am torn between watching rugby union or rugby
league but today is one of them. This afternoon I could see the two
outstanding teams at their respective codes in action a few miles from one
another: Bath at Twickenham, where they will try to win the rugby union
Pilkington Cup a week after they wrapped up the league; and Wigan at
Wembley, where they will do the double if they defeat Castleford in the Silk
Cut Challenge Cup, having already won the championship.
Bath and Wigan are 250 miles apart yet joined by their outstanding success
in recent years at the two codes of the oval ball game. Bath have been the
dominant union club in England since the election before the election before
last. This is their seventh Cup final; they have won the previous six. They
have won the league title three times.
Wigan have found success at rugby league more recently. At the start of the
1980s they were in division two and facing bankruptcy. Such is their
transformation that if they win today it will be the third year in a row
that they have collected both of League's top prizes the Challenge Cup and
the Stones Bitter Championship: indeed, it will be their fifth successive
Challenge Cup.
The success of Bath and Wigan is often attributed to players and officials.
Invariably, however, there is one man who is oiling the wheels, whose
thinking sets the patterns, who can be regarded as the moving force of the
club.
At Bath it is Jack Rowell, the club's chief coach, who was recently
appointed coach of England's B squad. Rowell commands respect from his
players while retaining his distance from them. 'An hour with him is worth
five with anyone else,' a supporter said. Why? 'He talks such good sense. He
has one of the quickest minds I have ever come across.'
Rowell's work at Bath is in his free time, unpaid and voluntary. Rugby union
is an amateur game but it has not stopped him bringing the management
techniques and skill he employs as chief executive of Golden Wonder Foods to
the Recreation Field. He works tirelessly with his players, improving their
individual skills, making them more rounded players and thereby of more use
to Bath, making them what Wigan's chairman refers to as the complete
product.
Take Jim Fallon as an example. At Bath he has matured into one of the finest
left wings in the country, fast and, at nearly 15 stone, strong enough to
barrel his way past others. Victor Ubogu, the prop, is another who has been
brought on. As for Ben Clarke, the No 8 who joined from Saracens, he may now
be the best No 8 in English rugby.
Waiting in the wings are young men like John Mallett, the prop, and Audley
Lumsden at full back. One of the reasons for Rowell's success as a
businessman is his success with people. He is a natural pedagogue, a born
teacher and in the past 15 years at Bath he has worked the oracle with
successive captains, from Roger Spurrell to Simon Halliday and now Stuart
Barnes.
The man behind Wigan's rise achieved nothing as a player. For Maurice
Lindsay, Wigan was a cause he wanted to take up. He had the money following
the sale of his bookmaking business and the club was ready for a dose of his
cheerful common and financial sense and commitment. Ring Wigan in the early
evening after the office staff have gone and it is likely to be Lindsay who
answers the telephone.
He is running a multi-million pound business. The players earn an average of
Pounds 90,000; the minimum is Pounds 45,000. Including bonuses, the players
are expected to receive nearly Pounds 2m this season.
To meet this bill and other costs, an income of Pounds 3m is needed. Norweb
(the North West Electricity Board) is the club's main sponsor. Wigan were
always well-supported. Their average gate is more than 15,000, twice as many
as any other League club except Leeds and an astonishing tribute to the fans
and to the players. Thus match receipts make a significant contribution
towards the annual running costs of the club, as do a nightclub, smaller
sponsors and a shop selling associated products.
One of Lindsay's shrewdest decisions was to bring first the New Zealander
Graham Lowe and now John Monie from Australia as coaches. These two men were
at the cutting edge of the game in the Antipodes. Their success with Wigan
has tilted the balance of power towards northern Europe. In the vocational
aspect of his work, Monie echoes Rowell. 'I try to educate players to the
game, to understand themselves and their team mates. I'd like to think that
when I leave here they should all know enough to go on and become coaches.'
At Bath, Rowell has developed a blueprint that has withstood the scrutiny
and copying of coaching administrators at other clubs, such as Barry Corless
at Northampton. 'Orrell are a match for us in commitment, Northampton in the
way they have got the club organised,' says Stuart Barnes, Bath's captain.
'But at the moment and for the foreseeable future we have that ruthless edge
in will and determination.' There is no sign of this waning. They have lost
only two league matches at home since the league's inception.
For that matter, Wigan are in no danger of losing their dominance in rugby
league. Their crushing victory over Warrington last Sunday was their 22nd
victory in a row. Thirteen of their players will tour Australasia with Great
Britain this summer, the highest total ever from one club.
Wigan have swept every trophy except for the Premier trophy, and they could
win that this year. The double was rare enough until they first did it two
seasons ago. A treble would be unheard of, fantastic. But then Wigan are
just that, fantastic. Rugby Union could learn a lot from them.
