For England there is no respite. On Wednesday they were run close by Western
Transvaal, a provincial union so isolated and backward in the larger scheme
of things that its supporters proudly display giant flags of the old South
Africa.
England's tour of South Africa has so far proved a nasty shock to European
sensibilities. Which flag is which? And what to make of the 11 official
languages and the smell of cordite that follows them on to the rugby field.
England are supposedly testing the water ahead of next year's World Cup in
South Africa but they have hardly performed like potential world champions.
Thrown off balance by the aggression of their South African opponents, they
look vulnerable on the bone-hard playing surfaces of the high veld. Nor do
the rarefied air and the awkward bounce of the ball make survival any
easier.
They lost their first two games, to Free State and Natal. On Wednesday,
England looked no less tentative in their 26-24 victory over Western
Transvaal.
The one disruptive factor to which the English seem oblivious is the South
African ploy of speaking Afrikaans, to obscure lineout and other signals.
The language barrier may benefit Will Carling's charges. At least Victor
Ubogu, having not yet mastered Afrikaans swear words, has been unfazed when
singled out for verbal abuse. Physical abuse is another matter.
England's expanding casualty list, caused chiefly by the hard ground, as
much as their indifferent form, has convinced aficionados that their
two-Test challenge has already collapsed. If Free State and Natal can
dethorn the rose which such ease, surely South Africa will atomise them in
the internationals.
Two factors militate against this. Since its return to the world stage in
1992, South African rugby has been undermined by the very devices which
ensured survival through two decades of isolation.
The domestic Currie Cup competition has entrenched regional divisions to
such an extent that forging a new national entity may take years. Hard
evidence of the strength of provincial unions was provided by Transvaal's
win in the inaugural southern hemisphere Super 10 title last year, crushing
Auckland, from New Zealand, hitherto considered the best provincial team.
Two weeks ago Natal contested the second Super 10 final (albeit
unsuccessfully) against Queensland.
The South African captain, Francois Pienaar, was quoted in Australia as
saying that his provincial side, Transvaal, was a stronger unit than the
Springboks. This triggered a public outcry. Pienaar claimed he had been
misquoted, but whoever laid the words in his mouth was not far off the mark.
Had Pienaar not hurt his ankle the quote would almost certainly have
contributed to his losing the captaincy against England to fellow back row
forward, Tiaan Strauss.
The worst effect of the isolation era on the South African game has been an
erosion of refereeing standards. The comfy cocoon of so-called South African
invincibility was kept intact by officials badly out of step with world
standards.
This anomaly was exposed during the French tour to South Africa last season.
Like England, the Tricolores were no great shakes in the build-up to the
Tests, yet won the series 1-0, with a win and a draw.
South Africa could not adapt to the sudden return to an international
standard, applied by overseas referees in the Tests. I suspect England are
awaiting the arrival of the New Zealand referee Colin Hawke with
anticipation.
But poor refereeing does not explain why England have been so lacklustre.
Without the silky Jeremy Guscott, the backline appears wooden. Free State
played an attacking game to good effect by running first phase ball wide.
South Africa will also probe on the periphery, in part because they lack the
lineout forwards to match England.
South Africa's coach Ian Mclntosh, preoccupied with ball retention drills,
has been criticised for neglecting running rugby and the natural flair of
the South African three-quarters.
England might be looking increasingly dilapidated but South Africa's final
training session, with a bloated squad of 57 players, many of them injured,
sought refuge at a 'secret' venue; a sure sign of panic.
The Tests may turn on whether England can summon a heroic display from their
overworked pack. If England win another tryless victory, their fans can find
solace in the words of the late Boy Louw. Louw, one of South Africa's most
versatile forwards in the 1920s and 30s, was a national team manager with a
gift for the gab, if not for the English language.
Berated by the media after his team won by kicking all its points, Louw shot
back: 'Never mind. Just you looks at the scoreboard]'
