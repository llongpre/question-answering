FT  19 MAR 94 / As They say in Europe: A Titanic sinking on the rugby field

There is reason to believe that today could be marked by extraordinary, even
catastrophic, events. If France lose their final match in the five nations'
rugby championship against Scotland this afternoon, there is fair chance the
team will be wiped out by a public driven beyond all reasonable levels of
tolerance. Even more amazing will be the sight of the French sports writers
disappearing en masse in a flash of spontaneous combustion, or flinging
themselves from the highest point of the Murrayfield stadium in Edinburgh.
There will be different motives. The commentators on the France-Inter radio
station will be enraged by the unfairness of it all. Their reporting of the
(losing) game against England in Paris a fortnight ago was enlivened, for
me, by the succession of invisible fouls committed by English players, and
by a total ignorance of rule 13 which the referee (rightly) used to stop
Thierry Lacroix having a second go at a conversion attempt when the ball had
fallen over. 'We are all Europeans and therefore impartial, but really . . .
' said Eric somebody or other into his microphone.
The game also 'appeared' entirely different because, in the mouths of the
commentary team, the distinctly unandrogynous England hooker, Brian Moore,
emerged as Brie-Anne Morre, surely an American hooker.
In the newspapers, however, there was no feeling that France were victims.
The French writers decided, unanimously, that there was just one problem:
their team was no good. This was not just a matter of losing against
moderate opposition, nor of failing to play up to expected standards. It was
a failure of cosmic proportions - a sinking of the Titanic on the rugby
field. It was the kind of failure of which the former - and much-maligned -
England soccer manager, Graham Taylor, could only dream.
There were hints of catastrophe in earlier matches. The wide but
insubstantial victory over Ireland at Paris's Parc des Princes in the first
match raised doubts. Defeat by Wales in Cardiff rang alarm bells. 'Le feu
rouge,' shouted L'Equipe on its front page. This play on words meant either
Welsh fire or a red traffic light. After that match, coach Pierre Berbizier
commented: 'I preferred today's defeat to the victory of two years ago. I
know how we were beaten, but not how we won last time here.'
That was a hostage to fortune. For, by the time England arrived in Paris,
the press wanted no more understandable defeats but a victory. Especially
against a side that always beat them, especially at home.
Disaster struck: France were beaten 18-14. On page one, L'Equipe shouted:
'Change all this for us.' Page two was headlined 'The great fiasco', while
the newspaper declared the French XV to be brain-dead on page three under a
headline that read: 'The encephelogram is flat.'
Midi-Olympique was relatively phlegmatic: 'France is passing through its
worst crisis since the second world war,' it said, before asking: 'How has
France fallen so low?' It then opened what it called 'The burning dossiers
of tricolour rugby.'
In the nation's rugby capital, Toulouse, La Depeche du dimanche began its
report: 'This new defeat by England undoubtedly marks the end of a team
which, decidedly, has nothing more to give, not the savoir-faire, nor the
indispensable success at this level.'
It concluded: 'At the end of such a mediocre, yet poignant, match, it is not
appropriate to put forward ideas; a delirium of destruction cannot be
avoided.'
The 'poignancy' of the match came in the way England played. It consisted of
everything that arouses Gallic scorn, admiration and resentment. England
were boring, disciplined, resolute, unimaginative. A former national
fullback, Pierre Villepreux, wrote in Liberation: 'The English had no
doubts, even when France were dominant. They played on a tactical base which
they fully mastered . . . a game which brought together their culture and
education.'
In a typically Marxist interpretation of rugby, Villepreux concluded that
what counted was a unity of practice and tactics - something the French
lacked entirely.
There is a new team for today which excludes Olivier Roumat, the captain
against England, Wales and Ireland. L'Equipe proclaimed: 'It is not yet the
Regency, nor is it the end of the Empire.' There has been no 'delirium of
destruction,' though. Thierry Lacroix, whose missed kicks probably cost
France victory two weeks ago, said he was prepared for anything. 'We've been
slaughtered by the press and television all week,' he said.
But the critics are keeping their powder dry. After all, if Wales beat
England, as they will, and France beat a Scottish XV missing its best
player, scrum-half Gary Armstrong, as they will, France will finish second
this afternoon. Not bad for a side 'without aggression, will or
imagination'.
