FOOTBALL: European Champions League, November 23, IFK Gothenburg v
Manchester United.
Walloped 4-0 by Barcelona in their last game in Europe, United need to win
this one if they are to stand a good chance of reaching the knock-out stage
of the competition. Goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel is likely to miss the match,
after injuring a back muscle in the warm-up before Saturday's 3-0 win over
Crystal Palace - a victory that took United to the top of the Premiership.
Schmeichel was replaced by third-choice 'keeper Kevin Pilkington, but Gary
Walsh, who kept goal in the Nou Camp massacre, has recovered from a stomach
problem and will be fit for Wednesday. Too much was read into the Barcelona
defeat. The last time there was so much talk about English football lagging
the game elsewhere in Europe, it preceded a run in which Liverpool,
Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa totally dominated the European Cup.

CRICKET: Australia v England, Novemeber 25-29, 1st Test, Brisbane
Their performance was 'pathetic.' So said the normally mild-mannered England
team manager, Keith Fletcher, describing the tourists' dismal showing
against an Australian XI (effectively a second national team of Test
hopefuls) at the weekend - the final game before the first Test begins on
Friday at the Gabba. Captain Mike Atherton agreed: 'We really haven't played
well.' But Damien Martyn, Australian XI captain, yesterday refused to write
off England in the upcoming Ashes series. 'They will still worry Australia,'
he predicted. 'Graeme Hick and Graham Gooch look like being major forces for
them and I rate both Alec Stewart and Michael Atherton.'
Australia name their Test team today and, despite a glowing reference from
Martyn, fast bowler Merv Hughes could miss out on selection. One of the main
discussion points among the Australian selectors has been whether to recall
Hughes, after he missed the recent tour of Pakistan. Hughes took 3-46 in
England's first innings on Saturday, but is likely to be edged out of
contention this week by Damien Fleming, Glenn McGrath and Craig McDermott,
all of whom toured Pakistan.

RUGBY UNION: Wales v South Africa, November 26, Cardiff.
The repercussions of South Africa's violent clash with Neath are still
rumbling in Wales, and the Welsh Rugby Union is to study two videos of the
match at a meeting tonight in a bid to resolve the matter. However, the
Springboks will now have their minds on higher things. Francois Pienaar's
side answered several questions when they beat Scotland 34-10 at Murrayfield
on Saturday. They may be less eye-catching than
Australia, less disciplined than England or New Zealand and less spontaneous
than the French, but collectively they look a match for anybody.
