FT  19 SEP 92 / Sport: The revolution reaches Dursley - Rugby Union

YEARS AGO, I played a few games of rugby for Dursley, the town where I grew
up, halfway between Cheltenham and Bristol.
My brother appeared for the first team. I struggled into the seconds when no
one was looking and you get an idea of how improbable, though enjoyable, it
must have been when I say that I played both hooker and full back, not to
mention positions in between, in my dizzy spell in the colours of Dursley.
Then, as now, Gloucestershire was a hotbed of rugby. Bristol and Gloucester
were as friendly as rival politicians and the Forest of Dean and Lydney were
places you went to only with a police guard. A middle level existed for
teams such as Stroud. And then you came down to the Dursleys of this world.
It was pretty coarse rugby even though we did not have to carry the posts
out on to the pitch to play.
The changing rooms were in the local Memorial Hall which was not a hall at
all but a glorified tin shed on the edge of the pitch. We did not have a
headquarters. A local publican, who was Welsh and, ergo, interested in
rugby, used to look after us.
At this time kicking to touch was allowed from anywhere on the field. As a
result play was a lot less open. The peel had become fashionable. Forwards,
the donkeys, were beginning to be expected to do more than jump at a
line-out and shove at a scrum. At Dursley, tactics were mentioned and ploys
thought up even though we were not well equipped to bring them off. We were
true amateurs, teachers, scientists, farmers, men for whom rugby was a
relaxation to be played on Saturday afternoons and it was not taken very
seriously.
All this came back to me last week when I spoke to John Darlaston, the
secretary of Dursley, to find out what preparations had been made for the
new season and how it had begun.
'The big change lately has been that we rebuilt our changing rooms and club
room during the summer,' he said. 'We did it using our own labour for little
more than Pounds 20,000. We get sponsored to the tune of Pounds 6,000 or
Pounds 7,000 each year and we need to have somewhere to entertain them.'
Sponsors were unheard of in my day and the only entertaining that went on
was when Fred Wilcox told his agricultural jokes.
Dursley run four teams and have about 75 playing members. 'We even managed
to lend the opposition nine players for a fourth team game last season,'
said Darlaston.
Then he said something that really brought home the difference between then
and now: 'Training began in the fourth week of June. We've been at it two
nights a week ever since.' From what I remember, training was fairly
haphazard. Actually, from what I remember training was non existent. Mine
certainly was. I cannot remember ever doing any. Perhaps that is why I did
not play very often.
Wherever you look in rugby, the talk is of leagues. Heineken have just paid
Pounds 2.1m to the Welsh Rugby Union to sponsor the leagues in Wales for
three more years and the leagues in England receive a similar sum from
Courage. League rugby, as opposed to rugby league, is crucial for the
Harlequins and Baths of this world but even at Dursley's level it has
considerable significance.
'We hope to move up from the third division of the Gloucestershire League to
the second division this season,' said Darlaston. 'We almost did it last
year. The top four went up. We finished fifth only because we couldn't
honour our match fixture against Cainscross.'
Bob Dwyer, the coach of Australia, has said he thinks the new ruck and maul
laws are making the game a combination of rugby league and basketball. That
was not a consideration down in Gloucestershire. 'The lads were a bit
shocked when they watched the All Blacks push the South Africans back 40
yards and then not get the put-in at the ensuing scrum,' said Darlaston.
'But they are not so concerned about the law itself. They don't think that
at our level it is going to make much difference.'
Dursley in the third division. Who'd have thought it? They have made an
inauspicious start to this, their 40th season, losing two of their first
three games. It has been difficult for their captain, Sid Smith, who was
injured in pre-season training.
'It is a bit tricky trying to generate some fire in the lads from the touch
line,' said Smith, a hooker turned back-row forward.
Good luck to Dursley, particularly this afternoon when they play Imperial
Tobacco from Bristol in the first round of the Provincial Cup, south west
region 2. I remember my time as a paying and playing member with affection.
Those days long before the breathalyser were happy times - Fred Wilcox's
jokes and all.
