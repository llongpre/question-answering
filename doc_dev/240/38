Tomorrow: US baseball play-offs.
These should have started, but they won't, because of the players' strike
and the owners' cancellation of the season.
Baseball's enlarged, TV-friendly, eight-team play-offs were to have started
tomorrow, but no-one will turn up. Result: for the first time since 1904
there will be no World Series winners - just losers.
Golf: October 6-9: Alfred Dunhill Cup, St Andrews Old Course, Scotland.
An end-of-term feeling hangs over St Andrews for the 16-team tournament that
tries to duplicate the nationalist enthusiasm of the Ryder Cup. The cast
keeps changing but Fred Couples, Curtis Strange and Tom Kite are due to play
for the US, the defending champions.
Rugby league: October 5: Leeds vs Australia; October 8: Wigan vs Australia.
Australia, the most muscular operators in the tiny pond of international
rugby league, have arrived in Britain.
Their hosts have arranged the itinerary so that their best players meet the
Kangaroos often and early, softening-up the tourists.
This week Australia play Leeds, whose player-coach Ellery Hanley is the new
Great Britain coach, then Wigan, the world club champions.
Soccer: October 8: European championships: Estonia vs Italy, France vs
Romania, Armenia vs Cyprus. October 9: Latvia vs Portugal, Croatia vs
Lithuania.
Italy were brought down to earth after losing the World Cup final when
drawing with Slovenia in their first European championship qualifier.
They continue their tour of eastern Europe with a visit to Estonia where
their chief adversary will be their old fear of failure. But Italy can
benefit from the knowledge that they cannot top France's collapse in the
World Cup qualifiers in Paris last year.
France lost their last two home games - the second to Bulgaria by two late
goals - to surrender a place in the finals. Eric Cantona (above), now
France's captain, blamed Parisian fans. France play Saturday's game in St
Etienne, where they face erratic Romania, World Cup quarter-finalists, and
the ghosts of recent Balkan humiliations.
Rugby union: October 8: South Africa vs Argentina. Kitch Christie, the
unorthodox new South African coach, makes his debut, shaking-up the back
division and, perhaps, South Africa's traditional approach.
