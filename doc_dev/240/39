THE All Blacks open their 13-match tour this afternoon at a sold-out
Twickenham against the London and South-East Division. They are,
justifiably, worth their No. 1 status in the world, having disposed of the
British Isles, Western Samoa and Australia earlier in the year.
They will find the London side playing an expansive game which will suit the
likes of Will Carling, Damian Hopley, Chris Oti and Tony Underwood, but it
could stretch Huw Davies' abilities at full-back.
The All Blacks will play it tight, as they have done for the past 100 years.
Theirs is a game predicated on crossing the gain line as close to as many
forwards as possible. It can, therefore, be mind-numbingly boring to watch,
but it is ruthlessly effective.
Only Australia, over the past five years, has managed to beat them, and beat
them well - something they find quite alien. True, South Africa has the best
record against them at international level (23-17), but not in the recent
past and not since neutral referees were introduced.
Australia's success has come from matching the fire and fury of the All
Black forwards, and actually being superior technically in the front and
second rows. This, understandably, has sent shock waves through the New
Zealand community.
But, as well as settling for equality up front, the Wallabies have had a
dominance at half-back, centre and, when Campese is on song, out in the
darkest recesses of the three-quarters.
Will London show us the tactical nous to beat the All Blacks? I doubt it.
While much bar-room talk has been centred on Jeff Probyn's reinstatement in
the front-row, the game will not be won there (besides which, as far as
England is concerned, Vicar Ubogu is now a more complete player). It will be
won by the middle five: that is, the back rows and the half-backs. In these
positions, the All Blacks have the edge.
Of New Zealand's new boys, former All Black fly-half Wayne Smith says: 'Marc
Ellis is outstanding. Perhaps his versatility is a problem but he has
immense potential.' We shall have to wait until mid-week to see him,
however, as Steve Bachop is preferred today at first five-eighth (the New
Zealand term for fly-half; the inside centre is the second five-eighth).
Without Grant Fox, the All Blacks have the potential to play a wider game;
but if they lose their confidence, and if a kicker of goals does not emerge,
they will move inside centre Lee Stensness to fly-half in the Tests. Laurie
Mains, the coach, is a dour man who fears failure.
The tour itinerary leaves some questions unanswered. Why was the Lions tour
to New Zealand 'so murderous' (to quote former All Black captain David
Kirk)? How come the Rugby Football Union has ageed to play five matches in
England without the sixth being the Test match?
Instead, the All Blacks will head north to play three matches against
various Scottish sides before meeting Scotland. That means eight games
before a Test; for England, it will be 10 games before their international.
The authorities are being extraordinarily generous to their visitors.
The answer must be the workings of the four home unions and their tour
committee. With players grumbling already about the demands on them this
season, it does make some kind of sense to move the international season to
April and play it over four successive weekends on both Saturday and Sunday.
(In New Zealand, the provincial championship does just this).
This must be on the minds of sport executives at the BBC, ITV and Sky, the
three companies pitching for the television rights to rugby for 1994 and
beyond. Indeed, Geoff Cooke, the England manager, earlier this month called
the Five Nations championship too incestuous and suggested including Romania
and Canada).
If rugby is to become global, then some of its tradition must be re-shaped;
after all, the Derby is to move to a Saturday. The Five Nations should
become the Ten Nations and embrace America, Italy, Romania, Canada and Spain
in two leagues, with promotion and relegation. This would truly benefit
northern hemisphere rugby.
In essence, the problem for England is that it has become too successful. It
does not need the protection of the four home unions. It could have its own
more lucrative television contract. It could certainly demand that, in
future, it plays three Tests on tours against South Africa, Australia or New
Zealand - something the present understanding prevents it from doing.
By default, the existing set-up favours the incoming tourists. How typically
British.
