SO YOU know your rugby union and your rugby league? You know all about the
schism of 1895. You can distinguish between the six-tackle rule and the
turnover law, a play-the ball and a penalty. You would not mistake Martin
Offiah for Andrew Harriman or Shaun Edwards for Dewi Morris. Most of all,
you realise that this afternoon both codes will be on display in London.
At Twickenham, headquarters of rugby union, Harlequins play Leicester in the
Pilkington Cup final and hope to do better than they did last year when they
lost in the last minute of extra time to Bath. A few miles north, Wembley
will resound to cheers of support for Wigan and Widnes as they compete for
rugby league's Silk Cut Challenge cup final.
Union and league, amateur and professional, 15-a-side and 13-a-side; the
shape of the ball is the same but in other aspects rugby union and rugby
league are, to paraphrase Winston Churchill's remark about Britain and the
US, two codes divided by the same game.
Rugby union is amateur, a game played by men who have other jobs. Rugby
league is professional, a game for which men are paid to play. That is
correct, is it not? Up to a point, but consider the following apparent
contradictions.
Bath, Llanelli, Leicester and Northampton and Gloucester rugby union clubs
probably turn over more money in a season than most league clubs.
Rugby league has one current star who can describe himself as a millionaire:
Ellery Hanley. Rugby union has two. David Campese has claimed he became
rugby union's first millionare three years ago. It is said he has been
joined by Will Carling, captain of England.
It is fashionable for rugby union officials (known, for a reason that has
never been quite clear to me, as alickadoos) to belittle rugby league. This
attitude is misplaced because, if anything, union has copied far more from
league these past years than vice versa.
In union these days it is commonplace to hear talk of a big hit, meaning a
fierce tackle such as that by Mickey Skinner on Marc Cecillon in the
semi-final of the World Cup. These big hits have come from rugby league and
are a direct result of the extra emphasis now being placed on upper-body
strength.
Australian rugby league players started the trend more than 10 years years
ago when they began to work with weights to develop their upper-body
strength. Previously they had concentrated on building up the torso and
legs.
When the Kangaroos (the Australian rugby league team) reaped the benefits,
the Wallabies (the Australian rugby union team) sat up and noticed what
their countrymen were achieving and added serious weight training to their
schedules. Since the 1987 World Cup, weights have become as much a part of
union jargon as drop outs, the 22 and the line-outs.
The scrum has never played a significant part in league. These days, it is
being downgraded in rugby union, too, as are rucking and mauling. These days
scrum-halves in rugby union put the ball in to the second row of their
scrums as a matter of course - as they have done for years in league. A
strike against the head is a rarity these days, like a try by a prop
forward. I have seen more than 40 games this season and from all the
hundreds of scrums in those games only once have I seen a scrum-half
penalised for a crooked put in.
That is not all: at the World Cup sevens in Edinburgh there were often more
players offside than onside; men standing almost on top of their opposite
numbers. This is beginning to happen in 15-a-side, too, and is another trend
that has spread from rugby league. So has the elaborate sign language
referees now use to explain why they blew their whistle - not to mention the
trend of miking referees for television.
If you think the lines between the two codes are clearly drawn then try
answering these questions: which clubs routinely draw 6,000-8,000 spectators
to a home game? Wigan do and so do Leeds, both of which are league clubs.
But, significantly, so do Llanelli, who have been so startlingly good in
Wales this season. There were 10,000 at Stradey Park on Wednesday night to
watch Llanelli clinch the league title. Bath would attract more spectators
if their ground was bigger. As it is, the capacity of 8,000 is reached at
almost every home game.
Which code offers its star players cars, houses, jobs, petrol money? Again,
the obvious guess is league, but increasingly the answer is union. There has
been a sea-change in the attitude to money and the like in rugby union, and
a new job, a sponsored car, help with a mortgage and money are commonplace
in the supposedly amateur code.
I think the two codes are closer together than ever. If I could not go to
Twickenham then I would climb on the Tube and head for Wembley.
Twickenham offers a confrontation between two outstanding flankers, Neil
Back of Leicester and Peter Winterbottom. At Wembley there is the chance to
see Jonathan Davies, arguably the most complete footballer of his time,
dazzling Wigan's all-star team and perhaps sparking an upset victory for
Widnes.
Frankly, I wish I could watch both matches live.
