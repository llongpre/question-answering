SOUTH Africa's athletes are home after a less than triumphant return to the
Olympic Games following an absence of 32 years. Forty-second in the medal
table, with only two silvers, is not the sort of performance to satisfy such
a sports-mad country. .
Today, however, the countlry's rugby players have an opportunity to make
amends when the Springboks - as they are sure to remain known, despite the
efforts of politicians to kill the 'apartheid' designation - meet New
Zealand's All Blacks at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.
It is South Africa's first official rugby Test since they drubbed a weak
English side in 1984, and the first meeting between the two countries since
the protest-wracked 1981 tour of New Zealand by the Springboks.
In terms of national pride, there is a lot at stake for white South Africans
 -relatively few blacks play the game - over the next week. In keeping with
South Africa's generally somewhat breathless return to world sport, the
Springboks are also due to face Australia's world-champion Wallabies in Cape
Town next Saturday.
It is a schedule that ranks with the country's return to international
cricket last year when, with less than a month's notice, the South Africans
travelled to India to play three one-day internationals. They were
outclassed in the first two but won the third handsomely.
A similar pattern for the rugby players would not be unexpected. For a team
that has been out of international rugby for eight years, and which has
never played together, to take on two such powerful and settled combinations
is extraordinarily ambitious, if not foolish.
There is also the matter of rules. South Africans worry that isolation has
bred bad habits - particularly, lifting in the line-outs - which neutral
referees will penalise heavily. Indeed, the Australian official who will
handle today's match has indicated that he will crack down on illegal
line-out tactics.
There are, therefore, alibis in abundance should the national ego take a
pounding over the next week. Even so, Springbok supporters are pinning their
hopes of victory on two factors: home advantage and 34-year-old Naas Botha.
The Springboks can, of course, be beaten at home - the formidable 1974
British Lions proved that - but it is never easy. Botha, however, is
something else.
Almost certainly, the fair-haired fly-half and captain is the most
controversial rugby player South Africa has produced. He made his debut for
Northern Transvaal in 1977, aged 19, and has dominated South African rugby
ever since, apart from a brief period in American football in 1983 as a
kicker for the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots. His involvement in
professional sport caused fierce debate when he was then cleared to resume
his career in the 'amateur' rugby code.
Botha enjoys celebrity status in the Afrikaans media, which dwells lavishly
on his every move. But, despite his phenomenal talents, many rugby followers
outside the Transvaal accord him only grudging respect.
His precocious debut, and later captaincy of Northern Transvaal when they
were near-invincible late in the 1970s and early '80s, won him adulation in
Pretoria but enemies elsewhere.
Much of this was jealousy: rivals resented his match-winning qualities. They
attacked his style of play, criticising him for kicking the game to death
and never tackling. His quick temper did not help: his frequent involvement
in niggling off-the-ball incidents created an image as a poor sportsman.
Botha is certainly no angel, but it is unfortunate that his on-field gifts
have sometimes been obscured by his personality and private life. His
drop-kicking and punting abilities are legendary - testimony to superb
balance and timing - and his tactical sense impeccable.
He also has a well defined instinct of self-preservation. It is likely that
Michael Jones, the speedy All Black flanker, will have the task this
afternoon of trying to stop Botha. If he does not succeed, he can reflect
that other distinguished players, like Ireland's Fergus Slattery and
Jean-Pierre Rives of France, have failed before him.
Today's game and next Saturday's against Australia will be shown live on
ITV.
