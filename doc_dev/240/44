RUGBY UNION: England v Romania, November 12, Twickenham
There have been two talking points in rugby union over the last week. The
first was England's new manager and coach, Jack Rowell (see People Page),
backing down over his demand that his squad of players should not turn out
for their clubs on the Saturday before international matches. The second was
the oh-so-sharp pen of former England stand-off Stuart Barnes. Comments in
Barnes' recently-published autobiography led to England hooker Brian Moore
starting libel proceeding, and accepting a Pounds 4,000 out-of-court
settlement. Then, in his Daily Telegraph column, Barnes caused a furore by
claiming that England captain Will Carling was not pulling his weight at
Harlequins and should be replaced by Philip de Glanville in the England
side. Supporters are waiting to see how Carling responds in the first of six
matches that England play before next year's World Cup in South Africa.
MOTOR RACING: Australian Grand Prix, November 13, Adelaide.
One race left and one point in it. Damon Hill's win in yesterday's
rain-soaked, crash-riddled Japanese Grand Prix means that the 34-year-old
Londoner goes to Australia trailing Germany's Michael Schumacher by the
narrowest of margins in the race for the championship. Schumacher is still
considered to be the best driver around. But so was Jim Clark when Damon's
father beat him for the world crown.
