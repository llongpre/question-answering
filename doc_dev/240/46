IN SPITE of appearances to the contrary, Twickenham was not full for
Tuesday's Varsity match. One seat was left empty when the ticket-holder, who
gets vertigo, discovered the height of the west stand's upper tier. She
retired to the car park and listened on the radio.
Perhaps she was the lucky one. The rest of us had to endure one of the
poorest Varsity matches since the mid-1960s - as poor, incidentally, as the
scratchy recording of the national anthem that was played before the start.
The Varsity match merits more than a worn recording. Why not a a band?
My main complaint centres not on the standard of play but the style, which
was a direct result of the new laws - especially, the turnover law. I left
my (Oxford) seat with a deep sense of disappointment.
The first I saw of the new laws was at Aberavon on a sunny afternoon last
September when Cardiff were the visitors. The home club had printed a list
of the changes as explained by Clive Norling, the referee. There were more
than 20 of them.
Cardiff won comfortably enough but Aberavon once caught their opponents
napping with a quickly-taken throw-in that almost resulted in a try. The
opportunism this law change was meant to encourage was evident.
Since then, I have seen one game each Saturday and a few in midweek as well.
It is clear that most of the changes are working well. The experimental
line-out variation, which says the catcher must use both hands or his inside
arm to grab the ball, is sensible: it stops players levering themselves up
on rivals' shoulders. I am glad, too, that the scrum-half can no longer dart
away from a scrum in a dummy move.
On the other hand, the turnover law has not worked at all well. It says: 'In
a maul when the ball becomes unplayable, the team not in possession at the
start of the maul will put the ball in to the ensuing scrummage.' It quickly
became known as the 'use it or lose it' law and, in principle, it seemed
sensible. Its aim was to encourage teams to ruck or maul the ball back more
quickly, so that play would be more dynamic.
In drafting this law, the International Board were accepting the perceived
wisdom that there is a New Age of rugby. The game is undergoing a
renaissance in style and popularity now that it has become a running,
handling affair in which forwards run like backs and backs tackle like
forwards.
Rugby is growing in popularity, for players and spectators, in a way it has
not done since, nearly 30 years ago, kicking to touch was banned from
outside your own 22.
Yet, on the evidence of this season in Europe, the turnover law has done the
opposite of what was intended. Teams get into their opponents' territory and
kick the ball high in the air as an attacking ploy, rather than run at them
and risk conceding the put-in at a scrum.
Furthermore, it encourages the defending side's back row to stand off at
rucks so they are ready to move around the field and end attacks. This means
that games become stop-start. In those I have watched this season, not one
has contained sustained attacking rugby.
The greatest try I have seen was scored by the Lions in South Africa in
1980. The ball went through 32 pairs of hands and the movement lasted 96
seconds before Mike Slemen, the wing, touched down.
Under the present turnover law, it would not have happened. The referee
would have blown up at the first ruck, after 14 seconds, and given a scrum
to the home side.
Bob Dwyer, the Australian coach, hates the turnover law because it is
stifling initiative. Lyn Evans, the Oxford coach, said after Tuesday's loss:
'The game has less shape and pattern to it now.' It was not sour grapes.
Tony Rodgers, the long-time coach of Cambridge, agrees. 'Players are
stacking up in midfield. No wonder you can't get attacking moves going. You
have got to suck in the forwards, make them do their jobs of winning the
ball.'
Grappling for the ball in a maul, or getting it back with the feet in a
ruck, are legitimate skills of the game. Sadly, they have been devalued by
the turnover law, which encourages opponents to kill the ball because they
know they will get the put-in at the ensuing scrum. Thus, rugby is becoming
more defensive at a time when it is trying hard to do the opposite.
Fortunately, the turnover law is not written in stone; it is an experiment.
The IB will review it in the spring. My advice is succinct: scrap it and go
back to the old law.
