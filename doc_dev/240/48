DOWN THE years there have been good England rugby teams and less good ones.
England's team in the current Five Nations' Championship is the best ever.
They proved that in the second half against Scotland and throughout the
memorable game against Ireland in which they scored six tries. Their
performance at Twickenham two weeks ago was remarkable because Ireland won
50 per cent of the possession and had the put-in at 15 of the game's 21
scrums. The mind boggles at what England might have done with more
possession.
If Will Carling's team beat France in Paris this afternoon, as they should,
and go on and win the Grand Slam, as they should, they will have proved
themselves the best European team in the international championships for at
least 30 years.
How they have done this is instructive. They have based their methods on
those of a successful club. A squad system was introduced and a team
manager, Geoff Cooke, appointed. Cooke has brought stability and consistency
to team selection. They were not always present before.
Cooke has also introduced mental training techniques. When he gave tapes for
mental rehearsal to Paul Rendall and Jeff Probyn, England's props, he
received a dusty answer. He did not give up however. Prior to the Irish game
he asked every player to write down six reasons why they wanted to play for
England and six reasons that motivated them to their best performances. Even
a seemingly simple exercise such as this had a benefit: it helped the
players concentrate their minds on the task in hand.
The most significant reason for England's surge forward is their dedication
to fitness. England's players are fitter than ever and whether or not they
bring home the bacon in the form of the grand slam this season, this
achievement can not be taken away from them. They are 25 per cent fitter
than Wales's, believes Alan Davies, Wales's coach, and much fitter than
Ireland's, too.
England tried to improve their fitness as long ago as the mid-1970s. It did
not work then any more than did the practice of having the selectors in
track suits on the pitch at training sessions, not to mention Larry Lamb,
the referee, Don Rutherford, a doctor and a physiotherapist and one or two
other well-minded but misguided England camp followers.
'I was told I had to run six miles in 48 minutes and be able to do ten 150
yard sprints each in 18 seconds,' recalls one England international of that
vintage. 'What use was that to me? It would not increase my speed over 30
yards and that was what I needed, explosive speed not stamina. Anyway the
senior players put an end to it. We were supposed to be tested at Aldershot
and only the scrum-halves and a couple of other backs turned up. The senior
players all refused.'
In 1986, McNab returned to work with the England squad and his principles
are now followed. A number of England players recently achieved oxygen
uptake figures measuring the capacity of the heart and lungs that would have
been respectable for highly-trained athletes. Although their weight and body
size have increased, body fat has diminished, in some cases to proportions
almost as low as marathon runners. England's rugby players are not just
mean, they're lean, too.
Rugby throws up famous players in groups of two or three: Mesnel and Sella
currently representing France, for example; Price, Windsor and Faulkner, the
Pontypool Front Row, for Wales in the 1970s; Marques and Currie, the England
locks of nearly 40 years ago.
A considerable part of England's current success is due to the centre
partnership of Carling and Guscott. Concentrate on one and the other is
away. They are fast in attack and strong in defence and two better centres
have not played together for England.
They are the heart of a potent three-quarter line. As other countries have
found to their cost, concentrate on Guscott and Carling and England wings
Halliday and Underwood, will go on a spree and, if they do not then Webb
will, as he did two weeks ago. As he surveyed the wreckage of his Irish team
at Twickenham Ciaran Fitzgerald observed: 'England's back division had
everything you could ask for - speed,teamwork and strength. They had a great
ability to penetrate, not with one single player but in numbers.'
There have been two mould-breaking British teams in the past 21 years. The
first was the 1971 British Lions, the first Lions to win a series in New
Zealand, and the second was the 1974 British Lions, who went unbeaten
through a Test series in South Africa. This current England team should be
regarded as mould breakers, too.
