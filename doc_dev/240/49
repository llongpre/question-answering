Rugby League. October 22, Great Britain v Australia, first John Smith's
Test, Wembley.
It was a shock, in 1982, when the fitness and technical ability of
Australia's touring side took British rugby league by surprise. This year
their style of play has been a shock too, for the Kangaroos' machine-like
qualities - grinding down opposition attacks and ruthlessly punishing
mistakes - have played second fiddle to fluent attacking rugby. So far they
have moved the ball so often and at such speed that, despite an
uncharacteristic number of handling errors, they have swept aside the
strongest club sides in Britain. The question is: will they continue this
swashbuckling approach at Wembley or revert to error-free football. Great
Britain, who proved their strength last
year with victory over New Zealand, have brought in Wigan's Shaun Edwards as
captain - a blow for Garry Schofield of Leeds who lost the job just two
Tests short
of equalling Mick Sullivan's
record of 46 appearances for his country.
Football. Uefa Cup, October 18, Trabzonspor v Aston Villa. European Cup,
October 19, Manchester United v Barcelona. European Cup Winners' Cup,
October 20, Brondby v Arsenal and Chelsea v Austria Vienna.
Johan Cruyff threatens 'all-out attack' by Barcelona when they visit
Manchester United in the European Champions' League. In truth they have
little choice: Barcelona, initially the bookmakers' favourites to win
United's qualifying group, surprisingly lost their previous game to
Gothenburg and now lie third in the table. As for United, manager Alex
Ferguson is not taking the threat lightly. 'Their names, that's the mental
thing we've got to conquer,' he says. 'We've all got a thing about names.
Romario, Stoichkov, Hagi - you are more frightened of the names than what
they actually do.'
In the Cup Winners' Cup, Arsenal are away to Brondby, of Denmark, while
Chelsea are at home to FK Austria Vienna. Arsenal swapped home and away
dates to avoid their fans travelling to Europe at the same time and on
almost an identical route to Chelsea's.
After their memorable victory over holders Internazionale Milan in the last
round of the Uefa Cup, Aston Villa travel to Trabzonspor of Turkey.
Boxing. October 23, WBO heavyweight title, Herbie Hide v Tommy Morrison; WBO
middleweight title, Steve Collins v Lonny Besley; IBF lightweight title,
Rafael Ruelas v Billy Schwer; non-title fight, Frank Bruno v Ray Mercer.
Hong Kong.
When Oliver McCall took Lennox Lewis's WBC world title last month, McCall's
promoter, Don King, once again gained virtual control of the profitable
world heavyweight title business. King's first move against the Lewis camp
was to announce that McCall may defend his crown against Lewis's old British
rival, Frank Bruno. It would be Bruno's fourth attempt at winning a world
crown. But he must first beat Ray Mercer, who once stopped Tommy Morrison,
the challenger for Herbie Hide's WBO title on the same Hong Kong bill.
