Rugby league has overshadowed union this week, with the British Lions
beating the Kangaroos in the first of three tests.
At Wembley last Saturday, the English rugby league team, with one notable
exception, beat the Australian rugby league side 8-4.
The notable exception was the match winner, a Welshman, not any Welshman,
but former union hero Jonathan Davies.
His try just on half time came when Great Britain had been reduced from 13
to 12 men after their captain, Shaun Edwards was sent off for a tackle so
high and so dangerous that Edwards was lucky the referee did not award a
penalty try. Had he done so, the match - and almost certainly the series -
would have been lost.
Frequently in team sports, victory is not decided by the strategy of a
brilliant coach or his equally brilliant players but by the split second
action of an individual. Edwards' stupidity nearly cost his side the game.
Nearly.
Davies, at full back, and entering the line at the edge of the field, took
the ball on half way, sold an old-fashioned rugby union fly-half's dummy
and, because a league defence lacks the cover of the 15 a-side game, had
only one defender, the fullback, Brett Mullins, to take on.
Ten metres out Davies thought he would be caught and looked for support but
it had evaporated - testimony to his pace.
Davies made a split-second decision. He realised he had to find overdrive, a
gear everyone else thought he had been in for the past 40m.
'Try' went up the cry and even members of the press stood to give Davies a
standing ovation. The euphoria that swept Wembley could be smelt for minutes
afterwards.
Great Britain's win ensures full houses at Old Trafford and Leeds. But while
the game may never have been in better spirits on the field, all is not well
off it. Next year, Britain hosts the world championships. There is still no
title sponsor nor for that matter any sponsor of any description.
Rugby league does not want another competition sponsored either by
cigarettes (hooray) or alcohol. It wants to occupy the territory currently
occupied by its arch rival, union.
There is very little chance of that.
Meanwhile, in Cardiff, rugby union finally kick-started its international
season, (the Romania v Wales and Wales v Italy World Cup play-off games had
been a side show). In a dismal game, Cardiff succumbed to a very ordinary
South African side, now to be known, after some hesitation by the ANC
government, by their old name, the Springboks.
The four home unions are gunning for South Africa. This is because they
cannot face the future.
In the southern hemisphere the game has gone 'open'. Players are being paid,
in one form or another, contrary, it is true, to the spirit of the current
laws.
The game's base has moved since 1985, when the International Rugby Football
Board made its momentous decisions to hold the world cup and to hold it in
Australia and New Zealand.
In Australasia they knew the world of sport better. They had seen the
devastating effects of the Packer circus on cricket. What has happened? New
Zealand won the first world cup in 1987; Australia the second in 1991. In
1995, New Zealand, France, Australia and South Africa look the four most
likely semi-finalists.
France is the one leading northern country not eager to confront South
Africa over payments. This is because Jacques Fouroux, France's former
captain and coach, has said he is organising a professional circus, to take
place after the third world cup next year.
Fouroux has only four fixtures agreed but he does have television and
sponsorship deals in place. Hardly surprisingly, the games will be played in
South Africa. The only complication is that he has no players.
The home unions have lost the arguments. As Vernon Pugh, chairman of the
International Rugby Football Board, put it: 'The IRFB has been 10 years
behind the game. This has to change'.
As it is, the professional code is infinitely better as a spectator sport.
The game is harder and faster. It is simpler to comprehend. Every player
needs to be able to give and take a pass. The trick for each side, on the
surface a simple one, is how to break down one line of defence.
Quite the best thing that has happened to the laws is that the opposing side
must retire 10 metres rather than five after a tackle. It is this that has
added an extra dimension to the tactical part of the game.
The Australians use a huge variety of ploys. They are masters at running off
the ball. They do it at such speed and with such intelligence that I would
not hesitate to conclude, with two more tests yet to come, that these
professionals are the finest collection of athletes I have seen in this
country.
At the bi-annual IRFB meeting in Vancouver 10 days ago, the world's
governing body refused to make a decision on Pugh's report on the opening up
of the game.
'As I see it, what the Australian Rugby Union already has in situ, is what
we need to adopt throughout the world. No payment at club level; appearance
money for games played at provincial level and for our best players to be
salaried,' he said.
Going properly 'open' would of course mean that rugby union and rugby league
players could play either code at international level.
Union might try, each season, to contract every potential international
player to stop them playing the other code. But, even if this was legal and
I doubt that it would be, players would be able to move between the two
codes.
