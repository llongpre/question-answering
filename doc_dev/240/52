THE Twickenham rugby test match between South Africa and England on November
14 looks likely to go ahead despite the withdrawal of support for all rugby
tours by the National and Olympic Sports Congress (NOSC), South Africa's
most powerful sporting body.
Mr Steve Tshwete, African National Congress spokesman on sport, said the ANC
had pledged its support for the match and would honour this pledge. He said,
however, that future tours, and the 1995 rugby World Cup, which South Africa
is supposed to host, were at risk.
This week's statement by Mr Mluleki George, president of NOSC, has refocused
attention on the use of sporting boycotts as a political weapon following
the gradual lifting over the past year of the sports moratorium.
Mr George was essentially repeating a point he made in April when he sought
to have the August visit to South Africa by the New Zealand All Blacks
cancelled: namely that the country's rugby authorities pay insufficient
attention to developing the sport, preferring to focus on international
tours.
Mr George's frustration relates to a perception that the South African Rugby
Football Union (SARFU), and rugby supporters in general, have been less than
enthusiastic in embracing the new South Africa. In stark contrast to the
nimble diplomacy practised by leading cricket administrators, rugby
authorities have made little effort to hide their distaste for the ANC's
considerable sporting influence.
Tempting though it may be, however, to try to punish conservative whites by
seeking rugby's isolation, this route is not without problems. Some question
how Mr George can justify such a step when his grievance is more a matter of
style than substance.
For although rugby probably deserves its reactionary image, it has met the
two prerequisites set down for a return to international competition: unity
of administrative structures, and a development programme. On the latter
front, R6m (about Pounds 1.3m) has recently been paid into a development
fund.
Since few blacks play rugby, few are likely to be concerned either way about
Mr George's strictures. Whites are likely to have mixed feelings. Many will
be resentful at the efforts to politically cleanse sport, though there would
probably also be widespread support for the introduction of a younger, more
progressive group of administrators to run the sport.
