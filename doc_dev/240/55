Rowell stepped down from the board in order to transfer his winning streak
to England's rugby team

Karine - is that how you pronounce it? Lovely name,' Jack Rowell said to the
waitress. He is a man who knows a bit about motivation. Needless to say,
service at lunch was excellent.
Last night, Rowell got together with a more robust cast of characters: the
21 members of the England rugby union squad. Their first international game
with Rowell as manager and coach is against Romania on Saturday. Only 15
will take to the Twickenham pitch, selected and motivated in Rowell's
inimitable style.
Charm, inspiration, pugnacity and fear are a few of the words that pepper
comments about this very tall and imposing man from colleagues both on the
rugby pitch and around the boardroom table.
In business, his reward for saving Golden Wonder Crisps carried him to the
board of Dalgety. The snack foods manufacturer, bought from Hanson in 1986,
was 'run down', according to Dalgety, which put in Rowell as chief
executive. In sport, success in making Bath the best British - perhaps
European - club team has landed him the England job.
'Business and sport have been mutually dependent for me,' Rowell says.
'Winning at sport gives you a lot of confidence that rubs off in business,
but sport also washes the mind of pressures so you come back to business
refreshed.'
Business had come first and rugby was a hobby. But Rowell has reversed his
priorities for England. He has stepped down at Dalgety to work on projects
he can fit around rugby, and picked up a couple of non-executive
directorships to keep his hand in.
'My wife Susan said to me: 'After the Alpine peaks of (club) rugby, you have
to try the Himalayas'.' Fifty-eight last Tuesday, he looks to this as 'the
pinnacle of my rugby career'.
Rowell's arrival as manager was less dramatic than his arrival at Golden
Wonder. Dalgety was struggling to make good its acquisition and worse, the
factory burnt down shortly after he joined. 'The company literally rose from
the ashes,' says one analyst.
Taking on England presents different challenges as the team prepares for
next year's World Cup in South Africa. 'We have to develop a more flexible
way of scoring tries,' says Rowell.
His appointment as manager last spring was greeted warmly because of his
team-building skills and deep knowledge and love of the game. Some former
players, though, have wondered out loud whether his use of fear and love of
making players compete for places on the pitch would work among the egos at
international level.
Two small squalls have blown up already: one was with the coach Dick Best
who, after this summer's tour of South Africa, was relieved of his job which
Rowell took on additionally; he also tried to insist that his squad members
be excused their club games last Saturday to leave them fresher for the
international. He backed down but nobody believes he will drop it.
'He's won most times,' says Maurice Warren, Dalgety's chairman and a veteran
of such encounters after 15 years as Rowell's boss. Rowell is one of the
most inspirational and effective managers he has met, and a delight to work
with. But he is very obstinate and often unforthcoming, says Warren.
'It's very difficult to get to the bottom of what he's thinking, what he's
planning. It is also hard to get him to understand when changes are
required,' says Warren.
'I had to pick my moments to have my rows with him. The best way was to sit
him down at a hotel or other public place.' Having lots of passers-by helped
restrain Rowell.
A rumbustious personality was evident from the outset of his career when he
arrived as a trainee accountant at a Middlesbrough practice in the 1960s.
'His riotous sense of humour and keen intellect enlivened the place,' says
John Precious, then a fellow trainee, now chairman of Celsis International,
the biotech company Rowell recently joined as a non-executive.
Working later for Procter &amp; Gamble in the north-east, Rowell resumed a rugby
career cut short at Oxford University by a serious injury. He played for
Gosforth, then took over as coach. 'I learnt more about managing than ever
before. I had to be a credible leader of England players on the team.'
A job change took him to Bristol - and Bath's rugby club was conveniently
close by. Both endeavours draw on common ingredients for success, he says:
physical and mental fitness, skills and team building. He looks for people
who are 'competitive, sparky, self-motivated individuals'. He believes in
giving the individual the confidence and tools 'to exercise their skills and
judgment in the heat of battle'.
The personal touch is key to Rowell's technique. In the changing room before
a match he is known for going to each player in turn - praising,
brow-beating, encouraging or cajoling as he sees fit. Performance is
everything, but if a player is dropped from the team, Rowell will work with
him to rebuild his confidence.
He sets 'stretch targets', believing that people can constantly give 15 per
cent more effort than they think possible. 'For human nature reasons, you
also need internal competition. I'm a great believer in peer pressure and
approval, but in an open environment where people can say you're letting the
team down.' Above all, there is the will to win. 'Business generally
neglects the psychology of winning.'
A flash of temper is among his tricks, too. 'Sometimes you have to be
bloody-minded to sort things out. It releases your own tension and helps you
make your point.'
Once his team takes to the field, he lets them get on with the job. During
matches at Bath he was known for pacing around the ground, always watching,
always analysing. Twickenham's soaring stands may constrain his style. But
every England player on the pitch will live in hope or fear of Rowell's
praise or criticism.
