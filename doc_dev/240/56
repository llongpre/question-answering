the cynics and the sporting heroes of 1992

THE SPORTING year was dominated by Juan Antonio Samaranch's little joke. In
1992 he took the Olympics to his home town, Barcelona, in the high summer
weeks known locally as the canicula - the dog days. These are the hottest
and most humid time of the year. In 1992 they were hotter and more humid
than normal, the worst weather for athletes, the vast bulk staying in the
unairconditioned Olympic village. It was merely uncomfortable for everyone
else.
Yet everybody left praising the event. This was largely because of the
hosts' efforts. They missed no detail and spared no expense. But the
crowning moment of Samaranch's Olympic presidency has left his home city,
his home region and his home country with debts no-one can yet bring
themselves to count.
The run up to the Olympics was dominated by unpleasantness away from the
track about politics, drugs and money. Most worrying were the drug scandals
involving sprinters Katrina Krabbe of Germany and Butch Reynolds of the US
and attendant litigation.
Yet in Barcelona all these nasty odours evaporated. The biggest drugs bust
of the Games, three Britons caught by testing at home before the games, was
largely ignored by the world's press. The only way to catch steroid users is
with expensive and sophisticated out-of-competition testing. This is beyond
the means of most developing nations and beyond the will of some of the
richer ones, notably the US.
Without doubt medals at Barcelona were won by drug cheats. The choice lay
between suspecting everyone and giving competitors the benefit of the doubt.
Trust won the day.
The atmosphere at the games was improved by the hosts astonished pleasure at
their own success. Spain had won four gold medals in all the previous summer
Olympics. In Barcelona it won 13. One of the most memorable was Fermin
Cacho's charge through the field in the 1,500m gold accompanied by the
swelling roar of the 70,000 Montjuich crowd.
The fans in Spain were not simply partisan. They roared every jump by US
athletes Mike Powell and Carl Lewis in the long jump final. Lewis won by
3cm.
Sergey Bubka's fall from the pole vault firmament was greeted with
embarrassed murmuring as the spectators politely pretended they were
watching something else.
Paraskeve Patoulidou surged across the line in a tumble of bodies in the
women's 100m hurdles final and then did a slow, delicious double-take as the
replay showed that she had won. It was the first ever athletics gold by a
Greek woman. Before 1992 white South Africans had claimed all three
athletics medals won by African women. Now there were golds for Hassiba
Boulmerka of Algeria in the 800m and Deratu Tutu of Ethiopia, who beat Elana
Meyer of South Africa in an emotional 10,000m, and bronze for the Nigerians
in the 100m relay.
Quincy Watts and Kevin Young of the US, floated round the track as if borne
by angels as they broke records and won golds in the 400m and 400m hurdles
respectively.
Some were memorable in defeat: Derek Redmond of Great Britain limping round
the track on a torn hamstring, in the 400m heats. Brave 32-year-old Johnny
Gray of the US, went for broke in his last Olympics only to be caught at the
last by William Tanui and Nixon Kiptrotich at the end of an exhilarating
800m final. The warmth and generousity of his post-race press conference
provided a welcome vital sign for the Olympic ideal.
Britain's two triumphs on the track were achieved in overpowering style.
Linford Christie ran away from the field in the men's 100m and Sally Gunnell
did the same in the women's 400m hurdles.
Away from Montjuich, the games were dominated by the Dream Team, a group of
US professional basketball stars who were there for all the wrong reasons,
welcomed in the hope that some of the fame and wealth might rub off on their
rivals. Maybe it will. The Dreams worked as hard at PR as they did on the
court, won the gold at a stroll and allowed two of the games great stars,
Earvin Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, to take final bows of their careers on
the world's largest stage.
The British discovered cycling when Chris Boardman ripped to the 4,000m
pursuit gold medal on his high-tech Lotus bicycle. The cycle was largely the
work of Rudi Thomann, a French engineer: never mind, it still revived
Britain's dimming faith in its technological wizardry.
Technological superiority lay behind Nigel Mansell's Formula 1 world
championship. If Mansell had been with any other team his Williams car,
which possesses far more charisma than him, would probably have won anyway.
Mansell felt unappreciated and plans to race in the US. Frank Williams, the
team proprietor, sent him on his way with the words: 'He thinks he is a
superstar. In fact, he is just a lot richer and a bit quicker than he was
four years ago when he joined us.'
Mansell was one of a trio of dour, awkward, men who dominated British sport
in 1992. The second rather let his mask slip. Nick Faldo burst into tears
after winning his fifth major, the Open at Muirfield. 'I'm just an emotional
little petal,' he said.
The spiritual leader of this threesome is Graham Gooch, patron saint of
Essex men. Gooch led his county to the championship, again, took England to
the World Cup final. Gooch resisted stubbornly against Pakistan's pace pair
of Waqar Younis and Wazim Akram in the tests. But England lost a thrilling
series. Afterwards, Gooch dropped David Gower, hero of the last test and
embodiment of the English sporting ideal of diffident public school boy,
from the party to India. His place is taken by the archetypal pugnacious
state school lad: Mike Gatting.
Gooch knows when to grind and when to unfurl his undoubted flair. The same
could not always be said of England's other two national teams - although
both showed signs of a developing sense adventure. England's rugby union
team added a little flair to the physical grind on their way to another five
nations championship and then dispatched South Africa on their return to
Twickenham.
Meanwhile, Australia beat everyone in the southern hemisphere before popping
over to Ireland and Wales for yet another triumphant tour, entertaining
themselves with with a little sniping at England. They were popular tourists
with everyone except Will Carling, the England captain, and Neath rugby
club, whose allegedly below-the-belt tactics led Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer to
dub it 'the bag-snatching capital of Wales.'
England's increasingly neurotic soccer team trudged to the European
championships where it was the dullest and dourest of a collection of dull
and dour teams. The only sunshine came from Scotland, who had the courage to
play expansive soccer but lacked the nerve to score goals.
The final was a fairy tale of sorts. The Danes late replacements for
Yugoslavia, beat Germany, the world champions in a style more Brothers Grimm
than Hans Christian Andersen. The Germans tried to win with organisation and
work rate, which the Danes had by the bucket load, rather than imagination
and flair. Fittingly, the crucial goal was scored by Danish midfield clogger
John Jensen.
The grand old ladies of soccer, the English Football Association, fooled by
blandishments from 22 soccer chairmen, dropped its petticoats. The unwelcome
offspring was the new Premier League, child of greed. However, if Norwich
City, Blackburn Rovers or Ipswich Town break the long rule of the wealthy
big city teams and win the inaugural title, the whole sordid affair will
have had one good result.
The only beacon of hope in the European soccer year has been the Italian
league. AC Milan demonstrate that you can win playing stylishly and Paul
Gascoigne, who raises the England team above the cynically mundane, is
treated with more care than he could expect in his overworked home league.
With any luck the Italians will buy the Welsh teenage prodigy Ryan Giggs
before he is destroyed by too much overly-physical English soccer.
As the year ended the drug scandals re-emrged. In Reynolds' dispute with
Primo Nebiolo, Nabob of the International Amateur (sic) Athletic Federation,
an Ohio court awarded the runner Dollars 27.3m. Nebiolo refused to contest
the case, arguing that civil courts have no right to rule on its drug
suspensions. He has a point. There are many nations in which the courts
could not be relied on to find against national sporting heroes, regardless
of the merits of the case. But the Ohio court did not object to the
principle that the IAAF should ban athletes, it objected to the high-handed
way Nebiolo had dealt with the case. If 1992 has demonstrated one thing it
is that a spot of purse snatching concentrates administrators' minds. If the
US court forces the IAAF's corporate sponsors to hand over the Dollars
27.3m, the year's last laugh will be against Samaranch's most powerful
courtier, the unappetising Nebiolo.
