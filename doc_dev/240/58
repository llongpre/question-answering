This afternoon at Murrayfield, the old fullback meets the new. The old is
Gavin Hastings, who seems to have been playing for ever. In the past two
years he has lost a yard or two of pace and has become a defensive fullback
still trying hard to play an attacking game.
Hastings will summon all his strength to stop yet another Scottish defeat.
He will try and orchestrate moves that centre on him. He believes he should
lead by example. Hastings, when isolated, kicks the ball in the air in the
forlorn hope that something will come of it.
The new is South African full back Andre Joubert who, by sharp contrast, is
at the top of his form. That makes him the best fullback in the world. He is
a challenging player, versatile, arrogant, pacy, with a basketball player's
handling abilities. He also has that rare instinct for try-scoring.
Opponents have not yet exploited his left-footed kicking or his head-on
tackling. On this tour his confidence has developed so much that it is
difficult to see anyone taking his place.
In the northern hemisphere, the modern fullback dates from 1967. That was
the year when the Australian dispensation law was accepted by everyone. That
law stopped players from kicking directly into touch from outside their own
22-metre line. Fullbacks had to kick less and run more. In the intervening
years the northern hemisphere has produced only a handful of players who
have mastered all aspects of modern play in the position.
In 1967, the Australian side of Ken Catchpole with Phil Hawthorne at
halfback and the big burly, running fullback, Jim Lenehan, beat England
conclusively at Twickenham by 23-11. Lenehan was the first modern full-back
I had seen play. Four years earlier, my father had come home from work to
tell me that the 1963 All Blacks would be training at the Honorary Artillery
Company's ground a stone's throw or two from Liverpool Street station. He
suggested I 'went ill from school' (I was 13 at the time) and travel up with
him.
If I had known the word 'awesome' then, that is how I would have described
the day to my peers in the under-14 rugby team at Westcliff High School. I
watched Don Clarke. I watched him kick goal after goal from absolutely every
position on the park. He appeared to do it with any and every size of
football - most caked in mud. He was totally unfazed.
Clarke was the last of the dinosaur fullbacks. He was there purely for his
ability to kick goals and make last-ditch tackles. His style of kicking was
of the old school. He would place the ball upright and kick it just below
the half-way mark of the seam. His run-up was barely five paces.
Many will feel that JPR Williams, the Welsh fullback, was his equal in the
modern game. He was thought to be one of the great running fullbacks. JPR
was sensational at collecting kicks and running them back at the opposition
(although his kicking out of hand was lamentable). The trouble was that he
found running into the line to make the extra man, to release the mercurial
Gerald Davies or the quick-silver JJ Williams, sometimes difficult to
fathom.
JPR was not alone. Many players who enjoyed some fame at fullback - Dusty
Hare, Hugo MacNeill, Paul Thorburn, Marcus Rose, Gwyn Evans and Peter Dods -
never mastered this art. Three who did were Andy Irvine, Serge Blanco and
someone you have probably not heard much about, Jimmy Waterman, of Oxford
University and Bath.
Irvine had everything: vision, pace, athleticism, nerve, majesty, grace and
tremendous mental strength. He was the first of the complete fullbacks. His
rival at international level was Serge Blanco. Blanco had electrifying speed
when he burst on to the scene in 1982. He also possessed a Corinthian
attitude to the game which became slightly twisted as he grew older and
contemplated giving up cigarettes or the game or both. His demeanour against
the English at Twickenham was often suspect. Yet he was brilliant. The game
misses him.
I played with or against most of these players. Waterman was the best at
judging when to come into the line to make the extra man and the best at
releasing the ball for the wing to gallop over for a try. In the west
country he is an unsung hero. He proved that you do not need searing pace,
you need timing.
Of the current crop of British fullbacks, three stand out: Mike Rayer,
Anthony Clement and Paul Hull. Rayer has Waterman's timing, Clement is a joy
to watch, the complete player; the Welsh are blessed with such a choice.
Paul Hull is the first modern fullback the England team has had. He has
poise and skill. Last weekend, when he played for England against Romania,
his pace and line of attack were too much for the Underwood brothers; an
indication that England must change their wing-threequarters if Hull is to
blossom.
But, the best modern fullback will not be in action today. He is playing at
Elland Road tomorrow afternoon for the Kangaroos against against the Great
Britain rugby league team. He is Brett Mullins. Mullins has JPR's strength,
Blanco's vision, Irvine's flair and Joubert's skills. He is awesome.
