HAVE ANY industries been more closely associated with one sport than cotton,
and wool and coal mining with rugby league? As Geoffrey Moorhouse noted in
At The George, his book of essays about rugby league: 'The industrial
heartland of the north of England was powered by men who worked in the
mills, foundries and pits of the region . . . in time the majority of rugby
clubs in the north drew their playing strength from . . . these places.'
There is therefore, a particular piquancy that at the moment that Britain's
rugby league team has achieved its greatest success by reaching the final of
the World Cup at Wembley this afternoon, 30 pits are being threatened with
closure and British Coal is ending its sponsorship of Great Britain's rugby
league team.
Eighty thousand spectators will be at Wembley to watch Britain play
Australia, the world champions. Great Britain have improved so much recently
that the Australian coach said the current side would beat its predecessors
of four and six years ago by 30 points. Nevertheless, the Australians are
the favourites. They have held the Ashes since 1970 and won the World Cup in
1975, 1977, 1985 and 1988.
'They are the champions. They have beaten us in the past two Test series,'
says Jonathan Devereux, the burly Widnes back who was in Great Britain's
World Cup squad. 'Their record stands for itself and in Allen Langer they
have the outstanding player. If he was in our side then we would be
favourites. He has got everything. He has speed. He can read a game very
well. He has electrifying pace over ten yards, which is what he needs to get
through a gap. He can wrestle the ball clear of his opponents in a way that
is almost uncanny for a small man. He is a good kicker and he is very
tenacious.'
If Langer, a scrum-half, is a potential match winner for Australia, then
Martin Offiah is quite capable of doing the same for Great Britain. Offiah,
whose nickname is Chariots, is the fastest man on the field so long as the
injury he appeared to be carrying last Sunday when he played in the
Lancashire Cup Final has healed. Much will depend on him as it will, too, on
Gary Schofield, Great Britain's captain, playing in the centre, and on the
35-year-old warhorse, Kevin Ward, in the front row.
If Great Britain win, and it is an even money bet that they will, then they
will have demonstrated how much they have learnt from the Australians in the
past ten years.
A decade ago British rugby league hit rock bottom. It was time for change
and officials were dispatched from Britain to sit at the feet of men who had
once been their pupils. They discovered that Australian rugby league was
applying science to the art of football, setting scientifically determined
standards for everything from diet to fitness.
Whereas in Britain many training sessions included unopposed rugby, the
Australians favoured fierce physical contact in practice. This was one
radical change. Another that the British noted was the way the Australians
work with weights to develop their upper bodies. The British, up to then,
had concentrated on building up the torso and legs.
The result was a generation of massive, fast-running men like Mal Meninga,
the Australians' captain who is 6 ft 1 in and weighs 17 st 2lbs. This
afternoon he will face Gary Schofield who is 5 ft 8 in and 12 st 7 lbs.
Schofield is wiser and heavier than he was when he met Meninga in 1984 and
was thrown around like a rag doll, but he is still giving away five inches
and 65 lbs.
The Australians did not stop there. They trained hard so that they could
play the game at a fast pace. Having done all this, they set about shoring
up their defence so that it was well-nigh unbreachable.
'They put so much pressure on you when they have not got the ball that you
start to make mistakes' says Davies, a member of Britain's 1990 Test team.
As the years went by, the Australians refined all these skills, making
themselves more formidable still. One try in the second Test against Great
Britain in 1990 bore out everything they had been trained to do. The ball
was in play for 36 seconds and there were 16 passes before the try-scorer
touched down. No other team could live with such an athletic, skilful
approach.
The advances shown by the Australian rugby league teams were soon noticed by
that country's rugby union authorities as well. That code now produces big
men of great athleticism, trained to a higher level of fitness than ever
before. When these mastodons are teamed with key individuals in the key
positions such as scrum-half, stand-off and full back, then the entire team
whirrs as smoothly as a Swiss watch. The result is that the Wallabies won
the rugby union World Cup last year and there is no sign of their dominance
being ended.
As the Australians were pushing back the frontiers of the game, so in
Britain it was being professionally administered and marketed. In the days
of Eddie Waring commentating on BBC television on a Saturday afternoon,
rugby league was, frankly, a joke.
To my eyes, used to the rhythm of rugby union, rugby league was nothing more
than a series of crash, bang, wallop attacks. Six tackles and then something
had to happen. The game seemed one-paced, physically unambitious, tactically
sterile. 'Oooooop and oooonder' and 'he's taking an early bath' were
Waring's catch phrases.
Now it has become a game of considerable pace and skill - as you should see
this afternoon. It is as different from the rugby league of 20 years ago as
colour is from black and white television and jets are from propeller-driven
aeroplanes.
'Rugby League has remained unusually true to itself' noted Moorhouse, 'an
expression of values as well as a challenge and an entertainment now
embedded deeply in the lives of generations on both sides of the world . . .
But a game can be much more complex than patterns of athletic energy on a
playing field. It can reflect and embody various habits and attitudes that
amount to nothing less than a way of life and this game does.'
Like rugby union, rugby league is a game in its prime.
