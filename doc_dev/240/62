THE rugby was no laughing matter at Murrayfield last Saturday, not even if
you were Scottish and celebrating a handsome 15-3 victory over the Irish in
the opening game of the international championship. What did you think of
it, Fergus Slattery was asked? 'Murrayfield is a lovely stadium,' said the
distinguished former Irish international, deliberately elliptically. 'It was
very windy.'
If Slattery was being polite, then it was in marked contrast to the
newspaper reports of Ireland's 12th successive game without victory in the
championship. 'Miserable Ireland sink to a new low at Murrayfield' ran a
headline in The Sunday Independent. The story beneath said: 'You don't often
sense misery at a major sporting occasion but it was present at Murrayfield
yesterday. You only had to be Irish to feel it. For the ailing team touched
a new low and emerged from a dull match the authors of nothing.'
Mick Doyle, who was Ireland's coach when they won the Triple Crown in 1985
(and when they were whitewashed in the championship the following season)
wrote in the same paper: 'This was the worst ever (display) by an Irish
side.' I have news for him. I have seen worse Irish teams than this but I
have never seen such a limp one. The traditional Irish fire was absent. They
seemed brow-beaten and uncertain of themselves, which are hardly Irish
characteristics.
By Tuesday, feelings had quietened and the remarks of Moss Keane were all
the more welcome for being so honest and low key. 'Our flair for rugby has
been curbed by our obsession to follow every one else,' said Keane, another
former international. 'Doing the unusual, as was our instinct, had a more
unsettling effect on the opposition. Where has the old fashioned footrush
gone? Working on fitness is fine and essential but when you have players
going out to play to a sterile, pre-ordained pattern foreign to their
traditions then you are getting nowhere.'
Rugby is of relatively little importance in the scheme of sports in Ireland,
a comfortable fourth behind Gaelic football, hurling and soccer. Only an
estimated 12,500 play rugby compared with 30 times as many in England, for
example.
'We used to close the gap that existed between us and other countries in
three ways,' said Slattery. 'First, we picked our best players. Then we were
better organised, and thirdly we gave 100 per cent for 80 minutes. We are
doing none of these now and we are showing our lack of resources.'
The Irish always seemed to be larger than life - on and off the field.
Seared into my memory and liver is the effect of a Sunday spent in the
company of Keane during the 1977 Lions' tour of New Zealand. For Keane it
was a day of rest, which meant that for everyone else it was anything but.
No wonder he was nicknamed Rentastorm. He roamed the hotel press-ganging
players and journalists to join him for a drink. He came across me just
before midday, as far as my memory goes, which is not very far, for obvious
reasons. I escaped to my bed barely vertical and far from sober after a mere
eight hours at the court of King Moss.
A few months later Keane was the host during a day in Dublin. The liver
received a second battering but what sticks more clearly in the mind is his
driving rather than his drinking. Cackling with laughter and dwarfing the
tiny gear lever in his massive left hand, the Kerryman piloted his way
around the fair city in a screech of tyres and a blur of brakes.
'Are you an ambler gambler,' he roared again and again as he diced with the
traffic lights. 'I am.'
It was around men like Keane and Willie-John McBride and Syd Millar, all of
whom had voracious appetites for life and rugby, that Ireland built their
pack in days gone by. Keane was once advised that the second row forward
playing opposite him was soft and a punch would be a good manoeuvre. 'At the
first line-out I bopped him one,' Keane recalled. 'Then bash] He hit me
straight back. I thought to myself: 'Bejabbers, I hit the wrong man'.'
Men like Keane have disappeared - at least for the time being. 'We used to
have players in key positions who always did the right thing,' said Noel
Murphy, the Ireland manager. 'We have not got men like this any more.'
I have a solution. The IRFU should look at - I am sorry for mentioning this
word, and I will wash my mouth with soap - but what they should look at is
soccer in Ireland. Some years ago it was in as much disarray as rugby is
now.
With the sort of ingenuity and disregard for convention that the Irish
professional golfers showed by staging the Irish Masters in Portugal, the
soccer authorities called in the best man to become team manager: Jack
Charlton, an Englishman who lived in Northumberland.
Charlton revitalised the national team, taking them to the late stages of
the World Cup finals in Italy in 1990. One possible candidate to revitalise
the Irish rugby team is the brilliant French coach Pierre Villepreux. He
could be found a job teaching English or French in a school in Dublin. Are
the Irish big enough to make such a break with their traditions?
