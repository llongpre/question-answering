SPORT has always been an important ingredient of professional, social and
cultural life in north-west England, but just how far it has developed from
a pastime for hard-pressed workers on Saturday afternoons more than 100
years ago is nowhere better typified than at Manchester United.
Sport in the north may still, for some, conjure up an image of the baggy
shorts of the railway workers' kickabout, which is what Manchester United
was in 1878 when it was founded as the Newton Heath Lancashire and Yorkshire
Railway Football Club.
The reality now is a quoted company turning over more than Pounds 20m
annually, with distributed profits for its last financial year of Pounds 5m.
When alterations are complete, its home ground of Old Trafford will be a
45,000 all-seater superstadium, of which 3,000 will be high-priced executive
seating in boxes or attached to lounges.
The team, which once included world-class players such as Bobby Charlton and
George Best, has just won the English premier league championship and is one
of Europe's best. Its fame gives it big foreign support, with a 6,000-strong
Scandinavian fan club and 1,000 registered followers in Malta.
Mr Martin Edwards, the chairman, is not sure whether the Olympics will
enhance the club's reputation directly, but the stadium would certainly play
an important part. It would be involved directly in the football tournament,
while the judo competition would be in a specially-built indoor arena
adjoining it.
The important point, however, is that Manchester United typifies a
north-western tradition not only in athletic achievement, but in managing
and administering sport too. The stadium is now the most important 'neutral'
ground for big rugby league matches outside Wembley. Important rugby union
matches are also played there and there are plans for more matches.
On Merseyside, Liverpool Football Club has achieved even more in recent
years than Manchester United, winning the European Cup four times and
winning the English league championship a record number of times. Though
apparently in Liverpool's shadow, Everton - Merseyside's other big team -
has also excelled.
Old Trafford and Goodison Park - home of Everton and the larger of the two
big Liverpool football stadiums - would be used in the soccer tournament,
with the final at the Manchester United ground.
Sport is played and watched seriously at all levels. The big spectator
sports are football, rugby league and cricket - Lancashire county cricket is
played at another Old Trafford ground near the football stadium. They do not
all figure in the Olympic lists, but, again, they are well organised, with
big events well managed.
Out of this sporting tradition have come many heroes, such as Bobby Charlton
and George Best. Charlton, now a Manchester United director, is also an
active figure in the Olympic Bid. So is Chris Boardman, cycling pursuit
champion at Barcelona, who comes from Merseyside and will be an enthusiastic
user of the new velodrome and national cycling centre, already under
construction on the Olympic site.
The region - and Merseyside, in particular - has produced many boxers,
including Alan Rudkin, but the most famous is John Conteh, who rose through
the amateur ranks to become world light-heavyweight champion.
Fittingly, if Manchester's bid succeeds on behalf of the north-west, the
boxing tournament would be in Liverpool in a new arena near the Albert Dock.
More important than high profile sporting heroes and venues, however, is the
strength in depth of numbers of ordinary, amateur players in nearly all
Olympic sports. Athletics, basketball, badminton, cycling, canoeing,
equestrianism, fencing, football and the rest all have strong club
structures.
Wigan, the venue for swimming, has one of the strongest amateur swimming
clubs in Britain and the Merseyside suburbs are home to several of the
country's top field hockey clubs. In addition, most of those involved in
non-Olympic sports such as rugby union, cricket or rugby league - both as
players or administrators - have an interest and commitment to sport in
general.
The importance of this body of thousands of amateur sports players and
supporters is the corps of volunteers who would almost certainly answer any
call made upon them by the Olympic Games' organisers. They already toil
unpaid to make their own sports work and have proved themselves many times
in helping to ensure big events - in their own sports or others - have
worked well.
