abandoned after torrential rain caused a series of wild crashes in Adelaide.;

abandoned it an hour later as rain continued to fall heavily. Under the rules,
the standings after 14 laps were adapted as the official result.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Nigel Mansell, who crashed heavily on the 16th lap, was given second place
in his Williams-Renault, ahead of Gerhard Berger in the second McLaren-Honda.;
  Berger also had stopped by the time the race was halted.;   Because less
than 75 percent of the race was completed, only half the scheduled world
championship points were awarded.;   Senna already had clinched the drivers'
championship before the start of the race.;   "I don't think that was a race,"
Senna said. "It was a mistake by all of us to have started. We should have had
the courage to get together as a group and refused to start.";   The race was
scheduled for 190 miles. It was marked by a succession of spins and slides as
the rain pelted down onto the track. At one stage, four cars were stopped on
the straight.; GOLF: Craig Stadler's last-hole, three-putt bogey Saturday
dropped him into a tie with Russ Cochran for the lead after three rounds of
the season-ending, $2 million PGA Tour Championship in Pinehurst, N.C. Fred
Couples holed out a 108-yard wedge shot for an eagle-2 in the best round of
the tournament, a 5-under-par 66 that gave him a leg up in his battle with
Corey Pavin for all the major season titles. Couples was third at 211 and
within reach of the lead and the $360,000 first prize. Pavin had a 72 in the
gusty winds and was seven off the lead. Pavin and Couples are 1-2 in the
money-winning standings. Couples is first and Pavin second in the race for the
Vardon Trophy that goes to the player with the best scoring average. They are
tied for the lead in the point standings for the PGA player of the year.;
TENNIS: Pete Sampras and Guy Forget advanced to the final of the Paris Open
and set up a possible preview of the Davis Cup final. Sampras defeated Michael
Chang 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 in a semifinal before Forget beat Jonas Svensson 7-5,
6-4.; RUGBY: Australia won the World Cup with a 12-6 victory over England in
Twickenham,, England, with Tony Daly scoring the only try of the final.
Michael Lynagh kicked Australia's other eight points to increase his
world-record total to 689.; RUNNING: South African Elana Meyer, 24, ran the
fastest 15-kilometer road race ever by a woman (46 minutes, 57 seconds) in
Cape Town. Records are not recognized at the distance, but Meyer's time was 20
seconds faster than the previous best of 47:17 by Norway's Ingrid Kristiansen
in 1987.  </TEXT>
