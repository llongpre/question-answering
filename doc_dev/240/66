FINALLY, we have been put out of our misery. England are out of the World
Cup or, as the sports writers insist on calling it, 'the greatest
footballing show on earth.'
The misery in question, however, is not chiefly that of the England soccer
team but of the millions of us who find the national game ugly and
pointless. We dreaded the thought of the saturation coverage which would
ensue if the England team qualified for the finals. We remembered how,
during the last World Cup, it was impossible to arrange a dinner party in
case it clashed with yet another game in England's unlikely advance to the
semi-finals. Or one did go ahead only to find guests rushing from the table
asking if there was a television in the house.
But, as I say, we are out of our misery. The summer will be filled instead
with the proper and civilised sound of leather on willow rather than leather
on head or boot, or whatever other parts of the anatomy footballers use to
play their random, undisciplined and rowdy game.
There was a danger that one or other of the home nations would qualify for
'the greatest footballing show on earth.' Had Wales qualified then it would
immediately have been adopted, even by people who normally regard the celtic
fringes as fit subjects only for after-dinner jokes. Fortunately, however,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all managed to emulate England's
non-achievement.
The Republic of Ireland did qualify and the inevitable happened: the English
press began to describe that nation as part of 'the British Isles.' True
enough, but it was the first time I had heard this expression outside of a
geography text book. The point, of course, was to persuade us that we are in
some way still connected with, and intimately involved in, 'The greatest
footballing show on earth.' Had Ireland not qualified all would not have
been lost. Eventually, the list of referees chosen to arbitrate in the World
Cup finals would have been published and there might well have been an
Englishman on it. There would have ensued innumerable newspaper articles
about 'England's man at the greatest footballing show on earth.'
I wrote last week that I had been so buried in writing a book that no items
of news penetrated my consciousness. This was not quite the case. The one
event of global importance which was so insistently reported that even I
knew, was the England soccer team's loss to the Netherlands. In particular,
I gleaned the impression that it was unfair. It was all the fault of a
German referee.
This, it seemed to me at the time, was the worst thing about the media's
obsession with the travails of the England team: we were always unlucky. If
it was not a conveniently German referee, then it was an injury to England's
best player, or the run of the ball which was 'cruel', or our manager's
inexplicable failure to select our best side, or one of their players should
have been sent off. No one ever seemed prepared to admit that other nations
had, perhaps, produced more talented players and that is why they won and we
lost. Somehow the idea persists that we ought always to win, and that if we
do not, we are the victims of malicious fortune, or bad management.
To a small extent this national disease of making excuses has spread into
the nobler game of cricket.
I would be rash to comment on the last week's High Court libel action over
the matter of alleged Pakistani ball - tampering in Test matches against
England. But it is hard to avoid the impression that the main stimulus to
the press's charges was the desire to find a reason for the England team's
defeat which did not include the fact that the Pakistani team were simply
much better players.
This whingeing would be more tolerable if, when England win, we were able to
do so without any gloating. It is hard to remember when an England victory
was not so greeted by the home press.
Doubtless other nations are as bad. Some might be worse. But I am delighted
that they will be the ones to endure more months of hyperbole and hackery,
while we in England can open a newspaper or watch television without being
forced to take part in 'The greatest footballing show on earth.'
