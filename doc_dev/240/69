<LEADPARA>  The NHL has been labeled greedy for charging its expansion teams $50 million
for the right to get creamed by teams such as the Toronto Maple Leafs.;   And
one of the new teams is learning the NHL's follow-the-buck rules to the point
where it has upset the NHL.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Ottawa Senators were first criticized in May when they dropped their
stylized Parliament Hill logo, complete with Peace Tower, in favor of a
helmeted Roman centurion.;   Now the Senators' decision to sell their own game
sweater has upset the NHL, which is dropping hints at copyright
infringements.;   The Senators say they're striking out on their own because
the NHL couldn't get their stuff out in time for the holiday season.;   And
those $enators know what they're doing. On their own, the franchise made an
estimated $350,000 on sales of $1.2 million of Senators stuff during last
year's Christmas rush.; BRETT BUTLER AND BUGS; If you're a fan of Dodgers
outfielder Brett Butler, get a bowl of sugar-coated cereal and join your kids
in front of the TV on Saturday for Butler's guest appearance on the
animated/live sequence "Back to the Future" show. Channels 5 and 46, at 10
a.m.; STILL WORKING ON THAT HEIMLICH MANEUVER; Ah, rugby. The only sport where
everybody makes the All-Madden team.;   The poor stomach in this shot belongs
to England's Will Carling, whose forward progress was stopped by an Australian
in the World Cup Rugby Finals on Saturday.;   Carling probably didn't feel any
better after the match, which Australia won 12-6.; 'I need to get my second
wind pretty quick. ';   -- San Antonio Spurs center David Robinson, on the
long preseason and Coach Larry Brown's hard workouts.  </TEXT>
