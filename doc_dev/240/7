CAMEOS from the Five Nations' championship of the 1991/92 season, which ends
this afternoon:
Dublin, January 18. Wales surprisingly defeat Ireland, the World Cup
quarter-finalists. The one-point margin - 16-15 - is flattering to the
Irish. Welshmen are overjoyed and some former internationals, men who ought
to know better, are heard to remark: 'the Grand Slam next.'
The foyer of the Berkeley Court hotel five minutes' walk from Lansdowne Road
is crowded after the match. A Dublin student attending her first rugby
international is anxious to obtain the autograph of Ieuan Evans, the Welsh
captain. 'How do you pronounce his christian name?' she asks. 'The first
syllable is 'yi' as in yipes' she is told. 'Then you add the sound 'an' as
in 'and.'
Ten minutes later she returns, her cheeks flushed with pleasure. 'I met
Ieuan' she says, pronouncing the name almost perfectly. 'What a charmer. A
complete gentleman.'
The Irish players come down from their rooms and mingle graciously with
their own supporters and the few Welshmen who have gained entry to the hotel
of the Irish team. The Welsh are magnanimous in victory but the Irish, in
case anyone is in any doubt, are magnificent in defeat.
After the post-match dinner Alan Davies, the coach of the Welsh team, is
wandering happily around the foyer of the hotel savouring his first triumph
in the championship. A reporter congratulates him on victory and remarks
that he was lucky Tony Copsey, one of Wales's second-row forwards, had not
been sent off. Copsey was twice warned by the referee. Davies smiles
enigmatically and walks off.
Cardiff, February 1. The first home game in the championship for Wales is
marked by an outpouring of Welsh cliches. The Cwmbach male voice choir
brings some hwyl to the pre-match singing and song sheets are distributed
throughout the stadium. Players and officials from both teams are presented
to the Princess of Wales. Beverley Humphreys, an opera singer, leads the
singing of the national anthem.
This chauvinism is part of a campaign by the Welsh Rugby Union to promote
Welsh rugby. Other aspects of the campaign include naming the Welsh team the
Dragons and redesigning the national shirt.
One change brought about by Davies is consistency in selection. This Welsh
team is unchanged from the one that defeated Ireland. Wales show some fire
and verve in the second half but are 12-0 down at that point. Three
penalties by Wales in the second half are reminiscent of their revival from
6-15 behind in Dublin two weeks earlier. France win though, 12-9.
Dublin, February 15. Ireland, defeated by Wales and crushed by England, are
facing Scotland and 3-9 behind at half-time. Their stand-off, Ralph Keyes,
is booed by his own supporters for bad kicking. Long before the final
whistle spectators are leaving their seats. Mick Doyle, the former coach who
writes an acerbic column in the Irish Independent, was scathing after defeat
by Wales. 'Wales may be on their knees' he wrote 'but we are on our arses.'
After this latest defeat, 18-10, he is apoplectic.
Dublin is awash with Scots in kilts celebrating victory. They seem
impervious to the below-freezing temperature.
Twickenham, March 8. A dampness in the air does little to dampen the
occasion and drinks, jokes and laughter mixing well in the west car park
before the game. England are strong favourites to beat Wales and win a
second grand slam in a row, the first time this has been done since the
1920s.
As Will Carling makes yet another magnificent burst past Neil Jenkins he
reminds us that as an attacking full back he would be dynamite. The trouble
is he is dynamite as a centre.
England's performance is their worst of the season but for Wales there is a
word of praise from one of the gods. 'There is fight back in this side'
observes Gareth Edwards, the great scrum half. 'There is backbone that was
not there six months ago.'
Cardiff, March 21. Davies's period of office expires after the game between
Wales and Scotland this afternoon. He wants to remain as coach until after
the World Cup in 1995 and cool heads support him. Hot heads want more
success, however. Davies, they point out, has been one of the country's
least successful coaches, having lost five and won two matches since he took
over late last summer.
They are forgetting how bad Wales once were and how far the WRU have to go
to reach the level of competence of the RFU. Who will win in the struggle in
Welsh rugby, the Roundheads or Cavaliers, the cool heads or hot heads? We
must wait until April 2 when the general committee of the WRU meets to find
out.
