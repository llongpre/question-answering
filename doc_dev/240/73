THE LAST man I saw playing rugby union in an old-fashioned scrumcap was my
eldest brother, who has a very large head. He looked more than usually
ridiculous in it, with his hair standing out in wild tufts between the
straps and pads. But there was another, more serious, handicap. The
contraption blotted out all sound, including the referee's whistle.
He wore it for a single game. On two of three occasions he rampaged
downfield, ball in hand, glory beckoning. Each time the unaccustomed
exhilaration of having outstripped the defence eventually gave way to
suspicion at the absence of pursuit. He stopped and turned, to find us all
scoffing at a distance; then trudged back to take his place at the scrum
which the referee had summoned.
A version of the old-style scrumcap does still have its adherents,
particularly in rugby league. Gary Schofield has worn one in the test
matches against New Zealand, a helmet which recalls John Wayne as Genghis
Khan, galloping across the wastes of Mongolia.
But in the union game it has been chucked on to the scrapheap, to join
knee-length shorts, banana-shaped boots, and those fat, rain-heavy balls
which, on raw November afternoons, descended from grey skies like mortar
shells. Elasticated strapping has become the vogue method of protecting
ears. This comes either wide and thick, making the wearer look as if he had
suffered a shrapnel wound; or thin and mean, as sported by Brian Moore (who
is mean, but not thin).
The decline and fall of the scrumcap has been mirrored by that of the other
icon of rugby, the cauliflower ear. Once, this was the indispensable
trademark mark of those warriors of the front and second rows. The shapeless
mess of pulverised gristle and cartilage on the side of the head was a badge
of honour, a silent legacy of hard times, - murky misdeeds, sacrifices
gladly made.
Actually, of course, this is sentimental nonsense. No one in his right mind
would wish to go through life with ears resembling lumps of uncooked sausage
meat. It would be absurd to object to the use of elasticated strapping if it
prevents such disfigurement; nor, even, to the spectacle - recently seen on
television - of Wade Dooley having his cauliflower ear feasted on by a leech
in an effort to get rid of the swelling.
Nor, if I am honest, can I become emotional about that time-honoured
accessory, the jockstrap. For years the powers that be have been urging the
abandonment of this article of dress, on the grounds that it is a seedbed
for the infectious and revolting herpes known as scrum-pox. The Rugby
Football Union want it replaced by swimming trunks; and it would be mere
fogeyishness to argue otherwise.
But the communal bath is another matter. It lies at heart of the culture of
rugby union. True, the spectacle of a score and more of hairy, fleshy,
battle-scarred bodies floundering in a huge tub of muddy water can be
something of an affront to those of a sensitive disposition, particularly if
the air is booming with the vile obscenity of the usual rugby chorus.
On the other hand, a shower cannot provide the balm to raw abrasions,
stretched muscles and twisted joints that comes with total immersion. The
authorities frown, muttering about disease and uncleanliness. But are there
not infections lurking in the cracks between the tiles beneath the showers?
To be indelicate, have they not heard of verrucas and allied horrors? So,
let the taps gush and the steam rise and the bodies intermingle. Leave the
harmless institution of the post-match plunge alone.
