RUGBY UNION: December 6, Bowring Bowl, Oxford v Cambridge, Twickenham
Cambridge' hopes suffered a blow late last month when Chris Tynan, the
Canadian international, pulled out of the team with what looks like being a
long-term neck injury. It means he will miss Canada's game against England
on Saturday, and the chance of facing Gareth Rees, his international partner
and Oxford's stand off, in the 113th Varsity Match.
Oxford took the honours last year, and on recent results look the stronger
side. The Dark Blues beat Romania 26-16, while Cambridge went down to the
tourists 27-18. Duck-egg Blues would be a better description for Cambridge
in the Romania match, because after 122 years, and tempted by a Pounds
50,000, three-year deal with a US company, they have changed the design of
their strip. They have, however, promised to return to their old-style
jerseys for Tuesday.
And what of the hullabaloo over money, between the universities and the
Rugby Football Union? The annual match has become so popular that it
generates around Pounds 700,000 gate money. The RFU takes 15 per cent of
that and, after expenses, the universities get around Pounds 150,000 each.
Now, claiming it is underpaid for what is a 'world-class' venue, the RFU
wants a bigger take of the profits. Oxbridge has responded with a threat to
move next year's match to Wembley. The universities should tread carefully.
Part of the attraction of the Varsity Match is its venue, the atmosphere it
generates and the area Twickenham provides for 'hospitality'. Redevelopment
means the ground's capacity will rise from 58,000 this year to 75,000 for
1995. So there is room for negotiation, and hopes are high for a compromise
to be announced on the morning of the game.
