ARE WE witnessing the beginning of the end of the one-day cricket
phenomenon?
That might seem an odd question in the middle of the hype that surrounds the
World Cup, currently taking place in Australia and New Zealand. But there
are indications that the frenetic excitement which has been the hallmark of
the instant game may be disappearing as the format matures.
There has been plenty of drama. Australia's defeats by New Zealand and South
Africa, and England's win over the West Indies, must have stirred the hearts
of cricket fans everywhere. But the excitement has been in the results, not
on the field.
South Africa's victory over Australia in Sydney marked a triumphant return
after two decades in the wilderness. England's crushing victory in Melbourne
confirmed the decline of the West Indies and the re-emergence of Graham
Gooch's side as a cricketing force.
But both games were rather boring to watch. There are several reasons for
this, the most important of which is a weakness in the structure of the
one-day game which has only recently become apparent.
Back in the early 1970s, when instant cricket was becoming established in
England, most games followed a predictable pattern. Both sides would start
slowly, and then build to a crescendo in the final few overs as batsmen
threw the bat in an effort to maximise the score. The format guaranteed
plenty of big hitting in the first innings, probably followed by tumbling
wickets and a run chase in the last hour as the side batting second began to
run out of overs.
However, as the diet of one-day matches has increased, the players have
learnt to pace themselves, so that the second innings run chase is becoming
the exception rather than the rule. This is particularly true of games where
the side batting first makes a low total, as Australia did against South
Africa and the West Indies did against England. All that is then necessary
is for the top-order batsmen of the side batting second to keep their heads.
If they can do that, the advantage of knowing the required run rate will get
them home, as Kepler Wessels and Gooch showed for the Springboks and England
respectively.
There are other pointers to the changing nature of the game. For example,
quick bowling is disappearing as the smartest captains realise how expensive
the fast men can be with artificial one-day field settings.
New Zealand excluded Danny Morrison, their fastest bowler, from their
triumphant side in Auckland, and opened instead with medium pace from Chris
Cairns and off-spin from Dipak Patel. England have prospered with a bowling
line-up of four medium pacers, including the portly Ian Botham, still
swinging the ball viciously on occasions, but several yards slower than in
his salad days. Pakistan took the strategy to extremes against Zimbabwe in
Hobart on Thursday by using three spinners and a slow seamer for most of
their 50 overs. Imran Khan would have bowled had he been fit, but even he
relies more on guile than pace these days.
By contrast, Australia went into both their unsuccessful matches with
McDermott and Reid, their two fastest bowlers, and the West Indies relied
heavily on Curtly Ambrose and Malcolm Marshall against England and in their
earlier win against Pakistan. The Australian pair had aggregate figures of 3
for 146 for the two games, the West Indians 0 for 156.
The exception has been South Africa's Allan Donald, inevitably dubbed 'White
Lightning', who grabbed three Australian wickets for 34 runs off 10 overs.
But while Donald got the wickets, it was Richard Snell, another change
bowler, who strangled the Australian run rate with 0 for 15 in 9 overs.
Bobby Simpson, the Australian coach, put his finger on another development
when he pointed out that Australia had been beaten twice because its tactics
had been successfully copied by the opposing sides. He was right.
Australia's dominance of the one-day game over the past four years has been
built on percentage batting rather than big hitting, backed by shrewd field
placings to restrict the opposition score. That is the formula which has
been exploited by England, New Zealand and South Africa, three sides which
look likely to reach the semi-finals.
There are still plenty of big hitters in the game, and matches can still be
turned round in a few overs by batsmen like Botham, Wessels and Australia's
David Boon. But as the tactical development of the game continues, there may
be less of the spectacular batting which one-day cricket has delivered so
often in the past. While that might please the purists, it would not be
greeted with much enthusiasm among the paying customers, who have become
used, for example, to seeing the square cut played from outside leg stump.
Ominously, there were a few chants of 'boring' even at the Australia-South
Africa and England-West Indies games, where the crowd was largely made up of
committed supporters.
There are 30 matches left in the World Cup, including today's crucial clash
between New Zealand and South Africa in Auckland, for the players to show
that maturity has not robbed the one-day game of its magic.
