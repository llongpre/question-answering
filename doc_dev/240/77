This month's emotional rugby victory by Wales over England seemed a good
moment to test the thesis that national sporting triumphs give business a
boost. The evidence from the principality is inconclusive.
The most authoritative word comes from Ken Jones, who played in the centre
for Wales 14 times. Now he is managing director of Takiron at Caerphilly,
the first Japanese company to arrive in Wales in 1972.
'Yes, a result such as the one with England gives a great boost, especially
to morale. And a happy worker is usually a better worker than a disgruntled
one. But industry is highly automated now and the ability of the worker to
increase his own productivity independently is restricted. In a highly
labour-intensive industry it is just possible there could be a surge of
output. The reality, though, is that everyone feels better, it's a little
easier to go to work, and to give more undivided attention to work while
there.'
Meirion Lewis, Welsh director of the Institute of Directors, said a good
result gives an industrial lift. 'In Wales, rugger permeates all levels of
society. A win imparts confidence and if we can get the rugger right it
provides a more optimistic outlook to the other things in life.'
Byron Samuel, operations director for South Wales Electricity, is sceptical
that the Cardiff Arms Park euphoria could translate into higher output. It
was impossible to quantify what happened the following Monday and attribute
it to the match, he said.
In Wales rugby has contributed to economic growth through its links with
Japan, from where investment has poured into the country. Welsh rugby teams
nurtured the game in Japan and made the name 'Wales' known there.
