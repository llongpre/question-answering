The Rugby Football Union has embarked on a crusade to win hearts and minds
or, as the RFU puts it characteristically, to 'transmit the rugby union
message'. This campaign has already achieved one extraordinary feat: that of
having a slogan which surpasses in staleness and fatuity anything the
political parties managed to dream up for their autumn conferences.
The rallying cry is - hold your breath - 'Rugby Union Rules OK'. Catchy, eh?
In a publication called 'Working With The Media', it is presented in the
form of a mnemonic. Thus, 'R is Rugby' the greatest game in the world. 'U is
for Unconverted', not tries, but people who do not realise that rugby is the
greatest game in the world. 'G is for Grassroots rugby' the greatest game in
the world at its lowest level. And so on.
Fort's aide de memoir would have proceeded rather differently. 'R is for
Roughhouse' if legalised mayhem is to your taste, this is your game. 'U is
for Ugly' no prejudice here. 'G is for GRRRR' the battle cry of front rows
preparing to engage. When we come to B in this publication, the extent of
the cop-out becomes clear: 'B is Blast Out The Message' that rugby union is
the greatest et cetera et cetera. But to 99 per cent of those who play the
greatest blah blah, B stands for nothing of the sort. 'B is for Beer' the
fuel on which rugby runs.
Nowhere does the pamphlet mention the stuff. There are pages of worthy
advice on getting youngsters off street corners, blending healthy athletic
exercise with the unique bonds of friendship which a team game bestows, and
so on. But there is not a squeak about the activity which in any rugby club
comes second only to the business on the field - and in a good many takes
precedence even over that - namely, tipping your head back and pouring ale
down your throat.
The heart of a rugby club is its bar, and its purpose is to slake the mighty
thirst of players and supporters.
But the collective mind of the powers at Twickenham has turned to higher
ideals. The ethos of white wine and soda appears to prevail, and the air is
thick with exciting concepts of marketing, image-enhancement, community
links. Muddy boots, jugs of bitter, carthorse props with vast paunches, all
this belongs to the dark ages. Rugby union is becoming clean-living,
diet-conscious, media-oriented, self-aware.
The central message in this document is that the game must be 'bolstered and
promoted'. To be fair, much of the advice it contains on how to secure
decent media coverage is sound, if rather obvious. But while it is full of
tips such as this: 'Newspapers, radio and television love children. They
make good copy', it is conspicuously silent about the other species of story
beloved of inquiring hacks.
These are the tales of pillage and destruction, of hotels and bars drunk dry
and wrecked, of air hostesses leered at and pinched, of bottoms bared; of
loutish pranks, dirty ditties, rampant rowdyism and oafishness. The
recurrent theme is that immense quantities of beer have been consumed.
Nor does the RFU have anything helpful to say to its press officers about
another murky aspect of the greatest game: foul deeds on the pitch. They are
urged to titillate sports editors with jolly items about long-serving tea
ladies, monoglot Japanese recruits, and photogenic women players.
But are they to be equally forthcoming about the skullduggery and criminal
nastiness which reduced last Saturday's local derby to a tribal
bloodletting?
The RFU may prefer to pretend that rugby is a game for anyone, of whatever
size, sex, colour, creed, age, temperament and taste, who happens to enjoy
chasing an oval ball around a playing field.
It is, in fact, a tough, rough, messy, muscular form of wargame,
forbiddingly complex in its rules, immensely difficult to play well, with an
ineradicably dark side to it. It is for people who have a tough, rough side
to them, who enjoy doling out a little punishment and do not mind taking it,
who relish getting hot, dirty, bruised and exhausted and who, generally
speaking, fancy a pint at the end of it all.
