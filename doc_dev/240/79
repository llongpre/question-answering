FORTUNE WAS against me when it sent Imran Khan to Oxford University in 1973,
the year after I had left. Although I enjoyed many a happy hour watching
cricket in the Parks, I only saw Imran later, when the county circuit
brought him nearby, playing sadly for Worcestershire, drinking milk and
hating the pub evenings that are the heart of most cricketers' social lives.
I did not see him play for Pakistan until 1982, when he brought them on a
short tour of England. Imran is an easy man to miss. So easy that one is
tempted to conclude that managing his absences ranks among his most astute
cricketing skills.
No-one knows better than Imran when to make people miss him, miss him so
much that he has no alternative but to return in a blaze of glory because
his country cannot go on without him. His captaincy is not especially
exciting or enterprising, but it is strong. When Imran made his debut as
captain of Pakistan 10 years ago, Pakistan lost the three-Test series 2-1,
but came away triumphantly because they had won Pakistan's first Test
victory at Lords. Imran followed that up with crushing defeats of Australia,
where his leg-spinning protege Abdul Qadir fatally mesmerised the batsmen,
and then of India. Only a stress fracture of the shin removed him from power
for the next couple of years.
I suppose it was only that.
First Zaheer Abbas, then Javed Miandad took over the leadership when Imran
had to drop out in late 1983, but in early 1984 the selectors were sacked
because they had preferred Javed to the unfit Imran as captain in Australia,
to nationwide dismay.
Imran was declared captain although he could not bowl at all and could only
play a bit, cautiously, in the fourth Test. The crack in his shin kept
opening and closing. He said it might well be the end of his Test career.
By late 1985 he was back, after Javed's aggressive captaincy had provoked
complaints, from Pakistan's players and opponents alike. Imran then led
Pakistan through a drawn series against the West Indies and a victorious one
against the old rivals, India, which saw the team welcomed home as national
heroes and Imran as a phoenix deserving of endless adulation.
Instances of Imran reluctantly returning to power are too numerous to list,
the latest and most spectacular being the World Cup. But they illustrate a
principle worth remembering, now that Pakistan are here for a gruelling 15
week tour, with 34 matches, including five Test and five Texaco one-day
internationals. This is ideal waiting ground for Imran. He is nursing his
sore shoulder, watching and waiting.
Anyone lucky enough to be at Worcester could testify to the glorious
ferocity of Pakistan's batting attack, as Ramiz Raja and Salim Malik tore
the bowling apart on Wednesday, and also to its volatile nature: on Friday
they were all out for 93 in the second innings. Aamir Sohail had a less than
memorable match, but he is a difficult character who makes his presence felt
in every game in which he plays. Wicket-keeper Moin Khan is another fiery,
disruptive element.
In a long tour, after a hard but victorious World Cup with a month's
unremitting celebrations afterwards, the problem is going to be keeping up
the team's momentum and keeping its players together as a team. A set of
meteoric personalities like these is liable to crack into factions under
pressure.
Javed, Pakistan's captain, is a great fighter and an insatiable competitor,
but he is not a man to ease pressure or, I think, to use it to best
advantage, which is one of Imran's strengths.
If they confront it right, the Pakistanis thrive on adversity. Sometimes it
is almost as if they get into trouble on purpose, so they can come out of it
all the more sensationally.
'Forget all these worries about no-balls and wides and just go and fight,'
Imran told his troops three games before the World Cup final, with three
wins needed to qualify. They qualified and won. If Javed can keep all the
fighting directed against the enemy, he has some players of fearsome talent
at his disposal.
England's best policy is probably to 'try and stay cool', as Gooch put it
when asked last summer how he helped his team face ferocious West Indian
bowling bombardments. You would not find either Imran or Javed telling the
Pakistani Tigers to try and stay cool, but they would find it frustrating if
the enemy stays cool.
In Karachi, where Javed comes from, cricket is battle, and if the game
itself fails to generate enough crackle, I would not be surprised to see him
get himself involved in some sort of trouble associated with the game. This
would be a sad second best.
Pakistan are disappointed that England are using English umpires for this
tour, though they have accepted the fact. This position, which has a certain
ironic tinge to it, is a possible source of trouble under pressure, as is
the over-crowded schedule crammed with one-day matches, England's desire for
revenge after the World Cup, Pakistan's desire to complete their humiliation
of colonial England and, of course, the ever-present tensions of Pakistani
cricket politics.
Whether or not Javed and Imran end up playing this tour as a double act, it
should be an exciting one to watch. Wasim Akram of Lancashire, Salim Malik
of Essex and the injured Waqar Younis of Surrey have enough experience of
English teams and conditions to give useful advice, though of course that
can become too much of a good thing.
Intikhab Alam, Pakistan's manager, with 12 popular years of leg-spin bowling
and muscular batting for Surrey behind him (1969-1981), will have to handle
that carefully. He should be a good man to help bring young Mushtaq Ahmed's
bowling of wrist spin, leg-spin, googlies and flippers to its best.
And of course there is always Imran. The man who first spotted and fostered
the talent of Wasim and Waqar; who picked Mushtaq as a worthy successor to
the magical Qadir, another of his discoveries, and has declared the dynamic
22 year-old batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq to be a genius. Who dare argue? Imran has
an expert knowledge of cricket. He loves being in command; indeed, some say
he was born to be in command. I wonder what odds are being offered on
whether Imran will emerge from retirement this summer, for the very last
time, to show his players how to play and win, even when it is impossible.
