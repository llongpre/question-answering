TIMID Australian sportsmen are about as common as possums in Pontypool. So
why are London and Sydney suddenly crowded with shrinking violets talking
down Australia's chances in today's Rugby League World Cup final at Wembley?
Kangaroos coach Bob Fulton set the tone before leaving for London, warning
that Australia's 2-1 victory in the Ashes series earlier this year was no
guide to form for the World Cup.
'Great Britain should be favourites. We haven't got much in our favour. If
we don't win at Wembley, our Ashes success won't mean the same. In football,
people have short memories,' Fulton moaned.
It doesn't seem to matter who you talk to. Kangaroos captain Mal Meninga and
experienced second rower Bob Lindner both warn that Australia will have
their work cut out to beat Great Britain.
Back in Australia, some of the experts are going even further. 'If I had to
put up my money I'd back the Poms,' 1988 World Cup star Wayne Pearce told
fans in Brisbane yesterday.
More is at stake than just the World Cup. Australia have towered over
international rugby league since 1970, the last time Great Britain won an
Ashes series. But they have never led the all-time league table.
This year's Ashes games left Australia and Great Britain with 52 wins each
since the first Test in 1908. A Kangaroos victory would justify Australian
claims that Sydney is now the centre of world rugby league.
So are the wily Australians serious, or are they trying to disarm the
despised Poms before sending out another team of fast-moving giants to take
the trophy back to Sydney, its home since 1975?
Fulton is clearly concerned about the long lay-off enjoyed by the players
since the end of the domestic season in September. Easy tour matches against
mediocre opposition like Sheffield, Huddersfield and Cumbria will have done
little to restore match fitness.
And taking a break does affect performance: the world club championship,
played in the Australian off-season, has never been won by an Australian
side, in spite of Australia's dominance at international level.
Secondly, Australia's pre-eminence over the last 22 years has encouraged a
focus on the domestic game, prompting many Australians to rate the local
Winfield Cup competition ahead of international games. Some commentators
fear the Kangaroos may not be hungry enough to win.
But the real cause of Australian caution is recent results, which suggest
that playing standards in other countries may be catching up, perhaps
heralding the end of Australia's long period of dominance.
The first crack in the facade appeared in 1991, when Australia unexpectedly
lost 24-8. in Melbourne in the first of a three match series against New
Zealand. More seriously, Australia were thrashed 33-10 by Great Britain in
June in the second Ashes Test, again in Melbourne.
For perhaps the first time two decades, the British made the Australians
look ordinary. Significantly, the match was played in the kind of soft
conditions the Australians are likely to face at Wembley.
Australia won the series after victories in Sydney and Brisbane, but no-one
who saw the Sydney Test will forget the electrifying sight of Martin Offiah
twice getting away on the left wing, each time denied a try by the narrowest
touch of boot on sideline.
Offiah's chances of escaping today must be improved by the absence of the
the injured Andrew Ettingshausen, the top class full back who forced him
into touch on both occasions. But as successive British tourists have
discovered, the structure of the modern game in Australia produces teams
which are very hard to beat. The Winfield Cup has expanded and strengthened
considerably since 1980, and now includes teams from Queensland, Canberra
and provincial New South Wales as well as Sydney.
The gradual enlargement of the competition has increased the pool of top
players and coaches available to the national side, and helped the game
maintain its dominance among Australia's four football codes, at least in
the core rugby league states of New South Wales and Queensland.
Ominously for British fans, the strengthening process is likely to
accelerate in the next couple of years, when the competition will be
expanded to include Auckland in New Zealand, adding all the emotions of
international football to the weekly league programme.
Like their British counterparts, Australian coaches put a lot of emphasis on
commitment, physical fitness and tough tackling. But the dry sun-baked
grounds also encourage speed and ball handling skills which are harder to
develop in the freezing dampness of English winters.
The Australians have benefitted over the last few years from the
inspirational captaincy of two outstanding players who epitomise all these
qualities: 'King' Wally Lewis from 1984 to 1990, and latterly Meninga,
Australia's most capped player and record scorer with 250 points.
Meninga's success in replacing the legendary Lewis has played a big part in
keeping Australia at the top of the rugby league tree, but it places a huge
responsibility on him in the final.
If Meninga and Allan Langer fire on the Wembley turf Australia's weasel
words over the last few days are likely to be quickly forgotten. If they do
not, all the advance excuses are unlikely to protect Fulton and his men from
a raucous reception back in Sydney.
