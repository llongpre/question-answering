It was the year of the big pay day. It was the year Linford Christie was
paid Pounds 100,000 for a meaningless 100m race with Carl Lewis.
It was the year Lennox Lewis won the WBC world heavyweight title the smart
way, without throwing a punch and became Britain's highest-paid sportsman.
He earned Pounds 3m for beating Frank Bruno, who appears more often in panto
than in the ring, and Pounds 6m for defeating Tony Tucker, who ought to
follow Bruno's example. Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe shared Dollars
15m when they fought for the WBA and IBF titles. Lewis and Holyfield may
split a far larger purse in 1994. The winner will then try to hang on for
the biggest pay-day of all when Mike Tyson's six-year prison sentence ends.
French police found FFr250,000 buried in the garden of the mother-in-law of
Christophe Robert, a Valenciennes player. Robert said the money was a bribe
to lose to Marseilles. Marseilles became the first French club to win a
European trophy but was then thrown out of this season's Champions Cup and
Intercontinental Cup.
The New Zealand Rugby Union said it would try to provide its top players
with Pounds 30,000 a year and the Welsh Rugby Football Union and Swansea
found a job for Scott Gibbs who was talking of turning professional.
But in the year of the big cheque, the biggest earners in men's and women's
sport left the stage.
Monica Seles won Dollars 2.6m in 1992. She was on the way to passing that
total when, at a tournament in Hamburg in April, she was stabbed by Gunther
Parche, who wanted Steffi Graf restored to number one in the rankings. The
injury required one stitch but damaged the shoulder muscles of Seles'
playing arm. Parche received a two-year suspended sentence. Seles has not
played since. Rumour surrounds her: is she psychologically scarred? Is she
using the injury as an excuse to allow her battered knees to recover? Is she
secretly turning herself into a serve and volley player? Seles plans to make
her comeback in January at the Australian Open.
Michael Jordan who earned an estimated Dollars 36m this year. retired 'for
now' in October.
In June, Jordan led his 'supporting cast', the Chicago Bulls, to its third
consecutive National Basketball Association title. In August, his father,
James, was killed, apparently while being robbed. Then Jordan's gambling,
frowned upon in US sport, became the subject of investigation after a golf
partner wrote a book dedicated to the size of Jordan's bets.
For a man whose greatest quality was his willingness to take responsibility
on court when the spotlight was most intense and who is paid an estimated
Dollars 28m a year to be the public face of, among others, Nike, Gatorade
and McDonald's, life under the unrelenting scrutiny of the US media seemed
to have paled.
Even though Jordan is not playing, the Bulls are said to be paying Dollars
3.9m of his contract this season. It means that, under the complex NBA
complex rules, the Bulls would be able to play Jordan should his competitive
nature draw him out of retirement.
The biggest stocking filler of all was announced this week. In the US, Fox
Network won the television rights to the National Football Conference,the
older of the National Football Leagues' two divisions. CBS had broadcast NFC
games for 38 years, but could not match the Dollars 1.56bn (Pounds 1.06bn)
four-year bid by Fox, seen as a down-market interloper by its rivals. This
may ring a bell with UK soccer fans, but then the largest shareholder in
BSkyB is Rupert Murdoch who owns Fox. He makes an unlikely Santa Claus.
