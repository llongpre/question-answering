THE REVELATION that it was all over came just before the lights went out. It
was a Sunday afternoon in November, and beneath the ramparts of Windsor
Castle a game of rugby, of sorts, was being played. It was a one-sided
affair, and we were on the wrong side. A pernickety referee had decided that
two passing youths, whom we wished to recruit to bring us up to numerical
strength, were too young. We were under the hammer. For myself, I was just
trying to keep out of trouble.
I knew the flesh was weak: bad back, enfeebled ankles, twanging hamstrings,
chronic wind shortage. But the spirit had, hitherto, been willing. Now I
found the spirit had gone the way of the flesh. So I jogged along, leaning
in a scrum here, bending to inspect a maul there, stretching supplicating
hands above my head in the lineouts, stopping whenever possible - usually to
watch a hungry opposition sweeping again through defences attenuated to the
point of extinction.
Suddenly I found the ball in my hands, in broken play. Ancient, treacherous
instincts asserted themselves, and instead of throwing it away, I advanced.
The way was guarded by a vast, muscular creature. As I approached him, the
instinct told me: 'Take the tackle and lay the ball back.' I might have
known that this was futile, and that with none of my team at hand, I would
merely by laying it back to the enemy. Take the tackle I did, and of the
fate of the ball I know nothing. The creature plucked me up by the thighs,
turning me upside down and throwing me up, then left gravity to do its work.
I retired from rugby as I came down. I saw mud and grass rush towards me and
darkness supervened.
That was almost two years ago and I have remained retired. The back is
worse, the ankles and hamstrings more delicate than ever, the wind almost
gone. Feeling as I do now, the idea of playing rugby is ludicrous. Yet there
is a voice - a damnably insistent one - which at this time of year nags at
me, reminding me how I miss it. Looking back over the best part of 20 years
as a coarse rugby man (I did not take it up until manhood), it is not the
achievements on the field which stand out. There were tries and triumphs,
all the more precious for their rarity. And I can still dimly taste the joy
of the surge through a gap, the dive for the line, the leaping catch at the
lineout, the smash of a tackle.
But much more vivid - the real motor of nostalgia - is the memory of
companionship, simply the getting together with other like-minded fellows
for an innocent letting-off of steam on a Sunday in winter. I can smell the
smells of changing rooms, liniment and Vaseline; hear the drumming of studs
on tiles and the snap of elasticated bandages on to meaty thighs; feel the
churn of nerves in the pit of the stomach and the wind and rain in the face
as we ran out out on to the pitch, peering at our opponents to assess if
they looked in any better shape than us.
We never went in for the conventional ritualistic heartyism of the rugby
club. We did not bawl out bar-room ditties, because we never knew the words;
nor did we match ourselves in ale-quaffing contests, knowing we would lose.
Our changing room never echoed to the unison roar of the pre-match chant,
promising annihilation to our opponents. Our tactical approach was
childlike. Indeed, we had no tactics worthy of the name, since - as often as
not - matters of who was playing where were not settled until after the
match had started. We had lineout calls, but they were imperfectly
understood by those who were supposed to jump.
Almost no one knew the rules, which never inhibited us from abusing referees
who did. We never trained, so we had no planned moves. We simply pushed in
the scrums, jumped at the lineouts, got offside at rucks and mauls, tackled
when we could reach someone to tackle, kicked when we had to and ran the
ball when we could.
Afterwards, over our beer, we would either bemoan our naivete or laugh at
the way we had transcended it. We would abuse each other, our opponents and
the hapless ref, and dwell on our blunders and our hopes for next week. And
we would go home warm and happy and wake up aching the next day.
Of course, memory erases most of the boring and bloody side of it: the
joyless massacres suffered, the ugliness of injury and occasional violence,
the physical awfulness of tender feet, flaming abrasions, stabbing stitches.
But it was fun, and life is less fun without it, and I still sense a mute
reproach from my boots and tin of dubbin, as they stand gathering dust in
the cupboard under the stairs.
