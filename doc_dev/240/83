COMPANIES will have to bid at least Pounds 950,000 to secure exclusive
sponsorship rights to UK commercial television coverage of the European
Football Championship.
The sponsorship committee of the Independent Television Association is
announcing the decision today as an experiment in changing the manner of
attracting TV sponsors.
The ITV network is providing 26 hours of coverage of the championship, which
takes place in Sweden between June 10 and 26. The BBC is also covering the
event.
The association arranged Sony's sponsorship of November's Rugby World Cup
Championship for an estimated fee of Pounds 1.25m. TV audience figures for
the final of that event were 14.6m, with 36 per cent of all UK males in the
advertising categories ABC1 viewing at the peak.
The European football championship is of less worldwide interest, hence the
lower starting price.
As part of the package for this summer's event, the association is also
appointing an outside agency, Roar Marketing and Promotions, to assist the
exclusive sponsor in developing wider commercial spin-offs.
Roar will provide the sponsor with ideas and strategies for such additional
marketing devices as in-store promotions and merchandising of products
connecting the sponsoring company with the event.
Sponsorship in the UK last year amounted to about Pounds 350m, with Pounds
250m of that accounted for by sponsorship of sports events. Although
broadcasting sponsorship accounted for only Pounds 15m last year, that was
twice 1990's figure.
Mr Alan Chilton, head of the association's sponsorship committee, believes
that figure will grow to Pounds 40m annually by 1996.
According to figures from the association, Sony had reason to be pleased
with its rugby sponsorship; spontaneous brand awareness of Sony apparently
rose by 8 points to 61 per cent among viewers of the event.
The association emphasises the value of sponsorship by pointing to some
unforeseen advertising benefits gained by Sony in its sponsorship of the
Rugby World Cup.
Although Sony was only a sponsor of the ITV coverage, the association
discovered that many viewers thought Sony had directly sponsored the event.
To the chagrin of those companies which had directly sponsored it -
including Heinz UK, Ricoh UK and Societe Generale - 39 per cent of ITV's
viewers believed they had seen Sony's advertising boards around the ground,
although no such boards existed.
