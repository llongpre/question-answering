   Police arrested 30 people in
Cape Town on Saturday during two protests against a controversial
rugby tour by a squad of international all-stars.
   The demonstrations, held hours before the start of a match, were
part of a nationwide anti-apartheid campaign launched Aug. 2 to
protest segregation and the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, which
exclude the black majority.
   In other developments, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu sent
letters to four Western leaders, including President Bush,
describing the almost daily unrest this month in black and
mixed-race townships outside Cape Town.
   And the country's two largest anti-apartheid labor federations
met near Johannesburg to discuss strategies for opposing laws that
limit worker rights.
   Twenty eight demonstrators were arrested at a hotel in Cape Town
after meeting briefly with Willie John McBride, manager of the
international squad made up of Australian, French and British
players.
   Several demonstrators carried posters that read ``Mercenaries Go
Home'' and ``Apartheid Tour Must Stop.''
   Two activists also were arrested when about 30 protesters
gathered outside the main Cape Town branch of First National Bank,
sponsor of the rugby tour. Bank officials said they have received
several bomb threats in recent days.
   The activists were identified as Dawood Khan, a spokesman for the
Western Cape Traders Association, and Willie Hofmeyer, a leader of
the banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition.
   Police on Friday banned all rallies in protest of the tour. The
international team's visit has been denounced by activists as a
breach of a sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid.
   The International XV squad, whose tour was approved by the
International Rugby Board, already has played two matches in South
Africa. But Saturday's contest was the first against the South
African national squad, the Springboks.
   Rugby is the most popular team sport among white South Africans,
who believe their squad would be the best in the world if allowed to
compete regularly on an international level.
   Saturday's match, which the Springboks won 20-19, marked the
first international competition for the South African team since a
New Zealand team made an unsanctioned ``rebel tour'' in 1986.
   In most sports, the world governing bodies have barred South
Africans from international competition because of apartheid.
However, the degree of sanctions varies in each sport.
   South Africa has not been allowed to compete in the Olympics
since 1960, and generally its amateur teams have difficulty playing
abroad or attracting visitors. In professional sports, South Africa
often lures foreign competitors with huge sums of money in cricket,
boxing, golf and tennis.
   British cricket players have agreed to a tour in January even
though they will face an automatic five-year suspension from
international competition. South Africa also stages an annual golf
tournament with a $1 million first prize _ the largest of any
tournament _ and consistenly draws top players.
   Tutu's spokesman, John Allen, declined to release details of the
letters. But he said Tutu mailed them to Bush, British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, French President Francois Mitterand and
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The clashes between activists and police have escalated steadily
since the launch of the defiance campaign and police blamed two
deaths Friday on rioters.
   The two labor federations that met Saturday _ the Congress of
South African Trade Unions with 900,000 members, and the smaller
National Council of Trade Unions _ have said they make take protest
action before the elections.
   Gen. Hennie de Witt, the police commissioner, imposed tight
restrictions on the meetings, allowing only union members to attend,
prohibiting political banners, and restricting discussions to labor
issues.
   Dozens of police armed with shotguns and tear gas were present at
the meeting attended by 800 delegates.
