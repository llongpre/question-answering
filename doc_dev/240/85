Complaining about the umpire or referee is one of sport's most enduring
traditions. In whatever game, at whatever level, the man charged with the
duty of judgment finds himself the scapegoat for everyone else's rage and
disappointment.
On the village green, the opening bat stares with theatrical disbelief at
the man in the white coat who has had the nerve to give him out lbw, then
stalks off, muttering and expostulating. I have seen a ref who disallowed a
goal in a Slough Industrial League Division Three soccer match knocked to
the ground for his troubles. At Wimbledon, a tennis official in a panama hat
is expected to smile politely on his stool while some oafish super-ego
swears at him over a foot fault.
But in no game, I would suggest, is the lot of the referee more difficult
than in rugby union. He has to put up with all the abuse and unpleasantness
which law enforcement provokes in any game. But in addition, the
interpretation of laws and the detection of infringement is particularly
difficult in rugby.
I know because I have done it, twice. Of the second occasion I can remember
little, except that it was disfigured by one of those ludicrous brawls which
are a time-honoured characteristic of coarse rugby. I brought it to an end -
rather brilliantly, I thought by lifting one of the protagonists off the
ground by his collar.
The first, though, was a fiasco from start to finish. I was somewhat
handicapped because I had left my spectacles in the changing room, which
meant that everything happening more than 20 yards from me was little more
than a blur. But the chief problem was that, even when I was on hand for
ruck or maul or scrum, I could not work out what was going on.
Amid the churning mass of bodies, the ball was sometimes visible, sometimes
not. At any moment, it seemed that almost everyone was committing some kind
of offence. This presented me with a choice between non-stop whistle-blowing
 -necessitating an instant choice of whose illegality was the grossest - and
quiescent inactivity.
I varied erratically between these two courses, and thus fell into
disrepute. Whatever I did was wrong, and the entire match unfolded to the
accompaniment of an incessant chorus of complaint. Bereft of authority, I
became disillusioned and a sad hate-figure on a dank Sunday afternoon. At
the end, my own team secured ignoble victory with a try which came - so my
own chums cheerfully confided to me afterwards - from a pass which was a
good yard-and-a-half forward.
I did not know the rules, of course. Nor was I in a minority at the lowly
level at which I played. We may have had a vague apprehension of the guiding
principles which informed the code. But of the detail we were appallingly
ignorant. And even when we did know a particular rule, we had no inhibition
about breaking it, nor about protesting long and loud if we were detected.
Now the laws are even more complicated than they were then, and the game is
afflicted more than ever by this combination of ignorance and wilful
lawlessness. And who gets the blame for the resulting shambles? Is it the
players, who trample on the rules, or the lawmakers who dreamt them up? No,
it is the man charged with enforcing them.
Thus we had the preposterous spectacle of the players from Bath and Wasps
excoriating the referee for ruining what should have been one of the
showpieces of the last league season. His crime was that he had had the
nerve to whistle up for a mere 48 out of the uncountable offences committed
during 80 minutes of ill-natured anarchy.
Pity the poor ref. It is not his fault that the game should have sunk into a
grey swamp of well-intentioned but unenforceable regulations; nor that
players at all levels should have become so expert in exploiting the
vulnerability of his position. The miracle is that rugby union should still
be capable of producing moments of clean, incomparable exhilaration. The
almost hysterical ecstasy which greeted Underwood's try against Wales,
Geoghehan's against England, Quinnell's against France in the last batch of
home internationals, is dire evidence of their rarity and the unhappy pass
this great game has got itself into.
