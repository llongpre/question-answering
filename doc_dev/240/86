We are on our way out, men. Our Dunkirk looms. Our irrelevance grows more
visible day by day. I am amazed at the speed of the distaff revolution: at
how quickly the seething mass of womankind has inveigled itself into
position for its attack on mankind.
First we had millions of years of progressive and sensible evolution, during
which we made our dispositions and thrashed out our gender roles. Then we
had feminism, which was initially quite cute, smacking, as it did, of
fairness and equality. Then - just like that - we were into post-feminism.
Do you remember that? It was over in a trice. Now men are facing their final
gory hour - the age of machisma.
Evidence? There is tons of it. My week started badly with a report, in The
Times, by Sally Jones, that well-known snoopy-drawers, on the horrible
success of English female sporting teams. 'Why can't our men be more like
our women?' was how the termagant Jones kicked-off her report, and on it
went from there.
Apparently, the English women's rugby team recently won the world
championship. Apparently, last summer, the English women's cricket team won
the World Cup. Apparently, the English women's football team has reached the
quarter-finals of the European championship without losing a game. All of
this, of course, in contrast to the various English men's teams, which are
not worth a toss.
I am too much the gent to describe the crop-haired, jetty-jawed,
quaking-thighed, punch-you-in-the-mouth monstrosities that play in women's
sports teams, especially England's.
But I confess I was driven to tears by the whingeing that the Jones creature
insinuated into her report, alongside the triumphalism. Apparently, sponsors
are uncommonly hard to find for women's sport. Apparently, it cost each
England female rugby player an estimated Pounds 6,000 to take part in the
world championship and the internationals that preceded it.
Not that this will last. The way things are going, female sports stars will
soon be awash in sponsorship money. The day of the first Pounds 1m lipstick
endorsement is not far away. Male sports stars, in contrast, will be
stripped of their contracts, denuded of their glamour, marginalised and
humiliated by the suddenly swelling horde of female sports writers: killers
all, I have met quite a few.
The second vicious experience of my unpleasant week was to be traumatised by
Maureen Freely's exploitative novel, Under the Vulcania, published by
Bloomsbury, whose name, as you know, is synonymous with shame. I can hardly
bring myself to explain what Vulcania is about; can hardly sit here at the
screen, typing these words, without falling into a froth. But I think I have
to try, if only to bolster my claim that the age of machisma has entered its
dawn-time.
Vulcania is a palace of pleasure, set on a sculpted hilltop, attended by
women - businesswomen, housewives - in order to recharge their batteries
with personal servicing by discreet and well-muscled male undergraduates.
I will not describe what goes on in the Rough Trader Saloon, the Hard-On
Cafe or the cubicles of the Roman Baths. Suffice it to say that Under the
Vulcania is scandalously voyeuristic, with no redeeming social or cultural
values. The men are playthings, without dignity or feelings, to be used -
and used again - and then cast away.
The week's third incident was the falling into my hands of yet another book:
Deadlier than the Male: Violence and Aggression in Women, by Alix Kirsta,
from HarperCollins. Whereas Vulcania is just pornography, Deadlier than the
Male is dynamite.
It is a study of female anger, violence, hate and criminality. It is the
first book, says the publisher, 'in which a woman dares to challenge the
most persistent and cherished images of her own sex. Drawing on recent
sensational criminal cases, diverse academic research and extensive personal
interviews with violent women, Alix Kirsta probes the blackest recesses of
the female psyche. The resulting revelations about women's aggressive
instincts (are) chilling and shocking . . . In demonstrating that women have
as great a capacity as men for destructiveness, she ensures that our view of
women can never be the same again.'
It is all quite clear, men. We are heading for the chop. Will we go quietly?
I maintain that we should.
