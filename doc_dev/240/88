rife - The region's top sport derives from Great Britain

The taxi driver from Castres is silent as he steers his Renault along the
road to Toulouse. Silent, that is, until mention of the word rugby.
'Thousands of us went to Paris for the championship final last year,' he
says proudly, before launching into a scrum-by-tackle analysis of the
victory over Grenoble.
It is a familiar topic in the Midi-Pyrenees. Mr Michel Castel, the mayor of
Albi, becomes visibly excited when the sport crops up in conversation. From
then on, investment strategies and the prospects of his Socialist party are
described in terms of teamwork, tries and conversions. Professor Remy Pech
of Toulouse-Mirail University, author of a book on the history of rugby, is
similarly animated by the subject. A former player himself, he describes how
his father would cycle 150km from Narbonne to watch the regional final in
Toulouse.
Such a common enthusiasm in such an ostensibly disparate group of characters
reflects the importance of rugby in the region. 'All the people here care
about rugby,' says Prof Pech. 'It provides a powerful social bond at every
level, from quartier to village, town and city.'
It has done so for the best part of a century. News of the game travelled
east from Bordeaux in the 1890s and quickly took root in the Midi-Pyrenees.
As in Bordeaux, there was an important British influence in the birth of the
game. For example, Higgens, the captain of one of the first Toulouse teams
was the son of the British consul.
The expansion of the sport was rapid. From urban teams based on professions,
notably vets and miners, rugby passed to villages and rural districts.
Schools, according to Mr Pech, played a valuable role in rugby's
dissemination throughout the region.
The reasons behind the rise of rugby in the Midi-Pyrenees are as numerous as
the local teams. For Mr Castel, the sport gives expression to the character
of the region's inhabitants. 'It combines our Latin fire with the sense of
teamwork and community,' he says. 'Rugby accommodates all types of people,
from the large powerful forwards to the smaller fast wingers. When you look
around the street, you can imagine a position for everyone.'
The amateur status of the sport, and the strict rules which govern it, have
also encouraged strong ties with the local communities. Mr Labbe, treasurer
of the Stade Toulouse rugby club, points out that, unlike in soccer, it is
extremely difficult to transfer rugby players from one club to another. The
players must have a licence to represent their team and this requires a job
or a student certificate. As a result, teams are largely comprised of local
players.
There are exceptions. Rob Andrew, the England captain, played for Toulouse
in 1992-1993. Emile N'Tmack, the quicksilver Toulouse three-quarter who also
plays for the French national team, came originally from the east of France.
Such exceptions, however, tend to confirm the rule. Andrew had to find a job
with a local company. The Toulouse club helped relocate N'Tmack's brother
and mother when he decided to join them.
Despite its strict codes and amateur status, the attraction of the game is
strengthened by the social and economic opportunities it provides. Laurence
Spanghero, one of six rugby-playing brothers in an Italian immigrant family,
used his fame on the rugby pitch to develop his Cassoulet food empire. A
local government representative in the Pyrenean town of Tarbes refers to
employment advertisements in which rugby skills are cited as an advantage
for applicants.
Unsurprisingly, given the level of local support for the sport, the region
has emerged as a powerhouse of French rugby. Many of France's leading teams,
from Castres to Colomiers and from Toulouse to Tarbes, come from the
Midi-Pyrenees.
While Castres claimed the championship last year, Stade Toulouse look good
for the 1994 title. Training in the Stade des Sept Deniers, the players work
together as a slick unit. In the play-offs, they have already overcome an
important hurdle by beating local rivals Colomiers by 32-12. Should they go
all the way to the trophy, their exploits will provide any conversation that
is needed in the taxis of Toulouse.
