BY ANY standards, New Zealand is one of the great achievers in world sport.
Its roll call of world champions and record holders, now and in the past, is
impressive and out of all proportion to what might reasonably be expected
from a country of only 3.3m people.
Its medal haul at the last few Olympics has been impressive. On a medal per
population basis it exceeded that of any other country, putting this small
south Pacific nation in the forefront of international sport.
It has also achieved great success in non-Olympic sports such as the
Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race, where in the last event, after 24,000
gruelling miles, New Zealand yachts fought out an exciting climax to finish
first and second.
International sports administrators and athletes sometimes ask why such a
small country, with a population fewer than many large cities, excels in
such a wide variety of sports, both as individuals and in team events.
New Zealanders take their sports seriously. When the national rugby team,
the All Blacks, were beaten in the semi-final of last year's Rugby World
Cup, millions of words were written and hours of television time were
devoted to analysing the defeat in minute detail.
Retribution was also swift. The selectors, coach, assistant coach, captain
and several senior players - all deemed to have let their country down -
were dropped.
In a few weeks, New Zealanders will vote in a referendum to determine the
method of selecting future governments. Fewer than one in 1,000 voters knows
the meaning of the referendum alternatives. By contrast, only one in 10,000
does not know that the All Blacks were beaten by Australia by only one point
in early July.
This means that every child and adult in the country has access to ample
facilities in any sport they choose. People of all ages are actively
encouraged through government-backed community service TV advertising to
'have a go' and participate in some sporting activity.
Other aspects of the New Zealand lifestyle and environment help to encourage
sporting prowess. The country's clean air, congenial climate, good quality
housing, easy access to beach, bush and countryside, outdoor living and
plenty of healthy food - even for the less well-off  - all provide a solid
base to encourage and develop sporting ability.
The shoreline is the fifth largest in the world. With its numerous natural
harbours, lakes and rivers, this is an ideal environment for water sports.
The colourful sight of thousands of yachts on the sprawling Auckland harbour
on summer weekends has earned it the title of City of Sails. Children aged
10 to 12, in specially designed small yachts, have their own competition
races. These help to develop their skill from an early age.
At the last two Olympics, New Zealand won several medals in yachting,
canoeing, kayaking and sailboard riding. It has been a major competitor in
the Whitbread Race and in the America's Cup.
One big disadvantage for world class New Zealand sportsmen or teams is
distance. To compete in the northern hemisphere or the US where most world
championships are staged is costly in time and money.
To send the country's equestrian team to the Barcelona Olympics will cost
more than NZDollars 250,000 (Pounds 80,000). Teenage girls, members of the
hundreds of pony clubs around New Zealand, have contributed to the team's
fund-raising. This is one sport in which the country has high hopes of
winning a medal. The team includes Mark Todd, a champion rider hoping to
gain his third successive gold medal.
The cost of sending the full Olympic team of 138 athletes will be more than
NZDollars 3m (Pounds 1m).
Without financial support, topline individuals or sporting bodies would not
be able to compete in international events to the same extent as they do
now. Helping to meet some of the costs is the Hillary Commission, a
government-appointed body which this year has NZDollars 24m from lottery
profits to fund sporting organisations.
While some of the funds will help to finance the Olympic team, a
considerable amount of money is spread widely to encourage all types of
sporting and leisure activity. Each year, hundreds of organisations benefit.
Some grants are modest to help local sports club acquire or build better
facilities. Grants can range from helping to build a new mountain hut for
alpine climbers to providing equipment for a rural softball team.
The major objective is to encourage all New Zealanders of all ages to
participate in some form of sporting or leisure activity. For continuing
sporting success, particularly against larger, wealthier nations, has given
New Zealanders confidence and a sense of self-respect.
