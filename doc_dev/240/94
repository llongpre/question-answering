<LEADPARA>  Saturday's championship match in the Palo Alto Summer Seven-Aside Rugby
Tournament at the old Cubberly High in Palo Alto may not rival the Super Bowl,
but within rugby circles, it's pretty important.;    "This is how a lot of
young players get introduced to rugby," said Frank Merrill, the tournament's
co-director. "Playing 15-aside is confusing sometimes to people who have never
played before. Sevens is a lot easier."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And more popular. The tournament draws between 32 and 36 teams from Chico
to Los Angeles. Several area teams, including favorites Palo Alto XOs,
Stanford, the Old Blues of Berkeley and the Monterey Bay Rebels, compete.;   
The tournament, which began in 1968, decides the only seven-aside championship
each year in Northern California, Merrill said. Getting to the title match
isn't easy. Prior to Saturday, teams played three to five matches each on July
13, July 20 and last Saturday.;    The top two teams from those three days of
competition meet in the title match at approximately 4 p.m. That match will
decide the tournament's Dalgety Cup, which features teams with winning records
over the first three days. Teams with losing records over those days will
compete for the Tyler Cup. Action begins Saturday at 8:30 a.m.  </TEXT>
