TODAY'S historic rugby match between England and South Africa continued to
be dogged by controversy when it emerged last night that Mr John Major had
cancelled plans to attend the game.
Mr Major had been expected to accompany South African president F W de
Klerk, who arrived in London yesterday, after talks with him in the morning.
Yesterday, rugby authorities tried to defuse a row over national anthems.
They said only God Save the Queen would be played today and not Die Stem
(The Voice). The decision was taken after objections by the African National
Congress that Die Stem was too closely associated with the ruling National
party and the policy of apartheid. A decision to play neither anthem was
revoked in the face of protest by English fans.
Downing Street officials said last night no announcement about Mr Major's
attendance had been made. The prime minister had a heavy official and
private programme over the weekend, including his daughter's 21st birthday
party, and that was the only reason he was not going to the match.
However, angry South African rugby officials made clear they had been
expecting Mr Major to be Mr de Klerk's host. Mr Peter Brooke, heritage
secretary, is expected to take his place.
Mr Major's decision is likely to be seen by Pretoria as a snub, though
Downing Street stressed that any such interpretation would be 'ludicrous'.
An official pointed out that Mr Major would be driving from his Huntingdon
constituency for today's meeting.
The importance of the occasion for South Africa was highlighted in a speech
last night by Mr de Klerk who hailed it as a symbol, 'perhaps more than any
other . . . (of) the restoration of normal relations between South Africa
and the United Kingdom'.
The game is the first between the two sides at Twickenham since 1969.
