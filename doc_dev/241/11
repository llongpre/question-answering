BUCKINGHAM Palace is to be opened to the public for the first time this
summer, prompted by royal glasnost and financial prudence. Fees paid by
visitors will help to pay for the restoration of Windsor Castle after the
fire last November.
The palace will open from the second week of August for about two months,
with an adult entrance fee of Pounds 8, Pounds 5.50 for people over 60 and
Pounds 4 for those under 17.
Over the next five years, the revenues, plus a new Pounds 3 entrance charge
for Windsor, will pay for 70 per cent of the estimated Pounds 30m to Pounds
40m repair bill for fire damage at Windsor, Mr Peter Brooke, national
heritage secretary, said yesterday. The rest will be paid by the state.
Visitors to Buckingham Palace will be able to see 17 state rooms, gardens
and the west elevation. They will not be allowed into the private quarters
of the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh or Prince Edward, or into working
offices.
The palace would not speculate on how many visitors it expected. Some 40,000
people already visit the palace each year by personal invitation of the
Queen. But if the final bill for the restoration of Windsor totals Pounds
40m, the equivalent of 3.5m adult visitors will be required to cover the
monarchy's 70 per cent share.
The public opening of the palace - first built in 1677 - will be a
short-lived affair. The gates will probably be closed again by the end of
1997, when the restoration of Windsor should be complete.
A palace spokesman said the entrance fees were arrived at after considering
charges at 'similar types of attraction'.
Two of the Queen's private residences - Buckingham Palace is owned by the
nation - are already open for limited periods of the year. Sandringham
charges Pounds 3 for adults, Pounds 2 for children; Balmoral is cheaper, at
Pounds 1.75 for adults and free for children.
The palace, however, is priced above competing London attractions, which
admittedly lack its exclusiveness.
Adults pay Pounds 7.40 at Madame Tussaud's waxwork museum (owned, like the
Financial Times, by Pearson), Pounds 6 for the London Dungeon, and Pounds
4.50 for the Natural History Museum.
But the White House is open year round at no charge, and imperial residences
in Japan, such as Kyoto Imperial Palace and three other imperial villas, are
open year round (except weekends and public holidays). They make no charge,
but visitors must carry their passports.
Around Europe several other official royal residences are already open. In
Madrid, the Palacio Real - about Pta600 (Pounds 3) - is open all year, as is
the Netherlands' Royal Palace in Amsterdam, and the small Palais du Prince -
about FFr50 (Pounds 6) - in Monaco.
