In the age of the photograph, the uses of the work of art as a thing of
topographical or architectural record may often be overlooked, but the
argument remains. In matters of particular emphasis and annotation, and of
personal experience and response, the drawing or painting may take on a
selective authority which the supposedly all-seeing camera can seldom match.
There was Turner, watching from the river as the old Houses of Parliament
went up in flames: there was Paul Sandby, noting down the informal daily
life of the Windsor Castle of the later 18th century: there too, under
darker neo-romantic skies, was John Piper, seeing the Castle in wartime
through more dramatic eyes - 'you don't seem to have had much luck with the
weather, Mr Piper', remarked the King.
The great fire at Windsor Castle, late in 1992, touched a national, indeed
an universal nerve, as the image went round the world of one of the great
monuments and symbols of nationhood about to be, so it seemed, destroyed. No
doubt, in its aftermath, every single square inch of the damage has been
dutifully photographed, but how good it is to learn that an artist,
Alexander Creswell, was also called in to make more subjective, perhaps, but
no less pertinent a record.
The damaged part of the Castle, he tells us, 'had been wrapped in plastic
sheeting . . . isolated from the world . . . enshrouded. The sun filtered
through from above . . . The plastic sheeting rustled . . . pigeons flapped
around somewhere above . . . tourists gazed in . . . a band struck up in the
Quadrangle, the tunes echoing round the empty walls, distorted and remote .
. . The damage inside the Castle had created a fantasy, a ghost of a
palatial interior.' Ruins are familiar enough to all of us, but it is the
freshness of ruin and devastation that is so shocking: 'it was cold and
sepulchral in the Castle, the rubble giving off a stench of black rot.'
We see what he means. It is, of course, the documentary and circumstantial
content of these dozen or so watercolours, commissioned for the Royal
Collection, that will give them their immediate reclame, and it has to be
said that at this first level they are immediately effective and satisfying.
The mood is appropriately doom-laden and tragical, the perspectives looming
and dramatic, the significant detail  - the skeletal rafters, the isolated
malachite vase, a corner of gothic tracery, an empty frame - well-chosen and
well-observed.
But they are better than that, something more than of merely superficial
interest and indulgence. A good story, after all, can bear the bad telling:
told well, we are hardly aware of the telling at all. And Creswell does the
business very well indeed, working with a freedom yet sureness of touch, and
a simple, confident authority in the setting up of his composition, that
together mark him out as a true painter, not just a reasonably efficient
note-taker and recorder.
For it is never the image alone, and what it represents, that makes the work
of interest as art, but always the way it is done - the command of the
medium, the direct, physical engagement with surface and material, the sense
of adventure and discovery and an element of risk. Creswell's sketchbooks
even more than the full-dress paintings give us this picture of the true
artist, unselfconsciously absorbed in the subject.
There is in all this, however, something of a paradox and a word of warning.
Creswell is clearly a skilful painter, master of his chosen medium and his
favoured architectural subject-matter. That said, it may well be that so
strong and extraordinary was the experience afforded him by the devastation
of Windsor Castle, that there was nothing for it but for him to lose himself
and all his skill in the magnificent awfulness before him - which is
precisely why his Windsor work is so successful.
Is there is to the accompanying group of paintings, of great houses from
Rome to St Petersburg, something rather less of the intuitive excitement,
rather more of the mechanical and, dare I say, complacent? A few lines from
Basil Bunting's Briggflatts come to mind: 'It is time to consider how
Domenico Scarlatti/ condensed so much music into so few bars/ with never a
crabbed turn or congested cadence/ never a boast or a see-here . . .' But
the show is worth catching, the only pity that it has been on for so short a
time.
