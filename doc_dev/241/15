'Take the train to Windsor for an unforgettable day out' gushes NetWork
SouthEast's latest lavishly-illustrated poster. Among the attractions on the
poster, promoting cheap fares, is a cut-away drawing of Windsor Castle which
clearly depicts St George's Hall 'primarily used for banquets' and the
Waterloo Chamber which 'the Royal Family use for their Christmas pantomime'.
Bit odd, since both these imposing state rooms were all but destroyed in
last year's fire. British Rail would be providing the country with a better
service if it encouraged trippers to visit Buckingham Palace which has been
specially opened to raise money to repair Windsor Castle.
