   Mikhail Gorbachev today had lunch with
Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle and invited her to visit the
Soviet Union.
   Her office said the queen told Gorbachev she would like to
accept, but her foreign travel is fixed years in advance.
   She would be the first British sovereign to visit the Soviet
Union since the Russian royal family, her cousins, were murdered
after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
   ``Thanking Mr. Gorbachev, Her Majesty explained that the program
for her visits were fixed a number of years in advance. She hoped
it would be possible to visit the Soviet Union in due course,'' a
Buckingham Palace statement said.
   The announcement came as the Soviet leader left Windsor Castle
for London's Heathrow Airport to return home at the end of a
40-hour visit to Britain.
   Earlier, Gorbachev and his wife Raisa drove to the majestic
castle on the Thames River in drizzling rain.
   Maj. Nicholas Parsons invited the Kremlin leader in fluent
Russian to inspect a guard of honor of bearskin-capped Coldstream
Guards.
   The queen, in bright pink skirt and cape, and her husband,
Prince Philip, greeted her guests on the castle doorstep.
   Gorbachev was the first Soviet leader since 1967 to meet the
queen, and by putting the royal seal on his 40-hour visit to
Britain, he clearly hoped to enhance the benign image he is trying
to implant in Western minds.
   Windsor Castle, the palace 20 miles west of London, has been a
royal residence for more than 800 years, and the queen took the
Gorbachevs on a tour of some of its rooms and held a lunch in their
honor.
   The 34 guests, including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
her husband Denis, ate smoked salmon cornets filled with crabmeat,
layers of fillet of beef, duck puree and sliced artichoke, all
baked in pastry.
   Earlier today, Gorbachev delivered a major televised policy
speech in the oak-paneled, chandeliered splendor of Guildhall, for
800 years the seat of London city government.
   Like many of Britain's archaic institutions, the Guildhall's
power is more in its looks than in its powers. Like Queen Elizabeth
II, the Guildhall and its lord mayor are restricted largely to
ceremonial duties.
   The Gorbachevs arrived at the Guildhall in a 24-car motorcade
through the congested streets of the City, London's financial
district, where the lord mayor, Alderman Sir Christopher Collett,
waited, resplendent in black, gold-braided robes and three-corner
hat.
   Gorbachev was escorted into the building in a procession led by
the mayor, the sergeant at arms and officials bearing a sword and a
gold mace, symbol of city authority.
   A trumpet fanfare announced the Gorbachevs' entry into the hall,
and they stood beside Mrs. Thatcher and her husband Denis as the
Soviet and British anthems were played.
   An array of dignitaries packed the hall, ranging across the
political spectrum from Mrs. Thatcher through Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie to Bruce Kent, chairman of the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament.
   Pikemen, musketeers, sheriffs and city elders in blue robes
stood by to complete the pageant.
