<HEAD>Queen's Dog Dead After Windsor Castle Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dog belonging to Queen Elizabeth II died after
being bitten in a fight with other royal dogs at Windsor Castle,
Buckingham Palace said.
   Chipper, a 12-year-old cross between a dachshund and a corgi,
was involved in a fight started by Ranger, a corgi belonging to
Queen Mother Elizabeth, the palace said Friday.
   The crossbreed, known as a dorgi, was stitched up after the
fight by a veterinarian but died, the palace said.
   The queen was given a corgi by her parents in the 1930s when she
was a little princess. They became the royal family's most popular
house dogs because of their small size but palace staff and
visitors say the dogs tend to snap at ankles.
   Princess Margaret, the queen's sister, preferred dachshunds.
