<HEAD>British Crown Jewels Hidden in Lake in World War II, Newspaper

   The most precious gems among Britain's crown
jewels were hidden in a lake at Windsor Castle during World War II
to keep them out of German hands if the country was invaded, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Sunday Telegraph said the only people who knew of the hiding
place were King George VI, who chose it, and Sir Owen Morshead, his
librarian.
   The king, father of Queen Elizabeth II, died in 1952 and
Morshead in 1977.
   The newspaper said that in 1940, when a German invasion was
anticipated, the king ordered the royal jewelers to take the gems
from the Tower of London to Windsor Castle, about 20 miles west of
London.
   The king and Morshead then wrenched the most important gems out
of their settings with pliers and other tools provided by a
chauffeur, according to the newspaper.
   ``The gems, including the Koh-i-Noor diamond, were then wrapped
in cotton wool, placed in a tin and submerged in one of the lakes
at Windsor. There they remained until the defeat of Germany and for
a long time only the king and Sir Owen knew,'' wrote the
newspaper's anonymous columnist, Mandrake.
   The Koh-i-Noor is an Indian diamond of 108 carats presented to
Queen Victoria in 1849. Its name means Mountain of Light.
   The wartime hiding place of the jewels, which today are on
public display at the Tower of London, has always been a mystery in
Britain.
   But the Sunday Telegraph said it had discovered that the facts
were revealed in 1972 in a book that was never translated from
French _ a biography of the military leader Jean-Marie Lattre de
Tassigny by his widow, Simonne.
   The newspaper said it was told of the story by Lattre de
Tassigny's British aide, John Saint-Clair Smallwood, who said he
accompanied the general and his wife on a visit to Windsor in 1949
at Morshead's invitation. Smallwood said Morshead related the
secret to them as they gazed out of the castle windows onto the
grounds where there was a round pond.
   According to the newspaper, Smallwood related that Morshead said
the king told him the crown jewels represented ``the honors and the
kingdom of England'' and must not fall into German hands.
   The report did not say where the crown jewel settings were kept
during the war.
   Most of the crown jewels date from the restoration of the
monarchy after the death of Oliver Cromwell, who overthrew King
Charles I and died in 1658. Cromwell had the original crown jewels
sold or melted.
