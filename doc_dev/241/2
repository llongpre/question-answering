Senior officers of the royal household responsible for the Pounds 20m of
taxpayers' money spent each year on Buckingham Palace and other residences
occupied by the Queen and her family face closer scrutiny by MPs.
A report by the Commons public accounts committee published yesterday
rejects voluntary arrangements under which information about the use of the
money is made available.
It calls for 'public visibility' of the Pounds 20m a year of public money
involved, with the National Audit Office having an automatic right of access
to the relevant documents.
The committee recommends that the royal household should be required to
publish an annual report and accounts, instead of merely having to submit
them to the Department of National Heritage.
It concludes that there is 'no objection to placing the officials of the
royal household under comparable systems of scrutiny and control to public
servants when dealing with public money'.
Apart from Buckingham Palace the Pounds 20m is used in connection with
Kensington Palace, St James's Palace, Clarence House and Marlborough House
Mews, Windsor Castle, Windsor Great and Home parks, and Hampton Court Mews
and Paddock.
Members of the committee were critical of the arrangements for administering
the net income from public admissions to Buckingham Palace and Windsor
Castle - expected to amount to Pounds 25m in the next four years.
The money, which will go towards the cost of restoring the parts of Windsor
Castle severely damaged by fire in 1992, is administered by Royal Collection
Enterprises.
Mr Michael Peat, director of finance and property services in the royal
household, denied having censured Mr Robert Sheldon, the former Labour
minister and chairman of the committee, for wanting to study the accounts.
Mr Peat likened the decision of Royal Collection Enterprises to give money
towards the restoration of Windsor Castle to a charitable donation.
