FT  03 DEC 92 / Letter: Attitude on castle style 'amazing'

<TEXT>
Sir, Your architectural correspondent applauded ('A foolish plan to reinvent
Windsor', November 30) the renovation of run-down Windsor Castle by its
'complete transformation' in the 1820s by Jeffrey Wyatville in the style of
his time.
However, he then declared himself amazed that the Royal Institute of British
Architects has reacted to the fire at Windsor Castle by suggesting that a
distinguished architect of today should also respond to the fire in the
style of his time.
