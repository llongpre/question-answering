It often seems to me that architecture is sometimes taken much too
seriously. Sides are taken and battle lines are drawn in a fashion that
often looks ridiculous to anyone outside the profession. Do you really care
whether or not a design is modern, post-modern, gothic or classical? What
matters is whether or not the design is good. One of the subjects that
currently arouses ire and passion in equal doses in the breasts of
architects is the future of the damaged wing of Windsor Castle.
That esteemed organ, Country Life, which now seems to be all set under its
new editorial team to become the journal of imagination when it comes to
architectural and environmental issues, has just launched an important
international competition for designs for the rebuilding of the fire-damaged
areas of Windsor Castle. The reason for mentioning this in this column is
principally because it is open to anyone - artists, interior designers, 'and
anyone else who feels qualified to comment'. This sounds a brilliant idea
because there are many of us who have maintained for a long time that
architects do not necessarily have the monopoly of architectural ideas.
The other reason why the Windsor competition could be very important
(although impossible to judge) is that it may concentrate minds on the
debate about the appropriate way to treat historic buildings. The only
problem with this competition is the nature of the jury. For some reason,
presumably to excite international interest, Country Life seems to have lost
its traditional nerve and gone for trendy names on its jury - as well as
some deadbeat modernists who are known to be deeply prejudiced against
history itself. But far be it from a mere architecture critic to put anyone
off entering a competition because of the composition of the jury. After
all, this competition does deal with a fascinating and important
architectural problem. The key thing to remember is that it is open to
anyone.
The competition brief is available from Country Life Windsor Castle
Competition, Winkfield, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 2EH. Telephone: 0344 890080.
There is an entry fee of Pounds 10 and a very modest prize of Pounds 1000.
The closing date is June 10.
The Architecture Foundation is another ginger group that is keen to get on
the Windsor Castle bandwagon. It has commissioned several practising
architects, mainly but not entirely of a modernist persuasion, to come up
with a new design for the interior of the damaged St. George's Hall. These
will be exhibited shortly at the Architecture Foundation and published in a
forthcoming book about Windsor Castle by Dr Mark Girouard.
When it comes to architectural tradition there always has been a
comparatively unsung group of architects and craftsmen in England quietly
working away building and designing things that are usually ignored by the
architectural press. What these unsung heroes generally achieve is very
happy clients and plenty of work. They are free of the vagaries of fashion
and mercifully outside the intense and often meaningless international
debate. One of these architects is Roderick Gradidge, who has recently
completed an ingenious scheme for St. Edmund's College, Cambridge.
The college is situated on Mount Pleasant - the part of Cambridge that marks
the commencement of the line of new colleges that proceed to the west of the
city. It was founded as St. Edmund's House by the 15th Duke of Norfolk in
1896 as a residence for Roman Catholic clergy studying for degrees. Since
1965 the college has been an approved graduate college and now has some 150
students from 30 countries. The early gabled red brick, turn of the century
buildings are without any particular distinction and to unify and extend
them was a not inconsiderable challenge for the architect. For a long time
Gradidge has taken a pioneering interest in the history of Edwardian
architecture - his work at the National Portrait Gallery in London and his
more recent restoration of the Guildhall at Northampton shows a
knowledgeable enthusiasm for Edwardian and Gothic interiors.
At Cambridge Gradidge had little opportunity to provide decorative
interiors. Instead he has designed a striking brick tower some six storeys
high to mark the entrance to the college. At the top of this tower is the
Okinaga Room, named after the benefactor (Dr S. Okinaga the President of
Teikyo University, Japan). This is the highest room in Cambridge and has
remarkable views over the whole city. The style of the tower has been
described by the architect as 'streamlined Tudor'. It is built of buff brick
with a slate roof and has some well carved heraldry in the brickwork (by
Richard Kindersley). The tower has succeeded in centering the plan of the
college, giving it a prominent entrance and literally raising its profile in
Cambridge. Gradidge worked throughout the scheme with the Charter
Partnership.
Shades of Tudor and Gothic revivals are clearly in the air with attention
focused on the fate of the unrepaired Albert Memorial in London's Kensington
Gardens, which is now a neglected victim of government parsimony. There is
an argument for putting Albert into a glass case but a public appeal for
funds looks more likely. That will be a real test of the national enthusiasm
for the Gothic - and the recent news that passengers from the Channel Tunnel
trains are now going to arrive at St. Pancras gives Railway Gothic a sudden
international dimension.
I would like to see architect Michael Hopkins put in charge of the
replanning of the station, as he has the rare skill of understanding and
adding to the past without any hint of nostalgia or pastiche. He would also
provide ample evidence to our visitors from Europe that although we love the
Gothic we are not totally smothered by Gothic gloom. Next year's exhibition
at the Victoria and Albert Museum devoted to the life and work of Pugin will
show once and for all how Gothic architecture and design can marry
structural ingenuity with colour and decoration in a way that many
contemporary architects still find difficult to contemplate, let alone
achieve.
