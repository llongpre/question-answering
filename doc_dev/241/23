<LEADPARA>  Is she or isn't she the world's richest woman? And should she or shouldn't she
pay taxes on her income, just like everyone else? Those brash questions about
Queen Elizabeth II were raised in Parliament this week by Liberal Party Member
of Parliament Simon Hughes, in a move that reflected the opinion of a majority
of citizens.;    More than 70 percent of the British, polls show, believe her
income should be subject to taxes. Or as Hughes put it, "When so many people
in my (London) constituency are scraping along and asked to contribute tax on
very low incomes, it seems grossly unfair that the person with the highest
income escapes. And there's no reason a modern constitutional monarch
shouldn't pay taxes."  </LEADPARA>

ESTIMATES PLACE MONARCH'S WEALTH AT $7.4

<TEXT>     The queen's personal net worth has long been a matter of considerable
speculation and argument, since, unlike U.S. heads of state, she is not
required to make public the amount of her wealth and she has not volunteered
the information. Estimates range on the high side -- Fortune magazine
estimates it at $7.4 billion, with an annual income of perhaps $3 million a
day; Buckingham Palace snorts that such a sum is "grossly exaggerated." There
also is a more modest estimate that her income is $35 million annually.;   
Over the years, researchers have tried to estimate the queen's personal
capital and income. Those assets are different from the institutions of the
monarchy, including the crown jewels in the Tower of London and the official
residences of Buckingham Castle, Windsor Castle, and Holyrood Castle.;    As
far as current official income goes, she receives from the British government
-- in what is called the Civil List -- 7.9 million pounds, or about $12.5
million. That sum is much more than her royal household expenses, giving her a
comfortable surplus this year. (Her employees, incidentally, pay taxes on
their salaries.);    But the queen has other major resources: Whatever money
she inherited from her father, King George VI; a vault full of precious jewels
-- crowns, tiaras, diamonds, rubies, emeralds; Faberge eggs; and the royal art
collection with 900 Leonardo Da Vinci drawings, 26 Van Dycks and works by
other masters. There is also one of the world's most valuable stamp
collections.;    Further, she owns hundreds of thousands of prime agricultural
acres, as well as valuable property in central London. Then there are Balmoral
and Sandringham castles with 64,000 acres between them. Not to be forgotten
are the royal stud farms and stables.;    The queen's major source of income
may be her private investments, which have accrued tax-free over a long
period. In 1971, to quiet speculation, the palace let it be known that her
investment portfolio in stock shares did not exceed 50 million pounds.;   
Taking an even lower figure of 35 million pounds, Andrew Morton, author of
"Theirs Is the Kingdom: The Wealth of the Windsors," consulted experts who
estimated that, if reasonably wisely invested, the portfolio would be worth
600 million pounds today. He estimates the queen's personal wealth at 1.2
billion pounds.  </TEXT>
