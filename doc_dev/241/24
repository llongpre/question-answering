Britain's royal family can sleep soundly again; the financial headache of
how to pay for the restoration of the fire-ravaged Windsor Castle could soon
be over, thanks to piles of the black stuff.
No, not coal - oil. According to an article in the Oil and Gas Journal, the
US oil industry's bible, Her Majesty could be sitting on top of one of
Britain's biggest onshore oilfields.
Desmond Oswald, boss of the little-known Canuk Exploration, has been poking
around underneath the castle for the past four years. He believes that as
many as 100m barrels of oil may be trapped in a reservoir which begins only
1,000 feet below the Castle. Little is known about Canuk, based in Gerrards
Cross, but other oil industry sources say the idea is not as barmy as it
sounds.
Oswald expresses surprise that 'such a large structure should have remained
undrilled in a country where extensive exploration has taken place'. Having
done his homework, he is now seeking a competent operator to contribute
financially to the drilling of an exploratory well.
Of course, the royals may not be amused at the thought of nodding donkeys
taking their place alongside the Household Cavalry. But times have changed.
Prince Edward has set himself up in the film business and his mum opened
Buckingham Palace to paying gogglers for a few weeks this summer. The
possibility of a gusher under Windsor Castle should not be ignored just
because it might keep the occupants awake at night.
