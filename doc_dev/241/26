FT  08 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Inquiry to probe royal fire
measures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to conduct an inquiry into the adequacy of fire protection
measures at all royal palaces under its control in the wake of last month's
conflagration at Windsor Castle.
Announcing the move in the Commons yesterday, Mr Peter Brooke, heritage
secretary, dismissed Labour claims that last week's report into the cause of
the Windsor fire was 'doctored'. Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow heritage secretary,
was 'casting doubt' on the Berkshire fire service by making such a claim, Mr
Brooke said.
It was not yet possible to put a precise cost on restoration work at
Windsor, he added, saying that estimates that repairs would cost Pounds 60m
were 'generated by the media'.
