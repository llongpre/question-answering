   Proclaiming it ``the first contact of its kind
since 1917,'' Soviet television broadcast Friday's meeting between
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Queen Elizabeth II with relish
and lingering detail.
   After a leisurely shot of Gorbachev's cortege gliding up the
lush drive to Windsor Castle, the nightly news program ``Vremya''
touted the ``symbolic significance'' of the British monarch's
hospitality to the Communist leader.
   The narrator recalled that close relations between Russian and
British nobility ended in 1917 ``when the Romanovs were deprived of
power.''
   Czar Nicholas II abdicated in early 1917, and he and his entire
family were shot by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Nicholas was a cousin
of the queen's grandfather.
   As the dignitaries stood at attention and the Soviet national
anthem was played, Soviet TV noted that ``never before has the
anthem of the Soviet Union been sounded here,'' at Windsor Castle.
   The report praised the castle's furnishings and art as
``invaluable collections.''
   Gorbachev invited the queen to visit Moscow, and she accepted in
principle but said her schedule was fixed years in advance.
   Dissidents contended she should reject the invitation because of
continuing Soviet human rights violations.
   Andrei Mironov, a Moscow dissident and former political
prisoner, cited the case of a dissident journalist in Sverdlovsk
who is now on trial.
   Mironov spoke as he and four others gave a protest letter to the
British Embassy about the trial of Sergei Kuznetsov. The dissidents
wanted the embassy to have Britain's prime minister, Margaret
Thatcher, raise the case in her talks with Gorbachev.
   Soviet television also covered Gorbachev's meeting with Mrs.
Thatcher extensively.
   It broadcast live on Friday the speeches by Gorbachev and Mrs.
Thatcher at London's Guildhall.
