   The 800-year-old Round Tower at Windsor
Castle, one of Queen Elizabeth II's homes, has been damaged by
shifting foundations, the Department of the Environment said today.
   The castle overlooking the River Thames is reportedly the
queen's favorite home and is one of Britain's top tourist
attractions. The monarch's royal standard is flown from the tower
when she is in residence.
   ``There has been a slight movement to the Round Tower at Windsor
Castle. We are looking into it,'' the government department said in
a brief statement.
   The statement added that the cause was not known and gave no
details about the extent of the damage.
   The Daily Telegraph, which first broke the story, described the
damage to the five-story tower as serious following a shift in its
ancient foundations.
   The London newspaper said the tower moved two weeks ago,
bringing down plaster, causing cracks to appear in the stonework
and jamming a door and two windows.
   It said the queen had inspected the tower. Buckingham Palace
said in a statement: ``The queen is obviously concerned and is
being kept informed.''
   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, live for much of the
year at Buckingham Palace in London but they and their family spend
each Christmas at Windsor Castle. Windsor is 21 miles west of
London.
   The Round Tower is the most imposing feature of the castle. The
foundations of the tower and the rest of its lower part were built
by King Henry II in 1172. The upper part was added 6{ centuries
later in the reign of King George IV.
   The Round Tower is built on a mound thrown up by the Saxons, the
Teutonic invaders who conquered Britain between the 5th and 7th
centuries. They ruled until their army under King Harold was beaten
at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 by Duke William of Normandy, who
then became King William I of England.
   The original castle was built by King William around 1070.
