THE PRINCE and Princess of Wales are to separate, Buckingham Palace
announced yesterday, but the government said the princess could still become
Queen.
Mr John Major told MPs the decision had no constitutional implications and
there were 'no plans' for the couple to divorce. Prince Charles's succession
as head of the Church of England, which frowns on divorce, was also
unaffected.
The prime minister said: 'There is no reason why the Princess of Wales
should not be crowned Queen in due course.'
The couple's 11-year marriage had been subject to intense speculation by
newspapers, fuelled by the publication in June of a biography of the
princess by Mr Andrew Morton. Buckingham Palace said the Queen was
'saddened' by the announcement and wanted an end to the press intrusions
into the couple's lives.
The Queen believes 'a degree of privacy and understanding is essential if
their Royal Highnesses are to provide a happy and secure upbringing for
their children, while continuing to give a wholehearted commitment to their
public duties'. The prince and princess will continue to carry out public
engagements - sometimes together, as at tomorrow night's state banquet in
Edinburgh for European Community leaders.
The princess will live in Kensington Palace. The prince will stay in
Highgrove House, Gloucestershire, and, when in London, with his grandmother,
the Queen Mother, at Clarence House.
The announcement follows, in the Queen's words, an annus horribilis for the
royal family - dominated by newspaper reports of marital rifts and the
behaviour of its junior members - that has stimulated debate about the
future of the House of Windsor.
After a political row over the cost of the Windsor Castle fire, the Queen
said she would pay income tax and reduce the number of publicly funded
royals.
The separation of Charles and Diana could have wider implications. If either
wanted to divorce, the question of the succession would trigger
constitutional uncertainty not seen since the abdication of King Edward VIII
in 1936.
Downing Street last night refused to comment on 'hypothetical' scenarios. Mr
Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, believes that
the prince will renounce the throne in favour of his eldest son, William.
The idea of a single-parent Queen separated from her husband was greeted
with gasps by MPs. 'There is no possibility of this working,' said Mr
Brooks-Baker.
