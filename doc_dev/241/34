   An exhibition from Queen Elizabeth II's private
collection of paintings and furniture opened Friday at the Queen's
Gallery in Buckingham Palace.
   The exhibition, to mark the 25th anniversary of the Queen's
Gallery, includes some of the most celebrated works in the royal
collection, the palace said.
   Works have been taken from private corridors and apartments of
Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. Some have been on display at
Hampton Court or on loan to art galleries.

Durer, Holbein and Canaletto.
