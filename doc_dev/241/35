for more time to stand and stare

You love looking at great paintings. Should you then go to Buckingham Palace
to see the Queen's pictures? Other things being equal, of course you should
because the Picture Gallery is just wonderful. However, the decision whether
or not to 'do' Buckingham Palace must depend on the time available and sheer
physical stamina. How physically uncomfortable can one be and still derive
pleasure from art?
It could so easily be different, not just at Buckingham Palace but at
cultural monuments everywhere, if only cultural tourism was not focused on
the mass-experience. Although Buckingham Palace is mercifully not quite as
popular as some had projected, there were still 6,000 visitors last
Wednesday, which is a lot for a building not purpose-built as a museum.
You should expect to queue for between 60 and 90 minutes for your ticket; it
is possible to have the whole thing over in a morning if you are near the
front of the queue by around 8am. Luring you on is the thought of the
Picture Gallery where this year there are some dozen splendid masterpieces;
Guercino's 'Libyan Sibyl', Guido Reni's sensual 'Cleopatra', the utterly
chaste Agatha Bas as portrayed by Rembrandt, Rubens's 'Farm at Laeken' and
'St George and the Dragon', together with works by de Hooch, Cuyp, and
Claude Lorrain.
Other rooms have memorable paintings and some surprises, such as finding no
less than three women artists: the Renaissance wonder Sophonisba da
Anguissola; Angelica Kaufmann (her large German duchess has the Throne Room
to herself); and a marble statue of Princess Louise made in 1877 by obscure
Mary Thornycroft.
However, the Picture Gallery is the thing, perhaps above all for the chance
to see together two of the most famous and haunting images of royalty ever
made, Van Dyck's 'Great Piece', Charles I with Henrietta Maria and the two
eldest children, faces the great equestrian portrait of Charles and his
riding master, M. de St Antoine. (The second, larger portrait of the king on
a dun charger is in the National Gallery.)
These monumental paintings would be better seen from much further away, as
the artist intended and as they were at one time displayed in the Van Dyck
Room at Windsor Castle. Even so, it is marvellous to compare these two very
different images of a doomed king. Royalists will find them the more
poignant for being still within palace walls and just a stroll away from the
Banqueting House where Charles's head was struck from his shoulders.
So far, so very good, but the drawback is that visitors have to move in one
direction only. Anyone who wants to look properly must be for ever
criss-crossing the gallery which is a wretched way to see paintings. They
will permit no looping back for a last look, a particular hardship in the
case of Rembrandt's small 'Christ and Mary Magdalene at the Tomb', to my
mind one of the loveliest things he ever did.
On a pragmatic view, the Queen's generosity in lending works from her vast
collection - for example, to The Queen's Pictures at the National Gallery
last year - lessens the urgency of going to the Palace. Both my favourite
Rembrandt and 'Agatha Bas' were widely seen in the 1991 Rembrandt show. The
third terrific Rembrandt, 'The Shipbuilder and his Wife', was shown at
around the same period in the Queen's Gallery beside Buckingham Palace.
For 30 years, the Queen's Gallery has been making the royal collections
accessible, although as a rule its shows are very little publicised. It is
there that you will find Vermeer's 'Lady at the Virginals' in an exhibition
on George III and Consul Smith previously noticed on this page.
Even so, I hope that the Buckingham Palace visit will also become a regular
feature of London's cultural resources, as the summer visit to the Palais du
Roi is in Brussels. (Will public opinion prise open the Prince of
Liechtenstein's collection at Vaduz Castle?) I would also like to see
special access for people who are not interested to flow by, gazing
open-mouthed at the mirrors and chandeliers, but want instead to concentrate
on the art treasures.
Some country houses with important art collections do offer 'connoisseurs'
trips', although not nearly enough. They do at Boughton House in
Northamptonshire, a palatial building of exceptional beauty which is only
open on August afternoons. The intact 17th-century panelled State Rooms with
their tapestries are protected by being shown as part of the longer tour.
I see the royal palaces as a classic example of the need to offer the public
a split-level, sheep-and-goats kind of cultural tourism. Separating the
serious from the faintly curious visitor preserves the quality of the
experience and should become part of the strategy for protecting prime
cultural destinations while actually increasing public access and awareness.
Unfortunately, the sole object of the people who run many tourist venues is
to herd visitors round in droves, adding on so-called 'attractions' which in
reality amount to force-feeding us gimmicky, patronising, low-grade pap.
How great an improvement it would be if, instead, every great castle,
palace, or great house offered a choice of experience. Whether at
Versailles, Wilton House or Castle Howard, there ought to be a 'happy hour'.
Enthusiasts, who may have hankered to see a place for years, could be
assured of the peace to look, savour, and commit the experience to memory.
Of course, the motive for opening Buckingham Palace is financial and not
philanthropic. It might reduce the takings to lay on something special for
people with a serious interest, even though they would be asked to pay
sweetly for the privilege. (I see no reason why a private view of a great
art collection should not cost as much as a good seat at the opera.)
However, there is also the matter of popularity. It is surely no bad
investment if in future years a trip to the palace could be made more
appealing to the Queen's more educated subjects.
