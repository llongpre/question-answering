   Princess Anne had a brief reunion Tuesday with her
husband of 15 years while a royal aide the tabloids say is
``besotted'' with her remained on duty behind the walls of Windsor
Castle.
   All three kept silent on the questions that grip Britain's
mass-circulation newspapers: Is the marriage of the queen's only
daughter in trouble, and is Timothy Laurence, the royal aide who
wrote four letters to her, the other man in her life?
   Buckingham Palace refused to comment on reports that Laurence, a
handsome 34-year-old bachelor who is a Royal Navy commander, had
offered his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II.
   It said only that the theft of the four letters delivered to The
Sun, Britain's largest-circulation tabloid, was under investigation
by Scotland Yard.
   In a front-page story Tuesday, The Sun quoted unidentified
friends of Laurence as saying he ``is besotted with Princess Anne
and believes she loves him too.''
   Under the banner headline ``Tim `So In Love With Anne','' the
rival Daily Mirror quoted other unidentified friends as saying they
have had long telephone chats at night and have met secretly at a
house in the country.
   Rumors have circulated since 1981 of trouble in the marriage of
Princess Anne, 38, and Mark Phillips, a 40-year-old commoner and
former captain in the Queen's Dragoon Guards. They were brought
together by their love of horses but have led increasingly separate
lives, spending about half of 1988 apart.
   On Sunday and Monday, the princess and Phillips had separate
schedules and did not see each other, then had only a brief reunion
in the early hours of Tuesday.
   She arrived at their Gatcombe Park estate in western England
after midnight Monday and went horseback riding at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
By the time she returned three hours later, Phillips was gone.
   His business agent, Taryn Bennelick, said he was ``somewhere in
Spain.''
   His father, Maj. Peter Phillips, said his son was advising
people who wanted to set up an equestrian center in Spain.
   ``There is no question of him running away,'' said the senior
Phillips, 68. ``One is getting rather fed up with all the
speculation. They have been getting along for the last 10 years
without any problems.''
   Anne kept public engagements in London later Tuesday, including
visits to research projects related to multiple sclerosis and
muscular dystrophy at the National Hospital's Institute of
Neurology.
   Laurence was on duty at Windsor as an equerry, or aide, to the
queen.
   The Sun, which told Scotland Yard it would not reveal the
contents of the letters, quoted one of Laurence's friends Tuesday
as saying:
   ``Obviously, Tim and the princess were physically attracted to
each other, but their friendship goes deeper than that. Tim has
apparently filled a loneliness in her life and given her a shoulder
to cry on when she needed someone to tell her troubles to.
   ``He understands her tantrums and the bad publicity she often
attracts. But most of all, he cares for her in the way she believes
her husband does not.''
   There is royal precedent for divorce. The queen's only sister,
Princess Margaret, divorced Lord Snowden in 1978 and he has
remarried.
   Because Anne is seventh in line to the throne and unlikely to
become queen, a divorce would not threaten the monarchy.
