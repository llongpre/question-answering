   After more than 400 years of
separation, Sir Henry and Lady Mary Guildford are temporarily
reunited in Basel.
   Drawings of them are on display in the first joint showing of
the world's two most important collections of the graphic work of
Hans Holbein the Younger, the Basel burgher who became the court
painter of Henry VIII.
   The exhibit comprises 50 drawings from the collection of Queen
Elizabeth II on loan to the Basel Kunstmuseum and the 80 works
normally on display at the museum.
   ``An ancient wish has come true,'' Kunstmuseum director
Christian Gelhaar said at the opening. The exhibition of the 130
works spans a career that made the German-born Holbein the first
portrait painter to achieve international fame.
   It ranges from a study for a double-portrait of a Basel mayor
and his wife, when he was 19, to a drawing of an English nobleman,
done shortly before the artist fell victim, at the age of 46, to a
plague sweeping London in 1543.
   Holbein, a friend of the Dutch scholar and humanist Erasmus,
came to England in 1526 in search of lucrative orders because the
arts were ``freezing'' in Basel, as Erasmus put it.
   Erasmus sent him to Sir Thomas More, the later Chancellor, who
became Holbein's first patron. More's warning that Holbein ``may
not find England such fruitful and fertile land as he had hoped,''
as he wrote Erasmus, was soon disproved.
   Portraits of Henry Guildford, newly-named treasurer of the crown
by Henry VIII, and his wife, were among the key works Holbein did
during a first two-year stay in England. Another was a More family
portrait which has vanished.
   Returning to Basel, Holbein took with him the studies for More's
family portrait, a gift for Erasmus, and for the portrait of Lady
Mary. The painting he did of her is now in Missouri at the St.
Louis Art Museum.
   By that time, Holbein was wealthy enough to buy two houses in
Basel and received well paid commissions. But iconoclastic riots by
fanatic Protestants boded ill for the future of an ambitious artist.
   One of the victims was his altarpiece of the Last Supper, which
was chopped to pieces. Most of the fragments were salvaged,
however, later joined together in an irregular way and even painted
over. At the exhibition the piece returns to public view after more
than two decades of painstaking restoration.
   In 1532, Holbein made England his permanent home, leaving behind
his family and most of his oeuvre to become known, according to an
ancient English biographical note, as ``the greatest Master Truly
(in the arts) after the Liffe that ever was.''
   The 50 drawings on loan through Sept. 4 from Windsor Castle,
make evident that this last period marked the culmination of his
career as a portrait painter.
   They impress visitors by the unerring way in which Holbein
captured the features of his subjects, his sure sense of pattern
and the proficiency with which the left-handed artist worked with
generous strokes of black and colored chalks.
   A few show that even Holbein had his off-days, as Jane Roberts,
curator of the Print Room at Windsor Castle, commented at the
opening.
   Drawing an annual salary of 120 pounds sterling from the court,
he portrayed merchants, scholars, statesmen and, mostly, members of
the court and nobility.
   Many of them were protagonists in a stormy period of English
history that, somewhat surprisingly, seemed to leave Holbein
unperturbed. The Windsor collection includes drawings of Anne
Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII who was beheaded in 1536, of
Jane Seymour, the third wife, as well of Baron Rich, whose
testimony led to the execution of Thomas More.
   No preparatory drawing of Henry VIII survived. And what is rated
as Holbein's most masterful portrait of the monarch is in London _
on loan. It is part of the Lugano Collection of Baron Heinrich von
Thyssen-Bornemisza which Britain, like other countries, is bidding
to be the permanent host.
