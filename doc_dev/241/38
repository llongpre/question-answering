to impress a great foreign botanist, Robin Lane Fox finds a sight worth the

March is behaving madly, which makes life difficult for show-offs. Where do
you take visitors if you want to impress them with English flowers at their
best?
I have just faced this difficulty. I have been trying to impress a great
foreign botanist - not any old European dignitary but one of the senior
plant scientists from Russia, who has seen more fruit trees than you or I
would recognise and knows every botanic garden from the Caucasus to
Vladivostock. A few drifts of narcissus Cragford in long grass would not
make the right impression.
As usual, this early spring is split between towns with clouds of early
blossom and a countryside which has yet to see an anemone in flower. Acid
soil and shelter have hurried along the camellias, but where are
Cornwall-like habitats within easy reach of Oxford?
The answer, this weekend, is at the Savill gardens in Windsor Great Park,
where spring breaks early on a sheltered site. Would it have broken already,
I wondered. The person at the end of the telephone assured me she could see
daffodils the last time she managed to escape from her paperwork.
Vladimir was expecting great things: cravenly, I threw in such sweeteners as
the promise of seeing Windsor castle, royalty at prayer, and a guided tour
round Eton college - the pinnacle, I apologised, of the English class
system. If the camellias failed, we could fall back on boys in tailcoats and
guesses about Princess Margaret's bedroom.
Perhaps it was the promise of narcissi, perhaps it was the class struggle.
But, when we set off, the plan already had a Russian stamp of approval
because two passengers had become five: Vladimir brought along some extra
friends to keep up the numbers.
They had much to teach me, some of which will enliven this column in future:
a post-Stalinist exclusive for the pink FT. Meanwhile, I learnt that there
are great rose beds in the botanic gardens at Yalta; thousands of roses have
been planted down the streets of major Ukrainian towns; and there are vast
orchards of scientific collections around Vladivostock.
To seal an agreement of collaboration, I now have bushes of blackcurrants
(with names such as Delight of Lenin) which have been planted in that last
lingering ash-bed of communism, the gardens of my Oxford college.
On the road to Windsor, Vladimir wanted to tell me about great cherries
which he had visited; one friend wanted to interpret; another wished to tell
all of us (in Russian) about the latest political changes; and the fourth
harangued me on her understanding of relations between ancient Persia and
Greece. Schizophrenically, I wondered if the Savill gardens would rise to
the occasion, or if we would peter out in snapshots of Eton's school yard.
There is no knowing at the turnstile: the gardens are entered through an
extraordinarily ugly gift shop which blots out the style which the late Eric
Savill tried to achieve. The famous meadow beneath it has Britain's finest
sweep of the small Hoop Petticoat daffodils which revel in the damp. A few
dozen were visible, and so I improvised about the millions which were
waiting to emerge. What impressed my convoy most was the meadow's similarity
to the sort of steppe they see in Russia every day.
Beyond the future narcissi, the white-flowered osmanthus delavayi is
flowering freely, but it did not attract comment. The first rhododendrons
were better, including the aptly-named Redwing; the big bushes of the
Falconieri variety looked wonderful to me, but less wonderful to those in
the party who had seen them wild in Bhutan. I was beginning to think it was
time for St George's chapel and the royal dolls' house when we rounded the
path to the garden's furthest dell and my guiding anxieties all passed away.
Go and see it if your own gardens are still emerging from winter. Huge
bushes of all the various corylopsis are smothered in the yellow
bell-flowers which never appear on my soil and old, hybrid camellias are
tangled into a flowering archway where names such as Inspiration are
entwined with Salutation. The rhododendrons are not overpowering and the
trunks of the birches are beautifully white.
Out in the clearing, to the right of a pile of drainpipes, stands a sight
worth the journey from St Petersburg. The small cyclamen-flowered narcissi
are already flowering by the thousand in the wet conditions which their
tubular flowers require. Above them stands a tree of a special magnolia
sprengeri, its hundreds of white and reddish flowers opening flat in the
spring sunshine. They bear the name of Savill, who made this garden out of
unused parkland.
You and I are unlikely to have the soil, or the years of patience, to grow a
magnolia to this size. Visit it instead - and reflect on the appropriate
chance that it was open to welcome St Petersburg's leading botanist on a
visit which could never have been considered when the tree was first put in
place.
We admired the crocuses and felt at home among the Chinese azaleas. By the
time we moved on, it did not seem to matter that the state apartments were
closed and there was scope only for a snapshot of Windsor castle's towers.
The Etonian boys were viewed with wonderment and the buildings made my
visitors feel expressively pro-British.
Magnolias, it seems, are stronger than Marxism and, when we left, we all
felt we had seen something to provide a special memory - one that is greater
than any particular country and common to anyone who responds to flowers.
This weekend, those flowers should still be holding and the gardens will
have even more to show. You do not need a foreign delegation to persuade
yourself that the journey is a justified pleasure on its own terms.
