   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ended a
six-day tour of Ireland, Cuba and Britain by announcing nuclear
cutbacks and inviting Queen Elizabeth II to visit Moscow.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday that the queen gave
``a very definite yes,'' but that no date had been set.
   She would be the first British sovereign to visit the Soviet
Union since the 1917 revolution. Her Russian ancestors _ the family
of Czar Nicholas II _ were slain by revolutionaries eight decades
ago.
   Gorbachev's invitation to the queen indicated his success in
winning Mrs. Thatcher's trust. In addition, televised pictures of
the Gorbachevs being escorted around Windsor Castle by the
63-year-old queen and her husband, Prince Philip, further warmed
the royalty-loving British to the Soviet leader.
   Despite the invitation and the cordiality, Mrs. Thatcher and
Gorbachev disagreed on issues of nuclear disarmament and the
balance of East-West forces in Europe.
   Mrs. Thatcher, moreover, downplayed the importance of the Soviet
leader's promise to halt production of weapons-grade uranium and
shut down two more plutonium-producing reactors by the end of 1990.
   Nevertheless, she declared Gorbachev's third visit to Britain
``very successful, warm and friendly,'' echoing his assertion that
it had strengthened British-Soviet ties.
   The Gorbachevs' 40-hour British stay ended with a day steeped in
pageantry.
   The president gave an unusually brief, 27-minute speech in the
splendid setting of London's Guildhall, the 1,000-year-old seat of
city government filled with city leaders in wigs and robes.
   In remarks broadcast live in Britain and the United States,
Gorbachev called his proposals for cutting production of
radioactive material ``another major step toward the complete
cessation of production of fissionable materials for use in nuclear
weapons.''
   However, Mrs. Thatcher later ascribed little importance to the
moves, saying existing Soviet stockpiles would mean the cutbacks
``will have no effect in practice.'' A U.S. Defense Department
official said the weapons reactors could be started when the Soviet
military runs low.
   The Soviet step followed Gorbachev's December announcement to
the United Nations that the Soviet Union would soon cut 500,000
soldiers from its standing army and withdraw troops and tanks from
European and Chinese frontiers.
   Gorbachev lauded Britain for unilaterally eliminating chemical
weapons stocks. He said his country had built a facility for
destroying its own chemical weapons, and he would soon invite
British experts to inspect it.
   The president also said the West should drop plans to modernize
short-range nuclear missiles, but Mrs. Thatcher maintained a
nuclear deterrent was essential.
   After lunch at Windsor Castle, the Gorbachevs were driven to
London's Heathrow Airport, where they flew home to Moscow.
