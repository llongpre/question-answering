   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived
Wednesday night from Cuba for a 40-hour visit that will mix hard
talk on human rights with traditional British pageantry.
   Flying from the sweltering Caribbean into freezing British rain
at Heathrow Airport, Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, got a
red-carpet welcome with a royal military band. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher welcomed them with a warm smile on the tarmac
after the plane touched down at 11 p.m.
   After the Soviet national anthem was played, Gorbachev and Mrs.
Thatcher walked briskly under a pink umbrella past the honor guard
of the Royal Air Force. ``Natural massage,'' Gorbachev joked of the
rain.
   Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher made no statement before driving
together to the Soviet Embassy residence in London to chat over
coffee. Mrs. Gorbachev rode with Mrs. Thatcher's husband, Denis.
   Thatcher aides said the two leaders, accompanied by their
foreign ministers, toasted each other at the Soviet ambassador's
residence. ``The atmosphere was very good. They were very pleased
to see each other,'' said the aide, who spoke on condition he was
not identified.
   But they also got down to business, discussing Afghanistan and
southern Africa, British officials said. On the Feb. 15 withdrawal
of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, Mrs. Thatcher told Gorbachev he
``had fulfilled his promise before the world to depart.''
   About 100 people campaigning for Jewish refuseniks demonstrated
peacefully at an entrance to Kensington Palace Gardens where the
Soviet Embassy is housed. Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher arrived at
another entrance.
   Gorbachev's visit, which includes a lunch with Queen Elizabeth
II at Windsor castle, is a major step in Gorbachev's overtures to
Western Europe. But while Britain is laying on the sort of lavish
reception it used to reserve for its special allies, there were
signs of official anxiety that the Gorbachev charm is working too
well.
   Thursday was set aside for 2{ hours of talks at Mrs. Thatcher's
10 Downing St. residence, followed by a wreath-laying ceremony at
Westminster Abbey, a visit to a high-tech factory outside London
and a Downing Street banquet.
   Officials say Anglo-Soviet relations have never been better
since World War II, and Mrs. Thatcher, interviewed on Soviet TV
Wednesday, had warm words for Gorbachev. She recalled a previous
meeting at which she felt as though Gorbachev was trying to point
``a giant searchlight into the future.''
   ``I had a deep instinct that it was the beginning of a quite new
relationship,'' she said. ``He had this great vision... it really
has far more in common with the system we have worked toward over
the years and which has given us our prosperity and our freedom.''
   But the Thatcher government is also issuing pointed reminders
about Soviet human rights abuses and military might, and charges
that KGB agents are still spying and the Kremlin is still too
secretive about its chemical weapons.
   A full-page advertisement signed by 212 of the 650 members of
the House of Commons appeared in Wednesday editions of The Times of
London, urging Britain to boycott a human rights conference in
Moscow in 1991 unless Gorbachev measures up to a ``checklist.''
   ``Freedom to emigrate; freedom of religious and cultural
expression; freedom from discrimination; freedom of all prisoners
of conscience; freedom of speech; freedom to monitor these basic
rights,'' said the list.
   Nevertheless, opinion polls in Europe suggest Gorbachev's charm
offensive is getting results.
   A Market Opinion and Research International poll in Wednesday's
Times showed that only 17 percent of Britons consider the Soviet
Union a threat, compared with 42 percent in 1981.
   Only 35 percent of the 2,025 people questioned believed the
Kremlin wants to extend its power over other countries, down from
70 percent in 1981.
   Mrs. Thatcher first met Gorbachev in 1984, when he was the No.
2, and declared, ``I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business
together.''
   Since then, Gorbachev appears to have forged a warm relationship
with the doctrinaire anti-communist once dubbed ``The Iron Lady''
by the Kremlin.
   She visited Moscow in 1987, and Gorbachev was to have come to
London in December, but canceled the trip because of the Armenian
earthquake.
   Soviet officials have been on British radio and TV all week
talking about Gorbachev's reforms and the dawn of a new era in
East-West relations.
   The Gorbachevs will have lunch Friday with the queen, arriving
at Windsor Castle in a procession of carriages and cavalry escorts.
The elite Coldstream Guards will serve as guard of honor.
   Beforehand Gorbachev will give a major speech in the splendid
setting of London's ancient Guildhall, seat of city government for
1,000 years.
   Mrs. Gorbachev will go sightseeing with Education Secretary
Kenneth Baker, taking in landmarks such as St. Paul's Cathedral and
Tower Bridge.
