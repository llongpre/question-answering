<HEAD>Intruder Arrested In Buckingham Palace Mews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A drunken youth penetrated security devices
designed to protect the royal family and was arrested about 200
yards from Buckingham Palace, Scotland Yard said early Monday.
   The Yard, headquarters of the metropolitan police, said the
incident occurred Sunday morning. It said no further action was
planned against the youth, who was released after being cautioned
for being drunk and disorderly.
   The Yard declined to give the youth's name, address or age. It
also would not detail how he got into the royal mews, which serves
as stable and garage for Queen Elizabeth II's 30 carriage horses,
coaches and cars.
   He was arrested in the mews, about 200 yards from the palace.
   The mews is normally entered from Buckingham Palace Road through
a huge pair of doors set in a high wall topped with spikes, barbed
wire, alarms and remote control cameras.
   The palace said the queen was not at Buckingham Palace at the
time of the intrusion.
   She was at Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London, where the
royal family often prefers to spend weekends.
   Security at 650-room Buckingham Palace and its 45 acres of
grounds was improved after an unemployed drifter, Michael Fagan,
climbed a drainpipe in 1982 to reach the queen's bedroom, sat on
her bed and spoke to her before he was nabbed.
   A jury found Fagan innocent of stealing a bottle of Californian
wine which he drank during a break-in at the palace earlier in
1982. He was never charged with breaking in to the palace because
it was regarded as trespassing, a civil offense, and the palace
wouldn't take him to court.
