   The woman who brought a queen's comfort to the
bomb-shattered East End during World War II returned to the rebuilt
district Wednesday to celebrate her 90th birthday.
   Nearly 50 years after the German blitz, the presence of Queen
Elizabeth the Queen Mother rekindled warm memories of a bitter time.
   During the war years, the then-Queen Elizabeth picked her way
through the rubble in high heels and the pastel dresses she still
favors today, offering words of ecouragement to East Enders. They
still remember.
   ``She really did cheer us up. People were down in their depths
at the time,'' said Myrtle Lester, who as an 11-year-old spent long
hours in a damp backyard bomb shelter.
   The visit to the East End was a sentimental high point in four
months of parades and pageants leading up to the birthday on
Saturday of the ``Queen Mum,'' as she is fondly known.
   She arrived in the riverside district aboard the royal yacht
Britannia, wearing a light blue dress and matching hat with a wispy
veil, a string of pearls and a beaming smile.
   Elderly East Enders mingled with youngsters waving Union Jacks
who turned out to greet her. Alice Poyser, 69, said she remembered
well the wartime visits of the queen and King George VI.
   ``We were pleased to see her. It felt like a mother talking to
us,'' she said. Mrs. Poyser said her family was bombed out of three
successive homes.
   Several people in the crowd recalled the queen's words after
Buckingham Palace was hit by a bomb: ``I'm glad we've been bombed.
It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.''
   During the war, Prime Minister Winston Churchill advised her to
go to Canada for safety. She ignored him, and took lessons at
Buckingham Palace on how to use a rifle.
   Her daughters _ Elizabeth, now the queen, and Princess Margaret
_ stayed at Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London, during the
conflict.
   The East End's shattered docks and factories have been replaced
by a huge redevelopment project that has brought new homes, shops
and offices.
   The Queen Mother unveiled a plaque honoring 76 people killed by
a bomb and revisited the shelters underneath All Saints' Church,
itself a bombing casualty in 1945. She also saw some of those she
met during wartime.
   Wednesday night, she was to be guest of honor at a birthday
dinner on the Britannia given by the queen and Prince Philip,
followed by fireworks over the Tower of London.
   The Queen Mother was born Aug. 4, 1900. Lady Elizabeth Angela
Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the ninth child of the Earl and Countess
of Strathmore, whose family home was Glamis Castle in Scotland.
   In 1923 she married the Duke of York, second of four surviving
sons of King George V.
   She became queen, quite unexpectedly, when the duke's elder
brother, Edward, abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee
Wallis Warfield Simpson.
   Biographers say the Queen Mother never recovered from her
husband's early death from lung cancer in 1952. She still refers to
him as ``the king'' and declines public appearances on the
anniversaries of his birth, marriage and death.
   Despite her age, the Queen Mother is still one of the most
active royals. Only the queen and Princess Anne make more public
appearances.
