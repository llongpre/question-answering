FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs propose study of palace costs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INQUIRY into the costs of maintaining royal palaces such as Windsor
Castle, which was partly destroyed by fire last week, was proposed last
night by a cross-party Commons committee.
The public accounts committee has asked Sir John Bourn, comptroller and
auditor general, to consider launching a 'value for money' study into the
Department of National Heritage and Royal Palaces owned by the state.
However, in spite of pressure from some Labour MPs, the committee has
decided that it will not - at least at this stage - look at wider issues of
the financing of the Royal Family and whether the Queen should pay tax. The
committee's responsibilities, in conjunction with the comptroller and
auditor-general, are traditionally to ensure efficiency in Whitehall.
In a private meeting last night, MPs on the public accounts committee
discussed the possibility of a wider inquiry into the Royal Family's
finances but no agreement was reached.
