   LONDON -- Scandalous questions are dogging Britain's Royal
Family: Why are the royal pooches biting the hand that feeds
them? Is there bad blood among the blue-blooded canines?
   Dog behaviorists all over this dog-crazy nation were
seeking answers yesterday after Buckingham Palace tersely
confirmed that Queen Elizabeth II had been bitten on the left
hand by one of her beloved pet corgis. Apparently, the queen,
trying to reassert royal authority, waded into a snarling
pack of 10 corgis who had dropped their palace manners and
were busy thrashing one another.

   It was the second royal free-for-all involving palace
corgis in the past two years. In 1989, the queen's corgi
Chipper was killed by a corgi pack led by Ranger, a corgi
owned by Queen Elizabeth's mother, known affectionately here
as the Queen Mum. In this case, as well, two of the pooches
apparently belonged to the Queen Mum.
   In the latest incident, which occurred at Windsor Castle,
Her Majesty suffered a nip on a finger and thumb; the wounds
required three stitches. A royal chauffeur was also bitten
while trying to help the queen separate the dogs.
   "The queen is very brave to have done this," says canine
behaviorist Anthony Burley, who shudders to think that the
attack could have been much worse. "To put your hand in
between fighting corgis is to put your hand into a food
mixer." Corgis are a handful -- low, long and strong, with
grown males averaging 20 to 24 pounds.
   Buckingham Palace might have been tempted to let sleeping
dogs lie and refuse to confirm the attack, except that the
queen's injuries were observed publicly for the first time
yesterday when she conducted a 75-minute investiture ceremony
at the palace. Palace observers who were present noted that
she sported plastic bandages on her left thumb and
forefinger.
   While lauding the queen's bravery, dog psychologists were
also gently suggesting to Her Majesty that she consider other
means of restoring order among her dogs. "Grab a tea tray and
bang it loudly over their heads, then drop it between the
dogs," Mr. Burley says. "You need something physical between
them, but it shouldn't be your hand."
   Unanswered is whether the dog that drew royal blood is in
the royal doghouse. But Roger Mugford, the queen's animal
behaviorist, says: "I suspect the dog will be forgiven."
