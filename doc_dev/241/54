   President Bush had lunch with Queen Elizabeth II
on Thursday, sampled the splendor of Buckingham Palace and smiled
for the cameras at her majesty's command.
   The royal event began with a glitch over the delayed opening of
Barbara Bush's car door, but by the time lunch ended 30 minutes
behind schedule there were smiles all around and the queen told the
president: ``I hope to see you again soon.''
   When the presidential limousine pulled up to the palace's
red-carpeted Grand Entrance, Bush jumped out. But nobody opened
Mrs. Bush's door until the queen, frowning and shaking her head,
raised her voice and said: ``Open it.''
   A U.S. Secret Service agent complied immediately and Mrs. Bush,
wearing an emerald green dress, emerged smiling as though nothing
had happened.
   It was the Bushes' first taste of British royal hospitality and
the queen and her husband, Prince Philip, brought out one of
Britain's biggest tourist attractions _ the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards in their red tunics and bearskin hats.
   The president arrived at Buckingham Palace from talks with Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher at her Downing Street residence.
Escorted by Philip, he inspected a 100-strong honor guard mounted
by the Scots Guards after their band played the U.S. national
anthem.
   ``That was so beautiful,'' Bush told his hosts. ``I have never
heard `The Star-Spangled Banner' being played better.''
   Then he added hastily: ``with all respect to the Marine band.''
   Both couples then went inside, chatting animatedly as they
walked through a few of the palace's 600 rooms on their way to
cocktails with the 30 other luncheon guests.
   Between cocktails and lunch, the Bushes and their royal hosts
slipped out for a quick look at the mainly 17th century Dutch
masterpieces in the palace picture gallery.
   ``It's just us. It's very quiet,'' Bush said in a joking
reference to the cocktail hubbub he left behind.
   As they approached photographers, the queen, wearing a blue and
white striped silk dress, told Bush with a grin: ``Smile.'' He
obeyed.
   Luncheon was served in the ivory and gold Music Room overlooking
the 45-acre palace garden. The magnificent domed room with 18 blue
and gilt columns has been used for many royal christenings
including those of Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, and
Charles' heir, Prince William.
   Flanked by the queen and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Bush
sat down to a meal of smoked salmon mousse, duck with honey and
brandy sauce, broad beans, asparagus and potatoes, artichoke salad
and mango ice cream.
   The three wines included two which the queen served Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife Raisa when they lunched
together at Windsor Castle in April. They are an Alsatian white
Gewurztraminer Dopff 1983 and the queen's private port, Royal
Vintage 1955.
   Buckingham Palace said the queen's choice of wines was
``coincidence.''
   The guests included Mrs. Thatcher's husband Denis, Secretary of
State James Baker III, his British counterpart Sir Geoffrey Howe,
Terry Hands, artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Theater,
and Charles Wilson, editor of The Times of London.
   When former President Reagan went to Buckingham Palace just a
year ago for tea with the queen, a U.S. television reporter shouted
questions to him, breeching accepted behavior at formal royal
occasions.
   To avoid a repetition, reporters at the entrance were made to
stand behind a sound-proof glass screen.
