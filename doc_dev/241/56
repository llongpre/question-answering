<LEADPARA>  Here's what Prince Charles has to say about the British education system,
according to quotes in this week's London newspapers:;    "It is almost
incredible that in Shakespeare's land one child in seven leaves primary school
functionally illiterate. In France, Italy and Belgium, every child under 5
receives nursery education from the state. Here, less than half of our
children have that right."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It is the rule that royals keep hands off political subjects, but our spies
in Parliament say no politicians are complaining. Quite the opposite, in fact.
They are using Charles' speech to fire salvos at each other.; (hbox);    The
scene was the presidential palace in Berlin, where dignitaries and security
galoots awaited the arrival of the Netherlands' Queen Beatrix.;    The
appearance of a snarling black Mercedes snapped them to attention, a position
they held while the limo stopped, the door opened . . . and Hape Kereling
stepped out.;    Reporters at the scene say Kereling was resplendent in a dark
blue skirt and pillbox hat. Notorious as a drag prankster, Kereling posed and
waved regally to photographers, then was nabbed by the attending muscle.;   
Speculation is that he was given away by the Dutch flag he was wearing by way
of a blouse.;    As he was being dragged away, the real queen pulled up,
unfortunately missing the whole show.; (hbox);    Princess Diana spent
Thursday visiting AIDS victims in a Rio de Janeiro hospital while Charles
continued to campaign for the environment. They are on a five-day visit to
Brazil.; (hbox);    Princess Anne will make the first official visit by a
British royal to Poland on Oct. 7-10, it was announced Thursday. This
apparently will get even for Lech Walesa's current visit to Britain.; (hbox); 
  Speaking of which, Walesa observed Thursday that he wouldn't mind doing a
little renovating in his royal lodgings at Windsor Castle. He is an
electrician, you know.;    "Let me be brief," Walesa told scribblers in
London. "I would move a few things to a different location. For instance, I
had problems; the lamp on my night table was too far away, and I couldn't find
my wife in the big bed.";    For the record, let it be noted that as guests of
HM the Q, the stocky Walesa and his wife, Danuta, who once shared a cramped
apartment with their eight children, have been assigned a suite of rooms at
Windsor.;    Walesa admitted he was impressed by the pomp and pageantry as the
queen's guest, saying, "The things I have seen here made me sleepless until 2
a.m."  </TEXT>
