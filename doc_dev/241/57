   Prince Charles flew home Friday with the body of a
friend who was killed by a Swiss avalanche that nearly engulfed the
future king as it roared down a mountain in a ``terrifying matter
of seconds.''
   With Maj. Hugh Lindsay's pregnant widow, Sarah, the prince
watched as six soldiers from his dead friend's Royal Lancers
regiment bore the flag-draped coffin from the red and white jet of
the Queen's Flight.
   The 39-year-old heir to the throne was praised for helping save
the life of another skier in his party but called foolhardy for
skiing perilous slopes off the main trails of the Klosters resort.
   A private funeral service in Devon was being arranged for
Lindsay, but no date was announced. Independent Television News
reported that Lindsay, an avid cricket player, had said he wanted
his ashes to be scattered on the cricket ground in his home town of
Budleigh Salterton.
   Charles, his wife, Princess Diana, and sister-in-law, Sarah, the
Duchess of York, all dressed in black, walked under leaden skies
from the jet at Northolt air base near London.
   They were met by Mrs. Lindsay, 34, a Buckingham Palace press
officer who had helped answer inquiries about Thursday's accident
before discovering her husband had died.
   She and Lindsay, also 34, were married last summer and she
expects a baby in May. He was a former aide to Queen Elizabeth II,
the prince's mother.
   In a handwritten statement read to reporters at the Zurich
airport after the royal party left, Charles said he and five
companions were skiing ``at our risk and we all accepted ... that
mountains have to be treated with the greatest respect and not
treated lightly.''
   When the avalanche started ``with a trememdous roaring'' he and
three others skied out of its path, Charles said.
   Then, ``to my horror, Maj. Hugh Lindsay and Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson just failed to ski clear and were swept away in a
whirling maelstrom as the whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past
us to the valley below. It was all over in a terrifying matter of
seconds.''
   He described helping dig Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson out of the
snow with a shovel, then with his hands. Both of her legs were
broken and she is hospitalized in Switzerland.
   The royal party cut the skiiing holiday short. It began Tuesday
and ended tragically at 2:45 p.m. Thursday when the avalanche
hurtled down the mountain toward Charles; Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson;
her husband, Charles; Lindsay; Swiss guide Bruno Sprecher; and a
Swiss policeman.
   They were skiing off the main track between the treacherous
Gotschnawang and Drostobel trails at an altitude of about 5,800
feet when the snowslide began about 300 feet above them. Officials
had warned of avalanche danger at 5,200 feet and higher.
   ``Herr Sprecher acted with incredible speed and total
professionalism,'' the prince said. ``He skied down as fast as
possible, having told the Swiss policeman to radio for assistance.''
   Sprecher located Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson by a beeper on her body.
   ``Mr. Palmer-Tomkinson and I skied down and just arrived as Herr
Sprecher had reached Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson's head,'' the statement
said. ``He gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and revived her.
He gave me the shovel to dig her out and I tried using my hands as
well.
   ``At this point I sat with Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson while he
(Sprecher) quickly went to try and locate Maj. Lindsay. He found
him about 15 yards above Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson, but tragically he
had been killed outright during the fall.''
   Mrs. Lindsay left the Northolt base with her father. She was
carrying a bag apparently containing some of her husband's
belongings that the Duchess of York had given to her.
   Prince Charles departed for Windsor Castle, 20 miles away, to
see the queen and Diana and the Duchess of York went to Kensington
Palace.
   ``Thereafter their movements for the weekend are private,''
Buckingham Palace said.
   The accident highlighted the sometimes risky behavior of
Britain's royals.
   Hours before the avalanche, the Duchess of York, 28 and four
months pregnant, took a bad fall skiing.
   That night, the Royal Navy ship on which her husband, Prince
Andrew, is serving lost a helicopter with two crewmen off Portugal.
Andrew, younger brother of Charles, was not involved but he is a
helicopter pilot.
   The avalanche was the worst accident for the royal family since
Prince William of Gloucester, a cousin of the queen, died in a
crash during an air race in 1972.
   Newspapers clamored on Friday for Charles and other members of
the royal family to give up dangerous pursuits.
   ``Why was he there?'' the tabloid Sun asked. ``Charles has
consistently risked his life by going on increasingly deadly
slopes.''
   Charles is an ardent polo player who has taken many falls, and
had a near-collision while flying a plane. On his first parachute
jump he snarled the rigging and fell several thousand feet before
untangling it.
