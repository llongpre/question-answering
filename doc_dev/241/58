Roy Strong has skirted perilously closely around the trapdoor reserved for
TV show-offs in the first two of his Royal Gardens series (8.30 BBC2) but
has not yet tumbled in. His accounts of Hampton Court and Kew have had as
much to do with entertainment and history as with horticulture. Today he
turns to the gardens created or remodelled by George IV: Brighton Pavilion,
Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.
As that finishes, assuming you can tear yourself away from the repeat of
Blackadder Goes Forth (a considerable assumption) you can watch the first in
a new Channel 4 series, Spirit Of Trees (9.00), which, it seems, is about
precisely what it says. Episode 1 also goes to Windsor ..
Today's Crime Story (9.00 ITV) is about a nasty and yet undeniably
fascinating case involving newspaper proprietors' families. Criminals
intending to kidnap Rupert Murdoch's wife snatched the wrong woman. Her body
has never been found.
The most fascinating aspect of Between The Lines is not the investigation of
police corruption but the frantic sex life of the chief character, Tony
Clark (9.30 BBC1).
