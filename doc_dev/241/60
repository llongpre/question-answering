About 70m visits were made to historic properties in England last year, an
increase of 3 per cent over 1992, the English Tourist Board said yesterday.
Buckingham Palace, open to the public for the first time, attracted 377,000
people in 56 days, making it the 13th most popular entrance-charging
attraction.
Visitors to historic properties spent Pounds 192m, a rise of 8 per cent on
1992. The number of visitors to Forde Abbey, Dorset, rose by 49 per cent
while visits to Harewood House, West Yorkshire, and Wilton House, Wiltshire,
rose by 37 per cent. Leeds Castle in Kent (up 10 per cent) and Dover Castle
(up 11 per cent) also showed strong rises.
Westminster Abbey was England's most visited historic building last year,
with 2.5m visitors.
Of the admission-charging attractions, top place went to the Tower of London
with 2.3m visitors, a rise of 4 per cent on 1992. St Paul's Cathedral,
London, was second with a 36 per cent rise to 1.9m last year.
The next five places were the Roman Baths and Pump Room, Bath (898,142
