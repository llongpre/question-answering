   Five members of the royal family
attended the funeral of the Marchioness of Cambridge, the wife of
the late Marquess of Cambridge, a nephew of the late Queen Mary.
   Lady Cambridge died April 1 at the age of 88.
   The Queen Mother Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, the Duke and
Duchess of Gloucester and Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester,
attended the funeral Thursday at St. George's Chapel in Windsor
Castle, an official residence of Queen Elizabeth II.

from King George III, or married to his descendants.
