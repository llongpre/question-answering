<HEAD>Trooping the Color: Queen Honored On Official Birthday</HEAD>

   Cavalrymen and foot soldiers in scarlet tunics and
bearskin hats paraded in the center of London Saturday to honor
Queen Elizabeth II with the Trooping the Color on her ``official''
birthday.
   The queen, who is 62, celebrated her real birthday on April 21,
but the official birthday ceremonies are held on the second
Saturday of June when the weather normally is better. The sky was
overcast and there was a damp chill in the air Saturday.
   This year, for the first time since 1973, the 1,588 men of all
five regiments of the Brigade of Guards joined the parade because
all are currently based in London.
   The guards _ Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish and Welsh
regiments _ are often scattered, seeing service in such places as
Northern Ireland and the Falkland Islands.
   Four generations of the royal family joined the ceremony this
year, riding in coaches or on horseback to the Horse Guards Parade,
an open square in Whitehall, where the queen inspected the Irish
Guards while massed bands played.
   Each year one regiment performs the honors, marching in
intricate patterns and carrying the ``color,'' or regimental
standard.
   Elizabeth, wearing a blue coat and wide-brimmed hat, arrived in
a horse-drawn phaeton and took the salute standing on a dais. It
was the second year she had used the carriage since retiring her
horse, Burmese, which she used to ride sidesaddle for the occasion,
wearing a scarlet uniform.
   The queen's 5-year-old grandson, Prince William, was with his
mother, the Princess Diana, and his great-grandmother, Queen Mother
Elizabeth, in her carriage.
   Riding horseback was the heir to the throne, Prince Charles in
his uniform as colonel of the Welsh Guards, along with the queen's
husband, Prince Philip, a colonel of the Grenadier Guards.
   On her return to Buckingham Palace, the queen appeared on a
balcony to wave to her subjects and thousands of tourists.
   Saturday's pageantry was based on the ceremony used for guard
mounting in the 18th century and was first performed on the
sovereign's birthday for King George III. But during the 18th and
19th centuries the trooping was seldom attended by the monarch.
   In 1895, the color was trooped in the quadrangle at Windsor
Castle, west of London, and Queen Victoria took the salute from a
carriage. From that year on, a senior royal person has always been
in attendance.
