   Royal aide Timothy Laurence, whose letters to
Princess Anne have renewed speculation her marriage is in trouble,
was dropped from Queen Elizabeth II's entourage at the public
premiere of a new London musical.
   But Buckingham Palace stressed in a statement that Laurence had
remained on duty back at Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London.
   The bachelor, a Royal Navy commander, had been scheduled to
accompany the queen, Anne's mother, to a charity performance Monday
night of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's new show, ``Aspects of
Love,'' in London's West End.
   As Scotland Yard investigated the theft of four of Laurence's
letters to Anne from the palace, speculation about her 15-year
marriage to Mark Phillips made front-page news again today in
London's royal-mad tabloids.
   Phillips, a farmer and equestrian, is a former captain in The
Queen's Dragoon Guards. Rumors his marriage to Anne is in trouble
have circulated for years and recently the two have spent up to six
months a year apart.
   They have two children, Peter, 11, and Zara, 7.
   ``Dashing queen's equerry (aide) Tim Laurence is `besotted' with
Princess Anne and believes she loves him too,'' The Sun, Britain's
largest circulation newspaper, reported today, quoting unnamed
friends of Laurence.
   ``The handsome 34-year-old Naval Commander often speaks to her
on the phone late at night, sometimes for more than an hour. And he
meets her secretly whenever possible in London or at country
homes.''
   Anne's father-in-law, Maj. Peter Phillips, denied Monday that
the marriage was on the rocks, and said he spoke to his son as
recently as Sunday.
   ``He would confide in me if there was anything wrong but all the
conversation was about horses,'' Phillips said.
   ``It's not the sort of marriage that ordinary people would
understand at all _ they spend so much time away from one another.
   ``If people are royal, they don't necessarily spend lots of time
together ... Of course their marriage is very unusual.''
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said Anne,
38, and her 40-year-old husband were reunited for six hours
overnight at their country mansion, Gatcombe Park, 90 miles west of
London, after she spent a busy day fulfilling engagements in
northwest England.
   The news agency said Anne arrived home after midnight but left
about 6 a.m. to go horseback riding. When she returned three hours
later to prepare for engagements in London, Phillips had left the
house. His business agent, Taryn Bennelick, said today he was
somewhere in Spain but gave no details.
   Anne has become the busiest and one of the most admired member
of Britain's royal family. As president of the Save the Children
Fund charity, she travels on behalf of children in poverty-stricken
and war-torn Third World countries. Phillips also travels widely on
various business and equestrian interests.
   The latest speculation about the couple's marriage began after
The Sun reported Thursday that it had been sent anonymously four
letters stolen from Anne's desk at Buckingham Palace.
   The Sun pledged not to publish the contents and said it had
turned them over to Scotland Yard.
   After a Sunday newspaper told Buckingham Palace it was going to
name the author, the palace identified Laurence.
   Royalty correspondent Richard Kay wrote today in The Daily Mail
``Anne and Mark no longer have a marriage in the conventional
sense.''
   But Kay predicted: ``There won't be any announcement of a
divorce ... For it is she... who has brought back much
respectability to the royal family at a time when popularity and
support are on the wane... Certainly the old guard at the palace
would be appalled at the thought of another divorce within the
royal family.''
   Princess Margaret, Anne's aunt and the queen's only sister, was
divorced in 1978 from Lord Snowdon, who has since remarried.
