   News that a handsome aide to the queen wrote
personal letters to Princess Anne prompted new Page One speculation
Monday that Anne's marriage is on the rocks. But her father-in-law
denied the marriage has broken down.
   Anne herself, the 38-year-old daughter of Queen Elizabeth II,
smiled through a typically busy day of engagements.
   As Scotland Yard investigated the theft of the letters from the
princess' desk at Buckingham Palace, Britain's tabloids questioned
in banner headlines whether her 15-year marriage to fellow
equestrian Mark Phillips would survive.
   ``Can This Marriage Be Saved?,'' asked the Daily Mail. ``Anne
Divorce Crisis At Palace,'' said Today. ``Royal Marriage Crisis:
Anne Sad, Shattered, Alone,'' trumpeted the Daily Mirror.
   Maj. Peter Phillips, Anne's 68-year-old father-in-law, denied
the marriage was washed up. He told reporters: ``It's not the sort
of marriage that ordinary people would understand at all _ they
spend so much time away from one another.
   ``If people are royal, they don't necessarily spend lots of time
together. It's inevitable. Princess Anne and Mark come together and
they part, doing the various jobs which they have got to do.
   ``One does not inquire about when they last got together. ... Of
course their marriage is very unusual.''
   Phillips added, ``Mark rang me last night (Sunday). ... He would
confide in me if there was anything wrong but all the conversation
was about horses. ... The marriage side of things was not discussed
at all.''
   The three principals at the heart of the speculation remained
silent on the subject.
   Anne appeared in a happy mood as she carried out a busy schedule
of activities in northwest England including opening a $68 million
shopping center in Liverpool.
   Margaret Maguire, a shopper who talked with Anne, said later,
``She is beautiful _ a credit to her country. It is her own life
and the press should leave her alone.''
   Phillips, a 40-year-old commoner and former captain in The
Queen's Dragoon Guards, spent the day at the couple's Gatcombe Park
estate in western England.
   Royal Navy Cmdr. Timothy Laurence, the 34-year-old bachelor who
wrote the stolen letters, was at Windsor Castle, continuing with
his normal duties as an equerry, or aide, to the queen, Buckingham
Palace said.
   Rumors of trouble in the princess' marriage have circulated
since 1981. In recent years, she and her husband have spent up to
six months a year apart.
   Anne has become the busiest and one of the most admired members
of the royal family, undertaking grueling travels on behalf of
children in poverty-stricken and war-torn Third World countries.
Phillips has also traveled widely for a variety of business and
equestrian interests.
   On their 15th anniversary on Nov. 15, Anne attended a Buckingham
Palace ball while Phillips was giving riding lessons in Australia.
   Britain's tabloids have tried to link Anne to a former bodyguard
and actor Anthony Andrews, and Phillips to one of his stable girls,
a Canadian public relations executive and Pamella Bordes, a former
Miss India who worked as a researcher in the House of Commons.
   The latest rumors began after The Sun, Britain's
largest-circulation tabloid, reported Thursday that four letters
stolen from Anne had been sent anonymously to the paper and turned
over to Scotland Yard.
   After a Sunday newspaper told Buckingham Palace it was going to
name the letter-writer, the palace identified Laurence, who served
on the royal yacht Britannia before become a top aide to the queen.
It described him as a friend of the princess' but refused to
disclose the contents.
   The Daily Mirror, which called the letters ``highly personal,''
said Monday that the princess had visited Laurence's home in
Winchester at least half a dozen times, sometimes with her two
children, Peter, 11, and Zara, 7.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage,
said: ``The matter cannot be left hanging in the air like this.''
   There is a precedent for a royal divorce. Anne's aunt, Princess
Margaret, the queen's only sister, was divorced in 1978 from Lord
Snowden, who has since remarried. Anne herself is seventh in line
to the throne, far enough down the line of succession not to create
problems for the monarchy if she were to divorce.
   Nigel Dempster, Britain's best-known gossip columnist who writes
in The Daily Mail, said Anne and Phillips haven't divorced because
neither wants to marry someone else.
   ``I think everyone including Mark and the royal family have been
aware that the marriage as such had been over for a very long
time,'' he told the BBC.
