Last week two related events occurred that brought a bit of life to the
architectural world. One was that Country Life, the magazine with a
first-rate architectural editor in the shape of Mr Giles Worsley, announced
the results of its competition for the rebuilding of parts of Windsor Castle
damaged by fire.
The other was also related to Windsor Castle, the appearance of a book
Windsor, the Most Romantic Castle by Mark Girouard, which contains a chapter
devoted to new ideas for rebuilding the castle's burnt-out St George's Hall.
Both sets of ideas form the basis of an exhibition at the Architecture
Foundation in London, which it is hoped will then travel to all parts of the
kingdom.
When the smoke finally blew away from the charred ruins of the castle after
the fire last November, crowds of the curious and the impertinent came
forward with their views on what should be done. In fact, the damage was not
as bad as had been thought. Only the north-east corner of the Upper Ward was
affected. But it was a part of the castle that contains several important
rooms.
The fire began in the private chapel and attacked St George's Hall, the
Grand Reception Room, the Octagon Room in the Brunswick Tower, the Dining
Room, Crimson and Green Drawings Rooms and the Great Kitchen. It spread with
sickening speed through the roofs of these rooms, but, although it damaged
the walls, they are not beyond repair. By a stroke of good fortune, the
furnishings of these rooms had been removed for a rewiring programme and it
all survives.
The survival of almost all the furnishings and works of art from these rooms
would seem to make it sensible speedily to rebuild the castle exactly as it
was in before the fire.
But, naturally enough, there have been strange cries from architects calling
for contemporary contributions to the rebuilding. Mr Girouard's book and the
competition entries from Country Life are part of a campaign to promote a
debate which tries to relate the rebuilding of Windsor to the modernisation
of the monarchy as an institution.
Competitions should be judged by their results, not simply by their good
intentions. The 10 proposals for St George's Hall in the Girouard book come
not only from architects, but also stage and lighting designers. It is a
strange list that seems to demonstrate how difficult it is for architects
and designers to understand the purpose of state rooms, the role of history
and the functions of the monarchy. The implication is that Wyatt Ville's
work at Windsor was dull and there is little understanding of how the castle
works when it is filled with the colour and glitter of, for example, a state
banquet in St George's Hall or a procession of Knights of the Garter.
The sense of continuity is the essence of an hereditary monarchy and the
wish of so many of these designers to 'bring light colour and change' into
the castle may be almost as destructive as the intrusion of the media. There
should be an element of poetry about any scheme for what has been described
as 'the most romantic castle' and that is exactly what is missing from so
many of the laboured designs in both competitions.
The idea of leaving the Great Hall as a ruin, as proposed by Mr Rowan Moore,
does have a certain Gothic romance, but also opts out of the architectural
debate. More feasible is the plan by Roderick Gradidge to add a steeply
pitched roof to the hall and redecorate in a rich, almost Puginesque manner.
One entrant, Douglas Binnie, has combined his talents as an architect and a
sculptor in his elaborately iconographic schemes, and his Country Life entry
is one of the best presented.
Of the 10 Girouard schemes, only two are remotely workable. One is Richard
MacCormack's bronze and timber roof, inspired by but not imitative of the
original Gothic roof of St George's Hall; and the other is by Michael
Hopkins, who saw the decorative potential of the motif of the Garter Star.
There is, inevitably, a committee to discuss the restoration plans for the
castle. A decision is already made to rebuild the chapel area in a
contemporary way. This area, where the fire began, was a remodelling by Sir
Hugh Casson of the 1842 chapel by Edward Blore. Whether a private chapel is
needed at this point in the castle's history may be debatable.
The committee may decide to build a modern roof on St George's Hall and they
would be foolish to overlook the wonderful timber designs of the Hungarian
architect Imrie Macovecz. He designed one of the best pavilions ad Seville's
Expo 92 and his work is remarkably original.
The committee will have the benefit of the experience of the National Trust
who are currently rebuilding Uppark in Sussex after a disastrous fire. They
will also take advice from those responsible for the recent excellent
restoration of Hampton Court.
The real opportunity offered by Windsor is involve in the restoration the
expertise of those responsible for the Royal Collection who made such a
splendid job of the refurbishment of Frogmore in Windsor Great Park. With
the gentle help of one or two good architects, Windsor should be restored
very much as it was.
Mark Girouard's agreeable book tells us something of the story of life at
Windsor. But his selection of contemporary architects and winners of Country
Life competition demonstrate that the modern imagination cannot deal with
either the romance of the castle or the appropriate panoply for the home of
the head of state.
