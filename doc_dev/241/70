<TEXT>     At last count, the queen had six corgis. Her devotion to them dates from
her youth, when her parents gave her one. Her mother has two of the dogs,
which tend to be snappy and yappy.;    In 1988, the queen consulted an animal
psychologist about the dogs' behavior, which included nipping ankles of the
household staff.  </TEXT>
