   Fresh from the splendors of the Kremlin, President
Reagan and his wife Nancy went to Buckingham Palace for tea with
the queen Thursday and smiled aside all invitations to compare the
virtues of East and West.
   Standing on a red carpet in the marble-columned Grand Entrance
Hall of the 600-room palace, the president was asked by a reporter
whether he was happy to be out of Moscow and back in London.
   ``Let me put it very simply, I'm very happy to be in London,''
he replied, smiling wryly.
   Mrs. Reagan, whose prickly relationship with Raisa Gorbachev was
evident during this week's Moscow summit, was asked whether she was
happy to be seeing Queen Elizabeth II rather than the Soviet
leader's wife.
   ``I'm very happy to see the queen at all times,'' she replied
with a big smile.
   The hour-long tea in the queen's Audience Room overlooking the
45-acre palace gardens was a meeting of old friends. The Reagans
were guests of the royal family at Windsor Castle in 1982, and the
62-year-old monarch stayed at the Reagan ranch in 1983. Reagan
attended a Buckingham Palace dinner during the 1984 economic summit.
   The Reagans arrived at the palace two minutes late, getting out
of their limousine at the glassed-in Grand Entrance, where Prince
Charles and Princess Diana returned in a horse-drawn open carriage
after their 1981 wedding extravaganza.
   Inside the hall, the queen, hatless and wearing a sapphire-blue
silk dress, stretched out her hand and said: ``Nice to see you
again. How are you Mr. President?''
   Reagan, in a blue suit and red and blue striped tie, and the
first lady, wearing a silk two-piece dress and matching shoes in
her favorite color of red, chatted with the queen while posing for
photographers.
   Then, the queen led them along the gilt-and-white Marble Hall,
lined with sculptures and paintings mainly of her great-great
grandmother Queen Victoria, to the Audience Room, where she
receives Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for her weekly audience.
   It was just tea for three, since the queen's husband, Prince
Philip, had a previous engagement in Suffolk.
   The Reagans' greeting was watched by about 50 members of the
queen's household who stood behind a red rope in the Marble Hall.
   Outside the palace, police said about 1,500 people gathered,
cheering and waving as the Reagans drove by. The president and his
wife waved back as they swept through the iron gates.
   ``We got a beautiful warm smile. It was worth the 2{-hour
wait,'' said Barbara Lee of Minneapolis, Minnesota.
   Barbara Black of Camarillo, California, said: ``I live ... about
30 miles from Reagan's ranch, and I don't bother to visit him, and
here I am half way around the world standing in line waiting to get
a vague glimpse of him.''
   Justine Griffin, a Scot who waited outside the palace, also was
enthusiastic about the American president.
   ``I think he's a good bloke,'' she said.
   After tea, the Reagans went their separate ways.
   The president went to the Foreign Office where he was officially
welcomed by Mrs. Thatcher and a band of Welsh Guards playing the
national anthem and Irving Berlin hits.
   The first lady returned to the U.S. ambassador's residence,
Winfield House, to meet with Prince Charles, who flew back to
London from a series of public engagements in Lancashire.
   Mrs. Reagan and the 39-year-old heir to the throne have met
several times previously in Washington and London, and the palace
said they share an interest in social and human rights issues.
