FT  08 FEB 92 / Arts: A royal hunch comes off

THE two-hour BBC programme documenting a year in the life of the Queen is
the latest item in a public relations campaign which has been brilliantly
conducted throughout the 40-year reign of Elizabeth II. Though Elizabeth R
has none of the overt obsequiousness which has marred some royal programmes
in recent years, it seems clear nevertheless that the picture it conveys is
one of which the Queen thoroughly approves. Why should she not? It shows her
as dedicated, hard working, devoted to her family, and occasionally funny.
Confirming what the Crawfie types have always said, she seems to be most
animated when dealing with dogs and horses.
No British institution has exploited television more effectively than the
royal family, though 'campaign' and 'exploit' may over-state: this success
seems to have come from hunch and instinct rather than the expensive sort of
adman's operation undertaken by political parties. In 1953 Winston Churchill
and the Cabinet recommended excluding television cameras from the
coronation, but the young Princess Elizabeth insisted that the cameras, and
thus the viewing public, be allowed right into the abbey. Thanks to her
shrewd move the coronation was the first great national occasion when
television attracted a bigger audience than radio.
In the following 39 years relations between Fleet Street and Buckingham
Palace have ranged from bad to dreadful but, thanks partly to television's
need to negotiate access for its equipment, the relationship with television
has been, from the crown's point of view, excellent.
Of course a law of diminishing returns applies here as anywhere: no
subsequent programme can match the novelty value of Richard Cawston's
memorable 1969 documentary Royal Family which first took us behind the
scenes of Royalty Ltd. However, this week's programme, made by Edward
Mirzoeff, is not an attempt to repeat that. Apart from a holiday scene
showing the Queen taking her grandchildren pony riding it concentrates
almost entirely on the activities of the sovereign herself, and thus shifts
the focus of media attention from the troublesome younger members of the
family back to the dutiful head of state.
We see her with politicians, at a breathtakingly grand banquet for Lech
Walesa in Windsor Castle, paying visits to the US and Africa, dishing out
gongs, and teasing Edward Heath with the remark that he could be allowed to
go to Baghdad because he was now expendable. We see the Queen run for the
first time (to catch the finish of a horse race on which she wins Pounds 16)
and we see her opening a little selection of the 200 or 300 letters she
receives daily, though typically no one explains how the lucky few are
chosen.
However gratifying for royalists, these little revelations are as nothing
compared to the major insight which this programme permits. It finally
proves what we have so long suspected: that the British monarchy has gone
from strength to strength in the second half of the 20th century because,
instead of being traditionally 'aristocratic' in its outlook and attitudes,
it is profoundly middle class. Watching this sturdy, bustling woman,
switching efficiently from glad rags to Barbour and headscarf, countless
viewers will have wondered 'Who does she remind me of?' Eventually the
answer will have dawned: Auntie Betty, bulwark of the WI and the church
flower committee.
