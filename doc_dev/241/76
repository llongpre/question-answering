FT  25 NOV 92 / Letter: Royals would improve their lot if they treated
public with respect

Sir, While in Britain recently, I had the opportunity of visiting Windsor
Castle, now sadly damaged by the fire. While I appreciate that it is a
residence of members of the royal family, I was not impressed by the very
high admission charges and the general feeling that public visitors were
treated largely as an unavoidable nuisance.
Two days beforehand, I had the pleasure of visiting the White House in
Washington, where I paid no admission charge and was told proudly by the
official guides that 'this building belongs to the people of the United
States, and we are honoured to be able to share it with our citizens and
guests from abroad'.
I suspect that if a similar attitude were displayed by your royal family and
those who represent them, they may receive much more sympathy from the
public both in Britain and abroad. Furthermore, as I understand that the
majority of the damage was inflicted on areas not even accessible to the
general public, it seems rather presumptuous to ask British taxpayers to
foot the damage bill.
