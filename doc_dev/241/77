   A journalist was fined $750 after
refusing to identify the person who reportedly gave him a love
letter that a waitress sent to a married police officer assigned to
guard Queen Elizabeth II.
   The Sun, a London tabloid that employed the defendant James
Lawson as a free-lance reporter, published the letter under the
headline: ``Royal Copper Ditches Wife for Bargirl.''
   Before being fined for contempt of court on Tuesday, Lawson told
the presiding magistrate: ``I don't want to prejudice my source.''
   Lawson was a witness at Stonehaven Sheriff Court in Scotland
when Stanley Jaffray pleaded innocent to stealing the letter last
November.
   Prosecutor James Mackay said the waitress met the officer when
he was a guard at Balmoral Castle, the queen's summer residence in
Scotland, and they exchanged letters after he returned to Windsor
Castle near London.
   Jaffray was freed for lack of evidence on the basis of testimony
that he found the letter outside a post office.
