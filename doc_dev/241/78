<HEAD>British Bandleader Joe Loss Dead at 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Bandleader Joe Loss, a favorite of Britain's royal
family, died in a London hospital Wednesday, his agent said. Loss
was 80 and recently celebrated his 60th anniversary in the music
business.
   He had suffered from kidney problems, agent Robert Holmes said.
   Loss was born Joshua Alexander Loss, the son of a cabinetmaker
who wanted him to become a classical violinist. Loss' first job was
playing the violin in silent films for about $2.50 a week.
   He was fascinated by dance band music and at 20 became Britain's
youngest band leader, playing at the Astoria Ballroom in Charing
Cross Road in London.
   Loss once said he had married more couples than any clergyman
because of the number of people who wed after meeting at his dances.
   The Joe Loss Orchestra played many years on the cruise ship Queen
Elizabeth II and entertained the royal family at Buckingham Palace
and Windsor Castle.
   Dame Vera Lynn was accompanied by Loss' band on her first radio
broadcast.
   His signature tune ``In the Mood,'' sold 1 million copies.
   Loss claimed the secret of his long career was his energetic
foot-tapping.
   ``I once put on a pedometer and discovered that I had walked
eight miles in a three-hour performance,'' he said.
   Loss announced his retirement last year, but played in London in
February and had planned more appearances.
