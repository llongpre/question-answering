"The Glory of England" (Traveloguer Collection, 60 minutes, 1989). 
</P>
<P>
Frank Nichols' video explores only England, with an itinerary extended to such 
less-filmed sites as Hadrian's Wall to the north and Land's End south at 
Cornwall. 
</P>
<P>
Other scenes include reenactments of local historical events and scenes of 
medieval festivities that, although bearing the "made-for-the-tourist" label, 
are colorful and entertaining for armchair travelers. 
</P>
<P>
After touring Dover and Canterbury, Nichols goes to Cambridge for a jousting 
tournament at Belvoir Castle. In Sherwood Forest, actors reenact scenes from 
the legend of Robin Hood and in the Peaks District a performance of English 
country dancers is held. 
</P>
<P>
Exploring the North Yorkshire region, the video focuses on the city of York, 
its archeological sites, old Shambles area and the beautiful stained-glass 
windows of York Minster, plus a side trip to a country fair and fox hunt at 
Castle Howard, the setting for TV's "Brideshead Revisited." 
</P>
<P>
A visit with author/veterinarian James Herriot takes place at his "surgery" 
(doctor's office) in the Yorkshire Dales. The St. Wilfred's Day parade at Ripon 
presents some colorful scenes. Then the camera journeys to Bamburgh Castle and 
the Roman-built Hadrian's Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Shown is the lovely Lake District and Chester, where the town crier still 
appears every afternoon, and Abbotts Bromley, where the unusual Horn Dance 
takes place. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of London, visited are Warwick Castle, Shakespeare's Stratford-on-Avon, 
Oxford University, Blenheim Palace, Bourton-on-the-Water and the charming 
village of Castle Combe in the Cotswolds. 
</P>
<P>
Back in London, viewers can take a Thames River cruise, peek at the crown 
jewels, attend an Elizabethan banquet at Hatfield House and visit Windsor 
Castle and town. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to visiting Stonehenge and Bath, viewers can march along the trail 
of King Arthur to Winchester, where his round table hangs, and to Glastonbury 
Abbey, associated with legends of Arthur and the Holy Grail. 
</P>

<P>
"Australia" (Laura McKenzie, Republic Pictures Home Video, 60 minutes, 1988). 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie combines a lively, knowledgeable narration with a well-photographed 
video that offers an entertaining supplement to the standard guide book. 
Although she doesn't visit Perth or Adelaide, McKenzie provides some alternate 
sights and offers personal observations and candid advice. 
</P>
<P>
Incorporated into the segments are lists for sightseeing and shopping, hotels 
and restaurants from modest to deluxe, local transportation tips, night life 
choices, side trips and suggested city itineraries. It even has a course in 
"Aussie English." 
</P>
<P>
The Sydney tour takes in most of the traditional sights such as the opera house 
and bridge, museums, Chinatown, the shops of Double Bay, Queen Victoria mall, 
Paddy's Flea market and Bondi and Manly beaches, where a blimp ride offers 
sightseeing. 
</P>
<P>
In Melbourne, the film covers the cathedral, National Art Gallery, Victoria 
Arts Center, the zoo, Chinatown and such shops as those on Upper Collins 
Street, the Bourke Street arcades and Queen Victoria Market. 
</P>
<P>
Side trips are to Ballarat for its theme park, Sovereign Hill, a restored gold 
town, and afterward to Phillip Island to see the fairy penguins. 
</P>
<P>
In Queensland, the video tours Brisbane, roving through King George Square, St. 
John's Cathedral, an 1820 windmill, the botanical gardens, Queen's Street Mall, 
Wintergarden shopping center and Chinatown. There also are stops at the
