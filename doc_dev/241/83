<LEADPARA>  Surely you recognize the state landau, with its curious landing lights. HM the
Q signed it out Tuesday to provide us with today's first royal picture while
taking Lech Walesa to Windsor Castle.;    This is the only visit to Britain so
far by a Polish head of state, and we knew you'd want to be there. Walesa and
his wife, Danuta, will stay at Windsor three days. We don't know why Danuta
isn't in the picture. Maybe she's driving.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A familiar figure occupies today's second royal picture. Princess Diana is
in Brazil with Prince Charles. This shot was taken Tuesday in Brasilia.;   
Later, Charles discussed the destruction of the rain forest with Brazilian
President Fernando Collor de Mello while Diana traded pleasantries with first
lady Rosane Collor . . . and civil servants staged a noisy strike outside.;   
Today, Charles and Diana will go to Sao Paulo, where the prince will give a
speech titled "Business in the Community and the Environment" while local
business leaders pretend to be interested.;    Pushing his theme to the limit,
Charles on Friday will open an environmental seminar aboard the royal yacht
Britannia, parked at Belem.  </TEXT>
