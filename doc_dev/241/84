FT  14 JAN 92 / Crown jewels to have a change of setting

THE crown jewels, one of Britain's most priceless assets, are to be made
more accessible to the public. The move is aimed at maximising revenue for
the Department of the Environment - currently estimated at Pounds 11.5m a
year in visitors' receipts. But it might prove a nightmare in terms of
security.
The centuries-old jewels consist of the regalia of the English crown - the
Scottish regalia are kept in Edinburgh Castle - together with jewellery
brought together by a variety of European sovereigns. They include the
Imperial State Crown, which contains 3,538 diamonds, 17 sapphires, eight
emeralds, five rubies and 165 pearls.
The Historic Royal Palaces Agency, which manages the jewels on behalf of the
DoE, has approved plans to move the jewels from their present location 50 ft
below ground at the Tower of London to a larger room on the ground floor of
the Tower by April 1994.
The jewels' present home was built in 1967 when the Tower was taking in
between 5,000 and 8,000 visitors a day. A trebling in the number of
potential visitors to the Tower over the last 20 years has meant that the
jewels have become increasingly difficult to look at in comfort.
Col Hamish Mackinlay, deputy governor at the Tower, insisted last night that
in its drive to make the jewels more accessible to the public, every
precaution would be taken not to make it easier for 'another Captain Blood'
to attempt to steal them.
In 1671, Irish-born Captain Blood, a renegade officer in the service of King
Charles II, was arrested with his two accomplices after attempting to run
away with various regal items of considerable worth.
One security expert, aware of the present-day existence of more
sophisticated criminals, warned that there would have to be a thorough
'threat analysis' before the jewels were finally transferred. 'Security is
going to have to be the best available. If anything was to happen to such a
valuable asset, it would be disastrous.'
Lehrer McGovern International, the US construction management company owned
by Bovis, the UK construction group, has won the project management for the
contract. Security Training International is acting as the consultant on
security.
During the Second World War, George VI ordered Garrard's, the royal
jewellers, to remove the jewels from the Tower and submerge them in a lake
at Windsor Castle in order to prevent the Germans from getting hold of them.
Yesterday the Tower said the jewels were temporarily closed to the public,
for their two-week annual cleaning by Garrard's. Last night Garrard's would
not put a value on the jewels. It said: 'The jewels are irreplaceable.'
