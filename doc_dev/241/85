<HEAD>Prince of Wales Named Author of Year in Britain</HEAD>

   The Prince of Wales, who penned a bestselling book
that criticized much of modern architecture as lacking character,
was named author of the year Thursday at a British awards ceremony.
   ``A Vision of Britain'' by Prince Charles has been among the top
selling books since it was published last year.
   American and Canadian editions of the book have sold well and it
has also been translated into Italian.
   In the book, the prince said some modern architects replaced the
traditions and harmonies of the past with ``Frankenstein monsters,
devoid of character, alien and largely unloved except by the
professors who have been concocting these horrors in their
laboratories.''
   Charles, 41-year-old heir to the British throne, won the first
Author of the Year award. It was accepted on his behalf by
Christopher Martin, who produced a British Broadcasting Corp.
documentary in which the prince guided viewers around some
buildings he liked and many he didn't.
   The program was seen by 4{ million British viewers when it was
first shown more than a year ago, and by 3.7 million when it was
repeated. It was shown this month on public television in the
United States.
   The book also led to an exhibition at London's Victoria and
Albert Museum that attracted 45,000 visitors _ the museum's most
popular event in 1989.
   In a videotaped acceptance speech to 500 authors and publishers,
Charles said: ``I couldn't have been more amazed that my name was
included because when I entered this venture I had considerable
cold feet about the result.
   ``I was much amused when I heard that the local bookshop in
Windsor had a sign over the copies of the book which said `local'
author _ not strictly true, but a good idea.''
   Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, has a castle in Windsor.
