   Burmese, familiar to millions as Queen Elizabeth
II's favorite ceremonial horse, died after suffering a stroke,
Buckingham Palace said Wednesday. The horse was 28.
   The jet black mare, ridden by the monarch in 18 Trooping the
Color ceremonies, died Tuesday at Windsor Palace, 22 miles west of
London, and will be buried in adjacent Windsor Home Park, the
palace said.
   Burmese was given to the queen by the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police in 1969, and was featured in a postcard with the queen
riding side-saddle in a scarlet Guards uniform.
   The horse was retired from ceremonial duties in 1986, and the
queen switched to a horse-drawn carriage for Trooping the Color,
the annual military pageant marking her birthday.
   When the mare was retired, trainer Sylvia Stanier said the queen
had a rapport with Burmese and was ``hesitant to start on another
horse.''
   Burmese worked for the police until 1988 when she was put out to
pasture in Windsor Home Park.
