   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday
announced cuts in the production of radioactive material for
nuclear weapons and ended a triumphant stop in Britain by inviting
Queen Elizabeth II to Moscow.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared Gorbachev's visit
``very successful, warm and friendly,'' but appeared unimpressed by
his concessions in the military field.
   She said the reductions in weapons-grade material ``will have no
effect in practice'' because ``they probably have quite a
sufficient stockpile of uranium.''
   In Washington, President Bush declined to comment on Gorbachev's
announcement, saying he had not had time to review its significance.
   A Pentagon official said the steps sketched by Gorbachev would
not have a major impact on Soviet capability to wage nuclear war.
   Although Gorbachev said arms control would stall unless the West
dropped plans to modernize its short-range nuclear missiles, Mrs.
Thatcher said her belief in a nuclear deterrent remains firm.
   Gorbachev insisted NATO had an advantage over the Warsaw Pact in
every area but tanks and said: ``In short, fears of the `Soviet
military threat' are groundless.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said East bloc forces still outnumber the Western
alliance 2-1.
   On a happier note, she said the queen gave ``a very definite
yes'' to the invitation extended during Gorbachev's lunch with
Elizabeth at Windsor Palace.
   No date was set for the visit, the first by a British monarch
since the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. Czar Nicholas II, who was
killed with his family by the Communists, was a cousin of the
queen's grandfather.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa spent 40 hours in Britain before
flying home and ending a six-day journey that also took them to
Ireland and Cuba.
   In London's Guildhall, the 1,000-year-old seat of city
government, Gorbachev rubbed shoulders with robed, bewigged
notables, marched behind the ceremonial macebearer and generally
seemed to enjoy his encounter with traditional British pageantry.
   Then, with Mrs. Thatcher seated before him, he delivered an
unusually brief 27-minute speech.
   He said the Soviet Union would halt production this year of
weapons-grade uranium and will shut down two more reactors that
produce plutonium for nuclear weapons by the end of next year.
   He called it ``another major step toward the complete cessation
of production of fissionable materials for use in weapons.''
   Later Friday, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov refused to say at a briefing which reactors would be
closed or give their locations.
   The Defense Department official, who refused to be further
identified, said, ``They (the Soviets) have weapons material coming
out of medium and short-range missiles. There has been as
assessment that they have stockpiles of weapons-grade materials.''
   If the Soviets shut down weapons reactors for several years,
they could restart them later when the military begins to run low
of weapons material.
   Gorbachev's statement did not provide adequate information for
Pentagon analysts to assess what impact the steps would have on
producing plutunium and tritium, the two materials needed for
modern thermonuclear weapons. Gorbachev did not mention tritium.
   It was one of several recent pronouncements by Gorbachev about
arms reduction. In December, he announced to the United Nations the
Soviet Union soon would begin reducing its standing army by 500,000
men and withdrawing troops and tanks from Europe and the Chinese
frontier.
   He praised Britain for unilaterally discarding chemical weapons
and said his country recently completed a facility, which British
experts would be invited to inspect, for destroying its own stocks.
   The hitherto secret Soviet defense budget will be published, he
said.
   Reviewing his plan to reform Soviet society, Gorbachev
acknowledged he initially had not realized the magnitude of the
task.
   In an apparent attempt to reassure Westerners who fear a
conservative backlash, he said: ``There is no turning back for
anyone. The people have firmly linked their destiny with
perestroika.''
   Gorbachev got a standing ovation and a resounding endorsement by
Mrs. Thatcher. ``We want you to succeed in your task'' she said in
her reply, and promised ``to help in practical ways, too, where our
help is sought and desired.''
   At a news conference later, the prime minister said she found
Gorbachev ``as dynamic, determined, stimulating and confident as
ever.''
   She has met him five times, three of them on visits he has made
to Britain.
   Recalling the first encounter, when he came to Britain in 1984
as No. 2 man in the Kremlin, she said: ``Some years ago I think I
said I thought Mr. Gorbachev was a man I could do business with. I
might just repeat today that I think that he is a person with whom
I look forward to doing more business.''
   Both sides acknowledged the talks were tough, argumentative and
yielded little practical progress, but the visit was a public
relations triumph for Gorbachev.
   After the speech he walked into admiring crowds for the second
time on the trip, and his televised appearance with the queen
guaranteed him new prestige with the royalty-loving British public.
   The 63-year-old monarch, in a bright pink cape and skirt, led
the Gorbachevs around Windsor Castle, a royal residence for 800
years, before lunch with her husband, Prince Philip; her son,
Edward; Mrs. Thatcher; and 33 other guests.
   Gorbachev later arrived home in Moscow, the official Tass news
agency reported Friday night without giving details.
