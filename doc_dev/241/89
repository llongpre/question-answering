<TEXT>     Popular king; Aside from his penchant for solving arguments with the ax,
Henry VIII was widely admired by his subjects throughout his 38-year reign.
His enthusiastic participation in jousting was regarded as proof he was one of
them, and his uncommonly handsome looks -- at least in his youth -- and
acquisition of great wealth were seen as testament to the budding glory of
England.;   "He wasn't the worst being, but he wasn't the best either," said
John Maher, a warder at the Tower of London's Royal Armouries. "If you dig
through all the scribs and scrolls, I think you'll find that was Harry.";  
The birthday of Henry VIII, one of the world's most intriguing historic
figures, is being celebrated in festivities all over England this year.
Indeed, while touring England it is difficult to find a Tudor castle or
fortification Henry didn't have some connection with.;   Family ties; Born the
second son of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, Henry Tudor initially had no
hopes of being king. When his older brother, Arthur, died in 1502, however,
Henry became heir to the throne and succeeded his father in 1509. Henry is
best remembered for his six wives, his gluttony and for forming the Church of
England after the pope refused to grant Henry's request for an annulment.;  
Less well-known is that Henry VIII accumulated more wealth -- albeit much of
it stolen from monasteries -- and did more building than any other English
king in history, including acquisition of more than 2,000 fine tapestries. He
began his reign with only a dozen palaces, but had 55 by his death in 1547.;  
At the center of birthday celebrations is Henry VIII at Greenwich, an exhibit
that runs through Aug. 31 at the National Maritime Museum in the London suburb
of Greenwich. It is near the former site of Placentia palace, where Henry was
born on June 28, 1491, and where he married two of his wives -- Catherine of
Aragon and Anne of Cleves. Greenwich was one of his favorite palaces because
of its close proximity to his ships, including the Great Harry, first
four-master to be launched in England.;   The exhibit focuses on Henry's
ostentatious lifestyle and place in European history, re-creating rooms of
Placentia palace and displaying some of Henry's belongings. Included are
paintings, illuminated manuscripts, treaties exchanged with European leaders,
household inventories, jewelry, portrait miniatures and armor that paint a
portrait of Henry as an accomplished sportsman, musician, dancer, theologian,
linguist and intellectual.;   But Henry's bedchamber at Placentia was the
scene of his greatest humiliation: his failure to consummate his marriage to
Anne of Cleves, his fourth wife, whom he nicknamed his "Flanders mare" because
of her plain looks. A doctor's record, which detailed Henry's inability -- or
unwillingness -- to perform sexually is on public display for the first time
in this exhibit, clashing with Henry's popular image as a lusty womanizer.;  
In search of a male heir to carry on the Tudor line, Henry divorced his first
wife, Catherine of Aragon, and had Anne Boleyn, whom he accused of adultery,
beheaded. Marriage to Jane Seymour followed; she died shortly after giving
birth, finally, to Henry's heir, Prince Edward, in 1537.;   Henry's search for
a queen didn't end with the birth of his heir; marriage No. 4, to Anne of
Cleves, ended in divorce, and No. 5, to Catherine Howard, in execution (again,
the charge was adultery). Henry's sixth wife, Catherine Parr, survived Henry
by one year.;   One of the highlights of any Henry VIII trip is the nearby
Tower of London, where Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were executed, Anne by
double-edged sword and Catherine by ax. The somewhat secluded scaffold site,
used only to execute women, is marked by a chopping block and a plaque, and
both queens' bodies are buried in the floor of the adjacent Chapel Royal of
St. Peter ad Vincula, the 1105 church Henry restored during his reign.;  
Henry was reputed to have been hunting on the grounds of nearby Hampton Court
Palace during Catherine's execution; when the monarch heard the firing of guns
to signify her beheading, he is said to have given no pause and gone about his
sport.;   "He was a cold brute," said Maher, who guards Henry's suit of armor
at the Tower of London. "That was his only way of settling an argument -- with
the block.";   A visit to White Tower, the dominant building in the Tower of
London compound, will hint at how Henry lived during the early years of his
reign, when the four-towered building was his chief London residence. Although
it is strictly a museum now, of the Royal Armouries, its thick stone walls,
high ceilings and rough fireplaces reveal stark living conditions. Still,
Henry's banquets there were reputed to last eight hours.;   The Tower of
London gained a reputation during Henry's reign as the chief prison of state
with famous inmates such as Sir Thomas More, Henry's chancellor. Nestled in a
corner of the tower grounds is Henry's wedding gift to Anne Boleyn, a timbered
house not accessible to the public today.;   Visiting Hampton Court Palace
will reveal one of Henry's favorite rooms anywhere, the Great Hall, with its
magnificent hammer beam roof. The spacious room, which was dominated in
Henry's time by a great central fireplace, is among the few elaborate
additions still visible today that he made to Hampton Court after he was given
the palace by a grudging Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.;   It was at the palace that
Henry was betrothed to Jane Seymour, who later died at Hampton Court after
giving birth to the future Edward VI. Henry also lived there with his last
wife, Catherine Parr, although his living chambers are long gone.;   More
interesting perhaps than even his Great Hall are the elaborate kitchens Henry
added to Hampton Court to accommodate his burgeoning 800-person court. A
self-guided audio tour takes visitors through the extensive kitchens,
detailing interesting facts such as how Henry spent more than 3,000 pounds a
year to keep his wine cellars stocked. A scale model of the kitchens as they
were in 1542 re-creates the elaborate preparations taken for a midsummer's
feast.;   Although Hampton Court was one of his favorite residences, Henry
would quickly abandon it in favor of his smaller country residences when
bubonic plague was raging in the London area. Among palaces he visited on such
occasions was the picturesque Leeds Castle in Maidstone, about an hour
southeast of London, a worthy addition to any Henry VIII tour.;   Set on three
islands on a small lake, Leeds Castle is most people's vision of a fairy tale
castle with its Nottinghamlike park setting and its King Arthurian
architecture.;   It was at Leeds that Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon
stopped en route to the Field of the Cloth of Gold, the great meeting of Henry
and Francis I of France near Calais to celebrate the Anglo-French alliance of
1518. (The tournament meeting is documented in the magnificent "The Field of
the Cloth of Gold" painting of 1545 that is on display at the Henry VIII at
Greenwich exhibit.);   Not far from Leeds and also in Kent County, home to one
of the largest concentrations of Henry VIII buildings, are Deal Castle (one of
the many coastal fortifications Henry had built to prevent invasion) and Hever
Castle (childhood home of Anne Boleyn that Henry bestowed on Anne of Cleves
after Anne Boleyn's execution).;   As Henry aged he lost much of his good
looks to overindulgence, although at 6 feet tall he continued to be a
commanding presence throughout his life. He was bothered in later years by
ulcerated legs, which resulted from a jousting injury, and he nearly died from
a resulting blood clot when the ulcers healed over. The ulcers were henceforth
kept open by his doctors.;   "Even when he lay in bed dying, they (his staff)
went in covering their noses to have a look to see if he was still alive," the
Tower of London's Maher said.;   Maher accepts the common belief that the
hefty monarch died of syphilis, but recent evidence points to scurvy as the
culprit. Henry was also senile at the end of his life.;   When the 56-year-old
monarch died in his vast new palace of Whitehall in 1547, his country was
largely self-governing, the Royal Navy was strong and England was at peace. He
is buried at Windsor with Jane Seymour.  </TEXT>
