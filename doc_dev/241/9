forward a personal view of the damage wreaked by the fire at the castle

The loss from the fire at Windsor castle has nothing to do with Heritage,
that now hateful, vulgar, sentimental word. Nor is it about the cost of
repairs, nor the loss of objects and artefacts, however wonderful. The loss
I feel as one who spent his boyhood in the shadow of that great tower is
harder to explain: an enormous, possibly irreparable, damage to the spirit
of the place and what it represents to Englishmen.
Samuel Pepys called Windsor: 'The most romantic castle that is in the
world'. It is also the largest inhabited castle in the world, and has been
in continuous habitation, since the time of the William the Conqueror. It
is, by any measure, extraordinary and wonderful.
Even as the flames swept through the great hall on Friday night, television
announcers were meanly asking how much it would all cost; and the row about
who will pay continues in Parliament and elsewhere. Good God: could they not
see that some 900 years of our common history has gone up in smoke. Yes, I
admit, I take the disaster personally. For those of us who lived in the
town, that familiar towering silhouette was always present, as constant as
Fuji-san is to a Japanese or the Eiffel Tower to a Parisian. I saw it from
my bedroom window, on my way to school, from the Great Park, from the forest
at Dedworth, or away across the Brocas and along the river from Boveney
Lock. There it would be, through the trees, around every corner.
But it would change, too, with every shift of the clouds and mood of the
weather. I remember it in the long damp week between the death of the King
and his funeral, so quiet and still, shrouded in the mists of early
February. Most of all I remember the funeral itself, we children standing at
the top of the Long Walk inside the Park gates, the crunch of wheels and
feet on the gravel, the shadowy, veiled figures in the closed coach, the
bands, the shouted orders coming towards us through the mist, past us and
away, the minute guns, boom, boom, in the Park: and all the while the white
looming walls of the Castle just barely visible through the fog.
I would often go into the Castle, a marvellously safe place for a schoolboy
to be when he shouldn't be, with nothing better to do than slope off for a
smoke and to admire the view. I would go up the Round Tower, or pay my
sixpence to go into the Curfew Tower with its clock and dungeons, or
perhaps, late in the afternoon, slip into St George's to hear sung Evensong.
One special game, at the height of the tourist season, was to go out along
the North Terrace, just where the fire has destroyed St George's Hall, to
where one long queue was waiting to go into the State Apartments, and
another, even longer, was waiting to see The Queen's Dolls' House. I would
walk alone between the two lines and up to the barrier, which, after a low,
brief exchange, would be unhooked to let me pass. 'Yes sir? You wish to see
the drawings, sir? Of course. This way, sir.' Insufferable.
I felt, as many others did, intensely proprietorial about the place. I too
had - still have - a Windsor Castle of my very own - ancient, familiar,
comfortable, romantic, fixing the present so very firmly in the continuous
historic past. And it is a feeling about the place itself, and the town
which grew up around it, and the countryside of river and park beyond, and
the people who made it what it is.
