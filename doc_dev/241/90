FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Outlay on British Library to drop after 1996 -
Department of National Heritage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Planned spending by the Department of National Heritage will drop between
1995-96 and 1996-97 because of a projected reduction in spending on the
British Library's new building at St Pancras. In a statement the government
said spending for 1994-95 would be Pounds 976m, Pounds 998m in 1995-96,
dropping to Pounds 971m in 1996-97.
The Arts Council grant will increase plans by Pounds 800,000 in 1994-95, and
by Pounds 1.6m in 1995-96, giving a grant of Pounds 186.9m. This level of
grant will be maintained in 1996-97.
The Crafts Council grant will increase by Pounds 100,000 over current plans
each year, rising to Pounds 3.2m in 1994-95 and Pounds 3.3m in 1995-96 and
1996-97.
Annual expenditure on the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme (BSlS) will
rise over this year's figures by Pounds 300,000 in each of the next three
years.
Since 1984, Pounds 23.7m of government investment will, by the end of the
current financial year, have produced Pounds 48.3m in new sponsorship for
the arts.
The department directly finances 17 institutions including the Museums and
Galleries Commission. The department has made its allocations to individual
institutions so that over the planning period no individual institution
experiences a cut in its provision and some see substantial increases.
As a result, work can begin on a number of key areas - on the replacement of
the Natural History Museum's Spirit Building and of the Motive Power Depot
at the National Railway Museum in York, and on the redevelopment of the
south hall of the Horniman Museum.
In addition, in recognition of success in attracting money from the private
sector, the Tate Gallery will receive more than Pounds 2m over three years
to help with the relocation of their stores, and with the development of the
north-west quadrant at Millbank, the National Gallery will receive Pounds 1m
in 1996-97 towards the cost of redeveloping their North Extension, the
British Museum will receive Pounds 1m in the final year for the development
at Bloomsbury, and the Imperial War Museum will receive a total of Pounds
600,000 in the first two years for conservation.
Provision for the St Pancras project readjusts spending plans within total
planned expenditure of Pounds 450m. Provision has been made in the library's
grant-in-aid for 1996-97 to ease the financial pressure caused by the move
from Bloomsbury.
The grant for English Heritage for 1994-95 remains at the increased level
which was agreed last year. The settlement allows work to start on the
Albert Memorial in 1994-95. This is the result of an offer by English
Heritage to make available up to Pounds 1m next year fiom savings achieved
through their forward strategy. That strategy will permit further funds to
be transferred fiom overheads to direct spending on the heritage.
Over the three-year period a total of Pounds 15m will be available for fire
prevention measures in the Historic Royal Palaces, following up the
recommendations in Sir Alan Bailey's report.
The baseline for the Royal Household is restored to the levels planned
before the 1992 public expenditure survey. This will cover the government's
share of the cost of restoring Windsor Castle. It will also allow the Royal
Household to continue speedily with its Pounds 15m programme to implement
the Bailey recommendations on the occupied Royal Palaces.
Work on the joint venture project for a new Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds
is about to start. For 1994-95 Pounds 3m will be allocated rising to Pounds
6m in 1995-96 and 1996-97. The funds will be provided fiom the Historic
Royal Palaces Agency baseline.
An additional Pounds 2.5m over the next two years has been made available
for the tourist boards in recognition of tourism's importance to the
economy.
The budget for the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme for sport is to be
increased by 10 per cent from Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.3m. This recognises how
successful the Sportsmatch scheme has been in attracting private sector
sponsorship for grassroots sport during its first year of operation. The new
budget continues in 1995-96 and 1996-97 and should generate matching funding
from the private sector.
The Sports Council's grant-in-aid for 1994-95 will be slightly less in cash
terms than this year's allocation. However, the decision not to proceed with
the previously announced restructuring of sports administration gives the
council greater flexibility in allocating its resources and we would not
expect there to be any significant adverse effect on the work of the
council. Moreover, the paymaster-general announced on July 22 that a VAT
exemption for the supply of certain sporting services by non-profit making
organisations was under consideration. This should be of significant benefit
for voluntary sports organisations and further details will be available in
the New Year.
The grant to the British Film Institute, as already announced, shows a
substantial increase in 1994-95 when Pounds 2m more than in 1993-94 will be
provided. That figure continues in the following two years. This will focus
on enhancement of the rate of duplicating decaying nitrate film, some
re-equipment and an expansion of the off-air television recording programme.
The European Co-Production Fund was set up for a three-year period in 1991.
Over that period it received Pounds 5m. The government has announced that
the fund will be extended for a new three-year period and will receive a
total grant of Pounds 6m.
This will give the fund an opportunity to develop and build on its successes
in supporting co-productions between European partners.
