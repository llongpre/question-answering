Englishman's home is his castle - if he can find one at the right price -
probably in Scotland

ENGLAND has so few castles to live in that the benighted English have to
make do with words: 'My home is my castle' - a mythical place where the
world intrudes only by invitation, and the stout-hearted owner pulls up the
drawbridge by switching on the burglar alarm. Or Englishmen build
castellated follies as sentimental substitutes, and dream of kings and
glory.
Why are castles rare, when they are common in Scotland and Ireland, and in
France? Defence and subjugation are the main purpose of these buildings. But
the long era of domestic peace in England meant that there was hardly any
need to build them after the Middle Ages, or to maintain the medieval
castles. They are mostly ruins, while still-used medieval churches stay
spick and span. Instead, the English started building grand country houses,
which did not have fortifications, except by antiquarian whim, but did have
the same economic power as the castles and monasteries.
Across the Channel the French do not live in country houses or have a
translation for the English term. They have chateaux. It is always a
surprise travelling in France how many there are, and that most of them are
basically military. But think of the invasions and evenements France has
suffered - and remember the fate of the nobles in the French Revolution -
and it makes sense to live in a castle or, in the 19th century, to follow
tradition and build a house looking like one.
In Scotland and Ireland the story is similar. Life was uncertain for
centuries. Even when it improved, the tradition, and the memories of 1745
and the Young Pretender or the Irish uprising of 1798 - and the ensuing
repressions by the English - were so alive that castles never disappeared.
Many houses in Scotland began as fortified tower houses, with the main room
on the first floor reached by a spiral staircase, and pepperpot turrets
where the laird's sentry could shoot at the rival clan coming to attack, as
happened often.
In the 19th century Scottish castles became more spacious. The tower-core
had wings added and an extra staircase or two, built in the Scottish
Baronial style which had become a romantic way of showing that Scotland was
separate from England. Mish-mash, enlarged castle houses are the result,
pleasing for the romantic sense of danger they exude.
The spiritual foundations for Scottish castles were tradition and Walter
Scott's stories. With steep roofs and round turrets, these Scottish castles
look like chateaux and reflect the anti-English Auld Alliance of Scotland
and France.
Gardyne Castle, in Angus, eastern Scotland, is a multi-period castle, for
sale from Savills with a guide price of more than Pounds 390,000 (but
needing a thorough redecoration). The Gardyne family built it as a tower in
the 17th century, when they were battling the Guthrie clan. It has three
fine pepperpots and a 'dungeon' connected to the drawing room by an access
hidden in a cupboard. Later additions make it a sympathetic family fortress
with plenty of room.
The walled garden on a south-east facing slope running down to the burn is a
golden opportunity for a serious gardener. It already has a laburnum walk.
The Gulf Stream helps the gardens at Penkill Castle in Ayrshire on the west
side of Scotland, also 16th century and acquired in the 17th century by the
Boyd family, who rebuilt it in the 19th when their friend, Pre-Raphaelite
artist William Bell Scott, painted murals up the staircase to illustrate The
King's Quair, a poem written in 1420 by James I of Scotland when imprisoned
in Windsor Castle. Scott included W A Swinburne as a courtier of Venus, and
himself with Alice Boyd's pet duck. In this century Elton Eckstrand, an
American devotee of the Pre-Raphaelites, bought it and restored it. He has
instructed Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in Edinburgh, to sell this chateau
extraordinaire for more than Pounds 300,000.
Kinnaird Castle is gloriously placed, overlooking the Firth of Tay between
Perth and Dundee (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, offers over Pounds 500,000), with a
king's room, prison, doo'cot (dovecot, still working) and a famous alpine
garden. A lonely alternative, unscarred by 19th century Baronial additions,
is Freswick on the Caithness coast in the north of Scotland, offered by
Hamptons at more than Pounds 175,000 and needing work. It is another 16th
century building, incorporating a mediaeval tower and a Viking hall.
For the full 19th century romantic experience, consider Dunselma near Dunoon
in Argyll, built in 1887 by the son of the Coats textile family, and on sale
at more than Pounds 370,000 from Hamptons. In Edinburgh, Peffermill is a
1636 tower house, on sale for only the second time in its 356 years and
sympathetically restored so that it keeps the simplicity - some would say
austerity - that a castle should have. Warriors do not need fitted carpets.
Offers over Pounds 390,000, from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
Sundrum Castle, in Ayrshire, dates back to the 14th century, with many
alterations. Now Salopian Estates is converting it into separate houses. The
owners will take a share in the estate company and pay for maintaining the
gardens, woods, park and tennis court. Inquiries to West Highland Estates or
Cluttons.
In England, Clearwell Castle, in Gloucestershire, is an attractive-looking
18th century Gothic concoction with battlements, at present a country house
hotel, which Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Hereford offers at over Pounds
750,000. More remarkable is the castle that Sir John Vanbrugh, architect of
Blenheim and Castle Howard, built for himself in Greenwich, south east
London, at the top of Maze Hill. It has been divided into four houses, one
of which is for sale from John D. Wood for around Pounds 400,000 - worth it
for the view across Greenwich Palace to the City of London, let alone the
pleasure of living in Vanbrugh's own house (listed Grade I).
For the same price Humberts is selling the castellated Castle Lodge, at the
foot of the castle mound, at Lewes, Sussex. The castle is now a ruin open to
the public, and not available.
A complete Victorian fort can be bought for Pounds 1m. Fort Corblets, on
Alderney, in the Channel Islands, was built to keep the French in check, and
converted in the 1970s into a family house. It brings the tax haven
advantages of the Channel Islands and overlooks a sandy beach. Agents are
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley or Swoffers in Guernsey. If you need a castle in
Ireland, Jackson Stops McCabe usually has one or two on its books.
