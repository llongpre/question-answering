<LEADPARA>  We'll wrap up our coverage of Lech and Danuda Walesa in the United Kingdom
with this shot of Lech and Queen Elizabeth at a London banquet thrown by the
Polish chief. Our spies at Buckingham P. say the relevance of this four-day
trip is that Walesa is the first Pole ever afforded a full state visit in
Britain. He and his wife have been staying at Windsor Castle. Prince Philip
stands at the far right. Our photographer didn't identify the others.  </LEADPARA>
