FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: History at a premium - The costs of
rebuilding - especially a period property - can far exceed those of simple
purchase

HOUSES ARE cheap today. Many can be bought for very much less than they
would cost to build. Large, period properties are especially good value.
Most people consider Britain's heritage of fine houses to be irreplaceable
works of art - so valuable that owners have to gamble on when insurance
premiums are due each year. In extreme cases, such as the magnificent
Herstmonceux castle in East Sussex, the cost of re-building would be 10
times the selling price, and that leaves aside the value of the priceless
gardens and parkland.
The dilemma facing owners of period homes was highlighted in the recent
catastrophic fire at Windsor castle. Often premiums are too high for houses
to be covered for a total loss.
English Heritage and agencies responsible for royal palaces and other
national monuments, such as the Tower of London, simply cannot afford to
insure them at all. Money is spent instead on prevention and early-warning
systems.
Surprisingly, while claims blaze even higher, only 61.7 per cent of
Britain's 22m homes are insured against fire. There are signs of improvement
but, even so, claims leapt by more than 7 per cent last year to Pounds 249m.
Even some builders of new homes, desperate to maintain cash flow, are
offering houses for less than they cost to build. Historically, this
situation is a catalyst to a price explosion, but uncertainty over
employment continues to apply the brake.
Building costs vary from region to region and according to house type,
causing a wide difference in premiums. But the British Insurance Association
publishes an annual summary of building costs so, unless you live in a
mansion, do-it-yourself valuation is relatively simple.
Rebuilding costs bear no relation to market value although, fortunately,
total losses are rare. On an average home, the guide price per square foot
varies from as little as Pounds 41 to more than Pounds 70. To replace a
beautiful Georgian mansion, however, could cost closer to Pounds 500 a sq
ft.
To estimate your own rebuilding costs, simply work out the floor area, using
external measurements, and multiply by the number of floors. To complete the
equation, multiply the total area by the rebuilding cost for your area and
house type. Thus, a a moderate detached house of 2,000 sq ft in the home
counties would cost 2,000 x Pounds 46 to rebuild - or Pounds 92,000.
So, what price a Gertrude Jekyll garden or Capability Brown parkland?
'The garden comes virtually free if you take into account the value of the
bricks and mortar,' says Colin Mackenzie, of Hamptons. He was referring
specifically to Barton St Mary in East Grinstead, Sussex, built in 1906 and
having 20 acres that are little changed from the myopic Miss Jekyll's
original design. The price guide is Pounds 1m. Mackenzie says: 'To rebuild
the house would cost Pounds 2m or more, and that excludes the incalculable
value of the gardens.'
Heveningham Hall in Suffolk, featured on these pages a few months ago, is
still on the market. The price of Pounds 4.5m is trifling compared with the
Pounds 16m that Savills and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley estimate it would cost to
re-build. Again, the grounds - in this case, 469 acres sculpted by
Capability Brown - count for nought.
High above Bath is Widcombe manor, an exquisite Grade I Georgian house
sitting in seven acres of terraced gardens thought to be the work of Harold
Veto. Offers above Pounds 1.25m are sought by Savills with Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley.
Savills' man in Bath, Charlie Barkshire, says local building costs for a
standard house are around Pounds 60 a sq ft; but a house of the complexity
of Widcombe manor would cost at least Pounds 280 a sq ft to replace.
One of the most remarkable building works in progress this year is Bliss
mill, a huge Victorian tweed mill built in 1872. It might pass for a
Georgian-style mansion but for the dome and 165 ft tower that soars above
the finials and balustrades. Agent John D. Wood reckons that to build it
today would cost at least Pounds 15m.
The building dominates the rolling Oxfordshire countryside and is close to
Chipping Norton (Chipping being a corruption of the Saxon word 'cheapening,'
meaning market), the gateway to the Cotswolds.
Work on converting the mill and its outhouses to flats was started by an
American a few years ago and swallowed up more than Pounds 5m, much of that
due to the high standards set, but the company went into receivership. Enter
Andrew Davis, a flamboyant 27-year-old whose company, Widworthy Estates, has
now completed a number of successful developments.
'It was a very sad state of affairs,' Davis says. 'The previous owner had
lavished love and money on the old place but we were able to buy it for
below Pounds 2m.
'We have spent another Pounds 3m finishing the 35 flats, providing a
wonderful sports complex and converting the outhouses into cottages and
covered car parks. The buyers will get quality that is far and away beyond
what we could have built for the money had the previous owner not been so
ambitious.'
Prices of the flats and the delightful, bright cottages range between Pounds
125,000 and Pounds 245,000; annual service charges, which cover maintaining
the indoor pool, tennis court and other facilities, will average about
Pounds 1,750.
In Regent's Park, London, the third of an eventual six remarkable villas
designed by the champion of classicism, Quinlan Terry, is now ready for a
house-warming party. The Gothick Villa, as its final 'k' indicates, is not
architecturally pure; rather, a marriage of classic and Gothic style
reminiscent of Palladio's Villa Saraceno in Venice.
It is an extravagant place, with ogee arches, pinnacles, Corinthian
capitals, vaulting, and just about every other trick in the architect's
repertoire. But, as a home, it works much better than the first two, the
rooms encircling the grand entrance hall and staircase being of better
proportions. Savills, with Lassmans, has set a guide price of Pounds 6.75m.
Now, the crunch question. If you buy the Gothick Villa, for how much should
it be insured?
Strawberry Gothic, as it has been described, does not come cheap - at least
Pounds 300 a sq ft. Erring on the side of caution, you should reckon on
closer to Pounds 500 so, with nearly 8,000 squ ft to protect, the premiums
should cover re-building costs of at least Pounds 4m.
