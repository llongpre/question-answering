   The code that governs British treatment of royalty
is largely unwritten but always strict, and novelist A.N. Wilson
has violated one of the sternest rules of all.
   His sin has been to report a dinner-table chat with Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.
   That her remarks to Wilson were fairly innocuous, and that the
conversation took place nearly a decade ago, matters little. The
affair has provoked some sharp language from London society.
   ``Scoundrel!'' thundered Lord Wyatt of Weeford.
   ``An intolerable betrayal!'' echoed Nicholas Soames, member of
Parliament and scion of the Churchill family.
   Wilson, 39, is a gifted novelist and acute social commentator
who clearly knew he was courting trouble when he published ``The
Queen Mother's table-talk'' in the weekly Spectator magazine two
weeks ago.
   ``It is probably the grossest impropriety to embarrass her, or
her host, by repeating our conversation,'' he wrote.
   ``I do so, however, without very much compunction, since she
never gives `interviews,' and I can think of no better person than
Queen Elizabeth with whom to start off an occasional series of
conversations with men and women who have lived through most of the
years of this century ... and whose memories stretch back far.''
   In the conversation, reproduced in dialogue form, the mother of
Queen Elizabeth II and widow of King George VI was said to have
revealed a fondness for detective stories, and a problem with her
cash flow: ``Had such an awful afternoon today with my bank
manager, scolding me about my overdraft.''
   After a few remarks about politics came this gem of an account
of a poetry evening at Windsor Castle during World War II, at which
T.S. Eliot recited ``The Waste Land.''
   Elizabeth: ``We had this rather lugubrious man in a suit, and he
read a poem. ... I think it was called `The Desert.' And first the
girls got the giggles, and then I did and then even the King.''
   Wilson: ```The Desert,' ma'am? Are you sure it wasn't called
`The Waste Land?'''
   Elizabeth: ``That's it. I'm afraid we all giggled. Such a gloomy
man, looked as though he worked in a bank, and we didn't understand
a word.''
   Wilson: ``I believe he DID once work in a bank.''
   The article, published in the midst of national celebrations of
the queen mother's 90th birthday, was thoughtful and affectionate.
   But Lord Wyatt, himself a former journalist, was scandalized,
especially since it was he who was host of the dinner.
   ``Wilson is boastfully shameless in being a scoundrel,'' he
wrote in a letter to the Spectator published a week later. It was,
he charged, a ``deceitfully obtained and stolen `interview.'''
   Soames, in a letter to the magazine, called it ``an appalling
want of chivalry'' and ``an absolutely fundamental breach of
trust.''
   Buckingham Palace, which speaks for the queen mother, declined
to comment. But Wilson, who prefers initials to his first name,
Andrew, reacted in this week's Spectator to what he called an
``absurd taboo.''
   ``Why all the fuss?'' he asked. ``The Queen Mother is about to
be 90 years old. The newspapers are full of 16-page, full-color
supplements all, roughly speaking, conveying the message, `Gawd
bless yer, Ma'am.' None of the articles I have read have conveyed
what it is like to meet her, or what she says.''
   Commenting in The Independent on Sunday, columnist Francis Wheen
said Wyatt was cutting ``a comical figure.'' He noted that the
lord's own autobiography contained gossipy tidbits from his private
conversations with famous people.
   Wyatt warned that the affair would strengthen those who want to
impose stricter privacy laws on the media.
   Wheen wrote that Wyatt himself is a columnist, for the tabloid
News of the World, ``and although that newspaper has many
qualities, respect for privacy is not, I think, one of them.''
   Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd argued in The Daily Telegraph that
writers were always scribbling down conversations with the high and
mighty, hoping to publish them one day.
   ``This may be an ungentlemanly instinct,'' he wrote. But ``you
have to decide whether to be a gent or a scribbler and I, for one,
am prepared to defend A. N. Wilson for choosing the latter course.''
