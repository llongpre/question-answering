A collection of 97 lots of French furniture and works of art, assembled over
30 years by the French couturier Hubert de Givenchy, sold for FFr155.5m
(Pounds 17.67m) at Christie's in Monaco at the weekend This was far in
excess of the FFr100m estimate, and set a record for a single owner auction
of furniture.
The highlight was a 52kg silver chandelier made in 1736 by German goldsmith
Behrens to a William Kent design for King George II's palace in Hanover. It
was bought by the Middle Eastern collector, Al Tajir for FFr19.98m, an
auction record for any item of silver.
The chandelier is one of five which once hung in the Queen's Drawing Room
and Ballroom at Windsor Castle.
The other exceptional price was the FFr18.87m paid for a bureau plat (table)
by the celebrated 17th century furniture-maker Boulle. The bureau plat is
made of ebony, brass and ormolu, and set a record for a Boulle item. It was
the second highest price ever paid for French furniture at auction. In all,
78 lots found buyers.
The furniture had been displayed in Mr de Givenchy's Paris house in the
heart of the fashionable Fauborg St Germain. Now 66 he has moved to a
smaller home. The sale covered a selection of what remains one of the finest
antique collections in France.
