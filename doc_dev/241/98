THE TAKING OF snuff reached its height in Europe during the 18th Century, when 
it was a habit almost universally enjoyed, particularly in elegant and 
sophisticated circles. Some indication of its popularity can be seen from the 
many delightful snuff boxes available to the collector today.

Snuff got started in the Western world with the North American Indians, and its 
introduction to Europe was attributed to the 16th-Century French ambassador to 
Portugal, Jean Nicot. Its use quickly spread from one country to another, 
reaching England by way of Ireland and Scotland. Indeed, the carved and painted 
figure of a costumed Highlander in the act of taking snuff was once the common 
sign outside a snuff-seller's shop.

By the 18th Century the habit was an important part of daily life, and snuff 
was found everywhere. The ordinary man carried the powder in boxes made of 
horn, copper or brass, wood, tortoise-shell, papier-mache and enameled copper. 
The aristocracy, on the other hand, had far more elaborate containers: 
gem-encrusted gold boxes, silver, ivory or anything equally exotic. The snuff 
box became an article of men's jewelry, and it was said of a certain Lord 
Petersham that he owned so many of them that he was able to select a different 
one for each day of the year, and for his changing moods as well.

The most extravagant boxes were undoubtedly those made by the French during the 
eras of Louis XV and Louis XVI. The Paris goldsmiths used colored gold, enamels 
and precious stones in which some of the costliest designs are reminiscent of 
feminine jewelry of the day. Often, boxes were decorated with miniature 
portraits, and some were furnished with false lids concealing erotic subjects.

Snuff boxes come in all shapes and sizes. Generally, lids were decorated, often 
painted, and sometimes inset with representations of famous castles ("castle 
tops" regularly showed views of Windsor Castle). Some have compartments for 
different grades of snuff, and others have watches built into them. Examples 
from present-day auctions range from a Scottish silver-mounted cowrie-shell 
box, c. 1810 ($175), to a Victorian castle scene, 1838, by Nathaniel Mills 
($700), or a George III silver-gilt fox-mask box, c. 1807 ($4,320).

By the 19th Century it had become traditional for monarchs to present snuff 
boxes as marks of honor to distinguished foreign visitors, and the custom 
continued long after snuff ceased to be popular. Today a collection of such 
boxes adds a charming accent to the top of some 18th-Century or contemporary 
table.
