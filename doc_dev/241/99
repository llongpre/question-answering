   Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, prayed
with ordinary people in church then played with Hollywood
celebrities at a black-tie dinner, where the duchess joked with a
male admirer in the audience.
   The Duke and Duchess of York ended a diverse day of activities
Sunday with the star-studded dinner organized by industrialist
Armand Hammer and Arco Petroleum chief Lodwrick Cooke.
   Among the 700 guests paying $1,000 apiece to dine with British
royalty at the Biltmore Hotel were Zsa Zsa Gabor, her husband
Prince Frederick von Anhalt, ``Dynasty'' star Joan Collins, her
date George Hamilton, Burt Bacharach and his wife, Carole Bayer
Sager, actor Michael York and astronaut Buzz Aldrin.
   British actor Roger Moore, the master of ceremonies, joked about
the nature of the royals' trip, quipping that the highlight was
today's visit to a supermarket.
   ``I couldn't help but notice the royal couple will be there on
double coupon day. And just in case you want to do a little
shopping, this one's for disposal diapers,'' Moore said, holding up
a coupon for the couple, whose first child is due this year.
   Their fourth day in Southern California was to start today with
a visit to two British exhibits at the California Museum of Science
and Industry. In the afternoon, attention focuses on promoting
British trade.
   They were to tour the Bullocks Wilshire clothing department
store and visits a Vons supermarket in Arcadia.
   For Sunday night's black-tie event, the duchess arrived in a
strapless black evening gown with a shimmery, puffy orange wrap
draped around her shoulders.
   Allowed to give a few remarks after two lengthy introductions
and a short speech by her husband, Sarah drew applause and some
cheers when she said: ``At last I have a turn to talk _ all these
men.''
   A man from the audience shouted, ``I love you.''
   ``I'll see you later,'' she quipped to more applause and cheers.
   Andrew had gotten in his dig a moment earlier when he
acknowledged Hammer's remark that the couple ``could fly duets'' as
they are both licensed pilots.
   ``You mentioned being able to fly duets,'' the prince said. ``It
is a little bit difficult because we would be fighting for the
controls of the plane.''
   Money raised by the dinner benefits the three-month UK-LA '88
art festival and a fund to salvage books damaged in disastrous 1986
fires at the Los Angeles Central Library. The guests dined on
crepinette of salmon and white fish, with champagne chervil.
   On behalf of the British library board, Andrew brought a gift,
the book Wonders of Creation. Sarah presented the couple's personal
gift, two volumes of the book, ``Royal Heritage,'' bound at Windsor
Castle.
   On Sunday, the day began on a more common note. The couple
attended services at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Long Beach.
   About 300 people lined the sidewalk across from the church to
see the couple.
   ``We love them, we really do,'' said 48-year-old Myrna Dillon,
perched on a stepladder to ctach a glimpse. ``We follow their every
move.''
   Unknown to the royal retinue, officers sweeping the motorcade
route detained a man carrying a .22-caliber rifle.
   John Kasser, 30, of Long Beach, had retrieved the unloaded rifle
from the police station and was headed to his car when Los Angeles
city police officers spotted him, said Long Beach Lt. Rod
Mickelson. The gun had been held for safekeeping for several days
after officers confiscated it during a domestic dispute, Mickelson
said.
   Kasser was later freed and allowed to keep his gun, police said.
   ``There's absolutely no relation between him and the
motorcade,'' Mickelson said.
