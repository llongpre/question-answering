   Ricky Van Shelton, a former pipefitter
who has been recording country music less than two years, is the
leading finalist for fan-voted awards sponsored by cable TV's The
Nashville Network.
   Shelton is a finalist for five of the eight annual Viewers'
Choice awards to be presented by TNN.
   He was voted one of six finalists in every eligible category:
favorite entertainer; favorite male vocalist; favorite album;
favorite song and favorite music video.
   The song and video are ``I'll Leave This World Loving You,'' a
No. 1 hit in November. The album, which has received gold status for
selling 500,000 copies, is ``Loving You.''
   Shelton, 37, whose trademark is a white cowboy hat, is one of
country music's rising stars. Four years ago, he left Grit, Va.,
where he had worked as a pipefitter for 10 years. Settling in
Nashville, he signed a recording contract with CBS Records just two
years ago.
   ``I feel wonderful,'' Shelton said after the finalists were
announced Monday during a live telecast on teh cable network. ``I
had no idea this would happen. I just want to keep putting out good
songs, selling records and get my farm paid for.''
   George Strait and Dwight Yoakam are finalists in four categories
apiece. Winners, to be chosen by TNN viewers, will be announced
during a live show April 25 at the Grand Ole Opry House.

Ain't Lovin' '' by Strait; ``Loving Proof'' by Shelton; ``Old 8 x
