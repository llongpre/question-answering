   It was a sentimental moment for country's
top entertainer Hank Williams Jr., the rowdy Southerner notorious
for wild party songs, when he upstaged Alabama's artist of the
decade proclamation.
   It appeared to be Alabama's night early during Monday night's
24th annual Academy of Country Music Awards presentations as the
country rockers joined Marty Robbins and Loretta Lynn in the
prestigious artist-of-the-decade ranks.
   The band has won 13 ACM trophies since 1982, and has had 21
consecutive No. 1 singles, including ``Feels So Right,'' ``The
Closer You Get,'' ``Roll On'' and ``You've Got the Touch.''
   But the evening was stolen by Williams, who beat Alabama again
for his third consecutive entertainer of the year award, when he
accepted his trophy before the crowd of 1,600.
   ``I didn't think I was going to get the first one,'' said
Williams, son of the legendary singer-songwriter who died in 1953.
``I'm a late bloomer, a survivor, a fighter, a contender.
   ``I can be a champion, but I'm nothing without all of you in
this room and all the fans out there.''
   While on stage, Williams referred to his current hit record and
video, the much-talked about father-son duet ``Tear in My Beer''
using an old demo tape his father made decades ago. He earlier
performed the song, which featured a stirring video interplay with
his late father.
   ``The video with daddy was the most special thing I ever did in
my life,'' Williams said, choking back tears and biting his lip in
a bid for composure.
   The two-hour, Dick Clark-produced NBC special fared well in the
ratings, winning the time slot and luring a larger national
audience than last month's Grammy Awards.
   If there was a surprise, it was Randy Travis leaving the show
empty-handed, despite three nominations. He's won eight ACM
trophies since 1986 and earlier this year won an American Music
Awards and a Grammy Award.
   K.T. Oslin and Kathy Mattea each won two awards, Miss Oslin for
album of the year and best female vocalist and Miss Mattea's
``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses'' for year's best record and
song. George Strait won in the male vocalist category.
   The Los Angeles-based band Highway 101 won its second
consecutive vocal group trophy, and the mother-daughter singing duo
The Judds, Naomi and Wynonna, took a fifth consecutive duet award.
   Suzy Bogguss was named top new female vocalist, while Rodney
Crowell, whose wife is country singer Rosanne Cash, was named the
top new male vocalist. The lifetime achievement Pioneer Award was
given to Buck Owens.
