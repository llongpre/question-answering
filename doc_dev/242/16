   Now that the networks have announced their fall
schedules, let the trend-noting begin.
   Even though Nielsen figures show viewers are becoming
increasingly disenchanted with network television, the networks
seem to think what audiences want to watch on TV is TV. Four
comedies slated for next season are set in the wacky world of
television:
   _``TV101'' on CBS, from GTG Entertainment, Grant Tinker's new
production company, is about a journalism teacher (Sam Robards) who
returns to his high school alma mater to teach the kids about TV
reportage.
   _``Studio 5B'' on ABC is set in the morning news show milieu,
the title a reference to Studio 3B from which NBC's ``Today'' show
originates.
   _``Murphy Brown'' on CBS stars Candice Bergen as a barely
coping, high-profile TV news personality recently released from the
Betty Ford Clinic.
   _``A Fine Romance'' on ABC features Anthony Andrews and Margaret
Whitton as a divorced couple who continue as co-hosts of a
television show.
   Gone are ``dramedies'' for the most part. ABC canceled ``The
`Slap' Maxwell Story,'' and NBC is expected to drop ``The Days and
Nights of Molly Dodd'' after its current run. But CBS is holding
onto ``Frank's Place,'' perhaps the best new show last season, as a
midseason returnee. ``Hooperman'' on ABC was the only real success
of the four that premiered last fall.
   Gone is ``St. Elsewhere,'' itself a trend marking the end of an
era.
   Back are old standbys and tried-and-true troupers. Mary Tyler
Moore is back on CBS in a new comedy, as is her one-time co-star
Dick Van Dyke in a separate show. Peter Falk returns as ``Columbo''
on ABC in a rotating series that also features Burt Reynolds as a
private eye.
   There will be more so-called ``tabloid TV.'' NBC makes a regular
series out of its popular ``Unsolved Mysteries'' specials. ABC
offers ``Incredible Sunday,'' a remake of ``That's Incredible.''
   There are two movie spinoffs: NBC's ``Baby Boom'' casts Kate
Jackson (``Scarecrow and Mrs. King'') in the role Diane Keaton
created in the movie of the same name about a high-powered
executive who inherits an infant. CBS has Patrick Cassidy and
Melora Hardin playing the Patrick Swayze-Jennifer Grey roles in
``Dirty Dancing.''
   History offers no encouragement for these two. The last time a
movie spinoff was a big hit was ``Alice,'' the long-running sitcom
based on the movie ``Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.'' ``Starman''
premiered in 1986, but only lasted a season. This season's
``Supercarrier,'' a thinly veiled version of the hit movie ``Top
Gun,'' soon sank.
   There are a more families next season, but the ``The Cosby
Show'' won't have to worry about competition from other typical,
nuclear families in the neighborhood. TV likes one-parent
households.
   This season, moms fared poorly:
   _``Full House,'' mother dead;
   _``My Two Dads,'' mother dead;
   _``Valerie's Family,'' mother dead;
   _``I Married Dora,'' mother dead.
   Next season's families are missing moms and dads through
combinations of death and divorce and selfishness.
   _``Baby Boom,'' mother single;
   _Mary Tyler Moore's show, mother divorced;
   _``Close to Home,'' mother off finding self;
   _``Dear John,'' husband divorced;
   _``Empty Nest,'' mother dead;
   _``The Robert Guillaume Show,'' father divorced;
   _``Paradise,'' children inherited, sister dead.
   NBC, which was accused by some critics of playing it safe with
its fall schedule, seems to have created two new categories:
   _``Tattinger's'' establishes the
romance-comedy-drama-set-in-popular-New York-restaurant genre; and
   _``Midnight Caller'' creates an
ex-cop-turned-late-night-radio-talk-show-host formula.
   It isn't hard to predict the hits among the new shows _ just
look at what NBC put in its Thursday and Saturday lineups: ``Dear
John'' starring Judd Hirsch follows ``Cheers'' on Thursday; ``Empty
Nest'' with Richard Mulligan is spun off and follows ``Golden
Girls'' on Saturday.
   And ABC is giving ``Rosanne,'' a sitcom starring the
wisecracking comic Roseanne Barr, a space in its successful Tuesday
night lineup.

   Elsewhere in television:
   EMMY NIGHT LIVE _ Lorne Michaels, executive producer of NBC's
``Saturday Night Live,'' has signed to produce the 40th Annual Emmy
Awards on Fox. The celebration of television excellence airs live
Aug. 28, for the second year on the fledgling network. Fox hopes
Michaels will infuse the overlong, often leaden event with some
wit. Michaels himself has won six Emmies. ...
   STARS' FAVORITE SOAPS _ Bette Davis loves ``As the World Turns''
and ``Guiding Light,'' Sammy Davis watches ``Ryan's Hope'' and
``General Hospital'' every day, Carol Burnett made an appearance on
her favorite daytime drama, ``All My Children,'' and Aretha
Franklin adores ``The Young and the Restless.'' These soap-lovers'
confessions are contained in the June 28 issue of Soap Opera
Digest, which goes on to reveal that Crystal Gayle watches
``Another World'' along with the guys in her band and that Nancy
Culp, who played Miss Hathaway on ``The Beverly Hillbillies,'' is a
``Santa Barbara'' addict.
