   Southern rockers Alabama got the artist
of the decade award from the Academy of Country Music, but it was
1989's top entertainer Hank Williams Jr. who provided the show's
wallop.
   Williams was one of three double winners, taking his third
consecutive entertainer of the year trophy and second video award
during Monday night's 24th-annual presentations.
   K.T. Oslin won album of the year and best female vocalist and
Kathy Mattea's ``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses'' won for record
and song.
   Randy Travis was shut out despite three nominations.
   It appeared to be Alabama's night as the band joined Marty
Robbins and Loretta Lynn in the artist of the decade ranks.
   But Williams, the wild-eyed Tennessean whose rowdiness has been
embraced by country music in recent years, brought a tear to many
of the 1,600 people present when he accepted his trophy.
   ``I'm a late bloomer, a survivor, a fighter, a contender,''
Williams said. ``I can be a champion, but I'm nothing without all
of you in this room and all the fans out there.''
   Williams then referred to his current hit record and video, the
father-son duet ``Tear in My Beer,'' which uses a tape his late
father made decades ago.
   ``The video with Daddy was the most special thing I ever did in
my life,'' Williams said, choking back tears and biting his lip.
   Backstage, he conceded it was as emotional for him as the
audience.
   ``When I started talking about that video I had to get off that
stage because the man of steel just about lost it,'' he said.
   The presentations broadcast on NBC-TV also brought a videotaped
salute from President Bush, who said ``howdy'' and told the artists
he had a ``deep appreciation for country and western music, and the
values you represent.''
   The big surprise was Travis' leaving empty handed. He's won
eight ACM trophies since 1986 and this year has won American Music
Awards and a Grammy Award.
   The crowd inside Walt Disney Studios gave a standing ovation to
Alabama members Randy Owen, Jeff Cook, Teddy Gentry and Mark
Herndon.
   ``I'd like to accept this award for all those artists that have
deserved awards but never won awards,'' said Owen.
   Alabama has won 13 Country Music Awards since 1982. It has had
21 consecutive No. 1 singles, including ``Feels So Right,'' ``The
Closer You Get,'' ``Roll On'' and ``You've Got the Touch.''
   Cowpoke balladeer Robbins prevailed in the 1960s and coal
miner's daughter Miss Lynn was crowned the decade's best in the
1970s.
   Miss Oslin, the robust queen of down-home music known for her
irreverence, thanked ``the fans, the radio that played me and me.''
   Strait won his third male vocalist trophy, the last time in 1986
when he also won album of the year.
   ``This means a lot to me. My little boy has been asking me,
`Dad, when are you going to win another award?' Well, we got one
tonight Bubba,'' Strait said, referring to 7-year-old George Jr.
   Los Angeles-based Highway 101 beat out Alabama, the Desert Rose
Band, the Oak Ridge Boys and Restless Heart to take their second
consecutive vocal group trophy.
   The Judds, Naomi and her daughter Wynona, took their fifth
consecutive duet award.
   Suzy Bogguss was named top new female vocalist and Rodney
Crowell, whose wife is country singer Rosanne Cash, was named the
top new male vocalist.
   Buck Owens, the academy's top male vocalist in 1966, was
presented the non-competitive Pioneer Award for outstanding
achievement.
   In awards announced earlier, the Desert Rose Band won the
academy's top touring band trophy.
   Winners in the instrumental categories were Curtis Stone, bass;
Steve Duncan, drums; Mark O'Connor, fiddle; Al Bruno, guitar; John
Hobbs, keyboard; Charlie McCoy, specialty instrument (harmonica);
Jay Dee Maness, steel guitar; and Nashville Now, non-touring band.
   Nashville radio station WSIX was voted the nation's best in
country music and southern California's Crazy Horse Steak House &amp;
Saloon was named top nightclub.
   There was a tie for disc jockey of the year between Jon Conlon
of WGKX in Memphis, Tenn., and Dandalion of WRKZ in Hershey, Pa.
Dandalion is the first woman to win the honor.
   The winners were decided in a vote by the 2,000-member academy.
