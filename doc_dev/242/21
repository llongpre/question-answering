   Kathy Mattea has gone from being a
Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum tour guide to having three
nominations for the 22nd annual Country Music Association Awards.
   ``You can knock me over with a feather,'' she said. ``This is
amazing.''
   In nominations announced Thursday, Ms. Mattea found out she is a
finalist for single of the year for ``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen
Roses'' and album of the year for ``Untasted Honey,'' besides No. 1
female vocalist.
   Grammy winners K.T. Oslin and Randy Travis each garnered
nominations in four categories, including top vocalist, the
association announced.
   Some of the biggest stars in country music _ Willie Nelson,
Kenny Rogers, Barbara Mandrell, the Oak Ridge Boys, Loretta Lynn
and Ricky Skaggs _ were not among the finalists. And the band
Alabama, which has dominated country music awards this decade, is a
finalist in one category _ vocal group of the year.
   Oslin, who's been singing country music less than two years, was
voted a finalist for top female vocalist, single of the year for
``Do Ya'' and Horizon Award for a rising star. She also received
two nominations in the song of the year category as composer of the
Grammy-winning ``80's Ladies'' and ``Do Ya.''
   Travis, a former short-order cook and dishwasher, is a finalist
for entertainer of the year, male vocalist of the year and single
and song of the year, both for his self-penned ``I Told You So.''
He won a Grammy in February for ``Always and Forever.''
   Completing the finalists for entertainer of the year, the top
award, are the Judds, 1986 winner Reba McEntire, George Strait and
1987 winner Hank Williams Jr.
   Joining Ms. Mattea, Ms. McEntire, Ms. Oslin as finalists for
female vocalist of the year are Roseanne Cash and Tanya Tucker.
   Other finalists for top male vocalist are veteran Vern Gosdin,
fast-rising Ricky Van Shelton, Strait and Williams.
   Winners will be announced during a two-hour CBS television
special Oct. 10 with Dolly Parton.
   Ms. McEntire, a former rodeo barrel racer, has been voted No. 1
female vocalist for an unprecedented four straight years.
   Travis was voted male vocalist of the year last year and won top
album for ``Always and Forever'' and No. 1 single for ``Forever and
Ever.''
   The Judds, a mother-daughter duo, have won the vocal group of
the year award three straight times and are a finalist again this
year. Others are the Bellamy Brothers, Foster &amp; Lloyd, the O'Kanes
and Sweethearts of the Rodeo.
   Ms. Cash, daughter of country music star Johnny Cash, is also
nominated for single of the year for ``Tennessee Flat Top Box,'' a
song written about 30 years ago by her father.
   Her third nomination is with husband Rodney Crowell for vocal
event of the year. This is a new category for two or more
performers who do not normally sing together. They recorded the
recent hit duet, ``It's Such a Small World.''
   Winners and finalists are picked by the approximately 7,000
singers, songwriters, musicians, disc jockeys and others in country
music.
