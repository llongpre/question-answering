Dana Carvey, who makes his film debut in "Opportunity Knocks," is being 
interviewed as a movie star, not as a member of the comic ensemble of "Saturday 
Night Live." But old habits are hard to break. You ask him if he plans to leave 
the venerable late-night show in pursuit of a Hollywood career, and suddenly 
George Bush is answering. 
</P>
<P>
"Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent." 
</P>
<P>
And how does he feel audiences will react to his character in "Opportunity 
Knocks"? The voice that answers belongs to Garth, Carvey's "nerdy surfer dude 
and loyal sidekick" in the new SNL segment, "Wayne's World." 
</P>
<P>
"Excellent! He shoots! He scores!" says Carvey/Garth. 
</P>
<P>
Between unprompted mini-skits, the impish-looking Carvey will tell you that he 
is, in fact, marveling at his success. "When I first started out, I just copied 
Dan Aykroyd's imitation of (Jimmy) Carter in my stand-up, and now -- 13 years 
later -- to be the guy doing Bush is cool," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Carvey jumps up suddenly to show off an official-looking piece of stationery 
that is engraved simply: "The President." The message reads: "John, Have now 
seen both 'Saturday Night Live' tapes. The guy is improving on his 
entertainment 'thing.' GB" 
</P>
<P>
It's a note, he explains, from the president to his nephew that somehow made 
its way into Carvey's hands. 
</P>
<P>
The boy next door re-surfaces: "That's kinda neat, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
It seems a lot of people think Carvey is pretty neat, too. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone at his Encino home never seems to stop ringing, with requests for 
his zany presence on such shows as "Today," where he made an appearance 
Tuesday, and "The Tonight Show," where he showed up Thursday. But it wasn't 
always this way for the "Saturday Night Live" star. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just dismissed a lot,' Carvey said. "I looked so innocent and boyish 
that no one thought of casting me as a comedian." He slips into a Hollywood 
agent-type patter: "A big belly is funny. Bald is funny. An overbite is funny. 
Big ears are funny. Short is funny. Too tall is funny. You are not funny!" 
</P>
<P>
He attributes being miscast as a naive, straight man in several television 
pilots and series to "looking like Huck Finn." 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to Hollywood I was 25, but I looked like a fetus with tennis 
shoes," Carvey explains. 
</P>
<P>
In the years since then no wrinkles or gray hairs appear to have set in, but 
Carvey is no longer being offered the innocent, boy-next-door roles. After 
playing a colorless character in the short-lived TV series, "One of the Boys," 
with Mickey Rooney, a mime waiter in the rock movie spoof, "This is Spinal 
Tap," and being edited out of the Sean Penn movie "Racing With the Moon," 
Carvey is ready for some recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Known best for his quirky "Saturday Night Live" characters -- the priggish 
Church Lady and the arrogant Teutonic bodybuilder Hans, Carvey has just 
embarked on the same crossover journey undertaken by a host of SNL comedians 
before him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's entry-level movie stardom," Carvey says. 
</P>
<P>
His starring vehicle is a fairly ambitious role. In "Opportunity Knocks," which 
opened Friday, Carvey plays likeable con man Eddie Farrell, a two-bit hood from 
the south side of Chicago. Farrell pulls off the ultimate "con" by convincing a 
wealthy Chicago family that he really is a Harvard-educated whiz kid/wine 
connoisseur/ladies' man and wooing the family's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The role is that of a leading man, but Carvey does dot the dramatic landscape 
with some familiar SNL signs, doing an impersonation of George Bush, a stint as 
a wildman rocker, and a host of ethnic accents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he pulled it off with great panache, actually," said the film's 
director Donald Petrie. "He's also a good actor as well as a funny man." 
</P>
<P>
Said Carvey's co-star actor Robert Loggia: "I think he's going to have a 
helluva career. He's likeable and I think that's something that can't be 
manufactured. You look in those baby blue eyes and see that pixie smile and you 
say 'This guy is all right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the "Saturday Night Live" star exudes likability from the moment he 
invites a reporter into his home, extending a steaming mug of tea. While 
thoughtfully mulling over his career choices, he slips into accents and 
impersonations as easily as someone might slip on a sweater. Take "Bat 
Rainman," for instance: "Yeah, gotta get the Joker. 'Course I'm an excellent 
Caped Crusader. Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike SNL predecessors Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, who have ventured into 
dramatic roles, Carvey wants to concentrate on what he does best: comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"My main thing is I just wanna be funny," Carvey said. "I'll leave it to De 
Niro and Meryl Streep to hug blocks of ice, play dead, or wake up on the 
kitchen floor drenched in sweat in the fetal position, screaming 'I am not an 
animal!' " 
</P>
<P>
"I thought at 34 and after three years on 'Saturday Night Live' I really wanted 
to try to do a first movie," he said. "It was a better script than most scripts 
I've read and I wanted to do something more as myself for the first movie." 
</P>
<P>
He has no illusions that this is his "Citizen Kane." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a film that's going to hold up well under intense scrutiny," he said. 
"I mean, film students probably shouldn't write papers about it. It's a light 
romantic comedy." 
</P>
<P>
Carvey says his next role -- in the film "Beverly Hills Ninja" set to start 
filming in June -- will be light years away from this movie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's avant-garde, new-wave comedy" in the style of Peter Sellers, Carvey said. 
</P>
<P>
Carvey has also gotten offers for a film starring his Church Lady character, 
but dismisses those as "a short career. That's 15 minutes of fame for sure." 
</P>
<P>
But, don't get him wrong. That self-righteous Satan basher will still be around 
on "Saturday Night Live" episodes to excoriate celebrities and prattle on about 
the insidious "Prince of Darkness." 
</P>
<P>
"I like the character, I'm very proud of it," Carvey said. "It was kind of 
satisfying because a lot of comedians had done either a priest or an evangelist 
. . . but no one had done those women behind the punch bowl: those women in 
orthopedic shoes, very androgynous, short hair, asexual, very judgmental." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Carvey says he plans to stay on "Saturday Night Live" for as long as 
they'll have him, or at least for another season, when his five-year contract 
runs out. 
</P>
<P>
"After struggling 10 years as a stand-up, to get on "Saturday Night Live" . . . 
I never just wanted to do 10 shows, get a hit character and bounce out of 
there," Carvey says. "You look back on people that have done three, four, five 
seasons there and they have a legacy that they can be proud of. . . . I feel 
like I would just love to be connected to that whole legacy. And hopefully next 
year will be my best year." 
</P>
<P>
So, where does he see himself in another 10 years? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, probably on Hollywood Boulevard in a tattered dress holding my hand out 
saying (in a quavering voice) 'Isn't that special?' Hoping for a quarter, a 
dime or a nickel. People would say: 'Who's that?' 'Oh, he used to be the Church 
Lady.' "
