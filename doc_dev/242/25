   Rodney Crowell may be this year's newcomer
to mainstream country music. But behind the success of his Diamonds
&amp; Dirt album is a solid career that's touched nearly every facet of
the music industry.
   Crowell's older fans, his ``cult following,'' as he puts it, kept
his wide-ranging talents a secret until recently.
   He's written hits for big-name artists. He produced the brilliant
King's Record Shop LP for his wife, Rosanne Cash, and he helped make
a legend out of Emmylou Harris as a member of her Hot Band in the
1970s.
   But 1989 was his year.
   Diamonds &amp; Dirt, Crowell's fifth album, has produced four No. 1
singles on the country charts _ the first time four top singles have
been written, produced and performed by the same artist. The album
also earned him three Grammy Awards, and the Academy of Country
Music named him its top new male vocalist. It was an honor the
38-year-old performer might have scoffed at had he not won.
   ``It's funny how you can justify either side of the coin,''
Crowell said. ``If you don't win, you say, `I'm an artist, awards
don't mean anything.' Then, suddenly you win, and the hypocrite
comes out and says, `Hey, this is not bad.'''
   Last month, Warner Records released The Rodney Crowell
Collection, his first ``greatest hits'' album. Crowell's new LP for
CBS Records is due in October.
   He recently talked about his new popularity and his ``arrival''
after years in the background.
   Not long ago, he watched his wife's career take off while his own
talents were tucked away in the production booth.
   ``I got sidetracked in the role of producer a few years back, and
I got involved to the point where I couldn't give any attention to
my own personal desires,'' he said. ``And while doing that, Rosanne
was having a great deal of success. It was really tough. The bottom
line was that she was doing better than me.''
   Crowell doesn't like to hear labels pinned on his music, though
he acknowledges that country music radio is his ``window to the
world.''
   His disdain for categories started when he was a child in Austin,
Texas, he said.
   ``The '60s was a good time musically because I would go to the
store and buy a Beatles record, a Merle Haggard record, a Buck Owens
record and a Flatt and Scruggs record _ all on the same rack. They
didn't separate them. I'd buy them at the grocery store.
   ``That's why I bristle when somebody pegs it all down, because I
would easily go from country to something classical _ Ravel _ to the
Rolling Stones. Music is something to be appreciated for how it
feels, how it speaks to your heart, not your mind.''
   Crowell hooked up with Emmylou Harris in 1974, after she recorded
some of his songs and sent out word she wanted to meet the young
songwriter. He visited her at her home in the Washington, D.C., area
and later followed her to Los Angeles.
   ``She came through Austin, where I was hanging out at the time,
handed me an airline ticket and said, `C'mon, move to L.A.,' and I
said, `OK.'''
   Before long, Crowell was tagged ``the next Gram Parsons,'' a
reference to the man considered one of the founders of country rock.
Parsons, who discovered Harris and later recorded with her, died in
1972 of a heroin overdose.
   ``I didn't know Gram Parsons,'' Crowell said. ``I suppose that
comparison is only natural given the fact that Emmylou was his
collaborator, then he died, and I became her collaborator.''
   The Hot Band proved a strong foundation for Crowell's first album
in 1978, ``Ain't Livin' Long Like This,'' which featured Ry Cooder,
Dr. John, Ricky Skaggs and James Burton. Like the albums that
followed, it received strong critical acclaim but had little
commercial success.
   At the time, Cash was an aspiring actress also living in Los
Angeles. But the two met by chance in Nashville, Tenn., where they
both happened to be visiting.
   ``I found out she lived in L.A. We became friends and that turned
into a romance,'' Crowell said.
   When she left acting for a singing career, Cash asked Crowell to
produce her first album. He has since produced all of Cash's albums.
   In the past few years, the couple have weathered well-publicized
drug and marital problems. They now live in Nashville with their
four children, and the hard times and jealousy seem to be things of
the past.
   If anything, Cash's success seems to be more of an inspiration
than a threat to Crowell.
   ``That's one thing about Rosanne; she's a real seeker _ of any
kind of growth: emotional, artistic, intellectual. She is very
creative and is not complacent.''
