Dana Carvey, who makes his film debut in "Opportunity Knocks," is being 
interviewed as a movie star, not as a member of the comic ensemble of "Saturday 
Night Live." But old habits are hard to break. You ask him if he plans to leave 
the venerable late-night show in pursuit of Hollywood, and suddenly George Bush 
is answering. 
</P>
<P>
"Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent." 
</P>
<P>
And how does he feel audiences will react to his character in "Opportunity 
Knocks"? The voice that answers belongs to Garth, Carvey's "nerdy surfer dude 
and loyal sidekick" in the new SNL segment, "Wayne's World." 
</P>
<P>
"Excellent! He shoots! He scores!" says Carvey/Garth. 
</P>
<P>
Between unprompted mini-skits, the impish-looking Carvey will tell you that he 
is, in fact, marveling at his success. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone at his Encino home never seems to stop ringing, with requests for 
his zany presence on such shows as "Today," where he made an appearance 
Tuesday, and "The Tonight Show," where he showed up Thursday. But, it wasn't 
always this way for the "Saturday Night Live" star. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just dismissed a lot,' Carvey said. "I looked so innocent and boyish 
that no one thought of casting me as a comedian." 
</P>
<P>
In the years since then, no wrinkles or gray hairs appear to have set in, but 
Carvey is no longer being offered the innocent, boy-next-door roles. After 
playing a colorless character in the short-lived TV series, "One of the Boys," 
with Mickey Rooney, a mime waiter in the rock movie spoof, "This is Spinal 
Tap," and being edited out of the Sean Penn movie "Racing Against the Moon," 
Carvey is ready for some recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Known best for his quirky SNL characters -- the priggish Church Lady and the 
arrogant Teutonic bodybuilder Hans, Carvey has embarked on the same crossover 
journey undertaken by a host of SNL comedians before him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's entry-level movie stardom," Carvey says. 
</P>
<P>
His starring vehicle is a fairly ambitious role. In "Opportunity Knocks," which 
opens today, Carvey plays likable con man Eddie Farrell, a two-bit hood from 
the south side of Chicago. Farrell pulls off the ultimate "con" by convincing a 
wealthy Chicago family that he really is a Harvard-educated whiz kid and wooing 
the family's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike SNL predecessors Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, who have ventured into 
dramatic roles, Carvey wants to concentrate on what he does best: comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Carvey said he plans to stay on SNL for as long as it'll have him, or at least 
for another season, when his five-year contract runs out. 
</P>
<P>
"You look back on people that have done three, four, five seasons there, and 
they have a legacy that they can be proud of," Carvey says. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I would just love to be connected to that whole legacy. And 
hopefully next year will be my best year."
