HARD 'KNOCKS' FOR DANA CARVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Dana Carvey is such a blissfully twerpy presence on "Saturday Night Live" that 
his astonishing, Peter Sellers-like gift for mimicry is an added comic bonus. 
In his Church Lady and George Bush characterizations, he raises clenched WASP 
rectitude to dizzying satiric heights. 
</P>
<P>
In director Donald Petrie's "Opportunity Knocks" (citywide), Carvey has his 
first starring role in the movies. It's clearly meant to capitalize on his SNL 
personas; he gets a chance to impersonate an East Indian, a Japanese, and 
George Bush -- though not Church Lady. The results ought to be, if nothing 
else, an orgy of Carvey Characters, but few of his impersonations take hold. 
</P>
<P>
And when he's not dithering with some funny accent he's playing an affable con 
man with a heart of gold. He's supposed to be a romantic leading man here, and 
if there's one thing Carvey shouldn't be playing right now, it's romantic 
leads. Nothing kills comedy quicker than all this blubbery, ardent "sincerity." 
</P>
<P>
The plot has Carvey's Eddie and, later, his con-artist buddy Lou (Todd Graff) 
taking up residence in the ritzy suburban Chicago house they've broken into. 
The owner's mother (Doris Belack) mistakes Eddie for her son's house sitter -- 
and best friend from college. The father (Robert Loggia) is so taken with 
Eddie, whom he believes to be a hot-shot Harvard MBA type, that he secures him 
a vice presidency in his flagging bathroom fixtures company. And their 
physician daughter (Julia Campbell), initially skeptical of Eddie's supposed 
womanizer rep, also falls for him. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, Eddie falls for her, too. Since this whole scam is supposed to be a "love 
con" -- that is, Eddie sets out to wangle Dad's fortune by wooing the daughter 
-- his true-love stirrings threaten to ruin everything. 
</P>
<P>
They do more than ruin his scam; they ruin the movie. Carvey doesn't have the 
flair or the dramatic heft to portray a heartfelt romancer, and the script, by 
Mitchell Katlin and Nat Bernstein, doesn't provide the situations that might 
turn Eddie's seductions into something newfangled and funny. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing about "Opportunity Knocks" (rated PG-13) is newfangled; the jokes and 
plot mechanisms are moldy, even the characters are retreads. Robert Loggia's 
familial tycoon, for example, is a recap of his role in "Big." 
</P>
<P>
If you want to see Carvey do his George Bush impression, why haul yourself 
through this movie when you can just tune in to "Saturday Night Live"? Carvey 
is a wonderful lightweight joker who needs a tailor-made vehicle to shine. 
"Opportunity Knocks" is strictly off the rack.
