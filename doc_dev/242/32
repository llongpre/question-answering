   Hank Williams Jr., the son of a music
legend, and K.T. Oslin, who launched a career at age 44 and still
does the chores at home, each won two Country Music Association
awards.
   Williams was voted entertainer of the year for the second
straight year, joining Barbara Mandrelland the group Alabama as the
only performers to have won it more than once. His ``Born to
Boogie'' won top album in Monday night's presentations broadcast
nationally by CBS-TV.
   Oslin was voted the year's top female vocalist and won best song
for her poignant ``80's Ladies.'' The awards came just two years
after she began singing country music professionally following
minor singing roles on Broadway and making television commercials
for items like denture products.
   Randy Travis, whose album ``Always &amp; Forever'' has sold 3
million copies, won No. 1 male vocalist for the second straight
year at the black-tie ceremonies at the Grand Ole Opry House.
   Williams, 39, whose father, Hank Williams Sr., sang country
weepers like ``Your Cheatin' Heart'' in the early 1950s, said he
performed more than two decades before he began winning awards
three years ago for his rousing blend of country, rock 'n' roll and
blues.
   ``The longer the wait, the sweeter the sugar,'' Williams said
after Monday night's 22nd annual presentations.
   ``I love to entertain. When I'm on that stage I'm right at home.
It's a family tradition, you know.''
   Oslin, 46, ended a four-year reign by Reba McEntire by winning
the bullet-shaped trophy as the top female vocalist. She has become
known for writing well-crafted songs from the viewpoint of a
middle-aged woman and said her life is middle-class.
   ``I'm still going to the grocery store and picking up laundry
and sweeping and raking and doing all that,'' she said.
   ``I watched this show (on television) for two years; one year I
watched it crying, and another year I couldn't watch it at all,''
Oslin said about past career disappointments.
   McEntire, a former rodeo barrel racer, won nothing this year
though she has five previous CMA awards to her credit, including
entertainer of the year in 1986.
   The single of the year was ``18 Wheels &amp; a Dozen Roses,'' by
Kathy Mattea, a former tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame.
   Other winners included the mother-daughter Judds, vocal duo of
the year; veterans Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton,
top vocal event; Highway 101, group of the year; Ricky Van Shelton,
Horizon Award for a rising performer, and guitarist Chet Atkins,
musician of the year for the ninth time in his long career.
   Loretta Lynn, whose life was the subject of the 1980 movie
``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' and cowboy singer Roy Rogers became the
47th and 48th members of the Country Music Hall of Fame.
