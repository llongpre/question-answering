   Hank Williams Jr. won two Country Music
Association awards Monday night, including entertainer of the year
for the second straight year, upsetting favored Randy Travis, who
won as best male vocalist.
   Williams, son of the late Hank Williams, also won album of the
year for ``Born to Boogie'' in the nationally televised
presentation of the 22nd annual ceremony at the Grand Ole Opry
House.
   ``I love to entertain. When I'm on that stage I'm right at home.
It's a family tradition, you know,'' he said, alluding to one of
his songs.
   He shared top honors with relative newcomer K.T. Oslin, who was
voted female vocalist of the year and won song of the year for
``80's Ladies.''
   Oslin, who has been singing country music professionally for
only two years, ended a four-year reign by Reba McEntire in that
category. The 46-year-old singer has made her mark writing songs
from the viewpoint of a middle-aged woman.
   ``I watched this show for two years; one year I watched it
crying, and another year I couldn't watch it at all,'' Oslin said.
   Travis, a former dish washer and short order cook, won male
vocalist of the year for the second straight time, receiving the
award after host Dolly Parton walked into the crowd and sat on his
lap while introducing the nominees.
   ``After all that I found myself trying to remember what I'd just
won,'' he said.
   ``That's a great lineup of talent to be in,'' Travis said of his
fellow nominees. ``I tell you it's great for me to get to be around
those people and get to talk to them and actually know these
people.''
   Loretta Lynn and Roy Rogers became the 47th and 48th members of
the Country Music Hall of Fame. Lynn, born into poverty in the east
Kentucky coal fields, capped a 28-year career with the honor.
Rogers, the ``King of the Cowboys,'' was cited for his western
songs, such as ``Happy Trails to You.''
   Kathy Mattea's ``18 Wheels &amp; a Dozen Roses'' was named single of
the year.
   It was the first CMA award for the 29-year-old Mattea, a former
tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame who had been nominated
six times before.
   Other winners included the mother and daughter team the Judds,
vocal duo of the year; veterans Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris and
Parton, top vocal event; Highway 101, group of the year; Ricky Van
Shelton, winner of the Horizon Award for up-and-coming talent; and
Chet Atkins, musician of the year for the ninth time.
   Earlier, Williams and other recording stars gathered to sign a
birthday card to Middle East hostage Terry A. Anderson.
   ``Hang in there, and when you come home we're gonna sing
together,'' Williams wrote on the card shortly before the program
began.
   ``That would be one of my best duets with anybody,'' said
Williams, who is said to be Anderson's favorite singer.
   Prior to the show, the artists signed the card, an 18- by
24-inch greeting with a yellow ribbon that reads, ``Happy Birthday
Terry! From Music City, USA! We all love you and pray for your
release!''
   Anderson turns 41 on Oct. 27. The chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press was abducted March 16, 1985.
   About 4,400 country music singers, writers and producers began
arriving two hours before the show, many in limousines as fans
lined the road leading to the rear stage entrance.

   Some of the biggest names in country music _ Willie Nelson,
Kenny Rogers, Barbara Mandrell, the Oak Ridge Boys and Loretta Lynn
_ failed to make the five finalists in any of the 10 categories.
   The first entertainer of the year was Eddy Arnold in 1967.
   Winners were chosen by the 7,000 singers, musicians,
songwriters, disc jockeys and others who are professionals in
country music. But Hall of Fame awards are selected by an anonymous
panel of judges.
   Other music ceremonies were scheduled throughout the week ln
Nashville, including awards presentations by several songwriting
groups. The Grand Ole Opry, a live country music show, celebrates
its 63rd birthday during various activities this weekend.
