   Pulitzer Prize-winning historian
James MacGregor Burns is planning to fly from Leningrad, to London,
to New York, to Washington and attempt one-mile runs in each city _
all in a day.
   ``If I can do it in one day, it will remind us how close these
nations are geographically and hence must be economically and
politically,'' Burns said in a statement issued Tuesday by Williams
College, where he is a political science professor.
   College spokesman James Kolesar said the 70-year-old Burns will
attempt the feat Friday, traveling between the cities on regularly
scheduled flights.
   According to Kolesar, Burns, who was in Moscow this week, said
he would make the runs to commemorate the bicentennial of the
American Bill of Rights, to celebrate the coming of glasnost in the
Soviet Union and to show that ``we septuagenarians are still alive
and kicking.''
   His run in Leningrad will take him from the Winter Palace, where
the czars lived, to a revolutionary shrine. In London, he will run
from Buckingham Palace to parliament. In New York, his route takes
him from Federal Hall to the spot off Broadway where James Madison
drafted the first provisions of the Bill of Rights. And in
Washington, the route goes from the Washington Monument to the
Jefferson Memorial.

   Drummer Michael Clarke, an original member of
the 1960s rock group, The Byrds, has permission from a judge to
continue using the name of the band for one he has formed.
   Clarke was sued in U.S. District Court by three former band
members _ Roger McGuinn, Chris Hillman and David Crosby.
   They accused Clarke, Artists International Management Inc. in
Boca Raton and AIM agent Steve Green of false advertising and
unfair competition in using the name The Byrds.
   Judge William Castagna said last Thursday that he found little
to support the accusations and allowed the 45-year-old Clarke to
use the name.
   The judge said the former band members have known for at least
four years that Clarke had used the name in more than 300 concerts
but didn't try to stop him. The suit was filed more than a month
ago.
   The Byrds hit the top of the charts in 1965 with ``Mr.
Tambourine Man,'' then followed with other hits including ``Eight
Miles High,'' ``Mr. Spaceman'' and ``Turn! Turn! Turn!''

   British rock star Sting visited
Australia's hottest environmental trouble spot after meeting Prime
Minister Bob Hawke to promote a campaign to save Amazonian rain
forests.
   The former singer of the group Police went to the Eden rain
forests near the Snowy Mountains of southern New South Wales to
show his support for the conservation issue.
   Since February, 550 demonstrators have been arrested at the Eden
forests. Shortly after Sting's visit Tuesday, police arrrested for
trespassing 28 demonstrators who walked into a protected area of
the forests.
   Sting's visit caps a world tour that has included Britain, the
United States and Japan to raise awareness for the vanishing
jungles of Brazil.
   ``I don't pretend to be an expert on this problem here,'' he
said. ``But one thing I did learn while in Japan recently is that
they don't log their own forests. They don't need to, they log
yours.''
   Japan is a leading importer of logs from the U.S. Northwest and
other areas of the world.
   Hawke pledged $187,500 toward the protection of the Amazon rain
forests.

   A judge approved the sale of a Grandma Moses
painting owned by Sir Rudolf Bing to raise cash for the former
Metropolitan Opera director's care in a nursing home.
   State Judge Eve Preminger on Tuesday authorized the sale of
``Haying in Vermont'' at an auction today at Sotheby's. The judge
required a minimum bid of $35,000, based on an appraisal of the
painting.
   ``The money situation is absolutely desperate,'' said Kevin
Walsh, lawyer for Paul Guth, Bing's court-appointed guardian.
   Bing, 87, is suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
   Guth blamed the drain on Bing's estate on security guards who
were needed to keep Bing's wife, Carroll Douglass Bing, from
running off with him as she was accused of doing nearly two years
ago.
   Bing and his wife, a former mental patient, were married in a
civil ceremony in 1987.
   A judge is expected to decide soon whether to annul the marriage
as Bing's guardian has requested.
