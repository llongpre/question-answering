   Actress Rita Moreno was host of the
20th annual Golden Eagle Awards honoring Hispanic achievement in the
entertainment industry.
   Stage and screen actor Raul Julia received the outstanding actor
Golden Eagle, and the outstanding actress was Rosana De Soto. Ms. De
Soto is best known for the movie ``La Bamba,'' about 1950s rocker
Ritchie Valens, while Julia has worked in many films and plays,
including recent appearances in an off-Broadway production of
``Macbeth'' and in the film ``Romero.''
   Special awards went to farm labor organizer Cesar Chavez, who
received a lifetime achievement award, and entertainer Bob Hope, who
was honored for his ``tireless efforts on behalf of dozens of
organizations.''
   Pop vocalist Gloria Estefan, lead singer of the Miami Sound
Machine, was named outstanding female performer, during Friday's
two-hour ceremony at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
   Emmanuel, a Mexican-born male vocalist whose 10 albums have sold
more than 10 million copies, was named outstanding male performer.
   Actress Joanna Kerns, star of ABC-TV's series ``Growing Pains,''
was awarded an outstanding TV actress Golden Eagle for her realistic
portrayal of a working mother.
   Actor Paul Rodriguez, who appears on the new CBS series ``Grand
Slam,'' was named outstanding TV actor.
   The 1990 Golden Eagle Award for most promising actor was given to
Francesco Quinn, the oldest son of actor Anthony Quinn.
Peruvian-born Jenny Gago was named most promising actress.
   The awards were conceived in 1970 by Ricardo Montalban, Richard
Hernandez and other Hispanic actors as a way to change Hollywood's
stereotypes of Latino actors.
   ``Most were playing roles as gigolos, hoodlums, servants,
prostitutes and lazy good for nothing Mexicans,'' according to an
event program.

   Roy Rogers, ``the king of the cowboys,''
is back in the saddle. Rogers is teaming up with some country music
stars to record an album of songs with a western flavor.
   RCA Records officials said Friday that Rogers already has
recorded the song ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds'' with country star K.T.
Oslin.
   Other singers who have agreed to participate in the project
include Waylon Jennings, Emmylou Harris, Ricky Van Shelton and the
group Restless Heart.
   ``I haven't made any (records) for a long time,'' Rogers, 78,
told reporters. ``They talked me into it, so I thought I'd take a
try at it.''
   The album is expected to be released in 1991.
   Rogers helped organize the western singing group, ``Sons of the
Pioneers,'' in 1932. He left the group in 1937 to pursue a movie
career.
   He and his wife, actress Dale Evans, have recorded more than 400
songs in their career.

   Country singer Vern Gosdin says he turned
his 1989 divorce into a career boost.
   Nine songs on the album ``Alone'' came from the breakup of his
11-year marriage, Gosdin said during an interview last week.
   ``I cried all the way to the bank,'' he said, chuckling. ``I can
laugh now that it's over, can't I?''
   Since 1984, Gosdin has had a string of hit records, including ``I
Can Tell by the Way You Dance,'' ``Chiseled in Stone'' and ``Set 'em
Up Joe.''
   ``Chiseled in Stone'' was voted song of the year in 1989 by the
Country Music Association.
   Gosdin, 55, will have an album of his greatest hits coming out
later this year.

   Bob Hope will speak at Palm Springs
High School's graduation thanks to the persistence of senior class
leaders.
   Repeated inquiries to Hope went unanswered, so Robert
Shahnazarian, the senior class president, and Greg Schmalle, the
vice president, decided to visit the comedian's Los Angeles office
on the spur of the moment.
   ``Greg had really been pushing to get Ronald Reagan as our
speaker,'' Shahnazarian said. ``He couldn't do it, but he invited us
to his Century City office to give us a letter we could read at
graduation.
   ``So after we went there, we went unannounced to Mr. Hope's
office and we told his secretary what we were there for,'' he said.
``She went away for a few minutes and when she came back, she said
he had agreed to speak.''
   Only holders of tickets given to the 600 graduates can attend
Thursday's graduation at the Convention Center.
   Hope's publicist, Ward Grant, said Friday that the 87-year-old
entertainer speaks at two high school or college commencements each
year.
   ``Bob decided he would speak at Palm Springs because it is close
to his heart,'' Grant said. ``Palm Springs is, after all, one of his
three homes _ Palm Springs, Toluca Lake and airport terminals.''

   Actor Jim Varney, in the person of Ernest P.
Worrell _ that ``Hey Vern'' rube of movie and advertising fame _ has
been drafted to pitch the Atlanta Braves.
   No, he isn't on the mound, but the cellar-dwelling Braves
probably couldn't do much worse if he were.
   The Braves' front office has been taking some heat for trotting
out Ernest as a promotion gimmick with all the subtlety befitting
the character. On radio, fans hear Ernest yelling at Vern to buy
tickets _ as often as every half-inning. At the ballpark, Ernest's
6-foot-tall face grins maniacally above the Gate G ticket windows.
   Braves' promotions director Miles McRea can't understand why
everybody's down on Ernest, a veteran pitchman of numerous
television commercials.
   ``His movies are hits,'' McRea said. ``He's been used for
Coca-Cola, Disney _ reputable companies. But who gets all the
(media) play for using him? We do.''
