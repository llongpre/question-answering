   K.T. Oslin, who emerged as 1988's robust
queen of down-home music with ``Eighties Ladies,'' got five Academy
of Country Music Award nominations, including best record for ``I'll
Always Come Back.''
   Among the nominees announced during a Tuesday morning news
conference at Disneyland were eight who got three nominations
apiece, including such venerable performers as Reba McEntire, Randy
Travis and Hank Williams Jr.
   The 24th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards ceremony takes
place April 10 in Burbank and will be televised as a two-hour
special on NBC-TV. Ballots cast by the 2,000 academy members decide
winners.
   Miss Oslin also won nods for female vocalist, her album ``This
Woman'' and two video nominations, for ``Hold Me'' and ``I'll Always
Come Back.''
   In addition to competing for the biggest share of ACM ``Hat''
trophies, Miss Oslin joins ``Dallas'' star Patrick Duffy and
gentleman cowboy George Strait as hosts of the show.
   Miss Oslin, the academy's best new female artist last year,
failed to win a nomination in the coveted entertainer of the year
category, however. Those nods went to familiar faces: Alabama, The
Judds, Strait, Travis and Williams.
   Male vocalist nominees were Strait, Travis, Williams, Ricky Van
Shelton and Dwight Yoakam, while female vocalist contenders were
Miss Oslin, Miss McEntire, Tanya Tucker, Rosanne Cash and Kathy
Mattea.
   New female vocalist nominees were Vicki Bird, Suzy Bogguss, Cee
Cee Chapman, Linda Davis and Donna Meade, while contenders in the
new male category were Rodney Crowell, J.C. Crowley, Skip Ewing,
David Lynn Jones and Paul Overstreet.
   Top group nods went to Alabama, The Desert Rose Band, Highway
101, The Oak Ridge Boys and Restless Heart, and duet nominees were
the Bellamy Brothers, Rodney Crowell-Rosanne Cash, The Judds,
Sweethearts of the Rodeo and Dwight Yoakam-Buck Owens.
   Single record nominees included ``Don't Close Your Eyes,'' Keith
Whitley; ``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses,'' Miss Mattea; ``I
Told You So,'' Travis; ``I'll Always Come Back,'' Miss Oslin; ``I'll
Leave This World Loving You,'' Van Shelton; and ``Strong Enough to
Bend,'' Miss Tucker.
   Best song contenders were ``Don't Close Your Eyes,'' Whitley;
``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses,'' Miss Mattea; ``I Know How He
Feels,'' Miss McEntire; ``Set 'Em Up Joe,'' Vern Gosdin; and
``Strong Enough to Bend,'' Miss Tucker.
   Album of the year nominees were ``Buenos Noches From a Lonely
Room,'' Yoakam; ``Chiseled in Stone,'' Gosdin; ``If You Ain't Lovin'
You Ain't Livin','' Strait; ``Loving Proof,'' Van Shelton; and
``This Woman,'' Miss Oslin.
   Video contenders were ``The Old Man No One Loves,'' George Jones;
``Sunday Kind of Love,'' Miss McEntire; ``Hold Me,'' Miss Oslin;
``I'll Always Come Back,'' Miss Oslin; and ``Young Country,''
Williams.
