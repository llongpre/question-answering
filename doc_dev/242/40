   Dana Carvey, the Church Lady of ``Saturday Night
Live,'' is taking another stab at the movies. But this time will be
different.
   ``It's the first time I've ever been in a film and gotten to be
funny,'' said Carvey, who co-stars in ``Moving'' with Richard Pryor.
   Carvey plays ``a very upstanding young man'' named Brad Sanders.
Pryor is moving his family from New Jersey to Idaho; Sanders is
hired to drive Pryor's prize Saab Turbo to the new home.
   ``And it's not until later that he finds I'm a world renowned,
10-person schizophrenic,'' Carvey says.
   ``We mostly see three of them. We see him as a straight person.
We see him as a sort of Norman Bates-type character _ kind of
weird. And we seen him in a character like Dennis Hopper in
`Apocalypse Now.' No one can get close to him. Sort of a burned-out
character.''
   Carvey describes the movie as ``a fun, free-flowing comedy.'' He
was allowed to improvise, allowed to flesh out his characters.
   Pryor ``was incredibly generous to me, and just a gentle, sweet
person to work with, just generous. There was none of this, `Get
out of the way, kid.' It was totally, `What do you want to do?' and
`Go ahead.' It was nice.''
   For a long time, Carvey was pegged as the bland nice guy, an
innocent kid. He was in 1985's ``Tough Guys'' as the probation
officer of aged convicts Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. He also
was pigeonholed in a series of TV shows, including Mickey Rooney's
straight man in a short-lived 1981 NBC sitcom, ``One of the Boys.''
   Then, in October 1986, he finally got his chance to do comedy on
television with ``Saturday Night Live,'' introducing audiences to
the Church Lady, burned-out rock singer Derek Stevens, Lord
Christie and a host of other characters, personalities and voices.
   Newsweek magazine credited him with ``almost singlehandedly
rejuvenating'' the show.
   Now in his second season on the show, Carvey is changing his
repertoire. The self-righteous, judgmental Church Lady will only be
doing two or three more appearances this year; Carvey says many of
the weekly guest hosts want to do the skit, but he is concerned
about burning out the character.
   This season his characters have included Hans, who, with Franz
(``SNL'' regular Kevin Nealon) offer physical fitness instruction
on TV.
   ``They have some of the same elements as the Church Lady, with a
superior attitude, but totally the other way. Instead of being a
54-year-old spinster, I'm a 25-year-old Austrian weight lifter.''
   Hans and Franz epitomize ``vanity obsession with being fit'' _
characters who say, ``I'm superior to you, because I have these
muscles,''' Carvey says.
   ``That's what the real fun of playing these characters is. It's
making fun of those people who really feel they have the truth and
the answers for everybody. Self-righteous, arrogant, `I'm superior
to you' people drive me nuts.''
   Carvey has had other movie offers but has turned them down
because he didn't find the characters very likable.
   ``Mostly, they were kind of glib ... and I just feel that's not
my style,'' he says.
   ``I want to find a different style, someone who's a little more
vulnerable than funny, and then evolves. My whole thing is that
everybody's sort of pretending, just a little bit, that they're a
little bit stronger than they are. Everybody.''
