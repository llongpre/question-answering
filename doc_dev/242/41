   Somebody asked Chris Rock, one of two new
members of the ``Saturday Night Live'' cast introduced at a news
conference Tuesday, if he felt ``haunted by the ghost of Eddie
Murphy.''
   Rock looked nonplussed. ``Eddie's still alive, ain't he?'' he
said. Rock, 23, a standup comedian since age 18, then allowed that
he was bringing his own perspective to the 16th season of the
late-night NBC variety show.
   ``I always wanted to be, like, a black guy on `Saturday Night
Live,''' said Rock, an 8-year-old when ``SNL'' premiered in 1975.
Murphy, who joined the show in 1980, went to become one of the
nation's biggest box office draws.
   ``I always wanted to be on it, too,'' said stocky, blond,
blue-eyed Chris Farley, 26, a former Second City trouper, and the
other new member of the cast. A native of Wisconsin, Farley is a
graduate of Marquette University. He joined the Chicago comedy
troupe in the fall of 1988 and traveled with The Second City
National Touring Company.
   Rock makes his home in Brooklyn's Fort Greene neighborhood ``a
block over from Spike,'' he said, referring to moviemaker Spike
Lee.
   Rock and Farley are replacing Jon Lovitz and Nora Dunn, who have
left the show to pursue other ventures in the entertainment
business.
   The returning cast members are Dana Carvey, Dennis Miller, Jan
Hooks, Phil Hartman, Victoria Jackson, Kevin Nealon and Mike Myers.
The two Chrises are ``featured performers'' with A. Whitney Brown
and Al Franken.
   ``I think this will be a great season and I think you'll see
lots of new characters,'' said the show's producer, Lorne Michaels.
   The season premiere with host Kyle MacLachlan, who plays
demented FBI agent Dale Cooper on ABC's ``Twin Peaks, and musical
guest Sinead O'Connor.
   Last season, O'Connor and departing cast member Dunn boycotted
the show which had raunch comedian Andrew Dice Clay as its host.
The show was the season's highest-rated.
   Other ``SNL'' guest hosts slated for the new season include
``All My Children'' soap opera star Susan Lucci, former New York
Yankees president George Steinbrenner, musician Paul Simon, and
actors Patrick Swayze, Christian Slater and Tom Hanks, Michaels
said.
