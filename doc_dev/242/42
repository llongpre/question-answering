It's probably a mistake to think you can take the conventions of sleazy 
melodrama and purify them by tacking on serious themes, social consciousness. 
Sleazy melodrama has its own level of artistry; you can't graft integrity onto 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In "Face of the Enemy" (at the Monica 4-Plex), a low-budget independent 
thriller with a "torn from the headlines" plot, the protagonists are a beefy 
security guard (George DiCenzo) and the terrified Iranian woman (Rosana DeSoto) 
he ties up and imprisons in his cellar. 
</P>
<P>
The movie isn't done in a tawdry, opportunistic way. It doesn't try much for 
cheap shocks, dirty shocks or too many shocks of any kind. But there's 
something tawdry and opportunistic about the set-up. "Face of the Enemy" can't 
really be a movie of ideas, because it's too tied to its melodramatic plot, and 
it can't explode the melodrama into any physical or sensual excitement, because 
it's trying to be tasteful, responsible -- even when the security guard is 
glowering while his victim strips in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the story is the guard's belief that his captive is an Iranian who 
interrogated him as a hostage; now he's putting her through the same hell. 
Director Hassan Ildari loads the movie up with flashbacks to show the guard's 
obsession, torment, his brooding over pains past. But the movie wilts on its 
own good intentions, becomes an empty technical exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Ildari, an Iranian immigrant and AFI graduate, also wrote the original story 
but, together with his Australian screenwriter, Philip Alderton, he's concocted 
a vision of American life that seems foreign, edgy, empty of any kind of solid, 
day-to-day routine. The characters, despite good acting by DiCenzo and DeSoto, 
are figures in a landscape that's never been filled in, trapped in a house that 
doesn't seem lived in, doomed to keep tumbling into the same obsessive 
flashbacks and surly interchanges, until the cops or the final credits finally 
show up. 
</P>
<P>
"Face of the Enemy" (Times-rated Mature for violence and partial nudity) tries 
to prod us into some soul-searching about the nature of political and personal 
tyranny. But it can't. The so-called "ideas" can't disguise the sordid plot 
formulas -- and, since these movie makers aren't willing to dive down into the 
sleaze, they can't give us any real ideas, or emotions, worth keeping.
