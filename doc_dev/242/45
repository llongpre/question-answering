<HEAD>Rivera Undergoes Nose Surgery; Cancels `Saturday Night Live'
Appearance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Talk-show host Geraldo Rivera underwent surgery
on his broken nose and will skip a scheduled appearance on tonight's
``Saturday Night Live,'' his spokesman said.
   Rivera's nose was broken Thursday in a brawl that broke out
during the taping of an episode of his syndicated TV show on Young
Hatemongers.
   His spokesman, Jeff Erdel, said Rivera was ``groggy and very
uncomfortable'' after nearly three hours of surgery at a doctor's
office Friday.
   The doctor ordered Rivera, bandaged and wearing a splint on his
nose, to stay in bed.
   Dinah Minot, associate producer of NBC's ``Saturday Night Live,''
said Rivera was to appear with Morton Downey Jr., another
controversial talk-show host, on a ``Church Lady'' segment,
featuring comedian Dana Carvey as the prissy moderator of a
religious talk show.
   The free-for-all Thursday, which lasted about a minute, started
when John Metzger, leader of the White Aryan Resistance Youth,
called Roy Innis, chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality, an
``Uncle Tom.''
   Innis got out of his chair and grabbed Metzger by the neck and
other supremacists stormed the stage, ``like a bench-clearing brawl
at a hockey match,'' Rivera said afterward.
   Rivera's nose was broken by a chair that became airborne during
the fracas.
