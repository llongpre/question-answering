   George Strait was voted entertainer of
the year and Ricky Van Shelton and Kathy Mattea won top vocalist
honors Monday night at the 23rd annual Country Music Association
awards show.
   Strait won the top honor at the Grand Ole Opry House, breaking a
two-year hold on the award by Hank Williams Jr.
   ``I'm so excited. I've wanted this for so long,'' Strait said.
``I truly believe audiences go away entertained.''
   Strait, a former Texas trail boss, is known for hits such as
``All My Ex's Live in Texas'' and ``Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your
Mind.'' His selection as entertainer of the year left country star
Randy Travis without an award for the third year Travis was
nominated.
   Shelton, a former pipefitter, was chosen top male vocalist for
his recent hit records ``From a Jack to a King'' and ``Hole in My
Pocket.''
   ``I thank God he gave me a voice instead of big feet,'' Shelton
said.
   Mattea, a former tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame,
won top female vocalist on the heels of her No. 1 record, ``Come
From the Heart.''
   ``I've always liked to do this, because I liked the doing of
it,'' she said as her voice choked with emotion.
   Williams, son of a country music legend, was the night's only
double winner. He won best video for ``There's a Tear in My Beer''
and vocal event of the year for integrating his voice with his
father's on the same song. The vocal event of the year is presented
to two performers who do not normally sing together.
   The late Keith Whitley, 33, who died of an accidental alcohol
overdose in May, won single of the year for his hit ``I'm No
Stranger to the Rain.'' His award was accepted by his widow, singer
Lorrie Morgan.
   ``Five months ago on this date, I lost the world's greatest
husband, and country music, in my eyes, lost the world's greatest
singer,'' she said.
   The mother-daughter team the Judds won duo of the year, making
it the fifth consecutive year they won either duo of the year or
group of the year.
   ``I think as time goes by, we appreciate it more every day,''
daughter Wynonna Judd. ``Music isn't just a living, it's our life.''
   Singer Hank Thompson and music publishers Jack Stapp and Cliffie
Stone were chosen for the Country Music Hall of Fame.
   Other winners included: the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's ``Will the
Circle Be Unbroken Vol. II'' for top album; Highway 101 for group
of the year for the second year in a row; fiddler Johnny Gimble for
musician of the year; ``Chiseled in Stone'' by Max D. Barnes and
Vern Gosdin for song of the year, a songwriters' award; and Clint
Black for the Horizon award, given for career advancement to an
artist who has never won a CMA award.
   Singers Anne Murray and Kenny Rogers were hosts of the
nationally televised two-hour show on CBS.

   The first entertainer of the year was Eddy Arnold in 1967.
   Winners were chosen by the 5,469 voting members of the CMA,
mostly singers, musicians, songwriters, record company employees
and disc jockeys. The Hall of Fame honorees were selected by an
anonmyous panel.
