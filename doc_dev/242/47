   Character actor Bob Lussier is turning his
back on Hollywood to become a Benedictine monk.
   Lussier, 55, the Volkswagen driver with the three sweaty
passengers in the Dial soap TV commercial and veteran of 26 films
over the last quarter-century, is trading his $365,000 Hollywood
hilltop home for a 10-foot-square room.
   He plans to spend the rest of his life at Pecos Benedictine
Monastery in Pecos, N.M. He said he decided his new role after a
visit to the Roman Catholic order in 1988.
   Lussier's movie credits include ``Johnny Got His Gun,'' ``The
Killing of Sister George,'' ``Mr. Mom'' and ``Pete and Tillie.''
He's also appeared in more than 200 TV commercials.
   But he was troubled by the Hollywood product and what he
considers its gratuitous portrayals of sex and violence, Lussier
said.
   ``I was being called upon to do some pretty tacky stuff,'' he
said. ``The care that people used to take with their productions
was missing. It all seemed to change the minute the non-artistic
corporations started buying film companies.''
   As Brother Lussier, he will say a prayer for Hollywood
decision-makers.
   ``I ask that they have a greater awareness of from where they've
received all of their gifts,'' he said. ``Hopefully they can use
those gifts in a way that will be respectable to God as they see
him.''

   As national television cameras rolled, hotel
queen and convicted tax evader Leona Helmsley wrote a check for $42
million to the Internal Revenue Service.
   Mrs. Helmsley said she agreed to be videotaped by the syndicated
Fox TV program ``A Current Affair'' to dispel any notion that she
doesn't pay her taxes. A witness in her federal tax-evasion trial
last year testified that Mrs. Helmsley said only the ``little
people'' pay taxes.
   Mrs. Helmsley said she and her husband, Harry, have already paid
$22 million in federal taxes for 1989 and another $30 million in
city and state taxes.
   She signed the check Friday at her Harley Sandcastle hotel in
Sarasota, Fla., where the couple are vacationing.
   As she realized she was signing a check on Friday the 13th, she
said, ``My lucky day, yup, my lucky day.''
   Mrs. Helmsley was convicted of evading more than $1.2 million in
federal taxes between 1983 and 1985 by billing personal expenses
through the Helmsley business. She was sentenced to four years in
prison, fined $7.1 million and ordered to pay $1.7 million in back
taxes and do 750 hours of community service. She remains free on
bail pending her appeal.

   Dana Carvey, the Church Lady in ``Saturday
Night Live,'' was wary about the title of his first starring movie,
``Opportunity Knocks.''
   ``I hate to give my critics ammunition with a title like that,''
he said. `` ... It could have been worse. It could have been called
`The Really Good Movie.' Then they could say, `The Really Good
Movie wasn't.'''
   The critics weren't as unkind as he feared. Several reviewers
said the comic has a real future in films, while others found the
script wanting. The film, about a small-time con man who hits it
big, has drawn modest returns in the nation's theaters.
   Carvey, 34, is the latest of the parade of ``Saturday Night
Live'' comics who have transferred to the big screen. The Church
Lady was his most notable creation: he also appeared as Hans of the
bodybuilding Hans and Franz, and mimicked George Bush, George
Michael and George Burns.

   Hoffs will play guitar and percussion on several songs, and has

   Billionaire New York developer Donald Trump thinks
the only way to win the war against drug barons is to legalize
narcotics.
   ``We're losing badly the war on drugs,'' Trump told a Miami
Herald luncheon Friday. ``You have to legalize drugs to win that
war. You have to take the profit away from these drug czars.''
   Tax revenues from a legalized drug trade could be spent to
educate people about the dangers of drugs, Trump said in a speech
to about 700 people at the newspaper's Company of the Year Awards
luncheon.
   He blamed the country's current drug problems on politicians who
``don't have any guts.''
