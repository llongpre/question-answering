   Barbara Bush confessed Sunday to only one
regret about the annual White House Correspondents Association
dinner: She missed Marla.
   Mrs. Bush told reporters that despite trying, she never did
catch a glimpse of the blonde bombshell, Marla Maples, the
so-called other woman in Donald Trump's split with his wife.
   The model and budding actress created a sensation at the
black-tie banquet Saturday night just by showing up as a guest of
Time magazine.
   The first lady, chatting with reporters on the White House lawn
after church, said she had tried to spot Ms. Maples from the dais,
to no avail.
   Many in the crowd of 2,500 reporters, politicians and other
guests who were able to navigate the crowded aisles had better
luck, although two bodyguards kept papparizzi and other
curiosity-seekers from pressing too close to the Time table.
   They couldn't protect Ms. Maples from ``Saturday Night Live''
comedian Dennis Miller, who cracked a few jokes at her expense.
   ``Flew in this afternoon on the Trump Shuttle, or as it's been
affectionately renamed `The Ugly American Airline,'' said Miller,
quickly adding, ``Marla, kidding, kidding. ... I love him, too.''
   Bush did his own stand-up comedy routine, with press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater and his recent diet serving as a foil.
   ``We originally wanted to launch the Hubble Telescope a year ago
to take a group shot of Marlin,'' said Bush. ``No, he looks great,
though.''
   Fitzwater's ``whole attitude has changed,'' said Bush. ``I
remember the day long ago when Pinochet stepped down. I said,
`Isn't it great? Chile is free.' Marlin said, `Good! When do we
eat?'''
   Bush said Fitzwater ``does keep me informed. Recently he said,
`A lot of reporters are talking about the strange stuff we're
seeing on T.V.'
   ``I said, `You mean ``Twin Peaks'' or ``The Simpsons'' or
``Ninja Turtles''? Marlin said, `No, I mean you announcing the
Gorbachev summit while standing next to Michael Jackson,''' said
Bush.
   ``I told him I'm not taking the rap for this Michael Jackson
thing. Rose Garden. Sun glasses. No coat, no tie. No expression.
Bored. A little confused. I just figured he was another White House
correspondent.''
   Bush said, ``We got Dennis tonight because this evening's
`Saturday Night Live' was replaced by Hulk Hogan's `Wrestlemania.'
NBC got first pick.
   ``I every once in a while stay awake and watch this `Saturday
Night Live,''' said Bush.
   Dana Carvey's impression is ``so good that I asked him to phone
Rafsanjani and tell him that it was George Bush, but Dana said,
`Wouldn't be prudent, wouldn't be prudent,''' quipped the president.
   Other famous faces in the crowd included actress Angie Dickinson
and Red Auerbach, chomping a cigar to celebrate a 157-128 record
Boston Celtics romp over the New York Knicks in the National
Basketball Association playoffs.
