   An investor who says he's acting on behalf of disgruntled preferred stockholders of Chicago Milwaukee Corp. said the group plans to call for a special election to replace two new directors. 

   Robert J. Rosan, a lawyer here and a preferred holder, said he sent a letter to the Chicago-based holding company asking it to cooperate with "our intended solicitation of proxies for such an election." 
He said the group owns more than 20% of the preferred shares, but that he expects that percentage to grow as other preferred holders respond to a separate letter asking them for support. 

   In addition to replacing the two directors, Mr. Rosan said in an interview that his group wants to negotiate retirement of the preferred stock or a conversion of the preferred into common. 
Mr. Rosan noted that Chicago Milwaukee has not been paying dividends on the preferred. 

   Edwin Jacobson, Chicago Milwaukee's president and chief executive officer, said he hadn't received the letter. 
But he said the company is only obligated to pay preferred dividends if it wishes to pay them on its common or to purchase its common stock. 

   Mr. Jacobson said preferred holders elected the two new directors at the company's recent annual meeting, as is their right when dividends aren't paid on the preferred. 

   "We are pursuing acquisitions, including a major acquisition, and accordingly we have decided to conserve our cash for that purpose," he said.
