   Singer Randy Travis gets another shot
tonight at one of the few awards he's never won - the Country Music
Association's entertainer of the year.
   He's sold more than 10 million records and has been a finalist
for the award three times, but the CMA's top honor has eluded him.
   The award is among a dozen to be announced tonight at the Grand
Ole Opry House during the 24th annual CMA awards show broadcast
live by CBS, starting at 9 p.m. EDT.
   Travis' main competition for entertainer of the year is expected
to be the 1989 winner, George Strait, who latest hit, ``Love
Without End, Amen,'' is one of the biggest of his career.
   Other finalist nominees are Clint Black, Kathy Mattea and Ricky
Van Shelton.
   Travis said if he doesn't win, he won't be disappointed.
   ``I've been fortunate to win what I have,'' he said. ``I've had
plenty. You wouldn't be much of a person if you'd won as much as I
have and then get mad about not winning again.''
   Travis has more than 40 country music awards and was voted CMA's
male vocalist of the year in 1987 and 1988. He won Grammy awards in
1988 and 1989.
   If he isn't chosen top entertainer, he won't be the only country
music superstar without the honor. Kenny Rogers has never won it
either.
   Surprisingly, Travis was not voted a finalist this year for male
vocalist of the year. Those are Black, Garth Brooks, Rodney
Crowell, Shelton and Strait. Shelton won a year ago.
   Finalists for No. 1 female vocalist are Patty Loveless, Mattea,
Reba McEntire, Lorrie Morgan and Tanya Tucker. Mattea is the
reigning singer.
   Finalists for top album are Alan Jackson for ``Here in the Real
World,'' the late Keith Whitley for ``I Wonder Do You Think of
Me,'' Strait for ``Livin' It Up,'' the Kentucky HeadHunters for
``Pickin' on Nashville'' and Shelton for ``RVS III.''
   For single of the year, finalists are Jackson for ``Here in the
Real World,'' Brooks for ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' Black for
``Killin' Time,'' Vince Gill for ``When I Call Your Name'' and
Mattea for ``Where've You Been.''
   McEntire and Travis will be co-hosts of the nationally televised
show.
