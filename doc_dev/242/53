   Because it's a cartoon, ``The Simpsons'' is
not allowed to compete for an Emmy in the category of outstanding
comedy series.
   But Nancy Cartwright can be nominated for lead actress in a
comedy series for providing the voice of animated Bart Simpson.
   How can a female be nominated for playing an imaginary boy?
   This is television. Anything is possible, if you understand the
rules of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.
   Actress Dana Delany of ``China Beach'' and actor Louis Gossett
Jr. will help announce this year's primetime Emmy nominees during a
news conference Thursday morning.
   Because ``The Simpsons'' is animated, it must compete in the
category of ``outstanding animated program of one hour or less,''
said John Leverence, the academy's award director.
   There are no categories for actors and actresses who provide the
voices for animated primetime shows, Leverence said.
   As a result, Julie Kavner, whose gravelly voice doubles as mom
Marge Simpson, could be nominated for outstanding lead actress in a
comedy series, as could Cartwright. Daniel Castellaneta, the
grumbling voice of baldheaded dad Homer Simpson, could be nominated
as lead actor in a comedy series.
   The phenomenally successful Simpsons are likely to be part of a
Fox Broadcasting Co. nomination list that could also include ``In
Living Color,'' a black, saucier version of ``Saturday Night Live''
that has received rave reviews.
   The now-retired ``Tracey Ullman Show,'' which won Fox its first
Emmy, may also be on the list for outstanding variety series.
   In the category of outstanding comedy series, Emmy favorites are
``Cheers'' and ``The Golden Girls'' on NBC, ``The Wonder Years'' on
ABC, and ``Murphy Brown'' and ``Designing Women'' on CBS.
   Roseanne Barr and her top-rated ABC comedy series ``Roseanne''
will likely be snubbed again this year, the actress and network
sources said.
   Cult hit ``Twin Peaks'' on ABC is favored for a nomination for
best drama series. Past ABC Emmy winners ``China Beach'' and
``thirtysomething,'' as well as ``In the Heat of the Night'' on
NBC, also are favored.
   ``Twin Peaks'' lead actors Kyle MacLachlan and Michael Ontkean,
as coffee- and pie-loving law enforcement officers, may get
nominated, as may female stars Piper Laurie, Peggy Lipton and Joan
Chen.
   Emmy winner Patricia Wettig's portrayal of a young mother
suffering from ovarian cancer on ``thirtysomething'' may nab her
another nomination. Delany of ``China Beach,'' who won last year
for outstanding lead actress in a drama series, also could get
another nod this year.
   In the movies and miniseries categories, favorite choices are
``Small Sacrifices'' starring Farrah Fawcett on ABC, ``The Kennedys
of Massachusetts'' on ABC, ``Murder in Mississippi'' on NBC and
``Phantom of the Opera'' on NBC.
   The NBC movie about the murders of three young civil rights'
workers in Mississippi also could get nominations for stars Blair
Underwood and Tom Hulce.
   The winners will be selected Aug. 26-27 by panels of directors,
actors and writers who vote only in their professional categories.
   The 42nd annual primetime Emmy awards ceremony will be broadcast
live on Fox on Sunday, Sept. 16.
