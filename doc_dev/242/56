   Marla Maples upstaged the president of the
United States, the city's notorious mayor and one pretty well-known
comedian just by, well, just by being Marla Maples.
   The so-called other woman in the Trump marital split was the
talk of the White House Correspondents Association dinner Saturday,
getting most of the attention from 2,500 of the capital's movers
and shakers and the reporters who write about them.
   She had two burly bodyguards to keep the paparazzi and curious
from pressing too close. But ``Saturday Night Live'' comedian
Dennis Miller tossed a few barbs her way.
   Miller said he had flown ``in this afternoon on the Trump
Shuttle, or as it's been affectionately renamed `The Ugly American
Airline.'''
   ``Marla, kidding. Kidding, Marla,'' he said. ``I love him, too.''
   Even Barbara Bush told reporters Sunday that her one
disappointment at the dinner was that she failed to catch a glimpse
of the face that has graced a thousand tabloids.
   Ms. Maples, a guest of Time magazine, was following in the
footsteps of Fawn Hall and Donna Rice, who turned heads at past
dinners.
   Miller also poked fun at another prominent guest.
   ``I understand Mayor Marion Barry is here tonight. Had a wacky
couple of months there, didn't you, Marion? Woooow! Well, you talk
about a liberal,'' he said of Barry, soon to face trial on cocaine
charges.
   President Bush did his own stand-up comedy turn, using his press
secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, as the foil.
   ``We originally wanted to launch the Hubble Telescope a year ago
to take a group shot of Marlin,'' said Bush of his spokesman, who
recently went on a drastic diet to reduce his girth.
   Bush, often the butt of jokes on NBC's late-night comedy show,
said Dana Carvey's impression of him on ``Saturday Night Live'' is
``so good that I asked him to phone Rafsanjani and tell him that it
was George Bush. But Dana said, `Wouldn't be prudent, wouldn't be
prudent.'''
