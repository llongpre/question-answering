   Al Franken was trailing the candidates with a
satellite dish on his head; Dana Carvey and Kevin Nealon were
Austrian weightlifters Hans and Franz _ ``We want to pomp you op!''
Dan Aykroyd made a surprise appearance as Bob Dole.
   NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' had just hit stride last spring
when the Writers Guild strike brought everything to a halt.
   Executive producer Lorne Michaels hopes to get back on track
soon _ the show begins its 14th season Saturday _ but laments
missing seven shows that would have culminated in a nostalgic
season-ender with Gilda Radner and Bob Dylan.
   ``If there had been a strike in 1985, I wouldn't have minded it
so much,'' said Michaels in an interview in his NBC office. ``But
we were in such good rhythm. Our ratings were going up every week.
... I just thought we were doing very good work. It was an election
year, the writing was there, the cast was there.''
   Michaels launched the show in 1975, and with it the careers of
Radner, Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Jane Curtin and Bill
Murray. Michaels left in 1980 to produce movies, but returned in
1985. A rushed-together cast spent an unhappy season under
crushingly negative reviews.
   In 1986, the show rebounded with a new cast that has remained
intact for three seasons. This group seems to have shaken off the
ghosts of the now-fabled originals.
   Aykroyd played Dole off Nora Dunn's edge-of-hysteria takeoff on
Congresswoman Pat Schroeder. Dana Carvey did a brilliant Robin
Williams opposite Williams himself, as his own father. Phil
Hartman, who can do everybody from Jimmy Swaggart to Phil Donahue,
perfected Barbara Bush.
   Michaels said he had felt out of touch with the late-night
audience when he came back in 1985 and unwisely heeded advice to
target the show to some nebulous notion of a new and younger
audience.
   ``And so you start putting on stuff you don't think is funny or
that you're not comfortable with or a musical group that happens to
be hot at that moment, booking from the charts instead of from your
tastes,'' he said. ``And it's disorienting, because if you fail
that way, as I did, you go, well, where's the satisfaction? There's
no satisfaction. So after that season, I went back to, I'm going to
put on the things that I think are good and hopefully I'm not that
out of step.''
   Michaels, 43, now oversees a staff of writers who in some cases
were in junior high school when SNL premiered.
   ``You know, there's a certain point where you're sitting in a
room, and it's 2 o'clock in the morning, and you're saying, `I
don't think it will work,' words that as you hear them coming out
of your head, you realize these people, and sometimes those people
are 25 or 26, and they're looking at you, and you think, `They're
thinking, he's old and annoying.' And you know that you think it
won't work because you wrote it three times, you produced it eight
times, and it didn't work any of the 11 times. They're thinking,
`He just doesn't get it.'''
   Michaels produced the Emmy Awards show for Fox this summer,
livening up the proceedings and keeping the show mercifully short.
He says it's an experience he feels he needs only only once in his
life, though.
   Now, besides shepherding SNL, he is helping launch two new shows:
   _``Sunday Night,'' a variety show that premiered on NBC last
Sunday, will feature an eclectic assemblage of musical guests.
David Sanborn and Jools Holland are co-hosts. Comedian Kevin Meany
is a regular.
   _``Kids in the Hall,'' an HBO series featuring a young comedy
troupe from Michaels' home town of Toronto.
   ``There is a time in people's careers which is more interesting
for me to be working with them ... to watch people come into their
own and just blossom,'' Michaels said.
   Earlier in the day, at an NBC press conference about the new
season of ``Saturday Night Live,'' Michaels was asked what was new
to say after 14 years.
   ``Our show is one that will always be described as uneven, and I
think there's a point in the development of a cast when they sort
of hit stride. Our cast, before we were taken off the air (by the
strike) had hit stride.
   ``I think this season will be a great season,'' he said. ``And I
haven't said that the last three years.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   THE GREEK ON COSTAS _ Jimmy ``the Greek'' Snyder will be on
``Later With Bob Costas'' Monday, his first major network interview
since he was dropped by CBS Sports because of his comments linking
blacks' athletic prowess to slavery. The show will be taped Monday,
the first day back in the studio for Costas since the Seoul
Olympics.
