COVER STORY: VIEWERS CAN SAY SO LONG TO TV'S SUMMER DOLDRUMS 
</P>

It wasn't long ago that summer brought the dog days of television. Viewers were 
bombarded with repeat after repeat of their favorite -- and less than favorite 
-- series and were force-fed an array of unsold TV series pilots and inane 
comedy-variety shows. 
</P>
<P>
But TV's summer doldrums are over. Or at least tempered, thanks to the savvy 
programming of cable, PBS and the fourth network, Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Cable has chosen the summer to offer new series, specials, documentaries and 
feature films. PBS' summer schedule is its most ambitious to date and Fox hopes 
to increase its ever-growing audience with new programming. 
</P>
<P>
And what about the Big Three networks? Though viewers will be seeing a handful 
of new limited series, ABC, CBS and NBC mostly will serve up their traditional 
summer menu of reruns. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a selective guide to what's new and interesting on TV this summer.

After airing discarded pilots for the past few seasons, the third-place network 
is set to premiere three new limited series. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Tortorici, CBS' senior vice president of program planning, explained why 
networks can't rely only on reruns for the summer: 
</P>
<P>
"The successful shows repeat very well in the summer," he said. "But the issue 
is, when you have marginal performers -- or shows that are not even marginal, 
but failed -- you are going to have extremely low audience numbers. I can't 
imagine any of us want to see our circulation levels go to that kind of low, 
especially in light of the competition from cable, from videocassettes and, 
most specifically, the Fox network."

"The summertime has been traditionally the time to build and expand our 
audience," said Paul Stupin, executive vice president of series programming. 
"It's something we initially took advantage of and (it) worked well for us last 
year when we launched 'Totally Hidden Video.' This summer we will continue to 
look toward expanding our audience base."

"We have a lot of new stuff this summer," said Barry Chase, vice president of 
programming. "We have a lot of important new stuff which is typical of what we 
have been doing the last few years. There are plenty of people around during 
the summer to watch TV, and we had some slightly offbeat things like 'Alive 
From Off Center' and 'P.O.V.,' which we thought might appeal to people who are 
looking around in the summer. It was a perfect time to introduce them. The 
alternative stuff has always been our bread and butter."
