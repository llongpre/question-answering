   Rodney Crowell, Ricky Van Shelton and
Hank Williams Jr. were chosen Thursday as finalists for four honors
each in the 23rd annual Country Music Association awards.
   The late Keith Whitley was selected as a finalist for three
awards, along with newcomer Clint Black, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,
George Strait and Randy Travis.
   Williams, the CMA's entertainer of the year in 1987 and 1988, is
a finalist for that honor again. He is joined by Reba McEntire,
Shelton, Strait and Travis.
   Winners will be announced Oct. 9 during a nationally televised
show at the Grand Ole Opry House.
   Some of the top names in country music failed to make the
finalists, including Willie Nelson, Kenny Rogers, K.T. Oslin, the
Oak Ridge Boys, Ricky Skaggs and Barbara Mandrell. Oslin was voted
female vocalist of the year in 1988.
   Finalists for top male vocalist are Crowell, Shelton, Strait,
Travis and Whitley. Competing for No. 1 female vocalist will be
Rosanne Cash, Patty Loveless, Kathy Mattea, McEntire and Tanya
Tucker.
   Williams, son of a country music legend, completed his
nominations in the category of music video of the year for ``There's
a Tear in My Beer'' and two nominations in vocal event of the year,
one with Johnny Cash and the other with his late father. The vocal
event of the year is a collaboration by performers who are not
normally partners.
   ``I'm excited about getting nominated with daddy,'' Williams said
after the finalists were announced. Williams, using recording
technology, sang with his father on ``There's a Tear in My Beer.''
   Shelton, a former pipe fitter, rounded out his nominations in the
top album category for ``Loving Proof'' and in the single of the
year category for ``I'll Leave This World Loving You.''
   Crowell, the husband of Rosanne Cash and son-in-law of country
music ``Man in Black'' Johnny Cash, also was a finalist in three
categories based on his self-penned hit record ``After All This
Time.'' They are single of the year, No. 1 music video and song of
the year. The single of the year is an award for a performer and
song of the year is an award for a songwriter.
   ``My main motivating factor is to do good work and cultivate an
attitude so my work evolves to a better place,'' Crowell said by
telephone from Los Angeles after learning of the nominations.
   Whitley, who died of an accidental overdose of liquor May 9, also
was voted a finalist for the Horizon Award for career development
and single of the year for ``I'm No Stranger to the Rain.''
   Completing the finalists for single of the year were ``A Better
Man'' by Black and ``Chiseled in Stone'' by Vern Gosdin.
   Other finalists for No. 1 album were ``Beyond the Blue Neon'' by
Strait, ``Old 8x10'' by Travis, ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken Vol.
11'' by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and ``Willow in the Wind'' by
Mattea.
   The mother-daughter duo the Judds, voted either duo or group of
the year for four straight years, were a finalist for top duo again.
But they were not voted a finalist for entertainer of the year, the
top honor and an award they have never won.
   Winners and finalists are chosen by the 5,469 voting members of
the association.
