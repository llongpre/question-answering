   Soft-spoken gentleman cowboy Randy
Travis won the most trophies but the Academy of Country Music voted
once again the heartland's rowdy leader of song, Hank Williams Jr.,
its favorite entertainer.
   It was the second consecutive Entertainer of the Year trophy for
the man nicknamed Bocephus, the 38-year-old son of country music
great Hank Williams.
   ``This is what my momma wanted all the time. ... She would be so
proud and, of course, my daddy, I know he'd be proud,'' Williams
said after taking the top honor Monday night at Knott's Berry Farm
   The 23rd annual awards presentation was televised nationally by
NBC.
   Travis, 28, won three awards: top male singer, song and single
of the year for his hit, ``Forever and Ever, Amen.''
   ``It's still a big thing to keep winning. It makes me quite
nervous. It doesn't feel any different than it did the first
time,'' said Travis, who last year won four awards on the strength
of the song ``On The Other Hand.''
   Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt won the album
trophy for ``Trio.'' The mother-daughter duo The Judds took the
duet trophy. Los Angeles-based Highway 101 was best group, and Reba
McEntire won top female vocalist for the fourth time.
   ``It's like they're saying `Reb, you still got it,' and that's
nice,'' Miss McEntire said.
   Ricky Van Shelton won for new male vocalist.
   K.T. Oslin was the new female vocalist and won the video honor
for ``80's Ladies.''
   ``It's better than wonderful. It's marvelous,'' Van Shelton
said. ``It means you've finally arrived. It means you're there.''
   Roger Miller received the non-competitive Pioneer Award.
   Highway 101's group award marked the second consecutive loss in
that category for perennial favorite Alabama, although Highway
member Cactus Moser didn't think the awards should be considered a
horse race.
   ``I don't feel like we beat them,'' Moser said. ``It's wonderful
to be recognized.''
   Williams and Travis faced off in Entertainer of the Year,
vocalist, single, song, album and video categories.
   ``It's a great feeling but it comes with a lot of work,''
Williams said of his victory.
   Nominees were picked by the 2,500-member Academy of Country
Music and they voted by mail-in ballot.
   Drummer Archie Francis won his 11th academy trophy and fiddler
Johnny Gimble and steel guitarist J.D. Maness each won their 10th
awards to lead winners in instrumental categories.
   Bass player Emory Gordy Jr., guitarist Chet Atkins and
keyboardist John Hobbs won their second-consecutive academy
trophies.
   David Hungate tied Gordy in the bass category, Ronnie Milsap
tied Hobbs in the keyboard category, and Ricky Skaggs, who plays
the mandolin, tied with Jerry Douglas, who plays the dobro, in the
specialty instrument category.
   The Strangers won their eighth touring band trophy and Nashville
Now won the non-touring band award.
   Jim Tabor of radio WMC in Memphis, Tenn., was selected disc
jockey of the year, his first academy win, and KNIX radio in
Phoenix, Ariz., was picked the top radio station for the second
consecutive year.
   The Crazyhorse Steakhouse &amp; Saloon in Santa Ana, Calif., won the
nightclub of the year honor for the second consecutive year.
