   Hank Williams Jr., country music's rowdy
outlaw, and gentle ex-frycook and Grammy nominee Randy Travis swept
today's Academy of Country Music nominations.
   Williams, last year's ACM Entertainer of the Year, and Travis,
who swept the awards show in 1987 with four trophies, will face
each other in Entertainer of the Year, top male vocalist, single
song, album and video categories.
   The surprise was the poor showing of the multiple Grammy nominee
``Trio'' album, which got the Academy's best album nomination but
no other mention for singers Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and
Emmylou Harris.
   Williams led with six nominations. Travis had five and gentleman
cowboy George Strait had four, including top male vocalist, single,
song and album nominations.
   Other multiple nominees included perennial favorite Alabama and
newcomers K.T. Oslin and Ricky Van Shelton with three each, and the
Bellamy Brothers, Crystal Gayle, The Judds, Reba McEntire and
Restless Heart with two apiece.
   The nominees were announced during a news conference at the
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Ballots go into the mail to about 2,500
Academy members this week, and finalists will be announced during a
nationally televised two-hour NBC-TV special March 21 from Knott's
Berry Farm in Buena Park.
   The show will be hosted by Williams and Miss McEntire.
   In addition to Williams and Travis in the Entertainer of the
Year category are Alabama, Miss McEntire and Willie Nelson.
   In the male vocalist category, Williams, Travis and Strait are
joined by Ronnie Milsap and Steve Wariner.
   Female vocalist contenders include Rosanne Cash, Miss Gayle,
Miss McEntire, Tanya Tucker and Kathy Mattea.
   Miss Gayle is also in the top vocal duet category with Gary
Morris. Other contenders are Foster &amp; Lloyd, Sweethearts of the
Rodeo, the Bellamy Brothers and The Judds.
   The top vocal group category includes Alabama, Exile, Highway
101, Restless Heart and The Oakridge Boys.
   Williams' ``Born To Boogie'' LP got him nominations for best
single, song and album of the year. Travis' ``Forever and Ever,
Amen'' got nods for best single and song and his LP ``Always and
Forever'' got him an album of the year nomination.
   Also in the top album category is ``Heart Land'' by The Judds
and ``Oceanfront Property'' by Strait.
   Other top single contenders are Strait's ``All My Ex's Live in
Texas,'' Restless Heart's ``I'll Still Be Loving You,'' and Van
Shelton's ``Somebody Lied.''
   Other best song nominees are Miss Oslin's ``80's Ladies'' and
Van Shelton's ``Somebody Lied.''
   In the best new artist category, female contenders include Miss
Oslin, Nanci Griffith, Libby Hurley, K.D. Lang and Dana McVicker.
Male nominees are Van Shelton, Larry Boone, Marty Haggard, Lyle
Lovett, and Jo-El Sonnier.
   In the video category, which is voted by the Academy's board of
directors, contenders include Miss Oslin's ``80's Ladies,'' Travis'
``Forever and Ever, Amen,'' Williams' ``My Name Is Bo Cephus,'' the
Bellamy Brothers' ``Santa Fe,'' Dwight Yoakam's ``Little Sister''
and Alabama's ``Tartop.''
