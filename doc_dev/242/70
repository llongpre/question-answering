ATTEMPTS by Brazil's former President Fernando Collor to recover his rights
to stand as a candidate in next year's elections are being thwarted by a
flood of fortune-seeking books by his vengeful younger brother and former
aides about the torrid world of drugs, adultery and black magic that
allegedly marked his presidency.
With the Supreme Court due to decide within two weeks whether to proceed
with criminal charges against the former president, removed in impeachment
proceedings over corruption charges, Mr Collor's last shreds of honour are
being stripped away by the revelations now rocking Brazil in the latest
episode in the Cain and Abel saga between the two Collor brothers.
Mr Collor has pleaded for people to ignore the damning extracts being
published in the Jornal do Brasil from a book by his brother Pedro whose
denunciations last year led to the president's downfall.
A handwritten letter from Mr Collor to the media accused his brother of
being 'sick in body and soul,' adding: 'Isn't it enough that they have taken
away my political rights, my happiness, my peace. . . for the love of God,
stop this]'
There is very little that Pedro does not accuse his brother of in his book
which he says 'will make the whole world question how such a person could
become president of Brazil.' In the first two extracts alone he claims that
while in office the president and his wife Rosane were cheating on each
other - both with men - and that Rosane blackmailed Mr Collor by threatening
to reveal his alleged cocaine addiction and wife-battering tendencies.
Pedro goes on to detail black magic sessions by the first couple and
Rosane's mother in which they jabbed pins into models of their enemies.
Pedro also claims the presidential couple sacrificed goats and chickens and
danced round them in daily ceremonies to try to ward off impeachment.
Pedro's book is not the only one doing the rounds. In 'A Thousand Days of
Solitude' by Mr Claudio Humberto, Mr Collor's loyal ex-spokesman, Pedro is
the mentally imbalanced villain who shoots at the refrigerator when he
cannot find the cheese.
Although Pedro is not regarded as the most credible source, any hope of Mr
Collor's imminent return to public life is likely to be dashed by the
revelations which have led news items throughout Latin America.
