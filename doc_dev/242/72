   Newcomer Garth Brooks led the finalists
for the 1990 County Music Associatian awards with five nominations
on Thursday. He says it's more than just a dream come true _ he
gets to rent a tuxedo.
   ``This is like getting five invitations to a dance and not
knowing if you'll get to dance or who with,'' Brooks said in
Springfield, Ill., where he was performing.
   Brooks, who's been recording for only a year and was boosted by
his touching song ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' outdid established
stars like Randy Travis, Hank Williams Jr. and the group Alabama in
nominations for country music's top awards.
   ``It's an award enough to be touring and fulfilling my dream,
but this is great,'' said the 27-year-old
singer-songwriter-guitarist. ``Plus I get to rent a tux.''
   The association announced its finalists Thursday; the winners
will be announced during a nationally televised show Oct. 8.
   Brooks was nominated for male vocalist of the year, single and
song of the year for ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' music video of
the year for ``The Dance'' and the Horizon Award for career
development.
   Brooks, whose songs deal with love and the value of romance and
affectionate communication, has had a quick career rise after just
three years in Nashville.
   ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' ``The Dance'' and ``I'm Much Too
Young (to Feel This Damn Old)'' have all been No. 1 country music
records during the past year.
   He briefly ran a boot store here before breaking into the music
business. Prior to arriving in the country music capital, Brooks
was a student at Oklahoma State University, where he was a javelin
thrower for the school track team.
   For the top CMA award, entertainer of the year, the finalists
are Clint Black, Kathy Mattea, Ricky Van Shelton, 1989 winner
George Strait and Travis.
   Travis, who has dominated country music awards for the past five
years, failed to win a nomination as top male vocalist. Those went
to Brooks, Black, Rodney Crowell, 1989 winner Shelton and Strait.
   The finalists for top female vocalist are Patty Loveless, 1989
winner Mattea, Reba McEntire, Lorrie Morgan and Tanya Tucker.
   The finalists and winners are chosen by the 6,000 singers,
musicians, songwriters and others who are CMA members.
   The other finalists for single of the year are ``Here in the
Real World'' by Alan Jackson, ``Killin' Time'' by Black, ``When I
Call Your Name'' by Vince Gill and ``Where've You Been'' by Mattea.
   The finalists for No. 1 album are ``Here in the Real World'' by
Jackson, ``I Wonder Do You Think of Me'' by the late Keith Whitley,
``Livin' It Up'' by Strait, ``Pickin' on Nashville'' by the
Kentucky HeadHunters and ``RVS III'' by Shelton.
   The song of the year finalists, besides Brooks, are ``Here in
the Real World'' by Jackson and Mark Irwin, ``Killin' Time'' by
Black and Hayden Nicholas, ``When I Call Your Name'' by Gill and
Tim DuBois and ``Where've You Been'' by Jon Vezner (Mattea's
husband) and Don Henry. This category is for songwriters.
   For vocal duo of the year, the finalists are Baillie &amp; the Boys,
the Bellamy Brothers, Foster &amp; Lloyd, five-time winners the Judds
and Sweethearts of the Rodeo.
   Country music superstars Alabama, Dolly Parton and Hank Williams
Jr. failed to receive nominations.
