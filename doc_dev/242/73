   Rowdy country singer Hank Williams
Jr. and his late father shared top Academy of Country Music Award
nominations Tuesday with the 40-year-old weepy saloon duet
``There's a Tear in My Beer.''
   Williams got six nominations, including entertainer of the year,
and the Grammy-winning song collaboration led to five nominations
for his father.
   ``The ones for daddy are particularly important. I want to see
daddy shine after these 37 years,'' Williams said from Paris, Tenn.
   ``I just wish daddy could be there to enjoy it all,'' he added.
``But I feel deep in my heart that daddy's watching somewhere.''
   Clint Black also got six nominations, including best album and
song for ``Killin' Time,'' and five went to Grammy-winning singer
Rodney Crowell for ``After All This Time.''
   Crowell joins Hank Williams Jr., Randy Travis, George Strait,
Dolly Parton and Alabama in the top entertainer category.
   Multiple nominees for ``Hat'' trophies included Alabama, Travis
and Miss Parton with three apiece. Strait, Kathy Mattea, Reba
McEntire, Garth Brooks and the group Shenandoah each had two.
   The 25th edition of the academy's two-hour awards show take
place April 25 in Hollywood and will be televised by NBC-TV.
   Nominations in 12 categories were announced by members of the
band Highway 101, nominated for top vocal group, and Buck Owens,
nominated for the duet ``Act Naturally'' with Ringo Starr.
   ``I feel great. How else could a person feel? It's a sunny day,
we find out we're nominated, it's wonderful,'' said Paulette
Carlson of Highway 101.
   In addition to the top entertainer nomination, Williams was
picked for the duet with his late father ``There's a Tear in My
Beer,'' which also was nominated for top song, record and video.
   Trophies are given to the artist and composer in the song
category and the artist and producer in the record, video and album
categories.
   ``There's a Tear in my Beer'' was on a Hank Williams Sr. demo
tape found in the attic of songwriter ``Big Bill'' Lister. The
elder Williams died in 1953, but modern technology allowed the
addition of his son to the song and video.
   Several nominees won big during last week's Grammy Awards show:
``There's a Tear in My Beer'' was best country vocal collaboration,
Crowell's ``After All This Time'' was country song and k.d. lang
was female country singer for ``Absolute Torch and Twang.''
   The academy's 2,500 members vote for the winners except for the
video award, which is decided by a vote of the academy's Board of
Directors.
