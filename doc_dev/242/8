   Singer Randy Travis is expected to win
at least two big honors at tonight's Country Music Association
awards, but the group Alabama, which has dominated such presentions
this decade, is up in only one category.
   Travis, a former short-order cook and dishwasher, is given a
strong chance to win entertainer of the year and to repeat as No. 1
male vocalist at tonight's nationally televised presentations.
   He is also among five finalists for single of the year and song
of the year, both for his self-penned ``I Told You So.'' The single
of the year is awarded to the singer and song of the year goes to
the writer.
   Reba McEntire, who has been voted female vocalist of the year
for an unprecedented four straight years, has strong competition
this year in a category rated a tossup. The other finalists are
Rosanne Cash, Kathy Mattea, K.T. Oslin and Tanya Tucker.
   The awards show, with Dolly Parton as host, will be broadcast
live by CBS, 9-11 p.m. EDT, from the Grand Ole Opry House. The
Mutual Broadcasting System will carry a stereo radio simulcast. CTV
will carry the show live in Canada.
   The band Alabama is a finalist in only one category _ vocal
group of the year.
   Joining Travis as finalists for entertainer of the year, the top
award, are the Judds, McEntire, George Strait and 1987 winner Hank
Williams Jr.
   Vern Gosdin, Ricky Van Shelton, Strait and Williams are
competing with Travis for top male vocalist.
   Travis, 29, has sold 3 million copies of his album ``Always and
Forever.'' Earlier this year, he won a Grammy Award for the single
``Always and Forever'' and three awards from the Academy of Country
Music.
   In addition to being named top male vocalist last year, the CMA
honored him with album of the year and single of the year for
``Always and Forever.''
   All five finalists for female vocalist of the year have a
legitimate claim for the award.
   Cash, daughter of country star Johnny Cash, has a string of No.
1 records. Mattea had one of the top hits of the year, ``Eighteen
Wheels and a Dozen Roses.'' Oslin has already won a Grammy Award
for her ``80's Ladies.'' Tucker, who will celebrate her 30th
birthday Monday, is a 17-year veteran who has never won a CMA award.
   The Judds, a mother-daughter duet, won three straight CMA awards
as vocal group of the year until a rule change moved them into the
vocal duo category this year.
   Winners and finalists are picked by the approximately 7,000
singers, songwriters, musicians, disc jockeys and others in country
music.
   The show, which normally commands strong television ratings, has
been lengthened by 30 minutes this year.
