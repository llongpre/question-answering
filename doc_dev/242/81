   Altovise Davis, widow of Sammy Davis Jr.,
says there is no truth to rumors circulating in Hollywood that the
entertainer died a pauper.
   British and American tabloids have said Mrs. Davis and her
14-year-old son, Manny, were to be evicted from their home by the
Internal Revenue Service.
   ``If you were to believe the alternative press, the IRS is
sweeping down on her (and) Altovise is emotionally very
disturbed,'' her lawyer, Visilios Choulos, said at a news
conference Tuesday. ``All of those things are totally untrue.''
   Mrs. Davis did not attend the news conference.
   Choulos estimated the Davis estate, consisting of a mansion,
antique guns, books and jewelry, is worth $6 million to $8 million.
David died of throat cancer May 16.

   Oscar-winning actress Diane Keaton will debut
as a prime-time TV director in an episode of ABC's ``China Beach.''
   The network Tuesday said Keaton will oversee an installment
about the return home from Vietnam of nurse Colleen McMurphy, the
show's lead character. Keaton will report to the set for eight days
of work on Sept. 5.
   In the episode, McMurphy, played by Emmy-winning actress Dana
Delany, comes home to Kansas after the war and grapples with
civilian life and a drinking problem.
   Keaton's directing credits include the feature film ``Heaven''
in 1987, a music video and a CBS Schoolbreak Special.
   The actress, who has appeared in a number of Woody Allen films
as well as ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar'' and ``The Godfather,'' won
the Academy Award for best actress in 1977 for Allen's ``Annie
Hall.'' Her newest film, ``The Lemon Sisters,'' opens Friday.

   Fans at a Toto concert over the weekend
were infuriated when they discovered the band was not the
Grammy-winning group whose hits included ``Rosanna'' and ``Africa.''
   Singer Bobby Kimball, who left the group in 1984, and a few
other musicians performed at The Starry Night club, said Ellen
Lynch, a spokeswoman for Toto's management company.
   Toto currently features guitarist Steve Lukather, brothers Jeff
and Steve Porcaro and David Paich. All are original members.
   Lynch said Monday that Kimball has used the band's name before.
   ``We've gotten reports all over the country, from Florida and
now the Northwest and Europe,'' Lynch said. ``As far as I know, he
doesn't own any rights to the name. It's now become a huge legal
matter.''
   Kimball's whereabouts were not immediately known.
   Club owner Larry Hurwitz said he will offer refunds or tickets
for another show to those at Saturday's performance.
   ``I feel like I was slightly deceived by Kimball and his
manager,'' Hurwitz said. ``We had 900-plus people and within the
first three songs we had 100 people leave.''

   Prince's new movie, ``Graffiti
Bridge,'' opens at theaters Nov. 9, less than one year after
production began.
   ``We did the film as quickly as we did because there was the
need for a story on faith in these troubled times,'' Prince
publicist Jill Willis quoted the rock star as saying.
   Filming took place in 36 days and was completed two days ahead
of schedule, she said. The musical's soundtrack was released last
week.
   Prince recently completed the European leg of a tour and is
headed for Japan.

the 1960s.
   He returned to Chile in 1986 after living for two decades in
