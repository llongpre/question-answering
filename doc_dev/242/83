   Hank Williams Jr., still reigning as
Nashville's top entertainer, celebrated twin honors from the
Country Music Association with word that he'll release as a duet a
newfound recording made by his legendary father.
   Through modern technology, Williams, 39, will be able to join
his late dad on the recording, to be released in February. The
song, ``There's a Tear in My Beer,'' was cut by Williams Sr. in
1952, less than a year before he died.
   ``It's an absolute treasure,'' Williams said Monday night. ``I
get chills playing it.''
   Vocals by the younger Williams will be added to the original
track.
   Hank Williams Sr. was a country music pioneer with hits like
``Your Cheatin' Heart'' and ``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.''
   ``I hope in my best day I can sing as good as he did,'' Williams
said as the Country Music Association gave him its vote of
confidence at the 22nd awards Monday night.
   Williams was named entertainer of the year for the second time
in a row and also won the trophy for best album, ``Born to Boogie.''
   The only other double winner was K.T. Oslin, who was voted
female vocalist of the year and won best song for her poignant
``80's Ladies.''
   Williams explained that he tries to reach the common man with
his turbocharged blend of country, rock 'n' roll and blues.
   ``I try to sing my songs for everyday folks and it all worked
out,'' he said. ``I try to tear 'em up before I get off the stage.''
   Oslin has been singing country music professionally for just two
years after minor roles on Broadway and making television
commercials for items such as denture products.
   ``I have electric light switches where I used to have chains,''
she said about the change in her life since 1986.
   She said the two awards will mean ``more bucks, honey, more
bucks.''
   Randy Travis, whose album ``Always &amp; Forever'' has sold 3
million copies, was voted male vocalist of the year for the second
straight time.
   His award met with the approval of Roy Acuff, the 85-year-old
``king of country music,'' who was wearing a jacket backstage that
said ``Randy Travis, Back to Country'' on it.
   The Judds, a mother-daughter duet, were voted No. 1 duo after
winning group of the year three straight years. They were placed in
the duo category this year under a rules change.
   Kathy Mattea's ``18 Wheels and a Dozen Roses'' was voted No. 1
single record. The four-piece vocal band Highway 101 won their
first CMA award, group of the year.
   Ricky Van Shelton won the Horizon Award for a promising newcomer
and veteran guitarist Chet Atkins was voted No. 1 instrumentalist
for the ninth time. The vocal event, a new award given to two or
more singers who do not normally perform together, went to Dolly
Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris for their ``Trio'' album.
   Country queen Loretta Lynn and cowboy singer Roy Rogers were
voted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.
