   Gilda Radner, a star in the early ``Saturday
Night Live'' comedy show who died at age 42 after a lengthy battle
with cancer, talked about confronting ``the Big C'' in her
forthcoming autobiography.
   ``I got a little cocky,'' she writes in ``It's Always
Something,'' due out in June. ``I always had a twinkle in my eye as
though I'd touched the face of God ... I was plenty full of myself.
   ``What I've learned the hard way is that there's always
something you can do. In some cases, death seems more desirable.
But there is always something you can do.''
   The creator of such memorable television characters as New
York-street smart reporter Roseanne Roseannadana, speech-impeded
talk show host Baba Wawa and out-of-sync editorialist Emily Litella
died of ovarian cancer Saturday with husband Gene Wilder at her
side.
   Miss Radner, who was diagnosed with the cancer in 1986, died in
her sleep at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said hospital spokesman
Ron Wise.
   She had radiation therapy and other treatments, including
surgery, as recently as February. She re-entered the hospital
Wednesday, Wise said.
   The comedian told a Life magazine interviewer in 1988 that
``cancer is about the most unfunny thing in the world.''
   In her book, Miss Radner writes that she did not see cancer in a
humorous light at all times, but there were moments.
   ``The next thing you know, I'm kind of running down the street
with my arms spread out in this raincoat yelling in a Captain
Midnight voice, `Cancer Woman,' look at her go!''
   In recent years Miss Radner appeared in several movies, but was
best known for roles in sketches on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live,''
with such stars as Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin, Laraine
Newman, Garrett Morris, Bill Murray and the late John Belushi.
   The show brought her an Emmy Award for outstanding performance
by an actress in a variety series.
   On Saturday's show, host Steve Martin _ visibly choked with
emotion _introduced a 1978 clip in which he and Miss Radner did a
comic dance. ``You know, when I look at that tape I can't help but
think how great she was and how young I look,'' Martin said.
``Gilda, we miss you.''
   ``I loved her like a sister,'' Aykroyd said through a
spokeswoman. ``My thoughts are with Gene and her family.''
   Miss Radner had a ``very natural effervescence that seemed to
come out of her during those five years,'' Morris said. ``It was
just an electric thing that would even help you get through a
performance if you were down.''
   A Detroit native, Miss Radner attended the University of
Michigan and began her entertainment career in the Toronto Company
of ``Godspell,'' then became a member of the ``Second City''
improvisational group.
   She was chosen for the original cast of ``Saturday Night Live''
in 1975, and stayed with the show until 1980.
   She met Wilder in 1981 on the set of the movie ``Hanky Panky''
and the romance blossomed three years later while making ``The
Woman in Red,'' which was written and directed by Wilder.
   A return to television as a special guest on ``It's Garry
Shandling's Show'' earned her an Emmy nomination for comedy
performance in 1988.
