<LEADPARA>  WHILE Rosanne Cash was talking about songs recently with her husband, fellow
performer and songwriter Rodney Crowell, the conversation turned to one of
Cash's new compositions.;    "It's kinda surfacey," she says. "It's not really
scuba diving as deep as I want to go. I was telling him that I think I should
toss it.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Then Rodney started singing 'I Want to Hold Your Hand.' He was trying to
remind me they don't all have to be that deep.";    For the oldest child of
Johnny Cash, that's easier for others to say. "I want my songs to take the big
plunge," she says. "I want them to be of big import.";    That plunge is not
always into comfortable places. Cash has written about marital woes, narcotic
addictions and spousal abuse. She writes fearlessly about fear and
acknowledges her insecurities without trying to dismiss her vulnerability. Her
latest album, 1990's "Interiors," digs into the dark, dirty side of
relationships with no care about where the mud flies.;    Most valuable
artist;  It's not pretty, but you can bet it has import. Though her output is
erratic -- three years passed between "Interiors" and her previous album,
"King's Record Shop" -- Cash remains one of America's most compelling
songwriters, country or rock. Rolling Stone dubbed her "perhaps the most
valuable country artist of her time -- and also one of the sharpest and most
courageous singer-songwriters in popular music." The Village Voice noted that
"she's the only woman who's managed to stay on the rockin' rebel country
bus.";    The latter description doesn't imply that Cash, 36, courts praise by
swigging whiskey, firing a six-shooter and yelling yee-ha! This particular
rebel corps -- which includes Crowell, Steve Earle, John Hiatt, Guy Clark and
Lyle Lovett -- blends its country orientations with blues and rock, creating
distinctive sounds that fall between the genre cracks.;    Cash does that
musically, but lyrically she mines even deeper than her contemporaries. "A
long, dark tunnel" was how she described her songwriting during concerts
earlier this year, and Cash's songs indeed travel a hellish labyrinth of
emotions. "If you don't want to face the truth," she sings on "Interiors,"
"You're not gonna like what I do.";    From Cash's pen, relationships become a
"Land of Nightmares" -- "I love you till I just can't feel/I need you till it
makes me numb/We hang on a noose/Of subtle abuse" -- and the process of
resolution is no rosier. In the "Interiors" opener, "On the Inside," she sings
"We crawled night and day though the tears and debris/Now I'm reaching out to
you but I'm keeping my hands clean." Later, she cries "What are you thinking
tonight?/I don't know you/My words disappear in the night/And there's no one
there to notice.";    Always real;  Hope is a rare commodity here, but her
songs display an abundance of determination. She declares she wants to be a
"Real Woman," "changing every day . . . real in every way." And at the end of
"Interiors," after trudging through all that pain, she offers a quiet
celebration: "I've lifted the veil, I've walked through the fire/I'll move
on/I'll go higher.";    "It is autobiographical," she says, acknowledging that
she and Crowell have separated after 12 years of marriage. Cash moved from
Nashville to Connecticut with the couple's four girls -- three from their
marriage and one from Crowell's previous marriage.;    "But (the songs) aren't
just about me. I think everybody reaches those points in their relationships
-- where you feel like you don't know the other person, where things feel like
they're coming undone but you don't know what to do about it. If people listen
to my songs and the only thing they hear is me singing about my problems,
they're missing something.";    It's not hard to figure where Cash gets her
perspective. She was born in Memphis, Tenn., shortly before Johnny Cash's "Hey
Porter" transformed him from appliance salesman to singing star. For 11 years,
Cash saw her father only the handful of days he wasn't on the road, and she
watched him become addicted to amphetamines. When she was 11, her parents
divorced.;    "The way I saw it," she says, "success ruins marriages and tears
people apart. I didn't want that.";    Hooked by the Beatles, however, Cash
pursued music, singing backup for her father after she graduated from high
school. She also began writing songs, traveled to England and returned to the
United States to study English and acting in Nashville, Tenn., and Los
Angeles. She recorded her first album for Germany's Ariola Records, and in
1979 she signed with Columbia Records -- her father's label -- and met Crowell
during the recording of her first album, "Right or Wrong.";    Over the years
she's had hit singles and Grammy Awards, as well as a cocaine addiction that
drove her into therapy and resulted in a cleaned-up Cash and the dark 1985
album "Rhythm and Romance." "King's Record Shop," with a dominance of cover
songs, became her commercial zenith, launching four No. 1 country hits.;   
Because of her background, Cash remains suspect of success. "I have regular
crises," she says with a laugh, and she often turns to Crowell or her music
publisher for pep talks. "I guess if you're really blase and confident about
it all, it might get a little hollow.";    Beyond music;  She also has
pursuits beyond music. Cash paints, plays racquetball and is writing a book of
prose to be published by Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich. And though "Twin
Flames," a prospective joint project with Crowell, has been shelved, this fall
the estranged couple will headline a country benefit tour for Amnesty
International.;    But mostly you'll find Cash writing songs, battling her
"periods of really deep insecurity" to produce music that exorcises personal
demons in a manner that may give her listeners new insights.;    "(The songs)
change as you change," she says. "It may take months or years before I get the
full implication of what I've said to myself. It's all about respecting your
subjects, respecting your songs, approaching them with respect, a kind of
genuine openness," she says. "The idea is to be taught rather than to teach."  </TEXT>
