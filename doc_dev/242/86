   Comedian Gilda Radner, who created Roseanne
Roseannadanna, Emily Litella and a brace of other goofy characters
as part of the original cast of ``Saturday Night Live,'' died early
today of cancer, a hospital official said. She was 42.
   Miss Radner, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer about 2{
years ago, died in her sleep about 6:20 a.m. at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise. Her husband of
five years, actor-filmmaker Gene Wilder, was at her side.
   On ``Saturday Night Live,'' which premiered on NBC in 1975, Miss
Radner gave life to such characters as the scatterbrained
broadcaster Ms. Roseannadanna, whose catch phrase, ``It's always
something,'' became the title of a book she wrote detailing her
fight with cancer.
   ``I loved her like a sister,'' grieving fellow ``Saturday
Night'' star Dan Aykroyd said in comments relayed by spokeswoman
Susan Patricola. ``My thoughts are with Gene and her family.''
   Besides the nasal-voiced TV news commentator, she also created
the Baba Wawa character, a spoof of news interviewer Barbara
Walters, as well as the nerdy teen-ager Lisa Lubner and the dowdy
Ms. Litella, who delivered misguided opinion pieces on such things
as ``violins on television,'' backing off a sweet ``Never
mi-i-i-i-ind'' when her error was pointed out.
   Miss Radner was rewarded with an Emmy Award for outstanding
performance by an actress in a variety series.
   Born in Detroit, Miss Radner began her professional career in
the Toronto Company of ``Godspell,'' then became a member of the
Toronto company of ``Second City,'' the improvisational group that
also gave Aykroyd his start.
   She was a writer and performer for the New York-based ``National
Lampoon Radio Hour'' and its stage counterpart, the ``National
Lampoon Show,'' in the early 1970s and in 1975 was selected for the
original cast of ``Saturday Night Live.''
   While working on ``Saturday Night Live,'' she also showed her
comic abilities on Broadway in 1979 with ``Gilda Live.'' It was
later produced as a movie and then an album, ``Live From New York
Gilda Radner.''
   After ``Saturday Night Live'' she appeared in several films,
including ``First Family,'' ``The Woman in Red,'' a 1984 hit
written and directed by her co-star, Wilder; as well as ``Haunted
Honeymoon,'' ``Hanky Panky'' and ``It Came From Hollywood.''
   She also starred in the Broadway play ``Lunch Hour'' with Sam
Waterson, in 1980.
   As an author she wrote a book of humor, ``Roseanne
Roseannadana's `Hey, Get Back to Work' Book.'' An autobiographical
account of her battle with cancer, ``It's Always Something,'' was
due to be published next month.
   Miss Radner entered Cedars-Sinai on Wednesday, hospital
spokesman Wise said.
   She had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1986 and underwent
nine months of chemotherapy. She also had radiation therapy and
other treatments, including surgery as recently as February.
   The treatments sent the disease into temporary remission and the
comedian told a Life magazine interviewer in 1988 that ``cancer is
about the most unfunny thing in the world. But it doesn't mean you
have to die.''
   ``In fact,'' she told the magazine with a defiant edge to her
voice, ``I think I've never been as healthy and as well as I am
now.''
   Wise said funeral services will be private.
