Los Angeles-based rock veterans Don Henley, Tom Petty, Bonnie Raitt and the 
Traveling Wilburys will compete with English soul band the Fine Young Cannibals 
in the album of the year category in the 32nd annual Grammy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
The nominations were announced Thursday at a Beverly Hills press conference. 
Winners will be named in nationally televised ceremonies from the Shrine 
Auditorium on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The album field consists of ex-Eagle Henley's sardonic "The End of the 
Innocence," rocker Petty's darkly humorous "Full Moon Fever," blueswoman 
Raitt's reflective "Nick of Time," the informal "supergroup" the Traveling 
Wilburys' good-natured "Volume One" and the Cannibals' soul-flavored "The Raw 
&amp; the Cooked." 
</P>
<P>
Henley, with his album's title track, and the Cannibals, with "She Drives Me 
Crazy," were also named in the record of the year category, along with Billy 
Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire" Mike + the Mechanics' "The Living Years" and 
Bette Midler's "Wind Beneath My Wings." 
</P>
<P>
Henley's "Innocence" was also named in the song and male rock vocal categories, 
giving him four nominations. Other artists with four nominations are Petty, 
Prince, Raitt, Dave Grusin and Mike + the Mechanics' Mike Rutherford. Triple 
nominees are five-time winner Joel, Fine Young Cannibals, Midler, Soul II Soul, 
Janet Jackson, Bruce Hornsby, Aretha Franklin, Miles Davis, BeBe Winans and 
James Levine. 
</P>
<P>
While nominations in the two top categories generally followed industry 
predictions, there were some surprising absences, most notably Richard Marx, 
whose "Repeat Offender" album was one of 1989's biggest sellers and featured 
many mainstream textures often favored by Grammy voters. Others who had been 
widely touted for either album or single nominations included the Rolling 
Stones, Janet Jackson, Neneh Cherry and Paula Abdul. 
</P>
<P>
The balloting is conducted among the 6,000 members of the National Academy of 
Recording Arts and Sciences. The eligibility period for the 32nd annual 
competition ran from Oct. 1, 1988 to Sept. 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The competitors for best song (a songwriter's award) are Henley and Bruce 
Hornsby ("The End of the Innocence"), Rutherford and Brian Robertson ("The 
Living Years"), Joel ("We Didn't Start the Fire"), Larry Henley and Jeff Silbar 
("Wind Beneath My Wings") and the trio of Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil and Tom Snow 
("Don't Know Much"). 
</P>
<P>
Competing against Soul II Soul (which had two other nominations) in the 
new-artist category are Neneh Cherry, Indigo Girls, Milli Vanilli and Tone Loc. 
</P>
<P>
In other key categories, Joel and Prince are up against Michael Bolton, Richard 
Marx and Roy Orbison for male pop vocal, while Raitt and Midler will be 
challenged by Linda Ronstadt, Gloria Estefan and Paula Abdul for female pop 
vocal honors. 
</P>
<P>
The finalists in the female rock vocal competition, along with Raitt, are 
Melissa Etheridge, Tina Turner, Cyndi Lauper and Pat Benatar. Vying with Henley 
for the male rock vocal award are Petty, Neil Young, Lou Reed and Joe Cocker. 
</P>
<P>
In the rock group vocal category, U2 is nominated twice -- for the album 
"Rattle and Hum" and for the single "When Love Comes to Town," a collaboration 
with B. B. King. The group's challengers are the Rolling Stones, the Traveling 
Wilburys and Living Colour. 
</P>
<P>
The female R&amp;B vocal nominees are Vanessa Williams, Anita Baker, Natalie 
Cole, Janet Jackson and Aretha Franklin, while the contenders for the R&amp;B 
male vocal award are Prince, Bobby Brown, Al Jarreau, Luther Vandross and 
Smokey Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
The finalists for best rap performance are Young MC, Public Enemy, Tone Loc, D. 
J. Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince and De La Soul. 
</P>
<P>
In country, k.d. lang and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band both received two 
nominations, lang for best country vocal and as co-writer of "Luck in My Eyes," 
and Dirt Band for best group vocal and vocal collaboration. Lang's competitors 
for female country vocal honors are Emmylou Harris, Rosanne Cash, Dolly Parton 
and Kathy Mattea. The challengers for the male country vocal award are Rodney 
Crowell, Keith Whitley, Randy Travis, Clint Black and Lyle Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
Trumpeter Miles Davis is the leading nominee in jazz genre with three -- for 
jazz fusion, solo jazz and big-band jazz performances. In the solo jazz 
category, he'll be vying with Andre Previn, John Patitucci, Wynton Marsalis and 
Chick Corea. For the jazz group instrumental award, it's brother against 
brother -- Wynton vs. Branford Marsalis. Previn, for his "After Hours" album 
was also nominated in this category, along with the Yellowjackets and the Chick 
Corea Akoustic Band. 
</P>
<P>
Both repertory and performers in the classical album category are more offbeat 
than usual, though sentimental voting might favor a valedictory award to 
Herbert von Karajan and the Vienna Symphony for their Bruckner Eighth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
The nominees also include the Gerard Schwarz/Seattle Symphony disc of Howard 
Hanson symphonies and the Emerson Quartet's Bartok set (both up in two other 
categories as well), and the Christoph von Dohnanyi/Garrick Ohlsson/Cleveland 
Orchestra version of Busoni's Piano Concerto and the James Levine/Metropolitan 
Opera recording of "Die Walkure," each with one other nomination. 
</P>
<P>
The Robert Shaw Grammy machine in Atlanta has a recording of Britten's "War 
Requiem" on the ticket in two categories.
