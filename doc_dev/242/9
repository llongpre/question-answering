   Former pipe fitter Ricky Van Shelton won
four honors and Randy Travis was chosen entertainer of the year
Monday night at the 23rd annual Music City News Country Awards.
   President Bush, appearing on videotape, joined in saluting
veteran entertainer Johnny Cash, who was selected by country music
fans for the Living Legend Award.
   ``Your songs have helped reawaken patriotism in America,'' the
president said during the live telecast to a syndicated audience.
``In every sense of the word, you are a true living legend.''
   Cash, who spoke by satellite from Hawaii, said, ``It's a very
humbling experience to receive an award like this.''
   Shelton was chosen top male vocalist over competitors Vern
Gosdin, George Strait, Dwight Yoakam, Hank Williams Jr. and Travis.
He also won single of the year and favorite music video, both for
``I'll Leave This World Loving You,'' and best album for ``Loving
Proof.''
   ``I'm very honored by all the people who voted for me and who
love country music,'' Shelton said in accepting his award as best
male singer.
   Shelton worked as a pipe fitter for 10 years before leaving the
mountains around Grit, Va., in 1984 to pursue his musical dreams.
Wearing a trademark white cowboy hat, he began visiting Nashville
nightclubs to meet people in the music business and, during a
performance one night, was spotted by a CBS Records executive who
signed him to a recording contract.
   Travis had won nothing until the final category of the evening
was announced at the Grand Ole Opry House. He won over fellow
nominees Reba McEntire, Shelton, Strait, Williams and the Statler
Brothers.
   ``I was beginning to get worried,'' Travis said. ``I try my best
to represent country music in a good way.''
   For the fifth straight time, Miss McEntire was voted female
vocalist of the year over nominees Rosanne Cash, Kathy Mattea, K.T.
Oslin and Tanya Tucker.
   ``If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times; no one is
as lucky as country music performers to have country music fans,''
she said.
   Patty Loveless was voted star of tomorrow, outpolling three
others, including the late Keith Whitley. In her acceptance
remarks, she paid tribute to Whitley, who died of an alcohol
overdose May 9.
   ``Keith Whitley lives on with his music as far as I'm
concerned,'' she said.
   The Statler Brothers were voted group of the year for the sixth
straight time, raising their total number of awards in that
category to 39.
   Other winners were: Ray Stevens, comedian of the year; Ricky
Skaggs instrumentalist of the year; the Judds, vocal duo of the
year; the Whites, gospel group of the year; the Nashville Network's
``Nashville Now,'' TV series ``A Country Music Celebration: 30th
Anniversary of the Country Music Association,'' as best TV special;
and Yoakam and Buck Owens, vocal collaboration (two or more
performers).
   Voting on the winners was done by subscribers of Music City
News, a magazine published in Nashville, and the deadline for
receiving the ballots was May 1.
   The awards show, which was hosted by the Mandrell sisters, was
one of many special country music events this week in Nashville for
the 18th annual Fan Fair celebration. Approximately 23,000 country
music fans from around the world attend the festivities and 4,400
turned out for the nationally televised awards show.
