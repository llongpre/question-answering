   ``The Cosby Show'' returned to the top of the
ratings for the first time since February and the Not Yet Ready for
Prime Time Players showed they're ready.
   Viewers proved they're ready for prime time too, as network TV
posted a 10-point audience increase from the previous week. The Big
Three's 72 percent share of the audience was the largest since
February, when CBS aired its acclaimed ``Lonesome Dove'' miniseries
and the competition responded with heavy-duty specials.
   Cosby pushed ABC's ``Roseanne'' to No. 2 in the Nielsen ratings
last week, and comic Jackie Mason's ``Chicken Soup,'' which had
placed No. 2 the previous week behind ``Roseanne,'' fell to 14th
place.
   NBC scored with its ``Saturday Night Live'' 15th anniversary
special. The Sunday night program's Not Yet Ready for Prime Time
Players finished No. 8.
   Overall, NBC continued first in the ratings for the 66th
consecutive week, with an average prime-time rating of 16.7. ABC
finished with a 13.1. CBS, which placed only one show in the top
10, had a 12.9, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Each rating point is the percentage of the nation's estimated
90.4 million homes with television sets.
   New shows featuring television veterans did not grab top spots
with viewers. NBC's ``The Nutt House,'' starring Cloris Leachman
and Harvey Korman and produced by Mel Brooks, checked in at No. 24.
   ``Island Son,'' marking the return of Richard Chamberlain to
series television was in 42nd place for CBS. ``A Peaceable
Kingdom,'' starring onetime bionic woman Lindsay Wagner, was in
65th place for CBS.
   The season premiere of NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' which featured
the return of Lisa Bonet's character, Denise, with a new husband
and child, had a 26.1 rating.
   ``Roseanne'' captured a 24.7 rating. ``Chicken Soup,'' which
follows ``Roseanne'' on ABC's Tuesday night lineup, got an 18.4,
losing 6.3 points from the previous week.
   A special Tuesday night preview of ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,''
producer Steve Bochco's latest entry for ABC, tied with CBS'
``Murder She Wrote'' for sixth place. The show about a teen-age
doctor got a 20.7 rating.
   Doogie didn't do as well in its regular Wednesday night slot,
where it finished in 33rd place with a 14.4 rating.
   Last week's top 10 shows were ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC;
``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Sister
Kate,'' NBC; ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS and ``Doogie Howser, M.D.''
ABC (tie); ``Saturday Night Live 15th Anniversary Show,'' NBC;
``Matlock,'' NBC; and ``Who's the Boss,'' ABC.
   In news, ``CBS Evening News'' finished with an 11.2 rating.
``ABC World News Tonight'' and ``NBC Nightly News'' each had a 10.2
rating. The ABC rating is based on four nights due to satellite
problems Wednesday. Nielsen has told ABC it will revise the numbers
at a later date.
