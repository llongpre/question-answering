<HEADLINE>  TWO AGENCIES REGULATE CELLULAR PHONE SYSTEMS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Action Line  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  A  Both the Federal Communications Commission and California State Public
Utilities Commission regulate cellular phone systems. If the system you have
is a local service with no long distance capabilities, then you should direct
your complaint to the PUC, 505 Van Ness Ave., San Francisco 94102. If the
system has long distance capabilities between states, then your complaint
needs to go the FCC, Common Carrier Bureau, 2025 M St., N.W, Room 6202,
Washington, D.C. 20554.;    Model of satisfaction;  Q  For Christmas, I
purchased the new idea in model car racing -- a GT Super Screamers --
manufactured by Worlds of Wonder Toys. After one hour of activity, the cars
went bonkers. I called the toll-free number for consumer services and received
a return authorization number. I returned the cars Jan. 11 to the Ohio office
and have been waiting ever since. I've made many phone inquiries about the
repair or replacement of the cars and I have not been advised of any progress.
I'm still waiting and screaming for satisfaction.;    -- J.B., Sunnyvale; A 
The entire set was replaced once we contacted the firm, which then advised you
to visit the Worlds of Wonder Teddy Ruxpin Gift Gallery at the company's
Fremont headquarters. We were told you could have done this immediately.
However, you were just following Worlds of Wonder instructions to return the
set to the Ohio office. For others needing repair or replacement of items, the
Gift Gallery is at 4209 Technology Dr., Fremont. The phone number is (415)
659-4300. The gallery is open through May 24 on weekdays from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m.;    Where to write the stars;  Q  I'd like to write some stars. Could you
get me the addresses for Katey Sagal of "Married . . . With Children;" Kirstie
Alley of "Cheers" and Rosanne Barr of "Rosanne?";    -- J. Vortmann,
Cupertino; A  The best place to write series stars is in care of the network.
"Married" is on the Fox Network. That address is Box 900, Beverly Hills 90213.
National Broadcasting Co. carries "Cheers" and you can write Alley there at 30
Rockefeller Plaza, New York 10020. American Broadcasting System carries
"Rosanne," so send the letter to Barr to 1330 Avenue of the Americas, New York
10019. The address for Columbia Broadcasting System is 524 W. 57th St., New
York 10019.;    A winning voice;  Q  I have a $100 bet on this answer. Is
James Earl Jones the person who says, "This is CNN" on the CNN network
identification. I'm sure it is but my boyfriend doesn't think so.;    --
Khanada Azeleia, San Jose; A  You win. The network hired Jones to record the
CNN identification about a year ago, says a CNN spokeswoman.;    Sound Off: No
love;  T  his is directed to the lady driving the Mazda MPV on Leigh Avenue on
Monday, April 29 at 5:15 p.m. Not only did you let your daughter climb around
the front seat and out of the seat belt, you let her grab the door handle from
an open window. You were also driving like an idiot.;    -- Dennis Johnson,
