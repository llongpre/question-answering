   Tracey Ullman dubbed it ``the hippest Emmys,''
and, oh, was it. Next year they'll probably just call it, ``So It's
the Emmy Awards _ See If We Care.''
   But this was, in fact, the 40th Annual Emmy Awards, so it was
kind of two-faced, alternately glib and cynical, then mushily
nostalgic over clips of Ozzie and Harriet, Jimmy Durante, Jack
Benny and Rochester, Lucille Ball and Jackie Gleason, among dozens
of others, flickering reminders of the days when we weren't so hip.
   This year's executive producer, Lorne Michaels of ``Saturday
Night Live,'' gamely attempted to salvage the event from tedium and
for the most part succeeded. It was 40 minutes shorter and
infinitely more entertaining than the rambling four hours last year.
   Instead of the embarrassingly bad musical number that has opened
awards shows past, Sunday night's show opened with a musical number
that was bad on purpose _ Jan Hooks and Nora Dunn doing their
wonderfully lame lounge act, the Sweeney Sisters from ``Saturday
Night Live.'' During a bad medley of TV theme songs, they roamed
the audience, gaping at the celebrities who squirmed and simpered
uncomfortably.
   Michaels' thinly veiled homage to his own show _ the band was,
of course, led by SNL's G.E. Smith _ occasionally rivaled even the
Fox Broadcasting Co.'s level of self-promotion. This is the second
year Fox has carried the Emmys.
   In between plugging their Fox shows, co-presenters Ullman and
Garry Shandling discussed the Emmys.
   ``This is the hippest Emmys I've ever seen,'' Ullman said.
   ``Oh, these are the real Emmys. I thought this was just another
`Saturday Night Live' skit,'' replied Shandling, displaying hipness
squared.
   Some winners even got in on the too-hip act. John Larroquette,
who picked up his fourth Emmy for best supporting actor in ``Night
Court,'' noted wearily, ``Now I am officially overwhelmed.'' He
thanked the academy for its ``generosity and keen eye for talent.''
``A little anti-humility joke,'' he over-explained.
   Michaels dispensed with the co-host concept, instead having
co-presenters engage in dialogues that were sometimes _ gasp _
funny. Kirstie Alley (``Cheers'') enthused over co-presenter John
Lithgow's acting ability, especially his Broadway performance in
``M. Butterfly.'' Lithgow replied in perfect halting perplexity,
``This is very embarrassing Kirstie, but ... I'm not exactly sure
what you do.''
   Robin Williams, not even safe on videotape, paid a hilarious,
crazed, tasteless tribute to cable programming. Cable shows were
eligible for Emmys this year for the first time.
   Tony Danza was the ``designated acceptor,'' a new comic device
that allowed him to pick up Emmys for those who were too hip to
even be at the ceremony. When John Shea won for supporting actor in
``Baby M,'' Danza rushed up to accept the statuette, gushing, ``I
didn't prepare anything! I didn't think he was going to win!''
Later, after his third or fourth time, Danza noted intelligently,
``This was funny the first couple of times, but I'm outta
material.''
   There were moments immune from sneering. Larry Drake received a
warm ovation when he was named best supporting actor in a drama for
his sensitive portrayal of the retarded office assistant on ``L.A.
Law.''
   There was an ovation for co-presenters Mary Tyler Moore and Dick
Van Dyke, who played Rob and Laura Petrie on ``The Dick Van Dyke
Show'' in the 1960s. Van Dyke nudged Moore into spouting in her
trademark quaver, ``Oh, Rob!''
   Richard Kiley, who won best lead actor in a drama, brought the
proceedings back to reality when he complained about NBC having, in
fact, canceled his critically praised show, ``A Year in the Life.''
   Michaels brought out some unexpected co-presenters, such as
``Head of the Class'' star Robyn Givens and her heavyweight hubby
Mike Tyson, and newsies Sam Donaldson and George F. Will.
   Hip magicians Penn and Teller presented the wrap-up of the 44
technical awards given out Saturday.
   In perhaps a metaphor for the night, Penn Jillette promised to
drop a Maytag washing machine on his partner if the audience paid
attention to the awards.
   Teller escaped unharmed. So did the Emmys.
