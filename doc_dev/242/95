   Life in the 1960s wasn't so wild for Glenn Close,
who spent five years with the well-scrubbed singing group Up With
People, the Silent Majority's answer to the Beatles.
   ``We were supposed to be the other side of Berkeley, you know,
sing some songs and the world will be a better place,'' Close, 42,
said in the September issue of Fame magazine.
   ``It was very idealistic but very controlled, very controlled. I
was absolutely sincere; it was totally naive,'' she said.
   ``I had no emotional or spiritual equipment to know what I was
doing, I was too young.''
   Close, who stars in the upcoming ``Immediate Family'' with James
Woods, said the group enabled her to travel around the world, but
she still feels she missed something in those days.
   ``I never had a '60s rebellion period. I wish that I had,'' she
said.

   Jerry Lewis is using his old movies to
reach a very special member of the younger generation _ this year's
Muscular Dystrophy Association poster child.
   Five-year-old Ashley Antolak, of Athens, met the comedian for the
first time in December in Las Vegas, shortly after being selected to
be the poster child.
   Barbara Harber, Ashley's grandmother, recalled asking Ashley
about Lewis on the girl's return from the trip. ``Granny, he's kinda
funny,'' Ashley said.
   ``Tell it to his banker,'' Mrs. Harber responded with a laugh.
   But Ashley's mother, Donna, said it was clear that Ashley didn't
know exactly who Lewis was. When Lewis found out, he decided to send
Ashley videocassettes of three movies from his cinematic heydey in
the 1960s, ``The Bellboy,'' ``Cinderfella,'' and ``The Nutty
Professor.''
   ``I figured what better way is there to bridge the gap between
our generations than through the universal language of laughter,''
Lewis said.
   So when Ashley was asked about Lewis in a recent interview, she
could say with some authority, ``He's funny.'' But is he as funny in
person as in his movies? ``No, not really,'' she said.

   ABC News' Peter Jennings, who earlier this year
earned best television anchor accolades, dropped out of high school
in the 10th grade and says that until recently he would avoid
talking about his lack of a formal education.
   In the September issue of Esquire magazine, Jennings says he read
nothing but comic books as a child and that he was an impetuous,
cocky boy used to getting his own way.
   He said he regrets not having studied literature or economics. He
said his spelling is poor and he's unfamiliar with grammar rules.
   He says when pressed on the subject of his education, he would
say he attended Carleton University in Ottawa. The truth is he
attended Carleton's night school for all of a week.
   When he sees his remarks quoted in newspapers and magazines, he
said he tells himself, ``There goes a product of no education.''
   Jennings was literally born into broadcasting. His father was the
first radio news broadcaster in Canada and later became general
supervisor of programming for the Canadian Broadcasting Company.
   Voted best news anchor by the Washington Journalism Review,
Jennings said his motivation is still largely personal.
   ``I think I still _ to a great measure _ want to impress my
father,'' he said.

   Rodney Crowell, nominated last week for
four Country Music Association awards, says he won't ``count any
chickens'' before they hatch, but he thinks he deserves an award.
   Crowell is one of the leading nominees for the Oct. 9 ceremony
along with Ricky Van Shelton and Hank Williams Jr.
   ``I don't believe in false modesty,'' Crowell told The Nashville
Banner Thursday in an interview from Los Angeles. ``I definitely
thought I was deserving. Had I not been acknowledged, I would have
probably been disappointed and bitter.''
   Crowell, husband of Rosanne Cash, was nominated for best male
vocalist, best song for the hit ``After All This Time,'' best single
and best video.

   Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, two of the most
highly praised of Britain's new generation of actors, are no longer
just co-stars. They're man and wife.
   They were married Sunday at Cliveden, a historic stately home 25
miles west of London. The half-hour service included readings from
Samuel Pepys and William Shakespeare.
   ``It was very nerve-wracking and was much worse than being on
stage _ but much more fun,'' said Branagh, who wore a suit of navy
blue linen.
   The couple met when they starred in the British Broadcasting
Corp. TV series ``Fortunes of War.''
   Branagh, 28, and Miss Thompson, 30, are starring in the current
London revival of John Osborne's play ``Look Back in Anger.'' They
will have to be back on stage today.

   Stan Brakhage, one of the most
influential filmmakers of America's avant-garde cinema, is this
year's recipient of the prestigious Edward MacDowell Medal.
   It was the first time in 30 years the medal has been given to a
filmmaker.
   Brakhage was cited for ``lifelong commitment to producing
inventive films that go beyond conventional devices of plot and
character.''
   Brakhage uses intense imagery, light and color, and fast-paced
rhythm and montage techniques. He has made more than 200 films,
ranging in length from nine seconds to four hours.
   The MacDowell Medal, named after the American composer, is
awarded to a writer, composer or visual artist for outstanding
contributions to American culture. The award is presented by the
MacDowell Colony, which was founded in 1907 and is the oldest
artist's colony in the country.
