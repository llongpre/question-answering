JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
<P>
1. Los Lobos, "The Neighborhood" (Slash). The seemingly simple songs here may 
not make much of an initial splash, but they are like depth charges, resonating 
with life's sorrows and joys when they do sink in, with some great barbecue 
stomps thrown in to boot. A plain masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
2. The Neville Brothers, "Brother's Keeper" (A&amp;M). Forget the car 
commercials, the Nevilles are the heartbeat of America, and perhaps its 
conscience as well, with songs here that look head on at the '90s and at the 
honesty and love it's going to take to survive them. 
</P>
<P>
3. Robert Johnson, "The Complete Recordings" (Columbia). Recorded in a '30s 
hotel room on primitive equipment, bluesman Johnson's legacy carries on into 
the CD age as some of the most naked, human and scarifying music extant. One of 
the treasures of American culture done justice in this 2-CD box set. 
</P>
<P>
4. Chris Gaffney, "Chris Gaffney and the Cold Hard Facts" (ROM). Costa Mesan 
Gaffney may not have a hellhound on his trail, but there's at least an evil 
Chihuahua dogging his heels. The singer-accordionist is a killer songwriter, 
and he brings a powerful sense of mood to both riotous tales of cantina mishaps 
and heartaching ballads of sundered love and fear-locked neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
5. The James Harman Band, "Strictly Live . . . in '85" (Rivera). Other than the 
studio-sounding vocals and harmonica calling this album's title into question, 
"Strictly Live . . . in '85" gives a fair glimpse of what made the old Harman 
lineup -- with guitar wonders Kid Ramos and the late Hollywood Fats -- one of 
the most exciting bands on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
6. Desert Rose Band, "Pages of Life" (Curb/MCA). There's scarcely a hair out of 
place in this highly polished set from Chris Hillman and Co., but the passion 
still comes through in questing songs, rich vocal harmonies and shimmering 
guitar interplay. 
</P>
<P>
7. Jonathan Richman, "Jonathan Goes Country" (Rounder). The wedding of the 
ever-elfin Mr. Richman and a country studio band isn't entirely made in heaven, 
but some of his best songs are here, including a comical romp through Reno and 
a beautiful cover of Marty Robbins' "Man Walks Among Us." 
</P>
<P>
8. The Geto Boys, "The Geto Boys" (Def Jam). Sure, these guys are as 
reprehensible, violent and sexist as anything you'll find on TV, but they're 
also furious and funny, and they pump the most demanding rhythms to come out of 
Houston since Archie Bell and the Drells. The last rap group you'll ever need. 
</P>
<P>
9. Texas Tornados, "Texas Tornados" (Warner Bros). These guys are the real 
Wilburys. Lone Star perennials Doug Sahm, Flaco Jimenez, Freddie Fender and 
Augie Meyers join up to churn out a true, dirt-under-the-fingernails, 
dance-hall celebration. 
</P>
<P>
10. Youssou N'Dour, "Set" (Virgin). Senegalese singer-bandleader N'Dour 
achieves an irresistible blend of African and Western musical influences here, 
with his plaintive vocals soaring above it all.
