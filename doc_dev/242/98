   ``Roseanne'' star Roseanne Barr was named
favorite female performer in a new television series, and the World
War II saga ``War and Rememberance'' won best miniseries in the 15th
annual People's Choice awards Sunday night.
   ``I'd like to accept this award on behalf of all the working moms
and housewives,'' said Ms. Barr, whose ABC-TV situation comedy
chronicles the life of a blue-collar mother.
   The comedian received more votes than ``Murphy Brown'' star
Candice Bergen or ``China Beach'' actress Dana Delaney in the
nationwide Gallup Organization poll that determined the awards.
   ``War and Rememberance,'' the globe-spanning story of a family
during World War II based on Herman Wouk's novel of the same name,
was picked over ``Favorite Son'' and ``Elvis and Me'' for best
miniseries. The ABC-TV miniseries' disappointing ratings had led to
predictions that the miniseries format might be doomed.
   ```War and Rememberance' was an enormous undertaking and one that
required an almost unbelievable commitment from everyone involved in
the production,'' said miniseries star Robert Mitchum, who accepted
the award from Charlton Heston.
   Ms. Barr, who received her award early in the two-hour nationally
telecast awards ceremony hosted by Michael Landon and Michele Lee,
was also nominated as best female performer with Phylicia Rashad and
Cybill Shepherd.
   ``Roseanne'' joined ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' in the
nominations for best comedy series, while ``Roseanne'' also picked
up a nomination for best new comedy series with ``Murphy Brown'' and
``The Wonder Years.''
   ``The Cosby Show'' also was nominated with ``M-A-S-H'' and ``Star
Trek'' as best all-time television show.
   In addition to Ms. Barr, entertainers racking up multiple
nominations included Tom Selleck, Bill Cosby, Tom Cruise, Bette
Midler and Meryl Streep.
   Cosby was nominated as best male performer along with Selleck and
Michael J. Fox, and best all-around male star with Cruise and
Selleck.
   All-around female star nominations went to Cher, Ms. Midler and
Ms. Streep.
   For motion pictures, ``Rain Man'' was nominated as best drama
with ``Die Hard'' and ``Young Guns,'' and ``Rain Man'' stars Dustin
Hoffman and Cruise shared best dramatic actor nominations with Bruce
Willis.
   Nominated for best comedy films were ``Big,'' ``Coming to
America,'' and ``Twins,'' and best comedy actor nominations went to
Danny DeVito, Tom Hanks and Eddie Murphy.
   Jamie Lee Curtis, Ms. Midler and Priscilla Presley were nominated
for best comedy actresses, while best dramatic actress nominations
went to Glenn Close, Ms. Streep and Sigourney Weaver.
   Nominated for best all-time movie were ``E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Gone With The Wind'' and ``The Sound Of
Music.''
   Michael Jackson, George Michael and Randy Travis got nominations
for best male musical performer, and Whitney Houston, Reba McEntire
and Barbra Streisand captured nominations for best female musical
performer.
   Best music video nominations were given to Bobby McFerrin's
``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' Michael Jackson's ``Smooth Criminal,''
and Tone Loc's ``Wild Thing.'
