   The Postal Service will experiment with bar
codes on Christmas cards sent by 1,900 Ohio customers to speed up
delivery of the holiday mail.
   The volunteers will share their card mailing lists with the
Postal Service, which will create bar code labels for the envelopes
that can be read by sorting equipment.
   The experiment will involve postal customers in Akron, Canton,
Kent, Ravenna, Wadsworth and Medina.
   Postal officials hope the bar labels will help move holiday mail
faster. Mail with bar labels is sorted by automatic equipment,
rather than by hand.
   The Postal Service expects to use bar codes on 100,000 pieces of
holiday mail this year. The Akron-Canton area alone handles 7
million Christmas cards each season.
   Lou Eberhardt, a spokesman for the Postal Service in Washington,
said concerns over postal customers sharing their private mailing
lists was a concern, but officials decided privacy would not be
jeopardized.
