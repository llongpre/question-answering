   You live in Florida and have been sending your
tax returns to Atlanta for years when, for no reason, you're
supposed to file to Fresno, Calif. Why?
   The answer is that somebody goofed. Maybe 566,000 times.
   About one in 200 of the 107 million tax-form packages mailed by
the IRS last month contained return envelopes with the wrong
address, IRS spokesman Steve Pyrek said Tuesday. ``For example, a
taxpayer in Maryland, who normally would file to Philadelphia,
might receive a package with an envelope carrying a Cincinnati
address,'' Pyrek explained.
   The potential problem affects tax-form kits identified with a
``Package 1'' notation on the bottom right corner of the cover. The
packages contain the basic long Form 1040 plus Schedules A, for
deductions, and B, for interest and dividends.
   The folks at the IRS are red-faced but say there is no reason
for panic. ``This shouldn't present a problem for the IRS or for
taxpayers,'' Pyrek said.
   The IRS has service centers in 10 cities. Page 5 of the package
tells you where your return is supposed to be filed. If that
address does not match the one on your envelope, Pyrek said, you
may:
   _Use another envelope, writing in the address for your service
center.
   _Use the IRS envelope but mark out the wrong address and the
Postal Service bar code and write in the proper address.
   _Use the IRS envelope just as it came to you _ wrong address and
all. Because relatively few envelopes with wrong addresses are
involved, Pyrek said, that will not upset IRS workload schedules
and will not delay processing of the return. More importantly, it
will not delay any refund, he added.
   Pyrek said the problem envelopes have been found in eight of the
10 regions. Only the Ogden, Utah, center, which processes returns
from most of the West, and the Memphis, Tenn., center, which
handles returns from Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North Carolina and Tennessee, have been exempt.
   But that is subject to change. The IRS at first thought only
seven regions were affected, Pyrek said, but ``we just found out
that somebody in Delaware got an envelope with a Fresno address.''
   The problem apparently originated with one of the many private
printers the IRS pays to print and bind tax-return packages. ``We
think there was some kind of problem in the list the printer used
to stuff the envelopes into the packages,'' Pyrek said. ``It's not
clear to us yet.''
   The IRS has heard of no taxpayer receiving the wrong envelope in
the instructions for the simpler basic forms, the 1040A and the
1040EZ.
   But it is a rare year when the agency does not make some kind of
mistake in writing and printing nearly 100 different individual tax
forms and schedules and the dozens of publications that explain
them.
   Already this year the IRS has corrected a goof on Form 2441,
which parents use to claim a credit for child-care expenses.
   The form as mailed to taxpayers included a sentence on line 6
reading: ``If the result here is zero or less, stop here; you
cannot claim the credit.'' That sentence should read: ``If the
result is zero or less, skip lines 7 through 11, enter zero on line
12 and go to line 13.''
