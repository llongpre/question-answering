   WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service expects to trim 47,000
more jobs from its work force by late 1995 as it steps up
automated processing, Postmaster General Anthony Frank said.
   Mr. Frank said such labor-cost savings would help postpone
further rate increases. He said that if the agency is allowed
to put a 30-cent rate into effect for the first ounce of
first-class letters, it hopes to have just one more rate
boost -- in 1995 -- by the end of the 1990s.

   Last year, the service asked to lift the first-class rate
to 30 cents from 25 cents, but the independent Postal Rate
Commission held the rise to 29 cents. The commission also
widened the rate increase for third-class mail 25% from the
17% the service sought.
   The service has asked the commission to reconsider the
case. Postal officials complain that both the smaller
first-class rise and damped advertising-mail volume caused by
the recession and the large third-class increase have hurt
postal revenue. In addition, Congress has forced the agency
to shoulder $4.9 billion more in postal retiree costs, Mr.
Frank said.
   If the commission continues to stick by the 29-cent
first-class rate, the Postal Service board of governors
could, on a unanimous vote, put the 30-cent rate into effect
on its own.
   The 47,000 jobs expected to be trimmed by 1995 would be on
top of 37,000 jobs already eliminated since the agency's
record employment of 787,000 in May 1989, Mr. Frank said. He
added that he hoped the reductions could continue to be made
through attrition, without actual layoffs.
   Mr. Frank said that letter carriers increasingly will feel
the effects of automation that so far have been experienced
mostly by processing clerks. The agency is moving to extend
automation to final sorting of mail for delivery routes. He
said it will take letter carriers substantially less time to
sort mail at the post office and give them more time for
delivery.
   By the end of 1992, about 61% of all cards and letters
handled by the Postal Service will carry bar codes that
signify destinations. The agency's goal is to have all cards
and letters bar-coded by 1995, Mr. Frank said. New automated
equipment reads the bar codes and speedily sorts the mail.
