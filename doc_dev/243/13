   Postal executives this week will be introduced
to a new breed of postal clerk that may never smile, but which also
never frowns or gets cranky or takes a break when there's a line
waiting.
   It's the new face of postal technology _ automated postal clerks
_ and they will begin ``greeting'' the American public later this
summer.
   The clerks, Infopost and Autopost, will be on display at the
U.S. Postal Service's Third Advanced Technology Conference in
Washington this week.
   Infopost, which answers customer questions, already is whirring
away in test form. It will be deployed to post offices in the
Washington area this summer to see how it does in real-life
meetings with the public.
   Autopost, which weighs mail, takes money, makes change and sells
postage, is still being built, although a wooden mockup will be on
display. Field tests of a working model are expected in the fall.
   These are but two of the developments that will be under
discussion at the three-day international conference, where
technical managers will exchange ideas about speeding mail movement.
   Improved mail-handling technology is critical to speeding up
movement of the increasing volume of mail while holding down costs,
explained Kenneth Hunter, senior assistant postmaster general for
management information and research technology.
   Postal officials say the agency needs automation to avoid being
swamped by the 250 billion pieces of mail expected by the year 2000.
   Other developments described by U.S. postal officials at a
preconference briefing last week included machines that can arrange
letters and parcels so the addresses all face the same way, read
ZIP codes and handle a variety of other tasks.
   Teaching machines to read handwriting, for example, is something
technicians have struggled with in hopes of developing equipment to
find and read ZIP codes and then print a bar code on the letter _
like those black lines used on supermarket items.
   With the bar code, already widely used by business mailers,
letters can be sorted more quickly.
   Other items under discussion will include laser equipment to
help sort mail, automatic truck loading equipment and robots to
move mail containers and do other jobs.
   On hand to see the American work and discuss developments in
their own nations will be officials from 16 foreign countries,
including Australia, Canada, West Germany, Britain, Japan, the
Soviet Union, Switzerland and Uruguay.
   While these executives may long for high-speed mail sorters and
cargo handlers, the public face of technology will be embodied in
Infopost and Autopost. People accustomed to automatic banking
machines will likely find the new machinery familiar.
   Infopost offers information on a television-type screen which
the customer touches to enter questions. It can respond either with
an answer or with more questions.
   Asked about rates for overseas mail, for example, the machine
can ask the weight of the item, tell what types of things are
allowed to be mailed to the country in question, and give the rates
and expected delivery time for various mail. It also will print the
information on a slip of paper if asked.
   While Infopost deals with just information, Autopost _ also
using an interactive television screen _ is a mailing station.
   It contains a scale which weighs the item to be mailed and asks
for the destination ZIP code. With that information it outlines
mailing options _ first class, priority mail, Express Mail or
parcel post, for example _ and tells the cost of each option and
how long it is expected to take for delivery.
   The customer can then feed coins, bills or a bank cash card into
the machine, and it will make change and issue a postage-meter-like
strip to be stuck on the letter or parcel. It will also give a
receipt, if asked.
   The item to be mailed can then be dropped into a mailbox.
   While Infopost and Autopost are planned for tryouts in lobbies
of post offices, eventually they could be extended to shopping
malls, supermarkets and other locations, according to postal
managers.
   Each will be connected to a central commuter, which will monitor
the supply of postage and change, and call for a technician if
problems develop. The computer will sound an alert if someone tries
to break into the machines.
   The machines should be able to handle an estimated 68 percent of
post office customer business, the Postal Service estimates,
freeing clerks for more complex transactions.
