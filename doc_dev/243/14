<LEADPARA>  Postmaster General Anthony Frank said Thursday that the Postal Service would
eliminate 47,000 jobs by 1995 through an ambitious automation program, but he
expressed confidence that the reductions could be achieved by attrition.;  
Frank also said that if the first-class letter rate, now 29 cents, is
increased to 30 cents, no further price increases would be needed until 1995.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  POSTAL SERVICE TO CUT 47,000 JOBS
NEW MACHINES WILL SORT MAIL FASTER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "The biggest automation program in history" will be virtually completed by
1995, when almost all mail will be processed with a computerized bar code
marked on the envelope for rapid sorting and easy delivery," Frank said.;  
The Postal Service has eliminated 37,000 jobs in the past two years through a
hiring freeze, and Frank had indicated in private meetings with union
officials that the organization sought further reductions.;   But Thursday's
announcement was the first public disclosure that the Postal Service planned
to wipe out 47,000 more jobs. The new cutbacks, which will reduce the agency's
payroll to 703,000, will have a direct impact on mail carriers for the first
time.;   These workers now spend about four hours in the office sorting mail
and four hours on the streets delivering it. Automation will cut the time in
the office to two hours. The carriers, with six hours on the street, will be
expected to cover longer routes.;   The automation program should not affect
most individuals sending personal letters and cards. There will be no change
in the current five-digit zip code for addresses.;   The Postal Service is
developing machinery that can read handwriting and hopes to have the device
available by 1995. It would scan the handwritten address at the post office,
and then spray on the envelope a bar code -- a series of vertical lines --
translating the address into computerized language for rapid sorting and easy
delivery.;   The job cutbacks will save the Postal Service $4.5 billion a year
in salary and benefits by 1995, Frank said. The savings should keep postage
costs stable, he predicted.;   The current 29-cent rate for a first-class
letter, in effect since February, was adopted by the independent Postal Rate
Commission over the protests of the Postal Service, which had asked for 30
cents. Frank appealed the decision to the commission, but was turned down
once. He is now awaiting the result of a second appeal. If he is turned down
again by the commission, the Postal Service's own board of governors could
adopt the 30-cent rate by a unanimous vote.  </TEXT>
