<LEADPARA>  BAR codes have become ubiquitous on consumer products because they allow quick
pricing information and product identification by machine scanning.;    But
they can be unsightly on packages that emphasize glamour, such as cosmetics,
and can add clutter to advertising messages.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     So the Battelle Memorial Institute, a contract research firm in Columbus,
Ohio, has developed a line of bar code inks that are transparent to visible
light, but visible to the infrared radiation used by the scanning devices.;   
Because they are invisible to the human eye, the new inks can be placed
anywhere on a package without interfering with the package design.;    More
information can be added and the codes could be printed on all sides of a
package, so that the information could be read regardless of the orientation
of the container, speeding customers through supermarket check-out lines.;   
More information also could help stores keep better track of their inventories
and help shippers keep track of their shipments.;    "Several bar codes on a
product could provide an enormous amount of information during the inventory,
manufacturing and shipping processes," says B. Thomas Smith, a Battelle vice
president.  </TEXT>
