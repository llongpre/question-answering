<TEXT>
Bar codes are widely used on items such as food to identify the item. But in
blood transfusion, where large amounts of data need to be carried on the
blood bag, more complex options are being investigated.
The regional transfusion centres in Oxford, UK, and Kassel, Germany, are
looking at a two-dimensional bar code called PDF 417 to identify the donor,
reveal test data and so on. Unlike traditional bar codes where data is held
in the thickness of the stripes and the height of the bar is irrelevant,
PDF417, developed by Symbol Technologies, of Bohemia, New York, and promoted
in the UK by Bar Code Systems, contains a series of codes stacked on top of
each other.
As a result a single code can contain up to 1,750 characters, compared with
13 on a traditional bar code. Symbol Technologies: US, 516 563 2400. Bar
Code Systems: UK, 081 549 0909.
