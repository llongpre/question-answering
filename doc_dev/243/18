<LEADPARA>  Q  A friend was caught shoplifting some lipstick from a department store. Only
one lipstick was taken from a case of about eight, and it was later put back.
Nothing ever left the store, and nothing was damaged. Yet, my friend received
a letter from the store seeking $200 in damages. How was the amount
determined? Believe me, my friend is ashamed, humiliated and full of stress
and has pleaded guilty to the charges in court. My friend also has paid a $115
fine.;    -- M.N., Sunnyvale  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  A  The California Civil Demand Law, Section 490.5 of the state Penal Code,
allows a merchant "injured" by such petty theft to recover the retail value of
the merchandise plus $50 to $500 in damages from an adult shoplifter or a
juvenile's parent or legal guardian in civil court. Many retailers make such a
demand hoping they won't have to resort to court action.; BAR CODES ON
ENVELOPES; Q  On many return envelopes that businesses use (including the
Mercury News), there are two sets of what appear to be bar codes. One is in
the middle top portion of the envelope and has longer lines. The other has
shorter lines and appears on the bottom nearer the right side. Are they bar
codes?;    -- Donna Araiza, Cupertino; A  They are. John Di Peri, manager of
technical sales and services for the United States Postal Service, says the
longer lines on the top of the envelope are the Facing Identification Mark, or
FIM. This code directs different types of business and courtesy reply mail to
appropriate automated equipment so the mail can be processed, says Di Peri.
The code on the bottom is called a "POSTNET" bar code. It represents the ZIP
code on the address so the automated equipment can sort the mail faster.;
SHADES OF ENLIGHTENMENT; Q  I have been told by various people that turning on
a fluorescent light uses as much power as leaving it on for one hour; or
leaving it on for 30 minutes; or leaving it on for 10 minutes. I wrote to
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric to see which is correct. The reply I received stated
that older fluorescent lights used a lot of power when being turned on, but
the newer ones don't, so one should turn the newer ones off if leaving a room
for just a few minutes. The same day I received this response, I saw an
article on energy conservation that said to leave fluorescent lights on unless
you're going to be gone for 30 minutes. OK, what's the correct answer?;    --
C. Gabriel, Cupertino; A  Turning a fluorescent light on uses about as much
energy as leaving that light on for three minutes, says Mary Ellen Ittner,
PG&amp;E spokeswoman. She says this information is based on research conducted at
the University of California, Berkeley's Lawrence Hall of Science. Ittner says
an incandescent light reaches this break-even point in 0.1 seconds. That's why
people are told to turn lights out when leaving a room. "It's a good habit to
get into," Ittner says.; ADDRESSING NANCY REAGAN; Q  Where can I write Nancy
Reagan?;    -- Mae Phillips, Saratoga; A  The address the White House gives
out for the former first lady is Federal Building, 11000 Wilshire Blvd., Los
Angeles 90024.  </TEXT>
