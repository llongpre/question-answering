<LEADPARA>  The U.S. Postal Service has leaped into the era of bar codes, scanners and
automatic sorters, but automation has its price: up to $4 billion in start-up
costs, a continued deficit, put this year at $900 million, and the loss of as
many as 100,000 jobs.;   "Automation is our passport to the future, and in
many respects the future is now," said Anthony M. Frank, the eighth postmaster
general since the service was reorganized in 1971. "In the past three years we
have cemented our commitment to automation; we have developed new technologies
from scratch."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Five-year plan under way; In the mid-1980s, Frank established a five-year
plan, which began in 1990, to automate the Postal Service and increase
efficiency.;   Postal officials say machines are able to sort 10 times faster
than humans, and replacing workers with machines could eventually save money,
perhaps resulting in fewer rate increases. For the workers, the toll is
severe: Officials estimate that 100,000 jobs nationwide will be eliminated by
automation.;   Frank has said he hopes most layoffs can be handled through
attrition, but many analysts say it is unrealistic to expect no layoffs.
Automation comes with built-in costs -- $4 billion to buy equipment such as
bar-code readers, automatic sorters and remote bar-coding equipment.;   Bar
codes are the future; Bar codes, the computer-readable lines on all consumer
products, are the wave of the postal future. Some of the equipment the Postal
Service is buying will read addresses on envelopes and translate them into bar
codes.;   Other machines will read bar codes, sort them and speed mail to its
destination.;   Last year, more than half the letters mailed were handled or
partially handled by machines. This gave the Postal Service a 3.1 percent
increase in productivity.;   Currently, 38 percent of all letter envelopes
carry bar-coded addresses and are sorted by machines. While no legislation is
planned to require bar codes on envelopes, Frank said he hopes rate
incentives, which are yet to be determined, will encourage their use,
especially by businesses.;   By 1995, Frank expects 40 percent of letters will
be bar-coded by customers, many of them businesses, through computer software.
Another 40 percent will be bar-coded by optical scanners in the post offices
and the remaining 20 percent by remote bar-coding systems.;   According to
Frank, labor costs the agency 83 cents of every dollar it spends. In a recent
settlement with the American Postal Workers Union, arbitration increased
workers' wages more than the service wanted for a four-year contract. But
management now has the flexibility in work rules to make the transition to
automation.;   Hiring rules change; They can use more part-time workers and
hire temporary employees from the private sector, while hiring new workers at
10 percent less than the current starting salary.;   William Burrus, the
executive vice president of the American Postal Workers Union, was not pleased
with this development. He called the Postal Service officials "the worst
planners in the world," and said they "don't have any idea how many workers
will be fired as a result of automation.";   Postal officials hope that
attrition and increased volume of mail will prevent layoffs, but there are no
guarantees. Largely because of two recent rate increases, the volume of mail
is lower than they had expected, resulting in a projected deficit of $900
million for this year.  </TEXT>
