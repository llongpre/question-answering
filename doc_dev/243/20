   BETHESDA, Md. -- Martin Marietta Corp. received a $19.9
million contract from the U.S. Postal Service to provide new
bar code readers. The 23-month contract for 812 reading
systems calls for first deliveries in 20 weeks and includes
an option for 300 additional systems.
   The equipment will be capable of reading postal bar codes
anywhere on the surface of large, flat items, such as
oversized envelopes and magazines, the aerospace and
technology company said. Current equipment only reads bar
codes on the front of standard-sized letters.

   The contract, the sixth awarded to the company by the
Postal Service in two years, will be overseen by the
information systems division in Orlando, Fla.
