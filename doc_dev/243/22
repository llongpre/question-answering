  [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- The Beijing Legend 
Computer Group and the U.S. Intermec Corporation, a world leader 
in automated data collection technology, signed an agreement 
here today to jointly develop bar code technology and market it 
in China. 
  The Legend Group is to be responsible for distributing 
Intermec's automated data collection technology and products in 
China. It will also help train personnel for the new 
technology, according to the agreement. 
  Official sources said that more than 75 percent of the 500 
enterprises listed in "FORTUNE" magazine are users of Intermec 
products, which include data collection hardware, software, 
label supplies and services. 
  Speaking at the signing, the Vice-President of the Beijing 
Legend Group, Liu Jinduo, said that his company plays a vital 
role in the domestic micro computers market as well as in 
developing Chinese character processing software. 
  "Our cooperation with Intermec has brought us to the new 
high- tech domain of bar code data collection technology," he 
said. 
  Intermec President Timothy A. Koogle said that his company 
is 
willing to be a firm backer for its Chinese partner. 
  "What is in our mind is to modernize China's manufacturing 
and distributing industries as soon as can be desired and, 
moreover, help China get in line with international practices in 
the circulation area," he said. 
  Bar codes, a new information technology started in the U.S. 
in the 1970s, has been broadly used in computer systems for 
industrial production, commerce, postal service, the management 
of blood banks, libraries, storing, communications and the 
management of commercial bills. 
  Bar code technology was introduced into China in the 1980s. 
By the end of l992, more than 3,000 enterprises applied for bar 
codes and over 40,000 commodities now carry the marks. 
  According to official forecasts, about 8,000 enterprises 
more 
are expected to have bar codes of their own this year and a 
further 100,000 commodities will join the ranks of the code 
carriers.
