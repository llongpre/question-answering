   The Postal Service will seek rate increases that would average 16% for all classes of mail and boost the cost of postage for a first-class letter to 25 cents for the first ounce, officials said. 

   If approved, the increase would take effect in about a year, and postal officials hope to maintain the new rates for about three years. 

   The chairman of the Postal Service Board of Governors, John Griesemer, said the rising cost of postal operations, labor and retirement benefits will require higher rates by mid-1988. 
Under the law, the proposed increase must be reviewed by the independent Postal Rate Commission. 
The commission's lengthy hearing process and further deliberation by the board usually take at least a year. 

   Postal officials estimated that the increase would cost the average consumer less than 20 cents a week, or less than $10 a year. 
The most recent rate increase, raising a first-class stamp to 22 cents, took effect in February 1985. 

   Along with the rate increases, the Postal Service proposes changes in its rate structure that would create a new discount for first-class business mail that is partially sorted by customers using computerized bar-codes. 
And the agency will ask for new services and a less costly rate structure for its overnight Express Mail Service. 

   The rate-increase request comes two weeks after the Postal Service and its unions began negotiations on a three-year contract. 
Postal officials yesterday wouldn't disclose what kind of wage settlement they assumed in preparing the rate-increase request. 

   "This decision is a financial decision, and it won't affect labor negotiations," said Deputy Postmaster General Michael Coughlin. 
He said that while the agency's estimate of its labor costs could, like any other estimate, be off base, the board can delay enactment of a rate increase if it decides the extra revenue isn't needed. 

   Leaders of the two major postal unions, however, attacked the board's decision to seek a specific rate increase at this time as a sign that the Postal Service doesn't intend to bargain in good faith. 

   Moe Biller, president of the American Postal Workers Union, and Vincent Sombrotto, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said the action is an effort to pressure union leaders and lead the public to believe that labor costs are causing postal rate increases. 

   Postmaster General Preston Tisch and other officials maintain that several factors, such as increased costs resulting from a new federal retirement system, make a rate increase inevitable. 
Mr. Tisch has recused himself from discussions on setting rates for the various mail classifications because the CBS Records division of CBS Inc., in which he has an interest, is a large business mailer. 

   Officials said they will formally file their rate request with the Postal Rate Commission this week. 
Under the proposal, the rate for first-class business mail that customers partially sort by applying computerized bar-codes -- a new classification -- will be 20.2 cents an ounce. 
And for mail on which business customers use the nine-digit ZIP code, the rate would rise to 23 cents from the current 21.1 cents. 

   Rates for Express Mail would drop to a range of $7.75 to $70, from the current range of $8.35 to $104.95. 
Officials will also seek to offer volume discounts on Express Mail, an improved pick-up service and a reduced rate for parcels weighing eight ounces or less. 

   The minimum charge for single pieces of third-class advertising mail would increase to 16.5 cents from 12.5 cents. 
The second-class rate, which applies to magazines and newspapers, would increase to 10 cents a pound, from 9.1 cents, for material mailed within the county of publication. 
Second-class rates for materials mailed outside the county of publication would drop to a minimum of 10.3 cents a pound from 11.8 cents currently.
