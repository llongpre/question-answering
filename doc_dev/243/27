   Here's how the electronic data interchange
system at apparel maker Levi Strauss &amp; Co. works:
   _Levi's pre-tickets its jeans and other items with tags
containing bar codes similar to those used in supermarkets.
   _At a retail store, electronic scanners at the checkout record
the information contained on the tags. The store's computer records
the fact that an item has been sold. Using the information, the
computer can automatically reorder goods from Levi's.
   _As orders are shipped by Levi's, the company's distribution
center generates packing slips and sends them electronically to the
store's computer. The store now knows what is coming and when to
expect it.
   _Stores receive pre-ticketed Levi's products in boxes printed
with a bar code on the side. This bar code is cross-referenced to
the electronic packing slip number. When stores scan the bar code
they eliminate the need to count the merchandise by hand, and the
goods can be sent directly to the store shelves.
   _Under an improvement in the system to be introduced soon,
Levi's computers will automatically reorder denim and other
supplies needed to make more jeans to replace those shipped.
