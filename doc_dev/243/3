   Postmaster General Anthony Frank, in a speech to a mailers' convention today, is expected to set a goal of having computer-readable bar codes on all business mail by 1995, holding out discounts and service concessions as incentives. 

   The agency sees widespread use of the codes as a way of handling the rapidly growing mail volume and controlling labor costs. 
Currently, only companies with extremely large mailings apply bar codes themselves and thus help to limit the Postal Service's need for sophisticated machines that "read" typewritten addresses and apply the coding at mail-processing centers. 

   Businesses that apply bar codes to first-class mail currently get a five-cent discount from the regular rate of 25 cents for the first ounce. 
Postal officials said new incentives for businesses will include a range of discounts for all classes of mail, relaxing some sorting rules and improving service. 
Service incentives could mean, for example, guaranteeing shorter delivery times for third-class mail, which is mostly advertising. 
Many of the changes will be subject to approval by the independent Postal Rate Commission. 

   Getting mailers to use the latest technology before giving their mail to the Postal Service "is the only way to achieve the rate stability they want," said Michael Cavanagh, a consultant to major postal customers. 
"Mr. 
Frank will get credit for moving to a logical automation strategy." 

   About 20% of all letter-size mail now carries a bar code, with the Postal Service applying two-thirds of those and businesses applying one-third. 
By next year, the agency expects that 40% of letter mail will have bar codes because several hundred more postal machines that read and apply the code will be in use. 

   If most large mailers begin placing bar codes on their mail, the postal machines, called optical character readers, will be used primarily to handle mail from households and from smaller concerns that aren't likely to apply the codes.
