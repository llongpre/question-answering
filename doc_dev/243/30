   Symbol Technologies Inc., New York, said it received a
Japanese patent on its hand-held laser-scanner technology
after a 10-year wait.
   The Bohemia, N.Y.-based company, a leading maker of
bar-code data capture systems, said at its annual
shareholders meeting that it had applied in Japan for a
patent in 1981, despite the opposition of three major
Japanese companies.

   Symbol, which has been selling bar-code reading devices in
Japan since 1985, in March formed a venture with Tokyo-based
Olympus Optical Co. to sell bar-code scanning products in
Japan. This patent will strengthen the venture, said Paul
Berge, vice president, international marketing.
   The Japanese patent involves the handheld "aim and shoot"
devices, considered the fastest growing segment of the
scanner market. The technology is similar to the scanner that
was at the center of a U.S. patent infringement suit by
Symbol. A federal court judge in New York ruled last year
that Opticon Inc. and its parent, K.K. Opto Electronics of
Japan, infringed on three Symbol patents.
