<HEAD>658 Bags of Fertilizer Damaged in Coupon Caper</HEAD>

   K mart store officials don't know what
to make of hundreds of bags of grass fertilizer that were destroyed
after-hours when rebate coupons and their bar-code labels were cut
off. Nothing else was taken.
   In the past two weeks, three area stores have been hit and 658
bags of fertilizer damaged, The Palm Beach Post reported today.
   ``We came in the next morning, and we just couldn't believe
it,'' said Vance Callahan, manager of a Hollywood K mart, where 150
rebate coupons were cut out May 1.
   ``The fertilizer was all over the place,'' said David Phillips,
manager of a Deerfield Beach store, where the bar codes from 233
bags were cut out Sunday night.
   In the latest incident Tuesday, bar-code labels were ripped off
275 fertilizer bags at a Boca Raton store.
   Managers are baffled over why only the bar-code labels were
taken off some bags and only the rebate coupons _ which can be
redeemed for $3 or $4 _ off other bags. In order for the rebate to
be honored, the coupon must be accompanied by the bar-code label
and a store receipt, Callahan said Thursday.
   There's also another catch. There is a limit on the number of
rebates per household, managers said.
   ``Who knows?'' Phillips said. ``If they're taking this amount of
time and organization ... apparently they've got something that
works.''
