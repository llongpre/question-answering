<LEADPARA>  Let's face it: If you plan to stay in business, sooner or later you'll have to
send bills to customers who owe money and invoices to customers who have paid.
Then there's the sticky matter of envelopes and bar codes, which could save
you money in postage.;    FASTZIP INVOICE/STATEMENT and FASTZIP MAIL -- If you
mail enough statements, FastZip Mail will pay for itself in no time. The
invoice/statement part of this two-disk program also will handle window
envelopes, post cards and labels and print bar codes. Your local post office
can bring you up to date on how much you could save by using bar coded-ZIP
codes on your mail.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Shareware
For trial copies of FastZip Mail and FastZip Invoice, send $7, plus tax for
Californians. For Amortization Master and WinPost, send $4 each to Shareware,
P.O. Box 7037, Long Beach, CA 90807. Please indicate 5 1/4- or 3 1/2-inch
disks.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Installing these two programs is pretty simple.;    If you have regular
customers, you can enter their names and addresses through your data base.
Otherwise, you enter the mailing address manually. You tell the program what
your sales tax rate is (be sure to enter it in decimal points, such as .06 for
6 percent) and it will total up the order, subtracting any discounts or any
amount already paid.;    The evaluation copy of Fastmail Zip, which prints
envelope addresses, won't actually print your bar codes; you'll need to
register for that. After evaluating the programs (look for Version 2.2 on
bulletin boards, or we'll send you copies of both disks for $7), registration
for each program costs $49 from Westcoast Software, 976 W. Foothill, No. 344,
Claremont, CA 91711.;    AMORTIZATION MASTER -- A friend who was shopping for
a home loan asked us to find a simple program that would figure his payments
on different amounts at varying interest rates. We loaded Amortization Master
in a flash and ran through all his scenarios.;    If that's all you need as
you're shopping for a loan, this probably will do the trick, but there
certainly are more powerful shareware programs to help you with your finances.
(Personal Financial Planner and Pelton Financial Utilities come to mind.);   
After trying Amortization Master, you need to register by sending $30 to
Antelope Systems, 3190 NW Nyssa Court, Beaverton, OR 97006.;    WINDOWS
CORNER: WinPost -- If your business and personal lives revolve around those
sticky yellow Post-it notes, you'll have to be the first in your office to get
WinPost, which does for Windows 3.0 what the yellow notes do for your desk.
Once you've installed WinPost, you'll be able to create notes in different
sizes. You can even change the color of the notes, if you don't like yellow.
Look for version 3.0b on your favorite bulletin board. (If you don't have a
modem, we'll send you a copy for $4.) After trying it for three weeks, you'll
need to either register or take it off your hard disk. Registration costs $30
from Eastern Mountain Software, P.O. Box 20178, Columbus, OH 43220.  </TEXT>
