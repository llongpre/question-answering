   BOHEMIA, N.Y. -- Symbol Technologies Inc. said it formed a
joint venture with Olympus Optical Co. of Tokyo, to sell
bar-code scanning products in Japan.
   The new venture, Olympus Symbol Inc., will be based in
Tokyo and will be financed equally by both partners. The
partners have also signed a comprehensive long-term
technology agreement that calls for sharing of technology
related to bar-code products.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Initially, Symbol Technologies, which designs and
manufactures bar-code scanners and terminals, will supply
Olympus with the products for distribution. But once the
technology is transferred to the new venture, Olympus will
design and make the products in Japan.
