Barcodes, it seems, have become ubiquitous. The machine-readable panels of
black and white stripes are being used to identify everything from newborn
babies to pension books.
Yet barcodes have drawbacks, notably in the amount of information that can
be squeezed on to a label, which is usually restricted to a simple
identification number. In an attempt to pack in more data, manufacturers
have been working on a new generation of codes which store information in
two dimensions.
These codes, which are capable of storing information 100 times more densely
than their one-dimensional counterparts, have been used in applications
ranging from military security passes to labelling parts on the space
shuttle.
The latest company to announce plans to launch a 2D barcode is Tec (UK), a
subsidiary of Toshiba, the Japanese corporation. Its Data Matrix system,
which can store up to 2,000 bytes of information per code, will come on to
the UK market next month.
Its system has little in common with the conventional barcode, in which data
is represented by a pattern of bars and spaces, which can be scanned by
laser and fed into a computer. The Tec system works by putting raw data into
binary code and representing it in the form of dark and light squares in a
matrix - creating what looks like a blank crossword puzzle. To decypher the
code, a reading machine takes a photograph of the image, which is then
decoded.
The company believes that the system's potential uses include keeping
records for hospital patients, keeping track of components on production
lines, and verifying the identity of document holders.
A similar system has already been introduced by Veritec, a Calfornian
developer. The Veritec system was spotted by Nasa when it was attempting to
improve its method of identifying parts in the space shuttle. By marking the
Veritec codes directly on parts, Nasa was able to bypass steps where a human
would manually transfer serial numbers, thus reducing the risk of human
error.
Another advantage of the system was that it was suitable for marking very
small parts, since the mechanism for reading the code includes a camera with
a lens capable of magnifying the image. The technology also stood out by
producing marks on delicate components that were capable of being read after
being exposed to outer space.
A different technology underpins the two-dimensional system designed by
Symbol Technologies. Its system, which it describes as a portable data file,
consists of a series of codes stacked upon each other. A single code can
contain up to 1,750 characters, compared with around 13 on a traditional
barcode.
The system which was launched commercially two years ago, is being used to
mark the uniform of US fire fighters with their identification and medical
history. Symbol Technologies has also experimented with marking blood bags
with the donor's blood group, the blood's expiry date and centre of origin.
The system is being used in security passes by the US Department of Defence
and will be used by policemen working at the Conservative party conference
in October.
Few developers expect the 2D barcode to replace the traditional barcode. The
traditional one-dimensional systems are relatively cheap and effective and
have already commanded substantial investment.
None the less, the champions of 2D codes firmly believe that their
technology will open up new applications. 'It is the most exciting thing
that has ever happened to barcoding,' believes Brian Marcel, managing
director of Bar Code Systems, a UK distributor of Symbol Technology's
system.
Yet so far, the uptake of 2D barcoding has been relatively slow. The
barriers are not due to cost or technology, says Marcel. Rather, the
acceptance of 2D systems depends on potential users' vision and willingness
to be pioneers, he says. 'No one likes to be first.'
