<HEAD>Postmaster General Says Mail Changes Inevitable</HEAD>

   It may make some people uncomfortable, but
change is necessary and is coming at the post office, Postmaster
General Anthony Frank said Wednesday.
   ``We have to have the foresight and the courage to take
responsibility for our future,'' Frank told a Senate post office
and governmental affairs subcommittee.
   ``It is not going to be placid waters, smooth sailing, and
huzzahs all around,'' said Frank, who was not specific about
changes.
   The postal waters have been decidedly choppy in recent weeks,
following reports of some planned reductions in service standards
at the same time the agency is seeking a rate increase.
   Higher postal prices _ including a 30-cent first class stamp _
are expected to take effect next year.
   Frank told the subcommittee, however, that postal costs have
been held below inflation for the first half of the current fiscal
year and work efficiency in the organization has increased for
three consecutive quarters.
   Mail volume and delivery points have increased slightly over the
last year, but the postal service now has 19,000 fewer career
employees than a year ago, said Frank.
   At the same time, he said, the agency is $361 million in the
black for this fiscal year, although it is expected to fall into
the red as the normal summer and fall decline in mail volume occurs.
   Frank noted the Postal Service will begin negotiating new
contracts this summer with its major unions and said changes in the
way workers are used may be discussed. He did not get into
specifics, however.
   Increased automation will also have a great impact on the
future, especially the use of bar codes on virtually all mail. Bar
codes resemble the rows of lines used for computerized supermarket
pricing and will allow mail to be handled more easily by machines.
