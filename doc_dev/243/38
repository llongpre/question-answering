   HOME PRICES will keep climbing, but more slowly than last year. 

   "Interest rates aren't going to fall in 1987 the way they did in 1986, so house prices aren't going to rise the way they did in 1986," says John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. 
He predicts a 4% increase in home prices nationwide, compared with 6.5% last year. 

   The hottest markets are still in the Northeast, where double-digit increases are widely predicted. 
Lexington, Mass., real-estate agent Richard DeWolfe sees home-price appreciation of 10% to 22% in his area, compared with 32% last year. 
Schlott Realtors Inc., Fair Lawn, N.J., says New York metro prices are picking up again after cooling in late 1986. 
Even markets with sluggish economies see improvement. 
"Business has noticeably picked up," says Des Moines, Iowa, real-estate agent John Tiefenthaler, noting a 23% sales increase in February. 

   Oil-patch real estate bottoms out and starts to attract investors. 
Homes for sale in Oklahoma City dropped to 9,739 in January from 15,000 in early 1986. 

   PENSION PLANS put more money into stocks and less into bonds. 

   "There is a definite reassessment of what the asset mix of the public pension funds should be," says Charles Ellis of consultant Greenwich Associates. 
A recent Greenwich survey finds that by 1989, public funds plan to increase their share of assets in stocks to 42.3% from 37.6%, with bond investments dropping to 40% from 45.5%. 
Large corporate plans have 51% of their assets in stocks and expect to stay there, but bonds' share will drop to 24.8% from 26.3%. 

   Equity exposure peaked in 1972, when 73.4% of total assets of private, non-insured pension plans were in stocks. 
"I think we're working our way back," says William Fouse of Mellon Capital Management Corp., predicting equity levels in the 65% to 70% range. 
But without such a major shift, impact on the markets would be negligible. 
"Pension funds are a small part of the pie right now," with their buying dwarfed by corporate buybacks, foreign investment and money put in mutual funds by individuals, says Robert Farrell, chief market analyst of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 

   BAR CODES move far beyond groceries as technology gets cheaper. 

   More laboratories put bar codes on containers of blood and urine samples for accurate identification. 
Alamo Rent A Car bar-codes its 60,000-car fleet in preparation for a new inventory system. 
Airlines standardize bar codes for making sure luggage gets to the right city. 
New bar codes developed by Cauzin Systems Inc. carry more data and will even store computer programs. 
IBM MidAmerica Federal Employees Credit Union prints financial statements with data in this bar-code form to allow quick entry of the information for use with computer money-management programs. 

   Availability of low-cost scanners for use with personal computers "allows relatively small groups of people to make use of bar codes," says Kenneth Bosomworth of market research firm International Resource Development Inc. 
A departmental control system now costs as little as $4,000, compared to as much as $200,000 when software work was done by consultants. 

   Some future uses: matching people of similar interests at singles bars and in airline-seat assignments, says a "semiserious" Mr. Bosomworth. 

   THE GOOD LIFE costs a lot more. 
The Moet Index, which tracks prices of a dozen luxuries in New York City, jumped 6.1% in 1986, outpacing the 1.9% inflation rate. 
The index's market basket includes a Rolls-Royce, champagne, and a mink coat. 

   SOCK IT AWAY: A collection of 472 socks is donated to North Carolina State University's textile library. 
It includes green Army socks from the '40s, bobby socks from the '50s, early panty hose from the '60s, and a Mickey Mouse sock of 1962 vintage. 

   TAX ADJUSTMENT? 
A Houston restaurant knocks 20% off its "oil barrel lunch" to make up for decreased deductibility of business meals under new tax law. 
Cards on the table read: "The government took it and La Colombe d'Or will give it back." 

   HOSPICE SERVICES gain ground in the health care system. 

   Assured continuation of Medicare's hospice benefit gives wider acceptance to programs that provide aid and comfort to the terminally ill. 
More insurers add hospice benefits, in most cases without any deductible or additional premium. 
One reason: findings that hospice care is 20% to 30% cheaper than hospitalization in the last 30 days of life. 
"Cost containment has a lot to do with it," says Joseph Martingale of Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp; Crosby. 

   Some 95% of hospice patients have cancer, but the mix is changing because of AIDS. 
"It may be the disease that forces the issue of what hospice is about," says Patricia Jones of the Hospice Association of America. 
Thomas O'Hara of insurance broker Jardine Emett &amp; Chandler, Boston, says insurers will aggressively support hospice once AIDS claims start to hit their books. 
"Without hospice, the financial impact would be absolutely enormous," he says. 

   Hospice programs, numbering 269 in 1980, have increased to an estimated 1,500 to 1,700. 

   BRIEFS: A pilot project by Wendy's International lets Dayton, Ohio, customers pay for their burgers with electronic banking cards. . . . 
The first annual MBA Games April 3-5 at Harvard University will pit students from six business schools in such events as inner-tube water polo.
