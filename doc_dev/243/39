<LEADPARA>  A federal panel Friday recommended creating two first-class mail rates -- 29
cents for most letters and 27 cents for the pre-addressed envelopes most
people use to pay their bills.;    The new rates, which could become effective
as early as Feb. 3, were less than the nickel increase the U.S. Postal Service
had requested. The Postal Service wanted the present 25-cent first-class rate
to rise to 30 cents.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Postal Rate Commission said it rejected a bigger increase because small
postal customers already carry too much of the postal system's costs, while
high-volume business users get rate breaks.;    The commission called for a 25
percent increase for third-class rates, which would hit catalog retailers
especially hard. By contrast, the price of a first-class stamp would go up 15
percent.;    And it recommended a price break for small users by establishing
a new, 27-cent first-class rate for bill payers who use pre-addressed
envelopes provided by businesses that feature the more detailed ZIP-plus-4
code and bar codes. These envelopes, which can be sorted automatically at the
post office, make up about half of a typical household's monthly mailings,
according to the commission.;    The 2-cent discount would allow small users
to share the savings the Postal Service has realized from its automated mail
sorting equipment, but previously bestowed only on mass mailers, said
commission Chairman George Haley.;    "The most important part (of this rate
decision) is our effort to restore an equitable balance between the two
biggest classes of mail -- first- and third-class," Haley said at a news
conference.;    Inconvenient denominations;  But even commission members
conceded that the 29-cent and 27-cent denominations would be somewhat
inconvenient for consumers.;    Asked if it would not be easier for patrons to
pay 30 cents than to have to come up with four pennies, W.H. (Trey) LeBlanc
III, one of five members of the Postal Rate Commission, said, "Don't you drive
around the corner to save a nickel on a gallon of gasoline?";    To deal with
the new 29-cent rate, postal officials said 4-cent stamps will be available in
post offices for those holding 25-cent stamps.;    The total package will
increase postal service revenues by $6.2 billion a year, to $48 billion in
1992. The overall amount is roughly what the Postal Service had requested last
March.;    The Postal Service board of governors will meet Jan. 22 to decide
whether to accept, appeal or reject the recommendations.;    But Postmaster
General Anthony Frank signaled support for the complex package of rate
increases Friday, saying in a statement that "our initial reaction . . . is
one of relative satisfaction.";    The Postal Service would decide when to
implement the increases, but experts said Sunday, Feb. 3, would be a likely
date.;    The Postal Service lost $450 million last year, primarily because of
higher labor and fuel costs.;    A penny increase in the price of a
first-class postage stamp raises about $800 million for the Postal Service.;  
 The proposed increase would be the first since April 1988, when the price of
a first-class stamp rose from 22 cents to a quarter.;    Under Friday's
recommendations:;    (check) Postcard postage would cost 19 cents, up from 15
cents.;    (check) Express Mail overnight delivery of a letter would cost
$9.95, up $1.20.;    (check) Rates for second-class mail -- mostly magazines
and newspapers -- would rise an average of 22 percent, or 1 percent less than
the Postal Service requested last March.;    (check) Rates for third-class
mail -- mostly so-called "junk" mail -- would rise 25 percent, well above the
17 percent increase requested by the Postal Service.;    The commission's
recommendations evoked widespread criticism across the political spectrum.;   
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called the recommendations "another blow to the
American public and the nation's business community, already reeling from a
recession.";    Hard on small business;  Tracey Schreft, associate director of
the organization's Small Business Center, said, "While large firms generally
will be able to pass on the increases to their customers or switch to
alternative systems, many smaller companies will be forced out of business."; 
  Ralph Nader, the consumer activist, said:;    "Their decision of 29 cents is
not supported by their analysis, which would have supported the present rate
of 25 cents. This would have forced the Postal Service to start doing
something about its waste, inefficiency and mismanagement."  </TEXT>
