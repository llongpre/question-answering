   NEW YORK -- About a year ago, gutsy investors scooped up
shares of Symbol Technologies for as little as 5 3/8. Today,
with the stock at 24 5/8, some money managers think it's time
to sell.
   Sure, prospects for the bar code industry look bright. And
Symbol Technologies, based in Bohemia, N.Y., is the industry
leader. Bar code scanners, best known for their use in
supermarkets, now control inventories in warehouses, keep
track of luggage on airplanes and identify blood samples,
among other uses. Optimists say sales and earnings will grow
15% to 25% a year.

   But the stock has grown expensive. Even after being
roughed up in this month's market slide, it sells for 31
times the past four quarters' earnings. Some insiders have
been selling. And competition is intensifying, particularly
in the new "wireless" systems.
   Mitch Kuflik of Brahman Securities is buying the stock of
rival Telxon, which was at 24 Wednesday, and he's selling
short (betting against) Symbol. "The fastest growing segment
of the business is wireless communications," he says. Telxon,
out of Akron, Ohio, "has built a consistent 10-year track
record of growth and high returns as a leader in wireless
systems. The weight of the evidence favors Telxon, which is
also cheaper," Mr. Kuflik notes.
   Telxon is indeed cheaper, but at 23 times earnings for the
past four quarters, it isn't inexpensive itself. Earlier this
month, David Nelson, a Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst,
downgraded both stocks to weak buys. Shearson is "still
recommending the stocks," he says. "We just thought they were
getting a tad ahead of themselves on price."
   Mark Cohodes of Rocker Partners is also long Telxon and
short Symbol. Rocker Partners owns about 7.7% of Telxon, Mr.
Cohodes says, and also owns shares in LXE, a smaller bar code
firm. Mr. Cohodes maintains that Telxon, LXE and closely held
Norand all have better wireless technology than Symbol does.
Mr. Nelson says that so far as he can tell there isn't any
clear winner among the competing systems.
   Symbol claims that it is clearly the technological leader,
and it recently scored a coup by installing its "spread
spectrum" wireless system in many Kmart stores. Telxon, LXE
and Norand generally use "narrow band" radio systems. "Narrow
band will be an obsolete technology within about two years,"
declares Dr. Fred Heiman, the father of Symbol's system.
   Symbol gets royalties from its rivals, which use Symbol's
patented laser scanning technology. But a few competitors,
particularly Panasonic and Nippon Denso of Japan, don't use
lasers. They sell CCD, or "charge couple device" scanners
that use an imaging technique similar to that in facsimile
machines. The CCD devices aren't wireless, but they are
"lower cost, with no moving parts and no maintenance," says
Mr. Kuflik. "The drawback has been that you had to touch the
bar code" with the scanning device, but now a close skim will
suffice. He says that if CCD scanners became widely used, it
would imperil Symbol's royalty revenue stream.
   But Richard Bravman, Symbol's marketing vice president,
scoffs at the idea that CCD could pose a threat. Symbol's
equipment is extremely flexible, he says, allowing a
warehouse employee on a fork lift, for example, to point a
scanner two feet away one moment, and 15 feet away the next.
Experimental CCD systems can go out to four feet or so, he
says, but can't vary their focal length.
   According to InvestNet, six Symbol insiders have sold
371,979 shares since May 1. Nine Telxon insiders have sold
296,366 shares. Also, four Symbol insiders have made
government filings indicating their intention to sell shares
this month. Chairman Jerome Swartz intends to sell 125,000
shares, President Raymond Martino intends to sell 100,000,
general counsel Leonard Goldner intends to sell 22,500, and
Mr. Heiman intends to sell 20,345.
   "Would I be buying {the stocks} here? No," says Robert
Gabele, president of InvestNet. "The insiders probably feel
that these are good levels to sell at, not buy at." Thomas G.
Amato, Symbol's chief financial officer, says insiders are
just "diversifying their positions. . . . Stock options are
an important part of compensation for most people at
high-tech companies."
   Mr. Goldner, the general counsel, adds, "You'll always see
selling . . . even if people think the stock is going over
100." As for the stock's valuation, Mr. Amato says it isn't
out of line "in the context of the market and the industry."
   Still, Symbol's price gives some analysts pause. "Telxon
stands out on a valuation basis," says Robert P. Anastasi of
Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta. "It's something you have to
consider pretty strongly."
