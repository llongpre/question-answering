   Novels on Computers

   YOU CAN LOOK it up on a computer.
   So far, a small but steady stream of reference books has
been put on floppy and CD-ROM disks so they can be used on a
computer. Reference material is a natural for computers,
because it's so easy to search for a specific word or string
of words, letting a user dispense with often-fuzzy indexes.
Publishers also like being able to include video and sound in
their encyclopedias or history books, so a user can, say,
hear Martin Luther King's "I have a dream" speech or watch
Neil Armstrong's first steps on the Moon.
   Now, some publishers are considering moving beyond
reference works into fiction. Voyager, Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently introduced the first of a line of computer-disk
books, beginning with "Jurassic Park" by Michael Crichton,
"The Complete Annotated Alice" by Martin Gardner and
"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams. "Jurassic
Park," for instance, comes with dinosaur pictures and sounds.
The books, which work only on Macintosh computers, cost
$19.95 apiece.
   Denise Caruso, editor of Digital Media, a trade
publication, says publishers still must wrestle with some
basic issues. Adults are generally uncomfortable reading an
entire book on a computer screen, she says. But, she figures,
people will like being able to search rapidly through books
and to mark up the pages without permanently marring them.
   Later this year, Voyager will introduce a "tool kit" that
will let authors and publishers make their own electronic
books in Voyager's format. Slate, Scottsdale, Ariz., will
come out with a tool kit designed for pen-based computers.
                                                                                                       

   Easing Consumers' Fears
   About Data on Purchases
                                                                                                       

   WITH technology raising concerns about privacy, some
marketers are taking a new, direct approach. In effect,
they're saying to consumers, "Perhaps you do own the data on
your buying patterns, but maybe we can make a deal."
   Some supermarkets have experimented with electronic
systems that collect data on all the purchases that each
buyer makes in their aisles, but they do it by giving
discounts to those who participate in the programs. Now, two
entrepreneurs are hoping to do the same sort of thing using
fax machines. Chip Elitzer and Don Peppers, the founders of
HomeFax, want to give people the free use of fax machines at
home. In return, people will have to promise to accept two
pieces of targeted advertising a day and fill out a monthly
questionnaire about things they plan to buy.
   HomeFax says it will only promise advertisers that it will
deliver a fax to a certain number of households with a
certain set of characteristics, but it won't tell the
advertisers who's being reached. That way, the advertisers
can't send more faxes or junk mail later and can't sell data
on a consumer to anyone else.
   Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, a computer industry
newsletter, says that even if HomeFax doesn't ever come to
pass, lots of things like it will, because such ventures
address privacy issues in such clear-cut fashion. "It's a
neat idea," she says of HomeFax, which is currently raising
funds to test its system.
                                                                                                       

   Shortening Store Lines
   With Handy Registers
                                                                                                       

   THOSE lines at department store cash registers may not be
so long if hand-held "charge" registers catch on.
   Symbol Technologies, Bohemia, N.Y., and Telxon, Akron,
Ohio, recently unveiled registers weighing a couple of pounds
apiece that have keyboards, small display screens,
credit-card readers and bar-code scanners. The devices also
are wireless, communicating over a radio frequency with the
store's central computer. That portability means that a
salesperson can ring up a transaction on the spot rather than
sending the customer to a line. Stores also can have roaming
troubleshooters armed with the wireless registers to pitch in
when regular lines get too long.
   The devices have drawbacks, notably that they don't take
cash. They do, however, fit in with the trend for big stores
to make their networks wireless, so they don't have to rip up
their floors and rewire everything whenever they want to move
a cash register or rearrange a department.
                                                                                                       

   Now Computer Illiterates
   Can Pay Bills at Home
                                                                                                       

   OVERCOMING consumers'reluctance to pay monthly
   bills electronically is the goal of US Order, Herndon, Va.
   Electronic bill-paying hasn't caught on with many people
because it requires the bill payer to have a home computer
and to be on speaking terms with it. Some of the services
were initially very expensive, too.
   US Order has come up with a way to pay bills
electronically without a home computer. For a time-pressed
consumer who's willing to pay $9.95 a month, US Order will
supply a special telephone with a small screen, a slot for
reading the magnetic stripe on a bank or credit card and a
penlike bar-code reader. The company also will provide a
sheet of bar codes, one for each utility and store to which
the consumer makes regular payments.
   To make a payment, the bill payer dials US Order's
computer, punches in the amount of the payment, and then uses
the pen to scan the bar code representing the company to be
paid and the date on which the payment should be made. The US
Order computer then debits the user's bank account on the
appropriate day and makes the payment.
   US Order also will supply special catalogs with which the
consumer can order and immediately pay for merchandise.
