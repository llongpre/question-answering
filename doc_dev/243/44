   WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service awarded $133 million in
contracts for the first nine operations outside post offices
that will encode for automation a big portion of the mail.
   Four companies were given contracts to do the keying and
data entry for the so-called remote bar coding system at six
outside locations for nine large Postal Service
mail-processing centers. Eventually, the agency expects the
remote coding to cover 20% of the letters going through its
system. Those letters lack full, clear addresses that can be
read by the service's optical-scanning machines in postal
facilities.

   Bell &amp; Howell Co., Skokie, Ill., received an $11.9 million
contract for keying work at Knoxville, Tenn., for the Carol
Stream, Ill., center. DynCorp., Reston, Va., won contracts
totaling $86.7 million for keying at Tampa, Fla., for the
Tampa center and at York, Pa., for the Melville, N.Y.;
Minneapolis; King of Prussia, Pa., and Belmar, N.J., centers.
   The agency awarded contracts totaling $27.4 million to
Envisions, San Diego, for keying operations at San Diego and
Oakland, Calif., centers. It gave a $7.4 million contract to
Unibase, Salt Lake City, for similar work at Twin Falls,
Idaho, for the Pembroke Pines, Fla., center.
   The first remote coding equipment will be installed for
the Tampa center next April. Units are to be installed for
the other eight centers by the end of 1992. The Postal
Service expects 295 systems to be used at 220 post offices,
with more than 200 keying operations at remote sites, by
1995.
