   Hiring permanent part-time workers and
contracting out some services may have to be considered as ways to
save money in postal operations, Postmaster General Anthony Frank
told a Senate subcommittee Friday.
   Rising health care costs and other expenses are eating up
savings realized through automation, and the massive postal agency
needs to look throughout its operations to find ways to cut costs,
Frank told the subcommittee on federal services, post office and
civil service.
   ``So far this year, while we still anticipate that revenues will
exceed expenses by a small margin, we have not done as well as we
had planned,'' Frank reported.
   The Postal Service had planned for a surplus this year based on
the 25-cent postage rate that took effect just a year ago.
   Frank has said previously that he expected the agency to drop
into the red in 1990 and face another rate increase in 1991,
maintaining the recent cycle of increasing postage costs every
three years.
   When postal managers applied for the current rates they were
overly optimistic in their projections in an effort to achieve the
``round figure'' of a quarter, Frank told the subcommittee.
   In the real world, costs have exceeded those expectations,
resulting in a smaller surplus than had been hoped for. Also
affecting the postal budget was legislation last year requiring the
agency to contribute funds toward reducing the federal debt.
   Frank told the subcommittee that in order to maintain universal
postal service, and to save money without affecting the current
postal employees, his managers are having to re-evaluate all
operations of the agency.
   ``Maybe we need to look at permanent part-time people,'' he
commented, noting that such workers are common in other countries.
The Netherlands, for example, hires many housewives to deliver mail
four hours per day, Frank said.
   Another possibility is contracting out some work. The Postal
Service currently uses contractors to handle about 15 percent of
its rural routes, and may need to expand that share and consider
hiring contractors for other tasks, Frank said.
   Use of bar codes on all letters by 1995 and other improvements
in automation will help speed the mail and save money, but those
are long-term benefits and not things that will affect the agency
overnight, he said.
   In addition, automation requires a considerable investment,
Frank said. For example, several years ago managers bought machines
designed to read the nine-digit ZIP codes. Those codes were delayed
by Congress and never become popular with the public, so the
machines are now being converted to perform other tasks.
