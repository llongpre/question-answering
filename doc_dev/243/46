TICKET THEFTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The article on airline ticket thefts kept me until the last paragraph (Part A, 
Jan. 9). It was at the end, however, that I laughed out loud at the complaints 
regarding airlines' inability to properly check tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines say they use profiles to spot bad guys. Joe Whitby of British Airways 
wants a magnetic strip on each ticket. Give us a break! 
</P>
<P>
Haven't any of these overpaid security experts ever heard of bar codes? What 
could be simpler than running a small light pen over a bar code? Airlines spend 
millions on their computer systems. Can't they find a simple software package 
that'll take the bar code readout and compare it to the list of stolen tickets? 
</P>
<P>
I have no sympathy for the airlines that could implement an instantaneous 
ticket check procedure right now. Instead they moan and groan about their 
losses!
