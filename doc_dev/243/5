   United Parcel Service is betting 888
tiny black hexagons will ease the organized chaos of delivering 12
million packages a day.
   The hexagons, printed on a small square label, hold 100 letters
or numbers that a computer can read. That's five times the
information provided by traditional bar codes, which the UPSCODE
hexagons are intended to replace.
   It is the key to a $1.4 billion program to develop a package
delivery system that uses people for little more than the driver
handing the parcel to its recipient, UPS officials said.
   ``Bar codes, in my opinion, are '80s technology, not '90s
technology,'' said Wesley E. Hughes, who led the team that
developed the new system.
   UPS uses bar codes to keep track of the 700,000 packages it
delivers by air every day. But no such computerized system is in
place to follow the ground-transported packages, which make up the
bulk of UPS's business, said Alan Caminiti, a UPS spokesman.
   An employee must be involved in sorting and distributing
packages through every step of the delivery process.
   Thousands of package handlers line up along conveyor belts at
UPS's 150 U.S. sorting hubs. They must pick up each package, read
its address and send it down the appropriate chute, either to be
piled into UPS's familiar brown delivery truck for its final
destination or sent to another hub for further sorting.
   If a ground delivery package is lost, clerks must dig through
files to determine where it entered the UPS system and whether it
got out - a tedious process at best and a lengthy one at worst.
Air-delivered packages are a little easier to trace, as the bar
code labels allow workers to scan a tracking number into a computer
that can perform an electronic search.
   But both systems require people, and UPS faces a shrinking pool
of young and educated workers who can swiftly read and sort
packages. More than 45 percent of the company's 244,000 employees
are part-time package loaders and sorters, many of them college
students, Caminiti said.
   UPS delivered 2.8 billion packages last year and expects that
number to grow steadily in the coming decade. The only way the
company can keep up with that pace, Hughes said, is to develop
automatic sorters, robotics and computerized tracking systems.
   ``Without some type of automation, we literally are concerned
that we'd run out of people to . . . process our packages in the
time frame that we need to get them processed,'' Hughes said.
   UPS researchers developed and patented UPSCODE after they found
bar codes couldn't pack enough information to meet their needs.
UPSCODE's hexagon pattern can be translated into names, addresses,
tracking numbers and any other information.
   As a UPSCODE-imprinted package rolls along a conveyor belts at
slightly more than 5{ mph, a specially made camera finds, reads and
interprets the code in less than a second. Without the label,
packages crawl past human sorters at a tenth of the speed so the
workers can read the labels.
   With UPSCODE and a fully automated sorting system, the conveyor
belts can be revved up to allow 5,000 packages an hour to get
through, rather than the current 2,000 to 3,000, Hughes said.
   UPSCODE will first be used for air-delivered packages next
spring, Caminiti said. Widespread use isn't likely to start until
1992, when UPSCODE will be used to help UPS track every package in
its system, Hughes said.
   Bar coding will soon be used by the U.S. Postal Service to sort,
distribute and trace its daily deluge of 2.3 million packages, said
Peter A. Jacobson, assistant postmaster for engineering.
   He said the Postal Service wouldn't be interested in using a
dense-code system like UPSCODE, because its scanners and readers
would be too costly.
   ``The more exotic the code, the more investment you need to
make,'' Jacobson said.
   UPSCODE could be used in other industries besides packge
delivery, if the company decides to sell it commercially, Hughes
said.
   Warehouses, which need to keep tight inventory control, could
use a system like UPSCODE, he said.
