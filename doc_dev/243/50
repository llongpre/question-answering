   Symbol Technologies Inc. declared a 2-for-1 stock split, payable May 31 to stock of record May 16. 

   The maker of bar-code scanning equipment also reported fiscal third-quarter net income more than doubled on an 85% increase in sales. 

   The improved results stemmed from a "steady increase in shipments to a diverse customer base, coupled with a substantial level of sales to the retail segment," Symbol said. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Symbol closed yesterday at $46.25, up $1.375. 

   Net income for the quarter ended March 31 climbed to $5.3 million, or 55 cents a share, from $2.2 million, or 32 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 

   Year-earlier net included a credit of $902,000, or 13 cents a share, from a taxloss carry-forward. 
Thus, operating profit tripled. 
Sales grew to $22.3 million from $12.1 million. 

   Symbol said it received a federal patent on the design of an optical scanner module. 
Symbol said the design facilitates the replacement of its bar-code scanners.
