   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on El Salvador:
   By publicly linking members of El Salvador's military to the
brutal murders of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her
daughter, Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani has courageously
confronted the barbarous elements within his own armed forces.
   It was a courageous act because ... Cristiani risks alienating
not only El Salvador's powerful military establishment, but his own
right-wing constituency. ...
   Cristiani's vow to punish all those involved ``down to the last
person implicated'' will be difficult in a country that lacks both
a democratic tradition and an independent judiciary. ...
   To his great credit, ... Cristiani has promised to leave no
stone unturned in his effort to find and punish all those
responsible for these crimes. Having taken that courageous first
step, he is now obligated to ensure that justice is carried out.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on Panama:
   As American troops leave Panama, pollsters have moved in and the
ultimate judges have had their say. Panamanians by a wide margin
say President Bush was right in ordering the strike that toppled
Manuel Noriega's government and eventually led to his being brought
to the United States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges.
   The approval was given by 89 percent of 1,304 people of Panama
living in both urban and rural areas polled Jan. 5-13 by a firm
associated with the Gallup organization.
   The 89 percent said the action was necessary, 88 percent saw it
as beneficial to the country and wanted U.S. forces to remain as
long as is necessary to ensure order, and 86 percent considered the
invasion a ``liberation.''
   On the other side of the coin, 87 percent of those polled had
unfavorable opinion of Noriega and 91 percent viewed Noriega's
Panamanian Defense Force as unfavorable and ``repressive.''
   The verdict is in, let it stand.

   The Gastonia (N.C.) Gazette on NASA's Mars mission:
   More than one pair of eyes popped at NASA's projected price tag
for missions to Mars and the moon: $15 billion to $20 billion a
year for 25 years. Now some space experts are questioning whether
NASA has gotten too bureaucratic and hidebound to do the job.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, head of the National Space Council,
gave the agency a tweaking in a recent speech. NASA, he said, ``has
not done as well as it could have in marshaling the resources and
the leadership necessary to keep us ahead in space.''
   While rejecting the idea that NASA be replaced, Quayle
recommended loosening the agency's monopoly on space by reaching
out to universities, private businesses and even other government
agencies in a search for new ideas and methods.
   One privately developed idea, for example, is using lighter,
inflatable material in constructing space stations, cutting
expenses and time.
   There are drawbacks to the plan, and it may never be used. But
it illustrates the fact that the freshest ideas are generated
outside government. NASA should take Quayle's friendly suggestions
to heart; as much as any federal agency, it can use those fresh
ideas.

   Stevens Point (Wis.) Journal on bar code scanning:
   It's sort of like one of those stories we read in Scholastic
Weekly, way back in elementary school. You know, researchers
predict that in a few years, we'll have video telephones. Well,
it's been a few decades, and we're still waiting.
   Anyway, researchers at a Japanese university say they're working
on a system to allow motorists to get information about their
location through bar codes painted on highways and read by
computers in their cars.
   Researchers say they think they'll be able to design a system
that will work even if the bar codes fade or become obscured by
dirt. If that's the case, maybe they can do something about bar
code scanners in the stores of today.

   The Daily Times, Primos, Pa., on the NCAA:
   It's sad to see that college athletics has put the pigskin ahead
of the sheepskin in the easing of academic requirements for
scholarship athletes.
   The NCAA recently caved in to pressure from the powers that be
(Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson and Temple coach John
Chaney to name a couple) and ripped the guts out of a year-old
restriction on financial aid to new athletes who don't fully meet
academic requirements for scholarships.
   It was only last year about this time that the NCAA designed
Proposition 42, which would have banned all scholarships and other
aid for freshman athletes who meet only part of grade and
test-score minimums created three years ago under another measure
called Proposition 48.
   Under Proposition 48, partial qualifiers could receive full
scholarships while only having to sit out their freshman year.
   Prop 42 was a good thing, because it told prospective college
athletes that they would have to study. And isn't that what college
is supposed to be all about? ...
   Thompson claimed that Prop 42 discriminated against
underprivileged and minority students.
   We find that hard to swallow, considering that college entrance
standards for athletes have always appeared to be considerably
lower than those set for non-athletes.
   And now with the further relaxing of such minimal standards in
this latest measure _ which has become known as Proposition 26 _
colleges will be discriminating against underprivileged and
minority applicants who just might not happen to play sports.
