   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank says he is
optimistic about the future, despite the fact that the post office
is preparing to raise rates as it faces the largest dollar loss in
postal history.
   Frank said he is encouraged because productivity has increased
in recent months, the pending rate increase will improve finances
and more automation is being introduced.
   Plans for a 1991 increase in the price of sending mail,
including a 30-cent stamp for first class letters, are expected to
be announced next week.
   The Postal Service is expected to complete this fiscal year $1.6
billion in the red, Frank told the House Post Office and Civil
Service Committee.
   ``It may seem paradoxical to say so, but I can tell you that I
am more optimistic about the Postal Service now than I've been
since I came here,'' said Frank, who is just completing two years
in office.
   Frank has set a goal of having bar codes _ those rows of little
lines similar to the price codes in grocery stores _ on all mail by
1995 as part of his automation program. With the codes, the
majority of mail handling can be done by machine prior to final
delivery.
   ``We expect more changes in the Postal Service in the next five
years than in the past 200. And that's not an overstatement,''
Frank told the committee.
   Labor negotiations this summer offer a chance to increase union
cooperation in improving postal operations, Frank added.
   ``In the labor negotiations we are going to ask our employees'
representatives to show some constructive restraint,'' said Frank.
   Both wage restraint and more flexibility in scheduling are
needed to take advantage of automation, he said.
   No one working for the postal service need fear for their job,
however, he said. ``We can make all the adjustments we need to stay
competitive through attrition.''
   If first-class rates rise to 30 cents, that would mean they have
gone up more than inflation since the last hike in 1988.
   ``That's totally unacceptable to the people who pay our bills
and it's unacceptable to me,'' said Frank. ``I've set a goal of
getting to the point where our costs will be kept a full 2 percent
below inflation ...''
   The rate case will also include some lower rates for bulk mail
that can be handled by machinery, in an effort to encourage large
mailing firms to prepare the mail in a way machinery can deal with
it, he said.
   Asked about an Office of Management and Budget proposal for a
special, lower rate for government agencies, Frank said the
estimated $220 million cost of that cut would simply have to be
shifted to others who use the mail.
   The post office no longer receives any government subsidy, so it
has to cover its expenses with income and any cut in money coming
in has to be balanced by charging someone else more.
   There probably are $200 million in savings available to
government agencies if they would simply use the bulk rate
discounts available now, Frank said.
   Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich., told Frank that he and other
committee members plan to oppose an administration proposal to
shift $1.3 billion in federal retirement costs to the Postal
Service.
   ``This is simoply an arbitrary grab to get some cash,'' said
Ford.
