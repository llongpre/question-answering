   MSI Data Corp., fighting a hostile takeover attempt by Telxon Corp., said it agreed to be acquired by Symbol Technologies Inc. for $23 a share, or an indicated $115.7 million for the MSI shares Symbol doesn't already own. 

   MSI said earlier this week that it was negotiating with a third party it didn't identify regarding a possible acquisition. 
A day later, Telxon sweetened its original $17-a-share offer, rejected by MSI's board last week as inadequate, to $20 a share, conditioned on MSI's responding today by 5 p.m. EDT. Telxon's latest tender offer remains in effect until 12:01 a.m. EDT, Oct. 8. 

   Telxon, MSI's chief competitor in the hand-held computer business, said it was reviewing the agreement between MSI and Symbol. 

   News of Symbol's offer sent MSI's stock up $1.75 a share, to $23.25, in American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. 
Symbol, a maker of bar-code laser scanners, currently owns 234,200 shares, or about 4.5%, of MSI's nearly 5.3 million shares outstanding. 
Symbol will launch a tender offer for MSI shares within five business days, and the offer is conditioned on Symbol's receiving enough shares to give it at least a majority of MSI's stock. 

   If the acquisition isn't completed, MSI will pay Symbol up to $7.5 million in termination fees and expenses under certain circumstances. 

   Symbol didn't provide details of its financing plans for the acquisition, but a source close to the company said that Symbol would likely use the $71.7 million in cash and short-term investments it had as of June 30, plus borrowings. 
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. is Symbol's financial adviser. 

   Symbol wouldn't comment on the transaction beyond saying that it sees "a strategic fit" in a combination with MSI. Analysts say that Symbol's share of the portable laser scanner market is about 90%, and that the use of these scanners will continue to increase. 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, Symbol, based in Bohemia, N.Y., earned $20.2 million, or $1.07 a share, on sales of $89 million. 

   Charles S. Strauch, MSI's president and chief executive officer, said, "Symbol's expertise in bar-code laser scanning, coupled with MSI's strength in on-the-move information collection systems, will enable the combined enterprise to deliver bar-code based, portable data collection systems for a broad range of existing and new applications in both domestic and overseas markets." 

   But industry observers said Telxon likely remains interested in MSI. 
While Telxon is stronger in the U.S., MSI has a greater presence in Europe. 
A combination of those two companies would also resolve costly litigation that they have had outstanding against each other for the past three years. 
Telxon sued MSI for alleged wrongful appropriation of confidential information, and MSI sued Telxon for patent infringement. 

   In a related development, Moody's Investor Service said it was placing the B-2 rating on $46 million of Telxon's long-term debt under review for possible downgrade. 
The rating service said it was concerned that the company might engage in a bidding war and increase its leverage to finance an acquisition. 
Telxon said, "Nothing has been determined as to whether we will be in a bidding war. 
We are reviewing our options."
