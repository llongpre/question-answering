   NEW YORK -- The U.S. Postal Service plans to reduce daily
business mail delivery in this city from a maximum of two
rounds to one, starting tomorrow.
   A Postal Service spokesman said New York was the last city
in the country where certain high-volume neighborhoods still
received two deliveries a day.

   Over the past few years, the spokesman said, the Postal
Service has made a large investment in automated technology,
optical character readers and bar code scanners, which will
enable it to reduce the number of trips while delivering the
same amount of mail.
   The spokesman said the change will affect only a small
fraction of businesses, since most businesses already receive
their mail in one daily delivery.
