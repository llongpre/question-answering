   PEARL RIVER, N.Y. -- Paxar Corp., despite recessionary
difficulties in its major market, the apparel industry,
expects to post record earnings for its fourth quarter and
year.
   The company expects to report net income of about 20 cents
a share, or a total of $1.1 million, Arthur Hershaft,
chairman and president, said. A year earlier, Paxar had net
of one cent a share, or $41,000.

   Sales are expected to rise to about $24 million from $17.9
million. The latest quarter includes sales of National Tag,
which Paxar bought in September.
   Paxar makes product-identification systems, including
electronic printers, printed and woven labels and bar-code
tags and promotional hang tags for the apparel and textile
industry.
   For the year, Mr. Hershaft said Paxar expects to post
record earnings of a little over 60 cents a share, or a total
of $3.4 million. In 1990, it had net of 21 cents a share, or
$1.1 million. Both the quarter and the year's results were
adjusted for a stock dividend declared in April.
   Sales for the year are seen rising about 22% to $89
million from $72.9 million.
   Mr. Hershaft said the prospects for this year "are really
excellent," and he expects sales to be "well over $100
million."
   "The growth came from all over," Mr. Hershaft said, with
sales in every business unit up 20% to 25%. "The amazing
thing is that in spite of the fact 1991 was one of the worst
recessions to hit the retail industries . . . our business
really had a record year," he said.
   Mr. Hershaft cited several reasons for Paxar's
performance. He said the firm's biggest customers generally
are those who supply relatively moderately priced apparel and
specialty retailers, which did fairly well despite the
recession.
   Paxar also expanded its product line with the purchase of
National Tag, an acquisition Mr. Hershaft called very
important because it gave the company more direct contact
with the retailer through a so-called service bureau that
supplies barcode tags and filled out the product line. The
greater demand for bar-code tags, used to track inventory,
has helped drive Paxar's growth.
   In addition, the company is expected to complete on
Tuesday the acquisition of American Silk Label from American
Trim Products. That company has annual sales of about $20
million.
   The National Tag acquisition also added a manufacturing
presence in Hong Kong, where Mr. Hershaft sees significant
potential for growth. U.S. sales account for 78% of total
sales, while international sales account for 22%.
