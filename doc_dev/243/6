   The U.S. Postal Service board of governors
approved spending $379.3 million Tuesday on new letter sorting
machines.
   The board, meeting in Raleigh, N.C., voted to launch the program
that will lead to bar-coding of all mail by 1995.
   Bar codes are a series of thin lines, similar to those used in
supermarket pricing.
   The money approved Tuesday will cover purchase of 1,349
automatic bar-code reading machines which can sort mail carrying
the codes. It is the first of a three-phase program to make the
coding universal.
   Bar codes already are being used in sorting much business mail,
and the company sending the mail applies the codes in the lower
corner of the letter.
   The new machines will be able to read a code anywhere on the
face of the letter, an advantage which is expected to encourage
more businesses to use the codes.
   Individuals will not be expected to place barcodes on their
mail. However, by the mid-1990s the postal service will begin
placing the codes on letters that do not have them to allow the
material to be sorted by machine.
