   The American Civil Liberties Union on Friday
decried a county sheriff's policy that forces homosexual jail
inmates to wear pink bracelets.
   ``It reflects homophobia,'' said Jim Green, an ACLU attorney in
West Palm Beach. ``Labeling people's clothing based on a sexual
preference seems an extreme response to a situation that doesn't
warrant it.''
   For at least 15 years, homosexual inmates at the Polk County
Jail have been kept separate from other inmates and labeled with
pink wrist bands. The sheriff says it's for their own safety.
   ``All hell would break loose'' in the prison if homosexuals were
allowed to mix with the general population, said Sheriff Lawrence
W. Crow Jr. ``If this system wasn't needed for their own
protection, I'd change it in a minute.''
   Crow said homosexual inmates are often the targets of ridicule
and beatings, so jailers ask all inmates their sexual preference
when they enter the facility.
   If the inmate says he is homosexual, ``he is given a wrist band
and kept separate from the general population,'' said sheriff's
spokeswoman Lynne Breidenbach. ``If we find out things later and
have probable cause that he's a homosexual, then we put the wrist
band on.''
   Ms. Breidenbach said different colored bands are used to
distinguish inmates for other reasons, such as green for
escape-risk inmates. She said there was no special reason pink was
chosen to distinguish homosexuals.
   ``It's really an off-red,'' she said. ``That's just the color
that was available.''
   The county jail has 1,199 inmates, of which 25 to 35 are wearing
bracelets identifying them as homosexuals, Breidenbach said.
   ACLU attorney Green said he is studying possible civil action to
have the practice stopped as unconstitutional. He cited a case in
Indiana two years ago in which a federal court ruled against
segregation of homosexual inmates.
   Kirk Warren, the sheriff's legal counsel, said Thursday the
practice of labeling inmates is legal and ``in the best interest of
the safety of all the inmates.''
   The sheriff, while not acknowledging complaints from inmates or
the ACLU, said he has been looking into switching the colored bands
to bands that have bar codes similar to those used in supermarkets.
   Waving a scanner over the bracelets would tell staff members
whether inmates have medical problems or are wanted in another
county, according to Crow, who said no immediate plans have been
made to switch to the system.
   While bands with bar codes would be an improvement, they're not
a solution, ACLU officials said.
   Robyn Blumner, executive director for Florida's ACLU, described
the bar codes as ``more palatable than pink tags.'' But she
maintained that sexual orientation shouldn't have anything to do
with inmate classifications.
   ``Predator inmates should be separated from victim inmates, but
sexual preference should have nothing to do with it,'' she said.
   Gays who seek protection from others should be granted it,
Blumner said, but only at their choice _ not the sheriff's.
   Blumner said six lesbian inmates have written to her with
complaints that being ``pink tagged'' has limited their privileges
and brought harsh treatment from corrections officers.
   Crow denies the charges.
