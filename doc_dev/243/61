   Refac International Ltd. sued a group of firms, including Eastman Kodak Co., Tandy Corp. and Honeywell Inc., alleging infringement of its bar-code patent. 

   The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, seeks to enjoin the defendants from further infringement of the patent on the computerized product-identification system. 

   The New York company, which specializes in international technology transfer and patent enforcement, seeks unspecified damages. 
Refac President Phil Sperber estimates the infringement has cost the company annual sales of as much as $1 billion. 

   Other defendants named include Federal Express Corp.; Harris Corp., Melbourne, Fla.; J.C. Penney Co., Dallas; McCrory Corp., a unit of New York-based Rapid-American Corp.; Pentax Instrument Co.; Sumitomo Electric USA Inc., a unit of Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. of Japan; Telxon Corp., Akron, Ohio; Unisys Corp., Blue Bell, Pa., and United Parcel Service of America Inc. 

   United Parcel, based in New York, couldn't be reached for comment. 
Sumitomo Electric's president, Peter Fujita, said he hadn't seen the suit and didn't recall any recent use of the bar code in the New York company's products. 
Federal Express, the Memphis, Tenn., door-to-door express deliverer declined comment. 

   A Harris spokesman said he was unaware of the suit and therefore couldn't comment on it. 
Neither Penney nor Unisys officials could be reached for comment. 

   Officials of Pentax, Orangeburg, N.Y., medical instrument maker and a unit of Asahi Optical of Japan, also couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Rapid-American said it hadn't seen the suit and couldn't comment. 
A Tandy spokesman declined comment, and a Honeywell spokeswoman said she was unaware of the suit.
