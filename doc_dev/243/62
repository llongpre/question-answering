<LEADPARA>  The U.S. Postal Service plans to move some operations from its East Santa Cruz
station to a new facility in Live Oak, but stamps and other counter services
will still be available at its Seabright Avenue location.;    Plans to build a
new distribution and sorting center in Live Oak, near to Highway 1 at Soquel
and Chanticleer avenues, will be unveiled today to Santa Cruz County
supervisors.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Board members are expected to ask the Postal Service to prepare an
environmental assessment of the project -- which postal authorities hope to
complete in about 18 months.;    To make report;  Norma Jellison,
environmental coordinator for the Postal Service at its San Bruno regional
center, says the Postal Service "always cooperates with local government." She
said a report will be prepared to look at any environmental effects the center
might have and any concerns of the board of supervisors.;    Postal Service
spokesman Gus Ruiz said the new center would be for mail carriers now
operating from the cramped East Santa Cruz station. Letter carriers will not
operate out of the Seabright Avenue post office once the Live Oak building is
opened, he said.;    Ruiz said the new station also will house automated
equipment to help sort mail coming to the Santa Cruz area from outside the
county. That mail, he said, will include envelopes that can be processed and
sorted by a bar-code reader -- a device that can separate bulk mailings into
routes to be delivered by letter carriers.;    Exempt from rules;  In a letter
supervisors are scheduled to consider today, County Planning Director Dianne
Guzman notes that as a federal agency the Postal Service is exempt from local
land-use and planning regulations.;    "However, the county should take this
opportunity to raise important issues with the Postal Service so that they can
be addressed early in the planning and environmental review stages," she
said.;    Those concerns, Guzman said, include visual impact of the building
from nearby Highway 1, traffic problems, if any, that the project could create
at the nearby Soquel Avenue-Highway 1 interchange as well as other nearby
intersections, and compatibility with nearby property uses.  </TEXT>
