<LEADPARA>  BAR codes similar to those on packaged items in supermarkets are being put on
bees to track their activities.;   Nine stripes, each less than one-tenth of
an inch long, are glued to tiny hairs on bees' backs at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson, Ariz. An electronic
bar-code reader at the beehive records each bee's exit and entry.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We'll learn such things as how hard they work collecting pollen and
nectar, the number of trips each bee makes, the length of time each spends
foraging and how resistant bees are to pesticides," said entomologist Stephen
L. Buchman.;   "Keeping track of individual bees used to be almost impossible
because they all look alike," he said. "We couldn't easily monitor bees'
leaving and returning to hives. Now, we're keeping a dossier on each tagged
bee to record its activity over a long period."  </TEXT>
