   John Gabos had hoped to strike it rich this
Christmas with a gimmick designed to symbolically turn the tables
on Japan, but his Japan Land Owner's Kit has put him about $100,000
in the hole.
   So much for Yankee ingenuity.
   ``I've had trouble,'' Gabos said. ``I could tell you I've sold
thousands of them, but I haven't.''
   A bar-code scanning equipment salesman by day, Gabos has been
shut out in his attempt to gain retail shelf space for his
moonlighting project: triangular cardboard boxes holding membership
certificates to The Preferred Japanese Land Owner's Club.
   ``Own a piece of Japan,'' the boxes urge.
   Convinced that Americans were feeling overpowered by the
increasing Japanese economic presence in the United States, the
31-year-old Gabos bet a large chunk of his life savings on the
notion that 1 million consumers would spend $12 to $14 each to
belong to a club which owns tiny piece of idle farmland in
Hokkaido, the least densely populated prefecture of Japan.
   Gabos bought the plot for about $50,000. The club owns the land
as a group, but club members don't hold individual ownership rights
and have restricted use privileges: They are prohibited from
building, hunting, camping, or removing soil, rocks, vegetation or
anything else.
   By mid-December, Gabos and his wife, Christine, had sold about
100 units, mostly to friends and through direct mail. Others from
the first printing run of 10,000 units are gathering dust.
   The couple has tried to build awareness of the product through
the news media with limited success. Now they are considering
several advertising options.
   ``It could very well be a turkey if he hasn't sold it to any
major retailers yet,'' Pet Rock inventor Gary Dahl said.``He's
blown it for this year.''
   Dahl has reviewed more than 5,000 gimmicks since selling 1.5
million Pet Rocks in the 1975 Christmas season.
   Had Gabos been able to offer the gimmick to retailers a few
weeks sooner than Oct. 15, they may have been more open to the
idea, he said. But there were delays closing the real estate deal.
Gabos said he found himself in a ``Catch 22'' situation wherein
retailers would pledge to buy the kits if other stores successfully
carried them.
   Gabos said the endeavor surprised a lot of his friends because
he considers himself a ``conservative guy.'' But his employer, Neal
Johnson of Dataserv Inc., a bar-code scanning concern in suburban
Eden Prairie, Minn., said the get-rich-quick scheme didn't shock
him.
   ``He's often told me he just wants to find a way to make a buck
apiece out of a million people to become a millionaire,'' Johnson
said. ``He's a tremendously talented, individual guy.''
   ``I haven't given up hope,'' Gabos said. ``This isn't a thing
that will be obsolete after Christmas. I honestly believe it will
sell out.''
   Christine Gabos said she's confident they will eventually break
even at least. But even if they lose money, she said they will have
no regrets.
   The $100,000 they spent came from stocks, bonds and other
savings, they said. John Gabos said they probably will keep the
land after the club expires, but he said he has no specific plans
for it. Legally he can't sell it until the year 2000, when the club
and its memberships expire.
