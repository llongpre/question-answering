<LEADPARA>  There's no such thing as a small problem at the Pentagon. Consider, for
instance, the humble bar-code label.;    Those labels, like the ones you see
in the supermarket, are read with laser wands and allow the Pentagon's clerks
to identify and keep track of billions of containers of things that keep the
military running. But Pentagon officials say the stickers come unstuck too
often, so they've ordered rigorous new tests to make sure they stay put.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     As a result, military inspectors are halting deliveries of perfectly good
parts because the labels on the boxes they're in haven't been subjected to the
new battery of fog, sunlight, heat, and rubbing tests. The tests take far more
time than the tests required for most of the items inside the boxes.;    All
told, the new rules require military suppliers to test the labels for at least
150 hours -- and in some cases, more than 1,000 hours -- before sticking them
on everything from tanks to toothpicks.;    The rules could force suppliers to
spend about $100,000 apiece to print and test the improved labels, or pay
specialty firms a lot more -- up to 20 times more -- for new labels.;    "If
the label falls off or is unreadable, we lose time, and time is money," said
Stu Crouse, the author of the new rules, who works at the Tobyhanna Army Depot
in northeastern Pennsylvania. But he acknowledged the government never did a
cost-benefit analysis before ordering the improved labels.;    "We've had all
the labels on boxes inside a humid warehouse fall off within two months," he
said. "This is the minimum the Defense Department needs.";    But contractors
-- and even some defense officials -- disagree.;    "I've never had a
complaint on a bar code, either for legibility or because it fell off," said
J. Guy Lewis, president of a Dallas company that has supplied the Pentagon for
22 years.  </TEXT>
