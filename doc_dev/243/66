   In a move that would represent a major break with tradition in the legal profession, law firms in this city may become the first in the nation to reward non-lawyers with the cherished title of partner. 

   The District of Columbia Bar has recommended adoption of a new code of ethics that would permit such a move, reflecting broad changes in the kind of legal services offered by the city's firms. 
The new ethics code must be approved by the D.C. Court of Appeals before it goes into effect and will apply only to lawyers and law firms that practice here. 

   The professional conduct of lawyers in other jurisdictions is guided by American Bar Association rules or by state bar ethics codes, none of which permit non-lawyers to be partners in law firms. 

   The ABA has steadfastly reserved the title of partner and partnership perks (which include getting a stake of the firm's profit) for those with law degrees. 

   But Robert Jordan, a partner at Steptoe &amp; Johnson who took the lead in drafting the new district bar code, said the ABA's rules were viewed as "too restrictive" by lawyers here. 
"The practice of law in Washington is very different from what it is in Dubuque," he said. 

   Mr. Jordan said the provision allowing non-lawyers to be partners reflects shifts in providing legal services that have already occurred at many Washington law firms, which in recent years have hired high-level economists, accountants, lobbyists and other regulatory specialists. 
Several firms have also launched business subsidiaries and consulting arms specializing in trade, lobbying and other areas. 

   Arnold &amp; Porter, which with 300 lawyers is the largest law firm in Washington, pioneered some of these trends. 
It operates a lobbying business, a bank-consulting firm and a real-estate arm which together have 60 employees, most of whom aren't lawyers. 
Arnold &amp; Porter also employs 18 non-lawyer specialists to augment different areas of its legal practice. 

   Some of these non-lawyer employees are paid at partners' levels. 
Yet, not having the partner title "makes non-lawyers working in law firms second-class citizens," said Mr. Jordan of Steptoe &amp; Johnson. 
James Jones, the managing partner of Arnold &amp; Porter agreed. 
"It's tough for a non-lawyer to feel equal." 
Mr. Jones also emphasized that non-lawyer specialists helped his law firm deliver legal services more efficiently and economically. 

   In 1983, after a heated debate, the ABA rejected a proposal to let non-lawyers be partners. 
Members' chief concerns were that it could lead to a situation where businesses took control of law firms and that non-lawyers couldn't be trusted to uphold the legal profession's ethical and professional standards. 

   The district bar narrowed its proposal to address some of these issues. 
Its proposed new code says businesses can't acquire financial stakes in law firms, and holds attorneys responsible for the ethical behavior of their non-lawyer partners. 

   Still, some lawyers are dubious. 
"Non-lawyers are not trained in the same way," said Jamie Gorelick, a partner at a Washington law firm and member of the bar committee that drafted the new code. 

   The local appeals court will vote on the code after a comment period ending Dec. 1. 
Only a handful of comments have been received so far, mostly concerning other provisions of the code, according to the clerk's office. 

   While he awaits the court's decision, Mr. Jordan compared those who don't want to let non-lawyers be partners to the Dr. Seuss characters called Star Bellied Sneetches, who taunt those who don't have stars on their bellies. 
"They think you can't be a partner because you don't have that law degree on the wall," he said.
