   A dissident shareholder group including N.V. Bekaert S.A. and Eberstadt-Fleming Inc. said it wants to oust Computer Identics Corp.'s board. 

   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group said it also believes Canton, Mass.-based Computer Identics, a maker of bar-code scanning equipment, should "pursue the possibility of a merger" with Bellows Falls, Vt.-based Imtec Inc., a maker of equipment for the production of bar-code labels. 

   According to the filing, the group contacted Computer Identics on Feb. 23 to request that its board members resign promptly. 
The group said it wanted to replace the present board with its own designees, except for one director who is already affiliated with the group. 

   In addition, the group would like to replace current management and name Kenneth E. Yaeger as chief executive officer of Computer Identics, the filing said. 

   If the board is replaced, the filing said, the group would be willing to lend Computer Identics as much as $600,000 on essentially the same terms as those under which the group made loans in December. 
The group would also begin negotiations for "a possible stock-for-stock merger of the company and Imtec," the filing said. 
Group members already have held talks with Imtec about such a transaction, the filing added. 

   Bekaert, a Belgian company, holds the equivalent of 2,096,527 Computer Identics common shares, or 25.42% of the total outstanding, and has voting control under certain circumstances of over 783,527 additional shares, according to the filing. 
Eberstadt, a New York-based brokerage firm that acts as a market maker in Computer Identics stock, has reported holding the equivalent of a 10.82% stake in Computer Identics. 

   David Collins, Computer Identics chairman, said the board will meet next Tuesday to consider the dissident group's requests. 
"The group's position isn't flattering, but we will consider all the points they put forward," Mr. Collins said. 

   Mr. Collins added that Computer Identics officials have met with Imtec executives during the past two weeks at Eberstadt-Fleming's request. 
He said the firm has requested more information on Imtec to help it evaluate the possible merger. 

   Eberstadt-Fleming Inc. declined to comment on the filing. 
Imtec officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Computer Identics posted a loss of $1.9 million on sales of $6.6 million. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Computer Identics shares closed at $1.75, up 25 cents.
