   The Supreme Court, knocking out one of the last restraints on advertising by lawyers, ruled that lawyers have a First Amendment right to solicit clients through targeted mailings to individuals known to have legal problems. 

   By a 6-3 vote, the high court ruled that states can't adopt total bans on targeted, direct-mail solicitation by lawyers. 
The decision involved a Kentucky rule, but according to the American Bar Association, 25 states prohibit this kind of mail solicitation. 

   The decision, written by Justice William Brennan, effectively renders unconstitutional a suggested rule for lawyer solicitation adopted by the ABA in 1983 as part of a proposed code of conduct. 
The ABA code isn't binding on states, but it is an influential model. 

   The ABA commission that drafted the code initially recommended allowing targeted mail solicitation, but the ABA's policy-making arm, the house of delegates, voted to ban such mailings, according to Geoffrey Hazard, a Yale University Law School professor who helped draft the original code. 

   The code bars in-person solicitation entirely. 
It permits general, mass-mail solicitation that isn't aimed specifically at persons known to need a lawyer. 
But it bars mailings to prospective clients whom the lawyer doesn't know, but who are known to need a lawyer's help, when the principal motive is financial gain. 

   The decision yesterday involved only targeted solicitation by mail. 
The justices didn't imply any change in their view, reflected in a 1978 decision, that states are free to ban entirely in-person solicitation. 

   Stephen Gillers, a New York University Law School professor, said the justices are unlikely to reconsider the ban on personal solicitation. 
"The specter of ambulance-chasing is still very strong," he said. 

   Although the ruling discussed targeted mailings in general, the practice can take many forms. 
In the form most widely criticized by the legal establishment, lawyers have sent overnight mailings to the families of persons killed or injured in plane crashes or other disasters, offering to help them sue for damages. 

   The latest ruling completes a series of decisions begun in 1977, when the high court ruled that some newspaper advertising by lawyers is protected by the First Amendment and can't be banned by states. 
Before 1977, states' rules barred lawyers from advertising or soliciting clients. 

   The Supreme Court has okayed a growing array of advertising and other practices since 1977, giving states the right to guard against false or misleading statements. 
Criticism has escalated, with retired Chief Justice Warren Burger and parts of the legal establishment suggesting that these practices are unseemly. 
But the use of ads, brochures, public relations firms and mailings has increased widely, even with some old-line, established firms. 

   The Kentucky case involved a lawyer's letter to be mailed to persons against whom home foreclosure lawsuits had been filed. 
The letter offered "free information on how you can keep your home." 
State bar officials said Kentucky's rules for lawyers barred use of the letter, although it wasn't false or misleading. 
The Kentucky Supreme Court in 1986 then replaced its old rule with the ABA rule, but the lawyer still wasn't allowed to send the letter. 

   Yesterday, the Supreme Court said targeted mailings don't present any of the dangers of in-person solicitation, such as invasion of privacy and exertion of undue influence. 

   The court said that states may continue to monitor what lawyers are doing by requiring that they file copies of mailings and advertisements with a state agency. 

   Justice Sandra O'Connor dissented, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia. 
They said the restrictions on advertising and solicitation serve to remind lawyers that theirs is a profession, not "a trade or occupation like any other." 

   Yesterday, Robert MacCrate, ABA president, said, "We will undertake promptly to develop the most effective standard we can devise to protect the consumer consistent with today's ruling."
