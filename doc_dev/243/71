Now might not be a good time to start reading Tolstoy, since there is only
one day to go before the world ends.
'Jesus will come in the feast of trumpet' on October 28 1992 according to an
advert in USA Today International, paid for by the COC Mission from South
Korea.
The Mission cites several biblical quotations as authority, notably the
reference to the 'strengthening of the EC as economic giant' apparently to
be found in Daniel chapter 2, verses 40-43.
Turning to the King James' version, one finds no reference to Jacques
Delors. Instead, the passage begins 'And the fourth kingdom shall be strong
as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and
as iron breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.' The verse
is about as clear as an EC directive.
Never mind nit-picking. You will want to know how to prepare for the end of
the world. 'Make sure the grace of blood of the cross' says the Mission
(grammar will presumably go out of fashion after Armageddon) and 'give up
your fleshly life'. But most important, the Mission commands 'Do not receive
the mark 666, bar code on the forehead or right hand]' Sounds tricky, but
most of us might just about manage it.
