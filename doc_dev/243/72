Canada's Moore Corporation has taken a big step towards shifting its
emphasis from paper forms to more sophisticated information-handling systems
by selling the bulk of its stake in Toppan Moore, Japan's biggest
business-forms supplier.
Moore will receive Y34.4bn (Dollars 343m) from the sale of 35 per cent of
Toppan Moore to its Japanese partner, Toppan Printing. The deal, which will
be completed early next year, will raise Toppan's stake in the joint venture
to 90 per cent, leaving Moore with 10 per cent.
Toppan Moore has contributed an average of 10 cents a share over the past
three years to Moore's annual earnings, which totalled USDollars 82.2m, or
83 cents a share, in the first nine months of 1994.
Moore had planned to reduce its stake in Toppan Moore through a public share
offering in Japan, but that was expected to take up to two years. 'We have
got the same deal, dealing directly with Toppan,' Ms Shoba Khetrapal, Moore
treasurer, said yesterday.
Moore, which claims to be the world's largest supplier of business forms, is
undergoing a shake-up spearheaded by Mr Reto Braun, who took over as chief
executive in late 1993. The Toronto-based company unveiled a new business
plan earlier this year to keep abreast of the shift from paper to electronic
information sources.
It aims to concentrate on three businesses: forms and form-management
systems; labelling systems, including bar-codes; and customer
communications, such as direct mail.
The proceeds of the Toppan Moore sale will be used for acquisitions in these
fields, including further investments in Japan and other Asian countries.
Moore recently bought a 60 per cent stake in a new information-handling
systems joint venture in China. Its partner is Shanghai Jielong Industry
Corporation.
As part of its new strategy, Moore has also bought a 20 per cent stake in
JetForm, an Ottawa-based specialist in electronic forms technology, and has
formed an alliance with Datamax of Orlando, Florida, to develop a thermal
bar-code printer for linerless labels.
Mr Braun aims to expand revenues by 10 per cent a year for the next five
years, with more than half the growth coming from alliances and
acquisitions. Moore's sales totalled almost Dollars 1.8bn in the period
January-September 1994.
