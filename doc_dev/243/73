FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Moore transforms its approach -
New chief executive is spearheading shake-up

The occupants of Moore Corporation's executive suite atop one of Toronto's
tallest office towers would have felt quite out of place little more than a
year ago.
The 116-year old company was coasting on its long record as the world's
biggest supplier of paper forms used by almost every business.
A balance sheet with virtually no debt and a steady flow of revenues from
products as varied as credit-card slips, cash-register receipts and train
tickets had lulled Moore into a complacency not uncommon among
well-entrenched market leaders.
This month it reported nine-month net profits of USDollars 82.2m, or 83
cents a share, up from Dollars 60.6m, or 61 cents.
In spite of being one of Canada's biggest companies, with 22,000 employees
and annual revenues of Dollars 2.3bn, Moore saw no need for a public
relations department. Staff turnover was exceptionally low. The chief
executive had been with the company for 34 years and the chief financial
officer for 43.
However, the leisurely atmosphere has evaporated since Mr Reto Braun took
over as chief executive in September 1993.
'This year, more things are happening than in the past 20,' says Swiss-born
Mr Braun, who spearheaded a top-to-toe shake-up at Unisys, the US computer
and defence electronics company.
He has hired a new chief financial officer from Northern Telecom, the
Canadian telephone equipment maker. The new head of the business systems
division is a former McKinsey &amp; Co consultant who also worked for Mitel,
another Canadian phone equipment supplier.
Recruits from the computer and telecommunications industry give a clue to an
even bigger change. While paper will continue to play a role in business
records and transactions for the foreseeable future, many traditional
business forms now comprise words and lines on a computer screen.
The speed and accessibility of electronic data allow companies to use the
information on these forms for an increasing number of purposes. Labels,
another Moore staple, are being transformed by bar-codes into part of
elaborate data management systems.
Companies are also demanding a wider range of services from suppliers. 'The
customer doesn't just want a product any more,' Mr Braun says. 'He wants a
solution to his problem.'
Mr Braun's credo is that if a chief executive needs to inflict pain, it
should be done quickly, but fairly. In the 14 months since he took over,
Moore has chopped about 2,000 jobs and closed six plants. A Dollars 229m
restructuring charge, taken at the end of 1993, drained away 14 per cent of
the company's equity.
The long-term aim is to transform Moore from a supplier of business forms
into a provider of a much wider range of information-handling products and
services.
It will concentrate on three businesses: forms and form-management systems;
labelling systems, including bar-codes; and customer communications, such as
direct mail.
In each case, Mr Braun is targeting only a handful of sectors. For instance,
the customer communications division will aim primarily at publishers and
retailers. The labels business will be directed mainly at manufacturers, the
transport sector and retailers.
'We have to sell earlier and higher in the sales cycle,' Mr Braun says.
Instead of dealing with purchasing managers, he wants the company to do more
of its business with chief financial officers and marketing executives.
For example, Moore has helped SNCF, the French railway group, design a new
reservations system with a magnetic-strip ticket. In addition to being a
travel voucher, each ticket provides real-time information on a passenger's
movements. SNCF uses this data to adjust routes, trains, seats and fares. On
the customer-communications side, Moore has won a contract from a US hotel
chain to produce a colour brochure, with a common theme but a different
version for each hotel.
Mr Braun aims to expand revenues by 10 per cent a year for the next five
years, with more than half the growth coming from alliances and acquisitions
which broaden Moore's horizons.
Such expansion is typified by Moore's recent purchase of a 20 per cent stake
in JetForm Corporation, an Ottawa-based specialist in electronic forms
technology.
formed an alliance with Datamax of Orlando, Florida, to develop a thermal
bar-code printer for liner-less labels.
Another sign of the 'new' Moore is a Dollars 1bn two-way deal with EDS, the
US computer-services and management consultancy. EDS is designing, and will
later operate, Moore's internal data-processing system. For its part, Moore
will manage EDS's own printing and other information handling requirements.
The risk, however, is that some products and services may be ahead of their
time. One Moore executive says that 'a lot of customers know they want it,
but they're not certain how they're going to use it'. But people no longer
hang such epithets as 'stodgy' or 'venerable' on Moore these days.
The transformation is set to advance further. Moore plans to raise Dollars
400m to Dollars 500m in debt, lifting its debt-to-equity ratio from an
ultra-conservative 6 per cent to about 25 per cent.
It is preparing a public offering of shares in Toppan Moore, the big
Japanese forms company which Moore owns jointly with Toppan Printing.
Mr Braun took another step this month which would have been unthinkable
under the old guard. He hired Moore's first vice-president of communications
to help get the message across that a leopard can change its spots.
