   Centel Information Systems, a unit of Centel Corp. of Chicago, won a $100 million contract to provide automated mail-forwarding equipment to the U.S. Postal Service. 

   Postal officials said the new machines, which will be installed in 224 major postal facilities, are expected to save the agency $77 million during their first year of full operation. 
Delivery of the equipment is scheduled to begin by the end of this year and be completed by July 1990. 

   The new system is designed to reduce the manual handling of mail forwarded to customers who have moved to new addresses. 
Last year the Postal Service forwarded 3.2 billion pieces of mail. 
The new equipment will automatically apply the correct address and nine-digit ZIP code to letter mail, which will then be sorted by computerized machines. 

   It also will automatically print out new addresses and ZIP codes for packages and larger envelopes, but these labels will be applied manually. 
Currently, postal clerks must type a code into a computer, which then prints the address label. 
Then another worker must place the label on both letters and packages. 

   Separately, the agency's Board of Governors approved procedural changes to allow customers to mail materials on a collect-on-delivery basis via overnight Express Mail. 
The service will be available July 26, and will allow recipients of Express Mail packages to pay by either cash or check.
