   Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy Ltd., says it
wants to sell Spectra-Physics Corp., the world's largest maker of
lasers and a company Ciba-Geigy won just two years ago in a
takeover fight.
   Spectra-Physics, a leading manufacturer of the scanners that
read bar codes in groceries and retail stores, is likely to benefit
from new ownership willing to invest more in the company, a
spokesman for Ciba-Geigy and analysts said Tuesday.
   But the announcement was met by stinging criticism from San
Jose-based Spectra-Physics' founder and former president, Herbert
M. Dwight Jr., who left last year to head Superconductor
Technologies Inc. of Santa Barbara.
   ``It's just a tragedy that Spectra-Physics could fall prey to a
hostile takeover from a company that doesn't have the stomach to
make the investments'' needed to expand, Dwight said.
   Ciba-Geigy, a $12 billion-a-year company, plans to focus on its
core businesses in drugs, agriculture and chemicals and reduce its
involvement in electronics, chairman Alex Krauer said.
   But Sam Isaly, a pharmaceutical industry analyst with the firm
Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, speculated the real reason for the
reversal was is a combination of several developments.
   ``There was a change in top management at Ciba since the
interest in Spectra-Physics was first taken,'' he said. ``The new
fellows completed the purchase (for $227 million) but that was
pretty much put in place by their predecessors.
   ``The new management has a somewhat different vision of the
company,'' Isaly said.
   The old management wanted to diversify, Isaly said, partly
because the outlook for their core businesses was ``tenuous''
earlier in the 1980s, with few new products. Now those businesses
are picking up and the outlook for new products is good.
   ``So the improving outlook for core businesses plus the change
in management led them to reconsider staying in the kind of
businesses Spectra-Physics is in,'' he said.
   In addition to divesting Spectra-Physics by mid-1990, Ciba-Geigy
plans to sell Swiss-based Gretag, an electronics and photofinishing
equipment maker, and a 37 percent stake in 3-D Systems, a maker of
stereo-lithography technology.
   Ciba-Geigy plans to retain its Mettler-Toledo unit, a $625
million-a-year maker of electronic weighing equipment, because that
company can sustain itself without further investments, a spokesman
said.
   No price tag has been set on the companies for sale, but Isaly
said Spectra-Physics might be worth about $300 million.
   Ciba, with $900 million in profits last year, had plenty of
money to invest but apparently didn't want to commit large sums to
Spectra-Physics' research and product development, Isaly said.
   Along with bar code scanners, Spectra-Physics makes medical
instruments, graphics equipment and measuring devices, including a
fingerprint detector so sensitive it can ``see'' prints inside of
gloves.
   ``Spectra-Physics is a very fast-growing business that requires
substantial investments to sustain the continued growth,'' said
Ciba spokesman Tom Chizmadia. ``It wasn't a matter of not being
able to meet that; it was just more of a strategic shift.''
   The sale has nothing to do with Spectra-Physics' profitability,
Chizmadia said. Since 1987, sales have grown about 16 percent a
year to $296 million in 1988 and an expected $327 million this
year, and the company has been profitable every quarter.
   Ciba-Geigy took over Spectra-Physics in 1987 after a six-month
battle with Reliance Financial Services Corp., which is controlled
by takeover specialist Saul Steinberg.
   Krauer said one of Ciba-Geigy's ``primary objectives is to find
the right home for Spectra-Physics.''
   ``Because we intend to sell Spectra-Physics in its entirety to a
company with a long-term strategic commitment to the electronics
industry, the sale should have no adverse impact on Spectra-Physics
employees,'' he said. ``In fact, the sale should create new growth
opportunities for employees.''
   The company has 3,100 employees worldwide.
