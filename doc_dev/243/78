   After years of sitting back and waiting for 90
percent of the television audience to automatically tune in to their
new fall shows, the networks have had a rude awakening.
   The audiences, faced with an ever-increasing number of
entertainment choices, aren't automatically tuning in. The networks
now have to work to win them over, and that has spawned an
unprecedented burst of promotional innovation for the 1989-90 season.
   Come fall, folks stopping in for a pizza will also receive an ABC
promo tape. Shoppers can buy a blank Scotch videotape and get an NBC
featurette, visit K mart and be greeted by CBS displays, go to a
movie and see a commercial for ABC. Demonstrator television sets in
Sears stores will be tuned to NBC, and Maxell tape packages will
include pitches for CBS.
   Last season, the three-network share of the television audience
dropped to 67 percent, from 71 percent the previous season. Those
A.C. Nielsen Co. figures reflect inroads by cable, independent
channels and videocassette rentals in the last decade that have
eroded the networks' traditional combined share that ranged up to 90
percent in the 1970s.
   This summer and fall, the networks' promotional ploys range from
look-alike ``news'' reports on upcoming shows to marketing tie-ins
with retail outlets and videotape manufacturers _ on the assumption
that viewers will buy the tapes to record the network's shows.
   Mark Zakarin, vice president for marketing for ABC Entertainment,
calls the new network strategy ``guerrilla marketing.''
   ``These used to be easy jobs,'' he said. ``Used to be all you had
to do was do your own on-air advertising and plunk an ad in TV Guide
a couple of times.
   ``As our audience fragments,'' said Zakarin, ``we gotta go out
and find them wherever they are.''
   ABC plans to take out ads in TV Guide again this fall _ with a
difference. During the month of November _ when important local
affiliate ratings are measured _ ABC's ads will include bar codes,
similar to product price codes. The codes can be read by programming
``wands'' included with some Panasonic videocassette recorders. Run
the wand over the bar code in the ad for, say, ``thirtysomething,''
and the machine is programmed to record it. ABC figures there are
800,000 such VCRs in viewers' homes.
   CBS previously announced a promotional partnership with K mart
Corp., and NBC followed suit with Sears, Roebuck and Co. ABC is
still looking for a retail partner, but has other promotional plans,
including the first-ever network commercial in movie theaters _ a
60-second promo for its fall lineup that will begin running in 5,000
theaters in August.
   CBS plans to run on its own airwaves ``CBS Spotlites,''
advertisements designed to resemble news breaks, that feature
reports on stars of upcoming CBS shows.
   All three networks have cross-promotions involving videotapes.
   CBS has joined Maxell in a marketing strategy that will include a
plug for Maxell in CBS' fall print advertising. A circular promoting
CBS shows will be included in Maxell videotape packages.
   ``This is our way of pointing out to viewers that they need not
miss any CBS programs _ they can tape them on Maxell,'' said CBS
Vice President George Schweitzer.
   But purchasers of 3M-Scotch videotapes will get a pitch to record
NBC shows. Purchasers of five-packs of Scotch videocassettes will
receive a one-hour, NBC-produced promotional video, ``Behind the
Scenes at America's Favorite Network.'' A coupon in single-cassette
packages will offer the video for $5.95. Scotch packages will also
include a printed insert promoting NBC's fall schedule.
   ABC is participating in a promotional video distribution that
also involves HBO and Paramount productions. One million promotional
videos will be handed out to Pizza Hut customers.
   CBS and NBC's retailer tie-ins, meanwhile, involve
cross-promotion in print and television ads, plus in-store displays
enticing shoppers to enter contests with prizes of cars, video
equipment, vacations _ even, in NBC's case, a guest shot on a
prime-time show.
   Stay tuned. Come the fall, the networks will find out if anyone's
buying.
