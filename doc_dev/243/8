   The Postal Service awarded Westing house Electric Corp. a $33 million contract for bar-code sorters. 

   The contract calls for the Pittsburgh company's Westinghouse Electronic Systems Group to produce 211 sorters, to be delivered from September 1990 through October 1991. 
The pact was the first hardware contract awarded to Westinghouse, the agency said. 

   The machines will separate as many as 40,000 letters an hour, sorting them by electronically scanning a bar-code representation of the ZIP code on the face of the envelope. 
Sorters separate mail, previously bar coded by business mailers, into 96 channels, according to ZIP code areas.
