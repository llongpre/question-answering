CENTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     And just about all other mail will cost more, too.;    The new rates were
imposed after nearly a year of study and hearings.;    Special "F" stamps
depicting a flower are available at post offices to cover the new rate until
official 29-cent stamps can be printed.;    A new 27-cent stamp for paying
bills was approved but put on hold, probably until June. It will give a 2-cent
discount to those paying monthly bills using specially prepared envelopes that
contain bar codes -- lines like those used in grocery stores for pricing -- so
that the mail can be sorted by machine. These will be used mainly on reply
envelopes supplied by business for people to send back payments or orders.;   
The new rate was delayed to familiarize consumers about the unprecedented
two-tiered rate structure for first-class letters, Postmaster General Anthony
M. Frank said.  </TEXT>
