<LEADPARA>  Levi Strauss &amp; Co. has always been prominent for its jeans and a rich
California heritage dating to Gold Rush days. Now the company has another
claim to fame: It's proving that much-maligned leveraged buyouts can be
stunningly successful.;    While the economy is in a recession and many
apparel makers and retailers are struggling to survive, Levi Strauss is
sashaying like a top-flight fashion model. Paced by a 180-degree turnaround in
its international business, the appeal of Dockers pants and a wide assortment
of new jeans, the company reported a record $4.2 billion in sales in fiscal
1990, a $600 million increase.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "There aren't many apparel companies that even do $600 million in sales,"
boasts Levi Strauss President Tom Tusher.;    The year-over-year gain, 17
percent, was the largest in a decade, and it was coupled with a 14 percent
increase in operating income. Levi Strauss has already repaid more than
two-thirds of its $1.5 billion leveraged buyout loan, putting it seven years
ahead of its repayment schedule.;    Back in the mid-1980s, Levi Strauss was
moving backward. A strong dollar had depressed international sales, and the
company botched a diversification drive aimed at cutting dependence on the
shrinking U.S. jeans market.;    Things came to a head in 1985, when the
world's largest apparel maker reported a $114 million loss, and descendants of
the company's founder took the company private in a deal that valued it at
$1.84 billion. The family wanted to restructure the company away from Wall
Street's spotlight to avoid the possibility of a hostile takeover. "We lost
track of why we had been successful," recalls Robert Haas, Levi Strauss' lanky
chairman, chief executive and great-great-grand-nephew of Levi Strauss
himself.;    A return to basics isn't the only reason Levi Strauss is
prospering again. It has become an enshrined piece of Americana abroad, and
its innovative use of computers in manufacturing and distribution stands out
in an industry infamous for its instinctual, seat-of-the-pants approach to
business. Most of all, though, Levi Strauss managed to find the time to refine
the art of "psychographics" -- the study of different types of consumers and
what each wants -- to a science.;    "The company is excellent at targeting
demographic and lifestyle segments," says Tom Mandel, a director at SRI
International's Values and Lifestyle program in Menlo Park. "This allows it to
offer different products for different groups and different advertisements for
different products, all of which maximizes its positioning.;    "Essentially,
Levi Strauss has built a personal relationship between itself and its
customers. It makes products that fit in nicely with the way they live.";   
Consider the success of the Dockers line, which was introduced late in 1986.
Last year, these loose-fitting, cotton chino pants, aimed at men age 25 to 45,
garnered $600 million in sales. That makes them arguably the most successful
line of apparel ever introduced. Such pants have been around for decades, but
not in a wide array of colors, not in specialized display areas at major
department store chains and not supported with $30 million in annual
advertising. Levi Strauss figured Dockers were a natural for aging baby
boomers who had grown up wearing Levi's jeans.;    Meanwhile, the company has
hardly forsaken jeans, even though total U.S. jeans sales plummeted from a
peak of 525 million pairs in 1981 to 397 million in 1990. Levi's original 501s
still account for a quarter of Levi Strauss sales in the United States. What's
new is that the company was the first to realize that the secondhand jeans
look that became popular in Europe in recent years was a natural to stimulate
business domestically.;    Not just standard jeans;  As recently as 1985,
standard blue jeans accounted for 60 percent of Levi Strauss' total jeans
sales. Now their share of the pie has shrunk to only 12 percent, company
officials say. Today, Levi Strauss relies overwhelmingly on sales of
"stone-washed" jeans and jeans with 14 other abraded finishes and on the sale
of colored jeans and black jeans. The company has also benefited from the
relatively recent introduction of looser-fitting jeans, such as Levi's 550s.; 
  "You have to keep your product line fresh and focused," says Roy Schiefner,
Levi Strauss' manager of development for men's jeans. "Otherwise, why would
consumers buy anything from you?";    This sentiment really became clear only
in hindsight, Levi Strauss executives admit. The genesis of the company's woes
dated to the early 1980s, when demographic studies underscored that jeans
sales would tumble and the company nervously began scratching around for
solutions. The answer seemed to lie in a major expansion into new merchandise
lines, such as women's wear, sports clothing and men's sports jackets.;   
Levi Strauss signed licensing or joint venture agreements with manufacturers
of such clothing and moved a number of its key executives away from its core
jeans business and into top spots overseeing the new ventures in the United
States and overseas.;    The strategy was catastrophic. Levi Strauss falsely
assumed that the jeans business could essentially run itself -- and that
executives who knew jeans could parlay their experience to manage other types
of apparel successfully. "We wound up diluting our management efforts," Tusher
says. "We took our best people and put them into new and marginal businesses
with little training. It didn't work.";    Levi Strauss began re-evaluating
its strategy in 1984 and decided to shift its attention back to its jeans
business and find ways to improve it. In essence, that meant shrinking its
business. (The company still sells non-jeans apparel, but less than half as
much as it did a decade ago.) Levi Strauss closed 26 plants, including one in
San Jose, and laid off 7,000 employees, an especially tough pill for a company
that has always prided itself on innovative employee relations. "The layoffs
were necessary to protect the organization as a whole and the welfare of the
largest number of people," Haas says.;    Today, few people at the company's
red-brick headquarters complex near the Embarcadero mention the hard times
anymore. They dress casually, often in Levi's jeans, and talk enthusiastically
about the company's new suite of employee "empowerment" programs. The recent
spate of summerlike weather already has them chatting happily about the 2
1/2-day weekends all now enjoy annually between Memorial Day and Labor Day.;  
 But people at Levi Strauss also enjoy talking about why their company has
rebounded. Frequently mentioned is the aggressive use of computer networks,
both internally and in partnership with major retailers, and a sharp
resurgence in overseas business, which now accounts for a majority of the
corporation's profits and is expected to keep growing faster than U.S.
business.;    Levi Strauss now relies heavily on computer-integrated
manufacturing at its 45 plants in the United States and overseas. Until
recently, production workers completed batches of work and noted their
progress on little tickets collected twice a day and eventually fed into a
computer system. Delays in computerizing the data sparked problems. Managers
never had a good idea of the precise status of production and factory
employees, who are paid under a piecework system, never were sure how much
they were earning.;    Controlling the work flow;  To remedy the situation,
the company has been installing factory systems that include terminals and
bar-code readers at every workbench. As soon as a batch of work is completed,
the worker passes a bar-code tag over the bar-code reader, immediately
inputting the information in the computer system. This tells employees exactly
how much they just earned and gives managers a precise readout of the flow of
work on the factory floor.;    The $600,000 systems pay for themselves in
terms of increased output within 18 months, says Stephen Levandowski, Levi
Strauss' vice president of information resources. "The cost of making a
garment is a crucial consideration in the apparel industry," he says. "If we
don't keep improving productivity, we don't remain competitive.";    Levi
Strauss also relies on computers in LeviLink, an electronic data interchange
network that allows retailers to instantly reorder popular merchandise after
it is sold -- and have the inventory shipped to their stores in bar-coded
cartons telling them exactly what they're getting.;    KG Men's Stores, a
Denver-based specialty store chain with 13 stores in California, credits
LeviLink with giving the company a substantial increase in profits last
Christmas despite a 2 percent sales decline. Because of the network, KG
employs no receiving personnel, and it was able to keep its stock almost
completely in sync with demand. "We ran with less inventory and absorbed fewer
markdowns," says Robert Mercer, KG's chief information officer.;    Extensive
use of computers and aggressive marketing has also given Levi Strauss a
renewed push overseas. International sales produced 53 percent of the
company's profits last year, up from 43 percent in 1989, and some Levi Strauss
executives project that business overseas will account for as much as 70
percent of profits by mid-decade. The company has already started building its
sixth factory in Europe, in Warsaw, Poland, which will open midyear and have
the capacity to produce 3 million pairs of jeans annually.;    "We see
significant opportunities for our clothing in Eastern Europe and elsewhere,"
says Alan Gregson, Levi Strauss' vice president of finance and planning.
"Demand is soaring overseas for well-known American consumer goods."; WHY LEVI
STRAUSS IS SUCCESSFUL AGAIN; (box)The Dockers line, introduced late in 1986,
last year became a $600 million business. The loose-fitting cotton pants
appeal to aging, heavier baby boomers who grew up wearing Levi's jeans.;
(box)The core jeans business, temporarily put on the back burner as the
company ventured into new lines of apparel, has been reinvigorated. There are
now about 15 types of abraded finishes, plus jeans in a wide array of colors.;
(box)Overseas business is booming. International sales, paced in part by the
perception of Levi's jeans as an American icon, now account for more than half
of the company's profits. Levi Strauss is making especially strong strides in
Europe and in Japan, where it is the second-biggest seller of jeans.;
(box)LeviLink, an electronic data interchange network, allows major retailers
to link their computers with Levi Strauss computers to track sales and
automatically reorder inventory -- and to have inventory shipped to their
stores in bar-coded cartons. This virtually eliminates the need for receiving
personnel.; (box)The company extensively uses computers in manufacturing.
Production managers increasingly know the precise status of factory work
flows, giving them the flexibility to respond promptly to changes in demand.  </TEXT>
