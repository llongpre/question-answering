   Texas Instruments Inc., Dallas, said it introduced a
product that electronically identifies and tracks parts in a
distribution center, animals at a slaughterhouse or equipment
not meant to leave a secure building.
   The product, called the Texas Instruments Registration and
Identification System, comprises a cylindrical device about
the size of a one-inch pencil that can be attached to items
or implanted under an animal's skin, the semiconductor
company said.

   Radio frequency energy emitted from a reading unit powers
a transponder in the small device, which then returns its
factory-programmed identification code to the user. The
device can be read in about one-tenth of a second from a
distance of 20 to 40 inches, the company said.
   The company said the device is its first entry into the
automatic identification systems market, which includes
bar-code readers and data-collection products.
