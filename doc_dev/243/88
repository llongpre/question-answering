   Federal officials should attack the $300
billion business of laundering drug money with steps ranging from a
banking summit to supermarket-style bar codes on $20 bills, a
senator said Thursday.
   ``We hope that the administration will get off the dime and get
moving on this,'' Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., told a news conference
at which he released a wide-ranging report on the laundering of
proceeds of drug sales.
   He recommended a summit between top bankers and officials of the
State and Treasury departments aimed at speeding action. He also
called on the Senate Banking Committee to launch an investigation
of the laundering of cash missing as part of the savings and loan
industry crisis.
   Kerry called for aggressive pursuit of information from foreign
banks ``backed up by the threat of real sanctions,'' adding that
officials should ``look hard'' at allowing banks to keep part of
any laundered money found.
   Banks should be required to know their customers and real names
_ not aliases _ should be required on checks, Kerry said. He said
there should be federal requirements for check cashing operations
such as currency exchanges.
   Some recovered money should be funneled into the effort to
combat crime in high-intensity drug areas, he said, and money
should be stamped with bar codes that would allow computerized
tracking of the flow of currency.
   The report, based on testimony last fall before the Senate
Foreign Relations and Banking Committees, quoted Assistant Treasury
Secretary Salvatore Martoche as estimating that drug revenues total
$300 billion annually, including $110 billion generated in the
United States.
   It said much of the money laundered worldwide comes from
criminal activities other than drug sales, such as loan sharking,
but that narcotics represents a major portion. Laundering is not
always simple, it said.
   For example, $100 billion in $20 bills, a denomination often
used in drug transactions, would weigh 26 million pounds, the
report said.
   ``A money laundering operation in New York shut down earlier
this year required a tractor-trailer to haul away $19 million in
small bills,'' it said.
   The report said the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act is working as a
deterrent to money laundering through American financial
institutions. The measure requires the institutions to report cash
deposits of $10,000 or more.
   However, the report said that drug traffickers ``continue to use
foreign banks and foreign branches of U.S. banks to launder U.S.
drug profits.''
   Switzerland, Canada, the Bahamas, Luxembourg, Panama and Hong
Kong are among the main countries where money is laundered, the
report said, adding that criminals are pushing to develop money
laundering centers in a number of tiny countries, ranging from
Andorra to Vanuatu.
   The report said the government has no policy on control of
international electronic transfers of U.S. funds.
   ``As a consequence, money launderers retain a choice of methods
to conceal their laundered funds through international wire
transfers, including informal channels involving Fax machines,
telex, personal computer networks and ordinary telephone
instructions which do not leave the paper trail which would allow
investigators to follow the flow of funds,'' it said.
