   A woman who hoarded thousands of coupons
and raked through the trash to get proofs of purchase for refund
deals faces trial Monday on federal charges of mail fraud and
conspiracy to distribute fake coupons.
   Connie Arvidson, a 34-year-old wife, mother and self-described
``Dumpster lady,'' said she became obsessed over the years in her
quest for special offers through rebates and coupons. But she said
she didn't know the coupons she bought through an advertisement in
a coupon magazine were counterfeit.
   At times, she would pay garbage collectors to retrieve products
that qualified for special offers. At one point, 1,000 liquor
bottles a week soaked in her bathtub to facilitate label-removing
and hundreds of thousands of coupons were jammed into files.
   But it's the coupons, not the refund programs, that have brought
her to the eve of a trial.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Sucsy, who will prosecute the case
in Dallas, where the case originates, would not comment the case
Friday, with the trial so close. But in the past, he has said:
``There is no way she didn't know what she was doing.''
   Mrs. Arvidson and nine others were indicted in June 1989 in
connection with a $2 million counterfeit coupon scam. According to
the indictment, the coupons for food and other products were
printed and distributed nationwide from Texas.
   Mrs. Arvidson is accused of knowingly buying and distributing
fake coupons.
   ``It's like a nightmare that I have to sit in a courtroom with
some of these people I don't even know and see them try to hurt me
for something I never did,'' Mrs. Arvidson said. ``I've just got to
think I'm going to come home and be with my little girl.''
   The trial of Mrs. Arvidson, along with two San Antonio men named
in the indictment, is expected to last a week. The charges against
David Rees and James Floyd Richards of conspiracy to commit mail
fraud relate to the printing and distribution of the coupons, Sucsy
said.
   The seven others, the man accused of advertising the coupons and
six accused of purchasing them from him through the mail, have made
plea bargains, Sucsy said Friday.
   Mrs. Arvidson said she and other refunders had joked that the
coupons might be stolen. But she believed the ad was legitimate
since it was in magazines.
   ``If I'm guilty of anything, then maybe I'm guilty of accepting
stolen goods,'' she said.
   And by stolen, she says, she thought the coupons might have been
taken from Dumpsters. She plans to bring to court as evidence of
Dumpster ``treasures'' three large rolls, each containing 10,000
bar code strips for light bulbs.
   Mrs. Arvidson said got the bar code strips, which could be used
as proofs of purchase, by trading with a woman who plucked them
from a Dumpster behind the light bulb factory. In return, the woman
got material qualifying the sender for rebates from a diaper
manufacturer.
   ``In refunding, I quit being surprised,'' Mrs. Arvidson said.
``I found anything could happen in refunding.''
   She said her ``little job'' brought her satisfaction and she
became known in the world of refunding. Mrs. Arvidson estimates she
made $200 a week at her rebating peak. On top of that, she paid
little for groceries because of coupons.
   ``I got known as the `diaper, Exxon, Seagram Cooler lady,'''
Mrs. Arvidson said about the proofs of purchase that she
accumulated and then rebated, traded or sold to other refunders.
   ``Everybody loves you if you have something,'' she said.
``Nobody wants to know you if you have nothing. That's what it's
like in refunding.''
   Mrs. Arvidson said she has little left: Her husband has gotten
disability payments after a car wreck but is no longer employed and
she's filed for bankruptcy.
   Mrs. Arvidson said that although others accused in the coupon
scam have made plea bargains, she won't.
   ``They wanted to give me 18 months in jail. I said, `That's
ridiculous, I didn't do anything.'''
   She faces up to 30 years in prison plus $1.5 million in fines,
if convicted on all charges.
