   First-class letters will probably cost 28 to 32
cents to mail in three years and could include an 11-digit zip code
by the turn of the century, says the postmaster general.
   Increased automation and other economies at the U.S. Postal
Service will most likely keep price increases for mailing a letter
below inflation after 1991, Postmaster General Anthony Frank said
Monday.
   Speaking at the opening of a three-day convention of major
Northeastern large-volume mailers, Frank said the actual increase
for a first-class stamp by 1991 might be 5 cents, to a total of 30
cents.
   ``I'll point out that 5 cents is a 20 percent increase in three
years, which is more or less the amount that the costs have gone up
over the last three years,'' Frank said.
   The cost of mailing a first-class letter rose from 22 cents to 25
cents in the spring of 1988. An increase in 1991 would continue the
recent policy of increases every three years.
   Frank said that after running a surplus last fiscal year, the
postal service will be hard pressed to break even in the current
year and faces the greatest deficit in its existence, up to $1.7
billion, in fiscal 1990.
   Automation will cost the postal service $4 billion between now
and 1995 but will save having to hire 100,000 workers, he said.
   New machines exist that can scan nine miles of mail an hour and
can spot a bar code anywhere on the face of an envelope, even one
sandwiched into a cluttered address block or placed amid graphics
and colorful designs.
   Scanners now in use at post offices can pick up a bar code only
on the lower right hand side of an envelope, isolated from the
address block and other print.
   Frank said the postal service wants to have nine-digit bar coding
on all mail by 1995 and will begin testing an 11-digit code.
   With the current nine-digit code, the so-called ZIP plus 4, a
piece of mail is automatically sorted to one or another side of a
specific street in a given locale.
   The 11-digit code would sort a letter down to the building
address, in effect stacking the mail in delivery sequence for a
carrier at the destination.
   Businesses that code their own mail would get substantial postage
discounts, Frank said.
