   WASHINGTON -- Putting expected new postal rates into
effect will require some scrambling by the Postal Service.
   The agency already has printed eight billion stamps that
could serve as a temporary 29-cent stamp. Designated "F" (the
service already has used "A" through "E" for previous
transitions to higher rates), the stamps picture a tulip.

   Also on hand are 1.85 billion new "makeup" stamps, which
mailers could use as four-cent stamps, adding them to
existing 25-cent ones they have already bought.
   The Postal Rate Commission's recommendation for another
new first-class rate, 27 cents for persons who pay their
bills by return envelopes with bar codes already provided by
companies that do the billing, caught the service unprepared.
But it says there are plenty of two-cent stamps-some
commemorating Mary Lyon, founder of Mount Holyoke women's
college in Massachusetts, and others showing a 1870s railroad
locomotive -- available to affix to envelopes along with
25-centers.
   If approved by the Postal Service's Board of Governors,
the new rates will take effect Feb. 3. By mid-March, the
service said, it could start selling 27-cent and 29-cent
stamps and fully meet mailer needs for the new stamps by the
end of April.
