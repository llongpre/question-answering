   Seventy-five years after the nation was
introduced to Form 1040, Americans are closing another
return-filing season with several million taxpayers apparently
putting off the chore until the Monday midnight deadline.
   The Internal Revenue Service promised that its walk-in offices
would remain open on the final day until every taxpayer with a
question was served. The Postal Service went out of its way to
receive returns and make sure they were postmarked before midnight.
   Taxpayers were given an extra two days to file because the April
15 deadline fell on Saturday. Residents of New England and most of
New York state have until Tuesday midnight because Monday is a
legal holiday, Patriot's Day, in Massachusetts, site of the IRS
service center that receives returns from those states.
   Neither the IRS nor the Postal Service had a firm estimate on
how many people delayed filing until the last day. The IRS said
only that it expects to receive about 18 million returns this week,
which would include those filed over the weekend. About 14 million
reached the IRS last week.
   The tax agency projects more than 109 million returns will be
filed this year _ but not all those will meet the deadline:
   _Around 6 million couples and individuals will take four-month
extensions, to Aug. 15, by filing Form 4868 along with a check for
the taxes they estimate they owe. The extension is only for filing
_ not for paying.
   _A sizable number of the 650,000 Americans living and working
abroad qualify for automatic two-month extensions without filing
any special form or paying estimated taxes.
   _Some taxpayers don't operate on a calendar year and, thus, have
different filing deadlines.
   _And some will simply miss the filing deadline, despite the fact
that such tardiness can bring a penalty for not filing on time _
even if there is no tax due _ and additional and more severe
penalties for not filing and paying on time if there is tax due.
   ``Of the 109 million-plus returns anticipated this year, we
expect about 100 million will file during the regular season,''
said IRS spokesman Frank Keith.
   Monday midnight also is the deadline for taxpayers to file
amended 1985 returns. That is an important point for up to 1.5
million people, mainly pensioners, who may have overpaid taxes for
that year because they failed to claim a credit for withheld taxes.
   The IRS has since changed a policy that barred employees from
pointing out such overpayments.
   When the first individual returns were filed in 1914, they
numbered only 358,000, identifying as taxpayers or dependents
considerably less than 1 percent of the population. The returns
covered taxes totaling $28 million, a figure so insignificant by
modern federal standards that it would show up as an asterisk in
budget documents.
   The returns being filed this year represent more than 90 percent
of the population and will reflect taxes of about $425 billion.
   The 1988 returns are the first filed under the three-tax-rate
structure that was enacted as the keystone of the 1986 tax
overhaul. Those three rates _ 15 percent for all the taxable income
of the majority of taxpayers, 28 percent for most others, and 33
percent for a relatively few _ represent one of the few significant
tax-law changes from last filing season.
   Nevertheless, an IRS sampling of early returns showed taxpayers
making the same mistakes that plagued last year's filings: writing
down the wrong tax liability figure from the tax tables; claiming
the wrong standard deduction; failing to check the box on Form
1040A or 1040EZ that indicates whether a person may be claimed as a
dependent by another, and mathematical errors.
   The IRS cautioned taxpayers to make sure returns are signed and
that the perjury oath above the signature is not altered. The
envelope in which a return is mailed must carry the correct postage
or the Postal Service will not accept it.
   Processing of a return and of any refund due is expedited if
taxpayers use the bar-coded envelopes and the peel-off labels that
were mailed out by the IRS.
