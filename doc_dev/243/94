FT  25 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Post haste for barcoded mail

The Royal Mail is planning to extend to the whole of the UK a scheme - at
present on trial among a number of its larger customers - which promises
dramatically to simplify mail addressing and sorting.
The scheme initially involves adding extra characters to existing postcodes
so that each code will identify a single, unique address.
The nub of the Royal Mail development, however, is the transformation of the
extended postcode into a new kind of barcode which can be read by special
electronic scanners at rates of up to 30,000 items an hour. It is thought
the target for completing the conversion is the early part of next year. The
barcodes will be chiefly of benefit to high volume, bulk mail customers.
Mailsort customers who presort their post already qualify for a 2 per cent
discount for barcoding 30,000 items or more.
Conventional barcodes, widely used on products and packaging in industry and
commerce, comprise printed columns of bars of varying width. These can be
read optically to yield information about the product or contents.
The Royal Mail barcodes are different in form, consisting of patterns of
lines of varying length which can be printed under control from a personal
computer. One advantage is that the barcode reading machines are able to
recognise the pattern despite the presence of, say, advertising materials on
the packaging.
Barry Jeeves, customer barcoding consultant to the Royal Mail, quoted in the
current issue of the magazine PC Week, says the Mail has essentially
developed its own barcode based on an existing US standard. Conventional
barcodes, he says, were not quick enough. There were problems with low
quality printers and materials.
There are some 25m domestic and business addresses in the UK. Existing
postcodes identify a group of about 15 addresses and are adequate for
existing sorting systems, which are based on machine recognition of
phosphorescent dots printed on the packaging. Customer should benefit
greatly from keying in a nine character barcode instead of several lines of
address.
