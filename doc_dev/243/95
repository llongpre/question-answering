   It was just a little printing error, but as
many as 566,000 couples and individuals have been told to send
their federal tax returns to the wrong address.
   It's no big deal, says the Internal Revenue Service, and it
won't delay refunds.
   ``This shouldn't present a problem for the IRS or for
taxpayers,'' IRS spokesman Steve Pyrek said Tuesday.
   In fact, Pyrek said, if you are one of the Form 1040 filers who
received the wrong envelope in your tax-instruction package, you
may use it as is, correct it or substitute an envelope of your own.
   The IRS says the problem apparently affects only about 0.5
percent of the 107 million tax-return packages mailed out last
month. Specifically, the wrong envelopes were included only in some
of the kits marked ``Package 1'' in the lower right corner of the
cover, which contain only a 1040 and Schedules A (for deductions)
and B (for interest and dividends).
   The problem has not shown up in 1040A or 1040EZ packages.
   The IRS isn't sure why it happened, but says the improper
envelopes apparently originated with one of the several private
printers it hires to produce the tax-instruction packages.
   ``We think there was some kind of problem in the list the
printer used to stuff the envelopes into the packages,'' Pyrek
said. ``It's not clear to us yet.''
   The IRS believes the problem envelopes are spread out among
taxpayers in eight of the 10 regions. So far, the agency has heard
of no problem among taxpayers served by the Ogden, Utah, service
center (all the West except Southern California, Hawaii and New
Mexico ) or the Memphis center (Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee).
   How do you know whether the envelope in your package has the
wrong address? Check the list of service-center addresses on page 5
of the 1040 instructions.
   Pyrek said a taxpayer who received a mis-addressed envelope may:
   _Use another envelope.
   _Use the IRS envelope but mark out the wrong address and the
Postal Service bar code.
   _Use the IRS envelope, wrong address and all. That won't delay
any refund, Pyrek said.
   Errors are not unknown at the IRS, which produces nearly 100
different individual tax forms and schedules and dozens of
publications to explain them. Already this year the IRS has
corrected a goof on Form 2441, which parents use to claim a credit
for child-care expenses.
   The form as mailed to taxpayers included a sentence on line 6
reading:
   ``If the result here is zero or less, stop here; you cannot
claim the credit.''
   That sentence should read:
   ``If the result is zero or less, skip lines 7 through 11, enter
zero on line 12 and go to line 13.''
