HINTS FROM HELOISE: THANKSGIVING IS ALSO A TIME FOR EXCHANGING PRESENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I would like to share an idea I used last year for a family 
get-together over the Thanksgiving holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Since all the family would be together during Thanksgiving but not Christmas, I 
thought of having a "turkey tree" with a nice gift for everyone underneath. 
</P>
<P>
I made it from a medium-sized tree branch. I placed the bare branch upright in 
a coffee can, then weighted it down with rocks and sand and put the coffee can 
in a beautiful wicker basket. 
</P>
<P>
Decorating the turkey tree was the fun part, just as it is with a Christmas 
tree. I applied ribbon bows, cross-stitch turkey and Thanksgiving-motif 
ornaments and maple leaves throughout the branches. At the base I placed a 
large table-top turkey decoration and set out all the presents underneath. The 
tree and presents fit nicely on a buffet table top. 
</P>
<P>
After a delicious Thanksgiving dinner we shared our gifts, and it was a most 
enjoyable day. Remember, you can't always gather on Christmas so make a special 
day when your family is lucky enough to be with loved ones. 
</P>

DEAR HELOISE: Last year you had a recipe for a peachy substitute for cranberry 
sauce for Thanksgiving dinner. My family does not like cranberries and I would 
like to make this peach sauce that I think will go well with the turkey dinner. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
DEAR MS. M: The sauce you are referring to is called jelled peach sauce, and it 
is a great alternative to cranberry sauce with the Thanksgiving dinner. 
</P>
<P>
You will need: one large can of peaches, one-half cup of sugar, one-half 
teaspoon of nutmeg and one box of lemon gelatin. 
</P>
<P>
Drain the canned peaches, saving the syrup. Puree the peaches in the blender. 
To the drained peach syrup, add enough water to make one cup of liquid. Pour 
into a sauce pan and add the sugar and nutmeg. Bring mixture to a boil and let 
it boil for about one minute. 
</P>
<P>
Next empty the box of gelatin into a bowl and stir in the hot liquid mixture 
until the gelatin is dissolved. Add pureed peaches and pour into a mold. Chill 
until set. 
</P>
<P>
For those who are watching their weight or must limit their sugar intake, 
substitute diet gelatin and peaches in light syrup or omit the sugar. 
</P>

DEAR HELOISE: For children who like to snap the wishbone of a chicken or turkey 
carcass, a few seconds in the microwave will dry it out immediately. 
</P>
<P>
This is a lot quicker than placing the wishbone on the windowsill and waiting 
three days for it to dry. 
</P>

<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When a stick of butter or margarine is removed from the wrapper, 
measuring a tablespoon can become guesswork. 
</P>
<P>
A hint I found helpful is to score the stick at each marking before removing 
the wrapper. Afterwards, measuring is still accurate.

DEAR HELOISE: In order to take advantage of special offers that demand proof of 
purchase (UPC symbol, the bar code), I have started cutting out the bar code of 
most empty food packages before throwing them out. I then write the name of the 
product on the back and store them all in an envelope until needed. 
</P>
<P>
This saves me time when a special offer is announced and all I have to do is 
look up the correct one.
