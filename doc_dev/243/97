<HEAD>About 4,000 Missing Library Books Returned Anonymously</HEAD>

   Thousands of books whose absence was
undetected by librarians have returned, solving a mystery that
Brown County Library didn't know it had.
   Because the library has yet to complete an automated inventory
system, employees were unaware many of the books had left the
shelves without being checked out, library director Patricia La
Violette said.
   About 4,000 have been returned in a rush of deposits to night
book drops during the past three weeks. Hundreds were left during
the Memorial Day weekend.
   Ms. La Violette said the books began showing up after she got a
telephone call May 8 from a weeping woman. She said the caller
related her mother had died, leaving behind a large number of
stolen library books.
   Ms. La Violette said the woman did not identify herself. The
library declined comment about the book returns for several weeks
because it did not want to discourage the recovery, she said.
   Most of the books are romances, mysteries and popular novels.
Others are hardback non-fiction works.
   Ms. La Violette said more than half the books did not contain
the bar-code stickers used in the library's inventory system,
meaning they were taken before the coding system was established
four years ago.
   She said the library planned to request an electronic security
system even before the books began showing up.
