   Flowers wilt and chocolates get eaten, but
Karl Koy can fashion a more durable gift, one that offers a
personalized Christmas wish, extols a recipient's virtues or takes
a few friendly jabs.
   For $16, Koy will record on a tape cassette a love ballad
commemorating a wedding or anniversary, a tribute to a newborn
child, a birthday ode or a humorous barb.
   ``This is something you can't get anywhere else,'' said Ruby
White of Peoria, who bought a song from Koy's business, Send A
Song, to celebrate the birth of her grandson and another to mark a
friend's recent promotion.
   ``Karl really did a nice job,'' Mrs. White said. ``The girl we
gave it to said she cried when she heard it. I think it's the
greatest gift you can get.''
   Koy came up with the idea for Send A Song a few months ago after
years of submitting topical, humorous songs to radio disc jockeys
around the nation. The songs were satirical looks at world events
and received wide play.
   ``This is a natural evolution of the songs I've been doing in
the past,'' said Koy, 41. ``It was always fun to hear them aired,
but it did nothing for my bank account. This is my attempt to write
songs and make a few bucks at the same time.''
   The enterprise gives Koy a chance to demonstrate his flair for
off-beat and serious song writing.
   Each category of song _ birth, birthday, wedding, anniversary,
achievement and Christmas wish _ has a unique set of words and
music.
   For every customer, Koy incorporates details that make the song
unique to the recipient. Then he plays the melody on his piano,
guitar and synthesizer, and sings most of the songs himself. He
hires a female vocalist upon request.
   He's ready for people who want to send a friend a birthday song
that brings a tear, makes them laugh or really gets under their
skin.
   ``I can be as nice or mean as people prefer on the birthday
songs,'' he said. ``Some of them can be real rock 'em, sock 'em
songs.''
   For a Christmas song from a husband to a wife, he wrote, ``It's
a grand nine years of bliss since we shared our marriage kiss;
there's been travel slides, horse rides, both together side by
side, and more than I can list...''
   Turnaround time on songs is usually about 24 hours.
   ``I bought one for my son's wedding and for the birth of our
grandchild,'' said Bob Weber of Marietta, Ga., who was so impressed
he circulated word of Koy's venture in a business newsletter he
writes.
   ``They're as cute as a button,'' Weber said. ``They're really
unique. It's a good idea. These songs won't wilt and die like
flowers. They won't run out of air like ballons. And it's more
personal than a greeting card.''
