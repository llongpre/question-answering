<LEADPARA>  WHENEVER Michael Feinstein's around, the subject is songs. Songs by the
Gershwins, Rodgers and Hart, Berlin, Kern, Sondheim.;   Feinstein sings and
plays them, relishes them and tells you everything you could ever want to know
about them. Every song has its story, and every story, it seems, is evocative
and memorable.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HE'S PLAYING THEIR SONGS
THE TOP 10 FAVORITE TUNES OF MICHAEL FEINSTEIN  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Theater; At Large  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Feinstein, who used to fascinate small, devoted crowds in San Francisco's
Plush Room just a few years ago, has become a major star, appearing mostly in
theaters. He and pop-music great Rosemary Clooney, a former neighbor, are in
concert now at the Curran Theater through Jan. 5 in a delightful show, "Say It
With Music.";   Backstage, a couple of hours before show time, Feinstein sat
still long enough for me to ask him what somehow had not been covered in our
previous discussions in New York and here. The question: Michael, what are
your 10 favorite songs?;   Feinstein seemed shocked. "There are thousands," he
said. But lists have their limits, and 10 seems to be the number of choice
these days.;   The movie-star-handsome young musician, wearing a college sweat
shirt, smiled, let his eyes roll back and started thinking. "OK," he said,
"but remember these are top-of-the-head. It's what comes to mind first. I know
I'm going to leave something out.";   Fair enough. What's No. 1?;   "Well, in
no special order, the first one I'd say is 'Someone to Watch Over Me.' ";  
Actually, this one would probably top the Feinstein list even if he had weeks
to consider. It has to do with the story behind the selection:;   "I have a
lot of personal memories about this song," Feinstein said. "That gives it
extra poignancy. Ira (Gershwin, with whom Feinstein lived for a time) told me
that he wrote the song (lyric) about himself. It was shortly before his
marriage to Leonore. He felt himself so lucky to win a woman like her.;   "He
never considered himself attractive. He was short, wore glasses, was heavy. It
was (brother) George who was the lady killer. But George never married. In the
last year of his life he asked every woman he met to marry him, including
Paulette Goddard.;   "Anyway, Ira's lyric goes: 'Though he may not be the man
some/Girls think of as handsome/ To my heart he carries the key . . .';  
"That was Ira talking about himself. Gertrude Lawrence sang it in 1926 in 'Oh,
Kay.' ";   "OK," I said. "No. 2?";   This one was a real surprise. Feinstein
picked "Old Friend," a song by Gretchen Cryer and Nancy Ford written for the
1978 feminist musical "I'm Getting My Act Together and Taking It on the
Road.";   "This song is really requested a lot," Feinstein said. "And it
strikes me very deeply. It reflects the lifestyles of the '80s and '90s.
Friendships now are tenuous. The song has poignancy and hope. I like songs
that express hope.";   No. 3 is not exactly a major hit, either. Feinstein
picked "Where Do You Start?" a song by Johnny Mandel and Alan and Marilyn
Bergman. "I introduced it on my 'Isn't It Romantic?' album," he said. "I was
working with Johnny then. He won an Oscar for 'Shadow of Your Smile.' ";  
Frankly, I muttered, I prefer "Isn't It Romantic?" but this isn't my list. So
we headed to No. 4.;   Finally, finally! Feinstein chose a 1932 song by Irving
Berlin, the beautiful "How Deep Is the Ocean?";   "That song is quintessential
Berlin," Feinstein said. "It takes a line that was even then a cliche phrase
and makes it eloquent. Irving Berlin seems to be very simple in his songs, but
it is a deceptive simplicity.";   No. 5 would warm the cockles of Bob Hope's
heart, though it isn't the Hope rendition of "Thanks for the Memory" that
Feinstein loves. The Leo Robin/Ralph Rainger song was in "The Big Broadcast of
1938.";   "I knew Leo Robin," Feinstein said. "He gave me all the multiple
sets of lyrics he wrote for this song. There are so many marvelous verses.";  
And Feinstein sang me one: "Thanks for the memory/massages at the club/That
little tree/ Your Pekingese/Would sniff but never snub . . .";   Feinstein,
once he gets on a lyric, turns very mellow. He mentioned many phrases from the
song that delight him. Such as "Strictly entre nous/And how are all those
little dreams that never did come true . . .";   It looks rather ordinary on
paper, of course. But Feinstein marvels over the insight in the phrase and how
it reaches so many people.;   On to No. 6. It's "I'll Be Seeing You." That's
one the World War II generation would heartily endorse.;   "It's by Sammy Fain
and Irving Kahal," Feinstein told me. "It was actually written in 1938, before
the war, but it became a hit later. Kahal died in 1942, before it all
happened." And Feinstein had another memory.;   "I think I was probably the
last person that Sammy Fain heard sing the song," he said. "I sang it at an
L.A. concert in 1989. And when I finished I asked him to stand up and take a
bow. He died a few months later.";   (Another Sammy Fain song, said Feinstein,
is "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing.");   Song No. 7 is a Richard Rodgers and
Lorenz Hart ballad, "Bewitched (Bothered and Bewildered)," one of the hit
songs from the 1940 musical "Pal Joey.";   "Simply because it's one of Larry
Hart's most brilliant lyrics," Feinstein said.;   It contains the memorable
lines: "I'll sing to him/ Each spring to him/ And worship the trousers that
cling to him." The lines had to be changed for the hit-parade version, when
the song became popular.;   His eighth choice, Feinstein said, is "I Can't Get
Started." It was written by Vernon Duke and Ira Gershwin for the "Ziegfeld
Follies of 1936," where it was sung by Bob Hope and Eve Arden. Feinstein sings
this song with the still-mellifluous Clooney in the current concert show.;  
"There was one rendition of the song by trumpeter Bunny Berigan, who jazzed it
up and sang, 'I still can't not get started with you.' That double negative
drove Ira mad. He didn't want the world to think it was his bad grammar.";  
Another surprise for No. 9. Feinstein picked a Harold Arlen/Yip Harburg song
from "The Wizard of Oz," "If I Only Had a Brain.";   Why this one?;   "The
brilliance of Harburg's lyrics really shines through. Harburg is not well
known today, but he was a genius. The song showed the struggle of the common
man, the kind of man who thinks, 'If only I had this, if only I had that . .
.' I heard Yip sing this song in 1979 at a UCLA tribute to him.";   Which
brings us to No. 10.;   And true to the iconoclastic nature of his list,
Feinstein picked "Blame It On My Youth." This is a melody by Oscar Levant,
better known as a pianist and interpreter of George Gershwin, with a lyric by
Edward Heyman, written in 1934.;   I said that Levant must be feeling good,
wherever he is, to get the recognition.;   "I doubt that," said Feinstein
about the famous hypochondriac. "I never get tired of singing this song. And I
get lots of requests. The song is cynical -- 'If I expected love when first we
kissed/ Blame it on my youth.' It establishes a very sophisticated mood.";  
As does Feinstein whenever we talk. There aren't many others like him. He
dismisses Harry Connick as "not a competitor; he's a jazzer.";   Feinstein is
a throwback to another era, which he has managed to revive. He did it first in
a nightclub act, but now he has developed a bigger voice and a stage presence
that allows him to leave his piano and hold the stage, front and center.;  
Feinstein says that, yes, he would like to write songs, too, but "it's a
separate discipline. I would have to do it full time.";   When he isn't
talking about songs, Feinstein will offer opinions on current songwriters,
those, at least, from his show-tune world. The problem is that there aren't
many of them.;   His opinions are provocative.;   Cy Coleman, who composed the
music for "City of Angels," is "not discriminating," Feinstein said. He thinks
"City of Angels" would have been better as a straight (non-musical) comedy.;  
He says Andrew Lloyd Webber, perhaps the most successful of today's show
composers, "is a man of great potential, but he hasn't realized it yet. Yes,
he is derivative, but other composers have been derivative, too.";   Feinstein
compared "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" with the earlier "Rose Marie, I Love
You" and indeed there are similarities.;   And Stephen Sondheim, the other
current songwriter celebrity?;   "I love a lot of Sondheim," Feinstein said,
"but he's too cerebral for me.";   And so on and so on about this song and
that.;   Sooner or later in concert he touches on one of your own favorites.
Then he treats it as a special child, displaying it lovingly.;   In an age of
heavy metal and pornographic lyrics, you don't get much of that anymore.;
