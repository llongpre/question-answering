   Irving Berlin's songs were so much a part of
America for generations that it would be hard to think of life
without him, his admirers said.
   ``There'll never be another Irving Berlin. It's an era that's
gone,'' said opera singer Robert Merrill, who also sings Berlin's
songs.
   ``He wrote songs for the people,'' Merrill said. ``He was not a
great musician but he had a great ear and he had a feeling for
melody and words that was precious.''
   Berlin, whose most memorable compositions included ``White
Christmas,'' ``Easter Parade'' and ``God Bless America,'' died
Friday night at his home at the age of 101.
   Cabaret singer Bobby Short said he thought Berlin would be
remembered as ``a very, very, very important, very great American
composer. He is perhaps the last of the giants _ and I think that's
not a bad way to go.''
   ``His musicality was constantly astonishing. People who thought
they could pin down the Irving Berlin style would be surprised to
find his newest song a complete turnabout,'' Short said.
   Actress-dancer Ginger Rogers paid tribute to Berlin by humming a
phrase from his ``Cheek to Cheek.''
   ``I'm in heaven,'' she sang sadly in a telephone interview from
her home in Eagle Point, Ore.
   Breaking off to describe the thrill of working with Berlin and
Fred Astaire on the movie ``Top Hat,'' she said: ``It was like
heaven.''
   Miss Rogers recalled the songwriter's kindness when she was first
breaking into show business.
   ``I went into his music company to get some songs,'' she said.
``He had no reason to make charming conversation to me, but he made
very gentle conversation and encouraged me because I was very new to
show business.''
   Ronald Reagan, who in his acting days was featured in the 1943
movie musical ``This is the Army,'' said: ``Nancy and I are deeply
saddened by the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical
genius delighted and stirred millions, and will live on forever.''
   ``He's been so much a part of all of us, of all ages, over all
the many years,'' said composer-conductor Morton Gould, president of
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``The
generations of people, millions of people, have danced to it, have
lived it, have romanced it.
   ``It's become part of our language, part of our heartbeat, part
of our soul. It's the kind of finish of an era,'' Gould said.``I
can't believe that he's not here.''
   Composer Burt Bacharach, who wrote 1969's Academy Award-winning
song ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head,'' said, ``This is a great
loss. But Irving Berlin has left us with the greatest legacy through
his music. His contributions to American popular music are
immeasurable.''
   Singer Paul Anka said: ``Throughout my career as a writer of
songs, I've always idolized Irving Berlin as the consummate master
of words and music.
   ``He wrote `God Bless America' _ May God bless Irving Berlin.''
