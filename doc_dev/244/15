<LEADPARA>  THE Christ child's nativity 2,000 years ago in an obscure village of a remote
Roman colony has inspired composers ever since. They've created music that's
still played and cherished by Christians around the globe.;   It's not the
glossy concert pieces and oratorios that take center stage tonight, however;
it's the humble Christmas carol, an often misrepresented musical form.
Strictly speaking, a carol is a dance-like song with alternating verse and
refrain, like "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen" or "I Saw Three Ships."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Love the carol, sing it badly -- just don't abuse it any more. It deserves
better.;   Incredible nonsense has made the rounds about Christmas music, and
some of the myths endure. Every piano-vocal Christmas collection I've ever
bought has had glaring errors.;   Consider the breathtaking "Silent Night," a
work built on just three chords, easy enough for a child to sing or play. A
masterpiece, right? For years it seemed both plausible and accurate that the
composer was Michael Haydn, Franz Josef Haydn's brother.;   Wrong.;  
Actually, "Silent Night" was composed on an emergency basis by schoolteacher
Franz Gruber of the humble Austrian village of Oberndorf when the church organ
broke down on Christmas Eve. The assistant pastor, Josef Mohr, provided the
German words. "Silent Night" made its world premiere in 1818 not with a chorus
of 200, not with an orchestra, but with just two solo singers, a chorus and a
guitar.;   Contrary to what your carol book might say, Handel did not write
"Joy to the World." That canard stemmed from the fact that its opening four
notes match "Lift Up Your Heads, O Ye Gates" from Handel's "Messiah." The real
composer: an 18th-century unknown.;   "Away in a Manger" was not written by
Martin Luther, though it is often attributed to him. In fact, the tune remains
virtually unknown in Luther's Germany today. It first appeared in James R.
Murray's 1887 "Dainty Songs for Little Lads and Lassies," bearing Murray's
initials.;   Mozart and Mendelssohn actually did have a hand in songs of the
season.;   Mendelssohn wrote the music of "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," but
the words were foreign to him. He composed his tune for "For a Tercentenary of
the Invention of the Art of Printing" (his title!), as an homage to Gutenberg.
Though he wrote many sacred works, he staunchly opposed the recycling of this
tune for Christmas use. Fortunately his protests were to no avail.;   Mozart's
involvement was even more peripheral: He recycled our popular Welsh carol
"Deck the Halls," using its theme in a violin-piano duo.;   Carols have an
ambivalent history. Long before they ever entered the church, carols had a
role in pagan ritual. The church actually fought to keep them out.;   Today,
however, carols are as welcome in the church as in the home. Carolers wander
around neighborhoods, spreading cheer. And in millions of households around
the world tonight, carols will nourish the soul as the family celebrates
Christmas.;   Happy caroling, and a very merry Christmas too!;   BACH FOR THE
HOLIDAYS: If you want to set a musical tone for Christmas Eve, a marvelous new
compact disc does it well, blending both Catholic and Protestant traditions.
J.S. Bach's Masses, BWV 233 and 236 (Virgin Classics, 55 minutes) features the
Collegium Vocale of Ghent, Belgium, under the direction of the
period-instruments conductor Philippe Herreweghe.;   These works use the Latin
texts of the Catholic Church, but they were intended for Protestant services
in Leipzig, probably after 1734. Each Mass consists of just a Kyrie (Christ,
Have Mercy) and Gloria; as a result, they are rarely sung at our Bach
festivals.;   The first Mass is especially effective musically, with rich
baroque counterpoint and, in the Kyrie, some of Bach's best fugal writing.  </TEXT>
