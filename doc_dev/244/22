   Irving Berlin once insisted there were nine
rules to writing popular songs.
   They must be original, easy to sing, easy to remember,
``sexless'' so that a man or woman could perform them and should
have attention-getting titles. But most important, Berlin stated,
``The song writer must look upon his work as a business, that is,
to make a success of it, he must work and work, and then WORK.''
   And he meant it. American music, it seems, was created on a
thousand restless nights by a shy little man with a high voice who
insisted, ``I sweat blood between 3 and 6 many mornings, and when
the drops that fall off my forehead hit the paper they're notes.''
   He liked to write in the evening, sleep in the morning and pitch
songs in the afternoon; sometimes he didn't bother sleeping.
   On a winter's night in 1941, Berlin began working on ``White
Christmas.'' He finished it the next morning and raced over to his
office, telling his stunned transcriber that ``not only is it the
best song I ever wrote, it's the best song anybody ever wrote.''
   Berlin always seemed to have a plan. In 1909, he set himself a
goal of writing four to five songs a night, creating an enormous
backlog of unused or ``trunk songs'' _ ``God Bless America'' among
them.
   Nearly 80 years later, Steven Spielberg tried to negotiate for
film rights to the great love song ``Always,'' but the director was
curtly informed that Berlin wanted to use it for a project _ never
started _ of his own. The movie, also called ``Always,'' was
released in December 1989, three months after the songwriter's
death at age 101.
   What kept him going? According to Laurence Bergreen, author of
the comprehensive biography ``As Thousands Cheer: The Life of
Irving Berlin'' ($24.95, Viking), it wasn't love or greed or even
artistic ambition. The sound of applause, the need for the public's
approval was the songwriter's greatest inspiration, the author said.
   ``He began by singing for pennies and nickels in the sidewalks
of New York,'' explained Bergreen, also author of ``James Agee: A
Life.''
   ``If people liked what he sang they gave him money and if they
didn't like it, they didn't give him money and he didn't eat.
   ``You wrote songs. They were performed, and the audience heard
it. You would stay up all night and fix it to and try to make it
better. That's how you developed, with the immediate feedback.''
   Bergreen raises the same question again and again: How did
Berlin remain so prolific for so long? How did he change with the
times for nearly 40 years until another self-made man named Elvis
Presley redefined popular music and pushed a frustrated Berlin into
retirement?
   ``He was totally market driven,'' Bergreen said. ``I think
what's remarkable is that every 10 years or so he tried to reinvent
himself as a songwriter; popular songwriters then tended to come
and go as quickly as they do now.
   ``He consciously adapted himself to changing styles. Ragtime in
the 'teens (`Alexander's Ragtime Band') to sob songs in the '20s
(`Always') to romantic ballads (`Cheek to Cheek') in the '30s. In
the '40s, you notice a pronounced influence of swing music (`I Got
the Sun in the Morning').''
   Irving Berlin was born Israel Baline on May 11, 1888, the son of
a Russian cantor and one of eight children. His family emigrated to
the United States in 1893 and settled into the heavily populated
Jewish community of Manhattan's Lower East Side.
   While his parents and siblings stuck to the ways of the old
country, even speaking in Yiddish, Berlin raced into the new world,
hustling to get out of his family's cramped, dirty tenement as
quickly as possible and make it to the classy world that waited
uptown.
   He hawked newspapers, spoke in colorful New York slang, earned
coins as a singing waiter. Eventually, he changed his name and
tried writing his own songs, reasoning, ``Once you start singing,
you start thinking of writing songs, it's as simple as that.''
   He wrote his first song, ``Marie From Sunny Italy,'' in 1908 and
soon joined a music publishing house called Waterson &amp; Snyder. In
1911, Berlin contributed four songs to the Ziegfield Follies, and
hammered out ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' a lively update of the
``classic'' ragtime made popular by Scott Joplin in 1899.
   Like any quick-thinking kid, Berlin was looking for an angle, a
gimmick _ some way to grab onto a trend _ and seized on ragtime as
the answer. But he was also willing to take chances, play with the
rules and invent the rules.
   ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' the name inspired by the
derogatorially named ``coon'' songs that had ``Alexander'' in the
title, combined popular black and white music, mixing ragtime and
march. The chorus ran 32 bars, double the usual length, and the
song changed key in mid-course, another innovation.
   ``I humbly began to study my own song, asking myself, `Why?'
`Why?','' Berlin recalled in 1915, reflecting on its international
success.
   ``And I got an answer. ... It's opening words, emphasized by
immediate repitition _ `Come on and hear! Come on and hear!' _ were
an invitation to `come' and join in, and `hear' the singer and his
song.''
   ``There were distinctive yard marks in his songs that you could
see,'' Bergreen said. ```Puttin' on the Ritz' on the one hand and
`God Bless America' as the other. You had anthems of basic American
events: `White Christmas,' `Easter Parade'; ragtime songs like
`Alexander's Ragtime Band.'
   ``And there was the counterpoint song, `Just in Love,' `Play a
Simple Melody,' `An Old Fashioned Wedding.' There were two songs
kind of going at the same time, two singers singing against each
other.''
   Berlin could neither read nor write music and his business
skills were equally crude, equally effective. He had dropped out of
school at age 14 to earn money and had to scramble around town,
pitching his songs to publishers; until his death in 1989, his
office never had a computer.
   But if Berlin sweated blood as a businessman, the drops that
fell quickly turned to cash. He realized early on that publishing
was where the most money could be made and held on stubbornly to
the rights of his songs, boasting for years that he received the
highest royalty payments in the nation.
