   It wasn't a White Christmas, but dozens of fans
who usually sing Christmas carols to composer Irving Berlin
serenaded him at his mansion today at the very start of his 100th
birthday.
   The reclusive composer, who hates to get up in the morning and
wrote a song to that effect, didn't put in an appearance.
   ``If he's 100, he's probably sleeping,'' said Roberta Kaufman,
who had been walking her dog and stopped to see what the crowd of
75 people was doing in front of the five-story brick mansion in
Beekman Place, an exclusive East Side enclave.
   John Wallowitch, who organized the midnight Tuesday serenade and
has organized the Christmas carol singing outside Berlin's door for
at least 20 years, was sure Berlin was awake.
   ``He's a night owl, I've seen him walking his dog at 3 a.m.,''
Wallowitch said.
   Berlin's secretary confirmed that.
   ``When they were there singing, of course he heard them. He was
very thrilled by that,'' Hilda Schneider said at mid-morning. She
added that the composer was spending the day ``quietly at home.
He's never made a big thing about his birthdays.''
   During a singing a somewhat intoxicated reveler yelled
``HAAApppy Birthday Irving'' at the drawn shades of 17 Beekman
Place. ``We love you. Where are youuuuu?''
   Many of those gathered seemed to be neighbors hoping to catch a
rare glimpse of Berlin. Just before the singing began, a shade went
up in the house and the crowd gasped.
   But it was a teen-age girl and a matron. Both waved and the
crowd waved back.
   ``Even if he didn't write a thing, to reach 100 is to be part of
American history,'' said 21-year-old John Wiessman, a junior at New
York University. ``But this guy wrote a lot. I love `God Bless
America.' Every American has got to love it.''
   The music and lyrics among the more than 1,500 songs Berlin
created for the stage, screen and popular music are inextricably
woven into the American culture.
   They include ``White Christmas,'' ``Easter Parade,''
``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ``There's No Business Like Show
Business,'' ``Puttin' on the Ritz,'' ``Blue Skies,'' ``Cheek to
Cheek,'' and ``Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.''
   In London, the British Parliament honored the composer today
with a motion wishing him ``many more White Christmases and Easter
Parades.''
   Today's informal serenade will be followed tonight by a Carnegie
Hall tribute to the composer, with stars like Frank Sinatra, Isaac
Stern and Ray Charles scheduled to appear.
   Wallowitch got the crowd ready by reading through a song he
composed for the occasion.
   ``Just think, 100 years ago this little Russian lady was very
pregnant,'' he said, referring to Berlin's birth on May 11, 1888,
in Russia. Then he told the crowd to sing ``softly, with great
love.''
   The crowd sang ``Happy Birthday,'' Berlin's ``Always'' and
Wallowitch's ``The Songs of Irving Berlin,'' which included the
broad hint, ``Knock on my door and I'll welcome you in.''
   Nearly five years ago, Wallowitch was invited into the Berlin
home on Christmas Eve after a chorus of ``White Christmas.'' On an
impulse, he rang the doorbell. A maid answered and took him and his
fellow singers into the kitchen.
   There they were greeted by Berlin himself, in bathrobe and
slippers. The composer hugged the men, kissed the women and told
them, ``That's the nicest Christmas present I've ever had.''
   Still no Berlin, so the crowd ran through ``We'll be loving you,
always'' again. Another shade went up but again it was the teen-age
girl.
   ``Hey,'' the drunk said. ``We would love to see Irving. Please
bring him to the window.''
   The dispersing neighbors said they did not really expect to see
him. It's a neighborhood known for its recluses like Greta Garbo.
   Garbo didn't show either.
