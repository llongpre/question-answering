<TEXT>     San Jose was a flourishing music center filled with music lovers, music
teachers and music stores, many of which published works by local musicians.; 
 A collection of early local sheet music is in the archives at the San Jose
Historical Museum, and volunteers have been using its period songs to
entertain at vintage fashion shows, Living History Days and other museum
events.;   "Dear Old San Jose," with words and music by Hal D. Neides, is one
of the rediscovered old favorites, and Neides' words show the sophistication
of the old songsmiths.;   The chorus begins, "San Jose, San Jose, you're the
greatest town of all," and ends, "I'm content to live and die 'neath that ever
sunny sky of my dear old San Jose. San Jose.";   Neides might have been
content to stay here, but he didn't. He was manager of the Liberty Theater
downtown when he wrote the song in 1925. By 1930, he was gone.;   At least two
other early songwriters rhapsodized on the Valley of Heart's Delight, as San
Jose was called when fruit trees, not houses, dotted the landscape. One of
those compositions, by Eleanore Schuster, a former concert singer, was
presented to President Truman.;   Several other early composers focused on
California, and at least one picked the entire western United States. "East is
the place where the wise men sit, West where the strong men walk," the song
begins. "West is the place where the young men act, East where the old men
talk.";   Charlotte M. Phelps, a San Jose native who sold real estate, penned
"California I'm in Love With You," which was sung by the Warblers Glee Club,
one of several such groups that came and went until about World War II.;  
Some of the composers stuck to music, devising dance tunes, mostly lively
schottisches, named for local points of interest. There was the Lick
Observatory Schottische by F.M. Lee and the Vendome Schottische, named for a
local luxury hotel, by Lena Sullivan.;   The local music scene was enhanced by
conservatories, independent or affiliated with colleges. There were dozens of
music teachers -- 74 were listed in the city directory in 1905, when San
Jose's population was about 25,000. (Today, 41 music teachers are listed in
the yellow pages.) The area also had a musical kindergarten, a local woman who
made violins, and regular performances by local and imported musicians at
theaters.;   And, in those pre-Nordstrom days, Woolworth's featured live
music. Harriet Huntley Dean played the piano in the dime store's sheet-music
department, one of many places she performed, according to Anne Louise Heigho,
the music volunteer at the historical museum. Dean's collection of sheet music
is among the thousands of pieces, dating from 1840, in the museum's
collection.;   Grand pianos, parlor organs, memorabilia from the King
Conservatory of Music, old Edison phonographs and collections of hymns and
student songs also are among the items in the museum's music collection,
Heigho said.;   The late Leo Sullivan, a fiddler who liked to boast that he
was the first San Jose musician to make a living from his art, recalled some
of the high points of the city's musical history in a small book, "The Musical
Heritage of San Jose," published in 1967.;   In it, he recalls playing at the
last dance at the elegant Vendome Hotel at North First and Empire streets. The
"ritzy affair" broke up about 1 a.m. April 18, 1906, just hours before the
ballroom was destroyed by the massive earthquake.;   Dances provided regular
employment for musicians, who in the early days had to haul their own pianos
to jobs in outlying areas, he wrote.;   Live music began to decline during
World War II, Sullivan said.;   "It is difficult," he wrote, "to grasp what an
important part live music played before mechanization took over."  </TEXT>
