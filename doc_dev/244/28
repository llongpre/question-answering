   Irving Berlin created the American popular song.
   Until Berlin began writing after the turn of the century,
American music was dominated by Europe _ English music hall, Gilbert
and Sullivan, Viennese operetta and Italian opera. Berlin took
native American sounds, such as ragtime, and turned them into huge
popular hits like ``Alexander's Ragtime Band'' and ``Everybody's
Doin' It Now.'' When Irving Berlin wrote, America listened _ for
more than 50 years.
   ``He caught the voices of the people early in this century and
held them for longer than anyone else,'' Robert Kimball, musical
theater historian, said Friday.
   From his first song, ``Marie of Sunny Italy,'' in 1907 to his
last Broadway show, ``Mr. President,'' in 1962, Berlin's presence
was felt on the music scene in this country. No one today can look
to such a long period of domination.
   And Berlin was a winner in every medium he tried. He found
success not only in Tin Pan Alley but on Broadway with musicals like
``Annie Get Your Gun,'' ``Call Me Madam'' and his Music Box revues,
and in Hollywood where he wrote the scores for Fred Astaire-Ginger
Rogers movies like ``Top Hat'' and ``Follow the Fleet'' and other
films like ``Holiday Inn'' and ``Easter Parade.''
   His colleagues thought he was the best, particularly
contemporaries like Jerome Kern. He had an enormous influence on the
Broadway composers who followed him, especially George Gershwin and
Harold Arlen who relished his inventive way with rhythm.
   Berlin also had an incredible versatility, a great intelligence
and perspective about the world. He could write any kind of song _ a
stirring, patriotic anthem like ``God Bless America,'' a seasonal
standard like ``White Christmas,'' a comic theater ditty like
``Doin' What Comes Natur'lly,'' an unbashedly sentimental favorite
like ``Always'' or a complex love song like ``Let's Face the Music
and Dance.''
   ``He was a folk singer and he was able to absorb whatever was
happening in the street and bring it out, even more than Stephen
Foster,'' said Edward Jablonski, a good friend of Berlin's and the
author of several books on American theater composers. ``He was an
ordinary man who was able to write songs. That's why he appealed so
much to people.
   ``But he also made a point of not being a well-educated musician.
He was a born musician, which is a hard thing to be. So he could be
more sophisticated that he ever thought he was.''
   Berlin also was a shrewd businessman. He was a charter member and
served on the first board of directors for ASCAP, the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, which collects
songwriting royalties. Before 1920, he had formed his own music
publishing company which published all of his music. And at the time
of his death, he was still co-owner of the Music Box Theater, a
Broadway theater he built in 1921. As late as two years ago, he
would call up the box office at the Music Box to see how the grosses
were going.
   But it will be for his music that he will be remembered.
   ``I would think Irving Berlin is the most admired songwriter
America has produced in this century _ and maybe ever,'' Kimball
said.
