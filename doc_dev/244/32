   A federal jury Thursday rejected a $25
million claim that pop star Stevie Wonder's Oscar-winning 1984 song
``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' was stolen from another
songwriter.
   The plaintiff, Lloyd Chiate, claimed Wonder's song, part of the
movie soundtrack for ``Woman in Red,'' was stolen from a song he
co-wrote titled, ``I Just Called To Say.''
   ``I knew the truth in my heart all along,'' said Wonder, who
attended the two-week trial and testified on his own behalf. ``I'm
very sorry a lot of people had to spend a lot of precious time in
this courtroom. But I do appreciate and respect justice.''
   Wonder offered to try to smooth over the dispute by writing a
song with Chiate and Lee Garrett, co-author of ``I Just Called To
Say,'' and donate the proceeds to charity.
   ``Then we all really win,'' Wonder said. ``It is far easier to
love than to hate.''
   Chiate, 40, sued Wonder in 1985 under the superstar's real name,
Steveland Morris, for copyright infringement, claiming that Wonder
pilfered ``I Just Called To Say,'' co-written by Lee Garrett, after
Wonder heard the song in 1977.
   Wonder, 39, denied stealing the song, which won an Academy Award
in 1984. He said he wrote ``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' long
before hearing the Chiate-Garrett composition and without any
influence from the song.
   Chiate wasn't present when the jury announced its verdict. His
attorney said his client was wronged by a star-struck jury and a
biased judge who had originally dismissed the lawsuit but was
overruled by an appeals court.
   ``I don't think that Mr. Chiate ever got a fair trial,'' said
lawyer Herbert Dodell. ``The result was inevitable, a terrible
miscarriage of justice.''
   Jury foreman Robert Apfelzweig, 39, a research scientist from
Pasadena, said the jury didn't find any evidence that Wonder had
access to the Chiate-Garrett song and the two songs were ``quite
dissimilar.''
   ``Mr. Chiate's case started weak and got weaker,'' said
Apfelzweig.
   Chiate contended that Wonder first had access to Chiate and
Garrett's music during the summer of 1977, when Garrett played
Wonder a tape recording of his music after the latter had talked
Garrett out of committing suicide one night.
   Garrett and Wonder are boyhood friends. Garrett originally was
named as a plaintiff in the suit, but he dropped out and testified
for Wonder.
   Wonder testified in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge David
W. Williams that he wrote much of ``I Just Called to Say I Love
You'' on July 16, 1976, while being driven from his mother's San
Fernando Valley home.
   It was at least a year, perhaps two, before he heard the song
Chiate and Garrett wrote, he said.
   Wonder said that he later polished and recorded ```I Just Called
to Say I Love You,'' which became a big hit and also won a Grammy.
