<TEXT>     A. I think of myself as being an interpreter of classic American pop songs,
from an archival and historical viewpoint. My approach to a classic song is
not clinical -- I take liberties with it, I do my own interpretation -- but my
focus is on approaching it with an understanding of, and respect for, the
composer's intentions. My concerts differ somewhat from my albums -- in
performance I'm able to do much more in the way of shaping the presentation
with anecdotes and humor.;   Q. Why was the American popular music of the
first half of the century, especially from the '20s to the '40s, so
memorable?;   A. One reason, I think, was the creative atmosphere in New York
City in those years. New York bred those guys, those composers. They
articulated the diversity and pace in the city that was generated byall the
immigrant groups. Jewish immigrants had gotten into the music publishing
business in the late 19th century because the industry was largely
unorganized; they could get into it without facing prejudice. One of the
things the composers did was articulate a desire of the immigrants to be very
American. So you had many very patriotic songs, like Irving Berlin's "God
Bless America," which he wrote in 1917, although he didn't present it to the
world until 1938.;   Q. You've spoken of Irving Berlin as a man who changed
the world.;   A. His songs had immense influence around the world.
"Alexander's Ragtime Band" was one of the first songs to be an international
hit. Songs like "White Christmas" and "Easter Parade" and so many others --
hundreds of them! -- have influenced many, many people and brought them
together. Berlin was divinely inspired, there's no doubt of that in my mind,
but he was also out to write hits. He wrote 1,500 songs, which is just
staggering to me, especially when you realize how good most of them are. Ira
Gershwin, for whom I worked in the late '70s, always said that Berlin's
ability with lyrics was exceptional and perhaps underrated -- Ira said that
Berlin would have been considered a great songwriter as a lyricist even if
he'd never written a tune.;   Q. You're not so enamored of the work of Cole
Porter?;   A. I don't think I'm as well-matched to Porter as to Berlin or,
say, Harold Arlen. There are many Porter songs I love, but there are many I
don't like and find diffi-cult to perform. Bobby Short can do them better than
me. Others too -- Julie Wilson, Steve Ross. I wrote recently in an article
that maybe they can create a certain archness, a certain reserve, that some of
his songs require, that I can't generate. A lot of his songs don't hit me in
the kishkas -- "Night and Day" just doesn't do it for me.;   Q. Where are the
kishkas?;   A. That's Yiddish for intestines.;   Q. You mentioned Harold
Arlen, who wrote the music for the songs in "The Wizard of Oz." You do a
beautiful interpretation of "If I Only Had a Brain.";   A. Thank you. In 1981
I heard it sung by E.Y. Harburg, who wrote the lyrics for Arlen's tune, and
this gave me a completely fresh perspective on it -- I began to see the song
in the context of the struggle of contemporary man! Our struggle to exist in
the world today, and find love; the simple things we all yearn for. I
discovered that no one had ever recorded the verses and choruses of all three
of the Oz characters in one piece, so I decided to do it that way. Also, there
were parts cut out of the movie -- there's an introduction to the Scarecrow's
part that goes: "Said a scarecrow swinging on a pole/To a blackbird sitting on
a fence. . . ." This is how I often proceed with a song -- going back, digging
around, seeing what's really there. It's sort of an archeological search.;  
Q. When you were growing up in Columbus, Ohio, in the '60s and early '70s, at
the height of the rock era, did any of your peers share your love for the old
tunes?;   A. No. Occasionally some would come over and listen to my records --
I had a collection of 78s by Al Jolson, Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby and others.
I liked some things from the '60s -- Carole King, Leiber &amp; Stoller and others.
I like rock 'n' roll more now than I used to. One of my problems with a lot of
contemporary songs is that, while I really like to bring words to the fore,
many records today consist largely of electronic sounds generated in the
studio. Actually, the thing about rock that most worries me is its impact on
people's hearing. People of my generation are going deaf! It's really
happening!  </TEXT>
