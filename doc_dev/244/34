   Hollywood animator Chuck Jones, the creator
of the popular cartoon character Wile E. Coyote, says current
Saturday morning cartoon fare is ``TV mush that attempts to pass
for animation.''
   ``It's illustrated radio,'' said Jones, 75. ``You can turn off
the picture and know what's going on because they have to describe
it to you.
   ``Good acting will survive on its own. That's the essence of
good cartoons. You can turn off the sound and watch the pictures,''
Jones said Friday.
   ``The quality of the new stuff is flat. Some of these old
cartoons are 50 years old and still being shown. That's good
quality,'' said Jones, in Lincoln for the Animation Festival at the
Sheldon Film Theater.
   Jones also created Pepe le Pew and collaborated in the creation
of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig during his years at Warner
Brothers Studio. He won three Oscars and hundreds of other awards
and honors for some 300 movies.

   Country-western singer Mickey Gilley is
temporarily leaving the stage for a courtroom, where he is suing
his former business partner and accountant for allegedly defrauding
him of $8.2 million.
   As a result of the trial, expected to last three weeks, Gilley
says he's likely to miss five or six performances.
   Gilley is suing Sherwood Cryer and accountant Gerard Willrich
for allegedly cheating him over the past 17 years.
   According to the suit, Cryer was Gilley's manager from 1971 to
1984 but still represents himself as such. The singer also accuses
Cryer of failing to pay him half the profits from the Houston-area
club named after Gilley and for merchandise that carries the
Gilley's name.
   Cryer responded that the claims were filed too late to collect
damages, that no written contracts existed for many of the
transactions and that Gilley silently consented to Cryer's actions.
   ``I'm an entertainer,'' Gilley said Thursday outside the
courtroom. ``I'm not real good at standing and testifying.''

   After a three-year marriage, Bruce
Springsteen and his wife, actress Julianne Phillips, have split,
Miss Phillips' publicist says.
   ``Yes. I'd rather not comment on it. You can say it's been
confirmed,'' Molly Madden, Miss Phillips' spokeswoman, said Friday.
She said neither Springsteen nor Miss Phillips has filed for
divorce.
   Springsteen, 38, the working-class kid who rose from the bar
bands of Asbury Park, N.J., to become one of the world's most
popular rock stars, is in Europe with his ``Tunnel of Love''
concert tour.
   Miss Phillips, 28, is filming ``Fletch II'' with comedian Chevy
Chase, Ms. Madden said.
   The couple met backstage in Los Angeles during his ``Born in the
U.S.A.'' concert tour in 1984. They were married in a private,
midnight ceremony in a church near her family's home in Lake
Oswego, Ore., on May 13, 1985.

   U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy greeted each
new graduate of the nation's oldest school for the hearing and
visually disabled after urging increased federal funding for
programs for the blind and deaf.
   ``Thanks for remembering us,'' said Mark Belair, a new graduate
of the Perkins School for the Blind, where Helen Keller began her
education more than 100 years ago. ``We won't let you down.''
   Kennedy, D-Mass., lauded the 19 graduates Friday.
   ``Our nation has prospered by recognizing the contributions that
physically and mentally challenged individuals can make,'' said
Kennedy, whose 26-year-old son, Edward Kennedy Jr., lost a leg in
1973 due to bone cancer.
   ``We have much to learn from those once thought incapable of
independent living or achievement. Their examples inspire us all to
try harder to eliminate the barriers,'' he said.

   The songwriters who penned ``Jailhouse
Rock'' and ``Hound Dog'' are suing a restaurant for playing the
tunes without permission.
   Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, whose songs produced hits for
Elvis Presley, alleged in a federal lawsuit Thursday that owners of
Big Top Pizza Palace have caused them irreparable harm by piping
the songs over the restaurant's loudspeakers without authorization.
   A co-plaintiff is Sheb Wooley, who wrote the song ``The Purple
People Eater.''
   The lawsuit, which seeks damages of up to $10,000 for each of
the plaintiffs, alleges the restaurant owners ignored repeated
letters and visits from representatives of the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers, which licenses the songs.
   Owners of the restaurant could not be reached for comment Friday.
   Attorney Nancy Mays, who represents the songwriters, said it is
a standard procedure for restaurants or nightclubs to arrange for
licensing through ASCAP or Broadcast Music Inc., which represent
composers.

   The legal eagle for rock 'n' roller Jerry
Lee Lewis knows the show must go on.
   The rock pioneer was about to give a rooftop concert at the
historic Peabody Hotel on Friday for the Tennessee Bar Association
when a member of the audience decided to conduct a little
unfinished business.
   Attorney Frank Clayton of Nashville tried to seize Lewis' $5,000
payment for the performance. Clayton represents Oklahoma nightclub
owner George Cunningham, who won a suit against Lewis in 1978 for
$483,645 after the flamboyant entertainer failed to appear for a
concert at The Whiskey River Club. Lewis never repaid the advance
fee he received.
   When Clayton learned that Lewis' band was to receive the fee
instead of the entertainer, he tried to serve Lewis with a court
order allowing him to collect the $483,645 award.
   But Lewis' attorney, Jim Sanderson, accepted the suit himself,
preventing Lewis from getting the writ before the show and possibly
ruining Lewis' mood for the performance.
