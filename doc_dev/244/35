   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Irving Berlin, America's best-known but most
private songwriter, turns 100 this week. A diverse group of
entertainers will take part in a tribute to Berlin at Carnegie
Hall, but don't expect him to attend. Except for occasional
strolls, Berlin stays home, talking infrequently with his friends
by telephone.

   Shortly before midnight on May 10, a small group
of carolers will gather in front of a five-story brick mansion
facing the East River on New York's posh Beekman Place.
   When the clock strikes 12, this impromptu glee club, led by
composer and cabaret performer John Wallowitch, will break into
``Happy Birthday,'' followed by a chorus of ``Always.''
   They will be celebrating at the doorstep of the man who wrote
that haunting love song. Irving Berlin, America's best-known _ yet
most private _ songwriter turns 100 on May 11, 1988.
   Just mention the melodies Berlin wrote, and you'll start to
sing: ``White Christmas,'' ``Easter Parade,'' ``God Bless
America,'' ``There's No Business Like Show Business,''
``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ``A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody,''
``Puttin' on the Ritz,'' ``Blue Skies,'' ``How Deep is the
Ocean?,'' ``Cheek to Cheek,'' to name a few.
   Wallowitch's Berlin salute, an annual celebration he began more
than 20 years ago and which he usually holds at 6 p.m. on Christmas
Eve, may be the most personal tribute to Berlin this year.
   ``They have been devastatingly emotional experiences,'' says
Wallowitch, an unabashed Berlin fan who lives down the street and
around the corner from the composer.
   But the only festivity officially recognized by the songwriter
will be a Carnegie Hall salute on May 11 held in connection with
ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
Berlin is a charter member of the organization _ founded in 1914 _
that licenses music for public performance.
   The collection of diverse performers expected to appear at the
gala includes Frank Sinatra, Willie Nelson, Jerome Robbins, Walter
Cronkite, Isaac Stern, Ray Charles and Garrison Keillor. It will be
taped by CBS for a television special later in the month.
   Don't expect an appearance by the master. Berlin is passionate
about his privacy. Except for short walks around Beekman Place when
the weather is warm, Berlin never is seen in public. On his
infrequent strolls through the tranquil, tree-lined neighborhood,
he usually is accompanied by a young woman or a doorman from a
nearby building.
   Call the Irving Berlin Music Corp. and ask for an interview with
the boss. You'll get Hilda Schneider, Berlin's longtime secretary.
She is polite and friendly but adamant in declining interviews for
her employer.
   ``I'm sorry I can't be more encouraging,'' the woman says. ``If
we do one, we'd have to do them all. It's all in the record. You
can look it up.''
   And the record is pretty impressive: Some 1,500 songs that span
the worlds of theater, movies and popular music. No other composer
can match that record.
   For the stage, Berlin wrote ``Annie Get Your Gun'' and more than
a dozen other Broadway shows. His movies include several Fred
Astaire-Ginger Rogers classics such as ``Top Hat'' and ``Follow the
Fleet.'' His pop hits, those songs not written for any particular
stage show or film, include such standards as ``Remember'' and
``All Alone.''
   What makes his music so great?
   ``His songs have the sophistication of simplicity,'' says Morton
Gould, president of ASCAP. ``You know precisely what he's saying
and singing. He's been able to distill everything down to its
essence.
   ``He also expresses universal truths,'' Gould adds. ``If you
look at his song titles and listen to his music, he expresses
emotions that human beings would like to experience. Most people
want blue skies. They want the equivalent of white Christmases or
the whole idea of what `Easter Parade' evokes. And most of us don't
want to be all alone by the telephone. He says it directly and you
feel it.''
   Ironically, the telephone is how Berlin communicates with the
outside world today. When he wants to talk, he calls. The
songwriter has a small circle of telephone friends, people he dials
when he has something on his mind. Gould is one such listener.
   ``He will just call,'' Gould says. ``His liaison will say `Mr.
Berlin would like to talk to you.' When that happens, you drop
everything and pick up the phone. It's a wonderful thing. He has a
keen mind, and he's right on top of everything.''
