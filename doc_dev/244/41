   Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of songwriter
Irving Berlin, died Friday after the last of a series of strokes.
She was 85.
   Mrs. Berlin died at Doctors Hospital, where she was taken from
her Manhattan home.
   The last of Mrs. Berlin's four novels, ``The Best of Families,''
was published in 1970. She was also a prolific short-story writer.
   In one article for The New Yorker, she defended her generation's
abandonment of the Junior League and ``polite society'' for the
wilder life of cabarets and dancing the Charleston.
   ``It is not because fashionable young ladies are picturesquely
depraved that they go to cabarets,'' she wrote. ``They go to find
privacy.''
   Her marriage to Berlin on Jan. 4, 1926, drew headlines as the
famous songwriter, an Orthodox Jew, wed the former Ellin Mackay, a
Roman Catholic debutante who spurned her multimillionaire father's
fortune for love.
   When her father reportedly threatened to disinherit his
daughter, Berlin reportedly replied, ``In that case, I'll probably
have to make her a wedding gift of a couple of million dollars.''
   ``It could be the greatest love affair of the century,'' said
composer and cabaret performer John Wallowitch, a neighbor. ``It
really is a tragedy.''
   Wallowitch, who leads a group in serenading Berlin on his
birthday, recalled that Mrs. Berlin could frequently be seen
walking in the neighborhood and went to Mass each Sunday at St.
Patrick's Cathedral until about 10 years ago.
   During 62 years of marriage, Berlin wrote several songs just for
his wife, including ``Always'' and ``The Song Is Ended.''
   Mrs. Berlin was born on her father's $6 million estate in
Roslyn. She and Berlin had three daughters. Mrs. Berlin was a major
supporter of the Girl Scout movement.
   She is survived by her daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett of New
York; Linda Louise Emmett of Paris and Elizabeth Irving Peters of
New York; a brother, John W. Mackay of Locust Valley, nine
grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
   A funeral was scheduled for Tuesday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
