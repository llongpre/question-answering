<LEADPARA>  EVERY modern band has heard a record executive ask, "Where's the hit? Where's
the hit?" Record execs actually expect several hits, not just one, to drive
album sales. But the law of averages dictates that not every act will write
hits with the ease of a Lennon/McCartney, Jagger/Richards, Janet Jackson or
Prince.;   So what's a creatively strapped musician to do?  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SONGWRITING'S TOP GUN IS A HAPPY VALLEY GIRL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Pop Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The answer is found more and more in free-lance songwriters -- hired guns
who ship over finished songs or collaborate with tired artists looking for a
quick recharge. The top guns include Desmond Child, who has written for
Aerosmith and Bon Jovi; and Billy Steinberg, who has written for Madonna and
Whitney Houston.;   But the hottest of the bunch is California valley girl
Diane Warren, who later this month will be featured in a special section in
Billboard and profiled in Time magazine. She's racked up 30 Top 40 hits, among
them "I'll Be Your Shelter" for Taylor Dayne, "Rhythm of the Night" for
DeBarge, "If I Could Turn Back Time" for Cher, "Who Will You Run To" for Heart
and "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" for Starship.;   This week alone, Warren has
five songs in Billboard's Hot 100, including "Love and Understanding" for Cher
and "Time, Love and Tenderness" for Michael Bolton.;   Success suits Warren;
Warren is reeling in the hits -- and reeling in the profits: Witness the
half-million dollars a songwriter earns for a Top 3-and-up global hit. Yet she
remains blissfully down to earth, and not at all worried about overexposure or
burnout.;   "As far as having too many songs out at one time, that's fine,"
she says in a recent interview from the Los Angeles office of her Realsongs
publishing company. "If I was a really stylized writer, that might be a
problem. People would tire of your sound. But the songs I do are pretty
diverse, and the artists that cover them are diverse. I remember having 'When
I See You Smile' for Bad English at No. 1 on the charts, and 'Blame It on the
Rain' for Milli Vanilli at No. 2. But you'd never know the same writer wrote
those songs. It wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm getting tired of the Diane Warren
sound,' because I don't think there is one. There's a style to my ballads,
maybe, but nothing else. And I'm proud of that.;   "Everybody says I'm the
most driven person they know," she adds. "And I really am. I work 12 hours a
day, seven days a week pretty much. I'm constantly working. If I'm not
writing, I'm in the studio. If I'm not in the studio, I'm on the phone with
somebody regarding songs. I live and breathe it.";   And just who is this
human hit machine?;   "I'm a Jewish girl from the Valley -- the San Fernando
Valley -- you know, they talk that valley girl talk. I'm 34 years old, at
least for another month. I grew up in a middle-class house. My dad was an
insurance man. I had two older sisters, which was cool because I got to listen
to a lot of music through them.;   The radio was a friend; "I was always
listening to the radio. It was like my friend growing up. Top 40 radio had so
much great music back then in the '60s. I've been influenced by everything,
but a lot of the great songs of the '60s have really given me inspiration --
the Motown stuff and all that.";   After years of banging on doors in L.A.,
Warren scored her first success with "Solitaire," a 1983 hit for Laura
Branigan. Then came the international hit "Rhythm of the Night" for DeBarge
(with its infectious line, "Listen to the beat of the rhythm of the night"),
and she was on her way. Today, artists from Aerosmith to Gloria Estefan are at
her door, asking for help.;   Warren says she generally writes for herself
first, without tailoring a song to a given act. "I never write to trends," she
says. "First of all, I don't like doing it. And second, it's a bad thing to do
because by the time your record or song comes out, that trend may be over.;  
"The key is for me to get excited. I figure I have pretty commercial ears,
because I grew up listening to hits. If a song excites me, I continue with it.
Then I go, 'OK, let me try to think who this is good for. Who can I fool into
thinking this is a hit?' " She can be so persuasive that she even fell on her
knees to plead with Cher to record "If I Could Turn Back Time," which became
Cher's biggest hit in 15 years. "I just knew it was right for her," says
Warren.  </TEXT>
