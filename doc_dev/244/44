<TEXT>     Mr. Yellen wrote "Happy Days Are Here Again" in 1929, with Milton Ager, and
it became a campaign song for the Democratic Party, although Mr. Yellen
considered himself a Republican, Buyer said.;    Among other songs for which
he wrote lyrics were "Down by the O-Hi-O" (1920), "I Wonder What's Become of
Sally?" (1924), "Ain't She Sweet" (1927), "Hard Hearted Hannah (The Vamp of
Savannah)" (1924) and "Are You Havin' Any Fun?" (1939), as well as "My
Yiddishe Momme" (1925), one of many songs he wrote for Sophie Tucker.;   
Writing in Variety in 1963, Mr. Yellen recalled: "Tucker sang it at the Palace
-- the song and recitation in English, then a chorus in Yiddish. She made it a
hit not only in this country but in Europe.";    Born in Poland, Mr. Yellen
grew up in Buffalo and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1913. He
began writing songs in high school and continued on the side during his first
job, as a reporter for the Buffalo Courier.;    He was on the board of the
American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers from 1951 to 1969.;   
Mr. Yellen is survived by his wife, the former Lucille Hodgeman; a son, David
of Buffalo; a daughter, Beth Wilcove of Gaithersburg, Md.; a brother, Irving
of Buffalo; and six grandchildren.  </TEXT>
