   Michael Feinstein could be the world's biggest
fan of classic popular music.
   That's part of his appeal, a genuine enthusiasm for the songs of
George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers, Jerome Kern, Jule Styne, Harry
Warren, Stephen Sondheim, Richard Whiting and scores of other
Broadway and Hollywood composers.
   His affection for these melody masters comes through in
``Michael Feinstein in Concert: Piano and Voice,'' his third trip
to Broadway since 1988.
   Once the technical glitches - particularly a balky sound system
- are ironed out Feinstein's new show, which is on view at
Broadway's Golden Theater through Oct. 27, could be his best yet.
   The evening has been constructed carefully, with songs grouped
together by theme or composer or lyricist. Feinstein always has
been adept at intertwining different songs by the same writers. The
numbers reverberate off each other, making the listener doubly
aware of what a composer or a lyricist was trying to say.
   For example, Feinstein does it with two standards that have
lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein - Jerome Kern's ``Make Believe'' and
Richard Rodgers' ``I Have Dreamed.'' Both numbers reveal the man's
unabashed sense of romanticism and his firm belief in true love.
   The evening's highlight is a medley of songs by Burton Lane,
with whom Feinstein recently has recorded an album. A spry,
ebullient Lane was on hand Tuesday night to assist Feinstein, and
it was Tin Pan Alley heaven. The 78-year-old composer is a marvel,
playing his own songs with a zest no mere second-hand interpreter
could ever muster.
   Besides such Lane evergreens as ``Babes on Broadway,'' ``How
About You'' and ``On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,'' Feinstein
and Lane ripped smashingly through a witty little ditty called
``Anything Can Happen in New York.'' The lyrics were by E.Y.
Harburg and recall a time when the unexpected in the Big Apple
actually could be fun.
   Feinstein has a conversational rapport with the audience. He
talks to them as if he were sitting in their living rooms. There's
a bit of a true believer in him as well. He knows he's right when
he extols the virtues of these songwriters.
   Near the end of the long evening, he delivers a little lecture
on lyricist Johnny Mercer, peppered with musical illustrations
ranging from the well-known, ``Come Rain or Come Shine,'' to the
more than obscure, ``Girlfriend of the Whirling Dirvish.''
   But Feinstein relishes even these most unknown of songs. He has
the same preciseness of enunciation that he gives such standards as
Rodgers and Hart's ``Manhattan'' or Gershwin's ``I'll Build a
Stairway to Paradise.'' And he can be heartfelt with an unknown
Jule Styne song, ``Killing Time,'' which has the last lyrics ever
written by Carolyn Leigh.
   Feinstein certainly doesn't hold anything back. He gives his
all. You wonder what kind of voice he'll have at the end of a
four-week engagement. There may be better singers and better piano
players, but nobody tops Michael in his love of performing these
grand musical standards.
