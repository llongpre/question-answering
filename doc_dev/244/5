   People recognize the melodies if not the man
behind the music:
   ``I Can Dream, Can't I?'', ``I'll Be Seeing You,'' ``Dear Hearts
and Gentle People,'' ``Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``That Old
Feeling,'' ``By a Waterfall,'' ``When I Take My Sugar to Tea,''
``Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine.''
   These and scores of other songs are the life's work of Sammy
Fain.
   At 86, Fain is one of the last of a breed of songwriters who
wrote their way from Tin Pan Alley to Broadway to Hollywood during
the golden days between the two World Wars. Give them a job and
they'd write a song _ fast.
   ``You know, you'd get an assignment on Monday,'' Fain says
matter-of-factly, ``and they'd be rehearsing the orchestra by
Thursday. It's one of those things.''
   If his name isn't as well-known as a Rodgers, Gershwin, Porter
or Berlin, it may be because he never had a big Broadway musical,
although Fain did write the music for ``Hellzapoppin,'' the
long-running vaudeville escapade remembered more for the antics of
comics Ole Olson and Chic Johnson than its songs.
   The success that eluded Fain on Broadway was found in Hollywood:
dozens of film assignments, 10 Academy Award nominations and two
best-song Oscars for ``Secret Love'' and ``Love Is a Many
Splendored Thing.''
   Now theatergoers have a chance to sample a Fain rarity, ``Ankles
Aweigh,'' a 1955 Broadway musical that had nothing more on its mind
than gags, girls and a good time.
   The show is on view at the Goodspeed Opera House, that
ginger-box musical museum in East Haddam, Conn., best known as the
birthplace of ``Annie'' and for its sterling revivals of vintage
musicals from the 1920s and '30s. It will run through Sept. 30.
   A new book has been written for the musical by Charles Busch,
author and star of the long-running off-Broadway hit, ``Vampire
Lesbians of Sodom.'' Busch's revamped plot, still set in the 1950s,
had something to do with Hollywood starlets, the U.S. Navy, Italy
and a secret code coveted by the Russians.
   ```Ankles Aweigh' is an old-fashioned show,'' Fain said the
other day during a visit to the headquarters of the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``It's got a lot of
good rhythmic tunes and ballads which I like to do.''
   Fain, whose family lived in New York, was born into music. His
father was a cantor. His older brother played violin in Broadway
pit orchestras. His cousin was Willie Howard, the great sad-faced
comedian.
   ``Every winter I would get pneumonia,'' Fain recalls, so the
family eventually moved from the city to the Catskills.
   ``Living up in the country, all I had was the piano,'' says
Fain, who taught himself to play and to write his own music. ``I
had a rather interesting little alto voice. I'd just get up and
sing my own material.''
   After high school, singing brought him back to New York and a
job as a staff pianist with Jack Mills who ran a music publishing
company.
   ``They hired me to demonstrate and teach their songs to all the
performing artists,'' Fain says. ``I would sell the songs to big
performers. It helped me learn to play in every key.''
   He also performed in vaudeville and on radio as part of an act
called Dunn and Fain. But he never stopping writing. His first hit
song, with lyrics by Al Dubin, was published in 1925. It's title
was ``Nobody Knows What a Redhead Mama Can Do,'' and Fain was on
his way.
   Two years later he teamed up with Irving Kahal, a young
vaudeville performer and writer. Their partnership took them to
Hollywood and back again to Broadway and lasted until Kahal died in
1942.
   In California, Fain and Kahal contributed songs to such movie
musical classics as ``Footlight Parade'' and ``Dames.'' The songs
they wrote during those days were sweet and saucy with titles like
``Two Little Flies on a Lump of Sugar'' and ``When You Were a Smile
on Your Mother's Lips (And a Twinkle in Your Daddy's Eye).''
   ``A good title is an incentive to me,'' Fain says. ``I'll change
my melody if I hear a good line. I'm not stubborn about it. That's
collaboration.''
   And Fain has worked with some of the best word men in the
business. Besides Kahal, his lyricists have included Al Dubin, Jack
Yellen, E.Y. Harburg, Mitchell Parish, Joe Young, Lew Brown, Ralph
Freed and Paul Francis Webster.
   ``When I play a good tune for a lyricist, it gives him some
construction,'' Fain says. ``Music can lead you to a different
construction and sometimes a good lyricist likes that. It gives
them a chance to dig for a different kind of rhyme.''
   ``Ankles Aweigh,'' which has lyrics by Dan Shapiro, originally
ran in New York for six months. Besides ``Hellzapoppin'' and its
sequel, ``Sons o' Fun,'' it was one of Fain's longer running
Broadway shows.
   Many of his other musicals, such as ``Christine,'' ``Something
More'' and ``Toplitsky of Notre Dame,'' disappeared quickly.
``Flahooley,'' a 1951 Fain musical that starred Yma Sumac, Barbara
Cook and Bil Baird's Marionettes, has developed an almost legendary
reputation.
   The score, one of Fain's best, graced a witty and satirical book
by E.Y. Harburg that told the story of a laughing doll and its
effect on the big business of toy-making.
   ``That show was the talk of Philadelphia,'' said Fain, recalling
``Flahooley's'' triumphant out-of-town opening. Only New York
seemed unimpressed and the musical died after only 40 performances.
   ``It was a very unusual show,'' Fain sats. ``Someday, somebody
will revive `Flahooley' and it will be a hit.''
   If the shows weren't successful, much of the music was. Consider
two of Fain's biggest hit songs _ ``I Can Dream, Can't I?'' and
``I'll Be Seeing You.'' They somehow survived a 1938 flop called
``Right This Way'' that lasted two weeks on Broadway.
   Fain keeps writing today _ turning out new songs at his home in
Beverly Hills, Calif.
   ``I like to read the script,'' Fain says. ``That gives me an
idea for a melody. Many times, I play a certain little progression
and the lyricist will say `That's great.' If he doesn't like it,
I'll switch it around to fit a line. We help each other. That's the
way to work.''
