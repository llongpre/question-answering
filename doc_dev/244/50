To win an important award is an honor, the significance of which has been 
slowly diluted by the proliferation of media ceremonies. Today the rarest and 
most prestigious tributes go to the men and women who, in effect, have 
themselves become awards. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett Lester Carter has just joined the elite group. Last month, at the 
Hollywood Bowl, the first annual "Benny" award, in the form of a bronze bust of 
Carter, commissioned by the American Federation of Jazz Societies and sculpted 
by the bassist-turned-artist John Heard, was presented to Carter. In future 
years it will go to others who come closest to matching his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Such artists will be hard to find. Carter today, instead of resting on the 
laurels accumulated during overlapping careers as saxophonist, composer, 
arranger, bandleader, songwriter, trumpeter and drafter of scores for 
television series and movies, remains as active as ever. He has just composed 
his first-ever extended piece for two vibraphones, to be premiered Tuesday 
evening at New York's Avery Fisher Hall, with Milt Jackson and Bobby Hutcherson 
in the featured roles. An hour after the concert ends, his 83rd birthday will 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm calling it 'Good Vibes,' " he said over tea at his Los Angeles home 
overlooking the Valley. "It will run from 30 to 40 minutes; the Classical Jazz 
Orchestra, a repertory ensemble, will perform it. Bobby Hutcherson will double 
on vibes and marimba, an instrument you don't hear often enough. It's a long 
the lines of the 'Kansas City Suite,' which I wrote for Count Basie in 1960 -- 
a swinging thing, with ballad and Latin interludes. We'll probably record the 
whole suite in a studio a few days later." 
</P>
<P>
Carter's recording career is in higher gear than ever. He is a guest soloist on 
a current album of his tunes recorded by pianist Marian McPartland, for 
Concord. Next month the session he recorded with Phil Woods, an alto 
saxophonist who came out of the Charlie Parker generation, will be issued by 
Music Masters. 
</P>
<P>
"Phil is younger than my daughter," he says, "but age has never been an issue. 
I wrote a song called 'My Man Phil' -- words and music; I sang it on the record 
-- and he dedicated a number to me." 
</P>
<P>
Lyric writing is the newest addition to Carter's arsenal of talents. Over the 
years he has had such collaborators as Johnny Mercer ("A Kiss From You") and 
Sammy Cahn ("Only Trust Your Heart") but lately he has devoted himself to the 
serious study of how lyrics are devised. 
</P>
<P>
In the works now is a Benny Carter songbook album that will belatedly bring 
together, in vocal version on one CD, some of his best known standards, among 
them "Blues in My Heart" (1930), "When Lights are Low" (1936), "All That Jazz" 
(from the Sammy Davis movie "A Man Called Adam") and "Key Largo." 
</P>
<P>
Also due sooner or later is "Benny Carter: Symphony in Riffs," a 60-minute 
documentary that has been shown and praised in England while ironically an 
American release is still to be set. The film, narrated by Burt Lancaster, 
includes splendid evocations of Harlem in the '20s and of Carter's expatriate 
years and Hollywood movie successes. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's gift for melodic creation has been expressed most memorably through 
his improvisations on alto saxophone. The logic, symmetry and beauty of these 
solos set a standard that has never been outdated, despite the inroads of bop, 
modality, the avant-garde and whatever other movements have prevailed since his 
style was essentially set in the 1930s. His orchestral arrangements, 
particularly those of a five-piece sax section on such records as "Further 
Definitions" in the early 1960s, are paradigms of skill and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's writing has been interpreted with panache by musicians at a 
one-or-two-generation remove from him. Those who played in his orchestra at the 
recent Hollywood Bowl concert (and who will return when he shares a bill there 
with Ella Fitzgerald Aug. 22) range from musicians in their 30s (saxophonist 
Jeff Clayton and his bassist brother John) to others in their 60s, like the 
trombonist Buster Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
He has gone from being the youngest man in the band ("I was only 23 when I 
joined Fletcher Henderson") to becoming the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's longevity has enabled him to triumph over many obstacles -- most 
conspicuously racism, which he has opposed actively on many levels, whether it 
was fighting to retain ownership of a home in Hollywood against the objections 
of bigoted neighbors, or taking an active role in eliminating the segregated 
musicians' unions that long existed in Los Angeles, until the two combined in 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's achievements in broadening the vocabulary of the music world he has 
inhabited for 65 years have involved most of jazz history's honored names: he 
has played with (or written arrangements or conducted for) Benny Goodman, Glenn 
Miller, Dizzy Gillespie, Django Reinhardt, Max Roach, Buddy Rich, Quincy Jones, 
Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Dexter Gordon, Coleman Hawkins -- not to 
mention Ella and Peggy and Sarah and Carmen and a constellation of other 
singers. He has outlived many contemporaries, but those who have survived are 
all good friends. 
</P>
<P>
It becomes hard to find a negative word to say about Benny Carter, to avoid the 
overtones of press agentry. For the record, then, let it be said that he was a 
co-composer of "Cow Cow Boogie," a song of which he is less than proud ("but it 
made a fair amount of money for me"), and that his singing is, well, not on the 
level of his other accomplishments. At that point the negatives have to stop. 
</P>
<P>
The tributes, though, go on and on; just last month, with a thousand names from 
which to choose, an international panel of 64 jazz critics voted him Jazzman of 
the Year in a Down Beat poll. 
</P>
<P>
He has done it all and won them all -- what possible unrealized ambition can 
remain? 
</P>
<P>
"Easy," he said, "To live to be a hundred -- and in good health." 
</P>
<P>
Don't bet against it.
