   John Denver had more in mind than playing guitar
when he signed on as host of the first ``In Performance at the White
House'' of the Bush administration.
   ``I have a personal agenda in this. I want to play horseshoes
with the president,'' Denver said on a recent visit to New York as
host of a United Nations dinner on World Environment Day.
   ``I have tandem (horseshoe ) pits at my home,'' Denver said.
``I've been home in April and May for the first time in over 10
years, and my game has sharpened.''
   The one-hour ``In Performance at the White House'' airs tonight
on PBS. It also features actor Barry Bostwick, opera star Simon
Estes, Broadway singer Judy Kaye, the ragtime ensemble from the
Marine Band and ragtime pianist Joshua Rifkin.
   The executive producer of the show, John Musilli, presented
President and Mrs. Bush with several possible formats for this
season's ``In Performance at the White House'' series. They selected
one based on Earl Robinson's song, ``The House I Live In,''
referring both to the White House and the United States. Musilli
chose Denver as host of the opening concert.
   ``I called the Bushes,'' Musilli said. ``They said, `That would
be terrific. Do you think he'll do it?'''
   Denver, who was delighted to accept, said, ``Mr. Bush attended my
first concert at Carnegie Hall, in 1971, I think. I think he has
been a fan of mine.''
   Musilli hopes the two other shows in the series, like this
post-Fourth of July special, will have holiday themes, airing around
Columbus Day and Thanksgiving.
   The ``In Performance at the White House'' season in the Reagan
administration featured Broadway music.
   Denver will sing and play guitar as well as serve as host. He
said he would include his popular hits ``Rocky Mountain High,''
``Annie's Song'' and ``Country Roads.''
   Three ragtime pieces by Scott Joplin will be included, ``Pleasant
Moments,'' by Rifkin, ``The Pineapple Rag,'' with Rifkin
accompanying Miss Kaye, and ``Magnetic Rag,'' the last one Joplin
composed, by the Marine musicians, with Bostwick reading from E.L.
Doctorow's ``Ragtime.''
   Bass-baritone Estes will sing ``The House I Live In.'' The finale
will involve everybody joining in on ``Play a Simple Melody'' then _
since demand for an encore is expected _ Miss Kaye will sing ``Take
Care of This House'' from Leonard Bernstein's 1976 Broadway show,
``1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
   In the interview, Denver asked for maple syrup for his coffee,
but none is to be had. He likes it in coffee, he said, and on the
sourdough pancakes he makes for Sunday breakfasts. His sourdough
batter ``starter,'' he said, is more than 100 years old and gets
better all the time.
   Denver and his Australian wife, Cassie, had their first child, a
girl, in May. Jesse Belle was born by natural childbirth with Denver
assisting at Aspen Valley Hospital, where Denver had donated money
for a pediatric wing, named for his two older children, Zack and
Anna Kate. Denver said before the baby was an hour old, he held her
and sang to her. He can't remember what he sang except for an Indian
chant and a song he wrote in April, ``The Gift You Are.''
   He thinks it's one of his particularly good compositions. He'll
record it in July on an album for his own label, Wind Star. ``I love
it when I write a good song. You know when you've got a good one,''
he said.
   The song isn't just for the baby, he said. Denver said all people
must participate in the struggle to save the environment so that
human life can continue. ``The song is saying that each of us is a
gift to the world and to the people we love and we should live up to
that, in a sense.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   BACK TO `FRESNO' _ CBS is going to rebroadcast ``Fresno,'' the
satire on night-time soaps, beginning July 17. It will air over five
nights, concluding Friday, July 21, with a two-hour finale. Carol
Burnett, Dabney Coleman, Teri Garr, Gregory Harrison and Charles
Grodin starred in the hilarious and critically praised comedy
miniseries, but it didn't do well in the ratings when it first aired
in the 1986-87 series.
