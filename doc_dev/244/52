   Clarence Henry was 18 years old when he sent
his tired fingers across the piano keys and told a red-eyed group
in a New Orleans night club he didn't have a home.
   ``It was back in 1955 at the old Joy Lounge,'' he said. ``I'd
been working since 7 o'clock that night and it was 7 in the morning
and I was tired. I wanted to go home. I struck a little rift and
said `I ain't got no home.' That's how I wrote the song. We
recorded it the next year right here in New Orleans and it's been
going ever since.''
   That lonely boy is 53 now and still singing, sometimes, as he
says in the song, ``like a frog.'' On Saturday, April 28, Henry
will sing ``Ain't Got No Home'' for maybe the millionth time at the
New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.
   ``People always ask for it. They wait for it,'' he said of his
trademark tune. ``Ain't Got No Home'' catapulted Henry to fame and
gave him his stage name as well.
   ``I was looking for a good one,'' he said. ``I couldn't be
`Fats.' That was taken. But people would ask for the frog song by
the frog man, and this disc jockey, Poppa Stoppa, said to me
`That's your name. The Frogman.'''
   The song was featured in the movie ``The Lost Boys.''
   ``There's been millions of copies of that song sold. It still
sells today, but I'm still waiting for the money,'' Henry said.
``It's a mess. Everything's changed hands so many times I don't
know who owes me what anymore. I made a few thousand dollars on it,
but the real payoff is that it brought me fame.''
   The Frogman has performed at 20 of the 21 Jazz Fests in New
Orleans. A kind of one-man repertoire of rhythm and blues, Henry
sings many of the songs made famous by other New Orleans artists.
   During the year, he now does from 10 to 30 gigs, he said,
ranging from a New Year's Eve Party with only nine guests to
another music festival in Sweden.
   Henry toured with the Beatles on their American run in 1964.
   ``I did 18 shows with them. That was really something,'' he said.
   He played for the Rolling Stones at a party they threw on a
riverboat after their 1982 performance in the Superdome.
   At Jazz Fest, though, he just plays to the crowd. He sizes them
up and does what he thinks they'll like _ some fast songs, some
slow, some blues. He also does his old hits: ``I Don't Know Why I
Love You But I Do,'' ``You Always Hurt The One You Love'' and, of
course, ``Ain't Got No Home.''
   ``I'm getting old now. I can't do it as well as I used to. My
voice has changed. It was easy when I was young to do the frog
singing or to sing like a girl. Now I have to work for it. It still
gets people, though. It's something to see when they all start
wooing along with me.''
