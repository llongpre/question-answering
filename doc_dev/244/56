   Bangle Susanna Hoff's mom invoked the dreaded
``M-word'' when her daughter recently played her group's latest
album, ``Everything,'' for her.
   ``She thought it as more sophisticated and MATURE,'' than the
band's first two records, Hoffs said.
   Maturity may be a dirty word for many rockers _ and Hoffs quickly
disavowed her mother's language _ but it's an apt description for
both the record's sound and the approach the Bangles took in
recording their first album in almost three years.
   After two LPs and seemingly endless rounds of touring, the
Bangles say they finally feel comfortable with their craft.
   ``We're learning to trust ourselves more, to be more emotional in
our performance,'' said bass player Michael Steele. ``I don't really
know if you can call it maturity. It's more of an artistic growth.''
   The four women of the Bangles, who pay homage to classic bands of
the 1960s with their sunny melodies and intricate harmonies, became
stars with such hits as ``Walk Like an Egyptian,'' and the Prince
tune, ``Manic Monday,'' from the 1986 LP, ``Different Light.''
   The Bangles are thankful for their success, but said they needed
to take greater control over their music.
   Producer David Kahne, whose relationship with the band was stormy
at best, was replaced by Davitt Sigerson. Hoffs, Steele and sisters
Vicki and Debbi Peterson, who once readily accepted contributions
from outside songwriters, each wrote or co-wrote all of the new
album's 13 songs.
   When all four members of a band write songs, they notice when
their biggest hits are written by someone else. ``Walk Like an
Egyptian'' was written by Liam Sternberg, ``If She Knew What She
Wants'' is a Jules Shear song and the Bangles hit the Top 10 with a
cover of Paul Simon's ``Hazy Shade of Winter.''
   ``It was a reaction to the success of `Different Light' that made
us determined to write as many songs as we could come up with _
strong stuff that we could feel was emotionally attached to us,''
Steele said. ``We had a strange, slight feeling of distance from
`Different Light.'''
   The flip side to trusting your own instincts, of course, is
getting burned if the public rejects you. Some critics have grumbled
that ``Everything'' sounds overproduced and the songs don't sparkle.
But the public's responding to the first single, a Hoffs rocker
called ``In Your Room,'' which is moving swiftly up the charts.
   The Bangles say they liked the songs they wrote for this album so
much they couldn't bear to throw any away. Hoffs said it costs the
band money to pack the record with 13 songs instead of the
traditional 10.
   ``The thought of not having those extra three tracks on the
record just to save money makes no sense to me,'' Hoffs said. ``I'd
rather put out a record that we truly love.''
   ``That's why we got into it in the first place,'' Steele said.
``We're really oriented toward the music.''
   ``I got into it because of the fashion,'' Hoffs said, lampooning
her colleague's cliche.
   ``I do it for the boys,'' Steele shot back.
   They may joke about it, but the Bangles say they're tired of
defending themselves against people who denigrate their musical
ability because they're women.
   The Bangles knew Sigerson, who's produced Rickie Lee Jones and
David &amp; David, through mutual friends.
   ``We liked Davitt immediately,'' Hoffs said. ``He's been a
songwriter and he's from that orientation. We felt more comfortable
with someone we could talk to about our songs.''
   Those songs are generally the typical pop music fare of love won
and lost, with a few twists and turns. In ``Glitter Years,'' Steele
reminisces about the mid-'70s California rock scene and laments some
of its drug casualties. In the ballad ``Eternal Flame,'' Hoffs said
she used Roy Orbison and Patsy Cline as role models.
   ``We just sort of let each song lead us down whatever path it
would lead us, like putting on a blindfold and just going,'' Hoff
said. ``There's no formula. I wish sometimes there was. Everytime I
write something I rewrite it a billion times.''
   Hoffs said the Bangles feel grateful to get their songs on the
radio, since the singles charts are dominated by young heavy metal
bands and dance music.
   ``We grew up hearing the Byrds and Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and the
Doors on the radio,'' Steele said. ``Radio to us has never been a
plastic sellout.''
   The Bangles will spend much of 1989 touring to support a record
they say even moms and dads can love _ they know, because they've
asked theirs.
   ``I played it for my dad,'' Steele said. ``He said, `this is a
much more professional-sounding record.'''
