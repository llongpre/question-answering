   Woody Guthrie's songs rang out in a packed
theater at a long-delayed tribute to the composer of ``This Land Is
Your Land'' in his hometown, where some still maintain the
folk-singing great was no folk hero.
   About 50 schoolchildren and adult accompanists Thursday sang and
played fiddle, guitar, banjo, harmonica and piano in Okemah's
450-seat Crystal Theater as the audience whistled and clapped along.
   ``I sat there with chill bumps and with tears,'' said Guthrie's
65-year-old sister, Mary Jo Edgmon, who represented the Guthrie
family. His singer son, Arlo, did not attend the tribute just a few
blocks from the overgrown lot where the Guthrie family's house once
stood.
   Shows honoring the ``Dust Bowl Balladeer,'' who died in 1967,
have been held in such grand auditoriums as Carnegie Hall. But
Thursday's was the first in Okemah because people like city
councilman Bart Webb think Guthrie was more of a subversive than a
star.
   Webb, seething over the first of three tribute performances, said
he would ask the council Monday to paint over the ``Home of Woody
Guthrie'' sign painted on one of the central Oklahoma town's three
water towers facing Interstate 40.
   The ramshackle house where Guthrie's family lived before he left
Okemah at age 17 had been vandalized. Some of the graffiti scrawled
on the building called him a communist, a label his family rejects.
When the house started falling down, local officials did nothing.
   Leaders of this community of 3,300 also once opposed a move to
proclaim a national Woody Guthrie Day.
   Mrs. Edgmon, a resident of Seminole about 75 miles southwest of
here, bristled at any suggestion her brother lacked patriotism,
saying he championed the downtrodden and jabbed the well-to-do.
   ``If you'd read what Woody wrote, you'd know how he felt,'' she
said.
   Guthrie's ``This Land is Your Land'' has become a patriotic
standard, frequently played at political rallies.
   His songs provided a mournful but optimistic rhythm for America
as it endured the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.
   Among the 1,000 songs he wrote from 1932 to 1952 were classics
like ``Oklahoma Hills,'' and ``This Train is Bound for Glory.'' The
1976 motion picture ``Bound For Glory'' chronicled his vagabond life.
   Guthrie, stricken with the degenerative brain disease
Huntington's chorea, had indicated he wanted Okemah to be his final
resting place. The town 72 miles east of Oklahoma City, is a quiet
agricultural town surrounded by cattle-grazing land dotted with oil
wells.
   But when Guthrie died in 1967 at age 55, his ashes were scattered
over the Atlantic Ocean.
   The Okemah tribute was put together by musician Larry Long, 37,
of Minneapolis, who got a hug from Mrs. Edgmon after Thursday's
concert.
   ``He could double for Woody,'' she said, smiling and crying. ``It
took somebody to come in and put it together.''
   Some of the songs performed at the Crystal Theater were composed
by youngsters under Long's tutelage. The tunes were faithful to
Guthrie's credo, read by young narrator Jerry Baker: ``I'm out to
write songs that'll make you take pride in yourself.''
   Long said the performance, recorded both for an album and by a
crew from NBC's ``Today'' show, should help Guthrie's memory ``burn
a little brighter.''
   ``I've been to tributes from Carnegie Hall in New York to Beverly
Hills,'' Mrs. Edgmon said. ``None of them can top this. We're
instilling a positive Woody Guthrie in the minds of these little
ones. And they're going to be his fans.''
