   For songwriter Oliver Leiber,
something as simple as the title to a cheap novel can inspire a hit
single.
   Stuck once when his car broke down, Leiber killed time at a
secondhand bookstore flipping through the covers of ``horrible,
cheesy, drugstore romance novels.'' Then a title grabbed him:
``Opposites Attract.''
   That was enough to give him the gist of a funky song that
eventually became a No. 1 smash for singer Paula Abdul.
   ``I look at a title as the complete picture, in a way. This is
what I'm building up to. This is the big payoff,'' said Leiber, who
also wrote and produced Abdul's hits ``(It's Just) the Way That You
Love Me'' and ``Forever Your Girl.''
   ``So if this title is the payoff, how did I get there and what
is going to make that feel like a payoff?''
   Titles are not the only things that come to Leiber by accident.
   The son of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame lyricist Jerry Leiber, he
originally wanted to be a session drummer in New York City. But
after coming to Minnesota in 1983 for chemical dependency
treatment, he stayed to play drums and guitar for local bands.
   ``If you had told me that I would go to Minneapolis, Minnesota,
and that's where I would make it in music, that would have been the
most ludicrous idea to me,'' said Leiber, who grew up in Manhattan.
   These days, though, he's not entirely comfortable with his
thoughts of living part of the year in Los Angeles. ``I associate
so much of my success and the good stuff that's happened with being
here,'' he said. ``I get scared that somehow I'm going to lose
whatever it was.''
   In some senses the 29-year-old Leiber is following the lead of
his father, who with composer Mike Stoller wrote such 1950s
classics as ``Jailhouse Rock'' and ``Kansas City.''
   ``I don't think I would have been a writer or a musician if I
wasn't his son,'' he said. ``I think I went into that for that
reason.''
   But the younger Leiber, whose hoop earrings and reddish
dreadlocks give him a bohemian look, never had ``lengthy walks on
the beach'' with his father to discuss the art of songwriting.
   ``There was no sitting on his lap and `this is how you do it,
son.' None of that,'' he said.
   While his father was from the old school of songwriting
(``yellow manila pad, bottle of Hennessy, three packs of Camel
Straights late at night''), Oliver Leiber has a more modern
approach.
   After recording an instrumental track in the basement studio of
his suburban home, Leiber will pop the tape into his car stereo,
cruise around and sing along into a microcassette recorder.
   ``There's something about motion for me, and not being stagnant
and sitting and not being at home and not having the phone ring or
the dog wanting to play, that creates a certain freedom,'' he said.
   Leiber worked with his father and brother, Jed, on ``L.A.
L.A.,'' a song heard in the 1985 movie ``To Live and Die in L.A.''
Three years later, ``Obsessed,'' the first record Leiber wrote and
produced by himself, was featured in the movie ``Bright Lights, Big
City.''
   He then collaborated with Twin Cities singer St. Paul on the
single ``Rich Man.'' Abdul was choreographing the video for ``Rich
Man'' in Los Angeles when she heard a tape of ``(It's Just) the Way
That You Love Me'' and ``flipped over the tune,'' according to
Leiber.
   Dan Brennan, Leiber's manager at the time, got that song and two
others _ ``Forever Your Girl'' (inspired by Leiber's ex-girlfriend
from Fargo, N.D., and originally titled ``Small Town Girl'') and
``Opposites Attract'' _ placed on Abdul's 1988 debut album. Leiber
produced all three songs, which became hit singles. Abdul calls
Leiber ``My hero!'' in her album's liner notes.
   Leiber seeks inspiration from hooks _ short, catchy phrases. A
title can come from something overheard in the studio or from a
dictionary of cliches he consults. He likens songwriting to a
reverse process of connect-the-dots.
   ``I sort of have the picture and I backtrack and I go, `How did
I get here? What are the steps that are going to make this thing
work?' '' he said.
   Simplicity is the key to a good pop song, Leiber said. ``If you
really can't say it in a sentence, you've got too much going on.''
   A big fan of his father's songs, Leiber remembers what his
father told him about success. ``He used to say to me, `When you're
it, you're just it.' The minute you start thinking, `What was it I
did? How can I be it?' the moment has already passed.''
