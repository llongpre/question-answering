<LEADPARA>  SAMMY Cahn spent more than 50 years writing the words to songs. And now he has
spent 17 years singing those songs in his "Words and Music" show.;    Like an
old tune, he keeps coming back, always welcome. This is his third trip to the
Marines Memorial Theater, before he again goes to New York. It's the same
show, the same patter, the same songs, with three different but talented
backup singers.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     My reaction is much the same, too. This is a nice way to spend an evening.;
   A hero forever;  Sammy Cahn is one of my heroes. Anybody can worship Joe
Montana or Mel Gibson. Those icons will have their moment in the sun and
disappear, albeit with smiles. Sammy Cahn and the songs he wrote are forever,
and it's the public that keeps the smiles.;    Cahn jests a lot about his life
as a lyricist and wins laughs by pretending that writing words to music is
something of a lark. In one or two examples -- the Academy Award-winning hit
"Three Coins in the Fountain," for example -- he may have a point.;    But
Cahn wrote a whole catalog of lyrics that hang onto their wit and our hearts.
Here are a few: "Until the Real Thing Comes Along," "Love Is Lovelier the
Second Time Around," "A Pocketful of Miracles," "Love and Marriage," "All the
Way," "Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow," "A Touch of Class," "Saturday
Night Is the Loneliest Night of the Week," "(Kiss Me Once and Kiss Me Twice
and Kiss Me Once Again) It's Been a Long, Long Time.";    You want more? "High
Hopes," "Call Me Irresponsible," "The Tender Trap," "It Seems I've Heard That
Song Before.";    I've heard them all before, and, while Cahn's jests could
use a freshen-up, I'm never going to weary of the songs. Nor of the way he
sings them. The 78-year-old tummler (a make-happy guy at the Jewish resorts)
has just a wisp of a voice, but nobody sells a song better than a songwriter,
not when they've spent a lifetime at it.;    Cahn talks about his composer
collaborators -- people such as Saul Chaplin, Jimmy Van Heusen and Jule Styne.
He explains a lyric or two, including the line, "My heart will lose its mind"
from "Five Minutes More" that once mystified a film producer. He eulogizes the
De Castro Sisters for saving "Teach Me Tonight" from the ash can, tells jokes
about a stiff Doris Day and the operatic Mario Lanza.;    "I won't say I made
Frank Sinatra," Cahn grins, "but judge for yourself." And he belts -- OK,
pushes -- a handful of hits that, indeed, made Sinatra, including the best
city song ever written -- "My Kind of Town, Chicago Is." Where would Frankie
be without "All the Way"? Then again, Cahn made a few shekels on the deal,
too.;    Cahn dances through "Thoroughly Modern Millie," with its intricate
rhymes. "It won two gold medals and financed my second marriage.";    He tells
us that "Bei Mir Bist Du Shoen" is his favorite song because, finally, his
(Yiddish-speaking) mama could understand what her Sammy did for a living. But
Cahn, strangely, leaves out the name of the songwriters who created that song
in its Yiddish form, including the title, which Cahn adapted and the Andrew
Sisters immortalized. That was composer Sholem Secunda. Jacob Jacobs wrote the
Yiddish lyric.;    By the way, Cahn used to say that "Call Me Irresponsible"
was his favorite song. I won't hold him to it.;    Cahn appears not to be
getting any older. He still moves pretty well for a skinny, bald
septuagenarian, and, by the way, when he went through the audience shaking
hands and making jokes, he kidded a bald head that may have been sitting on my
shoulders. For shame.;    Cahn also kids himself, singing parody lyrics: "This
is my first affair/ So what goes where?" And Cahn tells us, "I never had to be
inspired to write. Just paid.";    Strong help; Cahn is ably abetted by a trio
of performers: Jordan Bennett, a big-voiced tenor; Linda Lloyd, a steamy
belter, whose "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" stops the show; and Shawn
Daywalt, a somewhat priggish soprano who sings better than she moves. You may
remember Bennett as Che in "Evita" for the San Jose Civic Light Opera. Harper
MacKay, on the piano again, has his usual droll fun.;    Cahn tells us that if
he had been born 13 years earlier, he might have been George Burns. I detected
a note of envy.;    I, on the other hand, am jealous of Cahn. I gave up
lyric-writing for journalism, never suspecting that clips get yellow, while
songs go on forever. As does Sammy Cahn. This man wrote "Time After Time."
