Golden Gate Theater in the seedy Tenderloin district.;    The well-dressed
crowd has not yet arrived at the place where Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking are
starring in the revival of the 31-year-old Broadway hit "Bye Bye Birdie.";

<TEXT>     From inside I hear a honky-tonk piano that is faint but positively
enticing. I step through the door and follow the sound until I find myself
backstage at the empty theater. Nobody's around, except me, a guy plunking
away at a small upright piano and another man -- very tall, tanned and wearing
a bright yellow shirt, loose pants tied with a rope belt and a pair of tap
shoes.;    "Don't Monkey With Broadway," he sings, tapping in a large circle
on the stage, unlit except for a small overhead light. The theater, empty,
echoes to his rhythmic feet.;    There is something magical in this kind of
scene, even at a small-time community theater. But this is the 3,000-seat
Golden Gate, and the tall guy doing the tapping and singing is Tommy Tune who,
these days, is Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor all rolled into
one incredible performer.;    As I watch silently, Tune goes and warbles, into
an uncooperative microphone. But even without the mike, his voice is clear,
with that grand tremulo that's exactly what Cole Porter had in mind when he
wrote the song.;    I could have stood there in the semi-light watching and
listening all night to my own private performance. But Tune finally concludes
by wiping a little perspiration from his face.;    "What are you rehearsing?"
I ask.;    "I'm going to do it on 'The Tonight Show,' " Tune says. "C'mon
let's talk.";    Tune's dressing room is a very homey affair. Despite his
short-term stay there, he's managed to fill it with personal stuff that makes
it comfortable. There's a couch, a makeup area and, further on, what looks
like a small kitchen.;    Tune offers me the sofa. He pulls a Perrier from the
fridge, and then manages to curl his willowy, 6-foot-7-inch frame onto a
chair, somehow coiling his lengthy legs up under him.;    Right now Tune is on
top of the musical-theater world. He just won his eighth and ninth Tony Awards
for directing and choreographing "The Will Rogers Follies." His "Grand Hotel"
-- which won him another directing and choreographing set of Tonys -- is also
a Broadway hit, and the road tour of that show opened last week in Los Angeles
to raves.;    Why, I ask, would a guy who can pick his Broadway or Hollywood
future, be touring the land for months in a 1950s musical revival now? That's
usually what fading stars do before the lights turn out on their careers.;   
Tune seems surprised that anyone would wonder. "I love it," he says, as if
that is all the explanation the question needs.;    "You know, I got this gig
in the Catskills (a waning show-biz farm system), and I was thrilled. And
Betty Comden (co-lyricist for 'Will Rogers') said, 'Tommy, you've got it all
backward. You start in the Catskills. You don't go back to the Catskills.;   
"But I love it. Everything is disappearing. I'm always getting in at the end
of everything. I got a role in 'Hello, Dolly!' (1969 film) but that was the
end of the big musicals.;    "I did a nightclub act here at the Fairmont Hotel
(the Venetian Room), and then they closed the place. I was too young for
vaudeville. Maybe now Broadway is dying. I don't know how long there will even
be road shows like this one, with what it costs to produce and to travel.;   
"I guess I'm an anachronism. How many song-and-dance men are there around
anymore? This show ("Birdie") kids Ed Sullivan and his variety show. There
aren't any variety shows on TV anymore.;    "Believe me, this tour is a
pleasure. It's a huge pleasure. It is my pleasure. I don't have to do it. I
want to do it.";    For Tune the appeal of "Bye Bye Birdie" is its small-town
American flavor -- "a wholesomeness, a naivete" -- which might approximate his
own upbringing. Tune, (yes, it's his real name) was born on Feb. 28, 1939, in
Wichita Falls, Texas, where his mother had him in tights dancing ballet at age
5.;    "That was what I was going to be," Tune says. "We never got to see real
live shows there, but every Christmas the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo came to
town, and that's what I wanted to do when I grew up. But then I just kept
growing and growing, and I began to look pretty silly in tights. I was also
pretty skinny.";    Like a lot of small-town boys dreaming of the stage, Tune
gathered show albums and doted on them, though he had never seen a Broadway
show.;    After studying at the University of Texas, Tune landed a chorus part
in the 1965 musical "Baker Street.";    But success was slow in coming for
lanky Tune. He did get a featured role in the 1973 musical, "Seesaw," a show
that flopped. But the role won Tune his first Tony as featured actor in a
musical.;    There were a number of other shows, but not till 1983's "My One
and Only," which he choreographed and starred in, did his career take off. He
won Tonys for both staging and performance in that show, and he toured with it
as well.;    He sort of sneaked into his ascendancy when the other big-name
choreographer/directors began to die off. Bob Fosse, Gower Champion, Michael
Bennett all carried the mantle in their time. Now Tune is virtually alone in
his stardom.;    It has all taken time even though he looks amazingly young at
52. He credits his youthful appearance to "good genes," dancing and the fact
that "I really enjoy what I do. I have found love and work, and I love my
work. I love doing it. I love audiences. Sometimes it's as hard as any
blue-collar work, but I love it.";    Tune is unmarried, and he avoids
personal questions. His parents are deceased. His family consists of one
sister, who teaches dancing.;    A lonely life? "Oh, no," he says of an
existence that is totally involved emotionally and dedicated to his work.;   
It shows when he talks with anger about a bad review -- which the New York
Times' Frank Rich gave to "Follies." He even seems a bit upset when I mention
I had seen "Follies" at an early preview before he'd had enough time to work
out the kinks. The Times theater columnist Alex Witchel recently criticized
Tune for working on both "Bye Bye Birdie" and "Follies" at the same time, and
he is still furious at her.;    "I just don't understand her tone. She makes
her living from the theater, and she writes this bitchy stuff." And then Tune
notes that Rich and Witchel, who just married, were coming to see "Birdie"
(last) Friday night, flying in from New York for a honeymoon in California.;  
 Another opening?;    "We've already had our opening," he says. "You can't get
away from them.";    When the "Birdie" tour concludes, Tune goes to work on a
new Broadway show, "Busker Alley," due to open next May. The show, with songs
by Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman, is an English show-biz tale about a
street performer in love with an egocentric actress.;    Tune says he gets
packs of shows sent to his attention, most of which "are awful." He says he's
looking for "ideas" rather than songs. If the book is good, he can almost
create the rest.;    And he has something entirely new, a possible film
project, though he says he's reluctant.;    "They don't give you the time it
takes," he says. "Do you know that for 'Royal Wedding,' Fred Astaire and Jane
Powell rehearsed one number for six weeks! That's what it takes sometimes. In
this show ('Birdie,') we've been playing for five weeks, and we are just
beginning to get some of the dances right. The movies don't have time. It
costs too much.;    "Right now I'm just waiting to see what happens. One thing
is certain: Nothing in this business is sure; $10 million is a lot of money
for someone to give you for a Broadway show. I'm not a producer, and I don't
want to be. I am beholden to what comes to me.";    What Tune is looking for
are shows "that lift the spirits. That's what we are supposed to do. People
leave 'Birdie' with more energy than they came in with. Writers seem to have
lost the craft of doing those kinds of shows.";    And Tune is somewhat
mindful of aging, of having less time to do what he wants to do. He says that,
as you age, your focus narrows. "You try to do more with less. It's like the
work of Edward Hopper, the painter. As he aged, his cityscapes became mostly
empty rooms. But those are wonderful paintings.;    "I want to do more
theater. Film hardly crosses my mind. Theater is perishable. That's what I
love about it. I'll be doing this show tonight, but it will be different than
last night. It'll never be the same as tonight on any other night."  </TEXT>
