   Actress Helen Hayes says Irving Berlin saved her
marriage plans with playwright Charles MacArthur by playing his
then-newly written song ``Always.''
   ``Our spirits were very low,'' she recalled Tuesday during a
two-hour salute to the songwriter.
   ``There were so many impediments to that marriage. My protective
friends were always warning me I was going to be in terrible
trouble: `He's fickle and he'll break your heart.' I was beginning
to feel fear and Charlie was disconsolate.''
   Berlin played them the song he had finished that afternoon.
   ``Well, we were healed and we felt secure and that became our
song for the rest of our lives,'' Hayes said. ``For 30
anniversaries we sang that or played it on the phonograph.''
   The tribute to Berlin, who died in September at age 101, was
held at the 1,010-seat Music Box Theater, which Berlin and Sam
Harris built in 1921.
   Samuel Goldwyn Jr. recalled that as a child he asked Mary Ellin
Berlin what her father did. Her reply:
   ``He writes some songs for a Miss Merman to sing. Sometimes she
doesn't sing them the way he wants and Daddy gets very angry.''
   In 1937, the Berlins took Goldwyn with them on their boat to
Alaska. There was a piano in the room where the children played,
Goldwyn said.
   ``Each morning he would come in and bang on the piano while we
tried to play,'' he said. ``It was very distracting for us.''
   Tony Bennett sang ``It's a Lovely Day'' and ``Let's Face the
Music and Dance.'' Rosemary Clooney and Howard McGillin sang a duet
on ``You're Just in Love.''
   Roberta Flack sang a vibrant ``Always'' and Dorothy Loudon an
emotional ``Falling in Love Is Wonderful.''
   Mandy Patinkin sang ``Puttin' on the Ritz'' with two sets of
lyrics.
   Songwriters Sammy Cahn, Jule Styne and Burton Lane each
performed a Berlin song.
   Cy Coleman called Berlin ``our No. 1 songwriter,'' and when he
played ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' everyone joined in singing.
   The show was presented by Berlin's daughters, Mary Ellin
Barrett, Linda Emmet and Elizabeth Peters. The American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers, which Berlin helped establish,
produced it.
