   Farm Aid IV mixed fund raising with
political lobbying in a 14-hour concert on behalf of the American
family farmer.
   A sellout crowd of about 45,000 people at the Hoosier Dome heard
more than 60 musicians _ including Elton John, Bonnie Raitt,
Jackson Browne and the band Crosby, Stills and Nash _ perform in
the Saturday night show.
   ``It would be nice if there wasn't a need for Farm Aid. It would
be nice if our government's policies reflected a concern for
families and for farming. There's all kinds of things in this world
that would be nice. We have to fight to make this government
responsive to our needs,'' Browne said.
   Donations for the fourth Farm Aid concert were still being
tallied Sunday, and final figures were not scheduled to be released
until today, said Farm Aid spokeswoman Linda Lewi. As of late
Saturday, $1.3 million had been raised, she said.
   The concert came two weeks before the nation observes the 20th
anniversary of Earth Day, and Willie Nelson and other Farm Aid
leaders took the opportunity to announce the forging of a coalition
with farmers, environmentalists and consumers to work toward less
use of pesticides and other chemicals in food production and more
support for organic farming.
   Postcards were distributed to concertgoers calling on Congress
to pass a 1990 farm bill that will help family farmers use fewer
chemicals and practice environmentally safe farming methods and to
provide a pricing structure that covers the cost of food production.
   Rock star John Mellencamp, who helped organize the event,
indicated in an interview that federal farm policy has sacrificed
the welfare of the independent farmer to promote corporate
agriculture concerns.
   ``I'm not giving up. The face of this nation changes by the men
that we admire, right, and I think that we haven't felt the
backlash of the last eight years yet. I think the '90s will reflect
that,'' said Mellencamp,
   Mellencamp, Farm Aid President Nelson and fellow organizer Neil
Young all played during the final, all-star hour of the marathon
concert.
   John made an unexpected appearance late in the program and
performed three songs. The British rock singer had been in
Indianapolis to visit AIDS patient Ryan White, who died Sunday.
   ``This one's for Ryan,'' John said before beginning ``Candle in
the Wind,'' a song he wrote about the tragic life of Marilyn
Monroe. The song drew the biggest ovation of the show.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson called for a moment of silence for White
during the concert. The civil rights activist and Democratic
politician visited White's family on Saturday, as did Nelson and
musician-actor Kris Kristofferson.
