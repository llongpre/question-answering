   The composers who wrote the
Grammy-winning song ``Wind Beneath My Wings'' are aiming their
ambition at another challenge: an Academy Award.
   The touching tune about worshiping loved ones was voted song of
the year in February, earning a Grammy award for co-writers Larry
Henley and Jeff Silbar. The song also was chosen record of the
year, earning another Grammy for Bette Midler.
   The song, performed by Midler in the movie ``Beaches,'' was not
eligible for an Academy Award because it was not written for a
motion picture.
   ``I watched the Academy Awards and thought, `Boy, I'd like to
have one of those,''' Henley said in an interview. ``You get this
award syndrome. It's so much fun to go up on that stage and get an
award.
   ``I'm hopeully going to get more songs in movies. My next goal
is to win the Academy Award.''
   Henley lives in Nashville. Silbar, who lives in Studio City,
Calif., is directing his songwriting toward an Oscar as well.
   ``I'm trying, since the Grammy award, to write with the best
writers I can and write for special projects,'' he said by
telephone.
   Henley and Silbar wrote ``Wind Beneath My Wings'' in 1981 on
Nashville's Music Row. Henley put the finishing touches on the
lyrics the next day as he sat alone on a yacht in the Gulf of
Mexico off Corpus Christi, Texas.
   An estimated 200 singers have recorded the song, with Midler's
version hitting No. 1 on the pop music charts last summer.
   The well-crafted tune, in dramatic and sweeping fashion, is
about one person telling another person that he or she is his or
her hero. The person being addressed is saluted for strength and
willingness to let others reap the glory of life: ``I can fly
higher than an eagle. Because you are the wind beneath my wings.''
   Warner Chappell, which published the song, says it has become
the most performed piece of music at weddings. It also is played
often at funerals.
   ``It gets people coming and going,'' Henley said.
   Silbar refers to it as ``the ultimate thank you song.''
   ``People have been looking for the words to say this and the
song just kind of crystallizes their thoughts,'' he said. ``The
stories I hear about it are wonderful: The song is dedicated to
fathers, brothers, husbands. It goes the whole boundaries of
relationships and how people feel to each other.''
   Henley says, ``It's become a catch phrase in America. I'm very
proud of that. I think that's one of the things hardly anyone ever
writes.''
   Both writers said the song fit well in ``Beaches,'' a movie
about friendship, even though the tune was written years before the
movie was conceived and was first a hit record by Gary Morris in
the country music field.
   ``The spot in the movie was the ultimate for a ballad,'' Silbar
said.
   ``It worked wonderfully in the movie,'' Henley said. ``It was
sort of a `Terms of Endearment' kind of movie. It was funny, then
it makes you want to cry. It leaves you with a very special
feeling.''
   Henley primarily wrote the lyrics, which is ironic because such
moving sentiments came from someone married and divorced four times.
   ``I've been single now for about 10 years,'' he said. ``I think
I've learned my lesson.''
   One of his ex-wives, who inspired the song, called him with
congratulations the night the Grammy Awards were announced.
   ``She's thrilled I'm sure,'' Henley said. ``She was one of the
heroes in my life. I've always been grateful for some of the things
she taught me.''
   Henley owns a place in music trivia. He'll probably always be
known for co-writing ``Wind Beneath My Wings,'' but in the 1960s he
was lead singer for the Newbeats rock 'n' roll group. It was his
falsetto on such hits as ``Bread and Butter'' in 1964, and ``Run,
Baby, Run'' in 1965.
   ``I think my story has been sort of interesting, from `Bread and
Butter' to `Wind Beneath My Wings' by way of country music,'' he
mused. ``From rock 'n' roll to country to pop. It's sort of a
strange route.''
   His fondest memory from the Newbeats is doing a concert tour
with the Rolling Stones and Roy Orbison in Australia and New
Zealand.
   ``It was the most fun I ever had,'' Henley recalled. ``We had
the world in our hands and didn't even know it.''
