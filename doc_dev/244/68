<LEADPARA>  IF NAGGING distractions such as a steady job, a family or an impending
personal bankruptcy somehow kept you from getting down to N'awlins for Mardi
Gras last month, be of good cheer. Redeem yourself in the eyes of Bacchus by
taking in one of Cajun fireball Zachary Richard's two shows this week at the
Great American Music Hall in San Francisco.;    Richard (pronounced Ree-SHARD)
is a Louisiana original -- an accordion-playing singer-songwriter who can
squeeze out achingly tender traditional bayou ballads as well as
boot-stomping, Mama-hide-the-china Cajun-rock dance numbers. Like the Neville
Brothers and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Richard is responsible for pushing
Louisiana folk forms forward into the mainstream of rock. Although Richard's
resume includes 10 albums on small, independent labels, his latest work --
"Women in the Room" -- is his first on A&amp;M and potentially the first to garner
mass-market attention.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     So go, dance the two-step, have a couple Cajun bloody marys (with extra hot
sauce) and in no time you'll be plotting your triumphant return to the
Crescent City. Richard has 9 p.m. performances today and Saturday at the Great
American Music Hall, 859 O'Farrell St., San Francisco. Tickets are $15. (415)
885-0750.;  PILOBOLUS' CHILD COMES TO STANFORD; Judith Green; IN THE
beginning, there was Pilobolus, the dance troupe that impersonated things such
as mushrooms and mollusks.;    Then there was MOMIX, its firstborn child,
which has been almost as popular in the Bay Area. In fact, it performs twice
this season: at Stanford University next week and in San Francisco, April
30-May 5.;    Coming up at Stanford: the West Coast premiere of "Natural
Endowment for the Arts" (Thursday) and the Bay Area premieres of "White Widow"
(Thursday) and "Yellow Moon" (next Friday). Each program also includes 11 more
short works. You get your money's worth.;    You also get your money's worth
of seeing the dancers, because MOMIX performs mostly naked.;    Performances
are at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium. Tickets are $14-$20, from (415)
725-2787.;     MONUMENTAL ART VS. A MAD WORLD;  Dorothy Burkhart; METROPOLITAN
Museum treasures in the ghetto, the South Bronx in flames, the Berlin Wall in
tribute.;    Former New Yorker Steve Bronson, now of Emeryville, specializes
in huge fiery paintings and environments that seem to say art can help
maintain some sanity (and values) in the face of a mad, mad world.;    Whether
or not you buy the idea, Bronson delivers some monumental work generously
sprinkled with images snared from modern masters Picasso, Pollock, Warhol, et
al.;    The exhibit is at San Jose State University Art Gallery, Art Building,
near Ninth and San Carlos streets, through Thursday. Hours: 11 a.m.-4 p.m.
Mondays-Thursdays; 6-8 p.m. Tuesdays. Call (408) 924-4328.;  HARRY, THE WRITER
WE HARDLY KNOW; -- Murry Frymer; THE man wrote such songs as "42nd Street" and
"Lullabye of Broadway" and "September in the Rain." But unlike many other
songwriters of his time, his name never did become a household word.;    Which
is why a revue of songs that Harry Warren wrote is titled "Harry Who?" It
opened at the Mason Street Theater in San Francisco (Mason and Sutter streets)
this week and plans an open run.;    The show was first in production at the
Hillbarn Theater in Foster City last summer, directed by Ronnie Klein. Klein
is also the director of another San Francisco revue, "Party of One," which has
managed a five-year run at various venues in San Francisco and is about to
open in Vancouver, B.C.;    Harry Warren, who won three Academy Awards and
claimed more "Hit Parade" songs in his time than Irving Berlin, died in 1981.
The composer collaborated with numerous lyricists, including Al Dubin, Mack
Gordon, Johnny Mercer and Harold Adamson.;    The show runs Tuesday through
Saturday at 8 with matinees Saturday and Sunday at 2. Tickets: $20-$22. Call
(408) 247-7469, (415) 243-9001.;  A POWERFUL BLEND OF MUSICAL STYLES;  Nora
Villagran;  TONY Khalife and his powerhouse band bring their world music
fusion to the Foothill College Theatre, 12345 El Monte Road, Los Altos Hills,
tonight at 7:30.;    Khalife is a virtuoso guitarist, composer and tabla
(Indian drums) performer who has created a unique blend of jazz, rock, Latin
rhythms and Eastern music.;    His band includes Wally Schnalle on drums and
percussion, Dann Zinn on saxophone and Dan Ward on bass. Also appearing is Jim
Robinson on acoustic guitar in duet with Khalife.;    The performance is
sponsored by the Foothill College Cultural Diversity Center. Admission is $5,
$3 students. Call (415) 948-6674.;  JERRY GARCIA JUST KEEPS TRUCKIN';  Harry
Sumrall; THE Grateful Dead are an institution, as are their fans, the
Deadheads. It seems that the two can't get enough of each other. Thus, the
group sold out its traditional set of shows at the Oakland Coliseum during New
Year's week and did the same more recently at the same venue. And Jerry Garcia
and various collaborators of the group have played to sold-out crowds at other
shows in between.;    Now the Jerry Garcia Band is back for another set of
shows at the Warfield Theater, 982 Market St., San Francisco. The band opened
Wednesday, and they'll continue with shows tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m.
Tickets: $20 reserved. Call (408) 998-2277 or (415) 762-2277.  </TEXT>
