   America blessed Irving Berlin on his 100th
birthday, as such diverse celebrities as Leonard Bernstein, Walter
Cronkite and Garrison Keillor sang the legacies of the composer who
``set the world tapping.''
   The prolific songwriter, a longtime recluse, didn't attend the
three-hour celebration Wednesday night before a packed house at
Carnegie Hall, although he was believed to be listening via a
hookup from his New York mansion.
   The pageantry started big and ended bigger, with the Army Chorus
and soldiers from Fort Dix, N.J., filling the stage in front of a
30-piece orchestra, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts standing in the
aisles and Marilyn Horne's mezzo-soprano voice soaring above them
in Berlin's ``God Bless America.''
   Then, most of the evening's performers stood in front of the
audience of 4,000, joined hands and arms, and everybody sang a
lusty ``There's No Business Like Show Business,'' another Berlin
classic.
   ``When Irving Berlin began writing 83 years ago, American
popular music had no voice of its own,'' said the violinist Isaac
Stern. ``We were a hodge-podge of nationalities and noises. But he
heard nothing but melodies.
   ``American music was born at his piano. By 30, he was a legend.
Out of the fabric of our lives, Irving Berlin has given us a place
we call home. It was this love (of America) that gave him the
strength to write the music that now lasts forever,'' Stern said.
   Composer Morton Gould, president of the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers, recounted the origin of the
birthday tribute, which is to be televised May 27 on CBS.
   ``A year ago, I received a call from Irving Berlin. During the
conversation, I said, `Next year is your 100th birthday. May ASCAP
present a tribute?' Without skipping a beat, he said, `What's the
hurry?' So we waited.'' Six months later, Gould said, Berlin
approved the celebration and suggested ticket sales benefit the
ASCAP Foundation and Carnegie Hall Society. Gould said that Berlin
has written 1,500 songs, 19 Broadway musicals and 18 Hollywood
musicals, beginning with the first talking picture, ``The Jazz
Singer.''
   The event was a finale to a full day of tributes that began with
a midnight serenade outside Berlin's Manhattan house. At midday, 14
cast members of the Broadway show ``A Chorus Line,'' offered an
enthusiastic songfest at the Central Park Arsenal.
   Their spirited medley ranged from love songs such as ``They Say
That Falling in Love is Wonderful,'' to the torch song ``What'll I
Do,'' to the humorous ``You Can't Get a Man With a Gun.''
   On Staten Island, 15 handicapped Boy Scouts sang ``Happy
Birthday'' and ``God Bless America'' during the dedication of a new
log cabin named for Berlin. He had donated the residuals from the
patriotic tune to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.
   Meanwhile, patients in 100 Veterans Administration hospitals and
nursing homes around the nation geared up to sing ``God Bless
America'' simultaneously.
   Berlin was part of a pantheon of great musical comedy composers
that included George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and Richard
Rodgers. Of his theater contemporaries, only director George
Abbott, who turns 101 in June, survives.
   ``No one could take your mind off your troubles like Irving
Berlin. His music set the world tapping. You just had to let
yourself go,'' said Joe Williams, who then sang ``Let Yourself Go.''
   Among the other celebrities who joined in the speeches and songs
were Bernstein, Cronkite, Keillor, Shirley MacLaine, Ray Charles,
Frank Sinatra and Rosemary Clooney.
   Born Israel Baline in Russia, Berlin came to the United States
at age 2. His family settled on New York's Lower East Side where,
as a young boy, Berlin got jobs singing on the Bowery. He worked as
song plugger and a singing waiter at a Chinatown cafe. It was there
he learned to play the piano, laboriously picking out tunes with
one finger. The self-taught musician writes the same way.
   Berlin spent the day ``quietly at home'' and did not plan to be
at Carnegie Hall, said his secretary, Hilda Schneider.
   ``He's never made a big thing about his birthdays,'' she said.
``Let's face it, he's not 22 years old.''
