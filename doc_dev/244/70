   Laundering money from cocaine sales and a host
of other criminal activities represents a $300 billion worldwide
business each year but could prove the drug trade's key area of
vulnerability, a Senate report said today.
   ``Because money laundering is principally accomplished through
the use of legitimate financial institutions, money laundering is
the potential Achilles heel of the illegal drug business,'' said
the report from two Senate panels.
   The report released by Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., was based on
testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations and Banking
Committees last fall.
   It attributed to Assistant Treasury Secretary Salvatore Martoche
the estimate that worldwide drug revenues total $300 billion
annually, including $110 billion generated in the United States. It
said laundering all of this cash presents tough problems for
criminals.

   A 16-year-old girl died four days after
becoming the world's first recipient of an experimental lung-assist
device, leaving behind a grieving hometown but hope that similar
implants will help others.
   Melicia ``Mimi'' Harvey, 16, of Arthur City, Texas, who suffered
from adult respiratory distress syndrome, died Wednesday of
``worsening pulmonary failure,'' said Tim Madden, spokesman at LDS
Hospital.
   Mimi had received an IntraVascular Oxygenator, or IVOX, during a
two-hour operation Friday. The device is a 20-inch bundle of
hundreds of synthetic tubes about as fine as human hair, with walls
so thin that oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through.
   ``There were no clinical complications from the use of the
device, which added oxygen to and removed carbon dioxide from the
patient's blood,'' Madden said.

   Oscar-winning songwriter Jimmy Van
Heusen, who wrote such tunes as ``All the Way,'' ``Love and
Marriage'' and ``High Hopes,'' was remembered upon his death as one
of pop music's most important composers.
   Van Heusen died of a stroke Tuesday night at his desert home
east of Los Angeles, according to a spokesman at the Riverside
County Coroner's Office. He was 77.
   Van Heusen collaborated with such lyricists as Johnny Mercer,
Johnny Burke, Eddie DeLange and most notably, Sammy Cahn. He also
wrote for Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra.
   ``Jimmy Van Heusen was an architect of melody,'' Cahn said
Wednesday. ``When we were writing together, if I would ask him to
add even a grace note to the song, he would sit down and write a
whole new melody.''

   Question: If you call a person who speaks two
languages bilingual, what do you call a person who speaks one
language?
   An American, says Rep. George Sangmeister, D-Ill.
   He is introducing legislation today that authorizes $58 million
in federal funds over five years and matching grants to states for
instruction in foreign studies, language and geography.
   ``We live in an increasingly global society. We can no longer
afford a generation of children uneducated and uninterested in the
world outside the United States,'' said Sangmeister. ``We must
spark that interest and ability early so that our students become
proficient in foreign language by high school or college.''
