   Five songwriters including the late Roy Orbison
were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame during ceremonies
at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday.
   Orbison's widow, Barbara Orbison, received the induction plaque
presented by guitarist Eric Clapton.
   The others inducted at the Hall of Fame's 20th annual ceremony
were lyricists Lee Adams and the late Eddie DeLange and the team of
Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley. Quincy Jones received the
lifetime achievement award.
   Pepsico received the patron of the arts award and a film of its
musical commercials was shown.
   A variety of singers provided entertainment during the
three-and-a-half hour show, which was taped for broadcast on CBS,
probably the second week in June.
   Unlike past years, many of the songs performed were not composed
by the honored songwriters. A ``Tribute to Love Songs'' segment
with performances by Marilyn McCoo, Michael Bolton, Freddie
Jackson, Lou Rawls, Jeffrey Osborne and others did not include any
songs written by the evening's inductees.
   k.d. lang, Dwight Yoakam and Eddie Money each sang Orbison
songs, lang receiving a standing ovation for ``Cryin'.'' Lang and
Orbison shared the best country vocal collaboration Grammy this
year for their recording of ``Cryin'.''
   Liza Minnelli sang ``A New Life'' from Bricusse's next musical.
Newley sang ``What Kind of Fool Am I'' which he co-wrote with
Bricusse.
   Highlights of the show included Cissy Houston singing ``Come
Sunday,'' Judy Collins singing ``Bridge over Troubled Water,''
Gregory Abbott singing ``Teach Me Tonight,'' Rawls sounding like a
master tunesmith, Miss McCoo sounding delicious, Maureen McGovern's
cool ``Long Ago and Far Away'' and Patti LaBelle taking ``Look to
the Rainbow'' to the stratosphere. Miss Minnelli ended the evening
with her dynamite ``New York, New York.''
