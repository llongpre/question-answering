   Comedian Bob Hope has decided after
all that he will travel to the Persian Gulf to stage Christmas
shows for U.S. troops, but he'll change his act to make it
acceptable to Arab censors.
   ``How am I going to go without the girls? I'd hate to think I
was the only pretty face there,'' Hope said Monday night at
dedication ceremonies for the downtown Long Beach-Bob Hope USO.
   For decades, Hope has been accompanied on his Christmas season
tours by a platoon of starlets and Hollywood beauty queens. In
Saudi Arabia, the 87-year-old comedian will be forced to change the
routine.
   The announcement Monday reversed Hope's earlier position on a
performance in the Middle East. Hope wouldn't say Monday why he
changed his mind, but he was sharply criticized for saying in
August he had no plans to travel to Saudi Arabia.
   ``Palm Springs is my desert,'' he had said. ``The only way I'm
going to the desert is going to Palm Springs.''
   During the dedication ceremony, Hope poked fun at military
spending and the radar-evading B-2 stealth bomber.
   ``The U.S. government paid $70 billion for something that fles
in, bombs undetected and flies out. I've been doing that for
years,'' Hope quipped.

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Actor John Goodman has agreed to become the
first celebrity Santa Claus in a Christmas parade down Canal
Street.
   ``We hope this will be the beginning of celebrity Santas every
year,'' said Mickey Barthelemy, wife of Mayor Sidney Barthelemy and
president of Christmas in New Orleans Inc., the non-profit group
sponsoring the Dec. 9 parade.
   The blue-collar husband on the hit sitcom ``Roseanne'' has been
in and out of New Orleans since first visiting on a fraternity
junket in 1972. He says he hopes to own a home in the city one day.
   Goodman met his wife, Annabeth, in New Orleans while he was
working on the movie ``Everybody's All-American'' in 1987. The
couple married there about a year ago.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Two singers and three pianists took turns
rendering ``All of Me,'' Gerald Marks' most famous composition,
during the composer's 90th birthday party.
   Maxene Andrews sang first, then Gogi Grant sang a version with
lyrics written especially for the party Monday night.
   Cy Coleman, Marty Napoleon and Billy Taylor each played the song
separately before all three took the bench to finish with a
six-handed version.
   When Marks took the stage, he spoke of the foibles and triumphs
of his 75-year songwriting career and sang some of his little-known
works, including ``North Dakota,'' the first song he ever wrote.
   Marks also sang a comedy song he claimed lyricist Mitchell
Parish wrote during the War of 1812, but Parish actually was born
in 1900 - only a couple of months before Marks.

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A chance encounter in a dry cleaning shop
landed a starring role in ABC-TV's ``Who's The Boss?'' for a
5-year-old New Jersey boy.
   ``When I found out I got the role, I was so excited that I could
have exploded,'' Jonathan Halyalkar said.
   Jonathan, from the town of Ramsey, has been filming episodes in
Los Angeles since July.
   He plays Billy, a foster child of TV characters Tony Micelli and
Angela Bower, played by Tony Danza and Judith Light.
   A man married to a Teaneck talent agent discovered Jonathan 1{
years ago.
   Jonathan's mother, Carolyn, was dropping off clothes at a dry
cleaner when her son struck up a conversation with the man, who was
impressed and told his wife.
   Jonathan's character was written into the show after Alyssa
Milano - who has played Danza's TV daughter since the show went on
the air in 1984 - announced she was leaving at the end of the
season.
   ``Working with Tony Danza is a piece of cake,'' Jonathan said.
