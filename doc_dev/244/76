<LEADPARA>  Some people just don't like Christmas music. As the first notes of "Have
Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" ring through the speakers, they make a dash
for the door. Even if it's a car's door.;   But, hey, what can one expect on
Christmas: peace on Earth? Indeed, much of this year's crop of holiday music
offers anything but.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "A Brenda Lee Christmas" is one release that should appeal to several
crowds. It's got that country-rock sound Lee is known for - including Lee's
1958 hit, "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" - and also straight renditions
of traditional classics, such as "White Christmas.";   While the versions of
"Joy to the World" and "Silent Night" seem pretty square for a woman once
nicknamed Little Miss Dynamite, Lee's vocals make for first-rate carols. Teens
might roll their eyes a little, but a threatening wave of the Perry Como
Christmas album should put them in the spirit right quick.; Holidays at the
ranch;   Aiming to give your home a log-cabin charm through the holidays?
Check out "Cowboy Christmas," a collection of campfire-ready tunes from
Michael Martin Murphey.;   The sweet-singing Murphey has revived such uncommon
tunes as "Old Time Christmas" and created new songs out of cowboy poetry ("The
Christmas Trail"). Poet Waddie Mitchell injects narration into familiar songs
such as "Jolly Old St. Nicholas" and singer Suzy Bogguss contributes an album
highlight, "Two-Step 'Round the Christmas Tree.";   Two of the more
urban-style recordings are "Yo! Ho Ho!" by various Christian rappers and "He
Is Christmas" by the Christian vocal group Take 6.;   On "Yo! Ho Ho!,"
Gerardo-soundalike DC Talk raps through the title track, "Reason for the
Season" and "The King (Allelujah)." Because the songs are soulful and mild,
kids might try using this record to convince parents that rap is real music.; 
 Take 6, while more creative, doesn't fare quite as well on the whole. The
group's gimmick is that its music is made with only human sounds. The six men
harmonize, clap, thump their chests and slap their knees to create the sounds
in these complex arrangements.;   The album suffers from too much
conglomeration: classics "Silent Night" and "Away in a Manger" are
unrecognizable and downright irritating. On the plus side, the speedily rapped
" 'Twas Da Nite" is a kid's delight that puts the old " 'Twas The Night Before
Christmas" in a modern light.;   Visions of romance dancing in your head? In
that case, you're not alone. And if you are, at least you'll have some music
to keep you company.;   Although the R &amp; B trio, the O'Jays, had its biggest
pop hits in the '70s, the group has never sounded better than on "Home for
Christmas." The soulful trio blends outstanding vocals with dynamic horns to
make even the most familiar songs sound fresh.;   They also have a knack for
writing original Christmas tunes, which many artists have attempted with
little success. The smooth harmony and charming lyrics of "(Tell Him) Santa's
On His Way" or "I Can Hardly Wait Till Christmas," may rank these with such
new-tradition songs as "This Christmas" - a tune that no less than six
different people have claimed to have written and one that's been recorded by
several soul singers, including Patti LaBelle, Alexander O'Neal and, now,
Stephanie Mills.; Santa dude;   Considering that many of Mills' contemporaries
have made similar Christmas albums, "Christmas" is unique mainly in her
selections, including the Supremes-styled "Jingle Baby.";   Like LaBelle on
her 1990 holiday album, Mills aims for a sensual Christmas- by-the-fireplace
mood and, with songs like "It Doesn't Feel Like Christmas (Without You)," she
gets it.;   On the rock front, it's a slow year. In fact, about the only new
thing around is from the Beach Boys, and it's composed of old songs.;   The
"Beach Boys Christmas Album" is probably aimed at baby boomers, but it might
be for their kids. Brian Wilson's lyrics to "Little Saint Nick," "Santa's
Beard" and "The Man With All the Toys" are wonderfully childlike and the vocal
arrangements, as expected, are delightful.;   Bonuses include an alternate
take of "Little Saint Nick" set to the music of "Catch a Wave." The tune is
one of the great Christmas songs ever written by a pop/rock artist -- with
that insightful line "Christmas comes each time this year." Duh.;   So there
they are. With all these new selections available, maybe that Jim Nabors
version of "Silver Bells" can finally be retired.  </TEXT>
