   Dizzy Gillespie's big band, appearing after
intermission Tuesday at Carnegie Hall in the JVC Jazz Festival, was
exciting, driving, crisp and bright.
   Gillespie himself, in his utterances _ ``I'm in New York now; I
got to show off'' _ in conducting with a hip wiggle and in playing
his bent-bell trumpet, brought joy to the Tuesday night concert. He
followed a brief set by Marlon Jordan, 17-year-old trumpeter from
New Orleans, and his mainstream quartet and an hour by singer
Carmen McRae, who was in a joyless mood.
   Gillespie's band began on a peak of musical excitement, with
``Toccata'' from ``Gillespiana Suite,'' composed by Lalo Schifrin.
The four French horns used in that piece then left the stage to the
17-piece band, which sustained the pace with ``Emanon.'' Dizzy said
he composed it for a recording in the 1940s and named it ``No
Name'' backwards.
   Trumpeter Jon Faddis played exceedingly high and fast with
absolute definition and clarity in ``A Night in Tunisia.'' Dizzy
introduced that one as ``a tune closely associated with me over
many, many, many decades, mainly because I wrote it. It has
withstood the visicitudes of the contingent world and moved in an
odyssy into the realm of the metaphysical.''
   Saxophonist Sam Rivers was warmly melodic in ``Round Midnight.''
The concert ended with some bop for big band, Gillespie's 1940s
``Things To Come.''
   Miss McRae sang ``For All We Know'' and ``Inside a Silent Tear''
with depth of feeling for the lyrics but conveyed a lack of joy in
what she was doing.
   Her usual pianist, Eric Gunnison, was joined by bassist George
Mraz and drummer Al Foster, who were on an album she has cut of
Thelonious Monk songs.
   They were joined for seven interesting Monk songs by the
outstanding saxophonist Clifford Jordan.
   Most of the Monk songs she sang had lyrics by Jon Hendricks.
They included ``Ruby, My Dear,'' ``Ugly Beauty,'' ``Monk's Dream,''
``Straight, No Chaser'' and ``In Walked Bud.''
