   Rising country music singer Garth Brooks
says his songs are ``a piece of my heart.''
   The 27-year-old singer-songwriter-guitarist has had two hit
records with the first two songs released from his debut album,
``Garth Brooks.''
   His ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' which was No. 1 on the country
music charts in December, is about the need to tell loved ones that
you love them.
   His ``Too Young (to Feel This Damn Old),'' about a rodeo
contestant whose only friends are lonely women and bad booze, was a
hit record last summer.
   ``You have to let your heart talk,'' Brooks said in an
interview. ``If you just let what's in your heart out, you are
true.''
   Brooks, a native of Tulsa, Okla., where he was the last of six
children, has had a rapid rise since moving to Nashville in June
1987. Prior to that, he was a student at Oklahoma State University
where he was a javelin thrower for the school track team.
   He also sang with the group Santa Fe, a regional band that
performed throughout Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico.
   After relocating to Nashville, he took a job running a boot
store. He was able to earn a living while pushing his music career,
an arrangement some other aspiring singers do not have.
   ``I got the manager's job and got to hire one employee, my
wife,'' he said. ``I had a very fortunate start.''
   Brooks, whose stocky frame is usually capped off with a spiffy
cowboy hat, also began singing on songwriters' demonstration tapes:
tapes of new, unrecorded songs that composers play for record
companies in hopes of getting them chosen for albums.
   But his real break came when Capitol Records' executives heard
him perform at a Nashville Entertainment Association showcase.
Based on this performance, he signed a recording contract with
Capitol.
   Brooks has joined a handful of other young singers who are
apparently going to shape the country music sound of the 1990s.
   ``You just pray that you are going to be one of the chosen ones
still around in five, 15, 20 years,'' he said.
   He senses a change in country music themes, a change that has
earned his style of music a growing number of fans.
   ``Country music isn't `My dad got run over at the truck wash
right after my wife left me this morning.' The music is set in a
manner that everybody can relate to, not just the guy driving the
truck. It's very real and people are turning to it. It's not
stereotyped any more,'' he said.
   ``The music has got to be real. I look for things the common man
would say, such as the guy at Wal-Mart. Real people today are going
to Wal-Mart.''
   The cuts on his first album, many of which he wrote or co-wrote,
are touching tunes of emotion and life's roadblocks.
   The song ``Cowboy Bill'' is about a cowboy storyteller who
thrilled kids with stories about his days as a Texas Ranger. Adults
doubted his veracity until he was found dead with his badge.
   The cut ``The Dance'' is about the good times before losing a
loved one.
   In ``Every Time That It Rains,'' Brooks sings about a romantic
fling that loses its intensity the second time around.
   His ``If Tomorrow Never Comes'' was so evocative that he
received a letter from a Virginia woman who said she was
contemplating suicide until hearing the song and studying its
message.
   ``She said that ever since then, her life has been turned
around,'' Brooks said. ``Your songs are your swords, your power.
It's amazing the size of the sword you carry.
   ``I'm looking for beliefs that need to be stated in this day and
time.
   ``I try to let people know that they aren't working for nothing,
that what they see when they close their eyes at night doesn't
always have to be a dream.''
