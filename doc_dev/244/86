<HEAD>Irving Berlin's Wife Eulogized: `The Song Is Not Ending'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Irving Berlin wasn't there, but his words echoed
through St. Patrick's Cathedral on Tuesday as his wife of 62 years,
Ellin Mackay Berlin, was eulogized for her role in one of America's
greatest love stories.
   ``The song is not ending; it will continue into eternity,'' the
Rev. Anthony Dalla Villa told the Berlins' three daughters and
several hundred other mourners at the funeral Mass for Mrs. Berlin,
85, who died Friday. ``To use your father's words, `Always,
always.'''
   Berlin, who is now 100 and has shunned public occasions for
decades, wrote the songs ``Always'' and ``The Song is Ended'' for
his wife, the daughter of a socially prominent family who married
the composer over her father's vehement objections.
   Their marriage, on Jan. 4, 1926, was one of the most publicized
social events of its era. Mrs. Berlin's father, Clarence,
threatened to disinherit his daughter for marrying Berlin, a
Russian immigrant and a widower.
   Mrs. Berlin was a successful author whose works included four
novels.
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor, in brief remarks at the end of the
Mass, praised Mrs. Berlin for having had ``the courage and common
sense ... to recognize the fraudulence'' of social conventions and
follow her heart.
   ``No man could have given the joy to the world (that has been)
given by Irving Berlin without the love of a woman like Mrs.
Berlin,'' O'Connor said.
   Among the mourners at the funeral were Kitty Carlisle Hart,
former Mayor John Lindsay, David and Helen Gurley Brown and Jean
MacArthur, the widow of Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
