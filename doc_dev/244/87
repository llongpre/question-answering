   One night David Bromberg, who'd played guitar live with Arlo
Guthrie on his hit ``Alice's Restaurant'' on New York
``underground'' radio station WBAI, and Walker were ``hobnobbing
around in the Village.'' Bromberg persuaded Walker to go to WBAI and
perform ``Mr. Bojangles.'' The station recorded it and kept playing
it. People listening to Circus Maximus in Greenwich Village would
ask who wrote ``Mr. Bojangles.'' Walker was hot. He says, ``I cut
three albums in about a five-month period.
   ``I didn't like the city atmosphere of cutting records. I decided
I wanted to get out. I live my life. In the '70s I was in Texas.
Doing what I wanted to do, I wound up having the strongest part of
my career.
   ``I don't have a career. I have an adventure with a guitar.''
   With his Lost Gonzo Band, Walker cut four records between 1974
and '78. ``Viva Terlingua'' became his biggest-selling album.
   These days, Walker travels with another Texas
performer-songwriter and their guitars. He says, ``I go out and work
about 10 days a month, on average. Any more money than that and
you've got to pay the IRS all of it.
   ``The Charlie Daniels Band goes on those huge endurance tours. He
has three semi-trailers and two buses.
   ``You can play it on the guitar and people will be touched. I
played two nights in a beautiful wooden concert hall in Hanover,
N.H., with 1,100 people there. Three nights later I was in Keene,
N.H., a theater that held about 750 people. I had two guitars and my
songs and stories. People had a great time. You need to have a
well-rounded repertoire. The symplicity of doing it is enjoyable. It
leaves room for profit for the promoter and the artist.
   ``Steve Fromholz opens for me. He wrote `I'd Have To Be Crazy'
for Willie Nelson. I've cut a duet with Willie, one of Steve's
songs, `The Man with the Big Hat's Buying.' Steve and I have been
doing it for the last few concerts as an encore and it has been
knocking them out.
   ``It was time to do something simple again.
   ``I was running myself pretty ragged through the 1970s with the
Gonzo Band. We did 150 or 200 shows a year, an album every six
months and were partying pretty hard while we were touring. We'd
party at night, travel, do a show. We had two chartered planes with
us. If we were within an hour's flight of New Orleans we'd fly there
and party in the French Quarter till 5 in the morning. We were
tearing it up. We were on that kind of roll. We thought it was fun.
   ``In 1979 I found out I had five years with no tax records. My
people had paid some but the records were shoddy. I owed quite a bit
and penalties. I had a lot of that to catch up.
   ``When I hit 1980 I decided it was time to make some lifestyle
changes and patch some holes up. I had a 2-year-old daughter. I
started scaling down a bit, some tours with the band and some solo.
I got my wife more involved with the accounting and myself more
entangled with the business end of it. She has been my manager since
1985.
   ``I had to re-mortgage the house. This is the first year since
1968 I don't owe anything. I'm actually able to make some gains.
   ``Jessie Jane is 10 now and Django Cody is 6. I wrote `Django's
Lullaby' for him. I make up a lot of songs I don't write down, that
my family can feel and hear them, that I can make my home happy with
my music.
   ``Django's going to be a golfer. I've been telling him you can
play golf longer than any other sport. With golf and a little music,
he can have a good life.''
   At 46, Walker has long-range goals. ``I want to be a productive
artist. I want to chronicle my life as I go through it, the hell
raising and having fun when I was younger, kids and family, the
deepening of my relationship with my wife. I sing about those.
   ``I think you realize you haven't told people you love how much
you love them often enough. I imagine I'll be writing more songs
like that. I've been lucky to have this career, not really playing
by all the rules. But the game is still a good song. That keeps me
in the game.''
