<TEXT>  (box) YAKOV SMIRNOFF IN MOSCOW . . . IDAHO: Comedy special starring the Soviet
emigre. Saturday, 9:30 p.m., Showtime pay-cable channel.; (box) AFTERMATH: A
TEST OF LOVE: Drama starring Richard Chamberlain and Michael Learned. Sunday,
9 p.m., Chs. 5, 10, 46.;  A RECONSTITUTED yuppie and her talking baby, a
Soviet stand-up comic in Idaho, a family shattered by a brutal crime and a
look back at a musical-film legend -- they're all on the TV menu this
weekend.;    As Yakov Smirnoff would say, "America, what a country!";    No,
they're not all great viewing, but there's more good than bad, particularly in
PBS's delightful "Fred Astaire Songbook" and the Showtime pay-TV network's
hilarious "Yakov Smirnoff from Moscow . . . Idaho.";    But first let's deal
with ABC's "Baby Talk," the long-awaited -- or long-dreaded, depending on your
orientation -- TV version of the hit movie "Look Who's Talking." It "previews"
tonight at 8:30 (Chs. 7, 11, 13), then moves to its regular time slot
(9:30-10) next Friday for its formal premiere.;    "Baby Talk" was supposed to
be on the fall lineup, but was yanked when its original star, Connie Sellecca,
had a falling out with the network and was replaced. By the time ABC settled
on Julia Duffy, the snooty Stephanie from "Newhart," it was too late for
fall.;    Duffy's new character, Maggie, isn't a spoiled yuppie this time.
Instead, she's a lively single mom with a baby who "thinks" his dialogue in
the voice of Tony "Who's the Boss?" Danza.;    As the producers of "Look Who's
Talking" discovered when last year's sequel bombed, this is a concept that
gets old really quickly. In fact, it's obvious the series has no future once
baby Mickey (played by twins Paul and Ryan Jessup) starts learning to talk for
himself.;    Still, there are quite a few good snickers in tonight's show,
particularly when Mickey meets up with Danielle, the infant daughter of
Maggie's boyfriend, and starts hitting on her.;     "I love pink," says
Danielle, who's dressed in it. "It makes me feel so feminine. I hope I'm a
girl.";    "I hope so, too," says the leering Mickey, who gets so excited that
Mom has to change his diaper.;    Yes, a little of this goes a long way, but
I'll be happy to suffer through a few more half hours for a few snickers and a
lot of Julia Duffy.;    Much more to my taste is PBS's "Fred Astaire
Songbook," a special in the regular "Great Performances" series. It plays
Saturday night at 8:30 on Ch. 54.;    Hosted by Audrey Hepburn, Astaire's
co-star in "Funny Face" (1957), the special approaches the late, great dancing
star primarily as a singer for whom some of the country's legendary
songwriters penned some of their best songs.;    They knew what they were
doing, too, as the liberal selection of film clips aptly demonstrates. We see
Astaire singing Gershwin's "A Foggy Day" and "They Can't Take That Away From
Me," Berlin's "Isn't This a Lovely Day" and "Easter Parade," and dozens more
from Cole Porter ("Night and Day"), Jerome Kern ("Lovely to Look At"), Johnny
Mercer ("One for My Baby") and many others.;    The show also is stuffed with
rare footage -- including a rejected version of "I Wanna Be a Dancing Man"
from "Belle of New York" -- and oddities from early TV, including Astaire's
somewhat rumpled 1958 gig on "The Oscar Levant Show.";    Lots of anecdotes
also flow from people who knew Astaire, including songwriter Burton Lane, who
wrote a song at age 17 that he dreamed Astaire someday would sing.
Miraculously, Astaire not only sang Lane's "You're All the World to Me" in the
1951 film "Royal Wedding" but turned it into an immortal movie moment by
making it his renowned "dancing on the ceiling" number.;    We even get to
hear Astaire singing the hit tune he wrote with Johnny Mercer, "I'm Building
Up to an Awful Letdown," in a tape from an early "Dick Cavett Show.";    His
secret for putting across a song, most of the experts agree, was simplicity:
He sang the lyrics in an almost conversational manner. He was so good at it,
in fact, that you might even forget he could dance, too.;    An hour later, at
9:30, Showtime brings on another outstanding entertainment: Soviet emigre
comic Yakov Smirnoff, taped during a performance at the University of Idaho --
in Moscow.;    Though Smirnoff still gets lots of laughs by comparing life in
the Soviet Union to life in the United States, that's no longer his whole act.
He does an extended segment on parenthood -- he's a new father -- and even
takes questions from the crowd and turns them into fodder for his act.;    But
his glasnost-era gags really had me rolling on the floor. Item: His uncle
writes that glasnost has so changed Soviet life that you can even walk up to
the Kremlin wall and urinate. Of course, you can't unzip your pants, but still
. . .;    Smirnoff also shows us some funny -- and even touching -- scenes
from his recent real-life return to Moscow, including a visit to his original
home. Will he someday take his American-born daughter, Natasha, to see her
ancestral land?;    "Yes, if she has any behavior problems," he says. "Couple
of days in Soviet day-care center will straighten her right out.";    Finally,
there's the grim CBS movie, "Aftermath: A Test of Love," which turns up Sunday
night at 9 (Chs. 5, 10, 46). It's the true story of what happened to an
American family after a violent crime kills the mother and leaves one of the
children brain-damaged and fighting for life.;    Frankly, it was way too grim
for me, particularly the horrifying scenes where armed robbers force the
victims of a holdup to drink drain cleaner before shooting them in the head.; 
  But "Aftermath" is worth watching for one overwhelming reason: a towering
performance by Richard Chamberlain in a real change of pace from his usual
heroic roles. Here he's a middle-aged, grieving father, trying to cope with
the death of his wife (Michael Learned) and the tragic injuries to his teen
age son (Dennis Heames).;    Chamberlain has never been so moving -- or
vulnerable -- than as the guilt-ridden father who has to hold his family
together after making them a lower priority in his life for way too long.;   
It may not be the most cheerful way to end an otherwise uplifting TV weekend,
but it might be the show that sticks longest in your memory afterward.  </TEXT>
