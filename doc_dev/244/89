Kirby was sitting at the piano in front of a window. It was raining, as it does 
in the San Fernando Valley, as if it would not stop until water reached the 
windowsills. There was a fireplace with a soft fire gossiping to itself and the 
scent of the rain. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby Tepper's parents weren't home, and Kirby was entertaining himself and me 
by playing the piano. He played an insistent melody, with the refrain picking 
up the counterpoints of the rain and the fire. "What's that, Kirby?" I asked 
after awhile. He said, "Oh, nothing. I'm just noodling." 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of melody scrap that hurts like a half-forgotten love you 
thought was safely laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
I thought to myself that Kirby, then about 16, had a pouch full of gifts. The 
kid could dance, sing, compose, play the piano like an angel. He is the son of 
very high-test friends of mine, his father a trial lawyer and his mother a 
television executive, and I have rejoiced in their friendship for more than 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby, even at 16, had the effortless style of a seasoned pro, the kind of 
presentation that is seldom in place until it has been shined and molded by 
nights without end in front of an audience. 
</P>
<P>
I saw him again the other night at the Cinegrill. When we turned the corner to 
the parking lot, I saw the name Kirby Tepper in lights on the sign on top of 
the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. I screamed with delight. He has a nightclub act, 
with songs he has written, tongue-in-cheek songs, love songs. 
</P>
<P>
Since that rainy afternoon when I knew that Kirby was gifted with a large load 
of talent, he has done the pro forma internship. He made the pilgrimage to New 
York and landed a job in the revival of "On Your Toes," directed by its 
originator, George Abbott, one of the revered names in musical comedy history. 
It was the year Abbott received the Kennedy Center honors for his body of work. 
So the show ran for a couple of weeks in Washington, D.C., and then went to 
Broadway, where it ran for a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Then Kirby came back to Los Angeles and continued to study his craft. He wrote 
and was the linchpin in a show called, "Back Home -- A Los Angeles Musical," at 
the Cast Theater in Hollywood. Kirby closed the show after six months because 
he wanted to do other things, and every week of its run, "Back Home" was named 
Critics' Choice for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I asked him the other day what was the toughest material to write. He looked at 
me as if I were speaking Urdu. "It isn't hard," he said. "It all comes easy. I 
love to do the comic songs and have the people laugh. It's like doing a comic 
scene." 
</P>
<P>
He has been commissioned to write numbers for other performers, which he also 
likes to do. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Simon, brother of the icon Neil Simon, worked with Kirby on writing 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
The act opens with a song called, "Don't You Just Love It Here," a paean to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The pace and feeling change with a song about two people in love who then look 
at each other and realize there is nothing there but a bittersweet fragrance in 
the air. He calls it, "What Happened This Time." Kirby is joined for this and 
other numbers by singer Kimberlee Baxter. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby does a good-natured send-up of Michael Feinstein, playing the piano 
thumpingly and hitting some fractured glissandos and vocal clinkers. 
</P>
<P>
One of his songs is, "The Girl With Her Hair in a Bun," which is a study of 
every toplofty ballerina who ever looked down her delicate nose at any other 
kind of dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby does a comedy song on the Santa Fe-Sedona craze, which caused perfectly 
sane people to do their houses in desert colors with replicas of Indian 
cliff-dweller ladders reaching up to nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
His accompanist for the evening is a young man named David Holcenberg. 
</P>
<P>
He will appear at the Cinegrill again toward the end of summer, and he will 
return to the Gardenia, a Hollywood nightclub that has sent forth a number of 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
When I saw him at the Cinegrill, I thought of that young boy sitting at the 
piano on a rainy afternoon, "just noodling." Now his name is in lights.
