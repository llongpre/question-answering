   The singer who provided the voice of
Cinderella in the animated film has filed a $20 million lawsuit
claiming that Disney violated her contract by producing
videocassettes of the classic.
   Ilene Woods Shaughnessy, who in 1948 was paid $2,500, said in
the suit that her contract forbids Disney from making copies of the
movie for sale to the public.
   ``In 1988, defendant Disney commenced production and marketing
for sale to the public videocassette versions of `Cinderella,' all
of which has been done without plaintiff's consent,'' the suit
said.
   Steve Feldstein, a spokesman for the home video division of
Disney, said the company had not seen the suit and had no comment.
   Shaughnessy, who lives in Woodland Hills, was 22 when she
provided the voice of Cinderella, said Dave Smith, archivist for
Walt Disney Productions.
   Walt Disney liked her clear delivery when he heard her sing for
the movie's composers, according to company records kept by Smith.
   She performed such songs as ``So This is Love'' and ``A Dream is
a Wish Your Heart Makes'' for the movie, he said.
   Shaughnessy also sang on radio programs, including ``The Bing
Crosby Show'' and ``The Paul Whiteman Show,'' Smith said.
   The suit is similar to at least two others brought against
Disney.
   Singer Peggy Lee won a summary judgment in April against Disney
in a suit in which she claimed the company needed her approval
before releasing the videocassette version of ``Lady and the
Tramp.''
   Lee provided voices and co-wrote songs for the 1955 animated
film.
   Singer Mary Costa, the voice of the princess in the 1959 movie
``Sleeping Beauty,'' filed a suit in May 1989 seeking royalties
related to videocassette sales.
   Shaughnessy asks for $10 million in damages for breach of
contract and at least $10 million more for her contribution to the
success of the videocassette.
   Feldstein said he didn't know how many videocassettes of the
movie have been sold.
