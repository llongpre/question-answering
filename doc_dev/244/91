<HEAD>Company That Owns ``Happy Birthday'' Song is For Sale</HEAD>

   ``Happy Birthday to You,'' a song that seems to
belong to everyone, can be bought by whoever purchases the company
that owns its copyright.
   The Sengstack family of Princeton, N.J., which for half a
century has owned Birchtree Ltd., the company that holds the
copyright to the song, has decided to sell the company, The New
York Times reported today.
   The concern could sell for $12 million or more.
   ``Happy Birthday'' brings in about $1 million a year, the
newspaper said. The song's 75-year copyright expires in 2010, when
it enters the public domain.
   Patty Smith Hill and her sister, Mildred J. Hill, two
kindergarten teachers from Louisville, Ky., who also taught Sunday
school, wrote the song. It was included in ``Song Stories for the
Sunday School,'' a book they wrote in 1893.
   In its original version, the ``Happy Birthday'' melody had the
lyrics: ``Good Morning to you, good morning to you, good morning
dear children, good morning to all.''
   Only later did the sisters add the birthday words.
   ``Happy Birthday,'' is one of the three most popular songs in
the English language along with ``Auld Lang Syne'' and ``For He's a
Jolly Good Fellow,'' according to the Guinness Book of World
Records.
   ``Happy Birthday'' is also sung in many other languages,
including Spanish, Dutch, Swedish and Malaysian.
   The Sengstack family acquired the song when John F. Sengstack, a
New York accountant, bought the Clayton F. Summy Co., a Chicago
sheet-music retailer that published the Hill sisters' work. The
copyright was registered by Summy in 1935.
   Besides owning the copyright to about 50,000 titles, Birchtree
owns the Suzuki Method, a musical instrumental instruction method
for children, and the Francis Clark library for piano students.
   Some peculiar situations have arisen as a result of an effort to
enforce the copyright of a song as popular as ``Happy Birthday.''
   By law, any public performance for profit or mechanical
reproduction should require a fee.
   Summy sued Postal Telegraph in the 1940s when the song was used
in singing telegrams. The lawsuit was dropped when company lawyers
were stymied by the argument that even though the song was used for
profit, it was not sung in public.
   The company also objected when Frederick's of Hollywood
advertised underwear that played ``Happy Birthday.''
   Casio digital watches that can be programmed to play the
birthday song every hour on the owner's birthday bring Birchtree a
penny a watch.
