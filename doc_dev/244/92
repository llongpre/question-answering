   Jane Fonda paid a surprise visit, incognito,
to two of East Germany's most polluted cities to voice her support
for environmentalists there.
   Fonda said she went to see Europe's ``dirtiest and most
polluted'' cities for herself, the official East German news agency
ADN quoted her as saying Wednesday.
   The Oscar-winning actress, well known for her political
activism, disguised herself during the visit with a pair of
sunglasses, ADN said.
   Fonda visited Bitterfeld and Wolfen in the heart of East
Germany's main industrial area, about 75 miles from Berlin.
   Scientists have said the area, with huge chemical plants and
coal-fired power plants, is one of the most dangerously polluted in
Europe.

   Paine College officials were caught off
guard when actor Danny Glover announced he will set up a $100,000
endowment at the school from which his mother graduated.
   ``We did not expect this magnanimity,'' President Julius S.
Scott said this week, calling the gift an indication of Glover's
``character and love of family.''
   Glover, star of such movies as ``Lethal Weapon'' and ``The Color
Purple,'' announced the endowment in honor of Carrie Hunley Glover
when he spoke at the college's Founders Day convocation and
received an honorary degree Friday.
   Paine College is a private, predominantly black school
established in 1882. Mrs. Glover, who earned a bachelor's degree in
science and home economics in 1942, was the first college graduate
in her family.

   A music professor says he believes Stevie
Wonder may have copied his Oscar-winning hit ``I Just Called to Say
I Love You'' from another songwriter's tune without realizing it.
   Milton Stern, a professor from California State University, Los
Angeles, testified Tuesday in a $25 million copyright-infringement
suit filed against Wonder by sonwriter Lloyd Chiate 1985.
   Stern said the hit was ``extraordinarily similar'' to a song
Chiate wrote with Lee Garrett. ``One is based on the other,'' he
said. ``One is a progression.''
   Chiate, 40, has testified he wrote the song ``I Just Called to
Say'' in 1976 and the following year played a tape of it for
Wonder. He did not register the song until 1979.
   Wonder, 39, has testified that he began writing his song in 1976
and completed it in 1984.

   Singing has always been Hovie Lister's stock in
trade, but the gospel artist likes politics enough to spend his
winter days opening doors for Georgia senators.
   Lister, 64, who sang at the funerals of Hank Williams and Elvis
Presley, is an assistant doorkeeper for the Senate this year, a job
he sought from music fan Zell Miller, the lieutenant governor. It
pays about $1,800 per session.
   ``I just love politics,'' Lister said.
   The Statesmen Quartet, started by the Baptist minister in 1948,
has been cited as Presley's favorite gospel group and a major
influence on him.
   Flamboyant by gospel standards, Lister and his Statesmen were
regulars at all-night gospel sings all over the Southeast and on
Atlanta radio and television.

   Spike Lee says the strides made during
the civil rights movement are being eroded and that it's his job as
a filmmaker to portray ``the present state of racism today.''
   Lee, who addressed more than 1,200 people at the University of
Iowa on Tuesday, said racial violence in the Howard Beach section
of New York City compelled him to make his 1989 film ``Do The Right
Thing,'' about racial tension and violence during a hot city summer.
   ``In a lot of ways this country is going backward instead of
forward, especially with all the whole ... affirmative action and
all that stuff that people were dying for in the civil rights
movement,'' the black filmmaker said.
   ``I wanted to film about the present state of racism today. I
knew I don't have the answers, but that wasn't my job,'' Lee said.
``What my job was to hold the mirror up and let people know that
this is the way it is and unless we all make an effort to do
something about it, it's going to get worse.''

   It's out of the recording studios and
into the docket for the rock group Boston, whose leader is the
defendant in a $20 million breach-of-contract lawsuit by CBS
records.
   In opening arguments Tuesday, Don Engel, an attorney for band
leader Tom Scholz, said the company bullied his client, illegally
suspended his royalties and could not, or would not, understand
Scholz's artistic difficulties.
   CBS charged that Scholz refused to produce albums ``not because
he couldn't do his job, but because he wouldn't do his job.''
   The $20 million lawsuit, originally filed in 1983 against the
entire band, charged the band with failing to deliver the number of
albums agreed to under their 1976, $5 million contract with CBS.
Allegations against other band members were thrown out.
   The heart of the suit is a dispute over royalties that led
Boston to switch from CBS to MCA Records, which is also named in
the suit. The group's first two albums, ``Boston'' and ``Don't Look
Back,'' were platinum sellers for CBS.

   The Soviet rock group Gorky Park did more
talking than rocking, but a packed house of Madison-Ridgeland High
School students loved the show all the same.
   Particularly when the five Russian rockers, on a 2{-month tour,
talked about the bad old days when they honed heavy metal in their
homeland while dodging flying lead.
   ``Officials never liked what we were doing, our music, our hair,
the guitar music,'' said Alexie Belov, lead singer of Gorky Park,
which headlined last summer's Moscow Peace Festival with U.S. bands
such as Bon Jovi and Motley Crue. ``Finally they said ... you
cannot play anymore.''
   It didn't stop them.
   ``We had to play really wild underground clubs with bullet holes
in the walls and sometimes the customers would come in and shoot,''
Belov said Tuesday.
