   Del Shannon, who wrote and sang
anguished rock songs in the 1960s, including the hits ``Runaway''
and ``Keep Searchin','' died from an apparent self-inflicted
gunshot wound. He was 55.
   Shannon's wife, ``Bonnie'' LeAnne, found her husband's body
Thursday night in the den of their home 35 miles northwest of Los
Angeles, sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom said Friday.
   Hom said the death was being investigated as a possible suicide.
   Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said an
autopsy would be performed over the weekend. He said Shannon died
from a .22-caliber bullet wound in the head.
   ``It had to be impulsive,'' said his lifelong friend and
personal manager Dan Bourgoise. ``In the end, he must have felt
alone. All the paranoid things that made him write those songs he
wrote, like `Runaway,' _ I think he just ended up being that lonely
guy.''
   He said Shannon was nearing completion on a new album with Tom
Petty's group, the Heartbreakers.
   ``I'm very saddened to have lost a friend,'' Petty said in a
statement. ``Del was one of the true greats.''
   Bourgoise said Shannon had been depressed recently.
   ``He was disoriented and he was sick and he started to do all
kinds of worse-case scenarios in his head,'' Bourgoise said.
   ``He was lonelier than he should have been, with all the friends
around him,'' Bourgoise said. He said his friend had fought drugs,
depression and alcoholism as his career faltered, but had been
sober since 1976.
   Singer Bobby Vee said he talked with Shannon last weekend before
the two performed in Fargo, N.D., at an annual Buddy Holly memorial
concert.
   Vee also said Shannon was despondent about going on a British
tour and his recent move into a new house. ``I didn't realize the
extent of his pain,'' Vee said.
   It had been years since Shannon, who was born Charles Westover
in Coopersville, Mich., on Dec. 30, 1934, had a hit song or whirled
around in the popularity frenzy that surrounded him in the 1960s.
   In Petty's recent hit ``Runnin' Down A Dream,'' he writes about
listening to the radio while on a drive: ``Me and Del were singin'
little `Runaway.' I was flyin'.''
   In the movie ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Tom Cruise's
character sings a bit of ``Runaway'' along with Shannon's recording
in a bar.
   Shannon learned to play guitar at 13, entertained in high school
and, after a two-year stint in the Army, began playing clubs in his
home state of Michigan. An Ann Arbor disc jockey who heard him set
up an audition and Shannon flew to New York to record ``Runaway''
for Big Top records.
   It was his strong falsetto choruses on his hits, including
``Hats Off To Larry,'' that became Shannon's trademark during the
height of his career.
   With the late Roy Orbison, Shannon set a groove for American
rock in the early 1960s with country-influenced pop ballads, and
like Orbison he was swept aside by the British music invasion.
   Ironically, it was the British who most admired the talent of
Shannon, who had an appearance with the Beatles at the Royal Albert
Hall and was voted by several polls as the most popular male singer
in Britain in 1962 and 1963.
   His other Top 20 singles included ``Hats Off to Larry,''
``Little Town Flirt'' and ``Keep Searchin'.''
   Shannon and his wife of 27 years, Shirley, divorced and he
married the former ``Bonnie'' LeAnne Gutierrez in 1987. He leaves
three grown children by his first wife _ son Craig and daughters
Kym and Jody, Bourgoise said.
