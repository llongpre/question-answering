   Winners at the 30th Annual Grammy Awards waxed
poetic, gushed, cried, giggled and gave thanks to the music
industry, their record companies, friends, family and God as they
accepted their prizes Wednesday night.
   ``I can't tell you how I feel,'' said a bubbly Whitney Houston
backstage at Radio City Music Hall after winning best female pop
vocalist for her single, ``I Wanna Dance With Somebody'' from her
second LP, ``Whitney.''
   ``It's just so emotional. ... I'm nervous, very proud, very
honored, excited; it's very great,'' said Houston, who was a Grammy
winner two years ago for her platinum debut album.
   Jody Watley, who was named best new artist, thanked ``everybody
at MCA, my manager, I thank God, my producers ... my video director
... my publicist ... my attorney.''
   Veteran rhythm and blues performer Little Richard, who helped
define rock 'n' roll more than three decades ago, stole the show by
declaring himself the winner before opening the envelop to reveal
Watley's name.
   ``Y'all never gave me no Grammys and I've been singing for
years,'' he shouted, strutting about the stage for an amused
audience. ``I'm the architect of rock 'n' roll. ... Being a brown
Jew from Georgia, I had to tell the truth.''
   Little Richard, who dropped out of the rock life years ago to
become an evangelist, announced two years ago that he had converted
to Judaism.
   Bono, lead singer of the Irish rockers U2, whose politically
introspective LP, ``The Joshua Tree,'' won two Grammys including
album of the year, said: ``We set out to make music _ soul music.
... That's not about being black or white. ... It's a decision to
reveal or conceal.''
   George Michael, on tour in Australia to promote his hit LP
``Faith,'' was thrilled that he had won a Grammy in the rhythm and
blues category for his duo with soul queen Aretha Franklin.
   ``Winning the R &amp; B category with Aretha validates the
tremendous influence R &amp; B music has had on my music, songwriting
and creative process,'' Michael said through his spokesman, Phil
Lobel. ``Not bad for a Brit with soul.''
   One of the best acceptances at the awards show came from pianist
Vladimir Horowitz who walked off the stage with a twinkle and no
comment after being handed the prize for best classical album for
his ``Horowitz in Moscow.''
   Earlier, the esteemed artist thanked the National Academy of
Recording Arts &amp; Sciences for President's Special Merit Award: ``I
am so very happy that classical music still has an appreciation.''
   Ray Benson, leader of ``Asleep at the Wheel,'' a five-man band
that plays Western swing, said: ``It feels great. It feels amazing.
It's like you've been down 10 to nothing in the 9th inning and
winning.''
   The band won for best country instrumental performance for the
song ``String of Pars,'' which Benson said was for golfers. The
band last won 10 years ago in the same category for ``1 O'clock
Jump,'' a Count Basie song in Western style.
   He said it's sometimes difficult keeping a band together.
``Everyday, if you're asleep at the wheel, you're in danger of a
lot of things.''
   Suzanne Vega, who was nominated for three Grammys for her
touching song about an abused child, ``Luka,'' talked backstage at
Radio City Music Hall after learning she had lost the trophy for
best female pop vocalist and song of the year. She also was
nominated for record of the year, but didn't win.
   ``I was hoping it would win, but I was prepared for anything to
happen,'' she said. ``I'm a little disappointed I guess.''
   Cynthia Weil, who with Barry Mann won song of the year for
writing the sweet ballad, ``Somewhere Out There,'' said: ``We wrote
it for the mice. We didn't even think about a pop record when we
wrote it.''
   The song was written for the animated movie, ``An American
Tail,'' the story of an immigrant mouse family. It was recorded as
a duet by Linda Ronstadt and James Ingram, who were nominated as
best pop performance by a duo or group. When asked if winning the
Grammy made up for losing an Academy Award last year for best song,
Weil said, ``It does. It's nice to win an award that comes from the
music industry _ that's our home.''
   Weil and Mann are the last songwriting team creating from the
legendary Brill Building in New York, once a haven for American
song.
   Said Narada Michael Walden, who won the producer award for the
LP, ``Whitney'': ``I think the world wants new faces in a way. ...
Whitney is an angel and it's purity, like this flower.'' He was
carrying a red rose.
   ``I felt this was a very special year. My competition is my
friends. Quincy (Jones, who co-produced the Michael Jackson LP,
``Bad'') I love. U2 I admire very much. I think we are all great
music lovers. I think we bring the spirit down. We are all
brothers.''
