   The gullible among us believed that actor James
Dean died in the wreckage of his low-slung Porsche Spyder on a
California highway 33 years ago, but readers of Private Lives
magazine were not fooled.
   ``He didn't die. He lives on, maybe right next door to YOU. And
someday soon perhaps Jimmy, in his own way and in his own good
time, will once more come back and face the world that waits for
him,'' the magazine suggested at the time.
   Private Lives was not alone among the exploitation magazines in
suggesting in the weeks and months after Dean's accident on Sept.
30, 1955 that the 24-year-old actor was alive.
   ``I think people wanted to believe that Dean was alive,'' said
Alan Betrock, editor of ``The Best of James Dean in the Scandal
Magazines, 1955-58,'' a collection of Jamesmania from such
magazines as Whisper, On the QT, Anything Goes, Hush-Hush and
Uncensored.
   ``I think this happens whenever someone with a fairly rabid
following dies at an early age,'' Betrock said. ``Remember, after
the assassination, there were those who believed John F. Kennedy
was brain-damaged and living in the Bahamas, something that wasn't
too supported by facts.''
   Betrock has reproduced the pages of the scandal magazines in
full, along with ads for shrunken heads ``molded of virgin rubber''
and photographs of a woman named Lolita: ``If you like 'em BUXOM,
maybe you'll like my photos.''
   The articles are also accompanied by many pictures of Dean, the
wreck and shapely starlets such as Pier Angeli, Ursula Andress and
Terry Moore, who were linked romantically with the star of ``Rebel
Without a Cause'' and ``East of Eden.''
   The actor's death in the crash on old state Highway 466
transformed him from a movie actor on the brink of stardom to the
patron saint of young American rebels. His portrayals of vulnerable
and moody young men who openly expressed fear and pain became
standards for a generation.
   His mystique has endured.
   Rock songs such as the Eagle's ``James Dean,'' and David Essex's
``Rock On'' evoke his name. The movie ``9-30-55'' studied the
reactions of contemporary fans to Dean's death. A Broadway play,
``Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean,'' took
aim at the hopeless nostalgia created by some fans.
   Some magazines knocked the ``Dean is not dead'' stories. Lowdown
magazine reported that the deceased Dean received 8,000 love
letters a month. ``This is gruesome mental illness of the
unhealthiest order,'' wrote the editor.
   To prove the point, Lowdown printed a collection of letters.
   ``My sweet darling: When night falls and my stupid fat husband
snores at my side, I hold you closely in my arms. I know you are
not dead. You are disfigured and ashamed to show your face,''
writes one woman, who promises to leave her husband and five
children and shower Dean with her $4,500 fortune.
   The scandal magazines covered every angle. On the QT asked,
``Did Jimmy Dean leave a son? A persistent story coming out of
Hollywood claims that the teen idol fathered a carhop's baby
shortly before he died.''
   Did he commit suicide? Did black magic woven by ex-girlfriend
Myla Nurmi, a Los Angeles TV personality also known as Vampira,
have anything to do with the wreck? Did Dean steal an Oscar from
Frank Sinatra? These questions are posed and authoritative answers
are posited.
   A whole slew of articles purport to be the accounts,
first-person and otherwise, of Dean's secret friend, fiancee or
wife. Most of them are pictured wearing few clothes.
   ``He told her, `You know, in Hollywood I see the most glamorous
girls in the world. Expensive faces and bodies. But you're
wholesome and like a good piece of bread to a hungry man. You're
like sweet well water to a thirsty man.' That's the way he always
spoke to Betty Lou,'' Lowdown reported.
   Betrock, who previously edited ``The I Was a Teen-Age Juvenile
Delinquent Rock 'n' Roll Horror Beach Party Movie Book,'' does not
take all of this very seriously. The book's cover promises that its
contents are ``Exclusive! Amazing! Fully Illustrated! Possibly
True!''
   But Betrock says the sordidness of the Dean stories makes an
important point about a time that is often portrayed as an era of
sweetness and naivete.
   ``I've always been interested in the darker side of popular
culture,'' the 37-year-old record producer and editor said. ``The
1950s are often described in terms of Eisenhower and hula-hoops,
but there was a whole undercurrent, the underbelly of Americana.''
