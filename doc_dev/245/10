   A former sheriff has filed an $8 million
libel suit against the makers of the movie ``Mississippi Burning,''
claiming he was portrayed unfavorably in the film.
   ``They have sure done some terrible harm,'' the former Neshoba
County sheriff, Lawrence Rainey, 65, said today in a telephone
interview from his home in Meridian. ``Everybody all over the South
knows the one they have playing the sheriff in that movie is
referring to me.''
   Rainey, who now works for a black-owned security guard service,
was sheriff at the time of the 1964 slayings of three civil rights
workers near Philadelphia. The deaths prompted an FBI investigations
that led to conspiracy charges being filed against 18 men, including
Rainey, who was later acquitted.
   The movie, an Orion Pictures release, is a fictional account of
the slayings of Michael Schwerner, James Chaney, and Andrew Goodman.
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court at Meridian
charges ``defamation of character, libel and invasion of privacy,''
attorney James G. McIntyre said.
   McIntyre, who defended Rainey in the 1967 conspiracy trial,
described his client as ``a man trying to make a living the best way
he can, a man trying to live out his life peaceably.''
   A person answering the phone at Orion Pictures offices in New
York today said no one was immediately available for comment. Calls
to Orion's offices in Los Angeles were answered by a recording.
   McIntyre said he had received no response from Orion on his
demand several weeks ago that the makers correct what he described
as untruths in the film, including the actions of the sheriff at the
time.
   Rainey said the film falsely portrayed his activities and
attitude during the period and had wronged the people of Neshoba
County.
   ``What they said happened and what they did to me certainly
wasn't right and something ought to be done about it,'' the former
sheriff said.
   Rainey said he had been ``catching some playback'' from those who
had seen the film and his employer ``has been catching some of it
too.''
   The movie, directed by Alan Parker and starring Gene Hackman and
Willem Dafoe, has been criticized by some civil rights activists who
say it maligns blacks and portrays the FBI agents as heros.
