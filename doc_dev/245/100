Whose life is it, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
* Fifteen years after Watergate, Richard Nixon objects so strongly to his 
portrayal in the ABC dramatization of "The Final Days" that he tries to stop 
production of the three-hour docudrama. In letters to executives at ABC and 
AT&amp;T, the sponsor of the show, lawyers for the former President charge that 
his right to privacy is being violated and imply that he can sue for libel. 
According to his lawyers, Nixon's ability to do his own version of events is 
impinged upon by the TV drama, which is based on the best-selling account of 
Nixon's last months in office by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. ABC, standing 
by what it says is the fairness and accuracy of the TV movie, goes ahead with 
the show. "The Final Days" is scheduled to air Sunday at 8 p.m. (ABC changed 
its mind Friday on when the movie will be rescheduled should it be preempted by 
a fifth game of the World Series, moving it back from Nov. 5 to Dec. 17.) 
</P>
<P>
* In 1982, Elizabeth Taylor files a suit against ABC and the producers of a 
planned TV biography. The actress charges that the unauthorized film infringes 
on her ability to profit from her own life story. "I am my own commodity," 
Taylor says at a news conference. "I am my own industry." The TV movie, she 
maintains, "is completely fictionalized -- unless there was somebody under the 
carpet or under the bed." Taylor's case never comes to trial, and the drama is 
not made. ABC today says the project was dropped for creative reasons. 
</P>
<P>
* Two months after he was convicted of multiple murders, Richard Ramirez, the 
infamous California "Night Stalker," is the focus of an NBC docudrama that will 
air Nov. 12. The "Night Stalker" movie joins a variety of upcoming fact-based 
TV dramas that are moving from headline to TV screen while the event still 
flashes in viewers' recollection of the evening news. Among the upcoming 
fact-based dramas on CBS, NBC and ABC are the story of Hedda Nusbaum, the woman 
whose lover was convicted of beating to death their illegally adopted daughter; 
"Small Sacrifices," with Farrah Fawcett as a woman who shot her children, and 
the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
In some docudramas, the formerly anonymous people who happened into the 
spotlight have welcomed the dramatizations. But, in other instances, the people 
would have prefered to be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
Whose life is it, anyway? The question involves legal and ethical issues raised 
by the proliferation of fact-based TV movies. The most compelling conflict in 
docudramas goes to the heart of the Constitution: the confrontation between the 
movie makers' right to free speech under the First Amendment -- and the value 
of open discussion to the society -- versus the individual's right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
This is a murky area, and it depends on who the person is and what they've done 
in the past," says Robert Levine, a New York lawyer who specializes in creative 
rights. "With celebrities, it's not so much a question of privacy as a question 
of who retains the rights to commercialize their experience. There's a big 
difference between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Nixon. She's spent her whole 
life building up the property values of her life. With 'The Final Days,' you're 
dealing with events that are part of national history. Nixon's a public figure 
whose claim to own history is not consistent with a free society." 
</P>
<P>
Although Taylor never had her day in court to test her legal theory, the 
argument still concerns those who favor the broadest interpretation of the 
guarantees of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"One has a commercial right to exploit one's name, and Elizabeth Taylor has the 
right by and large to have facts told about her that are truthful," says Martin 
Garbus, a New York lawyer who specializes in First Amendment cases. "But Taylor 
is a public figure, and anybody can make a movie about her." 
</P>
<P>
The First Amendment protects what is said about public figures, unless it's 
said with a knowing or reckless disregard for the truth. That may lead to 
unseemly excesses in the media, Garbus acknowledges, but he argues that 
censorship is a far less attractive alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"People should be able to say nearly anything about an elected public 
official," he maintains. "If you start to decide what is protected and what's 
not, you get into very dangerous areas." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon and his lawyers argued otherwise in their letters to ABC and AT&amp;T. 
The former President should have been consulted on the TV movie, a source close 
to Nixon's lawyers said recently, and now has lost some ability to, in effect, 
merchandise his own version of events. 
</P>
<P>
"They've misappropriated his likeness to sell telephones," the Nixon source 
says. 
</P>
<P>
No one has an absolute right to privacy, and, generally, people who are well 
known have fewer privacy rights than unknowns. Yet average citizens can lose 
some of their rights if they become part of a news event. 
</P>
<P>
"Determining the difference between a public figure and a private figure can be 
very complicated," Garbus notes. "People who are public can become private, and 
private people can become public." 
</P>
<P>
The family of murder victim Jennifer Levin, for example, did not cooperate in 
the making of the "Preppie Murder" movie that aired on ABC recently, yet they 
were depicted. According to attorney Garbus, the Levin family fell into "a hazy 
area" where they may be public figures when it comes to what was known and seen 
in court by the news media at the time of Robert Chambers' trial, and private 
figures when it comes to intimate details of their private lives. 
</P>
<P>
Being a participant in a celebrated court case is one likely way to find one's 
life turned into a book, play or TV movie. Court testimony is a matter of 
public record, and it can be used in docudramas, such as an upcoming NBC movie 
about the white youths who chased a black man to his death in Howard Beach in 
New York. In some cases -- among them the trial of Jean Harris on NBC and the 
trial of Bernhard Goetz on PBS -- the court transcripts simply have been 
fashioned into TV courtroom drama. 
</P>
<P>
Although they may be able legally to portray a variety of people in docudramas, 
producers say that, as a practical matter, they often try to gain the 
cooperation of their subjects. That ensures the movie makers access to the full 
story -- and guards against possible lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
For a 1988 movie about Uli Derickson, the flight attendant who was a heroine in 
a 1985 hijacking, NBC did buy her rights. "We could have done the story from 
the public record without her permission," says Don Zachary, vice president of 
legal affairs at NBC. "But we wanted to portray a human side, how she felt, 
what her relationship with her mother was." 
</P>
<P>
"I always go to a highly visible public figure and offer them the opportunity 
to participate," says Louis Rudolph, who has produced many historical 
docudramas, including TV movies on Lyndon B. Johnson and Dwight Eisenhower. "In 
no way are we giving script approval, but they can look at the script and tell 
us what they know." 
</P>
<P>
But he says he did not follow that practice with his latest film, "Small 
Sacrifices," an ABC movie airing Nov. 12 in which Farrah Fawcett plays Diane 
Downs, a woman who shot her children. Rudolph says he made no attempt to 
contact the subject, instead buying the rights to the best-selling book on the 
case by Ann Rule. 
</P>
<P>
Neither he nor Rule paid any money to Downs for her story, Rudolph says. "That 
would be feeding into sociopathic behavior." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in many states, criminals convicted of committing crimes with victims 
are prohibited from profiting from dramatizations of their story under 
so-called "Son of Sam" laws, named for a notorious murder case in New York. 
</P>
<P>
As for "The Final Days," Alfred Schneider, ABC's vice president for broadcast 
standards and practices, says that the network not only discussed the reporting 
in the 1976 book with co-author Bob Woodward but also consulted other sources 
of information about the revelations it contained. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Nixon has taken no legal action against the movie. But, in a personal 
protest, he canceled his AT&amp;T phone service and switched to a competitor.
