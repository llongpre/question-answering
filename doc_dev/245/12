THE WORD ON 'TALK RADIO';

<P>
MIXED REACTION TO FILM FROM REAL TALK-SHOW HOSTS

And what do talk-radio show hosts say about "Talk Radio" -- that movie where 
off-the-wall chatter between listener and host bounces back and feeds on itself 
and where, from the very beginning, the viewer knows that the man at the mike 
will be assassinated? 
</P>
<P>
Some seemingly speak non-stop about it. Others are not talking at all. Still 
others have resisted seeing it. And KABC-AM (790), which likes to call itself 
the "talk radio" station, has banned any advertising or even discussion of the 
film on its air. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry about it," said KFI-AM's Tom Leykis, "because there was no need to 
kill the main character. Using the shooting of (Denver radio show host) Alan 
Berg was, I think, a smarmy attempt to capitalize on all the publicity that 
that murder got. Alan Berg was a far more interesting character than the 
character in the movie. . . . What really troubles me is that this is the 
second movie in less than a year where a radio host is killed. Remember 
'Betrayed,' where a liberal talk-show host got shot by a right-wing extremist? 
It's real convenient for Hollywood to use radio talk-show hosts as fodder." 
</P>
<P>
"It scares the hell out of me," admitted deejay Jay Thomas of KPWR-FM, who 
worries about "Talk Radio" prompting copy-cat murder attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"Some nut goes up there and shoots the hell out of him. Early in my career in 
Los Angeles, I was chased by a nut with a knife. I guess he thought my face was 
incredibly ugly on the bus. . . .," Thomas quipped, referring to KPWR's ads 
plastered across the sides of Los Angeles buses with his face and the slogan, 
"We apologize for Jay Thomas this morning." 
</P>
<P>
"The movie was so dark and depressing," Thomas said. "That's not the kind of 
radio I do. I play records; I make jokes. They threaten me, I take it back." 
</P>
<P>
"Talk Radio" is loosely based on the life of Berg, a liberal who was gunned 
down by white supremacists in 1984. Like Berg, whose show was on station KOA, 
the character of Barry Champlain (played by Eric Bogosian) had been in the 
men's clothing business and had a quirky yet close relationship with his 
ex-wife. Berg was killed in the driveway of his condominium after arriving home 
from a dinner date with her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible film," fumed George Green, president and general manager at 
KABC-AM. "It's a misrepresentation of what this business is all about. I told 
them (the hosts of his station's programs) not to give any publicity on the air 
to that movie. Of course, what they say in a newspaper is up to them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent 25, 30 years portraying talk radio as being a quality medium with 
quality people," Green added, "and they (the movie makers) took one small piece 
of talk-radio history with some murder in Denver and took a tremendous 
director, Oliver Stone, and concocted a picture that misrepresented what people 
listen to. They portray sickies who may be listening to other stations -- but 
very few (stations). Very few managers would tolerate that kind of personality. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Hollywood at its worst," he said. "This picture is not doing this 
community any good. There's enough hostility in a community without reaching 
down for an incident uncomfortable to people in our business. . . . The real 
world is conversations. Do you think there's any semblance between the motion 
picture and our radio station?" 
</P>
<P>
Larry King said the fact that he was the only actual talk-show personality 
mentioned in the movie -- "you're going to be another Larry King," Champlain is 
told early on -- "makes it embarrassing not to like the movie. Alan Berg was 
very liberal. Morton Downey is very conservative. This guy (Champlain) really 
had no opinion. I would not listen to that show. It's a kind of one-note show. 
The caller calls in. He's going to get angry. You didn't learn anything at all. 
I was bored. Mostly I was bored. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not racing out to see it," said Lee Larson, vice president of KOA in 
Denver, who had been the general manager at the time of Berg's murder. "I raced 
to read the book, and I found it very good and enjoyable. It captured the 
complexity of Alan, and it also helped you see where he was serious and where 
he was being a good entertainer. But since the movie was not a true reflection 
on his life, it's not the first thing I want to see. 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to exaggerate the talk-show host," Larson added, "especially right 
now with what's happening in television talk, with the debate as to whether 
some of the talk shows are trash television or a responsible form of 
entertainment. And Alan was certainly one pioneer in that area, being somewhat 
outrageous in the topics he chose to talk about, some of the opinions he 
expressed and the vehemence with which he expressed them." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the talk about "Talk Radio" was negative. 
</P>
<P>
KGIL-AM's Carole Hemingway deemed "Talk Radio" "a very powerful movie. Oliver 
Stone wanted to point out just where all the hate leads. It leads to a dead-end 
street, and we've been sort of inundated with the Morton Downeys, the Geraldos 
and their imitators on radio. . . . I'll tell you something that doesn't ring 
true. You never ever get that plethora of sick calls, one after another, but if 
a talk-show host spews and breeds hatred the way this one does, anything can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Despite concerns that the movie "puts all of us in danger," Leykis said he 
found "Talk Radio" to be the "most realistic portrayal of radio" that he's 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
"The relatively dark studio in which he paces around. He calls people names. I 
do. He hangs up, which I do, and (the idea that) talent is nothing but meat. . 
. . And the board operator, the engineer, was a carbon copy of the engineer I 
had 10 years ago in Phoenix. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
What sounded particularly false to several talk hosts was the fact that 
Bogosian's character would be told his program was being picked up for national 
syndication with just three days' notice. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, where he has been on WMCA for 38 years, Barry Gray said he hadn't 
seen the film. 
</P>
<P>
"It must be psychological because it played here in New York, and I didn't go 
see the play either. The Alan Berg kind of radio is not what I do. Michael 
Jackson (of KABC-AM) and I are much more alike. Today I talked with a local 
Washington bureau chief about (Michael) Dukakis' announcement he was not going 
to run for governor (of Massachusetts) again, and whether that meant he was 
running for President again. That's the kind of radio I do. I'm not into 
insulting people. 
</P>
<P>
"I think shock radio is going to shock itself out of business in another year. 
Like the Enquirer, there are just so many three-headed monkeys you can write 
about." 
</P>
<P>
And in New York, where disc jockey Howard Stern of WXRK has made a splash with 
sharp jibes and put-downs, agent Don Buchwald explained that "quite frankly, he 
(Stern) hasn't been commenting on that (movie) at all." Then, interrupting a 
reporter's question, Buchwald hung up.
