   The real-life participants in the rescue
of toddler Jessica McClure from a well got a taste of Tinseltown on
Thursday, appearing as extras in location filming for a television
movie about the rescue.
   However, most found that show business isn't all glamour and
lights.
   ``I think I'll stick to police business,'' said Police Chief
Richard Czech, who, along with crew members and other extras, spent
almost five hours standing in a chilling drizzle at Midland
International Airport.
   Most of the movie, titled ``Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of
Jessica McClure,'' has been shot in suburban Los Angeles, but the
crew is spending two days in Midland filming scenes of oil rigs,
drilling rigs and the city's streets and skyline.
   The use of local extras and local details, such as the actual
jet belonging to Midland oilman Clayton Williams Jr. which brought
an underground expert to the rescue scene, adds to the true-to-life
feeling the movie is trying to depict, said producer John Kander II.
   The film will show the story of 18-month-old Jessica's October
1987 rescue from an abandoned water well after being trapped
underground for 58 hours.
   Czech, who is portrayed in the movie by actor Beau Bridges,
participated in Thursday's shoot playing an unidentified man who
greets the underground expert.
   ``They're trying to portray this as closely as possible, doing
all the little details the way they should be,'' said Czech, who
also consulted with the moviemakers when the script was put
together.
   Police officer Andy Glasscock doubled as himself in one of the
location scenes because actor Walter Olkewicz, who portrays his
character, and all but two of the other cast members didn't come to
Midland.
   Glasscock, Czech and others learned that making a movie involves
lots of waiting and standing around while huge props such as
airplanes are positioned. A brief shot of the landing of a Federal
Express cargo plane took more than an hour to shoot and required
two takes.
   The normally sunny, dry West Texas weather turned cold and wet,
and a real Federal Express crew to be used in one scene disappeared
when director Mel Damski was ready to begin shooting.
   Kandar lamented the puddles dotting the airport tarmac.
   ``Maybe we can work in that in Midland they wet down the tarmac
every day,'' he joked. ``But we have no time to put (filming) off.''
   The movie, produced by Interscope Communications and scheduled
to air Sunday, May 21, on ABC, will be delivered to the network
just two or three days ahead of time, Kander said.
   Robert O'Donnell, the paramedic who retrieved Jessica from the
well, also took part in the production, portraying a television
reporter who walks off an airplane with the rest of the press corps.
   O'Donnell, played by actor Sam Whipple in the movie, said the
television recreation of the rescue will show things that weren't
captured on the nationally televised coverage of the event.
   ``It will bring out the humanity of it _ the places when I
cried,'' he said. ``It was emotional and that's what I want people
to see.''
