Was J. Robert Oppenheimer, builder of the world's first atomic bomb, the 
tortured, morally divided soul depicted in Roland Joffe's new film "Fat Man and 
Little Boy"? Or was he a man intently focused on succeeding, having made peace 
with his role at the helm of the top-secret $2-billion Manhattan Project at Los 
Alamos, N.M.? 
</P>
<P>
In his film debut, actor Dwight Schultz portrays Oppenheimer as a brilliant but 
weak man whose ambition overshadowed his inner doubts about the morality of 
building an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, says director Joffe, "is Hamlet as 
Shakespeare would have written him if he was alive now." This Oppenheimer is 
readily manipulated by the gruff military man in charge of the Manhattan 
Project, Gen. Leslie R. Groves, played by Paul Newman. 
</P>
<P>
But Schultz's portrayal has drawn criticism from other quarters. Richard 
Rhodes, author of "The Making of the Atomic Bomb," which won the 1987 National 
Book Award, calls this depiction "an ignorant distortion of the man. . . . The 
Oppenheimer of wartime was not a divided human being. He was not Hamlet-like. 
He was focused and centered on making this thing happen." 
</P>
<P>
Critics too are divided on Schultz's performance. When the film opened last 
month, The Times' Sheila Benson, for example, wrote that Schultz managed to 
create "a believably complicated figure." But Newsweek's David Ansen wrote that 
"neither Schultz nor the script gets inside the man's edgy, haunted soul." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz became a contender for the part of Oppenheimer when Joffe -- determined 
to cast an unknown -- asked his casting director to round up all the actors on 
American stages who were currently portraying Valmont in "Les Liaisons 
Dangereuses," a character notorious for manipulating and objectifying human 
beings. He found Schultz in a production at the Williamstown (Mass.) Theater 
Festival. Schultz may be not be a familiar face in Hollywood circles, but 
millions of TV viewers know him as the zany "Howling Mad" Murdock on NBC's 
former series "The A-Team." His stint on the "The A-Team" -- from 1983 to 1987, 
when the series was canceled -- followed a long career on stage, but Schultz 
had never appeared in a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Paramount were reticent about hiring someone without name 
recognition with movie audiences. But Joffe persisted. "He has a volatile, 
interesting mind," Joffe says of Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, ironically, also had an affinity for physics. In fact, he says, it was 
Heinz Pagels' "The Cosmic Code" -- an attempt to explain quantum physics to the 
layman -- that added important new perspective to his life. 
</P>
<P>
The transformation came in 1982, at age 35, when Schultz was struggling, 
sleeping on couches and barely scraping out a living as an actor. He was close 
to giving up on show business. Pagels' book taught Schultz to look at the world 
in more relative terms -- and not to take himself, or his profession, so 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"For example," Schultz says one afternoon as he picks up a copy of Pagels' book 
from a coffee table, "in the micro world of particles, when scientists view 
photons, if they want to view photons as a wave, it's a wave. If they want to 
look at it as a particle, they behave as particles. . . . There was a lot of 
philosophical discussion about this: Is it what I want it to be at the moment?" 
</P>
<P>
Schultz applied these philosophical meanderings to his own life. "When someone 
props you up and another tears you down, it's not a question of wrong or 
right," he says. "And for you to try to beat yourself on the breast and say 
you're a terrible person -- or say that you're a wonderful person because 
everyone loves you -- is probably going a little too far." 
</P>
<P>
His acting career up until then had been a struggle. He graduated from Towson 
State University in Maryland and formed a touring company, the Baltimore 
Theater Ensemble, with a couple of friends. Later he appeared in regional 
productions before landing roles in Off-Broadway productions. 
</P>
<P>
He made his Broadway debut in "The Water Engine," which began at Joseph Papp's 
Public Theatre before being transferred to the Plymouth. He also starred on 
Broadway in "Night and Day" with Maggie Smith and "The Crucifer of Blood." He 
played opposite Charlton Heston when the production moved to L.A.'s Ahmanson 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
But in between stage work, Schultz struggled to make ends meet with odd jobs. 
The financial hardship came to an end when Schultz swallowed his stage actor's 
pride and auditioned for "The A-Team." Again, Pagels' book taught him the value 
of not taking himself so seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the way you want to see it," Schultz says of TV shows like "The A-Team." 
"If you want to see it as the epitome of art, it will be. If you want to see it 
as the height of exploitation and degradation, it will be. Neither of them is 
true. The truth is you're simply scratching out a living: I'm a song-and-dance 
man. That's the truth and there's a relaxation that comes with that." After 
reading Pagels' book, physics became a minor passion for Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
Joffe looked at nearly 30 other actors before hiring Schultz to play 
Oppenheimer. As Schultz recalls, he was cast the day before production began 
and was forced to leave his daughter's 1-year birthday party to fly to Durango, 
Mexico, where shooting was about to begin. There he continued discussions with 
Joffe and Newman about how to portray Oppenheimer. "Being the typical actor," 
Schultz says, "I wanted to be very accurate (in the depiction of Oppenheimer). 
When I told Roland this, he just rolled his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for Joffe's reaction is that Oppenheimer spoke in a "clipped, 
affected voice that at times was graceful but at other times had a tendency to 
explode," Schultz says, doing his best Oppenheimer impersonation. "His voice 
also had a Mr. Rogers quality to it." Joffe didn't want Schultz to impersonate 
Oppenheimer's affected, often arrogant manner. "In a film about J. Robert 
Oppenheimer, you could," says Schultz. "But in this film, we wanted to make him 
more accessible, more of a human being faced with a dilemma rather than a man 
who spent his life putting himself above other people." 
</P>
<P>
Says Joffe: "I wanted our Oppenheimer to be as true as possible to the inner 
Oppenheimer. We wanted to get at the inner truth, to feel the real tensions 
inside these people (at Los Alamos). In public, Oppenheimer was a dominant, 
powerful scientist. But he was also a vulnerable, weak man." 
</P>
<P>
But Rhodes rejects the notion, forwarded in Joffe's film, that Groves played 
the devil to Oppenheimer's Faust. After the war, Rhodes says, more moral doubts 
did creep into Oppenheimer's thinking. For example, Rhodes notes, two years 
after American military planes dropped the code-named "Fat Man" and "Little 
Boy" bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer said to President Truman: 
"Mr. Truman, I have blood on my hands." During and after the war, the 
government viewed Oppenheimer as a security risk for his leftist views. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz calls "Fat Man and Little Boy" "an impression of reality, not reality. 
The attempt to make this human dilemma accessible was paramount, and anything 
that detracted from it had to be chipped away."
