   The scandal about ``Scandal'' is much
overblown, declares John Hurt, star of the movie about naughty
goings-on among the high and mighty in 1960s England.
   The British actor was recently in Los Angeles for the opening of
the film, and he termed the fuss over its X rating ``a storm in a
teapot.''
   ``The scene that was allegedly the demon was what we call `the
orgy scene,'' he said. ``It was certainly not a sexy scene. It was
really a rather tawdry, nasty scene behind closed doors with a
particular tired old (upper) class.
   ``It was directly opposite to what the protagonists, Christine
Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davis represent, the `Swinging '60s.' It was
a different kind of permissiveness.''
   ``Scandal,'' which concerns the sex revelations that helped
topple Harold Macmillan's Tory government, was handed an X rating
by the Motion Picture Association of America's rating's board.
After making a few snips from the orgy scene, the film was rated R.
An X would have meant box-office death _ few bookings, fewer ads.
   Hurt viewed the film before and after the cuts and concluded:
``It says the same thing. Apparently somebody took exception to
what is known as `rocking motion.' The `rocking motion' went, and
something else was put in its place.''
   The reaction in England to ``Scandal'' was something else. ``We
had quite a lot of flak for making the film. The Establishment
somewhat closed ranks, really. What I call `the poor old Jack
syndrome' came up. `Why drag him through it again?'
   ``Which is understandable, I suppose, but most of the criticisms
were made by people who hadn't read the script or certainly seen
the film. That's not surprising, I suppose, because they may have
thought that we were making some kind of specious movie. Which is
not the outcome at all.''
   ``Poor Old Jack'' is John Profumo, Britain's former minister of
war, a married man who was bedding Keeler at the same time she was
having an affair with a Soviet naval attache and suspected spy.
   ``I can't say that we did (Profumo) a favor, but I think the
film has put him in a different light,'' Hurt said. ``Our
perception is different from the public's perception at the time,
largely gleaned from the sensationalist press.''
   Hurt portrays the late Stephen Ward, an osteopath who was
charged with pimping for his celebrity clients.
   ``I think it's pretty clear from the evidence that he was a
scapegoat,'' the actor said.
   With his gaunt face and intense manner, John Hurt has made a
specialty of difficult portrayals. The most notable was the title
role in ``Elephant Man,'' which drew an Academy nomination as best
actor.
   ``Robert DeNiro would do something like `Raging Bull' the same
year,'' Hurt said about the actor who won the prizethat year.
   He was the mad emperor Caligula in ``I, Claudius,'' and the
eccentric homosexual Quentin Crisp in ``The Naked Civil Servant.''
   In ``Champions,'' he was a famed jockey who conquered cancer,
the inmate of a Turkish prison in ``Midnight Express'' _ for which
he received an Oscar nomination as supporting actor, and the
homosexual cop in ``Partners'' with Ryan O'Neal.
   Hurt moves smoothly between the London and New York stage,
television and films. Surprisingly for a stage-trained actor, he
prefers movies.
   ``If I were told that I could only do one medium and had to cut
the rest out, I think I would choose film,'' he said.
