   ``Darkman'' _
   With little fanfare and none of the intrusive hype that heralded
``Batman'' and ``Dick Tracy,'' a tidy comic-book fantasy-thriller
from Universal Pictures will fill screens across the nation on Aug.
24, and if you're smart, you'll get in line right now.
   At a fraction of the budget, ``Darkman'' is what ``Dick Tracy''
could have been without turning over the movie to the non-talents
of Madonna and ignoring plot and action, or what ``Batman'' should
have been without all the pretense and Joker-mania. It's a simple
story of good vs. evil, seen through the talented lens of Bill
Pope, with sure-fire direction from Sam Raimi (``The Evil Dead'')
and the kind of special effects you only visualize in action comic
books.
   Dr. Peyton Westlake (Liam Neeson) is on the brink of perfecting
synthetic skin _ skin that can take on the features of any
photograph fed into a computer. The only problem is that when
exposed to light, the skin disintegrates after 100 minutes.
Meanwhile, his true love, Julia (Frances McDormand), a lawyer,
discovers a memo linking her client, a real estate tycoon, to the
mob.
   Westlake is visited by a brutal team of hitmen who seek the memo
and silence. Led by the slimey and vicious Robert G. Durant (Larry
Drake), who likes to snip off the fingers of his victims with his
cigar slicer and add to his digit collection at home, the killers
bash Westlake through several glass cabinets, beat him, shoot him,
dunk his head in a vat of acid and leave him a mangled mess after
turning up the gas and lighting a flame to destroy their handiwork.
   The explosion propels Westlake through the window of his lab
like a firey torpedo. The effect is stunning.
   As far as the world is concerned, Westlake is dead. He emerges
at the local hospital as a John Doe, so badly burned that the
doctor clips a vital nerve to alleviate pain. Only problem, the
procedure leaves Westlake with superhuman powers and a rage the
size of Texas.
   He somehow manages to recreate his lab and make enough skin to
get him through several revenge killings and then some.
   Westlake becomes Darkman, a combo Phantom of the Opera-Amazing
Hulk. With the chameleon charms of his synthetic skin, he can look
like anybody.
   The action is nonstop and inspired. And for once, a screenplay
with five names attached isn't an abomination. It's plump with wit
and pathos, and has an eerie override.
   The story is by Raimi, whose claim to fame is ``The Evil Dead,''
a Cannes Film Festival cult classic. However, Raimi shows enormous
talent with his kinetic camera work and angled shots, and he has a
skilled companion with Pope, who makes his feature film debut with
``Darkman.''
   Neeson, who has given solid performances in ``Suspect,'' ``The
Mission'' and ``The Good Mother,'' offers a multi-faceted portrayal
with Westlake. There is compassion, sensuality, intellect, horror.
   There are good support performances from Drake, who plays the
retarded Benny on TV's ``L.A. Law'' and is the sadistic thug in
this movie, and McDormand, the abused sheriff's wife from
``Mississippi Burning.'' Her genuine goodness is never cloying.
   ``Darkman'' is a visionary epiphany of man's inhumanity to man,
the perils of greed, the tests of love and loyality. It is a
fantasy world of horror, creation and destruction. And it's a
full-throttled blast of a ride.
   Produced by Robert Tapert, ``Darkman'' is rated R for graphic
violence.

   ``Pump Up the Volume'' _
   Contrary to common belief _ and some earnest hopes _ the youth
movie is not dead. The once-thriving genre makes a comeback in
``Pump Up the Volume,'' a watchable film of surprising energy.
Adults may well need to steel themselves for another wave of movies
based on the time-worn theme, ``My parents don't understand me.''
   ``Pump Up the Volume'' (and it does) is generally effective,
thanks to a high-wattage performance by Christian Slater. His
performance before a radio microphone matches the electricity of
Eric Begosian in Oliver Stone's neglected ``Talk Radio.''
   Slater is an Easterner whose parents have moved to Arizona,
where the boy is almost paralyzed with shyness at his new high
school. He tries to reach his East Coast buddies via ham radio.
Instead, he happens on a frequency that broadcasts to his fellow
students in Arizona.
   In an amazing and not altogether convincing transformation,
Slater assaults the air waves with demonic fever. He attacks
parents, school authorities, sexual and other inhibitions. For one
frenetic hour he becomes Hard Harry, the foul-mouthed liberator of
enslaved teen-agers, dispenser of heavy-metal rock and outrageous
opinions.
   Grownups in the peaceful suburb pay little heed until Harry
starts exposing a corrupt school administration. The ruthless
principal (Annie Ross) launches a drive to stamp out Harry. Failing
that, she enlists the help of the FCC, which dispatches a small
army to track down Harry's signal. By this time he has inflamed his
fellow students to the riot stage and has been located by a
beautiful classmate, Samantha Mathis, who supports his cause.
   Allan Moyle wrote and directed ``Pump Up the Volume,'' which
exploits the assets of youth films, which is mainly fresh faces and
vibrancy. He also succumbs to the liabilities, especially the
portrayal of adults as simpleminded clods or venal tyrants. A few
improbabilities remain, such as how Slater could hide his rantings
from his parents in the same house.
   Slater, who was Sean Connery's young companion in ``The Name of
the Rose,'' is electrifying as the manic Harry. He is one of the
best young actors around. Mathis as the would-be friend has real
presence, though she seems too mature for high school. Ellen Greene
is effective as a sympathetic teacher.
   The New Line release was produced by Rupert Harvey and Sandy
Stern. The rating is R for raw language. Running time: 100 minutes.
