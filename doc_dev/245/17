   Elvis Presley, with Memphis drawl and swiveling
hips, was one of Hollywood's ``Indian'' actors. So was Rock Hudson.
   Dame Judith Anderson, who astounded audiences as Medea and the
evil housekeeper in ``Rebecca,'' was another famous ``Indian''
actor, cast as Buffalo Cow Head in ``A Man Called Horse.''
   Today, the war paint may be off, but whites continue to play
Indians, a casting practice all too common in an industry in which
Indians comprise only a tiny percentage.
   Hollywood has long ignored accuracy and fairness in its hiring
practices, using white actors to portray blacks, Asians and
Hispanics. As far as Indian roles were concerned, all it took was a
little burnt sienna pancake, cliche costumes and cartoon accents for
white actors to be transformed into the ``red man.''
   The latest motion picture about Indians is ``War Party,'' written
by Spencer Eastman. The movie, to be released this fall by Hemdale
Films, stars Billy Wirth and Kevin Dillon as half-breeds living in
Binger, Mont., the site 100 years ago of the Milk River Battle, in
which Black Cherokees were massacred by U.S. soldiers. Wirth is part
Huron, but Dillon has no Indian blood.
   Wirth is one of the few Indian actors who have managed to get
work over the years. Others include Chief Dan George, who starred in
1971's ``Little Big Man''; Chief John Big Tree, used frequently by
John Ford; and Charles Stevens, the grandson of Geronimo who
appeared in Douglas Fairbanks Westerns.
   Roddam, who depicted British working-class kids in
``Quadrophenia'' and the plight of a black youth at a military
academy in ``Lords of Discipline,'' used a largely Indian cast in
``War Party,'' but insisted that commercial considerations became
more important when considering the leads.
   ``I took all these non-actors in,'' he said. ``I did a film test
and trained them, but in the end the studio didn't feel they had the
experience to be in a $9 million movie. If you want to make this
movie, you're going to have to compromise on the main two guys.''
   In ``War Party,'' Wirth slays a local redneck in self defense and
is forced to flee with Dillon and other Indians. They eventually
band together, vowing not to give in to the authorities.
   ``You can make a small film that no one will see like `Pow Wow
Highway,' or a larger film that a larger number of people will
see,'' Roddam said. ``At the end of the film, you're cheering for
these two Indian boys. You want them to win, you side with them. In
`Lords of Discipline,' you side with the black kid.''
   To cast his movie, Roddam consulted the American Indian Registry
for the Performing Arts, created in 1983 with the intention of
finding work for Indians in the entertainment business.
   Bob Hicks, until recently the organization's executive director,
dismissed the excuses usually given for casting non-Indians.
   ``Our numbers are so small that Hollywood has a tendency not to
take us seriously,'' he said. ``Just the fact that they went and
cast a non-Indian to play the lead because the director needed a
strong person is proof. They'll always tell us that we did look at
Indians but none of them could do the job.''
   David Wacks (``Repo Man'') traveled across the country searching
for actors to star in ``Powwow Highway,'' a critical hit that failed
at the box office earlier this year.
   ``We went to Oklahoma, Albuquerque and Sante Fe and were up in
Montana. We did casting in South Dakota, Minneapolis and Canada.
There are very, very few experienced Indian actors, and virtually
all of them are in the movie,'' he said.
   Wacks cast Gary Farmer, a Mohawk who grew up on a reservation,
and A Martinez, who is part Blackfoot, as the leads in the movie
about two Cheyennes _ Buddy Red Bow and Philbert Bono _ who travel
from their reservation in Montana to New Mexico where Buddy's sister
has been arrested for drug possession.
   ``There's more than enough talent out there _ there's a lot of
talent,'' said Farmer.
   Roddam, however, said that casting Indians to play Indians was
not absolutely necessary.
   ``It comes to the point where you say, `Do you have to have a
real killer play Charles Manson?' I was committed to portraying the
Indians in a correct way. I filmed it in a real Indian town. The
people on the reservation were just thrilled,'' he said.
   ``White liberals get very huffy about the way we portray Indians,
but the people in the town were really thrilled. ... They
appreciated that we were bringing this money into their economy.''
   Through the end of 1988, there were 170 Indians in the
70,000-member Screen Actors Guild. Blacks numbered 5,247 and
Hispanics 2,439.
   ``Certainly the guild's approach with respect to trying to remedy
this situation is the go-slow approach,'' said Rodney Mitchell, the
guild's affirmative-action coordinator. ``We try to engage the
producers in discussions and dialogue, secure their cooperation.
That's the policy.''
   Hollywood's approach has been equally slow. According to the
guild, American Indians were cast in only .3 percent of last year's
film and television roles and .1 percent of TV commercials. Mitchell
said producers don't object to lobbying for minority casting, but
don't necessarily cooperate either.
   ``What we get are comments like, `Well, you know our casting
practices are based upon First Amendment protection. You can't tell
us how to cast a film,''' he said.
   Hicks was pleased that ``Powwow Highway'' depicted Indians
without ``buckskins and feathers,'' but does not expect Hollywood to
continue the reality.
   ``They don't seem to let us get out of those stereotypes,'' he
said. ``We would like to see Indians playing doctors and lawyers and
policeman. These things are not going to change until we do our own
productions.''
