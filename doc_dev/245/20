   Cher quietly arrived in this picturesque
village to begin filming scenes for the movie ``Mermaids.''
   About 150 people gathered Tuesday on Main Street to catch a
glimpse of Cher, who emerged briefly after finishing interior shots
in an office.
   The movie is described in publicity literature as ``a comedic
rendering of a realistic coming-of-age story centering on a
free-spirited mother who hasn't really finished growing up, and her
two individualistic daughters who yearn to settle down.''
   Cher portrays the mother.
   The crowd waited most of the day. Cher appeared dressed in an
aquamarine-with-black-polkadots dress, sporting a bee hive hairdo.

   Basketball star Michael Jordan is used to
accolades, but his own ballet?
   A 20-minute, jazz dance tribute running Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday at a downtown auditorium features a dancer named Amar
portraying the Chicago Bulls guard.
   ``I'll stick out my tongue the way Jordan does, and I'll wear
one of his signature wrist bands,'' Amar said before a private,
benefit performance Tuesday night.
   Amar studied videotape of Jordan on the court.
   ``I'm amazed at the way Michael moves so effortlessly through
space. He moves very much like a dancer,'' Amar said.
   Choreographer Gus Giordano created the dance at the urging of
his son, Patrick, a Jordan fan. Giordano uses five dancers from his
own company.
   The tribute has four parts: ``Yesternow,'' which shows Jordan
today and as a child; the NBA draft; Michael's Court; and 23 Dunk,
a solo.

   Actor Tom Selleck said he didn't pay much
attention to a release he signed before shooting scenes for his new
movie at a maximum security prison.
   ``I don't remember it specifically, but I think it meant if we
die in there, we're not gonna hold the company responsible,''
Selleck said.
   The movie, ``An Innocent Man,'' included scenes filmed at Nevada
State Penitentiary in Carson City. Some inmates were extras on the
film.
   ``We did sign a release. I didn't pay much attention to it,''
Selleck said in a taped, two-part interview to air Thursday and
Friday on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Selleck portrays a fictional airplane mechanic, Jimmie Rainwood,
who is wrongfully accused of cocaine possession and goes to prison
for three years. Rainwood and his wife work to clear his name after
his parole.
   Selleck said he learned a thing or two about prison life.
   ``You don't avoid eye contact with people, but you don't stare
at people because that's assaultive,'' Selleck said. ``If you avoid
eye contact, that's inviting trouble. You look at people, and you
move on.''

   Pop star Madonna's brother has
received a 30-day suspended sentence and two years probation for
assaulting his girlfriend.
   District Judge Michael Batchik also ordered Mario Ciccone to
enter an alcohol-substance abuse treatment program and pay $155 in
fines and court costs for the June 1988 assault.
   Ciccone, 20, of Rochester Hills, will be subject to periodic
drug testing during probation, the judge said during Tuesday's
sentencing.
   Police said Ciccone argued with his then-girlfriend, struck her
and threw her to the ground several times. He pleaded guilty last
summer to assault and was denied a request to be placed in a youth
probation program.

   Mayor Coleman Young said he created a $150,000
trust fund for his only son, whose mother sued for paternity, to
ensure the boy receives a good education.
   Young publicly discussed 6-year-old Joel Loving for the first
time Tuesday, the day after he agreed to pay $225 in weekly child
support and set up the trust fund.
   ``I intend to see to it that any son of mine is well taken care
of, and not only until he reaches the age of 18,'' said the
71-year-old Young.
   Young said he wants to make sure the child is ``given an
opportunity to learn a profession, to learn a trade to enable
himself to look out for himself in later life.''
   Young had no children during two marriages that ended in divorce.
   In a court settlement, Young agreed to provide Joel with $10,000
a year from age 19 through 24 and $90,000 when he turns 25.
   Joel's mother, Annivory Calvert, is a former executive in the
Detroit Department of Public Works. She sued Young in January
before moving to Fontana, Calif., to direct its public works
department.
