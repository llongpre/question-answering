   Early in ``Heat Wave,'' a black teen-ager fresh
in from the segregated Alabama of 1960 stands on a hill overlooking
Los Angeles. His memories: ``It was California. The color-blind
dream.''
   Five years later, the youngster, Bob Richardson, is a Los
Angeles Times messenger, reluctantly made the Times' first black
journalist to report on the city's bloody Watts riots after white
reporters were attacked there.
   Premiering tonight on Ted Turner's TNT cable network, ``Heat
Wave'' is partly based on what scriptwriter Michael Lazlou says was
Richardson's true story, sporadically told from Richardson's point
of view in voice-overs.
   But it's basically a mosaic of life back then in that black
community, one that dramatizes events leading up to the riots and
the deadly nights of rage, looting and burning that erupted there
25 years ago this month.
   It has a number of pluses, including a superb cast. The players
include Blair Underwood as Richardson; James Earl Jones as the
owner of a Watts shoe-repair business, a man who urges patience;
and Cicely Tyson as Richardson's grandmother, who works as a maid
for a Beverly Hills family.
   You've got to give ``Heat Wave'' an A for its effort to portray
the racial discrimination, the lack of all but menial jobs for
blacks, the police harassment of blacks, the anger and frustration
that brews up and explodes on one sweltering summer night.
   It also has a few well-shaded illustrations of the complexity of
the Watts riots, particularly its version of a highway patrolman's
arrest of a black teen-ager for suspected drunken driving, an
arrest that sparked the riot.
   The white patrolman is anything but abusive. The youth's mother
shows up and slaps her son for drinking. But when the patrolman,
almost apologetically says he has to arrest the teen-ager, the kid
gets violent.
   More cops are called, they bust heads, they get hit back, the
riot is on, and in due course fearful whites in distant
neighborhoods arm themselves _including the man for whom Tyson's
character works.
   But the movie is an uneven effort, partly because of Lazlou's
propensity for clunky dialogue, particularly in the crucial
newsroom scenes, which use real names of two staffers, the Times'
then-city editor, Bill Thomas, and reporter Art Berman.
   When white reporters are beaten and chased from Watts by angry
blacks and the paper is faced with the prospect of only police
handouts to rely on, the editor, played by David Strathairn, says,
``Damnit, I need a Negro reporter.''
   Reluctantly agreeing to Richardson's pleas to let him report
from Watts, where Richardson lives, he subsequently gets an
eyewitness account that the rookie purportedly has dictated from
the scene his first time out.
   ``Pretty good, huh?'' asks Berman (Adam Arkin).
   ``Better than good,'' says the editor, who promply emits Cliche
101 used in most TV depictions of newspaper life. ``Run it. As is.''
   It goes on the front page, with Richardson's byline _ and an
editor's note that says Richardson, ``a Negro, is an advertising
messenger for The Times.''
   Although filled with self-doubt when the father of his best
friend calls him an ``Uncle Tom bastard'' and his best friend also
berates him for his report, the wise, knowing businessman Jones
plays urges Richardson to continue.
   ``Look into your heart and tell the truth,'' the older man says.
``Not the white man's truth. Not the black man's truth. There's
only one truth.''
   Noble sentiments. Unfortunately, he is so noble, you may suspect
he is doomed. Likewise a decent young white cop (Harold Pruett) who
befriends Richardson.
   It's a little maddening, this telegraphing of punches, as is
director Kevin Hooks' terrible staging of a scene in which one
epitome of decency is shot down by California National Guardsmen.
   That scene just doesn't ring true, a pity since Hooks' direction
elsewhere is usually effective.
   Summation: ``Heat Wave'' is a good attempt that tries hard. But
given the excellence of the cast, it could and should have been far
better.

   PRIMARIES FORCE NEW NIGHT FOR DOCUDRAMA: CBS says its made-for
TV movie about last year's much-publicized Stuart murder case in
Boston has been rescheduled to Sept. 25. The show's previous Sept.
18 air date, CBS apparently discovered a bit late, would have
conflicted with the Massachusetts gubernational and senatorial
primaries. CBS commissioned the movie less than a week after
Charles Stuart, implicated in the shooting murder of his pregnant
wife, leaped to his death from a Boston bridge. The film's unwieldy
title: ``Good Night, Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston.''
