<P>
For the third time in seven years, a Clint Eastwood-directed movie has made its 
world premiere as an official entry in the Cannes Film Festival. Whether the 
third time proves a charm, Eastwood says he's charmed by the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here twice before and enjoyed it both times," Eastwood said, gazing out 
at a press conference crowd that was spilling out of a beachfront ballroom. "It 
was a wonderful, responsible time, so it was fun to be invited back." 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood has been one of Hollywood's most popular exports for nearly three 
decades and though neither "Pale Rider" nor "Bird" -- his previous Cannes 
entries -- earned him a prize, the films were huge successes with the 
international audiences here. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction to "White Hunter, Black Heart," a film based on the late director 
John Huston's obsession with elephant hunting during the preproduction of "The 
African Queen," seemed much more subdued, even though dozens of journalists 
jostled for position to get the director's autograph after the hourlong press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"White Hunter," which premiered Friday night, will be perceived as one of 
Eastwood's "other movies" -- those that Warner Bros. patiently endures while 
waiting for his next "Dirty Harry." The list of Eastwood indulgences includes 
some of his best -- if least commercial -- films: "Bronco Billy," "Honky Tonk 
Man" and "Bird." 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. is releasing "White Hunter" in France next week, but it won't 
reach U.S. theaters before September. 
</P>
<P>
In "White Hunter" Eastwood takes one of his longest stretches as an actor, 
portraying -- in voice and manner -- the middle-aged John Huston in the midst 
of a dangerous obsession. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is adapted from a 1953 novel written by Peter Viertel, who went to 
Africa with Huston in the late '40s to help complete the script for "The 
African Queen" and witnessed Huston's dissolve into near madness. 
</P>
<P>
Viertel, now 75 and living in Spain with his wife, Deborah Kerr, fictionalized 
the names of Huston, producer Sam Spiegel and himself in the book, and the 
tragic consequences of the director's action portrayed in both the book and the 
film were fabricated. That Huston's obsession with killing an elephant, the bad 
blood it caused between him and Viertel, and the jeopardy in which it placed 
production of what -- despite it all -- became a movie classic were all real. 
</P>
<P>
"John was a gifted filmmaker but he was also a supreme egotist," Viertel says. 
"He would get distracted by some personal whim and he would have his way no 
matter what." 
</P>
<P>
Viertel believes it was the opportunity to hunt big game that tempted Huston to 
take "The African Queen" assignment in the first place, and he treated everyone 
as a traitor who didn't share his passion for the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
The author, who objected to the hunting of any big game, said he wrote the 
novel as an open letter to Huston, whom he believed was squandering his talents 
on his obsessions, and despite reviews that accused the author of back-stabbing 
his mentor, he said Huston liked the book. 
</P>
<P>
"He offered to sign a release before he'd even seen it," Viertel says. "After 
he read the first draft, he suggested a different ending, which I used, then he 
never mentioned the book to me again." 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood said it was Huston's abandonment of responsibility after having taken 
on the responsibility of making a movie that drew his interest in the project. 
And as it happened with "Bird," it was Eastwood's interest that brought a well 
traveled script before the camera. 
</P>
<P>
"White Hunter" was shot last summer in Zimbabwe, with the cooperation of the 
government there. The film has a definite environmental slant, but Eastwood 
said he did not take on the project to make any environmental points. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood said he never met Huston, who died just after the "White Hunter" 
project got under way. And his portrayal of the venerated director may be the 
most discussed element of the film. Asked why he chose to play the fictional 
John Wilson in the distinct manner of the real John Huston, who is as well 
known to some people as an actor as he was as a director, Eastwood said "What's 
the point of doing it if you don't try to stretch yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
"White Hunter" is one of 18 films from 10 countries in competition for the Gold 
Palm. Among its rivals are two other American-financed films -- Alan Parker's 
"Come See the Paradise" and David Lynch's "Wild at Heart." Paul Schrader, who 
was here five years ago with "Mishima," will attend the world premiere of his 
"The Comfort of Strangers," the closing-night film being shown out of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The festival opened Thursday night with "Akira Kurosawa's Dreams," an 
impressionistic anthology of eight vignettes that the 80-year-old Japanese 
director said were adapted from his own remembered dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"Dreams," also a Warner Bros. film, opened in Paris on Friday and will be 
released in the United States sometime this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Other noted filmmakers with pictures in the formal program here are France's 
Bertrand Tavernier and Jean Luc-Godard, Italy's Federico Fellini and Vittorio 
and Paolo Taviani, and Poland's Andrzej Wajda. 
</P>
<P>
The festival runs through May 21.
