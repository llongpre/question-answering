Smoky incense sticks burned over the door. Reggae gospel boomed over speakers 
Monday into the gritty Los Angeles street. The bloody shoot-'em-up film "Marked 
for Death," in which a white hero does battle with a criminal gang of black men 
in dreadlocks, had inspired a protest in Hyde Park, Jamaican-style. 
</P>
<P>
"This film must be stopped," reggae star Ras Michael, an elder in the 
Rastafarian religion, said outside his tiny Hyde Park "assembly house," a sort 
of storefront record shop and church on busy Florence Avenue. "This film is not 
showing the truth of the dread-man and the Jamaican people." 
</P>
<P>
Michael, wearing a red silk African robe, turban and chest-length dreadlocks, 
lashed out at the R-rated 20th Century Fox movie starring Steven Seagal for 
what Michael called an inaccurate portrayal of Rastafarians and Jamaicans as 
killers and drug dealers. The protesters -- about a dozen men and women in 
brightly colored African gowns and dreadlocks -- bore such names as I-Locks, 
Strangejah Cole and Queen Rejoice. They spoke of themselves as Bible followers 
and lovers of peace. 
</P>
<P>
Their long hair, the bearded Michael said, symbolizes holiness. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm telling you . . . when the dreadlock man is killed by the star (during 
the film), they all cheered in the audience," the religious elder said. "That 
ain't right. Rasta is love." 
</P>
<P>
Fox, which released the film Oct. 5 to nearly 1,968 Southern California 
theaters, declined to comment Monday on the protest. However, the studio 
apparently expected some objection to the film, written by Michael Grais and 
Mark Victor and directed by Dwight H. Little. 
</P>
<P>
The credits end with a disclaimer saying that the criminal element portrayed 
"is estimated to be a fraction of 1% of the Jamaican population and should not 
detract from their country or the contributions Jamaicans have made to this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
The film does not refer to the gang members as Rastafarians. Neither that nor 
the disclaimer was enough to satisfy protesters who said the depiction of gang 
members in dreadlocks selling cocaine to Chicago high school students was 
implication enough. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the storefront, where a candlelight altar is used for chanting and 
prayer, reggae performer Queen Rejoice, 44, read part of a protest poem she 
co-wrote. The film, she intoned, "Tarnishes the reputation / And needs 
confrontation / To stop the exploitation. . . . These are the people of greed / 
Who will do anything to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
I-Locks, a 25-year-old keyboard player in Michael's reggae gospel band, saw the 
film Sunday and likened it to "a 1940s Superman movie." In "Marked for Death," 
the hero uses guns, knives and fists to overcome the dreadlock-wearing gang 
members. The gang, controlled by an unsmiling character named Screwface, was 
involved in cocaine, murder and voodoo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"To me it looked like a direct propaganda film against the Rastafarian 
community," I-Locks said, in reference to the several thousand members in Los 
Angeles. "I don't like it. I don't like it at all."
