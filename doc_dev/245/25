   A group of local Christian leaders
appealed to Universal Studios Tuesday to destroy the film ``The
Last Temptation of Christ,'' saying it portrays Jesus as a
``mentally deranged and lust-driven man.''
   ``It is the most serious misuse of film craft in the history of
filmmaking,'' the Rev. Lloyd John Ogilvie, senior pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, said at a news conference
attended by four other prominent area Christians.
   Members of the group acknowledged they have not seen the movie,
but said they believed the film contains a dream sequence in which
Christ comes off his cross and has sex with Mary Magdalene.
   Universal reaffirmed it would release the film this fall. It
said the Christians were advocating censorship and were criticizing
a film after declining an invitation to see it.
   ``Consequently, much of what they are saying is inaccurate and
exaggerated,'' said a statement released by co-distributors
Universal Pictures and Cineplex Odeon Films.
   The studio has billed ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' as a
look at the human side of Jesus. The movie is directed by Martin
Scorsese, who once studied for the priesthood, and stars Willem
Dafoe as Jesus, Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene and Harvey Keitel
as Judas Iscariot.
   Scheduled for release to a few theaters on Sept. 23, the movie
is based on Greek author Nikos Kazantzakis' 1955 book ``The Last
Temptation of Christ,'' which was condemned as heretical by the
Greek Orthodox Church.
   Universal held a private screening of the movie in New York
Tuesday.
   The Rev. Dave Pomeroy, director of media resources for the
National Council of Churches attended the screening. He said, ``It
was a fascinating film. It will certainly continue to engender the
kind of controversy it's already doing.''
   The movie, like Kazantzakis' book, shows Jesus tempted not to
die on the cross, Pomeroy said.
   ``The point that is being missed by the critics is that he
rejects that temptation to live out his life span and die as a
man,'' he said. ``What needs to be noted is this is a movie of a
novel not a movie of the gospel story.''
   ``I haven't actually had a good night's sleep in several weeks.
I wake up in the middle of the night and wonder, `How could someone
do this to the most wonderful person who walked the face of the
Earth?''' Dr. Bill Bright, founder and president of San
Bernardino-based Campus Crusade for Christ, said at the news
conference.
   The group asked Universal to cancel the release of the film and
destroy all copies of it, and urged Christians and non-Christians
alike to write or call MCA Inc., Universal's parent company.
   They said they were basing their protest on two versions of the
script they had seen and reports by an unidentified person inside
Universal Pictures who had seen the film.
   ``The content of both the script and the film portrayed Jesus
Christ as a mentally deranged and lust-driven man ... who in a
dream sequence, comes down off the cross and has a sexual
relationship with Mary Magdalene,'' said Larry Poland, president of
Mastermedia International Inc., a Highland, Calif., Christian
consulting firm.
   The Rev. Jack Hayford, pastor of the Church On The Way in Van
Nuys, joined Ogilvie in denying their appeal amounted to
censorship. He said Universal was altering factual biblical history
in the film.
   Universal Pictures had hired a born-again Christian marketing
consultant, Tim Penland, who advised on the films ``Chariots of
Fire'' and ``The Mission,'' to help ward off controversy.
   Penland resigned in June. He said Tuesday he couldn't finish
reading the script, which he called biblically inaccurate.
   The group said Universal had promised to show a rough cut of the
movie in June but canceled it. The group members said they declined
to attend Tuesday's screening because it was too close to the
release date to force any changes in the movie.
   Universal said in its statement Tuesday that Scorsese ``deeply
believes that this film is a religious affirmation of faith.''
   Marion Billings, a publicist for the director of ``Taxi Driver''
and ``Raging Bull,'' did not return phone calls Tuesday.
   On Monday, the group placed a full-page advertisement in the
Hollywood Reporter, an entertainment newspaper, urging Universal
not to release the film. The ad was signed by 61 Christians in the
entertainment industry.
   Also Monday, Poland called for a Christian boycott of any
product connected with Universal or MCA, an entertainment
conglomerate that includes movie and television production,
amusement tours of its studios as well as MCA Records and book and
licensing divisions.
