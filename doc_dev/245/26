   Some disliked their roles, others were too young
to remember theirs, but 10 surviving cast members of ``Gone With
the Wind'' are excited about the hoopla surrounding the classic's
50th anniversary celebration.
   ``Thank God I had a part in it,'' said Ric Holt, who played Beau
Wilkes, son of Melanie and Ashley Wilkes.
   The Civil War saga's lone surviving star, Olivia De Havilland,
who played Melanie, was at Wednesday's reunion in spirit.
   De Havilland, who lives in Paris, sent her ``warmest
salutations'' to the reunion in a letter read by a tearful Rand
Brooks, who played Charles Hamilton.
   She signed the letter Melanie Hamilton Wilkes and asked Brooks
to remember her to the cast, especially ``the several Beau
Wilkeses, and my fond eternal greetings to the sole representative
of the Hamilton clan.''
   ``Anyone who had read the book sensed they were into something
that would belong to the ages, and everyone was in a frenzy to read
the book,'' said Ann Rutherford, who won the role of Scarlett
O'Hara's youngest sister, Carreen, because Judy Garland was filming
``The Wizard of Oz.''
   ``The specialness of this is with each generation of young
people who are touched by `Gone With the Wind,''' she said. ``As
long as there are little children, there will always be a Mickey
Mouse. ... On an adult version, `Gone With the Wind' does that.''
   The cast members were in town for the weeklong anniversary fete
of the movie's Dec. 15, 1939, world premiere in Atlanta. The
movie's ``re-premiere'' is scheduled for Friday.
   At the reunion were Butterfly McQueen, who portrayed the slave
Prissy; Patrick Curtis and Mickey Kuhn, who played Beau Wilkes at
various ages; Gregg Geiss, who played Bonnie Blue Butler,
Scarlett's and Rhett's daughter, as an infant; Evelyn Keyes, who
played Suellen O'Hara; Cammie King Conlon, who portrayed Bonnie
Blue as a child, and Fred Crane who as Brent Tarleton spoke the
movie's opening lines.
   McQueen, whose portrayal of the flighty maid who didn't ``know
nothing 'bout birthing babies'' won her acclaim, said she sometimes
hated her role because she thought it demeaning to blacks.
   ``To me it was just a job, but at times I hated the role,'' she
said.
   Ms. McQueen was typecast as a domestic in such films as ``Since
You Went Away'' and ``Mildred Pierce,'' but finally refused such
roles, saying they were an embarrassment.
   Brooks also said he despised his part as Scarlett's
mild-mannered husband.
   ``It was an asinine part,'' he said. ``I wanted to be more
macho.''
   Geiss, who won the part of the baby Bonnie Blue despite being a
boy because of his blue eyes, said he was 10 days old during the
filming, but still knew at an early age how significant the movie
was.
   Ms. Keyes, now an author and scriptwriter, said it is ironic
that although she has appeared in more than 40 films including
``The Jolson Story,'' she is ``unable to get away from `Gone With
the Wind.'''
   ``I wrote my second book about me, and my publisher wanted to
name it `Scarlett O'Hara's Younger Sister.' I said, `But it's not
about `Gone With the Wind,' and he said that's all I'm known for,''
she said, laughing.
   Ms. Rutherford concurred that no matter what else the cast has
done, ``Our obituary will say we were in `Gone With the Wind' and
we'll be proud of it.''
   Though long dead, ``Gone With the Wind'' stars Clark Gable and
Vivien Leigh (Rhett and Scarlett), producer David O. Selznick and
author Margaret Mitchell were remembered fondly by cast members.
   Ms. Conlon, calling Gable ``kind of a daddy,'' remembered that
Gable's ``mustache scratched when he kissed me. My mother's friends
swooned when they heard that!''
   Ms. Rutherford recalled that the night of the premiere, Ms.
Mitchell invited the cast to her Atlanta home for scrambled eggs.
Gable and Ms. Mitchell disappeared.
   ``Clark Gable and Margaret were hiding in the bathroom, Clark on
the edge of the tub and Margaret you know where, just talking,''
she chuckled. ``They had to get away from the photographers.''
