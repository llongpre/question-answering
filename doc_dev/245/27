<LEADPARA>  ZEBA Bakhtiar, the Pakistani star of the hit summer film "Henna," received her
first set of reviews even before filming began. They were death threats.;   "I
got some letters and phone calls, people saying they would kill me if I made
the movie," the 24-year-old actress said. "They said Muslim girls should not
be appearing in films with Hindu actors. Lots of people warned me not to
appear in the film."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HINDU ROMEO AND MUSLIM JULIET FILL THEATERS IN
INDIA, PAKISTAN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Released a few weeks ago and in most ways typical of the syrupy romance
films that fill the movie houses of Pakistan and India, "Henna" is already
being described as a landmark in the history of motion pictures on the
subcontinent.;   It is as much a joint production on a major motion picture as
the Indian and Pakistani film industries have ever seen, a Romeo-and-Juliet
story with Romeo played by -- and portrayed as -- an Indian Hindu and Juliet a
Pakistani Muslim by the name of Henna. It is also an enormous success on both
sides of the border.;   The movie was conceived by one of India's legendary
film makers, the late Raj Kapoor, and directed by his son Randhir. Much of the
dialogue was written by a respected Pakistani screenwriter, Haseena Moin.;  
"Henna" is being promoted with the slogan: "God made land. Man made borders."
And the border portrayed in the film could not be more troublesome.;   The
setting of "Henna" is Kashmir, the divided northern territory that has been
the focus of two of the three wars fought between India and Pakistan since
their partition by Britain in 1947.;   The Indian-Pakistani relationship is
considered so incendiary in the motion picture industry that only a handful of
films that touch on it has been made in either country.;   Moin, who traveled
to India from her home in Karachi to work on "Henna," had her name removed
from the credits before the film went into distribution, in part because of
concern that "Henna" might be perceived as somehow pro-India.;   "In the film,
a wealthy Indian businessman is struck by the subject of India and Pakistan,"
said Jameel Akhtar Khan, professor of language and literature at Karachi
University. "There are strong feelings on both sides. Film makers have not
taken these risks.";   The fear among film makers, as well as theatrical and
television producers, is largely a result of politics.;   Censor boards in
both India and Pakistan monitor the political content of films and television
programs. Earlier this year, censors in Karachi banned a well-reviewed play
about the partition.;   There is the related concern about public taste and
commercial appeal. Satish Anand, a Karachi film maker who is managing director
of Eveready Pictures, said his competitors in Pakistan were just as concerned
with the bottom line as their counterparts in Hollywood.;   "I think people in
the industry have thought in the past that the relationship between Pakistan
and India was a risky subject, commercially risky," he said. The financial
success of "Henna," he said, may help change some of that thinking.  </TEXT>
