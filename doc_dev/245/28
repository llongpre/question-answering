   Long lines of curious filmgoers turned out to see ``The Last
Temptation of Christ'' in nine cities, greatly outnumbering the
protesters who denounced as sacrilegious the film that debuted in
guarded theaters.
   Many movie patrons left sold-out theaters Friday wondering what
all the fuss was about, while others said protesters were trying to
suppress free speech and religious toleration.
   ``It's just a movie, and you can't really condone it or say
anything about it until you've seen it,'' said James Aguiar, 23,
one of hundreds of patrons who lined up around the block at New
York's Ziegfeld Theater.
   About 500 would-be viewers were turned away from the 1,000-seat
theater showing the movie in San Francisco.
   The film was released six weeks early by Universal as the uproar
mounted over its depiction of a Jesus Christ filled with self-doubt
and tempted to abandon his call as a savior to live as a mortal. In
the film, Christ resists this ``last temptation.''
   Protesters have damned the film as sacrilege, saying it portrays
Christ as a deranged and lust-driven human, who, while being
crucified, dreams he marries and has sex with Mary Magdalene and
lives his life as an ordinary man.
   Some leaders from evangelical Protestant, Roman Catholic, Mormon
and Orthodox Jewish groups called the film blasphemous, sparking a
demonstration Thursday by 25,000 opponents of the film in Los
Angeles.
   Cardinal Bernard Law, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Boston,
urged Catholics to boycott the film, calling it ``morally offensive
and repugnant to Christian belief.''
   But Tom Burger, communications director for the United Methodist
Church's West Virginia conference, called it ``a theological
issue.''
   ``If Christ was to know what it was like to be human, I would
like to think that he would be tempted with human temptations.''
And, Burger added, ``My faith is not threatened by a movie.''
   Although the protests were peaceful, uniformed security guards
Friday checked purses and bags of movie patrons in Washington, New
York, Los Angeles and Toronto, and guards also stood alongside the
screen in New York and Los Angeles, but no major disturbances were
reported. There was minor vandalism at the Los Angeles theater and
an arrest for disorderly conduct in New York.
   In Los Angeles, Universal President Tom Pollock said he was
gratified by the audience response.
   ``I didn't know what to expect until we had an audience that was
not clergy or press,'' Pollock said. ``They applauded and I applaud
them.''
   The Toronto audience included priests and divinity students.
Canon Garth Bulmer of the Anglican Church agreed with other more
liberal Christians, such as the Episcopal bishop of New York, that
the film is provocative but not blasphemous.
   ``I enjoyed it even though much was far-fetched. It does make
you think a lot about Jesus,' he said.
   In Chicago, the Rev. Nikitas Lulias, chancellor of the
200,000-member Chicago-area Greek Orthodox Diocese, was among about
50 protesters at the Biograph Theater.
   ``We have called on our people to go with prayer in the hearts _
that God might anoint these individuals to stop showing the film,''
said Lulias.
   But 24-year-old James Schatz of Chicago said as he entered the
sold-out showing that he was puzzled by objections to the film,
based on the 1955 novel of the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis.
   ``It's based on a fictional book. It's a work of fiction. I
don't think Martin Scorsese meant to offend anyone.''
   Scorsese, raised as a Roman Catholic, says the film he directed
is an affirmation of faith to provoke people to think about Jesus
as a man confronting temptation.
   A dozen fellow directors, including Warren Beatty, Peter
Bogdanovich, Penny Marshall, James Brooks and Walter Hill,
expressed support at a news conference Friday in Los Angeles.
   ``We owe a debt of gratitude to this group of somewhat misguided
zealots. The film now will be seen by a lot of curiosity-seekers,''
said John Badham, director of ``Short Circuit'' and ``WarGames.''
``What is not terrific is their effort to rewrite the Bill of
Rights.''
   The movie also opened in Seattle, Minneapolis and Montreal. A
Universal spokesman said no decision has been made whether to add
other cities next week.
