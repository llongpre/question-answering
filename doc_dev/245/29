   The movie ``Cry Freedom''
opened in more than 30 South African theaters Friday with the
censor's approval, but police said it threatened public safety and
seized the copies seven hours later.
   They cited two bombs, anonymous phone threats and violent scenes
in the movie as evidence that it was dangerous.
   Movie-goers at the Northcliff Theater in a rich white
Johannesburg suburb arrived to find posters being taken down and
police ready to confiscate the film. ``Cry Freedom'' was replaced
by ``I Was A Teen-Age Vampire.''
   Richard Attenborough, who directed the movie, said in London:
``I never believed they would show it. ... The overall reason for
making the film was to tell people the truth about apartheid, and
about how it struck both black and white South Africans.''
   Nomphelo Ndabula, 19, emerged from a theater in tears. ``I was
nearly heartbroken,'' she said. ``The people, especially whites,
must see the film. They will see that the black man must have
rights. They will see that blacks are people.''
   In Los Angeles, Tom Pollock, chairman of the MCA Motion Picture
Group, said of the police action: ``We at Universal Pictures
condemn the actions of the government of South Africa. However, we
applaud the courage of UIP, the film's overseas distributor, and
local theater owners throughout South Africa who agreed to play the
film despite the controversy and pressure.''
   Glenn Gumpel, executive director of the Directors Guild of
America, issued a statement saying, ``We abhor any censorship,
wherever found in the world, and are appalled by the actions of the
South African government.'' Attenborough is a guild member.
   The Publication Appeals Board ruled Friday morning, for the
second time, that the film could be shown. It said the movie, which
depicts the death in detention in 1977 of young black consciousness
leader Steve Biko, was biased against police but did not endanger
race relations or state security.
   Gen. Hendrik de Witt, the police commissioner, declared in a
statement Friday evening that the film ``endangers the safety of
the public, the maintenance of public order, and will delay the
termination of the state of emergency'' imposed on June 12, 1986.
   Minister of Information Stoffel van der Merwe said the
government decided to override the board because the censors could
not judge ``the situation on the streets.''
   ``The security forces are portrayed in such a negative light
that their public image would be seriously undermined,'' he said.
``Whites are typified as privileged and surrounded by wealth, as
opposed to blacks living in great poverty and subjected to
exploitation and repression.''
   Van der Merwe said those portrayals were not accurate.
   South Africa's apartheid system establishes a society in which
the 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The 5
million whites control the economy and maintain separate
residential districtes, schools, health services and recreation
areas.
   The movie, directed by Attenborough in neighboring Zimbabwe, is
based on two books by Donald Woods, a white newspaper editor who
befriended Biko and fled the country after Biko's death.
   Woods is banned in South Africa and it is illegal to quote him,
as actor Kevin Kline does in portraying him, but De Witt did not
mention that point in ordering the copies confiscated under
emergency regulations.
   Explosions, but no injuries, were reported at two theaters
showing ``Cry Freedom.'' The blast at the Metro theater in downtown
Durban occurred soon after police evacuated a multiracial crowd of
300 and the other was at Kings Cinema in Alexandra, a black
township outside Johannesburg.
   Theaters in Port Elizabeth, Pretoria, Durban and in Soweto, the
largest black township near Johannesburg, reported receiving
anonymous bomb threats.
   The censorship board approved the film without restrictions in
November. It was to open in April but distributors withdrew it,
asking for assurances no one would be prosecuted for showing the
film. The government made no promises.
   Stoffel Botha, home affairs minister, ordered the board this
week to review its decision. The censors held a hearing Thursday
and announced Friday morning the movie could be shown with an age
restriction of 19.
   Showings began half an hour later.
   Van der Merwe told a news conference the movie was intended as
an anti-South Africa propaganda instrument, and ``We don't need
that sort of internal disturbance and excitement from people like
Richard Attenborough.''
   Police reported threats and violence at one theater but did not
name it. There were no reports of such disturbances from
journalists who joined audiences around the country.
   ``I don't think people will go out and riot because it's about
events we all know about,'' said a black youth at the Kine Theater
in Johannesburg. He would not give his name.
   The audience of 200, most of them black teen-agers, jumped
forward in their seats and hissed during the scene at the end in
which white policemen open fire on marching Soweto schoolchildren
in 1976.
   Sobs also could be heard. People sat with hands in front of
their mouths. The hissing grew when the camera showed patches of
blood on the children's crisp, white school shirts.
   Several blacks sang softly along with the soundtrack of ``God
Bless Africa,'' which many blacks consider to be their national
anthem.
   It ends with the shout, ``Amandla!'' the Zulu word for power.
Many viewers joined the shout, then the audience filed out without
waiting for the credits.
