   Dustin Hoffman collected Hollywood's highest
honor for his portrayal of an autistic savant in ``Rain Man,'' but
his thoughts were with his 81-year-old father, Harry, who recently
suffered a stroke.
   ``My father so wanted to be here tonight,'' Hoffman said
Wednesday night after receiving the best actor Oscar. ``Ironically,
a few weeks ago, he joined the family of the disabled. ...''
   Hoffman added backstage: ``My father's doing fine, they are
optimistic.''
   A six-time nominee for best actor, Hoffman had last won an
Academy Award in 1979 for his role in ``Kramer vs. Kramer.''
   For his role as Raymond Babbitt in ``Rain Man,'' Hoffman visited
autistic savants, their families and medical experts, enabling him
to create the paradox of an autistic man who displays flashes of
mathematical genius.
   ``I just want to thank all the people I talked to that were
autistic and their families, and the doctors and all their help,''
Hoffman said.

   Best actress Jodie Foster, who won the Oscar
for her portrayal of a waitress gang raped in a tavern in ``The
Accused,'' said the movie shows that cruelty may be human and
cultural but is unacceptable.
   ``I'm very proud of the movie,'' she said backstage at the
Academy Awards. ``The movie is true and it's honest. It takes the
truth and it smacks it in your face.''
   Miss Foster, 26, noted that she is in her 24th year in the film
industry. She was previously nominated for an Oscar, in the
supporting actress category, at age 13 for her role as a prostitute
in ``Taxi Driver.''

   Kevin Kline won the supporting actor Oscar
for his role as the amoral, insulting, cruel and arrogant American
always driving a big car on the wrong side of British roads in ``A
Fish Called Wanda.''
   So he might have watched his words when he received his
statuette Wednesday night from two James Bonds and a man who would
be king.
   Not so.
   ``There's a lot of Brits here tonight _ scary,'' Kline quipped
after the presentation by Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Michael
Caine.
   Kline did lavish gratitude on another Englishman: screenwriter
and co-star John Cleese.
   ``He said, `I want to write a movie where you get run over by a
steam roller and eat a lot of Michael Palin's tropical fish.' I
said, `Great, sounds good, I'm in, let's do it.' And then he
actually wrote it,'' Kline said.

   Geena Davis, named best supporting actress
for her role as the quirky dog trainer Muriel in ``The Accidental
Tourist,'' seemed flustered at being the leadoff winner at the 61st
Academy Awards.
   ``I sort of can't believe I have to go first,'' Miss Davis told
the Shrine Auditorium audience as she accepted the Oscar from
presenters Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson.
   Regaining her composure, she began, ``I'm very thrilled ...''
and offered thanks to author Anne Tyler, co-star William Hurt,
acting coaches ``and my other wonderful acting coach and darling
husband, Jeff Goldblum.''
