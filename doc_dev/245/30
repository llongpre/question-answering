   In true Hollywood style, a quiet film about
the disconnected soul of an autistic ``Rain Man'' won Oscars for
best picture, best original screenplay, best director Barry
Levinson and best actor Dustin Hoffman.
   ``It is for us a Cinderella story. The picture was literally
canceled three or four times,'' Hoffman said backstage at Wednesday
night's 61st Academy Awards.
   It also had a much-rewritten screenplay and went through four
directors over two years.
   Jodie Foster, a former child star, won the best actress award
and her first Oscar for her emotional portrayal of the angry,
traumatized victim of a gang rape in ``The Accused.''
   ``Cruelty might be human and it might be cultural, but it's not
acceptable, and that's what this movie is about,'' said Miss
Foster, 26, who was nominated for the award in 1976 at age 13 for
playing a child prostitute in ``Taxi Driver.
   Her dark-horse victory was over the more favored actresses Glenn
Close, in ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' and Melanie Griffith's ``Working
Girl.'' Sigourney Weaver, nominated for best actress and best
supporting actress, won neither.
   ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' a saga of sexual gamesmanship and deceit
among the wealthy in pre-Revolutionary France, won three Oscars _
for art direction, costumes and adapted screenplay, given to writer
Christopher Hampton.
   ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' the inventive comic blend of
animation and live action, won three technical Oscars _ visual
effects, film editing and sound effects editing _ and a special
award for its chief animator, Richard Williams.
   Geena Davis, who played a bubbly, eccentric dog trainer in ``The
Accidental Tourist,'' and Kevin Kline, the pseudo-intellectual,
goldfish-devouring jewel thief in ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' won in
supporting roles.
   Denmark won best foreign language film for the second straight
year with writer-director Bille August's ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' a
grim picture of farm life in Denmark early in the century. The 1988
winner was ``Babette's Feast.''
   Best song was Carly Simon's ``Let the River Run'' from ``Working
Girl.'' The movie, Miss Simon said, ``inspired me to write a hymn
to the morning. New York is a jungle, but I still wrote a hymn.''
   The academy could find only three songs to nominate this year,
instead of the usual five, and didn't see fit to have them
performed during the show.
   Instead, producer Allan Carr said the show's opening number
would be the most exciting 15 minutes in television history.
Instead, the man who put ``La Cage aux Folles'' on Broadway gave
the world a Snow White lookalike trilling ``Proud Mary'' to
Hollywood brat packer Rob Lowe.
   The night belonged to the ``Rain Man'' himself.
   ``I'm supposed to be jaded at this point; I'm very honored,''
Hoffman, 51, said in a halting, emotional voice after a rare
standing ovation from the Shrine Auditorium audience. He won the
award in 1979 for ``Kramer vs. Kramer.''
   Backstage, he acknowledged the difficulty of creating Raymond
Babbit, a ``high-functional'' autistic who can perform genius-level
feats of calculation and visualization, but is unable to connect
with other human beings, including a scheming younger brother who
covets Raymond's $3 million legacy.
   ``I'm hanging on by a fingernail,'' he once told Levinson.
   Levinson, in accepting the director's award, said the movie's
success was ``really about two actors _ Dustin Hoffman and Tom
Cruise. If they didn't deliver the performances they gave, I
wouldn't be up here this evening.''
   ``Rain Man'' entered the awards ceremony with eight nominations,
more than any other title, and has grossed $134.6 million at the
box office.
   ``Rain Man'' lost the original score award to ``The Milagro
Beanfield War'' (Dave Grusin) and art direction to ``Dangerous
Liaisons.''
   Miss Davis was the first to receive an award with the line ``And
the Oscar goes to ...'' The Academy, dropping the traditional ``And
the winner is ...'' intended to soften the sense of competition,
but several presenters, including Cher for best picture, reverted
to ``The winner is...''
   ``First of all, I want to thank Anne Tyler for writing such a
wonderful book,'' said Miss Davis after receiving her award. She
has remarked that she had read Miss Tyler's novel when it was first
published and coveted the role of Muriel, later realizing her dream.
   ``It's great getting an Oscar for a comedy. It doesn't usually
happen,'' Kline said backstage.
