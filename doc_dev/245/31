   Billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump
says he can't understand what cartoonist Garry Trudeau is getting at
when he depicts Trump in comic strips.
   ``You know, I did well in school, but for the life of me, I still
can't understand what `Doonesbury' is all about,'' Trump said.
   A recent ``Doonesbury'' shows Trump tossing casino chips from the
deck of the Trump Princess, his luxury yacht, to people on small
boats below.
   ``They say Trudeau is somewhat clever,'' Trump said in an
interview this week. ``But I'd venture to say that most people are
like me. They don't comprehend what Trudeau's trying to achieve with
`Doonesbury,' either.''
   Trump had kinder words for Trudeau's wife, NBC-TV ``Today'' show
co-anchor Jane Pauley. ``Personally, I think his wife has a lot more
talent than he does,'' Trump said. ``She's interviewed me on the
`Today' show a couple of times and she was very nice,'' Trump said.

   First lady-to-be Barbara Bush drew kind
comments from Mr. Blackwell, but Marilyn Quayle, wife of the vice
president-elect, made his Worst-Dressed Women of 1988 list.
   ``Barbara Bush is going to bring back vanilla ice cream and apple
pie. It is going to be pure mid-America,'' Blackwell said Wednesday
as he unveiled his 29th annual Worst-Dressed list.
   Britain's Duchess of York and former Philippines first lady
Imelda Marcos topped the list by Blackwell, a designer and
self-appointed fashion arbiter whose real name is Richard Sylvan
Selzer.
   Third place went to actress Debra Winger, followed by pop
star-actress Madonna; Mrs. Quayle, and Shirley Temple Black. Three
celebrity offspring tied for seventh place: Lisa Marie Presley,
Carrie Hamilton and Katie Wagner. Jamie Lee Curtis was next,
followed by Jodie Foster and funny lady Roseanne Barr.

   Actor Tom Selleck says he's drawing big bucks for
his movie roles but that he'd play some parts without the pay.
   ``I'd do a walk-on in a Woody Allen movie,'' said the star of the
former ``Magnum, P.I.'' detective series. ``But you don't want to
call up a person and seem to be pandering by saying, `Please let me
into one of your movies.'''
   ``People say, `We could never get Tom for this nice little movie,
because he's too expensive,''' Selleck said in an interview in
February's McCall's magazine.
   ``Some movies, if they can't afford your price, you do them for
love,'' said Selleck, 43, whose new movie, the romantic comedy ``Her
Alibi,'' opens next month.

   Brent Aden, a 12-year-old autistic boy, was
so elated after seeing the movie ``Rain Man'' that he wrote a letter
to actor Dustin Hoffman, saying the film changed his view of himself
and of autism.
   Hoffman, who portrays an autistic savant in the movie, returned
the favor and called the Fresno boy Monday, talking with Brent and
his family for 20 minutes.
   Autism affects brain chemistry and disrupts communication.
   Until Brent saw the film, he hated his autism and refused to even
say the word, according to his mother, Cathy Aden.
   Mrs. Aden said her son ``laughed in all the right places'' and
``blossomed'' after seeing the film.
   Brent's letter to Hoffman said in part: ``I feel good now. People
say autism is OK. I'm free now. This is good, Rain Man.''

   Actor Dennis Quaid will do a bit of singing
in a movie as he portrays rock 'n' roller Jerry Lee Lewis, but Lewis
will perform most of his music, the producer says.
   Adam Fields' film crews wrapped up work in Memphis on Wednesday
and prepared to leave for London, the other main locale of the movie
``Great Balls of Fire,'' which is based on Lewis' early recording
career. The movie is to be released in July.
   Lewis was forced to leave England during a tour when he was 23
because of a public outcry over his then-recent marriage to his
13-year-old cousin, Myra. They were divorced in 1971. Lewis has been
married six times.

   The feisty L'Esperance quintuplets
arrived by limousine to celebrate their first birthday at William
Beaumont Hospital.
   The quints, born a year ago Wednesday, are up and about these
days, amusing each other, banging on each other and occasionally
even nipping at their mom, Michele L'Esperance. ``They play
together, kill each other,'' she said.
   ``Walking into a room in the morning when they all light up and
they're all standing in their cribs waiting for you'' is the best
part of raising the brood, she said. ``Nobody feels love until you
walk into a room and they all yell, `Mama.' It makes you feel like
you've won a popularity contest.''

   Princess Margaret, sister of Queen Elizabeth II,
turned out to the Royal Opera House for a concert featuring Soviet
ballet dancers and American singers to aid earthquake victims in

   Wednesday's opera was intended to raise money from ticket sales,
telephone donations from television viewers and sales of a video to
14 countries, said spokesman Ewen Balfour.
   Dancers of Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow and Leningrad's
Kirov Ballet, together with opera singers from the Armenian capital
of Yerevan, joined U.S. sopranos June Anderson and Carol Vaness and
British dancers and singers.

   Mayor Tom Bradley is out and Police Chief
Daryl F. Gates is in for a part in a special 100th episode of NBC's
crime drama ``Hunter.''
   Bradley announced his candidacy for a fifth term as mayor on
Wednesday, meaning an appearance on ``Hunter'' would necessitate
equal time for other candidates. His honor, who was to play himself,
was subsequently scrubbed.
   Gates has now taken over as the sole city official on the show.
   The three-part script entitled ``City Under Siege'' airs Feb. 4,
11 and 18.
