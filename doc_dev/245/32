<LEADPARA>  FOR years, beautiful Marla Hanson was told her face would make her famous
someday. And that's exactly what happened -- only not the way she had
imagined.;    As it turned out, it wasn't her striking beauty that made the
aspiring young model a "cover girl," but rather the tragic mutilation of that
beauty by a pair of razor-wielding street thugs.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Now, after several years of hard-won "fame" on TV talk shows and the front
pages of tabloids, Hanson's tragedy has been turned into a TV
movie-of-the-week: "The Marla Hanson Story," which premieres tonight at 9 on
NBC (Chs. 3, 4, 8).;    This is a movie I'm not sure anybody needed, except
perhaps Hanson, whose modeling career ended as soon as prospective clients saw
the scars she now bears. If she was lucky, she made a few bucks on the movie
deal.;    Otherwise, it's a docudrama without much point or, worse, a
"thriller" that exploits the pain and suffering of this poor young woman.;   
The film has no moral, unless it's that good-looking women should stay indoors
behind multiple security locks if they live in New York City. I'm guessing
most of them know that already.;    Nor is the film an indictment of the law's
inability to protect people from psychotic "stalkers." Though Hanson was
disfigured by hoods acting on behalf of a frustrated suitor who had "stalked"
her for several months, she never took him seriously enough to call the law.; 
  Sure, the movie finally has Hanson tell us she's learned a lesson from her
ordeal: that beauty isn't everything.;    Unfortunately, Hanson's beauty is
everything in this movie. Would there even have been a movie if she'd been a
homely waitress slashed by thugs?;    So if the point is just to scare us all
with the story of Hanson's tragedy, that's not enough. In fact, I'm inclined
to think it compounds Hanson's tragedy to have her turned into some form of
tabloid specimen, preserved in printers' ink and videotape, for future
generations to shudder over.;    Yet, if it's shudders you're after, "The
Marla Hanson Story" has them in bulk. When Hanson is held by one thug while
the other slowly slits both sides of her face, you'll shudder right off your
chair onto the living room floor.;    Rather than take the time to first let
us get to know Hanson as a person, the movie starts, instead, with a sharp
"hook" intended to drag us head first into her tragedy: A young woman staggers
into a New York tavern, blood pouring from the hands she's holding to her
mutilated face.;    Moments later, in the emergency room, a nurse observes,
"Somebody said she's a model.";    "Not anymore," says the surgeon.;    Then,
in the flashback that makes up most of the movie, we join Hanson (Cheryl
Pollak) a year earlier, struggling without success to become a model in a
business that considers her too old at 24 and too short to display clothes
properly on a fashion runway.;    In quick succession, she meets three men who
will become very important in her life: Eric (Dale Midkiff), the top fashion
photographer who "discovers" her and sends her to Joe (Jack Blessing), the
agent who starts her up the ladder of success, and Steve Roth (Kirk Baltz),
the makeup man who tells her -- prophetically as it turns out -- "Your face
was made for me.";    When Hanson learns there's an opening for a roommate in
an apartment shared by two other models, she moves in, even though she doesn't
quite care for creepy Roth, who owns the building. Her suspicions take on
substance when he begins following her everywhere and turning up in her
apartment unannounced, professing his manifest need for her affection.;   
"Welcome to show business," says Eric, when Hanson complains about the creepy
Roth. "You can count on the fingers of one hand the people who don't give you
the creeps.";    The movie makes sure we know what a creep Roth is. He lies
about being instrumental in her getting a big modeling job. He concedes he's
in love with her mainly because she's beautiful. He asks her to have sex with
him "just this one night," and maybe he won't bother her anymore. None of this
puts Hanson in a mood to encourage him further.;    "I can give beauty," Roth
bitterly tells one of his low-life pals, after being rejected once more by
Hanson, "and I can take it away.";    And so the tragedy of Marla Hanson takes
form at last.;    This isn't such a bad movie that it can't be watched without
pain. It was made competently enough. It's just a pointless, exploitive movie
with a hollow core, telling us practically nothing about Marla Hanson beyond
what happened to her one night on the streets of New York.;    Before the
slashing, she was an ambitious young woman who wanted us all to know her name.
Sadly, the movie gives us no compelling reason to remember her as anything but
"the model whose face was slashed."  </TEXT>
