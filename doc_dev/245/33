<TEXT>     The film's success has propelled Thomas Harris' popular 1988 novel to the
No. 1 spot on the paperback best-seller lists. It has whipped up heavy demand
in bookstores for "Red Dragon," the 1981 novel in which Harris first
introduced the brilliant Lecter. And it has sent people to video outlets in
search of "Manhunter," the film adaptation of "Red Dragon.";    "Lecter is one
of the great unique and intriguing villains," says George Witte, a St.
Martin's Press editor who helped edit "The Silence of the Lambs." "I think the
fact that he is a psychiatrist is part of the fascination.";    Lecter's
insights into character make "The Silence of the Lambs" a psychological as
well as a suspense thriller. In agreeing to help FBI trainee Clarice Starling
(Jodie Foster) track down another serial killer, the imprisoned Lecter exacts
his own psychological toll from the young agent.;    Don't look to Harris for
any clues about Lecter's appeal. A former Associated Press reporter who
covered crime in New York City, Harris declines to give interviews.;    It is
common for a new movie to increase book sales ("Lambs" displaced Michael
Blake's "Dances With Wolves" as the top paperback on Publisher's Weekly's
March 1 list). But what is more unusual is for readers and movie-lovers to be
so intrigued by a character that they seek out earlier appearances.;   
"People come in and ask, 'What's that movie with Dr. Hannibal Lecter?' " says
Joel Jacobson, owner of Cinema Concepts, a video store in Newington, Conn.;   
It's "Manhunter," the critically admired but little-seen 1986 film directed by
Michael Mann, best known for the visual style he brought to "Miami Vice." Like
the hit TV series, "Manhunter" is awash in vibrant blues and whites. Lecter
(his name is spelled Dr. Lektor in "Manhunter") is imprisoned in a blindingly
white cell, a stark contrast to the dungeon he inhabits in Jonathan Demme's
dark "The Silence of the Lambs.";    While important, Lecter's role is less
pivotal in "Manhunter." As portrayed by Brian Cox (who looks eerily like
Hopkins, with his severely slicked-back hair), Lecter is clever and witty but
neither as menacing nor mesmerizing as Hopkins.;    We know Cox's Lecter has
committed unspeakable murders, because Will Graham, the FBI agent who caught
him, was rewarded with a nervous breakdown. Now Graham (William L. Petersen)
has agreed to take on one more case and catch one more sicko. Graham visits
Lecter in his cell to recapture the serial-killer "mind-set," and it almost
catapults him over the edge again.;    The plot of "Manhunter" resembles that
of "The Silence of the Lambs," but it is a more terrifying film. The serial
killer (played by Tom Noonan) is a monstrous-looking creep who butchers entire
families. In one scene, director Mann soaks the victims' white bedroom in
sweeping splashes of blood. And Petersen's intense FBI agent always seems on
the precipice of disintegration.;    Will we see Lecter again?;    Harris is
at work on a new novel for Delacorte Press, which is silent on the question of
whether the wily psychiatrist will return. (box)  </TEXT>
