   Portraying the physically or mentally impaired
presents a challenge to film actors, who must make the part credible
as well as sensitive. Academy Award voters have rewarded several for
their efforts with the coveted Oscar. This year, Dustin Hoffman and
Tom Hanks are competing for the best actor prize, based on their
roles as adults with diminished mental capacities. As critics noted,
both infused their parts with credibility, keeping their characters
grounded in the realities of their predicaments, rather than playing
Tinsel Town cliches.
   ``Tom is fun ... but he had to be more restrained,'' said
director Penny Marshall. ``Innocent and shy was better than loud and
brash and broad. If (his character) is just skipping down the block
and making silly faces, I don't think you get involved with the
movie.
   ``Basically, you have to not act like what you think a child acts
like, but get in touch with the child inside of you.''
   Indeed, both actors found the key to their depictions from within.
   ``I simply pretended I was 12 years old. That's all I did,'' said
the 32-year-old Hanks of his role as Josh Baskin, a child locked in
a man's body in ``Big.''
   Hoffman, who plays a compulsive autistic savant in ``Rain Man,''
discovered the secret to Raymond Babbitt by examining his own
fastidious acting habits. ``I suddenly realized that I was playing
off myself because I know something about obsession and I'm
comfortable being obsessive,'' the 51-year-old actor said. ``The
rest of it just took care of itself.''
   Such introspection brought more than believability to ``Rain
Man'' and ``Big.'' It also allowed both actors to touch on emotions
not limited to their character's situation.
   In ``Rain Man,'' for example, Hoffman's autistic savant was used
not for melodrama but to illuminate the fear of the unknown and the
desire for order that many of us share. And as a youngster suddenly
thrust into a cutthroat corporate environment, Hanks hinted that
innocence and fairness can, in the end, prevail.
   Yet, given their subject matter, both films ran the risk of
falling into Hollywood formula, where complicated disorders are
reduced to plot devices, and multidimensional people with
disabilities are simplified for audience appeal.
   Actors such as Oscar-winner Jack Nicholson (as a renegade mental
patient in 1975's ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'') and
Emmy-winner Larry Drake (the mildly retarded office clerk on ``L.A.
Law'') have been singled out for accurately portraying the mentally
impaired.
   And Academy Award voters and film critics have praised a variety
of other actors playing characters with mental and physical
impairments: Jane Wyman won an Oscar for playing a deaf-mute in
1948's ``Johnny Belinda''; Patty Duke was awarded a statuette for
her depiction of Helen Keller in 1962's ``The Miracle Worker.''
   Marlon Brando was commended for his performance as an injured war
veteran for 1950's ``The Men''; Cliff Robertson won an Oscar for
playing a man with mental retardation in 1968's ``Charly''; Jon
Voight took the best actor prize for playing a paraplegic in 1978's
``Coming Home''; John Malkovich was a best supporting actor nominee
for his role as a blind border in 1984's ``Places in the Heart.''
   And John Hurt and Charles Laughton suffered pounds of daily
makeup and folded their bodies into contorted positions for
sensitive roles they played. For his lead in 1980's ``The Elephant
Man,'' Hurt received a nomination for best actor. Laughton won
critical and industry praise in 1939's ``The Hunchback of Notre
Dame.''
   But many others have been faulted for overblown, inaccurate
representations.
   Josie Abady directed the play ``The Boys Next Door,'' about four
mentally handicapped men in a group home.
   ``Like all people, people who are handicapped are funny, they're
pathetic, they're great,'' Abady said.
   ``You just think cheap shot, and you've got the stereotype,''
Drake said. ``Hoffman's character and my character both have a full
range of emotion. And that seems to surprise people _ that the
characters can feel as much as they feel, and note as much as they
note.''
   As originally written by Barry Morrow, ``Rain Man'' described
Hoffman's autistic character as ``an overgrown Cabbage Patch doll,''
a person with the lovable, huggable habits of the mentally retarded
as typically seen through entertainment industry eyes.
   ``But Dustin suggested that it would be more interesting if the
guy was more autistic, more quirky and less cuddly,'' said ``Rain
Man'' co-screenwriter Ron Bass. ``The idea is that there would be
two autistic characters _ the Raymond character who is clinically
autistic and the Charlie character (a coldhearted car salesman
played by Tom Cruise) who is emotionally autistic.
   ``In this situation, you don't fall in love with Dustin right
away,'' Bass said. ``He's a difficult guy, and just when you think
what he's doing is kind of cute and sweet, he does something
completely weird.''
   Hoffman's depiction of autism was much better than what he's seen
in the past, said George Zitnay, executive director of the Joseph P.
Kennedy Jr. Foundation.
   Zitnay said movies tend to depict the disabled ``as being much
more disabled than they really are. ... My attitude has always been
that films have done a disservice to persons with mental
retardation.''
   As the creators of ``Rain Man'' tried to be true to the autism
disorder, the makers of ``Big'' also chose not to let the script or
its star resort to shtick.
   ``It's such a high-concept idea that there's a huge temptation to
just play the jokes and not the emotion or character,'' said ``Big''
co-writer Gary Ross.
   ``But I think (the movie) lets us reveal a lot about the adult
world, using Josh as a mirror: that we all have a child inside us
and we all can operate childishly. As soon as you start trying to
figure (the character) out intellectually, you lose it.''
