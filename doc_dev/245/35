   Pop musician Julian Lennon has purchased a
home atop the Santa Monica Mountains which was formerly a U.S. Army
radar station complete with 13-inch-thick concrete walls.
   The son of the late John Lennon closed escrow Friday on the
one-acre property, said the property's former owner, Richard Somers,
who said he bought the site in 1967 for $30,000. Somers would only
say that Lennon paid between $1 million and $2 million for the
property which has a gated road and a 360-degree view of the city.
   The original 2,400-square-foot bunker was camouflaged to look
like a home, including fake windows. Real windows were put in when
the bunker was later remodeled into a 4,000-square-foot house. The
secluded home also has a swimming pool.

   Actors Robert Morley and Robert Hardy were among a
host of stars who gathered at a West End theater Sunday for a
champagne tribute to Dame Gladys Cooper on the centenary of her
birth.
   The occasion was the opening of a Gladys Cooper bar at the
Playhouse Theater, which she managed between 1927 and 1933.
   Dame Gladys, who died in 1973 at 85, was one of the foremost
actresses of her generation. During World War I, she was Britain's
No. 1 pinup girl.
   In 1939, Alfred Hitchcock took her to Hollywood to play Laurence
Olivier's sister in ``Rebecca.'' Her other film successes included
``That Hamilton Woman,''``The Song of Bernadette,''``The White
Cliffs of Dover'' and ``Madame Bovary.''
   The Playhouse Theater now is run by novelist and former
politician Jeffrey Archer.
   Morley, 80, is married to Dame Gladys' daughter Joan; Hardy was
married to her daughter Sally.

   Calling the United States a ``nation at risk,''
Oliver North criticized the news media and Congress and praised
President Reagan in a speech before a friendly audience of about 200
people.
   North, a former White House aide awaiting trial for his role in
the Iran-contra scandal, spoke Saturday and raised between $25,000
and $30,000 for his defense, according to organizers of the event.
   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel is charged with illegally
diverting profits from arms sales to Iran to the Nicaraguan Contras.
He has appeared at fund-raising engagements since May in an effort
to raise a reported $1 million.

   The mother of teen-age AIDS victim Ryan White
says an upcoming television movie about his story is ``excellent,''
but some residents of Indianan may not be looking forward to the
television portrayal.
   ABC's ``The Ryan White Story,'' starring Lukas Haas, is scheduled
to air Jan. 16.
   The movie includes a brief, cameo role by the 17-year-old. Ryan,
a hemophiliac who contracted AIDs through a blood transfusion in
1984, portrays an older hemophiliac friend who died of AIDS in real
life.
   The movie follows Ryan's lengthy legal battle to return to class
in Russiaville, southwest of Kokomo. The story ends by portraying
his first day at Hamilton Heights High School in Cicero, where the
family later moved.
   The Whites previewed the movie in Los Angeles in early November
and plan to attend two benefit screenings in Washington in January.
The Whites received $50,000 to $75,000 for the broadcast rights to
their story.

   FloJo, Bulldog and the Champ _ those are among
the personalities Americans will remember as the ``hot numbers'' of
1988, Life magazine says.
   In its January 1989 issue, Life looked back at the past year and
came up with these celebrities as the embodiment of '88:
   _Florence Griffith Joyner, 28, who ``hit the track scene like
fireworks, won three races and became the sensation of the Olympic
Games.''
   _Michelle Pfeiffer, 31, the actress who had hot roles in
``Married to the Mob,'' ``Tequila Sunrise'' and ``Dangerous
Liaisons.''
   _Tom Hanks, who starred in ``Big'' and ``Punchline.'' ``You can
bank on this,'' says Life. ``In April Hanks will play yet another
role, that of a 32-year-old winning his first Oscar.''
   _Orel Hershiser, 30, the Los Angeles Dodger who pitched with a
bulldog's tenacity for 59 scoreless innings in the regular season;
he then starred in the World Series and won the Cy Young Award.
   _George Michael, 25, the sexy pop singer whose debut album,
``Faith,'' became the first album ever to top all three of the pop,
adult and black charts.
   _Stephen Hawking, 46, a physicist who was given three years to
live when diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease 25 years ago; he hit
the best-seller charts with ``A Brief History of Time.''
   _Mike Tyson, 22, and Robin Givens, 24, whose heavyweight marital
difficulties dominated the scandal sheets for much of the year, even
as Tyson defended his boxing crown and Ms. Givens starred in
television's ``Head of the Class.''
