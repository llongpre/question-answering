   What do little movie stars do when they
grow up? Keith Thibodeaux, the Little Ricky of ``I Love Lucy,'' is
the drummer of a Christian rock band called the Lively Stones.
   He's also taking advantage of an upswell in nostalgia for
``Lucy'' since the April death of his TV mother, Lucille Ball, and
is appearing on a half dozen national TV shows to talk about her
legacy.
   Thibodeaux, 39, is the only surviving member of the ``I Love
Lucy'' cast. Others featured in the show _ which ran from 1951
until 1960 _ were Desi Arnaz, who died in 1986; Vivian Vance, dead
in 1979; and William Frawley, who died in 1966.
   Other children also portrayed Little Ricky as an infant.
Thibodeaux was the only Little Ricky with speaking lines. ``I Love
Lucy'' credits listed him by his stage name, Richard Keith.

   Tennis champ Boris Becker says he's
disturbed by military spending and poverty in rich countries, and
stunned by the amount of money he is paid to play tennis.
   ``It's a joke what they pay me, when you think that my work
consists only of hitting a tennis ball over the net,'' the
multi-millionaire Becker was quoted Wednesday by Sports, a
Hamburg-based magazine.
   Becker is considering a return to his West German home from the
tax haven of Monte Carlo where he lives but said he would refuse to
serve in the military, instead preferring civilian service, a legal
alternative for conscientious objectors in West Germany.

   A magistrate ruled that Miss West
Virginia was in the right when she pulled a gun on another woman
who had kicked out the window of her car and pulled her hair in a
late-night fight over a man.
   Marion County Magistrate C. Frank Jones dismissed a charge of
brandishing against Lisa Bittinger, 21, saying she had a right to
show the small-calibre handgun during the Nov. 7 tussle with Tammy
Boyce, 23.
   ``If someone has you by the hair, and you just momentarily bring
it into view to scare them off, that's not brandishing,'' Jones
said.
   Bittinger and Boyce argued at a bar over a man who Bittinger is
dating and Boyce dated some years ago, according to testimony.
Bittinger testified that Boyce chased her in another car when they
left the establishment, smashed into her car and then attacked her.
   In a separate ruling, Jones found Boyce guilty of reckless
driving, battery and destruction of property. She was sentenced to
concurrent terms of 120 days in jail and freed on bond until Dec.
27.
   ``I wanted to give her time to enjoy her holiday,'' Jones said.
``This whole thing was really just a cat fight.''

   Princess Diana beamed with pride as her sons,
Princes William and Harry, sang Christmas carols with their
classmates at a school concert.
   William, 7, sang ``In The Bleak Mid-Winter,'' ``This Little
Baby,'' ``Walking In The Air'' and ``Gloria In Excelsis Deo,'' in
which he had a one-line solo.
   But 5-year-old Harry stole the show as he sang the names of all
the reindeer in ``Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer'' and chirped:
``Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you pull my sleigh
tonight?''
   St. Matthew's Church in Bayswater, west London, was packed for
the concert by the 140 schoolchildren.
   A Royal aide said: ``The Princess looked very proud, like all
the parents.''
