   Jodie Foster, who had the thrill and
disappointment of an unsuccessful Academy Award nomination 13 years
ago, won the best actress Oscar Wednesday night for her portrayal
of a rape victim in ``The Accused.''
   ``This is such a big deal and my life is so simple,'' the
ebullient 26-year-old actress told the Shrine Auditorium audience
as she clutched the glistening trophy.
   ``There are very few things _ there is love and work and family
_ and this movie was so special to us because it was all three of
those things,'' she said.
   In ``The Accused,'' Miss Foster played Sarah Tobias, a brassy
waitress who is raped by a gang in a tavern's back room.
   She reflected on the film in a touching tribute to her mother,
Brandy, ``who taught me that all of my fingerpaintings were
Picassos and that I didn't have to be afraid, and mostly that
cruelty might be very human and it might be very cultural but it's
not acceptable, which is what this movie is about.''
   Miss Foster was previously nominated for an Oscar, in the
supporting actress category, at age 12 for her role as a prostitute
in ``Taxi Driver.''
   The best actress Oscar may focus attention on her maturity as an
actress rather than the notoriety stemming from the attempted
assassination of President Reagan by John Hinckley.
   The mentally-disturbed drifter was trying to impress Miss Foster
because of a fixation he developed after seeing ``Taxi Driver'' 14
times.
   Before coming backstage to address the press following her Oscar
win, a representative of the Academy admonished reporters not to
question the actress about the Hinckley affair.
   ``This is like winning the lottery or something,'' Miss Foster
said backstage. ``This is my 24th year in the film industry and
it's probably the longest I've spent anywhere. ... I'm very proud
of the movie. The movie is true and it's honest. It takes the truth
and it smacks it in your face.''
   Her growth as an actress was illustrated by the competition she
faced for the award: Glenn Close in ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' Meryl
Streep in ``A Cry in the Dark,'' Sigourney Weaver in ``Gorillas in
the Mist'' and Melanie Griffith in ``Working Girl.''
