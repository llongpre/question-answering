   A new breed of filmmakers is leaving a
deep imprint on West German consciousness with movies about Turks
trapped between the ways of their new German homeland and
traditional customs of their own kin.
   ``Right now these movies are in the vanguard of German films,
they are among the best in the whole country,'' said Frank Gethke,
deputy head of the German Film and Television Academy in West Berlin.
   Critics are mesmerized by the new films portraying the struggles
of Turks in a modern, and sometimes unfriendly, Western society.
   One of the new movies, ``Yasemin,'' by German director Hark Bohm,
won top prize at the prestigious German Film Awards in West Berlin.
   Another movie, Tevfik Baser's ``Abschied vom Falschen Paradies''
(``Farewell to a False Paradise''), was among the nation's Top 10
films. Baser is Turkish-born, and is building a reputation as one of
West Germany's leading film directors.
   Turks are West Germany's largest foreign minority, numbering more
than 1.5 million. They are often targets of intense resentment by
many natives, who see them as unfair competition for scarce jobs and
housing.
   The latest films by Bohm and Baser try to bridge a sizeable
cultural gap.
   ``These films aim to improve Germans' understanding about the
Turkish minority living among them, and I think they succeed,''
Gethke said.
   Baser's and Bohm's films portray young Turkish people not only
isolated within Western culture, but also under intense pressure
from their conservative families to be wary of Western ideals.
   In Bohm's film, a young Hamburg man falls in love with a
progressive-minded Turkish girl, Yasemin, but the relationship is an
impossible one because of her family's strong resistance.
   Baser first impressed critics three years ago with ``40 m2
Deutschland'' (``40 Square Meters of Germany''), a fictional movie
about a woman named Turna locked up by her strict husband in a seedy
Hamburg apartment after they arrived in West Germany from Turkey.
The German-language film takes its name from the minuscule size of
the couple's new home.
   Turna revolts against her husband's efforts to isolate her from
Western ways, but fails to find freedom even after he dies during an
epileptic fit. The desperate woman suddenly faces a culture in which
she cannot even understand what her neighbors are saying, and is
left completely without friends.
   Baser tracks similar themes in ``Farewell to a False Paradise,''
based on the true story about a young Turkish woman who is sent to
jail for killing her Turkish husband after he brutalizes her. She
finds happiness behind prison walls, totally casting off her
family's male-dominated customs.
   But in the end, she is to be deported after her release from the
``false paradise'' of prison, and she contemplates killing herself
rather than having to return to a homeland which she now considers
completely foreign.
   ``Farewell to a False Paradise'' launched the Turkish-born
actress Zuhal Olcay into sudden stardom in West Germany, and she won
best actress honors at the German film awards.
