   ``Wild At Heart,'' a bloody, sexually
explicit black comedy by American director David Lynch, won the
Golden Palm award Monday night as the best film at the 43rd Cannes
Film Festival.
   The host country's favorite, French box-office idol Gerard
Depardieu, was honored as best actor for his title role in ``Cyrano
de Bergerac,'' a lavish costume drama.
   Krystyna Janda of Poland won the best actress award for her
portrayal of an innocent, apolitical woman who accidentally is
sucked into the Kafkaesque prison system because a man she knew was
a suspect in ``The Interrogation,'' by Polish director Ryszard
Bugajski.
   The 1980 movie by Bugajski was banned from Polish theaters until
the pro-democratic reforms last year. The film was a favorite with
the Solidarity underground on videotape.
   The best director award went to Pavel Lunghin of the Soviet
Union for his first film, ``Taxi Blues,'' a look at the seamy side
of glasnost.
   Another Soviet director, Gleb Panfilov, was honored for best
artistic contribution for ``The Mother,'' the story of a woman's
anguish as her son becomes radicalized by the family's harsh life
under czarist rule and is tried for subversion.
   Lynch, 43, became the second American in a row to win the Golden
Palm, following Steven Soderbergh, the 1989 winner for ``sex, lies
and videotape.''
   ``I've been trying to get to the Cannes Film Festival for 20
years,'' Lynch told a celebrity-filled audience. ``It's a dream
come true.''
   Known for the bizarre nature of such films as ``Eraserhead'' and
``Blue Velvet,'' Lynch introduced himself in his movie's program at
Cannes as ``an Eagle Scout from Missoula, Mont.''
   His other work includes the current American television series
``Twin Peaks.''
   ``Wild At Heart'' portrays a love affair between Sailor Ripley,
who commits manslaughter in self-defense, and Lula Pace Fortune.
   The film becomes a chase, as the young couple _ played by
Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern _ is pursued through the deep South
and Texas by a variety of antagonists. There is close-up gore,
explicit love scenes and frequent flashes of humorous fantasy.
   Janda, 38, has worked with several of Poland's top directors but
until Monday was little-known abroad. In ``The Interrogation,'' she
is constantly on screen, moving audiences with a harrowing
portrayal of a victim of repression.
   Depardieu, 41, is a veteran of 60 films and has received
unanimous raves from French critics for his portrayal of Cyrano,
the long-nosed, lovelorn cavalier of Edmond Rostand's famous play.
   The Jury's Grand Prize, traditionally a sort of runner-up award,
went to two films from other continents _ ``Sting of Death'' by
Kohei Oguri of Japan and ``Tilai'' by Idrissa Ouedraogo of Burkina
Faso.
   The First Jury Prize went to ``Hidden Agenda,'' a controversial
film by Briton Ken Loach depicting British government attempts to
cover up human rights abuses by security forces in Northern Ireland.
   The Grand Prize for technical achievement was awarded to Pierre
Lhomme, director of photography for ``Cyrano de Bergerac.''
   Several films not in the running for the Golden Palm were
honored by the 10-member jury. These included ``Don't Move, Die or
Come Back to Life,'' by first-time Soviet director Vitali Kanevski,
and ``The Lunch Date,'' by American Adam Davidson, selected as best
short film.
