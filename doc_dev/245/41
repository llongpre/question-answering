   About 25,000 demonstrators, some
lugging crosses, urged mass boycotts of ``The Last Temptation of
Christ'' upon its release today, and at least one major theater
chain has decided against showing the film.
   The movie opens in nine major cities at the height of a
nationwide fundamentalist furor sparked by Christians who say it is
blasphemous in its portrayal of a Jesus Christ tempted to abandon
his divinity.
   In New York City today, about two dozen demonstrators picketed
in front of the Ziegfeld Theater, some shouting at the hundreds of
film-goers who formed a line that wrapped around the block for a
matinee showing.
   ``We see it as an attack on morality and traditional family
values,'' said Rabbi Yosef Friedman, who carried a sign reading,
``Rabbis Protest Mockery of Any Religion.'' ``We feel these people
who are mocking Christianity today would also be willing to mock
Judaism.''
   ``WarGames'' director John Badham joined Warren Beatty and
Michael Mann at the Directors Guild of America today in support of
the film.
   ``We owe a debt of gratitude to this group of somewhat misguided
zealots. The film now will be seen by a lot of curiosity seekers,''
Badham said. ``What is not terrific is their effort to rewrite the
Bill of Rights.''
   An estimated 25,000 protesters jammed the streets around
Universal Studios Thursday, adding their voices to a chorus of
protest that has stretched from the studio lot to the halls of
Congress.
   ``A lot of impressionable people who would see this ... will
receive a totally skewed, biased, and blatantly false portrayal of
the person who is nearest and dearest to our hearts _ our savior
Jesus Christ,'' said the Rev. Paul Crouch, president of Trinity
Broadcasting.
   Newton, Mass.-based General Cinema Theaters decided against
showing the movie after company executives screened it this week.
The company _ the nation's fourth-largest movie chain with 1,338
screens in 318 locations _ offered no explanation for its decision.
   In Maryland, Delaware and North Carolina, newsletters and
petitions are being circulated in churches urging their members to
persuade theaters not to book the movie. The owners of Oregon's two
largest theater chains have said they will not show the film, as
did the 44-screen Douglas Theater Co. chain in Nebraska.
   And in Boston, Cardinal Bernard Law urged his archdiocese's
Roman Catholics to boycott the film because it is ``morally
offensive and repugnant to Christian belief.''
   ``One way to be heard is by not going. Another way is to write
the producers,'' Law wrote in the archdiocesan weekly paper.
   The movie, directed by Martin Scorsese and distributed by
Universal, opens to the public today in Los Angeles, Chicago,
Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, New York, Montreal
and Toronto. An invitation-only screening Thursday in Montreal drew
about 30 peaceful protesters outside the theater.
   Last week, the studio suddenly advanced the release of the film
by six weeks, giving its opponents less time to organize threatened
boycotts and, perhaps, taking advantage of the current publicity.
   In Thursday's protest, buses carrying thousands of Christians
rolled into the Universal parking lot, backing up traffic for a
mile on the nearby Hollywood Freeway and on roads around the
headquarters of MCA Inc., Universal's parent company.
   Many demonstrators lugged wooden crosses. Others, with children
in tow, carried hand-printed signs reading ``Boycott Blasphemy''
and ``The Greatest Story Ever Distorted.''
   Opponents of the film are enraged by Scorsese's portrayal of
Jesus as an ambivalent savior. In a hallucination while dying on
the cross, Christ imagines abandoning his divinity to live as an
ordinary man, and fantasizes about sex with Mary Magdalene.
   Most of the film's antagonists have not seen ``Last Temptation''
and base their enmity on reports from the small number of clergy
who have viewed it.
   Scorsese has defended his film, saying he wished to create a
story that would provoke people to think about Jesus as a man
confronting temptation. He said the film should be considered art
translated from a novel, not an interpretation of the Gospels. The
film is based on the 1955 novel by Greek author Nikos Kazantzakis.
   Willem Dafoe, the actor who portrays Jesus Christ in the film,
said today that he is baffled by protesters' complaints.
   ``No, I don't understand, I don't understand. I just think this
is a beautiful, powerful, positive film. Some people that for the
most part haven't seen it are coming out against it _ that I don't
understand,'' he said in an interview on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program.
   While reactions from clergy across the nation have been largely
negative, some have been more tolerant.
   Beth Cox, summer minister for the Fairfax Unitarian Church in
Virginia, said Christ could have been tempted by the sensual.
   ``Jesus was man and divine,'' Ms. Cox said. ``I would think that
the human side of him would have those thoughts.''
   Yet other members of the clergy suggested that the best thing to
do was not to make much ado about the motion picture.
   ``We find the film offensive, but we're not going to turn out
the troops to march on theaters,'' Monsignor William Reinecke,
chancellor for the Catholic Diocese of Arlington, Va. ``We don't
want to play it up.''
   Among the participants in Thursday's demonstration were the Rev.
Donald Wildmon, executive director of the American Family
Association of Tupelo, Miss., and Bill Bright, president of the San
Bernardino-based Campus Crusade for Christ.
   Bright has offered to raise $10 million to buy and burn the
film, and Wildmon has urged a nationwide boycott of MCA.
   Conservative Reps. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., Robert K.
Dornan, R-Calif., and Clyde Holloway, R-La., added their
denunciations late Wednesday in Congress, calling the movie
``scurrilous'' and ``blasphemous.''
   And in today's editions of The New York Times, a full-page ad
for the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and
Property carries an open letter to Universal with the headline,
``On the Verge of a Public BLASPHEMY!''
   In Pine Bluff, Ark., notes sent to the Flick Twin Cinema and a
local newspaper claimed an Aug. 1 fire that damaged the Flick
theater was set as a warning not to show or advertise the film.
   Both notes, which were turned over to police, were similar and
signed in block letters, ``The Lord's Servant.''
