   ``Days of Thunder'' is the best racing movie I've ever seen.
   It's realistic because actual NASCAR race cars were used in the
production, and the film relied heavily on real participants for
true-to-life impact. Much of the racing action came from actual
NASCAR races. The results are tremendous.
   Robert Duvall's performance was exceptional. Many of the
characters in the movie triggered almost instant real-life
parallels to people currently involved in the sport.
   The plot should be of interest to both racing enthusiasts and
non-race fans alike. There's action, humor, action, romance and
more action.
   The intense personal competitiveness found in our racing was
realistically portrayed. The competitive spirit off the racetrack,
and the importance of sponsors to the sport was accurate.
   One of the most impressive aspects of the movie was its
realistic portrayal of the camaraderie we have in the sport. Arch
rivals Cole Trickle (Cruise) and Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker) help
each other during a crisis. It's a genuine relationship we have in
racing. We may strap on our helmets week after week and go at it
against one another, but we come to each other's aid in a real time
of need.
   There's a multi-car crash scene in the movie which really struck
home. Cole comes wide open through the smoke and gets caught up in
the crash. I faced a similar situation last year in a race at
Pennsylvania International Raceway. I crashed big time, too, but
luckily I didn't get hurt.
   ``Days of Thunder'' shows the fear and apprehension racers face.
It's something with which you live, rarely ever discuss and try to
keep in the right perspective.
   People involved with racing on a daily basis will probably feel
there's a bit too much dramatization in ``Days of Thunder'' because
of all the crashing. We do ``rub sheet metal'' a lot, but not as
much as is depicted in the movie.
   And the heat of the battle seems to always focus on only two
cars, but I guess that is the basis for classic competition.
   As for the added drama, my feelings toward ``Days of Thunder''
parallel what a real fighter pilot might think about the level of
drama in ``Top Gun'': Things tend to be just a little bit different
when you get a bird's eye view.
   Still, I can't wait to go back to see ``Days of Thunder'' again,
this time with my family. The next time around, I'll probably sit
in the back row and really soak it in. I'll probably look at it a
bit more critically and with more scrutiny next time.
   The Paramount Pictures release is rated PG-13.
