   Could a generous donation from Bill Cosby be
enough to stave off bankruptcy for his hometown of Philadelphia?
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode is open to offers from the world's highest
paid entertainer.
   ``Maybe the answer to this problem really is to have Bill Cosby
come here and just give us his salary for the next five years and
we could bail our way out of this problem,'' Goode joked in an
interview Monday on the Financial News Network.
   He was responding to a remark by the interviewer, who said the
city's newspapers gave ``bigger play to Bill Cosby's salary than
the problems of Philadelphia.''
   On Monday, Cosby topped Forbes' list of the world's 40 richest
entertainers with two-year earnings projected at $115 million
   Philadelphia projects a $206 million deficit in its $2.1 billion
budget by June, and several banks have refused to guarantee more
borrowing by the city.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Ol' Blue Eyes is miffed. Now that George
Michael has made it to the top, Frank Sinatra says, he shouldn't
squander his talent by withdrawing from public view.
   ``Come on, George. Loosen up. Swing, man,'' Sinatra wrote in a
letter to the Los Angeles Times a week after the newspaper featured
a complaining Michael.
   ``Here's a kid who `wanted to be a pop star since I was about 7
years old,' '' Sinatra wrote. ``And now that he's a smash performer
and songwriter at 27, he wants to quit doing what tons of gifted
youngsters all over the world would shoot Grandma for - just one
crack at what he's complaining about.''
   In an interview, Michael said he was releasing his new album
without promotional videos or a concert tour and planned to keep
out of public view to reduce the strain of his celebrity status.
   ``Those who who have talent must hug it, embrace it, nurture it
and share it lest it be taken away from you as fast as it was
loaned to you,'' wrote Sinatra, who will be 75 on Dec. 12. ``Trust
me. I've been there.''

   BOSTON (AP) - The case of Charles Stuart, who allegedly shot his
pregnant wife, summoned police to the scene over his car phone and
later killed himself, is the subject of a TV movie starring
``thirtysomething'' actor Ken Olin.
   ``Good Night Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston,'' will be broadcast
Sept. 25 on CBS.
   The movie was produced in association with Arnold Shapiro, who
was taping a segment of the show ``Rescue 911'' in Boston when
Carol Start was slain Oct. 30.
   Public interest in the crime was heightened by a dramatic,
tape-recorded telephone conversation between Stuart and an
emergency dispatcher who tracked down the Stuarts' location to send
an ambulance.
   The crime shocked Bostonians and aggravated racial tensions,
particularly after a black man was named as a suspect. The crime's
hold on the public imagination grew greater still when it became
clear that the prime suspect was Stuart himself.

   PHOENIX (AP) - Robert Redford has begun shooting ``The Dark
Wind'' on the Hopi and Navajo reservations in Arizona despite
threats of a blockade by leaders of a Hopi village.
   The film is based on a novel by Tony Hillerman.
   Tribal officials gave permission for filming on the reservation,
saying they had been assured by Redford'sproduction company that
the movie would be sensitive to Hopi culture and religion.
   But leaders of the Hopi village of Shungopavi claimed the
script, which was not written by Hillerman, gives a sacrilegious
portrayal of Hopi secret ceremonies and depicts Hopis as inept,
profane, murderous drug users.
   Spokeswoman Bertha Torres said the script's ``underlying theme
was that Hopis are not very bright compared to Navajo people.''
Village leaders want all aspects of Hopi religious beliefs deleted
from the script, she said.
   The village has threatened a blockade, but Hopi police said they
knew of no attempts to disrupt the filming, which began Monday.
   Some Navajos have objected to Redford offering the leading role
of a Navajo policeman to Lou Diamond Phillips instead of a Navajo.
Phillips says he is part Cherokee.
