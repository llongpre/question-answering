   American band leader and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie
got a warm welcome Tuesday as Culture Minister Jack Lang named him
Commander of Arts and Letters, one of France's most prestigious
awards for excellence in the arts.
   An all-star lineup of American jazz greats was on hand for the
ceremonies in the gilded salons of the Culture Ministry, which was
packed with fans.
   Saxophone player Stan Getz, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bass
player Percy Heath, pianist Hank Jones, singer Billy Eckstine,
drummer Max Roach and saxophone players Jackie McLean and Phil Woods
were made Officers of Arts and Letters.
   ``This is a great pleasure, and entirely unexpected,'' Gillespie
said during the ceremony. ``It's a great thrill to have these great
gentlemen standing behind me. I'm their greatest fan and I thank you
very much.''
   The musicians are performing this week at the Villette on the
northern edge of Paris.

   The child stars of the wholesome ``Father
Knows Best'' series of the 1950s and '60s faced an off-camera
reality of drugs and brushes with the law, TV Guide magazine reports.
   The safe, loving, household of the Andersons, played by Robert
Young and Jane Wyatt, was far from the broken homes their three TV
children knew, writes Mike Littwin, a sports columnist for The
Baltimore Sun.
   Billy Gray, who played Bud, had no curfew and little direction.
His acting career effectively ended after he served a jail term for
marijuana possession.
   ``I didn't think much about the difference between my life and
Bud's then,'' he said. ``But now I look back at the show and see it
as a lie, a lie that was sold to the American people.''
   At 51, he has been married three times.
   Lauren Chapin, who portrayed Kathy, was married at 16, divorced
at 18. She went to jail for attempted check forgery. After kicking
her drug habit, she turned to religion and is an evangelist, living
with her second husband and two children in Killeen, Texas.
   Elinor Donahue, who played Betty, had a failed marriage to a man
working on the show. But another marriage has lasted 28 years. At
52, she is the mother of four and still working in television.
   ``I know everybody didn't live the way it was shown on `Father
Knows Best,''' she said. ``But there's nothing wrong with having
goals and visions and dreams. In that respect, `Father' filled a
wonderful part.''
   An article in the magazine's June 17 issue comes as cable's CBN
Family Channel has a seven-hour marathon of ``Father Knows Best''
episodes and reminiscences scheduled to air Sunday.

   He doesn't have Paul Newman's electric blue
eyes _ his are more blue-green. His hair is more blond, and at 42,
he is 22 years younger, but Fred Lewis looks enough like Newman to
be enjoying a lot of attention.
   Lewis, Newman's double during filming of the movie ``Blaze,'' was
mobbed when he stepped out of a limousine during filming in the
north Louisiana town of Winnfield.
   ``They said how great it was to meet me, and that they had seen
me on the screen for years,'' Lewis said. ``I tried to tell them
that they had the wrong fellow, but they just didn't want to hear
that.''
   Lewis will be faintly visible in scenes where Newman flashes by
in a car or appears as a vague outline.
   The movie casts Newman as former Louisiana Gov. Earl K. Long
during his whirlwind relationship with stripper Blaze Starr.
   Doubles are hired to spare actors burdensome tasks such as the
one Lewis faced when the film makers shot the scene where Long lay
in his coffin.
   ``I had to lie in state,'' Lewis said. He was able to remain
still until Lolita Davidovich, the actress who portrays Starr, bent
over him, pinched him and made mock kissing sounds.

   Astronaut George ``Pinky'' Nelson is leaving
the space agency to become an associate professor of astronomy and
provost at the University of Washington in Seattle.
   Nelson, who grew up in Minnesota, said he will continue to
support the space program through speaking and writing, but his
focus will be on academic work.
   ``I don't want to be sitting around talking about how good we
were, at least for a while,'' he said.
   A veteran of three space shuttle flights at age 38, Nelson said
he wants to return to his first career of astrophysics before he is
too old to accomplish anything.
   He also said he and his wife, Susie, a psychologist, are looking
forward to leaving Houston for the campus in Seattle, where he
received his doctorate in 1978. The Nelsons have two daughters, ages
17 and 14.
   Nelson served on the Discovery mission that returned the United
States to space two years after the Challenger explosion. In 1984,
he donned a backpack equipped with gas jets and flew untethered to
try to capture a spinning satellite, the first ever repaired in
space.

   Foreign Minister Brian Lenihan has been
discharged from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., after
recovering from a liver transplant last month, his son said Tuesday.
   Lenihan, 58, will remain in the United States for more tests, but
will return to Dublin by June 29, when Parliament is scheduled to
hold its first session following Thursday's elections. Lenihan, who
had been ill with the blood disorder hemochromatosis for more than
six months, is favored to win re-election.
   Brian Lenihan Jr. said his father was doing ``remarkably well.''
