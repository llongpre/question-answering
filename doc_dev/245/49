   Without a doubt, Cyrano de Bergerac is France's
most famous fictional character, with his long nose and gift of
poetic gab.
   Painfully shy and downright ugly, Cyrano was a master swordsman
with verve and panache who breathed his poetry and passion into the
tongue-tied head of a handsome soldier to win the lovely Roxanne.
   He's so popular this season that he's currently being portrayed
on the stage and in movie houses by France's top two leading actors.
   Nearly 100 years after he was created for theater, Cyrano is
once again tugging at the heart. Jean-Paul Belmondo is dazzling
audiences at the sold-out Marigny Theater, while Gerard Depardieu
is inducing tears _ and laughs _ in France's most expensive
cinematic production ever.
   ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' produced at a cost of $17 million,
opened March 28 to critical praise.
   The classic tale of unrequited love got a modern face lift in
1987 in the movie ``Roxanne,'' starring Steve Martin and Darryl
Hannah. Martin played a long-nosed fire chief in a contemporary
American small town.
   The newest versions are faithful to Edmond Rostand's play set in
17th-century France against a background of war between kings, a
war fought by such swashbuckling Gascons as D'Artagnan of the Three
Musketeers.
   Both Depardieu and Belmondo have received rave reviews from
critics in their portrayals of Cyrano, considered one of the most
difficult roles ever written.
   For Depardieu, 41, France's biggest box-office attraction with
60 films under his belt, ``Cyrano'' is his most brilliant
performance ever. He gives an eloquent delivery and sublime
dramatic portrayal of Cyrano. He is comic and poignant at the same
time, and with magnificent period costumes and sets, the film is
215 minutes of sheer poetry and pleasure.
   Belmondo portrays Cyrano in an athletic, swashbuckling way.
There tends to be a bit more shouting by Belmondo in the play.
Depardieu, on the other hand, literally whispers into the camera.
   The movie, which will open in the United States in December, was
filmed on location in Hungary with 2,000 actors and extras in
period costumes, 40 studio sets and 1,000 pikes and muskets. An
entire forest was cleared to film the siege of Arras, a town in
northern France where the French succeeded in ousting the Spaniards
in the mid-1600s.
   Studio Magazine, France's leading film monthly, devoted 20 pages
to the film and described Depardieu as ``an actor in a state of
grace.''
   ``Everything in Cyrano's character fits him like a glove,'' Marc
Esposito wrote. ``The power, the sensitivity, the arrogance, the
complexes, the fragility we sense under his imposing physique,
belongs as much to Cyrano as to Depardieu.''
   Jacques Weber, who triumphed in his portrayal of De Guiche, the
haughty count also enamored of Roxanne, called Depardieu ``a bomb
fallen from the moon.''
   Written by Rostand in 1897, ``Cyrano'' is as French as the
national anthem. Children study it in school and audiences know the
``nose'' and ``no thank you'' tirades by heart.
   Yet, it has defied filmmakers until now because of its
alexandrines _ iambic lines with six feet that rhyme. Rappeneau and
veteran screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere streamlined the original
text, but critics say they sacrificed neither the poetry nor its
romantic soul.
   ``Cyrano'' has also endured because its story is timeless. Who
has never felt despair looking in the mirror or pain upon
discovering that the one you love loves another?
   ``A little Cyrano sleeps in the heart of all of us,'' Depardieu
says.
   For Belmondo, 56, best-known for his tough-guy roles in
fast-paced thrillers, Cyrano marks a long-awaited return to his
roots as a dramatic actor and only his second stage appearance in
25 years.
   Director Robert Hossein said playing Cyrano had long been a
secret goal of Belmondo because the actor's father, Paul, used to
say the role was the ultimate test for an actor.
   ``When will you go back to your real profession? I will die
without seeing you as Cyrano,'' Belmondo senior would say as his
son posted one box-office smash after another, Hossein recalled.
   Paul Belmondo died several years ago.
   ``Belmondo is paying off a personal debt (to his father),''
wrote Jean-Pierre Thibaudat in Liberation. ``If the movies hadn't
been invented, he would have been the Coquelin of our times. And
Coquelin invented Cyrano.''
