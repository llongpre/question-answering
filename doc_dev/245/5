   Somebody give this man a medal.
   No, not Oliver North _ Mike Robe, the producer, writer and
director of the CBS movie ``Guts &amp; Glory: The Rise and Fall of
Oliver North.''
   For a film hurriedly made and rushed onto the air in time for
the important May rating period and the expected conclusion of
North's trial, it is surprisingly good. It airs in two parts,
Sunday and Tuesday.
   The crisply written script is based on Benjamin Bradlee Jr.'s
book of the same name. But Robe adds another dimension to the
``docudrama,'' turning it into his own statement on the Iran-Contra
affair: he has added a fictional character, a White House aide who
serves as the film's conscience _ since nobody apparently fulfilled
such a role in real life.
   Aaron Sykes, played by Terry O'Quinn, turns up in part one of
the movie as a mentor to North when the Marine colonel joins the
National Security Council. Sykes even suggests gently to North at
one point that some things, such as his children, are more
important than fighting Communists.
   Later in the movie, after the news of the Iran-Contra scandal
has broken, Sykes confronts North, arguing that the operation was
an attack on American democracy, not the grand, heroic gesture
North believed it to be. ``How many hostages are back?'' Sykes
demands. ``For all those missiles you sold to the same damn people
who blew up barracks and murdered 241 American boys? Shame on us!''
   North argues, ``We tried the only thing we thought would work''
to free the hostages, and insists that, in the case of arms to the
Nicaraguan Contras, ``we're fighting for democracy down there.''
   ``By keeping it from democracy here! Sell that somewhere else,
Colonel,'' Sykes retorts.
   By the end of the film, when North is faced with charges and
colleagues are running for cover, Sykes again confronts him: ``What
you guys tried to pull,'' he says, ``was nothing short of a secret
government, the most dangerous threat to my country I can
imagine.'' North sticks to his guns. As a Marine, he says, he
fights ``any way I can.''
   The appearance of Sykes does not turn ``Guts &amp; Glory'' into an
anti-Oliver North movie, largely due to the strength and guts of
David Keith's portrayal of the colonel. Keith has said in
interviews that he is a big fan of the real North.
   Annette O'Toole does justice to Betsy North, here portrayed as a
sympathetic, three-dimensional character, not the paperdoll cutout
of a housewife that would have been easier. Amy Stock-Poynton plays
Fawn Hall as an earnest defender of the cause.
   There are good performances all around, especially Barnard
Hughes as CIA Director William Casey, Paul Dooley as National
Security Adviser Bud McFarlane and Peter Boyle as Admiral John
Poindexter. Bryan Clark does a credible impersonation of President
Reagan.
   As if to counterbalance the creation of Sykes, Robe includes
another, if not fictional, then at least questionable episode. At
the beginning of part two of the movie, North is shown piloting a
plane over El Salvador, landing it under enemy fire and rescuing
Salvadoran soldiers. The story has been told but not substantiated.
Bradlee included it in his book with a note that it might not be
true.
   Even if it isn't true, it makes for a good movie _ not unlike
North himself.
