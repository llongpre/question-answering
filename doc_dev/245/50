   The actors Yves Montand likes are the kind of
actor he is himself.
   ``I admire Sean Connery very much,'' he said. ``I like Columbo _
Peter Falk. I like this kind of actors who become older but they
don't lose their youth, really. They go on with some charm and are
human beings. They don't destroy themselves with face lifts, which
are terrible.''
   Montand was recently in New York to receive this year's tribute
from the Film Society of Lincoln Center, the 17th person to be
honored and the first Frenchman. His two most recent films are
``Jean de Florette,'' which won the British Film Academy's prize
for best picture, and ``Manon of the Spring.'' In both, he portrays
a farming village patriarch, Cesar Soubeyran.
   ``The reason I didn't want to make the movies was not because I
look 20 years older,'' said the 66-year-old Montand. ``I said, `Let
the years do their job.' It was because I wanted to go on tour.''
   Montand started as a singer, was discovered by the legendary
Edith Piaf, made his first movie with her in 1945 and sang on stage
and made movies until 1968 when he decided to concentrate on film
acting. In 1982, he made a world singing tour which was a smash
success, and planned to repeat in 1984 but made the two movies
instead.
   ``I think it is a very good story, based on a wonderful book
(Marcel Pagnol's `L'Eau des Colines'). But it was courageous to
make this kind of part, contrary to what people wait for from you.
He is a nasty man. He could be very cruel in some ways,'' he said.
   Montand and actress Simone Signoret, who were married from 1950
until her death in 1985, used to read each other's movie scripts.
   ``Sometimes she would say, `You're going to shoot this thing? It
is awful.' I would say, `You're right but I promised this young
director.' Of course the movie is a flop,'' he recalled.
   ``Sometimes you fall in love with a story you're reading. If a
director has good taste, he puts you in his pocket.''
   Montand has advice about getting older: ``Humor, tenderness and
lucidity cannot change and are important in life as you become
older. You need to laugh, have a sense of humor, first of all
against yourself. Everybody needs tenderness. Tenderness cannot
become old. Never. And if you are clear _ this is right, this is
not right _ you stay a young man or woman.
   ``I'm going to look a little pompous now but I say, never, never
stop working with your memory. You remember a girl. What is her
name? You say it isn't important, forget it. No, no. Make the
effort to discover again the name of this girl, even if it is not
important. This is exercise, like for the muscles.''
   For physical exercise, Montand walks four or five miles every
day when he can. ``Sometimes I make a seven or 10-minute dance in
the morning. Then I take a shower and that's it.''
   At the tribute, French filmmaker Louis Malle called Montand
``one of the most romantic figures the French cinema has ever
known.''
   Montand, however, still hasn't figured out romance. ``I
remembered this morning, lying in bed, the first time a girl kissed
me or I kissed her. I didn't like it. Two months later, someone
else comes, you collapse. Both are very nice looking. It's very
peculiar.
   ``When you are an adult, it is a mystery. You love me. I love
you. It's the only thing you can say. You are mad. It's
unbelievable. It's a volcano inside. What does it mean? We can
understand nothing. Death, love, we don't know anything about.
Maybe it's better, I don't know. It's a wonderful mystery anyway,
thank God.''
   During the interview in Montand's suite in Hotel Maxim's, the
telephone rang several times and a Film Society representative
spoke to women who wished to stop by. ``I'm sure it is only for
autographs,'' the actor said with a charming smile.
   Since ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon of the Spring,'' Montand
has done a few TV appearances. He plans a TV version about Alfred
Dreyfus, the French army officer who was convicted for treason but
later found to be the victim of anti-Semitism. He also plans to do
a movie about terrorists.
   Montand's next movie, though, will be a musical, ``Three Seats
for the 26th,'' directed by Jacques Demy with music by Michel
Legrand, who collaborated on ``The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.''
   ``I don't want to tell you the story; I want it to be a
surprise,'' he said. ``It will not be a beautiful masterpiece as
made by Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire.''
