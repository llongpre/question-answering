   Moviemaker George Lucas, known for creating
galaxies and planets far, far away, is getting into some
down-to-earth city planning.
   Part of his vision for Houston is a globe-shaped ``Lumisphere''
covered with glowing fiber optics and housing a theater that would
be the focal point of a $50 million downtown center adorned with
giant TV screens.
   The project by Lucas of ``Star Wars'' fame and Century
Development Corp. would transform the shell of the Albert Thomas
Convention Center into ``Luminaire Houston'' _ a complex of
restaurants, clubs, theaters and shops.
   ``This is a city that always goes for something futuristic and
something outstanding,'' Mayor Kathy Whitmire, citing the Johnson
Space Center, said Thursday.
   Completion of the project, which still requires City Council
approval, is scheduled by early 1992.
   Whitmire had named a task force to study renovating the Albert
Thomas center in 1985, and the group began exploring the notion of
a ``festival marketplace'' like the West End Market in Dallas or
Faneuil Hall in Boston.

   Actor John Mahoney has been in a spate of movies
as a heavy, but now he's getting a chance to play a good guy.
   He has turned up as the sinister judge in ``Suspect,'' the
drink-splashed teacher in ``Moonstruck,'' a bumbling U.S. consul in
``Frantic'' and a white supremacist farmer in ``Betrayal.''
   Now, he is portraying Chicago White Sox Manager Kid Gleason in
John Sayles' new movie, ``Eight Men Out.''
   ``He's a very decent man, and I haven't got to play too many of
those,'' the Chicago-based actor noted recently.
   Mahoney said he isn't certain why he often is cast as an
unsavory character, but thinks it may have something to do with the
role that first brought him to attention in the East.
   His New York stage debut was in ``Orphans,'' in a role that
Albert Finney later portrayed in the film version: ``A man you
could believe could smack you in two if he wanted to, but he was
also a very loving person.''
   After filming ``Eight Men Out,'' Mahoney is back to his old
tricks: playing a father who tries to break up his daughter's
romance in a movie called ``Say Anything,'' and ``a rotten, slimy
character'' in a miniseries called ``Favorite Son.''

   Gov. Wallace G. Wilkinson is getting his
middle initial back on highway signs welcoming travelers to the
Bluegrass State.
   Some of the signs at Kentucky's borders were missing the ``G.''
_ that stands for Glenn _ in Wilkinson's name.
   ``Obviously, it's not correct. That's not his name that he was
sworn in as governor,'' said Transportation Secretary Milo D.
Bryant, who is having the offending signs replaced.
   Bryant said an alert highway supervisor noticed that workers
were leaving out the ``G.'' Signs made since the discovery bear the
initial.
   Bryant estimated only 10 to 12 signs are being changed, at a
cost of perhaps $44 each.

   New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch, not
known for mincing his words, isn't shy about his gestures either.
   He answered a heckler with a vulgar gesture during a speech to
the New York City Police union's convention Thursday.
   The mayor was interrupted by a heckler who yelled an obscenity
as Koch spoke about last month's riot in a park on Manhattan's
Lower East Side.
   Koch responded by telling a joke. As part of the punch line, he
grabbed the crook of his right arm while lifting his right forearm.
``That's for you,'' he said to the heckler, prompting loud applause
and laughter.
   The convention, held in upstate Monticello, initially had given
a cool reception to Koch as he spoke about the Aug. 7 riot at
Tompkins Square Park, which broke out as police tried to enforce a
late-night curfew there.
