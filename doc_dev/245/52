FILMMAKERS DISAGREE.

Using terms like "distorted fiction" and accusing the filmmakers of having "an 
agenda" to make the church look bad, Roman Catholic officials and observers are 
taking sharp exception to a new HBO movie based on a 1980s sex scandal in a 
Louisiana diocese involving a priest and dozens of boys. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, "Judgment," premiering tonight at 9, focuses less on the 
molestations and more on the attempts of the bishop and his vicar general to 
cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario revolves around a family (the Guitrys, played by Blythe Danner and 
Keith Carradine, with Michael Faustino as the son) and their flamboyant 
attorney (Jack Warden), who battle the entrenched power of the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
Although names are changed and events juggled, the plot closely follows a case 
that caused a sensation when it surfaced in 1984 at the Lafayette diocese deep 
in Cajun country. Father Gilbert Gauthe admitted molesting 37 children, 
including altar boys and parish Boy Scouts, and was given 20 years in prison 
without benefit of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gauthe attracted the most celebrity, seven priests eventually were 
removed and the diocese and insurers reportedly paid families more than $22 
million in settlements. The family on which the movie family was patterned won 
$1,025,000. 
</P>
<P>
The revelations were the first pedophilia case of such scope to scandalize the 
church. There have been many others reported since. Jason Berry, a prominent 
investigative reporter in New Orleans who specializes on Catholic affairs and 
is completing a book on pedophilia and homosexuality in the church, estimates 
that the church has paid between $100 million and $300 million in 100 child 
sexual settlements in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie, the Guitrys join other families seeking financial settlements 
from the church, but insurance lawyers insist that the church not give the 
families spiritual solace, on grounds that that would constitute an admission 
of liability and damages would be costlier. The Guitrys are very devout but 
grow furious that the bishop and his staff had known about the abuse but kept 
giving the offending priest new assignments within the parish. They break from 
the group and hire an attorney. Then the case becomes public. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on "Judgment," Msgr. Alexander Sigur, new vicar general of the 
Lafayette diocese portrayed in the movie, referred The Times to a written 
statement that he made to written questions from Sister Mary Ann Walsh, media 
editor of the Catholic News Service. She had supplied him with a copy of the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a part of the film," Sigur responded, "is based on fact and the balance 
is distorted fiction. . . . The portrayal of the church's reaction to that 
priest's conduct is totally distorted." 
</P>
<P>
The truth, he said, is that "immediately" upon receiving notice that the priest 
was accused of committing these pedophilic acts, he was removed and "criminal 
proceedings were instituted." He also disputed how the movie "fictitiously 
depicts" the church as "callous" about the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Getting a movie made on the events at the parish was problematic. Executive 
producer Steve Tisch ("The Burning Bed," "Risky Business") said that he and 
producers Ron Hershman and Dan Wigutow pitched the idea to CBS and NBC and were 
turned down. ABC, however, declaring itself not turned off by the controversial 
theme, ordered a script, Tisch said. 
</P>
<P>
But later, Tisch said, when he asked for some assurance that "top management of 
Capital Cities," which owns ABC, would fully support the project, "a top 
network executive . . . took it to a top Cap Cities executive -- who said that 
it (the movie) is not going to happen at ABC." 
</P>
<P>
An ABC spokesman said that the project was dropped because the network had done 
two other molestation movies ("Deadly Silence" and "Unspeakable Acts") and that 
"it did not go up the corporate ladder," as Tisch described. 
</P>
<P>
Hershman, who previously produced a segment on the Louisiana parish scandal for 
the CBS news magazine "West 57th," and Wigutow then met with HBO and got a 
go-ahead when Tom Topor agreed to write and direct. Topor had written the 
Broadway play and screenplay for "Nuts," which has an incest theme, and "The 
Accused," about a gang rape. 
</P>
<P>
First-time director Topor has only seen an early "rough cut" of the film 
because, he related, he was fired late in the production after battles with his 
producers and was replaced by veteran director David Greene ("Roots," "Fatal 
Vision"). But he stands by what he saw that far, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Relevant sources who were asked to pre-screen videocassettes of "Judgment" had 
many criticisms -- erroneous church liturgy, faulty legal references, a mixing 
of time frames. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime New York City news reporter, Topor agreed that some people might 
find distortions in the movie and said that he did make "certain 
extrapolations": "The question is whether I distorted its emotional essence or 
its narrative essence, and I don't believe I did." 
</P>
<P>
J. Minos Simon, the attorney portrayed by Warden, thought the portrayals were 
"excellent," but maintained that the filmmakers were "generous" with the 
bishop. 
</P>
<P>
"His agony was not over wanting to tell," he said. "His agony was over the fact 
that the secrecy lid was lifted and he was exposed for the first time." He 
contended that the bishop knew about Gauthe's "proclivities" but kept 
transferring him within the diocese "to a fresh new lot of victims." 
</P>
<P>
Simon had an informant -- not a priest and not one who was blackmailed into 
helping, as shown in the movie -- who discovered diocese files which revealed 
that at least 24 priests, about one-fourth of the priest population in the 
diocese, were homosexual. This information, falling into Simon's hands, 
"jarred" the diocese and forced it to admit liability, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran reviewer Henry Herx of the Catholic News Service complained that the 
film makes no attempt at balance in treatment of the clergy, "not even one good 
priest." He commended the filmmakers for focusing on the "agonized family 
rather than the sexual crimes of the clergyman." 
</P>
<P>
The candor of the film won't offend Catholics, but they're likely to be "much 
more sensitive" to the treatment of the church as an uncaring bureaucracy, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Father Gregory Coiro, a public affairs official in the Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles, found the movie priests "stereotypical and unrealistic." He said that 
while the subject should not be covered up, "I really feel that the people who 
made this movie had an agenda, and I'm sorry to say but I think their agenda 
was to make the church look bad." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the priesthood has its failures "as in any other profession. 
There's 55,000 priests in this country and a person who doesn't know this could 
very easily get the impression -- especially with (recent widely reported 
scandals involving priests and even archbishops) -- well, 'My God, the priests 
are all a bunch of perverts.' Thing is, most priests are very, very hard 
working and very, very caring and none of that is addressed. It's almost like 
all priests are guilty by association." 
</P>
<P>
Berry, who did the first in-depth reporting on the Louisiana case, said that 
while the film contained "gross distortions" from the facts of that case, a 
drama can't be held to the standards of investigative news.
