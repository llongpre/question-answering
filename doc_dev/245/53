   Videos reviewed this week: ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Written
on the Wind'' and ``A Tiger's Tale.''
   
   ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' (Touchstone Home Video; VHS-Beta,
$29.95; Rated R)
   
   Robin Williams was nominated for an Academy Award for his
portrayal of an irreverent and raucous Army deejay in Saigon during
the Vietnam War. Though not necessarily the talented comic's best
film role to date _ ``Moscow on the Hudson'' and ``The World
According to Garp'' may have been better _ the movie is nonetheless
a one-man tour-de-force.
   The movie is based on the real-life antics of Adrian Cronauer
(Williams), who arrives in Saigon in 1965, full of attitude and
independence _ not the best combination for the military
compulsives at Armed Forces Radio, which is languishing under an
easy-listening format.
   Cronauer's mission is to put life into the narcoleptic station,
and that he does beginning with his first rock 'n' roll shout of
``Goooooood Morning, Vietnam!'' He replaces Perry Como and Percy
Faith with James Brown and Jerry Lee Lewis. The grunts love it;
military brass is appalled.
   And with this popularity comes an inevitable clash with military
censors who sanitize the news and issue propaganda directives. But
Cronauer survives his critics only to tumble into the chilling
realities of the war and the authorities who help keep it boiling.
   Williams is at home as a deejay, obviously interspersing
Williams with Cronauer in what has to be one of cinema's longest
and greatest improvisations. He is explosive, enormously funny and
warm, injecting a humanity in an otherwise horrific landscape.
   Forest Whitaker, who was later tapped to portray jazz legend
Charlie Parker in Clint Eastwood's critically acclaimed ``Bird,''
puts in an expert performance as Cronauer's sidekick. Barry
Levinson's (``Diner'') direction is pristine.
   ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' is a contained story: There are no
Kubrick or Coppola-like underpinnings, and not much really goes on
outside of Cronauer's fight with the military; nor are there major
looks at the bloody battles that swirled outside Saigon _ and
inside, as well. Thus, it is a movie that indeed works better on
the home screen than as a theatrical release.
   Williams' impassioned and humorous performance makes it all
worthwhile, and besides, ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' is also a lot of
fun.

   ``Written on the Wind'' (MCA Home Video; VHS-Beta, $29.95; not
rated)
   
   This 1956 Universal release, starring Rock Hudson and Lauren
Bacall, has become something of a camp classic, a prime example of
director Douglas Sirk's talent for tales of overwrought passion.
   Contemplated calmly, everything about the movie is hard to take
seriously, from the premise, to the plot, to the scenery-chewing of
co-stars Dorothy Malone and Robert Stack.
   But that's missing the point. Forget calm. Forget serious. Sit
back and surrender to this steamy saga of the oil-rich Hadley
family and their fatal romantic frustrations. Odds are you'll enjoy
it, though you may hate yourself in the morning.
   Stack plays Kyle Hadley, the cynical, alcoholic scion who falls
hopelessly in love with Bacall and marries her after a courtship so
rapid it makes a whirlwind seem sluggish. Stack's best friend,
played by Hudson, is also hopelessly in love with Bacall, but
resolves to suffer silently.
   Enter Malone as Stack's sister. She is even more hopelessly in
love than the others _ with Hudson. Her unrequited passion has
turned her into a nymphomaniac. When Stack develops a small
fertility problem and Bacall turns up pregnant, it isn't hard for
the malicious Malone to persuade her brother his wife is fooling
around with his pal.
   Needless to say, before this tangled web is unraveled, a lot of
blood, sweat and tears have been shed.
   For her part in these carryings-on, Malone was awarded an
Academy Award as best supporting actress.

   ``A Tiger's Tale'' (Paramount Home Video; VHS@Beta, $79.95;
Rated R)
   
   In ``A Tiger's Tale,'' a 19-year-old high school student named
Bubber (C. Thomas Howell) falls for his girlfriend's mother, a
divorced nurse named Rose (Ann-Margret).
   It's easy to see why, but why she returns his affection _
setting off an affair lacking any heat at all _ is only one of the
things that doesn't make sense in this comedy-romance.
   There's also no good reason why Rose's bratty daughter (Kelly
Preston) is allowed to get away with just about anything, including
sabotaging her mother's sex life by poking a hole in her diaphragm.
   Or why Bubber, who intends to become a veterinarian, drags
around a full-grown tiger on a leash in small-town Texas.
   And then, there's the dialogue. Rose to Bubber: ``Sometimes when
your hair's messed up, you look like a partially open can.'' Or
Bubber to Rose: ``I may be 19 but I'm your man and you love me, and
I'm going to go sleep on the couch where a dejected man is supposed
to.'' And it wasn't even nighttime.
   Ann-Margret tries and almost rises above her role, and Charles
Durning as Bubber's father is good as usual. But the 1987 movie,
written and directed by Peter Douglas, son to Kirk and brother to
Michael, is just dumb.
