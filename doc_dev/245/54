<LEADPARA>  SO YOU say you've exhausted the shelves of every video store within driving

new releases? You've had an earful of films filled with foul language, bad
dialogue and worse music?;    Well, cheer up! Get happy! And remember, all you
need to shake these video doldrums is . . . a silent movie?  </LEADPARA>

ANTIQUE CLASSICS HIT TAPE NEXT WEEK  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Yes, ma'am! An entire early era of superb cinema is at your fingertips, if
you'll just be willing to open your eyes, give your ears a rest, and learn a
new language: the universal speech of emotional gesture.;    The release of a
number of classic silents by MGM/UA Home Video next week prompts us (once
again) to remind movie viewers everywhere that, if you're overlooking
silver-screen silents, you're passing up pure gold. Many of the most memorable
movies in cinema history are available on tape -- although you might have to
hunt a bit to find a copy. (Hint: Try your local public library.);    Listed
below are five feature films which can serve as a painless primer to silent
cinema -- although "silent" is a misnomer, as all are accompanied by marvelous
musical scores. Every one of these films is an enjoyable experience -- and a
refreshing change of pace.;     (box) "The Cameraman" (1928; MGM/UA). With his
stone face and rubber limbs, Buster Keaton had both body language and physical
genius that transcended the need for words. In this comedy classic, bumbling
newsreel photographer Keaton acrobatically caroms around the city, through a
ticker tape parade, a Chinese tong war and a yacht club regatta. The film also
features Keaton pantomiming a one-man baseball game at Yankee Stadium. Other
classic Keaton available on video includes the silent feature "The General"
and "Buster Keaton: A Hard Act To Follow" (HBO), an engrossing documentary on
his life and work.;    (box) "Metropolis" (1926; Budget Video/Cable Films).
This science-fiction epic, directed by Fritz Lang, portrays life, love and
revolution in a city of the future and contains special effects breathtaking
enough in scope and detail to rival most modern "F/X" extravaganzas. For those
unwilling to pump down the volume, a 1984 video re-release restored the film
and filled the sound track with a rock music score.;    (box) "The Thief of
Bagdad" (1924; Kartes). Douglas Fairbanks Sr. stars in this fabulous Arabian
Nights fantasy, as the notorious thief who gives up his lawless ways to win
the heart of a beautiful princess. A classic adventure film, featuring
spellbinding stunts and marvelous movie magic.;    (box) "Wings" (1927;
Paramount). This epic action film about aviators in World War I was the first
film -- and only silent -- to receive a best picture Oscar.;    Spectacular
dogfight sequences and aerial photography make this granddaddy of "Top Gun"
still a rousing bit of cinema.;    (box) "City Lights" (1931; Playhouse). Most
of Charlie Chaplin's work -- both silent and sound -- is available on video,
and most is still as brilliant, hilarious and poignant as it was
three-quarters of a century ago. "City Lights" is included here not only
because it is a gem, but because it is an oddity as well: the last of the
great silent films; a silent completed long after the advent of talkies. An
excellent follow-up -- and a true treasure for Chaplin aficionados -- is HBO
Video's recent documentary release, "The Unknown Chaplin," a collection of
outtakes and rehearsal clips from his classic early shorts.  </TEXT>
