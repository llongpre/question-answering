   For all its tragic drama and cruel farce,
Hollywood's anti-communist blacklisting has rarely been transformed
into moneymaking cinema, and that makes ``Fellow Traveller'' the
surprise of the British movie season.
   This low-budget movie about American victims of American
redbaiting is British-made and set largely in Britain.
   ``The American film industry has always been a world film
industry. American culture is my culture as well,'' explains
Michael Eaton, the English screenwriter.
   ``Fellow Traveller,'' he says, ``organically involves both our
countries.''
   The film's budget of under $3 million was shared by Home Box
Office and the British Broadcasting Corporation, with some
assistance from the British Film Institute. It opened Jan. 5 at
London's tiny Metro Cinema, where it broke the house record with an
opening week gross of $20,000. It will be seen in the United States
March 3 on the HBO cable channel.
   ``Fellow Traveller'' exemplifies the trend toward Anglo-American
cross-fertilization in the movie and television industries, and
``for once the balance of forces works perfectly,'' wrote critic
Adam Mars-Jones in The Independent.
   Mars-Jones praised ``a screenplay full of sharpness and
unpredictability,'' while The Observer's Philip French called it
``one of the most politically sophisticated, visually imaginative
British pictures of the past decade.''
   The Hollywood blacklists resulted from the investigations of the
House Committee on Un-American Activities into alleged communist
infiltration of Hollywood in the years after World War II.
   Hollywood people blacklisted as communists or ``fellow
travellers'' _ sympathizers _ were forced out of the movie
business, or given no alternative but to name others with communist
leanings. Many careers in acting, screenwriting and directing were
destroyed. A few victims committed suicide, others worked under
pseudonyms or fled to Britain.
   The legacy of those times still haunts the industry. In
December, the Lorimar Studios changed the name of its Robert Taylor
Building after tenants complained in a petition that the late actor
testified before Congress against the so-called Hollywood 10,
writers alleged to have associated with communist organizations
during the 1930s, '40s or '50s. Taylor also was considered a
supporter of the blacklist that kept those writers from working
under their own names.
   In ``Fellow Traveller,'' Asa Kaufman, an American screenwriter,
moves to London to escape the witch hunt and earns a living writing
screenplays for a Robin Hood TV series.
   Meanwhile, back in Hollywood, redbaiting has driven actor
Clifford Byrne, Kaufman's best friend, to suicide. Woven into the
story is the role of Dr. Leavy, a Hollywood psychotherapist and
communist sympathizer whose motivation is critical to the film's
denouement.
   Kaufman is played by Ron Silver, Byrne by Hart Bochner and Leavy
by Daniel J. Travanti.
   Kaufman's Robin Hood screenplays become the ironic counterpoint
to his predicament, while flashbacks cleverly juxtapose the glamour
and sunshine of Hollywood with rainy Britain, its postwar austerity
and the early days of its commercial television.
   The film is loosely based on true incidents. Eaton used Victor
A. Navasky's book, ``Naming Names,'' for background. Kaufman's
story somewhat parallels that of Ring Lardner Jr., who wrote over
40 episodes of ``Robin Hood'' for Britain's Independent Television
network between 1954 and 1960. The Byrne character is reminiscent
of John Garfield, who died at 39 of a heart attack some thought may
have been brought on by pressure from the blacklisters.
   The Hollywood witch hunts are an episode rarely tackled head-on
by American moviemakers. Only in 1976 did a major movie on the
subject emerge _ Martin Ritt's ``The Front,'' starring Zero Mostel
and Woody Allen. In 1986 came Peter Yates's ``The House on Carroll
Street,'' with Kelly McGillis. Both films were written by blacklist
victim Walter Bernstein.
   ``Most of what you find tend to be allegories of giant ants
invading Los Angeles,'' said Eaton, pulpy science fiction movies
which only in retrospect came to be seen as veiled treatments of
anti-communist hysteria.
   ``Other films dealt with the situation and problem in America
from an American point of view,'' said the movie's British
director, Philip Saville.
   ``Fellow Traveller'' is about a man who runs away from his
country rather than face his predicament and drop his friends, said
Saville, who studied at Columbia University in New York in 1955-56.
   Saville and Eaton are teaming up for a second film, set against
the background of contemporary Hollywood moviemaking.
