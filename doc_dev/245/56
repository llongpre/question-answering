   Cheryl Ladd doesn't think an actor could ask
for anything more than the conditions for filming ABC's ``Jekyll &amp;
Hyde'' on location in London and Oxford.
   She plays Sara, the woman Dr. Henry Jekyll loves and the woman
John Hyde craves. Michael Caine plays the dual role of good and
evil.
   ``It's one of those wonderful roles that as soon as you go to
work you become that character,'' said Ladd. ``You have authentic
locales, hair styles and costumes. The clothes, by the way, are
excruciatingly uncomfortable.''
   Although set in Victorian England, the movie has a theme as
contemporary as today's headlines. Jekyll was a man who believed
that drugs could alter the way men think and act, for the
betterment of mankind, and ease the pains of mind and body. The
drugs, however, create his evil alter ego, Mr. Hyde.
   The two-hour movie, which ABC telecasts on Sunday, is based
loosely on Robert Louis Stevenson's classic story ``The Strange
Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.'' The story's been portrayed many
times on the screen, including Fredric March's Oscar-winning
version in 1932. It's also inspired such spinoffs as Jerry Lewis'
``The Nutty Professor'' and television's ``The Incredible Hulk.''
Most recently, Anthony Andrews was in a one-hour drama on Showtime.
   David Wickes is the writer and director of the current version.
Caine also starred in the recent ``Jack the Ripper,'' which Wickes
produced, directed and co-wrote.
   ``There was no woman to speak of in Stevenson's story, so the
love interest was created,'' said Ladd. ``Sara's sister had been
married to Jekyll, but died five years earlier. Her father, the
most pre-eminent medical mind of the day, blames Jekyll for her
death because of his experimentation with drugs.
   ``So, I'm sort of caught between that rivalry. I try to maintain
my loyalties to my father and keep my relationship with Jekyll.
Although she's married she has a very public affair with Jekyll. My
husband is a military officer in the South Pacific and I'm packing
to join him when all hell breaks loose.''
   Ladd said Caine's transformation from Jekyll to Hyde is shown on
the screen by means of stunning special effects.
   ``You watch him change, and when he becomes Hyde you'd never
know it was Michael,'' she said.
   Ladd, probably best known for ``Charlie's Angels,'' is the only
American in the cast. She plays the role with a British accent.
   ``We were filming one day in a building being used as a
restaurant,'' she said. ``There were 50 or 60 people in the crew.
People were in and out and security wasn't very tight. All day long
between scenes Michael and I posed for press photographers and
talked to reporters.
   ``At one point a girl rushes in and says, `The photographer's
waiting.' We go down the hall and pose for pictures for about 10
minutes. Finally, we learned he was a tourist who had wandered in
off the street.''
   Ladd said it was sometimes difficult to keep a straight face
during the filming.
   ``Michael is probably one of the most innately funny people I've
ever known,'' she said. ``He doesn't tell jokes. He just has funny
ways of speaking. But I got him sometimes. Once when he was in
complete makeup as Hyde and about to rape Sara, I said, `How about
a little foreplay?' He got the giggles so bad he nearly ruined his
makeup.''
   Ladd will also be seen in the spring in the feature motion
picture ``Lisa.'' Staci Keanan of ``My Two Dads'' stars as Lisa and
Ladd's daughter in this thriller.
   She was due to begin work on an NBC movie called ``The Face of
Love.'' She plays a mother who learns her husband has a daughter
from the Vietnam War when she comes to live with them.
   She and John Ritter are also developing a remake of ``Our Man
Godfrey'' as a TV movie.
   ``We'll play against type,'' Ladd said. ``I'll be flamboyant and
John will be restrained. I get to play this wacko character that
I've never played before.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   BACK TO ABC _ Ed Weinberger, creator of ``Taxi'' and ``The Cosby
Show,'' has two new half-hour comedies for ABC. One show is based
on the hit theatrical movie ``Look Who's Talking'' and the other is
called ``Honor Bound.'' The former focuses on a young, single
mother searching for the right man and on her infant child whose
thoughts are spoken to the audience. ``Honor Bound'' is about a
young, Brooklyn-born Italian-American who must put aside his
womanizing and preoccupation with the fast buck to fulfill a
deathbed promise to his father to run the family grocery and become
head of the household.
