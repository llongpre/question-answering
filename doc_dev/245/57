   Almost everybody had an opinion _ usually a
vehement one _ about the ``Baby M'' case, in which Mary Beth
Whitehead-Gould reneged on her promise to give William and
Elizabeth Stern the baby she bore as a surrogate mother.
   The case was decided only last year, and it's already a
made-for-television movie, airing Sunday and Monday on ABC. The
four-hour ``docudrama'' is based on court transcripts and published
accounts of the landmark case and is remarkably fair-minded,
considering the emotionally volatile subject. It was written and
directed by James Sadwith (``Bluffing It'').
   JoBeth Williams is perfect as Mary Beth, a New Jersey mother of
two married to a garbage collector. Rick Whitehead is played as a
sturdy, loyal, salt-of-the-earth type by Bruce Weitz.
   When Mary Beth decides, seemingly selflessly, that she'd like to
help an infertile couple, she is introduced to the well-educated,
well-off Sterns _ he a biochemist, played by John Shea; she a
pediatrician, played by Robin Strasser.
   For those familiar with the case, it may be difficult to watch
the two couples waltzing merrily into what will become an
unbearable situation. At one point, the Sterns are offered the
opportunity to remain anonymous, but they insist on meeting Mary
Beth, and they even socialize with the Whiteheads.
   If the miniseries falls to one side or the other, it is to Mary
Beth's, especially in the first half when she screams all night for
the child she has been forced to give away.
   William Stern, who frequently whines that he has ``no one,''
must rely for sympathy on Shea's portrayal, and it works, because
no one could despise those cocker spaniel eyes. But the movie does
show Stern to be caring enough to give the baby back _ temporarily,
he believes _ when Mary Beth appears so distraught he thinks she
might commit suicide. For her part, Elizabeth Stern comes off every
bit the ``ice princess'' Mary Beth calls her.
   Mary Beth drags her husband and the couple's two children along
on her emotional roller coaster. She and Rick flee in a vain effort
to keep the baby Mary Beth has named Sara. The filmmakers set some
scenes to the Starship song, ``Sara'': ``Sara, Sara, storms are
brewin' in your eyes. Sara, Sara, no time is a good time for
good-bye ...''
   The Sterns go to court to get the baby back. The judge seals the
case ``to shield the child from publicity and notoriety.'' Little
did he know it would become a network miniseries.
   Mary Beth finally calls Bill Stern from the road and says she
wants to resolve the situation, but she also threatens to kill
herself and the baby. Stern, unbeknown to her, is taping the call,
and it will become a bombshell in the trial to come.
   The pawn in all of this is, of course, the infant, andthe film
makes that point in one poignant scene as Rick and a sheriff's
deputy grapple for the child as the camera captures her terrified
expression.
   The second half of the movie is taken up with the court battle.
In one of the odd bit parts he seems to like, Dabney Coleman plays
the Sterns' lawyer. Anne Jackson has a small part, too, as the
attorney appointed to represent the child.
   At the trial, Mary Beth's duplicity and instability are
revealed, and Betsy Stern, it is learned, is not infertile, though
she faced the risk of aggravating her multiple sclerosis if she
became pregnant.
   Stern makes some vague protests about ``father's rights.'' But
it is Mary Beth's lawyer, played by Bruce McGill, who gets the big
speech:
   ``I tell this court,'' he says, ``there is nothing more
fundamentally repugnant than to permit a man to have one woman to
share his life and another to experience the sacrifice and pain of
pregnancy and a lifetime of suffering as a result of separation
from her child. It will always be the wife of the sanitation worker
who will bear children for the pediatrician.''
   The movie ends with the judge giving custody of Baby M to the
Sterns. A scroll updates with the results of the appeal: the New
Jersey Supreme Court ruled the surrogacy contract illegal. The
Sterns have custody of the baby they named Melissa, but Mary Beth,
now married to another man and mother of their newborn son, has
visitation rights.
   The big question has always been how Melissa Stern will feel
about all this when she's old enough to understand it. It's a
tribute to Sadwith and crew that this movie would give her a pretty
good idea of how adults' good intentions can go wrong _ and how
much they all loved a baby girl.
