School officials are considering disciplinary action against a teacher who 
showed an edited version of "Quest for Fire," an R-rated caveman movie with sex 
and cannibalism scenes, to a seventh-grade social studies class. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Valley Unified School District learned of the screening at the 
Sequoia Intermediate School after parents complained, a school official said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 movie was not approved by a district committee that normally reviews 
all sex education films, said Richard Simpson, an assistant superintendent for 
instructional services. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said it should have been submitted to that committee because of scenes 
revealing nudity, even though it was not intended as a sex education film. He 
also said parents should have been told that the film would be shown. 
</P>
<P>
The film apparently was shown in connection with lessons on history and social 
science. 
</P>
<P>
The scenes in the edited version shown to the classroom included "scenes of 
violence. There are scenes that suggest cannibalism. There are scenes that 
suggest sexual activity," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials will decide what action to take against the teacher next 
week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the incident is a personnel matter, Simpson declined to name the 
teacher. But parents identified him as Clint Dillon, a social studies 
instructor who has been at the school for two years. Dillon declined to be 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Two teachers showed a different, edited-for-television version of the film to 
two 10th-grade world history classes at Newbury Park High School, Principal 
Charles Eklund said. 
</P>
<P>
"Quest for Fire" was directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud and stars actors Ron 
Perlman and Rae Dawn Chong as prehistoric lovers. Movie critics lauded the 
French-Canadian film for its special effects, calling it one of the most 
realistic portrayals of a caveman and his search for fire. 
</P>
<P>
But the special effects disturbed parents of Sequoia school children, eight of 
whom complained to the school district, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Muse, 37, whose 12-year-old daughter Danielle saw the movie along with a 
class of about 30, said she was shocked by her daughter's graphic description 
of dismemberment, violence and nudity. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this man and this woman and they were naked and tied up and hanging 
upside down. The man's arm was ripped off and a group of cannibals was eating 
his arm," Muse said. "When she came home, she was sick to her stomach. This 
movie really bothered her." 
</P>
<P>
Other parents told Muse that their children also described the film as 
sickening, and one child had nightmares of cannibals, Muse said.
