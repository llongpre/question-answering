When Inette Miller sold the film and television rights to her book, "Burning 
Bridges," to Lorimar-Telepictures, the contract -- like most book-to-film deals 
negotiated in Hollywood -- stated that besides money, Miller would receive an 
on-screen credit reading "Based on the book by Inette Miller." 
</P>
<P>
But when "Burning Bridges" airs on ABC Sunday, Miller's name will be nowhere in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the only writing credit will go to executive producer Judith Paige 
Mitchell, who adapted Miller's book for television. No mention will be made in 
the film nor in publicity material that the screenplay came from a book. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Lorimar nor ABC would comment on why Miller's name has been omitted. 
But Miller's attorney, Carol Rinzler, said that Lorimar claims to fear legal 
action from a woman upon whom one of the characters is based. A source close to 
the project confirmed that fear. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's case -- perhaps the first of this sort, according to agents and 
attorneys interviewed -- is an example of the effect that an increasingly 
litigious society is having on the increasingly corporate world of network 
television. 
</P>
<P>
It raises questions about privacy versus freedom of expression, and of whether 
simply removing the author's name will really protect the producers should the 
woman sue. 
</P>
<P>
"Burning Bridges" chronicles the mid-life crisis and accompanying love affairs 
of a woman, played in the movie by Meredith Baxter-Birney and based on Miller's 
own experience. According to Rinzler, the book was based on fact, but the 
characters' identities were disguised. 
</P>
<P>
When Lorimar bought the rights, the company asked for and received releases 
from the people on whom the major characters in the book are based, Rinzler 
said. The studio did not ask for a release from the woman whom it now fears 
might sue, she said. The character -- the wife of a man who has an affair with 
the main character -- only appears in two scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement provided for the usual credit," Rinzler said. "There was very 
vague language which said they did not have to give her credit if there were 
legal problems, whatever that means. And they informed her a couple of weeks 
ago that they were not going to give her credit." 
</P>
<P>
Miller filed suit March 29 against Lorimar, asking that her name be put back in 
the credits or that she be paid at least $25,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The studio has never denied that the film was based on the book -- indeed, ABC 
sent out press releases trumpeting that fact when Baxter-Birney was signed for 
the lead role a few months ago. "The picture is absolutely based on the book," 
said a source involved with the project. 
</P>
<P>
But the source said that Lorimar's legal department is convinced that the 
studio would be better protected against lawsuits if Miller's name and the 
reference to her book are left off. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a continual battle," said Edward Rubin, professor of law and associate 
dean at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall. "Credit, along with money, are the two 
fighting issues in entertainment law." 
</P>
<P>
The struggle, Rubin said, is between the rights of an author and the fear that 
corporations have of being sued. It is compounded, he said, because most 
studios today have special insurance to pay for invasion-of-privacy suits, and 
the insurers are extremely conservative about what they will allow. 
</P>
<P>
The result, he said, is what legal scholars call a "chilling effect" on art and 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is that a book like this, which is clearly legal and would win in 
any lawsuit, falls victim to this conservatism," Rubin said. "The chill comes 
because the producer is risk-averse. They prefer not to take a chance." 
</P>
<P>
By taking Miller's name off the credits, experts said, Lorimar might be trying 
to further disguise the real identities of the characters, whose friends and 
neighbors might know the name of Miller as someone who wrote a book about their 
town. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Rubin and others, that wouldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"Either what she's saying is libelous or it isn't," said Irving (Swifty) Lazar, 
a leading Hollywood agent who works with a number of prominent authors. "If 
they think it's libelous, why would they (make the movie) in the first place? 
If it's not, why are they keeping her name off?" 
</P>
<P>
"The networks are especially careful because there have been so many lawsuits," 
said literary agent Todd Harris, who is known for selling film rights to books. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, he has never seen a case like Miller's. 
</P>
<P>
"I've sold over 150 books in the past year, and I've run into just about 
everything. This is a new one on me." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, privacy cases are very difficult to win. Unless the portrayal of 
a person is particularly negative or deliberately falsified, the courts have 
tended to side with the author. 
</P>
<P>
A plaintiff in a privacy suit must first prove that someone watching the movie 
would know that the character in question is based on the plaintiff. Then, he 
or she would have to prove that the portrayal is false or destructive. 
</P>
<P>
But sources at the networks said that even winning such suits costs time and 
money -- and could bring increases in insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
"What the lawyers are trying to do is prevent you from getting in trouble," 
said Geoffrey Cowan, who teaches mass communications law at UCLA. "And if you 
are already in up to your ankles, they're going to try to keep you from getting 
in up to your knees." 
</P>
<P>
For authors, the result is often an attempt by the network or studio to 
extricate itself from all responsibility in the event of a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"In a book publishing contract, the single most difficult clauses to alter in 
any way are the warrantee clause and the indemnification clause. Publishers do 
not want to change those clauses," said agent Eric Lasher. "And in those 
(clauses) the author warrants that everything they've written is true and they 
indemnify the publisher." 
</P>
<P>
But to Miller, the issue is not abstract legal theory, but an intensely 
personal loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel raped," she said. "It's immoral -- you don't take somebody's work and 
not credit them. 
</P>
<P>
Getting credit, Miller said, means being able to negotiate better deals in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"Your credit is your reputation," said UC Berkeley's Rubin. "The size and time 
your name appears on the screen is the only thing linking you to the product 
and the only way you can get jobs in the future."
