   Playing fictional police roles on television
is one thing, but there's an added responsibility in portraying a
real-life detective, says actor A Martinez who stars in NBC's
``Manhunt: Search for the Night Stalker.''
   Martinez, who was born Adolph but shortened his name to A,
appears in the movie about the killer who terrorized California
between March and August 1985. He plays Gil Carrillo, a detective
for the Los Angeles County sheriff's department. Richard Jordan is
Frank Salerno, another detective.
   ``I've played other cops on `Police Story' and on `The Whiz
Kids,''' said Martinez. ``It's just different when it's someone you
get to meet and form opinions of. It puts a responsibility on you.
It's difficult to uphold when the piece is not a character study.
   ``I found myself wishing I could expand on a scene so I could
show more of the man.''
   ``Manhunt: Search for the Night Stalker'' will be telecast
Sunday. It ends with the arrest of Richard Ramirez, who was
convicted on Sept. 20 of 13 murders, five attempted murders, 11
sexual assaults and 14 burglaries. The jury's recommendation he be
sent to the gas chamber was affirmed by the trial judge Tuesday.
   ``It's really the story of the investigation,'' said Martinez,
who also has a starring role on NBC's ``Santa Barbara.''
   Martinez said he developed a great respect and admiration for
Carrillo. ``He's remarkable because he remains warm-hearted in a
de-humanizing job where he is constantly in the face of human
behavior at its worse,'' he said. ``It's difficult to imagine myself
handling such a challenge so gracefully.
   ``My favorite part of the picture was when I could show Gil's
personal life and his family. He was a victim, too, because he was
separated from his family. I sense a lot of pain in him over that.
It's fascinating the way he bears it.''
   Martinez, who has two children, said in particular he identified
with Carrillo's empathy for children.
   ``The Night Stalker harmed a lot of children, directly or
indirectly,'' he said. ``That aspect stood out in bold relief.''
   Martinez was interviewed in his dressing room for ``Santa
Barbara,'' which he joined within a week of its debut in 1984. He
plays Cruz Castillo, a private detective.
   ``Cruz Castillo is the hero, who's in love with a woman from the
other side of the tracks,'' he said. The character was recently
married to the soap opera's heroine from a wealthy family, Eden
Capwell, who is played by Marcy Walker.
   Martinez took off four weeks from ``Santa Barbara'' to work on
the Night Stalker movie. During that period, however, he still
managed to appear in 10 episodes.
   ``An hour show five days a week is an intensive grind,'' said
Martinez, who appears in almost every show. ``It's a small cast so
the core people tend to work a lot. Even being away for a weekend
tends to upset the rhythm of the show. Sometimes the fatigue is your
ally because you don't have the excess energy to get nervous.''
   He also co-stars with Meryl Streep, Roseanne Barr and Ed Begley
Jr. in the feature film ``She Devil.'' He plays Streep's gigolo
lover. While on location in Port Jefferson, N.Y., his wife, Leslie
Bryans, gave birth to their daughter, Devon. They also have a son,
Dakota Lee, called Cody.
   Martinez, the son of a school principal, grew up in Los Angeles
as the third generation Adolph Martinez. As a child he was known as
``Little A'' and ``A-Bone.'' The name was later shortened to A.
   He got into acting while at UCLA. He made his professional debut
in the movie ``Born Wild'' and had roles in other films. He was a
regular in such series as ``Cassie &amp; Co.'' and ``The Whiz Kids.''
   ``The bulk of my work has been in Hispanic or Native American
roles,'' he said. ``But within that I've played characters from
professionals to illiterates. It's a privilege to make your living
as an artist.
   ``Now that I'm a father my desire for cinematic grandeur has
washed away. The irony is that for years I was afraid to have kids
because I was afraid it would be an albatross around my neck. It's
amazing that the thing you feared is what liberates you.''

      Elsewhere in television:
   IN DEEP WATER _ Larry and Balki will be up to their necks in a
flooded basement on ABC's ``Perfect Strangers'' when the Esther
Williams swimming tank at the former MGM Studios, now the Lorimar
Studios, is put to use. The tank was used in `` 2010'' and ``Jaws''
as well. The tank was built in 1944 for Williams' underwater movies.
It's 20 feet deep and an entire set can be put on the bottom and
flooded. Mark Linn-Baker (Larry) and Bronson Pinchot (Balki) will
get trapped in the flooded basement.
