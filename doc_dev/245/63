   The government will allow an American movie
producer to make a film in Poland about Solidarity founder Lech
Walesa, the Polish news agency PAP reported Monday.
   A brief announcement said a state-owned studio would provide
technical help for producer Stanley Kramer.
   PAP said the Wroclaw Film Studio would work with Kramer on the
movie ``Polonaise,'' especially on creating crowd scenes, including
ones requiring 25,000 extras portraying Solidarity's birth as an
independent trade union at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk in August
1980.
   It was not clear from the announcement if filming would take
place in the Lenin shipyard, where Walesa is still employed as an
electrician, or at some other shipyard.
   Kramer said Monday in Hollywood he had not received word that
filming in Gdansk was approved. He said he was approached last month
at a Los Angeles gathering by represenatives of Poland's official
film agency and they offered to let him shoot portions of the movie
at the Lenin yard.
   ``They came and had read the script and realized what it's about
and they were interested, whether because of the new government or
the whole glasnost thing or whatever,'' Kramer said.
   He referred to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or greater openness in certain areas, which is being
copied by some of the Kremlin's allies, and recent changes in
Poland's government.
   Filming is expected to begin in several months on the movie
tracing the life of Walesa, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize as a
founder of the first free union movement in the Soviet bloc.
Solidarity was suspended in December 1981 and later outlawed by
Parliament.
   Kramer said the film should be released in spring 1990.
   He said he visited Walesa in Poland last year but never sought
permission to shoot the movie in this communist country because he
assumed he would be turned down.
   ``After all, it was about Walesa,'' Kramer said. ``He was at
loggerheads with the government at the time.''
   Solidarity is still banned, but after years of trying to
eradicate the movment the government reversed its stand and is
conducting talks with the opposition that could lead to a
restoration of Solidarity's legal status and other reforms.
   Kramer said the film is expected to cost up to $15 million. He
said it would be historically accurate but will dramatize some
details, such as wedding-night conversations between Walesa and his
wife.
   ``It isn't political, it's a story, a drama of a hero, a hero who
had certain shortcomings and realized them,'' Kramer said. ``Winning
the Nobel prize is a symbol one man can make a difference and that's
the message of the film, not politics.''
   ``Polonaise,'' named for one of the works of the Polish composer
Chopin, follows other films on social issues by the 74-year-old
Kramer. They include ``Judgment at Nuremberg'' and ``Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner.''
   While Solidarity's story is mainly one of struggle against the
communist government, Kramer said the film does not portray the
authorities as villains.
   ``They don't look too bad for the simple reason that they didn't
look too bad during the real thing,'' he said. ``Even though he
(Walesa) was taken into custody a number of times, they couldn't do
anything to him because he was untouchable.''
   The screenplay was written by Daniel Taradash, who won an Academy
Award in 1953 for the screenplay of ``From Here to Eternity.''
   Film Polski, the official agency, will be paid to arrange for the
filming in Gdansk but will not have a role in writing or producing
the move and will not share in the profits, Kramer said.
