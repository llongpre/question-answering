"Romero" (at the AMC Century 14) has the good fortune to have Raul Julia in the 
title role as the martyred Salvadoran archbishop, but his solid portrayal, a 
work of simplicity and concentration, cannot redeem a film that in too many 
crucial ways goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Romero" is an especially poignant example of noble intention done in by 
misguided means, for Julia invests the archbishop with a spirituality that few 
heroes of conventional films with religious themes possess. 
</P>
<P>
Much to his surprise, mild-mannered Monsignor Oscar Romero in 1977 is named 
Archbishop of San Salvador. Some of his colleagues, who identify with the 
country's ultra-conservative ruling class, predict that he will not make waves 
despite the rapidly escalating oppression and brutality of the new Humberto 
regime. The mindless savagery unleashed by the military on the helpless and the 
innocent is too much for Romero to ignore. Drawing upon his faith as a devout 
man of God, he gradually emerges as an implacable leader of the opposition, 
having decided that God's law must transcend that of man. 
</P>
<P>
Writer John Sacret Young and Australian director John Duigan, in his American 
film debut, sketch the outlines of Romero's fate and its implications for the 
relationship between church and state clearly enough, but with breadth rather 
than depth. Although the film does unfold with the requisite sense of tragic 
inevitability, thanks to Julia, nothing else about it rings true, even though 
what is depicted is depressingly credible, drawn as it is from recent, terrible 
(and ongoing) events. 
</P>
<P>
The sad truth is that the film is trite in its dialogue as well as in its 
direction and is seriously marred by the disastrous miscasting of a key role. 
Underlying all these flaws is the pervading sense that the film, cursed with 
the synthetic quality that typically characterizes productions with 
international casts and crews, really has no business being in English in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
This feeling is reinforced by the fact that the film doesn't deal with the role 
of the American government in El Salvador's plight, beyond a plea from Romero 
for us to stop sending arms that will be only used against his country's 
people. The role of the Vatican in El Salvador is soft-pedaled even more. 
Cultural imperialism, in the form of materialistic U.S. values and life styles, 
is noted only in passing, and there's no addressing at all of why Latin 
American political struggles always seem to involve such extreme acts of 
cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
One has to wonder why its producer, Paulist priest Father Ellwood E. Kieser, 
didn't let us experience a Salvadoran film maker's vision of the country's 
seemingly unending tragedy. Surely the audience that is concerned enough with 
Central America to be attracted to Romero's story is sufficiently sophisticated 
to sit still for subtitles. Surely, too, the film would be more appealing to 
Latino audiences were it in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Again excepting Julia, the actors are pedestrian or worse. As a fiery activist 
priest called Father Rutilio Grande, Richard Jordan looks about as Latino as 
Robert Redford; it's no help that his Spanish accent is so erratic. The dozens 
of native extras -- the film was shot in Mexico -- are terribly self-conscious 
and often seemingly perplexed. Clearly, Duigan, one of the least-known and most 
gifted of Australian directors, is way out of his element. Such wonderful films 
as "Mouth to Mouth," "The Winter of Our Dreams" and "The Year My Voice Broke" 
show him to be a master of the intimate rather than the epic, and his usual 
rapport with actors fails him here, except with Julia. 
</P>
<P>
Julia, who brings more to Romero than the script does, seems to draw strength 
and inspiration from the very solitary man he is portraying. "Romero" (rated 
PG-13 for violence and bloodshed) is of greatest interest as a study of a 
skilled professional actor going about his business no matter what. When you 
should be experiencing a sense of universality in the plight of Archbishop 
Romero, you may instead find yourself being impressed with Julia's ability to 
bring passion and meaning to cliches.
