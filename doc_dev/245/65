   Actor Matt Dillon says he spent time with drug
addicts and bought a hypodermic needle on the street to prepare for
his role as a junkie in the movie ``Drugstore Cowboy.''
   ``All that research was definitely helpful,'' Dillon said.
   Dillon, 25, said he went with a friend, a recovering drug
addict, to a lower Manhattan park to buy ``works,'' an illicit drug
kit that included the needle.
   In the movie, which opens Friday, Dillon plays a junkie who robs
pharmacies to feed his drug habit.
   Observing addicts to learn their mannerisms, outlook and
motivation was natural for an actor who considers himself a student
of society.
   ``I don't live in exile. I'm not an absolute recluse,'' he said.
``I live my life. I like to go out. You have to keep in touch with
life around you. You have to observe things.''

   National GOP Chairman Lee Atwater is still
invited to the Memphis Blues Foundation's annual awards program,
but he won't be a co-host because the group doesn't want the show
to be politicized.
   ``We just want to remain apolitical and keep our focus on
music,'' David Simmons, a vice president of the foundation, said
Wednesday.
   Atwater, who plays guitar, and bluesman B.B. King had been
scheduled to be hosts of the Nov. 5 show at Memphis' Cook
Convention Center, but King will be touring overseas with the rock
group U2, Simmons said.
   Filling in for them will be Willie Dixon, a producer, arranger
and writer who set up one of the first tours of American blues
musicians to Europe in the 1960s. Awards will be given in 22
categories for contemporary and traditional blues.
   Bruce Iglauer, head of Alligator Records, said Atwater has
spoken about the need for preserving American blues but having him
as a host for the awards program would be improper.
   ``He's done some good things for the music, but he's a
politician,'' Iglauer said.

   The producer of Pat Sajak's late-night
television show has resigned as it slips in the ratings battle with
the hip, syndicated ``Arsenio Hall Show.''
   Paul Gilbert, who came to ``Sajak'' from the host's other
television show, ``Wheel of Fortune,'' will stay on until a
replacement is named, CBS spokeswoman Terry Soreco said Wednesday.
   CBS' vice president in charge of late-night programming will
select a new producer. Soreco said changes in the show could be
expected to follow.

   Francis Ford Coppola will revive ``The
Godfather'' for a third act next month as he begins filming in
Italy with returning stars Al Pacino and Diane Keaton and newcomers
including Eli Wallach.
   ``We hope to do something in the tradition of the others,''
Coppola told Daily Variety in Wednesday's editions. ``If all three
were put together, we would like to feel they're all part of one
`Godfather' project.''
   Paramount's ``The Godfather _ The Continuing Story'' starts
filming in Rome on Nov. 15 from a script written by Coppola and
Mario Puzo, who first chronicled the Corleone saga in the
best-selling novel ``The Godfather.''
   Pacino, nominated twice for Academy Awards in the previous two
films, will return as the powerful underworld don Michael Corleone
and Keaton will play his ex-wife. Talia Shire, Coppola's sister,
will reprise her role as sister Connie Corleone.
   New faces include Wallach as a friend of the late Don Corleone
and Andy Garcia, who will portray an illegitimate Corleone son.
   The original ``Godfather'' was released in 1972; the sequel two
years later garnered 16 Oscar nominations. Each won the coveted
best picture Oscar. The two movies have grossed more than $700
million.

   Actress Melanie Griffith was reported doing
well after giving birth to a baby girl with husband Don Johnson
present, a publicist said.
   The girl, named Dakota, was born Wednesday in Austin, Texas,
where Johnson is filming the Dennis Hopper-directed movie ``Hot
Spot,'' publicist Elliott Mintz said.
   ``Mother and baby are fine,'' she said.
   Johnson, 39, star of the long-running TV series ``Miami Vice,''
married Miss Griffith, 31, for the second time last June. They each
have a young son from other relationships.

   A judge has reset the count for heavyweight
champion Mike Tyson, giving him two extra days to fulfill a
community-service sentence for a speeding conviction.
   Judge Stephen Safranko agreed Wednesday to let Tyson appear at
three youth clinics on Monday, two days after the deadline he had
set in sentencing the fighter. Tyson was ordered to appear at the
clinics and pay a $300 fine after pleading guilty to two speeding
incidents.
   ``It was a matter of substance over form,'' Safranko said,
explaining the extension. ``The idea is to get it done and have
something positive come out of it.''
   Under the revised agreement between Safranko and defense
attorney John Hicks, Tyson will be featured at a boxing clinic at a
youth center Monday morning, and then give two drug-related talks
at a community center.
   Tyson, who is training for a Nov. 18 title defense against Razor
Ruddock in Edmonton, Alberta, will face resentencing if he does not
perform at the clinics on Monday, Safranko said.
