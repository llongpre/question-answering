   Playing a good guy is something new for actor
John Mahoney, who has been in a veritable movie whirlwind for the
last year.
   The actor has turned up as the sinister judge in ``Suspect,''
the drink-splashed teacher in ``Moonstruck,'' a bumbling United
States consul in ``Frantic'' and a white supremacist farmer in
``Betrayal.''
   Now, he is Kid Gleason, the manager of the Chicago Black Sox, in
John Sayles' new movie, ``Eight Men Out.''
   ``He's a very decent man, and I haven't got to play too many of
those,'' noted the Chicago-based actor.
   Mahoney said he isn't certain why he often is cast as an
unsavory character, but thinks it may have something to do with the
role that first brought him to attention in the East.
   His New York stage debut was in ``Orphans,'' in a role that
Albert Finney later portrayed in the film version: ``A man you
could believe could smack you in two if he wanted to, but he was
also a very loving person.''
   After filming ``Eight Men Out,'' Mahoney is back to his old
tricks: playing a father who tries to break up his daughter's
romance in a movie called ``Say Anything,'' and ``a rotten, slimy
character'' in a mini-series called ``Favorite Son.''
