   The actors portraying the terror aboard an
airliner hijacked to Lebanon sometimes used jokes to get through
the tense, emotional scenes, says Lindsay Wagner, who stars as
courageous flight attendant Uli Derickson.
   ``There are moments of humor,'' said Wagner of the NBC movie,
``The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story.'' NBC will
televise the two-hour movie Monday.
   ``It was the only way to survive aboard the plane. And when we
did the heavy scenes, we'd break up trying to get through it. The
emotions would become so overpowering you had to have relief.''
   To an extent, she said, that was also one way the real-life
hostages aboard the TWA jet coped with fear after two terrorists
seized the plane June 17, 1985, on a flight from Athens to Rome.
   It was Derickson who emerged as a heroine during the hijacking,
in which the plane was diverted to Beirut, flew to Algiers, then
returned to Beirut. She helped get some passengers released and
attempted to conceal the identities of the Jewish passengers.
   One passenger, a young Navy frogman named Robert Stethem, was
beaten then shot to death by the terrorists. The other passengers
and crew were eventually released. Derickson was among those
released early.
   ``She was very human,'' said Wagner. ``She ended up doing some
extraordinary things. There were times when she was crying and her
hands were shaking, but she didn't freeze up. She pushed through
her emotions. One terrorist made her sing `Patty Cake' in German,
then proposed marriage to her.''
   Most of the movie was filmed in a mockup of the airplane's
cabin, a small and cramped space.
   ``They were never allowed off the plane,'' she said. ``We shot a
few scenes at Los Angeles International Airport, including one
where we had to use the emergency chute exit. The entire fire
department at the airport came and watched. They'd never seen one
used before.
   ``We sometimes lost track of where we were, Algiers or Beirut.
We filmed mostly in that little space. You don't realize how much
you're influenced by visual stimuli. We kept asking ourselves,
`Where are we now? Algiers or Beirut?'''
   Derickson, who is still flying with TWA, was a consultant for
the film.
   ``I asked her things like what it was like moment to moment,''
said Wagner. ``She was on the set if I had any questions. (For)
some things you can simply use your own instinct, but when you had
a choice I wanted her input. She also relayed some of the little
anecdotes. She was very good in helping me create moments.
   ``She passed out aspirin to the passengers to keep their body
temperatures down. The air conditioning was off and the plane was
very hot in the desert sun. She told me she thought she was doing a
good job looking cool when a woman grabbed her arm and said, `I
think you should take some too, dear.'''
   Wagner is best known for ``The Bionic Woman,'' which ran on ABC
from 1976 to 1978. She and Lee Majors, who was ``The Six Million
Dollar Man,'' made a reunion movie last year for NBC. Her last
series, ``Jessie,'' lasted only briefly in 1984.
   She said she'd consider doing another series, if it's a
half-hour comedy.
   ``I don't want to do another hour show,'' she said. ``We haven't
been able to come up with the right property yet. Usually, you have
too much. That's been one of the ironies of my career.''
   Wagner was also in the miniseries ``Scruples'' and ``Princess
Daisy.'' Her theatrical films include ``The Paper Chase'' and
``High Risk,'' a caper movie that has become something of a cult
classic.
