   Eric Roberts says he first saw the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial at daybreak as he re-created the story of how the
wall became a reality in the NBC movie ``To Heal a Nation.''
   ``I'd never seen it before and I got there just as the sun came
up,'' said Roberts. ``I was the first person that day to walk its
length. Halfway, I saw my reflection. I narrowed my focus to just
one name.
   ``The wall became very dear to me. It has the names of
50,000-plus boys who died serving our country, for better or worse.
I was devastated and very proud to portray the man responsible for
the fact that it was standing there.''
   Roberts plays Jan Scruggs, the former Army infantryman who led
the effort to build a memorial to his fellow veterans in hopes of
healing the nation's wounds. Working with Scruggs were Robert
Doubek and John Wheeler.
   The memorial, 493 feet of black granite set into the ground in a
giant V, polished to a mirror-like finish and inscribed with 58,156
names, was designed by Maya Ying Lin, a New York architect who was
a 21-year-old Yale architectural student when her dramatic vision
was selected from among 1,421 entries. It attracts up to 20,000
visitors a day, making it the most-visited memorial in Washington,
D.C.
   The two-hour movie, a special GE Theater presentation based on a
book by Scruggs and Joel L. Swerdlow, will be televised Sunday. It
also stars Glynnis O'Connor, Marshall Colt, Scott Paulin, Lee
Purcell, Laurence Luckinbill, Linden Chiles, Brock Peters and
Gloria Carlin. Lionel Chetwynd wrote the screenplay, and Michael
Pressman directed.
   Roberts said when he started the film he looked into Scruggs'
military record and talked to people who knew him.
   ``I held off meeting him until I was halfway through the
picture,'' he said. ``He is an incredibly decent man. My belief is
he pursued the Vietnam Memorial for all the right reasons. I admire
him and I'm proud to portray him.
   ``He had no illusions of grandeur. One of my favorite lines from
the film is, `This is not a monument, it's a memorial.' It's not a
memorial to the war in Vietnam. It's a memorial to the 50,000 young
men who died there.''
   Roberts said he sees Scruggs, who is now attending law school,
as ``a living definition of the American dream come true.''
   ``He wanted to get something done and he pursued it. It got done
and it will live forever. It's wonderful for everyone in this
country to pursue his own vision. It's worth it, I think.''
   This is a rare television appearance for Roberts, who was
nominated for an Oscar for his role in ``Runaway Train.'' He was
also in such movies as ``Star 80,'' ``The Pope of Greenwich
Village,'' ``Raggedy Man,'' ``Nobody's Fool'' and the upcoming
``Blood Red.'' He made his TV debut in the soap opera ``Another
World'' and has been in several PBS dramas.
   ``I don't go by the media,'' he said. ``What attracts me is the
script. I liked this and I came running. Limiting myself to one
medium is like limiting myself to redheads. I took this part
because of the script, because of my friendship with three Vietnam
veterans and because people my age were too young to be for or
against the war. Now that I'm an adult I think it's about time we
said, `Welcome home, guys.'''
   His upcoming movie, ``Blood Red,'' is a Western due out in July.
It also stars Burt Young, Dennis Hopper and Giancarlo Giannini, who
plays Roberts' father.
   ``It's loosely based on the time the railroad came to the Napa
Valley,'' he said. ``It came to this particular vineyard and the
Italian immigrant who owned it wouldn't sell a right-of-way. He
died suspiciously. I, as his son, take to the hills. He holds up
the railroad so long they go around the Napa Valley. It saved the
Napa Valley for wine growing.''
   This fall he plans to star in a movie called ``Centrifuge,''
based on a novel by J.C. Pollock.
