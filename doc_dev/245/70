   When immigrant Sam Krichinsky arrived in
Baltimore in 1914, he says at the opening of the movie ``Avalon,''
it was the most beautiful place he had ever seen.
   If audiences share Krichinsky's memory, they can thank Allen
Daviau. As the film's director of photography, Daviau was charged
with transforming director Barry Levinson's rich script into
equally evocative images.
   Perhaps no scene in ``Avalon'' reveals Daviau's artistry more
than that first scene in which Krichinsky (Armin Mueller-Stahl
portraying Levinson's grandfather as a young man) lands in Electric
Park, a 1914 exposition re-created for the film by production
designer Norman Reynolds.
   As the first reel unspools, something looks off. As Krichinsky
moves through Electric Park, decorated with 18,000 lights, his body
movements are slightly jumpy and the colors overly rich. He walks
at normal speed, and yet it is clear we are not watching his actual
arrival. It is instead Krichinsky's recollection of it.
   ``This is a very abstract, stylized, idealized memory he's
having of brilliant lights,'' said Daviau, whose cinematography won
Academy Award nominations for Steven Spielberg's ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``The Color Purple'' and ``Empire of the
Sun.''
   ``One of the things Barry said was, `We have to find a way to
distance the past sequences from the present of 1948,' '' Daviau
said. To avoid cinematic cliches, he declined to use filtration or
sepia toning.
   What Daviau (pronounced Dav'-ee-ow) did instead was film at 18
frames per second, as opposed to the standard 24 frames. He then
``stretch-printed'' the film, using every other frame twice.
   ``It's missing a third of the information that our 24-frame-per
second mind is used to seeing, and it's being restored in an
artificial way,'' Daviau said. ``We've seen stretch printing in
silent films for many, many years. The difference is, you haven't
seen it in color.''
   Daviau first used the technique making a bank commercial several
years ago. He still alternates between commercials and feature
films.
   ``It's the best mixture in the world,'' he said, ``because
commercials keep you busy, they keep you in practice, they make you
a lot of money and you meet a lot of directors who are on their way
to doing pictures.
   ``Working in commercials allows you to be choosy about what
movies you do. . . . What I was really looking to do happened when
`Avalon' came along.
   ``I really am fascinated with the '40s,'' Daviau said. ``I got
to deal with a period that I remember quite well.''
   The movie spans 50 years, detailing the lives of the
Krinchinskys - Levinson's family - and the world in which they
live.
   Daviau started as a still photographer, photo lab technician and
theatrical lighting designer. During the mid-1960s, he photographed
rock promotional films with Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin and The
Who. Other feature credits include ``The Falcon and the Snowman''
and ``Defending Your Life.'' In 1988, the American Society of
Cinematographers voted him best cinematographer in feature films.
   Levinson and Spielberg both are visual directors, Daviau said,
but have different styles.
   ``Steven is much more interested in the design of the shot; the
graphics are very, very important to him,'' Daviau said. ``Barry is
a visual director, by all means, but it's a different emphasis. He
loves the compositions.''
   The cinematographer's job is a curious one.
   ``It's really a case of choosing to make your presence known.
And you pick a look for a film and then you're out to make that
look fit,'' Daviau said.
   ``There are certain things that general audiences may notice
about photography that are not the things you do. A lot of times,
we're credited with scenery. The things we really do are things
that people rarely notice. Most of our work is lighting, color,
texture.
   ``One of the greatest things that you do in cinematography is
you guide the audiences's eye to where it should be. You're giving
emphasis where it's desired.
   ``I don't think I would ever want to be known as every film I
have looking the same or somebody saying, `Oh! Daviau did that for
sure.' I'd much rather shape the look to the individual film.''
   In ``Avalon,'' he said, certain details demanded to be examined
closely.
   ``I looked at Armin Mueller-Stahl's face and in a second I saw
those eyes. This is one of the most remarkable faces I've ever been
given to photograph.''
   For the Thanksgiving dinner scenes in ``Avalon,'' Daviau bathed
the interiors with warm, comfortable light; pouring in from outside
windows is cold, blue light.
   Near the film's end, Sam Krichinsky settles into a chair to read
a newspaper. A few seconds later, when he arises, he's aged 10
years. The framing of both shots is identical. There is no jump in
the image, even though the two scenes were done more than a week
apart. So seamless is the transition that some in the audience
don't notice for several moments that Krichinsky's grown old.
   And that, for Daviau, is photography at its best.
