   In the best-selling autobiography of test
pilot Chuck Yeager, pioneer flyer Pancho Barnes is recalled by her
colleagues as a foul-mouthed hell-raiser with a face like ``a
bucket of worms.''
   The memoir, ``Yeager,'' attributes the colorful description of
Pancho's appearance to Yeager's friend, Russ Schleeh.
   In a new TV movie about the aviator's freestyle life, ``Pancho
Barnes,'' actress Valerie Bertinelli portrays the portly adventure
seeker. But the movie's producers admit they didn't cast for
physical resemblance.
   ``This is based on her character, and the spirit of it is what
we hope to capture,'' said executive producer Blue Andre.
   It took four years of combing through letters, photos, aviation
books and other research materials before Andre was ready to film
the three-hour feature, being shot this summer entirely in Texas
with largely in-state crew, staff and actors.
   ``Pancho'' was born Florence Leontine Lowe. The granddaughter of
Thaddeus Lowe, a scientist who used hydrogen balloons for artillery
observation in the Civil War, she tossed aside her genteel rearing
and her marriage to the Rev. C. Rankin Barnes to pursue her true
love _ flying. She became one of America's top-rated female pilots
and the principal stunt pilot for many Hollywood movies.
   In 1930, she flew her Travelaire Mystery Ship at an average
speed of 196.19 mph to wrest the world's speed record for women
from Amelia Earhart.
   But Pancho Barnes was better known for the rowdy hospitality she
offered to the greatest pilots of her era at her California desert
hangout, Pancho's Fly Inn. It later became known as the Happy
Bottom Riding Club, and eventually was swallowed by the expansion
of Edwards Air Force Base.
   Her hangout forms many scenes in the critically acclaimed movie,
``The Right Stuff,'' an epic about test pilots and the nation's
early astronaut program. Barnes was portrayed in the 1983 movie by
Kim Stanley, who is somewhat Bertinelli's senior.
   Bertinelli acknowledges she doesn't look like the woman she'll
be portraying but found her to be an interesting person to play.
   ``They sent me the script and I said, `Yeah, she's a really cool
woman,''' she said. ``And then I read Chuck Yeager. God! The way he
talks about her. When I talked to Chuck Yeager, I said, `What is it
about Pancho that men loved so much?' He goes, `Uh, uh, pilots.
Pilots loved her.'''
   With at least 25 vintage aircraft that rent for an average
$5,000, and expert stunt pilots, the film's flying scenes could be
just as action-packed as Barnes' life.
   In one stunt, Charlie Hillard, a double for Bertinelli,
maneuvers a World War I Stampe with a wing span of 30 feet through
the 50-foot-wide opening of a steel hangar. Exiting through the
rear, he pulls up to avoid a nearby cactus.
   The hangar stunt actually was performed by Paul Mantz in 1935.
   ``The problem is Pancho is no longer here and we know she did do
some work in some Howard Hughes movies, it's just that no one
documented what she did so they just lifted one stunt out that was
pretty famous,'' said Hillard, president of the national Eagle
Aerobatic Team.
   However, the adjustments in history don't bother Hillard, who
located the planes as aviation coordinator for the film. ``I think
this is going to be a neat little film. I think it's going to be
one of the best aviation films ever done.''
   Many of the planes used for filming were stored at Hartlee
Field, a grassy airstrip in this North Texas city once used as a
World War I training field.
   The field, operated by the non-profit Fighting Air Command,
houses a museum of vintage aircraft that are maintained in flying
condition, said Allan Clark, airport manager and museum director.
   The Chrysler Showcase Presentation is a Blue Andre Production
made in association with Pancho Productions and distributed by
Orion Television. Chrysler and the filmmakers refused to reveal its
cost, but Andre called it ``a very expensive and bigger than
normal'' TV movie budget.
   ``It's a very cost-effective way of putting our message on
television. The cost of production and commercial time is less than
if we bought the commercials themselves,'' said Chrysler spokesman
Steve Harris.
   Chrysler's expense is a boon to the Texas economy, which is
rebounding from an oil and real estate bust.
   ``Roughly a third to a half of the location production budget is
actually injected into the local budget,'' said Dana Shelton,
director of the Texas Film-Music Office in the state's Department
of Commerce.
   Fifty-three local actors have roles in the movie, several
playing major characters such as Amelia Earhart and Howard Hughes.
Most of the technical staff are Texans.
   The movie, to be aired on CBS Oct. 25, follows Barnes' life from
her late teens to her early 40s.
