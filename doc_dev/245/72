<LEADPARA>  THE cartoon by John Callahan in the Sept. 27 issue of eye was particularly
offensive for a variety of reasons.;   I am not an expert on humor. I am
Jewish, and this cartoon was not funny. It was not funny to many of my friends
who are not Jewish.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I cannot blame the cartoonist, as he, like so many today, will do anything
to make a buck. In these more enlightened times, when our society is learning
to accept the ethnic and cultural differences of those within our community, a
cartoon such as this is "not funny" to so many and "funny" to so few that it
is of little value to the community. This demeaning portrayal is a grim
reminder of the humor which Hitler encouraged in identifying the German Jews
as scapegoats for a nation in his rise to power.;   I cannot accept your
insensitivity as journalists and your irresponsibility as editors in allowing
this type of "humor" to be published.;   It wouldn't be funny if my name was
Smith.;   Theodore Cohen, M.D.; San Jose; (hbox);   I am not even going to
explain what is tremendously offensive about Callahan's Sept. 27 cartoon in
eye, as anyone with an ounce of decency (not to mention professional judgment)
should be able to recognize this immediately.;   You owe your readers an
immediate apology for this insensitivity to ethnic stereotypes. An apology
should appear in the cartoon space in next week's eye section. And I request
that you do your job as editors more responsibly in the future.;   Peggy
Delaney; Santa Cruz; BLACK AND WHITE ISSUES; I am very disappointed with
Stephen Whitty's review of "Livin' Large" ("Why fight for power when you can
wallow in stereotypes?" Sept. 20, eye). And what an appropriate name for
someone reviewing a comedy by a black director, starring black actors.;  
Whitty thought that whites in the movie were stereotyped as evil, vindictive,
etc.;   Well, join the club!;   If Whitty would ask black people what they
thought of the movie, I'm sure their responses would differ greatly from his.;
  The theater I sat in was filled with laughing people -- people who also
enjoyed each other's presence before and after the movie. I didn't hear any
complaints about how white people were portrayed.;   This was a very enjoyable
movie that seemed to tap into a nerve that's been tapped by blacks for
hundreds of years.;   Perhaps Whitty was not an appropriate person to review
the movie.;   Let me give you a few examples of why I don't feel there was any
stereotyping of the great white race:;   Minorities (not including white
women) are repeatedly denied their civil rights by white people, who are to
uphold the laws of the Constitution of the "land of the free." Many minorities
are prosecuted for crimes they didn't commit simply to satisfy members of the
great white race. One example is the Rodney King incident.;   Perhaps Whitty
should only watch movies such as "Steel Magnolias," "Out of Africa" and
"Rambling Rose.";   I, for one, am glad to see a variety of black movies being
released. It's a refreshing change and serves a purpose for the black
community. I stopped going to movies until movies produced, written and
directed by blacks and starring blacks and other non-whites were released.;
