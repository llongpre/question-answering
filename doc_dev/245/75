   Ben Kingsley had played real-life figures
before, but none that were still living, much less there on the set
watching his performance.
   In the HBO movie, ``Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal
Story,'' Kingsley plays the title character, famous Nazi hunter
Simon Wiesenthal, who at 80, was most interested in how his story
was to be put down on film for posterity.
   In the opening scene of the movie, premiering Sunday, Wiesenthal
is liberated from the concentration camp where he risked his life
making drawings of the horrors as a record of the Nazi crimes.
Craig T. Nelson plays Maj. Harcourt, an American officer who was
among the liberators.
   ``I did the first scene involving collapsing into Craig T.
Nelson's arms with my drawings,'' recalled Kingsley, ``and I looked
up from doing that scene, and there was Simon sitting about 20 feet
away from me with tears streaming down his face, but smiling at me
like a kind uncle who's watched his nephew win the 400 meters, you
know, a wonderful mixture of great pain and great pride that we had
got it on film.
   ``And that's what he wanted to do, is get it down on paper, get
it down on film, get it in front of the hearts and the eyes and the
minds of young people who either do not know or do not believe that
these things took place. And I'm afraid they have to know.''
   Kingsley, who won an Oscar in 1982 for his lead performance in
``Gandhi,'' said he was picked by Wiesenthal to play the part.
``This from the man himself was very flattering and, more
importantly, very, very encouraging,'' Kingsley said in a telephone
interview from his home in London.
   ``I thought, well, at least he's behind the casting, which gave
me some confidence, because the scale of the man is almost
unactable. The scale of experience, what he had to witness, is
almost unimaginable,'' Kingsley said.
   ``I knew that it would be a very difficult role, very difficult
indeed, and Simon's embrace of me was very important, emotionally,
psychologically, for my morale as an actor.''
   Kingsley said he had been in Wiesenthal's home city of Vienna
making an Italian film when he first heard of the HBO project in
1987, but decided not to meet with Wiesenthal until the offer was
firm. Then he and Renee Soutendijk, who plays Cyla Wiesenthal in
the movie, went together to meet the couple.
   ``It was a very, very exciting and extraordinary meeting, full
of emotional information, not simply because I was going to portray
the man, but to meet the man was an important experience,''
Kingsley said.
   ``You are meeting a prophet, you are meeting a spokesman, the
voice of 11{ million people. And that really comes off the man, the
energy of that obsession, and I use that word kindly, and that
burning quest is visible in the man's eyes, his physique, in his
voice and in the massive authority that he has every time he
speaks. Very kind, very wise man, but a very formidable character.''
   The movie traces Wiesenthal from his liberation in 1945 through
his tireless quest to bring Nazi war criminals to justice, most
notably Adolph Eichmann, who had escaped to Argentina. Through
Wiesenthal's efforts, Eichmann was arrested and brought to Israel
where he was tried, convicted and hanged.
   Wiesenthal has actively participated in publicizing the film,
which he sees as an extension of his work keeping the Holocaust
alive in people's minds so it cannot happen again. Kingsley avoided
thinking of the sociological ramifications of the movie during
filming.
   ``If you're climbing a mountain knowing that you have to place a
flag on the top of the mountain, when you're halfway up the
mountain, if the flag is in your knapsack, you don't keep taking it
out and looking at it. What you look at is where you put your hand
next and where you put your foot next. ... If the ramifications of
placing the flag on the top of the mountain are your preoccupation,
10-to-1 you're going to fall off the mountain.''
   Kingsley, who most recently appeared in the comedy ``Without a
Clue'' with Michael Caine, is off to Brazil next month to film a
French comedy, ``The Fifth Monkey.''
