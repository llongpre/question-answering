   Lane Smith almost didn't play Richard M.
Nixon in the ABC movie ``The Final Days'' because, through a
misunderstanding, he was asked to read for another role.
   Smith portrays the former president during the Watergate crisis
that led to his resignation on Aug. 9, 1974. The three-hour movie,
based on the book by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, will be
telecast Sunday, Oct. 29.
   Executive producer Stu Samuels had him in mind for the lead
role, but the casting people mistakenly had him read for the role
of J. Fred Buzhardt, special White House counsel for Watergate.
   ``They had looked at everybody for Nixon,'' said Smith. ``They
looked at Albert Finney in London. Everybody. Then Susie Glicksman,
a casting director who was not involved, sent my picture to Stu and
said, `Here's your Richard Nixon.' But they had me read for the
Buzhardt role, which Richard Kiley got.
   ``It got down to the wire and they still hadn't found Nixon.
Then Stu learned I'd read for Buzhardt. They called me on a Friday
to read on a Monday. I looked all over town for video tapes on
Nixon and finally found one. I knew they didn't want an imitation
of Nixon, but I knew I had to have the physical aspects.''
   Smith stood up. He pulled his pants up above his waist. ``I
noticed that he wore his pants high,'' he said. ``His jacket was
always buttoned and he often had his hand on his hip.''
   He demonstrated and suddenly he was transformed into Nixon.
``Once I had that I was able to get on to the emotions,'' he said.
   ``I saw him as a man who had suffered a great loss. I wasn't
concerned about the politics. What concerned me was: How did he get
through this dilemma? I tried to make him a human being.''
   Two clues gave Smith ``the key to the man,'' he said.
   ``I looked at his resignation speech and thought it was a little
bizarre. Woodward gave me the clue. He'd talked to people who had
been there. Richard Nixon had finally taken off his mask and showed
himself as vulnerable and suffering. And when he got down on his
knees with Henry Kissinger, I think that process restored him to
his roots. So, having those clues, I was able to portray him.''
   Nixon has protested the portrayals in ``The Final Days,'' which
tells of his last days in the White House. In a letter to sponsor
AT&amp;T, his spokesman John H. Taylor said the company should change
its slogan to ``Reach Out and Smear Someone.''
   Besides challenging the accuracy of ``The Final Days,'' Nixon
``objects strongly to being depicted by an actor without his
consent,'' said his lawyer, William E. Griffin, in a letter to
Capital Cities-ABC Inc.
   ABC said it was satisified with the fairness and accuracy of the
program.
   In addition to Smith and Kiley, it stars David Ogden Stiers as
Gen. Alexander Haig, Ed Flanders as Nixon aide Leonard Garment,
Theodore Bikel as Henry Kissinger, Graham Beckel as press secretary
Ron Ziegler, James B. Sikking as Elliot Richardson, Diana Bellamy
as Nixon secretary Rose Mary Woods and Susan Brown as first lady
Pat Nixon. Hugh Whitemore wrote the screenplay, and Richard Pearce
directed.
   Smith has just completed a role in ABC's ``Challenger,'' a movie
about the explosion of the space shuttle on Jan. 28, 1986. He plays
Larry Malloy, chief engineer at the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala.
   His latest feature film, ``Night Games,'' starring Roy Scheider,
opened recently. ``American Built,'' a movie about motorcycle
racing filmed in France, will be released soon.
   At the time ``The Final Days'' is telecast Smith will be in
Thailand for ``Air America,'' a movie about the airline operated in
Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War by the Central Intelligence
Agency. It stars Mel Gibson.
   ``I play a U.S. senator who's sort of an innocent abroad,'' he
said. ``He's heard a rumor that a Vietnamese general is involved in
the drug trade, but the American government is ignoring it to keep
his army in the field. He's also heard that a few Americans are
lining their pockets.''
   Smith, a native of Memphis, Tenn., studied at Carnegie Tech and
the Actors Studio in New York. On the stage he played McMurphy in
``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and won the Drama Desk Award
for his role in ``Glengarry Glen Ross.''
   He's been in such movies as ``Weeds,'' ``Places in the Heart,''
``Frances,'' ``Prince of the City,'' `` Honeysuckle Rose'' and
``Red Dawn,'' and such TV movies and miniseries as ``Gideon's
Trumpet,'' ``Something About Amelia,'' ``Chiefs,'' ``If Tomorrow
Comes'' and ``Dress Gray.''
   His only series was CBS' ``Kay O'Brien'' in 1986, in which he
played a surgeon.
