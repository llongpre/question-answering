   In an upcoming ``true life'' cable movie
about the Watts riots as experienced by the Los Angeles Times'
first black reporter, here's what you won't see:
   _ The firing of ``reporter trainee'' Robert Richardson the same
month the Times won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the riots.
   _ Richardson's battle with alcoholism and arrest on a theft
charge, and the tragedy and turmoil that followed the inexperienced
journalist's brief tenure at the Times.
   Debates over the accuracy of docu-dramas have created as much
controversy as the events they re-create.
   A 1987 made-for-TV NBC movie about the Billionaire Boys Club
prompted an outcry from defense attorneys who claimed it
jeopardized BBC leader Joe Hunt's right to a fair trial. Hunt was
convicted of murdering a con man who threatened the get-rich-quick
scheme Hunt hatched with some Ivy League pals.
   A 1985 dramatization of the Atlanta child murders started an
uproar over its sympathetic portrayal of Wayne Williams, who still
was appealing his 1982 conviction when CBS broadcast the show.
   Blending truth and fiction for the sake of compelling television
is a little like playing God. Truth is what the producer and
screenwriter say it is.
   In ``Heat Wave,'' now in production for Ted Turner's TNT cable
network, here is the truth you will see:
   _ Blair Underwood of ``L.A. Law'' playing Richardson, a
24-year-old black messenger in the classified advertising
department who is promoted to the newsroom after phoning in the
looting and burning that leveled Watts in August 1965.
   _ The inability of the all-white Times news staff to get inside
until Richardson, who lived in the area, volunteered his help. It
was Richardson who told Times readers that rampaging youths were
screaming, ``Burn, baby, burn.''
   _ A postscript to the movie that says the Times went on to win a
Pulitzer for its Watts coverage and Richardson went on to become
the paper's first black reporter.
   But Richardson did not ride off into a journalistic sunset. In
May 1966, nine months after his promotion and in the same month the
Times was awarded its Pulitzer, Richardson was fired.
   ``Heat Wave'' screenwriter Michael Lazarou said that detail, and
Richardson's subsequent troubles, are irrelevant to the script.
   ``We are talking about an extraordinary set of circumstances in
which the Los Angeles Times was hamstrung,'' Lazarou said. ``What
happened to Bob Richardson later doesn't matter. What is important
is that the lessons of the Watts riots went largely unlearned. That
is what's relevant.''
   Although Richardson is the lead character and was paid a fee for
his story rights, ``Heat Wave'' _ to be televised in August _ is
really about Watts, Lazarou said.
   Pressed about Richardson, Lazarou refused further interviews. In
two memos, he refused to answer more questions about the script or
Richardson, who he said is now a close friend.
   In one memo, Lazarou wrote: ``Though alcoholism played a role in
a misdeameanor conviction, later dropped, which ended his career at
the Times,'' Richardson went on to work for local radio stations.
   Lazarou continued: ``As Bob will openly admit, his life has
certainly had it's highs and lows. ... But his courage and his
contribution to the Los Angeles Times during it's hour of need
cannot and should not be minimized.''
   Richardson could not be located for an interview. ``He's not
available right now,'' said Turner spokeswoman Alison Hill. He is
not listed in the Los Angeles phone book. Times reporters who
worked with him during the riots said they have not talked with him
in 25 years.
   ``It was not working out for him to be a reporter. He was let
go. He never functioned as a reporter. He did not go out and cover
the riots. He did contribute stuff, but it was kind of personal
reflections,'' said Eric Malnic, a Times reporter who helped cover
the riots.
   Those reflections included this description: ``I had to do all
of my telephoning from street-corner booths in gas stations. You
have no idea how naked you can feel in an exposed, lighted
telephone booth.
   ``But I was hep at that time. Whenever a group of Negroes
approached to look me over I knew what to do. You open the door,
stick your head out and shout, `Burn, baby, burn.' Then you are
safe.''
   Lazarou's script was approved by the Times. Former Times Editor
Bill Thomas, who was city editor during the riots, also signed off
on the script, which uses his name.
   ``This stuff is dredging up memories that are really dim,''
Thomas said. ``He was an inexperienced reporter and there were some
problems with that. ... But I don't remember too many details.''
   Richardson was seen in March at a Skid Row residential program
for alcoholic men, said a Salvation Army employee who wouldn't let
his name be used. ``I had seen him there about a year before. I
guess he had re-entered the program,'' the employee said.
   ``He was such a nice man. My impression was that this was
someone who had had a very interesting journalistic career, but had
had some very bad times.''
