   Pete Curley was pleased to supply the
slobbering but lovable canines for Tom Hanks' film ``Turner and
Hooch,'' but he's not all that happy when moviegoers drive to his
home hoping to see his Dogues de Bordeaux.
   ``It's when they pull into the driveway and run around the yard
that I stick my head out the window and say, `It's not open to the
public,''' Curley said.
   He became something of a sensation among his neighbors in rural
Merrimac after they saw him interviewed on cable television about
his contribution to the movie.
   The movie released this summer is about a fastidious detective
who reluctantly takes in a brown and white dog named Hooch after its
owner is murdered. Three of the four large, jowly dogs sold to the
moviemakers by Curley portrayed Hooch in various scenes. A
4-month-old pup also appeared in the film.
   Curley, 34, said the sale to Disney studios was a real boost to
his principal business, the import and export of rare breeds.
   But the movie has led to many calls from people who really
shouldn't own a Dogue de Bordeaux, he said.
   ``There are a lot of people who want to buy them for all the
wrong reasons,'' he said ``For some people it's a macho thing. ...
If someone asks how hard the dog will bite, I don't sell him a dog.''
   The question represents a misunderstanding of the dogs' real
nature, he said. ``Yes, they're very good guard dogs, but they're
also extremely tolerant of children,'' he said.
   Curley said that from his first glimpse of a Dogue de Bordeaux,
which is the national watchdog of France, during a Peace Corps stint
in Guatemala after graduating from the University of
Wisconsin-Stevens Point, he knew he wanted to own a dog like that.
   After the Peace Corps, he was determined to do something that
allowed him to work with animals and to travel. He started to breed
bull mastiffs.
   About eight years ago, he borrowed $1,800, flew to France and
bought his first Dogue de Bordeaux. Last September, his
prize-winning Auriela was named best of show at Ernee, France.
   ``I'm an American, and I beat them on their own turf,'' he said.
