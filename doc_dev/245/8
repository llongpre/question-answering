   Former President Nixon, angered at a planned ABC
drama about his last months in office, suggested in a letter sent by
an aide Friday that the show's sponsor, AT&amp;T, change its well-known
corporate slogan to ``Reach Out and Smear Someone.''
   The letter to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. board chairman
Robert E. Allen was written and signed by the Nixon aide, John H.
Taylor.
   In a phone interview from Nixon's office in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.,
Taylor said the letter reflected the former president's views,
although he said the letter's words are his own and not those of
Nixon.
   The letter also said Nixon had cancelled his long-distance AT&amp;T
service at home, and switched to a rival company, MCI, because of
the former's sponsorship of ABC's ``The Final Days.''
   Taylor's letter included another one he sent Monday to the
government's General Services Administration, requesting a similar
switch to MCI for Nixon's office. That letter called ABC's planned
movie a ``distorted, malicious portrait of the last days of the
Nixon Administration.''
   AT&amp;T values ``all our customers, and Mr. Nixon, too,'' said Burke
Stinson, a spokesman for the company. He said AT&amp;T regrets losing
any customer, but still will sponsor the ABC movie and hopes that
viewers ``will judge for themselves'' the fairness of the film.
   The three-hour movie, to air on Oct. 29, dramatizes the
best-selling book by Bob Woodward and Carl Berstein that was their
account of Nixon's downfall in 1973 and 1974 during the Watergate
scandal. Nixon, portrayed in the movie by actor Lane Smith, resigned
in August, 1974.
   Among other things, the book depicts Nixon in his final White
House days as a deeply disturbed man who once reportedly talked to
portraits hanging on the White House walls. Nixon, through friends
and his lawyers, have denied such allegations.
   In his letter for Nixon, which he made available to a reporter,
Taylor enclosed an eight-page complaint about the movie that Nixon's
attorney, William E. Griffin, sent last March to Capital Cities-ABC
Inc. chairman Thomas S. Murphy, head of the network's parent company.
   That complaint, Taylor said, includes what his letter to Allen
called a ``summary of criticism'' by journalists in major newspapers
and publications in their reviews of the book upon its publication
in 1976.
   ``In view of the highly questionable nature of the book even in
their eyes,'' Taylor wrote Allen, ``perhaps you should change your
corporate slogan to `Reach Out and Smear Someone.' ''
   Stinson, whose company's catch phrase is ``Reach Out and Touch
Someone,'' declined to comment on Taylor's suggestion.
   Much of the journalistic criticism cited by Taylor's letter
centered on the book's literary form and use of anonymous sources.
Woodward, a Washington Post editor, has said he and Bernstein stand
by the accuracy of what they wrote.
   Griffin's complaint to ABC's chief executive implied the
possibility of a lawsuit in an area of law that lawyers call the
``right of publicity,'' or the right to commercially exploit one's
own name and image.
   Nixon, his attorney's letter said, ``objects strongly to being
depicted by an actor without his consent.
   ``It is his contention that being depicted in this manner purely
for the profit of Capital Cities-ABC and for the entertainment of
its audience is a violation of his privacy and an infringement of
his right to use his name and image to promote his own writings and
statements about foreign policy and other issues facing our nation
and the world.''
   No specific threat of a lawsuit was made. Taylor, who said Nixon
had authorized the complaint that his lawyer sent to ABC, said he
didn't know if a lawsuit would be filed against ABC if it aired
``The Final Days.''
   Dick Connelly, an ABC spokesman, confirmed that the company had
been ``contacted by President Nixon's attorney'' and that ``our
general counsel responded to his letters.''
   He declined to say how many letters ABC had received from Nixon's
lawyer, or how ABC replied to them.
   However, he said, referring to ABC's movie about Nixon, ``we did
not modify the program. We are satisfied with its fairness and
accuracy, and believe this production will speak for itself.''
