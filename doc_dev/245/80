   Puerto Rican actor Raul Julia, who portrays
Aristotle Onassis in a new ABC miniseries, says he thinks the Greek
shipping magnate got the idea for his first fortune at the movies.
   ``The Richest Man in the World: The Story of Aristotle Onassis''
tells how Onassis made his first millions in tobacco and then
bought six aging tankers that he eventually turned into an empire.
   The four-hour miniseries, which will be telecast on Sunday and
Monday, also chronicles Onassis' tempestuous love affair with opera
star Maria Callas and his marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of
President John F. Kennedy.
   Julia takes over the role when Onassis is 35 and is about to
make the transition from tobacco importer to shipping magnate.
Young ``Aristo'' is played by Elias Koteas.
   ``He was a self-made man who left Greece when he was in his
early 20s with $250 and went to Buenos Aires,'' Julia says. ``He
sold ties on the street and worked as a telephone operator. Then he
got the idea, I think from watching a Rudolph Valentino film, of
making cigarettes for women.''
   Onassis began importing Turkish tobacco into Argentina by ship.
   ``When he learned how much money the ship owners were making he
bought six old tankers at a bargain,'' Julia says. ``Then he found
the shipping business was like a closed fraternity. He had to marry
into one of the great Greek shipping families to make a go of it.''
   Onassis' first wife was Tina Livanos (played by Beatie Edney),
daughter of Stavros Livanos (played by Anthony Zerbe). They had two
children before the marriage ended in divorce. Tina remarried twice
before she died.
   Julia says the marriage was an example of Onassis' determination
to win at any cost.
   ``He was a man who would stop at nothing to get what he
wanted,'' he says. ``He was very persuasive, very charming. He knew
how to manipulate people into doing his wishes. He was very
cunning...absolutely ruthless.''
   Jane Seymour also stars as Maria Callas and Francesca Annis
plays Jacqueline Kennedy. Anthony Quinn plays Onassis' father,
Socrates, and Quinn's son, Lorenzo Quinn, portrays Aristotle's only
son, Alexander. Anthony Quinn played a thinly disguised version of
Onassis in a 1978 movie, ``The Greek Tycoon.''
   ``Ari and Maria had a very stormy, passionate affair,'' Julia
says. ``They were both Greek. They loved each other madly and they
fought as madly as they loved. They never married. They were both
married to someone else. I would say it lasted until he died. Even
after he married Jackie he saw her several times.''
   Julia says Onassis also had had another passionate affair with a
Swedish woman, ``but we don't show that in the picture.''
   ``When she was in her 80s, before she died, she told a writer
she still loved Onassis,'' he says.
   Onassis sometimes treated his women cruelly and had no
consideration of their feelings, Julia says. ``Yet they still loved
him to the end.''
   This is Julia's first television role since he played
Mussolini's son-in-law in the 1986 NBC miniseries ``Mussolini: The
Untold Story.''
   Prior to ``Onassis,'' he was in Brazil for ``Moon Over
Parador,'' a Paul Mazursky comedy in which he plays a Latin
American strongman who forces an American actor (Richard Dreyfuss)
to pose as the country's dictator. He doesn't want the people to
know that the dictator has died. It sounds like a comedy version of
``The Prisoner of Zenda,'' but Julia says it's more like Danny
Kaye's ``The Inspector General.''
   Julia has another movie coming out this summer called ``The
Penitents,'' which was written and directed by character actor
Cliff Osmond. It's about a Mexican farmer who helps re-create the
passion of Christ during Lent, which leads to a crucifixion. It
also tells of the farmer's conflict with his wife, who is still a
virgin.
   Julia, a native of Puerto Rico, lives in New York, where he is
closely associated with the theater. He is married and has two sons.
   He is a four-time Tony nominee for ``Nine,'' ``Threepenny
Opera,'' ``Where's Charley?'' and ``Two Gentlemen of Verona.'' His
last Broadway role was in George Bernard Shaw's ``Arms and the
Man.''
   The National Board of Review named him best actor for his role
in the 1985 movie ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.''
