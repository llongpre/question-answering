<TEXT>     Sure, the Kennedys are beautiful. Sure, they're glamorous. Sure, one of
them was president, and another should have been.;   But c'mon. About the only
family member who hasn't been immortalized in a miniseries is Clem
Kadiddlehopper Kennedy, the Republican cousin nobody talks about.;  
Otherwise, everyone's had a movie or mini: young Joe, old Rose, President
Jack, brother Bobby and, of course, First Martyr Jackie.;   Over and over
again.;   Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis has been portrayed by
everyone from Jaclyn Smith to Blair Brown to the unforgettable Francesca
Annis.;   To that distinguished roll we can now add Roma Downey, the star of
"A Woman Named Jackie," whose previous work includes "One Life to Live" and
last season's brief NBC series "The 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage.";   Even
the network press material, prone to puffing up the merest wisp of a credit,
refers to her as "unknown.";   Unfortunately, she doesn't do much with this
role either, although her portrayal isn't the biggest thing wrong with "A
Woman Named Jackie.";   Dullness is. This is six hours of boredom from first
to last.;   The reason: We've seen it all before -- different actors,
different portrayals, perhaps, but same events. I guess we'll continue to be
subjected to it until someone gets it right.;   This script was adapted from
perhaps the most thorough biography of the former First Lady, the 1989 book by
C. David Heymann from which the miniseries gets its title. Heymann is the chap
who gave us "Poor Little Rich Girl," the Barbara Hutton bio that became a
miniseries starring Farrah Fawcett.;   In a "Woman Named Jackie," Heymann
spends 653 pages on every detail of her life, then concludes: "One question
remains: What is Jackie really like? And the answer is: We may never truly
know.";   Which is one reason six hours is about five too many. There is --
and apparently always was -- less to her than meets the eye. Her chief claim
to fame is the men she married, not too wisely but certainly well, if fame and
fortune were her goals.;   "A Woman Named Jackie" begins, as most made-for-TV
movies do, with a brief scene in the near present meant to set up the five
hours and 50 minutes of flashback to follow.;   Jackie (who always hated being
called that) and son John are seen nervously awaiting the birth of daughter
Caroline's first baby, Jackie's first grandchild.;   "I'm a mess," Jackie
utters -- which could stand as a one-line description for the hours that
follow, continuing with her own birth in July 1929, in Southampton, Long
Island, N.Y.;   William Devane, who played JFK in what was probably the best
Kennedy television saga, "The Missiles of October," portrays Jackie's father
here, the roguish stockbroker Black Jack Bouvier. Wendy Hughes plays her
mother, Janet Lee Bouvier.;   It is from watching the bad behavior of her
father that Jackie is said to have been able to deal with the philandering of
her two husbands. Her mother tolerated it less well, divorcing Black Jack and
marrying investment banker Hugh Auchincloss (Bob Gunton).;   "I promise you
one thing," Jackie says to Black Jack, when he visits her at Vasser. "I'll
never be a housewife.";   "A grand beginning," he responds.;   And, yes,
there's more clunky foreshadowing, such as the time her stepfather tells her,
"I have a feeling, my dear, you will always be in the spotlight.";   Roger
Hirson is responsible for lines such as those and the film's many invented
conversations, like the one with Jack after he asks her to marry him:;   "I
love you, Jack," she says. "I want to be your wife. I want to have your
children.";   "We'll have a good time," he answers, without saying he loves
her.;   Since no one else was present, and you can bet neither of the
principals ever repeated a story like that, it comes directly from Hirson's
head.;   He went to less mundane sources for a variation on the old line about
Boston Brahmins: "Where the Lowells talk to the Cabots and the Cabots talk
only to God." Hirson makes it "The Cabots speak only to the Lodges, and the
Lodges speak only to God" so it can come out of the mouth of Jackie's sister,
Lee, when she questions her mother about the Cabots being seated next to the
Fitzgeralds at John and Jackie's wedding.;   But the Cabots would not have
been seated next to anyone there, since they were old-money Republicans, and
the Fitzgeralds and Kennedys new-money Democrats, who wouldn't have invited
Cabots on a bet.;   "A Woman Named Jackie" is full of such nonsense, and
almost no one in the cast is able to make us believe for a moment they are
real. Their tasks, particularly Downey's, are not made easier by the fact that
we've seen enough of the people they're playing to know these are just pale
imitations.;   Downey is prettier than Jackie but does bear a passing
resemblance to her. In some long shots where she is wearing dark glasses,
Downey could be her double. Downey's breathy voice is a kind of cross between
Jackie's own and Audrey Hepburn's. But it, like the character, becomes rather
tiresome; six hours of a woman without much emotion is a very long time.;  
The film isn't helped by Stephen Collins' boyish and unconvincing John
Kennedy, whose Boston accent seems to appear only on words like "cahn't.";  
No portrayal of JFK these days would be complete without reference to his many
dalliances, and, while we never see him in the arms of another woman, we do
see the Secret Service protecting him during closed-door shenanigans. And we
see Jackie hand over a pair of women's panties with the cutting remark, "Find
out who owns them. They're not my size," which Heymann claims she actually
said.;   One thing she didn't do, though, was watch Marilyn Monroe's famous
"Happy Birthday, Mr. President" song with her mother on TV from Madison Square
Garden, as she does here, because it wasn't shown live.;   Monroe and JFK did
share a dinner during the Democratic Convention of 1960, however, and it's in
the film. Monroe told friends that she called the White House once and Jackie
answered, another scene that is re-created. So are Monroe's death and Jackie's
comment, "She will go on eternally.";   Monday's Part 2 ends with Jackie's
pledge to accompany her husband wherever he campaigns, "if it means being
together." The moment none of us wants to see again, JFK's assassination,
doesn't come until the start of Part 3 on Tuesday.;   After JFK's funeral and
Jackie's move to New York, she is wooed and won by Aristotle Onassis (Joss
Ackland), a marriage that shocked the world.;   The unlikely pair is shown as
rather happy in the beginning. Onassis tells her, "I am a lucky man, and you
are lucky, too. With me, you have learned to open up like a flower. You are my
real-life flower.";   She and the marriage begin to wilt, however, and Onassis
is seen making plans for a divorce before his death in 1975.;   Not long
afterward, Jacqueline Onassis goes to work editing books. Near the end of the
miniseries, we see her tell fashion maven Diana Vreeland that Caroline is
pregnant. Never mind that the book she's talking with Vreeland about came out
in 1977, and Caroline didn't give birth until 1988.;   Such license is typical
throughout "A Woman Named Jackie." In the end, this show is just one more
excruciating rehash of the life of a woman, who, by herself, isn't interesting
enough to warrant the effort. (box)  </TEXT>
