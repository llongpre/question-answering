Andrews looks back at the best and worst films of 1994

Tapping his pocket calculator, the British film critic works out that during
1994 he spent some 500 waking hours in darkened movie theatres.
How is he affected by this daytime dream life? Re-watching Nightmare On Elm
Street on TV recently, I realised that it was all about us. We film critics
too sink into dream states from which we emerge with a large quantity of
traumatic baggage. We too have a difficult time, at day's end, sorting real
life from fantasy.
In 1994 we endured exploding faces and showers of blood in Pulp Fiction. We
sat through the Holocaust in Schindler's List. We died of Aids in
Philadelphia. Worst of all, we spent 2 1/2 hours galumphing across America
with Forrest Gump, knowing that on returning to the real world we would be
torn apart by Mr and Mrs Average Filmgoer for not liking the year's
sentimental favourite.
Gump was overlong, self-pitying and speciously panoramic. The film's implied
proposition was that Forrest Gump stands for us all. Sensible critics'
counter-proposition was that Forrest Gump stands for absolutely no one. The
movie itself was the product of a maudlin America desperate to portray
itself as the world's Mr Innocent, even as it picks up the pieces of its own
accident-strewn recent history.
Even where Gump's chameleon experiences did coincide with the flavour of the
year, that flavour was better caught and served in other films. Major theme
of 1994: the protean self. We had Jim Carrey doing quick-change acts in The
Mask, helped by belief-beggaring special FX. We had Robert Altman's bitterly
brilliant Short Cuts, where Los Angeles is a city of seething, sleazy,
metamorphic humanity (so true) in which the Good Mother does sex phone-calls
on the side and the Good Cop rescues dogs and has adulterous affairs.
As for the year's best independent movie, that too was about kaleidoscopic
identity: 32 Short Films About Glenn Gould. Canadian film-maker Francois
Girod took a real famous person (unprotestingly deceased) and broke him into
shiny dramatic pieces like an animated mosaic. The film, dazzlingly clever
and funny, shattered our preconceptions about what bio-pics can and cannot
do. Most of all they can - and should - show the several dozen selves of
which a single human being is made up.
If 1994 was the year of the de-centred hero, could this possibly have had to
do with our leaders?: with having two western premiers in particular who are
resonantly ATTAP (all things to all people). While Gump openly invoked Bill
Clinton - down to the grainy news-shot of our hero shaking hands with JFK -
Britain's top movie commercially was Four Weddings And A Funeral. In this a
likable silly ass dithers around the British landscape trying to turn
non-commitment into a form of evangelism. Hugh Grant, we suspect, was the
matinee idol's answer to John Major.
But we are talking of men. Were there no heroines? Here we must draw
attention to the chronic catch-22 concerning women in popular movie culture.
Whenever in western history the female sex hangs back socially and
professionally (as in the 1950s), women are relegated to helpmeet or
romantic interest roles on screen. The iconography fills up with June
Allysons and Jane Wymans. Yet when the female sex bounds forward, as it has
since the New Feminism began, women on screen may end up being sidelined
even more drastically: by a paranoid patriarchy fearing for its pecking
place.
So in 1994 Jodie Foster paid for her Oscar-strewn recent history by being
cast as Mel Gibson's moll in the year's top no-brainer, Maverick. Michelle
Pfeiffer, once a tough, intelligent kookie, was demoted to lycanthropy bait
for Jack Nicholson (Wolf). Diane Keaton, once the quirkiest leading lady in
Hollywood, gave up on solo leads and went back to being Mistress Woody Allen
in Manhattan Murder Mystery.
As for the appalling House Of The Spirits, it managed to lock up both Meryl
Streep and Glenn Close, and throw away the key, in a hacienda ruled by
barking-mad male chauvinist Jeremy Irons: a sort of Hollywood studio chief
translated into Chilean landowner.
Hollywood the boys' club: it would be funny if it was not tragic. Compare
Europe and points east. Here the year's key films nearly all centred around
women. Kieslowski's Red gave us Irene Jacob manfully - womanfully - holding
the line for honesty and human values against paternalist voyeur Jean-Louis
Trintignant. In The Scent Of Green Papaya a lithe camera rhymed the baroque
beauties of a middle-class Vietnamese house with the anfractuous mysteries
of its heroine's mind. And in China's The Blue Kite - the best Maoist fresco
in a busy year for the sub-genre - women characters were as strongly, subtly
dimensionalised as the men.
At least America gave us Go Fish, a grainy, uninhibited comedy of lesbian
life. But that was low-budget and independent. So were two other films from
North America that were among the year's best. Atom Egoyan's Calendar played
hide-and-seek with reality in a mock-autobiographical tale of the
film-maker's splintering marriage: set against the mosaic landscapes of
Armenia and Toronto. And Kevin Smith's Clerks, a brilliantly profane tale of
sex, death and existence in a convenience store, was shown at the London
Film Festival and should be released next year, though not for good
behaviour.
In Britain the doors have long clanged shut on creative vitality. The
triumph of Four Weddings And A Funeral was good news and bad news. Good that
it became, worldwide, the most successful British film in history. (In
Britain itself it was number one above Gump, Mrs Doubtfire and The
Flintstones.) Bad that British cinema can only 'click' abroad, and seemingly
at home, by reviving those fluffy notions of Old Blighty in which our
kingdom is filled with champers, silly ass-ness and oh-I-say accents.
Don't blame the movie. Blame the other movies: the slew of made-in-UK
horrors like Shopping, Funny Man, Staggered, Deadly Advice and Decadence in
which British film-makers behaved, in this 99th year of movie history, as if
none of them had ever picked up a movie camera before.
A camera is indeed a dangerous and daunting object: fed with light, it
captures life. But perhaps 'life', rather than technology, is where British
cinema comes unstuck.
We seem unable to define what life is in this country. We wander about in
half-worlds belonging to other times (Four Weddings) or other people (the
Americanisms of Shopping). Perhaps we should celebrate the cinema's
hundredth birthday by beginning again: first by finding out who we are, only
then by trying to pin it down on celluloid.
And the top 10 films of 1994?
Short Cuts, 32 Short Films About Glenn Gould, The Blue Kite, Go Fish, Dear
Diary, The Scent Of Green Papaya, Manhattan Murder Mystery, Calendar,
Schindler's List, The Mask.
