   Edward James Olmos learned of his Oscar
nomination today over a cellular telephone, Dustin Hoffman heard his
name called out on television and Melanie Griffith and Martin Landau
were awakened by friends.
   Surprise and realization of a dream come true were common
reactions among Oscar contenders, particularly on the West Coast
where groggy wake-up calls rang in the good news moments after the
pre-dawn announcement.
   ``The phone started ringing. Actually, I was asleep. It's a
wonderful way to wake up, really an incredible way to wake up,''
said Landau, nominated for his supporting role in ``Tucker: The Man
and His Dream.''
   ``It's just terrific. I am very pleased. It's a dream. As a kid
in Brooklyn, I dreamed of this. I think everyone does,'' Landau said
from his Los Angeles home.
   Melanie Griffith didn't expect her ``Working Girl'' best actress
nomination and slept through the nationally televised Academy Award
announcement, said her publicist Elliot Mintz.
   ``We went out last night for dinner and I told her I was staying
up late to see the nominations come in. She said she didn't think
she would be nominated and went to bed,'' Mintz said.
   ``I called her this morning and she was completely overwhelmed
and surprised. She doesn't give me any indication whatsoever that
she thinks she will win the award,'' Mintz said.
   Miss Griffith, who disclosed this week she was pregnant, and
fiance-actor Don Johnson were in Miami.
   ``Don was fairly confident all along that she would be nominated.
He is Melanie's biggest booster,'' said Mintz, who also was in Miami.
   Tom Hanks wasn't available for reaction to his nomination for his
performance ``Big.'' Publicist Heidi Schaeffer said tersely: ``He's
not talking to anybody.''
   Dustin Hoffman, nominated for ``Rain Man,'' was more gracious.
Watching the announcement on TV, he expressed pleasure that director
Barry Levinson was nominated for the movie beset by difficulties.
   ``Thank you. I'm happy for Barry Levinson, the film and everybody
connected with it,'' he said from New York.
   The film had four directors and many script overhauls. In
addition, Hoffman almost quit in the first week of shooting.
   ``All through the filming, people would come up to me ... and
say, `This is definitely an Oscar film.' And I would say, `Please.
Not now. We'll worry about that later,''' said ``Rain Man'' producer
Mark Johnson.
   ``It really was charmed from the beginning. It was next to
impossible to put together,'' Johnson said. ``But there hasn't been
a stumble along the way. It has very much been a storybook kind of
film.''
   ``Miami Vice'' star Olmos was overwhelmed by his nomination for
his portrayal of inspirational math teacher Jaime Escalante in
``Stand and Deliver.'' He grinned as he heard his name over a
cellular phone.
   ``I can't believe it. I'm very happy right now. It's
extraordinary,'' Olmos said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``It's beyond anybody's wildest dreams. I'm really thankful that
I'm here and representing a film like `Stand and Deliver.'''
