   Rita Moreno didn't have to search for a role
model to play a movie star fighting desperately to save her sagging
career.
   ``She's a Joan Crawford kind of character,'' said Moreno, who
stars in the final episode of ``Tales From the Hollywood Hills'' on
Nov. 18 on PBS. ``The writer of the story knew her. It's a marvelous
role. Very showy.''
   ``The Closed Set'' is based on a short story by Gavin Lambert.
Moreno had a real-life encounter with Crawford that could have been
a scene from this scathing view of Hollywood _ or from ``Mommie
Dearest,'' Christina Crawford's tell-all book about her famous
mother.
   The encounter took place backstage at the Academy Awards in 1961,
when Moreno won as best supporting actress for ``West Side Story.''
   ``I flew in from Manila, where I was making a B picture, on the
off-chance that I would win over Judy Garland in `Judgment in
Nuremberg,''' she said. ``Joan Crawford, I think, was one of the
co-hosts. She had a dressing room right off the stage with a huge
Pepsi Cola cooler.
   ``I won the Oscar and I ran off stage and burst into tears. Joan
Crawford grabbed me and clutched me to her football field-sized
bosom. The photographers started taking pictures. She wouldn't let
go and she wouldn't let my face show. She kept posing for the
photographers. I couldn't breathe and the Oscar was digging into me.
Some big guy finally pried us apart.''
   That wasn't the end.
   ``A week later,'' Moreno said, ``I was back in Manila when I got
a letter on the famous blue stationery. She said, `Darling Rita, How
sweet and thoughtful of you to come and visit me in my dressing room
at the moment of your glory. Love, Joan.'''
   Moreno rocked with laughter. ``Visit her dressing room!'' she
said. ``She had a death grip on me and dragged me in.''
   While being interviewed, Moreno wore a purple dress that hugged
her svelte figure. On her dark, curly hair is a deep purple hat with
a rolled brim. She said fans often ask her how she keeps so thin.
She tells them diet, regular workouts and a strenuous concert act.
   In ``The Closed Set,'' she portrays actress Julie Forbes, who
hires a hot new director of a just-released art film for a quick fix
to her skidding career.
   ``She's doing a movie more or less based on her life, about her
start as a burlesque queen,'' said Moreno. ``He's in the Elia Kazan
mold. She's old Hollywood. He thinks he can finally get her to act.
But she gets scared. To her, an art film is harsh lighting and
wrinkles on her face.
   ``She sets out to sabotage his film and make it show. She bars
him from the set and completes the movie her way. The ending is very
much in the Hollywood tradition. She doesn't fall on her face. And
the director becomes famous for a film he doesn't want his name on.''
   The one-hour film is the last of six under the heading ``Tales
From the Hollywood Hills'' for ``Great Performances'' on PBS.
Previous episodes have been based on stories written by John O'Hara,
Budd Schulberg, F. Scott Fitzgerald, P.G. Wodehouse and William
Faulkner.
   Watch this film and you'll see why Moreno won that Oscar, as well
as a Tony, two Emmys and a Grammy. She is marvelous as the actress,
dripping honey one moment, hurling abuse the next. It also stars
D.W. Moffett as the young director and Harold Gould as the studio
boss. Mollie Miller directed from a screenplay by Ellen M. Violett.
   ``We turned out a four-week movie in 14 days,'' said Moreno. ``We
had wonderful people. That's why people work for PBS for almost
nothing. You get the best. You can get women. Our producer, director
and writer were all women. I think people do this because it's a
talent showcase.
   ``The networks would never let cinematographer Fred Elmes light
this the way he did. He used a lot of scrims on the lights and a lot
of pink, which gave very subtle, fleshy tones. The networks wouldn't
let you do this kind of story. PBS is a national treasure and we
have to look after it.''
   Moreno won her Tony in 1975 for ``The Ritz.'' Her Emmys were for
an appearance on ``The Muppets'' in 1977 and a guest star role on
``The Rockford Files'' in 1978. The Grammy was for her 1972
performance on ``The Electric Company Album.''
