   It's not exactly a role actors would kill for,
but kill indeed they do.
   Seven men have portrayed Jason Voorhees, the masked and
multilated corpse who refuses to stay dead in the seven ``Friday
the 13th'' movies.
   The Jasons have ranged from a professional trapeze artist to a
nightclub manager who had no acting experience:
   1. Ari Lehman was 14 when he launched Jason's blood binge in
``Friday the 13th.'' In the movie that made sequels a thriving
business, he's only seen in two scenes: a flashback when Jason
drowns as a child in Crystal Lake, and at the end of the film when
his rotting corpse rises from the lake to grab the lone survivor of
his mother's murder rampage.
   Now in his 20s, Lehman has left acting and plays with a
funk-rock band.
   2. Warrington Gillette, the evil killer in ``Part 2,'' majored
in economics at Villanova University. He studied acting with Lee
Strasberg in New York before going to California where he joined
the Hollywood Stunt Man's Association. He's worked in comedy
workshops, did a movie documentary on Saratoga, N.Y., and has
appeared on the TV soap opera, ``General Hospital.''
   3. Richard Brooker, Jason in the 3D version, is a professional
trapeze artist who has appeared in cirucuses throughout the world.
He also does high wire, juggles and works on the trampoline. He
studied acting at such theater companies as The Stage and Riverside
Studio and has appeared in commercials.
   4. Ted White, a stunt man and actor who played Jason in ``Part
IV,'' had never seen a ``Friday the 13th'' movie. His credits
include ``The Creature From the Black Lagoon.''
   5. Richard Wieand, who plays a paramedic posing as Jason in
``Part V,'' does soap operas and commercials.
   In an interview with People magazine, he talked about his
audition for the part: ``The director told me to stare at an empty
desk and react as if I saw my son laying there hacked to bits.''
   6. C.J. Graham, who managed a nightclub, was the sixth Jason. He
got the part after portraying Jason for a club performance by an
illusionist who was a friend of the company that did special
effects for the ``Friday the 13th'' movies. He suggested Graham,
who had no acting experience, as the next Jason. 7. Kane Hodder, a
stunt coordinator, stunt man and actor, has performed stunts in
over 25 movies and more than 40 TV shows. He might be the last
Jason, but who knows?
