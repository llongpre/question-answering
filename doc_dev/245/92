   Some Christian activists say they
will vigorously oppose a Universal Pictures movie based on a book
in which Jesus is portrayed as a wimp who lusts after a prostitute.
   ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' called a look at the human
side of Jesus, was shot in Morocco last fall. It stars Willem Dafoe
as Jesus, Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene and Harvey Keitel as
Judas Iscariot.
   Scheduled for release in September, the movie is based on Greek
author Nikos Kazantzakis' 1955 book ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' which was condemned as heretical by the Greek Orthodox
Church.
   In a section of the book that troubles some conservative
Christians, Satan tempts Jesus with lust for Mary Magdalene, a
prostitute who became one of his followers. In another, Jesus
apparently ponders homosexuality.
   ``I don't see how a producer can stay true to the book and not
come out with a movie that is offensive to the Christian community.
The book is shot through with contradictions of the scriptures,''
said the Rev. Donald Wildmon, a United Methodist minister who heads
the American Family Association in Tupelo, Miss., which monitors
television shows and films.
   ``We're trying to head the movie off at the pass so it's not
blasphemous,'' said Ted Baehr, editor of an Atlanta-based Christian
newsletter that monitors theatrical films.
   Only Martin Scorsese, who is editing the film in New York, knows
what's in the final version, and ``he doesn't talk to any press at
all when he's editing, on any movie,'' said spokeswoman Marion
Billings.
   Scorsese, who directed ``Taxi Driver'' and ``Raging Bull,'' once
studied for the priesthood.
   ``This is a film that I've wanted to make for 15 years, both as
a filmmaker and Christian,'' he said in a statement. ``I'm making a
deeply religious film which is an affirmation of faith, and I ask
everyone not to judge my film until they see it.''
   Universal Pictures has hired a born-again Christian marketing
consultant, Tim Penland, who advised on the films ``Chariots of
Fire'' and ``The Mission,'' to help ward off controversy.
   ``I think there's an awful lot of interest in this movie in the
Christian community, and there's paranoia about what it contains,''
Penland said Thursday.
   Wildmon said a sacrilegious film would provoke a protest against
Universal and its parent company, MCA.
   ``We will be prepared to fight it with everything we've got. And
it would be an easy battle to win,'' Wildmon said.
   The Rev. John Probst, a Baptist minister whose Media Focus group
offers Bible study classes at studios and networks, has objected to
the portrayal of Jesus as ``a wimpy, almost milquetoast''
character. He has asked Christians to write Tom Pollock, chairman
of the MCA motion picture group, with their concerns.
   ``The attempt of this movie is not to be prurient about Jesus,''
Pollock said. ``This is one of our great filmmakers, and to cast
the film as sacrilegious before anyone has seen it is unfair.''
