   ``Rain Man,'' the story of a conniving car
salesman who learns to love his autistic brother, won the Oscar as
best picture Wednesday night and brought top honors to actor Dustin
Hoffman and director Barry Levinson. Jodie Foster, the victim of a
gang rape in ``The Accused,'' was named best actress of 1988.
   ``Rain Man'' also captured a prize for the original screenplay
Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow, bringing its total to four Oscars at
the 61st Academy Awards. Tying with three each were ``Dangerous
Liaisons,'' the ornate drama of drawing room seduction in
pre-Revolutionary France, and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' the
brilliant combination of live action and animation.
   Geena Davis, the free-spirited dog trainer in ``The Accidental
Tourist'' and Kevin Kline, the wild-eyed, oversexed safecracker in
``A Fish Called Wanda,'' were surprise winners in supporting roles.
   ``This is such a big deal!'' said Miss Foster, a former child
star who won her first Oscar.
   ``Cruelty might be human and it might be cultural, but it's not
acceptable, and that's what this movie is about,'' she said.
   ``I'm supposed to be jaded by this time, but I'm not,'' said
Hoffman, who also won the award for ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' in 1979.
He embraced loser Gene Hackman while on his way to the stage, where
he basked in a standing ovation in tribute to his meticulously
researched portrayal of an autistic savant.
   ``We tried to be as faithful as we could and be entertaining,''
said Levinson of the low-key ``Rain Man,'' which also starred Tom
Cruise as Hoffman's brother and has grossed $134.6 million at the
box office.
   ``This is really about two actors _ Dustin Hoffman and Tom
Cruise,'' Levinson said. ``If they didn't deliver the performanaces
they gave, I wouldn't be up here this evening.''
   ``First of all, I want to thank Anne Tyler for writing such a
wonderful book,'' Miss Davis said in accepting the first prize of
the night at the 61st Academy Awards. She has said she read Miss
Tyler's novel when it was first published and coveted the role of
Muriel.
   The award to Miss Davis drew yelps of approval from the audience
of 6,500 in the Shrine Auditorium, possibly because the favorites
appeared to have been Frances McDormand for ``Mississippi Burning''
and Sigourney Weaver for ``Working Girl.''
   ``This is astonishing,'' said Kline, who also had not been
considered a front-runner.
   ``Liaisons'' won Oscars for Christopher Hampton's adaptation of
his play and for art direction and costume design. ``Roger Rabbit''
won for film editing, sound effects and visual effects.
   ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' won for best score and
``Mississippi Burning'' for cinematography.``Bird'' won the Oscar
for best sound, and ``Beetlejuice'' for makeup.
   Named best song of the year was Carly Simon's ``Let the River
Run'' from ``Working Girl.'' The academy could find only three
songs to nominate this year instead of the usual five, and didn't
see fit to have them performed during the show.
   The year's best foreign language film was Denmark's ``Pelle the
Conqueror'' a grim tale about an exploited farmworker and his son.
   With Wednesday's ceremonies, the Academy dropped the traditional
line ``The winner is ...'' in favor of ``And the Oscar goes to
...'' The intent was to soften the sense of competition, but
several presenters, including Cher for best picture, reverted to
the old line.
   More than 1,500 early bird fans, many with sleeping bags and
food, had packed bleachers facing the four 24-foot Oscars that
guard the Moorish arches at the entrance to the auditorium.
   Hollywood's annual tribute to itself, televised live on ABC,
moved at its usual plodding place and was burdened with
heavy-handed production numbers. The industry relied heavily on
nostalgia, recruiting as presenters such old-time partners as James
Stewart and Kim Novak and Bob Hope and Lucille Ball.
   The 1989 season followed a record year at the box office. More
than 1 billion tickets were sold in 1988, with gross revenues of
$4.38 billion.

   Producer Allan Carr promised an infusion of glamor for the
awards show, whose Nielsen ratings have declined steeply over the
years.
   But the telecast opened with an embarrassing production number
that included a Snow White character who talked like Betty Boop and
accompanied actor Rob Lowe in a rendition of the rock song ``Proud
Mary'' amid dancing nightclub tables.
   Security was much in evidence as the time approached for the
ceremonies. One hundred Los Angeles police were on special
assignment at the event, augmenting the private security guards who
had been at the Shrine for five days. Said one of them: ``A lot of
people want in on the action, and we have to see that they don't
get it.''
   Last year traffic planning was a fiasco, forcing many
participants to leave their limos and walk blocks to the
auditorium. This year 75 officers from the State Department of
Transportation were assigned to the area, a couple of miles south
of downtown by the University of Southern California campus.
   Nominations for acting, directing, art direction and specialized
categories are handled by select branches and committees of Academy
members.
   All voting members of the Academy can participate in the best
picture nominations and may vote for the final awards in all
categories. Winners for best documentary feature, best animated
short film and best live-action short film are chosen by only those
members who have seen all the nominees.
