   ``Walker'' (MCA Home Video; VHS@Beta, $79.95; Rated R)
   
   ``Walker,'' based on a true story about an early American
incursion into Nicaragua, is one of those movies that flopped at
the box-office but sounds as if it might be an unappreciated gem
just waiting to be rediscovered on ideo.
   Unfortunately, even on the home screen, ``Walker'' is still a
flop _ though with its timely subject it can hardly fail to
generate some interest.
   The film, directed by Alex Cox, retells the story of William
Walker, a soldier of fortune who led a bloody invasion of Nicaragua
in the 1850s.
   Walker, as portrayed by Ed Harris, is a ruthless idealist, who
as he orders mass slaughters of civilians, mouths platitudes about
America's duty to ``protect our neighbors from oppression'' _ and
apparently believes what he's saying.
   According to the filmmakers, Walker sets out on his expedition
at the urging of Cornelius Vanderbilt, played here by Peter Boyle
as a flatulent, foul-mouthed old tyrant who wants to protect his
railroad line running through Nicaragua from rival nationalist
groups.
   The climax of the film is an impassioned speech Walker gives _
shortly before his one-man rule is toppled and he is executed _ in
which he tells the Nicaraguan people that ``America will never
leave you alone.''
   Chilling words, but Cox runs the contemporary angle into the
ground by littering the movie with deliberate anachronisms like
helicopters, cigarette machines and personal computers.
   Much of the dialogue and direction seems sloppy and confused,
and there hasn't been so much blood spilled on screen since ``The
Wild Bunch.''
   Oscar-winner Marlee Matlin has about five good minutes early on
as Walker's deaf girlfriend. But once she dies of cholera, both he
and the movie go downhill fast.

   ``The Lost Weekend,'' (MCA Home Entertainment; VHS@Beta, $59.95;
Not rated)
   
   It is fascinating and frightening to watch Ray Milland as the
literate, desperate alcoholic Don Birnam in ``The Lost Weekend.''
His performance earned him an Academy Award in Billy Wilder's 1945
movie, which also was named best picture.
   Milland and Jane Wyman are the film's stars, but alcohol is the
main character.
   Taken from the Charles Jackson novel of the same name, ``The
Lost Weekend'' shows three days in Birnam's life _ horrible drunken
days when Birnam sinks to the depths of his soul, tormented by his
failure as a writer.
   He rummages madly through his brother's apartment in search of a
bottle of whiskey he himself hid but lost, trudges relentlessly
through Manhattan in search of an open shop to pawn his typewriter.
In one of the film's saddest moments, he chooses a sip from his
tumbler of liquor over the kiss of Helen (Wyman), who loves him.
   Still, Birnam, who talks of writing a novel called ``The
Bottle,'' is witty and eloquent. Drink, he tells a bartender, may
shrink his liver and pickle his kidney. ``But what does it do to my
mind? It tosses the sandbags overboard so the balloon can soar.''
   It makes no difference that the movie is 43 years old, or that
it's in black and white _ even today there could be no more
persuasive advertisement against alcohol abuse.
