   Mikhail Baryshnikov may feel even more snug
as a bug after getting rave reviews for his part in the
Broadway-bound version of Franz Kafka's ``Metamorphosis'' playing at
Duke University.
   Tony Brown of The Charlotte Observer, the state's largest
newspaper, called the dancer's stage acting debut as a man
transformed into a giant insect ``powerful.''
   ``The surprise is that Baryshnikov _ in his first acting role in
which he does not play a dancer _ does so well in the speaking
parts,'' Brown added.
   Jim Wise of the Durham Morning Herald said the 41-year-old dance
superstar ``does make an engaging bug. A sympathetic one, even. More
importantly, a metaphorical one, which engages a viewer's
fellow-feeling and renders `Metamorphosis,' surreal as it is, a
moving expression of human feeling.''
   Not that the production needed favorable reviews to do good
business at the 640-seat Reynolds Industries Theater at Duke. The
run, which ends Feb. 25, has been sold out for weeks.
   ``Metamorphosis'' opens on Broadway on March 6 at the Ethel
Barrymore Theater.

   Actor Larry Hagman can have a helipad if
he keeps it quiet during prime time, but the ``Dallas'' star might
need J.R. Ewing's influence to swing the observation tower he's
seeking for his new home.
   The Ventura County Planning Commission granted Hagman's helipad
request Thursday despite some neighbors' opposition. The panel,
however, refused to approve a zoning variance allowing him to build
a 40-foot observation tower with an unobstructed view of the
countryside.
   Hagman, who plays the villainous J.R. Ewing on ``Dallas,'' and
his wife, Maj, bought close to 30 acres north of Ojai in Ventura
County and plan to build a 20,000-square-foot, split-level home.
   About 200 County Government Center workers took their lunch
breaks about the time the hearing for Hagman was finished in an
effort to get his autograph.

   Maytag's lonely repairman will be new, but he
still won't have much to do. After 21 years, actor Jesse White is
giving up the ``Old Lonely'' character to actor Gordon Jump.
   In one of the longest-running advertising campaigns on
television, White made the Maytag repairman into a symbol of
dependability. White first appeared as the repairman in 1967 and in
68 different commercials portrayed the man who never has anything to
do because Maytags just don't break down.
   White is becoming a consultant to Maytag. ``We're moving him
up,'' said company spokeswoman Sue Martin.
   ``I will be like a roving goodwill ambassador for the next three
years,'' White said by telephone from Calgary, Canada, where he is
appearing in the play ``Your Place Or Mine'' at the Stage West
dinner theater.
   Jump is best known for his portrayal of bumbling radio station
manager Arthur Carlson on the television comedy series ``WKRP in
Cincinnati.''
   White joked that someone could be lonely just so long.
   ``How much can you take?'' he said. ``I get so lonely, I go to
the airport just to get searched.''

   A 25-year-old woman has filed a lawsuit accusing
actor Tony Curtis of sexually harassing her and forcing her
dismissal from an art gallery that sells his paintings.
   Nalani Markell, who worked as Curtis' art assistant after he
began painting in recent years, named him and Center Art
Galleries-Hawaii in a lawsuit filed Friday in Honolulu Circuit Court.
   She claimed that she repeatedly rejected Curtis' sexual advances
while she lived in his Kahala home and worked in his studio, and was
given no reason for her dismissal from the gallery.
   Curtis, 63, denied the accusations.
   The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission earlier
rejected a similiar complaint filed by Markell against the gallery.
   ``None of the employees interviewed were aware of sexual
harassment in the workplace,'' Deborah W. Randall, Honolulu director
of the EEOC, wrote then, adding that Markell was fired because she
disagreed with Curtis about how to handle a telephone call.

   Gregory Hines told 200 students who saw a
screening of his new movie, ``Tap,'' that they can learn some things
from his character, Max Washington, who must decide between a career
as a dancer or one as a criminal.
   ``Max confronts many of these same issues'' facing the students
in the near future, said Hines, whose previous films include ``White
Nights'' with Mikhail Baryshnikov and ``Running Scared'' with Billy
Crystal.
   ``It's good to start (a career) now,'' Hines told the students
earlier this week. ``In 10 years, you'll have some craft behind you.
If you want it, you have to be aggressive and make it happen for
yourself.''
   Hines also offered the students a warning: if you want to become
a performer, be ready to make some sacrifices and hard choices along
the way.

   Walter Annenberg, publisher and former
ambassador to Great Britain, has pledged $10 million to his alma
mater, the University of Pennsylvania.
   University President Sheldon Hackney said a committee of Penn
administrators decided the entire amount would go to the school's
history department. Annenberg, the former owner of TV Guide
magazine, agreed to the choice.
   The money will finance four professorships, eight fellowships, a
visiting chair for distinguished international scholars and public
figures, and a fund for special projects, said Hugo Sonnenschein,
dean of arts and sciences.
   Annenberg and his wife, Leonore, are both emeritus trustees of
the university. Penn's school of communications bears the Annenberg
name, as does the universty's performing arts complex, because of
previous gifts.
   Annenberg, 80, is a close friend of former President Reagan, and
served as ambassador to Great Britain during the Nixon
administration.
   Last year, Annenberg sold his publishing company, Triangle
Publications, to Rupert Murdoch for $3.2 billion.
