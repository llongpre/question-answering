It took writer-director Bobby Roth 10 years to make "The Man Inside" -- a 
fact-based melodrama about West German reporter Gunter Wallraff and his 
infiltration of a reactionary tabloid -- and the effort shows. 
</P>
<P>
There's something worked-over, almost perfunctory about the film (AMC Century 
14 and Beverly Center Cineplex). It's sleek, it's fast, but it has a hollow, 
exhausted feel. It's less a film than a dream of a film, an obsession that 
eluded Roth, but which, with incredible stubbornness and will power, he kept 
seizing and renewing. 
</P>
<P>
Set in 1975, it's about the efforts of left-wing, "outlaw" investigative 
journalist Wallraff (the movie's only non-fictitious name) to crack the shield 
of West Germany's most influential tabloid, Der Bilt -- here called "The 
Standard." 
</P>
<P>
Wallraff, played by Jurgen Prochnow of "Das Boot," is a specialist in false 
papers and disguises. Here, he smuggles himself into the paper and becomes, 
with unusual rapidity, one of its ace reporters, the darling of its scowling, 
Sturm und Drang editor Schroeter (Dieter Laser), who helps school him in the 
art of slick, shoddy, callous reporting and flagrant propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
The Standard has ties to West Germany's security chief, and it's hinted that a 
neo-fascist conspiracy fuels its editorial policy. Wallraff burrows into that 
conspiracy even as the Standard and the security apparatus are outside, unaware 
of his penetration, systematically trying to hunt him down. 
</P>
<P>
The movie has the rhythm and shape of docudrama, but the look and sound of 
stripped-down kitsch. The Standard -- supposedly West Germany's most popular 
tabloid -- has unusually Spartan quarters. Four star reporters, including 
Wallraff and fellow ace Henry Tobel (Peter Coyote), are grouped around a sort 
of mass conference desk, where they're constantly subjected to the perfervid 
abuse and menacing affections of editor Schroeter, who dispenses his favors 
through story length ("20 lines" is a mild rebuke, "40 lines" a reward), orders 
his staff to attack the poor and different, hail the rich and link up every 
conceivable strain of dissent with the Baader-Meinhof Gang. 
</P>
<P>
Like Costa-Gavras -- a heavy influence here -- Roth likes to suggest homosexual 
motivations in his villains; both Schroeter and Tobel seem to fall in love with 
Wallraff on sight. Coyote seizes on this undercurrent. In a cast loaded with 
top international names, including Prochnow, Nathalie Baye, Monique van de Ven 
and Philip Anglim, his is the only performance with surprises. When Tobel 
seizes Wallraff's hand after a chess game, there's something startlingly raw in 
his face, grim and wolfish against the racy chrome of the film's plot. 
</P>
<P>
In "Heartbreakers," also with Coyote -- and an actor, Nick Mancuso, who 
somewhat resembles Prochnow -- Roth zeroes in on similar, if subconscious, male 
bonding in the Los Angeles art world. "Heartbreakers" was serious and offbeat, 
but it had a major flaw, repeated here: incredibly sparse dialogue -- so spare 
it becomes almost purely functional. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Man Inside," where the characters are supposed to be journalists and 
writers, this terseness seems even more willed and anachronistic. People don't 
talk this way -- in laconic four- or five-word sentences and bursts of 
exclamatory exposition -- unless they're in "Dragnet," a post-1980 movie script 
or they've just come from the dentist. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, shorn of its topicality, probably had to revive itself by 
emphasizing the psychological drive at its core: the mingled terror and 
fascination of a man embraced by people he's convinced are his enemies, the 
dilemma of a rogue of integrity loose in the belly of the beast. But "The Man 
Inside" (rated PG, despite adult themes) doesn't get far enough inside itself. 
Initially idealistic and gutsy, it's become a metallic husk: the movie outside.
