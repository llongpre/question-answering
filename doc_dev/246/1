   ``Work to Start At Once on Two Forks Reservoir,''
proclaimed a headline in The Denver Post 61 years ago, touting a
project that would free the city from worry about future water
supplies.
   That 1928 report proved to be a bit optimistic. Not an ounce of
concrete has been poured at the proposed dam site on the South
Platte River 25 miles southwest of Denver.
   And now the federal Environmental Protection Agency may be about
to scuttle the dam, whose cost has ballooned from $6 million in
1928 to current estimates of $500 million to $1 billion.
   In an unusual move, EPA Administrator William Reilly began the
veto process on the 1.1 million acre-foot dam project March 24. He
said it simply was too costly environmentally: It would inundate a
gold-medal trout stream and possibly damage a Nebraska wildlife
habitat.
   Dam supporters can make a final appeal to save the project. EPA
spokesman Rich Lathrop said the review process could continue
through December.
   Although the city has adequate supplies at least through the
next quarter century, its leaders haven't decided where to turn for
water beyond that if Two Forks is defeated.
   ``We planned well and there's no crisis,'' said Monte Pascoe,
president of the Denver Water Board, which spent decades developing
the proposal.``We're trying to plan equally well for the next 25
years, and we're being told we can't do that.''
   The city currently diverts mountain water across the Continental
Divide from the Rockies' Western Slope.
   The dam has been touted by supporters as the best solution to
the area's future water needs.
   Opponents, such as National Audubon Society President Peter
Berle, have called the dam an ``environmental and economic
monstrosity'' that would destroy scenic Cheesman Canyon in Colorado.
   They also say it would alter the South Platte's flow downstream
into Nebraska and affect fragile habitat for 240 species of
migrating birds, including the endangered whooping crane and the
sandhill crane.
   Two Forks, just downstream from the confluence of the South
Platte and its North Fork, would stand 615 feet _ about half the
height of the Empire State Building _ and would be 1,700 feet long,
and from 160 to 467 feet thick. By comparison, Hoover Dam, one of
the highest concrete dams in the world, is 726 feet tall astride
the Colorado River and 1,244 feet long with a 660-foot thick
concrete base.
   Hoover Dam's reservoir, Lake Mead, on the Arizona-Nevada border,
stores about 29.7 million acre-feet of water _ one acre-foot is
enough water to cover one acre to a depth of one foot _ and covers
about 255 square miles.
   Two Forks, however, would store only 1.1 million acre-feet. It
would cover 13.28 square miles and the small community of Deckers.
   Denver leaders have considered a dam on the river since 1896 and
the city began acquiring land for the project in 1923.
   The most recent attempt to build a dam intensified in 1981 when
the Denver Water Board asked the Army Corps of Engineers to study
the dam's potential environmental impact.
   In 1986, the board and the Metropolitan Water Providers, a group
of 42 suburban water suppliers, formally applied for a construction
permit.
   The Corps issued a draft environmental impact assessment in 1987
that identified Two Forks as the most environmentally damaging of
seven proposed dams on the river, but it also said Two Forks was
the most cost-effective way to meet the area's water needs into the
21st century.
   Metropolitan officials are making contingency plans in addition
to continuing the fight for Two Forks, and the Denver Water Board
last week formalized water restrictions. Under the new policy,
Denver may decide each September whether to restrict additional
water connections outside city limits, and may implement rate
increases in Denver and the suburbs to which it sells water.
   Most of the cities in the metropolitan area purchase water from
Denver.
   Pascoe said the board has an adequate supply to meet needs in
Denver in the immediate future but ``there's no room for error.''
   ``We honestly don't think other supplies for water will be very
easy to find,'' he said.
