   President Turgut Ozal cut the flow of
the Euphrates River with the push of a button Saturday, diverting
its waters to a reservoir and raising fears of tension with
Turkey's arid downstream neighbors.
   ``Starting with the name of Allah all-forgiving and for the
benefit of our people,'' Ozal said as he pushed the button at the
end of a cord extending from a channel at the giant Ataturk dam.
   During the one-month stoppage, Syria and Iraq will get 75
percent less water from the tributaries of the Euphrates, the
1,460-mile-long river that has been the lifeblood throughout
history for the area, once ancient Mesopotamia. The river already
slows to become a sluggish stream before joining the Tigris at the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway in Iraq and emptying into the Persian Gulf.
   Commando forces stood guard on heights in the reservoir area
while 10,000 people watched the ceremony at the dam site about 60
miles north of the Syrian border.
   White, blue and pink clouds mushroomed from smoke bombs exploded
on the opposite side of the river during the ceremony, as water
gushed down the middle of the dam's three derivation channels.
   Once the Southeast Anatolia project of 15 dams and 18
hydroelectric power plants is completed, Turkey will have a
stranglehold on both the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.
   But in a speech, Ozal promised Syria and Iraq that ``Turkey
would never use the water of Euphrates as a threat.''
   ``This was a technical necessity but we have taken all possible
care not to cause any damage to our neighbors,'' Ozal said.
   Ozal proposed that Turkey's neighbors invest together in
infrastructure projects as he said European countries had done. He
did not give details.
   Turkey views the dam and a chain of others to be built in the
future as crucial for the economic development of its backward
southeastern region, providing much-needed electricity and water
for crop irrigation.
   It says the monthlong stoppage of water will allow engineers to
fill a reservoir to a height of 396 feet and build a concrete plug
for a diversion channel as part of the construction project.
   Syria is more dependent than Iraq on the river, because Iraq
also has the Tigris running through its territory. But being
upstream, Syria could keep more of the Euphrates waters in its own
reservoirs and allow a trickle to Iraq.
   Syria has made no public statement on the water cut. Iraq said
it would send a senior envoy to Ankara on Sunday to discuss
problems arising from the reduction in the Euphrates flow.
   Iraq sent its deputy foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoun, to Turkey
last month to ask for a cut in the Euphrates flow of two weeks
instead of the planned one month. Turkey said two weeks was not
enough time.
   Hamdoun told reporters that the cutoff would not provoke a
full-blown crisis in Iraqi agriculture, but it would still cause
damage in some areas.
   Turkish officials have taken an Iraqi delegation to the dam
construction site to explain the situation, Foreign Ministry
officials said.
   Turks maintain that since November they have released extra
water to Syria and Iraq, to allow them to store water in their
reservoirs for use during the shortfall.
   A state waterworks official at the dam site said that since
November, Turkey had released 4.42 billion cubic yards of water
downstream, and 1.1 billion cubic yards of it had been allowed into
Iraq by Syria.
   Ozal said the construction of the massive dam by Turkish workers
and engineers showed ``what we are capable of doing.''
   There has been talk in newspapers and diplomatic circles of
possible future strains among the countries of the mostly arid
region since Ozal said last summer in an off-the-cuff remark that
Turkey could block the Euphrates River waters to punish Syria for
providing support to Kurdish guerrillas waging war for independence
in southeast Turkey.
   When completed in 2006, the Southeast Anatolia project will
produce 22 billion kwh of electricity annually and irrigate an area
of 4 million acres.
   The additional energy should double the yield of many crops in
Turkey and produce $5 billion worth of surplus in the country,
which is agriculturally self-sufficient, officials say.
   The first of the Ataturk dam's eight electricity-generating
units is scheduled to go into operation May 1991.
