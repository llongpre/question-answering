   A series of explosions at a space shuttle
fuel plant rocked this southern Nevada city Wednesday, destroying
the facility and a marshmallow plant, killing at least one person,
injuring 96 and leaving scores of others missing.
   Flames and orange smoke rose 100 feet into the sky and buildings
shook 10 miles away in Las Vegas after the midday explosions at the
Pacific Engineering &amp; Production Co. of Nevada. The plant
manufactures ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in fuel for the
shuttle's solid rocket boosters, but NASA said the accident was not
expected to delay resumption of shuttle flights.
   ``What we see is pretty much total devastation,'' said Fred
Gibson, an executive at the plant.
   All roads to Henderson, a town of 25,000 midway between Las
Vegas and Hoover Dam, were closed because of concern that toxic
gases might escape.
   At the command post near the blast site, Clark County Fire
Spokesman Mark Hector said at least one person had been killed.
   Emergency workers were forced to stand by for fear of additional
explosions. State records showed 125 people worked at Pacific while
the next-door Kid Marshmallow Plant employed 85, but few employees
of either plant had been seen at hospitals, authorities said.
   ``There are people out there who are probably dying,'' said
Janet Smith, a spokeswoman for Mercy Ambulance in Las Vegas, whose
company dispatched ambulances to the site. ``This is going to be a
daylong and nightlong event because no fire unit has been out there.
   ``People are out there on the desert wandering aimlessly'' if
they were lucky enough to have escaped, she said.
   David Coats, administrator of Saint Rose de Lima Hospital, said
96 injured people had been brought in. He said most of the injuries
were minor but at least three were critical.
   Gibson, asked if toxic products could have leaked, said the
plant's ammonia tanks could not be seen. ``We can't tell at the
moment whether these tanks are secure.''
   ``One of our pieces of equipment malfunctioned and caught on
fire. The fire spread quickly and there was an explosion,'' Gibson
said. At least two blasts followed the main blast within seconds.
   He said the smoke was so thick he couldn't see if any of
Pacific's buildings were still standing. ``I suspect there are
none,'' Gibson said.
   Emergency workers warned residents away from the area as smoke
billowed across the entire Las Vegas Valley. All schools in the
area were evacuated and closed for the day, United Blood Services
of Las Vegas made an emergency appeal for contributions to help
victims, and hospital workers were called in or put on standby
throughout the area.
   One victim with an open skull fracture was being flown by
helicopter to Valley Hospital in Las Vegas, said Tina Ashcraft,
Life Flight helicopter dispatcher.
   ``Our windows blew out. It blew the frame off the door. We are
probably five or six miles away. The thing is on fire,'' said Lee
Hall, secretary at the Henderson Convalescent Hospital.
   Ms. Hall said hospital officials were checking for injured
patients and employees. ``A window blew up in somebody's face,''
she said.
   Several people injured in the blast were taken to nearby Saint
Rose De Lima Hospital, where the explosion also shattered windows,
hospital spokeswoman Marcia Hawkins said.
   Ms. Hawkins said many patients were cut and bruised.
   ``The windows blew. The workers are helping the patients,'' Ms.
Hawkins said. ``It's near here and all we can see is the black
cloud of smoke.''
   In Las Vegas, buildings shook and a huge plume of smoke was
visible in the air. People leaving offices for the noon hour stood
on the streets, gawking at the smoke.
   A worker at Hoover Dam, Bob Baker, said he was deep inside the
dam when the blast rattled windows at the power plant in the belly
of the facility. He did not feel the dam itself shake.
   Jay Herman, an engineer who was less than two miles from the
plant site, said he heard three blasts, the first ``worse than any
sonic boom. I thought it was a plane crash but there was too much
smoke.''
   He said the second blast five minutes later `` almost knocked us
over'' and when the third hit, he crawled under a desk. ``I thought
it was a nuclear bomb.''
   NASA said in Washington that Pacific Engineering provides the
ammonium perchlorate to Morton Thiokol, NASA's prime contractor for
the motors, as well as to some Department of Defense programs.
   Don Amitor, a spokesman for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., said Morton-Thiokol had enough ammonium
perchlorate in supply for the next five shuttle launches. Under the
present schedule, the fifth launch would be in mid-1989.
   Amidor said a Kerr-McGee plant, also in Henderson, is capable of
making enough ammonium perchlorate for boosters to support eight
space shuttle flights a year.
