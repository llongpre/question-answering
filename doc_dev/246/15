   Those who knew him and the global works of
his construction dynasty took stock on Wednesday of the energetic
life of master-builder Stephen Bechtel Sr.
   ``This guy was a builder,'' said former San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto. ``This was a guy who moved the Earth.''
   Bechtel, 88, died Tuesday in Merritt Peralta Medical Center in
Oakland after a brief illness.
   From the construction business his father built out of the ashes
of San Francisco's earthquake of 1906, Bechtel created one of the
world's largest engineering and construction firms, the privately
held Bechtel Group Inc.
   The company built Hoover Dam, pipelines, mines, whole seaports
and harbors, scores of hotels, towering buildings and transportation
systems on seven continents. Among its projects still under
construction is Jubail, an entire Saudi Arabian city of 250,000.
   In World War II, a Bechtel project turned out 560 ships for the
Navy.
   Fortune Magazine called him ``the boldest and maybe the biggest
builder in the world.''
   He retired as board chairman in 1965 but continued as senior
director and roving ambassador for the company. He never completely
retired.
   ``My father was a remarkable man,'' said Stephen Bechtel Jr., who
took over as chairman of Bechtel Group Inc. ``He was also the best
of fathers.''
   Born in Aurora, Ind., in 1900, Stephen Davison Bechtel was a
world business leader who knew presidents, prime ministers and kings
on a first-name basis.
   Bechtel in 1949 overheard an oil company executive remark that a
pipeline from Alberta, Canada, across the Rockies to the Pacific was
a great idea. Bechtel sketched out the plan on the tablecloth.
   A few years later, 80,000 barrels of oil flowed through the
718-mile Canadian Trans-Mountain Pipeline. It was called one of the
most remarkable pipeline engineering feats in history.
   Bechtel managed construction of the four-county Bay Area Rapid
Transit system, and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which
Bechtel commuted over from his Oakland home every working day.
   Despite the crush of bridge traffic, which sets most motorists
griping, Bechtel thought it was quite a nice thing to do every day
on the way to his 32nd-floor office in the company's San Francisco
headquarters.
   ``It's a very pleasant ride, and traffic isn't that bad'' he told
a reporter in a rare interview.
   Bechtel was one of the University of California at Berkeley's
most successful dropouts. In a hurry to get on with his vision, he
quit college in 1920, but the university named him Alumnus of the
Year in 1952.
   Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman hailed Bechtel's ``loyalty
and generosity'' to the university, particularly in establishing a
$6.3 million engineering center.
   Bechtel leaves his widow, Laura, and their two children, Stephen
and Barbara Bechtel Davies. Funeral services were private.
