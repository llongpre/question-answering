  [Text] Zhengzhou, May 28 (XINHUA) -- Four Chinese and 
foreign companies have won the bid for three major parts of the 
World Bank financed Xiaolangdi water control dam construction 
project on the middle reaches of the Yellow River. 
  The Inpergilo company of Italy, the No. 14 Water Conservancy 
and Hydroelectric Engineering Bureau of China, and Dumiz Company 
of France and the No. 6 Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric 
Engineering Bureau of China, which are selected among more than 
30 Chinese and foreign companies, have been given the jobs of 
building the dam, culverts and spillways, and facilities for 
generating electricity. 
  They have formed two international joint management groups 
to 
achieve best effect and will soon start work on the construction 
site. 
  Xiaolangdi water control dam is among the first of its kind 
in China to select builders through international bidding and 
the practice is in accordance with requirements of the World 
Bank. 
  Earlier reports also showed that the Xiaolangdi water 
control 
project, situated 40 km north of Luoyang city, Henan Province, 
has won a loan of 570 million U.S. dollars from the World Bank. 
  As a project to introduce World Bank loans, the Xiaolangdi 
water control dam has received the assessment of 15 delegations 
sent by the World Bank since 1988. 
  Through concerted efforts from Chinese and foreign experts, 
the Xiaolangdi Dam is believed to have basically met the 
requirements for appraisal from the World Bank in aspects such 
as engineering technology, dam safety, relocation of people, 
budgetary estimates of projects, economic and financial 
analysis, consultancy of supervised management in construction, 
training program of technical workers, and the drafting of the 
tender documents. 
  Preparatory work for the Xiaolangdi water control project, 
which was initiated in September 1991, has been completed ahead 
of schedule after two years' efforts from 15,000 builders. 
  The preparatory work has cost about 1.2 billion yuan (about 
137 million U.S. dollars). It includes facilities for 
transport, water and electricity supplies, telecommunications 
and facilities to house the construction workers, according to 
earlier reports. 
  The relocation of the first 10,000 local residents in the 
construction area -- mainly in Jiyuan and Mengjin Counties of 
central China's Henan Province -- has also come to an end, with 
full support from local governments and farmers concerned. At 
the same time, the Ministry of Water Resources has also 
established a department in charge of construction and a 
department responsible for supervised management in accordance 
with international common practices, as well as management 
information system of projects. 
  More than 300 supervisory engineers have been brought in 
from 
across the country to attend training courses where lectures are 
given by World Bank officials. 
  When completed, the Xiaolangdi water control project will be 
the largest conservancy works on the Yellow River and will be 
China's second biggest after the Three Gorges Dam on the Chang 
Jiang. It will play an important role in diverting the Yellow 
River flow, preventing floods, generating power and controlling 
sediment, according to experts. 
  The experts say that the entire project, which will take 11 
years to finish, together with other reservoirs nearby, will 
enable the lower reaches of the Yellow River to absorb a flood 
of a magnitude that occurs only once in one thousand years.
