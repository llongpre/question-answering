   Finally, the corps proceeded.
   The decision to build the dam was vindicated before construction
was completed, Green says. In 1982, fire destroyed the Heppner Post
Office, the store next door and a vacant building near the center of
town. None could have been rebuilt under the FEMA restriction.
   Ed Hiemstra remains one of the most outspoken opponents of the
Willow Creek Dam. From his back yard, he has a clear view of the
dam's wet face.
   ``We can see it's disintegrating, but they're not telling us
anything,'' he complains. ``They were looking for a sparsely settled
area so they could experiment with this new type of dam, and now
we're stuck with it.''
   It was the first in the world to employ a quick and inexpensive
construction technique in which concrete is built up in layers like
a cake instead of molded and slabbed.
   Twenty dams have been built since the roller compacted concrete
construction (RCC) method was pioneered at Willow Creek. And
engineers are still perfecting the technique.
   As Ronnie M. Lemons wrote in the October 1988 issue of ``Civil
Engineering'' magazine, ``Even with the technology as it exists
today, RCC dams leak...As yet there is no consensus on how to stop
those leaks.''
   When it first was filled in 1983, the Willow Creek Dam leaked
nearly 3,000 gallons a minute. A $2 million grouting project in 1984
reduced the leakage by 95 percent.
   A greater problem than leaking, however, may be the corrosion of
the dam from within.
   In 1984, a study by environmental engineer William Funk of the
Washington State University Water Research Center predicted water
quality problems at Willow Creek.
   With experience in other cattle and sheep-feeding areas, Funk
could predict a watershed rich with the kind of nutrients that can
destroy concrete. While not opposed to the dam, he said its
construction weighed heavily on his mind.
   ``I expected to see a real mess there,'' he says.
   Corps scientists were surprised to find water quality
deteriorating more rapidly and dramatically than Funk had
anticipated. After four years of study, they still are not sure what
it all means.
   ``We're not alarmed, but we are concerned,'' says Doug Larson, a
lake scientist who has spent years studying the waters behind Willow
Creek Dam.
   ``We have all the compounds present that can deteriorate
concrete. We just don't know how intense they are. The big question
is: How quickly is this happening?''
   He says the answers are at least eight months away. Consultants
are studying the geochemical processes occurring in the dam and the
reservoir, while others are analyzing the presence of volatile
methane gases and the effect of concrete-corroding acids.
   ``The corps' reputation and future is on the line,'' says Cliff
Green. ``They can't say, `You've got a problem and it may break _
send us a post card.' They have to do something.''
   David Sykes, publisher of the Gazette-Times newspaper, says the
corps already has lost credibility among the residents of Heppner.
   In an angry editorial, Sykes demanded an independent analysis of
the dam's safety.
   ``We need more than a dose of the corps' publicity machine,''
Sykes wrote. ``We need some action, to tell the truth, and it should
come from our elected representatives.
   ``Word is out that the Willow Creek Dam is sick. The Corps of
Engineers says everything is fine. But we, the people of Heppner,
need a second opinion.''
