   Environmentalists are applauding President
Bush's budget emphasis on repairing damage caused by construction
of dams and other federal water projects.
   ``The president said he wanted to be known as the environmental
president,'' David Campbell, an economist with the Wildlife
Federation, said Monday. ``This actually is a fairly good start.''
   ``We've been arguing for years that both the Corps of Engineers
and the Bureau of Reclamation have overdue mitigation,'' he said.
``We should be redirecting these agency budgets from all this
harmful construction into something more environmentally
beneficial.''
   The $3.2 billion for the 1991 fiscal year for the Army Corps of
Engineers _ about the same as sought last year _ designates several
million dollars for environmental repairs and continues funding for
construction projects under way, but offers no money for new
projects.
   ``The civil works program and budget reflect the new emphasis
placed by the administration on maintaining and restoring the
environment,'' the corps said in its explanation of the budget.
   Major provisions addressing environmental concerns are:
   _$16 million for construction of juvenile fish passage
facilities on the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington, Oregon
and Idaho.
   _$20 million to begin acquisition of 88,000 acres to mitigate
environmental losses caused by construction of the
Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Project in Alabama and Mississippi.
   _$13 million to plan repairs to the environment damaged by
construction of Richard B. Russell Lake in South Carolina and
Georgia, and areas of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri after
navigational improvements were made on the Missouri River.
   Campbell noted Congress gave the administration authority in
1986 to seek federal funds for the next five years to buy private
land around the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway for environmental
restoration, but the administration didn't act until this year's
budget _ the last year of the authorization.
   Campbell estimated $20 million should be enough to acquire about
47,000 acres this year.
   The fisheries on the Columbia River also are desperately needed
to restore salmon to the waterway which Campbell called ``decimated
by the dam-builders,'' who started building on the river in 1935.
   The president has asked for $1.039 billion, including $616
million in construction outlays, for the Bureau of Reclamation, an
agency within the Interior Department that assists in the
construction of irrigation reservoirs in the arid West.
   The proposal calls for a halt to federal spending on the
Garrison Diversion Unit in North Dakota, which was authorized by
Congress in 1965 to provide water to the eastern section of the
state through canals and rivers.
   The president's budget calls Garrison is ``an uneconomic and
environmentally destructive project which would require in excess
of $1 billion to complete.''
   No major new construction starts are proposed. However, dam
safety work and environmental damage mitigation at existing
projects, and most water projects already in construction would
receive continued funding.
