   Supporters of the proposed Two Forks Dam in
Colorado say they may go to court to challenge a decision by
federal environmental officials to kill the project.
   If the veto of the dam by the Environmental Protection Agency is
sustained, it could set a precedent for similar projects, they
said.
   William H. Van Schooneveld, chairman of the Metropolitan Water
Providers that sponsored the Colorado dam, said, ``This decision
affects not just Denver, but it may be the end of all big water
projects. If EPA can veto this, there really isn't any project that
anybody can develop that can pass the EPA.''
   ``There are a lot of grounds for (a federal court) appeal,'' he
said.
   Conservationists hailed the EPA action.
   Hope Babcock, general counsel for the National Audubon Society,
said, ``The era of building these enormous projects is over.''
   EPA announced the veto of the dam Friday night, confirming
earlier unofficial reports.
   The proposed Two Forks Dam would be the largest non-federal
water project in the West. It had been supported by Reagan
administration officials.
   Assistant EPA administrator for water, LaJuana S. Wilcher,
announced Friday she would uphold the recommendation of EPA's
Denver office to bar construction of the 615-foot dam just
downstream of the confluence of the South Platte River and its
North Fork.
   The city of Denver and 40 suburban water providers sought
approval to construct a 359-billion gallon reservoir southwest of
Denver to meet water needs well into the next century. The Army
Corps of Engineers said in March 1989 it would grant a permit to
dam the river, subject to EPA review.
   Conservationists opposed the project because it called for
flooding 30 miles of scenic river and ruining 14 miles of top-class
trout fishing.
   Denver proposed a smaller, 147-billion gallon reservoir and a
package of measures aimed at minimizing harmful environmental
effects.
   ``The applicants made a good-faith effort to downscale the
project size and compensate for the loss of wetlands and aquatic
resources,'' Wilcher said.
   ``However, the smaller project would still flood 24 miles of
freely flowing, scenic stream and almost 11 miles of gold medal
trout fishery. ... It would inundate an area of unquestionable
natural beauty that provides a diversity of fishing and
recreational opportunities and a rich aquatic habitat close to the
Denver metropolitan area.''
   The Army's environmental impact statement in 1988 identified
several other choices. Wilcher said EPA agreed that ``less
environmentally damaging, practicable alternatives exist,'' and the
agency would ``make every effort to provide timely comment and
guidance on other alternatives.''
   Big dams have made possible the growth of big cities and big
farms in the West. Critics say that too many water resources have
been diverted, threatening the balance of nature.
