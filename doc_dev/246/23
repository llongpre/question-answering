   Goose Prairie has been described as
``a bit of heaven,'' but residents fear a plan to enlarge a nearby
reservoir may sink the outskirts of their pristine haven in a
watery grave.
   Life in the Cascade Mountain village would be altered forever if
the Bumping Lake reservoir is expanded to more than 13 times its
present capacity in an effort to help drought-stricken Northwest
farmers, residents say.
   But after three decades of debate, Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash.,
who represents Bumping Lake and Goose Prairie, says he will sponsor
a bill calling for the expansion. Other area congressmen have
pledged to support the legislation.
   ``It will commercialize the Goose Praire area,'' complained Chet
Clark, who lives in the remote mountain village during the summers.
``You'll have people, construction workers, staying there.
   ``It will have quite an impact on the hiking, the fishing and
the camping.''
   The village, with five permanent residences, 14 summer cabins
and a couple of businesses, is at the end of a narrow blacktop
road, near Mount Rainier National Park.
   Huge evergreens absorb noise and sunlight, giving the area a
cathedral-like stillness. The Bumping River, named by Indians
because of its rocks, races a few feet beyond the edge of the road.
The snow-covered Cascade Range looms overhead.
   ``Goose Praire is a bit of heaven in all seasons,'' Supreme
Court Justice William O. Douglas, a dogged environmentalist, wrote
in his 1974 autobiography, ``Go East, Young Man.''
   Douglas, who grew up in nearby Yakima, first came to Goose
Prairie as a boy and wrote of it in his memoirs after making a home
there away from Washington, D.C.
   ``Goose Prairie is now a part of a technological society which
may in time destroy it,'' wrote Douglas, who died in 1980. ``But
the values of the Prairie are so precious, so unique _ that all who
love the Goose Prairies of this continent will put up a valiant
fight to preserve them.''
   Those words proved prophetic, as environmental groups have lined
up against the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation plans to expand the
reservoir.
   ``Douglas I'm sure would be turning over once again to see this
perennial project has arisen,'' said David Ortman, Northwest
representative for Friends of the Earth and a leading opponent of
the project.
   Ortman said greater water conservation efforts, not bigger
reservoirs, are needed. The dam would inundate 1,600 acres of
never-logged old growth forests, some hundreds of years old, which
provide habitat for creatures not found elsewhere, he said.
   In addition, there would not be enough water to fill the
reservoir for many years, leaving unsightly mud flats, he said.
   Bumping Lake is one of five reservoirs that provide irrigation
to the half-million-acre Yakima Project. Built in 1910, the 60-foot
dam backs up 33,700 acre feet of water that drains from the slopes
of the Cascades, providing water for the fertile but arid Yakima
Valley.
   The $150 million expansion project would include a 240-foot high
dam 4,000 feet downstream from the existing dam, 2 miles from Goose
Prairie. The new dam would create a 458,000 acre foot storage
reservoir.
   A total of 3,000 new acres would be inundated, including some
summer cabins and campgrounds at the lake. The village itself is
below the dam and would not be covered by water, but expansion
opponents fear their lifestyle would be disrupted and resources
like hiking trails would be destroyed.
   The dam is just outside the boundaries of the William O. Douglas
Wilderness area, where such developments would be prohibited.
Douglas opposed just about all development in the area.
   ``I was teaching at Yale when news came that a road would take
the place of the trail'' (to Goose Prairie), he wrote. ``I almost
wept at the thought of pot-bellied, cigar-smoking men roaming
through a sacrosanct valley and polluting it with the noise and
fumes of cars.
   ``I wrote, I protested, complained, but progress won out, as it
usually does.''
