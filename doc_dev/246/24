   Gov. Roy Romer today recommended that a permit be
issued to build the $500 million Two Forks dam and reservoir, but
he attached a slew of conditions and said the project should be
built only as a last resort.
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has the final say in issuing
the permit for the project, which has been proposed by the Denver
Water Board and a group called Metro Water Providers, a consortium
of 42 Denver-area water providers and municipalities.
   Col. Steve G. West, district engineer for the Army Corps of
Engineers, said the governor's recommendation will be one of many
factors considered in deciding whether the project is in the public
interest.
   Two Forks would be built just downstream from the confluence of
the South Platte River and its North Fork, about 25 miles southwest
of Denver. It would flood 20 miles of scenic Cheesman Canyon, a
prospect that has upset environmentalists and sportsmen.
   ``Colorado should build Two Forks, in my judgment, only as a
last resort,'' the governor told a packed news conference at the
state Capitol. He added that he believes it has only a 50-50 chance
of being constructed even with his approval of the permit.
   ``I am challenging the state to find an alternate solution and I
think I can,'' Romer said.
   Denver officials say Two Forks would add 98,000 acre-feet of
water to the city's water system, enough to meet Denver's water
needs through the year 2035.
   Project planners say Two Forks' 615-foot-high dam and reservoir
would take two years to design and five years to build, meaning it
would be usable in 1995 at the earliest.
   Proponents have painted the project as crucial to the
metropolitan area's growth. Opponents say it would needlessly wipe
out 20 miles of Gold Medal trout fishing and nearby recreation
areas and would pose a threat to whooping crane habitat and
irrigators along the Platte River in Nebraska.
   Romer said he wants to save Cheesman Canyon and possibly make it
a state recreational area. But in order to do so, he said, his
favored alternative _ a dam and reservoir west of the Two Forks
site _ may have to be be built, flooding the town of Bailey.
   ``There is a cost in saving the canyon. The cost is in moving
Bailey,'' Romer said.
   The governor said he would recommend a 25-year shelf life for
the project, meaning it could be built anytime during that period.
   But he attached conditions to his approval of the permit: a
metropolitan-area water conservation program; creation of a
Metropolitan Water Authority to plan distribution of water supplies
in the Denver area; a requirement that metro water providers share
existing water supplies, and full implementation of a mitigation
plan to replace wildlife habitat and recreational facilities if Two
Forks is ever built.
