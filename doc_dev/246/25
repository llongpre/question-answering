   The construction of the Xingo dam, a
massive public works project of the outgoing administration of
President Jose Sarney, is being halted because of a cash shortage,
company officials announced Monday.
   A three-company consortium in charge of building the dam said
the federal government was $138 million behind in payments to the
project.
   As a result, the consortium must halt construction within 24
hours and lay off 2,050 workers, officials said.
   ``We've gone as far as we could, but we're convinced that we're
never going to see this money, '' said consortium superintendent
Ruiter Neto Campos at a Monday press conference in the northeastern
city of Recife.
   However, Campos said the group will resume work if the
government pays its debt.
   The dam was being built on the Sao Francisco River in
northeastern Bahia state.
   A $110 billion foreign debt coupled with growing internal debt
has drained federal coffers and stalled numerous public works.
   The 5,000-megawatt Xingo dam, projected to cost $2.5 billion, is
considered essential to supplying northeastern Brazil with
electricity by 1994. The dam is about 20 percent complete.
