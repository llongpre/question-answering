<LEADPARA>  HERBERT Hoover is funnier than "Charlie Hoover." Hoover vacuum cleaners are
funnier than "Charlie Hoover." Hoover Dam is funnier than "Charlie Hoover.";  
Even Sam Kinison is funnier than "Charlie Hoover" -- and Kinison co-stars in
this new Fox series, which makes its debut tonight (9 p.m., Chs. 2, 35, 40).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Though Kinison is unfunny most of the time, he's not the reason the show
offers fewer laughs than Hoover Tower.;   Better jokes in graffiti;   No,
blame that on the stupid premise -- Kinison is the 8-inch-tall alter ego of a
business exec, played by Tim Matheson -- and the stupider writing.;   There
are better jokes on bathroom walls all over America than in the 22 minutes of
torture the producers sent out for preview. That was the second episode,
because they were still tinkering with tonight's show.;   "Charlie Hoover" is
a crude variation on one of Fox's other unfunny shows, "Herman's Head,"
introduced just a couple of months ago. In that one the gimmick is that a guy
named Herman has four characters who represent different aspects of his
personality talking in his head; in this one, Matheson has the miniature
Kinison on his desk -- and the worst laugh track in the business.;   'Get a
Life' is back;   Fox is packaging this mess with the return of Chris Elliott's
"Get a Life," (9:30, Chs. 2, 35, 40). If you liked that show last season,
you'll probably like it again. If you didn't, don't bother giving it another
shot. It's as infantile and post-Letterman as before -- a blessing to some and
a curse to others. You know who you are.  </TEXT>
