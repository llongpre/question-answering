<LEADPARA>  Looking for ways to expand its limited water supply to overcome droughts and
meet population growth in the coming decade, the city of Santa Cruz is
literally "testing the waters" of 13 potential new water sources.;    The
alternatives range from relatively inexpensive, politically acceptable
solutions, such as using treated wastewater for landscape irrigation, to
highly controversial, multimillion-dollar undertakings such as constructing a
dam along the county's north coast.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We're going to need to expand in some manner," said Ann-Marie Mitroff,
conservation coordinator for the Santa Cruz Water Department. "Otherwise we
could get into a situation where we'll be rationing almost every year.";   
The population served by the Santa Cruz Water Department is expected to grow
from the current 80,000 to 105,000 by the year 2005.;    Last week, the city's
water commission recommended hiring a Walnut Creek engineering firm to rank
potential new water sources based on cost and environmental impact. The city
council is expected to award a $370,000 contract to that firm, Camp, Dresser &amp;
McKee, at its meeting tonight .;    Under terms of a draft contract, the
company would conduct a detailed study of 13 new sources outlined in the
city's 1989 master water plan. Engineers would report to the council in fall
1992 with a list ranking the projects.;    The council then could decide
which, if any, of the options to pursue. Any change would represent the first
major expansion of Santa Cruz's water system since Loch Lomond Dam was built
on Newell Creek in Lompico in 1962.;    In past years, water source issues
have touched off intense controversy in Santa Cruz.;    The slow-growth
politicians who have controlled city government since 1981 have staunchly
resisted calls to build dams, arguing that creating new reservoirs would open
the way for rampant development and lead to destruction of the environment.;  
 The last time the issue surfaced, in 1987, former Mayor John Laird was
successful in killing a plan to build a dam on Zayante Creek.;    Five
successive years of drought have forced city residents to ration -- and
possibly to become more sympathetic to a new dam, he said Monday.;    A new
dam almost certainly would alleviate the need for rationing during future
droughts.;    However, construction costs would raise water bills, wilderness
would be destroyed and pressure for increased development would grow, Laird
said.;    "People just have to decide what trade-offs they're willing to
make," he said.;    Some of the options engineers will study include:;   
(check) Enlarging Loch Lomond. Raising the dam height to 14 feet would allow
storage of millions of gallons of additional water. The project would mean a
costly relocation of the reservoir's ranger headquarters and new recreational
facilities.;    (check) Drilling new wells. Since 1979, however, water
officials have spent $500,000 searching for a major underground aquifer
without much luck.;    (check) Building a desalination plant. Although
alluring for a coastal city, a plant to convert saltwater to drinking water
would cost about $60 million.;    (check) Other dams. Dams could be built on
Baldwin or Laguna creeks on the north coast, or on the upper San Lorenzo River
or Zayante Creek.  </TEXT>
