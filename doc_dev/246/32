   The Reagan administration sought funds Monday
for 10 new flood control and navigation projects, including several
Congress refused to launch last year.
   It requested $88.5 million in its fiscal 1990 budget for the Army
Corps of Engineers projects. Six were in last year's Reagan budget,
but Congress refused to start any. The four new projects are in
Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
   The number of new projects has slumped in recent years under the
pressure of tight budgets and a 1986 law requiring local communities
to put up a share of the initial cost.
   The budget calls for a new system of paying for maintenance on
the Bureau of Reclamation projects, largely bypassing the
congressional appropriations process.
   For the third year in a row, the bureau, which operates in the 17
westernmost states of the lower 48, proposed no new construction.
Sixty percent of the bureau's construction spending would be devoted
to three projects _ the Central Arizona Project, the Central Utah
Project and the Central Valley Project in California.
   The budget calls for no substantial construction money for the
controversial Garrison Diversion Unit in North Dakota until 1994,
though $8.75 million would be earmarked to complete certain
facilities and secure those already built.
   Similarly, the Animas-La Plata Project in Colorado and New Mexico
was allocated only $3.7 million to bring to a ``reasonable
conclusion'' pre-construction activity and equipment purchases.
   The bureau would spend a total of $946 million, down 14 percent
from $1.103 billion this year. Its construction budget would be $655
million, down 7.2 percent from $706 million this year.
   The corps' spending would total $3.2 billion, down 1.7 percent
from $3.26 billion. Its construction spending would total $1.22
billion, up 8.9 percent from $1.12 billion.
   While the 10 new projects would require $85.5 million in start-up
funds, there was no estimate of how much the projects would
ultimately cost.
   Congress must appropriate funds for maintaining the bureau's
projects, including the gigantic dams it runs in the West whose
power is sold by the power marketing administrations of the Energy
Department.
   Some revenues from the bureau's dams and irrigation canals are
tagged as owed the Treasury for operation and maintenance, but
Congress must appropriate the money anyway. The bureau wants to use
those earmarked funds on its own.
   ``As a result of the increased managerial flexibility afforded by
the revolving fund, the bureau will be better able to coordinate its
plans for the operation and maintenance of existing dams, power
plants and irrigation facilities,'' the budget document said. The
Bonneville Power Administration and the Western Area Power
Administration ``will be full partners in approving budgets,
projects and priorities.''
   The budget called for spending $222 million on maintenance, up
from $177 million this year. But $107 million will come from the
revolving fund.
   ``There's quite a (maintenance) backlog we have to catch up on,''
Interior undersecretary Earl Geljde told reporters.
   Here are the 10 new Corps of Engineer projects. If two figures
are shown, the second figure represents the amount for construction
the administration requested last year. An ``F'' denotes the project
is for flood control; an ``N'' means a navigation project.
   The dollar figures are in budget authority, which usually
approximates actual outlays during the year. Outlay figures were not
immediately available.
   _Cache Creek Settling Basin, California, $5.5 million, $3.25
million, F.
   _Santa Ana River Mainstem, California, $20 million, $15 million,
F.
   _Ramapo and Mahway rivers, Mahwah, N.J. and Suffern, N.Y.,
$330,000, $300,000, F.
   _Sheyenne River, Riverside to Horace, N.D., $5.5 million, $2.7
million, F.
   _Nonconnah Creek, Tennessee and Mississippi, $1.5 million, $1.5
million, F.
   _Lock Haven, Pa., $7.6 million, $1.0 million, F.
   _Nelsonville, Ohio, levees on the Hocking River, $2.415 million,
F.
   _Point Marion Lock and Dam No. 8, Monongahela River, Pennsylvania
and West Virginia, $17.9 million, N.
   _Sims Bayou, Houston, Texas, $4.0 million, F.
   _Winfield Lock and Dam, West Virginia, $20.8 million, N.
   The Point Marion and Winfield projects listed construction funds
in last year's budget requests but were not shown as proposed new
starts because the corps said the money was for pre-construction
activities.
   The Sheyenne project is expanded from the one proposed last year,
extending to Horace instead of stopping at West Fargo.
