  [Text] Wuhan, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Construction of a 
ship lift at the Geheyan key water control project on the 
Qingjiang river, which empties into the Chang Jiang river 
eastward of the Three Gorges, started recently. 
  The building of the ship lift project, which requires a 
total 
investment of more than 200 million yuan, is aimed at 
establishing a reliable basis for the design and construction of 
another ship lift at the gigantic water control dam at the Three 
Gorges on the Chiang Jiang, said engineers responsible for the 
construction of the ship lift on Qingjiang river. 
  According to them, the main technical indexes of the ship 
lift under construction, designed and being constructed by the 
Wuhan Ship Building Company, observe a general proportion of one 
to ten with the ship lift to be built at the Three Gorges water 
control dam. 
  The ship lift now under construction is a major part of the 
Geheyan water control project. The ship lift, consisting of two 
separate vertical ship lifts, is expected to have a maximum 
lifting height of 122 m and a maximum lifting weight of 15,000 
tons when completed and put into use in 1997, said the engineers. 
  Construction of the ship lift at the Geheyan water control 
project of Qingjiang river is of great importance for promoting 
the economy of Hubei and opening up mountainous southwestern 
Hubei in the Qingjiang river watershed.
