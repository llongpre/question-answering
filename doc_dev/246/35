<TEXT>     Yet while a team of experts devotes years to the laborious process of
writing an environmental impact statement, dam operations continue as usual.; 
 Glen Canyon Dam, towering 710 feet above the riverbed of the Colorado a few
miles upstream from the Grand Canyon, is operated by the Bureau of
Reclamation, an agency of the Department of the Interior. The
federally-subsidized electricity produced at the dam is sold at
bargain-basement prices by the Western Area Power Administration, a branch of
the Department of Energy, to publicly-owned utilities, agricultural irrigation
districts and rural electric cooperatives in 15 Western states.;   Dam
operators schedule peak releases of up to 31,500 cubic feet per second (cfs)
for the afternoon hours when demand for electricity is at its highest. The
water surges through the Grand Canyon, destroying fish and wildlife habitat
and washing away beaches. Then the operators turn the river almost completely
off later in the day and on weekends when peak power demand declines. Within a
few hours, flows fall as low as 1,000 to 3,000 cfs.;   The "normal" pace of
the devastation is accelerated by occasional flood releases, which result from
keeping Lake Powell too full. An unexpectedly large runoff -- due, for
example, to late spring snowstorms in the Rockies -- can threaten to overtop
the dam. To avert this disaster, the dam operators release enormous amounts of
water through the spillways, scouring out even more beaches.;   Before Glen
Canyon Dam was built, the Colorado River ran free and wild from its headwaters
in the Rocky Mountains all the way through the Grand Canyon and into Lake Mead
(the huge reservoir behind Hoover Dam, which was built in the mid-1930s).
Average flows in the Grand Canyon ranged from a winter low of about 5,000 cfs
to around 50,000 cfs during peak snowmelt in late spring and early summer. In
a dry winter, flows dropped to around 1,000; in a wet year, the river peaked
as high as 150,000. Water temperature varied from just above freezing in
winter and spring to an average high of over 80 degrees Fahrenheit in late
summer and early fall.;   During most of the year the sediment-laden river was
a muddy reddish-brown in color -- hence the name "Colorado," which means "red"
in Spanish. Every year, the river washed away the sandy beaches with high
flows in the spring and early summer. Then, as flows dropped in the summer, it
re-created them by depositing fresh sediment carried from far upstream.;  
After the dam; This natural cycle was interrupted in 1963, when water began to
be held in Lake Powell, the enormous reservoir behind newly-completed Glen
Canyon Dam. The seasonal cycle of low and high flows disappeared, to be
replaced by a computer-driven schedule of dam releases determined by the
demands of power consumers.;   No longer was the Colorado allowed to fulfill
its yearly task of destroying and replenishing the beaches in the Grand
Canyon. The river was swallowed up in the still waters of Lake Powell, and the
sediment it carried began to be deposited in the upper reaches of the
reservoir. From then on, beaches washed away by high water below the dam would
simply disappear.;   Seasonal differentials in water temperature also changed
radically. The intake structures for the dam's electrical turbines are located
far below the surface of the reservoir, so the water released to the Colorado
River in the Grand Canyon now remains cold all year long. Water temperatures
range from about 41.90 degrees in winter to 53.60 degrees in summer.;   Native
fish have had enormous difficulty adapting to the year-round cold water, the
fluctuating flows, and the loss of habitat, especially backwaters. Two
species, the bony-tailed chub and the Colorado River squawfish, are now
extinct in the Grand Canyon, though they cling to life elsewhere in the
Colorado River. Another fish unique to the Colorado and Little Colorado
Rivers, the humpback chub, is on the endangered species list.;   The
fluctuating flows also cause plenty of problems for tens of thousands of
recreational boaters and fishermen.;   The studies; After ignoring the problem
for years, in 1982 the Department of the Interior authorized its own study.
The results, announced in 1988, confirmed what environmentalists and
scientists had long been claiming: The river environment of the Grand Canyon
suffers daily, ongoing damage due to dam operations.;   At first, Secretary of
the Interior Manuel Lujan attempted to stall by proposing more research.
Finally, in response to pressure generated by a nationwide letter-writing
campaign, in July 1989 he directed that an environmental impact statement
(EIS) be prepared.;   The EIS process is now under way but years from
completion. Any final resolution of the question will take still longer.
Meanwhile, except for brief periods set aside to test the effects of different
flow schedules, fluctuating peak-power releases go on as usual, and the damage
continues.;   The options; Although the final decision will likely fall to
Congress, the team charged with preparing the EIS is considering a variety of
proposals on how to operate Glen Canyon Dam in the future.;   Sad to say, the
Bureau of Reclamation and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) still
want to run the dam as a peak-power operation, continuing the present schedule
of daily release fluctuations with only slight modification. Power demand
would still be king.;   These federal agencies propose to mitigate the effects
of the releases by building a small "reregulation" dam just upstream from
Lee's Ferry to "smooth out" the changes in the river level downstream. They
admit that some erosion of the beaches would continue, so they would bring
machinery into the Grand Canyon to pump sediment from the river channel onto
the most heavily eroded beaches, then shore up the beaches with rocks taken
from the mouths of nearby tributaries. (So far, they haven't proposed pouring
concrete.);   Various scientists and private environmental groups are
sponsoring a range of alternatives that would do far more to protect the Grand
Canyon. Their approaches vary in detail, but they agree on the key element:
eliminating the huge daily fluctuations and occasional devastating flood
releases that wash the beaches away.;   Base load vs. peak power; Any of these
environmentally sound alternatives would be a vast improvement over the
present regime. All would change the emphasis of Glen Canyon Dam operations
from peak power to base load production. In other words, the dam would deliver
steady, predictable amounts of electricity around the clock instead of
increasing its output to meet daily peak power demand.;   No energy would be
lost by the implementation of any of these alternatives. All the water going
through the dam would still produce electricity. The total amount of
electricity generated would remain the same, but it would be produced at
different times of the day.;   True, this change would mean that the utilities
that now buy Glen Canyon peak power would have to look elsewhere for it. That
might mean paying higher market prices. But the impact on consumers'
electrical bills would hardly be significant.;   Cheap, subsidized
electricity; Glen Canyon Dam, like other major WAPA-Bureau of Reclamation
dams, is being operated as if its purpose were solely to provide the cheapest
possible power. (Currently, WAPA sells its federally-subsidized electricity at
a wholesale rate of about 1.45 cents per kilowatt-hour, leas than a third of
the market price.) In practice, concern for the dam's impact on the river
environment and encouragement of energy conservation -- parts of WAPA's stated
mission -- are conspicuously absent.;   WAPA and the publicly-owned utilities
that buy its power are prohibited from making a profit on their sales of
electricity. Yet nothing in the wording of WAPA's mission says that its
consumers are guaranteed prices far below what most Americans pay. And
artificially cheap prices provide no incentive to conserve.;   Does anyone --
even the government -- have the right to destroy the Grand Canyon's river
environment just to save favored consumers a few pennies on their electrical
rates?;   The solution;   The solution can be stated very simply: Manage Glen
Canyon Dam properly to protect the Grand Canyon. That means eliminating the
radical peak power releases that cause the wide daily fluctuations in flows,
and making sure that Lake Powell isn't so full that the dam operators have to
release flood flows again.;   The immediate goal is to persuade Congress to
force the Department of the Interior to modify or eliminate peak-power
releases during the time it takes to complete the EIS. The ultimate goal, of
course, is for the government to operate Glen Canyon Dam with due regard for
the downstream river environment.;   The Grand Canyon is too valuable a piece
of our national heritage to be sacrificed to a power plant.  </TEXT>
