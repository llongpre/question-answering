   British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority is offering electricity to the U.S. under long-term contracts beginning in 1995 from a proposed $1.24 billion (U.S.) hydro project. 

   Construction of the 900,000-kilowatt Site C dam, on the Peace River in northern British Columbia, could begin in 1989 if delivery contracts are signed this year with purchasers in California and the Pacific Northwest, said Chester Johnson, chairman of the government-owned utility. 

   The executive declined to disclose the price for the power, but said revenue from the export sales would have to cover the project's construction cost. 
He said the electricity would be competitive in an energy market in which crude oil is priced at $25 a barrel; crude currently sells for about $18 a barrel. 

   The project will help the provincial economy by providing 2,000 construction jobs, Mr. Johnson said at a news conference here. 
After the export contracts expire, the province would gain the dam for its own needs without any financial outlay, he added. 

   He said that the U.S. electricity purchasers would have to sign firm take-or-pay commitments so that the province wouldn't bear the risks if energy markets proved weak during the contract period. 
Take-or-pay commitments require purchasers to pay for delivery of contracted amounts of energy whether or not the supplies are needed. 

   An export market for the dam's power was confirmed in a six-month study by utilities in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and California, he said. 
The study's 11 sponsors, including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and San Francisco's Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., said the market would last for at least 20 years after 1994. 

   Direct costs of the dam and generating station are estimated at $1.05 billion with new transmission lines in British Columbia costing a further $187.5 million. 
The cost of expanded transmission lines in the U.S. was estimated at $15 million. 

   Strongly opposing the Site C project, which would be subject to regulatory clearances, are British Columbia environmentalists, who fear the impact on the Peace River watershed. 
Some electricity users in the province also fear they may have to pay more for power if the project doesn't recover its costs. 

   British Columbia currently has a power surplus equal to half the 1,843,000 kilowatt capacity of its newest dam, completed in 1983 for $2 billion. 
But the province expects the surplus to disappear by the mid-1990s because of increased domestic demand.
