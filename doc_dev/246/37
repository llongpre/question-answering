  [Text] Yichang, January 25 (XINHUA) -- With the full 
support of the central government, Yichang City in Hubei 
Province, has stepped up the pace of construction of a 
communication network that serves the largest water conservancy 
and power project -- the Three Gorges. 
  Preparations for an international airport have started. 
According to a preliminary plan, the airport will be built in 
two phases. The first phase will involve the construction of a 
2,600- meter runway and the second phase will involved a 
3,200-meter runway. The first phase, estimated to cost 350 
million yuan, is scheduled for completion in 1995. 
  Work on a deep-water harbor capable of accommodating ships 
of 
3,000 tons is to start soon near the dam site. The project is 
expected to cost 120 million yuan. 
  With a designed handling capacity of 10 to 50 million tons 
annually, the port will be used to transport materials needed in 
the construction of the Three Gorges Project, of which 
preliminary projects have started. 
  Meanwhile, a highway bridge across the Chang Jiang River at 
Yichang will be built soon. 
  The Three Gorges Project, which was launched two years ago 
by 
the Chinese Government, is one of the world's largest water 
conservancy and power projects. A dam 185 meters high and 
nearly 2 km long will be thrown across the Chang Jiang River 
before the year 2010.
