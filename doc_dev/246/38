Three Southern California counties and the U.S. Army formalized an agreement 
Thursday that clears the way for the construction of flood-control barriers 
along the Santa Ana River, with Orange County being the major beneficiary of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties and the Army Corps of Engineers 
will share the cost of the $1.1-billion project to improve flood control along 
the river that authorities say has the worst potential flood problems west of 
the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
In October, $20 million in federal funds were authorized to initiate the 
project. The agreement says that each year the federal government will 
appropriate additional funds until the project is completed. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Orange County need to realize how important this project is and 
how devastated the county will be, with the loss of life and structural damage, 
if a flood does occur," said Costa Mesa Mayor Peter Buffa, who is chairman of 
the Santa Ana River Flood Protection Agency. "It's just hard to picture it 
right now because the river is dry." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana River project includes the construction of a new dam, to be 
called "Seven Oaks," four miles upstream from Mentone in San Bernardino County; 
raising Prado Dam in Riverside County by 30 feet to expand its capacity from 
195,000 to 363,000 acre-feet; widening and deepening channels along the lower 
river through Orange County and those along Santiago Creek, and the 
construction of a drain in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project will enhance and preserve marshland and wetlands for 
endangered waterfowl, fish and wildlife species at the mouth of the river, 
according to William Zaun, Orange County's director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, which will be the major beneficiary of the massive project, will 
pay the major share of the local costs, estimated at more than $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
The river extends from the San Bernardino Mountains to its mouth at Huntington 
Beach. STEPHEN C. CHAVEZ
