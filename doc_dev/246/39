   The Environmental Protection Agency has
decided to veto construction of the Two Forks Dam in Colorado, the
largest non-federal water project in the West, it was reported
today.
   The Washington Post said EPA Administrator William K. Reilly is
expected within a few days to announce a decision to block the
billion-dollar dam, which the city of Denver had sought to increase
water supplies for its suburbs.
   But EPA officials said today that while action will be taken
soon on a review board's recommendation that no dam be built at the
site, no decision has yet been made.
   The officials, who commented on condition they not be identified
by name, said Riley will not make the decision himself but has
delegated it to LaJuana S. Wilcher, the EPA's assistant
administrator for water.
   One official confirmed that Ms. Wilcher is ``working on a
document'' but added: ``Until it is final it is inappropriate to
tell you what's in it.''
   The dam has been the focus of an intense battle between
environmentalists and supporters of increased development.
   The proposed project called for flooding much of Cheesman
Canyon, a wilderness area between two forks of the South Platte
River.
   The Post said it obtained a draft of the decision, which said
the dam would lead to ``unacceptable adverse effects,'' including
loss and damage to fisheries and recreational opportunities.
   Denver has ``practicable, less environmentally damaging
alternatives'' to provide water for the new suburbs in the front
range of the Rocky Mountains, Reilly is quoted as saying.
   Monte Pascoe, a Denver Water Board commissioner, told The Post
the decision is ``unbelievably shortsighted. You're saying squeeze
more out of the existing system and get right up to a drought
before you recognize the problem.''
   The Army Corps of Engineers in March 1989 approved a permit to
build the dam, and former Reagan administration officials had
indicated support for the project.
