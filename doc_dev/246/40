<F P=106> ["Page 5 Report" by Sathit Manatsurakun: "Water Diversion </F>
From Salween River To Replenish Phumiphon Dam -- Many Questions 
Need To Be Answered"] 
  [Summary] "It appears that many obstacles face the program 
to build seven dams in the Salween River basin in the 
Thai-Burmese border area to draw water from branches of the 
Salween River to branches of the Chao Phraya River to replenish 
the Phumiphon dam in order to feed 22 central region provinces, 
including Bangkok. 
  "In addition to opposition from the local people, which 
already has started in some areas, the government program will 
have to face scrutiny by private development organizations, 
student environmental groups, and academics who have demanded 
fair distribution of resources. The obstacles will be just as 
intense as those found against the efforts to build other dams. 
  "The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand [EGAT] has 
been assigned by the government to make a feasibility and 
environmental impact study of the program, which involves the 
construction of at least seven dams. 
  "They are: the Mae Lamao-Mae Tun Project in Mae Sot 
District, Tak Province; the Huai Khanaeng-Mae Tun Project in Mae 
Ramat District, Tak; the Upper Nam Pai-Mae Taeng Project in Pai 
District, Mae Hong Son; the Nam Ngao-Mae Tun Project in the area 
where Sop Moei Subdistrict, Mae Hong Son and Tha Song Yang 
District, Tak Province merges; the Lower Nam Pai-Mae Chaem 
Project in Muang District, Mae Hong Son; the Nam Moei-Mae Tun 
Project in Mae Ramat District, Tak; the Upper Salween-Mae Taeng 
Project in Burma north of Chiang Dao District, Chiang Mai. 
  "It is estimated that the seven projects will be able to 
divert 6 billion cubic meters of water to Phumiphon Dam. 
  "Because the program will involve drawing water from 
international waterways for domestic use, the program originator 
has to employ 'offensive public relations' as well as tactics to 
push ahead its program on the basis of international 
geopolitical factors. 
  "According to a source in EGAT's Phumiphon Dam Replenishment 
Project working team, Minister Attached to the Prime Minister's 
Office Sawit Phothiwihok, who is in charge of EGAT, has a policy 
to push ahead the program in three ways: 
  "First, the study for the projects which are located in 
Thailand, such as the Huai Khanaeng-Mae Tun Project, can start 
promptly. The project is located about 600 meters from the bank 
of the Moei River on the Thai-Burmese border. A Thai-UK treaty, 
signed while Burma was a British colony, stipulates that the 
banks of the Salween and Moei Rivers serves as the border, with 
the two rivers being neutral territory. Therefore, it should be 
no problem to pump water from the Moei River that flows into 
Huai Khanaeng Khito in the high tide season. 
  "Second, on the project which is located in the area 
straddling the Thai-Burmese border -- the Nam Moei-Mae Tun -- an 
agreement must be reached with Burma to enable Thailand to seek 
loans confidently from international financial institutions and 
to ensure that there will be no problem with the ethnic minority 
groups waging a liberation war nearby. 
  "Third, Thailand should not ask Burma to permit it to study 
the projects located in Burmese territory, such as the Upper 
Salween Project, unless Burma wants such projects implemented in 
order to sell water and electricity to Thailand. Only under 
these conditions should Thailand negotiate with Burma on a 
government-to-government level. 
  "The source said: `This policy was reached after considering 
the question: what would we do if Burma asks to conduct a study 
on the Chao Phraya River basin?' 
  "In any event, it appears that the EGAT will choose to 
implement more simple projects based on engineering and economic 
considerations first." 
  The EGAT organized a seminar recently to gauge reaction to 
two projects -- the Mae Lamao and Huai Khanaeng projects -- on 
which it already conducted preliminary studies. The people who 
will be displaced by the projects clearly opposed the 
construction, while academics and private development 
organizations made many observations. 
  "The seven private development organizations which 
participated in the seminar made the following proposals: 1. a 
public hearing should be conducted regarding water needs and 
resource management in the Chao Phraya River basin; 2. the study 
on environmental impact should be expanded to cover the Salween 
River basin as well; 3. an independent committee comprising 
specialists, local leaders, and representatives of private 
development organizations should be formed to monitor the 
environmental impact. The committee should participate in every 
stage of the projects until after completion of project 
construction."

<H5>  Mae Lamao-Mae Tun Project </H5>
  The dam is 60 meters high. It will dam Mae Lamao stream 
about 15 km from where it merges with the Moei River in Mae 
Lamao National Forest Reserve in Mae Sot District, Tak Province. 
It will be located about 120 km west of the Tak provincial 
town. The reservoir will inundate 4,190 rai of land and contain 
94.3 million cubic meters of water. The project cost will be 
5,342 million baht. It will irrigate 18,000 rai of farmland and 
divert 356 million cubic meters of water through a tunnel to 
Phumiphon Dam 
<H5>  Huai Khanaeng Project </H5>
  The dam will dam Huai Khanaeng Khitoe stream about 600-1,600 
meters from where it merges with Moei River. The exact size and 
site of the project is still under study. It will be located in 
Mae Ramat District, Tak Province. The reservoir will encompass 
about 1,400 rai and will divert 600-800 cubic meters of water to 
Phumiphon Dam. The project is estimated to cost about 5,068 
million baht. [end box]
