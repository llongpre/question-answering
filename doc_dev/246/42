Supporters and opponents agreed Friday that the veto of the Two Forks Dam 
project in Colorado could spell the end of huge projects aimed at diverting 
water in the water-scarce West. 
</P>
<P>
But both sides also agreed that the decision by the Environmental Protection 
Agency to kill the Denver-area project would not spell the end of the fight 
over a project that pits developers against conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA confirmed Friday that it would not approve construction of the Two 
Forks Dam project, the largest non-federal water project in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's assistant administrator for water, LaJuana S. Wilcher, said she 
would uphold the recommendation of the EPA's Denver office to bar construction 
of the 615-foot dam just downstream of the confluence of the South Platte River 
and its North Fork. 
</P>
<P>
"The applicants made a good-faith effort to downscale the project size and 
compensate for the loss of wetlands and aquatic resources," Wilcher said. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the smaller project would still flood 24 miles of freely flowing, 
scenic stream and almost 11 miles of gold medal trout fishery. . . . It would 
inundate an area of unquestionable natural beauty that provides a diversity of 
fishing and recreational opportunities and a rich aquatic habitat close to the 
Denver metropolitan area." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Denver wants the project to increase water supplies for its 
suburbs. The project calls for building the dam to creating a reservoir on the 
South Platte River, southwest of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision affects not just Denver, but it may be the end of all big water 
projects," said William H. Van Schooneveld, chairman of the group behind the 
project. "If EPA can veto this, there really isn't any project that anybody can 
develop that can pass the EPA." 
</P>
<P>
Hope Babcock, general counsel for the National Audubon Society, agreed on the 
veto's significance. 
</P>
<P>
"It says once again that the era of building these enormous projects is over," 
she said, adding that the agency has previously used its veto powers under the 
Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of those vetoes are final, however, and a federal court in Virginia 
recently reversed a veto. "There are a lot of grounds for appeal," Van 
Schooneveld said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Denver Water Board has fought like crazy for this project over the years," 
Babcock said. "I would be amazed -- they have a lot of high-priced lawyers -- 
if they didn't go to court on this." 
</P>
<P>
Big dams have made possible the growth of big cities and farms in the West. 
Critics say that too much water has been diverted, threatening the balance of 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
The Army Corps of Engineers in March, 1989, approved a permit to build the dam, 
and former Ronald Reagan Administration officials had indicated support for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Babcock said the veto decision "is extremely significant, in particular, 
because of what it says about Reilly and his EPA." Reilly was appointed by 
President Bush.
