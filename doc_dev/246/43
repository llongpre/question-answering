   At least 40,000 people linked arms and sang
``We Shall Overcome'' in this remote village Thursday to protest a
planned dam project that would wipe out farm land and forests and
leave about 1 million people homeless.
   Protest organizers said the participants, who traveled by bus,
trucks tractors and even on horseback, live along Narmada River,
one of India's longest and holiest waterways.
   The protesters joined hands and formed a 4-mile-long chain to
symbolize their determination to save Harsud and 572 other villages
that will go under water if the dams are constructed.
   Environmentalists, social workers, film stars and politicians
called for the project to be permanently shelved.
   ``We shall not move, the dam is our doom!'' the protesters
chanted.
   The rally was organized by the Save Marmada Committee, which has
spearheaded a year-old campaign against the Narmada Valley Project.
   The plan calls for construction of four major dams and about
3,000 smaller dams on the 805-mile-long Narmada River and its 41
tributaries.
   Environmentalists say the project would destroy an estimated
865,500 acres of forests, 495,000 acres of farming land and force
an estimated 1 million people to leave their homes.
   They also contend that some of the country's richest
archeological sites and oldest fossils would be under water.
   ``We chose Harsud to symbolize the protest because it is the
largest village that will be submerged by the projhect,'' said
Vinod Raina, spokesman for the Save Narmada Committee.
   Harsud, a town of 15,000 people in central India, is 15 miles
from the river, which originates at Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh
state and flows through the states of Maharastra and Gujarat. It
empties into the Arabian sea.
   The government said it plans to proceed with the project, which
is expected to generate electricity, irrigate fields and solve
drinking water problems in Gujarat, which is often plagued by
drought.
   The government said it would provide land elsewhere for
displaced villagers, but most don't want to leave their homes.
   ``I don't want to drown in Narmada water and I don't want to
leave the village where I was born and grew up,'' said Bhure Singh,
a 55-year-old farmer. Singh's village, Mallan Goan, would be
submerged if the plan drafted in 1948 is carried out.
   During the speeches, youngsters went through the crowd seeking
autographs from film stars and other celebrities in the crowd.
   ``If my village is drowned, this autograph book will remind me
of this day,'' said 15-year-old Mavin Jain.
