   The head of the Environmental Protection Agency
ordered a review today of a controversial proposed dam and reservoir
in Colorado, a move said by agency officials to be a first step in
killing the project.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said he was concerned about
the Two Forks Dam project southeast of Denver because, as it was
approved earlier this month by the Corps of Engineers, it ``could
result in very serious adverse environmental impact.''
   The action amounted to a veto of a permit issued by the corps,
said Jim Scherer, the EPA's regional administrator in Denver, who
had leaned in favor of allowing the dam to be built.
   One senior agency source called Reilly's announcement ``the first
step'' in a process that is expected to scuttle the controversial
dam. ``This is the door through which you have to travel to get to a
veto'' of the entire project, said the official, speaking on the
condition that he not be identified further.
   The Two Forks dam project on the South Platte River southwest of
Denver has been the center of a bitter fight between
environmentalists and Denver area officials who say it is needed to
meet the region's future water needs.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly ordered the agency's regional
office in Denver ``to begin a review of potentially unacceptable
adverse enviromental effects'' the $500 million dam project might
pose.
   ``I am not convinced that the (Two Forks) dam project as proposed
will avoid environmental harm to the extent practicable or that the
proposed permit conditions will minimize or compensate for damage to
fisheries, wildlife habitat and recreation areas,'' Reilly said in a
statement.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., who has fought the Two Forks project
because of concern that it will harm wetlands in western Nebraska,
said in a telephone interview that Reilly's decision is expected to
kill the proposal.
   ``Those of us who have been fighting this proeject have won,''
said Exon. ``The EPA director has done everything that we asked him
to do. There's nothing more that he could have done. ... I think
this is the practical end to this project.''
   Reilly said the proposal as outlined by the Corps of Engineers
permit issued earlier this month ``does not resolve the critical
environmental issues'' that have surrounded the controversial
project.
   Environmentalists have said that EPA's decision on the dam will
be a barometer of how the Bush administration intends to deal with
environmental and conservation issues.
   City officials in Denver argue that the dam is needed to meet the
water needs of the metropolitan area in the late 1990s and beyond,
but environmentalists have said the 615-foot-high dam and reservoir
would be devastating to wildlife habitat up and down the river.
   Environmentalists have been urging Reilly to intervene in the
decision on the dam because the agency's regional administrator, Jim
Scherer, has indicated he favors the project if certain assurances
are included to protect the environment.
   Opponents of the dam said the provisions included in the
tentative construction permit approved by the Corps of Engineers
earlier this month do not satisfy the environmental concerns.
   ``You can hardly think of anything worse (environmentally) than
this project,'' said Daniel Luecke, an attorney for the
Environmental Defense Fund in Denver. ``It's an enormous project.
It's the most destructive way of supplying water to the city of
Denver.''
   Environmental concerns centered on the fact that the dam and
reservoir would flood a vast area where the South Platte and its
North Fork meet about 25 miles southwest of Denver. It would flood
about 20 miles of the scenic Cheesman Canyon, which has some of the
best trout fishing in the state and is home for a variety of
wildlife.
   The project also has been attacked by Nebraska officials who fear
that the dam will reduce the flow of water into the Big Bend region
of western Nebraska and the wetlands that have been a favorite
resting spot for whooping crane and numerous other birds.
   The project was proposed by the Denver Water Board and a
consortium of 41 Denver area water providers and municipalities.
   Proponents have said the dam is crucial to the region's growth.
They argue that the population of the Denver area will grow from 1.5
million people to 2.5 million people by the year 2035 and that such
growth will outstrip the area's water supply if the dam is not built.
