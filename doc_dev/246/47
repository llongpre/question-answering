  [Text] Yichang, Hubei Province, April 24 (XINHUA) -- China 
started construction on the Three Gorges Dam as ground was 
broken on a temporary set of ship locks here this morning in 
Yichang, central China's Hubei Province. 
  So far, earth work on three big projects for the Three 
Gorges 
Dam has begun on one side of the dam, including permanent ship 
locks, a power station and the temporary ship lock and lift 
system. 
  Earth and rock work for these three projects adds up to 
39.24 
million cubic meters, accounting for one-third of the dam's 
total. 
  The first phase of the permanent ship locks work, which 
started on April 17, is 3,800 meters long and nearly 100 meters 
in depth. The two-way five-staged locking and lifting system 
will have an annual handling capacity of 50 million tons and is 
to be the biggest of its sort in the world. 
  The one-way one-staged temporary ship locks with a handling 
capacity of 3,000 tons aims to ensure normal water traffic 
during the dam's construction.
