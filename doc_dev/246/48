   The Canadian government approved the construction of two dams on the Souris River that will provide flood protection for a large area of North Dakota. 

   The project had been delayed for six months by the objections of environmentalists who claimed it would have detrimental effects on water fowl and fisheries. 

   The project is estimated to cost $120 million Canadian dollars (US$101.9 million). 
The U.S. government said it will contribute US$45 million. 

   The construction of the dams "will alleviate a destructive cycle of drought and flood," Lucien Bouchard, Canadian Environment Minister said. 

   The Rafferty and Alameda dams will regulate the flow of water on the flood-prone Souris River, which flows from southeastern Saskatchewan across the Canada-U.S. border into North Dakota and loops north into Manitoba. 
It will save the U.S. more than US$7 million a year in flood damage. 

   But lowering the river's water level will have some "detrimental" impact on two wildlife refuges and some fisheries in North Dakota, said a Canadian Environment Department official. 

   The reduction in the river's water level could reduce waterfowl breeding 65% to 95% in low-flow years, said Weston Wilson, an engineer with the Environmental Protection Agency. 
He said revenue from a sport fishery could be lost six years out of 10. 
The fishery now generates revenue of about $4 million a year. 

   There are always "some trade-offs" said John Bailen, Souris River project manager for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
He said the U.S. government will spend $9 million to reduce the impact. 

   In Canada, the project will create two reservoirs to store water for irrigation and provide cooling for an electric power generation plant. 

   Construction of the partially completed dams was halted in April by a Canadian court that ordered further environmental review of the project.
