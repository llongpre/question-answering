   Stephen Davison Bechtel Sr., an
engineering and construction giant whose accomplishments included
Hoover Dam and an entire city in Saudi Arabia, has died after a
brief illness. He was 88.
   Bechtel, longtime head of the company in San Francisco that bears
his family's name, died at Merritt Peralta Medical Center Tuesday.
At his family's request, the nature of his illness was not disclosed.
   Under Bechtel's guidance, the company built Hoover Dam, the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid
Transit system and the Saudi Arabian city of Jubail. The company
also built thousands of miles of pipelines and helped pioneer the
field of nuclear power.
   A doodle on the back of an envelope was often all the information
Bechtel needed to envision a huge project. The 718-mile Canadian
Trans Mountain Pipeline started that way over lunch in 1949.
   A native of Aurora, Ind., Bechtel joined his father's
construction firm at age 19 after serving in World War I and
attending the University of California at Berkeley.
   He was named president of W.A. Bechtel Co. in 1935 following his
father's death. Bechtel began to transform the business into one of
the world's largest international engineering and construction
companies. The company is now called Bechtel Group Inc.
   Bechtel remained president until 1960, when he turned over
day-to-day responsibilities to his son, Stephen Davison Bechtel Jr.,
but remained active in the company as chairman of the board.
   In 1965, he retired to the position of senior director. He
remained active in the organization's activities until his death.
   Forbes magazine last year estimated his wealth at $390 million.
   Among dozens of honors and citations received during his
lifetime, Bechtel received four honorary doctor of laws degrees and
an honorary doctorate of public service.
   He was named to Fortune magazine's Hall of Fame for Business
Leadership, and was among the ``Top Ten Construction Men of the
Half-Century,'' named by the American Society of Civil Engineers.
   Fortune called Bechtel ``the boldest and maybe the biggest
builder in the world,'' and added his name to a list that includes
Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie.
   Besides his son, Bechtel is survived by his wife, Laura Peart
Bechtel of Oakland; a daughter, Barbara Bechtel Davies; seven
grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.
