home-grown achievement - The Ataturk Dam drew heavily on Ankara's financial
resources

WHEN Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani declined to pay his
respects at the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's secular
founder, the Iranian leader was taken to the next best thing - the Ataturk
Dam.
Inaugurated in October 1981, this huge rock-filled structure is more than
just a sight for visiting heads of state. The Ataturk Dam is the most
important project in Turkey. It is also the most costly. Designed by Turks,
the dam was constructed by Turkish contractors and financed with Turkish
funds. Apart from the foreign suppliers' credits, the Turkish government
budget bore the brunt of the Dollars 4bn investment.
From an observation point high in the project's headquarters the main
landmarks can be seen: the mammoth 169m high embankment; the eight penstocks
which carry the water to the power turbines housed below the reservoir
stretching into the distance.
The statistics are impressive. The dam's 180m high clay core, with
rock-filled wall, will impound a volume of 48.7bn cubic metres of water,
making it the fifth largest dam in the world.
The design is said to be able to withstand an earthquake measuring 8 on the
Richter scale. 'It would take a nuclear bomb to dent it,' said Mr Ferruh
Anik of DSI, the state hydraulics department, during the Gulf War when asked
about his fears that Iraq might attack the site.
When completed, the dam's total installed capacity from eight Swiss-built
turbines will produce 2,400MW, with generating capacity of 9bn kilowatt
hours - almost half Turkey's current hydro output. The reservoir will
provide irrigation for about 730,000 hectares, with the first 40,000ha
scheduled to come into operation next summer.
The system comprises a twin bore 24.6km tunnel which will take water from
the reservoir to irrigate the Harran and Mardin Ceylanpinar plains. This
will make it the second largest single source irrigation scheme in the
world, and it will increase Turkey's irrigated land by a third. The value of
the food surpluses resulting from such large-scale irrigated farming is
estimated at Dollars 5bn.
Since 1983 the government has spent TL11,100bn (Dollars 1.6bn) constructing
the dam, and a further TL5,600bn on electro-mechanical equipment. The
completed cost is projected at almost half of what has so far been spent on
the South East Anatolian Project as a whole. President Turgut Ozal once
claimed that earnings from the electricity revenues from the Ataturk Dam
would repay the cost of installing the irrigation network within four years.
According to Mr Anik, it still requires two or three good years with heavy
snows to fill the dam to the required maximum elevation of 542 metres. But
at a height of 526m the twin Urfa tunnels come into play. Depending on the
next year's snow-melt, this could be as early as next summer.
Officials say there is even an option to raise the maximum water level
further, although this would involve additional flooding, taking more land
out of cultivation. It would also increase evaporation - involving, as it
would, an increase in surface area.
According to initial calculations, the current water level of the reservoir,
at an elevation of 507m, should have been too low for power generation to
begin.
However, Mr Olcay Unver, head of the Gap authority, revealed there had been
a few last-minute adjustments to allow Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime
minister, and his countless guests, to witness tomorrow the first two power
units come into operation.
'There have been times when we have squeezed the government, and times when
the government has squeezed us. But there were no serious delays. That's the
real achievement,' says Mr Asaf Guven of Ata-Insaat, the main contractor for
the dam.
Ata-Insaat, a consortium of three Turkish contractors, was formed specially
to bid for the dam construction work, winning the tender largely through a
cunning financing package.
'The only demand we made was that a foreign exchange portion should be paid
in advance to buy the machinery,' says Mr Guven. With the government in
agreement Ata-Insaat used a Dollars 200m credit, including a US Eximbank
loan of Dollars 110m, to import US Caterpillars to start the site clearance.
From the start, many economists have contested the financial good sense of
such a colossal undertaking. Gap, as a whole, is said by officials to
consume Dollars 2m a day, with the Ataturk development taking the lion's
share. Some economists estimate that these expenditures account for one
third of Turkey's 70 per cent inflation rate.
Mr Guven takes a different view. 'When the full electricity capacity is in
operation, the government will earn between Dollars 800m and Dollars 900m
every year, while still offering the consumer power at three cents per
kilowatt hour. That's extremely cheap.'
Asea Brown Boveri supplied the eight turbines - which each comprise 700
tonnes of generator rotor. For each turbine there are three transformers -
supplied by Brown Boveri before the company joined the Swedish Asea.
The dam is also a remarkable achievement for homegrown Turkish engineering.
The design and civil works, done by Ata-Insaat, have given the company
invaluable experience. Mr Anik, head of DSI, says the original plans made no
provision for the difficult task of closing off the bottom outlet, to allow
the water level to rise sufficiently to cover the turbines. If the job had
not been handled correctly, it could have created what engineers call a
vortex, putting the base of the dam under dangerous pressure.
With its task all but complete, Ata-Insaat now has its sights on contracts
further afield - particularly, it says, in the former Soviet states, where
there is a growing demand for power plants.
