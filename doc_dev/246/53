<LEADPARA>  The end of the drought won't mean the end of problems for the State Water
Project. For California's giant system of reservoirs and aqueducts, nearly
every year is a drought.;    That's because the state project -- one of two
parallel water-delivery systems through the heart of California -- is
committed to supply far more water than it can deliver in all but the rainiest
years.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And that means the cities and farms that rely on the project, including
Santa Clara County, frequently will receive less water than they expected --
and paid for.;    "There will be more 'droughts' in the future because of the
lack of water," said Leo Cournoyer, water supply manager for the Santa Clara
Valley district.;    "We have to have normal (precipitation) or better, or we
are going to have problems," said Larry Mullnix, the Department of Water
Resources official who oversees the project. "We are overextended.";    Here's
Mullnix's problem: This year, the state has promised to deliver 4,157,156
acre-feet of water to 30 water agencies from Yuba City north of Sacramento to
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. (An acre-foot is
325,800 gallons, roughly as much water as a family of five uses in a year).;  
 Rainfall variations;  Given variations in rainfall and size limits of
reservoirs and canals, however, officials estimate they can only deliver about
2.4 million acre-feet year after year. In prolonged droughts like this one,
that figure drops even further.;    Water agencies that depend on the project
say they have been paying for water they'll never get. Metropolitan, for
example, has been paying far more than its share for more than two decades as
a form of insurance, guaranteeing a source of water for its fast-growing
region. But agency officials may never see the 2 million acre-feet a year they
were promised.;    Pat Ferraro, a director of the Santa Clara Valley Water
District, suggests only half-jokingly that the district bill the state for its
share of a $500 million project to reclaim some of San Jose's sewage for
reuse. He notes that the project will provide roughly enough water -- 50,000
acre-feet -- to make up for expected shortfalls in state supplies.;    "I say
we build this thing and send them the bill," he said. "We bought 100,000
acre-feet (of water a year) in good faith. Just because the state of
California and the last three governors didn't finish the contract doesn't
mean we can't sue them.";    Pat Brown's project;    This wasn't the way Gov.
Edmund G. "Pat" Brown planned it.;    The State Water Project that Brown
conceived, lobbied for and built was supposed to store water from the ample
Sierra runoff in the north and move it to cities along the coast and farmers
in the arid southern San Joaquin Valley.;    The bulk of the construction --
Oroville Dam on the Feather River, the massive pumps that suck water out of
the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and the pumps that lift it more than
3,000 feet over the Tehachapi Mountains -- was completed in the 1960s.;    But
environmental and fiscal concerns eventually caught up with the engineers --
stymieing projects like Auburn Dam, on the American River north of Sacramento.
The final blow was the defeat in a 1982 referendum of the Peripheral Canal,
which would have carried Sacramento River water around, rather than through,
the delta. Instead, much of that water flows out to sea rather than down the
California Aqueduct.;    Meanwhile, the contracts optimistically signed by
Brown -- offering limited supplies in the early years but increasing with time
-- were coming due. Commitments to deliver 322,000 acre-feet in 1970 grew to
2.2 million acre-feet in 1980, and topped 4 million acre-feet last year.;   
Metropolitan's first in line;    And for the first time, those who paid for
all that construction wanted all their water -- particularly Metropolitan,
supplier for 15 million Southern Californians.;    Flush with water from the
Colorado River, Metropolitan for years took only a small portion of its state
project supplies, allowing farmers to buy at bargain rates the water
Metropolitan wasn't claiming. But explosive growth in Southern California, and
court decisions trimming California's share of the Colorado water and Los
Angeles' withdrawals from Mono Lake, have forced Metropolitan to seek more of
the state project water it had paid for.;    "Demands have really ballooned in
the last three years," said Mullnix. Five years from now, he noted, it won't
take a five-year drought to prompt water shortages similar to this year's.;   
Trying to stretch the system can end in catastrophe. That's what state
officials did in the first three years of the current drought, when they
delivered up to 2.7 million acre-feet in 1989 on the chance that the rains
would return. As the drought lingered, officials this year have cut off
farmers completely and reduced urban supplies by 90 percent.;    Farmland to
be retired;    As supply problems occur more frequently, adjustments will be
painful. Bob Bellue, chief engineer for the Kern County Water Agency, expects
some farmland to be retired as the surplus water dries up and reliable annual
supplies shrink.;    Faced with these prospects, state officials and major
water suppliers are pushing several projects that will add to the system's
capacity: A major reservoir near Los Banos, underground water storage in Kern
County and changes aimed at pushing more water through the delta.;    Project
backers hope that by increasing concern about water supplies, the drought will
help overcome public resistance to new reservoirs and canals.;    But public
opinion polls say they're right about the concerns but wrong about the
solutions. A January poll by the Los Angeles Times found that Californians
regard the drought as the state's most pressing problem after crime, but that
residents prefer water reclamation and desalination -- and even restrictions
on growth -- to building new reservoirs.;    Moreover, environmentalists still
promise to block any plan with the potential to divert more water from the
delta, the delicate mixing ground for salt and fresh water that is important
to fish and plant life.;    They're particularly worried because populations
of some fish have plummeted in recent years. Even Mullnix concedes that the
pumps, diversions and canals have harmed the delta.;    Barry Nelson,
executive director of the Save San Francisco Bay Association, noted that the
projects under study by state officials would divert more water from the delta
than the Peripheral Canal.;    "The only way the State Water Project is ever
going to deliver a firm yield to meet all their contracts is if we exterminate
our natural resources," he said.;    Supporters insist the price doesn't have
to be that high. Metropolitan General Manager Carl Boronkay, for example, has
been meeting with representatives of agricultural and environmental groups in
a search for ways to build new reservoirs and improve the flow of water
through the delta without harming fish.;  Separate but unequal; Chart shows
