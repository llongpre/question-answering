   The Environmental Protection Agency raised
serious concerns Friday about a controversial proposed dam and
reservoir in Colorado, threatening to scuttle the $500 million
project if no additional safeguards are provided.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said the Two Forks Dam
project near Denver ``could result in very serious adverse
environmental impact'' and ordered the regional office to
immediately examine ``alternative water sources'' with city
officials.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., said Reilly's decision is expected
to kill the proposal. ``Those of us who have been fighting this
project have won. ... I think this is the practical end to this
project,'' said Exon in a telephone interview.
   Reilly announced he had begun procedures which amount to
overruling a construction permit issued earlier this month by the
Corps of Engineers and which could lead to a veto of the project if
compromises are not worked out.
   ``This is the door through which you have to travel to get to a
veto'' of the project, said a senior EPA official, speaking on the
condition that he not be identified by name.
   The Two Forks dam project on the South Platte River southwest of
Denver has been the center of a bitter fight between
environmentalists and Denver area officials who say the dam is
essential to the region's future water needs.
   Environmentalists have said EPA's decision on the dam will be an
early signal of how the Bush administration intends to deal with
environmental and conservation issues.
   ``This action demonstrates the president is serious about
establishing himself as an environmental president,'' said Peter
Berle, president of the National Audubon Society.
   Environmental concerns centered on the fact that the 615-foot
dam and reservoir would flood a vast area where the South Platte
and its North Fork meet about 25 miles southwest of Denver. It
would put under 500 feet of water a 20-mile area including the
scenic Cheesman Canyon, which has some of the best trout fishing in
the state and is home for a variety of wildlife.
   The project also has been attacked by Nebraska officials who
fear that the dam will reduce the flow of water into the Big Bend
wetland region of western Nebraska, a favorite resting spot for
whooping crane and numerous other birds.
   Reilly said the permit as approved by the Corps of Engineers
could have ``very serious adverse environmental impacts ... and may
not provide adequate safeguards.''
   ``I am not convinced that the (Two Forks) dam project as
proposed will avoid environmental harm to the extent practicable or
that the proposed permit conditions will minimize or compensate for
damage to fisheries, wildlife habitat and recreation areas,''
Reilly said in a statement.
   Environmentalists have been urging Reilly to intervene because
the agency's regional administrator, Jim Scherer, had indicated he
favors the project if certain assurances are included to protect
the environment.
   At a news conference in Denver, Scherer said he was
``disappointed that the decision could not be made at the regional
level.'' Scherer said conditions had been put into the permit
``that satisfied a number of concerns I have had.''
   But Reilly overruled the regional administrator, saying that the
project as proposed does not meet the requirements of the Clean
Water Act and directed Scherer to initiate the veto process for the
existing permit.
   The EPA and Corps of Engineers as well as project applicants
have 15 days to try to work out safeguards that might satisfy
Reilly. If they fail to do so, the process would continue, possibly
over several months, leading to a likely veto of the project,
officials said.
