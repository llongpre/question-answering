<HEAD>Parliament Backs Halt To Dam Project, Premier Calls Dam A Symbol
Of Past</HEAD>

   Parliament on Friday approved a halt in
construction of a mammoth hydroelectric project, pending
examination of charges that it would cause massive enviromental
damage.
   Asking for the indefinite moratorium, Premier Miklos Nemeth said
Nagymaros dam was an unwelcome symbol of past times in Hungary,
which is in the throes of political liberalization.
   ``What I want to fight against is not an object,'' he said to
applause. ``The enemy is a decision-making mechanism, a political
power structure,'' he said, in a clear allusion to the Communist
Party's past unassailability.
   After 90 minutes of debate, the 380-member legislature voted
with 30 abstentions to support the government's decision May 13 to
stop building the dam and power station on the Danube river, about
30 miles upstream from Budapest.
   The decision has delighted enviromentalists, who have said the
dam will destroy wetlands and their unique wildlife, and who have
gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures against construction.
   Bu the move angered Czechoslovakia, a Soviet bloc ally and power
project partner that has finished much of its part of construction
further upstream. Hungary is examining its legal options with
Czechoslovakia if it decides to permanently shelve its portion of
the project.
