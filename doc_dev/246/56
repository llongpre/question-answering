   Denver area water officials sought
clarification Tuesday on what steps must be taken to keep the
proposed Two Forks dam and reservoir alive but got no hint on
whether the project will survive.
   ``I think it's an uphill battle,'' William Miller, manager of
the Denver Water Board, told reporters after he and other Denver
area water officials met with the Environmental Protection Agency
about the dam.
   Last Friday, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly stunned the
water board officials by ordering a review of the dam project and
raising broad environmental objections to a construction permit
which earlier this month had been approved by the Army Corps of
Engineers.
   Environmentalists and other critics of the $500 million dam and
reservoir planned on the South Platte River southwest of Denver
immediately declared that Reilly's intervention was tantamount to
killing the project, although no final EPA veto has yet been issued.
   Miller and three other Denver area water officials were among
several dozen people, including representatives of the Corps of
Engineers, who met with Rebecca Hamner, acting EPA assistant
administrator for water, and other EPA officials on the dam project.
   The session was generally described as one in which procedural
details were outlined on what steps proponents of the dam must take
in trying to overcome EPA objections to the project.
   Miller told reporters that he and other proponents of the dam
would resubmit their proposals to EPA regional review officers in
hopes of overcoming Reilly's objections.
   Nevertheless, the Denver official said he was ``disappointed and
hurt'' that Reilly intervened after the agency's regional director
in Denver had indicated that environmental concerns had been
resolved.
   The Corps of Engineers had approved a permit for construction of
the dam on March 16 and the EPA's regional director, Jim Scherer,
had indicated he was satisfied that accommodations had been made to
mitigate environmental concerns. But Scherer was overruled by
Reilly who said last Friday that the project as outlined in the
permit ``could result in very serious adverse environmental
impact.''
   Miller said that while the water board would resubmit the
proposal to the EPA there was no plan to change the project
significantly to provide additional environmental safeguards.
   Another participant in the meeting, Bernie Goode, chief of
regulation for the Corps of Engineers in Washington, said that the
decison on the Two Forks project now rests solely in the hands of
the EPA.
   ``The EPA is in the driver's seat,'' Goode told reporters.
   The Two Forks dam has been the focus of bitter controversy
between Denver water officials, who maintain that it is needed to
meet the region's water needs into the next century, and
environmental and conservation activists.
   Environmental concerns centered on the fact that the 615-foot
dam and reservoir would flood a large area of the South Platte
including a canyon area with some of the best trout fishing in the
state and home for a variety of wildlife.
   The project also has been under attack because of fears that it
will reduce the flow of water into the Big Bend wetland region of
western Nebraska, a favorite resting spot for whooping crane and
thousands of sand hill crane on their migration north.
