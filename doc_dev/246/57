  [TEXT][Excerpts][passage omitted]-Chairman of the State Law 
and Order Restoration Council Senior General Than Shwe said the 
central Myanmar gets insufficient rain and thereby becomes a dry 
zone resulting in the low yield of crops. The people of the 
area still lag behind in development as a result, he said. 
Irrigation networks are now being built under the project for 
greening the nine arid districts in central Myanmar, which will 
eventually raise the standard of living of the people in the 
area. He said it is necessary to make efforts in construction of 
irrigation networks for the speeding of the local populace. 
  The project for greening of the nine arid districts is 
amined 
at conserving water resources, he said. Although irrigation 
networks built in the area are not large, a great number of the 
facilities will provide sufficient water supply for greening the 
area. With an increase in the sown acreage there will be a rise 
in the standard of living of the people, he said. Hence, he 
said, local authorities have been instructed to strive for the 
success of project for greening the nine arid districts. 
  He stressed the need to give priority to establishing forest 
plantations as forests are essential for water supply, 
preventing land erosion and for favourable weather conditions. 
Irrigation networks are being implemented under special 
projects for regional development and enhancing the standard of 
living of the people, he said. He urged farmers of the 
different regions to make efficient utilization of water to earn 
their livelihood and to bring about regional development. 
  He urged service personnel to implement the projects, and 
try 
their best to serve the interests of the nation and the people. 
  He pointed out that Development of transportation and 
communication systems are vital for economic development. 
Hence, he said, attention must be paid to construction and 
repair of roads and bridges which are contributory to trade and 
commerce. He further noted that better transportation and 
communications links will contribute towards economic 
development in all regions, and growing contacts among the 
various national races will lead to consolidating friendship. 
  He spoke of the need to give priority in stages to transport 
and communications for national development. He emphasized that 
the projects for the construction of the six bridges across the 
respective rivers are to be implemented without fail for the 
development of national economy and local people. 
  He pointed out that the special projects are being 
undertaken 
according to the needs of the State. Hence, he said work must 
begin from wherever possible for the success of the projects. 
He said that the State will provide what is necessary in the 
process, and all those responsible are to work hard. 
  He also stressed the need to establish a system with 
responsible personnel who will be overseeing that State funds 
are put to good use. He called on the people to strive in 
concert with the local authorities and do best to complete the 
projects as scheduled. 
  The meeting ended at 3:45 pm. 
  Special pojects 
  Arrangements are being made under Special Projects 
Implementation programme to build six major bridges across the 
river in the various states and division and accordingly the 
bridge across the Thanlwin River near Hpa-an Townships will be 
built to forge national solidarity, bringing about proportionate 
development to border areas and states and divisions, ensuring 
secure and smooth transportation for regular and smooth flow of 
goods and to bring about economic and social development in 
Kayin State. 
  The bridge will be built with iron beams and frame and the 
piers will be built of reinforced concrete. It will be 900 
metre long and the motor road will be 8.5 metres and there will 
footpaths on either side of the road. The bridge will be built 
in such a way that it will be able to withstand 60-ton motor 
vehicles passing over it. 
  As Ayeyarwady River flows from north to south it divides the 
western bank from the eastern bank and therefore the 
communication links between the eastern sector and western 
sector is difficult. The Sagaing Bridge built in the upper part 
of Myanmar has enabled people to travel direct between Kachin 
State, Chin State, Sagaing Division, Mandalay Division and Shan 
State and has helped to bring about development to the region. 
  Similarly, if there is a bridge across the Ayeyarwady River 
near Pyay Township, then there will be a direct communication 
link between Rakhine State, Bago Division, Mayway Division and 
Ayeyarwady Division and this will not only ensure secure and 
smooth transportation, but will also bring about economic and 
social development of the people in the region and when people 
mingle and travel from one place to another it will assist in 
strengthening national unity. 
  In order to improve communication links between the states 
and divisions, a bridge will be built across Ayeyarwady River 
near Pyay Township. It will be a bridge made of iron frames and 
reinforced concrete. It will be 1,275 metre long and will 
include footpaths, each 8.5 metres wide. It will withstand 
60-ton motor vehicles using it. 
  New roads are being built and old ones renovated in 
Ayeyarwady Division in order to be able to transport goods 
smoothly and expeditiously as the division produces the highest 
amount of paddy, fish and meat and agriculture products. 
Arrangements are being made to build brigdes across the river 
so that the roads in the division are connected with one another 
and could be used without any disruptions and have direct links 
with Yangon. Hence Myaungmy Bridge will be built across the 
river near Myaungmya Township and another bridge across Toe 
River near Maubin Township. 
  The Myaugmya Bridge will be built near Payachaung Ward in 
Myaungmya and will be of a prestressed concrete bridge. On 
completion of the bridge, there will be direct links between 
Myaungmya-Einme-Kyaunggon Road, Myaungmya-Einme-Karka-Pathein 
Road and Myaugmya-Labutta Road. 
  The Toe Bridge is also a prestressed concrete type bridge. 
On completion of the bridge, there will be direct links between 
Twantay-Maubin Road, Maubin-Hsarmalauk Road, 
Maubin-Yaylegalay-Mawlamyinegyun Road and Maubin-Kyaiklat Road. 
  The Chaung-U Pakokku Railroad was built to ensure secure and 
smooth transportation and to bring about development to the 
border areas and national races. Arrangements are being made to 
build a bridge across Chindwin River on the Chaung-U-Pakokku 
Railroad between Minywa village in Yesagyo Township and a place 
near Tawkyaunggyi village in Chaung-U Township. 
  This bridge will be made of steel frames and will be 
7,111.04 
feet long and 60.68 feet wide. There will be a motor road, a 
railroad and footpaths on the bridge. 
  On completion of the bridge passenger and goods 
transportation will be speeded up and the development in regions 
on the western bank of Ayeyarwady River and on either bank of 
the Chindwin River will be greatly enhanced. 
  The Myanma Railways is laying the Pakokku-Gangaw-Kalay 
Railroad which will link up with the Chaungy-U-Pakokku Road. 
The Myittha Bridge will be built across the Myittha River at 
Kanywa on eastern bank of the river on the Gangaw-Kalay Road 
section. 
  The Myittha Bridge will be a prestressed concrete bridge and 
will be 680 feet long and 14 to 17 feet wide. On completion of 
the bridge people will be able to travel directly from Gangaw to 
Kalay. Goods produced in the region could be transported 
easily and the people in Chin state and those in the 
Gangaw-Kalay basin will be able to travel about most 
conveniently and this will bring about rapid development in the 
region. 
  The Irrigation Department is making field surveys to find 
good prospects for implementing dam construction projects and 
building new dams in order to realize the objectives of the 
State to produce more crops, to bring about regional development 
and greening of nine dry zones in central parts of Myanmar.
