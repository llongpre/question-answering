   Oregon's Klamath River is the most endangered
river in the nation because of a proposed power project that
threatens ``one of the nation's oustanding whitewater recreational
rivers,'' an environmental group said Wednesday.
   The diversion of the Klamath to generate power would also
threaten several endangered species and sacred Native American
sites, American Rivers said in a report ranking on the nation's 10
most endangered rivers.
   The non-profit group, which works to protect river shorelines
and block construction of some dams, followed the Klamath with
Colorado's South Platte River, which was ranked as the most
endangered in 1988 and 1989.
   The Penobscot River in Maine and the American River in
California were next on the list. The others were: the Bruneau and
Jarbidge Rivers, Idaho; the Alsek and Tatshenshini Rivers, Alaska
and Canada; Passaic River, New Jersey; Cahaba River, Alabama; Jemez
River, New Mexico; and James River, Missouri.
   ``We are noticing more diversity of threat and greater
geographic distribution of the threats,'' said Kevin Coyle, acting
president of American Rivers.
   He said Western rivers have dominated the list in the past.
``Now we have a river in the Southwest, one in New Jersey, Maine,
Missouri. It is the first time a river has ever been listed from
Alaska,'' he said.
   Coyle said the threat against Colorado's South Platte has eased
somewhat because the Environmental Protection Agency is moving to
veto a wetlands permit needed for construction of the Two Forks Dam.
   But he said the river is still near the top of the endangered
list because ``we don't believe the South Platte is a finished
issue by any means.''
   In Idaho, Coyle said the group is concerned about Air Force
plans to turn about a million acres along the Bruneau and Jarbidge
rivers into a bombing range.
   ``The Air Force proposes to use this spectacular wilderness area
for low-level supersonic bombing, including live ordnance
air-to-ground missiles,'' the report said.
   The Alsek and Tatshenshini Rivers are threatened by mining, the
report said, and the Passaic is endangered by plans to eliminate
flooding by building a ``flood tunnel'' to bypass some areas.
   ``On the Jemez in New Mexico, they want to do pumice mining to
make stonewashed blue jeans,'' he said. ``Each of the threats is
very different.''
   The ``clear, clean waters'' of the James River, near
Springfield, Mo., are threatened by a proposed water supply dam
which American Rivers said is of questionable necessity.
   Coyle said the hydropower diversion on the Klamath ``threatens
one of the nation's outstanding whitewater recreational rivers.''
His group is working with others to add the Klamath to the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers System and protect it from construction.
   Federal regulators are to decide this year whether to license
the proposed power project on the Klamath and the Bureau of Land
Management will decide whether to include 19-mile stretch in the
scenic rivers system, he said.
   ``The river segment contains rare year-round whitewater rafting
in the southern Oregon, northern California area. Also threatened
are several federally threatened fish species,'' a blue-ribbon
trout fishery and habitat for peregrine falcons,'' the study said.
   ``In addition, there is concern that some sacred sites of the
Klamath and Shasta tribes would be destroyed or open to
vandalism,'' it said.
