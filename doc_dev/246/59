   The Army Corps of Engineers is seeking $85.5
million to start 10 new water projects from California to New York,
undaunted by a rare rebuff from Congress last year during a budget
squeeze.
   The Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation, meanwhile, plans
to devote 60 percent of its proposed $655 million in construction
money to just three projects in Arizona, Utah and California.
   For the third straight year, the reclamation bureau isn't
planning any new project starts, in line with its transition from
building dams and canals to becoming a water management agency.
   Last year, Congress refused to give money to the corps for the
six new starts it proposed. In the Reagan administration's proposed
budget for fiscal 1990, sent to Congress on Monday, those six were
expanded to 10 projects.
   New starts on water projects have been declining because of tight
budgets and a 1986 law that requires affected communities to put up
their share of funds in the beginning.
   Overall, spending by the corps would total $3.2 billion during
the 12 months starting next Oct. 1, down slightly from the current
$3.26 billion.
   Its construction spending would total $1.22 billion, up 8.9
percent from $1.12 billion.
   The bureau planned to spend $946 million, down 14 percent from
$1.1 billion this year. Its construction spending would be $655
million, down 7.2 percent from $706 million this year, with the
majority of funds going toward the Central Arizona Project, the
Central Utah Project and the Central Valley Project in California.
   Several projects were slated for only minimal spending, said
Interior Undersecretary Earl Geljde, because ``we didn't have enough
money to put them on an efficient construction schedule (and) we're
better off to not start them.''
   The bureau requested $3.7 million to buy equipment for the
Animas-La Plata project in Colorado and New Mexico and $8.75 million
to wind up construction at the Garrison Diversion Unit in North
Dakota, but neither project will get a major push.
   Following are the 10 new Army Corps of Engineer projects. Dollar
figures are given in budget authority, which usually approximates
appropriations in the case of water projects. Outlay figures were
available for spending totals but not for specific projects listed.
   _Cache Creek Settling Basin, California, $5.5 million, flood
control.
   _Santa Ana River Mainstem, California, $20 million, flood control.
   _Ramapo and Mahway rivers, Mahwah, N.J. and Suffern, N.Y.,
$330,000, flood control.
   _Sheyenne River, Riverside to Horace, N.D., $5.5 million, flood
control.
   _Nelsonville, Ohio, levees on the Hocking River, $2.415 million.
