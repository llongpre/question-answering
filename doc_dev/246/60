<F P=106> ["`When the Party Is Determined, We Can Do Anything'" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The slogan "When the 
Party Is Determined, We Can Do Anything!" is seen anywhere in 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  The slogan reflects the revolutionary will and stamina of 
the 
people who are determined to share the destiny with the Workers' 
Party of Korea (WPK) forever. 
  The Korean people have moved mountains and harnessed the sea 
to carry out the party's decisions, displaying a revolutionary 
spirit in the historical course of socialist construction. 
  Suffice it to take a glance at economic construction. 
  When the WPK initiated the construction of the West Sea 
barrage which is of great importance for socialist economic 
construction, the Korean people and People's Army soldiers 
accepted the initiative as their own and turned out in its 
construction. 
  It was a vast and difficult project which would have taken 
dozens of years with the established method. The project 
included the building of dam eight kilometres long across the 
sea scores of metres deep, three locks which can let ships of 
2,000 to 50,000 ton class pass simultaneously, tens of sluice 
gates, railways and motorways on the dam. 
  The soldiers and civilian builders moved ten odd mountains, 
disposed of 15 million cubic metres of earth, tamped two million 
cubic metres of concrete and collected and transported 16 
million cubic metres of stones and gravels to build the dam of 
eternal value in five years with their own design, technology, 
materials and strength. With the construction of the barrage, 
the coastline diminished 20 kilometres and nine islands 
including Ok and Horang islands disappeared. 
  The West Sea barrage is a precious product of the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work of the 
Korean people who unconditionally accept and carry out the 
decisions of the party. 
  When the party intended to make a 10,000-ton press, workers 
of Korea did it without hesitation. The workers of the 
Ryongsong combined general bureau of machinery wrought a miracle 
by completing the processing and assembling of the 10,000-ton 
press and successfully test-operating it in one year or more, 
though it would have taken 4-5 years according to the experience. 
  When the party decided to launch a "200-day campaign" to 
glorify the 40th anniversary of the DPRK founding as a grand 
festival of victors, "200-day campaign youth death-defying corps 
of loyalty" were organised at more than 3,000 units across the 
country in the first ten days of the campaign. The entire 
people rose up as one and achieved great successes in all 
sectors of the national economy, giving full play to the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work. 
  Dressing plant No. 3 of Komdok with a capacity of 10 million 
tons built in one year on top of a mountain 1,200 metres above 
sea level, the Sangwon cement complex with a capacity of 
millions of tons, the Pyongbuk smeltery, a powerful non-ferrous 
metal producer, and many other edifices of eternal value are all 
associated with the feats of the Korean people and People's Army 
soldiers who accept the party's decisions as their revolutionary 
will.
