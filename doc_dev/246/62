   Chiefs of Amazon Indian tribes ended a
historic meeting Friday with a demand to stop plans to build a
hydroelectric dam that would flood native lands.
   Hundreds of Indians, wearing colored feathers, beads and red and
black paint, stood and chanted their support as Indian leader Ailton
Krenac read an appeal to protect Amazonia, home to most of Brazil's
220,000 native people.
   ``We do not want the construction of dams on the Xingu River and
on other rivers in the Amazon, because they threaten Indian
nations,'' he said. The mostly white audience of townspeople and
representatives of environmental groups cheered and applauded.
   More than 500 Indians from about 40 native groups met for five
days in this eastern Amazon city, 2,000 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro, to protest the proposed Belo Monte Dam on the Xingu River,
an Amazon tributary. It was the first time Indians in Brazil set
aside longstanding tribal rivalries and banded together in a
political movement.
   The reservoir of the $5.8 billion dam would flood 500 square
miles of rain forest. The dam would have a generating capacity of 11
million kilowatts _ 40 percent more than that of Grand Coulee, the
biggest hydroelectric dam in the United States.
   ``For a long time, the white man has ignored our thinking and the
spirit of our ancestors. Now this must stop. Our territory is the
sacred site of our people, the home of our creator that cannot be
violated,'' Krenac said.
   The government contends Brazil must tap the vast hydroelectric
potential of the Amazon basin to progress. Federal electric power
officials at the gathering told the Indians that dams will be built.
Earlier in the week, one Indian woman thrust a machete just inches
from the face of an electricity company representative. Other tribal
people said that was merely a symbolic gesture.
   Congressman Tadeu Franca, pledged to carry on the Indians' fight
in Brasilia, the capital. ``Because of this meeting, it will be
Indians, working together _ not some presidential decree _ that will
build the Indians' history,'' he said.
   ``Nothing like this has ever happened before. The Indians will go
back to their villages with the sense that something really new and
important has happened,'' said Terry Turner, a U.S. anthropologist
who has worked more than 20 years with the Kayapo Indians.
   Construction of the dam is scheduled to start in 1993. It must
first be approved by Congress.
   Brazil has shown interest in getting partial financing for the
project from the World Bank, but Indians and environmental groups
are asking the Washington-based institution not to put up any money.
   In a small victory this week, the Indians won an agreement from
the government electric power company in Amazonia to change the name
of the project to Belo Monte from Kararao. Kararao is a war cry of
the Kayapo tribe and was offensive to other tribes.
