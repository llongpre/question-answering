<LEADPARA>  FROM ITS quaint main street, friendly citizens and clean mountain air you'd
never guess this Sierra Nevada foothill city has been the epicenter of a
controversy for three decades.;    The ruckus is over a proposed dam, one that
could flood up to 24 miles each of the middle and north forks of the American
River.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     If it happens, California will lose two premiere whitewater runs, a couple
of tranquil floats, miles of hiking, horseback and mountain bike trails and
some of the finest gold panning water in the state.;    Replacing such a
recreational paradise would be impossible at any cost.;    The price of
destroying it isn't cheap, either -- somewhere between $1 billion and $2
billion by most estimates. That's enough to make Auburn the most expensive dam
ever built in the United States.;    Despite these drawbacks, proponents of
the dam say the project must go through. Their reasoning: a dam at Auburn is
needed to protect Sacramento, which is downstream, from the threat of floods.;
   Opponents of the project agree Sacramento needs improved flood control.
But, they say, there are better ways to achieve this goal than building
another dam on the American, a river system that already has 18 major
impoundments.;    Furthermore, they argue, a dam at Auburn might actually
increase the risk of flood. This is because the earth beneath the dam-site is
crisscrossed with faults. If a tremor were to ever cause the dam to fail, the
outskirts of Sacramento could be underwater in half an hour or less.;   
Experts disagree over the probability of such an earthquake-triggered
collapse. In any event, opponents of the dam say it is not worth finding out
who is right.;    Instead, they favor creating what they call the "American
River National Recreation Area," a federally-managed domain that would protect
the stretches of river now threatened by construction of the Auburn Dam.;   
Support for such an area is gaining momentum. Still, the recreation area is a
relatively new idea -- and therefore an underdog -- compared to the proposed
dam.;    Indeed, there have been at least a dozen different attempts over the
past 30 years to authorize some sort of dam at Auburn.;    The latest such
attempt calls for a 550-foot-high, "flood control only" structure.
Essentially, this means a heavy earth-and-concrete dam with one or more holes
in its base. During a flood, water would accumulate behind the dam and drain
slowly out the holes.;    Proponents of this design say it would minimize
seismic concerns since the dam would only create a reservoir during relatively
brief, high-water periods. They argue that having a temporary reservoir also
would minimize environmental damage.;    Opponents say the damage to the
rivers would still be severe. They worry that sometime in the future it will
be all too easy to plug up the holes in the dam's base and create a permanent
reservoir.;    The whole matter should come to head in Congress, probably
before the end of the year.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;  For more information on
