On Water Projects, Focus on Completions

   The Interior Department proposed to slow work on early stages of many dams, irrigation systems and other water projects in order to focus spending on projects that are close to completion. 

   The recommendation for fiscal 1988 funding goes to Congress, which allocates spending among projects largely on political considerations. 
Wayne Marchant, acting assistant secretary for water and science, conceded that "we anticipate objections from delegations of states where projects will be slowed down." 
But he said he hoped the concept behind the recommendation would appeal to lawmakers. 

   Willingness to defer projects isn't strong in Congress. 
Yesterday, the House approved 406-8 a clean-water bill that would provide $18 billion for local sewer-construction grants and loans, and $2 billion for other water-pollution programs over nine years. 

   The measure is identical to one President Reagan "pocket vetoed" last year by not signing it after Congress adjourned. 
Yesterday's vote seemed to assure that the House would override any veto. 
The Senate, where 75 members have endorsed the same bill, is expected to approve it early next week. 

   While the administration seeks to reallocate funding for western dams and water-supply projects, it proposes a modest $97 million increase in the total of that funding, to $700 million for fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1. 

   The principal projects where work would slow under the Interior Department proposal are the Belle Fourche, S.D., Garrison, N.D., and O'Neill, Neb., units of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program; the Web rural water-development project in South Dakota; salinity control and recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement in states along the Colorado River, and an expansion of the Columbia Basin irrigation system, mostly in Washington state. 
The plan also would continue a slowdown on the Auburn-Folsom South unit of California's Central Valley Project. 

   Projects that would be accelerated under the proposal include the Central Arizona Project, Central Utah Project and dam-safety work at the Central Arizona Project's dams; Stewart Mountain Dam, Arizona; Jackson Lake Dam, Wyoming; and Fontenelle Dam, Wyoming. 

   Interior's Mr. Marchant said the changes "will ensure water delivery and repayment on several major projects as rapidly as possible." 
At the same time, he noted that "we don't intend to terminate any projects."
