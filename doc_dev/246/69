   In order to build a series of
hydroelectric dams, Turkey today cut the flow of the Eurphrates
River to Syria and Iraq in a move that could cause problems for the
two arid nations over the next month.
   Invoking the name of Allah, President Turgut Ozal pushed a
button that closed the hatches of the giant Ataturk Dam. The action
will allow engineers to fill a reservoir to a height of 396 feet
and build a concrete plug for a diversion channel as part of the
construction project.
   During the one-month stoppage, Syria and Iraq will get less
water from the tributaries of the Euphrates, the river that has
been the lifeblood throughout history for the area that once formed
ancient Mesopotamia.
   The ceremony today was a moment of pride and accomplishment for
Turkey, which views the Southeast Anatolia project to build more
than a dozen dams as the key to the economic development of the
backward region.
   But the event is considered a cause for worry for Iraq and
Syria, which are highly dependent on the waters of the 1,460-mile
Euphrates River. It was the lifeblood of ancient Mesopotamia, a
part of modern-day Iraq.
   For one month, Syria and Iraq will receive about one-fourth of
the water they normally get from the tributaries of the Euphrates.
   Turkey said that since November, it has released extra water to
Syria and Iraq to allow them to store water in reservoirs for use
during the cutoff.
   Syria has made no statement on the water stoppage. Iraq sent its
deputy foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoun, to Turkey last month to ask
for a stoppage of two weeks instead of the planned one month.
   Hamdoun said the cutoff would not provoke a major crisis in
Iraqi agriculture, but it would cause damage in some areas.
   Iraqi irrigation and agriculture officials said today that First
Undersecretary Abdul Sattar Salman will head a high-level
delegation to the Turkish capital to discuss problems arising from
cutting the Euphrates flow.
   Turkey on Monday sent a foreign ministry delegation to tour
Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to deliver a message that it
does not intend to use its control of the rivers for political
leverage.
   Syria is more dependent on the river, because Iraq has the
Tigris River in its territory. But Syria is in a position to divert
more of the Euphrates River water to its own reservoirs and allow
just a trickle to Iraq.
   ``This is a problem they will have to solve among themselves,''
said a Turkish official who asked for anonymity.
   Ever since it started building dams on the Euphrates in the
1960s, Turkey has periodically reassured its neighbors they would
all share the water.
   Once the project of 15 dams and 18 hydroelectric power plants is
completed, however, Turkey will have a stranglehold on the waters
of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.
   The first generating unit of the Ataturk Dam is to start
production in May 1991. The dam, about 100 miles from the Syrian
border near Sanliursa, is the centerpiece of the massive Southeast
Anatolia project, designed to harness the waters of both Euphrates
and Tigris with a chain of dams and hydroelectric power plants.
   When completed in 2006, the project will produce 22 billion
kilowatt hours of electricity annually and irrigate an area of 4
million acres. This would double the yield in many crops in Turkey,
producing $5 billion in surplus food, officials say.
