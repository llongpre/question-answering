   The first phase of a huge dam
designed to prevent North Korea from flooding out the Olympic Games
in Seoul neared completion Friday on the line separating North and
South.
   The first phase of the South Korean ``peace dam'' is scheduled
to be finished next month. The Olympic Games open in Seoul on Sept.
17.
   The rockfill dam sits in a valley close to the Demilitarized
Zone separating the two Koreas. It will cut off the flow of the Han
River, which originates in North Korea and runs past Seoul before
flowing into the Yellow Sea.
   Construction began in late 1986, shortly after North Korea began
building a hydroelectric dam on an upper stream of the river.
   Despite North Korea's repeated claim that its dam was designed
only to generate power, Seoul officials suspect that it also is
intended to unleash a ``water offensive'' against South Korea.
   If the North Korean dam collapsed, about 26 billion tons of
water could submerge most of Seoul and surrounding areas with a
``nuclear force,'' South Korean officials say.
   ``We have done something which was considered difficult to be
done in time,'' Chung In-ho of the government's Industrial Site and
Water Resources Development Corp. told reporters visiting the dam
site near Hwachun, a border town 55 miles northeast of the capital.
   South Korea is building the dam on a phased program designed to
match the progress of the North Korean dam under construction about
22 over the DMZ.
   South Korea hurried the first phase of the project in fear that
North Korea would try to flood some major sports facilities in
Seoul along the Han River before the Olympics.
   ``If North Korea attempts to flood us, the damage would be far
beyond our imagination,'' Lee Hee-sung, chief designer of the
state-run Industrial Site, said.
   Lee said South Korea poured $250 million into the first phase of
construction. The dam would eventually cost more than $600 million
U.S. dollars, he said.
   The dam will be at least 215 feet high, but it could be made
higher to match the North Korean dam, he said.
   He said satellite and other military intelligence reports show
that North Korea is also accelerating work on its dam, digging
diversion tunnels that made the river bed dry so that ground work
for the dam could start.
   The South Korean engineer said he believes that the Soviet Union
is helping North Korea with the construction.
   Lee questioned the economic feasibility of the North Korean
project, saying that when it is finished in four or five years, the
dam could probably utilize only 10 percent of water it takes in.
