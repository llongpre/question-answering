<LEADPARA>  Santa Clara Valley Water District officials, fearing the county will get less
water from state and federal systems in the 21st century than it does now, are
looking at building their first new reservoir in nearly 40 years.;   It could
store water brought into the Santa Clara County from the Central Valley in wet
years to be used in dry years when water imports slow to a trickle. Five sites
are under consideration in the hills east of Morgan Hill and Gilroy.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Building a new reservoir in the southeastern part of the county is critical
for the water district to meet its needs in 2020, officials say.;   The
district is revising its 1975-vintage master plan, recognizing that the state
may reduce supplies from the Central Valley to preserve water quality in the
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta even as the county's population and demand
for water increase over the next three decades.;   As a result, Santa Clara
County might have to rely more heavily on its local supplies in a critically
dry period, said Leo Cournoyer, the district's water supply manager.;   Yet
now, the county in wet years often cannot take all its entitled delta water
from the state and federal systems because its reservoirs are filled by local
storm runoff. So water can't be saved for a drought.;   For example, this year
because of the drought, deliveries to Santa Clara County from the federal
Central Valley Project have been cut 75 percent. The State Water Project
sliced deliveries to the county 80 percent.;   If a new reservoir is built in
the next 10 or 20 years, it would be filled with water from the federal San
Felipe pipeline. That system and the attached local network now bring water
from San Luis Reservoir in Merced County over Pacheco Pass to Calero
Reservoir, then to the district's treatment plants and on to retail
customers.;   In 1990, district officials began investigating 13 potential
reservoir sites in the rugged, undeveloped mountains east of Morgan Hill and
Gilroy, and have narrowed the list to five candidates.;   Last Tuesday, the
water district board approved spending $125,500 to begin detailed studies of
those five sites.;   Whatever site is chosen, it would be a big reservoir.;  
The largest site, Los Osos, would hold nearly a third again as much water as
Anderson Reservoir, now the biggest in the district's system.;   The other
four sites could accommodate reservoirs much larger than any of the other nine
existing reservoirs.;   The last dams built by the valley water district were
Lexington, completed in 1952, and Anderson, finished in 1950. Both reservoirs
were constructed to cope with the county's postwar growth. The other district
reservoirs -- Vasona, Almaden, Guadalupe, Calero, Coyote and Stevens Creek --
were completed in the mid-1930s.;   Two other South County reservoirs -- Uvas
and Chesbro -- were completed in 1955 by the former Gavilan Water District,
which merged with the valley water district in 1987.;   The outlook has
changed dramatically since the 1970s, when district officials were banking on
the San Felipe pipeline for enough water to meet the county's needs well into
the 21st century.;   But since then, the State Water Resources Control Board
set water quality standards for the delta. To achieve those standards, a
minimum amount of water has to flow through its sloughs and rivers. That means
less water is available to be pumped to hundreds of contractors of the state
and federal water systems statewide.;   Because of that decision, neither of
the two systems will be able to deliver all the water they've promised. So all
of the contracting water agencies -- including the Santa Clara Valley Water
District -- are expected to fight over a smaller pool.;   And the outcome of
the state board's current round of hearings on the San Francisco Bay and the
delta is likely to be further restrictions on how much water can be pumped
out, Cournoyer said.; SITES; The Santa Clara Valley Water District is looking
at five sites in the mountains east of Gilroy and Morgan Hill as potential
locations for another reservoir. It would be used to store water brought in
from state and federal systems in the Central Valley in wet years to be
consumed in dry years.; Existing reservoirs; Anderson Reservoir;
