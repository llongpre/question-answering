   Angry Amazon Indians thrust lances and
machetes at government electric power officials Tuesday in a second
day of heated debate over a proposed hydroelectric dam that would
flood tribal lands.
   More than 500 Indians from 37 native groups packed the city's
community center for the historic encounter of tribes in this east
Amazon city, 2,000 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   The meeting is the first united political movement by the native
tribes, and seeks to block construction of the Kararao dam on the
Xingu River, an Amazon tributary. Brazil says the energy is vital
for development in this land of 144 million people.
   Tempers flared when Jose Lopes, engineering director for
Eletronorte, the government Amazon power company, told the Indians
the dam would not raise the river beyond its present level.
   ``You're lying! Everything you say is a lie!'' shouted Tuira, a
Kayapo Indian woman as she strode through the crowd and brandished a
machete in Lopes' face.
   Her words in Kayapo were translated into broken Portuguese by
Chief Paulo Paiakan. He said her gesture is ``one of our traditions,
it does not mean war.''
   Kayapo warrior Uh-Te also protested angrily and repeatedly thrust
a red-feathered lance at the company offical.
   ``We don't know what energy means. I was raised on game, fish and
wild honey in the forest. Why didn't you consult us about the dam?''
said Uh-Te with Paiakan translating.
   The Indians, some wearing a green-and-yellow feathered headresses
and black warpaint on their faces and bodies, raised their war clubs
in a sign of agreement.
   Lopes said Eletronorte was preparing an environmental impact
report on the Kararao project. ``If the dam affects Indian land, it
must be approved by congress,'' he said.
   Brazil's Indian population has been decimated by development
projects such as hydroelectric dams and the Trans-Amazon highway.
There are about 220,000 Indians left in Brazil, down from an
estimated 5 million when the country was discovered by Portuguese
explorers in 1500.
   ``The dam is not a reality until construction starts,'' and that
won't happen for at least five years,'' Lopes said. He said
Eletronorte has scrapped plans for other contested Amazon dams at
Babaquara and Iriri.
   Chief Paiakan also complained that Indians had not been consulted
about the name of the dam. Kararao is a Kayapo war cry, he said.
``To our youths, the government is calling us to war,'' Paiakan said.
   Lopes promised the project would be given a ``white name.''
   Earlier in Brasilia, Interior Minister Joao Alves said the
government would not consider stopping the Kararao project. He said
the dam was fundamental for Brazil's future and would dislocate only
about 280 Indians.
   Kararao will generate 11 million kilowatts of electricity, Alves
said _ second only to the Itaipu dam, the world's largest, located
on Brazil's southwestern border with Paraguay.
   Brazilian and international environmental groups attending the
five-day meeting said the Kararao project was probably unstoppable.
   ``I don't think it's likely they'll stop construction of Kararao.
But that doesn't mean the meeting is a waste,'' said Barbara
Bramble, a director of the Washington-based National Wildlife Fund.
   ``This could be a real milestone in the formation of alliances
among Amazonian peoples to work together to save the place they live
in.''
   Joining the protesters was British rock star Sting, who told the
Amazon Indian chiefs he was starting an international campaign to
raise money to create a huge Amazon National Park. He said the
campaign would begin April 12 in Paris.
   ``I'm not here on behalf of one people. If the rain forest dies
all of us are in danger,'' Sting said.
   He said he got permission for his project from President Jose
Sarney.
