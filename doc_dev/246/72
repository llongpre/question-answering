   Construction of part of a shopping center
adjacent to Manassas National Battlefield Park will be halted
indefinitely to prevent damage to federally protected wetlands,
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials said today.
   ``It's a dream come true,'' said Betty Rankin, president of the
Save the Battlefield Coalition, which has been fighting the
proposed William Center complex.
   ``The Army Corps of Engineers has accomplished, at least
temporarily, what developers and the county refused to do. We all
feel relieved,'' she said.
   The cease-and-desist order issued Wednesday applies to work
being done at Young's Branch, a creek running through the Civil War
battlefield site, and on adjacent wetlands. Developers
Hazel@Peterson Cos. have started construction of one of two roads
that would cross the creek.
   The stop-work order, which extends indefinitely, was issued
because the developers violated a corps provision requiring that
the Army be notified when a project could affect a historic
property, said corps spokesman Bill Brown.
   ``Our concern is with the two roads crossing the creek,'' Brown
said. ``That work could have an impact on the park.''
   John T. (Til) Hazel, president of the development group, has 10
days from receipt of the letter to explain why the Army wasn't
notified about the road, Brown said.
   The stop-work order could entirely block construction of the
project or force the developer to alter its design if an
investigation determines that the park would be adversely affected,
Brown added.
   Preservationists claim construction of the massive project,
which includes a 1.2-million-square-foot shopping mall, 1.7 million
square feet of office space and 560 homes, would destroy 50 acres
of wetlands and ruin beaver dams and rare plants spread throughout
the 542-acre tract.
   Historians feel the project will destroy forever the sanctity of
the still-rustic setting of two crucial Civil War battles.
   Robert Kelly, a spokesman for Hazel@Peterson, told The
Washington Post that his firm would do everything in its power to
comply with the Army's requests.
   The work-stoppage order came as proposals to block the project
were gaining momentum in Congress.
   On Tuesday, a House Interior and Insular Affairs panel held a
hearing on several congressional proposals to take control of the
development tract and add it to the 4,600-acre park.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., on Wednesday offered legislation that
would deprive Hazel@Peterson of direct access to the site from
Interstate 66. The measure failed in the appropriations
subcommittee, but Warner said he would introduce it before the full
Appropriations Committee.
