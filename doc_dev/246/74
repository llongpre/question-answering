   Presidential athletics often makes
people think of touch football in the Kennedy White House, but
Herbert Hoover invented a sport that makes those games look like
tea parties, say devotees of ``Hoover-ball.''
   ``Hoover-ball is not a sport for wimps,'' said Scott Sailor, who
is organizing the 1988 Hoover-Ball National Championship Aug. 7 in
West Branch, Hoover's birthplace.
   ``Hoover-ball'' is like volleyball played with a six-pound
medicine ball, except players must catch the ball and heave it back
over the eight-foot net. The hardest play may be serving, from 33
feet away, or receiving serve, where the ball comes crashing down
faster than the stock market in October 1929.
   ``One of the reasons for the tournament is that Hoover has had a
bad reputation in history. People think of the Depression when his
name is mentioned,'' said Sailor, part-time special events
coordinator for the Hoover Presidential Library and Museum here.
   ``We want to show there is more to Hoover, we want to show a
more personal side,'' he said.
   A medicine ball is constructed with a bag of sand at its core,
which is wrapped in cotton matting and covered by leather. Used
primarily by boxers, whose trainers bash them in the stomach with
it while they do situps, the ball is heavy and difficult to catch
when it comes flying down.
   When Hoover, the nation's 31st president, took office in 1929,
he carried a portly 210 pounds on a 5-foot-11-inch frame. His
physician, Admiral Joel T. Boone, was concerned and advised
excercise.
   The Republican president strung up a net on the south lawn of
the White House and ordered Cabinet members and other dignitaries
to divide into two teams.
   Except for Sundays, Hoover, Cabinet members and Supreme Court
justices played the game every day _ national holidays included _
from 7 a.m. to 7:30 a.m., regardless of weather.
   Teams of two to four players must catch the ball on the fly and
return it without passing. A point is won when the opposing team
fails to catch the ball or throws it out of bounds.
   ``It required less skill than tennis, was faster and more
vigorous, and therefore gave more exercise in a short time,''
Hoover wrote in his memoirs.
   ``Stopping a six-pound ball with steam back of it, returning it
with similar steam, is not pink-tea stuff.''
   Hoover lost 25 pounds playing the game. But, like his hopes for
a second term, the game faded away.
   Sailor and members of the Hoover Library are reviving it,
however, with the tournament held in observance of Hoover's birth
in 1874.
   Sailor said two teams from Kansas City, Mo., including a writer
from Sports Illustrated, will participate, as will about a dozen
other rag-tag squads.
