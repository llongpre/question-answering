  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (CNS) -- According to a survey by 
relevant research institutions, Chinese sturgeons have 
extricated themselves from a predicament as a result of the 
construction of the Gezhou Dam at the river's upper reaches, 
with the young sturgeons now appearing in many places at the 
river's lower reaches in Anhui, Jiangxi and Jiangsu Provinces 
and the Shanghai Municipality, indicating success of the 
comprehensive sturgeon rescue plan including artificial 
sturgeon-breeding and the sending back of young sturgeons into 
the river. The Chinese sturgeon, an important endangered 
aquatic animal protected by the Chinese Government, used spawn 
in the Jinsha River, a branch of the Yangzte at its upper 
reaches. [sentence as received] With the construction of the 
Gezhou Dam, this species of fish was greatly reduced in number 
since their way back upstream for spawning had been cut off by 
the dam. In order to protect this variety of fish, considered a 
precious "living fossil", the Chinese Sturgeon Research 
Institute succeeded in developing an artificial sturgeon 
reproduction programme in 1984 and since that time they have 
sent back 2.35 million young sturgeons into the river. A survey 
conducted in 1991 showed that the number of this fish in the 
river has nearly reached the level before the construction of 
the dam. 
  According to experts, the above success has offered 
beneficial experience for the protection of precious endangered 
species facing similar environmental problems with the 
construction of the three Gorges Project.
