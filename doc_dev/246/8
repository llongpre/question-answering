   Hydro-Quebec plans to advance the construction dates of three hydroelectric dams in the James Bay region of northern Quebec. 

   Originally, Hydro-Quebec's development plan called for the dams -- costing a total of 7.5 billion Canadian dollars ($6 billion) -- to be completed between 1995 and 1997. 
The new plan calls for completion of all three between 1995 and 1996. 

   A spokesman for the provincially owned electric utility said the decision to advance the construction dates results from agreements reached in the past year for the sale of large blocks of power to utilities in New York state, Vermont and Maine. 

   The three dams, to be built on the La Grande River system, will have total generating capacity of 2,464,000 kilowatts. 
The dams, known as LG-1, Brisay and Laforge-1, will be the first new basic-load capacity built by the utility since completion of the LG-4 dam in 1986. 
In 1982, the utility delayed earlier plans to build the dams because of a huge energy surplus that resulted from the first 15 billion dollar phase of the James Bay project. 

   Construction continues on two other large hydroelectric projects, one in the James Bay area, to provide peak-load power. 

   The spokesman said Hydro-Quebec hopes construction of LG-1, the largest of the three dams, can begin this year, with work on the other two expected in 1989.
