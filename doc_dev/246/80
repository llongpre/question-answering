  [Text] Kerman, 23 Farvardin [12 April] KEYHAN News Service 
-- Speaking to a group of students in the municipality of 
Sirjan, the executive vice-president of the republic said: With 
the completed construction of 80 dams by the end of the Second 
Five-Year Plan, 70 percent of the nation's surface water will be 
captured. 
  Hamid Mirzadeh, executive vice-president of the republic, 
also discussed the government's economic, social, development, 
and policymaking plans. He said: During the First Five-Year 
Plan, the government was able to take effective steps along with 
the nation to create suitable conditions for more investments 
throughout the country, and in this regard it has so far made 
great changes in the industrial sector. He added: Construction 
is under way right now on 80 water-earth dams, and when these 
projects go into full operation 70 percent of the nation's water 
will be anchored. 
  He said the annual water existing in the country is 120 
billion cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]]. He said: Despite all the 
efforts that have been made, only 20 billion m[.sup]3[/] of 
water is anchored annually. 
  Mirzadeh noted that in the last few years major changes have 
been made in the industrial sector. He said: Steel production, 
which has not even reached 1 million tons per year in the last 
few years, is now four times greater annually. 
  He also discussed literacy training. He said: Fortunately, 
with the attention that has been given to this matter, 
illiteracy has decreased from 50 percent to less than 20 percent. 
  Continuing his remarks, the executive vice-president of the 
republic said: The government is trying, through increased 
investments, to improve the nation's economy. In this regard, 
since the beginning of the current year [21 March 1994], several 
large projects have gone into operation, including the Sarijan 
Gol Gahar Iron Ore Complex.
