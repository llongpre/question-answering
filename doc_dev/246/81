  [Text] Zhengzhou, May 30 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank 
financed resettlement project has proved to be a stunning 
success as the first group of more than 10,000 residents have 
moved to a new settlement area to make way for a large scaled 
water control project at Xiaolangdi on the middle reaches of the 
Yellow River. 
  The 570 million U.S. dollar resettlement project should be 
held up as an example to follow in future resettlement, said a 
World Bank official, after an on-the-spot investigation of the 
resettlement area. 
  The first group of resettlers have moved into 12 new 
villages 
where water and electricity supply is available. 
  "We used to live in cave dwellings," a local peasant Tu told 
the World Bank official. "Now the conditions are much better. 
[no closing quotation mark as received] 
  Persisting in the principle of resettlement through 
development, the local government has built houses totaling 
220,000 square meters and created a dozen hectares of new land. 
The 12 new villages are accessible by roads. In addition, more 
than 800 local peasants have been given jobs in more than 30 old 
and new industrial enterprises. 
  The 300 households from the Xiaolangdi village of Mengjin 
County, Henan Province, have moved into new detachment houses 
[as received]. The village has also built a primary school and 
a kindergarten. Last year the village invested three million 
yuan in a new steel rolling mill which may produce 40-million 
yuan worth of products a year. 
  Located 40 km north of Luoyang city, in central China's 
Henan 
Province, the Xiaolangdi water control project, China's second 
largest after the Three Gorges Dam on the middle reaches of the 
Chang Jiang, will play an important role in diverting the Yellow 
River, handling floods, generating power and controlling 
sediment, according to experts. 
  The project will displace 180,000 rural people of 190 
villages in eight counties of Henan and Shanxi Provinces. 
  In addition, five million sq. m. [square meters] of houses 
and cave dwellings, and seats of 11 township governments, 250 
factories and enterprises will have to be moved. 
  The officials in charge of resettlement of Xiaolangdi water 
control project said the relocation of residents from the 
construction area completed so far was only a very small part of 
the entire resettlement work for Xiaolangdi Dam, and greater 
efforts should be made to relocate the remaining 170,000 rural 
population from the dam area. 
  According to the resettlement plan, 154,000 more rural 
residents will have to be relocated by the turn of this century, 
while the remaining 17,000 will be relocated during the second 
phase during 2010-2011 period. 
  The local officials added that supervised management system 
will be introduced in resettlement work of Xiaolangdi water 
control dam, which means that specially-assigned engineers will 
carry out an overall supervised management on relocation of 
resettlers, and social and economic appraisal organizations are 
also supposed to give an objective and fair assessment of the 
resettlement, in a bid to protect the legitimate rights of 
resettlers.
