As water supplies shrink, Ventura County officials have begun looking at a 
virtual sea of reclaimed water to float them out of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
At least four water-reclamation projects are under review. They could supply a 
steady stream of treated waste water to nurture farmers' fields and keep golf 
courses and parks from turning brown. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that reclaimed water projects could supply Ventura County with 
up to 37,000 acre-feet of water a year, which is 9% of the county's total 
annual demand. 
</P>
<P>
"People are very aware of the drought and the significant impact reclaimed 
water has on keeping public places green without having to give something up to 
do it," said David Burkhardt, assistant manager for the Ventura County Regional 
Sanitation District. 
</P>
<P>
Already, waste water that once was discharged by local sewage plants into the 
oceans and streams is being put to an increasing number of uses. 
</P>
<P>
In Lake Sherwood, the Triunfo County Sanitation District sells 6,000 acre-feet 
of treated waste water each year from the Tapia Wastewater Reclamation Facility 
to nearby golf courses. An acre-foot is equivalent to about 326,000 gallons of 
water, enough to supply a family of four for a year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 years, the city of Ventura has been recycling 820 acre-feet of 
waste water annually to irrigate two city golf courses and parks near the 
treatment plant. And in Camarillo, the city has for the past 10 years provided 
a portion of its waste water to Smith's Ranch, a 400-acre vegetable farm that 
grows crops used in processed foods. 
</P>
<P>
Additional water reclamation projects planned in Thousand Oaks, Moorpark and 
the Oak Park-North Ranch area could supply millions of gallons more water each 
day, Burkhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Oak Park-North Ranch facility, reclaimed water would 
completely replace the potable water used to irrigate the golf course. And in 
Moorpark, Ventura County Waterworks District No. 1 is polling 60 agricultural 
customers to determine what the demand for water will be, manager Reddy Pakala 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But reclaimed water will never completely replace water intended for drinking 
and farming. Because of health concerns, reclaimed water, even if it is 
subjected to rigorous treatment to remove all the bacterial impurities, is 
restricted for use only on certain crops. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, even farmers allowed to use it have not been enthusiastic about 
reclaimed water supplies, citing health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing about reclaimed water is health," said Dave Pommer, who manages 
the 900-acre lemon orchard owned by U.T.T. Development. Pommer also is a board 
member of the Assn. of California Water Agencies and the Ventura County Farm 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can clear up the health issue, I'm sure farmers will use it," Pommer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tertiary treatment removes most of the impurities and bacteria in sewage. But 
it leaves in some of the nitrates that would actually be beneficial to farmers 
who use fertilizers for their crops, said Bob Quinn, an engineer for the county 
Water Resources Department. But some farmers still object to the very idea of 
using waste water, no matter how much it is cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem in expanding the use of treated waste water is the up-front 
costs of building reclamation facilities and installing pipelines to distribute 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
At Lake Sherwood, reclaimed water costs $436 an acre-foot, nearly 50% more than 
the highest prices farmers in Ventura County pay for irrigation water. 
</P>
<P>
"Farmers can't buy water at $436 per acre-foot and stay in business. Nobody 
would be able to buy the crops they grow," Burkhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe that, as the cost of imported water rises, reclaimed water 
could become more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest selling point that proponents of reclaimed water make is about the 
availability of the supplies. Households dump the same amount of sewage into 
the sewer system year-round, and reclaimed water can be counted on when other 
supplies are low. 
</P>
<P>
"The supply of reclaimed water is very steady. The number of houses doesn't 
change very fast," Burkhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
There is so much demand on Triunfo's reclaimed water supplies that the agency 
is planning the construction of a reservoir somewhere in the Malibu Creek 
drainage basin to store water for use during periods of high demand. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary studies indicate the dam would cost about $18 million to build and 
would likely require the preparation of an environmental impact report, 
Burkhardt added. 
</P>
<P>
Still, agency officials are looking for a site for the dam and have identified 
at least two in Ventura County. One is near the Ahmanson Ranch and another site 
straddles the Ventura-Los Angeles county line at Donnell Ranch south of Lake 
Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a project that would make a lot of water available to customers by 
1995," Burkhardt said.
