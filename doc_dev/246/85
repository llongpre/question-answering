<HEAD>Government Cancels Dam Project Near Prague</HEAD>

   The government has canceled a
long-planned project to build a dam and hydroelectric power station
in a river valley west of Prague because it would cause ecological
damage, it was reported Thursday.
   Ecologists said it was the first case when a major project has
been canceled for ecology reasons in Czechoslovakia, expressing the
growing official and popular concern over increased pollution, the
Communist daily Rude Pravo reported.
   Serious objections to the Krivoklat dam, which was initiated in
the 1960s, were raised by the Ministry of Culture and local
officials, and that led to several postponements of the project.
   In 1977 the United Nations Educational and Science Organization
declared that the area should be preserved.
   Flooding in the Berounka river valley would destroy fauna and
flora surviving in the area since the Ice Age, as well as valuable
forests which are to be used to revitalize the tens of thousands of
acres of woods damaged by pollution in this country, ecologists say.
   The decision, however, was not expected to change official plans
for Czechoslovakia's most grandiose current project: the
construction of a giant dam and hydroelectric plant on the Danube
where it crosses the Hungarian border.
   Hungarian and Austrian environmentalists have said the project
will alter water levels and damage forests and farmland across a
wide area. But Czechoslovakia's planners are still going ahead with
a plant they say will provide enough power to reduce the burning of
sulfur-laden brown coal by 3.8 million tons a year.
   Brown coal and other materials used to fuel a rapid 1950s
industrialization inspired by the Soviets' Stalinist efforts have
inflicted great damage on the environment in Czechoslovakia, a
landlocked country whose natural assets are its forests and rivers.
   The damage grew unhindered throughout the 1970s, while the West
woke up to ecological issues. Now, a similar consciousness has
arisen in Czechoslovakia, causing popular alarm and forcing the
government to finance projects designed to restore environmental
standards to 1970 levels by the next millenium.
