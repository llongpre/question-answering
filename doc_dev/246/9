<LEADPARA>  When state and federal officials discussed California's water future with
Congress earlier this month, they delivered one of their clearest messages
with what they didn't say. Dams, reservoirs, canals -- formerly government's
first line of defense against long-term shortages -- were scarcely mentioned.;
   Instead, the federal commissioner of reclamation, whose agency once devoted
itself to plumbing the West, talked of conservation. Later, the state
resources secretary chuckled as he recounted a congressman's plea to tap the
vast runoff of northern rivers.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  STATE WATER PROJECTS FACING A DRY FUTURE
ENVIRONMENT, POLITICS, MONEY GET IN THE WAY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Underlying the testimony was an emerging truth of Western water politics, a
truth California's drought -- almost paradoxically -- is helping to reinforce.
The era of big water projects is gone, perhaps never to return.;    Political
obstacles;  Today, the financial, environmental and political obstacles to new
water development loom with the imposing force of a Hoover, Shasta or Grand
Coulee. Even relatively small projects -- like a Los Banos reservoir or an
expanded south delta pump station -- must contend with near-billion-dollar
price tags, regulatory requirements and widespread public disapproval.;   
"There are certainly some people who may look at this drought as the
opportunity to dust off some old discredited notions and say if only we had
this dam or that one, we'd be in fat city," said Edward Osann, director of
water resources for the National Wildlife Federation. "But there are some
basic reasons why those projects haven't happened and aren't going to
happen.";    It's not that there's a shortage of ideas. Four years ago, for
instance, the state and federal government quietly considered replacing Shasta
Dam in North Central California with a structure some 200 feet higher to store
more water. For years, Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn has proposed
siphoning off part of the Columbia River to slake Southern California's
thirst. Bigger dreamers talk of water from British Columbia, even Alaska. All
of these projects are technically feasible.;    Money issue; But these days
any water project, whether practical or fanciful, runs smack into the issue of
money.;    Were this 50 years ago, a parched California might expect a flush
federal government to offer dams and canals gratis. After all, the government
did just that when it took over the Central Valley Project in the mid-1930s.
But today, water project funds flow from Washington only under the strict
cost-sharing requirements of laws passed by a far more tightfisted Congress in
the deficit-ridden 1990s.;    "State officials look a lot more closely at
these things now that they have to put up their own money," Osann notes.;   
Meanwhile, the costs themselves have skyrocketed: A dam or canal today is at
least 10 times more expensive than it was 20 to 30 years ago. Inflation has
contributed to that rise. So too has the fact that the cheapest projects have
long since been built. In a state that already claims 1,200 dams on its 800
rivers, the only untapped flows are the ones that can't be had without a
60-mile tunnel through mountain rock, or some similarly expensive engineering
feat.;    And any such project would run into an even stiffer barrier: the
last 20 years of environmental law. No longer can a government agency
construct a dam without guaranteeing fresh water flows for fish, suitable
habitat for neighboring wildlife or survival for nearby endangered species.;  
 "You can look around the state now and see a lot of things you just couldn't
build the same way today," said Hal Candee of the Natural Resources Defense
Council. He cited the Friant Dam northeast of Fresno, which intermittently
leaves stretches of the San Joaquin River almost dry, as one example.;   
Rivers off limits;  Other projects couldn't be built under any circumstances.
The Klamath and Eel rivers, which contain nearly 16 percent of the state's
total freshwater runoff between them, were declared off limits to development
in the early 1980s.;    These obstacles exist and endure, observers agree,
because people seem to support them. The politics of water in California have
changed drastically in the last 20 years. Agribusiness interests that once
pushed dams and canals are fragmented, while the environmental groups that
fight those projects are stronger.;    "There's so many groups out there now
that have the power to block things, and no one group any more that has the
power to get something accomplished," said former Assembly Speaker Robert
Monagan.;    Nowhere was that clearer than in the 1982 campaign to build a
43-mile waterway through the Sacramento Delta, the so-called Peripheral Canal.
Even though it could hardly be called a major project -- the canal would have
moved just 700,000 acre-feet per year, less than 3 percent of the state's
annual consumption -- environmentalists and Northern California activists
combined to send it to a crushing defeat.;    Today, according to a January
Los Angeles Times poll, the prospects would be even worse. Just 10 percent of
those polled statewide said they favored a Peripheral Canal. And only 26
percent backed "building more dams" to meet the state's long-term water
needs.;    In the face of such sentiment, the traditional pro-development
forces are lying low. Reclamation Commissioner Dennis Underwood -- in sharp
contrast to his build-we-must predecessors -- even talks as if the new climate
is no problem.;    "This agency, since 1902, has been building an
infrastructure, a plumbing system for the West," he said. "Now that we've done
that, we can look at managing that system in a way that enhances the quality
of life. That's a natural evolution.";    But some others are frankly
mystified.;    "The days of the big water project can't be over," said former
Gov. Pat Brown.  </TEXT>
