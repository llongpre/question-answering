  [Text] Wuhan, June 28 (CNS) -- The National Environmental 
Protection Administration has recently organized renowned 
experts and leading officials to conduct surveys on 
environmental protection, water pollution and environmental 
administration in the Three Gorges area along the Yangtze River. 
  The survey group arrived in Yichang, Hebei Province on June 
24 where the Three Gorges Project is carried out. The group 
comprises scientific advisers from the Environment Committee of 
the State Council, academicians of the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences and those of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. The 
group heard briefing, paid inspection visits to the dam area of 
the Three Gorges, the new site of Zigui county town, the Maoping 
Brook and the Huangbo River. 
  The environmental protection work in the dam area 
includedinto the project is now undertaken by the Three Gorges 
Corporation. Environmental problems resulting from the great 
project mainly involve atmosphere pollution, water pollution, 
noise pollution, healthy state of persons affected by the 
project and public hygiene, abandoned wastes and solid wastes, 
all of which pose intensive and extensive impacts on environment 
of the construction area where the project is carried out. 
  Supervision of environmental quality in the construction 
area 
since the preparatory work for the project showed that water 
quality in the construction area along the mainstream section of 
the Yangtze River basically maintained a certain standard while 
quality of water resources from the water supply plant generally 
met the drinkable standard. Quality of atmosphere in the 
construction area was good while noise pollution there met the 
regulations of noise standard. Quality for other items were 
generally quite sound. As the project goes on, impacts on 
quality of environment in the construction area may appear to 
various extent. Necessary measures will be adopted in the 
course of the project including strengthening supervision of 
environment and prevention of pollution. Meanwhile, scientific 
research will be conducted and special groups required of the 
project be set up while legal guarantee will be offered in a bid 
to effectively reduce environmental pollution because of 
construction of the project.
