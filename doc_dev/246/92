<HEAD>Czechoslovakia to Seek Compensation from Hungary on Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>

   The government demanded Friday that
Hungary pay damages for the decision to suspend work on its part of
a joint Danube River dam project because of enviromental concerns.
   ``Pointing out the damages caused by the delay of construction
works, the Czechoslovak side announces it will start seeking
compensation,'' said a statement carried by CTK, the official news
agency.
   It said the Hungarian Embassy had been given a Foreign Ministry
note saying ``responsibility for the one-sided decision of the
Hungarian government is fully on the Hungarian side, as it was
adopted in contradiction to international law.''
   It did not say how much compensation would be sought or give
other details.
   Hungary announced a moratorium May 13 on its part of the
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project, which involves dams, canals and power
stations.
   Environmentalists in Hungary, one of the most liberal Soviet bloc
nations, and in the West have criticized the power project for years
as a threat to wildlife and wetlands.
   There has been no public criticism in Czechoslovakia, which
tolerates litte dissent.
   Before the suspension, a Hungarian government commission called
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros a ``symbol of Hungary's mismanaged past.''
   Czechoslovakia says the power station it has nearly completed at
Gabcikovo, 40 miles east of Bratislava, cannot operate as
efficiently as planned without the Nagymaros dam.
   ``The note confirms the Czechoslovak government's decision of May
15 to insist on honoring the agreement to construct the
abovementioned water project,'' CTK reported.
   The agreement to build the project was signed in 1977. Hungarian
construction lagged far behind the Czechoslovaks even before the
suspension.
