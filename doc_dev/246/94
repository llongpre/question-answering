DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSE GETS BILL ON BASIN, RIVER PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House Appropriations Committee sent to the full House this week a water and 
energy development bill for fiscal 1991 that includes $2.5 million for the 
Sepulveda Basin, $700,000 to study expanded use of the Los Angeles River and 
$272,000 for restoration of Hansen Dam. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) had sought $5 million for additional 
landscaping, open space, trails and parking in the Sepulveda Basin and $1 
million for a study of the Los Angeles River's recreational, transportation and 
water conservation potential. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson plans to continue pressing for the additional $2.5 million in the 
1992 budget, legislative assistant Melissa Kuckro said. Although the request 
for river study funds was also reduced, she said the Appropriations Committee 
generally provides a maximum of $500,000 for river studies but recognized that 
this project was unusually complicated and costly. 
</P>
<P>
Funds for Hansen Dam in the northeast San Fernando Valley, which were requested 
by Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), are set aside in a 4-year-old 
federal trust fund. The money is generated by the fees paid by a contractor who 
is digging silt from flood control channels. The contractor, who sells the silt 
to construction firms, pays between 15 and 25 cents into the fund for each ton 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
Berman also included language in the bill directing the U. S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, which owns the 1,540-acre dam area, to continue the dredging until 
it is completed. The corps is completing a master plan and environmental impact 
statement for revitalization of the long-neglected lake property in Pacoima and 
Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
The House is expected to approve the water and energy development bill as 
crafted by the Appropriations Committee. The Senate will adopt its own version, 
and representatives from each chamber will meet to reconcile the two measures.
