<HEAD>Mammoth Skeleton Found at 9,000 Feet in Central Utah</HEAD>

   The skeleton of a mammoth, a forerunner of
the elephant, has been unearthed at the surprisingly high elevation
of 9,000 feet during construction of an irrigation dam, scientists
said.
   The discovery at Huntington Canyon excited paleontologists and
archaeologists, who kneeled around the mammoth's skull Wednesday
and scraped away mud that has preserved the skeleton for 10,000 to
15,000 years.
   The discovery is expected to enhance understanding of the
mammoth and the environment of central Utah after the last Ice Age.
   ``It essentially has been in a refrigerator for 10,000 years,''
said David Gillette, state paleontologist. ``It all adds up to
wonderful preservation.''
   The presence of a mammoth at 9,000 feet above sea level was
intriguing, Gillette said.
   Mammoths generally foraged in lower-elevation grasslands. The
high-altitude canyon's environment has not changed appreciably
since the post-glacial period in which the mammoth apparently
lived, he said.
   The discovery was made Monday during construction of a dam that
will provide water for the Huntington-Cleveland area.
   A construction worker was operating a backhoe near the base of
the dam when the blade struck a large bone that turned out to be
the mammoth's skull.
   The blade cut into the cheekbone and crunched a shoulder blade
and tusk but did little overall damage to the remains, officials
said.
