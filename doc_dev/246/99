   The Reagan administration is taking aim at a
favorite budget-cutting target again this year, the dams and
irrigation projects that are cherished by members of Congress.
   The White House spending plan for fiscal 1989, sent to the
Capitol on Thursday, calls for construction starts on only a
half-dozen water projects by the Army Corps of Engineers. And for
the second consecutive year, no new projects were proposed for the
Bureau of Reclamation.
   A year ago, the president's 1988 budget request included funds
to begin 13 corps projects out of the scores authorized by Congress
under a 1986 law that required local beneficiaries to start paying
a share of the costs.
   For decades, Congress had cooperated closely with the corps and
the bureau, simultaneously expanding business for both agencies and
providing lawmakers with public works projects to extoll during
re-election campaigns.
   The congressional response to Reagan's request last year for
only 13 new construction starts was to appropriate money to begin
21 corps projects, ranging from flood control dams to replacement
of sand on eroding beaches.
   There was no immediate reaction among legislators Thursday to
the administration's proposal to start only six new flood control
projects in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
   The battle over Reagan's request probably will be fought in
coming months during closed meetings of the House and Senate
Appropriations committees.
   The slow-growth spending plan for water projects was termed ``a
good one'' by Robert Dawson, associate director of the White House
Office of Management and Budget for natural resources, energy and
science.
   ``It's a strong water development budget, clearly founded on the
concept that the user must help pay the cost,'' he said. ``It shows
that worthy projects can proceed even in times of budget
austerity.''
   The fiscal 1989 request for the corps totals nearly $3.3
billion. The bulk of it is earmarked to continue work on 157
projects under construction and to operate and maintain more than
650 completed projects.
   The total for the corps' flood control, navigation, recreation
and environmental repair activities is only about $52 million more
than Congress appropriated for the current fiscal year.
   Spending by the Bureau of Reclamation, an Interior Department
agency operating in Western states, would total $1.07 billion in
fiscal 1989, just $13 million more than Congress approved for
fiscal 1988.
   The bureau's budget request calls for higher spending to solve
environmental problems caused by irrigation systems, in line with a
major redirection of the agency's activities last year.
   The bureaucratic changes, which include transferring the
majority of the bureau's Washington staff to Denver, was tied to
the reclamation reality that nearly all the major rivers in the
water-short West have been dammed.
   The bureau's budget also includes a reshuffling of construction
priorities aimed at channeling increasingly limited funds to more
quickly complete major projects such as Central Arizona and Central
Utah.
   Last year, Congress rejected an administration attempt to make
an even more drastic reallocation of money among projects under
construction.
   The six newly proposed corps projects are Cache Creek Settling
Basin and the Santa Ana River Mainstem in California; Sheyenne
River, West Fargo and Riverside in North Dakota; the Ramapo and
Mahwah rivers in New Jersey and New York; Lock Haven in
Pennsylvania, and Nonconnah Creek in Tennessee and Mississippi.
