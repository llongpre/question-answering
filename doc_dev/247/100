Half-term reports on this season have swung round and become positive:
unlike investors, gardeners have had an excellent June.
True, we had wind and, recently, great heat. The soil here has started to
crack and the phloxes need watering.
After three summers on fast forward, nature has slowed and returned to her
English rhythm. From June 15 to July 10, it is roses all the way, relatively
unspoiled by rain. If in doubt, plant the pink Rose Felicia, the pale pink
climbing New Dawn and festoons of the rampant white Rambling Rector up trees
or towards your neighbours.
Gardening does not need to be complicated and I have tried to look back on
the first half of summer through the eyes of a starter or self-improver who
wants to be different without having a flop.
One answer would be to brave the queues and go to next week's Hampton Court
Show, open from July 6 to July 10 with first-class shopping on the spot from
our main nurseries.
Another is to cast around and react against the things which have caught my
eye. I would start the long route upwards with particular shrubs, especially
the pink-flowered Beauty Bush which is only held back by its name. Beauty
Bush is bad enough, but the true Kolkwitzia is not everyone's party-talk.
This year, it has been splendid and I doubt if even a half-hearted gardener
could kill it. It grows in any soil, including clay, but is best of all on
chalk. It is totally hardy and after three or four years reaches a height of
6ft or more.
The flowers are a pale pink in profusion just before shrub roses are at
their best. Twenty years ago, we were often short-changed by a shy-flowering
form. It seems to have retreated and Beauty Bushes now flower their skirts
off from the second year onwards. It pays to prune back all shoots which
have flowered as soon as the petals have fallen. Otherwise, the bush tends
to flower at the top and you have to make a virtue of its lop-sidedness,
planting something like a blue michaelmas daisy for late summer.
In early June, hardened gardeners fear the infamous June gap when the best
of the tulips are over and the best of the irises and roses have not begun.
Everything seems to hold its breath, what can we do about it?
This year, nature covered the gap by holding up May-flowering shrubs in
those awful gales and cold evenings. Late spring ran smoothly into summer,
but even so, I was glad of my easy answer, the single-flowered white Rocket,
which grows like a weed from packets of seed sown now for next year.
It is listed as Hesperis and it is well worth the minimal trouble as it will
even flower in those dry places beneath a hedge. It picks up from the point
where connoisseurs might have seen their perennial forms of white Cardamine
go over, leading into the easy white profusion of June and July.
If you hate sowing seeds, think bigger and try one of my fool-proof shrubs
which can be multiplied with the greatest of ease from cuttings. The
white-flowered Rubus Tridel Benenden is quite a tall and broad customer, but
it is outstandingly good in late May and I always relish the freshness
throughout the year of its greencurrant leaves and darker stems which exude
health.
Make the most of it because breeders have now crossed it with purple-pink
odoratus and the result is about to hit our garden centres. I cannot imagine
that it will surpass Benenden, the ideal shrub for improving a rough bit of
garden, the edge of a drive or one of those broad corners by a dark shed
where nobody goes very often. You can prune it very hard after flowering,
but it is spoilt if it has less of a width than 7ft or 8ft.
If the Rubus seems too massive, hunt around at a height of 2ft for a grossly
neglected cousin of the common old Flower of Jove. Many of us grow more of
the magenta-flowered Lychnis than we ever intend because it seeds everywhere
and springs up so rapidly.
Too few of us try the old, soft Lychnis coronaria oculata, whose white
flowers have the prettiest pink eye which fades with age. Anyone can grow
this easy perennial which will split rapidly into dozens and will thrive in
any sunny garden, however small, or in gaps between paving. Like the rest of
the family, it likes sunshine, but the lower leaves will turn brown if it is
constantly dry. It flowers for a month and a half. It was popular in the
period which historians call early modern, but it is oddly unpopular
nowadays, in what ancient historians think of as a dark age.
It is amazing how quickly the gap closes between ambitious self-improvers
and old gardens which rest on their laurels and hollies. My crowning memory
of early June is a mischievous visit to Hidcote, between the bedding seasons
at this famous Warwickshire garden in the National Trust.
I was glad that the ticket was free and did not cost the usual Pounds 4.80.
In early June, what was there, apart from the old hedges and some gorgeous
blue meconopsis?
Does anyone else grow a dusky pink Weigela called Conquete? The family is
full of good shrubs, but many of them have flowers which are too sombre to
show up well among the leaves. This one is much brighter: is it alive and
available in what sounds like its native France or can we not reintroduce it
from Hidcote's stocks?
Meanwhile, you can compensate by hunting for some lesser-known old variety
in the lists of Peter Beales or David Austin. This year, even on my rotten
soil for roses, the surprise has been the rose-purple Ardoisse de Lyon. I
love to think that these fine varieties have been totally forgotten in the
France which first bred them. In England, we will soon be calling them
heritage and making it impossible for any of them to go out of fashion.
