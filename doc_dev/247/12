   The capital is awash in laughing daffodils, a
grand chorus of tulips is about to proclaim the arrival of spring,
and Milton Boston already is worrying about planting thousands of
geraniums, petunias and marigolds for the summer.
   Boston is chief floral gardener for the National Park Service in
downtown Washington, the generalissimo with rake and hoe who
oversees the year-long planting of 170 flower beds from the Capitol
to the Kennedy Center.
   His job might seem staggering to backyard putterers. For a month
in late fall, the efficient, unflappable Boston and his crew of
eight gardeners were busy planting 186,150 tulips, 108,300
daffodils and 22,000 pansies, all of which bloom in the spring.
   Those flowers are removed by early May. The soil is tilled,
fumigated with weed and pest killers, conditioned with perlite and
peat moss and planted with bright, hardy annuals for Washington's
hot summer months. They are weeded and fertilized until they die in
the first frost. They are replaced by about 3,000 crysanthemums.
Then the beds are cleared and the cycle starts again in November.
   Boston, a 26-year Park Service veteran, is especially proud of
the ``tulip library,'' a broad, looping cluster of 95 small beds of
the proud clarions of spring that lies near the Tidal Basin south
of the Washington Monument.
   This elaborate garden contains 15,000 tulips, most of them
imported from Holland. Each of the 95 beds containing a different
variety, with names as dazzling as their colors _ Queen of Night,
Merry Widow, Apeldoorn, Oriental Splendor, Smiling Queen, Flaming
Parrot, Estella Rijnveld.
   It's so impressive that it won an admiring tribute from the
Dutch Embassy.
   Boston says he gets ``great satisfaction'' from his handiwork,
which delights more than 23 million tourists who visit Washington's
national parks and monuments each year.
   ``This is always what I wanted to do,'' said Boston, 45, who
grew up on his father's farm in eastern North Carolina and migrated
to Washington after high school. ``All my life I've been used to
growing things.''
   His annual $330,000 budget includes the cost of plants and bulbs
purchased wholesale from growers, many from neighboring Maryland
and Virginia, on the basis of competitive bids and shipped into the
capital by truck or van.
   During plantings, Boston's crew begins work at 6 a.m. and can
leave a flower bed blazing with color before the morning rush hour
is over. He says he couldn't meet his grueling timetable for the
passing seasons without his eight Park Service helpers.
   ``They really work hard and do a good job,'' he said. ``They're
all gardeners, and they know what they're doing. They can plant
20,000 bulbs in one day.''
   In a city beset by violent crimes, Boston is pleased that his
flowers are almost never stolen, except by an occasional panhandler
intent on selling them for spare change.
   ``I guess people enjoy them so, they don't take them,'' he said.
``About the only problem is when people stand in the beds to pose
for pictures and mash the flowers down.''
   Boston says he once had ``the best-looking yard in the
neighborhood'' in suburban Capitol Heights, Md., where he lives
with his wife and two children, ``but in this job, I don't have the
time any more to take care of it.''
   His loss is Washington's gain.
