Robin Lane Fox has some advice for bulb enthusiasts who want to spend wisely
and see tangible evidence of success
THIS weekend, it is time to plan the annual bulb massacre. During the past
30 years, I have sent hundreds of them to their death: tulips, anemones,
iris, muscari - and my latest victims, 200 ipheions, which were planted
lovingly on a warm October day last year and responded by sending up two
green shoots between the lot of them in March.
Gardeners like to forget the mass murders buried in their gardens because
hope springs eternal; if only the Triumph tulips would do the same. But I
want to share 35 years' experience of such things with those of you who
cannot confess to it or are starting out with high hopes, coloured
photographs and bulb catalogues which talk of naturalising.
This year is the tulips' 400th anniversary. I send my happy returns to the
family although, as individuals, I have seldom had one which has reached its
fifth birthday. But since tulips should not be planted until late October, I
will reserve a separate week for their birthday obituary.
How, though, do wise gardeners spend their money with better prospects of
success? My successes have always been narcissi. This year, the trade has
not found narcissi easy because many of the bulbs did not grow on well in a
year of peculiar weather.
I follow firm narcissus rules. I put the tall, hybrid varieties in grass,
chosing them to cover their widely differing seasons. I swear by the early
Icy Follies, followed by Barrett Browning and the late Pheasant's Eye. These
narcissi, with a white base to the flowers, persist better in grass than the
tempting all-white daffodils.
Order them in 25 kg bulk for country planting and do not economise by
starting with a few and seeing what happens. They grow almost everywhere,
but you should segregate the varieties in separate clumps because they
flower at different seasons. They look miserable if they open when their
neighbours have gone brown.
Small narcissi also are excellent and persist well, but the catalogues
mislead you by recommending them for naturalising. Why not? you might think;
after all, some of them grow wild on the Welsh borders or in the Yorkshire
dales?
The best method is to plant a few, see if they like you and allow them to
colonise. Vigour varies widely but you should start with some small,
experimental clumps of February Gold, Tete a Tete and the native Lent Lily.
They all flower early, allowing you to mow the grass much sooner in the
year.
I have known gardeners whose grass has been colonised by these strong
varieties after three years. If they start to spread, the best method is to
lift and divide them after flowering when they are still in leaf: they move
much better late in April, the season when no supplier can send them out.
We all buy dry bulbs which need to be planted quickly. Next year, there is
no particular merit in dead-heading them, but it really does help, after
flowering, to spray the leaves with liquid fertiliser once a fortnight.
Most of the small narcissi which I have not murdered are used in small
groups, in flower beds. They bloom early and the small leaves are
unobtrusive when they die. The prettiest, but not the cheapest, is Dove
Wings, although groups of a dozen bulbs go a long way.
Generally, you can make as much of an impact with small clumps, spaced well
down the length of the bed, rather than with an expensive total coverage.
February Gold is the strongest form of all (although it is not gold and does
not flower in February). Jack Snipe is almost as good and Peeping Tom also
has stamina.
Never try to naturalise jonquils in grass: they are better in dry ground
below a wall. The pure white forms are extremely pretty and we have had
sensational success with the pure white Thalia, planted to face due north at
the foot of Oxford's ancient city wall. It is supposed to prefer a warm,
sheltered place but it has spread by the hundred in this unlikely site.
Narcissi grow well on heavy soil but, in light gardens, I would choose
anemone Blanda as a carpet instead; its starry flowers open at ground level
in pink, white and blue (or simply blue, if you prefer). They arrive like
dry, black nuts from the suppliers and I have learned the trick to them.
Soak them for 24 hours in a bowl of cold water before planting, and do not
worry if you are not entirely sure which side of the corm should be
uppermost. Somehow, they right themselves.
They are excellent for the front of beds which will be semi-shaded when
leaves return to the trees but where they can open in the spring sunshine
meanwhile. They will often spread quite happily and the leaves are not a
bother.
Crocuses are harder to kill if you are not too experimental. Despite a few
triumphs, I have vowed to follow narcissus rules with this family, too.
Almost the only ones to go into grass will be the strong Dutch hybrids,
which persist if you do not mow them before the leaves have died away.
The whites and yellows are chosen easily, but the blues are more tricky
because the best-known are purple or striped annoyingly. My favourite is Sky
Blue - but squirrels and mice like all these crocuses, too, and I know of no
protection except the shotgun.
Small-flower crocuses usually dwindle in grass, except for the vigorous
Tommasinianus; this variety is the other great bet for a future carpet in
the lawn. Other small varieties include flowers which I might well choose to
take to my desert island: Blue Pearl and Cream Beauty are of unsurpassed
beauty and show great stamina along the front of flower beds out of season
or at the foot of hedges of roses. On open ground, they persist and
multiply, but grass is too much for them. The best multiplier of all in a
flower bed is the pale blue vernus Vanguard - not the cheapest, but much
your best hope of total cover.
Leave aconites alone in quantity. They are better bought in green leaf in
the spring and planted in small samples to see if they are happy. The same
is true of snowdrops, which few people establish from dry bulbs planted now.
Better bets for the bigger cheque-book are the milk-blue and white
chionodoxa Luciliae, which spreads rapidly, and the wonderfully early scilla
Spring Beauty, which makes clumps but is essential because it flowers so
early. Bluebells are a romantic menace and you probably want no more in your
life.
I would like to have ended on a positive note. For 20 years, my best early
spring bulb was the wonderful iris Histrioides Major, which flowers in a
brilliant blue at a height of 6in and resists any weather. I have never been
able to kill it, whereas its other small relations split into small bulbs
and dwindle after two years.
Now, the nurserymen have killed it instead. Its two main suppliers in
Holland allowed a virus simultaneously into their stock, and this admirable
bulb is now off the market.
