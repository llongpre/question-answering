   ``Wherever there's a little spot for
a flower, there's a flower,'' Owe Bodentien was saying, as he stood
on the muddy soil of a deserted Tivoli park, where he is the head
gardener.
   Like gardeners everywhere in the Northern Hemisphere this time
of year, his work is just beginning _ and he has 20 acres to worry
about.
   ``The policy is to have something new and something old, but not
too much of each,'' Bodentien said of his 10 years in what he calls
``the best gardening job in Denmark.''
   ``First we plant about 25,000 to 30,000 violets and
forget-me-nots in blue, pink and white, with tulips in between.
People should do that in their gardens, too, because when the
(tulip) bulbs are finished, you have another flower underneath.''
   Although the park is open barely a third of the year, as many as
5 million people stream through each summer season for the
amusement rides, the food, the music, the theater _ or just to look
at the flowers.
   Entrepreneur Georg Carstensen got royal permission to found the
park in 1843. The story goes that he told King Christian VIII,
``When people are amusing themselves, they do not think about
politics.''
   For many who visit Tivoli, the gardens are the main attraction.
   Bodentien makes a regular buying trip to the Keukenhof gardens,
showcase of the Dutch flower bulb industry outside The Hague in the
Netherlands. Tivoli buys practically all its flowers from such
specialized suppliers, spending the kroner equivalent of $313,000 a
year on plants alone.
   By modern amusement park standards, Tivoli is tiny, so every
inch counts. The garden plan has 10 pages of ledger-sized entries
detailing what is planted where.
   This year's plan calls for 68,000 tulips of 100 different
varieties, from ``Dreaming Maid'' to ``Black Hero.''
   The gardening staff of nine, which expands to as many as 17 in
the summer, will also be tending 42,300 pearl hyacinths and
anemones, 3,800 narcissi and Easter lilies, 50,000 cut
chrysanthemums and 100,000 potted plants of other kinds.
   January and February is the time for pruning trees, some of
which are older than the park itself.
   ``I must admit that trees are my big passion,'' Bodentien said.
``Flowers are easily bought, but trees take centuries.''
   Tivoli's chestnuts, elms and lime trees are seldom felled, and
when they must be, they are replaced. They grow from walls, poke
through restaurant ceilings and stick up around the winding tracks
of the rides.
   Tivoli's lone California redwood, a gift from the Danish
Brotherhood in California in 1968, is growing at the northern limit
for the species, Bodentien said.
   An American tourist was astonished to see a banana tree bearing
fruit in this northern latitude, he said.
   ``I heard him tell his wife it was plastic, so I picked one and
gave it to him to eat.''
   Bodentien and his crews are in a rush now to have everything in
order and in bloom by opening day, April 27.
   In 1983, Bodentien won a Guinness Record Certificate for the
biggest chrysanthemum display, 370,000 blooms. He's always coming
up with new ideas for the park's designs.
   ``I get my inspiration all over,'' he said. ``At home in a chair
or out walking on the street or maybe talking to people about
something totally different, and suddenly it comes. ...
   ``The park has to look as fine on the last day (of the season)
as on the first day. We are changing all the time.''
