IN CALIFORNIA, there are actually two springs. First to bloom are the bulbs and 
annuals; then about two months later come the perennials. With luck, the 
perennials flower through summer and into early autumn. So this month -- the 
optimal planting time in Southern California -- you're really planning and 
planting for two springs, plus summer. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, in Louis and Stephanie Snyder's West Los Angeles garden, the bulbs 
and annuals set out the previous fall -- a crisp mix of white and yellow -- 
peaked in March. By mid-May, the garden looked completely different. The bulbs 
and some of the annuals were gone, but the perennials, also planted at the same 
time, had taken their places. The multitude of flowers -- including roses, 
delphiniums, lavender, various salvias and coreopsis -- bloomed off and on and 
were still putting on a respectable show in late September. Many perennials 
grow in the garden for several years before they must be divided or replanted, 
unlike most of the bulbs and annual flowers, which are planted anew every year. 
</P>

Fall planting is almost foolproof in California. Shorter, cooler days and the 
occasional rain are kind to seeds and seedlings alike. Nature makes roots wait 
until fall to grow, and since most soil diseases are inactive in the autumn, 
anything planted between September and December is almost guaranteed to be off 
to a sure, if somewhat slow, start -- slow compared to the jump-start plants 
get from spring planting. 
</P>
<P>
Fall planting also saves considerable water because plants need less during the 
cooler months, and any rain helps out. This year, many home gardeners are 
waiting to plant until the end of October or even November, when rain is more 
likely, temperatures still cooler and the sun even lower.

Those who like flowers would have a hard time coming up with a better plan than 
the one worked out for the Snyder garden. The long, somewhat narrow area allows 
plenty of room for two deep beds, and the path down the middle makes everything 
accessible. The garden is on the south side of the property so it gets as much 
sun as possible. And the linear plan of this garden is perfectly suited for 
drip irrigation. An in-line system (with the drip emitters hidden inside the 
tubing) or a porous tubing system (in which water leaks through the walls of 
the tubing) could be snaked among the beds. Although the Snyders moved from a 
much larger garden (shown in the Oct. 4, 1987, issue of Los Angeles Times 
Magazine), they have no regrets. In the new, smaller garden, good planning 
created more room for fun things. There is little "filler" -- no lawn or 
shrubbery to speak of -- just lots of flowers, a few dwarf fruit trees, and 
vegetables, which are in another little plot laid out like an early American 
knot garden.

Torrance architect Edward Carson Beall designed the Snyders' house, which looks 
like it was plucked from a New Hampshire field. Instead of taking up the entire 
lot with house, an all-too-common occurrence in California nowadays, Beall 
reserved a long space for a garden and shoehorned the farm-style house around 
it. Even the color of the house (Dunn Edward's Barn Red) was chosen to 
complement the flowers.

Sandy Kennedy of Sassafras Nursery and Landscape in Topanga laid out the 
garden, and her sister, Dian Kennedy, cares for it through the seasons. It was 
Sandy who cleverly designed the two rows of flowers to go with the two springs.

In March, the path is lined with white tulips and big 'Mt. Hood' and 
'California Giant' daffodils, with an under story of white sweet alyssum and 
pansies. Much of the gray foliage comes from the low-growing perennials -- 
lamb's ears, lavender and snow-in-summer -- that come to life in time to help 
hide the fading bulbs. The bright yellow clumps nicely placed along the path 
are coreopsis. In spring, Dian plants a few summer-flowering annuals, including 
marigolds, where spring annuals have faded. 
</P>
<P>
The back row is planted with taller perennials and a few late bulbs and 
annuals, like larkspur and watsonia, which peak in May and June and then 
continue off and on into early fall. The tall spires in the back are blue 
delphiniums or pink larkspur and foxgloves, which are replanted every fall.

No space is wasted, not even the space between paving stones (which are simply 
set on a tamped sand base). In these narrow cracks grow lobelia, dwarf yarrow, 
woolly thyme, ajuga, corsican mint, crocus, potentilla and the very dainty 
erodium.
