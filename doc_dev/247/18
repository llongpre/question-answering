<LEADPARA>  TAKE time this fall to pot some tulips, daffodils, fragrant hyacinths and
crocuses and you will enjoy their colorful blooms indoors far ahead of
nature's schedule. It's a sure way to get a jump on next spring and brighten
one's outlook during the cold gray winter days ahead.;   It is easily done
through a simple technique called forcing, actually tricking the bulbs to
respond as if spring has arrived. Professional growers do it all the time to
make these cheery flowers available in midwinter, but it's much more exciting
to grow them yourself.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Go for variety;   All that is necessary is to provide the natural
conditions under which the bulbs normally grow, then encourage them to bloom
earlier than they would in the garden. Each bulb has its flowers, stems and
leaves already formed within, eager to emerge when conditions are right.;  
Now, with outdoor bulb planting well under way, is a good time to begin a
forcing project. You can use bulbs left over after you've finished outdoor
planting, or purchase them especially for this purpose at garden centers.
Select firm, plump, unblemished bulbs for best results, as well as different
varieties for a wider range of colors.;   You also will need clay or plastic
pots, ceramic bowls or other containers that are at least five inches deep
with bottom drainage holes; soil; and a cold indoor or outdoor place to store
the planted bulbs while they are developing roots.;   Soil brought in from the
garden is satisfactory if it is loose and crumbly. Otherwise use a commercial
potting mix. No fertilizer is necessary as each bulb contains all the
nutrients needed to flower.;   Here's the procedure;   Cover the drainage
holes in containers with stones or pieces of a broken clay pot to keep the
soil from flowing out. Then fill the containers with soil and follow these
steps:;   (check) Firm the bulbs in the soil with a twisting action, placing
them close together but not touching each other or the sides of the
containers. A six-inch pot should hold five or six tulips, or three hyacinths,
or eight to 10 smaller bulbs such as crocuses.;   (check) Add soil as needed
to cover the smaller bulbs, but allow the tips of the larger bulbs to be
visible above the soil. Then water thoroughly, preferably by plunging the
containers in a sink or large pan of water about halfway up and allowing the
water to soak through the drainage holes until the surface becomes moist.;  
(check) Store the bulbs in a cool, dark place that duplicates the winter cold
period they require to develop vigorous root growth. Suitable storage areas
could be a cool spot in the basement or garage where the temperature remains
between 35 and 48 degrees. Or place containers under a heavy mulch in an
outdoor trench or cold frame.;   (check) Begin checking some of the pots in 10
to 12 weeks to see whether they have developed substantial roots and some top
growth. If so, the bulbs are ready for the final forcing step. If not, return
them for additional cold treatment.;   Warmup time;   Once you are satisfied
that adequate rooting has occurred, transfer the pots from cold storage to a
room with diffused light and 60- to 65-degree temperatures. Within a week or
so, stems will begin to elongate and buds will enlarge. This is the cue to
give them more warmth and full light and await their flowering splendor.;   By
forcing a few of the potted bulbs at a time, leaving the others in cold
storage, you can add extra weeks to the indoor flower show. To prolong
freshness of plants in flower, keep them away from direct sunlight and away
from heat ducts and radiators. Moving them to cooler quarters at night also
helps.;   Almost all hardy bulbs can be coaxed into bloom ahead of their usual
flowering season, according to the Netherlands FlowerBulb Information Center,
so don't hesitate to try any of your favorite kinds or experiment with
unfamiliar crops.;   While bulbs forced for early indoor bloom seldom can be
forced again, they may eventually flower in the garden if their foliage has
been allowed to ripen. In any event, it's worth a try. In spring when the
ground can be worked, remove the bulbs from their pots and plant them in the
garden, following the recommended greater depth for outdoor planting.  </TEXT>
