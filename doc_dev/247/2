According to an opinion poll, most Americans do not know where Holland is
but they can easily tell you where tulips come from.
Perhaps fewer Americans know the extraordinary history of this bloom, once
prized above the riches of princes, now produced for the millions, yet still
touched by the magic of its exotic past. Tulip bulbs saved many of the Dutch
from death in the darkest years of Nazi occupation, and they have helped to
keep them prosperous ever since.
It is understandable that the Netherlands wants to celebrate; it has chosen
1994 as the 400th anniversary of the flowering of tulips flowered in the
Dutch province of Holland (no matter that the date is doubtful) and is
marking the event with pageants, tours, an exhibition at the Frans Hals
Museum in Haarlem and one in the autumn at Amsterdam's Nieuwe Kirche,
adorned with unseasonal 'ice tulips'.
The identification of tulips with Holland goes back to the epidemic of
'tulip mania' between 1635 and the crash in 1637 (which showed remarkable
parallels with more modern commodity and price spirals). However, some say
that the warm sentiment inspired by tulips arose relatively recently. This
year is the 50th anniversary of the Hunger Winter of 1944, when the Dutch
starved under German occupation and people were reduced to grubbing up bulbs
from the tulip fields. Some restaurants are putting tulip dishes on the
menu, a gimmick which may say as much about residual anti-German feeling as
about sentimentality towards tulips.
The first recorded tulip flowerings in Holland were at Leiden, in neatly
hedged beds in the hortus botanicus in autumn 1593. They belonged to the
botanist Charles de l'Ecluse. Clusius, as he was known, was by then an old
man, head-hunted for the new university. For more than 30 years he had been
at the imperial court in Vienna, growing and studying tulips brought from
Turkey.
By 1594 tulips were being grown in grand gardens in the German-speaking
lands, in France, and England. Indeed, it is recorded that many years before
he moved to the Netherlands, Clusius sent a present of bulbs to a Dutch
gentleman. No doubt they flowered . . .
Pedantry aside, Leiden can claim to be the cradle of the Dutch bulb
industry. Clusius and his head-gardener, quaintly called Clutius, settled
down to propagating the priceless tulip collection. They sold bulbs at
exorbitant prices to courtiers and country gentlemen.
The breakthrough came only after a break-in, when thieves smashed their way
into the hortus botanicus, stole the tulip collection, and dispersed it to
the nursery trade.
Tulip growing and breeding became a passionate pursuit of rich amateur
gardeners throughout northern Europe. Because they hybridise easily and
produce 'sports' or mutations, tulips were soon being produced in an
extraordinary range of sizes, colours, shapes, and in the case of the most
expensive, with the most fabulously patterned blooms. Vividly striped,
blotched and flamed tulips (much later called 'Rembrandt' type) were the
most expensive.
By the 1620s, tulip bulbs had become plentiful enough for at least the lowly
varieties to be widely available. But the extraordinary thing about tulips
was their propensity to change dazzlingly from one season to the next.
Unique among flowers, they will spontaneously 'break' or 'rectify',
reappearing the next spring with gorgeously patterned petals. These tulips
took their place among the costliest luxuries of the day.
Grow just a few bulbs, and you could find you had the lucky break, which
made tulips ripe for an investment gamble. Without the breaking, there would
not have been the kind of interest which led to a speculative mania
notorious in the annals of capitalism.
A rampant futures markets developed, tulips changing hands many times but
only on paper. Men made and lost fortunes.
In 1623, a Semper Augustus bulb, red and white, fetched Fl 1,000 - around
Pounds 350. Average income was around Fl 150. Next year, the price was Fl
1,200; by 1635, the price was Fl 5,500. Then the massive inflation began and
in 1637, at the height of the market, a Semper August fetched the equivalent
of Pounds 3,300. One bulb cost as much as a house on Amsterdam's smartest
canal, with a coach-house and garden.
Why did tulips break? There were many theories, ranging from the influence
of the planets to insect infestation. The answer was found only in 1919. It
was a virus, TBV, commonly spread by aphids, which by breaking up the
anthocyanin pigment causes the exceptionally intense hues and patterns.
The discovery was the death-knell of the Rembrandt. The flower of the Dutch
Golden Age was merely sickly, diseased and horribly contagious. As Stanley
Killingback, a modern tulip expert remarks: 'The beauty of such flowers is
the beauty of death.' Clusius, too, noted that a broken tulip fizzles out
within a season or two. He thought the breaking was a floral equivalent of a
swansong, to reward its owner.
Tulip mania remains an astonishing tribute to the appeal of flowers that
were valued as if they were gold plate or pearls. Today, tulip prices are at
an historic low, and sales are declining. Tulip 400 celebrates a passion
which has long been waning among gardeners. In the last 20 years, the number
of growers has dropped from 15,000 to 3,510.
Yet even after four centuries of breeding, the hybridisers see a chink
ahead. Extraordinary things may yet emerge from the bulb-sheds. Tissue
culture has reduced the time it takes to bring a new variety to market -
from 20 years to around seven. In the 1930s, they used radiation to make
weird new varieties. Frans Roozen, head of the technical section of the
International Bulb Centre talk of using colchicine, a poison favoured by
Dutch witches, to cross tulips with narcissi and make 'a purple daffodil'.
Genetic engineering is a better bet for the rainbow tulips of the future.
According to hybridiser Piet Koopman of Pico Bello, the true blue tulip is a
possibility if scientists can identify the purple chromasome in the iris
family and inject it into tulip bulbs. Four centuries have taken the tulip a
long way from the small, highly priced flower which Clusius named, 'A lovely
tulip of a most elegant colour'.
