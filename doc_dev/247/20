December is the month to plant blooming bulbs such as tulips, hyacinths, crocus 
and daffodils. Tulips and hyacinths need to be chilled six weeks before 
planting. 
</P>
<P>
Most bulbs prefer a sandy, well-drained soil, so it is a good idea to 
incorporate organic matter such as redwood, peat moss and sand before planting. 
Keep bulbs on the dry side until the new shoots emerge then water regularly and 
fertilize with 10-10-15 every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Prune bare root fruit and nut trees, asparagus, berries and grapes. Again 
incorporate organic matter before planting and water with B-1 to help initiate 
root growth. Apply a dormant oil spray to smother dormant insects, and mulch 
all newly-planted trees and shrubs to help protect from moisture loss and cold 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Plant amaryllis bulbs in early December for Christmas color. Plant one bulb per 
six-inch pot in a well-drained potting soil. Place in a sunny window and water 
sparingly until flower stalk appears.

. . . . AND GENERAL DECEMBER CARE TIPS 
</P>
<P>
Spruce up your container garden by filling it with colorful annuals or 
perennials that bloom in the winter. Remember to water if the containers sit 
under a covered area where the rains don't reach. 
</P>
<P>
Tidy up around the lawn and garden -- prune infected tree branches, keep fallen 
leaves raked and secure vining plants to trellises. 
</P>
<P>
Look for your living Christmas tree now while there's a good selection. 
</P>
<P>
Prepare plants for a cold winter by "hardening" them -- holding back on 
nitrogen feeding in late fall and early winter discourages new growth. 
</P>
<P>
Consider raising your flower beds for better drainage; this also allows 
accumulated salts to be leached out the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Snails and slugs love the damp winter conditions so use natural or chemical 
controls to keep them from feeding on new bulb flower shoots and annuals. 
</P>
<P>
When spraying to control pests and diseases in their dormant state, be sure to 
cover the plant from top to bottom and even on the undersides of the leaves and 
on the ground around the plant. 
</P>
<P>
To keep weeds in check during the winter rains and give a neat appearance to 
your flower beds, weed now and apply a layer of mulch. 
</P>
<P>
Plant roses, strawberries and fruit trees this month. 
</P>
<P>
Have you sprayed your peaches and nectarines to prevent peach leaf curl? If 
not, do so immediately and then follow up with another spraying before the buds 
swell.
