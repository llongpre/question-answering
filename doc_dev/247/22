are more than a two-month wonder

When gardeners start out, they think naturally of summer. They pile on the
roses, the mid-summer borders, and their defences against a dull July. The
summer initiative grows and, in time, it suggests new openings: has anyone
ever pre-planned a serious garden by mapping it in advance? I doubt it,
because it develops a framework after five years built on the corpses of 100
failures.
After five years on my new site, I am now spring-mad and ceasing to worry
about plantings that will continue beyond August. I have re-learned an old
lesson: good gardens are not a two-month wonder. They extend from February
to early November, with an artful emphasis on their early months.
Why did I start so short-sightedly? I began with flower beds and evergreen
hedges but I forgot to thicken the outlying boundaries with enough forms of
early prunus, winter-flowering cherry, early okame, upright umeneko and
others. I planted roses which now detest my soil, but the winter-flowering
shrubs should have gone in first.
This time, to limit my job, I told myself some of the wrong things when I
started out: that I would leave the flowering cherries to suburbia; that I
would cut out spring bedding; that magnolias would never flourish on my lime
soil; and that spring-flowering border plants were better to write about
than to grow. I planted evergreen hedges, so that the yew could develop
brown patches: I even left the bulbs until last.
Now I see my mistake. In the early years, you seldom visit other gardens:
you are too busy taming your own. Only now can I see what others have made
from the same season.
I envy older gardens their grand old trees at this time of year. I defer to
the magnolias in the Hillier Arboretum, the camellias in Richmond's Isabella
plantation, or the white-flowered Amelanchiers which Rudyard Kipling must
have planted at Batemans, the National Trust property in East Sussex near
Tunbridge Wells, where they ought still to be at their best.
I have given them five years' start by not planting spring-flowering trees
as soon as I began. I now think that they are as essential to a sense of
place as evergreens which we urge you to put in first. But I also notice how
great places cope with the bleakness of Britain's early spring by casual
under-planting and how they have two ways of coping with bulbs.
The under-planting has not exactly passed me by. We now grow wallflowers
among the summer borders and discard them after flowering. A few blocks go a
long way and, in smaller beds, I now resort to the best of all
forget-me-nots - the small, dark form called Indigo.

It pays to go further. In a great garden such as Sissinghurst, in Kent, you
can see the impact of early-flowering extras, grown in groups or occasional
isolation among the surrounding emptiness of spring. Sissinghurst is looking
enviable in spite of cold, wet weather.
In the White Garden, there is easy, white-flowered arabis for colour now.
and there are groups of the easy, pale pink primula Guinivere, taking up no
space but making most of the impact in the main July beds. It takes only a
bush or two of the bright pink prunus Tenella to enliven an entire section,
while someone has had the bright idea of growing a few sprigs of white
prunus Cistena in the garden's front courtyard.
I am still waiting for forget-me-nots, but these established gardens have
used enough early perennials casually among their framework to double their
season of interest. Beginners should remember to do the same.
When I started, I decided also to leave bulbs until last. After all, why
plant tulips and daffodils when you may decide to dig up their ground and
change it?
For the first time, I was ready to move forward last autumn and I added
blocks of narcissi in time for this wonderful year for the family. This
spring, almost every form has been wonderful, but my top five for
naturalisation are those with paler flowers - Geranium, Ice Follies, Barrett
Browning, Winston Churchill - and the later so-called Pheasant's Eye.
They look fine but, by delaying, I realise that I have actually lost
important ground.
What I always knew, and now remember, is that the best shows of bulbs are
colonies, not garrisons. In our great gardens, the best displays were not
planted by the thousand. They were introduced gently, given time to know
each other, and then allowed to run wild when they decided they were
friends.
These colonies take time to spread and develop, but it is vastly better to
buy a few small groups of bulbs which know how to seed themselves, and start
them off manageably as soon as you begin a new garden or gardening phase.
The big blocks can be introduced as occupying forces at any later time: the
narcissi in long grass or the modern tulips by the hundred to brighten the
flower beds.
New gardeners usually receive the same fashionable advice: begin with the
bones first. Nowadays, the bones mean firm hedges of evergreen, some arches,
perhaps a wall or even a fancy conservatory or temple if you want to spend
your way out of bleakness. We tell you to begin with yew, box, climbing
roses and the main specimen trees.
None of this advice is wrong, but I would add what experience has taught me
twice: when you start, jump on the future bandwagon of spring and never
think of your garden as a place essentially for the months from May until
October.
