<LEADPARA>  WHILE September pops up three-quarters of the way through the calendar, for
many people it is the season of new beginnings -- a new school year, a new
football season, the Jewish New Year, a new symphony season and the start of
the first hockey season for the San Jose Sharks.;   For gardeners, it is the
start-over season. Longtime soil toilers know this is the ideal month for
cleaning out the old and putting in the new.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For those who've thought but never acted, it's the ideal time to become a
gardener.;   Jobs both big and small are on the must-do list. Here's how to
get started:; Vegetables; With the weather already turning cool, you can plant
all the winter vegetables. Look for seeds and six-packs of peas, chard,
broccoli, lettuce, cauliflower, carrots, radishes, beets, cabbage and onion
sets. Root crops will grow in light shade; others need full sun. Give soil a
fresh start by digging in a three- to four-inch layer of soil amendment
(compost, leaf mold, redwood soil conditioner). Mix an all-purpose fertilizer
(10-10-10) into the top two or three inches of soil, then sow seeds and put in
transplants. If planting seeds, cover them lightly -- 1/4-inch deep is fine.
Keep seed bed moist until seeds germinate; then start cutting back on
watering. Drip emitters are a good bet.; Flowers; Fall flowers are just
beginning to show up in six-packs, but seed racks are overflowing with the new
varieties. Plant annuals and perennials including pansies, calendulas, sweet
peas, cyclamens, primroses, begonias, coral bells, coreopsis, salvias,
snapdragons, stocks, statice, verbena and violas. Sow seeds of wildflowers
later in the month. See planting directions for vegetables.; Bulbs; If you're
looking for the lazy gardener's flower bed, check out the bulbs. Few plants
produce more flowers with less work. Plant spring-flowering tulips, daffodils,
hyacinths, crocus, ranunculus, alliums, Dutch irises, scillia, muscari and
watsonia. Choose big, plump, firm bulbs. Tulips and hyacinths need a four-week
chill period in the refrigerator. Other bulbs go into the soil without further
ado.;  Lawn; The best time to plant -- or repair -- the lawn is from now
through the last week in October. Seed will germinate without heavy watering,
and new sod will bond to the soil quickly. De-thatch and aerate hard-packed
turf areas, fertilize to carry the grass through winter and use a pre-emergent
control for broadleaf weeds.;  Trees, shrubs; Just about anything you can find
at the nursery can be planted now. Transplant trees, shrubs, vines and ground
covers while the soil and air temperatures are still warm to give them a full
season's root development over those planted in spring. Water in the new
plantings with a mild solution of a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) to promote
new root growth and reduce transplant shock. Add mulch for frost protection.;
Compost; As you clean up the garden, don't even think about throwing all those
goodies into the trash. Make a compost pile instead. Pile six inches or so of
leaves, grass clippings and green garden debris, along with egg shells and
peelings from the kitchen. Chop up bulky items to help them decompose faster.
Sprinkle a fertilizer high in nitrogen (12-12-12) and spread a two-inch layer
of soil on top of it all. Keep building the pile in a similar manner. Turn it
every few weeks if you wish. The winter rains will trigger the compost heap
into activity. The compost will be "done" in time for spring planting.;
Fertilize; Give trees, shrubs and ground covers a light feeding with a
low-nitrogen fertilizer to help them overwinter without putting out fresh, new
growth that could be damaged in cold weather. Switch to a 0-10-10 fertilizer
for azaleas, camellias, gardenias and rhododendrons to encourage the
development of next season's blossoming buds. Feed roses lightly and water for
their last bloom cycle before going dormant.;  Houseplants; During the short
days of winter, houseplants rest from growing and need less fertilizer and
water. So, cut back -- but don't eliminate -- both water and food. Groom
plants by clipping scraggly shoots and brown leaves. Thoroughly check for
pests, and wash them away with plain water, or spray with insecticidal soap if
needed. Flush away salts in the soil by thoroughly drenching the soil twice.
Move plants closer to a sunny window as the days shorten.;  Manure; Spread it
around. Spread a three- to four-inch layer of animal manure (not pet
droppings) on garden beds. Rain and time will help it decompose and it will be
ready to turn into the soil by spring. Horse manure is best, but cows,
chickens, rabbits and poultry also have a lot to offer. Don't use raw or fresh
manure as it usually burns plant tissues. Or, plant a "green manure" crop such
as fava beans, rye or clover. In the spring till it under to enrich the soil.;
Clean up; It's a dirty job, but someone has to do it. Pull or hoe weeds. Trim
back unruly branches on trees and shrubs that could be damaged in winter
storms, but hold off serious pruning until deciduous trees and shrubs drop all
their leaves. Pull up the summer annuals and vegetables that have done their
thing, but let tomatoes, squash and pumpkins continue to ripen. Pick up fallen
fruit and rake leaves because they are a haven to overwintering pests. Spiders
are everywhere, but leave them alone: They'll soon go away on their own.  </TEXT>
