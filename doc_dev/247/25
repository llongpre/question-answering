<TEXT>  Both big and small dahlias will be displayed this weekend at the annual show
by the John E. Stowell Dahlia Society. The event will be held Saturday and
Sunday at Westgate Mall, Campbell and Saratoga avenues, San Jose, during mall
hours. Free admission.; BEST BUY; Bring home bulbs; Spring-flowering bulbs
from Holland are bargains. Look for daffodils and anemones, priced 10 cents
each; tulips, 22 cents, and hyacinths, 49 cents. Or, buy mixed bulbs in
packages, from $1.75 per package.; TOP JOBS; Plant everything; With mild fall
weather holding on, plant shrubs, ground covers, trees, annual flowers,
vegetables and perennials. Also, clean up the yard to discourage overwintering
pests and diseases. Keep after snails; they never give up.; LAWN; Plant or
repair; From now through October is the premium time to put in a new lawn from
seed or sod, or overseed and repair a worn lawn. Apply a lawn fertilizer using
a product with a high amount of nitrogen, such as 22-3-3. Also apply a
broadleaf weed control to take care of dandelions and similar weeds. A good
bet is a combination weed control plus lawn fertilizer to cover both bases.
Also, aerate the soil and de-thatch thickly matted grass.; VEGETABLES; Sow
easy; To get a big harvest from the winter garden, sow beets, bok choy,
carrots, chard, lettuce, green onions, parsley, peas, radishes, spinach and
turnips. Let some herbs reseed themselves to overwinter in the garden. Dill,
especially, seems to germinate better this way.; YOUR CHECKLIST; (box) Switch
to a 0-10-10 fertilizer for azaleas, camellias, gardenias, and rhododendrons
to encourage formation of next spring's blossoming buds.; (box) Divide and
replant crowded perennials including agapanthus, daylilies and yarrow.; (box)
Repot houseplants and place them near a south-facing window so they can have
optimum light during the short winter days ahead.; (box) Prolong bloom on
tuberious begonias, dahlias and fuchsias by pinching off faded flowers.  </TEXT>
