<LEADPARA>  Wild in Oakland; The spring rains have done wonders for Northern California
wildflowers, so the Oakland Museum's popular annual wildflower show this
weekend promises to be one of the best ever. Great care is taken to ensure
that no rare species are picked. The free event in the Hall of California
Ecology, 10th and Oak streets, Oakland, will be held 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Saturday and noon to 6 p.m. Sunday. Information: (415) 273-3401.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>   BEST BUY; Fast starts; For the quickest results, transplant well-started
vegetables and flowers from 4-inch pots, $1. This is the place to be a savvy
consumer: Pass up plants with leggy growth or yellowish leaves. They're
already stressed and will take longer to recover -- if ever.;  TOP JOB; Just a
pinch; Prune tips of azaleas, carnations, chrysanthemums, fuchsias, geraniums,
lavender, petunias, rosemary and sedums to gently shape the plants and
encourage them to bush out. Don't allow coleus plants to flower, as the blooms
are insignificant.;  YOUR CHECKLIST;  (box) Prune overgrown forsythia and
other early-flowering shrubs as soon as they finish blooming.; (box) Snap off
faded blossoms of daffodils and tulips so that energy does not go into forming
seed pods, but will be stored in the bulbs for next year's flowers. Let
foliage dry.; (box) Plant another patch of lettuce and salad greens. Mix
several varieties, broadcast the seeds and rake them lightly into the soil.;
(box) Check ties and stakes on young trees and rose trees.;  THE LAST WORD;
Irises, again!; The word from those who have been to see the irises: This is a
great year for the flowers at Maryott's Iris Display Garden, 1069 Bird Ave.,
San Jose. With more than 400 varieties in bloom, the garden will be open
Wednesday through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., until May 12. Information: (408)
