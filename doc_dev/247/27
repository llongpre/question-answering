ravages of wet weather

THERE HAS never been such a prelude to deep winter: rain, rain and more
rain, until even the authorities in Kent have had to lift their ban on
hosepipes. Before you paddle off Christmas shopping, there are urgent
problems in your floating garden: some of them are stored for the future,
others are oversights which we like to pretend do not exist.
Looking forward, I see problems from footprints and serious danger for
flower pots. We cannot give up weeding, cutting down and replanting just
because it is a wet year, but these jobs oblige us to walk on flower beds.
Wellingtons squash the ground between border plants and flatten it into wet
cake. Whenever you are walking on the soil, be sure to lay down short planks
of wood and use them as your pedestals and tractor-treads. By spreading your
weight they stop you packing the soil so that it becomes unworkable next
spring. Fork over the ground beneath the planks as you remove them and beat
your retreat.
Flower pots need more urgent attention. The soil inside them is sopping wet
and gallons of rainwater have now drained through ornamental terracotta
urns. The first heavy frost will ice the pots on to any hard surface on
which they are standing: iced bottoms are a major reason why expensive pots
from Spain or the Far East disintegrate outdoors.
Instead, stand them on two upturned bricks or stones so that their drainage
holes are raised above the ground. The water will then run through without
freezing the pot on to its supporting surface. This protection needs action
now, before nature compounds her hostility and freezes up before Christmas.
Inside urns and large pots, remember that flower bulbs are having a
prolonged baptism. Usually, I leave them uncovered and merely hope that
winter will not freeze them and turn them to a soft mush. This year, I am
considering the example of some of our biggest public gardens where pots are
surfaced with thick plastic, lashed into place until late winter.
These defences cannot remain in place much later than the end of January
because hyacinths, daffodils and so forth will then be nosing their way
through the ground. This year, however, the soil begins from such a wet
point that a fall of snow on top of it will multiply the muddiness and the
mess from thawing frost. It may be wise to cover up potted bulbs for safety,
at least for the next six weeks or so.
As for the oversights, they concern tulips, spring bedding and the other
Dutch bulbs which you bought forwards in August, fearing chaos in the
currency markets. The fall in the pound has already pushed their prices up
by 15 per cent and nobody wants to be losing stock for next year. After a
call auction on tulips, I am still struggling to plant the delivered bulbs
in all the drizzle. What can you do if you still have tulips, wallflowers,
forget-me-nots and even some crocuses with young shoots like yellow tusks
sitting unplanted in brown paper bags?
Despite the books' advice, all is not lost. Tulips, certainly, will not fail
to flower if you plant them as deep as you can during the next fortnight. In
wet ground, accurate planting is more difficult, but you must be sure that
the bulb is sitting firmly on earth underneath it, not sideways on a pocket
of air. Indoors, some of the bulbs may have lost their outer brown tunics,
but even if you plant them looking white and naked, most of them will still
survive. They are merely more prone to diseases, especially to mould in wet
soil. If any of them are already showing tell-tale spots of
greenish-blue,throw them out before planting.
Unplanted crocuses are all shoots, no roots, but they will settle, flower
and survive even if you plant them as late as the next 10 days. Th effects
may show in 1994 when fewer corms will have grown on and made up for lost
progress. However, I still have some satisfactory plants which were planted
as late as December 18: human delay is not as dangerous to them as the
deadly attention of mice.
Forget-me-nots and wallflowers are much more obliging. Plants can still be
moved around whenever the ground is workable: those which I planted in early
October have made little more progress and those still waiting on the
sidelines. This year, the main difficulty is that wallflowers have made such
wretchedly small plants. Do not blame your carelessness: professional
growers have fared no better and tell me that they blame a dry start, a cold
spell in summer and the rain from July onwards which flattened the soil and
prevented plants from forming proper roots.
Throughout the autumn, I have been grappling with wallflowers in my two
chosen colours, Primrose Bedder and Scarlet Bedder, thinking vague thoughts
about which I would choose if they were females, not wallflowers. As plants,
nobody could have picked them for choice, because they are under-developed.
Meanwhile, I am making the best of my trump card for spring gardening: it
involves the scattering of bedding plants in the gaps down herbaceous
borders. Six years ago, we started to revive this old unorthodoxy in the
long borders in my Oxford college. Wallflowers are much the best bet,
because their roots do not run hungrily and drain too much goodness from the
soil. The art is to pack in separate clumps of wallflowers in civilised
colours wherever border plants have retreated ot their main root stocks and
left gaps in the soil. Wallflowers fill in and can be ripped out and thrown
away when the border begins to fill out in late May.
Even now, it is not too late for this easy task. If you have a choice, avoid
the mixed colours which are most widely available because they include a
high proportion of the vigorous orange varieties. Their colour is rather
beastly, a poor mix for the deeper reds and pale yellows. The job is so
rewarding because it doubles a border's season in the simplest way.
These spring bedding plants do not require their own special bed, let alone
a personal space on a roundabout by courtesy of your local council. They are
plants like any others: walk the plank on wet soil between your borders and
even at this late date, you can strike a blow for a brighter spring.
