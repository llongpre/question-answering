IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, the owls have been hooting in my garden. By daytime, an
owl-hoot means death, death for Shakespearian heroes, deadly omens for
classical generals and something nasty for columnists who have been much too
slow to plant their tulips.
I have been checking for fire blight and have feared honey fungus: I now
know why they were hooting. They were moping for my half-hardy heliotropes
and other tender plants in pot, but I have outwitted them by taking the
plants indoors before the frosts.
This year, nobody could grudge their half-hardy plants a long warm rest.
They have flourished in pots but none have flourished more than these
scented heliotropes. Ten varieties are listed in The Plant Finder, from
Chatsworth to Lord Roberts: mine is the 11th, White Swan, a heliotrope which
has pale mauve flowers and a scent straight from warm French heaven.
Heliotrope is also known as cherry pie. Its scent combines powder and
chocolate and softens the insensitivity of bedding out in France.
If you want the real thing, you need to beg some cuttings from a named form
during the next fortnight when their owners bring them under shelter.
Varieties from a seed packet have none of the scent and delicacy of the true
old Edwardian beauties.
Like most of the best things in pots, these plants are not hardy and so you
have to follow October discipline. Last week's frost took out the weaker
members of the garden unless you had anticipated it. Perhaps you still have
fuchsias, verbenas, white penstemons or any of those trailing plants with
silver leaves: if so, put them in a frost-proof shed immediately, or else my
owls will be proved right.
If you are putting a large plant or semi-shrub to rest, cut it back quite
hard and see that it is soaked heavily in water before resting in its new
home. By cutting it hard, you encourage those first green shoots which every
economist is hoping to see nowadays.
I prefer to leave these young shoots on the plant and only take them as
cuttings in early spring: some books suggest that you should root them
immediately and leave them in the same pot until March. I find that they rot
more often than not.
Each year, gardening in pots tests the wisdom of the handbooks and throws up
new possibilities. I have learned to follow rules which were being ignored
ten years ago in dictionaries: they are still being ignored in the RHS's new
Dictionary of Gardening.
They originate from amateur gardeners who have a sharp eye for decoration
and are not merely horticulturalists. Their main rule is simple: pack in
many more plants than any expert dares to tell you in print. Begin with a
pot at least 2 ft wide and into it you can pack a dozen different varieties.
They all tangle together and defy the usual wisdom so long as they are
heavily fed and watered.
This year, the reason why the heliotropes were so good is surely that I
planted them in almost nothing but animal manure. As the season ends, I can
also endorse the use of water-retaining crystals or jelly, mixed into the
compost when you plant it.
The Swel-gel really worked and I found myself watering some very heavy
plantings only twice a week, a bearable routine.
With the last of summer out of the way, the field is then clear to break the
rules with bulbs. Once again, the books and the RHS dictionary are behind
the times: they do not tell you to plant your bulbs in layers.
To my intense surprise, this method works. It allows you to put the tulips
about nine inches deep on the bottom layer and then plant a second storey of
narcissi about three inches above them and then round off near the rooftops
with a layer of crocusses just near the surface of the soil.
Like the traffic on a main street in Naples, they somehow manage to queue
without signals and move forwards without colliding.
The crocusses flower first; the narcissi then nose their way between them
and eventually, the late-flowering tulips emerge through the jungle. In one
pot, you can enjoy three seasons: they are not cheap but they are much more
fun than an ordinary old pot full of scillas.
Once again, amateurs have discovered a trick which the experts ignored for
years. Gardening in pots brings the best out of private ingenuity; pack the
bulbs in, layer upon layer, like passengers on the London Underground. They
give you three gardens in once space: this time, it is a real hoot, yours at
the expert's expense.
