The cool, wet weather has rescued gardens for a suitable autumn finale and,
with renewed faith, I am planning for next spring at this crucial moment. We
have to stir ourselves now if we do not want a bleak April, waiting for
leaves to return to the trees. We must also stir ourselves if we do not want
a drab house in February.
Let me first pass on a lesson that is especially gratifying because most of
the nurserymen have not yet woken up to it. (There is not a word about it,
either, in any of the Royal Horticultural Society pamphlets, literature and
encyclopaedias which have been fast-breeding recently.) As a result, I can
tell the trade how to double its market and make us all spend twice as much
for better results.
It should start telling us that when we plant bulbs for use in the house, we
should pile them up in layers, one above the other. I mentioned this
revolution last year, having heard about it from that revolutionary
organisation, the Women's Institute. I can now confirm that it works.
Underneath last year's hyacinths, we planted a lower layer of the white
tulip Purissima. The hyacinths flowered late in January and, when we had cut
off the dead pieces and reduced the length of leaves by half, the tulips
appeared magically in bud and doubled the room life of the entire planting.
Bolder souls put a layer of crocus on top of the hyacinths, and some of the
robust and cheap yellow-flowered narcissi Soleil d'Or underneath. One lady
stockbroker, with a very deep container, went further. She wrote to say she
spent a happy Sunday packing in crocus, hyacinths, narcissi and, lastly, the
yellow-flowered lily tulip, West Point, which surfaced through the debris
late in March and gave a fourth season in a single bowl. She considered the
result to be the one investment she made last autumn which was actually
worth more by late March.
Like all revolutions, this one is expensive, but it doubles or quadruples
your return on time and space. But when I first heard of the WI suggestion,
I thought it must be a joke. Surely the shoots of the narcissus would
dislodge the hyacinths and the tulips would be stuck underneath in the
traffic jam? But no.
The key to success is a deep flower pot. The cheapest are plastic, but they
are even more hideous than the average run of glorified cache-pots from a
country gift shop. Indoors, I concealed them or planted directly into the
deep, fluted pots of off-white china sold by the Reject Shop at up to Pounds
9 each. While these have no holes in the bottom, this did not seem to matter
last year because I prepared the soil carefully and minimised watering after
planting.
The old way of minimising watering was to use a special bulb fibre, full of
oyster-grit and willing to retain a soaking for several months. Nowadays, I
cannot find this old-fashioned bulb fibre in general stores: what they sell
under that name is simply peat, recycled under a seasonal label. I have now
given up and simply use earth from the garden into which I mix a very small
dose of water-retention crystals.
Prepare the soil in a separate container by watering it, mixing in the
crystals like ground almonds into a Mediterranean cake: then, wet the
mixture lightly in order to activate the jelly. Next, pack it into the
bowls, making sure that you have not over-jellied the mixture; otherwise,
the bulbs will rot.
Follow the usual rules: put the bowls in a dark, unheated cupboard or
frost-proof shed where they can develop roots; the crystals should mean
there will be no need for more water. Bring them into a cold room after two
months, when the central layer of hyacinths should already be showing about
2in of yellow-looking growth above the soil. Give them a week or so in which
to develop away from central heating, then space out their entry into your
main rooms.
Layered bulbs will not flower for a second season indoors, but they seem to
recover outdoors and perform no worse than hyacinths which have been growing
in the usual segregation. Those of you marooned in London or a flat without
a serious garden ought to enjoy this multiplication of results in the same
space.
Outdoors, my plans now regularly concern two families to which I thought I
had waved goodbye not long after this column began. The bother of growing
one's own wallflowers and forget-me-nots was simply too much for today's
academic part-timer: anyway, I began to tell myself how frightful those
mustard-yellow wallflowers looked on Britain-in-bloom town roundabouts.
Of course, it was sour grapes, because wallflowers have an exquisite scent
and come in far better colours. They are back in my life with a vengeance,
especially since finding a local wholesaler who supplies the councils and
does the donkey work for me.
My lesson here is extremely simple: wallflowers are shallow-rooted and can
be grown in groups between the dormant plants of your main borders without
detracting from their later seasons. I keep returning to this discovery
because it has doubled the shelf life of my flowerbeds, just as layering has
doubled the life of the bulbs.
I plant groups of up to 20 wallflowers in reds, crimsons and the less robust
Ivory White (which is neither ivory nor white) and space them at
considerable intervals in the front to middle rows of the borders. There is
no need to go to the expense and trouble of a continuous carpet; in spring,
a few repeated groups of colour lead the eye down the bare earth and are,
visually, more effective. The inter-planting with wallflowers allows me to
cut down a dying border late in October, running two jobs together.
Lastly, the forget-me-nots. I have tried to live without them but I miss
them too much, just as the name tells us we should. Again, if you hunt
around, there is sure to be a big grower for the bedding trade nearby who
will do a deal on pre-grown plants in a serious quantity.
My lesson here is much less forgettable: if you have the choice, always go
for the smaller Indigo, not the taller and looser Royal Blue. Indigo is so
much brighter, deeper and more remarkable: it is twice the plant and, only
when I had been unfaithful to it for a few seasons, did I realise how much
better it was.
Once again, a few groups go a very long way; and, as it is so compact, you
can fit it into smaller beds near the house to flower in those weeks before
everything starts running wild.
