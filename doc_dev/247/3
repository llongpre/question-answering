<LEADPARA>  IT HAPPENS every spring. Holland becomes a vast patchwork of undulating color
as blossoms of red, gold, blue, pink, yellow and purple blanket the Dutch
countryside from Haarlem to Leiden.;    Motivated by gentle breezes, dozens of
varieties of tulips, hyacinths and other exquisite blooms sway smoothly,
forming a sea of color that stretches as far as the eye can see.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The centerpiece of Holland's flower fields is the Keukenhof Gardens, a
70-acre private park outside the charming town of Lisse, about 30 minutes
outside Amsterdam.;    Open to the public for six weeks each spring, Keukenhof
has some six million bulbs, some bursting into rare or unusually colored
tulips, hyacinths, dahlias, daffodils, crocuses, irises and gladioluses.;   
The 42nd annual exhibition takes place March 28 to May 20 this year. It is
preceded on March 27 by the Keukenhof's annual Flower Parade, a fantastic
procession of flower-laden floats depicting elaborate home gardens, shade
gardens and gardens planned by color.;    Holland's top bulb growers support
and maintain the Keukenhof and show their best blooms in the artfully arranged
gardens that cover the park's well manicured grounds. Legions of gardeners
constantly groom the lavish flower beds by cutting slightly fading blossoms
and handing them to passers by.;    The park's protective hothouses exhibit
fragile or new breeds of flowers. These often show rare or unexpected colors
or unusual size. There are bowers of sweet-scented freesias, salmon-colored
lillium and tulips that are such an intense and deep purple they appear black
at first glance.;    Special pavilions, named for members of Holland's royal
family, are set up for orchid, lily and amaryllis displays. In the pavilions
and the hothouses, florists demonstrate how to make beautiful flower
arrangements.;    In the midst of this splendid floral spectacle are practical
touches, including several public picnic areas set on landscaped terraces,
play areas for children, snack bars and souvenir shops.;    The name
Keukenhof, Dutch for "kitchen garden," suggests that such an abundance of
blooms might not be extraordinary. In fact, flower-growing is a major industry
in Holland; both blooms and bulbs are cheap. But when the first tulip was
imported from Turkey and planted in Leiden in 1558, each rare bulb cost what
was then the equivalent of $200.;    Of course, no kitchen garden could boast
Keukenhof's six million spring bulbs, but a row or two of tulips or grouping
of hyacinths can enhance any patch of land. An ideal souvenir from the
Keukenhof's selling stalls is a pre-packaged selection of bulbs cleared by the
U.S. agriculture department for planting at home.;     If you go . . .; The
Keukenhof is open from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. daily. Admission is $9 for adults
or $4.50 for children. For visitors in wheelchairs it is free; senior citizen
tickets are discounted.;    The park is a short drive from Lisse, which is
between Haarlem and Leiden. Tours of the Keukenhof leave from Amsterdam's
central bus station morning and afternoon. They take about 3 1/2 hours and
cost about $30 for adults, $15 for children, including admission. An
alternative is riding the train from Amsterdam to Haarlem or Leiden, then
taking a short bus ride to Lisse's center and a shuttle bus to the Keukenhof.
Combination rail-bus-admission tickets cost about $16.;    KLM's air fares
(seven- to 14-day stay with 30-day advance booking) from New York to Amsterdam
are from $714 for travel between March 22 and May 31. KLM's Europe by Design
Tours (from $869 for air fare, hotel for four nights in Amsterdam, continental
breakfasts, ground transfers and a Holland Leisure Card covering admission to
museums and other discounts) feature a Keukenhof add-on for $47.;    For

Ave., New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 370-7367.  </TEXT>
