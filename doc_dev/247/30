<LEADPARA>  For an "instant" preview of things to come, treat yourself to pots of
flowering plants featured now at floral shops and supermarkets. Bulbous
plants, such as tulips, daffodils, crocus and Dutch iris, are unfailing
reminders of spring. Select tightly budded specimens so you can enjoy watching
the flowers open. In addition to the bulbous plants, you will find
multi-colored azaleas, cinerarias, primulas, kalanchoes, cyclamens and others
that carry the message of spring. Forced branches are a natural foil for the
potted flowering plants. Simply place them among the plants to enhance the
springtime theme.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  BEST BUY; TIME FOR TREES;    Nurseries attempting to reduce inventories are
offering discounts on trees such as photinia, pittosporum, junipers and
others. Looks for deals as much as 20 percent off trees selling from $17 or
more.; INDOORS; FORCE BLOOMS;    For indoor bouquets, cut a few branches of
almond, cherry, crabapple, forsythia, quince, spiraea and other
spring-blooming shrubs and trees. Force blooms on these branches by crushing
the ends of the stems with a hammer and placing them in warm water in a cool
area outdoors. In a week move the branches indoors to bloom.; VEGETABLES;
FIRST SEEDS;    Only a few seeds will germinate -- and they'll do that slowly
-- because the soil is still cold and damp. Sow beets, caraway, celery,
carrots, chard, leeks, lettuce, green onions, peas and radishes. Indoors start
eggplants, peppers and tomatoes as a promise to yourself that warm times are
coming.; YOUR CHECKLIST; (box) Finish pruning and spraying deciduous plants
and trees by the end of the month.; (box) Get after weeds before they become
established and take over everything. Hoe, hand pull or use an herbicide.;
(box) Plant bulbs such as gladioluses, calla and canna lilies, dahlias and
Dutch irises for summer bloom.; (box) Be alert to frost danger and protect
plants when temperatures below 32 degrees are predicted.; (box) Start seed for
summer annuals in trays or pots indoors.; (box) Although nursery stock of
bare-root fruit trees and roses is running down, you can still plant them if
you do it soon.; (box) Finish dormant pruning of dormant trees, vines shrubs
including fruit trees, roses, grapes and berries.  </TEXT>
