<TEXT>   BEST BUY; Check the sales; With nurseries and garden centers clearing out
their summer stock, there are many bargains, including dwarf citrus in
five-gallon containers, priced from $17; seed packets of summer flowers and
vegetables reduced 25 to 30 percent; and garden mums in four-inch pots, from
$1.25.; TOP JOBS; Pick and plant; This is the changeover season with summer
flowers and vegetables slowing down -- but still producing. It's also time to
plant seeds and transplants of cold-weather crops such as broccoli, cabbages,
beets, peas and chard. Flowering sweet peas can be planted; and all winter
flowers especially pansies, calendulas, cyclamens and primroses can go in now.
Bait for snails. They never give up.; HERBS; The freshest pick; Many herbs are
reaching full maturity just now. For best flavor, pick basil, parsley, thyme
and others in early morning or evening. Their aromatic oils dissipate in the
heat of the sun.; YOUR CHECKLIST; (box) Pinch out new blossoms and growing
tips of melons, winter squash and tomatoes to force growth into the fruits
that have already been set.; (box) Remove and destroy fruit mummies on the
ground or still on the tree to reduce the chance of disease next year.; (box)
Fertilize strawberries with a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus and high-potassium
fertilizer to help them harden off for winter.; (box) Switch to a 0-10-10
fertilizer for azaleas, camellias, gardenias and rhododendrons to encourage
formation of next spring's blossom buds.; (box) Divide and replant crowded
perennials including agapanthus, daylilies and yarrow.; (box) Plant
spring-flowering bulbs such as tulips, daffodils and alliums.; THE LAST WORD;
A pretty pickle; If you make pickles, save dill flowers that have just bloomed
and are going to seed. Their flavor is far stronger than that of ferny dill
leaves, and they look beautiful in a pickle jar. Pick the dill heads while
they are still green or yellow-green and store in the freezer until you are
ready to use them.  </TEXT>
