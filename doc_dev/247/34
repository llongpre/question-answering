<CAPTION>  Photos (5); PHOTO: Yellow ribbon; A multi-colored tulip with large pointed
flowers is Jackson &amp; Perkins' 1992 Tulip of the Year. The name comes from the
various shades of yellow: The outer petals are ivory white and flamed sulphur
yellow, whiter toward edges. The inner petals are veined pale yellow on ivory
white ground, while the inside petals are feathered canary yellow on ivory
white. (Color); PHOTO: Top roses; All That Jazz, a coral and salmon blend

<LEADPARA>  LET'S be honest: Labels that tout All-America "whatever" -- roses, carrots and
so forth -- are marketing gimmicks created to catch the buyer's interest. But
they're also superior offerings. Gardeners who buy them can expect better than
average results in their own yards.;   Rose growers, for instance, put their
faith in All-America Rose Selections. AARS is a non-profit organization of
U.S. rose producers who test new varieties and determine which, if any, can be
recommended to the public as exceptional. Each year companies submit roses to
test gardens around the country for a two-year trial.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The 1992 AARS winners are Brigadoon, a hybrid tea rose with coral pink
petals that are cream reverse at the base; Pride 'N' Joy, an
orange-with-yellow-reverse miniature; and All That Jazz, a shrub with coral
and salmon blend flowers.;   All-America Selections does for vegetables and
flowers what AARS does for roses. The AAS's red, white and blue shield,
appears with top varieties in seed catalogs, on seed packets and on plant
labels. The 1992 winners are Lady in Red salvia, Thumbelina carrot, Fernleaf
dill, Pretty in White vinca, Ideal Violet dianthus, Peaches &amp; Cream verbena,
and Tropical Rose canna.;   Also, some catalogs offer "exclusive" varieties.
Jackson &amp; Perkins, for one, chose a multi-yellow tulip, Yellow Ribbon, as 1992
Tulip of the Year.  </TEXT>
