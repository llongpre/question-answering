<TEXT>  Autumn color is showing up everywhere, but one of the best displays of fall
foliage and flowers is at the University of California, Berkeley, Botanical
Gardens. You can walk through the gardens at your own pace any day or take a
docent-led tour on weekends at 1:30 p.m. The gardens, with their wide paths,
are wheelchair accessible. Location: Centennial Drive behind the UC-Berkeley
football stadium. Information: (510) 642-3343.; BEST BUY; Mums and more;
Winter flowers, such as chrysanthemums, cyclamens and azaleas, are one way to
brighten surroundings both indoors and out. Look for these flowers, priced
from $5 each in four-inch pots.; TOP JOB; Slow growing; With more chill in the
air, plants are growing slower. But there is still enough midday warmth to get
some results. Sow or transplant vegetables such as fava beans, beets,
broccoli, cabbage and chard. Also put in transplants of calendulas, gazania,
primroses, stocks, pansies and violas. Sow wildflower seeds. Bait for snails,
as they never give up.; SPRAY; Dormant schedule; Plan your dormant fruit tree
spraying schedule to coincide approximately with cool-weather holidays --
Thanksgiving, New Year's Day and Valentine's Day. Specific cues are the fall
of the last leaf (Thanksgiving), the height of dormancy (New Year's Day) and
bud swell (Valentine's Day). The experts say dormant oils and peach-leaf curl
controls won't hurt predator insects released to control ash whiteflies. The
predators and whiteflies overwinter only on trees with leaves.; YOUR
CHECKLIST; (box) Plant the last of your spring-flowering bulbs including
tulips, daffodils and ranunculus.; (box) Plant azaleas, camellias, forsythias,
dogwoods and oriental magnolias before the weather gets any colder.; (box)
Fertilize lawns with slow-release nitrogen for gradual, consistent feeding all
winter long.; (box) Coat the underside of your lawn mower with used oil to
inhibit rust and help keep grass clippings from sticking to the mower.; (box)
Clean up the garden area. Stacks of pots, lumber and garden furniture can
become nesting places for earwigs, snails, slugs and other pests.; (box) Prune
dead or damaged tree limbs, or mark them with paint so you won't miss them
later when you do winter dormant pruning.  </TEXT>
