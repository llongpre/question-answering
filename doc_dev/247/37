IF YOU thought artificial flowers were the sort of naffery that went with
flying ducks, garden gnomes and dear little knick-knacks all over the place,
then you should hurry along to Pulbrook &amp; Gould where there are silk flowers
to make you think again.
Pulbrook &amp; Gould is that most establishment, most revered of florists, and
when it decides to do something it does it properly - nothing but the best
silk and tender hand-painting for them. Roses, hydrangeas, daffodils,
tulips, polyanthus . . . almost everything the garden has, Pulbrook &amp; Gould
now offers in silk.
Some prefer silk flowers to look as real as possible, and P&amp;G has these in
splendidly realistic ready-made arrangements. Personally, I think they look
best when used as a witty conceit, when their artificiality is all part of
the fun. The tulips planted in strict little rows, like the ones in the
picture above, work, to my mind, better than the large mixed bunches
pretending to be real.
But each to his own taste - Pulbrook &amp; Gould will sell the flowers singly
(medium tulips Pounds 10.50, large Pounds 12.50) or make up arrangements in
customers' containers or to suit customers' own colour schemes.
Pulbrook &amp; Gould is at Liscartan Houses, 127 Sloane Street, London SW1X 9AS.
