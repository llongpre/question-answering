GARDENERS are enjoying their best spring for years; everything looks green
and happy; lilacs are already in flower and this years' edition of The Plant
Finder has just come out to join them. To celebrate it, I have taken a break
from preventive poisoning: heading west looking for ideas on what we could
all be growing. Westwards towards Worcestershire, there are ideas by the
dozen, some of which are easier to accommodate than others. Yellow Alyssum
is too harsh for my taste, but there might be possibilities in imitating red
Darwin tulips in grass, while the blossom on the apple trees should cause us
all to regret those which had to be grubbed out soon after we entered the
EC.
Near Malvern, there is the best selection of Michaelmas daisies in any
nursery in the country; at Kingswynford near Kidderminster, there are the
best Lewisias; near Tewkesbury (WHoo in The Plant Finder) there is a list of
admirably grown Alpines within vibration-range of the town's dual
carriageway; they are so fairly priced that most were bought months ago. All
in all, patient plant finders could be lost for days in the
Gloucester-Worcestershire triangle. My taste has learned most from one of my
favourite hunting-grounds, the walled garden and nursery at Stone House
Cottage, Stone, near Kidderminster.
This small nursery is no longer a stranger to connoisseurs. Its mastermind
is Louisa Arbuthnot, and when I wrote about her enterprise six years ago,
the article managed to sing her praises as the skilled keeper of several
thousand pets. The 'pets' should have been 'pots,' but this unsolicited
credit has not stopped the nursery from widening its clientele or the
proprietors from adding a fifth baby to their family. They continue to
propagate, criticise and supply a huge range of plants with a highly
personal labelling system.
The enterprise depends on an exceptionally sharp-eyed wife, a reassuringly
informed husband and no more than one willing assistant. This time I have
returned with young plants of a rare Oriental buddleia, collected by a keen
woman amateur gardener from the Great Wall of China when tourism was still
politically defensible.
A grey-leaved and pink-flowered variety, it has proved quite hardy and ought
to be an apt choice for my own local wall against barbarism: the ancient
city wall of Oxford, which stands in my college gardens.
The nursery supplies visitors only, but I am not trying to tantalise you by
writing merely about a source off the beaten track. Stone House Cottage has
a second string to its bow. The owners planted many of their nursery's plant
in their adjacent walled garden and, as they have lived there for some 20
years, the garden has become a living lesson.
It alerts you to the potential of plants which are otherwise names in a
list, by showing them off at maturity. The setting is not so grand that it
is inimitable.
This weekend, beds at the foot of the walls have white-flowered Bleeding
Heart, the last of the tulips and a rare Blue Eyed Mary which has little
blue flowers starred with white. Pink and yellow Epimediums keep company
with some exceptional rarities, none finer than a plant of Corydalis
Flexuosa. This lovely variety was introduced after an Oriental field-trip
and was already the talks of experts in the lunch-tent at last year's
Chelsea flower show. I now see why. This one plant was smothered in a flock
of crested flowers in an electric shade of blue which outclasses anything
except spring gentians.
Such rarities are beyond most of us, but the shrubs and wall-plants are
another matter. Many of you know or grow the pale yellow flowers of Rose
Canary Bird which is so good in a pot or tub. On Stone House Cottage's wall,
I was attracted once by a deeper and richer variety. It turned out to be
Rose Helen Knight which was bred in the late 1960s and is not related to
Canary Bird at all.
Its parents are a wild yellow rose from Afghanistan, and a plain Scots
Burnet variety. Its breeder, Frank Knight, thought highly of it, but
gardeners have been slower to follow his judgment. If you see a mature
plant, you realise at once that it is a winner. It is located against the
clashing red leaves of a young Pieris in its Worcestershire setting.
Starting from scratch, it would be good in a pot or against a wallat a
height of 5 ft, even in semi-shaded conditions.
Like Rose Canary Bird, the usual forms of Flowering Currant or Ribes are
very well known. One form, however, is more like a flowering gooseberry, the
prickly ribes speciosum. Its crimson-red flowers hang downwards from the
branches and are hardier when trained against a sunny wall. At a flower
show, young plants look ever so slightly boring. At maturity, it is quite
different: after eight years or so, it is looking its best in its
Worcestershire setting.
So has a white-flowered white lilac with a touch of ink-blue to its single
petals. In Oxford's Botanic Garden, Syringa persica alba is trained
vertically up a wall where it flowers very freely. In the walled nursery
garden, this lilac bulges forward at a lower height, not far from tall
pink-flowered Syringa microphylla, one of the great repeat-flowerers in the
family. Together they remind you that large-flowered hybrid lilacs do not
have things all their own way in May.
Established gardens also reassure those of us who are not so far down a new
garden's path. They show you small daphne retusa after 10 years or a
daphniphyllum looking its best; they prove to you that Sycopsis is not just
a suitable name for another dark green shrub with tediously small flowers.
They also show you that one day, too, your own choices will make the grade.
A mainstay of my own newish plantings is the scented white Viburnum
carlcephalum. Since planting it, I have read criticisms of it because it is
less refined than the less vigorous varieties such as Carlesii. Its choice
cost me hours of uncertainty, but I wanted a good grower which could be
pruned gradually into an upright bush like a small standard tree above low
carpets of small hardy plants.
Will the carlcephalum agree to be clipped and grow upwards not outwards?
Books never give the answer, and my young bushes are already bulging
sideways with huge crops of the big scented flowers.
At Stone House Cottage, a much older bush has reached just the height and
shape I have envisaged. Returning home, I have seen a dozen new names at
their mature best, but I have also seen evidence that a bet on the future is
really going to work.
