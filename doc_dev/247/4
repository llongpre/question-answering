Photo, Flower Display in Full Bloom: Tens of thousands of flowers, from tulips 
to daffodils to roses to camellias, are on display at Descanso Gardens in La 
Canada Flintridge. "The mild weather has really been a blessing, since the 
tulips and other flowers are putting on a longer display," said Mary Ann 
Arnett, president of the Descanso Gardens Guild, which is sponsoring the 
monthlong event. Flower shows and lectures highlight the flower festival, which 
culminates with the San Fernando Valley Rose Show this weekend. Descanso 
Gardens is open from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. For more information about the event, 
call (818) 790-5571. Photos by RICARDO DeARATANHA / Los Angeles Times
