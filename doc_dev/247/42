<TEXT>  BEST BUY; Plant everything; Just about everything you can find at the nursery
now is a good bet for fall planting. Look for annual flowers and vegetables in
six-packs, priced from $1.49; mums in four-inch pots, from $1.25; daffodil
bulbs, 10 cents each; and camellias in five-gallon containers, from $17.; TOP
JOBS; Don't let up; This is the best time of the year to plant a new lawn or
reseed a worn one. Feed the lawn and apply a pre-emergent weed control. Give
trees, shrubs and ground covers a light feeding with a low-nitrogen
fertilizer. Clean up the yard, and put the garden debris in a compost pile.
Plant spring-flowering bulbs including daffodils, tulips, hyacinths and
crocus.; VEGETABLES; Frost forward; Vegetables that tolerate light frosts will
provide fresh produce through winter. These include beets, Chinese and
savoy-leafed cabbages, collards, kale, butterhead and romaine lettuces,
flat-leafed parsley, radishes, turnips, spinach and Swiss chard. Sow or
transplant two or three times the amount you would use for spring harvest, as
these overwintering crops will grow very slowly with sketchy harvests.;
TECHNIQUE; Divide and conquer; To divide perennials, let the plants harden off
by reducing the watering as the weather cools. Water the site the day before
digging. Dig around the plants, loosen the roots and gently pull the plants
apart. Or, use a shovel or a sharp knife to cut apart the roots. Replant each
root division immediately.; YOUR CHECKLIST; (box) Trim hedges and shrubs that
block driveways, walkways or the views to the street.; (box) Keep watering
perennials, shrubs and roses; keep seed beds moist.; (box) Buy bulbs, and
don't forget extras for potting for indoor winter bloom.;   (box) Pull crops
