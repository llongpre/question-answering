Old-timers know it, but if this is your first visit to Chelsea and
especially if you are a non-gardener, the following are the marvels of the
Great Marquee. Miss these bravura displays and I am tempted to say you have
missed the heart of the world's greatest flower show.
Every year, the celebrated Woodford Brothers of Stratford-upon-Avon arrange
a glorious symphony of lupins. Warmenhoven's bowls of enormous tulips always
hold me spellbound, as do Brenda Hyatt's extraordinary auriculas. Equally
unmissable are Blackmore &amp; Langdon's begonias and delphiniums and S &amp; N
Brackley's sweet peas.
For floral perfection, look to the fuchsia displays (Potash Nursery and
Roualeyn Nursery). Indoor gardeners are always well served at Chelsea - year
after year, Dibleys' stand has inspired people with a passion for
streptocarpus, one of the most charming and easiest of flowering
house-plants.
Pleiones always look tempting on Butterfields Nursery's stand. Tropical Rain
Forest's display of bromeliads or 'air plants' can be relied upon to
fascinate.
Serious plant hunters must look for two specialist shrub and tree nurseries.
Mallet Court Nursery's owner is something of a plant-collector. He displays
rarities such as Tapiscia sinensis (an anagram of pistacia), raised from
seed sent from China, Pterocarya insignis, and exotic oaks grown from seed
collected in the mountains of Mexico. Acer enthusiasts should inspect
Millicient, a jazzy variety of Acer morrisonense Hayata.
Bluebell Nurseries of Swadlincote in Derbyshire is another connoisseurs'
nursery, and it boasts Sinocalycanthus chinensis, a shrub with white flowers
in June. It also exhibits Caragana jubata, described as a strange, shaggy
Mongolian affair, and Senecio gnapholodes, a prostrate willow-like plant
from Crete.
Several delphiniums make their debut, among them Albert Sheppard from
perennial specialists Rougham Hall, and salmon-pink Princess Caroline from
Burncoose. A Dutch creation, it achieves the long looked-for goal of a
tall-growing red delphinium which can be grown out of doors.
Variegation is an easy way to stand out in a crowd. This year Bressingham
Gardens is launching Polemonium Brise d'Anjou, discovered in France. I also
look forward to their new verbena Homestead Purple.
Even more eagerly anticipated are the year's new clematis exhibited by
Valley Clematis, which always makes a lovely show. Lady in Red sounds
intriguing if alarming, with its orangey-red flowers. There are five new
varieties from the US and Guernsey. Arctic Queen sounds like a winner if it
is true that here is a double white which really is double and floriferous
for the whole season.
Gardeners can rely on unearthing something to their advantage in the
educational section. If there is something nasty in the lawn, the Institute
of Groundsmanship will analyse specimens. This year the University of
Reading addresses itself to the compelling problem of pest control. And at
the Plantlife stand you can do your bit for the environment by joining the
Great Hedge Scheme.
This year's show gardens more than ever are linked to charities. Watch out
for the gardens for the blind, for allergy sufferers, for people with
learning disabilities, families with sick children, and even a holistic
garden for the terminally ill.
