<LEADPARA>  THIS IS the fall that thinks it must be spring.;   In September, the magnolias
bloomed in the New York Botanical Garden. A few weeks later, the lilacs
blossomed on Martha's Vineyard. In Washington, the rhododendrons are out.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But hey, if farmers can water-ski on cornfields, as they did in Iowa in
May, why can't a dogwood bloom in October?;   "We had rhododendrons and
dogwoods and pears blooming at the National Arboretum," said Marc Cathey, a
horticulturist for the Agriculture Department in Beltsville, Md.;   Floods and
droughts. Heat waves and cold spells. This year has seen everything. Is it
global warming, or the age-old vagaries of weather?;   "I think that some of
the extremes we've seen this year are related to the greenhouse effect," said
Dr. James Hansen, a climatologist at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.;   "But
weather is always highly variable. It's very difficult, if not impossible, to
blame any particular event on a long-term trend like global warming.";  
Strange as it seems, this fall's "spring" is a perfectly natural response to a
confluence of weather events, including the past mild winter and early spring,
a blast of extreme summer heat followed by rain, and Hurricane Bob in August.;
  Last winter was extremely mild, setting the stage for unusual blooming this
year in the Northeast.;   The mild winter led into a very warm March and
April, which sent plants into an avalanche of bloom.;   "We had tulips and
daffodils flowering at the same time, which is not normal," said Michael
Ruggiero, special gardens curator at the New York Botanical Garden in the
Bronx.;   The good news was that the hot, dry conditions of May resulted in
near-perfect pollination. The bees and butterflies had a field day, and it was
a bumper crop for peaches, raspberries and beach plums.;   Flowers bloomed
like gangbusters, but out of whack.;   The heat and drought also sent some
plants into early dormancy. Then a mild rainy spell in August and September
caused them to break bud, or flower, as if it were spring. Thus the jolly pear
trees and dogwoods of Washington.;   New Yorkers went dormant on July 21, when
the mercury hit 102 and ozone lay over the city like a suffocating pillow.
They suffered through 38 days of temperatures of 90 or better. That broke the
1944 record of 37 days.;   New York was not the only hot place. The Goddard
Institute's Hansen said 1990 "was the warmest year average of the world,"
adding, "The cherry blossoms in Washington and Tokyo both broke the records by
10 days."  </TEXT>
