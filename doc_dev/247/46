<LEADPARA>  AS Macy's Union Square was about to open Monday morning, Dick Korpi had
something on his mind: moss.;    Korpi was standing on Stockton Street,
alternately pointing and mouthing directions to one of his assistants who at
that moment was inside one of the store's huge display windows.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MACY'S 45TH FLOWER SHOW TAKES NEW PATH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A bit of moss in a fantasy English-style garden was quickly returned to its
proper place.;    Nothing is left to chance at Macy's 45th Annual Flower Show,
which opened last weekend and runs through April 6. As floral consultant to
the show, Korpi knows that better than most.;    About 100 workers spent three
nights setting up stunning window displays, huge flower-covered arches over
the store's main aisle, a recreated Muir Woods scene, a tropical area
featuring 15-foot-tall bamboo palms and scores of other, smaller-scale special
flower effects.;    Everything was installed by 6:30 a.m. the day the show
opened, but that didn't mean nap time. Every night, after the store closes,
two or three workers water the live species, remove dead blossoms and replace
cut flowers as needed. The most challenging task will be when the arches,
which don't hold moisture well because they're so high above the floor, are
replanted this weekend.;    "It's a constant thing," said Brian Preussker,
whose long-winded title of group vice president of visual merchandising and
store design really means that he's in charge of how the flower show looks.;  
 This show's stunner is the English garden scene, complete with a column-lined
stone path, that weaves its way through several windows. In the past, each
window had a separate theme.;    "We wanted to create an environment for a
garden you could walk though," Preussker said. The show's designers didn't
want something that looked formal or tailored. What they now call the
"overgrown colonnade look" began when Preussker saw a photo of a natural
English garden in an airline magazine.;    The Macy's version is awash in
color. For example, in one little corner of the window on Stockton and
O'Farrell, there's orange Asian lilies, yellow and cream Gerbera daisies, deep
purple cineria, echeria (a succulent with orange flowers) and a brilliant
red-and-yellow Rembrandt tulip.;    Some other don't misses include:;    (box)
The 55-year-old white "snowbird" azaleas that have part of the show since its
debut in 1946. Raised by the Gomes family at their Oakland nursery, these
might be some of the best-cared-for flowers in the world. They work two weeks
a year at Macy's and spend the remaining 50 weeks getting cleaned, pruned,
watered, fertilized and sprayed.;    (box) Rare South American amaryllis --
including several extinct species -- on public display for the first time.
They resulted from the work of Fred Meyer, an Escondido plant breeder who grew
the wild species from seeds he collected in Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and
Brazil. Commercial production of these plants is still at least four or five
years away.;    Shoppers who want the total package should stop and smell the
flowers and then take an elevator to the fifth floor. There, 13 elegant,
whimsical table settings, complete with floral china, provoke "I wish I could
afford these" sentiments.;    Highlights include a garden gazebo setting that
uses an array of pastel colors and features chairs with bustles; an artists'
table with palettes as placemats, a painter's box as centerpiece and "Cezanne"
china by Mikasa; and an American table that uses wooden gameboards as
placemats, a collection of weathervanes as a centerpiece, nostalgic
knickknacks and "Petite Fleur" china by Villeroy &amp; Boch.;    Back downstairs,
docents from the San Francisco Landscape Garden Show lead tours each
afternoon. They point out highlights and add some behind-the-scenes tidbits.
On Monday, the store's first floor was crowded as the floral extravaganza was
having its intended effect -- turning flower lovers into potential customers.
A Macy's official says both foot traffic and sales increase during the show
though no specific figures were available.;    Someone else who benefits from
the show is Al Dubayah, who sells flowers at an outdoor stand at the corner of
Stockton and Geary. Some of the people who leave Macy's are inspired enough to
buy an $8 bunch of tulips from Dubayah at they head toward Union Square.;   
Dubayah, though, isn't a big fan of the show. "I think they should have stuck
with themes," he says, mentioning "The Hobbit" as one of his favorites from
the past. "It's just a bunch of flowers thrown on the windows.";  IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED; Floral displays can be seen in both Macy's buildings near Union
Square in San Francisco during regular store hours. Windows remain lit until
