Anyone who has traveled to the Pacific Northwest in spring has seen one of the 
region's most glorious sights -- huge yellow daffodils, thousands of them, 
glowing in the fog as if lighted from within. 
</P>
<P>
Many Southern Californians have come home from such trips eager to grow those 
splendid flowers in their gardens. Come fall, they rush out, buy two dozen of 
the King Alfred bulbs they saw blooming in such profusion in Washington and 
Oregon, plant them and wait for success. And they're almost invariably 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are the blossoms not as spectacular here, the King Alfred usually 
performs well only during the first year it's planted. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're happy with the King Alfred's blossoms that first year, be satisfied 
and throw out the bulbs," says Polly Anderson, a lifelong gardener and a 
founding member of the Southern California Daffodil Society. "However, part of 
(the society's) ambition is to find varieties that do well in Southern 
California -- and that means ones that will naturalize." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend at Descanso Gardens, you'll have the opportunity to see daffodils 
that do do well in Southern California; so well, in fact, that they will often 
naturalize -- in other words, make themselves right at home in your garden and 
come back year after year without much effort on your part. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who is an expert on creating new strains through cross-pollination, 
says Peeping Tom and February Gold are daffodils that do particularly well in 
this area. Both are yellow and both have blooms on the small side. 
</P>
<P>
"The white ones, in general, don't do as well here as the yellow ones, but the 
blends of yellow and white do fine," she says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sun Lovers 
</P>
<P>
She suggests planting the bulbs in a sunny location in September or October. 
Set them six to eight inches deep and add a good, low-nitrogen granulated 
fertilizer to the planting hole. Then water the bed moderately but regularly. 
You won't see their sunny faces until early spring. 
</P>
<P>
"When the green spikes peek out of the ground, begin watering heavily," 
Anderson says. "It's really hard to over-water when daffodils are in their 
fast-growing and blooming stages." Give them another good feeding when they 
begin to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Then, enjoy. With luck and a little cold weather, you'll have blooms for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After the blossoms are gone, let the greens rest until they bend over and lose 
all traces of green. When they're completely brown, cut them off at ground 
level and resume a light watering schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Daffodils like the company of other plants in the garden and don't mind poking 
up through annuals. "A lot of old-timers plant the daffodils right in their 
lawns, where they'll naturalize. Then they just leave them there," Anderson 
says. "We even know one fine grower who lets the weeds grow around his 
daffodils as a natural mulch, which he doesn't pull until the blossoms are 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide Selection of Bulbs 
</P>
<P>
Local nurseries typically have a good selection of daffodil bulbs on hand 
during planting season -- but, again, don't be hoodwinked by the spectacular 
photos on the King Alfred boxes. You might also want to write for a catalogue 
from Grant Mitsch Novelty Daffodils, P.O. Box 218, Hubbard, Ore. 97032 -- 
you'll see varieties that never are available through retail outlets here, and 
the catalogue does note which strains are well-suited for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All in the Family 
</P>
<P>
The daffodil, like the jonquil, is a member of the narcissus group and all are 
part of the amaryllis family; many members of the family thrive in Southern 
California. Anderson is particularly fond of the paper-white narcissus, which 
smell divine and naturalize beautifully. Because of our cool February, many 
narcissus are still in bloom, and some will be on display during the 
competition at Descanso Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Daffodil Society Competition, today from 1:30 to 4 p.m. 
and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge, 
will feature 200-300 different kinds of daffodils, from old favorites such as 
Tete-a-Tete, a miniature yellow trumpet, to strains so new that you won't find 
them in any catalogue. Although there is no additional fee for viewing the 
competition, general admission to the gardens is $3; seniors 62 and older and 
students with ID $1.50; children 5-12, 75 cents; 4 and younger are free. 
</P>
<P>
A number of classes on growing the daffodils, including sessions on 
cross-pollination, will be featured throughout the two-day competition.
