<TEXT>  Filoli Center in Woodside is starting the new season with tours of the
historic 43-room mansion and gardens. Although there has been some freeze
damage, the word from Filoli is that the early-spring spectacles -- magnolias,
250 different varieties of camellias and the fragrant daphne -- are at their
best. Tulip beds and daffodils will start their show near the end of February
along with quince, forsythia and rhododendrons. Docent-led tours are scheduled
Monday through Saturday at 10 a.m.. Cost is $4 adults; no children under 12
including babies in strollers. Advance reservations are required: (415)
364-2880.; BEST BUY; Barely bare; Bare-root trees are beginning to break their
dormancy, so nurseries are scrambling to clear them out before growth starts.
Look for fruit trees priced from $10, and No. 1-grade rose bushes from $6.;
HOUSEPLANTS; From the heart; Cyclamen with its heart-shaped leaves and flowers
is a plant well-suited to Valentine's Day. So is the gloxinia. The bell-shaped
flowers come in shades of red, white, red with a white edge, pink, rose and
purple, and in single- and double-flowered form. A potted azalea is another
good bet. Proper watering is essential. Don't let the soil become too dry.;
CHECKLIST; (box) Feed deciduous fruit trees about three weeks before their
expected bloom time.; (box) Keep pruning tools sharp and clean. Wipe the blade
with rubbing alcohol after every three or four cuts to avoid transferring
disease from one plant to another.; (box) Finish pruning roses. The sap starts
to rise about the middle of February and leaves will start coming out. Clean
up soil underneath the bushes.; (box) Check peach and nectarine trees for bud
swell and apply peach-leaf curl controls at the right time. Before bud swell
is too early, but after bud break is too late. By next week, most trees will
be at bud break stage.; THE LAST WORD; Water smart; With severe water
rationing hanging over our heads, take time for a hard look at your garden to
weed out the wimps. Remove sick or poorly performing plants because they waste
water. Get rid of freeze-damaged plants that will need lots of care and much
water before recovering, and eliminate plants that are just taking up space.
Pull, hoe or spray weeds; they steal water from other plants.  </TEXT>
