All year, tulip-growers have been celebrating the 400th anniversary of the
tulip's first flowering in Holland; today, we celebrate its birthday with
theological correctness as a chapter in the history Mammon
Within 40 years of the tulip's first flowering, people were already
speculating in it madly. Instead of planting it, they bought tulip-futures,
sold them to the next man and left the bother of delivery and gardening to
the last mutt in the chain. Perhaps we should reintroduce them for
non-gardening readers in the winter. After the market crashed, one great
academic could never look a tulip in the face again. So many fortunes had
been lost that he would attack the tulips with a stick whenever he passed
them. I will be doing the same with dollars, if they carry on down.
Meanwhile, non-speculators ought to be planting their tulips during this
weekend and the next three. They prefer a sunny, well-drained soil and at
least 3 ins of it above the tops of their bulbs. If you plant them up to
9ins deep, they are safe from passing forks and can be left in the ground
for years. Nonetheless, many of them will not persist. Deep or shallow, they
will flower in the first year, dwindle in the second and disappear in the
third.
The growers tell us to dig them up each year in late May, bury them lightly
in a secondary bed and then pick them over in autumn to eliminate those
which have shrunk. These bulblets can then be replanted and grown on for up
to three years, like a small business, until they are ready again for public
display. I have never had the patience for this routine. Instead, I add a
dressing of potash fertiliser and dig it lightly into the surface of the
soil after planting. It helps to delay the dwindling.
Why do tulips deteriorate? I know three reasons. They miss the rich, silty
soil of Holland or Lincolnshire where the sellers grow them. There is
nothing we can do about that unless we move to the Netherlands.
Alternatively, they may have been eaten by slugs; an expert grower tells me
that this problem is much more widespread than other experts realise. Last
winter, slugs ate the leaves on all my scillas and I bet they had a go at
the tulips. The best defence is deep planting, down to 9ins, below the
slug-line. A top dressing of slug killer is worth the effort.
The third reason is the most regrettable. Many of the most impressive modern
varieties are simply not tough enough for full-size flowering after a year
or two in Britain's unimpressive garden soils. I have learned to prefer
proven varieties and choose the easier of the wild forms which are much
tougher.
If you want one persistent hybrid tulip, choose the one which has lasted
longest in the lists: pink Clara Butt. She has become less familiar nowadays
but she outlasts all others in her class. I also find that the lily-flowered
varieties retain their size of flower for many years. I have three proven
favourites: the yellow West Point, which is a real winner, the deep satin
China Pink, and the tall White Triumphator. So many of the other colours
shrink from year to year but if I was speculating for one season I would
always choose white Carrara, pink and white striped Marilyn, which looks so
stylish in pots, and the lovely lemon yellow Sweet Harmony, which is edged
with white. This spring, I saw several gardens where four or five
well-chosen varieties had been mixed in a multi-coloured cluster. The effect
was fresh, a change from those solemn lines of yellow, then pink which you
see in parks or on the mudflats by Dutch windmills. Nurserymen's mixtures
include some awful carmines but you can mix a selection for yourself.
The best value of all is found in the smaller forms which are closer to the
wild. The white tulip which lasts longest is the short Tulip fosteriana
Purissima; the most persistent striped form is the plain Water Lily tulip,
or kaufmanniana, which is a mixture of ivory yellow and red. Avoid its other
forms, seductively named after great musicians, because most of them are not
harmonious. Recently, I have learnt to value the lilac and yellow flowers of
Tulip bakeri Lilac Wonder, whose flowers open widely in April and have
persisted very well in a sharp, sunny soil. You would not expect a wild
tulip from central Asia to be reliable in the British midlands but I have
also had long life from the lovely soft yellow Tulip batalinii.
The nearer you return to the wild, the more stamina you find in many tulips.
They grow naturally from Greece to central Asia but it is extraordinary that
the ancient Greeks never mentioned them, although they lived with their
flowers each spring. They seem to puzzle their successors too. Not long ago,
I looked across a Greek olive grove of wild tulips in the company of two
great ancient historians who remarked that they never realised that the
Greeks imported so many tulips from Holland. Perhaps these non-botanists
would prefer tulip-futures instead, but we would have to take away their
walking-sticks if they lost bets.
