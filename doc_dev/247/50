<LEADPARA>  A VEGETABLE gardener gets to enjoy unusual flowers, a bonus for the soul in a
pastime otherwise centered on the earthier pleasure of good eating.;  
Gardeners or not, we all know what roses and tulips look like. You don't need
soil-rimmed fingernails and a weatherbeaten complexion to tell a pansy from a
daisy. But an eggplant flower, uncelebrated in song and story, saves its
lovely bloom for those who grow it.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     With lavender petals and a golden center, the eggplant flower reigns as the
belle of my vegetable patch. In midsummer I eagerly await the appearance of
these daisy-sized blooms from which the equally beautiful purple or white
eggplant itself will soon emerge.;   In the 1980s, a school of gardening
developed called "edible landscaping," a fascinating activity that could use a
more poetic name. Basically, its devotees plant handsome vegetables like
red-stemmed rhubarb chard among regular ornamentals to provide contrast and
excitement as well as food.;   A pioneer of the movement, Rosalind Creasy of
Los Altos, put many suggestions and techniques together in "The Complete Book
of Edible Landscaping" (Sierra Club Books, 1982). It's startling to see how
many vegetables can double as decorative plants in flower beds and containers
and on trellises, fences and walls.;   Beans, red cabbage, carrots, eggplants,
kale, lettuce, mustard greens, okra, snow peas, peppers, squash, sweet
potatoes, tomatoes -- all have ornamental uses in their leaves, vines, flowers
or fruit.;   Next to the eggplant, I'd call the zucchini bloom the most
beautiful and certainly most striking. Bright yellow against contrasting dark
green leaves, this squash flower resembles a lily and may reach a breadth of
four inches. The flower itself is edible, too, an epicure's treat.;   Chives
burst into small lavender flowers at the end of their spring eating season. I
have a particularly shapely cluster along the garden path that has never
failed to produce an attractive bouquet.;   In a quest for beauty among the
vegetables, new challenges beckon. We have some old stone walls on which to
feature the brilliant red, white or purple flowers of runner beans. Okra, I'm
told, boasts a stunning, hibiscus-like creamy or yellow flower. I may try
that, but the trouble is: How much chicken gumbo can I eat?  </TEXT>
