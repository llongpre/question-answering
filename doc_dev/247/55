IN ANY town in Britain a garden is a precious asset. No matter how small, or
how apparently dingy, it is worth taking trouble over. Quite apart from the
pleasure of sitting in it on the few balmy summer days, a garden can also be
a year-long visual delight. Our own patch is small enough but from the
kitchen window I see it day in and day out, and even in winter the trees
beyond it, the birds, the foliage in the containers and the climbers are an
endless source of interest.
However, few of us do as much with our little patches as we could. The
smaller the garden, the more carefully it needs to be thought about, and
although landscape architects have a vested interest in wittering on about
how much houseowners are prepared to spend on their kitchens and how little
on their gardens, they do have a point.
Putting a garden in order can actually cost surprisingly little,
particularly when compared with the vast amounts some of the so-called
luxury kitchens are prone to run into. For instance, a designer like Jane
Eastoe (117 Chetwynd Road, London NW5, tel: 071-482-3322) will do anything
from discussing a new planting scheme to a complete redesign.
She loves gardens to look 'old' and has devised ways and means of making
even the newest garden look as if has been blooming for years. She believes
in putting in a few fairly mature shrubs as focal points, mixing them in
with a few annuals, lots of lilies and then a few perennials as well. She
could supply a new planting scheme for a small London garden for between
Pounds 100 and Pounds 150 - anything requiring building work would obviously
cost a good deal more.
London-based landscape designer Randle Siddeley is very used to creating a
garden from scratch - fast. He will do anything from a windowbox to
corporate schemes and everything in between. He has a great deal of
experience of urban gardening and seems to conjure greenery and verdant
pleasures out of the most unpromising sites - like the narrow strip of space
photographed here, for which he was merely asked 'to do something.' As you
can see it looks quite magical - trellis is a speciality of his and he has
used it here to give definition to the space as well as support for the
climbers. The well-planted containers complete the scheme.
For a smallish urban garden he reckons that a sum of between Pounds 5,000
and Pounds 10,000 really would make a difference to the way you use your
garden and the pleasure you get out of it.
'If necessary I can transform a site in a couple of weeks although, of
course, it is nicer to have more time if possible. I did a small show garden
in a new development and that had to be done in just seven days - it is
amazing what can be done. We put some steps in, a brick border and some
turfing as well as some trellis. That cost Pounds 4,500.'
To show just what can be done we looked at his own average-sized L-shaped
London garden, photographed above. It is a perfect example of the sort of
scheme he can do in a very short time and for about the cost of a very
average kitchen. The whole project cost Pounds 8,500 (including building
works, design fees, plants and labour) and was completed within a month.
He and his wife Kiki Mcdonogh, the fashionable London jeweller, bought the
house just a year ago and 'though it had been owned by a keen gardener it
had become an overgrown jungle. It was a complete mess and had raised
planters all the way round, which sadly I personally hate. I wanted a
cottagey garden, enclosed for privacy and comfort and one that would seem
like an extension to one's living area, another room, if you like, where we
could have dinner on a summer evening.
'I used York stone, which I love, and brick margins to define the geometric
shapes. The diamond pattern of the York stone floor is repeated in the
trellis, which I also love.
'I'm also personally very fond of water, so there is a cascade, a water
feature which pumps itself around and bubbles in from underneath and
cascades over a small weir. I like the sound of water and it's particularly
attractive at night. A water feature, of course, adds to the cost. It must
be properly done with good walls, a tank and proper pipe work, but I think
it is well worth it.
'We used mature plants in order to give us instant pleasure. In each area I
have controlled the colour - I love using just white with dark green
foliage, or at the moment there are the evergreen shrubs, underplanted with
red pansies and tulips, and in another area there is a yellow corner with
yellow tulips coming up.
'It took about a month to put the architectural bones of the garden together
and last July we planted it up - we used lots of relatively established
climbers, mainly about 6 ft high when they went in, a mix of roses, clematis
and jasmine as well as shrubs.
'I think most people don't think enough about lighting. A garden should be
used at all times and if you light it properly it is magical at night, too.
I don't believe in floodlights but like to uplight certain parts of the
garden subtly. An uplighter in front of a tree in the winter accentuates the
branches and in the summer highlights the leaves and makes the garden look
bigger.
'For my own garden I used the experts, The Garden Lighting Company, at
Argent Court, Hook Rise South, Tolworth KT6 7LD. Tel: 081-974-2211.
Siddeley Landscapes is at 3 Palmerston Way, Havelock Terrace, London SW8
4AS. Tel: 071-627-4044. Anybody going to the Chelsea Flower Show should look
out for a Mediterranean Garden that he has created for The Sunday Times.
