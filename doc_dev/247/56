<TEXT>   BEST BUY; Go for bloomers; If it's in bloom -- buy it! You will find a vast
selection of bedding annuals and perennials, especially giant pansies, bedding
begonias, impatiens, dianthus, mimulas and nicotiana in six-packs, from $2 to
$2.50. Use an all-purpose fertilizer at planting time and bait for snails.; 
TOP JOB; Mow it down;  Sharpen up the mower before cutting your lawn, because
dull blades will injure the grass, leaving it ragged and brown. Mow high -- 2
1/2 to 3 inches -- to promote healthy roots and reduce the need for water.
Leave clippings on the lawn to recycle nitrogen into the plants.;  PLANT; Dip
into vegetables; Sow or transplant snap beans, beets, carrots, chard, corn,
cucumbers, eggplants, peppers, pumpkins, melons, squash and tomatoes. Plant
radish seeds with cucumbers and squash to deter cucumber beetles and borers.; 
YOUR CHECKLIST;  (box) Pick pansies every day; the more you pick, the more
will bloom.; (box) Continue to pick faded blossoms from narcissus, tulips and
other flowering bulbs, so the seeds don't set and rob bulbs of food for next
year's flowers.; (box) Check for rotting wood and deteriorating metal in
planter boxes. Replace if needed.; (box) Provide netting, wire fencing, a
trellis or some other support for snap peas, sweet peas and other climbing
plants, or they won't produce well.; (box) Start a vegetable-garden record
book. Note planting times and harvest schedule as a guide for next year.  </TEXT>
