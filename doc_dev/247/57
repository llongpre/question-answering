<LEADPARA>  Our roving photographer was loping through The Hague, Netherlands, on Saturday
when he was stopped midgalumph by the sight of a familiar face. Yes, that is
Barbara Bush pouring champagne over a tulip that had just been named for her.
The "Mrs. Barbara Bush Tulip" is the newest hybrid tulip and will be exported,
you gardeners will be glad to hear, to this country. It is bright pink, if
you're coloring this, and is a late bloomer, if you're thinking of planting
it. Looking on as Barbara Bush christens her namesake is Ria Lubber, the wife
of the Dutch prime minister.  </LEADPARA>
