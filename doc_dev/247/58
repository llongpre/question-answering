<TEXT>  BEST BUY; Adding on; With warm temperatures hanging on, this is a good time to
make additions to a worn-out landscape. Look for azaleas, priced from $5 in
one-gallon containers, garden chrysanthemums, priced from $3.50 in one-gallon
containers, and cyclamens, from $6 in six-inch pots. Bait for snails.; TOP
JOB; Plant a lawn; The best time to plant -- or repair -- a lawn is through
the last week in October. Seed will germinate without heavy watering and sod
will bond to the soil quickly. De-thatch and aerate hard-packed turf areas and
apply a fertilizer to carry the lawn through winter.; WATER; Less is best;
Change your irrigation schedule to help plants harden off for winter, but
don't give up on watering altogether. As the weather changes, decrease the
number of times -- but not the length of time -- you water. For instance,
water once every two weeks instead of once a week, but still water for half an
hour each time. This change will provide water to deep roots while allowing
longer periods for the soil to dry between waterings.; CHECKLIST; (box) Rake
leaves and add them to the compost pile. Use some leaves as a mulch in
perennial beds.; (box) Keep planting tulips, daffodils and other bulbs in
humusy, drained soil; add bone meal or super phosphate to help them bloom.;
(box) Plant shrubs and evergreens.; (box) Put in transplants of cold-season
vegetables and annuals.; (box) Sow wildflower seeds, particularly California
poppies.; THE LAST WORD; Master the garden; An information session for people
interested in joining the new master gardeners' program will be held tonight
from 7:30 to 9 p.m. at the University of California Cooperative Extension
office, 2175 The Alameda, San Jose. Farm adviser Nancy Garrison will give a
rundown on the training series that begins in January. Information: (408)
