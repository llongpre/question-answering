   Best known for growing tulips in the
spring, this Dutch town soon may be famous for melting snow in the
winter.
   When the snow begins to fall _ and an average of 100 inches fall
here each winter _ warm water from the city's power plant will be
pumped through a grid of plastic pipes underneath downtown streets
and sidewalks, melting the snow and ice.
   No longer will customers dread looking for parking spots between
huge mounds of shoveled snow or risk slipping on icy patches as
they window shop. Gone will be the days shopkeepers spend more time
behind a shovel than a cash register.
   The project, called ``snowmelt,'' is similar to systems used for
decades in northern Europe and Scandinavian countries.
   But the one being installed under streets and sidewalks along
three downtown blocks here is the largest of its kind in the United
States, according to the system's engineers. It's expected to be
completed in time for the first snowfall.
   Underground systems that use electricity or steam are being used
on a smaller scale, such as in driveways and parking lots of
various U.S. cities, said Pieter Dekker, project director for the
city's Board of Public Works.
   A larger snowmelt system using water is being installed at a
Minneapolis mall to replace an aging underground heating-mat
system, but that won't be completed until 1991.
   ``It's designed so that the snow melts almost instantaneously as
it hits the ground,'' Dekker said. ``In theory, there should never
be an accumulation.''
   When the project was introduced earlier this year, it was met
with skepticism _ especially among downtown shopkeepers displeased
with having to share its $1.1 million pricetag with the city.
   But when local industrialist Edgar Prince, who has a
mini-snowmelt system in his private driveway, agreed to kick in
$250,000 for the project and $25,000 a year toward the annual
$100,000 operating costs, store owners warmed to the idea.
   Holland already had committed itself to a $2 million downtown
beautification project that was going to demolish streets to put in
new brick sidewalks, landscaping and mini-parks as well new utility
and sewer lines.
   The warm water to be used in system is a byproduct of the power
plant, which is less than a mile from downtown and is now dumping
the water in Lake Macatawa.
   The water will wind through the 58 twisted miles of plastic
pipes at a constant temperature of 51 degrees year-round, but may
be turned up during heavy snowfalls.
   Already, officials from other communities are visiting Holland
to find out more about the snowmelt system.
   ``Historically, older downtowns die when shopping malls come in;
the core of the city becomes an eyesore of abandoned buildings,''
said John Hutchinson, former chairman of the city's Mainstreet
Committee. The committee was formed three years ago when the city
was designated a ``Main Street'' community by the National Trust
for Historic Preservation.
   Since then, developers have taken advantage of low-interest
loans to renovate decaying facades of older buildings, instead of
tearing them down to build new ones.
   ``We're determined that Holland, Mich., is not going to follow
that pattern,'' said Hutchinson, an attorney whose wife owns a
downtown children's clothing shop.
   While Holland's attempts to revitalize its downtown and compete
with suburban shopping malls are noteworthy, a strong foundation
already was in place.
   The city's tulip festival draws hundreds of thousands of
visitors each May, its state park beach on Lake Michigan is
considered Michigan's busiest, and Holland's Dutch heritage _
reflected in wooden shoe shops and windmills _ has made it a
popular stop for tourists.
   Most shopkeepers are enthusiastic about the snowmelt system,
even as construction temporarily deters customers.
   But some aren't so sure.
   ``The problem is you won't see the pavement unless you go there.
And the people who don't like to go downtown won't go there in the
middle of winter just because the snow melts,'' said Tim Jenks, a
small-business consultant and former Mainstreet Committee member.
   Still, with proper promotion, its novelty could make it a
success, he said. ``I believe you can bring people downtown with a
snowmelt system or with a three-humped camel. It's all a matter of
how you promote it.''
