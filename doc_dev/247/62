<LEADPARA>  FEW things lift the spirit and fill the senses like flowers.;   The perennial
passions for gardening and livable interiors conspire to give flowers --
blooming or fresh-cut -- renewed focus.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Everyone loves a garden, bursting with color and nature's arrangements, yet
the idea of arranging fresh flowers intimidates many people. Learning to make
visually pleasing flower arrangements simply requires a willingness to
experiment.;   The very term -- flower arrangement -- with its suggestion of
something large, stiff and formal, puts off Cynthia Ryan, a floral designer in
Hartford, Conn. Ryan searched for a word to describe the natural arrangements
of flowers, herbs, branches and woodland materials so popular today, and
settled on "creations.";   The loose, airy, country-style bouquet is popular
again. For the home gardener with a patch of daisies, a few annuals and an
ornamental shrub or two, this is good news.;   Chrysanthemums, which are
easily grown and widely available commercially, are beautiful when combined
with white daisies and boughs from a green shrub such as boxwood or ilex.;  
For the novice arranger uncertain of color combinations, beautiful results can
be achieved by combining different flowers in the same color family.;   Jane
Newdick is an English garden writer with three new books on flower arranging.
In "The Five-Minute Flower Arranger," (Crown Publishers, $16.95), she shows a
simple, elegant display of single blooms arranged in a row of identical,
narrow-stemmed glasses. Alone on a mantelpiece, a modest arrangement like this
has the quality of sculpture.;   A variation on this is a row of tulip-stem
wine glasses containing blooms of white freesia -- an ideal arrangement for a
warm night when all the windows are open and the perfume of the freesia, a
tender perennial with delicate stalks and blossoms, can circulate.;  
Arranging flowers also provides an opportunity to display favorite vases,
jugs, baskets and other containers.  </TEXT>
