FT  24 APR 93 / Gardening: Daphne, bad-tempered but so sweet

SPRING is spreading at various speeds through Britain. In London, lilacs are
out already; in the Cotswolds, primroses have only just reached their peak.
But a reader in Wales has written to point out that she has yet to see
colour in anything, let alone a tulip.
Even on the Welsh steppes, one of my favourite ceremonies will soon be
challenging gardeners. Since January, daphnes have been active; but during
the next month, the best of them remind us why they are plants with which we
should all experiment.
In small gardens, city gardens or adventurous gardens, daphnes have the
quality which plain old ivy cannot command. They also have their
awkwardnesses. Some of them will grow only for experts. Others will grow for
all of us but will die back suddenly in the middle. A few of them are cheap,
and all of them have yellow roots which cannot be moved. They hate
disturbance and they hate invaders. I cannot blame them, but I also cannot
move them or fork round them safely in the hunt for weeds.
The temperamental members of this family have caused others to be
overlooked. This year, I have learned a little more about their signs of bad
temper, but I also wish to begin with varieties which anyone ought to be
able to grow.
My star performer is a daphne which is named after Naples, although it is no
longer to be seen there in its pure state. Neapolitanum will grow easily on
any well-drained soil, but it is becoming rare in the better nurseries and
needs a public campaign in its favour.
It turns into a low, neat evergreen with scented rose-pink flowers and it
never grows more than a 18 in high. It is easy and, potentially, makes neat,
low hedging, especially good in flower beds which back on to walls.
It close relation, daphne Collina, also originates from Naples and can still
be seen growing wild on rough, limestone ground to the south of the city.
Collina is much more common in the trade but it has the family's frequent
vice: bits of it will suddenly die off without reason.
Neapolitanum is a much better buy for a front garden or an evergreen clump
of five or six bushes in a bed of low-growing border plants. I hope that,
eventually, I re-make its reputation.
It is not, however, the oldest form in gardens. My vision of the daphne goes
back 1,000 years, to the Sung dynasty in China and the pleasant story of a
somnolent monk. Beneath a cliff in distant Lu Shan, he is said to have dozed
off in the shade and dreamt he was being encircled by clouds of heavenly
scent.
I have never had scented dreams, but they are not a monastic privilege: we
could all try sleeping on a bed of roses. For, when the monk woke up, he
found bushes of daphne Odora growing in the rocks above him; he was
breathing their unique scent in early spring.
He named them by the Chinese words for Sleeping Scent and bequeathed this
legend to gardeners there. Seven centuries later, we finally caught up with
China's flower culture and became aware of this enchanting shrub.
Odora's season has just finished, and I have been tidying up two bushes of
the golden-leaved form which is hardier and even sweeter. Both suffer from a
problem which did not affect Chinese monasteries: they are riddled with a
virus for which there is no cure.
Experts say the virus is the reason for those daphnes with bare lower stems
or twisted leaves at the tips of their branches. In the trade, quite often,
Odora has become debilitated because the virus is perpetuated by cuttings,
not by new introductions from the wild.
There is not much we can do. The only answer is to check carefully before
buying an Odora and reject anything which might have twisted leaves. Growers
are probably unaware of the problem, but it spoils at least half of the
stock now on sale.
This warning should not deter you, though. It has not deterred me from a new
experiment: the low daphne Mantensiana which is evergreen, sweet-scented,
and willing to cover about 2 ft in height and width. Its main flowers fall
in February and March.
Mantensiana is a post-war invention, bred in Canada from very different
parents, which I have bought and recommend. It is now beginning to circulate
more widely and deserves to make a name; but I fear it will not live forever
because it, too, seems to die in places like the familiar Collina.
Nonetheless, it is worth six or seven years' tolerance.
Perhaps these short prospects are too much for you. If so, do not desert the
family: turn, instead, to one of this post-war daphne's parents. It goes by
one of two names, Burkwoodii or Somerset, but historians and botanists agree
that the two plants have a similar parentage and do not vary.
By now, it is common in garden centres but ought to be much commoner with
customers who want a peaceful reward. Scotts of Merriott, in Somerset, was
one of those to introduce it and the firm's nursery list still remarks,
justly, that one bush of this daphne will scent an entire garden in May.
Admittedly, it is not evergreen, but it will also make a spectacular hedge
of informal, bushy proportions if you allow room for its spread and height
of about 4 ft. I have used it successfully to hedge a grass path leading out
into a less formal area of fruit treees and rough turf. Be sure to allow a
generous width of grass so that the daphnes do not eventually block the way
through.
Single bushes will scent anyone's garden, so try a short walk of Somerset
and watch out for visiting monks on the nap. The scent on this variety is
dreamy and easy for everyone - yet, we still make too little use of it in
those coming weeks when tulips, everywhere, are going over and many of us
are waiting for the main flush of roses instead.
