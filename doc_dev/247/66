<LEADPARA>  IF GARDENS boast an invisible charm, it must be their pleasing scents.
Visitors walking down the garden paths instinctively stoop to sniff a
glamorous bloom, then exclaim enthusiastically about its fragrance or express
disappointment that it has none.;    That's the way it is with garden
fragrance. It can be subtle, even absent at times, and overwhelming on other
occasions. It all depends on what is in bloom, the time of day or the weather.
A hot day or night can bring out fragrance more strongly, while cool weather
tends to de-emphasize it.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     While it is natural to expect a fine bloom to have a fine scent, this is
not always the case. Not all lily varieties or many of the spectacular peonies
or roses are scented.;    However, for those willing to patiently seek out
plants noted for their aromatic virtues, it is possible to fit fragrance into
any seasonal display. Such plants abound among the spring and summer bulbous
species as well as among shrubs, perennials and annuals.;    To enjoy a fully
fragrant garden throughout the growing season, it must be planned and planted
with that purpose in mind. This means selecting varieties that will contribute
their measure of fragrance at different times, from spring until frost.;   
Perhaps the most pervasive fragrance is released by many of the hardy lilies
now dominating many gardens with their blooms. Just a single clump of Auraum
hybrids or Regals will permeate an entire garden with heavenly perfume on a
summer evening.;    Other summer bulbous flowers such as Ismenes, tuberoses,
lycoris and Madonna lilies are delightfully fragrant, as are certain daffodils
and hyacinths in spring. Check varieties carefully if scent is your goal; not
all have it.;    Because of their long season of recurring blooms, roses
chosen especially for their spicy fragrance are often the dominant plant in
the scented garden. Some smell like fresh tea leaves; others have a musky
perfume or emit an apple scent. As with bulbous flowers, some roses have no
fragrance.;    Some of the newer introductions and older varieties that are
noteworthy for their fragrance include Double Delight, Amber Queen, Sweet
Surrender, Tropicana, Fragrant Cloud, Sheer Bliss, Intrigue, Oklahoma and the
Rugosa species of roses.;    Many deciduous flowering shrubs can be relied on
to fill the air with pleasing scents at different times. These include lilacs,
honeysuckle, mock orange, some magnolias and most of the viburnums.;   
Perennials offer a diverse choice of plant forms and colors whose flowers are
distinguished by their scents, as are the summer phlox at this time. Earlier,
most herbaceous peonies and hostas (but not all) do their part. Others are
lily of the valley, monarda or bee balm, and carnations.;    Certain annuals,
such as sweet alyssum, heliotrope, candytuft, nicotiana, sweet pea, stock and
even petunias, have more elusive scents but can make an impression when grown
massed in beds, which is the best way to grow them anyway.;    It should be
noted that pleasing garden scents are not always, or exclusively, associated
with flowers. A planting of herbs can add exotic scents, although some, like
basil, sage and lavender must be pinched, bruised or cut before they give off
a scent. Even the stately pines and other evergreens will contribute a measure
of fragrance at times to enhance the garden scene.;    For those seriously
contemplating a garden with emphasis on fragrance, Stephen Lacey's new book,
"Scents in Your Garden," (Little, Brown, $40) is a timely publication.
Lavishly illustrated, it digs deep into the roots of the idea, with sound
suggestions on how to attain what he calls the "most potent and bewitching
substance in the gardener's repertory."  </TEXT>
