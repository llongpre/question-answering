takes a tyro with millions through the flower show

THIS WEEK, it has been the Chelsea flower show. I was all prepared for a
happy Monday among the plantpersons when the Weekend FT asked if I would
look at the show through the eyes of the very rich, in line with this
weekend's theme.
Fortunately, the paper arranged a ticket for one of its friends among the
recently rich. Gerry Next-Ratner is not yet a famous gardener, but he is a
king of bargain-basement shoppers who has turned his million into three
more. He wants to get into gardening, not least to maintain peace with the
lady in his life, so we met at the Chelsea Hospital entrance.
How could a millionaire resist the main tent on the Monday morning when
nobody else is supposed to be there except the press and their girlfriends?
Gerry certainly liked the tent: so much, in fact, that he interrupted a
group of judges and asked how he could hire it. He said it had the right
scale for the mid-summer frolic that he and his lady were giving near
Newbury on the evening after Wimbledon.
The members of the Floral B committee were surprised by the question. Gerry
was even more surprised by most of the flowers. It was probably a mistake to
start him off in Avenue G, the heartland of this year's civility, among the
soft colours of Four Seasons Nursery and the apparently artless arrangements
of Glebe Cottage.
Bargain-basement millionaires like quick results in quantity, and Gerry
first came alive among the newish Princess lilies which he recognised from
the florist outside his London office. He astonished Peter Smith of
Chanctonbury, in Sussex, by ordering half a borderful at Pounds 5 a plant.
I happened to remark that he would soon be rivalling Elton John, who is one
of the biggest buyers of the show lupins which the two brothers Woodfield
exhibit so handsomely at Chelsea. Gerry made straight for the stand and
ordered enough of the cream-flowered Deborah Woodfield and brick-red
Trooping the Colour to fill the rest of his border in one sweep. He was even
keener when he discovered that the brothers were avid FT followers who were
willing to swap tips as well as seed packets.
I felt I had to suggest that lupins and alstroemerias might look too
riotous. What is so wrong with a riot? Gerry answered. But if you think it
flashy, we can tone it down with a nice bit of foliage.
Not far from the lupins, we found Goldbrook Plants selling juicy hostas at a
size and price which makes a millionaire show off and order 100. When I
suggested that lady gardeners also like flowers with scent, he did a deal on
two dozen of the eleagnus Quicksilver (which Goldbrook had combined cleverly
with the hostas) and then added 20 of Notcutts' dusky lilac Congo because
the colour reminded him of a former girlfriend.
I felt I had to steer him towards David Austin and persuade him to buy up
remaining stocks of the pink-flowered FT Centenary rose because its flowers
are so much bigger than anyone else's. Before temptation flagged, we came to
rest at Blom's tulips. Every year, the Blom stand is bait for millionaires.
In their first year, but perhaps not their second, these highly expensive
tulips are certain to look their best. Gerry majored on the red and white
striped Marilyn, and then announced that he had covered every season except
autumn when he and his lady were, anyway, on Cap d'Antibes. Before I could
say Corydalis flexuoas, millionaire's restlessness had taken over. Gerry had
what he wanted and so the main tent had had it, too.
You remember, perhaps, the famous words of LB Johnson about the relative
merits of men inside the tent and men outside. At Chelsea, millionaires are
outside-the-tent people, not in. Outdoors in the sunlight, everything costs
several hundred times more.
I tried to convince Gerry that the prettiest planting and design was to be
found in this year's garden from the Daily Mirror, complete with its own
reflecting mirror and a scheme of pink, white and pale flowers from a
talented designer named John Plummer. But Gerry is not too keen on the
Mirror's politics, any more than on the new disease of outdoor gardens at
Chelsea for the 1990s. Gardens for children with learning disabilities turn
up among gardens to help the aged or gardens for people with breathing
problems. Gerry thought they were all ridiculously middle class:
horticultural correctness is not his scene.
By the main tent, he was put at ease by a timber-framed glass room with
green-grey paint and a wooden veranda. Every year, Amdega sells its
showpiece; this year, Gerry scooped the conservatory for a mere Pounds
30,000 with VAT, blinds and flooring as extras. On a crest of the wave, he
then made free with the stone garden statuary from Crowthers with planting
by Rosemary Verey.
Gerry's sights had now set themselves high. Down on the embankment, he had
caught the glint of gold in the sunlight, and it was only with great
difficulty that I dissuaded him from ordering an entire truckful of the
gold-coated pebbles and waterfalls crafted by Numoul with the help of
acrylic paint.
Further down the embankment, the competitive spirit re-surfaced. Harpers and
Queen had a huge garden of cliff-like appearance, planted beautifully with
white martagon lilies and some hybrid hellebores, which were stars of the
show. The hellebores came from the great collection of Helen Ballard near
Malvern, but her name meant much less to Gerry than the collection's new
buyer and the exhibit's backer, Lord Rothschild.
Gerry was most impressed that serious money can buy the best: he would have
been even more impressed if the exhibit's rocks had not turned out to be
made of polystyrene tinted to look like boulders. Actually, I thought they
were very clever and that their devisor, Rockscape Ltd, had found a way of
bringing a grotto within everyone's reach.
With a final flourish, Gerry spotted two enormous figures chiselled in solid
stone. What a Rothschild shows in polystyrene, a Next-Ratner orders in
granite: the antique salesperson explained that the figures were two of a
set of six, acquired recently for hard currency from the Lenin museum in
Prague.
Done, said Gerry, at a cool Pounds 29,000 and Pounds 24,000 respectively.
Millions move in a mysterious way; whatever did he want with two monoliths
of the Marxist past? 'Send them to my ex-wife,' he replied. 'She was always
ridiculously left wing until she divorced me and made off with half my
assets.'
Careful questioning of another group of judges convinced him that the
president's lunch was not open to purchase and was by invitation only.
Lovely morning, he commented, but a pity about all those fiddly little
flowers on tables inside the tent. He vanished before I could take him back
to the plantings which really matter.
Myself, I am an inside-the-tent person, but I now see why the Royal
Horticultural Society allows such staggeringly expensive extras to multiply
round the edges of the world's finest flower show. How else can millionaire
non-gardeners make up for the fact that they cannot possibly grow sweet
peas, orchids and old-fashioned roses like the ones that are grown by those
wonderfully human artists inside the tent each year?
