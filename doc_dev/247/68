textbook for gardening makes grandiose claims. Robin Lane Fox finds one good

EVERY SO often, gardeners sneak off to a work of reference. It may be a good
nurseryman's catalogue; it may be an informative issue of Gardening Which?
or the excellent volumes from Reader's Digest, published in the 1970s. In my
case, it is usually an earth-stained title by Arthur Hellyer, of which my
favourite is his small Pocket Guide, published under the aegis of Amateur
Gardening. This year, we have another choice: the Royal Horticultural
Society's Encyclopaedia of Gardening (Pounds 29.95, Dorling Kindersley). The
editor is Christopher Brickell, a director of Royal Horticultural gardens at
Wisley, Surrey. If I say that the many contributors include Hellyer, the
alpinist Jack Elliott, the tireless Roy Cheek and the rosarian Michael
Gibson, you will see that the enterprise is heavily armoured.
The publishers clearly believe that this is a knock-out blow. 'For amateur
and professional alike,' they tell us, it is 'the one and only practical
guide you'll ever need to own . . . all you need to know about every facet
of practical gardening . . .' It is the encyclopaedia to end all
encyclopaedia.
But on the shelves my old and trusted guides are still smiling. The new
encyclopaedia has a wet layer of eco-speak, nouns piled up like adjectives,
gaps, inconsequential bossiness and photographic oddities. In the old days,
Amateur Gardening was a magazine written in good English; societies of
specialist gardeners had members who knew how to use words. Recently, I
nodded with pleasure when the king of our travel writers, Norman Lewis,
recalled that his short list of formative reading included the bulletins of
the Alpine Garden Society. This encyclopaedia is horribly written. Nouns are
strung together like birdscarers on a line of polythene; trees are 'design
elements'; we are not designing gardens or views, but we are 'designing with
bulbs' or 'designing with trees'. One of the main features - which the
editor might call a design consideration - is called Creating The Garden.
Where Genesis was reticent, the RHS jumps in. It tells us to be 'creative',
an idiotic word: heaven help us if we choose the wrong 'cultivar'. After
hard days in the flowerbed, I sometimes picture the Young Cultivar, riding
south in some Border Botanical Ballad with universal pansies knotted in his
locks of chopped bark.
Do readers and gardeners have to flannel around with this awful word,
invented by botanists who had problems about classification? The
encyclopaedia has more than 3,000 photographs and I must say how much I have
enjoyed them. 'High brick wall supports magnificent purple swathe of a
clematis', but the wall is at Sissinghurst, Kent, (unacknowledged) and so I
happen to know that the clematis is the sky blue perle d'Azur and is only
purple because this ultimate encyclopaedia has printed a photograph which is
over-exposed.
'A mature rambler rose in full, glorious bloom', transforms a 'trelliswork
arbour' but I happen to recognise the arbour because it is my eldest
brother's (unacknowledged) and so I know that the rose is actually New Dawn.
When 'designing with trees', we are told to avoid flowering prunus if we
want to underplant it: at the bottom of the page, the photo and caption
applaud an 'informal walkway' of flowering cherries which 'draw attention up
and away from the borders which will in turn fill out and become the centre
of interest as the blossom fades.' What are we to believe: text or
photograph?
Sometimes, neither. We are shown how an upright conifer forms a 'tableau'
beside the blazing red leaves on a tree in late autumn: 'richly coloured
rose blooms' complement the 'golden tones of gravel' I'm glad I did not pose
for the snap showing how to dig with a straight back. Many of the
photographs and almost all the sketches of suggested colour schemes have the
look which appeal to the management at Wisley, but not to the great amateur
gardeners whom history will remember for their artistry. 'To display dwarf
conifers to their best advantage, add heathers to the planting scheme for
bright splashes of year-round colour.'
If this encyclopaedia is all we need, it ought to mention more things which
we need most in the 1990s. Protection in winter is discussed and
illustrated, but there is no mention of Fibre Fleece at this point, although
this water-permeable blanket has changed the game for amateurs. 'Whether it
is a pot, tub or windowbox, any container is a potential focal point in the
garden', but why is there not a word about water-retaining crystals which
have transformed the 'maintenance consideration' of these popular features?
Throughout, there runs a seam of airy bossiness. The section on vegetables
is the best and some (not all) of the basic techniques are clearly
illustrated and described. However, about a fifth of this book is a painful
statement of the obvious, often in the passive voice, leading up to cheery
imperatives which command the self-evident.
'Tulips and daffodils are highly valued for the bold splashes of colour they
bring to the garden in spring.' Or 'containerised trees are long term
features, so use containers that are durable and attractive.' Some
suggestions seem odd. We are invited to plant a honeysuckle up a Clematis
armandii, although honeysuckle will try to throttle it; we are advised to
plant mixed hedges of different species but 'species used must have similar
rates of growth if over-vigorous species are not to dominate.' Why not tell
us which species grow at a similar rate?
I am tempted to quote the ultimate encyclopaedia on cottage gardens, but the
section on Restoring Old Historic Gardens seems more apt for authors or
readers who fear they may need no other book.
'If renovating or restoring an old and historic garden the work will vary
widely . . . as well as surveying the site and assessing the condition of
the main features (see 'Appraising the site' page 15) try to research the
history and development of the garden . . . clearing paths, steps and other
hard elements may also be helpful . . . unusual plants may have survived
such as rhododendron cultivars . . . if trees are diseased or dangerous they
should be removed (see 'Cutting down a tree' page 45) . . . lawns and other
turfed areas may not be beyond restoration. . . .'
To be fair, this modern reference book does omit one valued technique:
shredding the experts. If the creative aspect sections are disbound, waxed
paper can be laid horizontally on bare earth surfaces with fixatives and
will decompose as a mulch alternative to chopped bark (see 'Mulches as Weed
suppressants' page 574). You never know: your cultivars might love it.
