WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The capital is awash in daffodils, masses of tulips proclaim the arrival of 
spring, and Milton Boston already is worrying about planting thousands of 
geraniums, petunias and marigolds for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Boston is chief floral gardener for the National Park Service in downtown 
Washington, the generalissimo with rake and hoe who oversees the yearlong 
planting of 170 flower beds from the Capitol to the Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
186,150 Tulips Planted 
</P>
<P>
His job might seem staggering to back-yard putterers. For a month in late fall, 
the efficient, unflappable Boston and his crew of eight gardeners were busy 
planting 186,150 tulips, 108,300 daffodils and 22,000 pansies, all of which 
bloom in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Those flowers are removed by early May. The soil is tilled, fumigated with weed 
and pest killers, conditioned with perlite and peat moss and planted with 
bright, hardy annuals for Washington's hot summer months. They are weeded and 
fertilized until they die in the first frost. Then, they are replaced with 
about 3,000 chrysanthemums. Eventually, the beds are cleared and the cycle 
starts again in November. 
</P>
<P>
Boston, a 26-year Park Service veteran, is especially proud of the "tulip 
library," a broad, looping cluster of 95 small beds of the clarions of spring 
that lies near the Tidal Basin south of the Washington Monument. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
95 Different Varieties 
</P>
<P>
This elaborate garden contains 15,000 tulips, most of them imported from 
Holland. Each of the 95 beds contains a different variety, with names as 
dazzling as their colors -- Queen of Night, Merry Widow, Apeldoorn, Oriental 
Splendor, Smiling Queen, Flaming Parrot, Estella Rijnveld. 
</P>
<P>
It is so impressive that it won an admiring tribute from the Dutch Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Boston says that he gets "great satisfaction" from his work, which delights the 
more than 23 million tourists who visit Washington's national parks and 
monuments each year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is always what I wanted to do," said Boston, 45, who grew up on his 
father's farm in eastern North Carolina and migrated to Washington after high 
school. "All my life, I've been used to growing things." 
</P>
<P>
His annual $330,000 budget includes the cost of plants and bulbs purchased 
wholesale from growers, many from neighboring Maryland and Virginia, on the 
basis of competitive bids. 
</P>
<P>
During plantings, Boston's crew begins work at 6 a.m. and can leave a flower 
bed blazing with color before the morning rush hour is over. 
</P>
<P>
"They really work hard and do a good job," Boston said of his eight Park 
Service helpers. "They're all gardeners, and they know what they're doing. They 
can plant 20,000 bulbs in one day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flowers Seldom Stolen 
</P>
<P>
In a city beset by violent crime, Boston is pleased that his flowers are almost 
never stolen, except by an occasional panhandler intent on selling them for 
spare change. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess people enjoy them so they don't take them," he said. "About the only 
problem is when people stand in the beds to pose for pictures and mash the 
flowers down." 
</P>
<P>
Boston said he once had "the best-looking yard in the neighborhood" in suburban 
Capitol Heights, Md., where he lives with his wife and two children, "but, in 
this job, I don't have the time anymore to take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
His loss is Washington's gain.
