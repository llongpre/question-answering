   You bought that Easter lily plant (or the tulips, hyacinths,
tiger lilies, oriental star gazers or sans souci lilies) for the
holiday. Now what?
   Design your own Easter floral arrangement, advises Heffernan
Morgan, a Chicago floral design firm. Get rid of the pots they came
in and rearrange multiple bulbs and soil in shallow containers such
as baking dishes, woven baskets, ramekins, or anything else that
suits your fancy. Cluster Easter fruits and eggs around the plants,
nestled atop green Spanish or reindeer moss. Finish with raffia,
twine or birch branches.
   Once the holiday is over, the firm says, you can bring the bulbs
back to life for another season. Remove the dead flowers, then let
the foliage shrivel and remove it. Store the bulbs in a cool, dark,
dry area. You can then replant them in your garden in the fall
before the first frost, or plant them indoors in pots, beginning to
water them in February.
