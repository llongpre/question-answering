   What is a good houseplant for an office where the air may be dry
in winter and the light isn't great?
   Try a Chinese evergreen (aglaonema commutatum), which tolerates
dry air and temperatures ranging from 85 degrees to 60 degrees or
lower and does well in low light. Water this plant when the soil
surface feels dry to keep the roots moist but not drenched.

   Your houseplant ferns turn brown and dry. What's the problem?
   Ferns often are challenging to grow in the house because they
usually prefer cool temperatures (a maximum of about 72 degrees in
the daytime), indirect light, moist soil and humid air.
   Browning and drying of frond tips and yellowing and drooping of
interior leaves usually mean that the air is too dry. Place ferns in
an area of the house that is naturally more humid, such as the
kitchen, bathroom or laundry room. Or place plants in trays of wet
gravel and use a room humidifier to add moisture to the air. The
humidifier may help your comfort, too.

   Vegetable spaghetti can be used the same way as the pasta. It's a
hard-shelled squash with spaghetti-like pulp.
   Grow it like any other garden squash, harvesting it when the
shell is hard. To prepare, scoop out the pulp and cook in boiling
water, or boil the squash whole first and scoop it out after. Serve
with your favorite spaghetti sauce.

   Intelligent neglect is what cactus plants need in winter. Cacti
are essentially dormant then and susceptible to overwatering. Keep
them in a cool area _ 40-45 degrees _ and water monthly. Don't feed
them, either. Watering and fertilizing them may make them rot.

   If houseplants on windowsills develop black blotches on leaves
and some become droopy, it could be cold injury. Many of these
plants originated in the tropics and can easily be damaged easily by
low or freezing temperatures.
   Leaves that touch cold window glass in winter may freeze and turn
black, especially if closed drapes or blinds deprive the plant of
heated air in the room.
   A remedy is to increase light levels for plants by grouping them
under fluorescent lamps rather than crowding them against cold
windows.

   If your garden is shady, try growing leafy crops such as lettuce
and other salad greens. They will grow in partial shade, with two or
three hours of sun daily, less than the six to eight hours needed by
other vegetables. Also try endive, spinach, parsley and tarragon.

   Remove and discard diseased plants and plant parts through spring
and summer. Check tulips, peonies, gladiolus and iris especially.
Destroy tulip leaves when they die. Start proper fungicide spray at
the first sign of disease.

   If your garden is very small, stake tomato plants. Remove the
suckers, which grow in the angle made by the leaf stem and the main
stem, and tie the plants to tall stakes as they grow. Tie weekly for
best support.

   Want to make some gourmet herb vinegar? Organic Gardening
magazine says it's easy with white or cider vinegar and fresh-picked
garden herbs.
   Thyme, basil, marjoram, tarragon, rosemary, fennel, chervil, dill
or mint are good choices.
   Put about a cup of fresh herbs, chopped coarsely, and two or
three cups of vinegar in a clear jar or bottle. Cap the jar and set
on a sunny windowsill for about two weeks to let flavors mellow.
Then strain the vinegar into a clean jar and insert a fresh herb
stalk for easy identification and an attractive appearance.

   Cynoglossum, also known as Chinese forget-me-not, is an annual
that will reproduce itself in any corner of the yard or garden if
the seeds are not removed. If you don't want to weed it out in the
spring, cut back the bloom stalks before the seeds ripen.
   Impatiens (also called sultana) is not winter hardy, but you can
pot it and take it indoors before frost. It makes a nice house plant
but requires a sunny place indoors for blooming.

   Cut sprays of parsley and sage and spread them on a piece of
paper over a wire rack. Set the rack in a shaded, airy place, and in
about 10 days the sprays will dry. Then strip the leaves from the
stem, crumple them until they are fine, and store in a glass jar for
use as seasoning during winter months.

   If your family enjoys greens, plant Swiss chard. It's a heavy
producer, and both leaves and stalks can be used. You can cook the
green leaves as you would spinach or use them as salad greens. The
stripped stalks can be cooked alone like celery.

   Parsley is easier to start indoors in a plant starter because
seeds take three weeks or so to sprout.
