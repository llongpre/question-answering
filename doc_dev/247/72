QUESTION: I'm growing orchids in my home and notice scale insects on the 
leaves. Is there a safe control for these? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You can buy some Safer's Soap in your garden center and apply it 
according to label directions. Or you can mix a teaspoon of liquid dish washing 
detergent to 1 quart of water. Add 1 cup of rubbing alcohol and wash the leaves 
with the mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Use either a sponge or a soft toothbrush. The secret is to dislodge the 
insects. Periodic washing of foliage does a great job preventing infestation.

Ideal Dwarf Squash for Mideast Cooking 
</P>
<P>
Q: We don't have a large back yard for vegetables, but would like to grow some 
dwarf summer squash, used in Mideast cooking. Is that possible? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, anyone interested in Lebanese or Middle Eastern cooking should grow a 
summer squash known as cousa or Lebanese zucchini, ideal for stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
This variety produces heavy yields of zucchini 3 to 5 inches long -- greenish 
white fruits on compact, bushy plants. 
</P>
<P>
For just a few cents you can buy a packet of cousa squash and have enough to 
supply you all summer. You can grow the vines in a container or on a trellis, 
as well as in the ground.

Fruiting Plants That Thrive Under Lights 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there any fruiting plant in the form of either a dwarf tree or shrub that 
can be grown reasonably well in a living room under fluorescent light? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are several species of citrus that can be grown indoors if given 
sufficient artificial light. Calamondin (a cross between kumquat and sour 
mandarin orange), limequat, orangequat and kumquat itself, are good choices. 
</P>
<P>
You may want to ask for catalogues from suppliers of dwarf citrus.

Trying to Find Plant That Repels Gophers 
</P>
<P>
Q: A friend told me there is a plant that repels moles and gophers. I have had 
critters in my garden and would like to try it. She cannot remember the name, 
but I thought you might have heard of it. 
</P>
<P>
A: Probably the plant you are referring to is caper spruge or Euphorbia 
lathyrus. A source for seeds is J.L. Hudson Co., Box 1058, Redwood City, Calif. 
94064. It has an irritating sap in the roots and this is believed to be the 
clue to its repellent qualities. 
</P>

Name That Flower That Bloomed Long 
</P>
<P>
Q: I cannot remember the name of a long-lasting cut flower that I grew in my 
garden last summer. It opened like a rosebud, changed to tulip-shaped blooms 
and finally opened fully like a poppy. Blooms came in blue, purple, pink or 
white with silvery green foliage. The label was something like "estomia" but I 
cannot find it in catalogues nor can garden store clerks help. 
</P>
<P>
A: You had a plant listed either as eustoma or lisianthus which was developed 
from wild prairie gentian. Initially, botanists listed it under Eustoma 
russellainum and also Lisianthus russelainus, so you may find it under either 
first name. As cut flowers, they can last as long as two weeks, or more.
