Fox asks if the riot of blooms in his garden is just a glorious illusion

SEVERAL YEARS ago, I spent a long, hot summer examining the cream of
Oxford's young intelligences with the help of two extremely respected
philosophers. We sweated and agonised; we tried to turn Bs into As;
meanwhile, outside the pseudo-Gothic windows, sunlight fell in patterns on
those hallmarks of academic gardening, an immaculate sward of lawn and beds
of modern roses with vermilion flowers.
When at last we finished, I asked the philosophers the plain man's question:
of all the dozens of questions which you have set, which was the hardest to
answer? After six weeks' hard labour, they agreed with hardly a pause. The
question: how can we be sure we are not dreaming?
How not, O Socrates? I gave the plain man's response: that our non-dream
world is more orderly and most of its events are effects of more or less
obvious causes, even when people kick over the traces, fall in love, or lend
far too much money to Olympia &amp; York. No, they corrected me, we might be
dreaming orderly dreams, not just those dreams of tea with the royal family,
which are supposed to be an English favourite, but dreams here and now of
reading the FT.
I have been haunted by this awful question. It surfaces in becalmed
committee meetings, or during breakdowns on the London Underground, or when
Britain's city councils start competing for the best in bloom. This week, it
has returned with unanswerable force: am I living in accelerated time while
a film of summer is being run too fast before my eyes? Gardens have been
dreamy but the sequence has gone mad. Is it May, June, or time for
Wimbledon, and why is everything happening here at once?
There has never been a year like this, not in my horticultural memory, which
goes back to 1956. Ten days ago, there were tulips and the buttercups were
mildly premature; wallflowers were drawing to an early close; and narcissi
were reassuring non-gardeners that they could grow something pretty to round
off spring.
In a rush, in a bound, summer has been rampant. Showers of roses have
started to open before the lilacs have begun to fade; the dianthus of late
June are showing colour. On May 20 I woke up, or re-entered dreamland, and
found pale yellow day lilies in flower; sweet philadelphus became impatient
and on the bank holiday joined them.
Not until the last fortnight in June do I usually turn to the best of all
pink roses, the old-fashioned Fantin Latour. Already, it is open, with
spring's Blue-eyed Mary still out beneath it.
Day by day, the sequence has become crazier, cramming six weeks into one
with ominous warnings of a future climate change. Green observers have
warned that we will know when the world starts to warm and we have punctured
the atmosphere because the bluebell woods in Britain will be the first
casualties, hating the new warmth. They have not gone, this year, but they
have gone into fast-forward, flowering two weeks earlier than usual.
After the first primeval sleep, so the poet Keats tells us, Adam awoke and
found truth. On bank holiday, Lane Fox was dreaming and awoke to find it
mid-summer. Portland roses seemed to be tumbling beside delphiniums; the
lavender buds are showing a purple colour beside the greengage iris
graminea, which is fighting for its usual place in the button-hole during
the final week of May.
Is it, perhaps, a personalised dream, and has something simply gone wrong
with me? Here, great philosophers are helpful: private worlds, they tell us,
cannot be communicated in language. Worried that I might be trapped in a
private net, I have been cross-communicating and verifying sensations. Are
you, too, seeing rivers of laburnum among rose Mme Alfred Carriere, and
scenting orange blossom as the flowers fade on Solomon's Seal? If it is all
a dream, it seems to be a public epidemic in which dandelions have remained
a nightmare and there is always the harsh reality of mowing the grass twice
weekly. Perhaps it looked this way in Paradise, but the garden owner then
stopped the film. He froze it, perhaps, in just such a rush when the first
fresh greens of the year were present.
Does this sudden hint of Paradise matter in 1992? Sleep-walking, I am
telling myself that I must absorb it at every moment, economise on work, see
it all before the season has disappeared in seven days. It is so
extraordinary that perhaps it can be forgiven; meanwhile, I am sowing a
fresh round of annuals for late summer, tall white tobacco plants and the
new white cosmos daisy called Sonata.
Sweet dreams are fine but, when we come down to earth in mid-June, there
will have to be some young plants coming on to carry us into October.
Unless, that is, the Heavenly Director changes the score once more and sends
a frost on Derby day to remind us we are British. There would be nothing
better to wake us from this philosophic dreaminess than a short, sharp
shock.
