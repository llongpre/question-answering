One of the most distinctive of bulbs is native mostly to California, the 
Mariposa tulip, Calochortus. Looking somewhat like a small tulip, but much more 
wildly marked (some contain every color imaginable including splotches of red, 
purple, yellow and brown) and often fringed or covered with hairs, these bulbs 
have fascinated gardeners at various times, especially earlier in the century 
when they were promoted by nurseryman Carl Purdy.

With many now endangered in the wild, and with a new interest in drought 
resistant plantings that often use natives, there is also a renewed interest in 
the calochortus and a small society has been formed. Their newsletter, 
naturally named "Mariposa," is just starting up and subscriptions will costs $2 
a year for four issues. Write to Mariposa, 260 Alden Road, Hayward, Calif.
