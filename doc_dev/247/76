<LEADPARA>  SOME time ago, a reader graciously shared a packet of old newspaper clippings
with me, gardening articles from the '60s "too good to throw away.";   To me,
horticulture always seems a rapidly changing field. Thirty-year-old garden
columns prove that isn't always so.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There were some predictable giggles, of course. Like potted amaryllis bulbs
for $1.49 and 2-inch caliper sugar maples for $10 (silver maples half that).
But many of the "new" cultivars and gardening techniques have been around for
generations.;   As research at universities and agricultural stations across
the country disproves or sheds light on long accepted practices, horticultural
methods do gradually change, however.;   Take tree paint, for example. Thirty
years ago gardeners were cautioned to protect tree wounds and pruning cuts
with tar-based tree paints or shellac. But customs die hard, and even though
we've known for two decades that tree wound dressings can do more harm than
good, many people still paint.;   Experts explain that tree paints keep wounds
from drying out, incubating tree-rotting fungi instead of excluding them.
Research has shown trees themselves have mechanisms for encapsulating invasive
fungi. Tree paints actually slow the process, making it more difficult for
trees to heal themselves.;   As a result of studies performed by the Dutch
bulb industry, guidelines for spring-blooming bulbs have evolved over the past
30 years. Not to imply that previous methods were wrong, only that we're
learning more about growing them better.;   One writer in one of the weathered
clippings, adamant about ripening bulb foliage till the bitter end, chided:
"Don't tamper with the foliage of daffodils, tulips and other spring bulbs.
Don't you dare cut (the leaves) off or tie them in obscene little bunches.";  
Correct to a point. But we are told now that this essential revitalization
process culminates in just five weeks, not the eight to 10 it takes for leaves
to die back. (To my knowledge, there have been no studies yet about the
effects of tying foliage in "obscene little bunches.");   Also, old
recommendations were to feed bulbs right after blooming with fertilizer high
in phosphorus. Not so. Bulbs prefer a balanced fertilizer (nitrogen encourages
general vigor and larger bulbs) before blooming and again in the summer or
fall.;   Obviously, horticulturists 30 years ago never anticipated the
severity of Dutch elm disease or the near demise of this native. Gardeners who
followed columnists' well-intentioned advice three decades ago ("add our old
standby, the American elm, to your list of desirable shade trees") have lost
their elms or are struggling, at great expense, to keep valuable specimens
alive.;   Here are a few other updates of interest:;   (check) Old
recommendation: Use sand to amend clay soil.;   New: Unless sand can replace
at least one-third to one-half the total volume of amended earth, don't use
it. A little sand mixed with a lot of clay equals "cement." Amend soil with
organic matter instead.;   (check) Old recommendation: Feed rhododendrons and
azaleas twice a year.;   New: Providing soil is properly amended, feed
rhododendrons and azaleas seldom, if at all; certainly no more often than
every two years.;   (check) Old recommendation: Keep lawn free of grass
clippings.;   New: Bagging grass clippings is viewed today as wasteful and
unnecessary. Recycled clippings return essential nutrients to turf, reducing
the need for lawn fertilizers. Lawn mower manufacturers are taking advantage
of the trend by introducing mulching mowers. One caveat: When recycling
clippings, mow frequently so that one-third or less of each grass blade is
removed at a time.;   (check) Old recommendation: Use a punch bar to make
holes for tree fertilizer.;   New: Remove plugs with soil augurs (punch bars
compact clay soil).;   By far the most significant revelations have come in
the realm of pest control. Recommendations for DDT, Aldrin, Dieldrin,
Actidione, Lindane, and Chlordane (yikes!) were prodigious, one author
ranting: "This foolishness of looking for 'safe' insecticides is absolutely
ridiculous!";   Thirty years ago, fungicides were "essential" for turf
diseases and readers were admonished to "lay in a supply of fungicide," then
use it as a dust over the crowns of all perennials. Obviously, pesticide laws
were much more lax. No longer can we spray twig blight of pine with "any good
fungicide." Only a couple are labeled for that purpose.;   And can you imagine
the repercussions if the following appeared in print today: "Florida has had
billbug problems for years and has come out with a recommendation for Baygon
as a control. So far Baygon has not been cleared for use in the Midwest except
as a control for house flies. You take it from there.";   I can only hope that
writers and gardeners will never again flaunt such wanton disregard for potent
chemicals. Reading through those old columns got me to wondering if any of
mine will be saved for 30 years. And what will they sound like in 2021 if they
are?  </TEXT>
