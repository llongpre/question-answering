<HEAD>Too Many Pesticides Used in Tulip Growing</HEAD>

   Tulip growers are flooding local
waterways in this flower-growing region with pesticides, including
such banned substances as DDT, to protect their crops, water
officials said Friday.
   ``All kinds of pesticides were found in surface waters in the
bulb growing area, and their levels were far above the norms in
most cases,'' said Hans van der Hoek, a spokesman for the local
water management board.
   ``In samples, we've even found long-banned substances such as
DDT, aldrin, and dieldrin,'' Van der Hoek told The Associated Press.
   All three are highly toxic substances, but Van der Hoek said it
had not been determined if the pesticide levels in the water were a
threat to public health.
   One-fifth of the Netherlands' 39,500-acre bulb-growing area lies
just north of this western Dutch city. The remainder is spread over
the northwestern and central Netherlands.
   Van der Hoek said that the water management board had launched a
joint study with the bulb growers on how to tackle the problem.
   A spokesman for the Dutch Agriculture Ministry said that ``we're
aware of the problem and working hard to get rid of it.''
