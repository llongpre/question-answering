ROSES ARE at their peak, lavender has purpled, and the scent of philadelphus
is enough to make any gardener lose his or her head. In a June such as this,
to give flower lovers any more pleasure could be risky. Even so, it would be
a pity to deny yourself Pick of the Bunch, an exhibition of Dutch, Flemish,
and French flower paintings from the 17th to early 19th centuries. It is at
John Mitchell Son, 160, New Bond Street, London W1 (071-493-7567) and closes
July 15.
The 'bunch' is the magnificent collection of flower-paintings, the largest
in the world, owned by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. Pick of the
Bunch is a chance to display some 50 flower paintings and also flower
miniatures, many made as lids for snuff-boxes etc.
The Fitzwilliam owes its wealth of flower paintings to a Norfolk gentleman
with a passion for flowers. In the 1930s, Major Henry Broughton, later 2nd
Lord Fairhaven, created a legendary water-garden beside the Broads. He also
began to collect, starting in the 1930s with bird paintings and then
switching to flowers. Broughton's gift of 37 paintings transformed the
Fitzwilliam's own small but rather fine collection of flower pictures. On
his death in 1973, the museum received a further 83 oil paintings, no less
than 1500 flower drawings, and a quantity of miniatures.
With such a huge collection, a fair number of the paintings in Pick of the
Bunch are being seen in public for the first time in decades. It includes
many of the great names in the development of flower painting, beginning
with Breughel. 'Flowers in a Clay Vase' by Jan 'Velvet' Breughel is
described by Peter Mitchell, who selected the exhibition, as the most
important flower painting in Britain. It is a lovely thing, dozens of blooms
massed tightly together and yet depicted with such lightness of touch that
the bouquet seems to tremble with life.
As ever, Brueghel's is not a naturalistic bouquet; primroses, poppies, and
roses never normally nod to one other. However, in the infancy of flower
painting, artists were licensed to turn the seasons upside down in order to
record prized specimens for their patrons. Another unnaturalness is
Breughel's iris, a fabulous bloom of blue-white stippled with black, twice
the size of anything else in the arrangement. Did its owner love it more
than anything else in his garden? Diamond and pearl jewels lie at the foot
of the vase. Perhaps the message of the painting was that flowers like the
iris were no less valuable than the goldsmith's creation.
Multiple meanings lie hidden in paintings by such well-known names as Willem
van Aelst, Daniel Seghers, Jean Michel Picart, and Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer.
In a typically dark and eerie painting by Otto Marseus van Shriek, a bouquet
of roses, carnations, and alchemillas has attracted not just a cloud of
butterflies but also a lizard and a snake.
Bugs and beetles nibble away at many bouquets, a traditional reference to
the gnawing tooth of time but also testimony to 17th-century humanists'
delight in the bewildering variety of God's creation. They coexist most
beautifully in a masterpiece by Jan de Heem, a Dutchman of the generation
after Breughel who settled in Antwerp.
This painting, the largest in the exhibition, is a splendid rediscovery.
Years ago, the De Heem used to hang in the public galleries until the day
when it was pronounced to be merely 'school of' De Heem. Down the painting
went to the reserves, to be rediscovered only when the exhibition was being
selected. It has been newly cleaned by the Hamilton Kerr Institute, and
found to be in exceptionally good condition.
Anyone who thinks flower paintings are dull should study this De Heem. For
one thing, it has an exceptionally energetic quality which comes partly from
the eye-catching diagonal tulips and from the twisting flower-heads and
ragged, curling leaves. Every passage is a miracle of technical skill. A
greenhopper, straddling the stone ledge and a blackberry leaf, contrasts
with the velvet butterfly. A poppy-leaf, tinged with pink, has just the
right touch of flabbiness and sprinkled with perfect raindrops.
If I were able to take any of these pictures home, it might be Adriaen
Coorte's bundle of asparagus, given to the Fitzwilliam by the painter, Sir
Frank Brangwyn. Sisterly feelings might tempt me to ask for either painting
by two women flower painters much admired in their own time and now Vallayer
Coster and Rachel Ruysch. There is a third woman, the almost unknown
19th-century painter, Melanie de Chomolera, on this showing a faithful
rehasher of the 18th-century manner.
But the painting I covet above all is by Boilly (1761-1845), whose still
lives are exceedingly rare. This painting is all softness and not a little
sensuality, too, and yet with a tinge of Romantic gloom. The light is
concentrated on a superb group of roses, in bud and full bloom, their full,
white petals enfolding a deep pink vortex. A dead sparrow lies on the ledge,
its soft grey feathers finding an echo in the funebral shade of the lilac
and purple-red poppy.

Early flower-painters - Cornelis de Heem and Bosschaert the Elder - also
hang in the exhibition of Dutch and Flemish Old Masters at Noortman, 40, Old
Bond Street (until July 16). It includes still lives by De Heems, father and
son, two Hobbema landscapes, and 'A Flirtation' by Wouverman which formerly
belonged to Earl Mountbatten.
The two most remarkable paintings are Pieter De Hooch's 'Courtyard of a
House in Delft' and Gerard Dou's 'A Painter in his Studio', a fascinating
contrast with the painting which was its source, the young Rembrandt's
famous painting, exhibited in the recent National Gallery exhibition. A grey
parasol which hangs on the studio wall was not used to shade the artist
(Rembrandt himself, it has been claimed) from Leiden's summer heat, but to
keep off the dust as his pictures dried.
