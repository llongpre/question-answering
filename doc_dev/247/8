   First, the flowering bulbs, along with forsythia, cherry and
spirea. Then the azaleas. The dogwoods and redbuds are likely to
blossom for a month and tie in the bloom of the tulips with that of
the azaleas.
   That's the fragrant picture promoted by William Alexander,
landscape manager at Biltmore Estate in Asheville, N.C., where the
``Festival of Flowers'' takes place April 14 through May 13.
   Biltmore House, a turn-of-the-century 250-room French
Renaissance chateau amid the Blue Ridge Mountains, will be
surrounded by 50,000 Dutch tulips, hundreds of varieties of azaleas
and native dogwoods, he says.
   Wines produced at the Biltmore Estate Winery will be featured
during the festival. Adult admission to the estate, which ranges
from $14 to $18.95 for daytime visitors, $21 to $25 for evening
hours during the summer, includes a tour and wine tasting.

   You need mulch? North Carolina's Mecklenburg County is giving it
away.
   Since October, workers have been grinding 140 tons of mulch a
day from limbs and trees felled by Hurricane Hugo.
   ``Come and get it,'' says Bill Warren, county operations
supervisor for recycling. ``We're grinding more than we can give
away.''
   For gardeners, the woody pulp is ideal for landscaping. It keeps
moisture in and weeds out. As the mulch decays, it enriches the
soil.
   The county once charged $15 a pickup load. But until all Hugo
debris is ground up, the stuff is free for the taking.
   After four months, the county had ground up only one-fifth of
Hugo's debris. The task probably will continue through autumn, says
Fred Remington, division manager of recycling. Mulch will then go
back on sale as part of the county's recycling program.
