Tulip growers are flooding local waterways in this flower-growing region with 
pesticides, including such banned substances as DDT, to protect their crops, 
water officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"All kinds of pesticides were found in surface waters in the bulb-growing area, 
and their levels were far above the norms in most cases," said Hans van der 
Hoek, a spokesman for the local water management board. 
</P>
<P>
"In samples, we've even found long-banned substances such as DDT, aldrin, and 
dieldrin," Van der Hoek said. 
</P>
<P>
All three are highly toxic substances, but Van der Hoek said it had not been 
determined if the pesticide levels in the water were a threat to public health. 
</P>
<P>
One-fifth of the Netherlands' 39,500-acre bulb-growing area lies just north of 
this western Dutch city. The remainder is spread over the northwestern and 
central Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Van der Hoek said that the water management board had launched a joint study 
with the bulb growers on how to tackle the problem.
