THE CULTURE OF FLOWERS by Jack Goody Cambridge Pounds 40, 480 pages
AFRICANS DO not grow flowers, do not give flowers. This one observation was
the seed of Jack Goody's book, The Culture of Flowers. Goody is a social
anthropologist famous for studies of literacy and marriage in different
societies. In his retirement, the former Professor of Social Anthropology at
Cambridge University has turned, not to growing roses, but to analysing why
people have ever grown roses.
This is a wide-ranging and readable book, although somewhat repetitive.
Goody compares the different meanings attached to flowers across cultures,
starting with the Garden of Eden (not, it would appear, a flower-garden) and
the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and ending with present day. Are Africans
uniquely unappreciative of flowers? What did it mean to 'say it with
flowers' in ancient Egypt or 17th century Holland, and what does it mean
today in India, Russia or China?
Certain subjects, such as the Dutch tulip craze, will already be familiar to
many. But many will be fresh, for Goody gathers an extraordinary mass of
facts - about burial customs, the Chinese New Year, Jesuit theology, the
recent Indian custom of garlanding politicians, and shifts in the symbolic
meaning of individual flowers.
Throughout history, humans have given flowers to their gods. The gift takes
many forms, from the towering temple-offerings of the Balinese to the
English parish flower-rota. Perfume comes from the Latin per fumum, because
people of the ancient world used the smoke of burning petals to waft their
prayers to the nostrils of their gods. The Roman soldiers made Christ a
crown of thorns in mockery of the chaplets adorning their cult idols.
Few flowers bloomed in the gardens of the Pharaohs, whereas Egypt under the
Romans became a paradise for floriculture. (On the whole, this book lacks
the savour which would come from referring to primary sources. However, in a
splendid papyrus we find an Egyptian grower proudly recording the despatch
of 1,000 roses and 4,000 narcissi to be worn as garlands at the wedding of a
Roman dignitary's children.)
The Jews, it seems, share with Africans the distinction of being an unfloral
people. They do not decorate synagogues with flowers and mark graves only by
stones. It seems that only three kinds of flower are mentioned in the Bible,
by which I take Goody to mean the crocus, the Rose of Sharon and the so far
unidentified 'lilies of the field'.
The God of the Jews had no truck with pagan garlands, and neither did Allah.
But although Islam rejected the use of real flowers in worship, images of
flowers were permissible, as we see from the carpets and exquisite tiles of
Ottoman mosques. Islamic art and literature is drenched in the scent of
flowers. Delightful flower-baskets were carved on the gravestones of Ottoman
ladies.
Goody believes that only societies with a reasonably complex economy are
flower-minded. Hence one reason why Africa is unfloral, although its people
also express a moral and spiritual dislike for sacrificing fruit for the
sake of flowers. From this perspective, picking flowers is frivolous, let
alone covering coffins with floral wreaths. In the funeral announcement 'No
Flowers Please', Goody detects the kind of anti-floral puritanism which has
been bad news for flower-sellers in such very different societies.
He traces the impact of two hard frosts of Puritanism in western Europe,
when the goddess Flora was driven out. The first frost to wither the flowers
came with the establishment of Christianity, the second at the Reformation.
However, this is all rather fuzzy, not least since Goody himself admits that
eminent 4th century Christians urged congregations to deck the tombs of
martyrs with flowers. Floriculture on the grand Roman model no doubt did
perish during the barbarian invasions, but I for one am loth to take it on
trust that it was only in the 12th century Renaissance that Flora tiptoed
back into people's lives.
One brief passage suggests what, to my mind, this book lacks: the vivid,
sharp-focus description of communities which one would expect of an
anthropologist. It concerns a French village where it was the custom when
someone died for the villagers to pick all the flowers from that person's
garden. Man's life is as the flower of the field. Surely all cultures, even
in Africa, have seen in flowers the transience of life and beauty? The
Culture of Flowers swamps one with detail and it becomes easy to lose the
thread, yet it succeeds in being a richly stimulating account of a wonderful
subject.
