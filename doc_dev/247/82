   Bush or pole beans will continue to bear until frost if you keep
the bushes picked and don't pull the plants. Leave the plants in
place to promote another crop.

   Keep African violet leaves from drooping over the rim of the pot
by making a collar-type affair out of a decorative paper plate with
the center cut out. Slip it over the pot rim to keep the foilage
fresh and give the plant a ``nosegay'' look.

   Onion sets _ tiny onions _ may be planted as soon as the ground
dries a bit in early spring. Just poke the sets into the ground
with your finger, and soon you'll have green onions for table use.

   African violets like bright, reflected light all day or full
morning sun two to five hours a day. As winter days grow shorter,
move your violets to a brighter location. If you can't, add
artificial light _ cool white fluorescent lights no further than 18
inches away from the plant work well. You also may find some
special plant-growing incandescent spotlights to mimic natural
light to help your violets bloom.

   Some flowering plants need help to extend their lives. Cyclamen,
hydrangea, azalea, cineraria and calceolaria (also known as
pocketbook plant) will bloom longer if you turn the light up and
the heat down. These plants prefer bright window spots and
temperatures of 60-65 degrees. Chrysanthemums do well in more
moderate temperatures _ up to 75 degrees during the day.

   You can make potted plants reflower outdoors (but not very well
inside) with patience. Plants like tulips, hyacinths, narcissus and
crocus are forced to bloom out of season in controlled conditions
at the greenhouse, so to bloom again they need a rest period and
natural outdoor environments. To reflower, first remove the faded
blooms and keep the plants in a cool, bright place until the
foliage matures and dries out. Then plant the bulbs outdoors when
the danger of frost is past, two or three times deeper than the
bulbs' diameters. They should bloom in a year or two during the
normal spring season.

   Mealybugs, those tiny cottony white-pink crawling and sucking
insects that invade leaf stems and crevices of houseplants, spread
rapidly. Isolate affected plants and wash them with warm, soapy
water, then rinse with clear water. Or dab the bugs with an
alcohol-soaked swab, or use a commercial insecticide containing
malathion.

   Too much fertilizer on house plants is worse than too little. It
can burn the roots of troubled plants. Fertilizer salts can build
up and form crusty white residues, which can harm plants. Be sure
to follow dosages recommended on fertilizer packages. Slow-growing
plants need less than fast-growing ones, and all types will grow
faster in spring and summer when they get more light from longer
days. If salts accumulate, leach them out of the soil by watering
heavily, allowing excess water and residue to drain off.

   How often should you water your plants? As often as they need
it. Most houseplants need water when soil feels dry to the touch.
You also can judge by the weight of the pot; a light pot means the
soil is dry. Or insert a probe; if soil clings to it when you pull
it out, that means the bottom soil is moist. You also can tap the
plant; a hollow sound means dry soil. When watering, do it
thoroughly, but be sure to allow for drainage and empty the saucers
of excess water. Avoid overwatering, as it damages roots and causes
yellowing and loss of lower leaves. Check with the florist or
garden center where you bought the plant for recommended watering
schedules.

   Can you grow vegetables in shade? While most need six to eight
hours of sun every day, some leafy crops such as lettuce and other
salad greens will grow in partial shade with two to three hours of
sun daily. Also try endive, spinach, Swiss chard, parsley,
tarragon, catnip and mint.

   Growing asparagus takes a little patience, with root
establishment taking more than a month and three years needed for
harvest maturity. Start by planting crowns and spreading roots in a
trench 6 to 8 inches deep, covering with about 3 to 4 inches of
soil to start. Fill in with more soil as the shoots grow. When
mature, you can harvest freely for about six to eight weeks,
cutting off spears at the soil surface level. Then let the stalks
grow to make food for plant roots.

   Rhubarb can be harvested when plants are two years old or more.
Pick outer stalks for about eight weeks and remove any flower
stalks that may appear. Don't eat any part of the rhubarb leaf.

   If you'd like to grow vegetable hydroponically (in water), try
lettuce, bush beans, cucumbers, herbs, leaf lettuce and other leafy
greens. Your county extension service may be able to suggest other
types that will thrive in your area.

   Spring is a good time to repot indoor plants. If roots are
showing on the pot bottoms, it means the pot is full of roots and
needs more room. Move the plant to a pot one size larger. First
knock out the root ball on a newspaper, place it in the larger pot
prepared with drainage material, then sift in loose potting soil
around the root ball. Firm down as you fill the pot, but don't
cover the root ball any deeper than it was previously. Water well.
Place the plant in a low-light area for a few days, then return it
to its regular window spot. Don't feed it for several weeks.

   Tomatoes may develop cracks as summer rolls on, especially after
heavy rain or watering after a dry spell. That's because the tissue
takes up water greedily and expands faster than the skin. These
tomatoes are more likely to rot on the vine. To prevent cracking,
keep the plants mulched and water regularly.

   Black spot, a common disease of rose bushes, first appears as
small black spots on lower leaves of the plant. The leaves will
turn yellow and drop off the plant. To discourage spreading, water
around the base of the plant, not wetting the leaves.

   Pepper plants are sensitive to temperature. Buds may fall off
when temperatures fall below 60 degrees or rise above 70 degrees.
This is temporary, and fruit will usually form after the weather
stabilizes.

   If you live near the shore, you know that seawater can set back
many crops. But Organic Gardening Magazine reports that it can
improve tomato flavor without sacrificing much of the yield. In
past experiments with seawater, plants fed with varying dilutions
of seawater in all seasons developed sweeter but smaller and fewer
tomatoes. But the Journal of the American Society for Horticultural
Science reports that Israeli scientists have found that timing is
all-important. They irrigated trial plants with salty water only
after fruits had formed. The tomatoes were better quality, with
higher sugar concentration than those raised on plain water.
