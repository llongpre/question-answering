<LEADPARA>  WHEN this day of hearts and flowers rolls around, I always worry I'm sending
the wrong flower message to my sweet babboo.;    What if my posies' secret
meaning is "go stick your head in the compost pile" instead of "my heart beats
wildly for you"?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This flower language business is as complicated as Third Year Latin. Tibi
gratias agimus quod nihil fumas and all that stuff.;    Red roses mean love,
so that's safe enough. But consider these messages when you pick your flowers
today for your special valentine:;    Blue violets "speak" of faithfulness,
red and blue flowers combined symbolize unity, red tulips stand for a
declaration of love, white stocks proclaim lasting beauty, daffodils send
regards, and azaleas mean "true to the end.";    Some of the messages are
pretty stinky. Lavender warns of distrust, yellow carnations speak of disdain,
foxglove of insincerity and marigolds of jealousy.;    According to a recently
published Gallup Poll, floral love notes are the first choice among "I love
you" gifts. Exactly half the people surveyed say they go for flowers when
their hearts beat pitter patter. Jewelry is second at 28 percent.;    Maybe
I'm out of step, but my heart beats for chocolate.; (hbox);    Speaking of
chocolate, horticulturists have discovered a mint plant that smells so much
like chocolate mint that it has been named "Chocolate Mint." The aroma is
reportedly identical to the Girl Scouts' Thin Mint cookies.;    The plants are
low growing and compact with dark green, spear-shaped leaves. The leaf veins
and stems are a rich chocolate color with a distinct chocolate mint aroma.
It's drought tolerant and does equally well indoors as a houseplant or
outdoors as an ornamental.;    One plant in a 2 1/2-inch pot costs $6.95, and
is available from Cedaridge Farm, 53 Iron Bridge Road, Pipersville, Pa.
18947.; (hbox);    If you can't sew your own flag, why not grow one? Clyde
Robin Seed Co. is offering gardeners the chance to do just that with Patriot's
Dream, a seed mix of red, white and blue wildflowers.;    Nine different
varieties of wildflower seeds offer a spectacular if not abstract version of
Old Glory. The seeds will begin to bloom within 45 days. Wildflowers require
little water and reseed themselves year after year.;    Patriot's Dream sells
for $9.95 and is available at garden centers and nurseries, or directly from
Clyde Robin Seed Co., P.O. Box 2366, Castro Valley 94646; (800) 647-6475.;
(hbox);    Another way to show the flag comes from Pat's Mini-Pack Labels in
Watsonville. Normally involved in making the rigid vinyl plastic garden labels
used in plant pots, the company has created an American flag decal with the
slogan: Support our troops.;    "The decal is non-political and should not be
construed as controversial," says Patricia C. Mahoney-Russo, the company's
owner. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of these decals will be donated
to the non-profit organization Operation Yellow Ribbon, she says.;    The
peel-back decals are $1.50 each with a minimum order of two. Send a
self-addressed, stamped envelop to Pat's Mini-Pack Labels, 785 White Road,
Watsonville 95076.;    (hbox);    Hardesty Associates Landscape Architects in
Palo Alto has received the first place Honor Award for the xeriscape design of
the Alameda County Water District demonstration garden in Fremont. The award
was presented at the recent Northern California Xeriscape Conference in
Sacramento.;    The demonstration garden is based on Hardesty Associates'
Dryway Landscape Design System for drought-sensitive land planning. The Dryway
design models are part of a system for drought-tolerant, attractive,
self-perpetuating landscape solutions, the company says.;    The Alameda
County Water District demonstration garden is open to the public year round
and offers a free booklet on drought-tolerant plant species; call (415)
659-1970 for a copy.;    Hardesty Associates offers a free brochure on the
Dryway system; call (415) 326-4268.  </TEXT>
