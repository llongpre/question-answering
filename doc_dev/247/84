THE GNAT IS OLDER THAN MAN: GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE HUMAN AGENDA by
Christopher D Stone Princeton University Press Pounds 14.99 234 pages
ENVIRONMENTAL commentary lurches unsteadily between unrelieved doomsdaying
and wide-eyed evangelism.
Christopher Stone draws you into a much more subtle and invigorating world,
with a layer-cake of problems to which answers - if there be any - are
rarely straightforward. Since that is how we humans fashion our agendas as
we go about our daily businesses, there is a lot to be said for it.
'Some cultures regard the earth and life upon it as relatively insignificant
in comparison with eternal Paradise; others regard all of Nature (of which
homo sapiens are just another ingredient) as sacred; still others are
relatively homocentric. Some nations value whales in the oceans; others, on
their plates.'
So how should we today provide for tomorrow? 'Many of today's controversial
actions, such as the storage of nuclear wastes and the elimination of
wilderness areas, involve a shifting of risks on to the unborn. We cannot be
sure what the remote effects of our actions will be, particularly in the
light of the technology that will be available to our distant progeny. Will
they really care that the oceans are whaleless?'
For Stone, the best way to negotiate these thickets of criss-crossing
interests is to look for common ground in what are still common areas - in
the seas and in the upper atmosphere, where claims of national sovereignty
fray and fade.
Even here, in these Global Commons, the problems are not easily gripped.
'The scale of waste that travels the state-to-commons pathway is gargantuan.
Together, the nations of the world pump over 7 billion tons of carbon into
the atmosphere annually, together with 255 million tons of nitrous oxides
and sulphur dioxide, and 770,000 tons of CFCs. Similarly, 85 to 90 per cent
of ocean pollution originates on land - sewage sludge, industrial wastes,
and, every year, a swelling flotilla of non-biodegradable trash - plastic
bottles, soft-drink containers and the like.'
Moreover, the seas are proving more resistant to remedial action than the
upper atmosphere. As Stone notes ruefully: 'The real stumbling block is
simply practical economics. The fact that so much waste is involved - and
growing - and so many hardpressed industries and nations are implicated,
means that until public protest reaches a shriller pitch, little will
change.'
Stone gives economic prescriptions their due, but stresses that there are no
easy 'polluter pays' shortcuts. Consider the Dutch tulip. Chloride salts,
largely from German up-river fertiliser production, come downstream at 1,200
tons an hour, to the evident ill-health of the tulip. But, hold on. 'A
German might ask, do the Dutch have more right to raise tulips than the
Germans have to raise grain? Are the Dutch to be awarded the upper hand
morally simply because they are saddled with the lower bank geographically?'
Agreed, the way the river flows, the potash happens to be in the ordinary
sense 'the cause' of the trouble.
On the other hand, if the downstream Dutch would only grow some crop less
sensitive to salt than tulips, the harm would be less. Why isn't the Dutch
decision to grow tulips equally 'the cause'? Or should it turn on
priorities: Was Germany salting the river before Holland was planting bulbs?
Stone is Crocker Professor of Law at the University of Southern California.
His earlier book, Should Trees Have Standing? Towards Legal Rights For
Natural Objects, is rightly regarded as an environmental classic. Here he
points to the inevitability of negotiation as the only way forward, and then
more negotiation.
He asserts that a treaty mechanism, where attainable, is preferable to the
law-suit. The lawyers run up big bills, and can take forever and a day;
treaties are less threatening and can sometimes put you ahead of the game,
even if only on a partial basis.
'A treaty is clearly the easier to conclude, the fewer the number of nations
whose cooperation is required to make it effective. Several early
conventions regarding outer space, the moon, and celestial bodies were
hammered out successfully because negotiations began when their effects were
still distant in space and time, before potential vetoing constituencies had
an opportunity to form.'
Stone's special attention to the oceans leads him to suggest a system of
'Guardians' drawn from existing international agencies or relevant NGOs, who
would be threaded through the legal framework to speak up for particular
parts of the common environment when threatened.
He argues cogently for a Global Commons Trust Fund, some dedicated monies to
underwrite internationally significant efforts. 'No single nation can afford
to keep on full-time alert a staff trained and equipped to contain oil
spills with oil-eating bacteria, etc. No single nation anticipates enough
incidents to warrant the expense. But a force with global responsibilities,
financed out of the fund, might well be justified.'
Throughout, Stone emphasises that sound achievement is best built on modest
ambitions. But as the book unfolds he is inevitably drawn back to the wider
picture, and to the narrowness of current legal theory - ie not much since
John Rawls's Theory of Justice, and indeed not much in that. 'The entire
subject of international justice, which I believe will be the great
philosophical issue of the 1990s, Rawls touched upon in 1971 only indirectly
in less than three pages - too obscurely to raise to his indexer's
attention.' A pointer here, perhaps, to Stone's next book.
Stone is writing here for laymen - among whom most businessmen should
properly be counted - and legislators as well as lawyers. Worrying away at
the intricacies of our environmental predicament, he sharpens interest in a
topic that is always prone to compassion fatigue. In Stone's hands, worrying
about the planet, or reading about worrying about it, is much more fun than
you had perhaps anticipated. For that reason, as well as the prudent
self-interest of any alert citizen-cum-businessman, the Gnat deserves a long
life.
The title? From the Talmud, in dedicatory tribute to the author's father, IF
Stone, and to 'the literary tradition from which he came.' Here's how the
passage ends: 'Man's late appearance on earth is to convey an admonition of
humility. Let him beware of being proud, lest he invite the retort than the
gnat is older than he.'
