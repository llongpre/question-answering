ANN CONWAY: A FLOWERED PATH INTO WEDDED LIFE

Picture it: a lily-and-rose blanketed gazebo perched on a grassy cliff 
overlooking a pounding turquoise sea. 
</P>
<P>
Now, picture trumpeters in black tie proclaiming the arrival of a bride so 
majestically turned out that wedding guests suck in their breaths. Her white 
lace gown glitters with a gold beaded bodice. Her bouquet -- a waterfall of 
bridal white roses, lilies of the valley and Casablanca lilies -- sparkles with 
more gold beads. 
</P>
<P>
As she inches toward the gazebo, her Cinderella pumps never touch the lawn. 
Why? Because, along with gussying up the Ritz-Carlton gazebo and gold-flecking 
her bouquet, a florist has stripped 1,000 white roses of their petals to create 
a path upon which Peggy O'Neil-Milhous will sweep into wedded life with Charles 
Rohrer. 
</P>
<P>
Sound like something out of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"? Perhaps. But 
it's business-as-usual for Paul Ecke. His Black Iris in Laguna Beach is Orange 
County's hottest hothouse. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, Ecke created the floral arrangements that graced the oval table 
upon which four U.S. Presidents did lunch at the Nixon library. When President 
Bush, Ronald Reagan, Gerald R. Ford, and Richard M. Nixon and their wives sank 
their teeth into Dover sole with lemon butter sauce, they did so beside three 
Ecke bouquets: first, the centerpiece, a spray of yellow roses -- a favorite of 
Pat Nixon's -- interspersed with Sterling Silver roses, Queen Anne's lace and 
freesia; and then, two smaller satellite bouquets, floral bookends for the main 
masterpiece. Ecke also did the library's entry bouquet. And, he provided the 
white orchids that glamorized the facility's four guest bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Also last week, Ecke created the birthday bouquet sent to Harriet Nelson by her 
son, David. It was a spring basket loaded with flowers -- lilies, roses, 
tulips, freesias -- and one perfect gardenia, he says. "David's bouquets to his 
mother always include one gardenia." 
</P>
<P>
Ecke also dreams up arrangements for Laguna Beach resident Bette Midler. "She 
likes them stylized, but not too far out," Ecke says. Ditto O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Taylor likes them romantic. Ecke did arrangements for La Liz when she 
vacationed last year at the Ritz-Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are developer-clients like Donald Bren, Donald Koll, David Stein, 
Barry Brief, and Jim and Al Baldwin. And, on occasion, William Lyon. Ecke has 
also done the popular Orangewood Ball for Kathryn Thompson. Not to mention the 
Christmas wreaths that Nixon sends to his good friends, developer Donald 
Bendetti and his wife, Dorothy. 
</P>
<P>
Or the posies that regularly spruce up the waterfront manse of Western Digital 
chairman Roger Johnson and his wife, Janice. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the Dallas mega-millionaire whose name Ecke doesn't want to see 
in print. (The prominent Texan's daughter will marry in Orange County this 
fall. Rumors are flying that the Bushes may attend.) 
</P>
<P>
In a monetary way, things haven't always come up roses for Ecke, a high-energy 
guy who disarms you with his Colgate smile. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, he was an art director for schools in the Irvine and Anaheim areas. He 
loved his job. But there were those "summers off," as he calls them. 
</P>
<P>
He needed odd jobs to make ends meet. "I did some abstract painting," he says. 
"But it wasn't enough." When a fellow faculty member asked him to create 
something special, decorate a table for a party at one of the schools -- "Come 
on, you're an artist -- you do great bulletin boards!" he told Ecke -- Ecke 
decided to give it a try. And he ended up doing several more. "I created a look 
women liked. Then I began doing parties, weddings, benefits. Things really took 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Ecke's floral "look" came at a time when hostesses and brides were getting 
burned out on traditional arrangements, he says. "They were tired of the same 
old carnations, roses and mums." So he gave them drama -- exotic concoctions 
using ginger, anthurium, orchids and angular foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Ecke specializes in the tropical and the traditional. For the recent 
Milhous-Rohrer nuptials, Ecke not only flooded the gazebo with flowers and 
topiary trees, he surrounded the towering wedding cake -- embellished with 
edible 24-karat gold -- with 14 marbleized pillars topped with explosions of 
white blooms. He also provided the white liquid-silk coverlets that camouflaged 
every ballroom and garden chair. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion's centerpieces stood atop three-foot acrylic pedestals. "The 
magnitude of the flowers for that wedding just blew my mind," Ecke says. (Ecke 
used a grammar school room to accommodate the blooms he ordered for Peggy 
Milhous. His shop wasn't big enough.) "It was absolutely the most elegant 
wedding I have ever seen," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For Orange County's ultimate power lunch Thursday at the Nixon library, the 
trick was to have the roses opened "just enough" when the Presidents sat down 
to dine, Ecke says. "We made the arrangement on Tuesday to get it to the 
library on Wednesday because security was so tight we couldn't go into the 
library on Thursday," he says, catching his breath. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the flowers out of the cooler for eight hours to start them opening. 
Then we put them back to stop them from opening. At the library, they were kept 
in an air-conditioned room until lunch so they would be absolutely perfect." 
</P>
<P>
They were. Now that's flower power.
