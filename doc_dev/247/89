   Lady Bird Johnson breezed into a Georgetown
townhouse and realized her black patent leather pumps were still in
the car.
   ``You want to see what old ladies wear?'' the wife of former
President Lyndon B. Johnson asked in her Southern drawl Wednesday
as a coterie of journalists, gossip columnists and society mavens
gathered around.
   The 75-year-old Texan, who once worried about being shy and
insecure as first lady, pulled her coat aside to reveal a pair of
sturdy walking shoes.
   Later, armed with a new coat of lipstick and the proper shoes,
Lady Bird was ready to talk to the women who had covered her years
in the White House and who had recounted in dispatches for their
newspapers what she wore and where she had been.
   Wednesday's story, however, was of her love affair with the
Texas bluebonnet and the Indian paintbrush, the pink evening
primrose and the Mexican hat.
   Nature, she said, ``has been my sustenance, pleasure, my joy.''
   She told of coming back from overseas trips when her husband was
president, inspired to cloak Washington in daffodils, tulips and
azaleas. She spoke of returning to Texas after he left office and
turning a weed and debris-choked riverfront in Austin into a
riverwalk where blooming trees now make the perfect backdrop for
wedding portraits and family pictures.
   And she talked of helping nurture the National Wildflower
Research Center.
   ``I pushed and shoved, encouraged and aided and did everything I
could,'' she said of the center in Austin, where she spends time
away from the LBJ ranch in Stonewall.
   ``A lot of you might think this is a lightweight proposition in
a world of heavyweight questions, but we're going to live, I feel,
and I just think it gives joy to live in a more beautiful world.''
   The nation is now thanking Mrs. Johnson for her efforts to
beautify the countryside from Jackson Hole, Wyo., to Cape Cod,
Mass., and to paint it in native flowers.
   In what is being called ``A Jubilee Celebration'' marking the
year of her 75th birthday, Mrs. Johnson will be given a
Congressional Gold Medal at a White House ceremony, and honored
with receptions, a concert and black-tie dinner April 28-30 in
Washington.
   Dorothy Pierce McSweeny, a native of San Antonio who with her
husband came to Washington to work in the Johnson administration in
the 1960s, said the celebration is timed to coincide with
Washington at its most beautiful _ the time of year when cherry
blossoms float in the air like clouds, and tulips and daffodils
decorate traffic circles and public places.
   ``It best reflects all her contributions to the city,'' Mrs.
McSweeny said at Wednesday's coffee to promote the jubilee
activities. ``It's the time of year that shows it off the most.''
   Mrs. Johnson took advantage of her position at center stage to
promote the center and a book she co-wrote with horticulturalist
Carlton B. Lees. ``Wildflowers Across America'' will be published
in May by Abbeville Press and part of the proceeds will go to the
wildflower center.
   Created in December 1982 with a donation from Mrs. Johnson of 60
acres east of Austin and $125,000, the center is devoted to
researching wildflowers and educating about their use.
   It serves as an information clearinghouse and is experimenting
with wildflowers and native plants to determine how to incorporate
them into landscapes.
   ``Mrs. Johnson says it's a lightweight proposition,'' said Bob
Mann, vice president of communications for the American Trucking
Association, who is coordinating publicity on the jubilee
celebration. ``Thank God someone in this troubled world is thinking
about beauty.''
