<LEADPARA>  THINK of spring and envision daffodils. And tulips. Crocuses and hyacinths.
Snowdrops. All the colorful, fragrant and reliable flowers that bloom from
bulbs planted in fall.;   Nothing appeals to me more than spending a golden
autumn day, down on my dirty knees, trowel in hand, with bags and bags of
bulbs to plant.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Four months later, on one of those sparkling, blue-sky, late-winter days,
I'll be out there poking around to see if the first green tips are rising.;  
Spring's bulbs are available in garden centers, and this is a great time to
shop for them, especially if you have particular colors or varieties in mind.
But you have plenty of time to plant them through the long autumn.;  
Selecting colors and varieties is a personal thing. Some gardeners want
intense fragrance, so they concentrate on hyacinths; others go for the elegant
beauty of tulips or the cozy appeal of daffodils.;   But sinking all your
money into one kind of bulb will give you a short bloom season. Spring bulbs
mix beautifully and an assortment will stretch the season from late winter to
late spring.;   All bulbs, however, require excellent drainage. The only
failure I've ever had came from planting tulips in soil that stayed soggy.;  
To improve drainage before planting, loosen the soil of tulip beds by adding
enough organic matter such as peat moss, compost or composted bark to make the
soil at least one-third organic.;   And to encourage good growth of the roots,
prepare the soil at least 12 inches deep. Set the larger bulbs such as tulips,
daffodils and hyacinths at least 6 inches deep, the little bulbs 2 to 3 inches
deep.;   If you are planting bulbs, mix a 10-10-10 fertilizer into the soil.
If the bulbs are planted, sprinkle it onto the surface of the bulb bed. In
late winter, when the green tips poke out of the ground, fertilize again.;  
Or, cut the feedings from two to one with a slow-release fertilizer such as
Bulb Booster or bone meal, applied in the fall at the rate of four pounds per
100 square feet.  </TEXT>
