weekend, and visitors are invited to admire more than 500 named varieties of

open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. through May 5. Free. Information: (408)
971-0444.; BEST BUY; Fast replacements; This is a good time to replace plants
lost in the December freeze. Among the bargain buys are agapanthus in 1-gallon
containers from $3.50, hydrangeas in 1-gallon containers from $4, citrus in
5-gallon containers from $14, and hibiscus in 1-gallon containers from $3.;
TOP JOB; Plant everything; Don't hold back. Plant trees, ground covers and
shrubs. Sow or transplant vegetables, annuals, perennials and herbs.
Transplant early-maturing beans, cucumbers, eggplants, peppers, squash and
tomatoes that will tolerate cooler soil temperatures. Plant summer-blooming
bulbs and corms including caladiums, calla and canna lilies, dahlias and day
lilies. Teaching plant roots to grow deeply for water will lessen irrigation
needs during the summer. Make sure irrigation drip lines, soaker hoses,
sprinklers and trenches are in place before roots systems get to large. Bait
for snails; they're out in force.; LANDSCAPE; Edible flowers; Add some edible
flowers for foliage and bloom. Nasturtium leaves and flowers taste peppery.
Squash blossoms have a cucumbery flavor. Sprinkle a few marigold flower petals
for flavor to soup and salad. Be sure to harvest only flowers and foliage that
haven't been sprayed with a pesticide not registered for food.; YOUR
CHECKLIST;  Prune freeze-damaged wood once the plant or tree has completely
leafed out so you can see just what wood is dead. If in doubt, wait another
month.; (box) Start thinning excess fruit set on trees and vines.; (box)
Divide and transplant clumps of ornamental grasses.; (box) Prune ground covers
such as ice plant and ivy to clear dead portions and stimulate new growth.  </TEXT>
