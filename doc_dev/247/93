<CAPTION>  Drawing; Drawing: (stamp with tulip)  </CAPTION>
<LEADPARA>  TULIP  lovers will enjoy the first new stamp in the U. S. Postal Service's
1991 stamp program. Representing the new first-class 29 cents rate is the "F
-- Flower" stamp, featuring a red tulip on a yellow background. It's the sixth
in the series of stamps printed with letters instead of prices, because the
printing had to start before the official rate was known. The rate increase
takes effect Feb. 3.  </LEADPARA>
