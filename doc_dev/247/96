<TEXT>     Livermore artist Lord is gaining a national reputation for the confident
color and design of her florals. Aptos artist Drew paints oversize flowers on
silk, using dyes and resist techniques. Davis, of Alpine, Texas, is a
ceramicist whose work reflects the colors of southwest Texas.;    Lord's
carefully designed paintings, not for sale, are borrowed for this exhibition
from Northern California collectors. Sunlight and shadow play through the
gardens (often her own) and woodlands that Lord paints. Brilliantly colored
tulips, sunflowers and iris grow in soil that is dense-packed with ground
cover, violas, squiggly tan bark. These flowers have roots that are nourished
from the center of the earth.;    In contrast, Drew's begonias float in on
waves or clouds. Her orchids seem bathed in the light of an unseen solarium.; 
  Interior edges of petals and leaves are created with lines of gutta, a
substance with the consistency of rubber cement, which resists the dye color.
When it is removed, the white silk lines remain. Some of the mounted silk
paintings, such as the gold and orange nasturtiums, have the effect of
intensely colored shapes of stained glass set in clear panes. Drew created
posters for the Capitola Begonia Festival in 1988 and 1989.;    Davis' pottery
provides an earthy counterpoint to the painters' sharply defined work. Hand
shaped from slabs of clay, the pots are decorated with bas relief cactus and
orchids in subtle sunset colors. Shadows emerge both from color gradations and
from play of light on three-dimensional forms.;    The Olive Hyde Art Guild
will sponsor a free presentation by Lord beginning at 1:30 p.m. Saturday in
the Mission Room at the gallery.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Olive Hyde, a free,
city-owned gallery, at 123 Washington Blvd., Fremont, is open from 12:30 to 5
p.m. Wednesday through Sunday, with additional hours from 6 to 8:30 p.m.
Thursday. For information, call (415) 791-4357.  </TEXT>
