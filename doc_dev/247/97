<LEADPARA>  IF ONLY SANTA REALLY DID show up with gifts for your loved ones -- imagine how
merry and carefree Christmas would be. Alas, in the real world, the
responsibility of picking out just the right things for just the right person
rests on the shoulders of everyone over the age of, say, 8 or so.;   One of
the easiest and most successful strategies for gift-giving involves
capitalizing on the recipient's special interest. Following are just a few
suggestions to get the creative gift-selection juices flowing before you begin
wrestling with the wrapping paper.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  Watch it;   One of the hottest new entries into the watch market this fall
hails from Anne Klein. Their new water-resistant Signature Sports Watch, which
sells for $150, is a big hit with women looking for a combination of function
and finery. Available in stainless steel and gold-plated accents or in
all-over gold plating, the watch is available at area Macy's stores.; Keep on
baking;   Pizza stones are the haute gift for foodies. They allow you to bake
frozen or homemade pizza with a crisp crust that won't stick to its cooking
surface, and are good looking enough to be set out on the table. Some run as
much as $70, but Crate &amp; Barrel has an inexpensive sandstone clay model. It
measures 12 1/2 inches in diameter (big enough to bake a large pizza) and can
be used to bake cookies, croissants and other items. Best of all it is
microwave-safe as well as conventional oven-safe. It sells for $16.95. Crate &amp;
Barrel, Valley Fair Mall, San Jose, 243-7500; Stanford Shopping Center, Palo
Alto, (415) 321-7800.; Essence of easy;   Sidestep the commercial blitzkreig
of celebrity scents; present your special someone with an off-the-beaten path
scent for far less green than you'd shell out for White Diamonds, etc. At Bath
&amp; Body Works -- recently opened in Vallco Fashion Park on Wolfe Road in
Cupertino, adjacent to the Limited Express -- entire fragrance baskets can be
had for the price of a quarter ounce of commercial perfume. One of the shop
chain's most popular essences is freesia, a floral note. The two-ounce sample
sizes of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, shower gel, body cream and body
splash all sell for just $2.50 each. Add a dozen bubble bath pearls (4 for $1)
and a jar of milk bath for $3.50 and your grand total is under $20. For an
additional $3, the shop will wrap the loot in a beautiful basket with straw,
cellophane overwrap and a pretty ribbon. Even wrapped, the gift costs far less
than one-quarter ounce of commercial perfume and is far more original. Bath
and Body Works, Vallco Fashion Park, Cupertino, 446-1163.; Take a hot bath;  
Other luxuries for the bath may be found at Caswell-Massey in Stonestown. They
stock essential oils for skin care and aromatherapy, bath bags for steeping
water, similar to the way a cup of tea is made. They even stock a bath
thermometer (102 degrees is optimal, says Caswell-Massey "bathologist" Joyce
Bresa). Also available are bath pillows, eye mask packs (which can be chilled
or warmed), foot and nail brushes, perfume bottles, atomizers and potpourri
holders. Prices range from $5 to $50. Caswell-Massey, Stonestown Shopping
Center, San Francisco, (415) 681-1606.; High-IQ suspenders;   Help him work
smarter with a pair of suspenders emblazoned with Albert Einstein, the face
that launched a thousand brilliant ideas. The black-and-white silk braces
feature black lizard tabs and are made by Cole Haan. They sell for $100 at
area Saks Fifth Avenue stores.; Electronic indulgence;   If your favorite
electronics buff doesn't have a CD yet, this is the year for indulgence. The
Phillips CDI (compact disk interactive) allows viewers to become a part of
on-screen action. The system features a special CD and video player (sorry, it
won't play laser disks or tapes but does play three-inch and five-inch compact
disks). It comes with two interactive games. There is the Palm Springs Open,
which allows the viewer to instigate golf swings while sports commentators
critique form and play. The sophisticated computer-generated picture imagery
is incredibly lifelike. The other game, called Golden Oldies, allows viewers
to select tunes from an on-screen jukebox image. Once the tune is selected, a
music video from the '50s and '60s (translation: film clips from historic
concerts) is played. The system sells for just under $800 at the Good Guys,
5353 Almaden Expressway, San Jose, 970-6664; 3149 Stevens Creek Blvd., Santa
Clara, 554-9700; 1247 W. El Camino Real, Sunnyvale, (415) 962-0101.; Dig this;
  Looking for 100 ways to show you care this holiday season? Consider a gift
of 100 flower bulbs, individually wrapped in a white willow hamper. You'll get
an impressive array of presidential blooms -- General Eisenhower tulips and
President Kennedy tulips -- as well as crocus, hyacinths, daffodils and
anemonies. Planting instructions are included. It sells for $25 via the
Gardener's Eden catalog. (800) 822-9600.; Breakfast of Environmentalists;  
Wheaties may be the breakfast of champions, but wouldn't you rather eat what
health-conscious guests nibble at Robert Redford's Sundance resort in Utah?
The granola contains oats, bran, unsweetened coconut, cinnamon, pecans,
walnuts, nutmeg and sesame seeds. The four-pound tin sells for $27.50, and
makes a nutritious Christmas breakfast before the real feast begins. It is
available through the Sundance Catalog. All purchases support programs for the
preservation of the environment and the arts. Sundance Catalog, (800)
422-2770.; Faux pets, no mess;   Awaken nurturing tendencies in your child
this Christmas with the Pet Vet. This kit for kids includes all the supplies a
child needs to look after a stuffed dog or cat: a scale, grooming brush,
bandages, faux medication, stethoscope, thermometer, syringe, gloves,
prescription bottles, gauze, cotton balls, clipboard, swabs, eyedroppers,
office signs and forms. The kit sells for $29.95 through the Toys To Grow On
catalog, (800) 874-4242.; Guilt-free comfort;   At last, luxury can be
preserved along with the environment. Do the right thing this holiday season
when shopping for at-home attire by picking up a plush robe for him or for
her. Made entirely of unbleached, dye-free Egyptian cotton terry pile, this
robe is even softer than bright or white counterparts. The robe features a
generous shawl collar, long sleeves and two patch pockets. Made in England,
the machine-washable warmer runs $120 and is available through the Chambers
catalog, (800) 334-9790.  </TEXT>
