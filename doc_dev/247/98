<TEXT>     The two-story gray house, with its white picket gate and old-fashioned
wicker furniture on the huge front porch, is one of four craftsman-style
houses in a row on Orange Avenue. The craftsman movement grew at the turn of
the last century as a rebellion against the Victorian age's swirls and pomp.; 
 "It's a love affair with wood and nature," said Irene Grenier of the 1908
home she and her husband bought seven years ago. The interior of the home is
notable for generous use of pine and fir, wooden beams, leaded glass windows,
and huge armoires and couches dominated by straight, simple lines.;   But
Grenier has gone far beyond turning her home into a craftsman museum.;   With
the exception of one room devoted exclusively to the earthy-colored textiles
and strict lines of the era, the rest of the house is a tribute to the years
1900 to 1940, with a few odd Victorian pieces sprinkled about. But rather than
being a mish-mash of styles, the home is a glorious and carefully designed
step into another era -- what many visitors tell Grenier is like a step into
Grandmother's house.;   Through books, research and following her own taste,
Grenier, 45 and the mother of a 5-year-old, has created both the interior and
exterior designs.;   "In decorating, I try to avoid getting too cute, too
pretty, having things too perfectly matched," Grenier said. "That's why I like
to mix styles and pieces. Just a gut feeling tells me if the mix is good or
not.";   A wall-to-wall Persian-style rug runs throughout the first floor and
up to the second, and the original brass dining-room chandelier now
illuminates the living room.;   An antique wooden firescreen decorated with
carved tulips matches two small stained-glass windows with tulips in the
center on one side of the living room.;   Grenier has used many furnishings
left in the attic and basement by the first owners of the home, the Dennys,
who lived there from 1908 to 1966.;   Books bound in pigskin, suede and
leather sit on shelves behind leaded glass in several rooms, and brass light
fixtures with small glass shades sit in pairs in both the living room and
adjoining dining room. The two rooms are dominated by fir and pine and muted
purples and pinks.;   White plaster walls and huge windows, some with window
seats, allow plenty of light into the house and gently play off the dark
wood.;   In the dining room, a built-in craftsman buffet dominates one wall,
while tables with flowers, old books and candles, and a picture window fill
the rest of the area.;   Grenier said that when she removed the two narrow
mirrors surrounding the dining room picture window to re-silver them, she
found dates of 1899 on them.;   Modern appliances, such as two television sets
and a VCR, are hidden in large craftsman armoires, with tapes stored in the
drawers below.;   Grenier's extensive research into what the home once looked
like shows in a small room next to the kitchen, which she calls the craftsman
room.;   In keeping with the craftsman love of nature, the room has a border
of wallpaper with real pressed leaves -- a paper once popular and expensive,
but now discontinued. An elderly saleslady who remembered the pattern found it
for Grenier in a warehouse.;   Craftsman, Grenier said, "is not the most
comfortable style," as the stiff lines of the one couch in the room show. An
off-white Morris rocker sits opposite the couch, its huge, thick wooden
armrests in keeping with the emphasis on wood.;   California art dating from
1910 decorates the walls, and craftsman pottery with acorn leaves sits on a
small table.;   "For years people would walk right by these things and not
give them a second glance," Grenier said of craftsman-style pieces. "Now
they're looking at it anew.";   Upstairs are three large, airy bedrooms and
the office of Grenier's husband, Barry, who owns a San Jose hardware company.
There are fewer furnishings upstairs than in the living and dining rooms, but
the pieces continue the craftsman and early-20th-century themes in a
comfortable and cozy way.;   A small balcony off the master bedroom grants
lovely views of sunsets, and like downstairs, plenty of windows allow in light
throughout the day.;   "I think what struck me most about the house is when
you open a window you really feel a breeze," Irene Grenier said. "They really
gave consideration to light and air in old houses.";   Charles Denny's huge,
dark wooden bed is in the guest bedroom, along with a turn-of-the-century
dresser, a large mirror, and a glass and metal craftsman lamp.;   Another
massive craftsman armoire is in Barry Grenier's office, along with an
1899-vintage tennis racket, which belonged to Denny's father, on the wall.;  
Little clues about how the Dennys lived, such as the tennis racket and
inscriptions in books, piqued Irene's interest in getting to know the family
that spent nearly 50 years in the house. Finally, she was given the
opportunity to reach the Dennys.;   "One day, about a year and a half ago, an
elderly man and his wife came up to the door and handed me a packet of old
pamphlets about Los Altos, and said he used to play with Charles Denny,"
Grenier said.;   "He said he knew where Charles was, and I said I'd give
anything to get in touch with him to learn more about the house." Grenier in
January started writing to two of the Denny children, now 69 and 80, to ask
about their family history and what life was like in the old house.;   She has
kept up a constant correspondence with Charles Denny, asking him what
magazines his parents and grandparents read (Country Gentleman, Ladies Home
Journal and Moody's Manual), which plants lined the gardens, the house's color
scheme (it was originally painted butterscotch with brown trim) and the floor
plan, which brother James drew from memory.;   Although Grenier had been
working on the garden since she moved into the house, Charles Denny's
description of the flowerbeds gave her even more inspiration to carry the
old-fashioned theme out to her huge, lush front and back gardens by planting
flowers and trees that were popular many years ago.;   "I'd love to see a
rebirth of interest in foxgloves, tulips, iris, peonies and old roses,"
Grenier said, naming just a few of the plants she grows.;   She has also
planted four o'clocks, snowballs, day lilies and aspidistra. Though she used
to travel to find these seeds, she now sees these old-fashioned flowers in
local nurseries and several seed catalogs specializing in flowers and plants
that had simply gone out of style.;   But the best proof that Grenier has
faithfully restored her home to recapture an era long gone was the enthusiasm
the Dennys showed when they finally had a chance to see the home after many
years' absence.;   In April, the two Denny brothers, along with six other
family members, visited the house on the day it was part of a Los Altos
"history walk.";   The family was thrilled with Grenier's restoration and
marveled that she had placed some of their original furniture in the same
rooms where it had been more than 50 years ago.;   She, too, is pleased with
the results.;   "I wanted to keep the house the way it had been, from the
furnishings to the garden," Grenier said.;   But above all, Grenier said of
her dream house, "I never want to lose the quality of having a home look like
real people live in it. I hope that's what I've achieved."  </TEXT>
