   Washington is paying tribute this week to the
first lady who helped dress the city in its spring finery of
blooming tulips and blossoming dogwoods.
   Lady Bird Johnson ``deserves the national applause and
appreciation for what she's done for the country,'' says David
Northington, executive director of the National Wildflower Research
Center in Austin, Texas.
   Separate ceremonies were planned today in the House, Senate and
White House Rose Garden to honor Mrs. Johnson, wife of former
president Lyndon Johnson and founder of the wildflower center.
   More events are planned Friday marking her 75th birthday, which
she celebrated this past December.
   ``It think it's very fitting,'' Northington said Wednesday.
``This celebration is about all she's done.''
   Mrs. Johnson said earlier this month she was inspired to
beautify Washington as first lady after returning from trips abroad
with her husband.
   She said flowers light up a city the way lipstick does a woman,
and her interests in beautifying the environment widened with the
years: from the traffic circles and public buildings in Washington
to the coasts and the heartlands in between.
   With a donation of 60 acres east of Austin and $125,000, Mrs.
Johnson in 1982 helped found the National Wildflower Research
Center, an information clearinghouse where research is done on the
role of native wildflowers in landscaping along the nation's
roadways.
   Proceeds from the Jubilee Celebration will benefit the center,
Northington said. Activities include a black-tie dinner tonight, a
luncheon Friday at the Watergate Hotel with leaders of the
Washington community, a national concert and a reception by the
Texas State Society and members of the Texas congressional
delegation.
   ``The best way to honor her is to give a gift to something she
started _ it is a little bit of everything that she's done all her
life,'' Northington said.
   Proceeds will go to an endowment that supports research into the
conservation and use of wildflowers and native plants, he said.
   Mrs. Johnson has led the way in the planting of native
wildflowers along roadways, and Northington said her efforts have
``really spread like wildflowers.''
