   James Bond, an ornithologist whose name was
adopted for the fictional British agent 007 in Ian Fleming's novels,
has died. He was 89.
   He died Tuesday at Chestnut Hill Hospital, where officials
refused to release the cause of death.
   Bond, former curator of ornithology at the Academy of Natural
Sciences, was the leading authority on birds of the West Indies for
more than half a century and is best known scientifically for
proving that birds of the Caribbean originated in North America, not
South America.
   In recognition of this discovery, the geographic line dividing
Caribbean birds of North American ancestry from those of South
American origins has been called ``Bond's Line.''
   Bond's contribution to popular culture came after World War II
when Fleming saw his book, ``Birds of the West Indies.'' Fleming, a
bird watcher, was writing a thriller at the time and adopted the
name for the dashing character portrayed in movies by Sean Connery,
Roger Moore and other actors.
   ``It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet
very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James
Bond was born,'' Fleming wrote years later to Bond's wife, Mary
Fanning Wickham Bond.
   ``In return I can only offer you or James Bond unlimited use of
the name Ian Fleming for any purposes you may think fit,'' he wrote.
``Perhaps one day your husband will discover a particularly horrible
species of bird which he would like to christen in an insulting
fashion by calling it Ian Fleming.''
   Fleming died in 1964.
   The ornithologist Bond, a native of Philadelphia, earned a
bachelor's degree at Cambridge University and made his first
scientific expedition in 1925 when he traveled up the Amazon River
to collect bird skins and live animals for the academy.
   He visited more than 100 Caribbean islands, collected all but six
of the 300 bird species living there and wrote more than 100
scientific papers and four books on Caribbean birds.
   Among his scientific honors were the Musgrave Medal from the
Institute of Jamaica in 1952; the Brewster Medal, the highest honor
of the American Ornithologists' Union, in 1954; and the Leidy Medal
of the Academy of Natural Sciences in 1975.
   He is survived by his wife, a stepdaughter and six
stepgrandchildren.
   A memorial service will be held Saturday in Chestnut Hill.
