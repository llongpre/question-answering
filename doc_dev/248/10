<HEAD>Actor Timothy Dalton Begins Filming of Latest Bond Film</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Filming of the latest James Bond
movie, ``License Revoked,'' starring actor Timothy Dalton in a
reprise role, is ready to begin in Mexico City, United Artists
announced.
   Dalton, 42, is cast as the suave British secret agent opposite
Robert Davi, who plays a tyrannical Latin American drug lord. Cast
as femme fatales are Carey Lowell and Talisa Soto. Filming is set
to begin Monday, the studio said.
   In ``License Revoked,'' Bond is cashiered by the British Secret
Service as he becomes embroiled in a personal mission of vengeance.
   The Hamlet-like role should be a cinch for Dalton, a
Shakespearean actor whose stage credits include ``Antony and
Cleopatra'' and ``Taming of the Shrew.''
   The 20-week production schedule will be shot on locations in
Mexicali, Durango, Vera Cruz, Isla Mujeres, Acapulco and Key West,
Fla.
   ``License Revoked'' will be the 18th James Bond film, if you
count the Peter Sellers' spoof ``Casino Royale,'' and is produced
by Albert R. ``Cubby'' Broccoli, the veteran Bond filmaker, and
Michael G. Wilson. The director is John Glen.
