It may take a long time to rival Ferrari, but Aston Martin Lagonda wants to
accelerate into the fast lane of the world luxury sports-car market.
'We are making the break from being a low-volume cottage industry to
becoming a mainstream specialist carmaker,' said Mr Nick Fry, managing
director.
The transformation is being fuelled by finance and expertise from Ford, the
world's second-largest vehicle producer, which acquired a 75 per cent stake
in 1987 and took over the outstanding minority shareholding earlier this
year from the Livanos shipping family.
One of the illustrious marques of the British motor industry, often
lossmaking and with a chequered ownership history after its golden age ended
with its sale in 1972, Aston Martin is in effect being relaunched.
The introduction this autumn of the DB7 sports car is set to increase car
output to about 800 next year from just 144 this year.
That is only the first stage in the marque's planned comeback. 'It is
critical to have more than one model line,' said Mr Fry. 'Our volume was so
small, we could never become a credible carmaker.'
Production of the traditional handcrafted Vantage and Volante sports cars
will continue in small numbers at Aston Martin's cramped Newport Pagnell
headquarters, but the company's expansion is being carried out at a new
plant at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, which it has recently taken over from
JaguarSport.
The Bloxham plant is planning to assemble 150 DB7s by the end of the year,
rising to nearly 700 next year. But Aston Martin intends to follow the DB7
with a four-door, four-seat sports saloon which is pencilled into the
development programme for launch in 1998-99. Total output could then exceed
1,500 cars a year.
This car, which will be modelled on the Lagonda Vignale concept car unveiled
at Geneva motor show last year, has not yet been given the go-ahead, but
that is expected next year.
Mr John Oldfield, who joined Aston Martin as executive chairman in February,
said: 'Within the company we have a clear consensus that we need a second
model and that Vignale is the model. If we can put together the right
programme, it could be in production in four years.'
Aston Martin continued to stumble for the first couple of years under Ford
ownership, but recently the US carmaker has taken a more rigorous approach
as it began to inject serious sums of money. Aston Martin was refinanced
last year with Pounds 50m new equity capital.
A large part of the Aston Martin senior management has come directly from
Ford, most recently Mr Oldfield, who was the vice-president responsible for
all Ford product development in Europe.
The board has been revitalised. It now includes Jackie Stewart, the former
Formula 1 world champion who has worked on developing the ride and handling
of the DB7, and Mr Nick Scheele, chairman and chief executive of Jaguar. A
number of parts are being drawn from Ford's other British subsidiary,
including the DB7 floorpan from the Jaguar XJS and the original block for
the DB7's 3.2-litre, six-cylinder, 335-horsepower supercharged engine.
An important part of the expansion of Aston Martin will be the development
of its worldwide dealer network, which is planned to grow from 42 at the
start of 1991 to more than 100 by the end of next year. Mr Fry said: 'This
is especially critical in the US, where you either fail completely or are a
big success. There is no in-between. This will be our Waterloo, and we are
determined it will be a major success.'
The DB7 will not be launched in the US until the beginning of 1996, by which
time it will be equipped with both driver and passenger airbags, but the
company has already started a big push with market research and the
recruitment of new dealers. It wants to increase the number of north
American dealers from 12 to about 30.
Aston Martin is planning to sell about 35 per cent of the output of the DB7
in north America and is hoping that the new car will greatly reduce its
dependence on the domestic UK market. It is also seeking to establish much
more of a presence in continental European and Asia-Pacific markets.
While the Aston Martin marque may still be well known in the UK, the racing
heritage is hardly established in foreign markets.
It plans a one-make DB7 racing championship for owners modelled on the race
series successfully launched a couple of years ago by Ferrari for its 348
sports car. Just as importantly, it is seeking to rediscover former glories
by competing at Le Mans in France and Daytona in the US. Negotiations are
taking place with two UK corporations in the search for the Pounds 3m-Pounds
4m sponsorship needed to run a successful three-car team for Le Mans. Aston
Martin was last at Le Mans in 1979, and it would like to return in 1995 or
1996, Mr Fry said.
The biggest image boost may come at little cost, however. Aston Martin has
an outline agreement - but no final contract yet - for the DB7 to be used in
the next James Bond film, Goldeneye, starring Pierce Brosnan in the latest
incarnation of agent 007.
The original James Bond, Sean Connery, was a priceless marketing coup in his
Aston Martin DB5 in Goldfinger, and both Ford and its sporty UK subsidiary
are hoping for the same worldwide boost from Goldeneye.
