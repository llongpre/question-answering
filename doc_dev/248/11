<LEADPARA>  'OH, GOD forbid!" says Roger Moore when asked if he might do another James
Bond film.;   He might well have continued playing Ian Fleming's
globe-trotting super-agent -- even approaching 63, Moore could pass for 45 --
but since his last Bond movie in 1985, Moore has taken on more urgent
international concerns in real life.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He recently completed a two-week tour of Latin America and the Caribbean,
where he looked in on UNICEF health projects as a representative of that
agency. (His flight back to the United States required a stopover at the
Dallas/Fort Worth airport, with visiting time between connections.);   Moore
has been involved with UNICEF -- United Nations Children's Fund -- since
around the time of his fifth James Bond film, 1980's "For Your Eyes Only."
This involvement led last month to his appointment as the agency's "special
representative for the film arts.";   "This is one of the few worthwhile
things I've done," said Moore, whose humanitarian involvement dates to the
early 1970s.;   "Just a week ago," he continued, "I got to 'introduce' running
water to a Guatemalan village -- that is, I was privileged to turn on the tap,
which the community had built with UNICEF assistance. . . . It's been a most
fascinating time. I knew all about the conditions of poverty from reading the
official statistics, but I've really wanted to go and put some faces to those
statistics.";   Moore tackled the Bond role in seven films from "Live and Let
Die" (1973) through "A View to a Kill" (1985).;   "I believe I said all I had
to say about Bond," Moore said. "Once might even have been enough, though I'm
glad to have stuck with the character.;   "I enjoyed doing Holmes, as well,"
he added, referring to his 1976 TV-movie turn in "Sherlock Holmes in New
York." "But once was decidedly enough.";   He speaks enthusiastically,
however, of returning to another of his familiar characters: While a new Moore
picture called "Bed and Breakfast" is finished for release, he is awaiting
delivery of a script for "The Saint" -- in pre-production as a big-screen
project at Paramount Pictures.;   Moore was hardly the first to impersonate
Simon "The Saint" Templar, Leslie Charteris' rule-breaking crime-buster, but
his redefinition of the character in 114 "Saint" TV episodes (1961-68) is as
striking as any of the 1930s-'40s portrayals by George Sanders, Hugh Sinclair
or Louis Hayward.;   "I'm really looking forward to getting back in
character," Moore said.  </TEXT>
