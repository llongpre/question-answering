   If Robert Davi ever gets tired of being a
villain on film, he can always try opera. That's how he got his
start in show biz, and when he talks about a character it can sound
a bit _ well, operatic.
   ``I was a high baritone, loved Verdi,'' said Davi, who plays drug
lord Franz Sanchez in ``License Revoked,'' the latest James Bond
movie due out in the summer. ``I sang for the Lyric Opera of Long
Island.''
   Davi, 35, did that when he was 19. He even studied with Tito
Gobbi, one of the great voices of Italy.
   ``If I was still singing I wouldn't be doing any of this now,''
he said, waving at a Bond set gloomy with smoke from the fire that
destroys the villain's laboratory.
   ``I wouldn't be smoking cigars or drinking. And I'd get out of
this air (Mexico City's world-record pollution). I wouldn't even be
talking. I would be totally crazy.
   ``After I'm established as an actor I'd like to spend six months
and work on the voice. Now the voice is getting the black mark.''
   Timothy Dalton, who plays Bond, had proposed that Davi play
Sanchez as an opera buff: ``I suggested to him that he had to find a
moment where he sang a bar or two. Probably at an odd moment right
after or just before he killed somebody, whistle or sing a couple of
bars.''
   ``We thought about it when we first met,'' Davi said. ``Timothy
wanted me to try something, but I decided I better not. I did the
same thing in `Goonies,' sort of played a frustrated opera singer. I
didn't want to do the same thing as I did in the Spielberg film,
which was full of pirate ships and fantasies. I want to be
remembered for something else in this film.''
   But Dalton said he didn't see why Davi should worry about that,
``if it's a good idea.''
   ``All actors have good ideas. But they're not always germane to
the piece,'' said Davi, more diplomatic than Sparafucile, the hired
killer of Verdi's ``Rigoletto.''
   But Sanchez, ``seductive, charming, and totally immoral,'' as
Davi conceived him, might be able to hold his own with many another
opera bad guy.
   ``The most difficult was when I walked through that house in
Acapulco that was supposed to be the house I owned. A $30 million
house. I don't have $30 million,'' Davi said.
   ``You know, a lot of actors when they play something like that
you see them in the house but you don't really believe that they own
it. I had to go through that house and feel like I owned it.''
   Then he bursts into a snatch of ``Va, Tosca,'' a solo in which
the evil Scarpia boasts that he's infected Tosca's heart with
jealousy by fooling her into thinking her boyfriend is fooling
around.
   Watch out, Puccini.
