   Pierce Brosnan, who'd never been to Asia
before, started last year with a miniseries in Hong Kong and ended
it with a movie in India.
   In between, he returned to his native Ireland to do an
independent film with some friends.
   The miniseries, ``Noble House,'' starts its eight-hour,
four-part run on NBC this Sunday. It's based on the best-selling
book by James Clavell.
   The movie in India is ``The Deceivers,'' from the book by John
Masters. The Irish movie is ``Taffin.''
   In ``Noble House,'' Brosnan stars as Ian Dunross, the tai-pan,
or boss, of Hong Kong's leading trading house. It also stars
Deborah Raffin, Ben Masters, John Houseman, John Rhys-Davies and
Julia Nickson. Gary Nelson directed it on location in Hong Kong for
12 weeks and at the Dino De Laurentiis Studio in North Carolina for
another 12 weeks.
   ``Hong Kong was my first step into the Orient,'' said Brosnan.
``It's a fascinating place, sort of a condensed version of New York
City. My schedule was such that I had time to go around and see the
place. I bought an automatic camera and did some photography.
   ``What was around me was so exciting to look at and so
different. The colors and the light were magical. Having started
life as a commercial artist, I've always looked at things as though
to paint them. I used a zoom lens because the Chinese don't like
having their pictures taken.''
   As the story opens, Dunross has just taken over the family's
trading empire.
   ``He's fairly ruthless in his dealings with people,'' said
Brosnan. ``He has a remoteness to him. An isolated charm. I've
never played a character like him before. The job came at a very
opportune moment, after the whole incident of James Bond and
`Remington Steele.'''
   After NBC canceled ``Remington Steele'' a few seasons back,
Brosnan was asked to become the next James Bond. Roger Moore had
decided to step down as 007. Then, because of the publicity over
Bond, NBC put ``Remington Steele'' back on the schedule, and
Brosnan was dropped from the Bond picture.
   Did he see the offer of the role in ``Noble House'' as a peace
offering?
   ``I never thought of it as a peace offering,'' he answered. ``I
saw it as a way of putting as much distance between myself and
`Remington Steele' as possible. I'd always enjoyed doing the
series, but I knew coming back for six more episodes was hogwash.
They wanted to have their cake and eat it.
   ``The turmoil for me was the on and off anxiety of the Bond
part. It lasted an eternity. I was offered James Bond. I said yes.
`Remington Steele' was brought back. That's enough to say on the
subject. It was a shame because `Remington Steele' was never
allowed to finish with any grace.''
   As it turned out, Timothy Dalton was hired to play James Bond in
``The Living Daylights.'' Brosnan said he sees no chance that he
will ever play the role.
   His wife, Cassandra Harris, was Moore's leading lady in the Bond
movie ``For Your Eyes Only.''
   Brosnan's India movie, ``The Deceivers,'' is set in 1824 and
focuses on the Thugs who worshipped the god of destruction, Kali.
   ``I play an Englishman, a glorified accountant working for the
East India Trading Co.,'' he said. ``He discovers this cult and
disguises himself as an Indian. He goes on the road with the Thugs,
who kill people by strangulation.''
   Brosnan's only current appearances on TV are in a commercial for
Diet Coke, which was premiered during the Super Bowl coverage. It
was filmed on a speeding train in England and looks like a scene
right out of a spy thriller such as a Bond movie, or perhaps ``The
Fourth Protocol,'' in which Brosnan played a Soviet agent being
tracked down by Michael Caine.
   ``That was me walking on top of that train,'' he said. ``It was
going 40 miles an hour. If I'd fallen off that sucker I'd never
have done `The Deceivers.'''
