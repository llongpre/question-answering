<LEADPARA>  SEAN Connery felt fettered and humiliated in Bond-age. Roger Moore, never a
serious actor to begin with, had a lark with James Bond, whom he played as a
clown in Savile Row tweeds. Timothy Dalton, perhaps the cleverest of the
bunch, is using good old 007 to get his pick of, well, more interesting
roles.;    Currently, Dalton, 47, is playing '30s matinee idol/Nazi spy
Neville Sinclair in Disney's "The Rocketeer." It's a deliciously cheeky turn,
part haughty Olivier, part seedy Errol Flynn (right down to the pencil-thin
mustache). Dalton says the role was tailored for him.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "When I first read the (comic book-inspired) script, I didn't want to play
the part. Sinclair was written in a very one-dimensional way. The guy was just
a pompous ass. Disney told me, 'We're going to rewrite the entire script, move
the character from being a cartoon to a much better role.' I wanted to exploit
the fact that he's an actor, to find moments when he seems to be one thing but
is really lying through his teeth. I wanted to show how phony actors can be. I
loved doing it.";    The spy who loved Mae;  Dalton says his favorite line
comes during the knockdown, drag-out with the hero aboard a German zeppelin.; 
  The line "I always do my own stunts" (in response to a Rocketeer put-down),
right?;    "No, it comes a little later. I based my whole performance on it.
It's when Sinclair says, with wonderful arrogance, 'It wasn't a lie, it was
acting.' What nonsense! Acting is lies, but it's also the truth. The whole of
his life this German agent is pretending.";    Little wonder Dalton could
identify with the character. In one manner or another the Welsh actor has been
"pretending" since his late teens, when he attended London's National Youth
Theater and Royal Academy. "Extreme good luck" led to a supporting role
opposite Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn in "The Lion in Winter" and roles
in "Mary, Queen of Scots," a "Wuthering Heights" remake (as Heathcliff, of
course) and "Agatha.";    A different kind of luck led Dalton to Mae West's
"Sextette" and the worst of the comic-strip fantasies, "Flash Gordon" and
"Brenda Starr" (with Brooke Shields as the intrepid reporter).;    This fall
Dalton will don doublet and pantaloons and set sail as New World explorer
Christopher Columbus in Ilya and Alexander Salkind's $40 million "Christopher
Columbus: The Discovery." Then, he'll renew his license to kill for his third
Bond outing, a still-untitled cliffhanger that will attempt a comfortable
middle ground between the farcical Moore Bonds and Dalton's darker "Licence to
Kill." "Licence" received high marks from Bond enthusiasts but brought in a
disappointing $40 million in domestic ticket sales.;    "We were the victim of
a not particularly good advertising campaign on 'Licence,' " Dalton says.
"Then, too, we opened whilst 'Batman,' 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' and 'Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade' were still going strong. We were like the sixth or
seventh big movie. It was a very bad time to open, but worldwide 'Licence' did
better than 'The Living Daylights' (Dalton's first Bond outing), which was the
biggest grossing Bond movie for 10 or 12 years.";    At the time, it was
reported that Dalton's license to kill was revoked because he was the least
popular of the Bonds. Dalton rankles at the memory.;    "No, that was never
discussed," he fairly hisses into the phone. "Stupid, irresponsible
journalism. . . . One telephone call to 'Cubby' Broccoli (the series'
producer) could have gotten the truth.";    The next Bond, referred to vaguely
at MGM as "Bond No. 17," is still on the drawing board. Dalton explains: "The
script isn't finished, but what I've seen is outrageous. It's a formative
script that obviously needs some work, but when it's finished it'll combine
the best of 'Daylights' and 'Licence,' with some good tough humor.";    It's
tricky attempting to pump a sense of jeopardy back into the series while
holding on to the vermouth-dry humor of the best Connery Bonds, "From Russia
With Love" and "Goldfinger," Dalton concedes.;    "We definitely have to have
more humor in the Bond movies, but I don't want it to be campy humor or a
sendup. I dearly love Roger Moore, but if you talk about the best Bonds,
you're talking about Sean Connery and not camp or sendup. In the '70s and
early '80s, the Bond pictures were dominated by gadgetry and technical
effects, which were often superb. I found them uninvolving. Connery's Bond was
a human being. Cynical and dry, mind you -- but a man with a man's sense of
humor and a certain world-weariness.";    0017;    Dalton explains that Bond
No. 17 was derailed when MGM/UA, the distributor of the series, was taken over
by Pathe and everything went into a legal limbo. "This time last year we were
supposed to go into production, but since the takeover nothing has happened.
There's great uncertainty at MGM now.";    Though contractually obligated to
play Bond, Dalton is his own actor between assignments. "I'm perfectly free to
do whatever I want," he says with a sniff.;    Connery, likewise, did other
films during his time out of Bond-age -- most notably "A Fine Madness" and,
for Hitchcock, "Marnie" -- but he complained bitterly over a PR campaign
designed to make his name synonymous with the Ian Fleming super spy. That was
before Superman, Batman and indeed Rocketeer came along to break Bond's
monopoly on cliffhanger suspense.;    "They did a big push to mold the public
impression of Bond -- of Connery as Bond," says Dalton. "The series was unique
back then. There weren't any movies like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' It was the
first of the big, high-rolling action-adventure films.";    The mood is
changing in Hollywood, Dalton believes. Spectacle for spectacle's sake is no
longer enough. Big-budget vehicles such as "Robin Hood" and "Hudson Hawk" are
already passe.;    What about his upcoming Columbus project, scripted by Mario
Puzo and due to get under way in September or October in Spain and the
Caribbean? That sounds like a classic Hollywood "costumer" of the type Olivier
and Flynn once made.;    Nothing could be further from the truth, Dalton
says.;    "We're not doing a historical, two-dimensional pageant. We're not
doing a school-book treatment. You won't be watching waves sloshing past
boats. This will not be a dry history lesson; it will be about the inner
struggle of the man. It will be done with passion and vision and be full of
details that nobody knows.";    That's the crowning irony, Dalton says. The
man who discovered the Americas is unknown in America.;    "You don't know
anything about him really. All you know is that he sailed across the Atlantic
and hit America. He was an extremely obsessive man with a great vision. He had
a great sense of ambition. He was very poor and wanted to get rich. He wasn't
Spanish, and he was probably part Jewish at a time when they were burning
Jews.";    If everything goes as planned -- and nothing goes as planned when
you're shooting at sea -- the Salkinds' "Columbus" will be in theaters in
October 1992, just in time to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus'
docking at what is now Watling Island in the Bahamas.;    Hot on its rudder
could be a Paramount Pictures version titled simply "Christopher Columbus."
This version is being described as an earthier, more psychological handling of
the Italian explorer who, in the summer of 1492, sailed for Ferdinand and
Isabella of Spain.;    Paramount's "Columbus" is being hyped as a possible
Gerard Depardieu vehicle, with Ridley ("Thelma &amp; Louise") Scott set to direct.
In contrast to Dalton's Columbus, who sounds like a more traditional hero,
Depardieu's man from Genoa has been described as a manipulator and a martinet
who dies in poverty and disgrace.;    Dalton feels the Atlantic is only big
enough for one Columbus saga.;    "I've not read their script, but the
competition is not a good thing," he says. "They (Scott and Depardieu) are
good people. I wish them luck. But I would be lying if I told you that I feel
comfortable about this. It doesn't please me. It ain't going to be good to
have two Columbuses in theaters at the same time. But it only makes us more
ambitious to be the better one.";    If box-office history is a measure of
such things, they're well on their way to becoming a hit, reasons Dalton, who
takes a strong interest in the business side of things.;    "Of course past
grosses are no guarantee of quality or success," he agrees, "but in this case
they are in some sense good grounds for a movie. Puzo wrote the 'Godfather'
movies. The Salkinds did the 'Superman' movies. There are my two Bonds. George
Cosmatos (the director) did 'Rambo: First Blood Part II' and 'Cobra.' Among
us, we've made several of the top-grossing films of all time. That's cause for
optimism.";    Any trepidation about spending a good part of next fall on the
high sea?;    "I love water," he says. "And the boats are wonderful. The
Spanish government has built replicas of the Pinta, the Nina and the Santa
Maria as part of their 500-year celebration. They're letting us use them.
They're tiny, tiny boats. When they sail off, they're like little dots on the
sea." (box)  </TEXT>
