   Sean Connery, the quintessential Agent 007 in
such James Bond films as ``Dr. No'' and ``Never Say Never Again,''
won his first Oscar Monday night for his portrayal of the steely
Irish cop in ``The Untouchables.''
   Connery received his second standing ovation of the evening as
he accepted the best supporting actor award, saying ``patience is
truly a virtue.''
   His first standing ovation came at the top of the 60th annual
Academy Awards ceremony when he introduced the visual effects award
amid a spectacular backdrop of cinematic magic.
   In a 30-year film career, which includes about 40 pictures,
Connery's Oscar also represented his first Academy Award nomination.
   Winning created a certain dilemma, Connery said on stage,
because he had promised to give the award to his wife.
   ``This evening I discovered backstage that they're worth $15,000
and now I'm not so sure,'' he said, then added, ``I'm only
kidding.'' The statuettes actually are worth about $200 each.
   He ended his acceptance speech by saying: ``If such a thing as a
wish accompanied this award, mine would be that we ended the
writer's strike.''
   The strike by the Writers Guild of America against movie and
television producers is now in its fifth week.
   Connery was handpicked by Ian Fleming to play James Bond in
``Dr. No,'' and starred in six more of the spy films including
1983's ``Never Say Never Again.'' He also has appeared in such
films as ``The Great Train Robbery'' and ``The Name of the Rose.''
   Connery was chosen for the Oscar from among nominees Albert
Brooks, ``Broadcast News''; Morgan Freeman, ``Street Smart'';
Vincent Gardenia, ``Moonstruck,'' and Denzel Washington, ``Cry
Freedom.''
