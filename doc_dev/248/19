   A yacht scheduled to be used in the filming of a
new James Bond film was apparently just taking its time on a trip
along the coast and was not missing as previously believed, the
Coast Guard said today.
   The 67-foot Alina III left North Palm Beach Sunday morning for a
scheduled 12-hour trip to Key West. The Coast Guard began a search
when there was no sign of the boat by late Monday.
   Early today, however, it arrived in port, the Coast Guard said.
   The Coast Guard had asked other vessels off south Florida to
watch for the boat.
   The Bond movie, ``License Revoked,'' is being filmed in the Keys.
