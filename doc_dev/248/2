JAMES BOND, 89; ORNITHOLOGIST'S NAME MADE FAMOUS IN FICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A world-famous ornithologist, whose name became synonymous with secret agentry 
because of a chance literary encounter with Ian Fleming, has died. 
</P>
<P>
The real James Bond, unlike his fictional counterpart, lived 89 peaceful years 
before dying of the complications of age Tuesday at a hospital in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Bond, former curator of ornithology at the Academy of Natural Sciences, was the 
leading authority on birds of the West Indies for more than half a century and 
is best known for proving that birds of the Caribbean originated in North 
America, not South America. 
</P>
<P>
In recognition of this discovery, the geographic line dividing Caribbean birds 
of North American ancestry from those of South American origins has been called 
"Bond's Line." 
</P>
<P>
But his name was to become a household synonym for intrigue after World War II 
because Fleming was reading his book, "Birds of the West Indies," while writing 
at his home in Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming, an avid bird watcher, adopted the ornithologist's name for the dashing 
character since portrayed in movies by Sean Connery, Roger Moore and other 
actors. 
</P>
<P>
"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine 
name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born," Fleming 
wrote years later to Bond's wife, Mary. 
</P>
<P>
"In return I can only offer you or James Bond unlimited use of the name Ian 
Fleming for any purposes you may think fit," he wrote. "Perhaps one day your 
husband will discover a particularly horrible species of bird which he would 
like to christen in an insulting fashion by calling it Ian Fleming."
