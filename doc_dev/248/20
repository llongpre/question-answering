17F:THE LIFE OF IAN FLEMING by Donald McCormick Peter Owen Pounds 18.50, 232
pages
IN 1966 John Pearson wrote a good biography of Ian Fleming, who had died,
only 56, two years before. Its weakness was that it became extremely sketchy
about the last years, so much so that many readers must have guessed that
Pearson had run into problems, presumably with the widow, Ann, formerly Lady
Rothermere.
This book, which is no way a serious biography and scarcely a 'reappraisal'
as claimed but a series of observations on Fleming's interesting life, is
free of that inhibition. Donald McCormick, aka Richard Deacon, is a former
journalist colleague of Fleming and an frequent author in the spy stakes. He
was one of Fleming's stringers after the war and writes about him with
affection.
Not surprisingly, McCormick confirms that the Ian/Ann marriage had been
difficult for years. He did not enjoy her social life and she was
contemptuous of his creation of James Bond; their lives had moved apart and
his final years do not sound happy. The interest here is to signal various
items missing from Pearson which may one day figure in another biography.
The emphasis lies on the war years with Naval Intelligence.
For example, there was a Polish woman friend called Christine Granville, a
brave and distinguished Second War spy, later murdered, who may have been
'Vesper Lynd' in Casino Royale. There was also an important German woman
friend called Vanessa Hoffman with a mysterious role inside Nazi Germany who
seems to have vanished without trace. Similarly, we did not know that in the
war Fleming was once involved with Aleister Crowley in astrological and
occult ceremonies which eventually may have influenced Rudolf Hess's flight
to Scotland. More, please.
It also seems to be suggested that Fleming's establishment of the 'Mercury'
news service for the Kemsley papers in the 1940s, in particular for the
Sunday Times, had links with British Intelligence: in view of the stick the
Observer was later to take for its hiring of Philby, the subject has more
than curiosity value.
We could do with another life of Fleming, not because he invented James Bond
but because he was an interesting Establishment figure. The fact that Bond
became a bore - as his creator understood better than anyone  - does not
deny that.
