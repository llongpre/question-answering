"James Bond" Triumphs: Timothy Dalton, star of the latest James Bond films, was 
awarded unspecified libel damages at a London court Tuesday from the publishers 
of a North American movie magazine that suggested he was going to be booted 
from the Bond role. Dalton's lawyer, Philip Conway, said the reports in Globe 
magazine that the actor could be dropped to save future James Bond films from 
financial disaster were untrue and had distressed and embarrassed him. Conway 
said the producers of the films were very satisfied with Dalton's performances 
in "The Living Daylights" and "Licence to Kill." GREG BRAXTON
