Well, at last. Monday was Albert (Cubby) Broccoli Day in Los Angeles. The 
producer of the James Bond films was feted at the premiere of the latest, 
"Licence to Kill," through an evening that began at about 6 p.m. at the 
Directors Guild of America building and ended long after midnight at the Bel 
Age Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone was there, including Mayor Bradley, complete with a Broccoli Day 
proclamation. Broccoli, whose career spans more than half a century and 27 
films, has a great many friends in The Biz, and nearly all of them showed up 
(except two of the Bonds -- Sean Connery and Roger Moore). When all the 
celebrants crushed into the Directors Guild cocktail arena (which doubles as a 
theater lobby at less festive times), conversation can get heated. And so can 
the celebrants. Add in most of the press corps of the Western world, with 
flashbulbs and minicams, for an extra-hot event.

Wary of Questions 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bradley was cooking. He deflected deftly all requests to name his 
favorite Bond film. "I'm smart enough as a politician not to identify any one 
of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As this was also a premiere of Broccoli's latest Bond film, starring Timothy 
Dalton, everyone was wary of questions regarding their favorite Bond, although 
Broccoli was brave enough to remark that the golden-throated Dalton is "the 
best actor of the lot." 
</P>
<P>
(A random furtive sample taken on the scene demonstrated, however, that Sean 
Connery is still the favorite.) 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli found himself a bit puzzled by all the festivities. "I don't know what 
it's all about. And I'm getting nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Dalton, chatting in a corner, suggested that the women should be asked to 
determine why he is "so attractive." And modest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Like a Roast 
</P>
<P>
Dalton said that the Bond films endure because "Mr. Broccoli has never cheaply 
exploited any of his previous films." And this, once again, was the case with 
"Licence to Kill," applauded over and over again by the audience, which 
included "Licence" beauties Talisa Soto and Carey Lowell and former Bond 
heroes, heroines, villains and villainesses including Richard ("Jaws") Kiel, 
Maud Adams, John Rhys-Davies, Lois Chiles, Patrick Macnee, Martine Beswick and 
Grace Jones. And there was Miss Moneypenny herself, Lois Maxwell, plus 
celebrities galore, not to mention Ringo Starr. 
</P>
<P>
After the screening, the more than 400 guests squeezed into the banquet 
facilities at the Bel Age Hotel to pay tribute to Broccoli. It was more like a 
roast. Macnee emceed. Wayne Newton, whose first major motion picture this was 
(he plays Professor Joe Butcher), was just beside himself. "Gosh, this is 
great!" he said as Macnee took to the podium to introduce David Picker, the 
former head of United Artists, who gave the go ahead to "Dr. No" back in 1962.
