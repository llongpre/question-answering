   Jason Connery, son of the consummate James Bond,
Sean Connery, is to star in a television movie as Ian Fleming, the
author and creator of Agent 007.
   ``Freud would have a field day with this one,'' Jason Connery
said in this week's People magazine.
   ``The thing is that I'm compared continually to my father _ so I
thought, if it's a good script, just do it,'' he said. ``People
will say what they want to anyway, so I didn't feel any pressure.''
   The younger Connery says his famous father hasn't intruded in
his acting career.
   ``Dad and I have a very good relationship, but when it comes to
acting, it's important to make your own decisions,'' he said.
   The made-for-TV movie, ``The Secret Life of Ian Fleming,'' will
be televised March 5 on the TNT cable network.
