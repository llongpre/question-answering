Not so long ago a friend confessed that he had been to Dukes Hotel in St
James's, central London, and ordered a dry martini. The barman at Dukes,
Gilberto Preti, is rumoured to make the best martinis in London, but my
friend found that he had been unable to finish the glass: it was just that
bit too strong, and just a little bit too dry.
It is that austere and uncompromising side of the martini which makes it the
greatest of cocktails. One's first martini should be a baptism of fire: a
martini is a John Wayne of a drink which separates men from boys. It is one
of the very few things I look forward to when crossing the Atlantic, for
Americans are deeply serious about martinis.
In 1977 President Jimmy Carter launched a famous attack on the
'three-martini lunch' as a symbol of the progressive decadence of the
American business world. American drinking habits are distinctly odd. They
drink three cocktails then sit down to iced water rather than wine with the
meal. It is all a bit like a general who unleashes a terrible artillery
barrage at the enemy lines at the beginning of a battle, then forgets to
send in the troops. Three pre-prandial martinis would seem to be a lethal
dose.
A great deal of mystique surrounds the creation of a martini, but the recipe
looks deceptively simple. The Savoy Cocktail Book (Constable, Pounds 6.95)
gives the following: '1/7 dry vermouth; 6/7 dry gin, stir well with ice and
serve with a squeeze of lemon rind.' Which is certainly only half the story.
In order to find out the other half, I went along to a tasting of dry
martinis at the Atlantic Bar and Grill in Piccadilly, London's latest
late-night haunt. Five top London barmen were standing with their cocktail
shakers in their hands: Dick Bradsell from the Atlantic; Salvatore Calabrese
from the Lanesborough; Peter Dorelli from the Savoy's American Bar; James
Scott from the Groucho Club in Soho; and Lado Stojanovic from Maxwells in
Covent Garden.
Judging between the five was hard work indeed. All displayed a very high
level of professionalism. Bradsell's, Calabrese's and Dorellis were quite
similar in style - all three were deeply lemony. Dorelli's was slightly
different in that it was served, minus the peel in the original Savoy
cocktail glass; justified by tradition, but ever so slightly nude.
Stojanovic's was the least dry of the five, in that it was the only one in
which one could detect the flavour of vermouth which made it half way to a
gin and French. Scott's was possibly the driest, in that not even the lemon
was able to dent the armour of the gin.
What surprised me were the choices of gin.
They were unanimous in their condemnation of Gordons and its new 37.5 per
cent bottling, but all five had selected gins at 40 per cent. Of these, two
were Beefeater, two Bombay Sapphire and one, Booths. Contrary to the
teaching of great barmen beyond these shores, who use export strength gin at
around 47 per cent, these British barmen insist that their relatively weak
martinis are the best. American customers, they maintain, are astounded by
their delicacy after the fire-water they drink at home. I have to say I was
not wholly convinced by this argument.
Of the other elements which go into a martini, four out of five favoured
Martini Extra Dry as their vermouth, while the one remaining barman used
Noilly Prat. In the main, the vermouth does not end up in the drink, being
either swirled round the glass or the shaker. Clear, fresh, quick-frozen ice
was absolutely indispensable; and it should be stirred, not shaken: shaking
bruises the gin. This little heresy was introduced by Ian Fleming of James
Bond fame.
Another heresy was the olive. Dorelli thought this went back to the film
MASH, where one of the characters is offered an olive-less martini and
exclaims: 'What no olive? You can't drink martinis without olives]' You can,
apparently. An olive will just make your cocktail oily.
I emerged from the tasting slightly light-headed and not wholly convinced
that I had really got to the bottom of the martini debate. Next stop Dukes.
