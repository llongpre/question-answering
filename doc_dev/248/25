   When a medical emergency arises on the set of a
movie, it's not always part of the script.
   So when Dr. James D'Orta is not setting a broken bone at
Baltimore's Franklin Square Hospital or patching up a shooting
victim at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, the
emergency medicine specialist usually can be found on location.
   D'Orta is the founder of LifeStar International, a
Washington-based medical consulting firm that expands the walls of
the emergency room to movie sets.
   He and his colleagues have provided advance planning and
emergency medical care on the set for three recent movies:
``Licence to Kill'' and Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``Total Recall,''
both filmed in Mexico City; and ``The Abyss,'' an underwater
thriller filmed in an abandoned nuclear power plant that was
converted into a film studio in Gaffney, S.C.
   ``We're like the sprinkler heads in skyscrapers,'' said D'Orta.
``Producers with vision can see the necessity of taking preventive
measures to ensure the safety of their crews. It's several hundreds
of millions of dollars of movie budgets that we're protecting.''
   According to the New York-based Center for Safety in the Arts,
more than 1,000 injuries are reported each year in the U.S. film
industry, and since 1980, at least 19 people have been killed in
helicopter accidents on movie sets. Actor Vic Morrow and two
children were killed in 1982 during the filming of ``Twilight Zone:
The Movie,'' and five people died during the filming of Chuck
Norris' ``Delta Force 2,'' in the Philippines last May.
   D'Orta, 38, started the company after accompanying his
producer-cousin, Albert ``Cubby'' Broccoli, to Morocco to film
another James Bond movie, ``The Living Daylights,'' released by
United Artists in 1987.
   It was D'Orta's job to keep the new James Bond, Timothy Dalton,
and the rest of the cast and crew in good health while the movie
was filmed in the oasis of Ouarzazate, in the Sahara Desert. Time
lost on the set because of injuries or illness cost more than
$250,000 per day, or about $500 per minute. The doctor's work also
took him off the film set and into what he described as ``a
real-life James Bond drama.''
   He was approached in the desert by soldiers who were seeking
help for the victim of a motorcycle accident, the guard to the
prince of Bahrain.
   ``They said, `The prince will give you anything if you will come
and help us,''' D'Orta said. ``When we got there, the prince was
begging me to help the man and the guy was lying unconscious on the
street. He had a blood clot on the brain.''
   To the amazement of passersby, D'Orta inserted an intravenous
needle and hooked the patient to a cardiac monitor. The 007
airplane was summoned to take the guard to a hospital in Rabat,
Morocco.
   Mission accomplished, D'Orta left the hospital, but was stopped
by soldiers demanding his passport.
   ``I told them, `It's back in the desert on the movie set,'''
D'Orta said. ``They put me in a room where I sat and drank tea for
six hours until the king gave permission for me to leave.''
   D'Orta's patient recovered after surgery.
   ``If it weren't for Jimmy, I don't think he would have lived,''
said Michael G. Wilson, who produced and wrote the Bond flick.
``It's that kind of response that is very important to us, so when
it came time to film our next movie, we wanted him back.''
   D'Orta drafted Dr. Craig Feied, an emergency physician at George
Washington University Medical Center in Washington, and Vincent
Young, a Harvard business graduate, and founded LifeStar.
   D'Orta, Feied and a network of hundreds of emergency physicians
throughout the country have traveled to movie sets in such places
as the Philippines, Austria, Tangiers, Mexico and the Soviet Union.
In addition to motion pictures, the company also provided medical
consultation for Amnesty International's 1988 Human Rights Now!
concert tour, which performed in major cities all over the world.
   D'Orta also helped coordinate emergency medical teams after the
1985 earthquake in Mexico City, and was part of a group of
physicians who traveled to the Soviet Union after last fall's
earthquake in Armenia.
   ``The thing that makes us different from other entrepreneurs and
businessmen is that we truly practice medicine,'' D'Orta said.
``That gives us more credibility.''
   LifeStar uses computer links to the World Health Organization,
the Centers for Disease Control and the State Department to analyze
everything from rumors of unrest in Grenada to reports of a new
outbreak of resistant malaria in Zambia. The company checks each
person's immunizations, types their blood and has access to blood
that has been screened to be disease-free by U.S. and British
standards.
   Because many medications in the United States don't have exact
equivalents in other countries, LifeStar sends along a well-stocked
portable pharmacy. Detailed plans are made for rapid transport to
medical facilities in the event of injury or illness, and once the
filming begins, LifeStar physicians remain on the set.
   LifeStar's prices vary depending on the size of the production
and the risks and planning required, Young said.
   ``Any major film production can afford us,'' Young said. ``If
you compare what it costs for our services with what it would cost
without our services, it is free or very cheap for film producers.''
   Wilson agreed.
   ``It's a reasonable expense and it's worthwhile because they do
an excellent job and can turn a disaster into no time lost,'' he
said. ``When Tim (Dalton) cut his finger (during the making of
`Licence to Kill'), if we'd had to stop filming to take him to the
hospital, we would have lost at least half a day of filming. That
could mean anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000.
   ``But we had a doctor on the set who could stitch him up
immediately. We think Tim got better quality medical care and we
were able to go right on filming.''
   Lee Proimos, of Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., a Los
Angeles-based firm that insures 60 to 75 percent of all feature
films, said fast, effective medical care means fewer production
delays, reduced risk of lawsuits and lower insurance rates.
   ``It's a good situation for the actors, the crew and the
production company and it's good for the insurance company,''
Proimos said.
   Although his work appears to involve the glamour of Hollywood,
D'Orta says the LifeStar doctor is ``the one dose of reality in a
world of make-believe.''
