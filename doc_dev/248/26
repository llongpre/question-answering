<TEXT>  The movies' latest Robin Hood is played by a star people are comparing with
the film heroes of old, men like Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart. But Costner
has his own perspective on what heroism in the movies means. "The movies
represent what happens when the hero acts in the heat of dilemma, and that's
really what films are all about for me: dilemma," Costner told Us. "You're not
sure what the hero will do. We like to think that he will do the right thing.
And we admire the right thing -- in movies. We don't necessarily admire it in
our own world, because we know it's political suicide. . . . In real life, Mr.
Smith would never have gone to Washington. He would have been made to look
like the village idiot. He would have been locked up. It would be made out
that he hadn't paid his taxes and had eight affairs. He would be done. And he
would be the same man. Integrity is out of fashion. Maybe that's why we
respond to it in films." Costner has finished work on Oliver Stone's JFK, in
which he plays conspiracy theorist Jim Garrison -- whose integrity people have
been known to question.;  BROOKE SHIELDS; (box) Hey, Mom, let's double-date;
Her Brenda Starr film spent years on the shelf, and Brooke is now perhaps more
famous for being famous than for any achievements as an actress. Even her
modeling gigs are not a big deal anymore. She's made news by attending
Princeton and by dating George Michael and multimillionaire Dodi Fayed. But at
26, she's still under the watchful eye of her mother, Teri, who accompanied
her to an interview with Garth Pearce. Mom, Brooke said, "is the most
important person in my life. We do everything together." That must put some
limitations on her love life, no? "She's better at choosing my boyfriends than
I am myself," Brooke says. "When I see someone I really like I give her the
eye that inquires, 'What do you think?' I can never remember a time when I
really liked someone and she did not.";  TIMOTHY DALTON; (box) From James
Bond, with relief; Dalton co-starred with Brooke Shields in Brenda Starr and
has a part in The Rocketeer, but is better known as the latest James Bond. And
like others who've played that part, he knows how it can affect your life. He
tries not to let it get to him, he told Premiere. "A film isn't real; it is
artifice. The thing is a piece of pretend. actors who become their characters
-- why, it's absurd. I believe it's real at the moment of working, but, I
mean, I know it's not. To go round as Bond after I leave the set -- why, the
next step would be the lunatic asylum." Still, that didn't stop Britain's
tabloids from running a report that he received a death threat while filming
Licence to Kill in Mexico: "I suppose they thought it was fun, a death threat
made to James Bond, but it wasn't fun for my mother, who read about it. My
mother still believes it, and thinks I've been lying to make her feel
better.";  GEENA DAVIS; (box) Another learning experience; Davis used to tell
people that she saw herself and Jeff Goldblum as like Hume Cronyn and Jessica
Tandy. Not that Cronyn and Tandy ever made films like The Fly and Earth Girls
Are Easy, of course, but they represented a working marriage. Now Davis and
Goldblum are phfft. "Well, yeah, who knows?" she said when the Los Angeles
Times asked her about it. "Obviously one hopes for the best and one enters
relationships hoping for the best . . . but some things don't work out. . . .
I just feel in general that whatever happens in life is not only for your life
good and right and appropriate and a learning experience, but you can use it
in your work too." That puts a new spin on Thelma and Louise if you want to
think about it.  </TEXT>
