<TEXT>     The KGB? The CIA? The SNP?;   SNP?;   Well, maybe "paymaster" is a bit
strong.;   "We could never afford to pay Sean Connery," said Alex Salmond. "He
did it because he has been a long-term sympathizer over many years. Now he's
turned that sympathy into active support.";   Sean Connery established the
film role of Ian Fleming's super-spy, James Bond, Agent 007, licensed to kill.
For years, he portrayed the randy English spy with a taste for vodka martinis
(stirred, not shaken), ever prepared to give his all for queen and country.;  
But which country, exactly?;   Scotland, it seems. Connery has shown his true
colors by making a television broadcast on behalf of the Scottish National
Party, urging Scots to transfer their loyalties from London to the ideal of an
independent Scotland.;   The party, which just concluded its convention in
Inverness, was jubilant. Connery is the world's most famous Scot. He is very
popular back home. SNP membership applications shot up by more than a
thousand.;   "That is a substantial increase," said Salmond, head of the
party. Connery's support for Scottish independence may have been the best
thing to happen for the cause since Scotland surrendered its sovereignty in
the Act of Union with England in 1707, a sovereignty that at least some people
have been trying to reclaim ever since.;   Salmond hopes the support for the
SNP created by Connery's coming in from the cold can be translated into
concrete advances, maybe even an increase in the number of seats the party
holds in the British House of Commons -- now five of the 72 seats for
Scotland.;   The SNP is the third-largest party in Scotland. The Labor Party
commands the allegiance of 43 percent of Scots, the governing Conservatives 25
percent, SNP 19 percent and the Liberal Democrats 11 percent.;   But that
doesn't mean the SNP's message is without appeal. In fact, polls show that 37
percent of Scots favor independence from Britain. Salmond's task is to get
those people to join or actively support the SNP.;   "If we get that," he
said, "then we can negotiate independence from England. We're talking about
real independence, of taking our place as a separate nation within the
European community.";   Connery's independence instincts, heretofore subdued,
were apparently stimulated when he visited Edinburgh in June and was honored
as one of the sons of the city. The actor was born in nearby Leith.  </TEXT>
