   Diana Rigg started her acting career in
Shakespeare, but she will be forever known as the exotically
beautiful, black-leather-clad counterspy on the British series ``The
Avengers.''
   Although that was more than 20 years ago, her stint as Mrs. Emma
Peel was unforgetable. Since then, other than a short-lived and
unmemorable American sitcom in 1973-74 called ``Diana,'' she has
rarely been seen in this country.
   Rigg makes up for it this season as she succeeds Vincent Price as
host of ``Mystery!'' on PBS at the start of the new season on
Thursday, Oct. 12. The show is an anthology of the best English
mysteries.
   ``I don't think there will be a major difference other than the
question of our personalities,'' she said on a visit to this country
to promote the show and tape her appearances at WGBH in Boston.
   ``Mystery!'' is noted for Edward Gorey's Gothic steel engravings
for the title sequences, and Gorey has designed a new black and
white set for the host that has a one-dimensional look.
   ``I'm not playing a part. I am myself. I suppose it will evolve,
but it's always dangerous to speak up front. I'd rather wait and
see. My job is to introduce each show. For those who know the
characters it's an affirmation and for those who don't it's an
explanation.
   ``Plus, we'll also take a wider approach to the subject at hand.
For example, we'll talk about the rules of law as they developed in
England for the `Rumpole of the Bailey' series. I like the idea of
giving a tidge of information.''
   Rigg recently completed a miniseries for the BBC called ``Mother
Love'' that may show up on ``Mystery!'' It's a decidedly different
role from Emma Peel.
   ``It's the story of a woman who brings up her son by herself
after her divorce,'' she said. ``She loves her son passionately and
believes he's never seen his father in the years since the divorce.
But the father and son carry on a deception, and when the mother
finds out, murder and mayhem ensue.''
   She plays the mother, David McCallum (``Man From U.N.C.L.E.'') is
the father and the son is James Wilby, who stars in a new version of
``A Tale of Two Cities'' for ``Masterpiece Theatre'' this season.
   ``The Avengers,'' British television's version of James Bond,
starred Patrick Macnee as a suave secret agent in a bowler. It was
witty, absurd and diabolical. His first female partner was Honor
Blackman, who left to play Pussy Galore in the Bond movie
``Goldfinger.'' Rigg was his partner, Emma Peel, when the show began
its run on ABC in 1966. She stayed with it two years, then was
replaced by Linda Thorson. It left ABC in 1969, but was later seen
on late-night on CBS.
   ``It was a very stylistic show and it set the tone for a lot that
followed,'' she said. ``It certainly set the pattern for women as
equal partners. James Bond hasn't reached that yet. It was ahead of
its time and quite original for television.
   ``Emma Peel saw herself as the equal of any man. She could
compete without being strident. Patrick and I chose a very
tongue-in-cheek approach. That made it more fun for us and more
believable for the audience. There's no question that people
remember me most for `The Avengers,' but one has to move on. You
don't expect an artist to paint the same picture over and over.''
   Rigg played a Spanish contessa in the 1969 Bond film ``On Her
Majesty's Secret Service.'' It was the only movie in which 007 got
married and in which George Lazenby played Bond. She and Price, her
predecessor on ``Mystery!'' were in ``Theatre of Blood'' in 1973.
   Rigg, who is married to British producer Archie Sterling, said
she has tapered off her career since the birth of her daughter 12
years ago. Still, she was in a new version of ``Witness for the
Prosecution'' for CBS and recently was on the stage in London in
``Follies.''
