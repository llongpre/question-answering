Tobacco companies that pay to have their cigarettes displayed prominently in 
major motion pictures -- as in "Superman II," "Supergirl" and the upcoming 
James Bond movie, "License to Kill" -- may be breaking the law if the movies 
are shown on TV or without a health warning, a congressman charged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Thomas Luken (D-Ohio) called the promotional spots in movies, which he 
said amount to paid advertisement, a violation of congressional bans against 
cigarette advertisement on television or elsewhere without a health warning by 
the surgeon general. 
</P>
<P>
Luken, chairman of the House subcommittee on transportation and hazardous 
materials, said tobacco company Phillip Morris agreed to pay $350,000 to the 
makers of "License to Kill" to have Lark cigarettes used in the film as one of 
James Bond's secret weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco companies are on the attack seeking to increase their power and 
influence while continuing to recruit new addicts to the smoking habit," Luken 
said. "These movies reportedly do not carry the surgeon general's warning (and) 
the movies are shown on television, which is absolutely prohibited by law." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Phillip Morris called Luken's press conference "an attempt to 
curtail people who make artistic decisions," and said the "film maker has 
absolute discretion as to the content of the film and we stand behind that 
100%." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Taylor, director of communications for Phillip Morris, said that in the 
last 10 years, her company has only paid for movie promotions twice and 
defended the James Bond deal by saying that the movie is being produced outside 
the United States and will be distributed internationally. 
</P>
<P>
However, Luken called that argument "the usual evasion" and predicted it would 
not hold up in court if the case were brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Luken said he has written a letter to U. S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh asking 
him to consider "prosecution of those persons and companies involved in 
contracting for blatant advertising of cigarettes in movies." 
</P>
<P>
The letter requests that the attorney general investigate whether federal laws 
are being broken and to determine what steps, if any, could be taken to stop 
the activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that paying to have a particular cigarette appear in a movie is in 
fact an advertisement," he said in the letter. "I request that you investigate 
these payments." 
</P>
<P>
No one at the Justice Department was available for comment on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of paying for visibility in movies has become fairly common in 
recent years, most notably in the smash success "E.T.," where Reese's Pieces 
candies were prominently displayed. 
</P>
<P>
But Luken said that deals involving tobacco products violate laws that do not 
apply to other products. "It is a federal crime to violate any provision of the 
Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertisement Act," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In "License to Kill," Luken said, James Bond uses Lark cigarettes as a secret 
weapon, while a spokesman for the Coalition on Smoking or Health said that 
"Lois Lane smokes constantly" in the Superman movie.
