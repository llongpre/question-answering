   Videocassettes of Rambo and James Bond movies and
Western news clippings of the Chernobyl nuclear accident were among
``ideological contraband'' seized from foreigners by Soviet
customs, Tass reported Thursday.
   The official news agency did not say exactly when or over what
time period the seizures of pamphlets, books and videocassettes
took place, only that separate incidents were involved. The
dispatch was based on an article in Whistle, a newspaper of the
railroad ministry.
   Among the confiscated material were 500 ``anti-Soviet''
publications taken from two British students, identified only as D.
Warrowsmith and D. Dows. Tass said the two were at the Brest
checkpoint in Byelorussia on the Polish border when the material
was discovered.
   ``The subversive literature had been supplied to them by a
`charity' organization concerned about the alleged `suppression' of
(religious) believers,'' Tass said.
   Tass said the two had planned to distribute the material in
Minsk and Moscow, where they were headed on tourist visas.
   Under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
openness, many formally banned authors have been published in the
Soviet Union and state-run media have tackled previously taboo
subjects. But the Tass announcement of the seizures made it clear
glasnost does not extend to material considered ``ideological
contraband.''
   Another case described in the Tass report involved a woman
identified as N. Bashkatoff of Belgium. She allegedly was carrying
several leaflets and clippings from ``the bourgeois press with
fabrications about the Chernobyl accident, concealed in her
luggage.''
   ``She also attempted absent-mindedly to leave behind in her
train compartment a maliciously slanderous book called `Moscow
Quadrille,''' Tass said.
   Another tourist, who was not identified, was caught carrying
dozens of copies of ``People on the March,'' a pamphlet which
authorities say urges Soviets of ethnic German origin to emigrate
to West Germany.
   ``Some of the latest items of ideological contraband include
video recordings of various sermons, karate lessons, with a
sadistic bent, pornography and anti-Soviet films like `Rambo' or
the James Bond `Afghan Series,''' the dispatch said.
   The latter was apparently a reference to the James Bond movie
``The Living Daylights,'' in which the fictional British agent 007,
played by Timothy Dalton, outwits the Soviet army in Afghanistan.
   Soviet officials have bitterly complained that Sylvester
Stallone's muscled Vietnam War veteran Rambo presents a negative
stereotype of Soviets.
   The report from Tass said people carrying material judged to be
ideological contraband will be deported from the Soviet Union.
