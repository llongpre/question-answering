   George Meegan went out for a stroll and walked
right into the Guinness Book of World Records.
   Meegan appeared at the Guinness World of Records exhibit on
Tuesday to receive a certificate honoring his walk through the
Americas _ a 19,017-mile jaunt that took seven uears and four
months and was completed in 1983.
   Meegan, a resident of Kent, England, is the author of ``The
Longest Walk: An Odyssey of the Human Spirit.'' He walked from the
tip of South America to the end of Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, crossing
14 countries.
   While receiving the certificate, he also gave his boots to the
Guinness exhibit. He then delighted the crowd by showing off the
tattoo on his leg, a map of his route.

   Four teen-agers say they have unraveled the
mystery behind a stolen powder blue chiffon dress belonging to the
pop singer Madonna. But police say they aren't sure if the teens'
story is ``true blue.''
   The dress was taken Friday evening from a mall display sponsored
by the cable music station MTV and awaits identification by
officials from the exhibit, Detective Ralph Fluhart said on Tuesday.
   Fluhart said the teen-agers told police they found the dress in
the bushes near the mall on the night of the theft.
   But he said their story leaves some unanswered questions, such
as why the dress didn't appear soiled or to have been wet, although
it was raining the night of the theft.
   ``It was in the same condition it was in when it was stolen,''
Fluhart said.
   The pop singer wore the low-cut sequined frock in the video for
the song ``True Blue.'' She donated it for MTV's Museum of
Unnatural History, currently traveling across the country.

   Actress Barbara Stanwyck recently
spent 2{ weeks in the hospital for a back problem that has plagued
her for the past 25 years, her publicist said.
   Miss Stanwyck, who turned 81 on Saturday, was released earlier
this month from St. John's Medical Center where she was admitted
for treatment of the recurring back ailment, spokesman Larry Kleno
said on Tuesday.
   ``She still has 10 fractured vertebrae which flare up from time
to time,'' he said. ``When the pain gets so excruciating, she goes
to the hospital for heat pack treatment.''
   Miss Stanwyck originally injured her back while performing her
own horse riding and other stunts in films and during the 1960s
television show ``The Big Valley.''
   Miss Stanwyck was nominated four times for Academy Awards and
received an honorary Oscar in 1982 for the body of her work. She
has won three television Emmy Awards.

Australian costume designer Jennifer Anne Arnott aboard a yacht in
Sydney, but work soon called the newlyweds to different continents,
according to his publicist.
   Dennehy, 50, and the former Miss Arnott, 31, were married Sunday
aboard the American yacht Vim, publicist Nancy Seltzer said Tuesday.

Harbor.

   Jonathon ``Chico'' DeBarge pleaded
innocent to charges he was involved in a cocaine trafficking ring,
a week after the pop singer was dropped from an anti-drug telethon.
   DeBarge, 22, was arraigned Monday on the drug charges. If
convicted, he faces a maximum of life imprisonment and a $4 million
fine.
   U.S. Magistrate Hugh W. Brenneman Jr. allowed DeBarge to remain
free on a $400,000 bond pending a pretrial conference in two weeks.
   Jeffrey Kildow, head of the local U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, said DeBarge, his brother, Robert, and five other
men brought large quantities of cocaine from California to sell in
Michigan.
   Robert DeBarge, arrested last week in California, is to be freed
on a $50,000 bond.
   Last weekend, DeBarge was dropped from the Los Angeles Sheriff's
Department anti-drug telethon following his arrest.
   The telethon was to raise money for the Substance Abuse
Narcotics Education program, or SANE, which is a 3-year-old project
to teach elementary school children how to avoid drugs.
