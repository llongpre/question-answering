<HEAD>Actor Who Played ``Goldfinger'' Dead At 75</HEAD>

   German actor Gert Froebe, a gifted
comic who became famous as the gold-craving criminal in the 1964
James Bond film ``Goldfinger,'' died of a heart attack Monday. He
was 75.
   Froebe was born Karl-Gerhard Froebe on Feb. 25, 1913, in Planitz
in what is now East Germany. He was a natural-born comic, described
by critics as Germany's version of American Danny Kaye.
   Froebe played in nearly 100 films, including roles in the 1961
U.S. production ``The Longest Day,'' and the British-produced ``The
Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines,'' filmed in 1964.
   But he was best known internationally for his role as the greedy
villain ``Goldfinger'' who battled Sean Connery's James Bond in the
film version of the Ian Fleming thriller.
   In 1965, Froebe made headlines when he was quoted by the British
newspaper Daily Mail, as saying: ``Naturally I was a Nazi'' during
the Third Reich.
   Froebe denied making the comment and insisted: ``What I told an
English reporter during an interview ... was that during the Third
Reich I had the luck to be able to help two Jewish people, although
I was a member of the (Nazi) party.''
   Despite Froebe's denial, Israel banned all of his films for
months until a Jewish man, Mario Blumenau, informed the Israeli
Embassy in Vienna that Froebe hid Blumenau and his mother from the
Nazis.
   In a statement issued Monday, Froebe's agent Pal Berkovicsa said
the stocky actor died of a heart attack at 1 a.m. in a Munich
hospital, where he underwent an operation after suffering a heart
attack a week ago.
   Froebe studied theater under Dresden actor Erich Ponto and Paul
Guenther in Berlin during the early years of Adolf Hitler's Third
Reich.
   After theaters were closed by the Nazis in September 1944,
Froebe was called into the German army, where he served until the
end of World War II.
   In his first major role in a film, ``Berlin Ballads,'' which
opened in European cinemas in 1948, film critics wrote: ``Germany
has a new Danny Kaye.''
   Froebe is survived by his fifth wife, Karin. He has two sons by
previous marriages, Utz and Andreas.
