<LEADPARA>  'THE Marrying Man," from Disney, starring those tempestuous show-offs, Alec
Baldwin and Kim Basinger, isn't exactly setting the world on fire. In the
words of industry smarties, the film is already "bound for video.";    Baldwin
and Basinger were the objects of much-heated gossip during the making of this
movie and they also scored somewhat negatively when they appeared as
presenters on the Oscars. Now, Baldwin has given a blistering interview for
the May 16 issue of Us magazine in which he takes off on Hollywood ethics
generally and Disney in particular. He tells writer Leslie Van Buskirk: "With
most people in this town, you could rape their mother and set her on fire, but
if we close the deal, shoot the movie and it's a hit, hey, let's get out there
and sell this picture!"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He adds, "I don't think Disney knows . . . about making movies. They can
sell movies, but I think they know less than anyone else in Los Angeles about
the making of films. It was a terrible, terrible experience making a film for
Disney. Of course, that's based on my experience. I have to throw that in a
lot. Credit that to my lawyer.";    Having dug a hole for himself with
Disney's powerful execs, Baldwin continues: "I want to do great acting roles
for me. I don't give a . . . what Mike Ovitz thinks about me. I care what Mike
Ovitz's gardener thinks of me.";    As you know, if you haven't been under a
rock, Mike Ovitz is chief agent at CAA, a mover and shaker.;    I hope Baldwin
is taking a course in landscape gardening on the side. It never hurts to have
an alternate career when you are making a career out of insulting those who
hire, fire and exert influence.;    BY THE BOOK: Gen. Colin L. Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will offer his first written
appreciation of the men and women who served in the gulf war -- by writing the
foreword to a new book about the Allied victory.;    Random House publishes
"Triumph in the Desert: The Challenge, the Fighting, the Legacy" on Memorial
Day.;    HEAVENLY ROLE: Maybe you read in Variety about how Robert Evans is
going to make a big comeback producing "The Saint" from a Terry Hayes
screenplay, to be directed by Renny Harlin for Paramount.;    Evans has said
he is a long way from even thinking about casting. Evidently, there are others
in Hollywood who are thinking about saintly casting.;    I do mean Ted Hartley
and Dina Merrill, the new owners of RKO who are Mr. and Mrs. in private life.
While Evans owns the rights to 56 "Saint" properties, it seems Hartley and
Merrill found the rights to 11 other "Saints" in their own archives.;   
Perhaps you recall actor Pierce Brosnan was invited, a few years back, to play
James Bond in "The Living Daylights," but he could not get NBC to release him
from "Remington Steele." Timothy Dalton became the fourth 007. Now Brosnan is
talking to RKO about playing their "Saint." (If he gets the role, he'll follow
Roger Moore, who he could have succeeded as James Bond!)  </TEXT>
