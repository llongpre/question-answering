   Reclusive multimillionaire Doris Duke has
adopted a 35-year-old woman who has been living with her for three
years, her lawyer said.
   Miss Duke, 75, adopted Chandi Hefner, an ``environmentalist,
preservationist and conservationist'' who spends her time ``doing
things as a good citizen as Miss Duke does,'' attorney Donald A.
Robinson said Friday. The adoption took place Thursday.
   Miss Duke, who owns a walled, 2,700-acre estate in north-central
New Jersey, attracted publicity when she allowed Imelda Marcos to
take her private jet from Hawaii to New York to face federal
racketeering charges and posted bail for the former Philippines
first lady last week.
   Robinson said Miss Duke and Miss Hefner met socially in Hawaii
and New York, where Miss Duke also maintains homes.
   Miss Hefner, who also owns property in Hawaii, had been
``estranged from her family for a number of years,'' has never been
married and has no children, he said.
   Robinson would not comment on whether Miss Hefner would become
the heir of Miss Duke, who has been married twice and has no other
children.
   Miss Duke, the daughter of James B. Duke, the tobacco and
electric power magnate and benefactor of Duke University, has a
fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $800 million and by her
former business manager at $2.5 billion.

   Actor Timothy Dalton suffered a slight wrist
injury while filming a scene for the next James Bond film, ``License
Revoked.''
   In the scene, Bond, played by Dalton, had just been exposed as a
mole in a drug lord's cocaine laboratory and was supposed to dangle
from the end of a conveyor, his feet inches from a grinding machine.
   But during Thursday's shooting, Dalton's watch caught on a metal
hook as he flipped off the end of the conveyor, causing a slight
cut. Dalton completed the scene after a doctor patched the injury on
the set.
   In the movie, Bond's 007 license to kill is lifted by the British
secret service. Despite that, he goes after the drug lord, played by
actor Robert Davi, to avenge an assassination attempt on an American
CIA agent.

   Violinist Dmitri Sitkovetsky, who emigrated from
the Soviet Union to the United States 11 years ago, will give four
concerts in Moscow next month, his press agent said.
   The 34-year-old violinist will make his first return appearance
Dec. 19 with the Moscow Philharmonic at Tchaikovsky Hall. His
father, Julian, a noted violinist, gave his last performance at the
hall before his death in 1958.
   ``He has been invited back by the Moscow Philharmonic for a
memorial concert to mark the 30th anniversary of his father's
death,'' publicist Stephany Todd said Friday.
   Sitkovetsky has performed widely as a soloist with Western
symphony and chamber orchestras and since 1984 has been music
director of Finland's Korsholm Festival. He made his debut with the
Cleveland Orchestra in 1986.

   Gov. Thomas H. Kean plans to buy a weekend
house in the exclusive Pottersville section of Bedminster, the heart
of New Jersey fox hunting country, his spokesman said.
   The two-floor, nine-room masonry house with a barn and pond is
located in north-central New Jersey.
   ``The governor is very much an outdoors ... type,'' spokesman
Carl Golden said Friday. ``When he saw the opportunity to purchase a
property in an area that's still rather unspoiled, he took it.''
   Pottersville is part of the Somerset Hills area, whose rambling
mansions house such well known figures as former automaker John Z.
De Lorean and magazine publisher Malcolm Forbes.
   Golden said the price and seller would not be disclosed.
   Kean's choice of quarters has drawn intense interest since his
election in 1981. He was roundly criticized several years ago for
buying an island beach property in New York's Long Island Sound at
the same time he was appearing in television commercials extolling
the attractiveness of New Jersey's Atlantic Coast resorts.

   Mother Teresa called for more
love and peace in the world during a visit to an impoverished black
shantytown on the outskirts of this city.
   The 78-year-old nun and Nobel Peace Prize winner was warmly
received and her car was immediately surrounded by children when she
arrived Friday at Missionvale.
   ``Love is always a work of peace,'' she said. ``Many people
suffer from the poverty of love, even the rich.''
   Mother Teresa arrived in Port Elizabeth after spending three days
in Cape Town and selecting a site for a charity mission in
Khayelitsha, a black township outside that city.
   She has said she does not plan to establish any other missions on
her weeklong visit to South Africa.
