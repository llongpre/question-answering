The Man With the Golden Gun (ABC Sunday at 8:30 p.m.), the ninth James Bond 
adventure, is virtually interchangeable with its predecessors, except that the 
double-entendres seem broader than ever. This time Agent 007's (Roger Moore) 
chief nemesis is Christopher Lee, in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
Of Pure Blood (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a 1986 TV movie, starts out credibly but 
becomes routine and predictable. Based on the Nazis' infamous Lebensborn 
program, which paired SS "supermen" with Aryan women to produce a "master 
race," it stars Lee Remick as a German-born American woman confronted with her 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The four-hour 1987 TV movie Hands of a Stranger (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m., 
completed Monday at 9 p.m.) is a raw and terrifying nail-biter that captures 
some of the heat, passion and suspense of Robert Daley's best-selling story 
about a cop's obsession with his wife's mysterious rape. Armand Assante and 
Beverly D'Angelo star. 
</P>
<P>
Beach Party (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.), starring Frankie Avalon and Annette 
Funicello (natch), kicks off a week of American International "beach party" 
pictures of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
In Jumpin' Jack Flash (Channel 11 Monday at 8 p.m.) Whoopi Goldberg, cast as a 
computer whiz caught up in espionage, makes this 1986 feature seem lots hipper 
than it really is. 
</P>
<P>
The James Bond series got off to a rousing start in 1963 with Dr. No (ABC 
Monday at 9 p.m.), which found Sean Connery's incomparable 007 taking on his 
first master villain (Joseph Wiseman). 
</P>
<P>
Anne Bancroft and her husband Mel Brooks attempted a 1983 remake of Ernst 
Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) in an effort to at 
last work together. They play stars of their Warsaw acting company on the eve 
of the Nazi invasion. There are amusing moments scattered here and there, but 
the comedy-adventure misfires because Brooks lacks the crucial Lubitsch touch 
and because we know far more than in 1942 the full extent of the Nazi evil, 
especially in regard to the fate of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Sadie and Son (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is an overreaching 1987 TV movie that 
asks us to accept Debbie Reynolds as a Jewish New York cop who ends up teamed 
with her own son (Brian McNamara), a failed comedian. 
</P>
<P>
Dragnet (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is the entertaining 1954 feature which 
Jack Webb adapted from his long-running radio and TV series. 
</P>
<P>
The impressive 1982 TV movie World War III (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m., 
completed Friday at 8 p.m.) imagines a tense confrontation between the U.S. and 
the Soviet Union. Rock Hudson, David Soul and Brian Keith star. 
</P>
<P>
Grease (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.), that garish, amusing 1978 musical of 
high school life in the '50s, stars an appealing John Travolta and Olivia 
Newton-John. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara's Wife (Channel 7 Thursday at 9 p.m.) is a 1982 theatrical release that 
was better suited to TV in the first place. Edward Asner stars as a workaholic 
attorney opposite Mariette Hartley, struck fatally by a massive brain 
hemorrhage but who returns on a ghostly mission to urge Asner to start living 
before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
In the title role of Popeye (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.), Robin Williams is 
fun and so is Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl, but the Robert Altman film is 
nevertheless curiously lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
George C. Scott stars in the admirable 1986 TV movie version of The Murders in 
the Rue Morgue (CBS Friday at 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Jean Renoir's celebrated, panoramic 1938 La Marseillaise airs on Channel 24 
Friday at 9 p.m. and Channel 28 at 11 p.m. as a celebration of the 200th 
anniversary of Bastille Day. It depicts the turbulent events that took place 
between July 14, 1789 and Aug. 10, 1792, culminating in the defeat of the 
Prussian infantry. Pierre Renoir and Louis Jouvet star. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday brings two Sam Peckinpah pictures, the so-so World War I epic, Circle 
of Iron (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.) and the exciting, amoral The Getaway (Channel 13 
at 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Since Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason star in the amiable 1982 The Sting II (ABC 
Saturday at 9 p.m.), it's a good thing it's a variation of rather than a sequel 
to the Newman-Redford "Sting." 
</P>
<P>
S.O.B., Blake Edwards' always audacious, often hilarious and sometimes 
appalling, vitriolic Valentine to Hollywood, airs on Channel 9 Saturday at 10 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log 
listings service.
