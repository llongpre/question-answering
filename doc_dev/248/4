   Something there is about an actor who loves
the act of giving, so it was nice to find a bunch of ``Santa
Clauses'' running around the set of the new James Bond movie,
``License Revoked.''
   Timothy Dalton ``has been very giving as an actor,'' said Robert
Davi, forgetting for the moment that his villainous character spends
the last part of the movie trying to grind Dalton-Bond into cocaine
dust.
   ``I don't think you can create anything if you don't give,''
returned Dalton, who manages to give Davi's character a hole in the
head.
   ``He's very professional, very focused,'' said Carey Lowell of
Dalton, shortly after saving Bond from a fate worse than coke.
``It's better than working with somebody who doesn't give a damn.''
   Seriously, now.
   ``I would loathe a concept of work in which people are competing
with each other,'' said Dalton. ``I think it is a two-way process.
It is a game where you throw something at somebody and they throw it
back at you.''
   In other words, these actors say, this is how they work. They
have nothing to give but themselves, and that can be scary. But if
an actor holds back, if nothing is given, nothing can be thrown back.
   ``It's probably true that some actors see it as a competition,
but it seems very ungenerous to attempt to deny to another actor the
tools with which to work,'' Dalton said. ``I think if you look at
any really good actors, you'll find them all very giving.''
   Lowell, whose face has decorated the covers of Vogue and
Mademoiselle, understands that concept as one of the differences
between modeling and acting.
   ``It's different from modeling because you don't have to give to
the camera. You give to the actors instead,'' she said. And if you
give only to the camera? ``In a film, if you're static it shows
immediately. It's difficult.''
   To hear these people talk, you'd think making moving pictures was
fun, not long hours of work, intense concentration, weird
situations. Just what does an actor think about while hogtied on a
conveyor belt, waiting to be ground (almost) to magnesium dust
(that's what they use as a stand-in for cocaine).
   ``When you're in the thick of it you have to think of what to do
in the scene. You've got to be on form and on key and
concentrated,'' said Dalton.
   The effort to maintain concentration is why he has a reputation
for being difficult for outsiders to talk to on the set.
   ``If you can't get it right you don't get a moment to do it
again,'' he said. ``You just don't get a moment to do it again.''
   Now let's back up. The film is ``License Revoked,'' and it is due
for release in the summer. James Bond loses his license to kill and
goes off the reservation to avenge his friend, CIA agent Felix
Leiter, who gave his leg to some sharks with the help of ...
   Franz Sanchez (Davi), an evil drug lord modeled a little bit on
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, de facto ruler of Panama who has been
indicted on drug trafficking charges in the United States. He is
foiled with the help of ...
   Pam Bouvier (Lowell), a former pilot for the CIA who worked with
Leiter and who saves Bond and helps gift-wrap Sanchez at Mexico
City's Churusbusco Studios under the direction of John Glen.
   Dalton, 42, is a classically trained actor who has established
his ability to play all kinds of roles _ everything from
Shakespeare's ``Richard II'' to the male lead opposite Mae West in
``Sextette.''
   That range is the envy of Lowell and Davi, who would like to have
the opportunity to show that they, too, can change their spots.
   ``Unfortunately, I always have to play a beautiful girl. Now I
want to do something less stylish,'' the 27-year-old Lowell said.
   Davi, 35, would like to go up the style scale, not down, and to
that end he's trying to push the envelope on the Bond villain bit.
   ``This guy could be a friend who you think it'd be nice to have a
drink with, but after the last sip he stabs you. It kind of makes
him fun to play,'' said Davi.
   ``I want to make my mark in film,'' he said. ``I want to be an
international star. I want to get the girl without putting a gun to
her head. I'm looking for Mister Good-Guy.''
   Dalton thinks they've both got a chance:
   ``Everyone has to be good, because you want a good movie. It
would be stupid and destructive not to be a creative, giving actor.
It's how we work together.''
