<TEXT>  Putnam, 798 pp., $24.95;  IN EXERCISING his America-centric world view of
politics and firepower, Tom Clancy is a true capitalist. His latest novel
features the DDI of the CIA, a SAC of the FBI, the KGB, the Pentagon's NMCC
and some mobile SAMs and underwater UGMs with tolerable CEPs. At one point,
Clancy's recurrent hero, Jack Ryan, says, "OK, I want DO, DI, DS&amp;T in here
immediately," and then realizes, "I forgot about FOBS.";    Doubtless,
Clancy's followers will want to read this ASAP. (It's due in stores Aug. 7.)
The big question is: Will they be ready for the SEX?;     We're not talking
acronyms here, but mild acrobatics in the beds of various homes, hotels and
Air Force One. We're talking sentences like, "Her breasts dangled deliciously
before his eyes," and one memorable passage in which a woman at a formal
reception accuses another of being involved with a battery-operated device.;  
  Such scenes share center stage with more familiar motifs in Clancy's most
speculative, most ambitious and least polished piece of storytelling.;    "The
Sum of All Fears" is a post-glasnost tale of terrorism that postulates what
might happen if, in the middle of a period of international cooperation, a
nuclear device leveled part of a major American city.;    The final quarter of
the book, in which Ryan of the CIA battles to save the world from Armageddon,
is nearly breathless -- the pace Clancy fans have come to expect. But for the
meticulous Clancy to arrive at that snapping point -- where the deputy
director of the CIA can seize the hot-line to Moscow out of the hands of the
U.S. president -- requires 600 pages of groundwork and assorted fillings, some
of them painful. Be prepared, then, for several passages in which the
president exercises his virility with his female national security advisers
while the Ryan beefcake stock takes a dramatic plunge. There is also a long
and arguably unnecessary treatise on how one might arrive at a just peace in
the Middle East.;    Such is the fallout of glasnost.;    Clancy's
resourcefulness as a topical writer and forecaster of world events was
strained by the end of the Cold War. Strained but not defeated: Clancy has
taken glasnost at full value and concentrated on its likely consequences. What
happens to all the secret police of Eastern Europe who are suddenly
unemployed? To the terrorists who relied on them for sanctuary? To the
military weapons no longer cocked and aimed? To the soldiers responsible for
them? From these speculations and a few synthetic coincidences, Clancy
conceives a plot of renewed hatreds and terror.;    But to develop it, Clancy
is compelled to examine the motivations of his villains. That means leaving
the familiar stomping grounds of military orders and looking into the human
heart. It is a clunky business. For one of his villains, Clancy typically
writes: "How would he make them pay? Russell asked himself. He didn't know,
and really didn't know, and really didn't care. Just so there was something he
could do." The result could be an entry in a Robert Ludlum write-alike
competition.;    Literary hazards abound. Foremost is the question of
credibility. The details in Clancy's surprising first book, "The Hunt for Red
October," seemed so authentic that the author was questioned by federal agents
about his sources. But with the reappearance of Ryan and his friends in each
succeeding novel except "Red Storm Rising" (written while the character was
the focus of a copyright dispute), Clancy has been forced to compromise. The
expanding mythos of his characters has left less room for reality.;    "The
Sum of All Fears" overflows with figures from previous novels. Casual
allusions, such as to the execution of the Irish separatists from "Patriot
Games," soften the authenticity that has been Clancy's strongest asset. In
terms of self-indulgence, the world of Jack Ryan is still kilometers from that
of Ian Fleming's James Bond, but the distance is diminishing.;    Second is
the character of Ryan himself. Intelligent, arrogant, instinctive, insecure,
self-absorbed, gentle, loving, idealistic and occasionally murderous, Ryan
isn't an amalgam -- he's a thesaurus. Clancy likes him, if not as alter-ego
then at least as family. But no one should treat family the way Clancy treats
Ryan. For this latest reunion, he makes Ryan a heavy drinker (Fleming did the
same to Bond), and then he makes him an impotent lover (where Fleming never
dreamed of treading), setting up a strained subplot in which Cathy Ryan
suspects her husband of an extramarital affair.;    A considerable chunk of
novel follows this thread and a parallel one, about the president's own
private congresses, leading to the subtle suggestion that in the end, when the
planet is about to go up in flames, gland-standing counts for little. It is
suspected that with a less popular writer, the editor might have simply taken
one look and said "Forget it." But Clancy's "Clear and Present Danger" was the
best-selling work of fiction of the 1980s; for its follow-up, Clancy probably
would have been allowed to retain a love scene between a submarine commander
and a tuna sandwich.;    The most curious section of the novel, occupying most
of the opening, concerns Ryan's successful effort to broker an end to the
Palestinian-Israeli dispute. The simplicity of the solution and execution make
this the least convincing scenario of any of Clancy's books, but the author
may have felt the emotional need to include it anyway, as a counterbalance to
the most convincing portion: the one about the assembly of a hydrogen bomb.;  
 Clancy writes in great, though sometimes vague, detail about how Arab and
German terrorists construct a two-stage bomb. In the novel's afterword, Clancy
admits he was stunned by how easily he obtained these details himself. (He
deliberately obfuscated some of them, he says.) "The fact of the matter is
that a sufficiently wealthy individual could, over a period of from five to
ten years, produce a multistage thermonuclear device," he writes.;    With
such a prospect on one hand, and a history of happy endings for his novels on
the other, Clancy probably felt compelled to create optimism in the vision of
a Middle East at peace, a crossroads of tolerance like some modern-day
Ephesus. To borrow the words of another best-selling author, "tis a
consummation devoutly to be wished." Should this piece of Clancy forecasting
ever be fulfilled, the rest would be readily forgiven.  </TEXT>
