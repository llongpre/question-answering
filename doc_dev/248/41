   The restructuring of Engelhard Corp., the
metals and chemical company once headed by the supposed model for
James Bond nemesis Goldfinger, could mean higher profits and a
clearer corporate identity, analysts said Friday.
   Engelhard, a leading metals refiner and maker of gold and silver
products, says it is selling those businesses to concentrate on
chemical production and its promise of higher profit margins.
   The Iselin-based concern also has announced a restructuring that
will shed 500 salaried jobs from its 8,100-member workforce and
shut a number of plants worldwide.
   Engelhard stock fell $1.12{ a share to $20.37{ on the New York
Stock Exchange Friday.
   The restructuring announced Thursday prompted Engelhard to take
a $160 million charge on 1989 earnings, giving it a $77.5 million
loss for the year. Fourth quarter losses were $145.9 million
compared with a $19.3 million profit a year earlier.
   Revenue for the year rose $52 million, to $2.4 billion.
Engelhard spokesman Francis X. Vitale Jr. said the restructuring
and sale of businesses should pare away 35 percent of its revenue.
   Thomas Van Leeuwen, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York, said the restructuring was overdue and that the
company's performance had stagnated in the past five years.
   Engelhard's performance has been hurt by a diversion of
management attention to its electronics business and by competition
from other major makers of catalysts, such as W.R. Grace and Union
Carbide, Van Leeuwen said. Catalysts are used in petroleum refining
and chemical manufacturing.
   Cyclical changes in refining also have hurt. With increased
amounts of lighter grade crude oil coming on the market, smaller
amounts of catalysts are needed to break the oil down into
petroleum products such as gasoline, said analyst Jeff Cianci of
Bear Stearns &amp; Co. in New York.
   Shedding the metals business could help focus attention on the
operations that actually constitute Engelhard's main business,
possibly giving investors a better idea of the company's prospects.
   ``Investors have mistaken the true identity of this company in
the past,'' said Van Leeuwen. Many do not realize it does not
produce gold and silver but only makes products from them, and also
that it has substantial chemical operations, he said.
   Engelhard does have the nation's largest gold and silver product
manufacturing plant, located in Plainville, Mass.
   The company was founded in Newark in 1902 by Charles W.
Engelhard Sr. after he bought the Charles Croselmire Co. and began
acquiring specialty metals firms. His son, Charles W. Engelhard
Jr., greatly expanded its operations.
   The wealthy Engelhard Jr., known as the ``platinum king,'' also
was a friend of James Bond creator Ian Fleming, and supposedly
served as an inspiration for the character of the villain
Goldfinger.
   Engelhard was a portly figure who often carried an ebony cane,
and would joke with friends about his identification with the spy
story villain, according to a 1971 obituary.
   Goldfinger might not recognize Engelhard Corp. based on its
remaining businesses.
   For sale are its gold and silver refining and fabrication
businesses; metal joining operations; electronic chemicals section,
which provides precious metals to electronic circuitry makers;
crystals business, which supplies makers of radiation detectors;
and part of its jewelry products business.
   Businesses it will keep include its platinum group, which makes
components of catalytic convertors for cars; its profitable
precious metal trading operation; its chemical and petroleum
catalysts group; and its additives and pigment business.
