   Actor Willem Dafoe agrees his portrayal of
Jesus in Martin Scorsese's new film ``The Last Temptation'' is not
typical biblical movie fare.
   ``This is a deeply religious movie for Marty,'' said Dafoe.
``It's not a debunking; it's not a riff. It's a way to articulate
his deep feelings.
   ``Sure, part of the idea was to humanize Christ. It's short on
heavenly angels. But, in the end, it's triumphant in the way people
who subscribe to the Jesus story want it to be,'' Dafoe said in an
interview published Thursday in the Los Angeles Times.
   The film, which opens nationwide Friday, has drawn denunciations
from conservative Christian groups. Based on a novel by Nikos
Kazantzakis, the movie includes such scenes as Jesus dreaming of
making love to Mary Magdalene.

   Amy Carter, daughter of former President
Jimmy Carter, has been accepted for enrollment this fall at Memphis
College of Art, the school's president said.
   ``She picked a school and ... we lie in her area of interests,''
President John Slorp said in Thursday's editions of The (Memphis)
Commercial Appeal. The paper said she is interested in art, ballet,
movies, the violin and reading. School officials weren't sure what
she would study.
   Miss Carter, 21, has been involved in protests against the CIA,
apartheid and world hunger. She was arrested at the South African
Embassy in Washington in 1985.
   A former Brown University student, Miss Carter has denied
reports that she was expelled or dismissed from that school for
academic or other reasons. ``They told me to take a semester off. I
wasn't expelled. I don't have to reapply ... to get back in,'' she
said in December.

   Rock musician Gene Simmons of the heavy metal
band Kiss says he is too busy getting the group ready for the road
to play a villain in the new James Bond movie ``License Revoked.''
   Simmons, a founding member of the glitter-rock band once known
for its alter-ego makeup, begged out of a job offer from film
producer Cubby Broccoli. The bass player cited concert commitments
to the European version of the International Monsters of Rock Tour,
said publicist David Brokaw.
   The Bond film, featuring Timothy Dalton in his second appearance
as the elusive agent 007, begins shooting in Mexico in September,
Brokaw said.
   Simmons enthralled Kiss fans worldwide in the 1970s with onstage
antics that included breathing fire and spitting fake blood. For
years band members refused to show their faces in public or be
photographed without their trademark black-and-white makeup.
   Still known for its raunchy musical style and irreverent lyrics,
Kiss will play its first club date in 15 years in New York on
Friday, Brokaw said.

   For the third straight
summer the prince and princess of Wales have taken their young sons
to visit ``the Spains'' _ as they call the Spanish royal family.
   Prince Charles, Diana, and sons William, 6, and Harry, 4,
arrived Thursday on a Royal Air Force jet, said an airport official
who did not want to be identified.
   The British royalty were greeted at the airport by Crown Prince
Felipe, heir to the Spanish throne, who drove them to meet King
Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia at their Marivent Palace summer
residence on this Mediterranean island, the official said.
   Spanish press reports said the holiday was originally to last 10
days but may be shortened so Charles and Diana can attend the
christening of their yet-unnamed niece born Aug. 8 to the duke and
duchess of York.
   Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is scheduled in October to
become the first British head of state to visit Spain. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher plans a September visit.
