   After nine years of white socks and a charming
bunkside manner as the cruise boat doctor on ``The Love Boat,''
Bernie Kopell is up to no good in the ABC movie ``Get Smart, Again!''
   Kopell is back as Conrad Siegfried, still with KAOS, still
plugging evil and terror, still trying to take over the world, still
being thwarted by Agent 86 from CONTROL.
   Agent 86 was better known as Maxwell Smart, Siegfried's American
nemesis. The truth is they were both a couple of dim bulbs, but
Smart, aided by his brainy and beautiful colleague, Agent 99, always
managed to muddle through.
   Nearly the entire original cast from the ``Get Smart'' series,
which ran from 1965 to '70, first on NBC and then on CBS, is back
for the two-hour movie on Sunday _ Don Adams as Maxwell Smart,
Barbara Feldon as Agent 99, Dick Gautier as Hymie, Dave Ketchum as
Agent 13, Robert Karvelas as Larrabee, and King Moody as Shtarker.
Kenneth Mars takes over as chief of CONTROL in place of Edward
Platt, who died in 1974.
   In ``Get Smart, Again!'' KAOS kidnaps a scientist to obtain his
secret formula for creating a weather machine. Siegfried and his
henchman Shtarker demand a ransom of $250 billion.
   Neither KAOS nor CONTROL stood for anything, the way U.N.C.L.E.,
for instance, stood for United Network Command for Law and
Enforcement on ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' Their nemesis was THRUSH.
   KAOS ought to stand for Kopell's Acts of (Comic) Subversion.
   ``Siegfried is more fun than anything I've done in my life,''
said Kopell. ``I could let loose. Is there a comedy of anger?
Siegfried always appears to be angry. In the movie, KAOS has been
taken over by a corporate raider, which only adds to Siegfried's
anger and frustration.''
   ``Get Smart'' was a spoof of James Bond and it gave no quarter as
it milked its laughs from sendups of secret agents, disguises,
codes, technological gadgets and monolithic intelligence
organizations. The series was created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry.
   ``It was biting, incisive and stepped on a few toes,'' said
Kopell. ``We got a couple of good shots at the government. It didn't
pussyfoot around the way some other shows did. It took a few swipes
at some sacred cows.''
   Kopell has been a regular or a recurring character on eight
series. At the same time he was on ``Get Smart,'' he was on ``That
Girl,'' starring Marlo Thomas.
   ``I never had a contract for either show,'' he said. ``I got to
know the assistant directors over at `That Girl,' and I'd call over
and say, `Look, I'm not working Tuesday and Wednesday.' And they'd
set up all my scenes for those days. Marlo Thomas did `That Girl,'
and she was the best boss I ever had. She was very generous, very
supportive.''
   He was also on ``The Steve Allen Show,'' ``The Danny Kaye Show,''
``The Doris Day Show,'' ``Bewitched,'' ``The Love Boat'' and ``When
Things Were Rotten.'' The latter, in which he played Alan-a-Dale in
a Robin Hood spoof, was also created by Mel Brooks. Things were
really rotten because it lasted only a few weeks.
   Kopell also supplied some of the voices for the Saturday morning
series ``Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp,'' a cartoon spoof of James
Bond. The good chimps belonged to A.P.E. and the bad chimps, led by
the Baron (Kopell), belonged to C.H.U.M.P.
   His longest-running series and the only time he was ever cast in
a romantic role was ``The Love Boat.'' He played the ship's doctor,
Adam Bricker.
   ``I was always a character actor,'' he said. ``I couldn't believe
it when I got the role. It was wonderful. I'm grateful, but I never
knew how it happened. I was cast when Dick Van Patten pulled out
after doing the pilots to do ``Eight Is Enough.'''
   Kopell credits producer Leonard Stern with casting him as
Siegfried in ``Get Smart.''
   ``There was no reason why a 33-year-old kid would get the part,''
he said. ``But Leonard had seen me playing an immigrant in `The 49th
Dozen' at the Players Ring. He sent me a sweet letter and said we'd
work together sometime. Two years later he called me to play
Siegfried. He asked me if I could do the accent. I lied and said of
course I could.
   ``Makeup made me look very old. They put a fencing scar on my
left cheek. I was a baby-faced kid. I remember being unhappy
whenever the makeup came off. I was me again.''
