'PROTECT CHILDREN ACT' AIMS TO BAN CIGARETTE DEALS IN FILM

Legislation has been introduced in Congress to ban youth-oriented cigarette 
advertising, including payments to film makers to feature specific cigarette 
brands in their movies. 
</P>
<P>
Paid "product placement" deals, calling for brand-name merchandise to be shown 
in films, are a legal and potentially large source of revenue for movie 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
But paying to have cigarettes placed in movies is "a subtle technique by the 
merchants of addiction to get young people to smoke," Rep. Tom Luken (D-Ohio) 
said in introducing the bill last week. The proposed legislation is being 
co-sponsored by Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Bob Whittaker (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
Luken also said paid 
</P>
<P>
placement of cigarettes in films "has the effect of circumventing the federal 
ban on cigarette advertising on television" when movies appear on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies say they shy away from product placement deals precisely to 
avoid charges like the one Luken made. 
</P>
<P>
But in filing the bill last week, Luken, who chairs the House transportation 
and hazardous materials subcommittee, said a preliminary inquiry has turned up 
three instances in which cigarette makers did pay to feature their brands in 
recent films. 
</P>
<P>
In response to questions from Luken, Liggett Group Inc. said in a letter that 
it paid $30,000 in 1983 to have its Eve cigarette brand appear in the movie 
"Supergirl" -- although the company's policy since has been to "not pay for 
product to be used in films." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris Cos., the No. 1 U.S. tobacco company and maker of the Marlboro 
brand that is the world's largest seller, disclosed two cases in which payments 
were made to feature cigarettes in foreign-made films destined for United 
States and foreign audiences. In a Feb. 24 letter, the company said these were 
the only cases it had discovered "based upon our review thus far." 
</P>
<P>
In the first case, more than $40,000 was paid in 1979 for Marlboro to appear in 
"Superman II." And the company's Tokyo-based advertising agency agreed last 
fall to pay $350,000 to showcase Lark cigarettes in "License Revoked," a new 
James Bond film shot primarily in Mexico. Lark is actually a Liggett brand, but 
Philip Morris owns the rights to the brand overseas, including in Japan, where 
the James Bond character is especially popular. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Philip Morris said, it has been providing free cigarettes 
or advertising signs for an average of 17 films per year, but without paying 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a Philip Morris spokesman told The Times that the company 
had not paid to place its cigarettes in movies "for at least 10 years," but 
said he was not sure this applied to all foreign subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the No. 2 cigarette maker, told Luken it does not 
pay film makers to feature its brands, a policy "we believe . . . has been 
adhered to" at least since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Devaney, director of product placement at Rogers &amp; Cowan Inc., a 
public relations firm, said Reynolds "is the one account that I don't pursue 
any placements for." He said that when film makers request cigarettes for 
movies rated "R" or "PG-13," "I give them product and that's it. . . . If they 
come to me and they want my brand, I'm certainly going to say OK." 
</P>
<P>
The issue is a sensitive one for the cigarette makers, who were helped in 
decades past by a flood of endorsements from glamorous stars. The companies say 
they do not target adolescents through movies or other media, and that they 
advertise only to lure smokers of other brands -- not to induce non-smokers to 
start. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have long accused the companies of using popular entertainment to 
market their brands to youth. With nearly all new smokers taking up the habit 
while still in their teens, critics say the cigarette makers must target youth 
to replace the 2 million smokers who annually quit or die. 
</P>
<P>
An aide said Luken will press the cigarette companies for more specifics on 
their product placement policies. For example, some firms that said they 
currently do not pay to get their brands in movies did not provide information 
back to 1979, as Luken requested. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation to ban all forms of cigarette advertising and promotion went 
nowhere in the last session of Congress. The Luken bill, dubbed "The Protect 
Our Children From Cigarettes Act of 1989," takes a less sweeping approach. It 
would permit text-only advertising on billboards and in print media, with no 
pictures other than the cigarette pack. However, cigarette billboards would be 
banned from sports arenas, vending machine sales would be barred in places 
accessible to adolescents and payments to feature cigarettes in movies would be 
banned. 
</P>
<P>
Luken said he was not trying "to restrict in any way an artistic decision to 
have a smoking scene in a movie." But he said that decision "should not be 
influenced by the lure of large cash payments." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, declined 
comment, saying through a spokeswoman he was studying the bill.
