   He was an explorer, a thrillseeker, a womanizer,
insatiably curious, painfully opinionated and, maybe, a spy.
   Disguised, he was the first Westerner to visit Mecca, and he led
the first white man's expedition to Africa's Lake Tanganyika.
   ``Sir Richard Francis Burton was the James Bond of the 19th
century,'' says author Edward Rice.
   But unlike Agent 007, Burton really existed.
   Rice's new biography, ``Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton, The
Secret Agent Who Made the Pilgrimage to Mecca, Discovered the Kama
Sutra and brought the Arabian Nights to the West,'' is a surprise
best seller, making its way to non-fiction Top 10 lists.
   A British edition of the Rice biography is being prepared, and
Rice says he recently started negotiations for translations into
German, Spanish and Japanese.
   The book charts ``Ruffian Dick'' from his peripatetic childhood
in France, England and Italy, through his Arabian and African
adventures, until his restless final years in Trieste, Italy.
There, he translated the Arabian Nights and erotic works, such as
the Kama Sutra, which were hardly sitting-room fair in prim
Victorian England.
   Burton spoke at least 29 languages - often passing for a native
speaker when his life depended on it - mastered swordsmanship,
survived a spear through his jaw, wrote 43 books and over 100
articles and translated at least a dozen works from at least five
tongues.
   Stubbornly unwilling to bend to Victorian prohibitions or
political expediency, Burton detailed female circumcision and
homosexual brothels with the same zest as he did the ethnography of
Nile River peoples.
   A man of extremes, he gorged opium and other exotic drugs, and
spent much of a half-year trip to the United States drunk.
   And, writes Rice, Burton played a large, but much more secret,
role in the ``Great Game,'' the British machinations which led to
eventual conquests of much of the Middle East, India and Northern
Africa.
   Yet, dogged by sometimes jealous and vituperative political
enemies, Burton, dubbed ``The White Nigger,'' went largely
unrewarded and never surpassed the unremarkable rank of captain in
the British armed services. In his 40s, he was posted as consul to
backwater Sao Paolo, Brazil, and to Fernando Po, ``an isolated,
foresaken island in the Bight of Biafra on the African west
coast,'' writes Rices.
   Largely through the efforts of his devoted and well-connected
wife, Isabel, Burton finally escaped for a stint as consul of
beloved Damascus.
   But again unable to appease his powerful foes as skillfully as
he charmed his myriad friends, Burton was soon posted to the
near-exile of Trieste.
   A life as fascinating as Burton's, of course, has not escaped
previous notice. Those around him, including Isabel, wrote
sometimes emotionally charged articles and biographies after his
death at age 72, 100 years ago.
   But not until 1963 did Byron Farwell, in ``Burton, A Biography
of Sir Richard Francis Burton,'' take a comprehensive and more
objective look. (Farwell's work was reissued in 1988 and, for the
first time, published in the United States by Penguin.) At least
four other biographies followed before Rice's. Burton's character
also dominated the 1972 BBC miniseries ``The Search for the Nile.''
   Rudyard Kipling based at least two fictional characters on
Burton, says Rice. Philip Jose Farmer chose him as the hero of his
``Riverworld'' science fiction series, in which everyone who has
died past the age of five comes back to life. Burton, as if not
intriguing enough in fact, was fictionalized in William Harrison's
``Burton and Speke,'' the basis for this year's film, ``Mountains
of the Moon,'' which portrays Burton's endeavors and tragic
confrontrations with rival explorer John Hanning Speke.
   That Hollywood movie is one reason Rice's was the first Burton
book to reach best-seller lists.
   ``Clearly, publicity and promotion can turn the tide for a book,
and a movie tie-in always helps,'' says Gayle Feldman, an editor at
Publishers Weekly.
   Publisher Charles Scribner's Sons pushed the book, sending Rice
on book tours and national TV shows, and the biography got good
reviews throughout the media.
   Rice's book is, perhaps, the most comprehensive of the Burton
biographies. It quotes liberally from Burton's writings and puts a
lot of the explorer's life in the context of the times, drawing
upon Rice's considerable knowledge of Eastern religions and
cultures.
   Throughout, Rice's admiration of Burton is clear, and he makes
some controversial assertions. That Burton was a spy has not been
proven, though Rice ties scant evidence into a somewhat convincing
whole.
   Rice, who has written a dozen other books, also seems convinced
that Burton had a mysterious Persian lover whom he wooed, lost and
pined for the rest of his life.
   In perhaps his most contentious argument, Rice says Burton was a
devoted Moslem, maybe even a Sufi mystic. Scholars today heatedly
debate Burton's religious leanings, as did those who lived with and
near him.
   After Burton's death, his wife, a devout Catholic, burned the
personal diaries which may have solved the arguments.
