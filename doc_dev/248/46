<LEADPARA>  WITH its battling samurai, epic grandeur and twists of betrayal and rebellion,
"Heaven &amp; Earth" has the makings of a great Akira Kurosawa film.;   
Unfortunately it was directed by Haruki Kadokawa.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That's unsurprising, perhaps. Kurosawa is a prophet without honor in his
own country, a man who has to beg abroad for money. Kadokawa is the head of
his own publishing company, the founder of his own studio and an investor in
such expensive Broadway flops as "Shogun: The Musical." Kurosawa wouldn't get
the backing for a $42 million epic. Kadokawa could.;    He just can't direct.;
   "Heaven &amp; Earth" is set in 16th-century feudal Japan, an age of rebellious
samurai and civil war. Brother kills brother. Nobles seize chunks of territory
like hungry wolves. And the rifle -- a pitiless weapon that kills an enemy
whose face you've never seen -- seems to hint that the age of chivalry is
over.;    Brutal battling;  It's a brutal time that produces two great
warriors, the mystic Kagetora and the pragmatic Takeda. But like Shakespeare's
great flawed kings, Kagetora at first seems unfit for victory. His compassion
hobbles him, and only by becoming more brutal than his enemy can he hope to
defeat him. To win his war, he has to lose himself.;    There's great drama
here, and Kadokawa misses it. Brief, truncated scenes are bridged by long,
Japanese-tourist-board vistas of cherry blossoms and snowy peaks. (Which is
ironic, because most of the exteriors were filmed in Alberta, Canada.) What
should be wrenching moments of death and treachery often occur offscreen,
while hack-of-all-trades Stuart Whitman provides the helpful narration that
"Time passed.";    This isn't completely Kadokawa's fault; over an hour was
cut from the movie for its American release. But what remains isn't very
impressive. He seems incapable of handling his actors, who lapse into stylized
Kabuki mannerisms. Takaaki Enoki, who plays Kagetora, is supposed to be a
thoughtful, spiritual man. We know this because he stares into space a lot and
seems unable to answer questions. Masahiko Tsugawa's Takeda is an old villain
set in his ways. We know this because he scowls all the time. These are
cutouts, not characters.;    It leaves "Heaven &amp; Earth" little to fall back
on, except its battle scenes, and even these disappoint. Kadokawa pulls his
camera back into flat, impersonal medium shots, and the warfare becomes mere
intersecting lines, pretty forces in red and black riding at each other in
full gallop. Twenty-five years ago, with perhaps a hundredth of the budget,
Orson Welles turned the battles of "Chimes at Midnight" into bloody images of
futile violence. Kadokawa turns his civil war into plane geometry.;    Flat
and passionless;  There are a few nice images -- a thicket of lances, soldiers
emerging suddenly from a great concealing fog -- but the spectacle remains as
passionless as the final battle in a James Bond film. A bad, Roger Moore James
Bond film.;    Kadokawa isn't shy. He's said that he identifies with his
mystic hero. His studio biography even cheerfully sets forward his
accomplishments. Shinto priest. Writer of haiku. "Noted adventurer." "Widely
celebrated leader of his generation." Next year, going Columbus one better, he
plans to captain a copy of the Santa Maria from Spain to Japan. He's not shy.
He'd even make a great subject for a movie.;    He just can't seem to make a
great movie.;     Heaven &amp; Earth; (star)(star); Rated: PG-13 (for violence);
