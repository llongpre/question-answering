Disney's beloved 1964 live-action/animation fantasy Mary Poppins returns on 
KNBC on Sunday at 7 p.m. Julie Andrews, of course, has the title role as the 
"practically perfect" nanny hired by the Banks family of Edwardian London.

<P>
The Living Daylights (KABC, Sunday at 8:30 p.m.) introduced in 1987 a new James 
Bond, Timothy Dalton, who is splendid-provided you can put Sean Connery out of 
your mind-but after a quarter of a century of 007, it's pretty much the same as 
before, except for less casual sex in this AIDS era. 
</P>
<P>
Top Secret! (KCOP, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) tries to send up-and update-the World 
War II spy adventure, a rather antiquated target. There's a nonstop barrage of 
gags, many inspired and hilarious in themselves but scattershot in effect. 
Dynamic Val Kilmer stars as an American rock 'n' roller who's a last-minute 
substitute for Leonard Bernstein at an East German cultural festival-and who 
winds up trying to help an imprisoned scientist escape to the West, along with 
his pretty daughter.

Tarzan, the Ape Man (KTLA, Thursday at 8 p.m.), the delirious 1981 Bo and John 
Derek version,should've been called "Me, Jane." Silly, tedious and soft-pornish 
-- but surely tamed for TV -- Bo's virginal Jane invades West Africa alone in 
search of her great white hunter father (Richard Harris) and winds up saved 
from a lion by an equally virginal Ape Man (Miles O'Keeffe). 
</P>

In Endangered Species (KTLA, Friday at 8 p.m.), Alan Rudolph's taut 1982 
political thriller, the cattle near a small Colorado town begin to be 
decimated, their carcasses peculiarly mutilated while their internal organs 
seem to have evaporated. The plot proves to be timely and chilling, but its 
unraveling is less than inspired. 
</P>

Two vintage adventures also air Friday: Robert Aldrich's 1954 Western Vera Cruz 
(KTTV, Friday at 8 p.m.), with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster, and Michael 
Curtiz's classic 1938 The Adventures of Robin Hood (KCOP, Friday at 8 p.m.), 
with Errol Flynn.

With the 1982 I Ought to Be in Pictures (KTLA, Saturday at 6 p.m.), Neil Simon 
wrote two of his most believable characters-a burnt-out screenwriter and his 
girlfriend, a studio hairdresser-and under Herbert Ross' direction, Walter 
Matthau and Ann-Margret are wonderful. Unfortunately, Matthau's obnoxious 
teen-age daughter (Dinah Manoff) turns up to become the film's center of 
attention.

Ian McShane stars in the 1989 Dick Francis mystery, In the Frame (KCOP, 
Saturday at 8 p.m.).

Photo, The late John Cassavetes' 1980 comedy "Gloria" (KCOP, at 8 p.m.) was his 
most accessible, likeable movie, in which the radiant Gena Rowlands plays a 
retired gun moll on the run with both a priceless underworld ledger -- and an 
unwanted but beguiling 6-year-old (John Adames.).
