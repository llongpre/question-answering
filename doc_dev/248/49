   Longtime James Bond actor Roger Moore says he's
giving up the lead role in a new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical because
he can't sing well enough.
   ``I now do not think that the musical stage is for me,'' Moore
said Monday.
   The actor who played secret agent 007 in six Bond films had been
rehearsing for six weeks. The musical, ``Aspects of Love,'' is
scheduled to open in a month and is already sold out until Christmas.
   Moore said he quit after ``much soul-searching,'' and left enough
time for a ``more musically suitable replacement to be found.''
   ``I think perhaps I underestimated the vocal demands of the role
because I so much wanted Roger to play it,'' said Lloyd Webber, the
composer of ``Cats'' and ``Phantom of the Opera.''
   Moore, 61, was to have headed a 20-member cast as George
Dillingham, a romantic aristocrat, in the love story about an
English boy and a penniless French actress. Lloyd Webber had invited
Moore to take the role after hearing him sing at a private party.

   Actress Candice Bergen says that before her
daughter's birth, she thought she would have a baby only if it
``were more like a chimpanzee.''
   ``But then suddenly Chloe was born. ... I was so overwhelmed and
ecstatic to have this baby,'' the 41-year-old actress said in an
interview in April's Redbook.
   ``I never used to like babies. I had absolutely no confidence
that I had any maternal instincts whatsoever. I'd always think,
`Well, if a baby were more like a chimpanzee, I'd have one,''' said
Bergen, who is married to French filmmaker Louis Malle.
   Bergen, who lived in Los Angeles last fall while playing a TV
newswoman in the CBS series ``Murphy Brown,'' said she will try to
distance her 3-year-old daughter from the Beverly Hills lifestyle.
   ``I find the narcissism and self-involvement ... really
appalling. People's preoccupation with their looks and their clothes
at a time when there's so much suffering in the country _ I just
find it grotesque,'' she said.

   Producers of NBC-TV's ``In the Heat of the Night''
said Joe Don Baker will be an interim guest star on the series while
Carroll O'Connor recovers from cardiac bypass surgery.
   O'Connor was moved out of intensive care at Emory University
Hospital on Monday, two days after his surgery, and is expected to
remain hospitalized another week or so, hospital spokeswoman Eve
Patterson said.
   ``He's making excellent progress,'' Patterson said.
   O'Connor, perhaps best known as the blue-collar bigot Archie
Bunker in the situation comedy ``All in the Family,'' will miss this
season's four remaining episodes of ``In the Heat of the Night.''
   The show's producers, MGM@UA Television, announced that Baker
will portray a neighboring sheriff who fills in while Police Chief
Bill Gillespie _ O'Connor's character _ represents his state at a
seminar on terrorism.

   Former White House press secretary James S.
Brady says he's ready to become an advocate for the disabled now
that he's overcome a head wound suffered in the 1981 assassination
attempt on then-President Reagan.
   Brady, 48, who retired from the White House recently, said Monday
he accepted an unpaid position as vice chairman of the National
Organization on Disability, a private, non-profit group.
   ``Now that I'm one of the 37 million people with disabilities, I
know what it's like: the daily frustration and problems,'' he said
at a news conference.
   ``My family and I have been fortunate over the past eight years
to have the support of friends, family and people from all across
the country. That support system has been invaluable to me in my
recovery.
   ``Now, I want to help provide a support system for others.''
   President Bush and Reagan sent congratulatory messages to Brady.
   ``Your comeback has made us all proud,'' Bush wrote in a letter.

   Actress Shirley Maclaine says she's content to
play plump, ill-tempered characters, but she hasn't given up on
glamour entirely.
   Maclaine, 55, said she had a good time gaining 25 pounds to play
a tyrannical piano teacher in last year's critically acclaimed
``Madame Sousatzka.''
   ``I needed to feel my thighs clang together. I had to get Shirley
out of the way and let this character play herself,'' she said in
April's Ladies' Home Journal.
   Her newest role, in the soon-to-be-released film version of the
play ``Steel Magnolias,'' is Ouiser Boudreaux: ``an old, ugly,
sarcastic witch who's been in a bad mood for 40 years.''
   ``I'm going to play characters who are misfits or mildly
eccentric, with very sweeping personalities, maybe 60 or 65 years
old, who may or may not have any sexual relationships, who are
confronting something important about themselves.''
   But one day, the Oscar-winning actress said, ``I may also decide
I want to be glamorous again.''

   Actress Esther Williams says she's limiting her
comeback hopes to swimsuit designing and hasn't acted in decades
because she didn't want to ``lower my standards.''
   Miss Williams wowed moviegoers in the 1940s and 1950s with lavish
swimming and underwater ballet sequences in 26 MGM movies including
the ``Million Dollar Mermaid,'' ``Dangerous When Wet'' and ``Bathing
Beauty.''
   ``Everything changed,'' she said in a telephone interview from
her Beverly Hills, Calif., home. ``I was in that moment of
transition between when the big studios lost all the theaters and TV
was getting prominent and important.''
   Recently, she considered a role in a two-hour television movie,
but turned down the four day, $25,000-a-day job after reading the
``exploitive'' script.
   ``Boy was I glad when I saw it,'' she said. ``I don't want to
lower my standards. I would have hated that hundred thousand
dollars.''
   On Monday, Miss Williams, 65, showed off her first line of
swimsuits, a collection of 124 designs ranging from $30 to $60.
