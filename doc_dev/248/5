   Timothy Dalton was faced with two of the
toughest acts to follow, but he has managed by talent and sheer
perseverance to bring James Bond to life in a new, modernized style
that could carry 007 into the 21st century.
   The 44-year-old Briton was here for the opening of ``Licence to
Kill,'' 16th of the adventures (not counting two unofficial films)
that have generated more dollars than any film series in movie
history.
   Most critics have found Dalton at ease in his second go-round as
Bond; his first, ``The Living Daylights,'' was not written for him.
He also seemed relaxed in an interview, as if he had come to grips
with a classic role that might have overwhelmed him. He admitted
having ``enormous pause'' when he first considered it.
   ``My concern was not about creating the character, which after
all is my job,'' said Dalton. ``If I do it well, then that's
terrific. If I fail, then that's also part of being an actor.
   ``The pause was over how to deal with it, how to bring an
audience with you, away from its history and into its new present.
Very clearly, before I took it on, I knew that everyone has an
opinion about Bond; it's part of the cinema-going consciousness.
   ``Everyone has an opinion about the actors who have played Bond
before. Half the world loved Sean Connery; half the world loved
Roger Moore. Their films existed in two very different styles. You
know when you take it on you run the risk of having the whole world
hate what you do. If that had happened, it would have been a major
catastrophe. Fortunately it didn't,'' he said.
   ``What one must face today is that we've got something new,
something different. ... This is a new style of Bond. It isn't a
light-hearted, comedic, spoofing Bond. It's not a technological
extravaganza. I think it's back down to its origins, its basics,
trying to capture the spirit of Ian Fleming, and of the early movies.
   ``I loved `Dr. No' and `From Russia With Love'; they were very
exciting adventure-thrillers. I watched the train sequence of Sean
Connery and Robert Shaw the other day. It's still tremendously
exciting.''
   Previewers noted that Dalton seemed to be performing much of his
own action, but he discounted any threat to his safety.
   ``I think the strenuous side of a Bond movie is the sheer amount
of time to make one _ six months, which is a very, very long
schedule,'' he said. ``You're on location so you work long hours.
The crew works 15 hours a day; we go back, watch rushes, talk about
tomorrow's work, so it's 18 hours a day.''
   Dalton had a thriving career before producer Cubby Broccoli chose
him as the fourth James Bond (George Lazenby had a single shot in
``On Her Majesty's Secret Service,'' 1969).
   He grew up in Manchester with non-professional parents.
   ``My grandfather and grandmother were in vaudeville-music
halls,'' Dalton said, ``but my parents were not involved in the
theater. It skipped a generation.
   ``I suppose I first became interested, just like most kids of my
generation, by going to the Saturday morning pictures. You find
yourself in a very exciting, rare, different world. An extraordinary
coincidence: The first full-length feature film I saw was `The Red
Beret,' starring Alan Ladd. I discovered recently that it was
produced by Cubby Broccoli. The very first picture that I saw at
five or six years old was produced by the man I'm now working for.''
   Dalton studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and appeared
in classics from repertory to the West End. His film debut was
auspicious: as the young king of France in ``The Lion in Winter''
with Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole. Other films have included
``Cromwell,'' ``Wuthering Heights'' (as Heathcliff), ``Agatha'' and
a curiosity, ``Sextette'' with Mae West.
   Although ``Sextette'' was seen by few, Dalton found working with
the film legend a rare experience.
   ``She claimed to be 84 but some oldtimers said she was 90,'' he
recalled. ``It was amazing to be working at her old studio,
Paramount, and see her come to life every day as she did the thing
she loved.''
   How long will Dalton remain with Bond?
   He laughed heartily before replying: ```Licence to Kill' started
to do extremely well in Europe. If it does well here, I'm sure there
will be another one. ... But for how long I'll continue, I don't
know.''
