<LEADPARA>  IN HOLLYWOOD movies, the beautiful blond in the detective's office is
generally not the detective. More likely, she's there to beg him to take that
case that just doesn't smell right. Kathleen Turner intends to change all
that.;    Wrapped in a thin housecoat against a bitterly cold night -- for
Southern California, anyway -- she's awaiting her next scene as the star of
"Fully Loaded," based on the novels of the Chicago-based writer Sara Paretsky
about a female detective named V.I. Warshawski (her friends call her Vic).  </LEADPARA>

TURNER TWISTS THE DETECTIVE ROLE  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Turner has reasons for wanting the name Warshawski to become as well known
to moviegoers as that of James Bond, even if it doesn't roll as trippingly off
the tongue.;    After a week of location shooting in Chicago, the production
has relocated to Los Angeles' port of San Pedro; and as chilly winds whip
across the abandoned dock, the crew members have to keep reminding themselves
how cold it was in Chicago.;    Not only is Turner skimpily dressed as she
awaits her next scene, her hair is dripping wet. She's supposed to have fallen
off the dock, only to find upon making her way back to dry land that her
boyfriend, Murray (Jay O. Sanders), has been injured in an explosion.;   
Turner says she's been reading female detective fiction for a long time,
looking for just this kind of role. Of all the female detectives, Turner says,
Warshawski "is the most interesting, the one with the best moral values. She's
asked, 'What does it cost to hire you?' and she says, 'A just cause.' ";   
That V.I. Warshawski is an admirable, independent, smart, hip, morally
upright, strong yet vulnerable character is rewarding enough; it's also the
lead role in a movie that, if successful, will almost certainly generate
sequels.;    Trying to hew to the spirit of Warshawski, Turner has laid down
some ground rules for the picture, in which the detective teams up with a
plucky 13-year-old girl in an effort to find out who killed the child's
hockey-player father.;    "We have a little slogan in this film -- 'no
bimbos.' I mean, even in the scene where we had to put a girl in bed with
Murray, she was wearing glasses and reading Psychology Today. She was not
reading People.";    Enforcing this rule required a good deal of vigilance,
according to Turner.;    "The opening scene in the movie is with this real
twit, who wants to hire V.I. to investigate his rival, and he says, very
suggestively, 'Why don't you give me a taste of what you do?' and they had
written in some stuff where I kind of go along with this at first. And I said,
no, no, no, no. I will not say anything that will contribute to this jerk's
illusions. I mean, she turns around and puts him in his place in the end, but
as far as I'm concerned, even to go along with it for a little while is
unacceptable.;    "We get in some good male bashes in this film," Turner says
gleefully. "There's one scene where I get this guy to give me information he
really should not be giving. And Angela Goethals, who plays a little girl I
become friends with, says, 'Wow, are men so easy?' And I say, 'Never
underestimate a man's ability to underestimate a woman's.' Which I think
should be our slogan for life."  </TEXT>
