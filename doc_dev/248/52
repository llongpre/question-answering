<LEADPARA>  WHEN it comes to TV spy dramas, here's the conventional wisdom: Only the
British know how to do them right. And ABC's new attempt, "Under Cover," will
pose no challenge to the conventional wisdom.;    The show premieres tonight
(9 p.m., Chs. 7, 11, 13) as a two-hour movie special before moving to its
regular Saturday 9-10 p.m. time slot. It replaces "China Beach," which won't
seem a fair trade to many, even though it's made by John Sacret Young and
William Broyles Jr., the same people who made "China Beach." "Under Cover"
isn't a bad spy show; it's just an American spy show. That means it isn't
cynical enough to seem real and can't stand still long enough for the
characters to get interesting.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Consider the British classics of the genre: "Danger Man," "Secret Agent"
and "The Prisoner," in which Patrick McGoohan played the same dour spy, John
Drake. (The anonymous agent in "The Prisoner" was called "Drake" only once,
but we all knew who he was.);    Can you imagine us Yanks making those shows?
If we had, we'd have cast Robert Wagner as Drake and found ways to work car
chases into "The Prisoner." American TV networks can't abide thought in a spy
show. Thought and boring are synonyms in American TV. Action rules. That's why
our version of "The Sandbaggers" would turn dry Neil Burnside into a reckless,
two-fisted womanizer. We wouldn't have let Alec Guinness get anywhere near the
role of George Smiley in "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" if William Conrad was
available.;    Think I'm kidding? Believe it or not, American television got
the first crack at the most famous British spy character of modern times --
Ian Fleming's James Bond -- when "Casino Royale" was performed live on CBS's
"Climax" series on Oct. 21, 1954, eight years before Sean Connery played Bond
for the first time in the British-made "Dr. No." So what did the Yanks do to
Agent 007? They made him American-born and cast crew-cut Barry Nelson in the
part! If a nation could feel shame, that was America's turn.;    Even when the
British make fun of their spies, they do it better. They gave us a delicious
spoof called "The Avengers" that still inspires reverence among its fans. We
tried it and came up with "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." Need I say more?;   
Anyway, our record in the TV spy drama genre certainly isn't enviable compared
to the Brits, who instinctively realize spying is a cold, neurotic and
dehumanizing kind of work. We still think of it as derring-do.;    That's the
main problem with "Under Cover," which follows the adventures of "NIA" man --
that's right, they don't even dare call it the CIA -- Dylan Del'Amico (Anthony
John Denison), his wife and fellow agent Kate (Linda Purl) and their colleague
Flynn (John Rhys-Davies).;    In tonight's show, we first meet the three
agents as they're running from a mob of angry Iranians during the 1980 Islamic
uprisings. Kate and Flynn elude the mob, but Dylan is cornered and has to
climb over a high stone wall to escape.;    Wouldn't you know the Soviet
embassy turns out to be on the other side of that wall? Once a prisoner of the
KGB, Dylan is made an offer he hardly can refuse: They'll get him and his pals
out of Iran if he'll become a Soviet mole.;    So we rejoin the happy trio 10
years later, safely back in Washington, D.C. Kate is now retired and a mom.
Dylan and Flynn are still in the NIA (could it mean "Non-Intelligence
Agency"?), but are considered relics by the computer nerds who now staff the
service.;    Nobody knows Dylan is a Soviet mole except the KGB and his NIA
boss, Stewart Merriman (Josef Sommer), who's been gleefully feeding the
Soviets misinformation through Dylan for the past 10 years.;    But nothing so
serene can last forever, so it should be no surprise that right-wing Soviets
anxious to topple Gorbachev get their hooks into Dylan and involve him in an
assassination plot in a turbulent Soviet republic, so they can blame it on the
United States and start the Cold War all over again.;    Naturally, this means
Kate must come out of retirement, find a baby sitter and head for the Soviet
Union to link up with Flynn to save her husband's life. After all, they didn't
stand around singing "Stand By Me" at their last reunion for nothing.;    As
dumb as it sounds, "Under Cover" seems to be groping for the right cynical
attitude. Casting the laconic Denison, best known as greasy gangster Ray Luca
of "Crime Story," as the hero is a good start. But does he really need a
devoted wife and Friar Tuck for a sidekick?;    It would be nice to think
Young and Broyles might work "Under Cover" into the sort of thoughtful drama
their "China Beach" was. But maybe they know those are the kinds of shows that
don't live long in American television.;    'A Taste of Freedom';  Tonight at
5, TNT cable network presents a most unusual program, "A Taste of Freedom,"
which is the result of a glasnost-era partnership between Soviet filmmaker
Marina Goldovskaya and British director Roland Joffe ("The Killing Fields"),
who served as executive producer.;    The film is a close-up look at the
family of Soviet TV journalist Sasha Politkovsky during a high-pressure
six-week period in 1990. His pungent observations about post-disaster
contamination at Chernobyl and ethnic violence in the republic of Azerbaijan
place his family in jeopardy despite the relaxed restrictions of the Gorbachev
era.;    Goldovskaya's intrusive camera shows us how pessimistic some Soviets
are about the future of perestroika and how wary they are of the return of
repression. Yet it also leaves the distinct feeling they'll fight going back
to the old ways after their taste of freedom.  </TEXT>
