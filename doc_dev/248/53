Time magazine's recent cover story is devoted to the way 464 Americans were 
killed by guns in a single week, and some of the biggest box-office movies of 
the summer are bloodier than ever. The topics don't seem unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
Films, still the most potent message-carriers around, seem to be fostering a 
greenhouse effect of violence. They're murderous, they present new, bigger, 
more insidious methods of killing people, they do well at the box office and 
they come back having to top themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the summer sequels -- "Licence to Kill," a "new" James Bond (the first 
not to have come from one of the books and the furthest in spirit from them), 
and "Lethal Weapon 2" -- appear hellbent on setting some new high-water mark in 
violent death and noisy destruction. "Batman," which gets to create its own 
precedents, adds a nasty twist to its brutality. And so the ante is upped 
everywhere along the line. 
</P>
<P>
The point about "Batman's" Joker is destruction and mutilation for the sheer 
joy of it. He lets the floodgates loose on savagery, Jack Nicholson's spurting 
energy pushing the amps higher and higher. The murderees are legion -- 
co-horts, girl friends, Gotham Cityites at random. When he goes on that 
slashing, paint-slashing rampage in a pretentiously named art museum, we're 
supposed to get the joke; smile indulgently because these are such frankly 
bogus copies of Old Masters, their very fakeness picked up by the museum's 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
But there are audiences who won't get the gag; all they'll pick up on is the 
glee with which Nicholson and his henchmen prance through that high-toned 
place, turning it into a heap of torn canvas and spray-painted walls. Why 
aren't the people who have been wringing their hands and worrying about the 
potential effects of "Do the Right Thing" concerned about a scene as 
seductively conducive to imitation as this one? 
</P>
<P>
The Bond film, which this time is a revenge vendetta on Bond's part for the 
mutilation (there's that subject again) of his close friend, dangles men over 
shark pits, indeed has them half-eaten and survive, and blows up others in 
decompression tanks, spattering the porthole windows with their blood. I 
suppose it's the usual crunch and desperation of every Bond film, but the tone 
is more extreme, more sadistic, the blood-letting more torrential. 
</P>
<P>
If these films weren't speaking to their audiences as viscerally as they are, 
they'd be laughable. "Lethal Weapon 2" is a joke of a story, a charade on the 
subject of apartheid held together by the enormous warmth and likability of Mel 
Gibson and Danny Glover, separately and especially together. But when the 
excesses of the action make audiences cheer instead of hoot, it's a thermometer 
reading, and that thermometer is going up as we sit here. 
</P>
<P>
Were the Lethal Weaponeers dealing in crimes that involved millions of dollars 
in the first film? You can feel film-making minds whirring frantically: OK, OK, 
this time we'll make it billions. Did people drop from buildings in the 
original? So this time, we'll drop whole buildings on them. Or entire cargo 
containers. 
</P>
<P>
If one of our heroes was strafed by machine-gun fire and left for dead before, 
now the villains blow up very nearly the entire Los Angeles police force's 
detective squad, at their homes, at their poker games, whoosh! 
</P>
<P>
Most disturbing of all is "Lethal Weapon 2's" simplistic lesson in political 
science: White South Africans are the new Nazis. All of them. Yes, we are told 
that the eminently hissible Joss Ackland is not the South African ambassador 
but their "Minister of Diplomatic Affairs." But to unsophisticated audiences, 
you can bet that he and his staff of blond, snarling henchmen personify white 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
And they are all sadists, with thick Boer accents, who sneer at "Kaffir-lovers" 
the way Helmut Dantine or Kurt Kruger used to sneer when Hollywood had real 
Nazis to characterize. To be sure, we have one "good" South African, 
</P>
<P>
a very sweet, white-blond, completely dim young woman who works at this 
non-embassy but doesn't exactly agree with her country's policies. Useless to 
ask why she then works for them. Agreed that it's getting harder and harder to 
find an all-purpose villain for movies these days, one whose constituencies 
won't be marching outside your theaters come opening day. It would seem that 
the atrocious and heart-rending practices of apartheid would make that 
government fair game. Unfortunately, life is not quite that simple. The people 
who have been ignored in "Lethal Weapon 2's" rush to fill us in politically are 
that core of white South Africans who have doggedly and at no slight personal 
risk been working for the rights of South Africans of color for years. (Books 
and newspapers aside, did no one see "A World Apart?") To ignore their very 
existence is insulting, at the least. 
</P>
<P>
In order to solidify our loathing of these bloody Boers, to make it personal as 
well as political, the film makers have gone back to the first movie and 
explained that the death of Mel Gibson's beloved but fortunately unseen wife 
was also a deliberate act by these very same mega-villains, drug traffickers as 
well as sadists. 
</P>
<P>
All this is to pave the way for the movie's unceasing vigilantism, to give 
Gibson free rein to invade the South Africans' official offices, rough up their 
goons, even shatter their tropical fish tank with rifle fire. (Fish have 
politics too?) And finally, to shoot their "Minister of Diplomatic Affairs" 
even as he holds up his card of diplomatic immunity. Why is that different from 
an American Embassy member showing his papers of immunity in, say, Tehran, and 
expecting the protection they provide? 
</P>
<P>
The point is that, trivial as it may seem to complain about a film like "Lethal 
Weapon 2," what is at issue are the principles of civilized behavior. By 
violating them -- no matter the provocation -- you weaken what separates us 
from governments we rightly deplore. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, in addition to frightening youngsters dramatically, a film like 
"Batman" teaches them that there is a kick that goes with destruction not 
unlike the rush of sniffing glue or a first hit of crack. 
</P>
<P>
What's most offensive about these formidably effective movies, however, is the 
way they trivialize life itself. If in a decade or so, we find ourselves in a 
society so de-based it is intolerable, we might look back to this summer as one 
of the signposts along the way.
