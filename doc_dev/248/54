   As glasnost and perestroika unfold in Mikhail
Gorbachev's Soviet Union, British spy novelists are looking beyond
the Evil Empire rhetoric to a more complicated approach that blurs
enemy lines.
   ``What we've lost is the natural assumption that if you say
Russians, you're talking about a certain character,'' says Gavin
Lyall, creator of the popular cloak-and-dagger character Harry Maxim.
   ``You can't be as simplistic anymore; you move in a direction of
possibly more subtlety,'' said Lyall, 57.
   Anthony Sampson remarked in The Independent newspaper recently
that ``those beloved villains (the Soviets) are losing their
villainy.''
   ``They've all been undermined by that exasperatingly soft-spoken
Gorbachev, as he insists on retreating from every filmic
battleground from Afghanistan to Angola.''
   Comments Sunday Times TV critic Patrick Stoddart: ``If we are no
longer to be scared of Reds under the bed, what on earth are we
going to read before we turn out the light?''
   The drawing power of Cold War drama remains strong, however, as
shown by ``Game, Set and Match,'' a 13-part television adaptation of
spy novelist Len Deighton's trilogy. Aired in Britain last fall, it
won critical acclaim and high ratings.
   The Deighton trilogy, about a British intelligence agent whose
wife turns out to be a Soviet plant, was written before glasnost
became a household word. But in interviews on the TV set,
co-director Patrick Lau insisted the work was glasnost-inspired in
that ``the enemy is no longer drawn in broadstroke cartoon
characters.''
   Richard Cohen, publishing director of Century-Hutchinson books
and former editor of famed spy novelist John Le Carre, said:
``Writers are having to be a bit more sophisticated. Certain
simplistic political maneuverings as the background to thrillers
can't be used now.''
   He said glasnost is ``wiping the slate clean,'' leaving open the
question of ``where to locate the enemy.''
   Rupert Allason, a Conservative Party lawmaker and espionage
historian, suggests the Middle East, whose secret services ``have a
deep grounding and are every bit as challenging as the KGB was 10 to
20 years ago.''
   Lyall's recently published ``Uncle Target'' is set largely in
Jordan, while his next book will take readers to Morocco and Bermuda.
   Ted Allbeury, 70, a British former intelligence officer who now
writes high-quality spy novels, said the thaw accompanying Moscow's
``openness'' offered richer fodder.
   ``It opens one more door,'' he said in an interview, ``if you can
imagine the war that must be going on ... between the old KGB
operators and the brighter people they're using more.''
   Allason, who writes under the pseudonym Nigel West, told BBC
radio last month: ``It's very difficult in this period to try and go
back to the sinister figure of running spies all around the world.''
   ``The fact is, the newspapers show us every day that they have
failed, and the KGB defections have in effect put Karla (le Carre's
fictional Soviet spymaster) out of business.''
   Not that the Soviet Union as a topic of interest is likely to go
away. ``The basic structure is as old as story-telling,'' said
Richard Cohen. ``It does have a certain form to it.''
   John Gardner, who writes James Bond novels by arrangement with
the estate of Bond creator Ian Fleming, doesn't see glasnost and
perestroika putting Western intelligence out of business.
   ``People say we must find a new evil, and my response to that is
the old one ain't gone away; it's very much still there,'' he said
in an interview.
   ``Just because we have Gorbachev saying wonderful things doesn't
mean we relax any vigilance,'' Gardner said in an interview.
   Former British spy Anthony Cavendish worries that new British
official secrets legislation, which imposes a lifetime ban on secret
agents describing their work, will dry up the source material that
helps spy novelists give their work authenticity. Cavendish's
memoir, ``Inside Intelligence,'' is already banned in Britain.
   But he sees glasnost opening new territory for the spy novel _
``the view from the other side.''
   ``With glasnost in full flood in the Soviet Union,'' he wrote,
``it may not be long before the trickle of spy books appearing there
turns into a flood.''
