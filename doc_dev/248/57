<HEAD>TBS Buys Rights To Televise 1,000 MGM-UA Films</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. has agreed to buy
the rights to nearly 1,000 MGM-UA movies from Pathe Communications
Inc. if Pathe can complete its attempt to buy the MGM-UA
Communications Co.
   The l0-year license agreements cover classic films in the United
Artists library as well as MGM films produced in 1985-1988 and some
in 1989. In 1986, TBS paid $1.5 billion to buy the MGM library of
films prior to May 1985.
   The package includes the first 16 James Bond movies and the
``Rocky'' through ``Rocky IV'' series.
   TBS and Pathe did not release the value of the agreements
announced Sunday. TBS spokeswoman Kitsie Riggall said the value of
the package was greater than a similar deal TBS made with Columbia
Pictures last year for $22 million, but not nearly as expensive as
the 1986 purchase of the MGM catalogue.
   The deal hinges on Pathe completing its purchase of MGM-UA.
   So far, Pathe has paid $353 million toward the purchase price of
about 1.3 billion. Questions still surround how Pathe's principal,
Giancarlo Parretti, will finance the remaining $900 million.
   The license agreements will allow TBS to show the films
exclusively for 10 years on its cable television channels, WTBS
Superstation and Turner Network Television.
   In addition to the James Bond and Rocky movies, the agreements
cover movies such as ``Rainman,'' ``A Fish Called Wanda,''
``Wargames'' and ``Yentl,'' as well as classics like ``West Side
Story,'' ``The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,'' ``Annie Hall,''
``Fiddler on the Roof,'' and ``Some Like It Hot.''
   The agreements do not include any future MGM-UA productions.
