   A notebook in which William Butler Yeats wrote
much of his poetry and prose over three years sold at Sotheby's for
$360,000, the auctioneers said.
   The notebook was part of a sale Thursday of English literary and
historical manuscripts and books that totaled $2.13 million,
Sotheby's said.
   Other items included letters written by Indian independence
leader Mohandas K. Gandhi and a script for a James Bond movie.
   H.D. Lyon, a London dealer, bought the Yeats notebook. The
seller was not identified but was believed to be a collector.
   In 1923, Yeats became the first Irishman to win the Nobel Prize
for literature.
   The Great Vellum Notebook, as the manuscript is known, contains
380 pages and was used by Yeats from November 1930 to the summer of
1933, six years before his death.
   A collection of 76 unpublished autograph letters written by the
Indian independence leader, Mohandas K. Gandhi, to his eldest son,
Harilal, between 1900 and 1914 was bought anonymously for $50,000.
   In the letters, Gandhi offered advice on sex, counseling
celibacy, and on diet, praising onions and deploring chocolates.
   The working film scripts for the first James Bond film, ``Dr.
No,'' by British screenwriter Wolf Mankowitz, sold at three times
their estimate for $5,000. They were bought by Quaritch, a London
dealer known for rare books.
