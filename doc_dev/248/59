   ```Crocodile' Dundee II'' is that rare bird: a sequel that
excels the original. Mind you, the new film will not have the
impact of ```Crocodile' Dundee I,'' which introduced us to one of
the great character creations of film history.
   Paul Hogan's Mick Dundee was a masterpiece, more credible than
Indiana Jones, more charming than James Bond, funnier than Rambo.
   The second coming of Dundee finds him shacked up with Sue
Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) in a New York penthouse, enjoying his
leisure. Not for long. Before he is murdered in Colombia, Sue's
former husband (Dennis Boutsikaris) sends her photographs
incriminating a drug baron (Hechter Ubarry). The powerful dopester
and his vicious lieutenant (Juan Fernandez) kidnap Sue and attempt
to recover the photos.
   Dundee to the rescue, accompanied by various street types. The
siege of the Colombian's New York castle is Capra corn of the best
vintage.
   To escape their pursuers, Dundee and Sue flee to his homeland
enjoying a reunion with his pub pals. The hoods follow, of course,
kidnaping bumbling Walter Reilly (John Meillon) and gathering some
local toughs to track down Mick and Sue. But the villains are no
match for the wilderness-wise Dundee.
   Only in the latter stages does the filmmakers' imagination
falter. Our hero's devices seem a bit labored, especially in the
assault of the bats.
   Paul Hogan remains true to the ``Crocodile'' image, which is
expectable since he wrote the script with his son, Brett. Happily
they reversed the locales, and the New York portion comes first,
Australia last. In the first movie, the Australian sequences were
far more interesting than the familiar plot of a hick in the big
city.
   Hogan's longtime partner, John Cornell, directed ```Crocodile'
Dundee II'' and produced with Jane Scott. He draws good
performances from the cast, especially the heavies Ubarry and
Fernandez, who are delightfully evil, and Meillon, a kind of down
under Smiley Burnette.
   Kozlowski has little to do but be supportive and frightened, and
she does both with great skill.
   It is both sorrowful and heartening to learn that Hogan plans to
retire Dundee forever. He will be sorely missed. But do we really
need to see ```Crocodile' Dundee Goes to Las Vegas,'' etc.?
   The Paramount release is rated PG, with not much content that
would harm children. Running time: 111 minutes.
