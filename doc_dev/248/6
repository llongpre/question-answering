<P>
The owner of the exclusive rights to novelist Ian Fleming's James Bond 
character is putting the super-spy on the auction block after a long run of 
movie hits that has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Variety, the entertainment weekly, said the decision was made by veteran film 
producer Albert Broccoli because revenues from the "007" films have been 
slipping. 
</P>
<P>
The latest film, "License to Kill," released last year, cost $30 million to 
make and has grossed only $16 million in domestic theatrical rentals so far. 
</P>
<P>
Variety described the 81-year-old Broccoli's decision to "protect and 
modernize" his franchise on James Bond as a "bloodless coup" within the MGM/UA 
empire, which has made all but one of the 17 James Bond productions.
