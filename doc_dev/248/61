<P>
James Bond star Timothy Dalton and actress Vanessa Redgrave won undisclosed 
libel damages today for newspaper allegations that he was rude to his producer 
and that colleagues dreaded her arrival on a movie set. 
</P>
<P>
Their lawyer, Oscar Beuselinck, told High Court Judge Michael Davies the 
settlement had been reached with Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mirror alleged in October that Dalton was rude and behaved 
unprofessionally toward producer Cubby Broccoli during filming of "License to 
Kill." The newspaper also claimed that Redgrave "was in the habit of making 
life impossible whenever she appeared on a film set." The Sunday Mirror 
withdrew the allegations and apologized.
