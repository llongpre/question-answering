MGM/UA OFFERS MURDOCH WAY TO GET FILMS HE SORELY NEEDS

If movies are ammunition in the global media wars, Rupert Murdoch's decision to 
bid for MGM/UA Communications Co. could give him access to a badly needed arms 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch's News Corp. already owns 20th Century Fox, one of the seven major 
Hollywood film studios. But a single studio can't supply enough movies to 
support his far-flung distribution channels -- and buying from outside 
suppliers has proved difficult in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Most notably, the Australia-based media giant has been scratching for a steady 
supply of Hollywood films to fill his new Sky Television, a British satellite 
TV service that could become, along with his pan-European Sky Channel, a model 
for other Murdoch-owned satellite ventures around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Launched earlier this year, the four- channel British service -- which is 
broadcast by satellite to in-home receivers and to cable systems -- has 
consumed some $120 million of News Corp.'s cash in its first five months of 
operation. Yet it is expected to reach only about 1.15 million subscribers by 
year-end, far less than the 2.5 million originally projected by the company. 
</P>
<P>
To feed the service, which includes an all-movie channel similar to Time 
Warner's HBO, Murdoch can draw on Fox's 2,000-film library -- along with the 
roughly 30 movies that Fox plans to release each year under a stepped-up 
schedule that will soon double its former pace. (Walt Disney Co. recently 
announced a similar production step-up, even as smaller Hollywood companies 
have been struggling to hold their own against the rapidly expanding major 
studios.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deals for 2,000 Films 
</P>
<P>
But Murdoch has also been competing fiercely with British Satellite 
Broadcasting, another planned satellite service, for rights to prime films from 
other studios. Funded by a consortium of media companies, including Reed 
International and Granada Group, BSB expects to begin operating next spring -- 
which puts severe pressure on Murdoch to lock in subscribers as quickly as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
So far, BSB has tapped its $650-million programming budget to sign deals for 
some 2,000 movies, including packages of recent films from Columbia, Warner, 
Paramount, Orion and others, according to a spokesman for the service. 
</P>
<P>
In one of its key deals, BSB acquired an exclusive six-year license to 198 
recent MGM/UA films, including "Rain Man," "A Fish Called Wanda," "Moonstruck" 
and the two latest James Bond films, "Living Daylights" and "License to Kill." 
</P>
<P>
Sky Channel has signed deals for similar film packages with Warner (which 
licensed "Batman" to Murdoch), Disney, Orion and others. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Murdoch channel suffered a major setback earlier this year when Disney 
back-peddled on an agreement under which it would have co-owned Sky 
Television's movie channel while providing its Disney Channel to the service. 
</P>
<P>
When Disney pulled out, Murdoch sued for $1.5 billion. Under a settlement 
agreement, Disney sold its stake in the joint venture back to Murdoch but will 
license at least some of its films to Sky Television for five years. Yet Disney 
is free to deal with competitors as well, spokesmen for both Fox and Disney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
BSB has claimed it has an edge in the fight for movies because it was quicker 
than Murdoch's service to promise that it would scramble its signal to prevent 
non-paying viewers on the European Continent from stealing a look at the 
movies. According to BSB, Sky Television has now agreed to develop a scrambling 
system as well. A Fox spokesman said he wasn't certain about plans for 
scrambling or the precise number of films that Sky Television has licensed to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disappointing Performances 
</P>
<P>
If Murdoch's bid for MGM/UA succeeds, the 1,000-film United Artists library -- 
which includes the Rocky, Pink Panther and James Bond movies -- will clearly 
provide instant ammo for Sky Television. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Fox's purchase might provide new headaches for Murdoch managers, including 
Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller, who might be hard pressed to revive MGM/UA's 
sagging movie production operation at time when the 20th Century Fox unit is 
still struggling to get its own movie unit in order. 
</P>
<P>
Fox has been plagued by the disappointing performance of "The Abyss" and other 
films this year and by constant executive changes, including the recent 
resignation of Fox President Leonard Goldberg in favor of a new movie chief, 
longtime producer Joe Roth. 
</P>
<P>
According to Daily Variety's box office reports, Fox ranks last among the major 
studios, with 6.4% of U.S. ticket sales this year -- just behind MGM/UA's 8%.
