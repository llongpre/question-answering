THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Did they make you mad, son? Did they make you mean mad? Mean, mad, mean, 
mad-dog mean? 
</P>
<P>
Well, cheer up, pal, your kind of movie is being featured at the video store 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
After all that syrupy Christmas junk, it's action you want -- rough, tough, 
thrilling, no-weapons-barred action -- and CBS/Fox knows it. The company has 
just released the latest James Bond film on tape and is offering two of the 
most enjoyable secret-agent movies ever influenced by the Bond series, as well 
as a price reduction on one of the meanest, maddest tough-guy hits of last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In "Licence to Kill" ($89.98, PG-13), Bond (Timothy Dalton) sets out after the 
druglord who murdered his best friend. You'll be happy to know it's one of the 
meanest, toughest in the series. You also might enjoy the commercial that 
precedes the movie. No, really. It's another Schweppes ad featuring John 
Cleese. (The Monty Python comedian also did a funny one for the cassette 
version of his own film, "A Fish Called Wanda.") 
</P>
<P>
James Coburn was the man from Z.O.W.I.E. in a silly but largely enjoyable spoof 
of the Bond series, "Our Man Flint." The 1967 film was followed by a sequel, 
"In Like Flint," and each is now on video for $59.95. 
</P>
<P>
CBS/Fox has also repriced the tensely directed Bruce Willis hit "Die Hard" at 
$19.98, plus "Death Hunt," "Target," "Love and Bullets," "8 Million Ways to 
Die" as well as -- hey, how did these get in here? -- "The Towering Inferno" 
and "The Poseidon Adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Not enough violent action? Also new on tape is "Jakarta" (MCEG/Virgin, $79.95, 
R), a 1988 action-thriller about a CIA man who follows a mysterious woman to -- 
you guessed it -- Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's "A Chorus of Disapproval" (Southgate, $89.95, PG), a rock-'em, 
sock-'em-in-the-jaw entertainment about what happens when a bunch of street 
punks take some shots at the police glee club. OK, we lied -- it just didn't 
fit in. "Chorus" is actually a comedy about a recent widower who auditions for 
a local production of 'The Beggar's Opera' and -- yawn, 'scuse us -- gets 
involved in a real-estate scandal. See what we mean? Really, though, it's based 
on one of those great, funny, nasty Alan Ayckbourn plays. Unfortunately, it was 
directed by Michael Winner. 
</P>

OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
In "Jane Fonda's Light Aerobics and Stress Reduction Program" (Warner, $29.98), 
the Queen of Fitness leads us in 20 minutes of light aerobics, 20 minutes of 
full-body stretching and 15 minutes of stress reduction. TERRY ATKINSON
