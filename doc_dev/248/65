   Billy Dee Williams, known for his looks as well
as his acting abilities, was a fat child taunted by neighborhood
youths.
   ``A kid should grow up with some flaws, because it makes you work
a little harder,'' said Williams in the Sunday issue of Parade
magazine. ``You don't rely so much on your looks.''
   ``Sonny,'' as his family calls him, was ``a jolly little fat guy
who weighed 150 pounds by the time he was 10,'' his mother, Loretta
Williams, told the magazine.
   When other children chased him, ``he'd be running and crying, and
his pants would be splitting down the back,'' said Mrs. Williams.
   Williams, who began acting at age 7, noted that his role in the
1972 movie ``Lady Sings the Blues'' established him as ``this
romantic matinee idol,'' an image he kept up on the television show
``Dynasty.''
   Now, he's ready for more challenging roles.
   ``I don't want to be this guy who everybody thinks is handsome
and women are crazy about. That's not enough,'' he said.

   Former congresman L. Richardson Preyer
got a building named after him on his 70th birthday to mark his more
than 30 years of public service.
   The 56-year-old Federal Building was renamed Wednesday the L.
Richardson Preyer Federal Building, Post Office &amp; Courthouse.
   The dedication, before a crowd of dignitaries, family and
friends, marked Preyer's service as a Superior Court judge, federal
judge, gubernatorial candidate and Democratic congressman.
   ``Now I know how a pancake feels after syrup has been poured on
it,'' Preyer said. ``After receiving such an honor, what am I going
to do when I grow up?''

   Actresses Britt Ekland and
Ursula Andress, two heroines of James Bond films, ran the risk of
U.N. censure when they arrived here Thursday to promote reruns of
the movies on local cable network.
   The actresses said they had no plans to perform during their
four-day visit, but still risk being placed on a United Nations
blacklist of performers who appear in South Africa. The U.N.
maintains the list to focus attention on South Africa's apartheid
policies of racial segregation.
   ``I know a lot of people who have come here to perform, been paid
a lot of money and then apologize about it later,'' Ms. Ekland said.
   ``I feel it's wrong to brand me anything, I'm not that
important,'' Ms. Ekland said at a news conference.
   The actresses will make promotional appearances for the M-Net
television network, which this year is showing 14 of the James Bond
films about the dashing secret agent 007.

   Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie Masloff touted the
joys of her favorite city on the nationally televised Pat Sajak Show
and put an end to rumors that she sometimes arrives at work with a
cup of homemade chicken soup.
   Mrs. Masloff, 70, said despite her grandmotherly manner, ``I can
be real tough.''
   The interview was taped Wednesday and broadcast early Thursday
for the new talk show that CBS began broadcasting Monday.
   Mrs. Masloff won't formally announce her candidacy for another
term as mayor until Jan. 19, but told Sajak, ``If you were a
gambling man, Pat, I'd tell you to put your money on the fact that I
may be running.''
