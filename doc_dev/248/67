   Avoiding the bothersome and time-consuming
process of actually writing original stories, filmmakers are
building new movies from a heap of dusty board games, old songs and
tattered comic books.
   ``Batman'' may not be the only movie adaptation, but the Caped
Crusader may set a record for having the most previous lives _ in a
variety of comic books, a TV series, three television cartoons and
two feature films.
   The latest is the Warner Bros. extravaganza starring Michael
Keaton as Batman and Jack Nicholson as his fiendish foil, the Joker.
   With an average $18 million riding on every studio release, it
pays to stick with retreads. Look at all the ``James Bond'' sequels.
See Jane Fonda remaking ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown'' _ a critically acclaimed movie by Spanish filmmaker
Pedro Almodovar that was released only last year. And watch Columbia
Pictures redo 1963's ``Lord of the Flies.''
   The plots for ``You Light Up My Life'' and ``Ode to Billy Joe''
were taken from old records. ``Clue'' and the upcoming ``Monopoly
the Movie'' were appropriated from parlor games.
   ``Batman,'' like the Superman films and a squadron of other
current and future live-action movies, are all inspired by comic
books: ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Brenda Starr,'' ``The Return of the Swamp
Thing,'' ``The Punisher,'' ``Captain America,'' ``Watchmen,''
``Spiderman,'' ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' and Home Box
Office's ``Tales From the Crypt.''
   ``There's something about the movie business that's really
voracious as far as stories and characters are concerned,'' said
director Wes Craven, who transformed a DC Comic into 1982's ``Swamp
Thing.''
   ``Since the characters and stories in comics are, in a sense,
pre-sold, there's a temptation to use a character that's already got
a running start.''
   Mark Freedman, who spun the independent comic ``Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles'' into a toy line, a television series and an upcoming
feature film, said, ``A lot of people didn't realize that comic
books were not necessarily a kiddie medium. ... Some comic books
deal with pretty serious topics.''
   Comics also unfold in a lively style that usually translates
easily to film, suggesting offbeat, imaginative cinematography.
   ``Actually, a comic is a visual movie,'' said the inventor of
``Captain America'' and veteran comic author Jack Kirby. ``It's a
movie drawn by hand.''
   But sometimes for the filmmaker, a comic's catchy graphic look is
as much a blessing as a curse.
   Director Alan Rudolph, attempting to make a movie based on Gary
Larson's ``The Far Side'' comic, has labored to convert Larson's
distinctive caricatures into living, breathing screen images. After
filming a five-minute ``Far Side'' test, Paramount Pictures passed
on the project last year. Rudolph is still trying to convince
another studio that his adaptation can work.
   And while comic-book writers never have to worry about the cost
of elaborate special effects, movie studios do.
   ``The real tricky thing in `Swamp Thing' was that the comic book
had a tremendous amount of mutation _ heads with just hands on them,
strange monsters _ and at that time the budget for the movie was
$2.5 million,'' said Craven. ``The effects were completely outside
of our budget. So we had to deal with more human villains and
creations. I think we used one dwarf.''
   Comic-book characters also have a diversity of personalities, and
movie studios are bound to select the personality with the broadest
possible audience appeal. Take Warner Bros., and its approach to
``Batman.''
   As remembered by fans of the television series and feature film
of the late 1960s, Batman is a campy crimefighter, a goofy
do-gooder. But those familiar with the early DC Comic recollect a
darker, obsessive figure. And in the 1986 Batman graphic novel
collection ``The Dark Knight Returns,'' the Caped Crusader is a
troubled vigilante. The latter two Batmans would never be mistaken
for matinee idols.
   Warner producers didn't seem sure which Batman they wanted. From
the final, dark ``Batman'' script written by Sam Hamm, to the upbeat
shooting script doctored by Warren Skaaren, Batman loses his
paranoid fears. The Joker, cast as a bizarre, overwhelmingly
malevolent criminal in Hamm's screenplay, appears as a droll, almost
lighthearted thug in the finished film.
   And that may leave some comic-book devotees disappointed.
   ``I'm going to see `Batman,''' said Ron Mann, director of the new
documentary ``Comic Book Confidential,'' which traces the history of
the comics. ``But it has nothing to do with the comic book _
absolutely nothing.''
