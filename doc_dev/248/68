When you consider the number of times its bones have been picked in recent 
years, there is still a lot of meat left on the carcass of MGM/UA that Pathe 
Communications Corp. agreed to buy Wednesday for about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
There is no more studio; the venerable Culver City lot where Louis B. Mayer and 
Irving Thalberg once reigned is now the lair of Sony's Columbia Pictures. The 
great MGM library, which stored such classics as "Gone With the Wind" and "The 
Wizard of Oz," is owned by Ted Turner. And the current MGM/UA doesn't own a 
clod of physical property; it just sold its last building to Kirk Kerkorian, 
the same man who profitably dismantled the studio in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
But Pathe still gets the untouched United Artists library, a studded collection 
of about 1,000 titles dating back to the post-World War I days when founders 
Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin and D. W. Griffith were 
massaging it into major studio status. 
</P>
<P>
But while Pathe benefits from that early outpouring of classics -- Griffith's 
"Broken Blossoms" and "Way Down East," Fairbank's "Robin Hood" and "The Thief 
of Baghdad," Pickford's "Pollyanna" and "Tess of the Storm Country," and 
Chaplin's "City Lights" and "Modern Times" -- it is the films of the Arthur 
Krim-Robert Benjamin management of the '50s through the '70s that will be best 
exploited by their new owner. 
</P>
<P>
Krim and Benjamin went on to form Orion Pictures in the late '70s, just before 
Michael Cimino brought the original studio down with "Heaven's Gate," but they 
left behind three major movie franchises -- the Pink Panther, Rocky and James 
Bond series -- that are still bearing ore today. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky V" is in current production, with Sylvester Stallone reunited with the 
series' first director John Avildsen. The untitled 17th James Bond episode will 
soon go into production. And the pilot for a prime-time "Pink Panther" series 
is being developed by MGM/UA for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Among some of the other prominent UA films: "Marty," the recently reissued 
"Raging Bull," "Exodus," "West Side Story," "Fiddler on the Roof," "Some Like 
it Hot," "In the Heat of the Night," "The Apartment" and "The Magnificent 
Seven." 
</P>
<P>
During the '70s, a decade that many critics consider Hollywood's true Golden 
Era, United Artists made many of Hollywood's toughest, timeliest and most 
commercial movies. UA's films of that decade alone -- "Annie Hall," "Coming 
Home," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Rocky," "Bound for Glory," and 
"Women in Love" -- will guarantee Pathe pride of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA, sometimes together and sometimes operating separately during the '80s, 
have suffered insecurity, inconsistent management and oft-rumored deaths, and 
product has also suffered. One of the few recent bright spots was "Rain Man," 
the hugely profitable 1988 film that swept the Oscars. Industry analysts expect 
the studio's coming video release of "Rain Man" to be one of the year's top 
sellers in that market. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its film library, Pathe's acquisition of MGM/UA brings it the 
worldwide home video and foreign pay-TV rights to the 2,950 films in the 
Turner/MGM library, that great batch of films that Turner took with him when he 
bought and then sold MGM five years ago. Turner bought the library to assure 
himself years of product for his Super Station, and has since begun colorizing 
scores of the best-known black and white films from the library (which also 
includes Warner Bros. films previously acquired by MGM) for TV syndication. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe, an international film production and distribution company that just last 
year bought the less glorious Cannon Films, brings several of its own projects 
to the party. The company, whose production chief Alan Ladd, Jr. came to them 
from MGM, has three films in production -- "Russia House," starring Sean 
Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer; "Fires Within," starring Jimmy Smits and Greta 
Scacchi, and "Quigley Down Under," with Tom Selleck. According to a studio 
spokesman, Pathe has also green-lighted a Sally Field film titled "Not Without 
My Daughter" and Mel Brooks' "Life Stinks." Mel Brooks' last film, 
"Spaceballs," was for also for MGM. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA's production head, Richard Berger, used to work for MGM under Ladd, 
prompting immediate speculation that he will resume that role once the Pathe 
deal is completed. MGM/UA Chairman Jeffrey Barbakow said on Tuesday that a 
Berger-Ladd merger is possible "down the road," but for now, it's business as 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming releases for MGM/UA, films made under Berger, include "Blue Steel," 
with Jamie Lee Curtis and Ron Silver, "Lisa," with Cheryl Ladd, "Daddy's Dyin', 
Who's Got the Will?," with Beau Bridges and Tess Harper, and -- for fans of 
irony -- Michael Cimino's "Desperate Hours," which was picked up for 
distribution from Dino de Laurentiis. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe is also buying into a television operation that is building up steam. 
MGM/UA has three series on the current prime-time network schedule -- 
"thirtysomething," "In the Heat of the Night" and "Young Riders" -- and is 
about to go into production on both the CBS "Pink Panther" pilot and a pilot 
for "Dark Shadows," which is being developed for NBC as a prime-time version of 
the Gothic day-time series that mesmerized college students of the late '60s. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA operates out of leased space in the Filmland building adjacent to its 
former lot, and out of the Gateway building in Santa Monica. The last property 
owned by MGM/UA -- an office building in Beverly Hills -- was sold last month 
to Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. for $48 million.
