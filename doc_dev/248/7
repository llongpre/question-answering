   In a movie world where studio bosses seem to
change chairs as frequently as they do shirts, one close-knit group
of filmmakers has been prospering for 27 years. They are the folks
who bring the biennial adventures of James Bond.
   ``Licence to Kill,'' a midsummer entry in the season of
blockbusters, boasts a veteran crew.
   Albert R. (Cubby) Broccoli has produced or co-produced all 16 of
the Bond films. Richard Maibaum has co-written 13. Desmond
Llewelleyn has played the gadget maker Q in 14. Peter Lamont has
been production designer for 14. John Barry has scored 11 Bond
films, though a conflict of assignments kept him from the new one
(Michael Kamen takes his place). John Glen has directed the last
five.
   In addition, stunt coordinators, special effects designers,
publicists, stunt men and others have long served the Bond pictures.
   Michael Wilson dates back to the 1964 ``Goldfinger,'' on which he
was an assistant director for the Fort Knox sequence. He has been
with Broccoli for 17 years, first as assistant, then executive
producer.
   In the recent films he has been co-producer and co-writer. The
New Yorker formerly practiced international taxation law, a good
background for worldwide filming.
   Interviewed in his office at MGM-UA, he was asked about the
peculiar _ to Americans _ spelling of ``Licence to Kill.''
   ``There was some discussion over whether we should spell it as
American usually do _ though the dictionary lists both `license,'
which comes first, and `licence,''' he said. ``In England, the noun
is always spelled `licence' and the verb is `license.' We decided
since we had a British subject and a British agent and Ian Fleming
had written it that way as a title, we would adopt that spelling.''
   Only the title is Fleming's; the plot was devised by the
filmmakers because all of Fleming's plots have been used up.
   Starting with ``Dr. No'' in 1962, the first five Bond films were
released annually. Now they come every other year, and that allows
for a more sensible pace.
   From the start, the Bond movies were unbeatable at the box office
with their winning combination of violence, mystery, exotic locales,
sex, sophistication, high-tech toys and almost campy humor.
   The Bond movies also made credit and pre-credit sequences
memorable bits to watch. In ``From Russia With Love,'' for example,
a man presumably with Bond's face is chased and killed. The titles
then emerge on the undulating body of a belly dancer.
   ``Licence to Kill'' began two years ago with a trip to China in
search of locales. Wilson and Maibaum tried a couple of stories
based in China but they didn't work out.
   The two writers decided to follow the headlines and spin a yarn
about a notorious drug dealer who controls a Latin American country.
The scripting period took about eight months.
   ``Normally, we begin our preproduction in February,'' said
Wilson. ``We started filming in Mexico in mid-July, and we finished
around Thanksgiving time. We go into post-production until around
Easter. Then we have the film ready for July release.''
   Unlike previous Bond movies that have spanned continents,
``Licence to Kill'' was shot in Mexico and Key West, Fla. The
company filmed interiors at Mexico City's Churubusco studio, street
scenes of ``Isthmus City'' in and around the capital and seaside
locations at Acapulco. A second unit worked at Mexicali in Baja for
14 weeks to stage a spectacular chase of tanker trucks, the climax
of the film.
   Despite the heavy logistics, Wilson reported that the cost of
``Licence to Kill'' was $30 million to $35 million. This, he said,
was about average for a big production these days.
   Timothy Dalton seems more comfortable in the new film than he did
in his first Bond outing, ``The Living Daylights.'' Wilson agreed.
   ``What happened was that when we first cast Dalton in `Living
Daylights,' we had already written the script. He came in very late,
and we had already written sort of a generic Bond. Dalton played it
in his style. After working with him on one film, it was quite
obvious that he could not or should not imitate the Roger Moore
style.
   ``Dalton brings something different,'' he said. ``This was an
opportunity for us to write a different direction for Bond, using
Timothy's personality as a catalyst. Four actors have played James
Bond (Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Moore, Dalton) and each has
brought a new approach to the character. That's what keeps the
series contemporary and intersting.''
   The producer would not reveal the contractual arrangements with
Dalton, but he indicated that both the producers and cast would like
to see the association continue.
   And the next adventure for Bond?
   ``We'll wait for this one to get out, take a little rest, then
start all over again.''
