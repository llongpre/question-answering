   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. says it has
formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters.
   Gerry Hogan, president of the new division, said Monday the new
branch will be called Turner Pictures and will go into operation
immediately.
   Its first two releases will be ``The Secret Life of Ian
Fleming,'' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote
the James Bond novels, and ``Treasure Island,'' starring Charlton
Heston.
   ``The development of Turner Pictures is a natural extension of
TBS's production of outstanding first-run television movies,''
Hogan said. ``Now, in addition to bringing American cable viewers
the best in film entertainment on a selected basis, we will bring
our work to movie audiences around the world.''
   Turner Pictures' productions will be internationally syndicated
by Turner Program Services, and Turner Home Entertainment
International will distribute the films to theaters and home-video
distributors.
