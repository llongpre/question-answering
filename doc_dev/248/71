   That striking man who had a rendezvous with a
beautiful woman in front of the Ukraine Hotel on Friday looked
familiar. A lot like Bond _ James Bond.
   It was, in fact, Sean Connery, with actress Michelle Pfeiffer _
his co-star in ``The Russia House,'' the film version of John Le
Carre's latest spy novel now being made in Moscow.
   ``Of course, the KGB has a dossier on me,'' said the 59-year-old
Scottish actor, who made a career out of playing the Soviet
intelligence agency's formidable foe. ``That's why they let me in.''
   ``My dossier in Washington is even bigger than the KGB file,''
Connery said with a smile.
   This time, Connery plays a book publisher recruited by British
intelligence after he comes into contact with a Soviet scientist
smuggling defense secrets.
   ``Spying is waiting,'' a character in Le Carre's novel says. The
same is true of movie-making, said the film's producer, Paul
Maslansky, as the actors and dozens of extras went through two
hours of take after take in a freezing drizzle in front of the
hotel.
   Maslansky said the filming at Soviet locations, which began in
Leningrad Oct. 2, costs up to $10,000 an hour, excluding the
actors' salaries. The total cost of five weeks of filming in the
Soviet Union will be $2.5 million, he said.
   Maslansky said the filming was made possible because of the
``glasnost,'' or openness, policy of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. ``Under previous leaderships, there would have been a
problem filming a Le Carre novel,'' he said.
   Instead, Maslansky said, there has been nothing but cooperation.
   Not that the story line is anti-Soviet. If ``The Russia House''
has villains, they are the old-style American bureaucrats who
refuse to shed their Cold War mentality and reflexes when faced
with new realities.
   Although the script was reviewed by the state-run film company
Mosfilm, Maslansky said there were no attempts to alter the
chronicle of the Soviet scientist's attempt to smuggle military
secrets to the West, using a woman named Katya (Pfeiffer) as a
conduit.
   ``Its really a love story set against the Soviet Union,''
Maslansky said. ``Mosfilm read the script only to make sure it
wasn't anti-Soviet or pornographic.''
   During filming, he said, curious Soviets come not to see the
stars, but to watch the film crew of Soviets and Westerners eat
food shipped in from Britain because of shortages and lack of
variety in the Soviet capital.
   ``All the food is catered from London, feeding up to 150 people
daily,'' the producer said. ``People come from all over just to
look at the food ... It's kind of sad.''
   The California-born Pfeiffer said playing a Russian woman,
accent and all, is the biggest challenge of her acting career. She
is being coached in dialect and spends as much time as possible
with Soviet members of the crew.
   ``It's the most difficult role I have ever done,'' she said,
``the first character of a completely different culture.''
   The producers expect ``The Russia House'' to be released in
1990. Its release will coincide with the publication of the novel
in Russian _ another example of glasnost.
   The book also will be serialized this year by two magazines, the
monthly Foreign Literature and the weekly Ogonyok, the producers
said.
   The British author's previous works include ``The Spy Who Came
in From the Cold'' and ``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.''
