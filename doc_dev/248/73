   Holy box office! What's a caped crusader to
do? After being the hit of the summer, he's the flop of the fall _
in Norway, at least.
   Despite an extensive promotional campaign here, the megabuck
smash movie ``Batman,'' has been upstaged at the box office by
``Licence to Kill'' and ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.''
   In Norway, even Donald Duck has been more popular than the
Batman comic for decades.
   Inspired by its worldwide success _ the movie has grossed more
than $248 million at the U.S. box office alone, and has set
all-time opening weekend records in Italy, Spain, Mexico, Portugal
and Britain _ the film's distributor hoped to trigger a little
Batmania in Norway.
   Warner Bros. Norge AS, the movie's distributor, wallpapered much
of Norway with Batman posters and stickers, in its biggest
promotion campaign ever in this small Scandinavian country.
   ``Batwho?'' responded Norwegians.
   Few had heard of Batman, even under his Norwegian comic book
name, Lynvingen, or Lightning Wing. When the comic first appeared
here in 1953, Lynvingen was the name chosen because Batman,
literally translated, means something like the Fluttering Mouse Man.
   Warner Bros. Norge kept the original title, ``Batman,'' for the
movie and set out to make it a household word with a promotion
campaign that was unusually agressive by Norwegian standards.
   Newspapers widely reported the hubbub preceding the film, which
inspired such inventions as Batdances and Batdrinks. Norwegians who
were caught up in the fad bought Batman hats, T-shirts, posters,
toys and trinkets, all emblazoned with the familiar winged
silouette.
   But few bought tickets to the movie.
   Batman got walloped at the box office during the first two weeks
after the movie's opening Oct. 5. It drew 26,427 in Oslo, compared
to 50,761 for the James Bond film ``Licence to Kill'' and 51,133
for ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' according to the Oslo
Muncipal Cinemas, which rated the sales as ``not good.''
   When the blockbuster premiered in 36 Norwegian cities, many of
the 40 theaters were less than one-third full.
   ```Batman' hasn't played to our expectations,'' said Lillemor
Kosell, of Warner Bros. ```Batman' is somewhat of an American
phenomenon. People don't know him very well. This was by far the
biggest promotion we ever attempted here.'' She refused to disclose
the amount spent.
   Among critics, Batmania became Batmoania. One wrote, ``Batman
was better before he got here.''
   The movie's billboards, posters and full-page newspaper
advertisements succeeded in spreading Batman's name, but in the
weeks before the premiere many Norwegians still wondered why he
climbed around on buildings in his pajamas and a cape.
   Anders Giaever, a reporter and comic book collector, tried to
help with ``The Beginners Guide to Batman,'' published in the Oslo
daily Arbeiderbladet.
   ``The whole thing is a little foreign,'' said Giaever.
``Norwegians don't have the background. Most haven't seen the
comic, and the TV series was never shown here.''
   But the modest level of Batmania in Norway has nothing to do
with comic books, movies, television or even Batman, said Gro
Svendsen of the Oslo department store Steen and Stroem, which sells
Batman hats and T-shirts.
   ``Norwegians read so much about Batmania in America that it's
the fad, the fashion itself, they are interested in,'' she said.
   ``Sales are nothing phenomenal, compared to products inspired by
a film like `E.T.' But Batman T-shirts are big with the skateboard
set.''
   The ``skateboard set,'' 12- to 14-year-olds, might have flocked
to the movie had the the age limit not been set at 15, Kosell said.
The state film control board deemed ``Batman'' too violent for
children.
   Kjell Johnsen, the 22-year-old editor of the local ``Batman''
comic, ``Linvingen,'' said the movie might boost his comic's sales,
which are lackluster compared to Donald Duck and other best sellers.
   One happy note for Gotham City's dark prince, because of Warner
Bros.' promotion, the comic book's name will be changed back to
Batman.
