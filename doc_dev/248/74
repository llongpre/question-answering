   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Here's a bookstore for the cloak-and-dagger set,
one of Washington's best-kept secrets, a reservoir of reading
material for would-be spooks and espionage fans. Understandably,
most of the customers of the National Intelligence Book Center
prefer to remain anonymous.

   Psst! Tucked away on the sixth floor of a
downtown Washington office building is a bookstore for spies, where
you can learn how to change your identity, determine if your
telephone is bugged, look inside the KGB or get some self-help
guidance on becoming an agent.
   But you almost have to engage in espionage to find the National
Intelligence Book Center, which specializes in books, magazines,
computer software and tapes on spies, cryptography, surveillance,
the CIA, the KGB and spooks of all kinds.
   It is one of Washington's secrets, this whispery one-room shop.
Once you find it, there are plenty of clues that this is not your
run-of-the-mill bookstore.
   Access is controlled by a high-tech security door. Callers on
hold are treated to tape-recorded readings from famous spy tales.
The store is open to the public only three days a week and visitors
must check packages in lockers before entering.
   There is no telling who you'll bump into among the clientele.
   Elizabeth Bancroft, the store's founder and director, refuses to
name her customers. They prefer to remain covert. But patrons
include famous authors, literary editors, doctors, lawyers and, of
course, government officials from the United States and abroad.
   One customer of Ms. Bancroft's mail-order service was said to be
the late William J. Casey, former director of the CIA and author of
``The Secret War Against Hitler,'' posthumously published memoirs
of his service in the CIA's World War II forerunner, the Office of
Strategic Services. Norman Mailer and Jacqueline Onassis reportedly
have contacted the store.
   ``It's a crossroads for people in the intelligence community,''
says writer Jim Hougan. ``I consider myself knowledgeable in this
area, but some of the stuff in her store is really astonishing.''
   Joseph Goulden, another writer hooked on true spy tales, limits
himself to about one visit a month. ``If I went too often, I'd be
broke. I could easily spend $2,000 in there.''
   Browsers _ there are about 30 or 40 a day _ often spend several
hours at the center. Ms. Bancroft said she finally had to remove
chairs from the room to prevent patrons from parking themselves all
day.
   Ms. Bancroft, a crisp, black-haired woman who turned her
fascination with the netherworld of spying into her life's work,
prides herself on the range of books she has compiled.
   Most of the 1,400 titles are non-fiction, but the center stocks
a smattering of spy fiction, such as the works of John Le Carre and
Ian Fleming's James Bond stories.
   The store carries everything from the Soviet-inspired ``Devil
and His Dart: How the CIA Is Plotting in the Third World,'' to
``The Whole Spy Catalogue: an Espionage Lovers' Guide'' and David
Kahn's seminal volume on cryptography, ``The Code Breakers.''
Foreign language books are also displayed, mainly Russian and
French.
   On the lighter side, there are coffee mugs displaying KGB and
CIA emblems, government maps, ``James Bond's Bedside Companion,''
the ``Comic Book of MI5'' and a how-to book on passing the FBI's
entrance exam. The shop doesn't stock material on explosives or
silencers.
   The most popular books, Ms. Bancroft says, are from obscure
publishers: ``How To Disappear Completely And Never Be Found'' and
``How To Create A New Identity.'' The latter, written by
``Anonymous,'' outlines step-by-step ways to get a new driver's
license, credit cards, birth certificate and other documents.
   Among the duds: anything to do with the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``I had to give some Ollie North books away because no one was
buying them,'' Ms. Bancroft says. North, a former Marine lieutenant
colonel, has been indicted for his role in selling weapons to Iran
and diverting the profits to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Bancroft, a Harvard-educated New Yorker who had worked as a
professional fund-raiser before she plunged into the book business,
started the center as a mail-order operation in her home about two
years ago. She specialized in finding obscure books on intelligence
gathering.
   So successful was the operation _ people routinely showed up at
her doorstep _ that she sold her house, moved into an apartment and
stocked a rented office with books. She expanded into new quarters
in the same building a few months ago.
   Until just recently, Ms. Bancroft didn't advertise. The shop
depended on whisper-of-mouth for customers to learn of its
existence.
   Although she has received strong moral support from well-known
ex-CIA officials, Ms. Bancroft says financing for the store comes
from private investors and loans.
   ``We have had people invest who are interested in the subject
matter, but no one I know of is being funded by an intelligence
group,'' she says.
   With only one assistant, Ms. Bancroft often works 18-hour days,
answering questions from customers, ordering books and wrapping
packages at the store, which started to turn a profit recently.
   Bancroft has no plans to expand to a regular, street-level
operation.
   ``People like the idea that we are hidden away,'' she says.
Besides, she adds, ``I am not big on dealing with the public.''
