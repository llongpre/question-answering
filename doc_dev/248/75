   Car bombs, corporate spies,
hijackings everywhere: The headlines are enough to make a
millionaire shake in his Guccis.
   They're also causing CEOs, sheiks and stars from Kenny Rogers to
Michael Jackson to seek out a host of high-tech security devices
that would turn 007's head.
   ``Are You Bugged?'' asks the poster at the front desk of CCS
Communication Control Inc., where specialties include briefcases
stuffed with telephone scramblers, wiretap detectors and ``bug
alerts'' disguised as watches.
   The shah of Iran once hired the company to build a limousine
with an ``Armageddon device'' to explode unless disarmed, a pop-out
motorcycle in the trunk and other James Bond-like features.
   The makers of ``Miami Vice'' have rented night-vision scopes,
debuggers and long-distance microphones and occasionally call up to
consult for the sake of realism, said Tom Salway, head of the CCS
Beverly Hills office.
   Salway is reluctant to discuss celebrity purchases in detail,
but he outlines a few: Singer Kenny Rogers stopped by for a
bulletproof briefcase, actor Roddy McDowall bought a disguised
tape-recording system and representatives of superstar eccentric
Michael Jackson often drop in.
   ``They're always checking up on what's available,'' he said.
   When the company began nearly two decades ago, it sold only a
few wiretap and hidden microphone detectors. Now about 300 products
are offered, Salway said.
   Among the items available for heads of state and corporations,
security forces, private eyes, gadget-lovers and the merely
paranoid:
   _``Supercars'' that spew tear gas and oil slicks. Occupants
breathe bottled oxygen, fire weapons through portholes in armor,
and navigate through smoke and the dark with an infrared system.
   _Letter bomb detectors, in case enemies use the mail.
   _More than a dozen bullet-resistant vests, shirts, coats and
jackets. Sales soared after recent reports of random freeway
shootings, Salway said.
   _Video cameras disguised in books, bamboo stalks and clocks.
   _A voice ``microtremor'' detector advertised as a portable lie
detector that ``can help determine ... if your friends are really
your friends.''
   Salway said insurance companies use it to help determine if
claimed losses are real.
   Producers for entertainer Joan Rivers' talk show approached CCS
about using the tremor detector to catch guests in lies, but she
was replaced as permanent host of the Fox Broadcasting Co. show
last May before she could.
   ``It would have been so much fun,'' Miss Rivers said recently.
``It would have been the kind of thing I do.''
   But most seek out high-tech security for deadly serious reasons.
   ``Probably there's been more corporate interest in
anti-terrorism in the last year or two than there has been in the
25 years I have been in the business,'' said Philip W. Little,
president of West Coast Detectives.
   Little, a former sheriff's deputy who opened his own private-eye
business in 1971 and bought West Coast Detectives in 1977, says
West Coast doubled in size in 1986 and grew substantially in 1987.
``And it's all related to anti-terrorism.''
   He tells stars and chief executive officers that terrorist
groups have moved from the Mideast and Europe to Latin America, and
the United States is the next stop.
   Little said clients include ``television and movie studios, oil,
finance, electronics, aerospace, every manufacturing concern you
can imagine.''
   West Coast Detective's anti-terrorist division tries to do for
private companies and people what the Secret Service does for the
president, Little said. Many clients are Americans traveling abroad.
   In Southern California, protecting the homes of high-profile
business people and entertainers, especially those with children,
is a major part of the business.
   ``They have such a high profile that they feel they must take
action _ they know you or anyone can find out where they are if you
want to,'' Little said.
   Infrared cameras that see in the dark, alarms throughout the
house, and ``panic buttons'' in the bedroom are part of a typical
setup. Perimeters of celebrity properties typically have visible
but well-dressed guards.
   ``Very professional, an executive look,'' Little said. ``So you
don't create fear in the minds of children or a wife _ you don't
want to so overdo the threat that you create paranoia.''
   Little and Salway said many corporate chiefs are worried more by
devious employees or snoopers from the competition or the
government than by terrorism.
   Bug-detector business boomed after the arrest of stock
speculator Ivan Boesky in the Wall Street insider trading scandal
and reports that Boesky, cooperating with investigators, had
allowed his business conversations to be recorded, Salway said.
