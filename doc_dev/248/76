   The Caped Crusader, Indiana Jones, a couple of cops and some shrunken kids boosted Hollywood to a record-breaking blockbuster summer. 

   The final tally won't be completed until the end of this week, but A.D. Murphy, who compiles data for industry weekly Variety, began predicting two weeks ago that the summer box-office take could reach $2.05 billion or more, a 20% increase over the 1988 summer peak of $1.7 billion. 
"It's just a question now of what the second decimal point is -- $2.05 or $2.06 billion," Mr. Murphy says. 

   What's more, he adds, if box-office performance from Labor Day onward increases by just 12% over last year -- which is the rate of improvement to date in 1989 -- the industry will set a record of $5 billion, compared with $4.46 billion last year. 
And since domestic theatrical exhibition accounts for only 35% of Hollywood's revenues from a film, compared with 75% a decade ago, the leading studios stand to reap even biggger rewards from their hits in such post-theatrical markets as videocassettes and cable television. 

   While ticket prices are up about 10% over last year, Mr. Murphy and other industry observers note that five movies did more than $100 million at the box office, and about a half-dozen more took in $50 million to $85 million, an unusually high number of hits. 

   At the top of the heap, as expected, is Warner Bros., now a unit of Time-Warner Inc. Thanks largely to "Batman" and "Lethal Weapon 2," which have grossed $238.5 million and $131.3 million, respectively, Warner holds the No. 1 spot in the industry with a box-office market share of more than 23%. 
Next in line is Walt Disney Co. with 17% of the market, while Paramount Communications Inc.'s Paramount Pictures Corp. unit and Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. are vying for third place, according to Mr. Murphy. 

   Paramount and Columbia's success wasn't a big surprise; both studios depended almost entirely on sequels to previously successful blockbusters. 
"Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade," the third in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" series, has grossed more than $189 million so far for Paramount, while Columbia Pictures released "Ghostbusters 2," which has taken in more than $110 million at the box office. 
Paramount's "Star Trek V" has grossed about $50 million, while Columbia's "Karate Kid III" has sold about $40 million in tickets. 
Although neither film performed as well as expected, the revenues are still considered respectable. 

   The big surprise this summer was the performance of three Disney films: "Honey I Shrunk the Kids," which has grossed over $119 million; "Dead Poet's Society," at over $85 million; and "Turner &amp; Hootch," at over $52 million. 
While some industry observers initially feared such movies would get lost in the shuffle, Disney was able to get them noticed. 
"This was the summer for the marketers to put it all on the line," said Larry Gerbrandt, a move analyst at investment firm Paul Kagan Associates. 
Despite all the competition, Disney was "really able to get the message across," he added. 

   But big stars and sequels didn't work in every case. 
Sylvester Stallone's movie for the Tri-Star unit of Columbia, "Lock-Up," has taken in less than $20 million, and the latest MGM/UA James Bond film, "Licence to Kill," has sold only about $32 million of tickets. 
New Line Cinema Inc.'s "Nightmare on Elm Street Part V" has sold only about $18 million of tickets in three weeks and is falling off fast. 
By contrast, the fourth "Nightmare" movie took in about $50 million. 

   Philip Garfinkle, executive vice president of Entertainment Data Inc., notes that pictures such as "Licence to Kill" and "Lock-Up" might perform better overseas. 
In the case of the James Bond movie, he says, international audiences might enable the picture to exceed $100 million in revenues. 

   Although summer business began to drop off in the week prior to Labor Day, a number of more adult-oriented films show promise for continued fall business, such as Columbia's "When Harry Met Sally," which has grossed more than $60 million, and "Parenthood," which has grossed about $55 million for the Universal Studios unit of MCA Inc.
