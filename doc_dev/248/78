   For actor Roger Moore, James Bond is a closed
chapter, except for occasional snatches of Bondian repartee.
   ``The only time you don't want a tape recorder is under the
bed,'' he jokes to an interviewer on the set of ``Bullseye,'' his
latest movie.
   Moore, who took over from Sean Connery as Agent 007, is 62 now
and taking it easy. He tried a musical and quit during rehearsals.
``Bullseye,'' he says, is ``an extension of our home life,''
because it pairs him with an old friend, Michael Caine. His
daughter also has a part.
   He has an easy, unpretentious manner, and looks fit enough to do
another Bond movie or two. But ``A View to a Kill,'' in 1985, was
his seventh and last and there are no plans for him to play the
role again. Before that he did eight years as ``The Saint'' on
television.
   In ``Bullseye,'' he and Caine play double roles as a pair of
unsuccessful con men and as crooked atom scientists selling state
secrets. Sally Kirkland, a 1987 Academy Award nominee for ``Anna,''
plays the girl they once shared. Deborah Barrymore, Moore's
26-year-old daughter, plays an undercover CIA agent.
   The $15 million comedy caper, directed by Michael Winner
(``Death Wish,'' ``A Chorus of Disapproval''), comes from Menahem
Golan's 21st Century productions, and is due for U.S. release late
next summer.
   Leslie Bricusse's script allows Moore to show off a David
Niven-esque comic touch that was often lacking in the Bond movies.
   Moore traces his friendship with the 56-year-old Caine to the
1960s, when he bumped into him on a London street.
   ``I'd seen him on TV, stopped him and told him I thought he had
a future,'' recalled Moore, adding teasingly: ``It shows how wrong
I was.''
   Michael and Shakira Caine and Roger and Luisa Moore have often
stayed with each other in Switzerland or Los Angeles. Their first
children were born six weeks apart, so the two wives ``shared''
their pregnancies, Moore said.
   Both actors are of humble London origins: Caine an East End
cockney, Moore a policeman's son. But Moore says their approach to
work is different.
   Unlike the ever-busy Caine, Moore insists: ``I'm very happy not
working. ... I don't need work to keep me happy.''
   ``If you really want to act you have to want to do it more than
anything. You have to be willing to put up with crap at all levels,
including the food you eat and sometimes the food you don't eat,''
he said.
   He surprised the entertainment world by taking a singing role in
Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical, ``Aspects of Love.'' But he
bowed out in March, six weeks into rehearsal, saying he couldn't
sing the part.
   ``It's all right, I suppose, if you're 20: You jump in, and you
do it. Otherwise, you're up there to be sniped at; it's very much a
no-win situation.''
   He has one film awaiting release, ``Bed and Breakfast'' with
Talia Shire and Colleen Dewhurst, and another comedy set to roll
early next year.
   He thinks acting is a tougher profession than when he started
out more than 30 years ago.
   ``There were more provincial theaters, more repertory theaters,
more of a chance to learn acting,'' said Moore, who spent three
terms at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art before leaving to
get practical experience in provincial repertory.
   ``Now, you're thrown into the deep end; you don't have time to
learn. No one has time to teach you anything.''
   He says he is neutral about his daughter's decision to go into
acting.
   ``I didn't encourage her, I didn't discourage her,'' said Moore,
who has two other children, both sons. ``There's a lot of heartache
attached to it, a lot of hard work.''
   Deborah Moore is a graduate of the London Academy of Music and
Dramatic Art. She changed her stage surname to Barrymore because
there's another Deborah Moore in British Equity, the actors' union.
   Her father doesn't think his fame has advanced her career: ``I
think I've been a hindrance to her.
   ``There are an awful lot of socialists out there who hate
success, who hate anything associated with success, so they think
I'm successful and they say, `Oh, we'll get somebody else.'
   ``You will note,'' he added wryly, ``that I am slightly right
wing of Attila.''
   Nepotism, Moore says, is not what it used to be.
   He says people think Deborah's related to Drew Barrymore, the
young star of ``E.T The Extraterrestrial,'' and adds with a laugh:
``It makes it worse.''
