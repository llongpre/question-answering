WHEN THE SIVER SCREEN TURNS RED: OPINIONS ON MOVIE VIOLENCE; 
</P>
<P>
'BATMAN THE KILLER IS NOT A HERO FOR OUR TIMES...' 
</P>

<P>
Try comparing the carnage in the 1967 James Bond film "You Only Live Twice" 
(shown on television here last Sunday) to the latest film; "License to Kill" 
doesn't even come close. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two years ago the Bond movie included two people eaten alive by piranha, 
myriad stabbings, shootings and poisonings, a pitched battle with a body count 
in the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
Protest all you like against the current upswing in movie violence (like Sheila 
Benson in her July 23 article, I too found the Joker's art-museum rampage in 
"Batman" highly objectionable), but leave "Licence to Kill" out of it; as these 
things go, it's kids stuff.
