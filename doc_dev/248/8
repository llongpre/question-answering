   EDITOR'S NOTE: American writer Alexandra Ripley has the
unenviable job of doing the sequel to Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone
With the Wind.'' For advice, she might turn to John Gardner, the
British thriller writer who took on the task to continue the James
Bond sagas after Ian Flemming's death.

   John Gardner is not just a thriller
writer but a master of a very special art: the posthumous sequel.
   At his home in this English village west of London, the
61-year-old author writes James Bond novels, having picked up where
007's creator, Ian Fleming, left off when he died in 1964.
   While American writer Alexandra Ripley is just beginning a
sequel to Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind,'' Gardner has
already turned out seven Bond novels, each a best seller in the
United States. The most recent, ``Scorpius,'' is in its sixth
consecutive week on the New York Times best-seller list.
   ``It was a challenge, a little honor,'' Gardner recalled of his
decision to accept a publisher's offer in 1979 to write a Bond
sequel.
   He had already made a name with his books about the adventurer
Boysie Oakes, and with such cloak-and-dagger yarns as ``The Dancing
Dodo'' and ``The Nostradamus Traitor.'' He had also written two
novels featuring Sherlock Holmes' nemesis, Professor Moriarty.
   So when Glidrose Publications, Bond's literary copyright owners,
offered him a shot at old 007 himself, he thought, ``Why not? If I
don't do it, somebody else will.''
   Gardner was then living in Ireland as a tax exile, and already
one Bond sequel, ``Colonel Sun,'' had been published in 1968 by
Kingsley Amis, author of such acclaimed novels as ``Lucky Jim'' and
``One Fat Englishman.'' Amis wrote it under the pseudonym Robert
Markham.
   Gardner first encountered Bond while in bed with the flu in the
early 1960s, when his wife, Margaret, brought ``Casino Royale'' and
``Dr. No'' from the library.
   ``I was absolutely enchanted,'' he recalled.
   ``Fantasy, formula, fun are the three F's of Bond writing,'' he
said in an interview.
   The exploits of the suave, self-possessed hero, a man both
dressed and licensed to kill, demand a lot from a writer, Gardner
said.
   The trick, he says, is to make the Bond novels ``look as if
they've been thrown off in one afternoon. ... You can't let readers
see the joints anywhere.''
   ``I sit down to do Bond and within about four days, I'm cutting
lines out and making it run very fast,'' he said. ``Every chapter I
write I have to go back and say, `no, you can take two lines out
there and you can say that in three words.'
   ``It has to be that tight,'' he said. ``These are books to be
read in an airplane or on a beach.''
   His contract calls for two more Bond novels. Under a separate
agreement he is writing the book of the forthcoming ``License
Revoked,'' the first Bond movie not drawn directly from a Fleming
book.
   Movies, Gardner said, pose the greatest obstacle to
sequel-writing.
   ``People remember the movies far better than the books,'' he
said. ``There's a universal myth that Bond drove an Aston Martin.
He didn't, except for a very short time in `Goldfinger.' He drove a
very old Bentley.''
   Gardner said he had tried to bring his champagne-drinking hero
up to date with AIDS and glasnost.
   ``You can make him a man of the '80s, make him adapt to the
women's movement, the strictures under which we live, all that,''
he said. ``(But) I've had to get round the business of him
transporting arms on normal flights, and of course the technology
has changed so greatly.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome posed specific problems for
the libidinous Bond. He tried to work in a joke about condoms but
his publishers rejected it.
   Nor is he allowed to give Bond depth: ``I can't in any way
relate to him as a character like I can to my own. Bond is
one-dimensional; that is one of his successes. His novels are kiss
kiss, bang bang adventures.''
   He is reticent about his earnings from the Bond books, saying:
``I get a percentage of a percentage of a percentage. It puts a
tiny bit of jam on top of the money I earn through my other
writing.''
   Gardner's immediate future looks relatively Bond-free. ``Secret
Families,'' the last in a trilogy about espionage from 1910 to the
present day, will appear next May.
   After ``License Revoked'' he plans ``a modern blockbusting novel
a la Jeffrey Archer'' focusing on the life of a symphony conductor.
   Meanwhile, his only advice to such sequel-writers as Alexandra
Ripley is to be faithful to the original, but not unduly so: ``Try
and make it your own.''
