   Federal agents who suspected that
smugglers had developed an underground pipeline crossing the
Mexican border found a tunnel today ``like something out of a James
Bond movie,'' a Customs spokeswoman said.
   The tunnel was about the length of a football field and 30 feet
underground, Judy Turner, a Customs spokeswoman in Houston, said in
telephone interviews.
   She said it was 5 feet high, 4 feet wide, well lighted, and had
concrete piers for support. At various points were compartments
where up to five tons of drugs could be stashed.
   One entrance was in a Douglas warehouse about 200 feet north of
the border, and the other was in a house in Agua Prieta, Mexico,
only 73 feet south of the fence that separates the border cities,
Ms. Turner said.
   The house featured a compressor-operated system of hydraulic
jacks that raised and lowered the entire floor of the structure for
entrance to the tunnel.
   ``It was just an exceptionally, professionally engineered
tunnel,'' Ms. Turner said. ``It was something that you and I in the
ordinary world would only find in the movies. It was like something
out of a James Bond movie.
   ``It also points up the fact of why the Southwest border is
considered such a high-intensity drug-trafficking area.''
   She said agents believe it took six months to dig the tunnel and
that it had been used for about six months.
   Federal agents used jackhammers and torches to break into the
tunnel this morning.
   Ms. Turner said Customs had suspected the tunnel's existence and
that agents used aerial surveillance to track the shipment of 2,258
pounds of cocaine from Douglas to a spot outside Phoenix on May 11.
There they confiscated the haul and arrested two people.
   Mexican authorities arrested two other people late Thursday or
early today in Agua Prieta, Ms. Turner said.
   Federal agents searched several residences in Douglas and seized
a ranch near Phoenix and two businesses _ the Douglas Building
Supply Co. and Douglas Redi-Mix Cement Co.
   Ms. Turner did not immediately know the identities of those
arrested.
