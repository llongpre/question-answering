<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WHILE United Artists and producer Cubby Broccoli fret over the big-screen fate
of James Bond (now that Timothy Dalton has bombed), director William Dear and
writer Darren Star have jumped in with a spiffy spy spoof called "If Looks
Could Kill" (opening today).;    Richard Grieco, of TV's "21 Jump Street" and
"Booker," stars as a likable screw-up, who, while traveling with his French
class in Paris, is mistaken for a CIA operative. Oscar-winner Linda Hunt and
England's Roger Rees play the archfiends bent on supplanting the European
Community with their own financial system. They're wonderfully petty and
nasty, in the style of the best OO7 adversaries.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There have been umpteen lousy Bond spoofs, ranging from "Casino Royale" to
"Never Too Young to Die." So we had every reason to expect "Looks" to
self-destruct on liftoff.;    Dear and his impish-to-dopey hero surprise with
a fun, fast-paced little comedy-thriller laced with decent cliff-hanger
moments, amusing comebacks and enough lethal gadgets to bring a smile to Q's
lips.;    Mostly, though, Dear and Co. have succeeded where others haven't by
understanding the appeal of the classic Bonds and then affectionately ribbing
same, without -- wonder of wonders! -- ever mentioning 007 by name or quoting
his signature electric-guitar theme. Rated: PG-13 (for violence, profanity).
