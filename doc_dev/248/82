<LEADPARA>  JUST when you thought all the fabled "lost episodes" of old television shows
already had been found, along comes the biggest boodle of them all.;   
Naturally, I refer to the "lost" episodes of "The Avengers," the legendary
British spy spoof that arrived in the United States in the mid-1960s and
turned into one of TV's evergreen hits in perennial reruns.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Would you believe 51 episodes were never seen in this country? That's the
treasure trove the Arts &amp; Entertainment (A&amp;E) cable network starts digging
into Friday at 3 p.m.;    It's amazing how much excitement can be generated
among TV fans when a "lost" episode turns up. When CBS found and ran the
original pilot for "I Love Lucy" in prime time last year, it became the week's
ratings sensation.;    Similar excitement was stirred up when Showtime
resurrected the so-called "lost" episodes of "The Honeymooners," dusty
kinescope (filmed off a TV screen) copies of live "Honeymooners" sketches
performed on Jackie Gleason's variety shows before "The Honeymooners" became a
TV series of its own.;    But to cultish fans of "The Avengers," the chance to
see so many rare early episodes of their favorite show threatens to provoke
sensory overload.;    Casual "Avengers" viewers probably never knew the show
was in its fifth year when ABC imported it in 1966 as the first British-made
series to get a prime-time slot on a U.S. TV network's fall lineup.;    The
edition of "The Avengers" that became a rage in the United States featured
Patrick Macnee as debonair John Steed; lithe, lovely Diana Rigg as Emma Peel,
his colleague in spy adventures for the British government; and their "boss,"
a man named "Mother" (Patrick Newell).;    With his bowler hat, antique cars
and sedentary style, Steed was the antithesis of dashing James Bond, then the
hottest spy figure on the theater screen. Mrs. Peel, a widow, handled most of
the action for Steed. She kicked men around something awful, no doubt breeding
a generation of boys with fantasies of being karate-chopped by erotic Emma.;  
 Before "The Avengers" ran out of steam on ABC, Rigg had left to try her luck
on the big screen. She was replaced by Tara King (Linda Thorson), who somehow
didn't seem quite the dominatrix Emma was.;    "The Avengers" was finally
retired in 1969 but continued to live on in syndicated reruns, even growing in
momentum. It was revived in England in 1976 as "The New Avengers," pairing
Steed with two new partners, Purdey (Joanna Lumley) and Gambit (Gareth Hunt).
CBS sucked the last bit of marrow from the show's bones by running "The New
Avengers" in late night, starting in 1978.;    But the continual craving for
more episodes by a new generation of "Avengers" freaks finally inspired the
A&amp;E network to go after the early black-and-white editions, shows previously
thought to be too inferior in technical quality for today's viewers.;   
Here's what the treasure chest contains: 42 shows starring Macnee as Steed
opposite his original "partner," Catherine Gale (Honor Blackman), six with
partner Venus Smith (Julie Stevens) and three with male sidekick Dr. Martin
King (John Rollason).;    Blackman's Mrs. Gale was the prototype for Emma Peel
-- a tough but sexy female as shrewdly intelligent as she was athletically
explosive.;    Ironically, both of Steed's most popular partners later wound
up with his rival, James Bond. Blackman played the villainous Pussy Galore
opposite Sean Connery's Bond in "Goldfinger" (1964) and Rigg actually married
Agent 007 (played by one-shot Bond George Lazenby) in 1969's "On Her Majesty's
Secret Service." (She was killed in the finale.);    Both actresses remain
very active in British television. Blackman stars in the sitcom "The Upper
Hand," the English version of "Who's the Boss?," playing the sexy mother role
Katherine Helmond plays in the United States. Rigg is host of PBS's "Mystery"
series and starred in this season's premiere, "Mother Love.";    For years,
American "Avengers" fans have wondered which of the sexy widows was Steed's
best partner -- Mrs. Peel or the legendary Mrs. Gale. Now, thanks to A&amp;E, they
finally can make up their minds. (box)  </TEXT>
