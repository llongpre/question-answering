   ``Another Woman'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated PG)
   
   Marion (Gena Rowlands) is a successful college professor,
financially secure, well-married, cultured and elegant. She also is
miserable, though at the start of Woody Allen's ``Another Woman''
she is not aware that she is.
   She is so separated from her feelings she is awakened only by the
mournful talk of Hope (Mia Farrow) to her therapist, heard through a
heating vent in Marion's office.
   What Marion says she needs in order to work on her book could
also be what she needs to maintain her balance in the life she has
created: ``It requires that I really shut myself off from everything
but the work.''
   Hope's sadness forces Marion to confront her own passionless
life, and the possibilities for passion she rejected again and
again, primarily when she married Ken (Ian Holm) and rejected Ken's
best friend, Larry (Gene Hackman).
   The cast is terrific, and ``Another Woman'' is affecting, despite
Allen's tiresome focus on the neuroses of educated, white
Manhattanites. The scenes and the clothing are in brown, beige and
olive tones. And the movie is quiet, subdued and proper.

   ``Picasso Trigger'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $79.95. Rated R)
   
   A movie that combines ``Charlie's Angels'' and James Bond can't
be all bad, but it can't be all good, either. ``Picasso Trigger''
features about a half dozen angels and hunks with bare chests, some
sex and lots of mayhem done with all sorts of neat goodies including
a rocket-launching crutch.
   It has a thin plot involving a drug lord's revenge against a
bunch of federal agents _ the angels and hunks _ who wipe-out the
gang.
   Actually, the plot is no thinner than that of the late TV show or
some of the Bond movies. However, the script by Andy Sidaris, who
also directed, is so bad that not even fast-paced action, pretty
scenery and clever electronics such as exploding toy cars and planes
can not make up for it.
   There is a cute but obvious twist at the end, which if the viewer
is paying attention to the story rather than the bodies, can be
predicted very early.
   In case you miss it because of the scenery, here's a brief
rundown.
   The film gets its name from a painting of a fish done in the
style of the famous artist. It's presented at a party given by a
drug rackets kingpin.
   But just after the presentation the kingpin is rubbed out ... or
was he? Not to worry, he gets his again when the rocket launched
from a crutch homes in on his pacemaker and KABOOM!
   The movie stars Donna Speir, Hope Marie Carlton, Steve Bond and
Harold Diamond. Yeah, right, you really know these actors. But
readers of Playboy magazine might have seen Speir and Carlton.
