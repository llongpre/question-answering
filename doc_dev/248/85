   Actor Sean Connery pulled a James
Bond stunt and drove at high speeds along a scenic highway, but
police nabbed him. He admitted guilt and paid a fine, authorities
said.
   ``007 did it. But unlike Zsa Zsa, he didn't fight with police,''
said Bob Calvert, Santa Barbara County chief trial deputy,
referring to Miss Gabor's conviction for slapping a Beverly Hills
policeman who stopped her Rolls-Royce.
   Connery, through his attorney, on Thursday paid a $190 speeding
ticket for going 82 mph in a 55 mph zone. He was driving a rented
1989 Thunderbird when he was caught along the two-lane Highway 154
near the Southern California town of Solvang last Dec. 23.
   A California Highway patrolman ticketed him for speeding and for
driving without a license.
   The latter charge was dismissed after Connery's attorney showed
the star had a British driver's license.
   ``Too bad he wasn't in an Austin Healy and got away with an oil
slick or smoke screen,'' Calvert said. ``All the secretaries in the
office were going crazy. They wanted me to make sure that he
appeared in court. I would've lost a whole day's work if he did.''
   Connery, the first of four actors to play Bond, starred in
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' one of the top grossing
movies of 1989 with $196 million. His newest film, ``The Hunt for
Red October'' opens next month.
