<LEADPARA>  'THE Bonfire of the Vanities" had barely been released before the controversy
began raging between those who, having devoured Tom Wolfe's brilliant best
seller, found the movie a vulgarization of the original and those who, not
having read the book, liked the film just fine.;    It's a controversy as old
as movies themselves -- one that dates back to the time of silent films. It
reached its zenith in 1939 with the phenomenally successful film of "Gone With
the Wind." Back then Margaret Mitchell, who wrote the book on which the epic
was based, acknowledged that the movie did do justice to her novel.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But the argument is revived every time a screen version of a literary work
appears: Can a movie be judged on its own merits if it is a screen re-creation
of a beloved book? Is something lost when a 600-page novel is boiled down to a
120-page script?;    This holiday season, the furor was rekindled as two
high-profile books opened at the local cinema -- Wolfe's "Bonfire" and John le
Carre's end-of-the-Cold-War novel "The Russia House.";    In 1983 one of
Wolfe's previous novels, "The Right Stuff," was made into a movie by Philip
Kaufman. But few went to see it. Now director Brian DePalma and Warner Bros.
have taken on the task of re-creating Wolfe's "Bonfire" -- New York in the
grip of '80s greed.;    In an attempt to make the biting social satire more
accessible to the kind of movie audience "Bonfire" will need to recoup its
multimillion-dollar cost, DePalma has used his artistic license to the
fullest.;    First, he made sleazy journalist Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis) as
prominent a character as "Master of the Universe" Sherman McCoy, played by Tom
Hanks.;    Then, in another departure from the book, Fallow, who is English on
the printed page, is American on the silver screen.;    DePalma also turned
Judge White -- who is Jewish in the book -- into a black man. And he
transformed the grandstanding Rev. Bacon from a calculating canny politician
into a cross between Louis Farrakhan and televangelist the Rev. Ike.;    By
making these changes and others, DePalma seems to have pushed the subtle
mocking irony of the book into farce in the film.;    DePalma is defensive
about criticism that he missed the essence of the novel.;    At a Hollywood
hotel recently, where he was promoting the film, DePalma said: "It's very much
what's in Wolfe's novel . . . a racial incident brings about this story which
everybody turns into something from which they can profit in their own
particular career. (It) could happen in Chicago or Boston or L.A. It's just
that New York really intensifies everything.";    Much of the criticism of the
film revolves around the casting of Hanks as stockbroker McCoy. This
practically guaranteed that the material would be played as high comedy rather
than as sophisticated satire, which many people expected.;    'Bonfire' as
satire defended;  "A lot of people expected William Hurt," DePalma says. "But
I see the movie as a comedic satire, so I was constantly looking for actors
who could play comedy.;    "You're always going to have people who say, 'Well,
it's not the book.' Stanley Kubrick went through that with 'Lolita.' He got
the worst reviews I've ever read. He still made a great movie.";    Wolfe
himself is yet to be heard from.;    But there is another best-selling author
who is downright ecstatic over what moviemakers have done with his novel. Le
Carre, the pen name of British author David Cornwell, is so pleased with the
screen version of "The Russia House" that he has been promoting the film with
screenwriter Tom Stoppard, director Fred Schepisi and actor Sean Connery.;   
"I'm a happy man," says le Carre, the chain-smoking master of the spy genre.
"I love the movie. I think it's beautifully written, beautifully acted and I
think 20 years from now it will have a very worthy place in the archives of
decent films.";    There was no attempt to popularize the story, says le
Carre, or to play down to the cinema audience.;    "The threat of vulgarity
never loomed. The studio didn't ask for sex scenes and car chases. It had a
curiously smooth transition from book to film.";    So smooth, in fact, that
MGM-Pathe, the film's distributor, is worried the film may be too
sophisticated for some moviegoers; some may have to struggle to follow its
espionage plot.;    Not wanting to leave anything to chance, the studio
recently changed its ad campaign for the movie: It's now being pushed as a
love story rather than a spy tale. Le Carre says he has no such worry:;    "I
am convinced that people are much brighter than they are given credit for. I
think it's the industry's problem that generally they deliver crap.";    Le
Carre duds, too;  Le Carre is the first to admit film versions of his many
novels have often been less than successful. "The Spy Who Came in from the
Cold" (1965), co-starring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom, was a gem, but "The
Looking Glass War" (1970) was, according to le Carre, "a mess.";    "The
Little Drummer Girl" (1984), starring Diane Keaton, was "disappointing" and
another early film, "The Deadly Affair" (1967), directed by Sidney Lumet, was
"strictly a star vehicle for James Mason and Simone Signoret.";    "Often the
lousiest novels make the best movies. We all know that. In the '60s and '70s
they were making movies out of songs. You wrote the plot on a postcard and got
on with it.;    "Now I think the taste for story and structure has become
stronger as our lives become more chaotic. It's like making order out of
chaos.";    Australian director Schepisi ("A Cry in the Dark," 1988, and
"Roxanne," 1987) kept le Carre involved every step of the way in the transfer
of "The Russia House" from page to screen.;    No time for popcorn;  " 'Russia
House' is an old-fashioned film in the romantic sense," Schepisi says. "You
have to work at it, think about it, pay attention to it. You definitely can't
nip out and get popcorn in the middle of it.";    But Schepisi also is quick
to emphasize the love affair rather than the more taxing espionage elements of
the story.;    "I don't want people to think they are going to see a
conventional spy thriller. It's an anti-spy film, more Agatha Christie than
James Bond. And really, the film's main thrust is what two individuals can do;
(that) individuals can change the way we perceive the world.";    Le Carre --
whose most successful transitions from page to screen have been on television
with the BBC-made series "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" and "Smiley's People"
-- wrote "The Russia House" to light another fire under the then-thawing Cold
War.;    But le Carre knows the plot lacks the more conventional elements of a
hit movie.;    "Six studios wouldn't have anything to do with it," le Carre
recalls. "There was no 'baddie' in it, no physical action. Until Sean and
Michelle Pfeiffer came on board, it was 50-50 whether we would get anybody to
make it."  </TEXT>
