   Amid all the hoopla over Mick Dundee, John
Rambo, Willow Ufgood and other heroes of the new film season, the
infamous Jason might be overlooked.
   Not by Paramount Pictures.
   ```Friday the 13th' is a gold mine that keeps on rolling
along,'' declares Sidney Ganis, president of worldwide marketing
for Paramount. The studio reports that the first six films in the
series have grossed over $172 million, not to mention the big
videocassette sales, cable TV, syndication and a TV series.
   In its first 18 days, ``Friday the 13th Part VII _ The New
Blood'' sold almost $16 million worth of tickets in the United
States and Canada. Since the film cost $3.5 million _ about 1/18th
the budget of ``Rambo III'' _ it should already be solidly in the
black.
   ``Part VII'' profited by premiering on Friday the 13th of May;
the series always does better business when released on that
fateful day.
   ``Jason has become part of the vernacular,'' Ganis said. ``Why?
I think because he is genuinely frightening, and teen-agers
genuinely love to be frightened. My own daughter loved `Friday the
13th III.' Now she has seen `VII' and then she goes to see (the
more arty) `The Moderns.' A whole generation has grown up on Jason
and keeps going back.''
   Jason began his rampageous career quite modestly in 1980, in a
low-budget thriller created by producer-director Sean Cunningham.
Ironically, Cunningham devised the title when he was planning a
children's television show. He figured it might work for the title
of a feature film, and he was right. ``Friday the 13th'' grossed an
amazing $40 million.
   Cunningham, who is now filming another horror film, ``Deep
Six,'' signed over his rights to Paramount, and the series has had
five other directors. The formula remains the same as in the
original, which starred Kevin Bacon, later of ``Footloose'' fame,
Harry Crosby, son of Bing, and Betsy Palmer as Jason's mother.
   The action _ lots of it _ always takes place at Camp Crystal
Lake. Jason returns from the dead, wearing a hockey mask and
wielding an ax to pay back a grudge. Many years ago when he was a
camper he drowned in the lake because his inattentive counselors
were making love in the bushes. Jason's vengeance is wreaked upon
the human race in general, with special emphasis on oversexed
counselors.
   John Carl Buechler, a special effects expert who became a
director (``Troll,'' ``Cellar Dweller''), directed ``Friday the
13th VII'' from a script by Daryl Haney. Buechler (pronounced
Beekler) says he saw possibilities of applying two new twists to
the same saga.
   ``One, I thought it would be good to have a main character in
the story, someone the audience could cry and cheer for, and follow
her through the nightmare world,'' he said. ``She is the teen-ager
(Lar Park Lincoln) whose special powers release Jason from his
grave at the bottom of the lake. Telling the story from one
person's viewpoint had only been done once before (in Part V).
   ``Two, I added a substantial element of the supernatural. Before
Part VII, Jason was a mindless man who jumped out of closets and
killed people. Since he was resurrected by electricity in Part VI,
he was now, practically speaking, a ghost. That made him a
virtually unstoppable humanoid.
   ``So I thought it would be fun to fill the last two reels with
false endings. I wanted the audience to say, `Oh, he's up, now he's
down, he's dead. No, he's up again!' My aim was more fantasy than
reality.''
   Even with the innovations, Buechler was careful not to tamper
too much with the ``Friday the 13th'' formula.
   ``I was hired to satisfy the producers; if I was hired to do a
James Bond picture, I would certainly follow the Bond formula,'' he
said.
   ``Friday the 13th VII'' inevitably found disfavor with the
ratings board of the Motion Picture Association of America, which
immediately branded the film with an X for extreme gore. This would
have made the movie unsalable since a film rated X prevents anyone
under age 17 from being admitted to the theater.
   Like Jason, though, the filmmakers kept coming back again and
again with new cuts.
   ``They gave us an X six times until we finally got an R,''
Buechler said. ``I understand `Robocop' holds the record at eight.''
   Stunt man Kane Hodder is the seventh portrayer of Jason, which
might seem a thankless acting job since he doesn't speak and is
hidden behind a mask. Hodder doesn't agree.
   ``I've always wanted to play that character ever since the first
film,'' says Hodder, who has coordinated stunts for ``House,''
``Ghost Town'' and other thrillers. ``I've always believed that he
should be played by a stunt man.
   ``I think Jason is more of a challenge because he has no
dialogue. I tried to get across the feeling of menace just by using
certain head movements and body movements.''
   If the ``Friday the 13th'' films are stiumlating to teen-agers,
they are an ordeal for reviewers, whose vituperation has no
apparent effect on the audience.
   ``Critics hate the movies,'' Buechler said, ``but surprisingly,
we've had mixed reviews on VII. The common pattern is for the
reviewer to comment that Jason is here to stay, then to review the
previous one in the series and conclude, `If you liked them, you'll
like this one.'''
