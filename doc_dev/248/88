   When some actors tire of filmmaking, they take a
break. Not Michael Caine _ he turns to television movies instead.
   ``This'll save people saying, `Oh, he made another movie,''' the
56-year-old actor said as he joked about his prolific celluloid
output.
   He was talking on a break in filming ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,''
the latest film version of Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 horror
classic. Others have starred John Barrymore (1921), Frederic March
(1931) and Spencer Tracy (1941).
   It is Caine's second Victorian-era TV melodrama in two years.
``Jack the Ripper'' was aired last October.
   The two-hour, $6.3 million ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,''
co-starring Cheryl Ladd and written and directed by David Wickes, is
to be shown early next year on ABC in the United States, and around
Christmas in Britain on the Independent Television Network.
   ``The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' as the novel was
titled, tells of kindly Dr. Jekyll who experiments with chemical
changes in his body, believing he can distill the good in himself
from the evil. The evil persona, whom he names Mr. Hyde, gradually
takes over and commits murder. The book ends with Jekyll's suicide.
   Caine sees the story as ``one man fighting a battle against
himself.''
   ``He's always fighting the evil within him,'' he said in an
interview. ``When he's Jekyll, he's never evil, and when he's evil
he's a monster; he turns into this thing. Once I've got (Hyde's)
mask on, I'm not Mr. Sympathy, believe me.''
   The producers won't reveal what Hyde looks like but promise he'll
be terrifying. They use modern makeup techniques _ devices and
effects unknown to Barrymore when he played the role in a silent
movie 68 years ago.
   Ladd plays Sara Crawford, sister of Jekyll's dead wife, who falls
for Jekyll and discovers too late the Hyde that lurks beneath.
Crawford is Wickes' invention, one of several departures from the
original story, which the director said needed shaking up.
   ``The book is told second-hand by this lawyer as a retelling of
what happened some years back,'' said Wickes. ``Also, there's no
female interest at all. I invented Cheryl's character as my ideal
girl, that is to say tough and feminine all at once.''
   Ladd, best known as one of TV's ``Charlie's Angels,'' said she
was drawn to the project by the prospect of working with her Academy
Award-winning co-star.
   ``Michael is just sensational,'' she said, keeping an eye on her
14-year-old daughter, Jordan, who appears in the restaurant scene as
an extra. ``He makes me laugh all the time; he's very funny.''
   Caine said the movie gives him a part he could never get to do on
the big screen: ``I thought, `When else am I going to get a chance
to play Jekyll and Hyde? They're not going to do it in movies
again.'''
   The story has been filmed often. March won an Oscar for his
version a decade after Barrymore's. It was remade 10 years later
with Tracy and Ingrid Bergman, a movie now shown on television with
washed-out tints in a colorized version.
   Caine said he likes the priorities of TV filming: ``The great
thing is they concentrate on the actor. It's your performance
they're shooting, and you don't have to wait for the cavalry to come
over the hill for an hour before they shoot your close-up.
   ``I like that because I'm lazy, and I only work well under
pressure.''
   However, he's not forsaking the large screen. He has just
finished ``Shock to the System,'' which he describes as a ``comic
nightmare.'' Swoozie Kurtz and Elizabeth McGovern co-star under Jan
Egleson's direction. Next he's in ``Bull's-eye'' opposite fellow
Briton Roger Moore of James Bond fame.
   Born Maurice Micklewhite, Caine shot to fame in 1966 as the
Cockney philanderer in ``Alfie.'' A master of character acting, he
has won acclaim as the drunken professor in ``Educating Rita,'' as
the unfaithful husband in ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' which won him
an Academy Award, and most recently as a con artist in ``Dirty
Rotten Scoundrels.''
   He recently signed to write his autobiography for Random House,
and thinks director Wickes may already have provided a title.
   ``Instead of saying `cut, print,' he always says, `Been there,
done that,''' said Caine. ``That might be a good title.''
