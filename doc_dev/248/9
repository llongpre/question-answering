   Welsh actor Timothy Dalton, who
earned agent 007's license to kill in the James Bond film ``The
Living Daylights,'' has had his license renewed for the next Bond
movie, ``License Revoked.''
   Dalton, trained as a Shakespearean actor, performed many of his
own stunts in ``The Living Daylights,'' in which Bond battles a
nefarious international arms smuggler while courting femme fatale
Maryam D'Abo.
   Dalton's performance proved he was the right man to pick up the
keys to the Aston Martin and carry on in the tradition of Sean
Connery and Roger Moore, who starred in previous Bond thrillers,
said Amy Kimmelman, a United Artists spokeswoman.
   Filming for ``License Revoked'' will begin in mid-July in Mexico
City, with other locations to be selected later, Ms. Kimmelman said.
