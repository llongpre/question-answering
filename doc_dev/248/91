   Purveyors of American pop culture face a dilemma
with the easing of East-West tension: If the Russians no longer
qualify as bad guys, who does?
   Who will James Bond outwit? Who will G.I. Joe pulverize? Who
will Rambo vanquish singlehandedly?
   Where have all the villains gone?
   ``Where we're going to go witch-hunting next, I don't know,''
said Brian Walker, who has seen a host of bad guys vaporized or
sent to the fourth dimension in his 10-year tenure as exhibit
director of the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook, N.Y.
   Some suggest the new wicked ones in spy movies, comic books and
Saturday morning cartoons will be polluters; others see the
Japanese and Germans making a comeback as the baddies.
   The search for the new bad guy has its troubling side for Petra
Hesse, a college professor and a member of the Cambridge-based
Center for Psychological Studies in the Nuclear Age.
   She recently created a 13-minute video program on how children
may be affected by the images of ``the enemy'' in action cartoon
shows.
   ``The World is a Dangerous Place: Images of the Enemy on
Children's Television'' uses clips from ``Rambo,'' and ``G.I.
Joe,'' among other progreams to demonstrate how the enemy is
usually a swarthy foreigner _ or faceless monster _ who speaks with
an accent, respects no laws and is evil for the sake of being evil.
   ``At some level, yes, we do need bad guys. But I feel it's very
up in the air what that bad could be,'' she said. ``I don't mind
bad guys, but why can't we diversify?''
   Larry Hama, a former Marvel Comics editor who as an artist draws
G.I. Joe and as an actor frequently plays the bad guy, recognizes
the importance of an effective enemy. ``What is King David without
the Philistines?'' he asked.
   Villains can be more interesting than heroes, too.
   ``Look at `Batman,''' Walker said. ``The Joker was certainly not
the hero but he was definitely the star of the movie.''
   Moreover, a child needs to see his fantasies and fears come to
life, Hama said. There's that kid who ``comes over and steals his
peanut butter sandwich and stomps his face in the ground. At an
early age, you know evil exists and you want some sort of justice
done.''
   During the silent movie era, ``everyone knew bankers were evil
people. They took people's houses; they tied women to the railroad
track,'' Hama said.
   During World War II, Germans and the Japanese were the enemy.
   Nazis, especially, have served as great bad guys for 50 years,
Hama noted. From ``Casablanca'' to the Indiana Jones movies, Nazi
wore black uniforms and menacing expressions and could be counted
on to hiss, ``We have ways of making you talk.''
   ``Russian made bad bad guys,'' Hama insisted. ``They're shoddy,
they're not as cool; there's no monocle and dueling scar from
Heidelberg.''
   Hesse wonders if the Japanese and Germans could again become the
new supervillains, this time armed with microchips and driving
economy cars.
   What the world needs, Walker and Hesse said, is not necessarily
fewer villains, but more complex ones.
   Hesse contends that 4- to 5-year-olds see the world in
black-and-white terms, while 7- to 9-year-olds can grasp the
concept of a bad guy with some redeeming qualities, or an enemy
that comes from within ourselves.
   Perhaps the real bad guys to today's kids are polluters, Hesse
and Walker said. Walker envisions an action cartoon based on a
group of environmental activists, fighting oil spills and other
such threats to the Earth.
   Maybe it's hard to imagine James Bond foiling a polluter in the
same exciting style as a hand-to-high-heel combat with a blonde KGB
agent whose name is a sexual pun, but, as Walker put it:
   ``Kids are saying the enemy is not the Russians nor people in
other countries but more the greedy people raping the environment
for their own profit.''
