<TEXT>  Friday night at 8, Ch. 54; ROY Marsden says he's never going to play detective
Adam Dalgliesh again, which is as good an argument as any for making sure we
see his sixth, and perhaps last, appearance in the role this week in the
season premiere of PBS's "Mystery!" series, a six-part adaptation of P.D.
James' "Devices and Desires.";   Afraid of being typecast, Marsden now wants
to play villains and maybe even a little comedy after spending most of his
career playing cynical, dour types like Neil Burnside in "The Sandbaggers" and
Dalgliesh.;   But, of course, Sean Connery said he never would play James Bond
again after 1971's "Diamonds Are Forever," then came back 12 years later to do
the appropriately titled "Never Say Never Again." And Peter Falk said he was
through with Colombo a decade ago, but hasn't he been putting on the rumpled
overcoat quite a bit lately?;   My point is that you can't trust actors,
especially if they're best known for playing popular characters the public
always wants to see "just one more time." I don't think we've seen the last of
Marsden as Dalgliesh, even if he says so and even if his good friend, author
James, agrees that this may be the right time for the commander to end his TV
career.;   After all, James is believed to be writing another Dalgliesh novel
already -- and who else would the public accept in the role? Roger Moore?;  
Anyway, if "Devices and Desires" is really the last for Marsden, he's
definitely making a classy exit, solving one of his toughest cases and walking
away with a most interesting female companion as his special bonus. (Who that
is will be your bonus for going all the way through Chapter 6.);   Commander
Dalgliesh really deserves a bonus, too, because he takes on this mystery while
trying to enjoy a seaside holiday, far from his tiring duties with the London
Metropolitan Police. It begins when he learns he has inherited a rustic old
windmill on the North Suffolk coast, which has been converted into a comfy
residence that's the envy of many residents in the area. It's already his
favorite vacation retreat; so he's happy to spend time there, relaxing and
packing up items from the estate.;   What Dalgliesh doesn't know, however, is
that the area is currently falling under two ominous shadows: the rampage of a
serial murderer known as "The Whistler" and a bitter battle over the destiny
of the nuclear power plant located near the seaside community of Larksoken.;  
In this week's chilling opening chapter, Dalgliesh is reluctantly drawn into
the hunt for "The Whistler" by the local constable (Tony Haygarth).
Ultimately, he learns the killings and the controversy over the power plant
are mysteriously related.;   The killings in "Devices and Desires" are
stylishly frightening without becoming gory. The murderer usually strikes in a
lonely stretch of woods where you can almost feel the chilly fog drifting
through the trees. When a victim looks into the killer's face, there's nothing
there but a bright glowing light.;   There are plenty of intriguing suspects,
including a local drunk who abuses his kids, the nuclear protesters who live
in a trailer in the woods, the power brokers who want to buy up all the land
around the plant and whoever is sending a computer "virus" on the prowl
through the atom plant's defense system.;   And there are those intriguing
women for Dalgliesh to check out: lonely Meg Dennison (Susannah York) and her
friend Alice (Gemma Jones), who lives with her brother, the crafty
administrator of the nuclear plant.;   But the central appeal is, as usual,
the unique matching of actor and character in the Marsden/Dalgliesh TV films.
The stolid but shrewd Dalgliesh is played perfectly by the tall, thin, laconic
Marsden, who has taken over the character as firmly as Basil Rathbone took
over Sherlock Holmes.;   At age 50, Marsden has become something of a sex
symbol to devoted female fans of the series. They should be extra happy this
time, because Marsden gets to loosen Dalgliesh up quite a bit and get him out
of those three-piece suits. He even smiles rather flirtatiously now and then.;
  This Dalgliesh outing is also one of the most unusual and elaborate of the
series, filmed on location at the real Sizewell Power Station in Suffolk and
in the real coastal villages of North Suffolk. It's uncommonly good; so if
you've never seen Marsden do Dalgliesh, this is the time to watch, before it's
too late.  </TEXT>
