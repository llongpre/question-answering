"Pictures of the Old World"(Czechoslovakia; Director: Dusan Hanak; Cineplex 
Odeon Fairfax, 11:30 p.m.). Hanak's documentary of peasant life in the Slovak 
region -- banned for 17 years by the old regime -- has some of the limpid, 
overpowering beauty James Agee and Walker Evans achieved in "Let Us Now Praise 
Famous Men." The images are monochrome, dappled with light and shadow, the 
faces old and weathered. The tales, simple and sturdy, tell of hard lives and 
quiet endurance. A great, sad, wonderful film, one to be seen and cherished.

"Landscape in the Mist"(Greece; Director: Theo Angelopoulos; Cineplex Odeon 
Century Plaza, 9:30 p.m.). Seemingly the simplest of Angelopoulos' stories: Two 
runaway children journey over highways and railroads through a dreamy, desolate 
Greece in search of their mythological father. All the director's work echoes 
through it; even the Traveling Players reappear. This film, winner of the top 
prize at the 1989 European Film Awards, is a modern masterpiece; no movie lover 
should miss it. (Critic's Choice, with The Times' Michael Wilmington.)

"The Beekeeper"(Greece; Director: Theo Angelopoulos; Century Plaza, 11:15 
p.m.). Like all Angelopoulos' work, this contemporary road movie is hauntingly 
sad, mysteriously beautiful.

"Monday Morning"(Bulgaria; Directors: Irina Aktasheva, Hristo Piskov; Fairfax, 
7 p.m.). Another long-banned film, this comic drama about a shipyard crew 
chief's romance with a delinquent girl has the vibrancy and spirit of the 
better '60s Italian and British comedies. 
</P>
<P>
"Def by Temptation"(U.S.; Director: James Bond III; Century Plaza, 7 p.m.). Two 
veterans of Spike Lee's "School Daze" -- cinematographer Ernest Dickerson and 
actor and now writer-director Bond -- whip up a potent little horror-fantasy 
about a rapacious vampire and a young man of the Lord. Probably the best movie 
ever released by the defiantly sleazy Troma Inc.

<P>
"The Long Way Home"(U.S.; Director: Michael Apted; Goodson, 7 p.m.). A 
priceless subject revealed with dispassionate skill: East meets West with the 
Leningrad rock band Aquarium. MICHAEL WILMINGTON
