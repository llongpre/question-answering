The long-shelved "Brenda Starr," based on the plucky reporter/comic book 
character, briefly came off the shelf Friday -- for a "world premiere" showing 
in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The screening marked the Florida Film Festival's salute to filmmaker Robert 
Ellis Miller ("The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter," "Reuben, Reuben"), who requested 
that "Brenda Starr" be screened.

<P>
"I wanted to finally get her out of jail," Miller tells us. "It's always 
misunderstood when a picture doesn't come out. 'Brenda' deserves her day." 
</P>

Starring Brooke Shields as Starr and a pre-James Bond Timothy Dalton as her 
mysterious rescuer, Basil St. John, the $16-million "Brenda Starr" was filmed 
in late 1986, with an early 1988 release planned. Then it got ensnared in legal 
entanglements involving video rights. Things were further complicated when New 
World, which had distribution rights, was sold and phased out its domestic 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Now, reports Miller, the British consortium that financed the film is acquiring 
it from New World "and there are currently negotiations for a major release -- 
at last." Pat H. Broeske
