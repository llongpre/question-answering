   Two letters and a postcard written by Anne Frank
and her sister, Margot, were sold to an anonymous bidder at an
auction Tuesday for $150,000.
   The young Jewish Holocaust victims mailed the notes along with
two photographs to American pen pals in 1940, a month before Nazi
Germany invaded the Netherlands, prompting the Franks to go into
hiding.
   The successful bidder said he represented ``a number of
institutions'' but would not specify further, said Will Bennett,
spokesman for Swann Galleries, the auction house. However, the
bidder did say he would announce on Wednesday the name of the
institution where the letters will be kept, Bennett said.
   Also on the auction block were pages from Thomas Edison's
notebooks, Marilyn Monroe's certificate of conversion to Judaism,
and a collection of Greta Garbo correspondence.
   Bidding for the Frank collection was over in five minutes. Swann
had predicted bidding would exceed $30,000 but could not estimate
how high it would go because nothing written by Anne Frank had ever
been auctioned.
   Among the bidders for the letters was actress Whoopi Goldberg,
one of hundreds who participated in the auction by telephone. About
250 people attended the sale in person.
   The correspondence between the two sisters and their pen pals in
Iowa was dated April 27 and April 29, 1940. It described the girls'
life at home and school in Amsterdam. Margot wrote that ``having a
frontier with Germany and being a small country we never feel safe.''
   A month after the letters were sent, Germany invaded the
Netherlands. The Franks went into hiding but were later discovered
and sent to concentration camps. Anne's diary, published in 1952,
carries a poignant account of their life in hiding.
   The Franks' pen-pals were sisters from Danville, Iowa: Juanita
Wagner, 11, who was Anne's age, and Betty Ann Wagner, 15, who was
Margot's age. The Wagner sisters wrote back, but never heard from
the Frank girls again.
   After the war, they wrote again, and Anne's father replied,
explaining that he was the only one in his family to survive the war.
   The Wagner sisters, now living in California, decided earlier
this year to sell the letters. ``We had been discussing what I was
going to do to retire. I've never really saved very much,'' said
Betty Ann Wagner, who was reached by telephone at her home in the
Los Angeles area.
   Miss Wagner also said she plans to donate part of the money from
the sale to Wayfarer Ministries, a non-profit organization she
founded nine years ago to ship books to missionaries.
   She and her sister hope to travel to Amsterdam to visit the house
where Anne hid with her family, Miss Wagner said. ``We'd worried
about her during the war but never dreamed that she was suffering.''
   Also sold at the auction were several Marilyn Monroe autographs,
including her certificate of conversion to Judaism, which took place
just prior to her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. The
certificate was bought by a private collector for $7,000, Bennett
said.
   A handwritten letter of condolence from Emily Dickinson to the
husband of a friend who died brought $8,000 from a dealer, he said.
   Seventy-six pages of handwritten notes by Thomas Edison brought
$32,000. Edison compiled the manuscript, which concerns his travels,
jobs and inventions, for use by his official biographers, Bennett
said.
   A collection of correspondence from Greta Garbo was bought by a
collector for $9,500, Bennett said.
