   From the days when inventor Thomas
Edison's light bulb first lit the nights of 1879, Americans have
been regarded as naturally inventive and creative.
   Much of that innovation derives from the work of scientists and
engineers at General Electric's Research and Development Center,
which traces its roots to the Edison Electrical Light Company formed
in 1878 to support the experiments of Thomas Edison.
   GE scientists brainstormed the magnetic resonance imager, which
uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of internal
organs without X-rays.
   Real diamonds were concocted in one of their laboratories, not
pulled from the depths of the earth.
   In 1979, GE was the first company to pass the 50,000th patent
mark.
   But GE's _ and America's _ technological lead is being threatened
by the Japanese who, up until now, have had a reputation as clever
copycats.
   Since the end of World War II, the Japanese have borrowed
American inventions, improved them and turned them into inexpensive
household staples. Color television sets, transistor radios and
videocassettee recorders were all original American ideas the
Japanese have capitalized on.
   All that is changing.
   The Japanese are no longer content to pick the brains of American
scientists and engineers for new technology, says Roland W. Schmitt,
president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy and former
vice president of corporate research and development at GE.
   The Japanese are trying to be innovators, Schmitt says.
   Their aggressive patenting efforts prove that. Japan now acquires
more patents worldwide than any other country.
   Schmitt says the United States still leads the way in developing
new technology. ``But Japan is now in a stage where they're starting
to do this,'' he said.
   Japanese business executives say it's only natural for their
companies to develop their own technology.
   ``Any company that hopes to continue making progress will require
innovation, be it through its own or transferred technology,'' said
Kazuya Hosaka, manager of Hitachi Ltd.'s patent office in Tokyo.
   Many in this country question whether the Japanese can be
pioneering.
   The Japanese acquire hundreds of patents each year, they're quick
at turning inventions into products and their students study science
and technology in an education system considered superior in those
areas.
   But they're strangled by a culture that frowns upon risk-taking
and prizes collective action over individual effort. Their
scientists and engineers aren't trained to be pioneering.
   Americans, meanwhile, are encouraged to be creative.
   ``We educate our scientists to be pioneers,'' Schmitt said.
   A recent study for the National Science Foundation showed that in
1987, three Japanese companies garnered the most U.S. patents:
Hitachi with 873, Canon with 850 and Toshiba with 830.
   GE, which until 1986 had held the No. 1 spot for 25 years, was
fourth with 782 patents.
   GE executives at the company's R&amp;D center, located in a sprawling
complex of buildings overlooking the Mohawk River, dispute the
results of the patent study done by Computer Horizons, a consulting
company. They argue GE would still rank as patent leader if the
study had included patents granted to RCA, which GE acquired in 1986.
   ``Whoever did the study obviously didn't know RCA was a
subsidiary of GE,'' said James C. Davis Jr., manager of patent and
legal operations at GE.
   Top GE officials, though, see the study as a warning.
   ``It doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned,'' said Walter Robb,
vice president of corporate research and development at GE. ``There
are still three Japanese companies in the top four.''
   Moreover, the Japanese are beating the United States is their
ability to rapidly commercialize inventions, such as the VCR.
   ``We get out of the starting block fast,'' Schmitt said. ``But we
lose it on the long stretch. We've lost the ability to do the long
haul.''
   America's best hope in its competition with Japan may be its
education system. The United States is far ahead of Japan in an area
vital to technological and scientific development: the encouragement
of creative thought.
   Yet serious problems exist in America's education system.
   ``We have fewer and fewer students with an interest in science
and technology,'' said Schmitt, a former chairman of the National
Science Board.
   He believes that for the United States to remain No. 1 in science
and technology it must, in some ways, imitate the Japanese.
   ``The Japanese understand that manufacturability and customer
preferences are integral parts of the innovation process, not
afterthoughts,'' Schmitt said. ``I see no reason why we Americans
can't renew our skills at the application of science and technology
while maintaining our strength as pioneers.''
