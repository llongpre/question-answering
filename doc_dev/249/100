   After 65 years, the production lines
at one of Henry Ford's oldest plants will grind to a halt this
month and the factory that once made radiators for the Model T will
close its doors for good.
   For the last 2{ years, Ford employees who didn't accept
transfers to Plymouth, Mich., have dealt with the grim reality that
their jobs would soon be gone.
   ``I have to relate it to a person who has cancer. You have that
hope that you're going to be cured and finally you realize that
there's no hope. It's all gone,'' said James Roti Roti, the
president of United Auto Workers Local 930.
   The radiator and heater-core plant, which employed nearly 1,500
in 1973, is scheduled to close Nov. 30 in this upstate community of
less than 3,000, about 150 miles north of New York City.
   Ford is switching to aluminum radiators and heater cores instead
of using copper and brass. They will be made in Michigan.
   The historic plant _ located on a Hudson River site handpicked
by Henry Ford during a 1916 camping trip _ will be gutted and sold
for between $5 million and $6 million, said John C. Hazlett, Ford's
plant area manager.
   A stone displayed at the plant with the initials of Ford and his
camping companions _ Thomas Edison, John Burroughs and Harvey
Firestone Sr. _ may be donated to a museum, Hazlett said.
   When Ford built the Green Island plant, one of nine hydropower
plants he erected by 1925, the automaker believed that building
factories in rural areas would allow farmers to work during winter
months at his plants.
   ``Manufacturing, instead of being concentrated in a few centers,
should be and can be widely distributed,'' Ford wrote.
   How the members of Local 930 wish Ford's statement had withstood
the test of time. But company officials determined that to convert
the Green Island plant, which had revenues totaling more than $67.9
million in 1987, into an aluminum radiator facility would not be
worth the cost.
   It would cost $3 million more annually to make the products in
New York than in Michigan, Hazlett said.
   Workers say perhaps the one blessing of their dismal situation
was that they had plenty of advance warning about the shutdown. The
time helped some plan for the future and gave others a chance to
work overtime and save money.
   It also gave them more time to hold false hopes that things
would turn around.
   First, union members fought to keep the plant open, even going
so far as to leaflet shareholders at a Detroit meeting in 1986.
   They hoped for a new Ford product, a new owner, an
employee-owned factory _ and then set their minds on protecting as
best they could those who would inevitably be jobless.
   By October, radiator assembly line equipment had been torn out
of the 287,000-square-foot plant _ much already carted away.
Employees still working on heater core lines not far from the
windows that look out on the Hudson River spoke wistfully as they
looked at the empty spaces where their friends once worked.
   ``How can you feel, you know? You can't really feel anything.
You just wait for it (the shutdown) to happen,'' said Dennis
Bourdeau, 46, a 22-year plant veteran who doesn't know what he'll
be doing for a living as of Dec. 1.
   ``Everybody was hoping until the last minute,'' said Bourdeau.
   Productivity never dropped, even after layoffs and the shutdown
were announced. There was no sabotage.
   Most of the workers, who average in age at 50, have about 20
years of service and earn between $14 and $17 an hour, just wanted
to make it to retirement, said Ray Vaillancourt, 45, who's worked
there 23 years.
   Vaillancourt opted not to take the transfer offer to Michigan
and planned to make his part-time job as a charter bus driver full
time.
   Workers aren't bitter, Vaillancourt said.
   The mood in the plant, said Bourdeau, is mostly just
disappointment.
   ``We have met our schedules and our quality has actually
improved year over year for the last four or five years,'' conceded
Hazlett, the plant area manager.
   When the shutdown was announced in 1985, the 425 workers weren't
covered by job-security provisions and compromises had to be sought.
   Transfers were offered to almost every employee, and 160 took
the jobs in Plymouth, Hazlett said. Job-training programs were
offered and an early retirement plan, which begins at age 50 even
if a worker gets laid off at a younger age, was also offered.
   Ford and the UAW had also worked out education and training
programs, ranging from high school equivalency schooling to truck
driving.
   The training programs took four to five years to get into place,
Hazlett said.
   ``You just can't do it in 60 days,'' said Hazlett, in a
reference to new federal legislation requiring 60 days' notice of
an impending layoff or shutdown.
   Don Sherman, a spokesman for Ford's climate control division in
Michigan, said the company has had a longstanding policy that
approximately two years' advance notice is given before a plant
closes, so the law does not affect the way Ford handles such
situations.
   ``Let's face it, we don't want to see the plant close,'' union
leader Roti Roti said. ``But if there has to be a plant closing,
this is the way to do it.''
