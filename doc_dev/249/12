   Norbert Rillieux and Jan Matzeliger helped
revolutionize American history with their inventions, but the two
men scarcely rate a footnote in the annals of Yankee ingenuity
simply because they were black.
   Historian Portia James is setting matters straight with an
ambitious new Smithsonian Institution exhibition that celebrates
the genius of America's unsung black inventors.
   The show, which opens Sunday, pays belated tribute to 40
inventors whose creations include a trouser-stretching device for
eliminating wrinkles, a machine for producing paper bags, a press
for baling cotton and a mechanical traffic signal patented in 1923.
   ``The exhibition says a lot about their urge to create, and how
important it was for blacks to feel they were part of the growth of
American technology,'' said Ms. James, the show's curator. ``It was
their assertion of black participation in the Yankee innovative
spirit.''
   The exhibition at the Smithsonian's Anacostia Museum of
Afro-American history and culture is titled ``The Real McCoy:
African American Invention and Innovation, 1619-1930.''
   The show's name is taken from an invention by mechanical
engineer Elijah McCoy _ a grease cup designed for lubricating rail
locomotives while they sped down the tracks. Admiring train
engineers nicknamed it ``the real McCoy.''
   On display are the two devices created by black inventors which
probably have had the greatest lasting impact on American society,
said Ms. James, a native of Detroit who is the Anacostia Museum's
resident historian.
   One of them, developed by the New Orleans inventor Rillieux in
1830, is a vacuum evaporation machine that made refined sugar
widely affordable. It later was used to produce such foods as
evaporated milk and cocoa powder.
   The other is Matzeliger's shoe-lasting machine, patented in 1883
by the inventor from Dutch Surinam. The machine radically changed
the American shoe industry by eliminating the need for costly
hand-stitching of soles to the soft leather uppers of shoes.
   The museum duly recognizes one of the few prominent black
inventors, George Washington Carver, with a sampling of the
products he derived from peanuts, soybeans and sweet potatoes in
his laboratory at Alabama's Tuskegee Institute.
   But it also highlights such unknowns as Lewis Latimer of Queens,
N.Y., the only black associate on Thomas Edison's laboratory team,
who patented a carbon light bulb filament. Another is Garrett
Morgan of Cleveland, who invented both the stop-go traffic signal
and an industrial ``safety hood'' or gas mask which he used to
rescue workers trapped by a tunnel explosion under Lake Erie.
   Ms. James notes that African slaves introduced the banjo to
American music, and that Boston clergyman Cotton Mather learned of
inoculation against smallpox from his North African slave Onesimus.
   The exhibition honors New York tailor Thomas Jennings, the first
black believed to have received a patent, for his dry cleaning
process in 1821. On display are three wood planes designed in the
1770s by Cesar Chelor, a freed slave from Wrentham, Mass., who is
believed to be the earliest black toolmaker in America.
   Ms. James said her research for the exhibition took three years
because of the scarcity of historical records.
   Material came from old newspapers and magazines published for
the black community and from an exhaustive record of pre-1900
patents awarded to black inventors that was compiled by Henry
Baker, an early black U.S. patent examiner, she said.
   Ms. James' research yielded the tale of Oscar J.E. Stuart, a
Mississippi planter who tried to obtain a patent in 1857 for a
labor-saving ``double cotton scraper'' invented by his slave, Ned.
   Stuart argued that ``the master is the owner of the fruits of
the labor of the slave both intellectual and manual,'' but the
federal government granted neither man a patent.
   Undaunted, Stuart began manufacturing Ned's creation and issued
advertising circulars containing this testimonial from a fellow
plantation owner:
   ``I am glad to know that your implement is the invention of a
Negro slave _ thus giving the lie to the Abolition cry that slavery
dwarfs the mind of the Negro. When did a free Negro ever invent
anything?''
   As for the ingenious slave, Ms. James says, ``Ned disappeared
from history, and nothing is known of what became of him.''
