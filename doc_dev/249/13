   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's been called the ``Wizard of Weston,'' a
professional inventor who doesn't believe in wasting his time on
products that won't sell. But one of the problems inventors have,
says Stanley Mason, is selling their ideas to the companies that
employ them. To help remedy that, he's teaching a course on
creativity to a group of graduate business students.

   Inventor Stanley Mason, who lays claim to
the world's first microwave cookware, the squeezable ketchup bottle
and the granola bar, among other things, says he's seen a lot of
million-dollar ideas get lost because of a lack of vision in
corporate America.
   Like the disposable diaper he designed and the company ignored.
   Mason, who's been called ``the Wizard of Weston,'' hopes to do
his part to remedy that shortsightedness with a course on
creativity he's teaching to graduate business students at the
University of Connecticut's Stamford campus.
   The white-haired, 67-year-old inventor has a laboratory in a
two-story barn where elaborate _ and secret _ experiments are in
progress. There are blackboards and long conference tables for
brainstorming sessions.
   Mason isn't trying to turn his students into Thomas Edisons, but
he does think he can impart some of his curiosity and ability to
think creatively, which he credits for the 30 patents he holds.
   ``In large companies, people are divided up into departments
that are so insular, they don't understand what goes on in the next
office,'' Mason said during a recent interview at Simco Inc., the
product development company he founded in 1973 after a corporate
career that included stints with Hunt Foods Inc., the Glenn L.
Martin Co., Armstrong Cork Co. Inc., American Can Co. and U.S.
Steel Corp.
   ``They don't understand the totality, the continuum, the
interaction between products and consumer. It's possible, with
patience, to teach people how to think in a creative way, how to
take a tentative point of view about everything, how not to be so
damn sure about everything.''
   Norman C. Parrish of Moraga, Calif., president of the National
Congress of Inventor Organizations, calls Mason ``one of the most
widely respected inventors'' in America.
   Mason's work, he says, is ``valuable enough that Johnson &amp;
Johnson and companies of that caliber give him essentially open
contracts to come up with new products for them.''
   Most people make the mistake of thinking that being an inventor
simply means dreaming up a great idea, Mason says, but the
successful inventor is someone who recognizes the market for a
product that doesn't yet exist, and figures out how to provide it.
   ``Edison's greatest invention was not the electric light or the
phonograph,'' he says. ``His greatest invention was the product
development laboratory.
   ``Edison was a real psychologist. He knew what could sell. He
didn't invent things that couldn't sell. He didn't waste his time.''
   Mason's 15-week course consists of a series of three-hour
seminars that include lectures by successful entrepreneurs and
exercises designed to stretch the students' minds.
   For one recent assignment, he sent students into a Norwalk store
and told them to pick out a product that they as consumers thought
needed improvement. They returned to the classroom, divided up into
three companies, and spent the rest of the night playing ideas off
each other.
   ``It sort of frees one's way of thinking,'' says David Chang, a
research chemist at Clairol Inc. who is working toward his master's
in business administration. ``It will be very, very helpful to
people in technical management.''
   Mason has experienced the frustrations of corporate life
firsthand.
   In the 1970s, when he developed Masonware, which he says was the
first cookware for microwaves, Mason was told by a major American
corporation there was no market for it. Today, such cookware is a
$350 million-a-year business, he says.
   When he developed the granola bar as an alternative snack
product for Nestle S A in the 1970s, the company decided it wasn't
interested. Quaker Oats Co. and others eventually came out with
their own.
   Then there was the disposable diaper debacle. Mason was
exasperated trying to put a square diaper on his son's round bottom
_ not to mention the drudgery of laundry and those painful pricks
from safety pins.
   So when he was working for a major paper-products company, he
designed a disposable diaper lined with soft, absorbent paper,
shaped like an hourglass to fit a baby's bottom, and substituted
sticky tape for pins.
   The company patented the invention and Mason got $100 for his
efforts. The company, which he didn't want to be identified, sold
the patent rights to another corporation, which also failed to act
on the idea.
   Since then, shaped disposable diapers have become a
billion-dollar product line.
   Such lack of vision helps explain why half the patents issued in
America last year went to inventors outside the country, Mason says.
   ``Product development is a risky business,'' he says. ``There's
no security in working in product development in any U.S. company
because if the product doesn't work, they kill the messenger.''
   According to one survey, the average tenure for research
directors at American corporations is only 13 or 14 months, Mason
says.
   ``I've worked for lots of companies _ I've been fired from lots
of companies,'' he says.
   Today, Simco's clients include 40 Fortune 500 companies, such as
Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kimberly-Clark Corp., Proctor &amp; Gamble Co.,
Hunt-Wesson Foods Inc. and Primerica Corp.
   It has a full-time staff of about eight employees, plus about
125 associates, mostly academics, who provide creative input on
various projects, such as Mason's latest venture: How to get
petroleum substitutes, including fuel, from Chinese tallow trees.
   That project has been funded in part by the National Science
Foundation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the state of
Hawaii.
   Among his other inventions: the first plastic underwire bra for
Playtex, a super-strong Velcro for Velcro Fastening Systems, a
burglar alarm that hangs on a doorknob and square milk jugs that
save shipping space.
   Mason dates his first invention to his youth, when he sold a
slingshot-like weapon to scores of friends. His inventive spirit
was nurtured by his father, an electrician who developed the first
electric chair for the state of New Jersey, Mason says.
   His first real job was as a teen-ager at the Trenton Free Public
Library, which also served as one of 12 regional depositories for
patents issued by the U.S. Patent Office. He'd spend hours poring
over other people's inventions, and realized that's what he wanted
to do with his life.
   ``Part of what I do is feed my unconscious and conscious brain
with lots of things,'' he says. ``It's furniture you move around in
your head and the more that you have there, the more connections
take place.''
