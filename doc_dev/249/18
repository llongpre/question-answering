   Babe Ruth's autograph sold for $600 and first
lady Barbara Bush's went for $350. But former President Carter's
autograph couldn't bring down the gavel, even at a bargain price of
$75.
   ``No bid,'' the auctioneer said Thursday night at a Herman
Darvick Autograph Auction.
   ``Very popular president,'' one observer said sarcastically as
some of the nearly 100 people who crowded into a Manhattan hotel
chuckled.
   Oliver North was far more popular. An autographed copy of the
former national security aide's high school yearbook sold for $450.
The yearbook shows North with a printed quote: ``I am not only witty
in myself but the cause that wit is in other men.''
   Another big seller was a Greta Garbo signature on an amended
movie contract signed March 4, 1939. The document sold for $3,850.
   ``She has the most valuable autograph of any living person,''
said Herman Darvick, whose firm specializes in celebrity signatures.
   A signed Thomas Edison patent went for $7,700 and a Benjamin
Franklin autograph was sold to a doctor from Pennsylvania for
$11,000.
   The Babe Ruth signature was splayed across a photograph of the
Bambino shaking hands with an unidentified man in a business suit.
Two campaign-related letters by Mrs. Bush, on her personal red,
white and blue stationery, were sold as one item.
   An autographed picture of President Ronald Reagan and then Vice
President Bush sold for $750. But an autographed picture of Carter
with President Gerald Ford, another slow seller, went for $140.
   ``It's hard to explain,'' Darvick said of Carter's dismal
signature value. ``He's just not selling anything, in books, checks
and letters.''
   Actually, an item billed as a ``Rare Jimmy Carter White House
Card'' which was projected to bring between $700 and $800, did sell
_ for $150. The card bore a vignette of the south portico of the
White House and was signed in facsimile by Carter.
   But mostly, the Carter autographs drew silence, like lot No. 98,
an autographed copy of Carter's book, ``Why Not The Best?''
   ``Do I hear $75?'' asked the auctioneer. ``If not, we'll pass.
... Pass on 98.''
   Former President Richard Nixon enjoyed considerably more
commercial appeal, with a letter to a reporter signed ``Dick''
selling for $500.
   Darvick said John F. Kennedy has the most sought after
presidential signature, followed by Reagan and Nixon.
   ``Kennedy became senator in 1953. Ten years later he was dead. He
had machines that signed his autograph. He's very rare in
authenticated material,'' Darvick said.
   Referring to Nixon's Watergate notoriety, Darvick said, ``It's
like going to a wax museum. People don't want to see the presidents.
They want to see the ax murderers.''
