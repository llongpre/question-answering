   Two women who were pen pals with Anne Frank and
her sister have sold the correspondence at auction for $150,000 and
plan to use the money to retire and to fund an organization for
Christian missionaries.
   The anonymous buyer, who also paid a 10 percent fee to the
auction house, will give the letters to the Simon Wiesenthal Center
in Los Angeles, according to The New York Times.
   The women had hoped the buyer would put the letters, which are in
English, in a setting where they can be viewed publicly.
   ``We enjoyed them for 48 years, and we're just hoping that maybe
the world will get to see them,'' said Betty Ann Wagner.
   Miss Wagner and her sister Juanita wrote to Anne and her sister,
Margot, in 1940 at the suggestion of a teacher in their
then-hometown of Danville, Iowa. At the time, Anne and Juanita were
11; Margot and Betty Ann were 15.
   Anne and Margot sent back two photographs, a postcard and two
letters describing their life in Amsterdam, Holland. Margot wrote
that ``having a frontier with Germany and being a small country we
never feel safe.''
   The Wagners wrote back, but never heard from the Franks again.
   A month after the letters were sent, Germany invaded the
Netherlands. The Franks, who were Jewish, went into hiding in the
attic of a house in Amsterdam but were later discovered and sent to
concentration camps. Anne's diary, published in 1952, carries a
poignant account of their life in hiding.
   ``We'd worried about her during the war, but never dreamed she
was suffering,'' said Miss Wagner, reached at her home in the Los
Angeles area.
   She added that she and her sister, who also lives in California,
hope to visit the house in Amsterdam where the Franks hid.
   After the war, the Wagners wrote to the Franks again. Anne's
father replied to say that he was the only one in his family to
survive the war.
   Rhonda Barad, director of the Wiesenthal center's eastern region,
said the letters would be exhibited at a new museum in Los Angeles
when it is completed next year.
   ``We wanted the letters,'' said Barad, whose organization is
named for the famed Nazi hunter. ``The focus of the center is to
teach tolerance and that's what Anne Frank's diary and her life
represent.''
   Miss Wagner said she plans to donate part of the money from the
sale to Wayfarer Ministries, a non-profit organization she founded
nine years ago to help Christian missionaries around the world.
   The auction house, Swann Galleries, had predicted that bidding
would exceed $30,000 but could not estimate how high it would go
because nothing written by Anne Frank had ever been auctioned before.
   Among the bidders was actress Whoopi Goldberg, one of hundreds
who participated in the auction by telephone.
   Also sold at the auction were several Marilyn Monroe autographs,
including her certificate of conversion to Judaism, which took place
just before her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. The
certificate was bought by a private collector for $7,000, said Will
Bennett, a Swann spokesman.
   A handwritten letter of condolence from Emily Dickinson to the
husband of a friend who died was on the auction block as well,
bringing $8,000 from a dealer.
   Seventy-six pages of handwritten notes by Thomas Edison brought
$32,000. Edison compiled the manuscript, which concerns his travels,
jobs and inventions, for use by his official biographers, Bennett
said.
   A collection of correspondence from Greta Garbo was bought by a
collector for $9,500, Bennett said.
