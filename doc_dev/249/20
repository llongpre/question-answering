   On May 19, 1536, Anne Boleyn, the second wife of England's King
Henry VIII, was beheaded after she was convicted of adultery. Anne

later became Queen Elizabeth I.
   On this date:
   In 1780, a mysterious darkness enveloped much of New England and

spoke into one of these things. Good night.''
   In 1935, T.E. Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia, died
in England after a motorcycle crash.
   In 1943, in an address to Congress, British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill pledged his country's full support in the U.S.
war with Japan.
   In 1958, the United States and Canada formally established the
North American Air Defense Command.
   In 1964, the State Department disclosed that 40 hidden
microphones had been found in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
   In 1967, the Soviet Union ratified a treaty with the United
States and Britain banning nuclear weapons from outer space.
   Ten years ago: Spectacular Bid captured the second jewel of the
Triple Crown by winning the Preakness Stakes. However, the
thoroughbred would go on to finish third in the Belmont Stakes.
   Five years ago: The Edmonton Oilers won their first Stanley Cup,
defeating the four-time defending champion New York Islanders in
five games.
   One year ago: One day after Vice President Bush said he wouldn't
bargain with terrorists or drug dealers, the White House said Bush,
a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, was free to
differ from Reagan administration policy.

   Thought for today: ``There could be no honor in a sure success,
but much might be wrested from a sure defeat.'' _ T.E. Lawrence,
