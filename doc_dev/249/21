   Today is Saturday, May 19, the 139th day of 1990. There are 226
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On May 19, 1536, Anne Boleyn, the second wife of England's King
Henry VIII, was beheaded after she was convicted of adultery. (Anne
had fallen from Henry's favor because their marriage did not result
in any male heirs; however, she did give birth to a daughter, who
later became Queen Elizabeth I.)
   On this date:
   In 1780, a mysterious darkness enveloped much of New England and
part of Canada in the early afternoon. The cause has never been
determined.

``Why, I don't know what to say. This is the first time I ever
spoke into one of these things. Good night.'')
   In 1935, T.E. Lawrence, better known as ``Lawrence of Arabia,''
died in England following a motorcycle crash.
   In 1943, in an address to the U.S. Congress, British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill pledged his country's full support in
the war against Japan.
   In 1958, the United States and Canada formally established the
North American Air Defense Command.
   In 1964, the State Department disclosed that 40 hidden
microphones had been found in the U.S. embassy in Moscow.
   In 1967, the Soviet Union ratified a treaty with the United
States and Britain banning nuclear weapons from outer space.
   Ten years ago: Angry homeowners at Love Canal in Niagara Falls,
   N.Y., detained two Environmental Protection Agency officials for
nearly five hours, demanding the federal government evacuate the
neighborhood because of toxic chemical contamination.
   Five years ago: Residents of the Philadelphia neighborhood
ravaged by fire in a police confrontation with the radical group
``MOVE'' gathered for Sunday services to seek solace.
   One year ago: The NCAA announced sanctions against the
University of Kentucky's basketball program for recruiting and
academic violations. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial

with its view of the world.'' -- Elizabeth Janeway, American author.
