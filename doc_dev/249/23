   Inventor Thomas Edison and 11 presidents
were among the 65 people honored this year by the University of Hard
Knocks, which issues diplomas to successful people who never earned
a college degree.
   The mock university _ founded 40 years ago by Jim Comstock,
editor of The West Virginia Hillbilly newspaper _ for the first time
issued posthumous degrees.
   Edison, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln were the top
honorees, said Wayne Fugate, a reporter for the Hillbilly and a
former graduate of the University of Hard Knocks.
   Those among the living who were honored came from as far away as
Jakarta to participate in Saturday's ceremony, Fugate said.
   Former Sen. Jennings Randolph, D-W.Va. _ the university's
``mascot'' and a former graduate _ presented diplomas to 45
honorees, including Arnaud de Borchgrave, editor-in-chief of The
Washington Times.
   The commencement was held at Alderson-Broaddus College, but as
Comstock _ a Marshall University graduate _ likes to say of his
college of hard-earned knowledge, ``The world is its campus.''

   Frank Nicholls says there's
something lacking in a pint of beer served in British Columbia bars
_ 4 ounces of beer.
   Nicholls, an electrician, says he's done his homework, sampling
pints in dozens of pubs in the province, and has concluded that most
of them don't give patrons a proper-sized Canadian pint.
   ``I could sue every pub in Vancouver _ right now,'' says
Nicholls, 38.
   Nicholls says most city pubs and clubs sell 16-ounce pints based
on the 128-ounce U.S. gallon. However, the federal Weights and
Measures Act uses the British Imperial gallon, which is 160 ounces.
Under federal law, it is illegal to call anything under 20 ounces a
pint.
   A government official agrees with Nicholls that calling a
16-ounce glass a pint is technically illegal.
   ``That's absolutely right,'' says Archie Patterson, Vancouver
district manager for Weights and Measures. ``The U.S. pint is not
legal.''
   But though most watering holes in the province could be charged
under federal law, Patterson says Ottawa has more important things
to worry about.
   ``We've not really been pushing in that area,'' he said.
