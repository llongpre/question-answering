   Napoleon Bonaparte and Thomas Edison were ``short'' sleepers.
   Albert Einstein was a ``long'' sleeper.
   Not everyone needs the same amount of sleep, says a University
of Rochester sleep disorders specialist _ and not everyone needs
eight hours of sleep a night.
   Yet, says Dr. Donald Greenblatt, ``the great majority of adults
sleep between seven and nine hours, and there is evidence that
people who fall within this range live longer than those who sleep
fewer, or more, hours.''
   Napoleon and Edison, Greenblatt says, needed only four to six
hours of sleep; Einstein often slept 14 to 16 hours.
   The sleepiest creatures on Earth, says the sleep doctor, are
sloths, bats and armadillos, which doze as much as 20 hours of the
day. Horses function well on five hours, and giraffes and elephants
sleep only four hours, he says.
   His advice for the most restful sleep:
   _ Keep a regular schedule, getting up and retiring at about the
same time each day.
   _ Exercise in the late afternoon; exercising too close to
bedtime may keep you awake.
   _ Sleep in a cool, quiet room.
   _ Don't take sedatives or alcohol before bed. Though they may
cause you to fall asleep sooner in the short run, they can cause
``rebound'' insomnia when their effect wears off.
   _ Sleep only until refreshed.
