   The rededication of a replica of the
world's first motion picture studio, where Thomas Edison produced
such films as ``The Great Train Robbery,'' has some movie buffs
hoping more films will be made there.
   Friday's ceremony at the recently renovated studio kicked off a
five-year fund-raising campaign.
   Supporters of the Edison National Historic Site want to raise at
least $5 million to help build an auditorium where students and
others could perform in films and to make the more than 400,000
artifacts at the site easily accessible to visitors.
   Special movie-making demonstrations are planned over the weekend
to mark the 100th anniversary today of Edison's filing legal
protection for his kinetograph, the forerunner of the modern-day
motion picture camera.
   Edison dubbed the studio ``Black Maria,'' an old slang term for
a black police paddy wagon, which it resembles. Besides the Black
Maria, the historic site is home to Edison's library, laboratory,
research and development complex and Victorian mansion.
   ``One of the great things about the site is that Edison's
inventions are here. They work. Visitors can participate and
touch,'' said Fahy Whitaker, who supervises the site's staff for
the National Park Service.
   At least 12,000 students a year, mainly from New Jersey, tour
the Edison site and learn about filmmaking, Ms. Whitaker said.
   ``Part of our plans are to have a movie made here. But we're not
sure what,'' Ms. Whitaker said.
   Edison, also famous for his work at a Menlo Park lab, is said to
have built the West Orange laboratory in 1887 to develop inventions
quickly and cheaply. There he also perfected the phonograph and the
alkaline battery.
   Friday's visitors watched as actress Ruth Warrick of ABC-TV's
``All My Children'' and other volunteers portrayed a scene from
``The Great Train Robbery'' inside the studio.
   The original black tar paper studio, a separate building next to
others that house Edison artifacts, was designed and constructed by
the inventor in 1893 at his West Orange laboratory. Edison tore
down the first studio in 1903; the reproduction was constructed 50
years later.
   Like the original, the replica has a roof that opens to provide
sunlight for filming.
   Money for the studio renovation was donated by the National Tour
Association, the largest group-travel organization in the United
States.
   ``What we wanted to do is take a site lesser known or lesser
used in the national park system and focus on it so people
understand that the national parks are more than Yellowstone,''
said Jim Host, the group's executive vice president.
