      Today's highlight in history:
   In 1805, the Battle of Trafalgar took place off the coast of
Spain. A British fleet commanded by Adm. Horatio Nelson defeated a
combined French and Spanish fleet, thwarting the plans of Napoleon

and William H. Rehnquist to the U.S. Supreme Court, following the
resignations of Justices Hugo L. Black and John M. Harlan.

Americans living there, and to provide a means of evacuation.
   A year ago: Sometimes acrimonious debate began in the U.S.Senate
on the nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork to the U.S. Supreme
Court. (Two days later, the Senate voted 58-42 to reject the
nomination.)
   Today's birthdays: Conductor Sir Georg Solti is 76. Jazz
musician Dizzy Gillespie is 71. Baseball hall-of-famer Whitey Ford
is 60. Rock singer Manfred Mann is 48. Actress Carrie Fisher is 32.
