<TEXT>     Press leaks about the "Edison Project" portray it as a joint venture
between Tennessee media baron Christopher Whittle and American industry to
create a "new American school" -- one that relies heavily on video and
computer technology for about the same cost of a traditional public school.
Whittle will formally unveil his plan today at a Washington, D.C., news
conference.;    Some educators speculate the only way Whittle can turn a
profit is by using the same tool that makes Channel One tick -- television --
to replace the costliest cog in education's machinery: the classroom teacher.;
   "The only way that he can make it is if he uses a lot of technology and
fewer teachers," said Stanford education professor Michael Kirst. "You'd have
distance-learning, where their teacher isn't even there.;    "He's off in
Nebraska somewhere, but teaching you via television.";    Not that Kirst
rejects the idea: "What's interesting to me is that no entrepreneur has ever
come into the education field and tried to used to massive amounts of
technology and machines.";     Critic answers;  But the idea of plug-in
teachers doesn't turn on Del Weber, president-elect of the California Teachers
Association.;    "All of the research indicates the most effective instruction
takes place with a smaller class size and human beings -- namely teachers --
who can give the youngster individual attention," he said. "Nothing takes the
place of another human being.";    Whittle hinted at his vision in a 1990
issue of his now-defunct Tennessee Illustrated magazine:;    "When Edison
invented electric illumination, he didn't tinker with candles to make them
burn better. Instead, he created something brilliantly new: the light bulb. In
the same fashion, American education needs a fundamental breakthrough, a new
dynamic that will light the way to a transformed educational system.";     $60
million in seed money;    According to press reports, Whittle plans to start
his breakthrough by investing $60 million over the next two years to hire 100
"innovators" from education, business, science and other fields to come up
with the school of the future. Then he'll spend about $2.5 billion to build
the first 200 schools.;    The money would come from all over: corporate
partners; by selling course materials to other schools; from peddling space in
textbooks to advertisers. There is also speculation that advertising space
would be sold in school hallways and -- just like Channel One -- during video
programs shown to students.;     Apple is hesitant;    The most logical
corporate sponsors would be electronics giants like IBM or Apple. But an Apple
spokeswoman questioned whether her firm would join an enterprise that could
threaten its existing inroads in public education.;    "Apple's approach has
always been to work in partnership with educators," said a spokeswoman who
asked for anonymity. "Over the years, we've been very supportive of
educational research and technology.;    "If Whittle decided they were going
to take on educational reform on their own, I'd have to say we'd hesitate to
be a part of that.";    Whittle compares his brainchild to the intensive
effort of the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb, or space
pioneering of the Mercury astronauts.;    But critical educators suspect a
more earthly motive: making a buck.;    Their fears focus on Whittle's
controversial Channel One, the TV news show that was launched in 1989 and now
reaches 8,700 schools in 47 states. Channel One provides schools with an
average of $50,000 in free video equipment, which can be used for anything the
school chooses. The only stipulation is that the school show Whittle's
10-minute new program in its entirety, including the two minutes of
commercials at the end for products such as Burger King and Nike.;    But
critics say that the show -- which has been banned by California schools chief
William Honig under threat of having a school's funds withheld for lost
instructional time -- turns students into "a captive market" for advertisers.
And they worry that Whittle's schools will do the same.;    "From what I've
heard about the 'Whittle Academies' is that they're going to be a brilliantly
conceived marketing vehicle," said William L. Rukeyser, special assistant to
Honig.;    "This is taxpayer subsidy to watch M&amp;M ads.";    But Whittle has
supporters at East San Jose's Overfelt High School, which has continued to run
Channel One -- risking the loss of $30,000 to $50,000 in state funding.;   
"Schools have to be aggressive in getting business involved in our schools,"
said Art Darin, associate principal of Overfelt. "We cannot continue without
business partnerships. There must be a dramatic change in the way our
educational system operates.";    Whittle's plan is being announced amid
growing dissatisfaction with the U.S. educational system. President Bush
recently called for intensified efforts to improve the nation's schools --
including letting parents choose where their children, and their tax dollars,
go to school -- and newly appointed Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander is
a longtime adviser to Whittle and an investor in the company.;    But
educators are concerned that such private school enterprise would "skim" the
best students, making the public schools a dumping ground for children with
academic, social and developmental difficulties.; WHITTLE'S PLAN FOR NEW
SCHOOLS; (box) Whittle wants to build 200 new schools for $2.5 billion using
no public money, though advertising would play a part in the venture.; (box)

career out of matching advertisers to narrow, well-defined audiences.;
