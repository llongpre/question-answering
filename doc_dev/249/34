Hang Up on Bell?</HL>

   Your account of how Western Union supposedly scorned Bell's telephone as a toy (second section, Dec. 15) repeats a long-running myth. 

   In researching the telephone's centennial for a 1976 article, I learned there is no hard evidence of an offer of the Bell patents to Western Union for $100,000. 
The only mention of it appears nearly 40 years afterward in a recollection by Bell's assistant, Thomas Watson. 
His story has been kept alive through wide circulation of a purported "report" to Western Union's president in which a committee charged with evaluating the invention calls it "hardly more than a toy" and scorns the idea of putting phones in every home and office as "idiotic on the face of it." 

   This report has enough flaws to suggest it was very likely fabricated, either as a joke or as a confused reminiscence. 

   The reality was quite different. 
Western Union's President Orton was an electrical expert so familiar with Bell's experiments that he was shrewd enough to put Edison on his payroll in 1875. 
A few months later he gave him a copy of a German report of a primitive "telephone" made in 1860. 
Edison missed beating Bell to the invention of a working phone by only a few months. 
However, he did invent a better transmitter that made Bell's invention practical for commercial use. 

   Thus, while Bell's invention could be considered a "toy" from a commercial standpoint, Western Union seems undeserving of the ridicule it has received.
