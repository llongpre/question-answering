<TEXT>     For decades, as head of Polaroid Corp., Land provided the ideas and impetus
for a long line of innovative photographic products.;    It was in response to
his 3-year-old daughter's bewilderment at why a camera could not instantly
produce pictures that Land conceived the idea of the instant camera in 1943.; 
  A mostly self-taught physicist, Land said he thought about her question, and
"within an hour, the camera, the film and the physical chemistry became so
clear to me.";    As Polaroid's longtime guiding light, he oversaw the
development of products that included the first Polaroid Land Camera of 1948
and a long succession of other devices in the field that he termed instant
photography.;    "Land inspired everyone he worked with," Polaroid President
I. MacAllister Booth said. "He taught us new science, new industry and a new
way of working.";    Under Land, Polaroid's products gained wide acceptance.
In the 1960s, a Polaroid marketing executive estimated that half the
households in the United States had Polaroid cameras.;    That pioneering by
Land, who held 533 patents by the time he retired in 1982, reflected what he
said was a basic trait in himself and other inventor-scientists.;    An urge
to contribute;  "As I review the nature of the creative drive in the inventive
scientists that have been around me, as well as in myself," he wrote, "I find
the first event is an urge to make a significant intellectual contribution
that can be tangibly embodied in a product or process.";    Over the decades,
Land lavished energy and creativity on the art of running a technologically
innovative company. He spurred inventiveness among his colleagues at Polaroid,
and he repeatedly led efforts to overcome urgent technical problems that
arose.;    Under his guidance, Polaroid, which has been based in Cambridge
since 1940, flourished after it began selling its instant-photography
products.;    The company ran into notable problems in the 1970s, including
some involving the technically elegant SX-70, an instant camera with complex
optics.;    In good times and bad, Land's life was tightly intertwined with
the life of the company and of a predecessor, Land-Wheelwright Laboratories,
which he co-founded in 1932. Besides being Polaroid's chairman, Land was its
president from 1937 to 1975. He stepped down as chairman in 1982.;    As a
freshman at Harvard in 1926, he launched his first experiments on ways to
polarize light -- a process that filters out diffuse light waves that cause
glare. Land soon left Harvard to pursue his research independently and start
Land-Wheelwright in Cambridge.;    Land's research launched two major
industries: instant photography and the use of plastic sheets for polarizing
light in items like sunglasses and digital readouts.;    His instant-picture
process entailed exposing the film and then developing the negative at the
same time that the print was made: Rollers squeezed the exposed film up
against the paper that would become the print.;    Instant development;  As
the rollers moved the negative and the paper along, they also broke open a
small sealed pod attached to the paper. The pod held developing chemicals that
the rollers spread between the negative and the paper.;    At first the system
yielded sepia images; in 1950 it was altered so that the pictures came out in
black and white. In 1959, a long-held ambition of Land's was fulfilled: He
announced that an instant color-photograph system had been devised at
Polaroid.; LANDMARKS; Edwin H. Land collected more than 500 patents in his
lifetime, second only to Thomas Edison. Among them:; (box)The first instant
camera, the Polaroid Land camera, in 1948, starting the era of 60-second
photography.; (box)Polaroid sunglasses.; (box)Polarized glass for windows.;
