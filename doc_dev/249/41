   We would create thousands more good inner city jobs tomorrow, if
the Democratic Congress would stop blocking Jack Kemp's enterprise
zones program.
   We discovered something in New Jersey _ every time we take an
unemployed person and give them a job, we take a Democrat and turn
him into a Republican!
   But good jobs will not matter if our children do not have the
skills to fill them.
   As a child, I had a terrible stutter. I also had dyslexia. I
overcame those problems, but I couldn't have done it alone. I went
to a good school. I had good teachers.
   Today, a lot of children across America struggle with problems.
With a little help from a good school or a great teacher, today's
stuttering child could be tomorrow's keynote speaker _ today's
potential dropout could become tomorrow's Thomas Edison.
   That's why Republican governors are leading a revolution in
American education. Orr in Indiana. Branstad in Iowa. Hunt in
Alabama. Martinez in Florida.
   The Democrats' response is always the same _ spend more money.
But Republican governors understand that money won't make a
difference unless we change other things as well.
   No more automatic passing of students from grade to grade. If
you can't write or read or count, you don't deserve a high school
diploma. Mediocrity can never be tolerated in teaching.
   From now on, hard work and creativity must be rewarded every
single day.
   When schools fail year after year, let's admit it is the fault
of adults, not children. Stop blaming the children. Fix the schools.
   And children cannot be educated if their minds are clouded by
drugs. Kingpins who make millions by selling drugs to children are
merchants of death.
