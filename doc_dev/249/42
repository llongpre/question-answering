   Here are some highlights of Kodak's 100
years in the movie industry:
   1889 _ George Eastman invents flexible roll film. It's 200 feet
long and today would be long enough to make a movie just over two
minutes long. Thomas Edison is his first customer.
   1899 _ Long rolls of film _ 1,000 feet _ are introduced. Long,
dramatic films become practical.
   1929 _ First film is made especially for sound motion pictures.
   1931 _ Kodak wins its first Oscar. The company will receive four
more for technical achievements.
   1946 _ First color print film is introduced. This is the
forerunner of the movies seen in theaters today.
   1948 _ Kodak introduces triacetate safety-base film to replace
nitrate-based film which was flammable, potentially explosive and,
when stored improperly, deteriorated into a powder.
   1974 _ Eastman Color Negative II film 5247, the company's most
versatile movie film, is introduced. It remains the most popular
negative movie film sold in the world.
   1982 _ Kodak introduces a negative film that allows
cinematographers to use less light when filming. The new film cuts
production costs.
   1989 _ Kodak introduces a film said to perform even better in
low-light situations and produce sharper images.
