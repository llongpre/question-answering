   When I graduated from college, my first job was at a suburban newspaper. 
It is now defunct, but at that time it was a reasonably viable operation that put a few young, and low-salaried, people into the writing business every year. 

   One of my first assignments was the standard interview with a person who had reached a significant post-octogenarian birthday and might have some words to pass along to the younger population. 
It is also an assignment no other reporter wants, so it usually goes to the new guy. 

   I was told to see a man named Tannenburg on his 95th birthday, an event that was being attended by dozens of children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and assorted in-laws from all over the country. 
After reading the bio sheet, I thought that his background was excellent for a feature story. 
He had fought in the Spanish-American War, survived the San Francisco earthquake, remembered seeing William Howard Taft, and actually met Thomas Edison. 

   The meeting with Tannenburg started off on a promising note. 
He was mentally sharp and his hearing and eyesight were quite good. 
He spoke in loud, clear tones and was, for all the world, a man totally in control of his faculties and quite capable of giving a young reporter a corking good story. 
Then he started on the cardboard. 

   "Never throw away a piece of cardboard," he said, as though anticipating a question about advice to the world. 
He went into an impromptu recitation of the many uses of cardboard in everyday living: wrapping packages, reinforcing, padding, burning, decorating and "fixing things." 
I tried to steer him into the Spanish-American War and recollections of Taft and Edison, but he would have none of it, preferring to explain the myriad ways that he had used cardboard that very week. 

   By this time there was no diverting him and it was clear that turn-of-the-century memories would remain in the past. 
I was ushered into a spare room where Tannenburg kept his cardboard supply -- bundles of tan and gray sheets, tied with string and ready for immediate application to that better life that we all seek. 
He was clearly ready, at a moment's notice, to wrap, repair, reinforce and pad. 

   As it turned out, I wrote the story from the bio sheet, adding a few observations about his personal appearance and some quotes from the relatives. 
The Tannenburg experience has never left me. 
This man had walked the earth for almost a century, had seen two world wars, a major depression, a complete shift in the balance of world power, and more than a dozen presidents -- yet to him it all crystallized in the necessity of having lots of cardboard available. 
I occasionally shudder with the frightening thought that maybe Tannenburg was right in his assessment of the meaning of it all. 

   This, then, is Tannenburg's Encapsulation of Life: "Never throw away a piece of cardboard." 
It makes sense; it does, indeed.
