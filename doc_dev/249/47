   The Hotel del Coronado, a lavish
Victorian seaside resort with a star-studded past, will celebrate
its centennial next weekend with an extravangaza befitting its most
gilded days.
   Built in 1888 for $1 million, the hotel is one of the world's
largest wooden structures and the nation's only working commercial
hotel with a national monument designation.
   Famous for its Queen Anne design, the Del, as the hotel is known
locally, has served as host to 10 presidents, royalty from around
the world and countless celebrities.
   Businessman Montgomery Ward, actors Charlie Chaplin and Mary
Pickford, and President Abraham Lincoln's son, Robert Todd, are
among those who signed its registry. Thomas Edison was the
five-story hotel's lighting technician.
   The picturesque resort of red-roofed turrets atop a white
gingerbread exterior on a peninsula south of San Diego also has
been a backdrop for a number of films and television shows.
   ``The Hotel Del is something fantastic,'' said silent screen
star Anita Paige, who stayed at the hotel while filming ``The
Flying Fleet'' in 1927. ``I've been to Europe since and their only
competition is in France.''
   A posh weekend party celebrating the 100th birthday of the
wooden castle's Feb. 19, 1888, opening begins Friday night.
   Some 750 guests, including dozens of celebrities and movie
stars, have paid $5,000 a couple to participate in the full
weekend. Proceeds will be donated to charity.
   At Friday night's festivities for 2,000, a disc jockey
resembling a hip Edison will spin records in one room as musicians
and dancers perform in others.
   Marilyn Monroe look-alikes and original Munchkins from the movie
``The Wizard of Oz'' will wander the paneled hallways. The film
``Some Like it Hot,'' starring Miss Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony
Curtis, was filmed on location at the hotel in 1958, and Oz author
L. Frank Baum, a frequent hotel guest, allegedly based his book's
Emerald City on the Del.
   Saturday will feature a harbor tour with America's Cup victor
Dennis Conner, a celebrity tennis tournament and a ball, followed
by a turn-of-the-century style picnic Sunday with hot air balloons
and a Navy air show.
   Comedians George Burns and Phyllis Diller will be among the
weekend's entertainers.
   But as current owner Larry Lawrence tells it, the hotel itself
nearly didn't make it to the party. When he bought the 399-room
hotel in 1963, it had fallen prey to termites and neglect.
   ``There was no electricity in many places, no water above the
second floor,'' said Lawrence, the hotel's sixth owner. ``It was
infested with termites and rats. This was a property that had
everything but the bulldozer gutting it down.''
   More than $40 million later, the hotel stands with its
stateliness restored. It has new foundations, plumbing, heating,
electricity and an $8 million fire protection system.
   A steel frame was implanted to bolster the Crown Room, a
monumental dining room with a sugar pine ceiling that rises 33
feet. The hotel also was expanded.
   In 1970, the Crown Room was the site of the largest state dinner
outside Washington, D.C., with then-President Richard Nixon,
outgoing President Lyndon Johnson, Mexican President Gustavo Diaz
Ordaz and 800 others.
   Today, about half of the hotel's guests are corporate
executives. With 1,400 employees serving 700 suites, guests pay a
premium for service, Lawrence said. The hotel's average rate is
$200 a day.
   It all began as a dream of railroad tycoon Elisha Babcock and
piano magnate H.L. Story, who envisioned while hunting on the
barren peninsula a resort that would be ``the talk of the Western
world.''
   It was designed by three brothers, former railroad architects
James, Merritt and Watson Reid, and built largely by unskilled
Chinese laborers. It became the largest structure outside of New
York City to be electrically lighted, powered by the first power
plant in California.
