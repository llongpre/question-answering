One is a cartoon. One is flesh and blood. But both Polly and Madeline -- the 
stars of two specials for children this week -- are lively young girls. 
</P>
<P>
You might remember Polly, played by "The Cosby Show's" Keshia Knight Pulliam, 
from last year's "Polly," a Disney musical special loosely based on Eleanor H. 
Porter's children's classic "Pollyanna." Pulliam played a girl who comes to 
live with her rich aunt (played by Phylicia Rashad, also of "Cosby") after her 
parents are killed in a car accident. The new Polly Comin' Home! continues 
where the story left off, with the 12-year-old heroine and her friends working 
to ease racial tension in her small town. In the process, Polly even helps her 
aunt rekindle a romance! The TV movie also stars Dorian Harewood and Barbara 
Montgomery of "Married People."

"Polly Comin' Home!" Sunday at 7 p.m., NBC. For families.

Madeline's Christmas is a new animated special based on the classic children's 
books by Ludwig Bemelmans. Here, the precocious Madeline, who lives at a 
boarding school in Paris, is the only girl in the school who isn't in bed with 
a cold. She finds herself faced with the awesome responsibility of spreading 
holiday cheer, but winds up getting help from a special visitor. Christopher 
Plummer narrates the charming tale.
