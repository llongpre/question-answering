   When asked to recall his most distant memories,
Hubert Everist went way back to the early days of electric light.
   Everist, of Sioux Falls, S.D., remembered being six years old
when he saw Thomas Edison's revolutionary invention, the
incandescent lamp, at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893.
   His recollections are among those of two dozen other people who
turned 100 years old in 1987 and responded to Northwestern Mutual
Life's fourth annual survey of centenarian policyholders.
   Oddly, of the 85 people who were contacted for the survey, there
was only one common surname _ Young.
   ``We could all learn something from the youthful spirit and zest
for life exhibited by many of those people who have already lived
full lives,'' Donald Schuenke, president of the insurance company,
said recently in making the results of the survey public.
   Such youthful spirit was reported by Anton Lee, of Falmouth,
Mass., who said he still plays golf, pulls his own cart and
regularly hits drives around 150 yards.
   In his lifetime, Lee said he has had seven holes-in-one,
including one at age 94.
   Hazel Marquart, of Crestline, Ohio, did not learn to drive until
she was 62. Although her vision deteriorated, making her nearly
blind for the past 20 years, she described how she has listened to
``talking books'' and has memorized poems.
   Other memories reported by the respondents included seeing
President Theodore Roosevelt give a speech, attending college with
Kansas Gov. Alf Landon and decorating a Christmas tree with real
candles.
   Many said the secret to their longevity was a healthy diet, a
good spouse and high moral standards. Also, more than half of the
centenarians noted that their parents had lived at least beyond age
80, and several reported that both parents lived beyond 90.
   But Adah Crane, of Austin, Minn., said she ``hasn't the faintest
idea'' how she reached the century mark.
   ``Being 100 years old has not been, to me, a time for creating
philosophy,'' she wrote. ``It was a surprise to me to reach my
100th birthday, but I don't think in terms of years. I think in
terms of friends and occasions.''
