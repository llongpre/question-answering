In a reversal of their earlier position, County Water Authority officials have 
informally agreed to pay $250,000 for a feasibility study on a public takeover 
of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., Mayor Maureen O'Connor announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, if ratified by the Water Authority's 35-member board of directors 
at its Feb. 9 meeting, could end a brief tussle between the Water Authority and 
the city of San Diego over who would pay for the study and set the research in 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached in a meeting between O'Connor and Water Authority 
Vice Chairman Mike Madigan last Thursday. The session also included Water 
Authority General Manager Lester Snow and San Diego City Atty. John Witt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full Board OK Is Expected 
</P>
<P>
"It's legal, and we're going to ask the Water Authority to pick up the tab," 
Madigan said in an interview Tuesday, adding, "I think the board will go along 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, the San Diego City Council instructed Witt to investigate 
allegations of improper contacts between SDG&amp;E and Southern California 
Edison -- whose parent company, SCEcorp., is attempting to buy the local 
utility for $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group, alleged 
Monday that SDG&amp;E is sharing "proprietary information" on power purchases, 
transmission-related contracts and purchases of goods and services with Edison, 
which remains an SDG&amp;E competitor until a merger is approved. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations came in a request to the state Public Utilities Commission for 
an injunction barring the sharing of information in the belief that Edison 
would gain a competitive advantage over SDG&amp;E during the 18 months before 
the merger either succeeded or fell through, said Michael Shames, UCAN's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
A published report also indicated that Edison officials have already 
participated in some decisions made by SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
"This alarming development raises serious questions about the legality of such 
a decision-making process," said O'Connor, who is leading a high-profile 
campaign against the merger. "It seems to us that such actions may seriously 
violate legal restrictions imposed by the city's franchises" as well as state 
and federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Ron Johnson said San Diego has no evidence of impropriety 
but was spurred by rumors and allegations to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accusations Disputed 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E Vice President Jack Thomas called the claims "baloney." 
</P>
<P>
"We are running San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and making decisions," he 
said. "We are abiding precisely with the merger agreement we have with Southern 
California Edison Co." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Public Utilities Commission said she could not comment on 
the allegations, which the commission has not formally received. She said 
SDG&amp;E and Edison would have 15 days to respond before the commission 
decides whether to hold a hearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Shames said his allegations stem from telephone calls he is receiving from 
SDG&amp;E employees and the terms of the merger agreement, which he believes 
lacks wording to protect proprietary information. 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas said Shames' claims are "simply not true. We are not exchanging 
information with Southern California Edison of a proprietary nature." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas agreed that other decisions have been made jointly since SDG&amp;E's 
board of directors agreed to Edison's buyout offer Dec. 1, including a change 
in the thrust of an advertising campaign and a switch of articles in a company 
newsletter. But he said the policy shifts were legal. 
</P>
<P>
On some matters, "We are not competing with Edison Co. now," he said. "We are 
engaged to be married. We've got a wedding here in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
The spat between San Diego and the Water Authority developed last month after a 
preliminary legal opinion from Water Authority attorney Paul Engstrand found 
that the agency could not legally finance the study with its money. 
</P>
<P>
After that opinion, the authority's Snow and City Manager John Lockwood met and 
agreed to propose that the city fund a study conducted by the water board. On 
Dec. 13, the City County voted to lend the Water Authority $250,000 for the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Water Authority directors voted to accept the payment the next day, but said 
they considered it a grant, to be repaid if the agency actually took over 
SDG&amp;E, which could take years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water Decision Reversed 
</P>
<P>
The impasse over whether the payment would be a loan or grant remained until 
Engstrand reversed himself Jan. 6, ruling that the Water Authority could spend 
its money on the feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent agreement for the Water Authority to finance the study, 
the City Council voted in closed session Tuesday to reaffirm that $225,000 of 
the proposed payment would be a loan not a grant, O'Connor said. Councilman Bob 
Filner, who opposes having the city finance the study, dissented from the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Johnson said, "We are not going to change it from a loan 
to a grant, but we are offering a loan."
