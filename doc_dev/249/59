   Some couples race to get to the altar. Carol
and Denny Bennett kept going.
   The pair got their marriage off to a running start Sunday as
nearly 1,800 competitors witnessed the wedding ceremony on the
starting line of the 12th annual River Corridor Classic half
marathon.
   The Bennetts, 41-year-old marathon enthusiasts from West
Carrollton, were wed in their running shorts minutes before
competing in the 13.1 mile race, in which Bennett finished 1,005th
and his wife 1,213th.
   The couple said they met on the finish line of a race in
Columbus two years ago and decided to have their wedding at the
race here so all their friends could attend.
   Although the best man and the maid of honor also are runners,
they opted for the traditional tuxedo and gown and did not run.
   ``Considering the fact that only 1 percent of the entire
population runs in marathons, I'd say we're pretty lucky to have
both a best man and a maid of honor who are marathoners,'' Bennett
said.
   The newlyweds said they plan to spend their honeymoon in Chicago
_ running in the Chicago Marathon.

   If, as Thomas Edison said, genius is 1 percent
inspiration and 99 percent perspiration, members of the Triple Nine
Society might have a hard time qualifying despite their soaring IQs.
   ``No jobs are appropriate for us,'' opined John Hart, 44, of
Phoenix. ``Any job in existence is designed for people at a lower
(intellectual) level, because there is no way they can count on
getting someone of our level.''
   About 30 members of the brainy brotherhood concluded their
fourth annual convention here last weekend with little fanfare _
and no agenda. The participants just sat and talked.
   The Triple Nine Society considers its international membership a
little more exclusive than Mensa, another ``genius'' society. To be
eligible for Triple Niner status, a person must have an IQ above
150, or higher than 99.9 percent of the population.
   Mensa, which is more widely known, is open to anyone whose IQ is
above only 98 percent of the population.
   Despite their intellectual certitude, Triple Niners weren't
quite sure whether they should rule out setting an agenda for
future conferences.
   ``It might be useful,'' Hart said.
   ``Then again,'' said Rita Beechey, 42, of Ontario, Canada, ``it
might not.''
