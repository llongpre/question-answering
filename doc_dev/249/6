   When Philip B. Petersen was convicted in
1986 of stealing more than $200,000 worth of historical documents
from the Thomas A. Edison National Historic Site, he promised to
give all the artifacts back.
   Petersen, 68, admitted Friday that he hadn't kept his word.
   The former Stanford University professor pleaded guilty to
selling more artifacts from the museum, admitting that he had hidden
some of his booty from federal agents investigating the heist three
years ago.
   Petersen, of Redwood City, Calif., faces up to 20 years in prison
after entering the plea in U.S. Federal District Court.
   Federal officials said Petersen visited the museum in West
Orange, N.J., about 30 times between 1974 and 1976 on the pretense
that he was conducting historical research on Edison's invention of
the phonograph.
   In 1985, officials seized $200,000 worth of letters, artifiacts,
sketches and equipment from Petersen's home after being tipped by a
North Carolina collector who had bought several documents from him.
   Petersen pleaded guilty to stealing the documents, and was
sentenced to two months in prison and five years probation. He is
currently in the third year of that probation, officials said.
   The plea agreement required Petersen to turn over all of the
stolen artifacts to federal officials. But officials recently were
tipped by a California collector that Petersen had asked to be put
in touch with Japanese customers who might be interested in Edison
artifacts.
   In a raid last October, federal agents recovered more than 180
Edison-related items from Petersen's house.
   ``The first time around, because there was such a large amount of
items recovered, it was impossible to tell if there was anything
left,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin McCarthy. ``We believe
this is it, though.''
   Fahy Whitaker, superintendent of the West Orange historic site,
said many of the items recovered in the two FBI raids were ``one of
a kind things.''
   ``They all add to our understanding of Edison and how he
worked,'' Ms. Whitaker said. ``We're happy we've gotten these back,
but we know there is more out there. He sold a lot of it.''
