Being at the right place at the right time three times in a row keyed Edison 
High School to a 30-16 nonleague victory over Dominguez Thursday night in front 
of 2,000 at Westminster High School. 
</P>
<P>
It also offered a prime opportunity for tailback Shane Sherman, who scored 
three touchdowns to lead the Chargers (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
Although Edison trailed, 16-13, late in the third quarter, its defense forced 
three turnovers, all of which led to consecutive scoring drives. 
</P>
<P>
With seconds remaining in the third quarter, Dominguez' James Jackson fumbled 
at his own three-yard line, thanks to a swarming Edison defense. Charger tackle 
Lawson Mollica recovered at the three, and Sherman scored what proved to be the 
winning touchdown on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play of Dominguez' next possession, Dominguez running back Bruce 
Walker fumbled, and Edison's Miles Charlier recovered on the Dominguez 25. 
Eight plays later, Sherman scored again, this on a four-yarder, and Doug 
Merlino's kick gave the Chargers a 27-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But neither team was finished with this routine yet. On Dominguez' very next 
possession, quarterback Thomas Lyons was intercepted at its 32 by linebacker 
Nick Agosta. Although Sherman's work brought the ball to the 14, Merlino gave 
Edison its final score with a 24-yard field goal with 1:28 remaining in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman, who rushed for 69 yards in 22 carries, also scored Edison's first 
touchdown on a four-yard run in the first quarter. He said he and his teammates 
were particularly inspired Thursday night after their 37-10 loss to Capistrano 
Valley last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Our team worked really hard this week. That loss was real tough for us," 
Sherman said. "They (Dominguez) gave up really early tonight. That 45 (Walker) 
was really tired. We didn't give up. We had pride. They didn't. That's what it 
takes." 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a highly recruited 6-foot 4-inch, 240-pound senior, looked sensational 
at the start, plowing over and through Edison's defense, and scoring his only 
touchdown on a 31-yard run in the first quarter. At defense, he was a threat 
too, but by the end of the game, he was little threat at all. 
</P>
<P>
Edison quarterback Donnie Smith, who finished 11 for 17 for 136 yards and an 
interception, looked especially sharp in the first quarter where he completed 7 
of 8 passes. Junior fullback Craig Shusterick contributed Edison's other 
touchdown on a six-yard run early in the third quarter.
