   Ohio University announced Tuesday it expects
to receive a patent this week for a genetic engineering process
that has revolutionized medical and agricultrual research.
   The ``DNA microinjection process'' was developed by Thomas E.
Wagner, a molecular geneticist at the university, and Peter C.
Hoppe, a researcher at Jackson Laboratories at Bar Harbor, Maine.
   Microinjection is a microsurgical technique in which genetic
material with a new, desirable trait is injected into an embryo
shortly after fertilizaion.
   It is being used to develop genetically modified animals that
could boost agricultural production and improve medical and
pharmaceutical research and manufacturing.
   In microinjection, the developing embryo incorporates the new
gene into its genetic makeup, passing on the improved trait to
future generations of so-called ``transgenic'' animals.
   ``Transgenic animals are emerging as a fundamental tool in
medical and pharmaceutical research and product development,
chemical safety testing and in the improvement of the health and
value of livestock animals,'' said Paul Schmitt, president of
Princeton, N.J.-based DNX Inc., the only business licensed by the
univeristy to use the process.
   ``Since the patent covers a fundamental and widely used
technology, we expect to establish a broad commercial licensing
program,'' he said.
   Wagner and Hoppe assigned the patent to OU, and Wagner's
royalties will go to the OU Foundation, which supports research by
the Edison Animal Biotechnology Center in Athens. Wagner is
director of the center.
   In 1981, Wagner led a team first that used the technique to
transfer a gene for rabbit hemoglobin _ the material in red blood
cells that carries oxygen thoughout the body _ into a mouse embryo,
passing rabbit blood traits to the mouse.
   Pigs, rats, mice, goats and other animals have since been
altered using the technique.
   Wagner was first interested in the concept for boosting
agricultural production, such as by producing cows that give more
milk or animals that are disease-resistant.
   He said there is even more potential in medical research,
including development of mice and other research animals that can
develop human diseases such as diabetes, hepatitis or acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, and can be used to test medications.
   Sheep have been bio-engineered to produce milk carrying a vital
human blood clotting factor that hemophiliacs need, Wagner said.
Mice have been altered to produce milk containing TPA, a protein
prescribed for heart attack victims.
   The process works because it is natural for chromosomes, the
cell's long strands of genes, to be damaged. While the cell repairs
itself, the foreign genetic material is incorporated into
chromosomes. The altered egg is then implanted into a surrogate
mother.
   Ohio University said DNA microinjection was the technique
employed by Harvard researcher Phil Leder to develop the first
patented transgenic animal, the ``Harvard mouse.''
   Microinjection also is used in the development of improved
livestock, much of which is done by DNX.
   DNX was formed in 1984 as the Edison Center's private-sector
partner to develop commercial applications of prototype organisms
produced by OU scientists.
