<HEAD>Anne Frank Letter to American Pen Pals to Go to Wiesenthal Center</HEAD>

   Letters written by Anne Frank and her sister
to two American girls in 1940 will be given to the Simon Wiesenthal
Center's new museum by an anonymous donor who bought them at auction
for $150,000.
   The letters will be featured prominently near the entrance of the
Beit Hashoah Museum of Tolerance when it opens in 1989 and may also
be displayed on world tours, Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the center's
associate dean, said Wednesday.
   ``We were pleasantly surprised and honored that we were thought
of and were given what we considered a historic opportunity,''
Cooper said. The letters ``should not be somewhere in a drawer or a
vault.''
   The letters, auctioned by Swann Galleries in New York on Tuesday,
had been kept for decades by Betty Ann and Juanita Wagner, sisters
who corresponded with the Frank girls as pen pals just before Nazi
Germany invaded The Netherlands.
   The Franks, who were Jewish, hid in an Amsterdam attic for two
years until they were discovered and sent to concentration camps.
Anne, born in 1929, died at Belsen in 1945. Her father, Otto, was
the family's only survivor.
   Wiesenthal, a famed Nazi hunter, tracked down and arrested Karl
Silberbauer, the Gestapo agent who arrested the Frank family, Cooper
said. Silberbauer was not convicted of any crime, however, and
continued working as a police inspector in Vienna, Austria.
   Anne's poignant diary of life in hiding was published in 1947 and
was later made into a play and a movie titled ``The Diary of Anne
Frank.''
   Betty Ann and Juanita Wagner wrote to Anne and Margot Frank in
1940 at the suggestion of a teacher in their hometown, Danville,
Iowa. At the time, Anne and Juanita were 11; Margot and Betty Ann
were 15.
   Anne and Margot sent back two photographs, a postcard and two
letters describing their life in Amsterdam. Margot wrote that
``having a frontier with Germany and being a small country we never
feel safe.''
   The Wagners wrote back, but there was no reply. A month after the
letters were sent, Germany invaded The Netherlands.
   ``We'd worried about her during the war, but never dreamed she
was suffering,'' said Betty Ann Wagner, reached at her home in the
Los Angeles area.
   The letters give insight into Anne Frank's personality, Cooper
said.
   ``It gives a good exposure into the young girl. There isn't that
much that deals with the tragedies of her life, but it gives a good
sense for who the person was,'' he said.
