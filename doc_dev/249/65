<LEADPARA>  WHEN you write a book with section titles such as "The History of Paint" or
"Living With Electricity" or "The Joys of Joint Compound," you'd better be
good.;   David Owen, a 36-year-old writer who lives in a 200-year-old house in
Washington, Conn., is good. His new book, "The Walls Around Us" (Villard, $21)
is an entertaining, often hilarious, book about houses.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     From the first sentence ("I love buying expensive power tools and using
them to wreck various parts of my house"), the book is filled with
personality. That's rare in how-to books.;   Owen's house -- where he lives
with his wife, Ann Hodgman, and two children -- is the book's prototype, the
launching point for discussions on paint, lumber, roofs, walls, siding,
electricity and so on.;   "The book is sort of a record of my experience with
this house," Owen says. "It started when we tried to get rid of horrible
wallpaper. It was put up over walls that were falling apart. When we took it
down, we realized we had to deal with the walls.";   Houses are like that. You
try to solve one problem, only to discover something worse. This leads to the
book's core question: "Are houses evil?";   "Every house is a work in
progress," Owen writes. "To tinker with a house is to commune with the people
who have lived in it before and to leave messages for people who will live in
it later. Every house is a living museum of habitation, and a monument to all
the lives and aspirations that have flickered within it.;   "Also, of course,
it eats money.";   In each chapter, Owen gives a little history on the way
houses are built, then weaves in step-by-step descriptions of attempted home
repairs, then gives practical advice on products and techniques.;   In the
chapter on electricity, for example, he tells of Nikola Tesla, the scientist
responsible for introducing alternating current -- the electric power we use
today.;   Unlike Thomas Edison, Tesla didn't have much business sense. He
ended up an impoverished eccentric who washed his hands compulsively and once
told a friend that he loved a particular pigeon "as a man loves a woman.";  
Well, we didn't read THAT in the latest Time-Life home repair book.;   The
chapter continues with Owen's tale of trying to clean his gutters in his bare
feet, with an aluminum ladder, on a rainy afternoon.;   He kept tugging on the
ladder's rope-and-pulley arrangement to raise the extension, with little
effect. When he looked up, through rain drops splattering his eye glasses, he
saw the ladder was entangled in electric power lines.;   "I was barefoot,
standing in wet grass, and clinging to a wet aluminum ladder," he writes. "The
wire against which I had jammed the extension was carrying enough current to
kill me many times over. When I realized what I had done, I jumped backward
from the ladder and let it crash to the ground. Trembling in my yard, I
resolved to sell all my personal belongings and gratefully spend my remaining
days in service to others.";   Owen says he loves old houses, but he's not a
purist.;   He notes that many modern building products -- vinyl sheet
flooring, wallboard, fiberglass roof shingles, kitchen counter-top materials
-- are extremely durable and easy to install.;   "When we redid the roof on
this house, we used wood shingles," he says. "But the correct choice for most
people would be fiberglass . . . They go on easy, are attractive and last
practically forever.";   So then, David, back to the question: Are houses
evil?;   "The short answer would be no," he says. "It's sort of like a
marriage. You and the house have to get used to each other."  </TEXT>
