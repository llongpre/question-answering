   Rob Herman grew up thinking he was lazy. His
IQ was 156 but he couldn't read, he had trouble writing and his
teachers always made fun of him. He became the class clown.
   He obtained his high school diploma at a private school without
doing any work. He forged his transcript to get into the University
of Montana but flunked out after four semesters.
   Herman still calls himself a clown, but he's not in class
anymore. On Thursday, he and two other students became the first
graduates of Landmark College, the nation's only college for
dyslexics.
   ``This place changed my life,'' said Herman, a 26-year-old from
Great Neck, N.Y., with a beard, a quick smile and black curly hair
that falls to his shoulders. ``It gave me an opportunity to get an
education, to understand myself, to accomplish goals for myself.
   ``If I didn't come here, I don't know where I'd be _ probably
working a manual labor job somewhere,'' he said.
   Dyslexia is a language disability commonly known for the
reversal of letters. Dyslexics also have trouble organizing their
thoughts, writing them down, remembering names, taking notes and
learning languages.
   It affects 10 percent of the population. There is no known cure
for the disability, which has numbered Nelson Rockefeller, Thomas
Edison and Hans Christian Anderson among its sufferers.
   Since 1971, more than 2,000 young dyslexics have attended the
Landmark School in Prides Crossing, Mass. The affiliated college
opened in September 1985, in red and white brick buildings formerly
occupied by the bankrupt Windham College.
   The first year, 77 students enrolled in the pre-college and
college programs, the latter leading to an associate's degree in
general studies.
   The student population has doubled. Landmark's budget is strong,
it is a candidate for accreditation, and its five-year plan
includes more dormitory space, a better library and a scholarship
fund.
   ``I think things are going very well,'' President Jim Olivier
said in an interview in his office Wednesday. ``We've been
successful in doing what we set out to do, which is prepare
students for success in non-specialized colleges.''
   Landmark students have been accepted at more than 100 colleges
and universities.
   Olivier said although Landmark's curricula is not very different
from any other general studies college, teaching is very
individualized, with a student-faculty ratio of 3-1. Students are
expected to learn the same subject matter as students at other
schools, but they are given more time to read texts and take exams.
   Herman found out about Landmark through an education consultant.
The other graduates, Kevin Gott and Paul Hudson, read articles
about the program.
   Gott, a lanky, athletic man from Baltimore, found out he had
dyslexia in high school. He thought he could cut it at St. Olaf
College in Northfield, Minn., but he quit at the end of the year.
He said they had the facilities to help him but he was too
embarrassed to ask.
   Landmark helped him stick it out in school. ``I guess the
biggest thing for me is increasing my self-confidence,'' said Gott,
26, who was honored this year with two achievement awards.
   Hudson, a Canadian, also praised the school for raising his
self-esteem. A former computer programmer, he plans to become an
astronomer.
   ``I probably would have gone to some community college, some
low-level school, got a bachelor's degree and taken a job with
computers. And that would be it,'' said Hudson, 22, who as a child
often dreamed of the stars while visiting a Montreal planetarium.
``Instead of setting myself up for failure, now I know what I can
do.''
   The cost at Landmark College is a prohibitive $20,500 a year for
tuition, room and board, with limited financial aid from the
institution _ a fact that upsets the graduates.
   ``I hate seeing this school just be here for people whose
parents can afford it,'' said Herman, the son of a Pennsylvania
businessman, who said he'd like to start a scholarship fund.
