For four weeks, 38 fifth-grade students used paint and brushes to create their 
own images of a parade on three 4-by-8 feet sheets of plywood. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, their moment had come. They gathered at the Pasadena Hilton to see 
the unveiling of the murals, designed and painted solely by the students with 
the direction of Los Angeles Muralist Glenna Boltuch Avila. They used the theme 
Fantasy Parade, depicting parade scenes as seen through the eyes of the 
students, Hilton spokeswoman Marge Gammon said.

The Pasadena Hilton -- in cooperation with the Adopt-A-School Program, the 
Armory Center for the Arts and the Thomas Edison Elementary School -- sponsored 
the mural painting program, Gammon said.

Students from Thomas Edison Elementary School in Altadena were chosen to create 
the murals to teach them a new art form and to brighten the front of the hotel, 
she said.

<P>
The murals will be on display for about a month, while the Hilton's new lobby, 
lounge and restaurant are under construction. After the renovations are 
completed, the murals may be placed inside the hotel, Gammon said. Luz
