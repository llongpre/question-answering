SDG&amp;E WITHDRAWS FROM CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, upset by the Greater San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce's active opposition to the utility's proposed merger with Southern 
California Edison, will not renew its long-running membership in the business 
and civic group, SDG&amp;E's chief operating officer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the merger, which SDG&amp;E officials believe will benefit San 
Diego's business community, is "inconsistent with the chamber's goal of 
supporting causes that enhance the economic well-being of this city and 
county," Jack E. Thomas said. The chamber's steadfast and highly public 
opposition to the merger makes it "awkward" for SDG&amp;E to remain in the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber President Lee Grissom said SDG&amp;E has been a "very good and 
supportive member of the chamber" since joining in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
"While the withdrawal disappoints us, it was not a surprise," Grissom said. "It 
was one of the considerations we had to (weigh) when we made the decision to 
take an opposing position to the Edison merger." 
</P>
<P>
Grissom described SDG&amp;E's decision to leave the chamber as proof that 
Rosemead-based Edison has largely taken control of the local utility. Since the 
merger surfaced, local utility managers have "done a corporate Chernobyl," 
Grissom said. "They just melted down inside." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E's absence will help to strengthen the chamber's opposition to the 
proposed merger, Grissom said. The chamber won't be hurt financially by 
SDG&amp;E's withdrawal because several chamber members have already volunteered 
to donate the equivalent of SDG&amp;E's dues, Grissom said. SDG&amp;E would 
have been assessed $23,000 in corporate dues for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber had a $2.7-million budget during 1989, Grissom said. SDG&amp;E's 
dues were equivalent to about two weeks' worth of the chamber's payroll, 
Grissom said. 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that SDG&amp;E's management is out of step with the mainstream 
San Diego business community on the merger issue. According to results of a 
September poll authorized by the chamber, 56% of its members oppose the merger 
and 11% favor it. The remainder are undecided, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E's withdrawal from the chamber, "if anything, puts starch into our 
resolve," Grissom said. "It makes us stronger than before." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who will leave the chamber board of directors at the end of this year, 
maintained that SDG&amp;E "doesn't have a war with the chamber. . . . We intend 
to maintain a strong position in the business community with organizations that 
share our vision of the future." 
</P>
<P>
"While we respectfully acknowledge the stand the chamber has taken, we in good 
conscience cannot support it," Thomas said in a letter Tuesday to Pat Crowell, 
the chamber's chairman-elect. "The chamber should be, as it always has been, 
allied with SDG&amp;E. But it is not." 
</P>
<P>
"This is an interesting estrangement, in all honesty," Grissom said. "It's not 
a personal issue, because I have great respect for (SDG&amp;E Chairman) Tom 
Page. And we just reinvited (SDG&amp;E board member) Clair Burgener to be on 
our board. So it's not a personal issue."
