STATE GRANTS NEW LIQUOR LICENSE TO STORE MOVING 475 FEET DOWN STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the objections of residents, state officials have granted a new liquor 
license to a Colorado Street business that wants to relocate 475 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
The license will allow owners of Colorado Liquor, 412 1/2 W. Colorado St., to 
sell alcohol at their new location, 470 W. Colorado St. The store is to open in 
about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control granted the license to store owner 
Sang Jong Cheun on the recommendation of a state judge. 
</P>
<P>
Cheun decided last year to move after his lease was not renewed, business 
associates have said. 
</P>
<P>
In January, however, ABC officials denied his request for a license at the new 
location after objections from residents in the 400 block of West Colorado 
Street and from the principal of nearby Thomas Edison Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents submitted a petition to licensing authorities, signed by 35 
residents opposing the move. They complained about traffic and litter, and said 
that despite the short distance involved, the move would add another liquor 
store to a half-block cluster that already has two convenience stores, a 
market, a drugstore and a restaurant, all of which sell beer and wine. 
</P>
<P>
Cheun appealed. During a hearing in June before Administrative Law Judge Paul 
Hogan, a business associate of Cheun's testified that trash would be collected 
diligently at the new location. 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling June 28, Hogan recommended granting a new liquor license. He said 
potential traffic and litter problems were unlikely because the store was 
moving only a short distance, said Mary Ann Presswood, an attorney for the 
state liquor control agency. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its initial denial, the department decided to follow Hogan's 
recommendation and on Aug. 23 granted the license, Presswood said. Residents 
did not appeal the decision, she said.
