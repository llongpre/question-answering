   Today is Friday, Jan. 27, the 27th day of 1989. There are 338
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Jan. 27, 1756, composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in
Salzburg, Austria.
   On this date:
   In 1832, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, who would gain fame as author
Lewis Carroll, was born in Cheshire, England.
   In 1880, Thomas Edison received a patent for his electric
incandescent lamp.
   In 1943, the first all-American air raid took place against
Germany during World War II.
   In 1951, an era of atomic testing in the Nevada desert began as
an Air Force plane dropped a one-kiloton bomb on Frenchman Flats.
   In 1967, astronauts Virgil I. ``Gus'' Grissom, Edward H. White
and Roger B. Chaffee died in a flash fire during a routine test
aboard their ``Apollo One'' spacecraft at Cape Kennedy, Fla.
   In 1973, the Vietnam peace accords were signed in Paris, bringing
to an end the longest foreign war in U.S. history.
   In 1977, the Vatican reaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church's ban
on female priests, declaring a priest must bear a ``natural
resemblance'' to Christ, who ``was and remains a man.''
   In 1985, the secret three-day military-satellite mission of the
space shuttle Discovery ended with a smooth landing in Florida.
   Ten years ago: A woman, saying she was on a religious mission,
commandeered a Los Angeles-to-New York United Airlines flight by
claiming to have nitroglycerine in her bag. (The plane sat for more
than six hours in New York as FBI agents talked with the woman
before overpowering her _ there were no explosives.)
   Five years ago: Singer Michael Jackson suffered second-degree
burns to his scalp after his hair caught fire when a smoke-bomb
canister exploded as he was filming a TV commercial for Pepsi-Cola
at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
   One year ago: The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved
the nomination of Judge Anthony M. Kennedy to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Today's birthdays: Musical conductor Skitch Henderson is 71.
Actor Troy Donahue is 53. Ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov is 41.
   Thought for today: ``If we die, we want people to accept it ...
We are in a risky business and we hope that if anything happens to
us, it will not delay the program. The conquest of space is worth
the risk of life.'' _ Lt. Col. Virgil I. ``Gus'' Grissom (1926-1967).
