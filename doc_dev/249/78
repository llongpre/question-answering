<LEADPARA>  Kindergartners were searched for weapons and drugs in a sweep school officials

5-YEAR-OLDS CAUGHT IN INDIANAPOLIS DRUG, WEAPONS
SEARCH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The junior high school houses a kindergarten class, whose students were
searched by security guards using hand-held metal detectors.;   Superintendent
Shirl E. Gilbert II said the searches were meant "to deter anyone from taking
weapons into the school." He said kindergartners were searched because
officials feared older students might have the youngsters carry weapons or
drugs for them.;   But Michael Lee Gradison, the executive director of the
Indiana Civil Liberties Union, said the searches frightened the youngest
children and taught the older ones disrespect for law and school authorities.;
  "I heard students say, 'If we wanted to get drugs or weapons on the campus,
this isn't going to stop us,' " Gradison said Thursday. "The kids, I swear,
are laughing at this like crazy. It is having no impact.";   Gradison, who was
invited by school officials to witness the searches, said some 5- and
6-year-olds were frightened. One girl cried and two boys refused to stand up
to be searched, he said.;   "The idea that this is not intimidating and
frightening to the kids is pretty preposterous," he said. "It's preposterous
for any of these kids, because they can't name one person they suspect of
carrying dope or weapons.";   Officials said Wednesday's search produced five
rounds of .22 and .25 caliber ammunition taken from one older student.;   The
search at the high school turned up nine knives, five telephone beepers and a
can of tear gas, they said. Authorities say drug dealers often use telephone
beepers to keep in touch with customers.;   Gradison said he would meet with
Gilbert to propose modifying future searches.;   Cynthia Gohmann, whose
daughter Stephanie Southwood attends Arlington High School, said she would go
to court if her daughter is ordered to submit to a search.;   "I'm not going
to quit," she said. "If they search my child forcefully or remove her from
school because she refuses to have her rights violated, I will go to court on
it."  </TEXT>
