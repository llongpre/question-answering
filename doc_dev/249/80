   Today is Wednesday, Nov. 21, the 325th day of 1990. There are 40
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Nov. 21, 1877, inventor Thomas A. Edison announced the
invention of his phonograph, which he dubbed a ``talking machine.''
   On this date:
   In 1789, North Carolina became the 12th state to ratify the U.S.
Constitution.
   In 1922, Rebecca L. Felton of Georgia was sworn in as the first
woman to serve as a member of the U.S. Senate.
   In 1934, the Cole Porter musical ``Anything Goes,'' starring
Ethel Merman as Reno Sweeney, opened at the Alvin Theater in New
York.
   In 1942, the Alaska highway across Canada was formally opened.
   In 1963, President Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline, arrived in
San Antonio to begin a two-day tour of Texas.
   In 1964, the Verrazano Narrows - at that time, the world's
longest suspension bridge - opened to traffic, linking the New York
City boroughs of Brooklyn and Staten Island.
   In 1969, the Senate voted 55-45 against the nomination of
Clement F. Haynsworth to the U.S. Supreme Court, the first time a
candidate for the nation's highest court had been rejected since
1930.
   In 1973, President Nixon's attorney, J. Fred Buzhardt, revealed
the presence of an 18{-minute gap in one of the White House tape
recordings related to Watergate.
   In 1979, a mob attacked the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan,
setting the building afire and killing two Americans, following
rumors the U.S. and Israel were involved in the takeover of the
Grand Mosque in Mecca.
   Ten years ago: 87 people died in a fire at the MGM Grand
Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas. An estimated 83 million TV viewers tuned
in to the CBS prime-time soap opera ``Dallas'' to find out ``who
shot J.R.'' (It turned out to be Kristin Shephard, played by Mary
Crosby.)
   Five years ago: President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev concluded their Geneva summit and headed home. Former
U.S. Navy intelligence analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard was arrested,
accused of spying for Israel.
   One year ago: The proceedings of Britain's House of Commons were

50. Actress Juliet Mills is 49. Actress Goldie Hawn is 45.

   Thought for Today: ``Worry. How pointless. I know the theory is
that all this concern for the frustrated aged or forgotten Chinese
children helps to change attitudes and to create at least an
atmosphere in which something might happen ... but I wonder if it
doesn't work the other way round as well. ... You get too used to
it. You just shrug.'' - Katharine Whitehorn, British newspaper
columnist.
