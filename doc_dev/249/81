   Well, we Republicans delivered. After eight years of Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, our country is stronger, safer and better
today _ and Americans are proud to admit it!
   But new challenges lie ahead. ... we want new freedoms.
   Freedom from racism. Freedom from poor schools. Freedom from
polluted oceans. Freedom from crack dealers.
   And most of all, we want freedom to know that our future will be
made right here; in the United States of America.
   Many of us have been blessed with good jobs, good homes and good
families, but we also care about those who are not so fortunate.
   We have to care. Because their future is now our future. Their
tomorrow is our tomorrow. The simple truth is: there are no spare
Americans any longer.
   To those who are ill-schooled, ill-trained or ill-housed _ we
must reach out and lift the artificial weights as Lincoln promised.
As Republicans, we will do it not only because economically it is
the only thing to do, but because morally it is the right thing to
do. ...
   As a child, I had a terrible stutter. I also had dyslexia. I
overcame those problems, but I couldn't have done it alone. I went
to a good school. I had good teachers.
   Today, a lot of children across America struggle with problems.
With a little help from a good school or a great teacher, today's
stuttering child could be tomorrow's keynote speaker _ today's
potential dropout could become tomorrow's Thomas Edison. ...
   When schools fail year after year, let's admit it is the fault
of adults, not children. Stop blaming the children. Fix the schools.
   And children cannot be educated if their minds are clouded by
drugs. Kingpins who make millions by selling drugs to children are
merchants of death.
   I agree with George Bush. Those who dispense illegal drugs,
should be prepared to have death dispensed to them. ...
   George Bush is a decent man _ and he shouldn't have to defend
his being one. If defending values such as loyalty, family, or
belief in God is no longer fashionable, then I fear for our
country. ...
   Today our air is plagued by acid rain _ our oceans and beaches
are sullied by sewage and syringes _ our very future threatened by
sunburn from above and poisoned water from below.
   The party of Teddy Roosevelt must regain our environmental
heritage. In the 1990s we are going to clean America from one coast
to the other _ you know what? We are going to start way up north _
in Boston Harbor! ...
   Let us send one message to the Democrats this evening _ we will
not concede one single vote anywhere! Let the Dukakis Democrats
offer the politics of delusion and exclusion. We Republicans will
practice the ``Politics of inclusion.'' ...
   With God's help, we will reclaim the faith of our fathers _ we
will ``practice the Politics of Inclusion.''
   With George Bush as our leader, we will redeem our American
Dream. ...
