ANTIQUE RECORDINGS TURN DENTIST'S HOME INTO A WAX MUSEUM

In the compact disc era, people who talk about spinning some old records 
usually mean breaking out the big vinyl LPs. 
</P>
<P>
But when Michael Khanchalian, a 34-year-old dentist, hankers to listen to a 
bygone tune, he gingerly slips a wax, cylinder-shaped record from a cardboard 
box. Next, he cranks up one of his many turn-of-the-century phonographs, 
attaches an oversize, goose-neck brass or wooden horn to the machine and gently 
sets down the stylus. 
</P>
<P>
"This is beyond nostalgia," said Khanchalian, sitting in the den of his 
Monrovia home, listening to some of the first records ever produced. "I don't 
collect them because I remember Teddy Roosevelt or Sarah Bernhardt. I do it to 
resurrect the sounds of the past -- to make history come alive." 
</P>
<P>
Wax records, invented by Thomas Alva Edison, were first produced commercially 
in 1890 and manufactured as late as 1929. Two of the most famous songs recorded 
on wax were "A Bicycle Built for Two" and "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow fanciers of the records, known as cylinders, say Khanchalian has one of 
the best collections anywhere. They praise him for using his dentistry skills 
to repair the delicate cylinders for collectors around the country, thus 
helping to preserve a dying medium. 
</P>
<P>
The wax records are about the same size and shape as the cardboard tube inside 
a roll of toilet paper. To play them, the hollow cylinder is placed on a 
mandrel, a metal spindle. The wax record revolves at a high speed while a 
needle moves up and down on hundreds of grooves. Sound quality varies from 
muddled static to surprising clarity depending on the condition of the 
cylinder. 
</P>
<P>
Among Khanchalian's roughly 1,000 wax cylinders is a recording of Theodore 
Roosevelt giving a speech about labor laws when he was running for President 
under the aegis of the Bull Moose Party. Other political recordings -- used by 
candidates to reach a mass audience before radio broadcasts began in 1920 -- 
include cylinder-preserved debates between Democrat William Jennings Bryan and 
Republican William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Khanchalian's copious collection -- stored in cabinets and drawers in his guest 
room, living room, dining room, garage and just about anywhere else he can find 
space -- includes an 1898 cylinder of George W. Johnson, an early black 
recording artist. 
</P>
<P>
He also has a selection of vaudeville recordings made by, among others, 
comedienne Sophie Tucker in 1910. And there is a 1908 recording by early 
Oscar-winning actress Marie Dressler, who tells her audience that she is a 
"self-supporting suffragette," before launching into a raucous rendition of 
"I'm a Respectable Working Girl." 
</P>
<P>
Khanchalian, vice president of the California Antique Phonograph Society, which 
has about 300 members, loves to wax on about the hobby he began as a 
10-year-old boy after an aunt gave him his first cylinder. He started 
collecting seriously in 1981 and now counts two records in particular as his 
most prized possessions. One is his oldest record, an 1891 recording of Patrick 
Gilmore's military band playing "The College Song." (Gilmore was John Philip 
Sousa's mentor.) The other is one of only two recordings in existence of a 
once-popular evangelist team, Ira Sankey and Dwight L. Moody.

"Mike has one of the best vintage record collections that exists today," said 
Rick Wilkins, curator of the Olden Year Musical Museum in Duncanville, Tex. "He 
has some of the oldest records in the world." 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps as important as his collection is Khanchalian's ability to repair 
the fragile wax records, worth anywhere from a few dollars to a few thousand 
dollars each. As a dentist, he has been able to transfer some of his skills, 
painstakingly filling cracks and breaks in a damaged cylinder much the same way 
he would craft a crown or fill a cavity. He even uses dental wax and the small 
silver tools of his trade to repair the records. 
</P>
<P>
"In dental school you learn to be accurate within a tenth of a millimeter," 
said Khanchalian, who practices in Pasadena. "If you are off in dentistry, the 
patient can really feel it. The same is true of the cylinders. You have to 
match up the grooves exactly right or it won't work." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, collectors across the country credit Khanchalian with saving some of 
the rarest and most valuable vintage recordings. 
</P>
<P>
"He's amazing," said Allen Koenigsberg, editor and publisher of the Antique 
Phonograph Monthly, a New York magazine with a circulation of about 2,000. 
"Before Mike started fixing these things, most people gave up on them. When 
they break, they're like a jigsaw puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins has sent some of the more important cylinders from his museum 
collection to Khanchalian for restoration. "He's the only one in the world that 
does it," Wilkins said. "He's saving historic recordings that were made in the 
1800s that otherwise would be lost." 
</P>
<P>
Restoring the old cylinders is tedious, so Khanchalian takes on projects only 
for a handful of collectors. "I try to just work on the really rare ones," he 
said. "For me, it's a labor of love." 
</P>
<P>
In return for saving cherished cylinders for his peers, Khanchalian often is 
paid in the currency he loves best: another cylinder for his collection. "I 
just love early recorded sound," he said. "It's as if you were right there."
