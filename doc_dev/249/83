   The Illinois Commerce Commission dealt a serious setback to the nation's largest nuclear utility, rejecting Commonwealth Edison Co.'s controversial plan to form a generating subsidiary that would consist of three nuclear power plants. 

   The commission voted 4-3 to turn down a proposal Commonwealth Edison made last December. 
The utility's proposal, which was viewed by the industry as a major step toward deregulation, would have placed its Byron 2 and Braidwood 1 and 2 nuclear plants under a separate but wholly owned generating company. 
The plan also would have raised the utility's annual electric rates by 9.6%, or $660 million, and frozen rates for five years. 

   "I am confident the ratepayers could do much better," said Susan Stone, one of the commissioners who vetoed the proposal. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the company's shares closed at $34.375, down 37.5 cents. 
The commission's decision came minutes before the market closed in New York. 

   The utility said it would immediately file a request for a rehearing with the commission. 
Commonwealth Edison also indicated it may be willing to back off on one of the most controversial elements of its plan -- the utility's non-negotiable objection to an outside audit of the three nuclear plants. 

   Before the commission's vote, a Commonwealth Edison spokesman said the utility would withdraw its proposal rather than face audits of the plants' costs. 
"We felt that audits we had seen in other parts of the country resulted in tremendous disallowances bordering on the punitive and we could have seen our rock-bottom cost figure badly undercut," the utility spokesman said. 

   Following the vote the spokesman said it is "conceivable" Commonwealth Edison would give ground on the audit issue. 

   The commission's decision leaves Commonwealth Edison with an investment of $7.1 billion in the three nuclear plants and no immediate way to pay for them. 
The Byron plant is already operating, and Commonwealth Edison expects to begin full commercial operation of Braidwood 1 in September. 
Braidwood 2 is 95% complete. 
Opponents of the plants say they are too expensive and aren't necessary to meet the current power demands on Commonwealth Edison. 

   The company said it would ask for an immediate rate increase of at least 27%, or $1.2 billion, if the commission doesn't reverse its vote in a rehearing. 
The commission would have as long as 11 months to consider such a request. 
The utility's spokesman said it is costing the company about $60 million a month to pay the carrying costs on its investment. 

   The commission's rejection is the second recent major setback for Commonwealth Edison's nuclear program. 
Last month, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that state regulators had to reconsider a $495 million rate increase the commission granted the utility in 1984 to cover the cost of its Byron 1 nuclear plant. 
The court ordered the commission to re-audit the $2.7 billion plant and refund any unnecessary costs to Commonwealth Edison's customers. 

   Several commissioners said yesterday that the state Supreme Court's order compelled them to reject Commonwealth Edison's latest proposal because it would have eliminated audits of the Byron and Braidwood plants. 
Commissioners worry that would have left the plan subject to future reversal by the courts. 
Meg Bushnell, chairman of the commission, said the utility's plan was "fatally flawed." 

   Industry experts had hailed Commonwealth Edison's plan as a major step toward deregulation of the electric utility industry. 
Under the plan the utility could have spun off the subsidiary after five years, leaving it as an independent operating company that could sell power on the open market. 

   During the initial five years, Commonwealth Edison had pledged to buy back the power generated by the nuclear subsidiary for a fee of $600 million plus the units' generating costs. 
Commonwealth Edison shareholders would realize the profits produced by the subsidiary. 
The plan would also transfer regulation of the plants from Illinois to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Some industry experts say federal regulators are generally less harsh than those at the state level. 

   Industry analysts disagreed about the potential effect of the commission's decision on Commonwealth Edison. 
"Edison's stock will go down and the cost of its funds will go up," but the utility is large enough to absorb any financial shock from the commission's vote, said Mark D. Luftig, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. 
But Thomas Halligan, an analyst for Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago, said that if the utility is ultimately forced to take large write-offs on its nuclear plants, it might affect its dividend.
