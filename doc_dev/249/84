<TEXT>     "I want to go to Fremont and be a star!";   It might have been. What did
Hollywood have that Fremont didn't in the early 1900s?;   Sheep.;   When
proto-moguls realized that New Jersey -- home of Thomas Edison's lab -- didn't
have the greatest climate, they headed west in search of sunny weather --
outdoor shooting was a lot cheaper than building sets -- and varied terrain.; 
 Niles, now part of Fremont, was one of the first California film sites.
Essanay  Film Manufacturing Co., founded by Gilbert "Broncho  Billy" Anderson
and George K. Spoor, made movies in Niles from 1912 to 1916.;   The 12- to
15-minute "Broncho  Billy" westerns, shot in rugged Niles Canyon where the
outlaw Joaquin Murieta once rode, were the studio's staple. Wallace Beery,
Marie Dressler and comic Ben Turpin also made films in Niles, but the star was
Charlie Chaplin, who tramped from Essanay's chilly Chicago studio to Niles in
1915 to shoot The Bank, The Champion, A Woman, A Night Out, Shanghaied, and
his classic, The Tramp.;   His Little Tramp character is said to have been
inspired by hobos who passed through Niles, a Southern Pacific junction.;  
"Chaplin didn't like it here," says Sherry Nighswonger, chair of the Mission
Peak Heritage Foundation. "I suspect there was not enough night life for him.
It was much too quiet.";   Chaplin's contract was for only a year -- they made
movies quickly in those days -- and in 1916 he went south to a rival film
capital.;   Hollywood had been founded in 1887 as a temperance colony. The
first movie studio opened in 1911. At the time it was "discovered," the
population was under 5,000, writes W.H. Hutchinson, in California: The Golden
State by the Sundown Sea, and there was a law against driving more than 2,000
sheep at a time down what became Hollywood Boulevard.;   Hollywood had a good
climate, but so did Niles. Perhaps Hollywood's advantage, Hutchinson
speculates, was its proximity to the Mexican border, convenient for when
creditors showed up.;   At any rate, Fremont never did become a center for
glitter, glamour and cinematic glory.;   It's all the more unfair because
moving pictures got their start just across the bay at Leland Stanford's farm.
In 1872, Stanford hired Eadweard Muybridge to win his bet that a trotting
horse has all four legs off the ground at one point.;   Muybridge had to take
time off to go on trial for killing his wife's lover. He got back to work in
1877 with a super-fast shutter and 24 cameras, set up to be tripped by the
horse's hooves. By projecting the pictures in rapid succession with his
zooproxiscope, Muybridge won Stanford's bet and invented moving pictures.;  
Fremont occasionally relives its old movie days. More American Graffiti,
released in 1979, used an old raceway; The King of Love turned the Fremont
Civic Center into the headquarters/house of a media mogul with a fondness for
concrete. And Arnold Schwarzenegger filmed the "Cyberdyne" scenes of
Terminator 2 in the Warm Springs area of Fremont. Look for the
motorcycle-helicopter escape.;   Broncho Billy rides again!  </TEXT>
