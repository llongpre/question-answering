   Homer Simpson, the boneheaded cartoon
dad on TV's ``The Simpsons'' may be the nation's best-known nuclear
plant worker, and he has a solid core of fans at the San Onofre
Nuclear Generating Station.
   Homer is to San Onofre employees what Jackie Gleason was to bus
drivers when ``The Honeymooners'' show was big _ someone in their
shoes but whose shoes they would hate to be in.
   ``Homer is my hero. He could work here,'' San Onofre engineer Al
Meichler said last week.
   ``Homer sounds like a candidate for upper management,'' said
Richard Rice, a nuclear chemistry foreman.
   Maintenance machinist Pat Daugherty added: ``In the protected
area, there's about five guys in there just like him.''
   But Southern California Edison Co., which owns the plant on the
San Diego County coast, says Homer wouldn't qualify.
   ``The people we hire are pretty high-quality in terms of
intellectual ability,'' said Edison spokesman Dave Barron. ``Homer
Simpson couldn't get a job anywhere near here.''

   Carol Jong wanted to leave an indelible
mark on the University of Kansas.
   So she did it seven times.
   In its 103rd edition, the university's 1990 yearbook features
photos of Jong in seven different looks.
   Not under the same name, of course.
   There's Buffi J. Baker in business. Or Bertha Heffer in
engineering. Even Violet Couleur in fine arts.
   Going the extra mile, try Anne (U.) Rissom in allied health. And
Dorrie N. Collum in architecture.
   Some of the aliases were tailor-made for particular schools
while others ``just fit the stereotypes,'' Ms. Jong said.
   Ms. Jong's roommate tried to join in the prank, submitting fake
photos, but all her fakes were rejected from the yearbook, the
Jayhawker.
   ``We wanted to leave our mark at K.U.,'' said Ms. Jong, who's
graduating this year with a liberal arts degree. ``Since we're not
athletes or student presidents or anything, we wanted to be
remembered for something special.''
   The Jayhawker staff wasn't amused.
   ``I mean, it's a great joke as far as she's concerned,'' said
Jeannine Kreker, assistant editor. ``But as far as Kansas alumni
and everybody who's going to look at this book years from now is
concerned, it makes us and the university look pretty silly.''
   Not all of Ms. Jong's fakes made it: There's no Penny Sylan in
pharmacy.

   The staff at the West Overton Museum
didn't think people would miss it when they retired one of the
oddities on display _ a two-headed calf.
   The heads, mounted on a board after the calf was born in 1922,
had been displayed from 1930 to 1987 at the museum, which
specializes in exhibits of farm and industrial implements used in
southwestern Pennsylvania.
   Over the years, the relic was popular with museum-goers,
especially children who passed by other industrial and agricultural
artifacts to gape.
   Still, the staff didn't think anyone would notice when the head
was taken down and stored because it was deteriorating, said
Kimberly Bringe, the museum's director.
   They were wrong. Parents who had seen the calf as children
repeatedly asked about it and several people offered to buy the
piece.
   ``I think people are naturally attracted to oddities,'' Ms.
Bringe said. She had the display reconditioned by a taxidermist,
and it was put up for the museum's summer season opening Tuesday.
   ``It's like a shrine,'' said Ms. Bringe. ``I call it the divine
bovine.''
