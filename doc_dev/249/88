<LEADPARA>  SILICON VALSPEAK GAGS ME WITH NO spoons, it is true, but even in the digital
speech of electrical engineers there flowers the creativity of a profession
that is naming new things.;    "Bit" was born in a lunchtime conversation at
Bell Labs, says Robert W. Lucky, in Silicon Dreams. Statistician John Tukey
melded binary and digit to describe an either/or sort of thing, either one or
zero, that resolves a binary choice. Eight bits are a "byte," the basic unit
of computer storage. Half a byte is a "nibble."  </LEADPARA>

THE ORIGINAL ''BUG'' MAY HAVE BEEN A MOTH
IN THE SYSTEM.  </HEADLINE>

JOANNE JACOBS is a Mercury News columnist.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Some believe "bug" is among the many inventions of Thomas Edison, who used
it in 1878 to refer to the "little faults and difficulties" in a design.;   
On the other hand, Alan Freedman, in The Computer Glossary, says "bug" came
into usage "in the 1940s when a moth was found squashed between the points of
an electromechanical relay in the Mark 1," becoming the original bug in the
system.;    A euphemistic bug is an "undocumented feature.";    Now techtalk
is infested with biological metaphors. There are worms and viruses. A "mouse"
controls many computers. The unit of mouse movement, 1/200th of an inch, is
said to be a "mickey.";    For technical humans, there are many terms, most of
them derogatory.;    "Nerd" is said to have been first used in Dr. Seuss's If
I Ran the Zoo, though some claim it was originally "drunk" spelled backward.; 
  "Wonk" is "know" backward. Linguists will note that the voiced "k" in drunk
becomes silent in knurd/nerd, while the silent "k" in know becomes voiced when
reversed in "wonk.";    "Dweeb" also may be a case of linguistic sound shift.
Mercury News computer editor Rory O'Connor speculates that "dweeb" is a
variation of "gweep," the East Coast term for a computer enthusiast, which
came from the sound made by early computer keyboards.;    A "hacker" hacks
around, as does a "bit twiddler" and a "propeller head." Both presumably dream
of "droupies," which Freedman claims refers to a "data groupie: a person who
likes to spend time in the company of programmers and data-processing
professionals." I think he's kidding.;    At any rate, if she's got a
"micromini," it's not a skirt.;    Much of the language is built on analogies:
The machinery was hardware, so the programs became software, and memory chips
that did a bit of both became firmware. Free software is shareware. Products
enthusiastically described in press releases that don't actually exist are
vaporware. This may seem confusing, but it's easy enough if you use your
wetware.;    "Boot" comes from "bootstrap," as in "pulling yourself up by your
bootstraps," or getting the computer started.;    Locations of data travel
from the processor to memory via "address bus.";    When you send an angry
message by "e-mail" (electronic mail), your heated views are a "flame.";   
There are also abbreviations.;    GIGO is a profound bit of silicon lingo.
Garbage in, garbage out: If your data is lousy, crunching it won't help.;   
"Modem" is a MOdulator/DEModulator, which modulates the computer's electronic
pulses into sound waves then demodulates them back to electronic pulses so
your computers can chat over phone lines.;    Ultimately, silicon slang is a
sort of virus, infecting the wetware of all who interface with it. Pretty soon
you "crash" just like the computer system, go home and "download" to your
spouse or dog. Asked what you did during your weekend "downtime," you do a
"core dump" till your user, that is, listener, looks for an exit, graceful or
otherwise.  </TEXT>
