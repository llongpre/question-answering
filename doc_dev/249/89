   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In a town where the likes of Thomas Alva Edison
and Guglielmo Marconi once worked, a town that helped perfect the
radio and was home to New York's first regularly licensed radio
station, the message is the medium. Just ask members of the Antique
Radio Club in Schenectady, N.Y., one of about 30 such groups around
the world.

   The members of the Antique Radio Club
aren't very impressed with a fancy computer during ``Show and
Tell,'' even if the palm-sized gadget does decipher Morse code at
the speed of light.
   But when someone starts passing around a set of stained,
yellowed photographs from 1915 depicting one of Schenectady's first
amateur radio stations, a buzz of animated conversation fills the
cramped basement where they are meeting.
   This is, after all, something the 15 radio buffs, most
considerably advanced in age, can understand. Tenderly thumbing the
pictures, Carmin Baker wrinkles his brow and smiles.
   ``Back then, it was kind of a prestige thing to know, hey, the
guy next door is a radio ham,'' Baker says. ``We used to try to
hang around him because we were interested in that kind of stuff.''
   The other silver-haired radio aficionados nod their heads.
They've obviously come here to ``get together with the other guys
and see what they got and talk,'' as one member says.
   The Schenectady club, affiliated with the Rochester-based
Antique Wireless Association, is one of about 30 scattered around
the world, according to Bruce Kelley, the curator of the
association's museum. All together, there are about 10,000 antique
or historical radio collectors, mostly in New York state, and of
those 300 are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission to
transmit on the rare radios, Kelley says.
   However, there's something about the Schenectady organization
that suggests it's kind of special.
   ``I built Langmuir's personal hi-fi set for him,'' blurts out
Robert Thayer, 73, referring to the Nobel Prize-winning chemist
Irving Langmuir. ``I put round knobs on the thing and he went
crazy. He couldn't have a round knob. He wanted a pointer on there
and he wanted to know where every one of the things was set. He
didn't care how loud it was, but he wanted to know where that
pointer was!''
   The memories come rushing back to these proud veterans of an era
half a century ago when Schenectady, then home to the General
Electric and American Locomotive companies, unabashedly called
itself ``the city that hauls and lights the world.''
   They talk excitedly about an ``intellectualism'' that once
permeated the ``Electric City,'' located on the banks of the Mohawk
River 15 miles northwest of Albany. Thomas Alva Edison started it
all when he established his machine works in 1886, they say. Six
years later, the two nondescript brick buildings would become GE.
   Besides jobs and prosperity, GE infused a much-needed dose of
self-respect into a town that had too often been the butt of cruel
jokes. The thankfully forgotten song, ``I Can't Spell
Schenectady,'' didn't seem fair to a thriving metropolis that had a
lively downtown, huge department stores and a citizenry that
included scientists such as Guglielmo Marconi.
   ``Schenectady was a nice place to live back in the '20s. One of
the nicest cities in the country,'' boasted club chairman Fay
Eckert. ``Well, they had the Erie Canal here for one thing, up to a
point, anyway, which made it interesting. And it was such a clean
city.''
   But all this was before GE pulled out of the radio production
business after World War II, quickly reducing its work force in
Schenectady from a wartime high of 45,000 to 12,000. Many of the
folks swapping memories at this reunion were among those thousands
laid off.
   Twenty years later, the locomotive company folded, giving a coup
de grace to what had been a long downward spiral.
   ``Now, nobody comes to Schenectady anymore,'' grumbles Francis
Emrich, a private radio operator for 42 years.
   Baker's insistent voice rises above the din: ``When I was a
young man, everybody got out of college, went down to GE and got a
job in the testing department.''
   That's why he, like most of the others, started working for GE
in 1940, earning 35 cents an hour on an assembly line.
   This was a time when Schenectady breathed, ate and drank radio
technology, Emrich remembers. The city's skyline bristled with the
antennae of ``hm'' radio operators. As a matter of fact, Emrich
says, GE used to give away tubes and other paraphernalia to hams,
until unscrupulous individuals began to steal the stuff.
   Emrich's a purist, which means he won't use anything but genuine
parts in his antique radio transmitters. So, many times, he's had
to search in some pretty odd places for spare parts.
   It seems natural to these people that New York's first regularly
licensed radio station, WGY, which first broadcast in February
1922, was started by GE in Schenectady. Television, also largely
developed by GE, soon followed in 1939. If necessity was the mother
of invention, then GE was the doctor who performed the delivery.
   ``One thing about GE, their minds were always working down there
to improve things,'' Emrich says.
   Jack Nelson, considered the club's patriarch because he reported
to work for GE back in 1928, stands up to announce that the widow
of a former friend and club supporter is having a garage sale. Lots
of old radio equipment will be available.
   The old radios the members avidly collect and lovingly restore
are becoming scarce, such as the 1924 Westinghouse Nelson keeps in
his cluttered cellar. Or the 1930s Atwater Kent that a beaming Ed
Farrell showed off in the back of his van at the club's flea market
before the meeting.
   ``The thing is, when we were kids, a kid that was just mildly
interested in radio could take a crystal and a pair of earphones
and some wire and make it work,'' says Thayer, his fingers wrapped
around an odd-looking 1936 GE metal tube that he uses as a gavel.
``Now, everything is so terrifically complicated that a kid has to
be terrifically interested to get into it. He can't just start with
a simple thing and work up.''
   Radios, especially antique ones, are fetching high prices also,
so much so that Eckert now calls collecting ``a rich man's hobby.''
   He leaps at the chance to give an example: A 25-tube Zenith
Stratosphere from 1939, a luxury radio that stands 5-feet tall and
probably cost $900 then, was recently auctioned for $8,000 in
Georgia.
   Eckert's own 33-tube E.H. Scott radio from 1940-41, which he
calls the ``Rolls Royce'' of radios, fetched a price of $350 back
then and now is worth about $750.
   ``But,'' he admits, ``it's not in mint condition.''
