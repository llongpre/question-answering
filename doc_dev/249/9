   It's a story fit for the movies.
   Two of this country's greatest inventors, George Eastman and
Thomas Edison, got together one day to discuss the motion picture
industry they were helping create.
   Eastman already had invented the process to make long rolls of
film and Edison had patented his movie camera. Both were comparing
notes and seeking refinements.
   At one point, Eastman, founder of the Eastman Kodak Co.,
supposedly asked Edison how wide the camera film should be. Edison,
holding thumb and forefinger about an inch apart, said, ``About so
wide.''
   That width, 1] inches, better known as 35mm, became and remains
the standard size for the black celluloid that's been used for a
century to hold the dramas, comedies and happy endings that appear
on the silver screen.
   Who knows if the story is true. It's been told so many times,
altered and edited, that it's impossible to determine exactly when
or even if the conversation occurred, said Kodak spokesman Henry
Kaska.
   ``You just have to say, `Legend has it ...,''' Kaska said.
   This year Kodak is celebrating its 100th anniversary making movie
film, which in terms of miles manufactured is the photo giant's
leading film product.
   ``1889 is the year we sold our first length of motion picture
film _ to Thomas Edison, that much we're sure of,'' Kaska said.
   Edison opened a production company and released 5,000 movie
titles _ shorts of vaudeville acts or boxing matches _ by 1900. He
is credited with starting the entertainment form.
   Kodak always has maintained a subtle role in the movie business,
supplying generations of filmmakers, from pioneers like Edwin S.
Porter, D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille to today's kingpins like
Stephen Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola.
   For many years, Kodak was the only practical supplier of film to
the burgeoning industry and today the company still dominates.
   Its low profile dates to the days of Eastman, who refused to
enter the movie production business and insisted on accepting cash
in advance for movie film, never a share of profits.
   ``George Eastman didn't trust filmmakers. If a film lost money,
he didn't want to lose with it,'' said Chris Horak, curator of film
at the International Museum of Photography in Rochester, where Kodak
is based.
   Moviemakers constantly visited the company offering a percentage
of their profits to Kodak in exchange for free film, but always have
been rejected.
   That policy remains in effect.
   Horak said the no-free-film rule also applies to a Kodak program
that supports young filmmakers who can't afford to buy film.
   ``They give them money and tell them to buy the film,'' Horak
said.
   Kodak's movie division also maintains a low profile within the
company because the division generates about $350 million a year in
sales, a fraction of the company's $17 billion in annual sales.
   Nonetheless, Kodak remains the overwhelming favorite among
moviemakers worldwide, said Jean Turner, associate editor of
American Cinematographer.
   The magazine, published by the American Society of
Cinematographers, has been interviewing moviemakers for 70 years and
nearly all have said they use Kodak film.
   ``We do 12 issues a year and talk to at least three
cinematographers in each issue. I would say we usually find one or
two that don't use Kodak film. In 1988, we didn't have anyone,''
Turner said.
   Horak said without Kodak in the early 1900s, there wouldn't have
been a thriving movie business. Today Kodak is by far the leading
seller of all movie film in America, although Fuji Photofilm Co., of
Japan, and Agfa-Gevaert AG, of West Germany, have started winning
acceptance.
   ``The foreign film has gained in quality over the past couple of
years and as a result I think more people are starting to think
about using it,'' said Fred Austin, vice president of Deluxe
Laboratories Inc. in Hollywood, Calif.
   DeLuxe printed about half of all the Hollywood movies last year,
and Austin said about 80 percent of the film it uses is Kodak-made.
   Fuji and Agfa films are attractive, Austin said, because a studio
can usually get a discount by buying a certain amount of film, a
practice Kodak refuses to offer.
   So, while filmmakers may insist on using Kodak film to shoot
movies, a studio may insist on another film to make the 1,000 copies
sent to movie theaters worldwide.
   ``More and more over the years, it's the bottom line that
counts,'' said Austin.
   There are primarily two kinds of movie film: negative film, used
in the camera when a movie is shot; and print film, which runs
through a theater screen projector.
   The moviemaking process is identical to taking camera
photographs, involving a negative converted to a print.
   The average movie, at 90 feet of film a minute, is about about
90,000 to 120,000 feet long. However, much more is used en route to
the final product.
   Kodak estimates filmmakers use at least 20 times more negative
film than the finished product requires, which means an average
movie might use 1.8 million feet of film.
   If 1,000 prints are needed, a studio must buy 90 million feet of
print film.
   Kodak sells its most popular negative film in a 400-foot roll
priced at about 34 cents a foot. Its most popular print film comes
in a 4,000-foot roll costing about 6 cents a foot.
   Fuji sells its most versatile negative film for about 31 cents a
foot.
   Increased competition may be one reason Kodak is blowing its horn
about its long history in movies.
   Although the company has won five Oscars, three Emmys and two
special scientific awards for technical breakthroughs in the movie
industry, Kodak still feels a little taken for granted, company
officials said.
   Kodak's role in the movie business is not unlike Texaco's or
Mobil's role in the automobile industry, said Joerge Agin, vice
president and general manager of Kodak's Motion Picture and
Audiovisual Products Division.
