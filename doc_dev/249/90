DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Even though our son has always been encouraged and has never 
(as far as we know) been made to feel strange or inferior because he's 
left-handed, he still makes comments about it and wishes he were right-handed. 
Since he's 19 and an excellent student who seems to be adjusted in other ways, 
we're wondering if he'll ever accept this condition. -- A.Y. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR A.Y.: There's no doubt about it that, in a world designed primarily for 
right-handed people, lefties can often feel they're getting a raw deal or that 
they've been treated unfairly. However, most adjust very well and consider it a 
minor irritation. 
</P>
<P>
You might remind your son that many people who have made lasting contributions 
in many different fields have been lefties. Michelangelo, Babe Ruth, Thomas 
Edison, Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci, Paul Klee, Cole Porter, Charlie Chaplin, 
Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, even Paul McCartney, Sandy Koufax and Jimi 
Hendrix were all left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
It's important for all children to be taught that it's all right to be a little 
different. In some way, each of us is unique and this is one of the many things 
that helps to make the world a better and more interesting place in which to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My son is 5 years old and my husband feels there's no reason 
to tell him about the possibility of having a baby sister or brother. Since our 
son will be at my mother's for the last few months of my pregnancy, my husband 
thinks our little boy would have a better time on his holiday if he didn't 
know. Is there anything wrong with letting the new baby be a surprise? -- H.S. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR H.S.: Yes, there's really a lot wrong with this idea. First of all, 
children have a great need for predictability in their lives. Youngsters are 
amazingly resilient if they know what to expect and if they're properly 
prepared well in advance. Your son has been the center of attention for some 
time and he's now going to have to learn to share the spotlight. This will 
present much less of a problem if you let him know that he'll soon be a big 
brother and encourage him to be an important part of the planning for this new 
addition. 
</P>
<P>
Talk with your son about what he was like as an infant, for this will help him 
to empathize and identify. Once the baby has arrived, make sure you talk with 
your son not only about his feelings but also about how he thinks the baby 
feels. Let your son take part in preparing the baby's room and planning in the 
care and feeding. 
</P>
<P>
I think it would be a good idea if your son could return a short time before 
the birth of this baby. The more he's included, the less likelihood for sibling 
rivalry later.
