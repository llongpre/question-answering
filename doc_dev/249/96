   Centerior Energy Corp. presented a $1 billion facilities sale and lease-back plan to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio as part of a cost-reduction effort intended to preserve the company's dividend. 

   Under the plan, the electric utility holding company's two operating subsidiaries would sell and lease back their 32.3% interest in the Bruce Mansfield coal-fired generating plant. 
They would also sell and lease back "an as-yet undetermined portion" of their 44% interest in the second unit of the Beaver Valley nuclear generating plant, which is scheduled to go into operation later this year. 
Both facilities are near Pittsburgh. 

   The commission didn't issue a statement at the close of yesterday's hearing, but Thomas V. Chema, chairman, said he was impressed by "the creative thinking" involved in the Centerior proposal that would reduce the operating companies' future rate increases by $35 million. 
The commission previously questioned whether Centerior's quarterly dividend rate of 64 cents was appropriate when one of its subsidiaries, Toledo Edison Co., was having financial difficulty and had requested emergency rate increases in 1985 and earlier this year. 

   Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., the other utility merged to form Centerior last year, is also seeking sizable rate increases. 
And both utilities will be requesting additional large increases when the Beaver Valley unit and the first unit of Perry, a nuclear plant 35 miles east of Cleveland scheduled to go on stream this year, are added to the rate base. 

   The commission is under political pressure to hold down rate increases by the utilities, in part because of opposition to the nuclear plants. 
Some consumer groups allege that the plants weren't needed, and that money was wasted during their construction. 

   Centerior said no buyers for the facilities have been lined up but said its investment bankers, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., assured the company that there is a market for them. 
The transaction would be completed in September or October, Centerior said. 

   The sale and lease-back of electric plants is a relatively new utility financing approach, but a number of such transactions have been completed in the past year or so. 
Centerior said the largest previous sale-lease-back financing was $850 million by Tucson Electric Power Co. 

   Centerior gets almost all its income through dividends from Toledo Edison and CEI. 
Should the public utilities commission require Toledo Edison and CEI to reduce their dividends as a condition for future rate increases, it would force a reduction in Centerior's dividend. 

   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Centerior shares closed at $16.125, up 62.5 cents. 

   Centerior officials previously said they intended to continue paying the 64-cent quarterly dividend, even though its component utilities are running a negative cash flow. 
The company expects Toledo Edison and CEI to obtain rate increases later this year and in 1988 that would give them a positive cash flow. 

   The commission last month granted Toledo Edison a $43 million emergency rate increase, but said it would hold a hearing on dividend policy, and other matters, before Toledo Edison's board considers its next dividend payment to its parent. 

   The two utilities have rate requests pending totaling $263 million, but the $43 emergency increase granted to Toledo Edison would be deducted from any increase permitted under those applications. 

   Centerior had 1986 net income of $391.9 million, or $3.04 a share, on revenue of $1.92 billion. 
However, all of the net income stemmed from a bookkeeping device used to recognize investment in facilities under construction, which is not a source of cash. 

   A commission official estimated that CEI and Toledo Edison probably will require rate increases of about 10% a year for each of the next three years, even with the sale and lease-back plan. 
Those increases, which wouldn't be effective until at least 1988, would be in addition to the $263 million of pending rate increase requests.
