Southern California Edison's proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric 
would save the utilities $1.7 billion during the next decade, according to 
documents the two utilities have filed with the state Public Utilities 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E and Edison repeated their previous assertion that only 1,000 jobs 
would be lost after the proposed merger that would create the nation's largest 
gas and electric utility. However, the filing suggested for the first time that 
1,700 more employees probably will be transferred if the merger occurs. Edison 
Vice President Michael R. Peevey on Monday said it is too early to say which 
employees would face transfer. 
</P>
<P>
According to the filings made Friday, 693 management personnel would lose jobs 
because of the merger. An additional 305 employees in customer service would 
lose jobs and 118 "power supply" employees would lose their jobs. Also, the 
filing acknowledges that "it is still possible, however, that additional 
reductions may be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counter to Testimony 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E and Edison have maintained that the 1,000 jobs to be eliminated would 
be spread between the two companies. However, that explanation runs counter to 
recent testimony by a pair of former SDG&amp;E board members who suggested that 
SDG&amp;E alone stands to lose 1,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at both utilities maintained that the merger would lead to lower 
electric rates for the new company's 4.8 million customers, improved service, a 
more reliable electric supply and reduced air pollution. "The merged companies 
will be a stronger, more efficient utility, with a diversified power supply and 
fuel mix," according to the documents, which were filed late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The joint filing -- an 8-inch-thick collection of documents -- provided the 
first comprehensive analysis of how the combined company would operate. The PUC 
will use the complex and wide-ranging document during its upcoming review of 
the merger. 
</P>
<P>
The filing drew immediate criticism from environmentalists, consumer groups and 
politicians in San Diego, who have opposed the proposed merger since it was 
announced Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The filing "seemed to ignore a lot of the concerns raised by us and other San 
Diegans," said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action 
Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. "They tried to put a nice window 
dressing (on the proposed merger), but there's still nothing that makes me 
think that this is a good deal for San Diego residents." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor remained unimpressed by the utilities' 
repeated promise of immediate rate reductions after a merger. "I say big deal. 
. . . We're talking about the utility rates of this city for a lifetime," 
O'Connor said. The promise of an immediate rate decrease "does not matter . . . 
that's just another example of them putting out a little tiny carrot so they 
can get the whole ball of wax," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigations Urged 
</P>
<P>
Peevey on Monday defended the proposed rate reductions as "clear and immediate 
recognition that there are benefits" for San Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
According to the filing, SDG&amp;E Chairman Tom Page -- who at first opposed 
the proposed merger -- now believes it is "questionable" whether SDG&amp;E 
could continue to meet San Diego County's increased demand for electricity 
without a merger partner. Standing alone, SDG&amp;E "could return to the 
dilemma of the 1970s -- over-reliance on oil and gas generation," according to 
Page. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, a state senator called for three separate investigations of 
allegations that SDG&amp;E board members were improperly influenced by Edison 
before they voted to sell the utility. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego) asked Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, San 
Diego County Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, and the San Diego County Grand Jury to 
examine the charges, leveled earlier this month by two former SDG&amp;E board 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The former directors, Charles (Red) Scott and O. Morris Sievert, said in sworn 
depositions that SCEcorp, Edison's parent company, approached several SDG&amp;E 
directors about seats on the SCEcorp board of directors during merger 
negotiations between the two companies last year. 
</P>
<P>
Scott described the offers as "bribes" and said he believes they must have 
influenced the judgment of his fellow SDG&amp;E directors. 
</P>
<P>
Edison and SDG&amp;E officials have said the offers were legal and normal for 
two companies negotiating a merger. The investigative agencies queried by 
Stirling could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The utilities' detailed filing also acknowledged that Edison gave consideration 
to seeking PUC approval to share the anticipated cost savings between 
shareholders and customers. However, Edison abandoned that controversial 
proposal because it "would divert attention from the substantial benefits 
ratepayers will receive," according to testimony by Edison Executive Vice 
President John E. Bryson. 
</P>
<P>
"We are (now) confident that, over the long run, our shareholders will benefit 
from the strengthening of our core utility business through the merger," 
according to Bryson. 
</P>
<P>
The utilities also relied heavily upon what critics in the past have labeled 
"celebrity witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
James S. Schlesinger, former secretary of the U. S. Department of Energy, 
endorsed the proposed merger as a "sensible and worthwhile step" that will 
"yield real benefits, especially over time." 
</P>
<P>
Edison and SDG&amp;E also solicited favorable testimony from Ernest S. Liu, a 
general partner with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., a New York-based investment 
firm. Lee C. White, formerly chairman of the Federal Power Commission and a 
past president of the Consumer Energy Council of America, was hired to testify 
about the merger's effect on consumers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Celebrity Witness 
</P>
<P>
The merger also won praise from Lee M. Thomas, who served as administrator of 
the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency during the last half of the Reagan 
Administration. Thomas said the proposed merger's environmental impact seems to 
be "consistent with the objectives of achieving long-term, stable improvements 
in air quality for Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
The merger would improve air quality in San Diego because the combined company 
would cut back on the use of older oil- and gas-fired electrical power plants 
in San Diego County, according to Thomas. The former EPA administrator also 
suggested that air quality in the Los Angeles area would be improved with or 
without a merger, largely because of tough new restrictions recently proposed 
by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Shames also scored the utilities' promise to seek a 10% rate decrease for 
SDG&amp;E's residential customers and a 5% rate cut for the San Diego-based 
utility's commercial and agricultural customers. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were in Los Angeles, I'd be protesting the proposed 5% to 10% rate 
decreases promised for San Diegans," Shames said. "It means that (Edison 
customers) will be subsidizing SDG&amp;E rate cuts for a promise that they'll 
get something back in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Shames also contended that the PUC probably would ignore the proposed rate 
decreases for San Diegans because "the law states that you can't . . . 
discriminate and charge different rates in different service territories." 
</P>
<P>
The joint filing contradicted a pessimistic report by San Diego's Air Pollution 
Control District, which predicted a massive increase in pollution following the 
conclusion for a merger. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Berg, a South Coast Air Quality Management District board member, said: 
"Our major concern is that (a merger) is really dealing with emissions 
throughout Southern California. What (Edison) does in San Diego has an impact 
on us up here and vice versa." Berg is chairman of the University of Southern 
California's Institute of Politics and Government. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of SDG&amp;E and SCEcorp, Edison's Rosemead-based parent company, 
are expected to approve the proposed merger at meetings this week. 
</P>
<P>
The merger also must be approved by a handful of regulatory agencies, including 
the state PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Opposition to the 
proposed merger has been intense in San Diego since SDG&amp;E's board of 
directors voted Nov. 30 to accept SCEcorp's $2.4-billion stock swap merger.
