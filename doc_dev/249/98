San Diego Gas &amp; Electric will try to keep O. Morris Sievert, a San Diego 
businessman who in December resigned from SDG&amp;E's board of directors, from 
discussing the utility's proposed merger with Southern California Edison during 
a Wednesday deposition requested by the city of San Diego, according to 
documents filed with state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
According to those documents, SDG&amp;E wants to prevent Sievert, who resigned 
to protest the proposed utility merger, from making public a long list of 
documents that SDG&amp;E's board generated while considering the proposed 
merger with Edison. The utility's New York-based law firm last month asked the 
state Public Utilities Commission to prohibit Sievert from making the documents 
public during Wednesday's deposition. 
</P>
<P>
Sievert last week told the PUC that he has "no personal objection" to making 
public dozens of documents that he collected during the past year because full 
disclosure of the documents would lead to "a full public hearing on the 
proposed merger." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sievert Argument 
</P>
<P>
Public concern in San Diego County over the proposed merger "appears to 
outweigh any interest in maintaining the 'confidential' or 'privileged' status 
of the documents in question," according to Sievert's filing. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E spokesman Tom Murnane declined Monday to comment on SDG&amp;E's 
request for a protective order, saying, "We will not comment on that until the 
day of the deposition. During the deposition, we will discuss our objections in 
detail." 
</P>
<P>
"SDG&amp;E is doing a fine job of trying to keep the city and the public from 
learning anything about this merger," San Diego City Atty. John Witt said 
Monday. "We're taking the position that this stuff should be handled publicly . 
. . and we're going to get this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The documents filed last week by Sievert's attorney include an extensive list 
of records generated by meetings that SDG&amp;E's board held to consider 
Edison's proposed stock-swap merger. The list also includes records that detail 
the SDG&amp;E board meetings held to discuss an ill-fated attempt to complete a 
merger with Tucson Electric Power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Management Documents 
</P>
<P>
Sievert also hopes to introduce personal documents that SDG&amp;E Chairman 
Thomas Page and other SDG&amp;E executives and directors have maintained since 
Edison proposed the merger. 
</P>
<P>
The large number of documents that Sievert plans to introduce "is very 
telling," according to Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers 
Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. "It showed that there are 
huge numbers of documents that have not been seen by the interested parties. It 
also proves that (the board's) discussion about this merger was contentious and 
long-ranging." 
</P>
<P>
The city has subpoenaed Sievert to learn if Edison and SCEcorp, Edison's parent 
company, coerced or threatened SDG&amp;E's board members in order to gain 
support for the proposed merger. SDG&amp;E's board voted to accept the merger 
offer in November, 1988. Shareholders of the two utilities will vote on the 
merger later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Similar issues are expected to surface Monday, when the city attempts to gather 
testimony from businessman Charles (Red) Scott, who also resigned from the 
SDG&amp;E board in protest of the merger.
