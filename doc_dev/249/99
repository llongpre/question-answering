   James R. Houghton is known as the king of quality control and joint venture agreements. 
But the chief executive officer of Corning Glass Works has never been considered a takeover tough guy. 

   Ever since SmithKline Beckman Corp. made its surprise bid to acquire International Clinical Laboratories Inc. out from under Corning, that's the challenge the gentlemanly Mr. Houghton faces. 

   Corning, eager to expand its medical business, had a definitive agreement to acquire the laboratory testing concern for $26 a share, when SmithKline stepped in last week with a $32-a-share late-entry bid. 
And days later when Corning raised its bid to $35, SmithKline quickly boosted its hostile offer to $37 a share, or $400 million. 

   Such poker tactics are out of character for the 51-year-old Mr. Houghton -- and industry executives and analysts wonder whether he's willing or able to persist. 
Corning has "never been involved in an acquisition competition," says Charles Ryan of Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner Smith. 
Adds an industry analyst: "The crucial point in bidding wars is personality, and Houghton isn't used to this kind of thing." 

   Indeed, Mr. Houghton never even had to fight his way up the corporate ladder. 
His great-great-grandfather founded Corning in 1851, and he joined the maker of specialty glass, consumer housewares, telecommunications and medical products straight out of Harvard Business School. 
The fifth generation of his family to run Corning, he inherited the chief executive and chairman's office five years ago when his brother resigned to become a congressman. 
"He wants Corning to be a good place for his family for years to come," says Philip Goodman of Duff &amp; Phelps &amp; Co., Chicago. 
That's why "they're not as likely (as SmithKline) to go out on a limb" to acquire International Clinical Laboratories, even though it's one of the few remaining major U.S. laboratories. 

   The acquisition of International Clinical would significantly boost Corning's market presence in the fast-growing drug and medical testing business, doubling the size of its MetPath Laboratory operation. 
MetPath is one of several health and science businesses that Corning expanded through acquisitions and joint ventures. 
Corning also owns Hazelton Labs, which provides biological and chemical research, and is a 50% partner in Ciba-Corning Diagnostics Corp., a joint venture that makes blood-gas and chemical testing analyzers. 

   But Corning is best known for consumer products such as Steuben crystal and the Corning, Corelle and Pyrex brand of housewares. 
It is often described as a research-driven company that made the light bulb for Thomas Edison and invented such products as fiberglass, silicone, certain optical fibers and the TV picture tube. 

   Mr. Houghton, who insists on informality and prefers that employees call him "Jamie," has been traveling abroad through most of this battle and declined yesterday in New York to be interviewed. 

   Associates at the company's headquarters in Corning, N.Y., say Mr. Houghton believed Corning's initial deal with International Clinical was locked up. 
Some underlings, however, privately worried that another bidder might appear. 
Still, they were taken off guard by SmithKline's move, which came two weeks after Corning had signed its definitive agreement. 

   Analysts don't expect Corning to raise its bid much higher. 
Already, the offer of $400 million for International Clinical, which has about $71 million in debt and about $86 million in stockholders' equity (including $26 million of goodwill) is considered generous. 
And Corning, a conservative and cautious company, might not want to continue to fight. 

   Takeover tussles haven't been Mr. Houghton's modus operandi. 
The quiet, diplomatic executive is known for his interest in quality control and prefers to negotiate on friendly terms. 
His strength has been in forging successful joint ventures with U.S. and foreign partners. 
Reflecting patient planning, it took two years before Corning and Switzerland's Ciba-Geigy Ltd. agreed to form Ciba-Corning Diagnostics to develop a new generation of blood and urine analyzers. 

   Last year, Corning Glass's profit from such ventures grew 30% to $98 million, or more than half of its total operating profit of $198 million. 
While joint ventures have an average life span of 3.5 years, half of Corning's have existed for at least a decade. 

   With painful tasks, Mr. Houghton shows a paternalistic nature. 
While guiding Corning through a massive restructuring campaign -- which eliminated dozens of old-line manufacturing units while moving into profitable high-technology and medical sciences industries -- he ensured the steps were taken without the major disruptions that plagued other industrial concerns. 

   And each year he visits 50 to 60 Corning operations, where he often chats with employees as he tugs on his suspenders and puffs on an ever-present cigar.
