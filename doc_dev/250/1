<HEAD>Officials Cancel Yoga Class Because of Devil-Worshiping Argument</HEAD>

   Yoga is a form of New Age mysticism that can
lead to devil worship, says a man who led protests that forced
officials to cancel a city-county sponsored yoga class.
   ``The people who are signed up for the class are just walking
into it like cattle to a slaughter,'' said Philip Lawrence. ``Half
of yoga is a branch of Eastern mysticism, and it has strong occult
influences.''
   Lawrence said he is opposing the yoga class as a Christian. He
said other people opposing the classes are from Baptist, Lutheran
and Church of God congregations.
   The class, sponsored by the Toccoa-Stephens County Recreation
Department, was scheduled to begin Monday. It was canceled Aug. 31
after city and county commissioners received a number of complaints
from church members in Toccoa.
   ``The different commissioners got together on the phone, and the
majority decided the class should be canceled,'' Mayor Bill Harris
said. ``Some felt that they were under too much pressure.''
   Leonard Greenspoon, a Clemson University religion professor,
said yoga has become a secularized form of exercise and relaxation.
   ``There's certainly no necessary connection between yoga and
devil worship,'' he said. ``Anybody who's equating Eastern religion
with devil worship has made a big mistake.''
   Roger Terrell, program director for the recreation department,
said he met with yoga teacher Carolyn Davis to make sure the class
would involve only simple stretching and relaxation techniques.
   ``We can't be promoting religion or anything,'' he said. ``It's
strictly for health reasons.''
   Some of the 26 people who had signed up for the yoga class say
they won't let the matter drop. ``This is not the end,'' said
Deborah Hartley. ``This is just the beginning as far as I'm
concerned.''
   She and Katherine Hodges, another would-be yoga student,
complained Tuesday to the county commissioners. She said she also
plans to fight for the class at the next meetings of city-county
commissioners and the recreation board.
