<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 128 pounds;   PERSONAL: Single and lives in San Jose;   OCCUPATION:
Fourth grade teacher, Anderson School in San Jose;   FITNESS BACKGROUND: For
five years during junior and senior high school, Caffiero rode 50 miles a day
on his bike as a messenger. That didn't leave time for sports. Besides, he
says, "I always felt I wasn't athletic. When I played football I got creamed,
on skates I was a klutz, and in center field I always hoped the ball would
fall into my glove." He lost his hair in junior high school -- heredity, he
says -- and started wearing a hairpiece, which made swimming impossible and
weightlifting uncomfortable because of perspiration. "I was never successful
at anything I tried. I started closing down and putting up a wall of armor."; 
 While studying psychology at San Jose State, he turned to an aikido class as
his way "out of hiding." Physical size didn't matter, and he liked the win-win
situation involved when working with a partner while training. Ten years ago
he added tai chi, another system that involves more balance, poise and a
"mindful presence." Three years ago he rounded out his routine with yoga to
concentrate on breath and body alignment without movement.;   REGIMEN: Aikido
and yoga classes on alternating mornings are "my cup of coffee before work,"
he says. He takes tai chi on Tuesday evenings and teaches it on Thursdays.
After another yoga class on Saturday mornings, he teaches two hours of aikido.
And on Sunday mornings, when he isn't hiking in Big Basin, he practices yoga
before going to church services at Center for Spiritual Enlightenment in San
Jose. Caffiero still rides a bike, but it's a tandem now, about 15 miles
round-trip on weekends when he has a partner. He gave up desserts four years
ago, eats fruit in the mornings, and complex carbohydrates and vegetables the
rest of the day.;   RESULTS: He doesn't get sick, he says, even with children
sneezing on him all day. A former "watcher" who too frequently said "I won't,"
"I shouldn't," and "not enough," Caffiero now says, "I'm a participating
person who says, 'there's nothing I can't.' ";   GOALS: To give away what he's
learned. All the money he earns from teaching martial arts is donated to his
church. "It's a form of tithing," he says. "There's a universal energy that
gets us through life, and church is a great support system for that.";  
OBSTACLES: "Ten percent of the time, I don't feel like going (to class), but
half of that time I go anyway and am always glad I did." On the mornings he
decides to skip, he takes a walk, does "mental gymnastics" or goes to school
early.;   TIPS AND COMMENTS: Unlike other forms of exercise that are done
"outside the body," Caffiero says his exercises are more joyful and meaningful
because of the way body, mind and spirit are integrated. "I am comfortable
with my body and am at ease being inside it."  </TEXT>
