<LEADPARA>  MONTEZUMA, the 16th-century Aztec emperor, was one of Mexico's earliest spa
enthusiasts. In fact, three of the mineral baths that Montezuma visited -- in
Tehuacan, Ixtapan de la Sal and Oaxtepec -- are still in use. A number of
Mexican spas (balnearios) are true resorts, with swimming, tennis, horseback
riding and hiking. Spas with these facilities are the most expensive. Others
are mainly places to "take the waters," either outside in natural mineral
springs or inside in spring-fed pools.;    As more Americans discover the
pleasures and benefits of mineral baths, the number of spas grows. And
Mexico's spa potential is formidable -- there are more than 570 known
warm-water mineral springs in the country.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Most mineral waters contain a mixture of sulfate of soda, sulfate of lime,
carbonate of lime, sodium chloride, magnesium and some sulfuric acid. This may
not sound appetizing, and it certainly doesn't look appetizing (the mineral
waters are usually a murky brown color), but for most people the waters are
amazingly soothing.;    Baja California;  (check) RANCHO LA PUERTA, Tecate --
