   With their outer world beset by
economic hardships and political turmoil, several thousand
Romanians turned to yoga Wednesday in an effort to seek inner peace.
   More than 2,000 people gathered in the capital's Polivalenta
Hall _ once used for government-organized rallies in support of
deposed Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu _ for a yoga
convention.
   The gathering was organized by a group of yoga specialists from
different European countries.
   Ceausescu, ousted in December's revolution, banned yoga in the
early 1980s after a group of prominent intellectuals held a
``transcendental meeting'' at the Institute of Psychiatry.
Participants were later demoted from their posts and the institute
was closed down.
   As Oriental music played in the background and the scent of
burning incense filled the air, Romanians of all ages kicked off
their shoes and sought inspiration through yoga.
   Antonio Nazare, a French assistant to the Indian guru Shri
Mataji, exhorted the crowd to ``regain their inner peace,''
instructing them to reach out with their hands a huge framed
photograph of the Shri ``to absorb her energy.''
   ``I'm asking you to experience the peace of the self ... here
where comfort is more difficult to attain than in other places in
the world,'' Nazare said.
   Most of those attending the yoga meeting said they wanted to
seek refuge from the tension and confusion that have gripped
Romania since December's bloody revolution.
   ``I am happy to discover that I can find peace and calm in the
general political pandemonium with yoga,'' said 31-year-old
engineer Sandu Bidan. ``I can also find liberty.''
   Romania is suffering a severe economic crisis, marked by
shortages of many basic consumer goods. Political tensions have
been on the rise since June when the government of President Ion
Iliescu broke up a demonstration by anti-Communist activists and
jailed dozens of opponents.
   Nazare said he expected even more people to attend a second
Bucharest yoga meeting scheduled for Thursday.
   He also announced that Shri Mataji planned to visit Romania in
October. Mataji has been touring Eastern Europe, and recently
appeared before 15,000 people in Bulgaria, Nazare said.
