   Perhaps ``Room Arranging Dos and Don'ts''
won't sell as many videocassettes as ``Batman.'' But business for
how-to videos is up, and even the most obscure instructional
cassettes have a chance.
   At the ninth annual Video Software Dealers Association
Convention here this week, hit films like ``Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles'' are drawing most of the attention from the 15,000 video
retailers, distributors and producers. In the corners of the VSDA's
convention floor, though, lurk more intriguing productions.
   Pacific Arts Video offers ``Sirius Puppy Training,'' with hints
on how to teach man's best friend to sit, stay, heel and go to the
bathroom outdoors. The Crocus video distribution company is pleased
with sales for ``Aerobics With Soul,'' a workout set to African
music. Wood Knapp Video is featuring ``Yo-Yo Man,'' an
instructional cassette hosted by the Smothers Brothers that comes
with a free yo-yo.
   ``The how-to, self-instruction category is one of the fastest
growing,'' said John Bjerke of Better Homes &amp; Gardens Video. In
addition to its new ``Room Arranging'' release, Better Homes is
selling the popular ``Building a Deck,'' ``Refinishing Furniture,''
``Wallpaper Like a Pro!'' and ``Foolproof Flower Beds.''
   According to figures compiled by Nielsen Media Research,
exercise and instructional titles accounted for an estimated 16
percent of pre-recorded cassettes sold last year. Another study
found that demand for instructional titles is growing.
   Two of the four most popular selections from Wishing Well
Distribution are yoga cassettes: ``Alive With Yoga With Lilias
Folan'' and ``Richard Hittleman's Yoga Course.''
   ``People are focusing more on stress reduction and relaxation
these days,'' said Wishing Well's Kim Heron. ``And that's what yoga
is.'' The cmpany's sales more than doubled from 1988 to 1989.
   Proudly proclaiming ``Identify birds by video!,'' MasterVision
is showcasing a five-volume series called ``The Audubon Society's
Video Guide to Birds of North America.''
   ``It's sight and sound _ perfect for bird-watching,'' said
MasterVision President Richard Stadin. ``No book can do this. Books
are two-dimensional, but the video is three-dimensional.''
   Other MasterVision cassettes include one on little-league
baseball tactics and ``Basic Arabic by Video.'' ``This is very
current today,'' Stadin noted.
   Not all of the new how-to titles are necessarily tame. Playboy
Home Video introduced ``Secrets of EuroMassage,'' with a Playboy
bunny giving convention goers free massages to help boost sales.
   One how-to video that would interest convention guests isn't
available in any booth. That's a cassette that would give
distributors and retailers tips to help stop slowing video sales
and consumer dissatisfaction.
   In a glum convention keynote address, Robert Klingensmith,
president of the Paramount Picture's video division, said that
after 10 years of explosive growth the cassette business now has
stalled.
   ``We have new customers who are hard to reach and old customers
whose interests may be waning or need to be reinforced,''
Klingensmith said. He called on store owners to make the practice
of renting and buying tapes more pleasant.
   To help generate business, Paramount pledged $100,000 to a
proposed industry-wide advertising campaign that would highlight
the joys of videocassettes.
   For another reason, Paramount wasn't welcomed warmly on the
convention floor. Its decision to sell copies of ``The Hunt for Red
October'' at a retail price of $99.95 _ instead of the traditional
$89.95 or less _ means that many store owners may have to raise
their rental fees or see their profit margins narrow.
