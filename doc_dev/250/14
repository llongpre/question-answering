   The Vatican warned Catholics on Thursday
that such methods as Zen, yoga and Transcendental Meditation can
``degenerate into a cult of the body,'' and it urged proper
Christian prayer.
   A document issued by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine
of the Faith, the pope's guardian of orthodoxy, said increased
attempts to fuse Eastern and Catholic meditation pose ``dangers and
errors.''
   It said these efforts ``need to have their contents and methods
ever subjected to a thorough-going examination so as to avoid the
danger of falling into syncretism'' _ the merging of different
religious practices.
   It was believed the first time the Vatican has addressed
publicly the problems raised by what it ackowledged is the strong
attraction for some Catholics of methods inspired by Eastern
religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism.
   The 23-page document, approved by Pope John Paul II and
addressed to bishops, said some forms of Eastern meditation can be
positive.
   ``One can take from them what is useful as so long as the
Christian conception of prayer, its logic and requirements are
never obscured,'' the document said.
   ``The love of God, the sole object of Christian contemplation,
is a reality which cannot be `mastered' by any method or
technique,'' it added.
   The congregation president, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of West
Germany, said the report was not condemning Eastern methods but
elaborating on guidelines for genuine Christian prayer.
   ``The fundamental affirmation of the document is very simple,''
Ratzinger told a news conference. ``Christian meditation is not
submersion in an impersonal divine atmosphere, in an abyss without
face or form.''
   Without identifying them, Ratzinger and other Vatican officials
said the document was directly especially to religious movements,
associations, prayer groups, monasteries and convents that have
strayed in the use of Eastern meditation practices.
   The document defined Christian prayer as a ``personal, intimate
and profound dialogue between man and God.''
   Such prayer ``flees from impersonal techniques or from
concentrating on oneself, which can create a kind of rut,
imprisoning the person praying in a spriritual privatism.''
   In a footnote, the document described Eastern methods as Zen,
Transcendental Meditation and yoga, which involves prescribed
postures and controlled breathing.
   The document said some Catholics turn to these techniques for
therapeutic reasons and to escape from the stress and pressures of
modern-day life.
   ``Without doubt, a Christian needs certain periods of retreat
into solitude to be recollected and, in God's presence, rediscover
his path,'' it said. ``Nevertheless ... his method of getting
closer to God is not based on any technique in the strict sense of
the word.''
   The church has faced the problem of ``erroneous ways of
praying'' from its early history, the document said. These forms
``seem once more to impress many Christians, appealing to them as a
kind of remedy, be it psychological or spiritual, or as a quick way
of finding God,'' it said.
   The document expressed particular concern over misconceptions
about body postures in meditation.
   It said the exercise of the ``Jesus Prayer,'' which is adapted
to the natural rhythm of breathing, can ``be of real help to many
people.'' The ``Jesus Prayer'' consists of repeating a formula of
invocation and supplication such as ``Lord Jesus Christ, Son of
God, have mercy on me.''
   But other forms of Eastern ``psychological symbolism'' can
``degenerate into a cult of the body and can lead surreptitiously
to considering all bodily sensations as spiritual experiences,''
the document said.
   ``Some physical experiences,'' it added, ``automatically produce
a feeling of quiet and relaxation, pleasing sensations, perhaps
even phenomena of light and of warmth, which resemble spiritual
well-being. To take such feelings for authentic consolations of the
Holy Spirit, would be a totally erroneous way of conceiving the
spriritual life.''
   A false mystical experience represents ``a kind of mental
schizophrenia which could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at
times, to moral deviations.''
   Ratzinger said improper forms of meditation are based on
egotistical concerns.
   ``The spiritual or infinite which has assumed an impersonal
dimension becomes simply a bath, in which the human being
strengthens himself ... Religion becomes a flight into pleasing
sensations or therapeutic means,'' he said.
   Asked whether he accepts yoga, Ratzinger said it was a
simplistic question which he could not answer simply. But he said
he opposed forms which ``become only a therapeutic technique or a
type of sport.''
