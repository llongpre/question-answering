<LEADPARA>  IF YOU could buy fitness, chances are it would be this season's most popular
gift. Who wouldn't like stronger muscles, a leaner body or a healthier heart?
But even though you can't shape up your loved one for the holidays, you can
wish them well with a gift geared to boosting their joy of motion.;   But
before you plunk down your gold card for the latest fitness fad consider this:
"The No. 1 thing I see is people spending a fair amount of money on exercise
equipment, then not using it," says Coke Farmer, director of the Wellness
Research Lab at the University of Maryland. To ensure that your gift doesn't
get stuffed in a closet or sold at the next yard sale, make sure it's
something the recipient is at least reasonably interested in, she advises.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It has to be fun or it won't get done.;   Think childhood;   If you're
shopping for a sedentary adult who needs to get moving, think back to the
activities that person enjoyed as a child. Then look for items that will help
them start dancing, swimming, bicycling or playing ball again. If your gift is
for a child, consider active toys such as skates, balls, pogo sticks,
mini-trampolines, jump ropes, Frisbees and sleds. Or choose something that can
get the whole family moving together, such as a ping pong table, basketball
backboard, bicycles or rollerblades all around.;   If you're considering
expensive equipment, always try before you buy, and ask if you can rent the
item for a few weeks first. Expect to spend at least $400 for a good
stationary bike, stair climber, ski machine or rower, and several thousand
dollars for a treadmill.;   In general, pick sturdy over pretty and buy the
best equipment you can afford as an investment you'll use hard and often.
Shoddily made items are likely to break down or work improperly, so they're no
bargain. If you need to shave dollars, choose a well-made, no-frills model
without fancy electronics or decorator colors. Or check the ads for a good,
used one.;   Go to the pros;   When buying for a sophisticated exerciser, shop
at a sports specialty store and get advice from a knowledgeable sales clerk.
Or consider a gift certificate from his or her favorite pro shop. Always be
sure -- particularly if you're buying for someone else -- that the gift is
returnable.;   You don't have to spend a nickel for a fitness gift. Promise to
walk with someone daily, become their workout buddy or teach them an activity
you know -- from the fox trot to a slam dunk. If you have up to $100 to spend,
here's a sample of exercising options:;   (check) Fitness evaluation and/or
