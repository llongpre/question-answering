<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 118 pounds;    PERSONAL: Single mother of two grown children. She
lives in Morgan Hill.;    OCCUPATION: Office manager, Seagull Precision Inc.
in Morgan Hill.;    FITNESS BACKGROUND: Three years after the birth of her
second child, Campbell felt she could no longer justify weighing 140 pounds by
saying, "I just had a baby.";    She started yoga classes and began jogging.
The pounds began to drop, "but I never enjoyed it. All I could think about
while running was when I would be done." A year later she tried an aerobics
class and enjoyed it so much she taught at the Morgan Hill YMCA for nine
years. "Unlike running, the hour was always up before I thought about it.";   
REGIMEN: For the past two years, since Campbell quit teaching, she has been
working out every weekday morning at home. She begins a 45-minute aerobics
workout at 5 a.m., which is followed by a weight routine for her upper body
and a cool-down period of yoga and meditation. On weekends, she prefers
unstructured workouts and a change of pace, which include mountain biking and
hikes.;    She is careful about what she eats, but rewards herself
occasionally. "When I'm tempted to binge, I use a few mental tricks, like
reminding myself how that two minutes of pleasure lowers my self-esteem and is
not worth it, compared to the long-term pleasure I get from looking and
feeling good.";    RESULTS: "My doctor says I have the heart of an athlete. I
have incredible energy and stamina, and my self-esteem is boosted --
especially when I'm with my daughter and people say, 'You can't possibly be
her mother.' ";    GOALS: "To live each day to the fullest and keep exercise a
priority in my life.";    OBSTACLES: "They are created in your mind. If I have
to, I push myself because I know I'll regret it later in the day if I don't.
It helps that I am a morning person, though, because if I waited until I got
home from work, I'd be doomed.";    TIPS AND COMMENTS: "When you feel healthy
and fit, enthusiasm and enjoyment of life is enhanced by your age."  </TEXT>
