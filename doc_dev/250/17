'SHE LIKED going to the gym, or rather, she liked having been to the gym,
and the only way to have been was to go.'
Suzanne Vale in Postcards from the Edge by Carrie Fisher.
IN JANUARY, just when most of us were feeling at our lowest, the Weekend FT
gave readers the chance to lunch for a fiver at many of the country's top
restaurants. Now, at the start of the high holiday season, just when our
bodies are most on show, the Weekend FT offers a chance to get Fit for a
Fiver.
Health and fitness centres are one of the business phenomena of the age.
From Land's End to John O'Groats classes in everything from step aerobics
and yoga, from cross-training to weight-lifting and Stretch 'n' Tone are on
offer while in the treatment rooms the pampering with oils and lotions and
potions goes on. No smart hotel wooing sophisticated international customers
would hope to get by without a mini-spa and almost every small town has one.
But there are plenty of us who have never been near one. If you have ever
wondered just what goes on in them or what they could possibly offer you,
now is the time to find out.
The FT's Lunch for a Fiver offer is a hard act to follow but we believe many
of you will jump at the chance to try our Fit for a Fiver scheme. Around 100
top health and leisure clubs have agreed to open up their clubs and allow FT
readers to sample their facilities for just Pounds 5 a time.
All the clubs have been carefully selected - we wanted to give a good
geographical spread so that as many readers as possible could benefit and we
wanted to make sure the clubs could cope with the demand. Though no two
clubs are identical they all have a gym and offer a proper fitness
assessment, a range of classes and treatments and many, but not all, have
swimming pools and saunas.
For your fiver you can enjoy everything a member enjoys for half a day,
including a fitness assessment and one of the available exercise classes.
The specialist beauty treatments and therapies are not included.
The fitness assessment varies slightly from club to club but all should take
a verbal history of illnesses and injuries, test the blood pressure, weigh
and measure you, do some sort of cardio-vascular test which usually involves
assessing the heart-beat when resting and after several minutes of vigorous
exercise. Some add in blood tests, many do fat tests (a most unedifying
business - callipers measure the fat at different points on the body), some
test oxygen intake, some test cholesterol.
Fit for a Fiver starts today and runs up to and including Friday, August 13.
The list of clubs is printed in the box on the right of this page and if you
want to have a go all you need to do is make an appointment with the club of
your choice, take along the application form (also printed here) and present
it together with your Pounds 5. If you are keen to try, I suggest you lose
no time - those who dithered about where to go for lunch for a fiver found
that most of the restaurants they wanted to try were already booked up.
Of course, we are not suggesting that any of our readers could possibly
become truly fit after just one visit to a health club but what we are
hoping is that it may be just the kick-start that many of you need to embark
on a sensible sustained programme of exercise. Now is your chance to build
up your muscles, to tackle your cellulite, to try out a facial, to get rid
of the flab and generally feel better and stronger.
It should give anybody who has been seriously considering joining a gym or
health club a wonderful opportunity to see just what they have to offer and
to talk through, at the fitness assessment, just what you hope to achieve -
greater aerobic fitness, greater suppleness or strength or simply a modicum
of gentle exercise such as yoga, some complementary treatments and
companionship. If you do decide to join afterwards (and absolutely no
pressure will be put on you to do so) a good club should help you find ways
of doing all this.
One of the great mysteries is why, when almost everybody agrees that a
certain amount of exercise is essential for most people's health and sense
of well-being, so few people actually do anything about it. I reported
earlier this year how Allied Dunbar (which produced an excellent study on
the physical state of the nation) had found that though four out of five
people believe some form of exercise is good for them only half of those who
believed it ever got around to doing anything about it.
Dr James M Rippe (Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School) in a series of learned papers on the research
into the effects of exercise on people with medical ailments as well as
healthy people is in no doubt at all about the benefits. 'The jury is in,'
he writes - he may be short on colourful phrases but his message is clear -
'There can no longer be any doubt that daily habits and practices have a
profound impact on long-term health . . . the decision to lead an active
life is one of the most positive steps an individual can take not only to
improve quality of life but also to reduce the risk of developing a host of
chronic diseases.' More than that: 'A sedentary lifestyle, is hazardous to
an individual's health.'
But this does not mean you have to go in for pain and punishment. Those who
fear that a gym or health club has nothing to offer but stress, sweat and
toil should take heart. Health clubs these days are much gentler, less
punishing places, as concerned about reducing stress as taking off the
inches and increasing aerobic strength. Holistic is the buzz-word for
1990s-style clubs. Dr Rippe, for instance, in his researches found that
'gentle exercise, such as slow or moderate paced walking, when coupled with
a cognitive component, such as the 'mindful' exercise disciplines of yoga or
t'ai chi or other relaxation techniques (which most up-to-date clubs offer),
results in immediate physical and psychological benefits.'
I've always felt we could learn a lot from the French when it comes to
health and beauty. When things begin to get her down, a French woman (and in
case this sounds sexist let me just say I don't recall any French men having
recourse to this particular ploy) can indulge in a small crise, nothing too
serious, of course, just a little crise, of les nerfs or la foie, depending
on her temperament, which then allows her to indulge herself at one of those
marvellous instituts de beaute that are so practised at recognising the
intimate connection between health and beauty. There women are pampered and
polished, massaged and soothed and, if things are really serious, they go in
for a cure de detente, from which they emerge all cleansed and rested ready
to face the world again.
British clubs are at last adopting something of this approach. Women readers
will find many of the clubs absolute havens - no longer cold and draughty
with inadequate showering arrangements, most of them now go in for piles of
fluffy towels, generous boxes of tissues, plenty of hot showers,
hair-dryers, restaurants with delicious (but low-fat) food.
They are places where you can take time out from the world, where you can
have any or all of the lovely pampering treatments that are part of today's
approach to health and beauty . . . aromatherapy, massage, facials,
manicures, reflexology. You do not need to perform like a hamster on a
treadmill or sweat away re-aligning your muscles. Today health and fitness
clubs are much more like the old-fashioned, proper clubs . . . places where
you can go to feel good, to swim or have a massage, take a class, have a
meal and meet some friends.
My final thought is that if you take as your motto 'If I don't enjoy it I'm
not going to do it' you cannot go far wrong. Have a go - you may enjoy it
all a great deal more than you think.
Over the next two weeks a selection of participating clubs will be listed
daily in the FT. The application form will be included on alternate days.
