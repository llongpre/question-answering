   What's in a name? Plenty, if it happens to be
Spa, Belgium. For that town in the eastern Ardennes with its
healing waters has given its name worldwide to the spots where
people go to feel better, shape up physically, unknot their
tensions, shed excess pounds and be pampered with manicures,
pedicures, facials, hair-styling and the like.
   Spa, Belgium, was mentioned by the Roman Pliny the Elder in the
first century A.D., it is believed. In the Middle Ages, its healing
waters began to be exploited. Beginning in about the 16th century,
royalty including Margaret of Navarre, Queen Christina of Sweden,
Peter the Great of Russia and Austrian Emperor Joseph II frequented
the resort.
   It is still there, catering not only to those who seek a
``cure,'' but to those who just want a pleasant vacation, with
golf, riding, fishing, tennis, a casino, concerts, a nearby
racetrack and parachute jumping exhibits at a nearby airfield.
   From Alaska to Brazil and Australia and Japan to Greece and
Hungary, people are going to spas _ all kinds of spas.
   Spa-Finders, which puts out a spa catalogue and also uses a
computer to help match people with the right spa for them, lists
eight major categories. They include classic fitness spas that
combine exercise, diet and relaxation in fairly equal proportions;
spas that specialize in behavior modification; those that feature
mineral springs, and holistic spas. The holistic spas are often
vegetarian and offer such Eastern practices as yoga and Siatsu
massage.
   Spas have a vocabulary of their own _ including Siatsu, which is
a Japanese method of massage that follows the patterns used in
acupuncture. A person can become involved with a Scotch hose, Swiss
shower, salt glo, polarity, reflexology, thalassotherapy _ or sit
it out in a Roman bath, a heated sea-water jacuzzi with benches.
   The average person pedaling an exercise bike and swimming laps
at the ``Y'' may think spas are not for her or him. Too expensive.
Not so, say the spa people, who say you can find some costing only
a few hundred dollars a week per person.
   Ryan Vollmer, in ``Affordable Spas &amp; Fitness Resorts,'' says
nearly 90 percent of spas now operating in the United States cost
less than $1,000 a week, and some are priced in the $400 to $500
range.
   Some are advertised for even less: Spend a week at a New
Hampshire retreat that emphasizes stress-reduction by massage,
yoga, meditation, long walks in the woods, sunbathing and swimming,
for instance. Or you can get spruced up at a resort hotel and spa
in the Arkansas Hot Springs National Park-Ouachita Mountain area.
In California, one is invited to bathe in hot springs at
temperatures of 98 to 120 degrees at a kerosene-lit hotel on ground
that was considered sacred for healing by the Indians. Bring your
own food and cook it on a country stove. All these places are under
$400.
   At the other end of the price list are such establishments as
California's Golden Door, whose fans insist it's worth every bit of
the more than $3,000 one will spend for a week's hospitality.
   Jeffrey Joseph of Spa-Finders has found that the spa market is a
United States one. If Americans go abroad, he says, it's usually to
well-known resorts such as Montecatini in Italy, Baden-Baden, West
Germany, or Baden, Switzerland.
   But there are bargains waiting all over Europe and other
countries - including Australia, Margaret Island in the Danube at
Budapest, the Greek island of Kos, Yugoslavia and Austria _ and
Spa, Belgium.
