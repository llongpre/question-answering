   A year ago, Sally Kirkland won an Academy
Award nomination as best actress and became the year's Cinderella
story, even if the coach and horses arrived a few decades late.
   The actress made her film debut in 1964, then got sidetracked
into off-Broadway plays and underground movies, many of which
displayed ample views of the admirable Kirkland frame. She later
played minor roles in films from ``The Sting'' to ``The Incredible
Shrinking Woman.''
   A few years ago, she campaigned for a low-budget drama, ``Anna,''
adding pounds and aging herself to fit the role of a faded Czech
film actress adrift in New York. She won the role and the
nomination, and no one was more tickled than she with such
recognition.
   Now, four films later, she retains her native vivacity.
   ``I got to turn down 10 to 15 scripts right away, because they
all came at once,'' the 44-year-old actress said. ``I chose the
parts I did because frankly, they gave me chances to make real
contributions; some of the other scripts may have been big-studio
deals, but they were smaller parts.
   ``A lot of people said, `Don't work, wait until you get the next
honest script.' I didn't want to be overly idealistic about that. I
wasn't sure when the `next honest script,' whatever that is, would
come. I wanted to keep working, and so I have been working nonstop.''
   The starring roles are in ``Melanie Rose,'' ``Paint It Black''
and ``Cold Feet.'' She also played a cameo role in ``Revenge,'' with
Kevin Costner and Anthony Quinn.
   ``Cold Feet,'' which will be released in April, is a modern
Western filmed in Montana and Arizona with Kirkland, Keith
Carradine, Tom Waits and Rip Torn. Playing with such an eccentric
group, she said, ``was very much like being a Marx sister.''
   She chose ``Cold Feet'' because ``I was dying to do light comedy
after such a tragic story as `Anna.'
   ``I also got to look very pretty, which I wasn't able to do in
`Anna.' I practically signed my life on the line, saying they could
do a `Raging Bull' number on me. Otherwise I wouldn't get the
part.'' The reference is to the critically acclaimed film about
boxer Jake LaMotta for which Robert DeNiro added 60 pounds.
   ``Revenge'' also took her to a rugged location in Durango, Mexico.
   She was impressed with Kevin Costner: ``He's so human, he's so
real. I pointed out a few things in the script that could be
reworked. Right away he went to Tony (Scott, the director) and said,
`Could Sally and I improvise for you?' Tony was wonderful in the
sense that he let us try new things.''
   Sally Kirkland's ambition came early. Growing up in New York City
the daughter of a fashion editor, she became acquainted with the
rich and famous. An early mentor was legendary producer David O.
Selznick, who predicted she would become a star. But he also
cautioned that she would be a late bloomer.
   The frustration of waiting caused a collapse in 1964.
   ``I think I had a breakdown,'' she recalled. ``I had so many
wide-eyed dreams, and one after another, things started going wrong.
   ``But when I came back, I had learned to meditate, I meditate a
couple of hours now. I do an incredible amount of exercise, Hatha
yoga and dance. I dance like a nut.
   ``I like to think that I have the body of a 20-year-old and the
energy of a 15-year-old. So the minute anything happens in the
business like rejection, I go run a mile, swim a mile, do three
hours back-to-back of hatha yoga, something very physical. Or, I
create a psychodrama session with a couple of actors and scream it
out. I don't sit on it.''
   Kirkland said the Oscar nomination was ``like a dream.''
   ``I was so high. I was like a little 12-year-old, so excited that
I don't think my feet were on the ground. my feet are back on the
ground now, and I'm still kind of amazed.
   ``I ran into a bunch of young actors yesterday, and they told me
how their acting teachers used me as an example in class. That
amazed me. I can remember when I used to look to Kim Stanley,
Geraldine Page and a lot of wonderful Broadway actresses. I thought,
`Oh God, some day I hope I can act as well as them.'''
   She admits that losing the Oscar to Cher was a bummer, since she
had been dreaming of a dark-horse victory. But, characteristically,
the depression didn't last long.
   ``I tell young actors: Make sure you do something else besides
acting. For me, it was painting and teaching. I think that if you do
acting and nothing else, when you're out of work you tend to turn
everything in against yourself and reject yourself,'' she said.
   ``If you have anything else you enjoy doing, particularly of the
arts _ writing, directing, producing, painting, music _ do it.
Because unless you can have fun with the game of the business, the
business is tough. It's tough no matter how you look at it,
particularly for women, although that's changing.
