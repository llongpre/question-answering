<HEAD>Study Finds Aerobic Exercise Good for Older People, Too</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Healthy older people who did aerobic exercises
in a four-month study improved their physical well-being and their
outlook on life.
   The study of 101 healthy men and women age 60-83 found that
those who participated in an hour-long aerobic exercise program
three times a week showed improved cardiorespiratory fitness, lower
cholesterol, a small weight loss and an increase in bone mineral
content among subjects at risk of bone fractures.
   The moderate-intensity exercise program included a 10-minute
warmup, 30 minutes of bicycling, 15 of brisk walking-jogging and 5
of cool-down exercises.
   Other subjects in the study participated in a yoga and
flexibility exercise program or were part of a control group whose
members did not change their physical activity habits. These groups
showed no improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness.
   While the study found no significant changes in a battery of
psychological tests, members of the aerobic and yoga groups felt
healthier and slept better and ``reported improved family
relations, better sex life, less loneliness and a better social
life ... improved mood, self-confidence and life satisfaction, and
that they had better memory and concentration,'' the researchers
reported.
   Members of the control group noticed little change over the four
months.
   The research, carried out by scientists from Duke University
Medical Center and the North Carolina Spine Center, was financed by
grants from the National Institute on Aging and the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute.
   Results of the study, led by Dr. James A. Blumenthal, were
reported in the September issue of The Journal of Gerontology:
Medical Sciences, published by The Gerontological Society of
America.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Residents Often See Life as Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elderly people often consider their
life stories to be over by the time they enter a nursing home, says
a sociologist who asked nursing-home residents to divide their
lives into chapters.
   ``Rarely does the last chapter include their current
situation,'' said Jaber Gubrium, of the University of Florida. ``It
may end at retirement or when a spouse dies _ but it rarely ends
with the nursing home.''
   Although the elderly acknowledge their current existence in a
nursing home, they do not deem it part of their lives, Gubrium said.
   His study, funded by the National Institute on Aging, found that
the few people who have close relationships in a nursing home are
likeliest to consider the institution home-like and the experience
a meaningful part of their lives.
   ``When we ask nursing home patients if the place is home,
they'll say `No. It's homey, but it's not home.' One woman who did
call the place home said her roommate was like a sister to her and
several other people were like family to her,'' Gubrium said.
Others said nursing homes would be more like home if they were free
to come and go. Dependence and poor health _ not the nursing home
itself _ separated ``just living'' from life in these people.
   ``We chose people close to the end of life for this study
because we wanted to see if life extends subjectively to the very
end,'' he said.
   Gubrium began his two-year study this fall by interviewing
residents of nursing homes, adult congregate living facilities and
the general community in the Gainesville area. Unlike nursing home
residents, other people in the study include their current living
circumstances as part of their lives.
