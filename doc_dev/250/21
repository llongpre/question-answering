<LEADPARA>  On one hand, we have families with two or three nannies ("Make Room for
Nanny," April 21). On the other hand, we have the Aiken-Forderers ("Just Do
It," June 2) who have adopted "16 severely handicapped boys" and "have no
time." Perhaps one of the former families could spare a nanny for the latter
family.;    Colleen S. Uehara  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  San Jose;  ABUSE OF POWER; "Betrayal of Trust" (May 26) was an important
expose for the yoga community. I was shocked at the reports of sexual abuse by
the courageous women who told their stories.;    As a former student of
Manouso Manos, I was not personally affected by his alleged misconduct until I
read "Betrayal of Trust." I will never again be able to learn yoga from
Manouso, which is a shame because he is a gifted teacher. If Manouso is
mentally ill around sexuality he should seek professional help. Until he does
I will not believe his "promise" to stop or that he is a "changed man.";
