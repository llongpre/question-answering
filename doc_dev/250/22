   Followers of the late Bhagwan Shree
Rajneesh, the free-love guru who was expelled by the United States,
today danced, meditated and chanted the mystic's favorite mantra _
``hoo, hoo, hoo'' _ a day after his death of a heart attack.
   Rajneesh also made a final ``appearance'' before 10,000 of his
followers in a videotape and told them: ``Think deep. Go deeper.''
   The 58-year-old mystic has not named a successor, and his death
Friday launched a wave of speculation about the future of his
commune, its 500 worldwide branches, and its claimed 500,000
members.
   The videotape was played at the mystic's southern commune in the
city of Poona, where Rajneesh set up an international headquarters
after his deportation from the United States in 1985.
   ``Osho is very much here,'' said follower Ma Yoga, using an
honorific name that Rajneesh called himself in recent years. The
term means ``on whom the heavens shower flowers.'' ``Bhagwan'' is a
Hindu honorific meaning ``god.''
   ``It is like any other day here. It does not matter if Osho has
left his body,'' said Ma Yoga, a member of the 23-year-old cult's
Poona commune, in a telephone interview. ``He lives, the commune
lives.''
   A statement from the commune quoted the guru as saying hours
before his death, ``My work will go on and grow stronger after I
leave my body.''
   In a statement telexed from Poona, Rajneesh's personal doctor
said the guru was in pain for many weeks before his death.
   ``I asked Osho if he wanted us to prepare for cardiac
resuscitation, and he said, `No, if I die it will be relief from
the pain,''' said British physician Swami Amrito.
   Rajneesh died of a heart attack, according to a doctor's death
certificate.
   However, a commune statement released today said the guru died
because ``living in the body had become a hell.''
   It repeated Rajneesh's charges he was poisoned in U.S. jails
before he was deported.``While he was in Oklahoma County jail (in
Oklahoma state), he was poisoned with heavy metal thallium. They
exposed him to radiation in a way that it will not leave any
proof.''
   Thallium is used in making rat poison.
   Local health officials said Rajneesh suffered from AIDS, but the
commune denied those reports about two years ago.
   Rajneesh's most famous commune, the Rancho Rajneesh, was founded
in Oregon in 1981.
   He brought his teachings of free sex and materialism to the
scrubby hills near Antelope, Ore., drawing thousands of slavish
disciples. They were rewarded with the guru's daily ``drive-by'' in
one of his 93 Rolls-Royces _ many painted psychedelic colors, and
some decorated with peacocks and lacy curtains.
   To many nearby residents, the commune known as Rajneeshpuram was
a monstrous intrusion. It was disbanded in 1985 when Rajneesh, a
native of India, was expelled from the United States in a plea
bargain on immigration fraud charges.
