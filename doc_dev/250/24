<TEXT>     Not Ed McCracken.;    On Sunday, the president and chief executive officer
of Silicon Graphics Inc. will spend the day teaching a course on Siddha yoga
meditation, an Indian spiritual discipline intended to promote inner peace and
unleash creativity.;    McCracken, 47, is just about the total opposite of an
Indian spiritual guru. An electrical engineer with a master of business
administration degree from Stanford University, McCracken is a tall,
soft-spoken, blond-haired native of Iowa who describes Siddha meditation as a
way of escaping the stress of 80-hour workweeks.;    "Giving myself a day once
a month to spend in meditation is a neat thing with my busy schedule,"
McCracken said. "There's a lot of burn-out in this valley. It's important to
take care of yourself.";    Silicon Valley may be a pressure cooker, but it is
also sprinkled with New Age sensitivity. A CEO in New York, Boston or Chicago
undoubtedly would face considerable pressure not to publicly associate with
anything so untraditional as Siddha meditation. This willingness to experiment
with new ideas is one reason Silicon Valley is so successful and more
innovative than other parts of the country, according to Stanford business
school Professor Michael Ray.;    "I think it's always been accepted here that
if you get the job done, stay on top of the market and treat your people well,
then you're accepted" said Ray, a 14-year Siddha veteran who is joining
McCracken to teach the class Sunday.;    McCracken is certainly getting the
job done. Mountain View-based Silicon Graphics is one of the hottest companies
in Silicon Valley, building sophisticated computer work stations used for
everything from designing jet fighters to creating the special effects for the
movie "Terminator 2." From a start-up in 1982, the company has grown to 2,600
employees and yearly sales of $550 million.;    But McCracken is resisting the
Silicon Valley pattern of overwork that turns individuals into nothing more
than extensions of their jobs.;    "I really am something other than that," he
said. "Here in the valley, there's a lot of encouragement to do new things, to
do things differently than other people." Meditating helps him stay centered
at work, he explained, "detached from the battle at hand" and capable of
looking at the big picture.;    McCracken said he's always had a
"contemplative nature," tracing back to his family's adherence to the Quaker
faith. He was introduced to Siddha meditation by his future wife Sandhya when
the couple met in 1984.;    Siddha is a Sanskrit word that roughly translates
as "perfected." Masters of Siddha meditation strive for a perfected state of
concentration, rising above the distractions of the outside world and their
own bodies to concentrate solely on the Shakti, or spiritual energy, within
their own minds.;    "All meditation is a process of getting in touch with
yourself, a part of you inside that is a source of creativity and inspiration,
happiness and joy," McCracken said. "It's a smart thing to do. Who wants to
live their whole life and never get acquainted with themselves?";    He
typically meditates for 20 minutes in the morning at his Los Altos home,
sitting quietly in a chair. "It's turning the focus inside rather than
outside," McCracken said. "That's it. There's no magic.";    Siddha meditation
is a low-key pursuit, with none of the pressure associated with Indian cult
religions. The Syda Foundation of South Fallsburg, N.Y., which supports Siddha
meditation in the United States, doesn't maintain a list of members and
doesn't proselytize. But the movement's New Age sensitivity is attracting
celebrity supporters, including actress Phylicia Rashad, who plays Bill
Cosby's television wife on "The Cosby Show.";    The all-day seminar on
Sunday, which costs $125, is aimed at introducing Silicon Valley professionals
to Siddha meditation. Participants will gather in an appropriate setting -- a
conference room belonging to the brokerage firm Dean Witter Reynolds on the
11th floor of a downtown San Jose office building. The day will alternate
between lectures and periods of meditation.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The
Siddha yoga meditation seminar will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Sunday
in downtown San Jose. The registration fee is $125. For information on this
seminar and other Siddha meditation seminars to be held later this year at
various South Bay locations, contact Carola B. Hixson at 408-947-3735
(weekdays) or 408-559-0644 (evenings and weekends).  </TEXT>
