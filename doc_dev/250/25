ABOUT A THIRD OF THE NATION'S SENIORS EXERCISE, AND EXPERTS SAY THEY'RE ON THE 
RIGHT TRACK

Age 60 was something of a bummer for Burt DeGroot Jr., of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Back in his pole vaulting days at Stanford, he had injured his right ankle. The 
years had gone by, and now the effects of that injury were bothering him to the 
point that he had to give up his longtime conditioning program of running and 
jumping and volleyball playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dean of student activities at Santa Monica College, and I began using my 
lunch hour, instead of eating, to lift weights in the gym," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried Putting the Shot 
</P>
<P>
"That was turning out so well that when I reached age 64, my brother, who was 
track coach at Fullerton High School, suggested that I stop by and have a try 
at putting the shot and throwing the discus." 
</P>
<P>
DeGroot, now 82, is busy prepping to compete in the second biennial U.S. 
National Senior Olympics this June in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
His specialty: Shot putting and discus throwing. 
</P>
<P>
"I practice three times a week at San Clemente High School," the octogenarian 
said proudly. "I can put the shot about 28 feet, and I can throw the discus 
about 90 feet." 
</P>
<P>
Many seniors still hesitate to join the fitness craze in America, but what with 
the increasing graying of the nation, attention is turning more and more to the 
issue of what extent older people should participate in exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys, according to the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, 
show that only about one-third of American adults age 65 and older exercise 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Benefits of Activity 
</P>
<P>
This is unfortunate, health experts say. "The four most common chronic 
conditions among adults age 65 and older are arthritis, hypertension, hearing 
impairments and heart disease," said a spokesman for the Council. "All but 
hearing impairment can be positively influenced by appropriate exercise." 
</P>
<P>
But those seniors who have tried intensive exercise seem to have caught the 
bug. Two years at the first Senior Olympics, about 3,000 people showed up from 
38 states to compete in swimming, archery, volleyball and other events. A 
spokesman for the Senior Olympics expects 4,000 to show up this year. 
</P>
<P>
Who better to proclaim the exercise gospel than an elderly person himself, 
78-year-old Dr. John H. Williams of Valdese, N.C., a former health educator who 
continues to practice what he preaches. 
</P>
<P>
Five days a week he drives 50 miles round-trip just to swim at the YMCA in 
Conover -- about 600 yards daily at present -- in preparation for the swimming 
events at the coming Senior Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimming is ideal exercise for seniors," Williams said by phone. "There is no 
pressure on the bones, joints and tendons. An older person can harm those 
things, especially by pounding them on the pavement while running or jogging. 
</P>
<P>
"But the buoyancy of water means you can get an aerobic workout without putting 
any stress on the joints." 
</P>
<P>
Another oldster who believes in the value of swimming is 66-year-old Doris 
Peters of Imperial, Mo., also a participant in the inaugural Senior Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something about the water that is very relaxing," she said by phone. 
"If you run, you may finish exhausted. But if you swim, you finish refreshed. I 
feel like I'm a 66-year-old in the body of an 18-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a retired public health professor at Appalachian State University in 
North Carolina, member of the President's Conference on Physical Fitness and 
Aging, and author of numerous articles on the subject, also had these thoughts: 
</P>
<P>
"The body at any age is biologically meant to move; otherwise it will atrophy. 
I recall breaking my leg skiing in Germany in the 1940s. When the leg came out 
of the cast after eight weeks, it was thin as a pencil. Similarly, in the later 
years of one's life, if the body isn't used, it begins to say: 'OK, I'll just 
shrink.' " 
</P>
<P>
The retired professor pointed out the advantages that today's seniors have over 
those of decades past: "In former days, there weren't nearly as many swimming 
pools, bowling alleys, bike paths, urban walking paths." 
</P>
<P>
Octa DeLamater doesn't need those sort of facilities for her daily exercise. 
Just give her a Nerf ball to pitch or kick or toss into a basket. 
</P>
<P>
DeLamater, by the way, is 105 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Not one to let wheelchair confinement interfere with working out, she shows up 
regularly three times a week in a room near hers at Hollenbeck Home, a 
life-care facility in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
She has a hearing problem, but activity director Betts Hall described the 
remarkable centenarian: 
</P>
<P>
"She is a physical marvel. Up until she was 101, she would lie on her back on 
the floor, and kick both her feet up over her shoulders and her head. 
</P>
<P>
"Octa would also sit in a chair in her room with weights on her ankles, and 
lift her legs. Until a couple of years ago she would walk unassisted through 
the home every day -- and keep records to see how many miles she was piling 
up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Exercising 
</P>
<P>
At 105, this native Kansan can only walk with assistance now, and navigates in 
a wheelchair. But this doesn't hinder her in any way from showing up thrice 
weekly for a half-hour exercise class. 
</P>
<P>
"About 15 residents participate, and they sit in wheelchairs in a circle," the 
activity director said. "Part of the time is spent tossing a ball either to a 
neighbor, or to whoever is in the center conducting the class. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually a portable basketball hoop is brought out, and they take turns 
trying to score baskets. Also, they play a form of soccer. They sit and kick a 
ball to one another. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the others protest because Octa will stretch a leg out and try to 
get in a kick before the ball reaches the person next to her. She is still a 
competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, however, gets to the same destination via the same route. 
</P>
<P>
Chauncey Depew, a U.S. senator from New York at the turn of the century who 
lived to be 94, once said: "I get my exercise acting as a pallbearer to my 
friends who exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Kuraner, age 80, of Sherman Oaks, seems to have the same outlook. "I've 
never done any special exercising in my life," he said. "It has gotten me this 
far, so I figure it'll get me to the end, whenever that is." 
</P>
<P>
Kuraner allowed as how he does sometimes bicycle to the bank or post office, 
but added that he does so because he doesn't like to drive anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically a lazy person," Kuraner said. "My wife wants me to walk more, 
and sometimes I do. But I never make it a habit to do so. I do nothing 
regimented. 
</P>
<P>
"I eat whatever I like. I have never done a diet. I eat eggs every day -- I 
think they are the most complete nourishment there is. I am healthy, and I 
don't see doctors much at all." 
</P>
<P>
You might say that Kuraner marches to a different drummer -- one with a slower 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bob Wiswell, an associate professor of exercise science at USC, touts the 
idea of seniors devoting part of their leisure time to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For cardiovascular endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For maintenance of muscular strength. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For mobility/flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To keep body fat down. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing for the older folks is that they don't have to reach 
exhaustion to benefit from exercise, Wiswell explained. "The younger get 70% to 
85% of maximum heartbeat output, the older can get the same benefit from 35% to 
45%." 
</P>
<P>
Wiswell mentioned Harry Truman's favorite exercise, walking, as something most 
seniors can do. "Walking a mile will burn off 100 calories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Options 
</P>
<P>
"Such people might also consider lawn mowing, riding either a stationary or 
moving bike, swimming, deck shuffleboard, lawn bowling, badminton, folk dancing 
-- something other than just sitting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those looking for statistical evidence should consider the remarks of Dr. 
Everett L. Smith, director of the biogerontology lab at the University of 
Wisconsin: 
</P>
<P>
"Currently, the average individual loses functional capacity at the rate of 
0.75% to 1% a year after the age of 30. . . . In my opinion, about 50% of the 
average aging decline is self-induced by life style, and the other 50% is due 
to the genes or the makeup of the individual biological system." 
</P>
<P>
Although not all experts agree that an exercise program should include running, 
a recent study by the Stanford University School of Medicine seems to dispel 
the notion that the older shouldn't run, because of damage they might cause to 
their knees or hips. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford studied 41 long-distance runners between the ages of 50 and 72, and a 
comparable group of non-runners. The runners, both male and female, had 40% 
more bone material than the non-runners, but showed no significant differences 
in the onset of joint disease or osteoarthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Walking, according to gerontologists, is by far the most popular exercise 
activity for people 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Place, as have some other Southland shopping malls, has begun a 
program to encourage it. Theirs is called Sea Strutters. 
</P>
<P>
"The program is offered from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. Monday, Wednesday, 
Friday," explained Liz Von der Heide of the marketing department. "Walking the 
full length of each of our three levels equals one mile." 
</P>
<P>
Jean and Donald Cotner of San Juan Capistrano do their daily walking at Dana 
Point Harbor. By now they are used to the wisecracks: "Is somebody chasing 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old wife and the 66-year-old husband are both rapid walking buffs. 
So good have they become in their few months at it that they have won prizes in 
three competitions, and will strive in the coming national Senior Olympics -- 
in the 5-K race walking event. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of started by accident," Donald Cotner said. "I had taken up running 
at age 63, and was competing in events for seniors. Two years ago we went to 
Melbourne (Australia) where I was entered for an event. 
</P>
<P>
"I came down with the flu. Had gone all that way, and didn't even get to 
participate in the parade. I was so disappointed I decided the heck with run 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Going Faster 
</P>
<P>
When the Cotners returned home, they did a little recreational walking at Dana 
Point, and in due time they noticed something: They seemed to be walking faster 
than most of the other pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
Which led to race walking. "It's great for the cardiovascular system," Jean 
Cotner said. "Gets your pulse up, and keeps your body moving. 
</P>
<P>
"I still like swimming and bicycling, but walking can be done anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, as she has for 21 years, Jean Cotner teaches yoga classes. "Some 
of my students are seniors. It's a safe way to keep the body flexible and in 
tune." 
</P>
<P>
As for the couple's fast walking, they do about four miles together daily, four 
days a week.
