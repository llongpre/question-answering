<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Gary Parker -- Mercury News; Kim Lenox, a senior art major at
SJS, couldn't get classes this semester to finish her minor in deaf education.
This semester, she had to take classes in swimming and yoga just to have the
12 units necessary to be a full-time student -- and keep her scholarship.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  Budget cuts have made competition for classes so stiff this semester that more
than 3,000 students on six California State University campuses started the
term with no courses at all on their schedules, according to a survey by the
Assembly Committee on Higher Education.;   Instead, students sat in on already
overcrowded classes, or waited in long lines to get courses. Many just settled
for whatever was available, even though it wouldn't count toward their degrees.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's pretty dismal," said Ann Blackwood, a consultant for the committee.; 
 Despite raising fees by 20 percent, CSU trustees were forced to cut $170
million out of this year's $1.6 billion budget. More than 5,000 classes were
canceled and about 3,000 faculty members lost their jobs. At San Jose State
University, more than 500 classes were canceled when 300 instructors were laid
off.;   One fallout is that students are taking even longer to graduate --
costing both students and the state more money in the long run. Even before
the budget crunch, CSU students could count on taking 5 1/2 years to earn a
degree. Now, an increasing number are looking at six years or more to
graduation.;   Kim Lenox, a senior art major at San Jose State, is already in
her sixth year. This semester, she found course offerings so scarce that she's
taking two classes in swimming and one in yoga just to have the 12 units
necessary to remain a full-time student -- and keep her scholarship.;   None
of the three counts toward her art degree. In fact, only one class on her
schedule -- advanced computer projects -- counts, and she's dropped plans for
a minor in deaf education because she couldn't get into the one class she
needed in that field.;   'Not so much by choice'; The scarcity of classes is
why the 23-year-old Lenox has hung around campus so long, "not so much by
choice. But over the years, if I couldn't get a course I needed to graduate, I
would take another course to make up my 12 units.";   Like three out of four
CSU students, Lenox has worked her way through school, clerking in clothing
stores, working in photo labs, assisting a commercial photographer and helping
run galleries on campus. The difficulties of matching class and work schedules
have added semesters to the majority of CSU students' academic careers.;   But
while work has been a problem for most students, 62 percent also said their
graduation was delayed by problems in getting courses in their major. More
than half said they had to wait to get the general education courses they
needed.;   The situation has deteriorated dramatically this year, said Jeffrey
Chang, legislative director for the California State Student Association.;  
Lines at 3 a.m.; "The first week here at Sacramento State, people were lining
up at 3 and 4 in the morning trying to get communications classes," Chang
said. "By the time the sun rose, the line was clear around the building and
over to the library.";   Barbara Pearce, 19, was the ninth person in line
outside the Sacramento communications building. A self-described "third-year
sophomore," she hadn't received any courses through computerized
registration.;   When Pearce finally got into the right office, "they had a
list of about 20 classes there were spaces available in," she said. "I picked
four out of that . . . then I sat in on classes.";   Today she has the five
classes she needs to remain a full-time student and eligible for her parents'
health insurance, but only one counts toward her major in organizational
communications, a business-oriented field.;   'Five with summer school'; "I
was hoping to graduate in 4 1/2 years. Now I'm looking more toward five with
summer school," Pearce said.;   "It is possible to graduate in four years, but
most people who do go to a private school. At any state school, I don't think
it's possible anymore, especially with the budget cuts.";   And everyone pays
when students postpone graduation. The Postsecondary Education Commission
calculates that it costs the state $7,500 for every year it takes a student to
graduate. The longer a student spends in school, the bigger the total bill.;  
"The key thing here is it's the equivalent of a double tuition increase," said
Blackwood, the assembly consultant. "It costs the state more money and it
costs the student more money."  </TEXT>
