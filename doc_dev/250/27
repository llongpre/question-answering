<LEADPARA>  You really brought out the Gunther Gebel-Williams philosophy (Interview, June
2). I only hope you and others could see through his stories. I would like you
to see video footage of the animals at Ringling Brothers Barnum &amp; Bailey being
hit quite brutally with a bull hook. There's a picture of Gebel-Williams
standing on an elephant. I hate to think what it took to "break" the spirit of
that elephant so it will take the domination of Gebel-Williams.;    As
Gebel-Williams said, "They are still wild animals." If they are wild animals
and he doesn't dominate but loves them, why are the elephants chained by their
legs and the other "wild" animals in cages most of the time?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     E.J. Meininger; San Jose;  PREVENTION; "Betrayal of Trust," May 26, does
not detail solutions that can prevent sexual misconduct or other abuses of
power. As the problem is universal, the question of how to respond effectively
to confront such behavior is paramount.;    Research indicates that such
abuses of power can be restrained through education about the problem, through
upholding appropriate standards of ethical behavior and by providing a safe
process for reporting abuse and misconduct. The Iyengar Yoga Institute of San
Francisco has instituted these and other measures to protect its students.;
