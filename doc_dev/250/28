<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 130;   PERSONAL: Married 23 years; she has a 21-year-old daughter
and an 18-year-old son; and lives in Menlo Park;   OCCUPATION: Community and
school relations coordinator, Foothill College in Los Altos Hills;   FITNESS
BACKGROUND: While growing up, summer camp, family vacations and recreation
centered around "fun" competition, Davis says, and she loved participating. "I
tried and took lessons at everything," she says. "I ended up a jock of all
sports and master of none.";   During college, stress from studies and a
fast-food diet took their toll. "I didn't turn into a butterball, but I didn't
look the same." She played tennis and jumped on a trampoline, but did nothing
to promote strength or stamina.;   Two kids and 10 years later, when aerobics
and exercise studios were becoming the trend, it occurred to her that she
should be in better shape. Davis took to aerobics right away and has taken
classes for 12 years. For variety, she alternated aerobics with running, lap
swimming and yoga, modern jazz and ballet for the past 10 years.;   REGIMEN:
Davis' favorite fitness fun has always been aerobics, she says, because of the
level of energy expended during the movements to music. During her lunch hour,
she takes aerobic step and stretch classes three times a week. And on
weekends, she adds a "cardio funk" aerobics class offered at the YMCA in Palo
Alto. She takes longs walks and plays an occasional tennis game.;   RESULTS:
"Some people are surprised to learn I have a 21-year-old," she says. At least
20 years older than the other students in her aerobics classes, she says she
keeps up and "I am really proud of that.";   GOALS: "I would like to have more
muscle definition and shave a couple of inches off my thighs, but as I get
older I'm learning to be less critical of my body -- which is a lot easier to
do when you feel so good.";   OBSTACLES: Planning and packing shoes, workout
clothes and a towel in the mornings before work gives time for pause, she
says. "I just remind myself how good it feels afterward, then throw my bag in
the car anyway.";   TIPS AND COMMENTS: "Good health is the thing I value most
and it's not something I take for granted. We're only given one body and I'm
paying attention to this one."  </TEXT>
