<HEAD>Officials Decide Yoga Isn't Devil's Work</HEAD>

   Officials decided Monday that yoga isn't so
devilish after all.
   During a special meeting Monday night that drew about 100
spectators, members of the Toccoa City Commission, the Stephens
County Commission and the county recreation board decided they
would allow yoga enthusiasts to practice their exercises in a
county recreation center.
   But in an attempt to appease those in this small northeast
Georgia town who believe yoga is a form of devil worship, the yoga
classes will won't be sponsored by the county or funded with tax
dollars.
   The move reversed a decision last week to cancel a class after
some residents complained.
   Phillip Lawrence, a local chiropractor who has led the fight
against yoga, said last week those who practice it are opening the
door to the devil.
   ``The people who are signed up for the class are just walking
into to it like cattle to a slaughter,'' he said last week. ``Half
of yoga is a branch of Eastern mysticism, and it has strong occult
influences.''
