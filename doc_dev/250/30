<HEAD>Opera Lover Who Won Record Shopping Spree Planned It Like a
Military Maneuver</HEAD>

   Given two minutes to gather all the compact discs
she could, Lisa Lyles knew preparation _ physical, mental and
emotional _ would be key.
   So the opera-lover, who won the shopping spree through a bank
promotion, trained for the task. She swam laps for endurance,
practiced yoga for control, figured out how to make her hands
sticky, drew maps of the terrain and developed memory-nudging
devices.
   ``I knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I had to go
for it and meet the challenge,'' Lyles said Saturday.
   In the end, she raced through the Tower Records building Friday
scooping up 60 compact discs, chiefly classical ones, and ran up a
bill of $2,054 during her two-minute allotment _ five times what
the promotors figured each contestant would rake in.
   The 34-year-old Melrose resident was one of three people whose
names were drawn a week ago for a two-minute shopping dash.
   The folks at BayBank had estimated shelling out about $400 per
contestant to promote a new branch. Little did they realize that
lavish boxed sets of some classical music collections go for $250
per.
   ``I didn't do it intentionally, but I was told outright there
were no restrictions,'' Lyles said. ``I knew I could not afford to
purchase 180 boxed sets so I said to myself: `I'm going to hit
these.'''
   Lyles, a fund-raiser for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, spotted
which aisles had the best things, estimated the trips she would
need and made up sing-song ditties to jog her memory about what she
wanted.
   She also discovered that a tacky cloth she and her husband used
to strip furniture gave her sticky fingers. When her time came at
Tower Records, she was ready.
   ``When I see something, well, don't stand in my way!'' Lyles
said. ``Yoga helps you get a hold of yourself, but in the end its
that animal drive and knowing what you want.''
   ``This is her normal way of doing things, only very condensed,''
said her husband, James.
   Jaymes Leavitt, a Northeastern University freshman from Paxton,
eclipsed Lyles' haul by gathering up 86 compact discs, but his
taste was less expensive at a grand total of $1,300 worth of
merchandise.
   Another Northeastern freshman, Edward Monette of West Hampton
Beach, N.Y., was the third entrant, staggering out the door with 59
compact discs worth $900 and weighing about 30 pounds.
   Over the past week, Leavitt and Monette were looking over the
store's second floor layout of $15 hard rock CDs while Lyles was on
the third floor, checking out $250 boxed sets of Bach's organ works
and Wagner's Ring Cycle.
