<LEADPARA>  DISTRAUGHT over breaking up with lover Barbara Hershey, David Carradine threw
himself into the Pacific during a storm in 1975. It threw him back.;   Walking
back to his Malibu house after that Jonah-like experience, he wondered why he
was still alive. "I decided I had to do something," he says.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     His future, he eventually concluded, lay in his past: the Chinese martial
art of kung fu, which he had shown off for five years on network TV. He had
been taking daily formal training in kung fu for a year; now he would delve
deeper into its spiritual aspects.;   The decision has blossomed into a new
goal and a new book, "Spirit of Shaolin" (Charles E. Tuttle Co., Boston),
which he hopes will bring others toward "the way" he still seeks.;   "Kung fu
put me back together, but it's only a preamble to real knowledge," says
Carradine, now 54. "You've got to go beyond that, to the teaching. Within
these moves, and the blending of mind and body, there is an experience that is
somewhat spiritual.";   The book, published this month, returns Carradine to
the fore of a movement he helped popularize. Despite graphically violent films
by the likes of Chuck Norris and Steven Seagal, devotees insist that breaking
faces for revenge is not the point of the martial arts. It is, many believe, a
way to achieve inner peace -- and even a way to explore metaphysical reality.;
  That deeper purpose, Carradine says, is what he hopes readers will

"To me, kung fu is a metaphor -- a way to examine the fabric of the universe
with my fingers.";   Not all martial-arts students have such ultimate goals.
But in thousands of schools nationwide, students are kicking, throwing,
chopping -- and, in many cases, meditating and philosophizing -- their way to
what they believe is a fuller lifestyle.;   Take William Collazo, 19, of North
Lauderdale, Fla., who won three medals last year at the Junior Olympics in
Tallahassee, including two in karate.;   He began studying karate at age 5,
prompted by his father, but his interest went far beyond the physical. This
year, he switched his major at Cornell University from engineering to Asian
studies. He has studied Buddhism and Hinduism, but he especially admires
Jainism -- a Hindu religion 2,500 years old that reveres all living things,
down to the microbe level.;   He says friends sometimes ask if the teachings
clash with his Catholic upbringing. He admits, "I'm going through a period of
questioning my beliefs. Who knows? Maybe I'll come out of this a Buddhist.
Maybe not.";   Most people come to martial arts for non-religious reasons: to
get in shape, beat up a bully, reduce stress. Any reason is fine, according to
Carradine.;   In his book, he writes that kung fu can bring "serenity, lack of
tension, heightened awareness, greater moral fiber, increased will power, less
fatigue, better understanding of oneself and one's environment, better social
relations, confidence, material success, oneness with nature, freedom from
fear, anxiety and boredom, resistance to illness, freedom from vice, increased
longevity and the ability to kick ass.";   In a phone interview, he says the
"kick ass" part is "just a hook to get the young people in." But he points out
that Kwai Chang Caine, also known as "Grasshopper," the Chinese immigrant he
played in the 1971-'75 "Kung Fu" TV series, fought only to defend himself and
others, not to even a score.;   "The real essence of kung fu is not
self-defense but philosophy," he says. "If even two classes can enrich your
life, go.";   He takes his own advice, having broadened his study to seven
kung fu styles, with names such as law horn, ling po and praying mantis. It
was his sifu, or teacher, Kam Yuen, who urged him to write "Spirit of Shaolin"
-- and even offered to write it for him.;   In the martial arts, the
metaphysical both arises from the physical and gives rise to it. The thrust,
counterthrust and whirling moves are often compared to a dance executed with
no thought, only trained responses. "Stillness in movement," one saying calls
it.;   That feeling can transform into mystical, transcendent moments of
"expanded consciousness." Experts say the opponent frequently seems to move in
slow motion, telegraphing his every move.;   Kung fu goes back at least to 500
A.D., when, a story says, an Indian monk started exercising Chinese Shaolin
students to keep them from nodding off during meditation. This developed into
hundreds of methods for armed and unarmed combat.;   Over the next few
centuries, kung fu helped create karate on the island of Okinawa and tae kwon
do in Korea. Japan, which in 1922 adapted karate -- a word meaning "empty
hand" -- already was home to the empty-handed arts of aikido and judo, as well
as the swordfighting art known as kendo.;   More than fighting;   Inevitably,
their Asian practitioners infused the martial arts with philosophy, which
generally teaches oneness with the universe. Some used Zen Buddhism to
cultivate the idea of a mental stillness. Some used the 64 hexagram patterns
in the "I Ching," the Chinese book of philosophy and divination, as the model
for the shifting movements in kung fu. (The patterns are believed to have come
originally from the cracks in baked turtle shells used for divination by
prehistoric Chinese -- something the inventors of the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles probably didn't have in mind.);   The yin-yang symbol, the circular
symbol showing the exchange of opposites in Taoism, became the symbol for tai
chi chuan. The discipline uses movements of opposing animals such as the snake
and the stork as exercises to help stimulate the body's life-force flow. Even
the Japanese samurai saber is thought to have a spirit, imparted by its user.;
  So subtle are Taoistic concepts that many Westerners may never grasp them
fully.;   Missing the subtext;   David Jones, an anthropologist at the
University of Central Florida in Orlando, has studied aikido for 20 years,
including two years in Japan. He also has studied hatha yoga and tai chi
chuan. He cites an Asian maxim not to "confuse the moon with the finger that
points to it.";   Jones' interpretation is that Westerners keep trying to
emulate the surface effects -- the weapons, the "kiai" shrieks, the flying
kicks -- and miss the main point of being at peace with oneself and others.;  
Faced with the cultural gap, some Asian instructors try to Americanize their
teachings. One is Ngo Dong, an entomology professor at the University of
Florida. In 1977, he fled his native Vietnam, bringing his cuong nhu martial
art, which he pieced together from karate, judo, kung fu and other arts.
Today, he teaches cuong nhu in Gainesville, Fla.;   Dong's amalgam also uses
elements of Eastern philosophy, such as a 10-step circle or sphere of learning
derived from Taoism. The circle sees a novice as a "nobody" who becomes a
learner, then an achiever, then a leader and so on, until he finally becomes a
"nobody" once more -- ready to expand further across the sphere.;   But the
philosophy is couched in rhyme, repetition and alliteration to make it
palatable to Americans. An example is his "5 Res's for interrelations" --
responsibility, respect, responsiveness, resolution, resiliency.;   "It's like
cooking Indian, Chinese or Vietnamese," he explains. "All of them have their
very traditional side, but they're wide open, technique-wise. I blended what
was most easy to digest from each.";   In cuong nhu, along with the other
martial arts, Eastern influence is apparent in the use of a mystical life
force known as chi in Chinese, ki in Japanese, gi in Korean. The force,
according to the sages, is in the air and in all living things. In humans, it
can concentrate about two inches below the navel, the body's center of
balance. One aim of meditation and breathing exercises is to "sink your ki" to
this spot, to anchor yourself and prepare to use it.;   Chi packs a punch;
Practitioners say they can use the force to heal with a touch or occasionally
down a student with just a look. Carradine says that in 1976, he accidentally
knocked two people across a room with the flick of two fingers. Kam Yuen, his
kung fu instructor, later taught him to control his chi.;   Is "the force"
real? That's what separates the mechanics from the mystics. Some teachers,
such as Florida kung fu instructor Andrew Chung, see it as a simple natural
law. "Chi is in the air, in the food we eat. When I teach tai chi chuan, I
tell people to feel like they're swimming in the air, that they're connected
outside their bodies.";   Diehard Episcopalian; Carradine -- whose book
touches on mysticism, nutrition and medicine -- says he divorces philosophy
from creed. He still regards himself as Episcopalian, the church into which he
was baptized as a baby. He sees no difference between Taoism and
Christianity.;   "In Christianity it wasn't spelled out; it was demonstrated,"
he says. "Christ was probably the only real example of the Tao ever."  </TEXT>
