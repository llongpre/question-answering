   Communist Party leader Egon Krenz was too
busy to receive him, but otherwise all went well for a swami who
returned to East Berlin on Saturday to retrace a bizarre flight
over the Berlin Wall six years ago.
   Officials at East Berlin's government headquarters on the
near-deserted Marx Engels Platz were nonplussed but welcoming when
Swami Vishnu Devananda showed up in his flowing pink and orange
peace robes to present a thank-you message to Krenz for opening the
Berlin Wall.
   ``They're swearing in the new government right now. Times are
changing and Mr. Krenz is a bit busy,'' an official at the
headquarters explained. ``But we'll see he gets the letter.''
   Swami Devananda later said he received a personal welcome from
Krenz as the party leader left the building, but there was no
official confirmation.
   The swami, head of the Svinanda Yoga Vendata sect based in
Canada, was arrested last time he dropped by in 1983.
   On that visit, he flew over the wall from West Berlin in a
motorized kite with a bunch of flowers, landed in a field outside
the eastern sector and, after six hours under arrest, was sent back
over the wall.
   On Saturday, the 62-year-old swami drove through the Checkpoint
Charlie border post, offering a homemade ``peace passport.'' The
border guard turned that down, examined the real one and then waved
the silver-haired swami and three followers through.
   At the government building, guards smiled cheerfully when the
swami settled down on the sidewalk for a yoga session.
   ``You're very happy now. Last time everyone was uptight,'' he
said.
   In his letter to Krenz, the swami asked for the motorized kite
back. But officials told his followers earlier in the week that it
had been destroyed.
   On Friday, the swami released peace balloons and pigeons at the
wall in a day of commemoration that went wrong.
   The balloons and most of the pigeons flew West and a model plane
built to commemorate the original flight crashed twice before
buzzing round the West Berlin airstrip from where he took off
secretly in 1983.
