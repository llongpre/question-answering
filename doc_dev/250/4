   At the maximum security ward of the state penitentiary in
Walla Walla, Wash., stern prison guards patrol a tiny
classroom. Inside, 16 murderers and rapists are practicing
yoga.
   The muscled and tatooed convicts take deep breaths, stand
on their heads and stretch on mats as they listen to ocean
sounds and flute music coming from a portable tape recorder.

   Big, strong, silent types that they are, the men don't
tell their instructor very much. "But I think most of them
come to yoga class to find themselves and to learn how to
cope with the stresses of everyday prison life," says Sandi
Wicher, an aerobics and yoga teacher at a nearby community
college who each week conducts four classes at the prison,
three in maximum security and one in medium security.
   Because many of the inmate students are built like power
lifters, the Lotus Position isn't even attempted in Yoga I-A,
though it is in Yoga I-B. "One guy in my class has so much
muscle it's really difficult for him to stretch. He just
comes to breathe," says Ms. Wicher.
   About 40 of the facility's 1,800 prisoners are taking yoga
lessons, a surprisingly good turnout as prisons go. Most
prisons don't want it, reports the National Correctional
Recreation Association. "Yoga and prison don't mix," says one
prison official, who asks not to be quoted by name. "It's not
a very macho thing. Real men don't have stress."
   "Put it this way," explains David Montgomery, NCRA
secretary, "We're not exactly rushing to set up yoga classes
{in prisons} all over America."
   Ms. Wicher says teaching yoga in prison isn't much
different from instruction anywhere else: "Convicts are
people, too." Even so, the 40-year-old instructor keeps
physical contact to a minimum. "At the {community} college, I
won't hesitate to physically wrap myself around students to
get them stretched correctly; at the penitentiary, I'll maybe
brush their toes with my fingers. My husband thinks I'm crazy
to want to be in a room with 16 murderers and rapists."
   She has her limits, though. She won't teach convicts in
protective custody, the ones whose crimes are so notorious,
other inmates want to harm them. She says, "I got chills even
hearing their names."
   But Ms. Wicher adds: "I would love to give a class for
prison officials. Many of them smoke and are so out of shape.
But the prison can't afford it."
