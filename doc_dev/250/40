<LEADPARA>  WITH the economy in recession, now's the time to save. And a good place to
start is taxes. Although Congress eliminated most tax shelters and loopholes
in 1987, there still are deductions and credits available for older taxpayers.
Here's a roundup:;    (box) Credit for the Elderly or Disabled: You may
qualify for this credit if, by the end of 1990, you were age 65 or older or
were retired on permanent and total disability and had taxable disability
income during the year. There also are income limitations to consider. Call
800-TAX-FORM to request IRS publication 524, "Credit for the Elderly or the
Disabled" for details.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (box) Credit for Child and Dependent Care Expenses: If going to work last
year meant paying someone else to care for a disabled spouse or a dependent,
then you may qualify for this credit. The amount of the credit ranges up to 30
percent of qualified expenses or your total earned income, whichever is less.
Qualified expenses include those for care provided in your home or in a
day-care center and housekeeping services.;    (box) Deduction for Medical and
Dental Expenses: If you itemize deductions, you can deduct medical and dental
expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income. Some examples
of qualified expenses: insurance premiums for medical and dental care;
out-of-pocket payments to doctors, dentists, nurses and hospitals; and
payments for prescription drugs, hearing aids and dentures.;    (box) Older
Homeowners Tax Exclusion: If you're 55 or older and sold a principal residence
in 1990, you may claim a once-in-a-lifetime exclusion of up to $125,000 of
profit generated by the sale. To qualify, you must have lived in the home for
three of the five years preceding the sale.;    Q I am 65 years old and in
good health except for severe headaches. Recently I had a complete medical and
neurological examination. The doctors found nothing wrong and concluded that
my headaches were caused by stress. They suggested I attend a
stress-management class offered by the hospital. Can stress really cause
headaches? How can I better manage stress?;    A All people experience some
degree of stress, the response of the mind and body to physical and emotional
events. Change, whether positive or negative, can cause stress.;    Doctors
and scientists have studied body responses to stress and found it causes
physical discomfort and can be a major cause of illness. The accumulated
effects of stress have been linked to ulcers and heart attacks.;    When a
person experiences stress, his or her nervous system is activated, pumping
adrenaline and other chemicals into the bloodstream. Breathing becomes shallow
and muscles tense up. If nothing is done to reverse the physical reaction, the
body remains in a state of tension.;    Symptoms associated with prolonged
tension include headaches, hyperventilation, lower-back pain, dry mouth, heart
palpitations, sleeplessness and stomach aches.;    Stress-management
techniques include assertiveness training, exercise, breathing exercises,
meditation, yoga and biofeedback. Consult books and your hospital's
health-education department for information on stress management.  </TEXT>
