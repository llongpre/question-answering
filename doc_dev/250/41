<LEADPARA>  THE pros do it. We should, too.;    Stretching can keep us loose and limber,
able to do more. It can relax us, which is a boon to sleep and stress
reduction. And it can release muscle tension, easing headache or back pain.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Although stretching is an easy way to exercise, exercise tapes often give
it lip service or skip it entirely. So do many joggers and other weekend
warriors -- until muscle pulls send them to a doctor.;    Why stretch?;  Just
the stress of daily life sets up chronic, energy-draining contractions in many
of our bodies' 600-plus skeletal muscles. Both laughing and crying release
that tension by stretching muscles from head to groin. But exercising does it
better, because we tailor the stretches to our needs.;    Youngsters are
naturally limber, but as muscles age and become taut with daily stress,
stretching becomes a path to soothing both body and mind. Some find that this
quiet muscle work, descended from centuries-old yoga positions, becomes a
day's most serene moment.;    Athletes have much to gain, but benefits are
clear-cut even for sedentary people. Physiologists say everyday movements are
harmless to flexible bodies but hurtful to stiff ones. For example, twisting
to exit a car can strain, or "pull," a muscle in the back. Such an injury
could be prevented by daily stretching.;    Recent research at the University
of Texas casts doubts on claims that post-exercise stretching prevents delayed
muscle soreness after hard exercise or other activity. But other studies show
what baseball players already know as they take wide swings with a weighted
bat before stepping up to the plate: Stretching a muscle to about 120 percent
of its relaxed length allows the most powerful contraction possible when the
muscle is used moments later.;    How to stretch;  People unused to stretching
will be stiff and creaky at first. Two weeks of daily sessions, however, even
as brief as five minutes each, can make a body more supple.;    Bouncing, or
ballistic, stretches now are verboten. Physiologists learned the body has a
protective mechanism called the stretch reflex, which triggers a contraction
in response to a sudden stretch, defeating the point of a bounce stretch.;   
Modern advice calls for non-moving, or static, stretching. "On these exercise
videos, when they show someone reaching and saying, 'And stretch! And
stretch!' that's not it. Stretching is when you hold a position," says Gail
Tait, a stretching expert at the University of Michigan.;    In stretching,
regularity is far more important than intensity, coaches advise. Don't strain
while you stretch.;    Coaches and physiologists advise putting tension on a
muscle, then holding for 10 seconds as you relax and breathe rhythmically. And
then, the experts say, stretch slightly farther and hold another 20 seconds or
so, for optimal gains in flexibility.;    For non-athletes, holding a stretch
for the count of three is less boring, and fine if you repeat the move five
times, says physical therapist Carol Greenberg, author of the new "Pretend
Your Nose Is a Crayon and Other Strategies for Staying Younger" (Houghton
Mifflin, $9.95).;    When to stretch;  Some experts say we should stretch
anytime, anywhere. "I know people who stretch in bed while they're still
waking up. I call that the continuation of a yawn," says Bob Anderson, author
of the million-plus seller "Stretching" (Random House, $9.95), a 1975 classic
among fitness buffs.;    Anderson says industrial athletes will feel better
and be more productive and less injury-prone after stretch breaks on the job.
His most recent book is a self-published manual, "Stretching for Working
America" ($7.95; 800-333-1307), written with Sally Carlson, a former General
Motors-United Auto Workers health consultant.;    Others say that only when
done after exercise -- or a thorough, heart-pounding workout -- is stretching
effective in preventing injury.;    Perhaps the best bet is to stretch some
now, more later. Research at Auburn (Ala.) University showed unique benefits
to stretching before and after exercise.  </TEXT>
