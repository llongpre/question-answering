MANY of us soon find that the new year's resolutions we made with much
enthusiasm only a few days ago quickly fall victim to the demands of
business life. But it need not be that way if you derive real pleasure from
the resolutions you make. My suggestion is to replace the stoic flavour of
traditional resolutions with new priorities on improving your quality of
life. The following should all be considered:
Rekindle close relationships. A stress-filled business life can damage
personal relationships. But remember that they are the key to your health
and happiness.
Respect your body and mind and listen to the signals they send you. Sleep
when you are tired and eat when you are hungry instead of out of habit.
Stay active. You may not like swimming and jogging. That's OK. There are
alternative exercises ranging from chopping wood to going for long walks.
Remember, diseases of all kinds tend to hate moving targets.
Make alcohol part of a larger ritual; convivial dinners are a healthy use of
alcohol. Drinking alone is a problematic form of self-medication.
Manage stress. Reading, yoga, music, sex, walking and meditation are
constructive ways to relax.
Quit smoking. There is no easy way out of this one. But if you do smoke,
limit yourself to those cigarettes you really 'enjoy'. And smokers should
avoid alcohol - it lowers their resistance.
Develop hobbies that are totally absorbing, different from your job, fun and
satisfying. If they involve your family, so much the better.
There is mounting scientific evidence that the age-old axiom 'laughter is
the best medicine' contains more than a kernel of truth. Humour is the
easiest way to reduce stress.
Make enjoyment of life a priority. Keep in mind that life is your real
career, not business or a profession.
