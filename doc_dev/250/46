AL MARTINEZ: STRESS AND THE MAHARISHI

<P>
It's a stressful world, and everyone needs a way to keep his head from 
exploding. I saw a head explode once and it isn't a pretty sight. Walls were 
spattered with shards of suppressed rage, sinewy strips of free-floating 
anxiety and small, hairy chunks of an inability to cope. It took weeks to clean 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Some method of reducing tension is obviously necessary if we are to survive in 
today's tense urban environment. There are hundreds of techniques, from 
squeezing rubber balls to screaming in the cemetery where your mother is 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
Someone in our neighborhood, for instance, beats tom-toms occasionally to, one 
presumes, put him or her (or them) into a state of restful meditation. 
</P>
<P>
Others down the block gather to chant in an effort to attain nirvana. The chant 
assumes a humming quality and on certain quiet nights sounds like a horde of 
wasps descending on Sweet Jesus Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
But if it helps ease stress, I say go for it. A Hum and Tom-Tom Band might even 
be in order. 
</P>
<P>
There are dangers to stress-reduction, of course. A friend tried yoga once to 
quiet his Furies and became entangled in a position from which he was unable to 
free himself. His wife was out of town and he was near starvation by the time 
someone found and untangled him. 
</P>
<P>
My point, if indeed I have one, is that there's no safe, sure-fire way of 
reducing stress and finding perfect peace. Unless, of course, you live in a 
City of Immortals. 
</P>
<P>
It's this way. There's a company called the Maharishi Heaven on Earth 
Development Corp. that is promoting the creation of 50 stress-free communities 
based on the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the guru of transcendental 
meditation. 
</P>
<P>
Company headquarters are in Malibu, but you probably already suspected that. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to build tracts in accordance with natural laws, to the extent that 
houses will be placed on sites that utilize cosmic energy and are at peace with 
those spiritual cross-currents that enhance the beneficial purpose of each 
room. 
</P>
<P>
You'll walk into a dining room of such a home, for instance, and enjoy a 
healthy appetite. In the den, your most complex thoughts will snap into focus. 
In the bedroom, you'll feel either sleepy or sexually stimulated. I personally 
feel stimulated in the kitchen, but our house wasn't built under the 
Maharishi's Vedic guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Parks, vegetable gardens, nontoxic building materials and a kind of holistic 
conditioning are expected to create a collective happiness in each City of 
Immortals not unlike that enjoyed in the old days by Ozzie and Harriet Nelson 
on Sycamore Street. 
</P>
<P>
Picture the Nelsons, the Cleavers, kindly Dr. Kildare, Henry Aldrich, Aunt Bee, 
little Opie and the gang from "Father Knows Best" living in the same glorious 
neighborhood and you'll have some idea of what the corporation hopes to achieve 
in its heavenly communities. 
</P>
<P>
Transcendental meditation, or TM, for those ignorant of psychic 
self-improvement, taps one's universal energy to create a state of "restful 
alertness" that clears the mind, improves health and frees you from tension, 
anxiety and stress. 
</P>
<P>
Kinda makes you wanna sing and dance. 
</P>
<P>
I stopped by the office of the Heaven on Earth Co. the other day and talked 
with men in suits and ties who somehow seemed more . . . well . . . serene than 
most people. One was Curtis McDonald, a vice president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
This all began, I was told, two years ago at a gathering in India where the 
Maharishi declared that the problem of war was over and mankind ought to 
concentrate on quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
The concept somehow evolved into real estate speculation that shaped the notion 
of sweet-peace cities, a dozen of which are in various stage of development in 
the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between them and any other high-priced communities, McDonald 
says, is the removal of stress through many means, including programs of 
purification involving diet, exercise, meditation and, of course, the 
Gandharva-Ved music concerts with which we are all so familiar. 
</P>
<P>
When I suggested that stress might be a little difficult to leave behind in 
this era of people with Uzis who do not abide by the principles of spiritual 
fulfillment, he assured me that, in that case, security systems would be 
incorporated into each of the housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
Where good vibes fail, hire guards. 
</P>
<P>
This all sounds pretty good to me and I plan on moving into a City of Immortals 
myself. The possible intrusion of criminal mischief doesn't worry me at all. I 
am confident that Sheriff Andy of Mayberry, and his sidekick Barney, will be 
around to keep me safe and serene.
