Are certain personalities attracted to specific sports? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, says James Gavin, a professor of applied social science at Concordia 
University in Montreal. Our personalities affect our choice of sports, our 
willingness to participate in a sport and how we perform in the sport. Which 
may explain why you're gagging on your weekly regimen of running, aerobics or 
yoga. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain emotional qualities reinforced by the choice of exercise, 
and within that exercise," Gavin says. "It's hard to get people to adhere to an 
activity that doesn't feel right to them." 
</P>
<P>
Define your measure of sociability, spontaneity, discipline, aggressiveness, 
competitiveness, mental and risk-taking abilities, and you'll have a better 
understanding of your sport of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin, who has written "Body Moves: The Psychology of Exercise," says that any 
physical activity can be analyzed in three dimensions he refers to as the 
psychological, physical and body movement domains. Our psychological 
preferences are bolstered by our body type and preference for certain kinds of 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
On Gavin's scale, swimming ranks very high in requiring discipline, and low on 
spontaneity, sociability and mental focus. In other words, once you get 
yourself into the water, you can glide solo on autopilot. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, "Basketball demands you pay attention; you have to be riveted in 
the moment," Gavin points out. "The activity by definition draws certain things 
from you." 
</P>
<P>
Like swimming, running demands discipline, but it's also low on spontaneity, 
risk-taking and mental focus. 
</P>
<P>
Walking may be the ultimate sport for meeting physical fitness needs over a 
broad range of personalities. It can be played either way for spontaneity and 
sociability. It requires little in the way of competitiveness, mental focus, 
risk-taking or aggressiveness, and it offers plenty of opportunity for 
spontaneity and sociability; in other words, walking is tailor-made for the 
individual seeking exercise without commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin's psychological parameters may give you some clues as to why you're not 
enjoying your fitness program, and what you can do about it. But while 
psychological and physical factors may determine what sport you'll enjoy most, 
there are other considerations. Time, convenience and cost also enter the 
picture, Gavin points out. 
</P>
<P>
Scientific research seems to show that a person will be motivated to exercise 
if he or she picks an activity that appeals to him. A study of Harvard 
graduates by a Dartmouth Medical School researcher indicated personality was an 
important factor in determining if an individual would stick with a fitness 
program. 
</P>
<P>
In the March, 1989, issue of Psychology Today, Gavin presented a chart showing 
how various sports and fitness activities rank according to seven parameters. 
Gavin refers to these parameters as Psychosocial Activity Dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin provided a work sheet that allowed us to rank ourselves from very high to 
very low in each dimension. Then we can compare our preferences to his 
evaluation of specific fitness activities. (In evaluating the activity, Gavin 
assumed the individual participates regularly in the sport or activity). 
</P>
<P>
The psychosocial activity dimensions include: 
</P>
<P>
* Sociability: Do you most enjoy being alone or having people around? 
</P>
<P>
* Spontaneity: Are you a quick decision-maker or do you prefer detailed 
planning? 
</P>
<P>
* Discipline: Do you prefer to stick it out once you start something? Or do you 
abandon activities that require continued effort? 
</P>
<P>
* Aggressiveness: Do you try to control events? 
</P>
<P>
* Competitiveness: Do you enjoy competitive situations or shy aware from them? 
</P>
<P>
* Mental focus: Are you able to concentrate on one thing when you want or have 
to? 
</P>
<P>
* Risk-taking: Do you enjoy taking risks or do you prefer tried-and-true 
approaches? 
</P>
<P>
Answering such questions gives us a clearer idea of how well our sport suits 
us, and why certain sports won't satisfy us. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem in determining an individual's sports personality is that 
people may play the same sport in different ways. An individual's behavior 
pattern in sports may be either participatory or competitive, according to Dick 
Lister, a clinical psychologist and sports psychologist in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"The participatory golfer may be on the course as much to enjoy its aesthetic 
qualities, the trees and the lakes, as he is to put the ball in the hole," 
Lister explains. "The competitive golfer may see the lake because his ball is 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
The participatory and competitive categories are roughly equivalent to the Type 
A and Type B behavior patterns with which we're familiar. In their book, "Type 
A Behavior and Your Heart," Drs. Meyer Friedman and Ray H. Rosenman define the 
Type A behavior pattern as an "action-emotion complex" in anyone "aggressively 
involved in a chronic, incessant struggle to achieve more and more in less and 
less time." 
</P>
<P>
There's also an environmental element to Type A behavior, the physicians say; 
an individual may behave in a hard-driving fashion only in certain situations, 
for example, at work, or on the racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
An individual with a Type A personality who is trying to relieve some of the 
stress his behavior creates, may want to choose a sport that doesn't lend 
itself easily to competition, Gavin says. What the Type A character may need is 
a dose of playtime -- going out to walk streets he has never traveled before or 
maybe going fishing. 
</P>
<P>
"While (their favorite sport) may benefit them cardiovascularly, it may not be 
the best psychologically, because it reinforces qualities they already have an 
abundance of," Gavin says. "The Type A personality will go into a sport with 
real aggression. From health to performance to super performance in a very 
short time. If a Type A takes on a Type B activity, it quickly becomes a 
performance contest." 
</P>
<P>
But while the participatory athlete may be more relaxed than the competitive 
athlete, both may be benefiting from their approach to exercise. The 
competitive athlete doesn't have to consider taking the participatory approach 
unless he's doing damage to himself, Lister says. Competitive jocks are usually 
having a good time improving their performances. It's when the obsession with 
improvement actually leads to declining performance that things get weird. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers believe different personalities prefer different movements. 
</P>
<P>
"Type A movements are typically quick and linear, a sudden changeability as 
opposed to a flow," Gavin says. "The movement would be more in tune with 
racquet games or running than with yoga or t'ai chi. A Type A individual will 
gravitate toward those types of movements. There's a quantitative, performance 
emphasis." 
</P>
<P>
The Type B personality has a different attitude toward movement. "More likely 
you'd find them doing activities with more enjoyment to them, and with more 
movement flow," Gavin says. "Type B's may be runners, but they won't be likely 
to enter races with the same emphasis. (And) they might be more varied in the 
routes they take." 
</P>
<P>
While sports can be played in either a participatory or competitive fashion, 
some require more concentration than others even in the participatory mode. If 
you want to escape the pressures of your own personality, choose your sport 
wisely. After all, it's all in fun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S YOUR SPORT PERSONALITY? 
</P>
<P>
Matching your personality with your sport of choice will increase the 
likelihood that you'll stick with it, says Dr. James Gavin, a professor of 
applied social science at Concordia University in Montreal and author of "Body 
Moves: The Psychology of Exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Bodybuilders are characterized by Gavin as people who are persistent despite 
the obstacles. They don't like to change plans and they try to control 
situations by being forceful. Downhill skiers, on the other hand, are very 
social people who love spur-of-the-moment decisions. Sticking with things is 
difficult for them but they love a challenge and taking risks. Where do you 
stand?
