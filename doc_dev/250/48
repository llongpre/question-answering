<HEAD>American Calls Off Milk Bottle-Balancing Walk Due To Upset Stomach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A health food store manager from
New York said an upset stomach today kept him from trying to beat
his previous world record of walking with a bottle of milk on his
head for 32 miles.
   Ashrita Furman, of Queens, who has more listings in the Guinness
Book of World Records than anyone else, was going to perform the
feat on the track at Independence Stadium.
   ``I was throwing up and having diarrhea all night long,'' Furman,
35, told reporters.
   He said he will take another shot at the record later this month
when he travels to Chiangmai, Thailand on a tour by the Queens-based
Sri Chinmoy Center for meditation, yoga exercises and culture.
   Furman, who has rolled, hopped, jumped, rowed, clapped, skipped,
somersaulted and balanced his way to 11 world records, was presented
a ``versatility'' record by the Guinness Book of World Records in
1987 for having records in more categories than anyone else in the
world.
