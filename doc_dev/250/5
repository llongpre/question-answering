<LEADPARA>  THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT yoga is a series of physical exercises -- twists,
balances and stretches -- designed to help people feel better.;    The long
answer is too long to go very far into in this space.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Yoga developed as part of the Hindu faith; it has many branches, each with
its own esoteric liturgy that requires many pages to explain.;    The branch
concerned with twists, balances and stretches, as well as meditation -- the
branch that interests many Americans who get into yoga -- is hatha yoga.;   
Yoga came into being in India over the course of centuries.;    According to
Yoga: The Technology of Ecstasy, by Georg Feuerstein, the discipline has roots
in the northern Indian peninsula, at least 2,000 years ago, when priests did
complicated ritual chants, which needed to be done with absolute accuracy if
the gods were to hear and respond. Techniques for breathing and concentration
came out of the need for precision.;    The goal of hatha yoga students is
physical well-being and/or spiritual grace. Many yoga books, such as the
recent one by actress Raquel Welch, put almost all their emphasis on physical
improvements.;    Some students report that physical improvements lead to a
deeper feeling for spiritual things. A few people plunge all the way into
yoga, pursuing, sometimes for decades, its ultimate promise -- transcendence;
an intense feeling, writes Feuerstein, of "God-realization, or
Self-realization.";    The most eloquent description of yoga written in this
century is the 600-word foreword that violinist Yehudi Menuhin did for B.K.S.
Iyengar's book Light on Yoga. Menuhin writes, "The practice of Yoga induces a
primary sense of measure and proportion. Reduced to our own body, our first
instrument, we learn to play it, drawing from it maximum resonance and
harmony. With unflagging patience we refine and animate every cell as we
return daily to the attack, unlocking and liberating capacities otherwise
condemned to frustration and death. . . . Whoever has had the privilege of
receiving Mr. Iyengar's attention, or of witnessing the precision, refinement
and beauty of his art, is introduced to that vision of perfection and
innocence which is man as first created." Iyengar has codified a school of
thought about how best to teach and perform hatha yoga. He focuses on
extremely precise movements of muscle and bone; emphasizes strength, stamina,
stability and balance; places considerable importance on several standing
poses; and uses specially designed props, such as benches and ropes.;    There
are many other schools of thought today created by other gurus. Within the
yoga community, differences in these approaches are discussed with some of the
fervor of 11th century Christians debating the existence of the Trinity, or
SDS factions seeking the true path to revolution in dorm rooms at Columbia in
the spring of '68.;    To the layperson, distinctions between yoga schools
might appear confusing and unimportant; yoga teachers are aware of this, and
there have been efforts toward ecumenism. Some other styles of instruction are
Integral Yoga; Viniyoga, the style followed by respected Marin County teacher
Richard Miller; and Divine Life, the Chidananda branch of which is followed by
popular TV teacher Lilias Folan.;    The overall health and image of yoga in
America today appears to be robust and shock-proof, judging from steady, often
increasing numbers of students at many schools; consistent sales of numerous
books; and daily yoga TV shows.;    The circulation of the bi-monthly magazine
Yoga Journal, based in Berkeley, has steadily grown from 300 when it was
launched in 1975 to 60,000 today.;    Despite celebrity followers and daily TV
shows, the yoga community sees itself as outside the mainstream of American
life, and therefore treads carefully. It worries, for example, about attacks
and criticisms by some Christian groups. Some fundamentalists consider yoga a
branch of Satanism or a "doorway for Satan," according to the religious tract
Prepare for War, by Rebecca Brown, M.D. And in December 1989, the Vatican told
Catholics they should not substitute things like yoga and Zen for Christian
prayer.  </TEXT>
