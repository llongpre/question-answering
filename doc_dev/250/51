<LEADPARA>  THE farther you travel down an unassuming street in Cupertino, the quieter it
becomes. And once inside the gates of the Marianist Center, five acres of calm
hovering in the foothills above the suburban sprawl, the quiet transmutes into
a profound stillness.;    You have stepped into another world: lush gardens, a
serene cluster of low-lying buildings, filled with museum-quality art,
inspirational books, tasteful furniture. There is a greenhouse-enclosed
swimming pool, whose roof opens to the sky.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A leather-bound book contains the rules of the house and some gentle
advice:;    "We ask that you use the gardens and the healing waters of the
pool and jacuzzi with reverence and respect for the quietness they offer. They
will sing to you the wonders of God's graciousness and wrap you tenderly in
the womb of Creation.";    The Marianist Center is the newest -- and perhaps
the most opulent -- of scores of retreat centers that dot the Northern
California landscape. Operated by a variety of religious denominations, these
spiritual spas are not necessarily vacation getaways designed for
entertainment. What they offer is a room of one's own and something beyond
peace and quiet: the solitude necessary to grow, to be healed and to find the
holy.;    Some of these places -- such as the Jesuit Retreat House in Los
Altos or the Tassajara Zen Mountain Retreat in Carmel Valley -- have been in
existence for decades. Others, like the Marianist Center, were originally
designed to meet the spiritual needs of Marianist priests and brothers.;   
But the dwindling numbers of Catholic clergy led the Marianists to decide this
year to open their retreat center to the public. The center was financed when
the Marianists sold a 400-acre parcel of land in the Santa Cruz Mountains and
built over the past 20 years by members of the order.;    Brother Joe Aspell,
a Marianist artist and architect, designed the place. Its 24 single rooms for
overnight guests have fireplaces and private patios; its chapel is designed to
be used by people of all faiths and its meeting rooms, available for secular
groups, are filled with Aspell's eloquent statuary, paintings, stained glass
windows and calligraphy.;    "It's a place for people of all ages and faiths
who are seeking spiritual growth. It's for people who want to engage in honest
dialogue and experience a deeper spiritual awareness," says Mimi Latno,
director of the center. To accomplish those goals, Latno, a former teacher at
San Jose's Notre Dame High School, has devised a variety of modestly priced
programs led by visiting therapists and spiritual mentors. They offer
everything from stress management workshops to daylong devotional retreats for
families.;    But in addition to programs and workshops, the Marianist Center
offers people a calm and quiet place to simply rest.;    "Caution! People
asleep. God at work," reads another entry in the visitor's guide. "Stories
like Sleeping Beauty encourage us not to fear passive periods in our lives.
They say to us that quiet growth is also possible and is good growth.";   
Though the center is open to all faiths, Latno says its somewhat
unconventional approach to spirituality -- exploring Eastern and Western
mysticism and New Age concepts such as yoga and massage therapy -- is of
particular relevance to Catholics who have been divided in recent years into
conservative and liberal camps and in conflict over questions of sexuality and
guilt.;    Brother Patrick McMahon, a former missionary to Japan who runs the
Center's office, says it's important for people of all faiths to learn
spirituality from each other -- not in hopes of winning converts, but in
achieving inner peace.;    "There's a real need, particularly in this
hardworking, high-stress environment, for people simply to get away, pray and
have some quiet times for themselves," McMahon says. "Man, it seems to me, is
always looking for his maker. And providing people the opportunity to look
inside themselves and find God, we will be fulfilling our purpose."; IFYOU'RE
