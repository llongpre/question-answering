Everywhere you look, someone is promising to take your stress away.
Consultants and health centres offer hypnotherapy, relaxation tapes or mud
baths. In this atmosphere, it is easy for companies to assume that their
employees will take care of stress on their own time. But when does stress
become so severe that it is a company's responsibility to take notice?
'The scenario when someone disappears from work, or when the men in white
coats show up, is an extreme sign that stress has become unbearable,' says
Paul Litchfield, assistant registrar at the Faculty for Occupational Health
in the Royal College of Medicine.
But stress is something that mounts, and some companies believe that the
time to act is long before things get bad. Marks and Spencer, the UK
retailer, has just piloted a 'Managing Pressure' programme, designed to
teach employees, from senior management through to the shop floor, how to
cope with an 'unprecedented' set of pressures from inside and outside the
job.
'We thought it would be better to get to people in training programmes while
it was still pressure and not stress,' says Sally Young, executive for
health and welfare at M and S.
Dr Celia Palmer, a former member of M and S's head office occupational
health staff, and Steve Williams, an organisational psychologist at Resource
Systems in Harrogate, Yorkshire, designed the programme, which was piloted
last October among 17 supervisors and sales assistants in one of the
company's Midlands stores.
Palmer and Williams based the programme on the Occupational Stress
Indicator*, a questionnaire that gives individuals a comprehensive picture
of their 'stress profile'. Respondents answer 167 questions on job
satisfaction and personality, such as: 'Generally and at work, do you
usually feel relaxed and at ease or do you tend to feel restless, tense and
find it difficult to settle down?'
Resource Systems produces a three-page report on all the sources of an
individual's stress. For M and S, Williams and Palmer have developed a
'workbook' which would advise employees on how to deal with the pressures
identified by the OSI, and a workshop to advise employees on how to cope
with the issues raised in the OSI and the workbook. M and S plans to train
managers and occupational health advisers to facilitate the programme.
The workbook offers some familiar stress reduction methods: relaxation
techniques, physical exercise, hobbies, tapes, yoga. It also suggests
strategies for time management, improving relationships with colleagues, and
coping with corporate change.
Litchfield warns against companies using such programmes to let them off the
hook. 'It is very easy to concentrate on how stress affects the individual,'
he says. 'But really you have to go back and see how the company exacerbates
stress. Just telling the person on the shop floor to listen to some
relaxation tapes is not going to address the source of the problem.'
Palmer says, in M and S's programme, workshop facilitators will find out
what employee concerns are and feed the information up to management.
In March, participants in the pilot filled in the OSI again. Williams found
that their job satisfaction had improved by about 9 per cent. Now the
company has to figure out how to evaluate the programme's effectiveness.
Individual progress can be measured by the OSI, but measuring the
bottom-line return on investment for the company is more difficult.
To date, the company has spent Pounds 40,000 on developing the programme and
expects to spend another Pounds 100,000 for a full launch.
M and S ultimately hopes to measure changes in sickness absence, staff
turnover, accident rates, customer satisfaction, and employee productivity.
But Williams says: 'There are not any panaceas here. We are not trying to
remove all stress or pressure. The programme has limited objectives to help
people manage pressure. We know there is a relationship between pressure and
productivity so we are hoping that these kinds of things will come out in
the measurement figures as we put these programmes into more stores.'
