<TEXT>     Does your bumper sticker say "She who has the most scheduling conflicts
wins?";    In the 1980s, a lot of people discovered Type A behavior and
decided it was the thing to have. Beginning in the '90s they overloaded even
more, going for A-plus behavior plus a gold star. Where stress had been their
middle name, now it was frantic.;    The only good datebook was a full one.
Too much white space could be damaging to your image. It was an embarrassment
to be available, even for a relative, on anything less than a week's notice.; 
  Recognizing that Americans despised any moment left unfilled, some
supermarkets announced last winter they would install TV sets at checkout
counters.;    If you needed an indication that overbooking was damaging the
country's health, this was it.;    The idea was that bored customers might
prefer entertainment, including commercials, of course, over just zoning out
by the gum display.;    Unrecognized was that for many people the grocery
store is the last peaceful refuge. The only unproductive minutes some people
get is waiting behind some slow shopper who forgot some exotic dog food and
wants to cash an out-of-town check.;    Based on the same belief that people
can't relax without several things to do, gyms installed TVs in workout rooms
and attached video screens to exercycles.;    This trend has begun to alarm a
small but fierce minority who believe in daydreaming and futzing around.;   
These rebels decided they were going to change things and declare their own
personal time-outs.;    Among each other they began to whisper, "Make an
appointment with yourself.";    One woman, so inspired, took an entire day
off, not to study Russian or paint the bathroom, but to get a massage. She lay
there listening to bird and butterfly music as warm hands nudged the walnuts
from her neck and shoulders. She had her toes pulled like taffy and her brain
realigned.;    When she could speak again, she recalled the words of comic
Carrie Snow, "If women ruled the world and we all got massages, there would be
no war.";    Another who is in the high-pressure business of labor organizing,
raising a young child, giving speeches and going to community meetings,
recently added one more essential to her punishing schedule.;    Every week
she writes down "Meeting with Helena," which only she knows means time away
from the phone to go to a movie and eat popcorn. Or to sneak back home and
read a chapter in a novel. Or drive to the beach.;    In her work,
discouragement is always waiting. "Fear is born out of fatigue," she says.
Scheduling herself two uninterrupted hours "to take care of me" strengthens
her for all the others in her life.;    In a recent survey, Americans, even
work-crazed boomers and yups, said they could use more unclaimed hours in
their day. Where they'd put them varied. First choice was on exercise and
recreation. Then came family, and down on the list, 30 percent said they'd
like more time for meditating and thinking.;    Time to think and fantasize,
without a video suggestion, is what we gave up when we decided that an
unscheduled moment is unproductive, that the alternative to busy is empty.;   
Remember playing hooky? Mental health days? Remember "just hanging out?";   
This return to sloth and hedonism may be catching on. A new ad for running
shoes preaches the joys of taking a break and "time to take care of
yourself.";    Meditation, the once popular non-activity of another era, is
coming back as a way to relax with your favorite person. Mainstream magazines
sing its benefits as good for the soul and the psyche and not bad for the
complexion.;    Practitioners, the formerly crazed, call it the perfect
antidote to Call Waiting.  </TEXT>
