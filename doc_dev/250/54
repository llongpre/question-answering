The hypnotic voice of qigong master Zhang Ruming floated through a hall packed 
wall-to-wall with 300 working-class Beijing residents. 
</P>
<P>
"The lotus flower endlessly grows," Zhang intoned. "The lotus flower envelops 
you. Think, 'I am the lotus flower. The lotus flower is me. . . . The lotus 
flower is all of nature.' " 
</P>
<P>
Everyone seemed lost in quiet meditation on the soothing words, rich in 
Buddhist imagery. But no one considered this a religious meeting, at least not 
openly. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the crowd had come in the belief that they could receive healing 
benefits of the master's qi -- the vital energy of life. They believed that he 
had the gong -- the skill -- to control this force and impart it to them. At 
the start of the meeting, a dozen people had offered testimonials to Zhang's 
healing power. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering reflected an explosion of interest in qigong (pronounced 
CHEE-goong), a blend of Chinese medicine, Buddhist and Taoist philosophy, 
magicians' tricks and traditional exercises that is quickly expanding to fill a 
deep spiritual void in Chinese life. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities here view the phenomenon with a nervous mixture of respect and 
fear. Qigong is not a political force. But it pulls people together in loose 
associations that are not government-controlled. Some observers believe that it 
could ultimately challenge the Communist Party's wide-ranging grip on social 
life and that this, in turn, could have unpredictable political consequences. 
</P>
<P>
It is generally estimated that there now are at least 60 million practitioners, 
up from a few hundred thousand a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The strongest organizations in China today, after the Communist Party, are the 
rapidly growing qigong associations," the respected Hong Kong-based 
China-watching magazine Contemporary recently declared. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional religion in China was suppressed by the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung, 
who instilled in its place a fanatical belief in his own power. Then, Deng 
Xiaoping replaced the cult of Maoism with economic reforms, promoting a 
widespread conviction that China was on the road to prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
But Deng's own prestige, and that of the Communist Party over which he 
presides, was among the casualties last year when the People's Liberation Army 
fired on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. People were left with nothing 
to believe in. Especially in the cities, where disillusionment struck deepest, 
many are turning to qigong. 
</P>
<P>
 At its most fundamental level, qigong is based on deep-breathing exercises. 
These can be used simply to keep fit. They also are used in meditation and for 
the concentration of energy that medical qigong claims can be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
The exercises themselves, which fit into a well-established pattern of morning 
calisthenics, enjoy official approval. Performances of qigong tricks, such as 
breaking bricks with one's head, are routinely offered as public entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Respected physicians sometimes credit qigong with healing powers. An 
international symposium on qigong and health will be held in Beijing in 
November. It is widely believed that senior leader Deng, 86, is himself treated 
by a qigong master. Some Chinese say this explains why he has lived so long. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese media have printed articles warning of qigong's dangers, 
including risks of hallucination and mental breakdown. As part of a broad 
effort to bring qigong activities under official supervision, sweeps have 
recently been made of exercise classes in public parks, with instructors 
required to register their names. 
</P>
<P>
Qigong gatherings of more than 1,000 were banned after several 1988 rallies in 
Beijing drew up to 15,000 frenzied participants who writhed, screamed, laughed 
or cried as masters projected qi upon them. But this ban failed to stop 
qigong's spread. 
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper, the China Daily, reported in August that there are now 
200,000 to 300,000 adherents of qigong in Beijing alone, with 23 institutions 
conducting teaching or research into the discipline. Only one of these centers 
had registered with the proper authorities, the article complained. In 
addition, it said, there are more than 200 "guidance centers" with more than 
600 instructors in public places such as parks. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine has launched a 
program to license all medical-related qigong activities, and "anyone working 
in breach of the rules would be severely punished," the article said. 
</P>
<P>
The report also stated that eight medical qigong clinics have already been 
ordered to close this year, and two individuals "have been detained . . . on 
charges of swindling." 
</P>
<P>
Fears of political instability have helped prompt such assertions of government 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"Qigong is a popular folk religion with very strong indigenous roots," Stan 
Rosen, a professor of political science at the University of Southern 
California, commented during a recent visit to Beijing. "With no other belief 
system left in China, it fills a vacuum. It can spread extremely rapidly in a 
situation where people don't believe in the government. I think that's why the 
government is afraid of it." 
</P>
<P>
Rosen noted that several episodes in Chinese history provide precedents for 
growth of powerful mass movements based on religious or quasi-magical beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most famous of these was the so-called Boxer Rebellion of 1900, an 
anti-foreign uprising launched by members of a secret society that practiced a 
discipline called "Boxing of Righteousness and Harmony." Practitioners believed 
that Taoist magic made them invulnerable to foreign bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"The Boxers thought they were invincible," Rosen noted. "The qigong people have 
a similar belief. The qigong people believe anything is possible as far as 
curing illness. . . . At a time when the government is emphasizing stability 
above all else, these kinds of movements are very dangerous. The 
dissatisfaction is so strong, and the lack of control is so obvious now, 
there's fertile ground for something like qigong to take root." 
</P>
<P>
Qigong practitioners generally do not deal with political issues, however, and 
even religious aspects are usually ignored or downplayed. While acknowledging 
that the discipline has roots in Buddhism and Taoism, most masters insist that 
in China today, qigong is primarily a science and a theory of life. 
</P>
<P>
"Qigong has something to do with religion, but there is a difference between 
the two," said Chen Linfeng, a qigong master who founded a branch of the 
discipline called Huiliangong ("The Skill of Wisdom and the Lotus"). 
</P>
<P>
"Qigong is just a name, while its contents are varied," Chen said. "For 
instance, qigong can keep people fit, which is something on the surface. It can 
be used to cure patients, which is something deeper. It can also produce new 
wisdom. That is the deepest aspect. Qigong is not a religion, but a kind of 
theory. It is the theory of wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
Chen added that in his view, Buddhist meditation, the Taoist search for 
immortality, Christian prayer and Hindu yoga all incorporate elements of 
qigong. He also noted that qigong has developed against a background of 
government promises of religious freedom made when China's economic reform 
program was launched in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Chen's own life provides a glimpse into a shrouded world of mystics that 
survived the violent anti-religion campaigns of the 1966-76 Cultural 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1962, Chen learned his art growing up in the countryside. At the age of 
5, he started learning qigong exercises from his father. A few years later, he 
said, there rose in his mind the image of a bearded old man, a master who could 
teach him much more. Then one day he met a Buddhist monk, a faith healer, "who 
looked exactly the same as I imagined," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I became his last pupil," Chen said. "I told him I wanted to cure patients 
(like he did). . . . He asked me to set my mind to saving all living creatures 
from a sea of bitterness." 
</P>
<P>
The year that the Cultural Revolution ended, Chen, still only 14, began his own 
career as a faith healer, he said. In recent years he has focused on spreading 
knowledge of qigong rather than offering cures. 
</P>
<P>
"Qigong is a way to wake up people," he said. "If all of society attains a 
correct understanding of things, then power struggles and wars will disappear. 
This is because you are me and I am you. Someone older is my father or my elder 
brother, those younger are my little brothers, just like a family. All of 
society will be equal, as in the Buddhist Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
At the opposite end of the spectrum from such philosophical musings is qigong 
entertainment based on alleged supernatural powers. 
</P>
<P>
Yuan Xiyin of Beijing's Orient Qigong Troupe put on such a performance at a 
recent variety show, balancing his body on a large metal trident with the 
sharply pointed middle prong pressed against his stomach. The stunt began with 
the claim that should Yuan lack true qigong, he would surely be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Such tricks contribute to an atmosphere in which most Chinese credit qigong 
with capabilities unexplained by modern science. But they also provoke a 
backlash. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper "Health News" recently ran an expose of qigong stunts such as 
walking on balloons or sending shocks of electricity through people's bodies. 
Fu Weizhong, a qigong master, was quoted as explaining that these performances 
depend on mechanical principles or hidden equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Qigong is a treasure of the Chinese nation, but now it has become a tool used 
by quacks and swindlers," Fu lamented. 
</P>
<P>
Most adherents of qigong are not too interested either in philosophy or stunts. 
They have aches or illnesses, and they want cures. 
</P>
<P>
"I have tumors all over my body, which relate to each other just like a net, 
but since I've come to this course my neck has become flexible and my back 
pains are relieved," said a middle-aged woman at Zhang's qigong meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A young man in the crowd credited Zhang's power with curing him of a hacking 
cough. A paraplegic man, hope in his voice, said that attendance enabled him 
first to feel pain and tingling in his legs, then a sensation as if worms were 
climbing up his body. 
</P>
<P>
Zhang claims that in a clinical study, his type of qigong eliminated gallstones 
in more than 30 out of 50 patients. 
</P>
<P>
He explained the treatment this way: "Qigong masters conduct their brain waves 
to patients, who are asked to lie down in a state of complete physical and 
spiritual relaxation. . . . The energy comes from the hands and brains of the 
qigong masters." 
</P>
<P>
Such techniques "are part of Chinese traditional medical treatment," Zhang 
said. "But people usually acknowledge only herbal medicine and acupuncture. Now 
we should restore another part, that is qigong." 
</P>
<P>
Qigong is also credited with more mundane benefits in daily life. 
</P>
<P>
Wei Qing, a young amateur photographer, said she gets fresh ideas for pictures 
by reading a book of qigong poetry called "Daily Songs of Spiritual Linkage." 
Like some prayer guides in the United States, this book has one poem for each 
day of the calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
Long Ying, creator of these songs, said they are based on five mystical words 
that his father and grandfather learned decades ago from a Taoist monk, who 
used them in treating Communist guerrillas injured in battle with Japanese 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
"The seriously wounded could avoid death, ease their pain and restore their 
health," Long said. "My ancestors wrote down these things." 
</P>
<P>
For those who must know how or why, there is no real answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Qigong, this science, is a profound mystery," Zhang declared to his enraptured 
audience. "Many things cannot be explained."
