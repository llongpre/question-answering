<LEADPARA>  Now that I have started my semester at San Jose State University I have
learned to face facts that I refused to face before. We students are learning
how to take notes while standing or sitting on hard, cold tile. We are
learning to heed signs posted on doors of empty classrooms, canceling a
section or entire courses. This is not what we should be learning.;   Our
professors are overwhelmed the moment they enter overcrowded classrooms full
of eager faces hoping to complete their education in a reasonable time span.
Students are dismayed at the number of classes in which there is not even one
more available spot.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Room should not have to be made. If a class fills up, another section
should be added. Thousands of students, who have already paid their tuition
(including SJSU's latest semester increase of almost $100), are suffering.;  
Education is our privilege and our right. When we invest millions of dollars
to support our colleges and universities, we expect to see positive results.
Why are courses eliminated when there are thousands of us, staggering
students, trying to keep up? Student determination alone accomplishes nothing
when there are no funds to hire competent teachers or offer sufficient number
of classes.;   Tuition hikes haven't accomplished anything. We have lost
hundreds of needed classes and competent professors. Those conditions are
unfair to students who pay for their education.;   These problems are
precisely what will hinder the United States' ability to compete against more
highly educated countries in the future.;   I fear for the future of this
country if our educational system continues to slide further into mediocrity
and decay. Please help us.;   -- Lara Aziz; Sophomore; San Jose State
University; (hbox); The article "CSU cuts wreak major havoc" treated a very
important subject, but while it was well done, it left me with a couple of
questions.;   Why are the classes that the students do not need available,
while those that they do need are not? How can a budget crunch explain
students' taking classes they do not need? Don't those courses cost the state
money too?;   I think it might be interesting if you would investigate the
extent of this mismatch.;   In addition, it might be interesting to consider
whether it would be more beneficial for the students to pay more tuition to
have courses available.;   You pointed out how extending the time in college
costs the state more money. It seems obvious that this at least contributed to
the present situation by further sapping the budget.;   But might it not also
be cheaper for students to pay more tuition and get through with their
education in a shorter time? Would it be financially better for a student to
get a loan, pay more tuition, finish in four years, get a jobs, and pay back
the loan than to work at part-time jobs while going to school for six years?; 
 -- William F. Egan; Cupertino; (hbox);   In these times of CSU cutbacks and
class reductions, what are swimming and yoga still doing in the catalog?;  
While I realize that various courses should be made available to well-rounded
individuals and that classes such as these may serve a purpose in a student's
overall physical and intellectual fitness, I wonder about the timing of such
offerings.;   It seems to me that if programs and staff must be trimmed, the
trimming should take place around the edges.;   -- Linda Isenburg; San Jose  </TEXT>
