   Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh may have fallen
on hard times, but reports that he is chauffeured to work in a
lowly Mercedes-Benz just aren't true, says a spokeswoman for the
Indian guru once famous for his Rolls Royce collection.
   ``We would never dream of asking Bhagwan to ride in a Mercedes.
Only a Rolls Royce will do,'' Ma Yoga Neelam, personal secretary to
Rajneesh, said in a statement issued here Thursday by his U.S.
press service.
   The guru makes the quarter-mile commute between his house and
the meditation hall at his Pune, India, ashram in a 1986
custom-built Rolls Royce Silver Spur equipped with a stereo,
videocassette recorder, color TV, refrigerator and bar, she said.
   The 21-foot limo has a silver exterior and walnut-inlaid doors
and matching mushroom-colored leather upholstery inside. However,
its standard lambswool carpet has been replaced with a synthetic
one because of the guru's allergies.
   Rajneesh, 56, who describes himself as the ``rich man's guru,''
moved to India in 1985 after pleading guilty to U.S. immigration
charges.
   During the 4{ years he headed a commune in central Oregon,
Rajneesh accumulated a fleet of more than 90 Rolls-Royces. They
were sold after the guru pleaded guilty to immigration fraud
charges and was deported and his commune disbanded.

   Maxine was shy and nervous, her legs
trembling as her brown eyes surveyed the crowded room.
   Then, the audience burst into applause as Bucks County
commissioners honored her on ``Maxine the Heroic Dog Day''
Wednesday in suburban Philadelphia.
   The 4-year-old, 91-pound, black-and-brown Doberman was not shy
in the early hours of March 28, when fire erupted in her family's
home in Quakertown.
   The dog, once an abused stray, ran back and forth through heavy
smoke to awaken two sleeping children and lead them to safety. She
was burned on the back and one paw in the process. Quakertown Fire
Chief Fred W. Guenst credited her with saving the lives of George
Roeder III, 14, and his sister Jessica, 12.
   Their parents, George Jr., 33, and Deborah, 30, were at work
when the fire broke out.
   ``Max woke us up. She was running back and forth and jumping up
on my bed, and she was whining and barking and pulling on me,'' the
boy said. ``I woke up and I saw the fire. My bed was on fire.''
   Maxine got Jessica up in a similar fashion and the children and
dog fled to safety.
   ``Without the dog, the children would have perished, there's no
doubt about it,'' Guenst said. ``The dog absolutely saved their
lives.''

   ``Wonderful Wednesday'' is no more at Mercer
University.
   For 20 years, no regular classes were scheduled on Wednesdays,
and the class-free day became known as Wonderful Wednesday at the
Macon school.
   But wonders ceased this week, said Barry Jenkins, Mercer's dean
of student affairs.
   Last spring, Mercer's Council of Undergraduate Deans decided to
switch from the quarter to the semester system. In the process, the
council did away with the midweek break, which was intended to give
students a day to catch up on studies and pursue other academic
enrichment.
   School officials, however, felt the day off was not being used
wisely, and ``Wonderful Wednesday'' also restricted the college's
academic calendar.
