FITNESS BACKGROUND: For years Whitely says she was "a big size 12" who carried
around an extra layer she didn't need hidden under her clothing. She enjoyed
recreational activities, but exercise as a daily ritual had never been a part
of her life.;    As her 40th birthday approached, Whitely decided she wanted
to reach that milestone on March 26 as "powerfully as possible." She sold the
"heartbreak" truck an ex-boyfriend talked her into buying and bought a sports
car, kicked her 20-year smoking habit, bought an exercise video and turned her
attention "to my old bod.";    "I was amazed at how quickly results came. My
stamina increased, my upper arms had more definition and my body felt tight."
Eager to escalate her progress, she bought rollerblades and a mountain bike
and began to make good use of them and the "neat geographical layout" at
nearby Shoreline Park during her lunch hours.;    REGIMEN: "Regular exercise
has helped me find my internal clock," she says. "I wake up super-early to a
pocket of time when my mind is most capable of absorption." After a period of
serious reading, she does a 35-minute exercise video workout.;    During her
lunch hours, she spends 40 minutes twice a week skating on her rollerblades in
a neighboring parking lot. The other three days, she climbs hills on her bike
in the park. Half-way through her ride she stops to do yoga stretches.;   
After work, she feeds her cat and heads straight to the pool to swim for a
half-hour. At the end of the evening, she saves time for another half-hour
video workout.;    Down to a size 9, she says, "I eat only when I'm hungry and
enjoy more 'alive' foods like spinach and sprouts.";    RESULTS: "I don't have
to wear camouflage clothes anymore -- I can wear anything in my closet. While
most people peak in high school and college, I seem to have peaked late in
life. Forty just keeps getting better.";    GOALS: "To become a goddess -- why
not? -- by crafting the inner and outer body. It's not a cerebral thing. My
heart's really into it this time and there's no turning back.";    OBSTACLES:
"People and relationships are very important to me, so I'll drop my routine in
favor of a friend or a luncheon engagement. It's like brushing your teeth --
if you skip flossing one day, your teeth aren't going to fall out.";    TIPS
AND COMMENTS: "I don't play mental games to exercise. Everything I do is fun,
which makes my routine seem effortless."  </TEXT>
