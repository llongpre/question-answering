<LEADPARA>  HOW boring is exercise?;   It is so boring that every couple of months or so,
someone comes up with a new way to get you out of the chair and moving. We've
gone through jogging, swimming, walking, bicycling, tennis, yoga, tai chi,
rock climbing and dancercise, and when interest waned, the exercise
enthusiasts got creative.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     They introduced the treadmill to oblivion, the rowing machine in dry dock
and stairs to nowhere. And the thought of Suzanne Somers squeezing her thighs
together as she sits at a party could give one pause over the chip dip.;   But
perhaps the weirdest new entry into the fitness phase is the step bench. It's
a small platform 4 to 12 inches off the floor on which you step up and down in
time to music.;   I was in my 20s when my schoolteacher husband and I
chaperoned a group of high school seniors to Washington and New York. The
highlight of the trip was a visit to the Washington Monument. The minute these
kids saw a 555-foot obelisk of white marble rising out of the earth, they knew
what they had to do. Climb it. All 898 steps to the top.;   As they returned,
gasping for air, red-faced, the steam rising out of their raincoats, I made a
vow that I would never be that stupid.;   I have stuck to my words. A
two-story house we bought was sold after three years. They tell me there were
beds on the second floor, but I never got through all the laundry and the toys
stacked on the stairs waiting for someone to go up.;   If an elevator is out
of order, I am prepared to tough it out on that floor until it is fixed. I
don't even do curbs.;   One of the problems with "stepercise" is that there is
no cute costume to appeal to the shallow people like me who exercise to look
cute. It takes a lot to get a woman in a pair of Spandex shorts with a
thong-leotard over them to go out in daylight.;   I'm not being critical of
gimmicks to get people on their feet and into motion. It's hard to keep coming
up with incentives to keep you focused on your body. But don't be surprised to
pick up your gym newsletter one day and see:;   "FIRE ANTS: 8 a.m., Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays. High-impact aerobics for medium to advanced. Jump in
pain to lively show tunes with a 'Saber Dance' tempo. Relieves muscular
tension and tightness as real fire ants bite bottoms of feet in special thong
shoes. Warm-up and two-day cool-down suggested."  </TEXT>
