<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 130 pounds;    PERSONAL: Divorced; has two children, three
grandchildren and lives in San Jose;    OCCUPATION: Office manager, Metalfab
in Santa Clara;    FITNESS BACKGROUND: "I've always been loaded with energy
and anxious to try new things," Burrow says. Until she moved from the
Sacramento Valley 10 years ago, her list of "adventures" included water
skiing, tennis, horseback riding and jumping, aerobics, running, weight
lifting, tap dancing and ballet. "I even tried belly dancing.";    But the
only activity she sustained, she admits, was her smoking habit.;    After her
divorce, however, she turned to another form of exercise: yoga.;    REGIMEN:
For the past seven years Burrow has been practicing Hatha yoga in the Iyengar
tradition, a style that emphasizes posture and body alignment, breathing and
relaxation. She attends classes three times a week. The series of exercises
she does to incorporate the body, mind and spirit requires precise attention
to movements and postures. "It's not like counting one, two, three, four as
you're doing sit-ups. And it's not competitive or repetitive.";    She also
practices at home several mornings a week and at work when she feels stress.
Burrow walks two miles, rain or shine, during her lunch hours. If she and a
friend miss their brisk walk after work, they make it up at Rancho San Antonio
on the weekend with a five-mile hike.;    RESULTS: "I feel healthy, happy and
more mentally balanced." And because yoga made her feel like she should "walk
her talk," she kicked her 30-year smoking habit four years ago.;    GOALS:
"You're never 'there' in yoga, regardless of your age. It's wonderful
discovering you are able to go beyond what you thought were your limits.";   
OBSTACLES: "Nothing. An occasional birthday party, maybe. Otherwise I try to
plan obligations around my routine.";    TIPS AND COMMENTS: "I plan to
practice yoga for the rest of my life. I've never felt more energy,
enthusiasm, zest and joy than I do now and am looking forward to the
challenges left in my life."  </TEXT>
