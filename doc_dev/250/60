   A priest who has mixed liberal New Age
philosophy with Roman Catholic doctrine has been sentenced to a
year of public silence by the Vatican, according to a published
report.
   The Rev. Matthew Fox, who has said he wasn't afraid to be
labeled a heretic, will not be permitted to speak publicly or
publish his writings for a year, effective Dec. 15, according to a
report in the National Catholic Reporter, a liberal weekly
newspaper.
   Fox, 47, is the founder of the Institute in Culture and Creation
Spirituality at Holy Names College in Oakland. He scheduled a news
conference for Thursday to discuss the Vatican's action.
   Dan Lattin, a religion writer for the San Francisco Chronicle,
described Fox's curriculum in the paper's Tuesday editions as
having a ``heavy emphasis on Christian mysticism, feminism and
environmentalism.''
   The Vatican, according to the National Catholic Reporter, has
ordered Holy Names College to sever its ties with Fox's institute.
School officials said they will issue a statement after Fox's news
conference.
   Fox has irked conservative Catholics by hiring faculty members
that include a certified masseuse, a Zen Buddhist, a yoga teacher
and a self-described witch named Starhawk, the story said.
   Fox's teachings include a book called ``Original Blessing'' that
criticizes traditional church doctrine for an ``overemphasis'' on
sin and redemption.
   When news of a possible Vatican investigation was reported in
1985, Fox said he was ``not upset if people call me a heretic.''
   ``Joan of Arc was condemned, burned at the stake and then
declared a saint,'' the Dominican said then.
   Fox's teachings have been under review by Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, whose Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ordered
the Rev. Charles Curran dismissed in 1986 from the faculty of
Catholic University in Washington, D.C., for doctrinal liberalism.
   Ratzinger's office was once called the Holy Inquisition.
   Action against Fox could revive tensions between the Vatican and
the U.S. church that surfaced during the Curran controversy and
after Rome disciplined liberal Seattle Archbishop Raymond
Hunthausen.
   The National Catholic Reporter said Fox will partially defy the
Vatican order by taking a one-semester sabbatical.
   ``This work is just too pressing to be postponed until a
neurotic papal regime dies out,'' Fox was quoted as saying. He
reportedly referred to the Vatican action as ``a compliment. It
shows our influence is growing so much that they feel threatened.''
   Fox has based his writing in part on the ideas of Meister
Eckhart, a German Dominican who died in 1327 and whose teachings
were condemned as heresy in 1329 by Pope John XXII.
   Fox has denied his ``creation spirituality'' is the same as
pantheism, the belief that everything is God and God is everything.
Pantheism is considered heresy by the Catholic Church.
   Fox's institute, which he founded in Mundelein College in
Chicago in 1978 and moved to Oakland in 1983, offers a master's
degree in spirituality and has instructed scores of priests and
nuns.
