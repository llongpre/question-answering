<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 165 pounds;    PERSONAL: "Very single," he says, which is good
because he has to travel a lot. He lives in San Jose.;    OCCUPATION:
Professional tennis player;    FITNESS BACKGROUND: While growing up in a house
next door to the Los Altos Golf and Country Club, Simone says he loved to
watch people play tennis. At age 7, he got his turn with a racket he retrieved
from a trash can there. For the next two years, Simone collected tennis balls
on the courts in exchange for lessons. He played well in all the sports
offered in school, he says, but during the summers he lived on the tennis
court for 4 to 6 hours each day.;    "I always felt there was something
special about me as an athlete," says Simone. And it was confirmed when he was
offered a scholarship after his junior year in high school to Florida's
prestigious Bollettieri Tennis Academy -- "a concentration camp," he says,
referring to its intense program.;    After graduation from high school, he
competed in the French circuit before returning to California to continue his
education. At Foothill College he was part of the second-ranked doubles team
in the nation among junior colleges. This impressed the University of Arkansas
and earned him another scholarship. Simone was there a year, earning A's and
B's and juggling his studies, his sport and his social life, when he decided
to quit -- temporarily -- a year short of earning degrees in philosophy and
psychology in order to pursue tennis professionally.;    For the past year and
a half, he has competed in satellite circuits throughout the United States and
abroad. His goal is to qualify for the Volvo men's tournament in San Francisco
next year. He's currently ranked 787th in the world.;    REGIMEN: After a
stretching and stationary bicycle workout at an athletic club six mornings a
week, he's on the court by 9 a.m. for 2 1/2 hours of tennis. He spends two
hours, three afternoons a week with his coach in San Francisco. And when he
gets home, he runs five to seven 6-minute miles around a track. (If he's
tired, he slows his pace to a 7- or 8-minute mile.) An hour of weight training
at the club on alternative days is followed by speed and balance drills on the
tennis court with an aerobics teacher. Because the sport is so intense, he has
started practicing yoga to learn to relax. He sleeps from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m
during the week, but on Sundays, "My racket and tennis shoes are locked in the
closet!";    RESULTS: "I feel like a gladiator with a net. Everything is in
balance physically, mentally, nutritionally and holistically and I am ready to
win.";    GOALS: "To play center court against the top seed at Wimbledon. And
I'll have to win more than once -- otherwise, people will think it was a
fluke!";    OBSTACLES: "Some mornings I wish it was raining because I don't
want to get out of bed. But because I have pushed myself to the limit many
times, I know what my body can do and when it needs a rest.";    TIPS AND
COMMENTS: "My full-time love and commitment is to tennis for now. I've always
been a good student, so when my peak has passed professionally, I will finish
school."  </TEXT>
