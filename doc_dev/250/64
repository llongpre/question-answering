<LEADPARA>  OK, SO it doesn't have the sex appeal of "Wild Orchid" or the thrills of "The
Terminator." But the Smother Brothers' "Yo-Yo Man" video is selling quite
well, thank you.;    So are videos on wallpapering rooms, house-breaking dogs,
firming figures and cooking stir-fry. Nearly a fifth of all pre-recorded
cassettes sold are "instructional" -- covering everything from cooking to
aerobics. And the market's growing.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There are tapes on yoga, yogurt, decks and doctoring. There's even a
five-volume set of "The Audubon Society's Video Guide to Birds of North
America." Why wander around in the woods when you can see all the birds you
want on TV? And why bother with terrible, low-tech things like books?;   
There's even -- yes -- a video on how to operate your VCR. Which brings to
mind a rather Zen question: If you don't know how to use your VCR, how do you
watch the video?  </TEXT>
