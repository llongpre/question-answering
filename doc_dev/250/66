Patti Davis, Ronald and Nancy Reagan's estranged daughter, is now estranged 
from her husband, it was reported today.

Davis, 37, has been living apart from yoga instructor Paul Grilley, whom she 
married Aug. 14, 1984, for about a month, the New York Daily News said. "They 
are divorcing," a friend of Davis told the newspaper. Davis' acting career 
failed to take off, and she turned to writing novels -- first with "Home 
Front," an unflattering parallel of her family, and then "Deadfall," a thriller 
about Nicaraguan policy. Neither pleased her parents, according to reports.
