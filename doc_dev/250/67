   Heroin addict Keith Scofield had three
choices: Go to jail, go to Colorado for drug treatment, or check
into a monastery.
   He chose the latter, Dai Bosatsu Zendo, a Buddhist monastery
sitting atop a mountain in the Catskills about 80 miles northwest
of New York City.
   Scofield is about a third of the way through a self-imposed
two-year sentence as a Zen novice, using 2,500-year-old meditation
techniques to relieve his craving for drugs.
   ``If I had gone back into drug treatment, I would have wound up
back in jail, or dead,'' says Scofield, 31, a heroin addict since
he was 13. Five previous drug programs had failed him.
   ``The reason I got lost into drugs is that I didn't care,'' he
adds.
   In Colorado, he would have spent two years in a boot camp-style
program, where, ``I would have been thinking, `Don't just shave my
head and have me scrub floors with a toothbrush. Give me something
new, something to be excited about.'''
   Scofield's foray into Buddhism began a year ago, when he was
sitting in Loudoun County Jail in Virginia. He was jailed in June
1989 after he was caught shoplifting, a violation of his 1988
probation for drug possession. That drug arrest came after he
overdosed on heroin.
   In his cell, Scofield began reading Zen manuals and meditating.
After five months, he went before a judge who gave him two options:
five years in prison or two years at the Colorado military camp.
Scofield, encouraged by the tranquillity he had found through
Buddhism, suggested a monastery as a third alternative.
   The judge agreed, with the understanding that if Scofield left
the monastery before his two years ended, or if he broke the monks'
rules, he would be jailed for five years.
   Last December, Scofield was freed and exiled himself to the
remote monastery, which can be reached only by a 20-mile trip up a
winding, narrow dirt road. His case was assigned to a New York
probation officer.
   Since then, Scofield's days have begun at 5 a.m., with a regimen
of chanting, meditation, manual labor, yoga and spartan vegetarian
meals.
   ``Some people thought I somehow scammed my way out of a prison
sentence,'' Scofield says. ``But if I had chosen jail, I could have
just sat tight, done my time and walked out.''
   He also could have been paroled in less than two years.
   Conventional drug treatment gave Scofield the rational reasons
to quit drugs, but no emotional or spiritual ones, he says. A year
was the longest he stayed off drugs after conventional treatment.
   The introspective searching of Zen philosophy fills that void,
he says.
   ``Drugs are a symptom. You've got to come to a deeper
realization of the truth,'' says monastery vice abbot Junpo Dennis
Kelly.
   Kelly, who was reluctant to let Scofield come to the monastery,
now gives 2-to-1 odds that Buddhism will help him overcome his
addiction.
   ``At first I said, `He's a junkie, and junkies break down,'''
Kelly says. ``You've got to be desperate to come here, because this
is spiritual graduate school. But Keith's been a very, very good
student.''
   Kelly says his own background as an LSD manufacturer and user
makes him sympathetic to Scofield. Kelly spent a year in federal
prison in the 1980s for drug trafficking.
   Scofield could be a pioneer for the monastery, which may take in
more criminal drug users. That would have been unthinkable two
years ago, says abbot Eido Roshi, who founded the traditional
Japanese monastery in 1976. But the monastery is ``Americanizing''
itself, blending Zen spiritual tradition with Western worldliness.
   Drug rehabilitation experts say they had never heard of anyone
trying to overcome addiction at a monastery, but conceded that
different addicts need different handling.
   ``Recovery is a journey for anyone who is addicted, and people
take different paths in their recovery,'' says Jane Fedderly,
spokeswoman for the Hazeldon Rehabilitation Center in Center City,
Minn.
   ``The name of the game is recovery. I wouldn't knock what he's
doing.''
   Scofield's well-ordered 16-hour days are at least as taxing as
the boot camp that awaited him in Colorado, he says. And monastic
life is far more strenuous than life in prison or a conventional
drug program.
   Yet he's approaching his new life with zeal. The day begins with
group chanting before the monastery's carved wooden Buddha. After
breakfast, Scofield works chopping wood, painting, repairing walls
and ceilings.
   Four hours of meditation are spread throughout the day, the
longest period coming before the lights go out at 9 p.m.
   ``I really got lucky,'' Scofield says. ``I didn't know what sort
of place this would turn out to be. I remember thinking, what if
it's an old barn with 20 monks sitting in a circle chanting. But
then I thought, it really doesn't matter as long as I change my
life. What I had before wasn't really much of a life.''
