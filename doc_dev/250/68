<LEADPARA>  It used to be that being a Sikh and riding a motorcycle in California were not
mutually exclusive. Which is to say that turbaned riders whizzing up Highway 1
may have caught the attention of tourists but not of police.;    But next
January, say two followers of the Sikh Dharma religion in Monterey, all that
will change. A state law requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets will go into
effect, putting the yoga-teaching Sikhs into the kind of legal posture they'd
just as soon avoid.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At issue, say 20-year motorcyclists Guru Bir Singh Khalsa and Sada Nam
Singh Khalsa, is their religious freedom. They say they can't wear helmets
because they obscure the cotton cloths wound around their heads as a symbol of
religious faith.;    "My turban is my symbol of my spiritual crown, and I'm
not willing to negotiate with that," said Sada Nam Singh Khalsa.;    A
spokesman for California Assemblyman Richard Floyd, D-Gardena, who introduced
the motorcycle bill that was approved in May, said all this talk of religious
freedom is just a stab by helmet law opponents at cracking the new
regulation.;    "As soon as you exempt them," said Bob Terry, legislative
assistant to Floyd, "you're going to have the Hells Angels joining up with
that religion fast, if you know what I mean. Shoot, they'll start a whole new
chapter."  </TEXT>
