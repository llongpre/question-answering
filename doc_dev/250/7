   A vegetarian diet, quitting cigarettes,
moderate exercise and up to an hour a day of yoga meditation can
help reverse heart disease symptoms without the use of drugs,
according to a California study.
   Dean Ornish, a professor of medicine at the University of
California, San Francisco, said that instead of using any drugs, his
program forced dramatic changes in lifestyle to bring a significant
improvement in the health of patients with coronary artery disease.
   The program is radical, he admits, but for the small group
tested, it worked.
   ``For many who have heart disease,'' said Ornish, ``the
conventional therapy (which includes drugs or surgery, some diet
revision and exercise) may not go far enough.''
   Ornish outlined his research in a paper presented Monday at the
annual meeting of the American Heart Association.
   He devised a strict program that started with a week of training
and preparation, a vegetarian diet that was less than 10 percent
fat, and 16 hours a week of group therapy. Patients who smoked were
required to quit. A moderate exercise program, usually walking, was
devised individually for each patient. And, to manage stress, the
patients were taught yoga meditation and relaxation exercises.
   To test the concept, Ornish put 50 patients with coronary artery
disease into two groups. All were tested to find the condition of
their arteries, how well their hearts were supplied with blood, and
the amount of cholesterol in their bloodstream. Cholesterol is a
fatty material in blood that can lead to clogged arteries.
   For those in the first group, Ornish provided the traditional
lifestyle care, which included some counseling on how to lower
cholesterol levels, controlling high blood pressure and quitting
smoking.
   The second group, however, was placed on what Ornish called ``a
very demanding regimen'' of lifestyle changes.
   ``We were asking them to make huge changes in their lifestyle and
then evaluated the effects'' using high technology X-ray and imaging
techniques, he said.
   The program started with a seven-day retreat during which the
patients were evaluated by a psychologist and by exercise experts.
They were taught how to use yoga to relieve stress, and were placed
on the strict diet.
   After the retreat, the group met for eight hours, two days a week
for instruction sessions in exercise, yoga and food preparation.
   ``We provided the low-fat food for some in take-home
containers,'' said Ornish. ``They found it was not as hard as you
would think. The group support goes a long way.''
   At the end of a year, 29 patients completed the testing analysis
_ 12 in the lifestyle changes group, and 17 in the ordinary care, or
control, group.
   For the control group, the arterial lesions, or clogging of
vessels supplying blood to heart, grew worse. Vessels that were 44.1
percent blocked closed further, to 46.2 percent blocked.
   For the lifestyle group, the progression of the disease was
halted and some arteries measurably opened up, providing additional
blood flow to the heart. They went from an average of 44.4 percent
blocked to 40.8 percent, a clear regression improvement in the
artery health, said Ornish.
   ``There was a significant decrease in blockages in the lifestyle
treatment group and a significant increase in blockages in the
control group,'' he said.
   Ornish said he used yoga and other stress control techniques
because earlier studies have shown ``emotional stress can play a
role in increasing and reducing lesions.''
   Also, he said, ``stress can increase cholesterol (in the
bloodstream) regardless of diet.'' Ornish said studies have shown,
for instance, that cholesterol rates go up for drivers during auto
races and for students during final examinations.
   ``Yoga is an ancient way of managing stress,'' said Ornish.
``It's very practical.'' He said patients were urged to meditate an
hour a day.
   Cholesterol counts in the treatment group declined from a median
of 227 milligrams per decaliter to 135, well below the recommended
maximum of 200.
   Patients in the study were aged 40 to 74, he said, and those who
were the sickest seemed to be helped the most.
   ``The blockages that were the most severe seem to improve the
greatest,'' said Ornish.
   The California scientist cautioned that though the results were
encouraging, they are preliminary, and that the number of patients
was too small to draw final conclusions on the value of the
treatment system.
