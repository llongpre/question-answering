<LEADPARA>  YOU STINK; I almost slipped up and addressed this letter to one of your
writers. I'd not like to repeat his name for fear of adding to his infamy.
Mercury subscriber though I am, it is mostly to get the Fry's Electronics ads,
so don't get uppity.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     San Jose is a neat city, and getting better. But it is not San Francisco,
and it never Caen be. To ameliorate the polemical tone in the article, ("The
Reign of Caen," June 9) let me recount that I once wrote a letter about a
funny thing to Herb, and he published it. With my name and, boy, was I proud.
And he or his staff immediately sent a thank-you note, which I treasure. This
is not exactly pandering to the high and mighty. Herb has aged -- and you know
what will happen one of these years. Nevertheless, and until then I hope, he
writes a nostalgic column that many of us in Northern California enjoy.;   
Cheery bye. I hope you guys at the Mercury News rot in hell for attacking one
of my personal favorites.;    Patricia M. Boyd; Livermore;  COMPROMISING
POSITIONS; I found "Betrayal of Trust" (May 26) to be highly provocative,
somewhat informative, but more a vendetta than anything else. Why
sensationalize your local yoga community?;    In the process of opening to
higher states of consciousness, people run into personal problems they have
tried to avoid. Often, they run into their desire to give a guru or teacher
too much power over their lives. I appreciate your reminding people to take
responsibility for themselves, because no organization is ideal, no teacher is
totally pure.;    Emma Bragdon; Soquel  </TEXT>
