Last summer, the mall was the cool place to hang out in Thousand Oaks. Sure, 
some teen-agers liked to meet at the bowling alley for a few sodas. But The 
Oaks Mall was the place to be. 
</P>
<P>
But not this summer -- or at least that's what Maggie Heidenthal, 12, and her 
friends say. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to meet here now," said Heidenthal, lounging on a couch at the 
Thousand Oaks Teen Center on Janss Road at California 23. "We just wasted money 
at the mall." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Wi, 12, added: "Besides, we could get bad habits at the mall, like 
smoking. We can't do that here." 
</P>
<P>
Since the city-sponsored Teen Center opened eight months ago, 300 to 400 
teen-agers frequent it each day -- far surpassing city expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks paid $3 million to build the 13,000-square-foot facility, which 
includes basketball courts, pool tables, video games and a weight room. And 
city officials say the center has been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased," Mayor Alex Fiore said. "We feel that the teens have a 
place they can call their own." 
</P>
<P>
In the evenings, the center usually is packed. Youngsters lounge on bean bags 
and watch movies or MTV. Others play pool or Ping-Pong. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Recreation and Park District, which runs the center for the city, 
sponsors dances twice a month, sometimes attracting 700 teens. A volleyball 
club, indoor soccer, jazzercise and beginning yoga are also available. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is a fee for some of the classes, most of the activities are 
free. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Dodwell, the teen service coordinator, said when he was in high school in 
the early 1980s there was little for teen-agers to do. Now the center fills the 
void. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have a place to have positive interaction," Dodwell said. "It's a 
necessity of life." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Corinne Michel -- visiting friends at the center -- said, 
plainly: "We could be home vegetating and watching soap operas." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the center was first brought up in 1981 by several students and 
park district officials, who formed a committee with city officials to discuss 
their plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a lot of legwork" to get the facility started, said Joe Hinsberg. But 
after dozens of meetings, construction began in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The center is the only one of its kind in Ventura County. Thousand Oaks plans 
to build a similar facility for senior citizens. Until the seniors' facility is 
completed, the city wants to sponsor activities for them at the Teen Center 
when the teen-agers are in school. 
</P>
<P>
Dodwell said there have been a few incidents of vandalism at the center, but 
the problems have been minor. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth (Gypsy) Strauss, 15, said she used to hang out at the bowling alley. 
Now she spends her free time playing pool at the Teen Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I even won the tournament," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Gaines and Kevin Perry, both 12, say they like to play basketball at the 
center. But "sometimes the big guys chase us off the court," Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
Wi said she has one small complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they turn the MTV down too low."
