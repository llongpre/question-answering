   A Dominican priest who espouses a New Age
brand of Catholicism said a yearlong public silence imposed by the
Vatican is the act of an unhealthy institution that ``may even be
already dead.''
   The Rev. Matthew Fox, founder of the 11-year-old Institute for
Culture and Creation Spirituality, said he would abide by the
sentence of silence that begins Dec. 15 for as long as he could.
   But he lashed out at the Vatican, charging that its apparent
intolerance of his views were those of a patriarchal church
``already demonstrating the characteristics of a dysfunctional
family.''
   ``The promise of openness, of collegiality, of the trust of the
spirit operating among those working in the world, has been
forsaken (by the church) on behalf of a rigid authoritarianism,''
Fox said at a Thursday morning news conference.
   Fox said such an institution ``is no longer healthy. It may even
be already dead.'' He suggested the Catholic Church will die as an
institution unless it adopts democratic practices, adding that he
eventually may be forced to renounce his priesthood because of his
views.
   The internationally known author and lecturer said he will take
at least a six-month sabbatical, although his Dominican superiors
in Rome and Chicago recommended a minimum of one year. He will
travel to Latin America, but would not say what his plans would be
after that.
   Although reacting angrily to the order, Fox said he considered
it an honor that places him in the company of Galileo and Thomas
Aquinas, who were ordered silenced by the church in their lifetimes.
   The punishment from the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine
of Faith, headed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, prohibits the
47-year-old priest from preaching, lecturing or teaching. He can
write, but not publish.
   The Vatican called Fox's esoteric mix of Christian mysticism,
feminism and environmentalism ``dangerous and deviant teachings.''
   Those include criticisms of traditional church doctrine for an
``overemphasis'' on sin and redemption; calling God a ``Mother'';
endorsements of various forms of pantheism; and support for
homosexuals.
   Fox has said he favors optional celibacy for Catholic priests
and the ordination of women. Both are major deviations from the
Roman Catholic Church's positions.
   He also has irked conservative Catholics by hiring faculty
members who include a certified masseuse, a Zen Buddhist, a yoga
teacher and a self-described witch named Starhawk.
   The controversy over Fox's silencing may further strain
relations between some members of the U.S. church and Rome, some
Catholic officials indicated.
   Those relations already are tense because of Ratzinger's 1986
order to dismiss the Rev. Charles Curran from the Catholic
University faculty in Washington for holding views on sexual ethics
that deviate from traditional church teaching and Rome's
disciplining of liberal Seattle Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen for
apparent laxity in pastoral administration.
   The National Catholic Reporter, an independent paper that first
reported the silencing last week, said in an editorial in today's
editions:
   ``People cannot be told to stop thinking or recording their
thoughts. Silencing efforts come from another time.''
   The U.S. Dominicans have not condemned Fox. Instead, they
concluded after a special three-person commission reviewed his work
in 1984 that he was not a heretic, said the Rev. John Gerlack of
the order's headquarters in Chicago.
   ``The commission had minor criticisms, some suggestions that
things should be qualified or balanced, but in the end the
conclusion was there was not sufficient reason that he should be
condemned for heresy or condemned or silenced,'' Gerlack said.
