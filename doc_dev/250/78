   Health issues among gays and lesbians, including
concerns about high alcohol and drug dependency rates, are on the
agenda for 1,500 people gathered here for the 10th National Lesbian
and Gay Health Conference.
   The five-day conference and AIDS Forum will provide participants
with ``a knowledge of the needs of the lesbian and gay community,''
Ellen Ratner, president of the sponsoring National Lesbian and Gay
Health Foundation, said as the meeting began Thursday.
   One concern is drug dependency and alcoholism rates among
lesbians and gays, which are ``at least twice and probably thrice
the national average,'' said Ratner, the founder of New England's
Wollaston II Psychiatric Day Treatment Center.
   ``It's probably because we're forced to hide so much. It's hard
for us to come to grips with ourselves and it forces us into
closets,'' Ratner said. ``And people who are in closets, or they're
oppressed, they drink, they drug.''
   Members of various organizations can make contacts during the
conference, and prominent members of the community will be honored,
she said.
   Among those to receive awards are Rep. Barney Frank and Rep.
Gerry Studds, two openly gay Democratic congressmen from
Massachusetts. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., is scheduled to
address the conference Monday.
   Events range from banquets and Yoga exercises to more than 350
diverse forums.
   Phil Carsmel, a member of Australia's National AIDS Advisory
Council, said he had attended the International Conference on Aids
in Stockholm last month and hoped to learn more about America's
fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome during the Boston
meeting.
   AIDS, which has no known cure, is spread primarily through
sexual contact or contaminated intravenous needles shared by drug
abusers.
   ``Stockholm is the theories, this conference is the practice,''
said Carsmel, a Melbourne resident. ``This is where we translate
the ideas into the real world.''
   Susanne Morgan, a sociology professor at Ithaca College in New
York, said she attended the conference to meet other educators and
to learn about new materials she could use for presentations to
student lesbian and gay groups she advises.
   ``I want to do some networking,'' Morgan said. ``I want to meet
people doing work among campuses.''
   When the first conference was held in Washington in 1978, fewer
than 200 people attended.
   ``The swelling numbers tell us there are a lot of people
concerned, that there are a lot of people that want to continue to
learn, that this is a community that needs to network with each
other,'' Ratner said. ``We're a community that's really starting to
come together.''
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Nicaragua denied visas to three
members of that country's Health Ministry who had planned to attend
the conference.
   Ratner said the three were members of a technical advisory team
on AIDS. The visa denial, she said, ``denied us _ and the world _
the value of their knowledge and experience.''
   The visa refusals were based on concerns that the three
officials might not return to Nicaragua, State Department spokesman
Ben Justenfen said.
