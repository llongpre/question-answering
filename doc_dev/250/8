FT  27 FEB 93 / How to Spend It: For healthy bodies - and healthier minds

ONE OF the curious things about the health and beauty business is that most
people - four out of five, according to Allied Dunbar's annual report on the
physical state of the nation - believe that some form of exercise is good
for them, but only half of them do anything about it. In other words, most
take the classic advice when overcome with the urge to deal with flab - they
sit down until they feel better. But slowly, more of us are realising that
fitness is not only good for us, it can also be fun. It can be about
enjoying yourself, meeting friends and colleagues in warm, congenial clubs,
and about feeling better, too.
As David Giampaolo, who founded the Espree clubs and now distributes fitness
equipment, puts it: 'These days the emphasis is much more on health than
fitness. It's about exercising in a way that is physically, psychologically
AND spiritually rewarding. The idea nowadays is to be energised, not
exhausted.'
The days of the Jane Fonda mantra, No Pain, No Gain, are gone. High-impact
aerobics, exercising till you drop, are out of vogue. In have come
low-impact aerobics, stretch and step, yoga, flotation, inline skating, Tai
Chi, dance - the key is to find something you actually enjoy - then there is
a chance that you might stick with it.
Fitness is also big business. The health, youth and fitness business is
predicted to be one of the five fastest growing commercial sectors in the
next decade - but as in all successful businesses, it needs sharp footwork
to keep ahead of the game.
With the emphasis on fun and (sign of the times) stress relief the
fashionable way to hone limbs and tone up cardiovascular function is with
such new age concepts as Step Training, Inline Skating, The Slide Trainer,
water aerobics and personal trainers. Crucial, too, are the ancillary
servies - aromatherapy, reflexology, massage, the holistic approach that all
the best, most advanced clubs now offer.
David Giampaolo was probably the first, with Espree, to see that most
1980s-style British clubs lacked allure. They were spartan and functional;
people came, worked out and went home. With Espree he made sure that a club
was a nice place to be - comfortable, inviting, warm, with a restaurant
serving decent food.
Nowadays many clubs are selling the new age message: that you need not
suffer to be beautiful and well. The Riverside Club, some of the David Lloyd
ones, the medium-market Metropolitan Clubs and lots of small health clubs up
and down the UK are all now more inviting to visit than the spartan clubs of
yesteryear.
The new Harbour Club at Watermead Lane, London SW6 (tel: 071-371-7700) is
not due to open until March 22 but so far is making all the right noises. It
describes itself as a multi-sports club with 14 tennis courts (10 indoors),
a 4,000 sq ft gymnasium, a 25 metre pool, a creche, good parking and every
sort of class from stretch and step, yoga and dance to flotation tank and a
proper restaurant with a serious chef (ex-Halcyon Hotel).
There is a resaleable membership fee of Pounds 1,695 and the monthly full
membership charge is Pounds 88. This lets you use all the facilities free
except the indoor tennis courts at peak time for which there is a Pounds 10
an hour charge. There will also be off-peak membership of Pounds 55 per
month and a joining fee of Pounds 430 for those who only use the club Monday
to Friday from 6.30am to 6pm. Some 900 people have already signed up.
For those for whom those kind of sums are out of the question it is worth
mentioning Jamie Addicoat's Fatbusters - wonderful name - classes. When I
last looked at the fitness business Addicoat's Fatbusters was running some
of the cheapest classes around, at Covent Garden's Jubilee Hall for Pounds
2.50 a class. Today prices have risen to just Pounds 4 a time. For that
reasonable sum you get Jamie himself, shouting, strutting, urging you on to
that (attainable) goal - the lean and trim body. Hours are for serious
workaoholics - 7.30 am on Monday, Tuesday and Thursdays, 7.15 pm on Tuesdays
and 1 pm on Sundays. Classes are held at the Jubilee Hall, 30, The Piazza,
Covent Garden, London WC2. Tel: 071-836-4007 for details.
The ultimate luxury (or necessity, depending on your point of view), is the
personal trainer. Puritanical Britons tend to feel this is the decadent way
to fitness but in New York, where personal trainers are nearly as ubiquitous
as personal analysts, they are seen as just another sensible use of
hard-pressed time. Trainers come in every discipline and though Pounds 35 an
hour (the average rate at which they come in London) may sound a lot, if you
get two or three friends to join it is good value.
My personal preference at the moment is for yoga: muscle toning, increased
suppleness and flexibility, not to mention a sense of renewed energy, are
just some of the benefits that yoga addicts notice. As evidence of my
devotion to my readers I proffer the name of my own much-valued yoga
teacher, Lisbeth Russell, tel: 071-431-2668, for those in the London area
who think yoga may be the thing for them. Otherwise the British Wheel of
Yoga Central Office (tel: 0529-306851) has a list of trained teachers in the
UK.
For other personal trainers - whether in low-impact aerobics, stretch and
step, body-sculpting - ring Melanie Reigber at Lifeworks (tel: 081-520-7344)
and she will put you in touch with teachers and classes in your area.
If you like keeping your physical inadequacies to yourself and just want to
work out in privacy at home there is now a vast range of in-home equipment
and supporting videos. The Step is currently much in vogue (see caption top
right) but the hot coming thing (according to David Giampaolo) is The Slide
Trainer, which should be in most sports shops in mid-March for Pounds 79.
Whereas most exercises work the front and back of the legs the Slide Trainer
promises (ah, delicious prospect) to stretch and tone the abductors (the
outside thigh muscles) and adductors (the inner ones). It also tones the
medial and lateral muscles on the inside and outside of the knee. So there
you have it - thinner thighs, stronger knees could be yours.
One last thought. The inescapable fact is that the toned body, the lithe
shape, the inner tranquillity does not come from the odd hour in the gym or
the couple of hours on the tennis court. It depends upon a whole way of
life. It reflects what you eat, how you move, how you feel and how you
exercise. Nothing is ever quite as simple as it seems . . .
