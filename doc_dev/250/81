   California's lampooned and lauded
self-esteem task force goes out of business Sunday, but its backers
feel really good about its accomplishments.
   Its creator, state Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, says the task
force ``brought self-esteem from an object of ridicule to a subject
of respect _ throughout our state, across our nation and even now
around our entire world.
   ``Self-esteem, formerly only cautiously addressed in the privacy
of therapeutic encounters and personal growth weekends, has now
become legitimate and mainstream, in conversation and in
practice,'' said Vasconcellos, a Democrat from San Jose.
   Virginia and Maryland created their own task forces last year
and several other states are considering it. Forty-nine of
California's 58 counties now have their own self-esteem task forces.
   Vasconcellos will present the task force work to the annual
convention of the National Conference of State Legislators in
Nashville, Tenn., in August. The same month, the First
International Conference on Self Esteem is scheduled in Oslo,
Norway.
   The California task force's 144-page report, ``Toward a State of
Esteem,'' has sold more than 20,000 copies at $4 each since coming
out in January. The report defines self-esteem as ``appreciating my
own worth and importance and having the character to be accountable
for myself and to act responsibly toward others.''
   While the law creating California's task force expires on July
1, Vasconcellos has plenty of plans for the future.
   ``It's a conclusion of a phase, like a commencement,'' he said.
   A bill moving through the Legislature would create a state
ombudsperson for self-esteem to monitor state agencies and see if
they're following the task force recommendations. Another bill
would provide $100,000 to the non-profit National Council for Self
Esteem so it can replace the task force as a clearinghouse for
self-esteem information.
   Vasconcellos became interested in the subject nearly a decade
ago, partly because of his ``own painful personal struggle _
despite repeated successes and achievements in my life _ to develop
my own self-esteem.''
   Also, as chairman of the Assembly's budget-writing Ways and
Means Committee, he saw the state pour billions into ``too-little,
too-late efforts to confine and-or repair our fellow Californians.''
   He proposed a self-esteem commission in 1984. It took until
1986, and one veto, to get lawmakers and Gov. George Deukmejian to
agree. The California Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem and
Personal and Social Responsibility was given a three-year life, at
$245,000 a year.
   Shortly before its first meeting in April 1987, cartoonist Garry
Trudeau spent three weeks lampooning the task force. In his
``Doonesbury'' comic strip, the airhead character ``Boopsie,'' an
actress and out-of-body traveler, was named to the task force.
Trudeau pulled out all the California jokes about new-age music,
hot tubs and reincarnation.
   The nation laughed, but the task force members were not angry.
   ``The `Doonesbury' thing was a curious thing that made us
famous, that gave us a national audience immediately that we could
not have bought,'' Vasconcellos said.
   The task force went to work, with few further sniggers and a
growing respect. It produced a report listing effective self-esteem
programs in California, such as teaching arts in state prisons and
giving self-esteem training to welfare recipients in Napa County.
   Its 46 recommendations range from making child-rearing courses
more available to requiring teachers to have self-esteem training,
to reducing class sizes.
   But Vasconcellos in his budget-writing role is faced with a
1990-91 state budget with a potential $3.6 billion shortfall and no
money for new programs.
   ``It's ironic and frustrating. The saving grace is a lot of this
doesn't cost any money. It's a change of attitude in people
operating current programs,'' he said. ``Some money is needed to
support self-esteem education. It would be helpful and a great
investment.''
   All the task force members but one signed the report, although
seven wrote slightly critical comments. The non-signer, David
Shannahoff-Khalsa, a Del Mar neuroscience researcher and yoga
teacher, said self-esteem cannot be injected or given to anyone.
   Other critics say the report only lists common sense conclusions.
   ``It could have been figured out, but it hadn't been,'' responds
Vasconcellos. ``But the truth is we have created a national
awareness and I never thought we would come so far so fast.''
   He said the task force is stimulating further research and new
programs seeking to determine if self-esteem is mostly innate or
can be learned.
   ``There's a chicken-egg quality to it. We're learning about it.
We have lots more to learn. The hope is we're asking the right
questions, finally.''
