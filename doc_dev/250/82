<LEADPARA>  An unusual stretching regimen? Yoga? Or perhaps an attempt to bite off that
nagging hangnail on the big toe? Well, according to the Associated Press, this
was U.S. triple-jumper Mike Conley's best attempt at a "flip of joy," his way
of celebrating a bronze-medal performance at the World Track and Field
Championships in Tokyo on Monday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  REDS REALIZING RINGS MUST BE MADE TO LAST; Like starry-eyed fiancees, the
Cincinnati Reds were enamored of their World Series rings when they received
them on opening day.;   But as the months have gone on, the shine has worn
off. And now several Reds, unhappy with the quality of the rings, are
revamping their diamond-studded bands.;   "Some of my diamonds were falling
out," said pitcher Jose Rijo. "Probably by the end of the season 25 out of 25
guys will have had their rings redone," Rijo said.; 'SLOW PLAY' BECOMES REAL
SLOW IN SWEDEN; Tired of those six-hour rounds of golf on our fine local golf
courses? Well, how would you feel about 1 hour, 2 seconds just to play one
hole?;   That's how long golfers in Haparanda, Sweden, said it was taking to
play a 132-yard, par-3 recently.;   The catch?;   On one hole, of what is
believed to be the world's first two-nation golf course, the tee shots are hit
from Sweden. With the pin placed in its trickiest position, it was taking over
an hour -- the time difference between Sweden and Finland -- to reach the hole
in Finnish territory.; 'I said, 'Hey, Charles, I don't want to fight you
because if you hit me, you're not going to do anything but make me rich.' '--
