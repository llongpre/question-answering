   Instead of weaving baskets and making
pottery, teen-agers at a summer camp sponsored in part by rockers
of The Grateful Dead will organize to save the planet.
   For the third year, campers from around the country will gather
under the redwoods in July for a 15-day intensive program designed
to teach leadership and organizing skills to the next generation of
social activists.
   ``Not many people know about it, but there is the beginning of a
worldwide youth movement,'' camp organizer Santokh Khalsa said
Wednesday.
   After early-morning yoga, the youths gather in a circle outside
for seminars led by the likes of Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben and
Jerry's Ice Cream, who has been a champion of socially responsible
business.
   Another speaker at the camp in Mendocino County north of San
Francisco will be Ram Dass, the former Harvard professor who has
blended Eastern philosophy and spiritualism into a unique
prescription for social action.
   The regimen of vegetarian meals, small support groups and daily
feedback sessions sounds like something out of an earlier era.
   It is.
   The camp is coordinated by a Mill Valley-based group called
Creating Our Future. Established in 1987, the group helps high
school students organize to tackle issues like homelessness,
offshore oil drilling and the preservation of rain forests.
   Khalsa, the organization's co-founder, has been involved in the
peace and environmental movements for three decades. Khalsa said
the goal of Creating Our Future is to provide support and direction
to aspiring social activists and to offer the wisdom of experience.
   In keeping with the group's youth-oriented philosophy, Creating
Our Future's board of directors is composed of eight adults and 16
people under age 25.
   Grateful Dead members Bobby Weir and Jerry Garcia are on the
board of directors and advisory board, respectively. The 1960s
band, which still attracts a die-harde cadre of fans known as Dead
Heads for concerts including such hits as ``Truckin','' plans a
concert to benefit the summer camp.
   Campers learn to coordinate public education campaigns,
fund-raising and letter-writing drives, media contacts and
nonviolent public demonstrations.
   But camp isn't about ``just being active and doing sit-ins,''
according to Yvonne Litaker, a camp veteran and speaking tour
coordinator for Creating Our Future.
   ``What is underneath all this is there's a big youth movement
happening here,'' said Litaker, 20. ``We get letters from all over,
from Kenya and Tokyo, from kids who are yearning to do something.''
   For Litaker, who has worked with the organization for a year and
plans to attend camp again this summer, social activism includes a
vegetarian diet, boycotting products made by companies whose
policies she shuns, and being a conscientious recycler.
   ``I've made my life a statement of how I want the world to be,''
she said, describing her efforts to use only cloth napkins and buy
gasoline only from small, independent stations.
   Camp is an opportunity for young people to meet each other,
learn from veteran social activists of the '60s era and expand the
network of youths who care about changing the world, Litaker said.
   Last year, campers helped produce a manual titled, ``How to
Organize a Rainforest Awareness Week at Your School.''
   The camp has become so popular that organizers have increased
the number of spaces from 30 last year to about 100 this summer.
Tuition and room and board runs $480, and applications are accepted
on a first-come, first-served basis, Litaker said.
