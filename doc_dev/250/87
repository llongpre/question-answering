   The annual video convention stands alone as the
only place where Charlton Heston, near-naked adult-movie stars,
former Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin, child-slasher Freddy Krueger
and ``Wizard of Oz'' munchkins can coexist in one room.
   So prosperous is the home video business _ sales are estimated
at $10 billion this year _ that there's room for everybody at the
eighth annual Video Software Dealers Association convention, which
formally opened Monday.
   ``We think there's a great future,'' said Ron Castell, senior
vice president of Blockbuster Video, the nation's largest video
chain with more than 820 stores.
   ``This is not a hard business. All you do is rent movies.
Americans love movies,'' he said. ``And they have an insatiable
demand.''
   The demand is so profound, in fact, that a record 14,000 video
retailers, distributors, producers and tape manufacturers have come
to the show to check out everything from ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit'' to ``Balloonacy,'' a how-to video complete with 50
balloons and tips to create more than 30 inflated animals.
   Although offbeat titles account for only a small percentage of
video sales, they do give the show its distinctive flavor.
   Lindsay Wagner hosts ``Psychocalisthenics,'' a holistic approach
to fitness that combines yoga, meditation and calisthenics. And
just when you thought it was safe to go back in the tent comes
``Memorial Valley Massacre,'' featuring a Cro-Magnon man with a bad
ax and a worse attitude.
   And don't overlook ``Play the Piano Overnight'' and
``Infantastic Lullabyes on Video,'' which ``opens new ways for
sharing quality time with baby.''
   ``We've been selling B titles for four years, and we haven't hit
any slowdown at all,'' said Doug Coleman, vice president of sales
and marketing for Mercury Films, distributors of ``Slave Girls From
Beyond Infinity'' and ``Assault of the Killer Bimbos,'' among other
features.
   When it comes to more conventional titles, the video industry is
confident that this summer's record-setting box office will spill
over into the fall, generating prolific holiday sales.
   In addition to ``Roger Rabbit,'' this Christmas'
most-anticipated titles include ``Bambi,'' ``The Land Before
Time,'' ``Rain Man,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and the just-announced
release of ``Ghostbusters II.''
   Warner Bros. has yet to say if its megahit ``Batman'' will be
released on video for this year's holiday buyers. But the studio
has sparked curiosity by parking the film's Batmobile at the Warner
Bros. booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center.
   Displays cover 210,000 square feet at this year's show, up from
173,300 last year and a testament to the medium's health. More than
400 video companies, from conglomerates to mom and pop operations,
are staffing exhibits on the floor, a rise from 1988's 373 booths.
   At the same time, though, the video industry is confronting a
number of potentially damaging developments.
   ``Rushing into the '90s brings us to a critical crossroads,''
said Andy Lasky, the convention's chairman.
   Video executives are concerned that a number of pending bills
aimed at containing violent programming will keep video retailers
from renting movies that children might be able to see on
television or in PG-13 rated motion pictures in theaters.
   There is also growing concern among video renters that tape
quality has deteriorated, conventioneers say. Who's to blame,
though, is unclear: It could be ``field-inflicted damage'' caused
by dirty VCRs and careless customers or it could be cost-cutting
manufacturing and duplication techniques that make tapes fall apart
after only several viewings.
   Shoplifting has become a concern, too, and convention-goers
investigated new security systems aimed at stopping theft. And
retailers are fighting to maintain rights to rent Nintendo video
games, a practice which Nintendo says hurts sales and should be
stopped.
