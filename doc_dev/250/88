Time doesn't come on little cat feet when you're a dancer, and Heidi Duckler 
knows it. But that doesn't mean she is ready to hang up her leotard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 36 and at a crossroads in terms of being a dancer," she says. Which is why 
she has taken Terpsichore by the horns and created a dance about aging. 
</P>
<P>
Her Collage Dance Theatre presents its multimedia, non-linear "meditation" 
titled "Ancient Terrain" at the Santa Monica Museum of Art today, Sunday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Collage's members, "Ancient Terrain" features a dozen dancers 
from ages 6 to 86. Choreographed interludes alternate with interviews of the 
dancers and others projected on a 7-foot video monitor. 
</P>
<P>
The piece was conceived in collaboration with video artist Hali Paul, visual 
artist John Garrett, composer Eric Schmidt and writer Jim Kruscoe. They began 
work on the project more than a year ago and have received funding from the 
National/State/County Partnership Program. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a limited lifetime as a dancer and (yet) you aren't willing to give 
it up," Duckler says. "So you begin to wonder if it's possible to speak through 
someone else's body." 
</P>
<P>
She put an ad in the trade newspapers calling for dancers of all ages because 
she "wanted to deal with movement on different bodies at different points in 
people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
Working with this unusual group made Duckler examine her own dancer's values. 
</P>
<P>
"As you get older, your perspective on your art changes and priorities change," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that paradox: Just as you really know what you want to say or you finally 
have something to say (as a dancer), your body's limitations on your being able 
to say it begin to appear." 
</P>
<P>
Duckler also came face to face with her own preconceptions about age. What 
challenged her most was combining respect for the senior dancers with the 
imperatives of getting the choreography set. 
</P>
<P>
"On one level, I thought, 'Well, who am I to tell someone who's 85 how to 
move?' It seemed so presumptuous and I didn't want just to impose (my ideas on 
them)," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to elicit an original inspiration from the dancers, to get them to 
use their own (movement) vocabularies and to shape the movement that grew out 
of who they were in terms of age and their lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
"And it was hard. Especially with my dancers, who'd say, 'Just tell us what you 
want us to do and we'll do it.' 
</P>
<P>
"But I didn't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Eimi Guirao, a 26-year-old member of Collage, says the "experience of working 
with a whole range of people, (including) artists and people who aren't usually 
dancers," made the new work "rewarding, but also trying." 
</P>
<P>
Morris Hattem, 72, has danced much of his life. He echoes Guirao's enthusiasm, 
calling the process "stimulating." 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows? Maybe I'll be a ballet dancer in my later years," he says. "I never 
thought that I'd be getting feedback from so many different ages and 
temperaments." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Duckler had done her homework by going to senior centers and dance 
classes and talking with people of various ages, she was still surprised. None 
of her excursions quite prepared her for, say, "the vitality of one woman who 
had found yoga in her 70s." 
</P>
<P>
Nor was Duckler ready for the emotions unleashed when the participants in the 
show were interviewed on video. 
</P>
<P>
"People cried. They started thinking about their mortality, attitudes toward 
death, aging, childhood and their regrets," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"One woman's daughter had died, and she didn't know how to answer the question 
of whether she was a mother," Duckler says. "It was odd because something so 
natural -- such a part of the life cycle -- wasn't with her. 
</P>
<P>
"Another man hadn't danced for years and was very contemplative about whether 
he'd made the right choices," she says. 
</P>
<P>
All of these shared experiences have combined to change Duckler's understanding 
of age. "What is old?" she asks. "I'm beginning to think that there's only 
older." 
</P>
<P>
"Aging is something that happens to all of us all the time, but I've barely had 
time to even touch upon what it means. I think I've begun to understand it as a 
continuum, with the cycle going on and on. One human life span is so small 
compared with the immensity of time." 
</P>
<P>
Which doesn't mean Duckler believes that one life can't make a difference. She 
thinks it's incumbent upon everyone -- especially her peers -- to fight 
prejudice against age. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are -- the baby boom generation -- we were all so important when we 
were young," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"And now we're aging, and I'm sure that will make a big difference in the 
climate of the country. I hope it's a good difference, both socially and 
politically."
