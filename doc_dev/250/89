  [Text] Medan, North Sumatra, Feb 4 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- 
Indonesia's power projects in Repelita VI (sixth Five-year 
Development Plan, 1994/99) will need a total investment of 60 
trillion rupiah (U.S.$30 billion), a senior official said here 
on Thursday. 
  Director General for Electricity and Energy Development Yoga 
Pranoto of the Ministry of Mines and Energy said that the 
investments include interest rates and costs for another 
investments in similar projects in the next Repelita 
(1999-2004). He said that the funds for power projects in 
Repelita VI will be obtained from the state-owned electricity 
firm, government assistance through approved project list, and 
government's capital. 
  Other funds will also come from state-owned and private 
banks 
as well as from sales of bonds, Pranoto added. 
  Half of the U.S. $30 billion will be used to finance power 
distribution network projects, the director general revealed. 
  "Power projects are expected to meet the people's need for 
electricity which will continue to rise in the coming ten 
years," he said. 
  Indonesia's need for electrical power will increase by 
[figures indistinct] percent annually in the next decade. By 
1995, the country needs to double its electrical capacity from 
the present 11,500 megawatts to nearly 23,000 megawatts. 
  Meanwhile, private investments for the coming ten year's 
power projects are now at 11.3 billion U.S. dollars.
