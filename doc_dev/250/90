   Officials relented and allowed the removal of fig
leaves covering three nude figurines displayed at City Hall after
the artist accused the city of censorship.
   Assistant City Manager Levi Davis and city park officials on
Monday ordered the ``Getting Better Ain't Always Easy'' exhibit by
Lubbock artist Future Atkins covered.
   By Thursday, city officials had countermanded their decision.
   Dallas artist Chase Yarborough, who designed the makeshift
leaves, removed them Thursday. The figurines were then moved away
from a public entrance to a less conspicuous location in a corner
of the first-floor lobby.
   The officials said they wanted the 7{-inch statues clothed
because they thought the nudity might offend visitors.
   ``Now they can be seen as they were intended: unfigged,
uncensored,'' Atkins said.
   She said people who view the exhibit probably will be
disappointed.
   ``I think people who expect more risque stuff are going to be
disappointed,'' she said. ``They'll say, `This is what all the
trouble is about? That is all it is?' ''
   The three female figures are portrayed in yoga positions.
   Dallas assistant park director Yvonne Washington called Ms.
Atkins Wednesday to apologize for the episode.
   The artist said she accepted the apology and will allow city
officials to move the exhibit to the rear of the lobby.
   The Dallas Women's Caucus for Art sponsored the exhibit that
includes Ms. Atkins' figurines.
   onnie Wilber, president of the women's art group said the
unveiling is a victory.
   ``We do feel good about it,'' Wilber said. ``But we would feel
better about it if the issue had never come up.''
