   In its last-ditch effort to close a $1 billion
budget gap, the Legislature has proposed taxing virtually
everything but the kitchen sink.
   Taxpayers may be puzzled over some of the 594 new levies on
services. Who, for instance, has ever seen a telephone booth
cleaner? And how many trampoline operations are there?
   Some professional groups _ like lawyers _ lobbied hard against
the sales tax expansion to their business. But fortune tellers and
vendors of piped-in music, who would also be taxed, weren't much in
evidence during the tax debate.
   David MacNeill, vice president of a company that sells
background music to malls and supermarkets, said he is concerned
about the tax. The waiting-room music industry, like everything
else, is feeling the squeeze from Massachusetts' slumping economy.
   ``Things are tight. Everybody's hustling like hell to keep
going,'' said MacNeill, of WCRB Sound System in Waltham.
   Stella Davis, a palm reader from Saugus, was surprised to learn
she and her colleagues face a 5 percent sales tax on any
fortunetelling bills that exceed $30.
   ``When you pay a tax and buy butter, you're getting something.
This is just a reading. They're not taking anything home except
just knowledge,'' Davis said.
   Davis said she is unlikely to pay the tax, since most of her
readings cost $10.
   But Davis' remark reflects a potential problem with the sales
tax _ a problem Gov. Michael S. Dukakis wants resolved before he
will sign the tax bill, aimed at raising $1.3 billion in its first
year.
   Under the Massachusetts Constitution, only commodities can be
taxed. Opponents of expanding the sales tax say services don't fall
under the definition of commodities. Dukakis has asked the state's
highest court to rule on the matter before he signs the bill.
   The state culled the list of services to be taxed from a list of
professions put out by the U.S. Census Bureau.
   ``The advantage of using it even though it seems silly when you
list them out is that it puts it all in black and white,'' said
Betsy Houghteling, a Department of Revenue spokeswoman.
   Although she acknowledged it may be difficult to track down
every last fortuneteller and yoga teacher, Houghteling said the
more obscure professions would bring in little money anyway.
   ``If we missed a palm reader, and that person didn't come
forward voluntarily, would the commonwealth miss a lot of money?
No,'' Houghteling said.
   But the lengthy list of services has left the impression with
some that everything is being taxed.
   Among the services whose clients would be subject to a 5 percent
tax: sponging textiles for tailors and dressmakers; cleaning and
reglazing of baking pans; mattress renovating and repair shops;
tent repair shops.
   ``There's no fortunetelling lobby so they can tax them,'' said
Peter Blanchard of Shrewsbury. ``How much money can that bring in?
I don't like it.'' But Caroline Clark, who works for an accounting
firm, had little problem with taxing palm readers.
   ``I feel that's fairly frivolous,'' Clark said.
