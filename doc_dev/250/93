<LEADPARA>  WHAT keeps the Moody Blues going? Like many seasoned pros on tour this summer
-- Steve Miller, the Beach Boys, Chicago, the Doobie Brothers and Yes -- they
always hear from cynics who insist it's time they hung up their instruments
and headed off to pasture.;   So why do they keep coming back for more?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We're born hams," says Moody Blues drummer Graeme Edge. "Every one of us
is an old ham. And no matter what's going on off stage, everybody pulls for
each other on stage. We love performing live. Every time you play, you sort of
restate what you had. We're performing songs we've played together for a long
time -- and we never come off stage as aggravated as we might have been when
we went on.";   The Moody Blues first made their mark 24 years ago with the
album "Days of Future Passed," featuring the cosmic hits "Tuesday Afternoon"
and "Nights in White Satin." When the album reaches the quarter-century mark
next year, they plan to celebrate it with special shows at London's Royal
Albert Hall and/or New York's Carnegie Hall.;   "We'll finally do what people
have been on us to do for a long, long time. We'll get an orchestra and redo
the whole album and video it, probably for HBO or something like that," says
Edge, speaking from a recent tour stop in Milwaukee.;   Singing the Blues;
Today, the group is often lumped into the classic-rock nostalgia bag. But
unlike many of their '60s road-hog peers, they continue to score hit singles.
In the last decade, they've crashed the charts with "I Know You're Out There
Somewhere," "Your Wildest Dreams," "The Voice," "Gemini Dream" and the new
"Say It With Love," another fluidly melodic vehicle for lead singer Justin
Hayward.;   "I think Justin's the most underrated solo songwriter of the
second half of the 20th century," says Edge, who surely has a vested interest,
but speaks for many fans in this regard.;   "Forget the hits he's written.
When you listen to the body of his work, the consistency and quality of it, it
is fairly awesome. I just don't understand why he's not recognized more for
it.";   The spiritual Hayward, who was studying yoga and meditation back in
the '60s, is the only member not to be an obvious "born ham," though he's
loosened up through the years, as any Moody Blues fan will tell you.;  
"Justin is quite a private character, although he's getting much more relaxed
nowadays," says Edge. "He used to be very, very nervous on stage. He says he's
finally realized that the audience hasn't come to watch him screw up. They've
come to be on his side and enjoy the music.";   The Moody Blues have three
singers -- Hayward, bassist John Lodge (whose recent bout with the flu caused
the band's summer tour to be postponed two weeks) and flutist Ray Thomas,
who's recently recovered from a nerve disorder in his legs to once again
contribute.;   Just doing their best; Any problems with the chemistry of who
sings what?;   "Not really. It all comes down to the best songs available in
the studio," says Edge. "Justin could become the authority if he wanted to,
but he's just not that kind of a guy. He likes the group around him.";   The
Moody Blues have always managed to be on the cutting edge of technology. They
helped introduce the Mellotron, Moog synthesizer and electronic drums to rock.
And while they've just lost their progressive keyboardist, Patrick Moraz, who
moved to Los Angeles to pursue a movie-scoring career, they've kept in step
with remaining keyboardist Bias Boshell and new addition Paul Bliss.;   "I'm
not putting us alongside the Mozarts and the Beethovens," says Edge. "But if
you try to do your very best, there seems to be a whole bunch of people whose
musical development is about at your level and who appreciate and respect what
you do. And really, all we're doing is the best we can at any given time.";
