   Ma Anand Sheela was among seven followers
of Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh who conspired to kill U.S.
Attorney Charles Turner, alleged a federal indictment unsealed
Thursday.
   Sheela was personal secretary to the late guru when he ran the
Oregon commune of Rajneeshpuram. She had been imprisoned on
unrelated federal charges until her deportation in 1988 to Germany.
   The plot was disclosed earlier this year and some arrests were
made, but Thurday was the first time Sheela's involvement was
alleged.
   The indictment was issued in May but sealed until the defendants
could be arrested.
   All but Sheela, 41, who is a native of Baroda, India, have been
arrested overseas and are awaiting extradition, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Barry Sheldahl.
   The indictments accuse the defendants of plotting to kill the
guru's physician Swami Devaraj and charges all but Sheela with
illegal interstate transportation of guns.
   The maximum penalty for murder conspiracy is life in prison.
   The other defendants are: Sally Ann Croft, also known as Ma Prem
Savita; Ann Phyllis McCarthy, also known as Ma Yoga Vidya; Susan
Lissanevitch, also known as Ma Anand Su; Catherine Jane Stubbs,
also known as Ma Shanti Bhadra; Carol Matthews, also known as Ma
Prem Samadhi, and Richard Kevin Langford, also known as Swami
Anugiten.
   Croft and Lissanevitch were arrested in England, McCarthy in
South Africa, and the other three in Germany.
   Sheldahl said the alleged plot was an attempt to stop a U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service investigation. That probe
led to Rajneesh's deportation, the arrest of Sheela and other
Rajneeshee leaders and the disbanding of the commune in 1985.
   Rajneesh, who died in India in January, called himself the
``rich man's guru'' and taught meditation as a means to
enlightenment.
   Sheela was deported after serving 29 months in federal prison in
California for her role in various criminal activities, including
attempted murder, arson, and contaminating restaurant salad bars
with salmonella.
   Sheldahl said Sheela is still being sought.
   The Oregonian cited unnamed federal surces as saying she might
be in Switzerland since she married Urs Birnstiel, a Swiss fugitive
from a federal wiretapping charge here.
   The newspaper said Sheela's marriage makes her a Swiss citizen.
If she is in Switzerland, authorities can't extradite her because
the United States and Switzerland have no extradition treaty.
   The indictment said the plotters picked an assassination team
from among themselves and used commune money and a false birth
certificate to buy guns.
   The defendants practiced different ways of killing Turner, and
watched his movements, the indictment said.
   Turner said that before he learned of the plot, he had a sense
of peril.
   ``I had a premonition on June 20, 1985,'' he said. ``I can't say
why. And then later I had another feeling on Aug. 1, 1985.''
   He said the second premonition occurred after he saw a
Rajneeshee pointing a video camera at him while he addressed a
meeting of the Oregon Bar Association.
   No harm ever came to him and the only evasive action he took was
to alter his routes coming home.
