This week's big video release is "Big" (CBS/Fox, $89.95, PG). Following by a 
week the video release of another Tom Hanks picture, "Punchline," this 
comedy-fantasy is about a boy who wishes himself into adulthood, carrying his 
pubescent mind along for the wild ride. "Funny, warm, sophisticated and highly 
imaginative," wrote Kevin Thomas in The Times. Also highly successful, with a 
$111 million box-office gross.

Many fans of director Costa-Gavras felt betrayed by "Betrayed" (MGM/UA, $89.95, 
R) -- or at least disappointed. This time his political interests centered on 
white supremacists in America's heartland, as conveyed in a script by Joe 
Eszterhas ("Flashdance"). "The result," wrote Sheila Benson in The Times, "is a 
loosening of the trademark Costa-Gavras tension," though she found Debra 
Winger's performance as an FBI agent "warm" and "believable."

Federico Fellini's first two films, "Variety Lights" (co-directed by Alberto 
Lattuada) and "The White Sheik" are being released this week, after 
rescheduling, by Connoisseur Video for $59.95 each. The same company also has 
Michelangelo Antonioni's "The Eclipse" and Kaneto Shindo's "Onibaba" for $79.95 
each.
