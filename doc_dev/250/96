<LEADPARA>  THERE is a vegetarian boarding for the summer. She used to live here and
gobble up all the specials of the day, be they roast chicken or poached eggs.
She'd dance with the cook for pasta carbonara.;    Now she's like a missionary
who has come upon savages sucking on the ribs of the census taker. She gently
insists that we let her take over the cooking.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     She's simplifying her life, she says, although you can't tell it by the
eating part, which has become more complicated and mysterious. From her
backpack, she pulls jars full of dried leaves and twigs, which she simmers
together on the stove for tea. The cats whimper to go out.;    The word
"gross" has returned to her language. Long ago, when she was a pampered child
and ate mostly cottage cheese, Vienna sausages and cereal shaped like little
O's, she thought most adult food "gross.";    She's doing it again.;    "A
sausage sandwich? Oh my god.";    She's actually way past vegetarian.;   
There is a soup she will make as soon as she can find the ingredients. It's
made from a predigested enzyme and "looks like dirt.";    As a student of
higher education, it was expected that eventually she'd happen upon some
knowledge to challenge the family program.;    The generation before her came
home agnostic and registered Independent. All this kid did was decide her
family has poisoned her body for 20 years and it will take her the next 20 to
get it in balance.;    Because she has thrived for some time on her own, and
her hair is shiny and her teeth still secure, we try not to be too skeptical
of her new regimen.;    It is, however, remarkable, that she has given up her
oldest and most constant companion -- peanut butter, creamy style, in a
spoon.;    "Too much fat.";    She frowns as she looks inside the
refrigerator.;    "But it's frozen yogurt," we whine. "Low fat. Chocolate
marble fudge. You loved it this winter.";    One night she offers to cook
dinner, and because she's not partaking, she even grudgingly agrees to toss
some chunks of chicken breast into the rice and zucchini.;    She sits
nibbling on a piece of fiber, having bulked up earlier on a green pill made
from kelp. Everyone digs in but the younger sister, who is staring at her
place mat.;    "This makes me feel terrible," the younger one says and slowly
nudges each juicy piece of gingered meat to the quarantined side of her
plate.;    It turns out the veggie queen had been giving her a lecture on the
horrors of assembly line chicken.;    Not only did our dinner never get a
chance to run around the yard, it may have died trampled, scared and beakless,
she reads from the book she carries around like a daily devotional.;    She
makes comments on what happens to women at a certain age. She wants to know if
I'm eating enough beans. I can feel her scanning my bones.;    Understand that
this elitist barely bothered to chew anything interesting until about the age
of 5.;    As a little kid, she shocked her robust relatives by refusing sweet
potatoes and pie with ice cream. Thanksgiving dinner for years was turkey and
a glass of milk.;    She said no to lobster and would eat hamburgers only if
they were unadorned. The same with salad. It's only been since junior high
that she would eat lettuce wet.;    Eventually, she broke loose and started
sampling everything she'd missed. Now it's soy lattes and oat cakes.;    We're
not sure when this latest thing started. It could have come from her yoga
class or the dinner she ate with a Hare Krishna. She may have been altered
during Native American Studies or Women and the Environment, or it might have
been the friend who sleeps on the floor and gave up beer.;    When I brag to
her that I passed up a turkey sandwich for cream cheese and avocado on squaw
bread, expecting a gold star, she shakes her head.;    "Morally you can feel
good, but health-wise, you would have been better off with the turkey."  </TEXT>
