holiday - Lucia van der Post finds that fat farms now offer a lot more than
lettuce leaves and lemon juice

THIS MAY seem perverse and it almost certainly sounds spoilt, but I have
spent years turning down blandishments to become thinner, more beautiful,
less toxic, more toned, to have my crystals dispersed, be wrapped and
pampered, pummelled and hosed down.
I've said 'No' to invitations to almost every fat farm in the country. You
would need to be very rich, very depressed or very daft, I reasoned, to want
to put up with the boredom, the lettuce leaves, the fatties in shell-suits,
when you could perfectly well be dining on lemon juice and lettuce leaves in
the comfort of your very own home.
But I was wrong. Fat farms, these days, are no longer for fatties. Dear me,
no. Fat farms have metamorphosed into health spas or hydros (terminology is
all) and these days it is stress, not flab, that brings most of the
customers. The days when they revolved round nothing but calories,
calisthenics and cellulite have gone and though you would never confuse it
with eating at Quaglino's, you certainly will not starve.
Which isn't to say that visiting a health farm is entirely stress-free.
What, for instance, do you wear? Forget Jane Fonda; health spa chic is
summed up by a luscious, thick, white towelling robe. Not that everybody
knows this. If you are one of those sensitive souls who feels mortally
affronted by the sight of a shell-suit (I know this may sound odd, but
believe me this would include almost the entire fashion fraternity) then a
health farm is not for you.
And what on earth do you wear for a massage, the massage virgin may want to
know? (The same towelling robe, which you then discard and nothing else it
seems, but modesty is preserved by a lot of very intricate play with towels,
practised as skilfully as if it were an ancient branch of origami, as first
one limb and then another is extracted from beneath the towels.)
And does the lady with the seaweed wrap require you to take everything off?
(She does, she does, and here there is no scope for subtle towel play as you
are painted from neck to toe in fishy-smelling mud so you just lie back and
think not so much of England as of the wonderful things it's doing for your
cellulite).
A health spa, you soon learn, is another country. Think of it as going
abroad - it helps if you speak the language and adapt easily to strange food
and customs. Conversation is strange and limited - not everybody is at their
wittiest when wearing no make-up and nothing but a towelling robe in front
of total strangers - but you soon get the hang of the lingo.
Strange-sounding remedies . . . holistic massage, aromatherapy, G5 massage,
cathiodermie, seaweed wraps, flotation tanks, full body exfoliation, high
pressure Blitz water jets . . . become the stuff of daily chat and it isn't
long before one is quite relaxed about looking daft.
Most health spas have evolved a formula that is roughly the same - they are
usually in large country houses with gravel drives that crunch nicely as you
drive up. New 'wings' and 'spas' have usually been added on to cope with the
ruthless accounting these projects involve. Staff ratios are high and at
their best they are as comfortable as a luxurious hotel. Most never escape
the faint whiff of the hospital or the convalescent home as rafts of
white-clad personnel wander round brandishing sphygmomanometers and seeking
to discuss one's 'medical history.'
Most are set in lovely grounds (my husband, for instance, loved the fast
early morning walks at both Champneys and Grayshott Hall because of the real
beauty of the landscape), all have pools and gyms, libraries and
quiet-rooms.
You should check what is on offer carefully - most include one massage a
day, use of the gym, the swimming pool and sauna as well as all sporting
facilities and classes in the basic day rate charge. Beauty and special
treatments, which are many, various and full of alluring promise, are
usually extra.
You soon learn that serious body-care costs serious money. You could
perfectly easily run up an extremely large bill in no time at all. At
Grayshott Hall, for instance, I whirled from my daily massage (included in
the daily rate) to a 'stimulating G5 massage ' to a seaweed wrap, a
'Minimise Your Middle' class, fitting in two tennis lessons and a 'Step to
The Beat' class in between, all of which added up to Pounds 485 for two days
and nights. My husband, though, who had just one treatment (the Flotation
tank - 'like lying on a lilo, except there is no lilo') totted up just
Pounds 342.30.
Some are more spartan than others. At Grayshott Hall, for instance, there is
no alcohol on the premises at all which could come as something of a shock
to some (it certainly would have done to me if I had not thought to bring my
own supplies) whilst at Champneys they will sell you half a bottle of wine a
day.
Though much that is on offer is the same, the atmosphere and the clientele
varies. The designer set seemed to gather at Champneys, old money goes to
Forest Mere and Henlow Grange seems to have a nice little niche in the
celebrity market while Grayshott Hall has a good raft of professional
people.
All, however, are agreed on one thing - the new approach to fitter,
healthier eating means you need to eat plenty of starchy foods such as
potatoes, rice, pasta and pulses, a moderate amount of lean protein and very
little fat and refined sugar. Salad dressings, we learn, can be made from
lemon juice, garlic and lots of herbs. Sauces can be made from low-fat
yoghurt, meat ('never,' said Linda Brewer, who is in charge of La Jalousie's
Spa, 'eat a portion bigger than the palm of your hand') should have skin or
fat cut off.
The end goal these days is much more awesome than merely dropping a few
pounds - nothing more nor less than 'to establish long-term healthy
life-styles'. 'Life-style counselling' (new buzz word) is available for
those who can face it.
Holistic, new-age chat is everywhere - flotation tanks, yoga, reflexology,
holistic massages are all the rage. The treatments are lovely but I could
have done without the psycho-babble that goes with it - it's when they feel
your toes and tell you that they have glimpsed your soul that I start to
crack. Reflexologists, in particular, have a strange obsession with
fallopian tubes and ovaries whose current state they relay, acting rather
like radar, to the mummy on the table.
I loved the tennis (the clinic at Champneys and the coaching at Grayshott),
loved the exercise classes, adored the massages, and by the end felt
pampered, squeaky clean, silky soft and so laid-back I wasn't sure if I
would ever make it up again. It was a wonderful chance to try out a vast
range of treatments, classes and activities and see which ones I would go
back for. I enjoyed the fact that the food on offer was fresh and ample and
calorie-counted so you knew what you are downing but gloriously bereft of
those nasty fats and sugars.
A weekend is not long enough for dramatic transformation but it lifts the
spirits, sorts out the impurities and encourages the will-power. I have
become rather hooked. I think it will be Eugenie-les-Bains next - a
combination, so they tell me, of Michelin three-star restaurant, low
calories and health spa. A perfect rounding of the circle - you work out in
the spa in order that you can put it all back on again in the restaurant.
Of course, there are those who say if they are going to spend these kind of
sums then they would rather spend it on a truly sybaritic long-haul holiday,
somewhere like, say, the Caribbean . . . Ah well, then I have just the place
for you. Jalousie, a lush, green plantation in St. Lucia where outside your
very own cottage (with very own patio and plunge pool) you fall asleep to
the croaking of the tree frogs and the high-pitched whirr of the cicadas and
you wake to the palms waving and coconuts crashing. All around are mangoes
and avocadoes, blue skies and choices . . . choices . . . choices. Quite
stressful, really.
Shall I go to aerobics at nine (run by the delicious Leslie whom, it seems,
everybody always wants to take home with them) or have a bash at
scuba-diving? Shall I see whether my water-skiing technique has survived a
three-year gap or go for something more relaxing, like a seaweed wrap? Then
there is the pedicure, the manicure, the tennis lesson with Barum and the
round-robin tournament at five all to be fitted in.
Jalousie is a holiday resort and a spa all in one - every one of the four
restaurants offers a low-calorie menu but you do not have to have it while
pool lizards need never make it to the spa. Use of the gym, the tennis and
squash courts, the pool, the water sports and the classes as well as all
meals, snacks and drinks are included, just the special treatments and a few
special activities are extra.
Most of us, however, were there for the action. Wedding and Home wanted her
scuba-diving certificate; the Evening Standard was on a serious keep-fit
binge (aerobics, then work-outs in the gym followed by intensive sessions on
the running machine); the Express was into grooming and GQ was there to lend
tone in his cream linen bespoke suits and battered panama.
As for me a sliced second service, thinner thighs, neater waist, smaller me
was the aim and though that is pushing it in just four days, I have nearly
mastered the serve and there really is marginally less of me. I am addicted
to the running machine, have come away with five different recipes for
low-calorie salad dressings and hope one fine day to be back.
It is, of course, a long way to go to get fit but you could not hope for a
more beautiful place to do it in.
Most such places have one serious drawback (apart, that is, from the price)
 -to be truly at ease you need to put your mind on hold or tell it to crash
out. Forget Proust. Resign yourself. You are not going to read Decline and
Fall this time. Then you can just relax and enjoy it.
