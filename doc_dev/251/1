   The nation where World War II began will
mark the 50th anniversary of the German invasion beginning Thursday
with a series of events nearly overshadowed by the startling
political events under way.
   Joining Communist President Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski at official
events will be Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and newly named Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first non-Communist to head a
Polish government in 45 years.
   Planned commemorations include an internationally broadcast
concert by Leonard Bernstein, speeches at Westerplatte, where the
war's first shots were fired, and an international prayer for peace
led by a televised message from Polish-born Pope John Paul II.
   The war has an enduring poignancy in Poland, which fought against
Hitler from the conflict's start on Sept. 1, 1939, to the victory in
Europe on May 9, 1945.
   More than 6 million Poles died, a fifth of the population and a
higher percentage than any other nation. The toll included 3 million
Jews, deported to death camps such as Auschwitz and Treblinka that
the Nazis built in the once-obscure Polish villages by those names.
   At war's end, 40 percent of Poland's national property was lost
and Warsaw was empty and leveled. In the capital, stucco facades of
homes still show the scars of battle.
   To some, the war's toll continued at the hands of the Communist
government that took power backed by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
   ``We will pay homage to all victims of the war, we will pay
homage to its heroes and we will express the will to live in
peace,'' said Wlodzimierz Lozinski, a spokesman for Jaruzelski.
   The commemoration begins one week after Communist and Solidarity
lawmakers joined to elect Mazowiecki prime minister. The Solidarity
editor heads the first non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc.
   The events begin tomorrow night with a parade to Victory Square
and a changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
   Jaruzelski, who went to Siberia with his family after the Soviets
invaded and later joined the Polish army organized under the
Soviets, will lead the ceremony.
   On Friday, Jaruzelski, Walesa and others will gather in the
Baltic port of Gdansk at the 75-foot granite memorial honoring the
defenders of Westerplatte, where the German battleship
Schleswig-Holstein fired on a garrison of 182 Polish soldiers to
start the war.
   War veterans from Poland and the Allies will participate,
including about 70 survivors of the attack.
   Bernstein will conduct a concert Friday evening at Warsaw's Grand
Theater with actress Liv Ullmann and others in a televised benefit
for the U.N. agency UNICEF.
   Bernstein will open with lines from W.H. Auden's poem,
``September 1, 1939,'' and Samuel Pisar, one of the youngest
survivors of Auschwitz, will narrate reminiscences accompanied by
photographs and film of the destruction of Warsaw. Ms. Ullmann will
narrate Arnold Schoenberg's cantata ``A Survivor From Warsaw.''
   An International Day of Prayer for Peace will bring together
representatives of world religions for conferences and contemplation
on Thursday and Friday.
   ``The lessons we draw from World War II must be drawn for the
whole world, for international reconciliation and understanding,''
said Wladyslaw Klaczynski, an organizer.
   The pope is to address his countrymen Friday evening via a
television screen set up in the Royal Castle Square at Warsaw's Old
City, rebuilt after the being razed by the Nazis.
   Jewish groups representing the few thousand Jews who remain from
a population that numbered 3.5 million before the war, will mark the
anniversary with a photo exhibition, ``Jews in Struggle for
Poland,'' and a service at Warsaw's lone synagogue conducted by the
country's only rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, who arrived this
spring from Israel.
   There will also be wreaths laid at the monument to the Warsaw
Ghetto uprising and at Umschlagplatz, where Jews were loaded into
railroad boxcars for transport to the death camps.
   Solidarity, the independent union born in Gdansk, has scheduled
masses and concerts, including one by bands of miners and shipyard
workers.
   West Germany will send a five-member delegation of parliament
members.
   It had been expected that West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker might visit for the anniversary. But the tentative plans
were dropped because of lingering diplomatic tensions between Poland
and West Germany, concerning among other things a stalled West
German aid package to Poland.
   The United States will be represented by Secretary of Veterans
Affairs Edward Derwinski, the highest ranking Polish-American in the
Bush administration. The Soviet Union, France, Great Britain are
among the other nations invited to participate.
