   Prayers and songs filled the air Tuesday
as thousands remembered the Jewish men and women who fought Nazi
Germany and died in the Warsaw ghetto 45 years ago.
   Late in the day, anti-Israeli Arab students marched to the main
monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and a PLO delegation laid a
wreath.
   The ceremony in which prayers, songs and flowers were offered in
memory of the dead took place at midday on the broad plaza in front
of the Ghetto Fighters Monument.
   At 4:30 p.m., about 25 Arab and African students arrived at the
same site carrying banners criticizing Israeli conduct in the
occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They were
joined by a delegation from the Palestine Liberation Organization
diplomatic mission to Poland.
   As police looked on, the PLO group laid a wreath of white
lillies two yards from the wreath presented by the state of Israel.
   The wreath, draped with a colorful Arab scarf, said, ``From the
fallen in the Palestinian uprising to the heroes of the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising.''
   Exactly 45 years ago Tuesday, heavily armed squadrons of Nazi
troops entered the walled Jewish quarter of Warsaw, bent on the
quick annihilation of the last 70,000 inhabitants. Instead, they
were routed by the starving, poorly armed residents, who started a
doomed three-week struggle.
   Before the main cerresenting
veterans groups, Jewish communities worldwide and Polish
organizations laid wreath after wreath of flowers at the foot of
the monument, a bold relief of armed fighters crouched together
facing their foes.
   The monument, near the city's heart, was the very first erected
in the destroyed left bank of Warsaw after the war.
   As a crowd of about 4,000 Poles and Israelis stood side by side
under the leaden sky, a cantor sang Kaddish, the Jewish song of
mourning. And Rabbi Isser Frankel of Tel Aviv prayed for the
victims of the ghetto and the Nazi Holocaust in Poland.
   Later, when the Polish officials and military honor guard
withdrew, Israelis in the crowd burst into singing of their
national anthem, Hatikvah (The Hope).
   Poland and Israel do not have full-fledged diplomatic relations.
   Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon, in Poland on a visit
considered private, addressed the crowd and expressed thanks to
Polish authorities for the ceremony.
   He also spoke of the Holocaust in which 6 million Jews were put
to death in World War II, 3 million of them Polish Jews.
   ``We have to remember, yes, but not a paralyzing memory,'' he
said in English. ``Not only remember the past, but we should derive
a new determination from that tragedy to continue living.''
   An assembly at Warsaw's Palace of Culture and Science took place
later in the day, with speeches marking the anniversary.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski was absent from the main
ceremony, but met Tuesday with a delegation of the visiting Jewish
leaders.
   About 3,000 people from Israel and around the world have come to
Poland for the observances beginning April 14, fewer than the 4,500
originally expected.
   Jewish visitors to Poland objected five years ago when
Palestinian diplomats were allowed to lay flowers at the main
ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of the ghetto uprising.
   This year, Polish officials did not invite diplomats to take
part in the ceremony at the monument. But representatives of
several nations held private wreath-layings later in the day.
   The last diplomatic group was led by deputy chief of the PLO
mission in Warsaw, Shawki Al-Omari.
   Julius Spiegel of New York City watched the scene and said
afterward he had no objections to the wreath-laying.
   ``They have a right. I have no sympathy for terrorism, of
course, but I have some sympathy for the Palestinian people. I
think it was quite dignified,'' he said.
   The Polish state-run news agency PAP, meanwhile, distributed a
text of a letter from PLO Ambassador Abdullah Hijazi to Polish
officials likening Nazi fascism in World War II to Israeli
``fascism'' in the occupied West Bank.
   The letter expressed ``deepest respect for the fallen of the
Warsaw ghetto.''
