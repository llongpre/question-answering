 -- Happy memories of the day mingled with painful recollections of the past as 
Warsaw saw its first wedding in a synagogue since the Holocaust. Families and a 
few members of the city's once-thriving Jewish community watched as American 
Jew Robert Blum and his Polish-born bride, Joanna Kan, exchanged vows. The good 
wishes came multilingually: "Congratulations," "Mazel tov" and "Wszystkiego 
najlepszego na nowej drodze zycia" -- the last Polish for "All the best on the 
new road of life." Blum, who met his wife at work in New York, said he hopes 
the wedding will help rejuvenate Poland's Jewish community. Fewer than 300,000 
of the nation's Jews survived World War II, and emigration cut their number to 
fewer than 10,000, most of them elderly. Warsaw, which itself once held 380,000 
Jews and 400 synagogues, now has only one synagogue, rebuilt in 1983. The 
rabbi, Menachen Joskowitz, a Polish concentration camp survivor, arrived from 
Israel about six weeks ago for a two-year stay.

 -- Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and several thousand others gathered to 
make a mountain out of a milestone, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 
addition of President Theodore Roosevelt's face to Mt. Rushmore. A 
45-by-90-foot flag was unveiled over Roosevelt's likeness as Mary Ellis Vhay, 
daughter of Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum, greeted the crowd. Mt. Rushmore, 
in South Dakota's Black Hills, also includes the faces of Presidents George 
Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. The anniversary was also used 
to launch a $40-million fund-raising effort to expand and improve the monument, 
and the state of South Dakota contributed $150,000. But one of the original 
workers on the sculpture, Howard Peterson, said Borglum "didn't want any of 
this stuff, the concession stands and all."

 -- In an emotional farewell speech to the National Education Assn. she leads, 
Mary Hatwood Futrell called on teachers to "embrace change" and to remember her 
as having "chalk dust on the sleeves of her soul." The six-year president of 
the 2-million-member union was interrupted more than 60 times by cheers, 
applause and standing ovations. About 8,400 delegates to the NEA Representative 
Assembly in Washington are to vote on Futrell's successor today. DAVE JOHNSON

A Newsmakers column published in editions of July 3 erroneously referred to a 
rabbi as being a survivor of a World War II Polish concentration camp. It 
should have been described as a Nazi concentration camp.
