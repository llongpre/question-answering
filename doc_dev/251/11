   At Potsdam, where world leaders reshaped Europe at the end of
World War II, events brought East and West together again Tuesday,
to survey a Europe that is reshaping itself.
   At Potsdam, in the summer of 1945, the ``Big Three'' _
Churchill, Stalin and Truman _ reordered the postwar world.
   At Potsdam on Tuesday, the secretary of state, James A. Baker
III, met East Germany's new communist premier, Hans Modrow, with
far less certainty that they could fix, or even anticipate, the new
world order.
   Potsdam is a lakeside suburb of Berlin. It was the seat of power
of the Hohenzollern family, which ruled Prussia before World War I.
It was where word was flashed to Harry Truman that the atom bomb
had been successfully tested in the New Mexico desert.
   Truman told Winston Churchill about the bomb and Churchill
replied, ``This is the Second Coming, in wrath.'' Josef Stalin told
Truman that the Soviet Union would enter the war against Japan.
   At Potsdam, the three men agreed to the division of Germany and
accepted the Russian occupation of East Europe. It was to be a
temporary expedient, but, until the remarkable autumn of 1989, it
became a lasting arrangement.
   The hot war had not ended but the Cold War had started.
   Now _ maybe _ it is ending, at Potsdam, at the Berlin Wall, and
on the streets and in the parliament halls of East Europe. Mikhail
Gorbachev says it is already over but President Bush says he is not
prepared to go that far.
   Baker and Modrow met, just as Bush and Gorbachev met 10 days
earlier off Malta, to size up the direction of a world in flux.
   The secretary and the premier could not hope to take charge of
where it was going. People in the streets of Berlin had brought
down the wall with willpower and hammers and chisels. Berliners
brought down Erich Honecker, the old hardliner, and even Egon
Krenz, Honecker's more conciliatory successor.
   While Baker and Modrow met, Gorbachev was in Moscow staving off
an attempt in the Soviet Parliament to install a multiparty system
in the Soviet Union.
   In Czechoslovakia, the parliament formally accepted the
resignations of that country's ousted hard-line Communists, who sat
by with stony faces. From Sofia came word that the fever had spread
to yet another bloc country; Bulgarian Communist Party leader Petar
Mladenov offered to renounce the party's ``leading role'' and
engage in dialogue with his critics.
   One day's news from the East.
   Truman had not been in office four months and World War II had
not yet ended in the Pacific when he secretly boarded the USS
Augusta for the eight-day trip to Europe and his first meeting with
Stalin, whose arrival at Potsdam was delayed by a slight heart
attack, and with Churchill, who brought along opposition leader
Clement Attlee because it was uncertain who would win the election
at home.
   Britons had gone to the polls but the soldier vote had not been
gathered. Churchill and Attlee broke off the talks to await the
returns at home. When the vote was in, the wartime prime minister
had been ousted by a war-weary nation. Attlee returned to the
conference alone.
   The three leaders conferred over a 16-day period, agreeing on a
``provisional'' division of Germany that has lasted 44 years.
Truman asked for free elections in Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria.
   Stalin said no deal. According to historians Samuel Eliot
Morison, Henry Steele Commager and William Leuchtenburg, the Soviet
replied, ``Any freely elected government in these countries will be
an anti-Soviet government, and we cannot allow that.''
   The Soviets took over the Baltics and vast stretches of Poland;
they installed communist governments in East Germany and all the
lands they occupied when the fighting ended. Arrangements that were
intended to be temporary hardened.
   On Tuesday, the United States and East Germany conferred again
about the future.
   After seeing Baker, Modrow said, ``We started a dialogue with
each other today.'' But it was clear that the last word in this
dialogue will be spoken by the people.
