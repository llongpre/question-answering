<LEADPARA>  Japan's foreign minister Tuesday offered an acceptance of blame for his
country's role in World War II, expressing "deep remorse over the unbearable
suffering and sorrow Japan inflicted" by its "reckless" decision 50 years ago
this week to start a war with the United States.;   In an interview, Foreign
Minister Michio Watanabe said the Japanese government "isn't seeking any kind
of apology" from the United States for the atomic-bomb blasts at Hiroshima and
Nagasaki that brought the war to an end in 1945. President Bush said Sunday
the United States would not apologize for using the bombs.  </LEADPARA>
