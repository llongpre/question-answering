THERE ARE NO COMPELLING ARGUMENTS FOR STARTING A WAR WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL

The beat of Persian Gulf war drums has suddenly become very loud. Reiterating 
that Saddam Hussein is another Hitler, the Administration is now hinting that 
the mistreatment of U.S. hostages in Iraq and Kuwait will be used as a pretext 
for war. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is again sliding inexorably into a war the Congress has not 
sanctioned. Since 1945, American Presidents have committed U.S. troops to two 
major wars (Korea and Vietnam) and a host of lesser conflicts (most recently 
Panama, Grenada and Lebanon) without asking Congress to declare war. Dusting 
off the imperial presidency's supposed prerogatives, the Bush Administration 
has categorically refused to promise that it will seek congressional 
authorization before initiating hostilities against Iraq. Congress should act 
now -- before it is too late -- and prohibit the use of U.S. forces in 
offensive actions against Iraq unless Congress expressly approves. 
</P>
<P>
By making the President commander in chief while reserving to Congress the 
power to declare war and ratify treaties, the Framers issued -- in 
constitutional scholar Edward S. Corwin's oft-quoted observation -- an 
invitation for the two branches to struggle for supremacy in conducting foreign 
policy. Nevertheless, until the end of World War II, it was clearly understood 
that a President could not commit U.S. forces to a major conflict without the 
consent of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War's exigencies upset the delicate constitutional balance. To meet 
the perceived communist threat in a world that was viewed as bipolar both 
geopolitically and ideologically, the United States became a national security 
state -- permanently mobilized for war in order to contain communism worldwide. 
Executive-branch authority increased dramatically while congressional power 
eroded (and, to a large degree, was abdicated voluntarily). In a nuclear world, 
it was said, the President needed a free hand to respond quickly to global 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
In the Persian Gulf crisis, however, there are no compelling arguments for 
allowing the Administration to start a war without first obtaining 
congressional consent. Americans and their elected representatives have the 
time to debate Washington's Persian Gulf policy, a debate too important to be 
left to street demonstrations staged by aging 1960s radicals. The Persian Gulf 
crisis is not a Cold War superpower confrontation with all the possibilities of 
sudden escalation to the nuclear level that such a clash could entail. There is 
no imminent danger to America's territorial integrity, to its physical and 
economic security or even to the global balance of power. Thus, none of the 
conditions cited during the Cold War as support for unconstrained presidential 
authority to use the military apply in this case. This crisis has dragged on 
more than three months, and there is time to reflect before making the fateful 
decision for war in the gulf, a conflict that may not end quickly and will 
assuredly cost many American lives. 
</P>
<P>
A sober assessment of U.S. policy objectives in the gulf is needed. Will 
vanquishing Iraq really bring stability to that perennially volatile region? 
Will the anti-Iraq coalition hold together if the United States strikes Iraq 
first? What impact will an American-initiated war have on moderate Arab 
governments -- and on Arab populations? How will Washington's policy affect 
U.S.-Israeli relations? 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the issues pertinent to the immediate crisis, Bush's whole notion of a 
"new world order" needs to be scrutinized. In the post-Cold War era, it is far 
from clear that America must remain the world's policeman, or that it can 
afford to do so. In this sense, the Persian Gulf crisis provides the 
opportunity for a new, full-scale "Great Debate" about America's purposes and 
world role. 
</P>
<P>
Wars are easy to start but often difficult to end. Thus the hard questions -- 
the nature of America's security interests, the feasibility of Washington's 
objectives and the relationship of military means to policy ends must be asked 
before the shooting starts. 
</P>
<P>
In its historic 1966 hearings, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked the 
right questions about U.S. policy in Vietnam. But it was too late to halt the 
march of folly in Southeast Asia, because vast numbers of American troops had 
already been committed to combat. Congress should not make that mistake again. 
Morally and constitutionally, it is time for Congress to assert its 
foreign-policy prerogatives -- especially the power to declare war -- in the 
Persian Gulf crisis.
