   For the millions of people who were born
after World War II, the solemn ceremonies marking the 50th
anniversary of the German invasion of this nation amounted to a
history lesson.
   For the Poles who lived through the carnage, the memorials
marking the Sept. 1, 1939, outbreak of the war have brought back a
flood of memories.
   ``I survived,'' said Alexandra Sikorska, who served as a courier
for the Polish resistance.
   She said she cried watching televised memorial ceremonies from
Westerplatte, the Baltic peninsula in Gdansk where a German
battleship fired the first salvos of the war at a small Polish
garrison.
   ``Young people were taking a pledge, and I remembered I was young
too then. All my life seems strange because my young days were at
that time,'' she said.
   Mrs. Sikorska, 70, said when the war began she built barricades
against Nazi tanks with paving stones. Then, she carried messages
for the resistance.
   ``I was always thinking that I would be taking part in everything
until the very end,'' she said, her medal of valor dangling from her
collar as she stood in Warsaw's Castle Square during a peace
ceremony marking Friday's anniversary.
   A bronze memorial filling half a city block is being completed to
honor the valiant but doomed stand against the Germans during the
Warsaw Uprising of 1944. Two hundred thousand people in the city
died in the fighting, and the reprisal massacres that followed.
   Nationwide, 6 million Poles died in the war, including 3 million
Jews, and much of Poland was reduced to rubble.
   Proudly wearing combat medals at the ceremony were two men who
started the war as Poles and ended it as citizens of territory
annexed by the Soviet Union.
   ``In September 1939, my friend and I were the first to fight the
Germans. We had active duty that day,'' said Jozef Zamojdzin, still
speaking his native Polish.
   They fought ``not to allow the enemy to tread on Polish soil,''
said his friend, Stefan Sidoromek, ``But we had to face enormous
violence and we were not able to overcome it.''
   They eventually joined the Polish army that the Soviets allowed
to be reformed on their territory after the Germans attacked their
former ally.
   Both men showed honors from the battle of Monte Cassino, one of
the Polish army's many heroic efforts through Africa and Italy.
   ``A soldier is a soldier in order to defend the homeland, and to
be victorious,'' Zamojdzin said.
