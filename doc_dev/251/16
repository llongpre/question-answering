   Leaders of the once-banned Solidarity
movement flanked President Wojciech Jaruzelski today as he paid
homage to the small Polish garrison in this Baltic port that bore
the first fierce Nazi onslaught of World War II.
   In the remarkable and apparently unplanned display of national
unity, joining Jaruzelski at the 50th anniversary ceremony were
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and newly elected Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a longtime Solidarity activist.
   ``On this day of great national memories we look not only into
the past but also into the future, into the near future and that
which is still far ahead,'' Jaruzelski said.
   ``We should never again be weak, quarreling or isolated,'' he
said. ``Tomorrow Poland must be stronger than today, through its
economic potential and most of all through mutual effort, agreement
and national reconciliation.''
   Jaruzelski and Mazowiecki were to return later to Warsaw, where a
day of world prayer for peace was planned. Also scheduled was an
internationally broadcast concert for peace led by American
conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein at the city's Grand Theater.
   As Jaruzelski spoke at Westerplatte, standing by were 53 veterans
of the legendary Polish garrison on the small peninsula who endured
the guns of the German warship Schleswig-Holstein and staved off a
determined infantry assault for seven days.
   World War II began with the battleship's opening salvo on
Westerplatte, a Polish outpost in then pro-German Free City of
Danzig, at 4:45 a.m. on Sept. 1, 1939.
   At dozens of points along the Polish frontier, the Nazi
``blitzkrieg'' began without warning. A lightning-fast Panzer-led
invasion by 1.5 million German troops obliterated the last organized
Polish army units by Oct. 5.
   Britain and France, after demanding the Germans withdraw, honored
treaty obligations and declared war on Hitler on Sept. 3.
   The stubborn resistance of the 182 Polish soldiers on
Westerplatte, isolated from the rest of Poland, served as an
inspiration for Poles who continued the battle against Hitler until
the march into Berlin nearly six years later.
   Mazowiecki was scheduled to be at the ceremony today, but
Walesa's presence was apparently a spontaneous decision. ``Simple
courtesy requires it,'' he said.
   Walesa, Mazowiecki and Senate Speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski _
another Solidarity activist _ earlier visited the workers monument
erected by the free trade union in 1980 in front of the Lenin
Shipyard where it was born.
   Mazowiecki was in Warsaw on Thursday to continue delicate
negotiations on forming his new government while Solidarity marked
the ninth anniversary of the accords that founded the East bloc's
first legal independent union.
   Today, several hundred supporters sang ``May He Live 100 Years''
to the prime minister as he walked to the monument with Walesa,
their hands raised in the V-for-victory sign.
   Mazowiecki laid red-and-white flowers at the towering columns
dedicated to workers killed during riots along the Baltic coast in
1970.
   Then they bowed to the crowd and Walesa led the singing of the
Polish national anthem.
   As the leaders made their way back to their cars en route to
Westerplatte, the crowd started chanting ``Mazowiecki, Mazowiecki''
and reached out to touch the prime miniser.
   Stelmachowski, taking in the sight of the former political
prisoners now celebrating their victories against Communist control,
said: ``I still have an impression that I am playing a strange part
in a very strange theater.''
   In Warsaw meanwhile, Walter Momper, the governing mayor of
Berlin, visited the monument to the final desperate uprising in the
Jewish ghetto in 1943.
   ``For us as Germans, it is always necessary that we come here and
remember what happened to the ghetto,'' said Momper.
   The Solidarity-dominated Polish Senate adopted a statement on the
war that said the anniversary should be a day of ``new horizons of
reconciliation.''
   ``More than 6 million Polish citizens lost their lives on the
battlefield, as victims of premeditated extermination, or in slave
labor in Nazi concentration camps and Stalin's Gulag,'' the Senate
said.
   Nearly one out of every five Poles living in 1939 died in the
war. The victims included 3 million Polish Jews, 15,000 Polish
officers believed massacred on Stalin's orders at Katyn and
elsewhere in the Soviet Union, 200,000 residents of Warsaw who died
in the capital's doomed 1944 uprising and boy and girl scouts who
organized underground resistance units.
