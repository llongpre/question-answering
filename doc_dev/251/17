   Thousands of people from around the world
joined Polish officials today in offering flowers and prayers to
the memory of fallen anti-Nazi warriors of the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto
Uprising.
   The 45th anniversary ceremony took place on a broad plaza in
front of the Ghetto Fighters Monument in Warsaw, where the sounds
of gunfire echoed on the morning of April 19, 1943.
   Heavily armed squadrons of German Nazi troops that day entered
the walled Jewish quarter bent on quick, final annihilation of the
last 70,000 inhabitants. Instead, they were routed, and the
starving, poorly armed residents held off Nazi troops for three
more weeks.
   ``We have to remember, yes, but not a paralyzing memory,''
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon told the crowd of about
4,000 people in English. ``Not only remember the past, but we
should derive a new determination from that tragedy to continue
living.''
   Navon, whose visit to Poland is considered private, expressed
thanks to Polish authorities for the ceremony. The two countries do
not have full-fledged diplomatic relations.
   Six million Jews were put to death in the World War II
Holocaust, 3 million of them Polish.
   Earlier today, about 100 Arab and African students carrying
Palestinian flags briefly marched through the city, also to
commemorate the Ghetto fighters.
   The students drew parallels between the ghetto battles and the
4{-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip. The protesters distributed leaflets to passers-by,
recounting what they said were Israeli cruelties.
   Before the official ceremony, Henryk Jablonski, chairman of the
Polish veteran organization Zbowid which organized the observance,
planted an oak tree on the plaza as a symbol of hope.
   Then, to the beat of military drums, delegations from veterans,
Jewish, and Polish groups laid wreath after wreath of flowers at
the foot of the monument, a relief of armed fighters crouched
together facing their foes.
   The monument, near the city's heart, was the first erected on
the destroyed left bank of Warsaw after the war.
   As Poles and Israelis stood side by side around the square, a
cantor sang Kaddish, the Jewish song of mourning. Rabbi Isser
Frankel of Tel Aviv prayed for the victims of the ghetto and the
Nazi Holocaust in Poland.
   Later, when the Polish officials and military honor guard
withdrew, Israelis in the crowd burst into singing of their
national anthem.
   About 3,000 people from Israel and around the world came to
Poland for the observance week, which began Thursday.
