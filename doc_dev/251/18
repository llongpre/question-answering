   Construction is to begin Monday on a
religious center to house Roman Catholic nuns who have outraged
many Jews by refusing to leave a convent at the edge of the
Auschwitz death camp.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Edgar Bronfman, president
of the World Jewish Congress, are to announce the start of building
after meeting in Warsaw, spokesmen said.
   The groundbreaking will come nearly a year after the Feb. 22,
1989, deadline for moving the nuns under a 1987 accord reached by
Catholic and Jewish religious leaders in Geneva.
   Jewish groups and others view the presence of the small group of
Carmelite nuns as an offensive intrusion of Christianity at the
death camp, built by the Nazis mainly to exterminate Jews because
of their religion.
   Despite the Geneva agreement, the Polish church _ with backing
from other quarters in overwhelmingly Catholic Poland _ balked at
moving the nuns from a former theater used by the Nazis as a
warehouse to store Zyklon B cylinders for the gas chambers.
   After international outcry grew, the Vatican intervened and
announced its support for the construction of the religious center.
It will be a quarter-mile from the death camp on a nine-acre site,
the official news agency PAP said Sunday.
   The presence of the Auschwitz convent represents a ``most, most
serious issue'' to the international Jewish community, which is
prepared to assist in transforming post-Communist Poland's
shattered economy, said Marem Stern, political consultant to the
World Jewish Conference.
   ``It is not that we are anti-Polish ... but it is an issue that
has to be solved, and quickly because with this whole opening of
Poland we have a lot of Jews who are ready to come here and
invest,'' Stern said in a Sunday interview.
   Bronfman will tell Mazowiecki that help is ready, ``but he will
also have to explain that he will not do anything until this is
solved,'' Stern said.
   The convent issue touches on deeply sensitive issues in Poland,
where a pre-World War II Jewish population of 3.5 million has been
reduced to several thousand.
   About 3 million Polish Jews were killed during the war. Most of
those who survived subsequently emigrated, the last wave of
departures taking place after an anti-Semitic political purge in
1968.
   Known officially as the Center for Information, Dialogue,
Education and Prayer at Auschwitz, the new building will include
meeting rooms, exhibition and conference halls, a library and
accommodations for nearly 100 people, PAP said.
   A separate section of the building will house the convent, the
Rev. Marek Glownia said in a statement. The archdiocese of Krakow
appointed Glownia to lead the center and oversee construction.
   The Vatican has pledged financial support for the construction,
and funds also will be raised by foundations and churches elsewhere
in Europe.
