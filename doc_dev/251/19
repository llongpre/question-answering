   Four thousand teen-agers from 36
countries, carrying the memories of 6 million Jews killed by the
Nazis, made a ``March of the Living'' Sunday from the Auschwitz
concentration camp to the crematoria of Birkenau.
   Writer Elie Wiesel, diplomats and Israeli parliamentarians
joined the young marchers for the two-mile walk marking Holocaust
Memorial Day.
   The march at the camp in southern Poland was in memory of those
who died in Nazi death camps as well as in the Warsaw ghetto
uprising that began April 19, 1943.
   The sunny day turned eerily cloudy and light rain started as
Wiesel stood at a podium before a gray stone monument to recall his
youth at Auschwitz:
   ``I see them, forever I see them. ... Years and years ago I saw,
I cannot tell you what I saw. I'm afraid that if I told you we
would all wake up in tears and would not be able to stop. I see a
young girl ... ,'' he said before stopping, apparently unable to
continue, and silently leaving the podium.
   Many cried as the students, all wearing blue shirts, some
carrying Israeli flags and others bouquets of flowers, walked along
the train tracks that ended at the cremetoria.
   Dandelions waved in the wind-swept grass now covering the rubble
of the camp. Torches were lighted, poems read and mournful violin
songs played before a reading of the kaddish, a Jewish prayer for
the dead.
   Television cameras positioned in former Nazi watchtowers
broadcast live to Israel, where solemn Holocaust remembrance events
were under way.
   As the march began, Galia Haber, a Jerusalem high school
student, recalled seeing the number the Nazis tattoed on her
grandmother's arm at Auschwitz.
   ``I remember when I saw her I thought of a supermarket with
numbered goods and I thought, did somebody buy her? ... It's very
sad to think that my grandmother, whom I love so much ... once was
just a number,'' she told Israeli radio, which broadcast the march
live.
   Shawn Tepper, 17, of Miami Beach, Fla, held hands with a row of
other young American Jews and said the experience was overwhelming
but ``proved to everyone that we are alive, we are together and we
are strong.''
   Sunday's event was the second ``March of the Living.''
Participants said it had special significance because of the drive
toward German unification and Israel's rapid renewal of ties with
Eastern European countries that once had flourishing Jewish
communities.
   The Nazis built the Auschwitz complex in southern Poland as the
main engine of Hitler's ``Final Solution.'' Estimates of the death
count vary, but recent research has put the toll at about 1.5
million, more than 90 percent Jews.
   There were 1,500 participants in the first ``March of the
Living,'' held in 1988 to mark the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw
ghetto uprising. In the battle, several hundred Jewish insurgents
staged a desperate three-week struggle against the Nazi drive to
liquidate the last 75,000 inhabitants of the walled ghetto.
   U.S. and Israeli organizers plan to hold the march every two
years.
   About 3 million Polish Jews perished during World War II. Most
of the approximately 500,000 who survived from the prewar
population subsequently emigrated, many during an anti-Semitic
purge in 1968, and there are now only several thousand Jews in
Poland.
