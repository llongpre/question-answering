   Poland's only rabbi said Thursday he won't
join leaders of other religions in a prayer for peace marking the
50th anniversary of World War II's start because of a Roman Catholic
convent at Auschwitz.
   Organizers had pointed to the participation of the rabbi _ a
survivor of the Nazi death camp _ as evidence that Jews were not
boycotting the event, led by Roman Catholics and bringing to Warsaw
representatives of many other faiths.
   ``I personally will not participate in the joint prayers. When I
go to Auschwitz I cannot pray there because I am disturbed by a
cross and the Carmelite convent there,'' said Rabbi Menachem
Joskowicz.
   ``One cannot be barred from prayer at Auschwitz and at the same
time participate in joint prayers in Warsaw,'' said the rabbi, who
arrived in Poland in June.
   The World Prayer for Peace was designed to foster understanding
among religions. Polish-born Pope John Paul II is to give an address
via a giant TV screen in Warsaw's Royal Castle Square on Friday, the
anniversary of the German invasion of Poland that started the war.
   ``This is a moment for peace and reconciliation, a meeting of
international friendship ... a day of peace, brotherhood of all the
world's relgions,'' said Roman Catholic Monsignior Pietro Rossano,
rector of the Pontifical Lateram University in Rome.
   But Jewish-Catholic relations have been strained by the decision
by the archbishop of Krakow to abandon a 1987 accord to move the
Carmelite convent from the perimeter of Auschwitz, and by a speech
by Cardinal Jozef Glempany.
   International Jewish leaders were invited to the event but said
they could not come, said Mario Marazziti, a prayer day organizer.
   Marazziti said the convent controversy ``may be one of the
reasons but not the only reason'' for the lack of greater Jewish
participation.
   There are no Jews on the list of religious representatives for
the event.
   Marazziti said three representatives of the Jewish community were
attending the conference but they were academic rather than
religious leaders.
   Jacob Neusner of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton
Unversity called the convent dispute a ``heartbreaking conflict''
between Catholics and Jews that shows the need for religions to
learn to accommodate each other.
   Marazziti said he received confirmation Aug. 20 that Joskowitz
would attend the prayer and had only heard informally that he would
not.
   The Rev. Wieslaw Nieweglowski, a prayer organizer for the Polish
Catholic episcopate, said he did not know about the rabbi's refusal
to take part.
   On Wednesday, Andrea Riccardi of the Catholic Community of St.
Egidio that organized the prayer day denied Jews were boycotting and
pointed to the rabbi's participation.
   Joskowitz said he would instead lead services Saturday at
Warsaw's only synagogue in memory of the 5,000 Jews who died
fighting with the Polish army during the war. Events also are
scheduled at the monument to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and at the
Jewish cemetery, large sections of which have become overgrown.
   Organizers of the peace prayer scheduled a trip to the
international monument at Birkenau, the main extermination camp for
Jews in the Auschwitz complex.
   Jewish groups and others view the convent as an intrusion of
Christian religious symbols at the World War II death camp complex
built in southern Poland mainly to exterminate Jews. Among the 4
million killed there, at least 2.5 million were Jews, and Joskowitz
called the site ``our biggest Jewish cemetery.''
   Protests increased after the passing of a Feb. 22 deadline for
moving the nuns to an interfaith prayer center farther away. In one
incident, an American rabbi and six students were roughed up while
being removed from the grounds.
   On Saturday, Glemp delivered a speech intended to quiet
international criticism after the Krakow archbishop's Aug. 10
announcement on the convent. Instead, the controversy seemed fueled
by Glemp's statement that anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews
abandoned ``anti-Polonism,'' or anti-Polish sentiments.
   ``I cannot believe that Cardinal Glemp thought what he was
reported to have said,'' said Joskowitz, recalling a recent cordial
meeting with him.
   ``I cannot speak for him but if I were him I would make some
declaration which would correct it. This would ... extinguish in
time the glimmer of anti-Semitism.
   ``I don't want Poland to become the country from which the flame
of anti-Semitism would start. ... It is easy to extinguish it now
when it is only a little glimmer but such a glimmer may in the end
burn the whole house,'' said the rabbi.
   Only several thousand Jews remain in Poland from a pre-war
population of 3.5 million. About 3 million Jews were among the 6
million Poles killed during World War II, and most of the rest have
emigrated.
   ``There are so few of us left in Poland and it would be a pity if
those few also left. I personally came after 45 years because I
wanted the Jewry to rise again on this ruin,'' said Joskowitz, who
survived the Lodz ghetto and Auschwitz to emigrate to Israel in 1947.
   ``I would not like to leave it all again if anti-Semitism starts
... in which case these few thousand Jews in Poland would lose their
rabbi,'' he said.
