   Rush hour traffic came to a two-minute
standstill today as the wail of air raid sirens opened Israel's
annual memorial day for the 6 million European Jews slain by the
Nazis in World War II.
   The nation's radio stations played melancholy tunes throughout
the day. Restaurants and houses of entertainment were shut by law
for 24 hours ending at sundown today.
   More than 100 memorial ceremonies were scheduled throughout the
country.
   Holocaust Day, officially called Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance
Day, is commemorated on the anniversary of the start of the Warsaw
Ghetto uprising of 1943, when Polish Jews used pistols to fight
Nazis in tanks.
   This year, the commemoration comes amidst a four-month spate of
anti-Israeli violence in the occupied territories that has claimed
the lives of 144 Palestinians and two Israelis.
   The conflict played a prominent role in an emotional speech
given by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir at a memorial ceremony at
Jerusalem's Yad Vashem monument Wednesday night.
   ``We again face the phenomenon of eternal hatred for the eternal
people ... When will the nations learn that they can never overcome
us and decide to leave us alone,'' Shamir said.
   ``Even today when we dwell in our own land, evil-hearted and
unfeeling people shoot poison arrows at our youngsters and they
wander the countryside, turning it into a valley of death,'' he
added.
   His statement was seen as an allusion to the killing of a
teen-aged Jewish settler during a clash in the West Bank village of
Beita last week as well as other attacks against Israelis in the
occupied areas.
   A Foreign Ministry official said Israel would seek
clarifications from Poland today about reports a government
spokesman in Warsaw criticized Israel's tactics in the occupied
territories and linked it to the Holocaust.
   The Polish spokesman, Jerzy Urban, said on Tuesday at a news
conference that Israel's ``brutal behavior'' was an ``offense to
the memory'' of the defenders of the Warsaw Ghetto.
   Despite the controversy, 2,000 Israelis, including teen-agers,
two Cabinet ministers and six legislators, flew to Warsaw this week
for observances of the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto
revolt, which took a month to crush.
   Although the generation of Holocaust survivors has dwindled in
numbers, interest in the tragedy has been rekindled in young
Israelis in part because of the war crimes trial of retired Ohio
autoworker John Demjanjuk, which was televised nationwide. Judges
are expected to issue a verdict next week.
   Demjanjuk is accused of operating the gas chambers at the
Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, where 850,000 Jews
perished. He claims he is a victim of mistaken identity.
   The renewed interest in the Holocaust was dramatized by a
well-attended concert Wednesday night staged by two popular rock
singers, Shlomo Artzi and Yehuda Policker, whose parents survived
concentration camps.
   Policker's new album, ``The Stop for Treblinka,'' is about the
trains used to ship Jews to the death camps.
   In an editorial, Al Hamishmar daily wrote: ``This year's
Holocaust Day distances us another year from those days of horror
but does not weaken their memory.''
   ``Survivors' children have absorbed the memory of the terror and
loss. It inhabits the world of every Israeli and has become an
inseparable part of the nation's memory and mission.''
