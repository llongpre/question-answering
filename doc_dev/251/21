   Remains of about 100 Jews killed by the
Nazis during World War II were reburied Tuesday in a ceremony
attended by 15 rabbis from around the world.
   The bones were discovered near the site of the old Jewish Ghetto
in Warsaw last summer during a construction project which since has
been abandoned.
   Historians determined that the site was a mass grave used by the
Nazis for Polish Jews who were shot or died of starvation in the
ghetto. Some non-Jewish Poles also were believed to be buried there.
   In the ceremony carried out during a light snowfall, about 100
wooden boxes of remains were carried by several dozen people from a
temporary storage area to a specially build crypt at the site.
   The rabbis removed the bones from the boxes, wrapped them in
white cloths and lowered them into pre-formed concrete cubicles. The
entire site is to become a monument to the victims of genocide.
   The ceremony, attended by Warsaw Mayor Jerzy Boleslawski and
other dignitarites, was organized by the Polish Veterans
Organization and by the Nissenbaum Foundation, which restores and
preserves Jewish monuments in Poland.
   ``We want to express our appreciation to the Polish government
for its courageous stand in preserving this entire area,'' said
Rabbi Hertz Frankel of New York, speaking at the ceremony.
   ``We participate in sorrow and mourning of our elder brothers,
who gave us the commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill,''' said Bishop
Henryk Muszczynski of Warsaw, who also took part in the prayers of
mourning led by the rabbis.
   Before World War II, Poland was home to 3.5 million Jews. About 3
million were slaughtered by the Nazis. Most of the rest left Poland
after the war, and today the Jewish population is estimated at about
10,000.
