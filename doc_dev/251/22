<LEADPARA>  FIFTY years ago the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. In a few hours on a Sunday
morning they woke Americans from their isolationist slumber and launched a
costly war Japan couldn't win.;   When the fighting ended four years later,
much of Japan had been incinerated, a deadly nuclear cloud hung over two
cities, hundreds of thousands of civilians were dead, the economy was in
ruins, the emperor was reduced from head of state to figurehead, and the
country was occupied by American soldiers.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AN APOLOGY? WHY?
JAPAN'S SURRENDER IN 1945 IS MORE MEANINGFUL THAN
ANY MEA CULPA OF TODAY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Are Japanese people sorry their nation attacked Pearl Harbor? Many are. Do
they owe us an apology? No.;   The 50th anniversary has stirred up
understandable feelings in Americans who lived through the attack or lost
loved ones in it. In two hours, 2,403 Americans died, and millions of lives
were changed. But Japan lost the war. Surrenders are worth more than
apologies.;   Besides being meaningless, war-related mea culpas have a
never-ending quality. A full accounting, for example, would have to deal not
only with Japanese guilt, but also with American excesses: Most of the
Japanese killed in the firebombing of Japan's major cities and the nuclear
flattening of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were civilians.;   Was that much loss of
innocent life necessary to win the war? Military historians have been debating
that for five decades. President Bush rejects suggestions that Washington
should apologize for President Harry Truman's decision to drop atomic bombs.
But by the same logic that leads some to demand an apology from Japan for
Pearl Harbor, four years from now -- on the 50th anniversary of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki -- others doubtless will argue that this nation owes Japan an apology
for those dreadful disasters.;   World War II ended in August 1945. Japan's
surrender was unequivocal. There would be no point to an apology from the
Japanese people in 1991. They didn't start the war. The only meaningful
apology would have to come from the leaders who gave the orders to attack.
Most are long gone.;   To the extent that 1991's renewed attention on Pearl
Harbor makes people everywhere sorrowful for the suffering caused by wars, we
say that's a positive thing.;   To the extent that some Japanese lawmakers
succeed in adopting contrite resolutions, that's fine too, if it makes them
feel better. But it has little practical value for today's U.S.-Japanese
relations.;   If focusing on Pearl Harbor makes it more difficult for some
Japanese fascists to deny their nation's responsibility for the war, and for
some educators to soft-pedal it, good.;   But the truth of the matter is,
examining our military past does not necessarily provide practical clues for
dealing with our economic present. The Japan of today makes Sonys and Toyotas,
not Zero fighter-bombers. And it is both our chief economic rival and, in
Asia, our main ally.  </TEXT>
