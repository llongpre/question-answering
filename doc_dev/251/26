   The city today dedicated a gleaming
monument to 300,000 Jews deported to Nazi deaths camps as its mayor
declared ``the struggle and courage of the Warsaw Ghetto will not
be forgotten.''
   `It is here where the kingdom of night reigned at its
cruelest,'' Miles Lehrman, chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Council, told the crowd of 3,000 gathered in Warsaw at the site of
the World War II deportations.
   The dedication came in observances of the 45th anniversary of
the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, when fighters from Jewish district's
last 70,000 people put up a desperate three-week resistance to the
final Nazi onslaught.
   The government has shown a mixed reaction to anniversary
observances. It initially branded as illegal a commemorative rally
including speakers from the outlawed trade federation Solidarity.
However, it did not intervene when the rally took place Sunday.
   In addition, authorities plan a huge observance of the
anniversary of the uprising, which began April 19, 1943. It will be
held Tuesday at the city's Ghetto Fighters Monument.
   Today, a military honor guard joined the crowd at Umschlagplatz
square for the morning dedication ceremony in sunny, breezy
weather. The crowd included Poles, Israelis, and other Jews from
around the world _ some children of concentration camp victims.
   The Umschlagplatz memorial was unveiled by Henryk Jablonski,
head of the Polish veterans association, which has organized the
official anniversary observances.
   Umschlagplatz, on the edge of the walled Jewish ghetto
established in Warsaw by the Nazis in 1940, was the square where
Jews were loaded into boxcars for the fatal trip to the Nazi camps
at Treblinka and Majdanek.
   ``Let subsequent generations remember about the tragedy of 45
years ago. The Jews of Warsaw, peace to their memory,'' Warsaw
Mayor Jerzy Boleslawski told the crowd.
   Israeli flags fluttered as a long line of people carrying flower
wreaths moved toward the monument, a marble rectangle inscribed
with the names of some of the victims of the 1942-43 deportations.
   Polish officials said today that a service station a few yards
from the monument would stay closed. It had offended the monument's
designer, Hanna Szmalenberg, and some of the foreign visitors.
   Three million Polish Jews and 3 million non-Jewish Poles were
killed from 1939-45, mostly in deliberate executions and death
camps.
   At the end of the war, only a few hundred thousand of Poland's
pre-war Jewish population of 3.5 million remained. Today, the
country's Jewish population is less then 10,000, mostly elderly
people.
