<LEADPARA>  I KNOW President Bush said this war is behind us, CNN has changed its glowing
orange "WAR in the GULF" logo for a cool blue "Toward peace" logo, but I'm not
quite ready to let go of my TV remote control. I've got swoopy-arrows
withdrawal. I miss Wolf Blitzer.;    And I find myself regretting there aren't
more things in the world that can be achieved by military means.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It is well that war is so terrible -- we would grow too fond of it," said
Gen. Robert E. Lee.;    We've just won a war that wasn't so terrible at all,
for our side, and it makes me happy and amazed and relieved and proud -- and
worried that this seemingly easy triumph will make us war-happy. Especially
those of us who didn't have to cross mine fields, or fly into anti-aircraft
fire, or wait for somebody to call and say "It wasn't me that got killed,
Mom," should not get too fond of war.;    The war was terrible for the Iraqis,
of course, but it was impossible to minimize our casualties and theirs
(except, of course, by not fighting at all, and ask the Kuwaitis how well that
works).;    The war was terrible for the families who lost loved ones, but of
the half million Americans who went to the Persian Gulf, only 100 or so
(depending on the fate of those missing in action) will come home in the body
bags that protesters promoted as the chief reason for opposing the war.;   
"Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result," Winston
Churchill wrote in 1898.;    Most of us weren't shot at, of course, but we
were prepared to see our nation's forces suffer terrible losses, and it didn't
happen. We killed them; they didn't get to kill us. It is exhilarating. And
dangerous, because it is exhilarating.;    The Vietnam War led to
post-traumatic stress syndrome; the gulf war surely will lead to post-triumph
euphoria syndrome. We are incredibly powerful. On the battlefield.;    I came
of age during the Vietnam War, and learned its sad lessons. Some of that old
wisdom held up pretty well.;    Vietnam taught political leaders not to play
general.;    Bush let Schwarzkopf be Schwarzkopf.;    Vietnam taught the armed
forces to avoid fighting without political support at home, not to escalate
gradually and to distrust the press.;    This time, everybody supported the
troops but that old eyeball-plucker Saddam. President Bush knew exactly what
he wanted -- the destruction of the Iraqi military and the utter humiliation
of Saddam Hussein -- and went for it.;    The press, which was vilified for
reporting from Baghdad and criticizing in Riyadh, ended up with Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf's thanks for, essentially, bad reporting that exaggerated U.S.
troop strength in the early days and for eagerly playing up the amphibious
landing that never was.;    (Once the reporting switched from Baghdad and
Riyadh to the front, the press reported totally from the point of view of the
allied forces -- "we" are advancing rapidly, "we" have seen light resistance,
etc. -- and ended up taking Iraqi prisoners and accepting the thanks of
Kuwaiti citizens, who thought they'd been liberated by CNN.);    Other lessons
of Vietnam proved false in the Persian Gulf.;    First Vietnam Lesson: The
United States can't win a Third World war; intervention abroad inevitably will
turn into a long, drawn-out, bloody disaster.;    Second Lesson: Our enemies
are fiercely dedicated and will never give up the struggle against us, no
matter how much suffering they must endure.;    Third Lesson: Our military
leaders are incompetent boobs, throwing away our soldiers' lives.;    Fourth
Lesson: A war can't be won from the air.;    Fifth Lesson: War is hell.;   
The Persian Gulf War has rewritten the lesson book.;    First Kuwait Lesson:
We can do anything we want against a Third World army, even one that's very
large and well-equipped, and do it quickly and with few casualties.;    Second
Lesson: Our enemies speak loudly and surrender quickly.;    Third Lesson: Our
military leaders and our fighting forces are very competent; our weapons
work.;    Fourth Lesson: We can win most of a war from the air, destroying the
enemy's ability and will to fight, and then sending in ground forces to mop
up.;    Fifth Lesson: War is fun.;    Of course, coalition forces won a swift
and stunning victory because the Iraqis chose to fight a conventional battle
that allied forces were very well prepared to fight. Saddam was stupid.;   
Other new world order wars might not be fought on our terms. Quick victory in
Kuwait doesn't imply, for instance, that the U.S. military could win "the drug
war" in Peru, or finish off the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, or tidy up Africa's
civil wars.;    It doesn't even mean we can stabilize the Middle East. Blowing
up tanks is easy; stability is hard.;    Still, it's hard to be humble. We
fought the biggest tank battle since World War II and didn't lose a tank or a
soldier. That's amazing. That's bizarre. That's not the way war is supposed to
be.;    And almost all the killing in this war -- by both sides -- was done at
a distance, without a glimpse of the faces of the killed. That makes it seem
less terrible.;    They warned us when the air war started not to be euphoric.
They warned us when the ground war started not to be euphoric. Now it's over,
and President Bush says it's no time to be euphoric.;    I think it is time to
be euphoric.;    OK. Time's over. Now what?  </TEXT>
