   Veterans from the unit that dropped the
atom bombs met Saturday to dedicate a peace memorial, but the
gathering's tone was marred when a Japanese journalist was
scratched off the speaker list for saying the bombings weren't
necessary.
   A planned rendition of the Japanese national anthem also was
removed from Saturday's program.
   The memorial was dedicated to the 2,000 members of the 509th
Composite Group, and the nearly 200,000 people who died in the
atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   The dedication was held in conjunction with the 509th's 45th
reunion and about 400 people gathered at the monument adjacent to
the Wendover Visitor's Center.
   Veterans said they believe peace was bought with the lives
claimed by the bombings. A chaplain gave thanks for the bomb.
   ``We thank thee God for the atom bomb, through which peace came
to our world,'' said the Rev. William B. Downey in dedicating the
16-foot granite obelisk topped with a brass model of the ``Enola
Gay,'' the B-29 that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.
   ``Lord keep that peace,'' Downey said.
   The 509th trained at the now-abandoned Wendover Air Base in
nearby Utah in 1944-45, a few hundred yards from where the memorial
was dedicated.
   Group organizers had invited Hideaki Kase, a conservative
Japanese author and advisor to two prime ministers, to speak of the
significance of the event.
   Kase is a controversial figure in Japan because he has advocated
bolstering the military and rewriting the Japanese constitution _
drawn up under U.S. auspices after World War II _ to allow Japan to
send its troops overseas.
   Friday night, Kase said Japan was ready to capitulate before the
bombs were dropped, making the destruction of the two cities
unnecessary. During Kase's presentation, dozens of veterans and
their wives walked out and sang ``God Bless America'' in the
hallway.
   Christopher Turoff, 69, a bombardier in the group, was one who
stayed.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he said later. ``He seemed to blame
the whole war on us.''
   Kase, who traveled to Wendover from Tokyo, said he was unclear
what portion of his speech offended his guests.
   ``What I talked about was that Japan was ready to give up the
war in early August,'' Kase said. ``That in retrospect the two
atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not necessary.''
   James Corliss, 69, who was flight engineer on one of the chase
planes on the Aug. 6, 1945, Hiroshima raid, said he was
``disgusted'' with Kase's rendition of history.
   ``He said we shouldn't have bombed at all,'' Corliss said. ``He
said we started the war.''
   Fearing a walkout at the dedication ceremony if Kase were
allowed to talk, reunion organizer George Marquardt told the
conductor of the Army band not to play the Japanese national anthem
and passed over Kase on the program.
   ``I feel awful about it,'' said Marquardt, a 70-year-old retired
major who now lives in Murray, Utah. ``But this is the 509th's
reunion. I couldn't have them walking out.''
   ``There would have been a riot,'' said Corliss.
   Kase said he was not offended by the last-minute decision to cut
him out of the program.
   ``I am a guest here,'' he said, ``You will have to ask them what
I said that was offensive.
   In an interview from Tokyo in the weeks before the event, Kase
said the bombings had been necessary because their demonstration of
power had prevented a major war since.
   Retired Gen. Paul W. Tibbets Jr., commander of the 509th and
pilot of the ``Enola Gay,'' which dropped the bomb on Hiroshima,
unveiled the memorial along with Marquardt and retired Gen. Charles
Sweeney, who piloted the bomber on the Nagasaki raid.
   Under Tibbetts' command, the 509th practiced high-altitude
precision bombing, flying long trips to California's Salton Sea
bombing range and the Caribbean Sea to simulate long, over-water
navigation.
   Only Tibbetts knew the group's true mission, and he demanded
unquestioning loyalty from those who didn't. All he told them was
that their efforts might save thousands of American lives and bring
the war to an early end.
