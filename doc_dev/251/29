"This movie is not entertainment," Max Von Sydow says, casting his eye over the 
bloody costumes of dozens of Japanese people lying in a church courtyard. "It's 
much more of a political statement." 
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow, who received a best actor Oscar nomination last year for "Pelle the 
Conqueror," is talking about NBC's "Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes," about the 
aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing. It airs at 9 p.m. on Sunday, the 45th 
anniversary of the day the United States dropped the first atomic bomb, on 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The pacifist in me made me interested in this project," he says, explaining 
his decision to portray a German Catholic priest working in Hiroshima on Aug. 
6, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good that we're sometimes reminded of important events in 
history. When Pope John Paul II visited Hiroshima recently, he says, 'We have 
to look to the past to learn for the future."' 
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow, who first came to worldwide notice 35 years ago through the films of 
fellow Swede Ingmar Bergman, explains he's not just talking about bombs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hiroshima has become a metaphor not just for nuclear war but for war and 
destruction and violence toward civilians," he says. "It's not just the idea we 
should not use nuclear arms. We should not start another war because it's 
madness." 
</P>
<P>
The scene today in Valencia, which is standing in for Hiroshima, occurs the day 
after the bomb fell. With two wind machines at work blowing smoke and dust in 
the actors' faces, the scene is eerily reminiscent of photographs taken of the 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black cassock, Von Sydow busily attends the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb on Hiroshima, which flattened 90% of the city, resulted in nearly 
130,000 casualties. A second bomb dropped on Nagasaki three days later prompted 
the Japanese to accept unconditional surrender, bringing an end to World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other movies that have examined America's decision to bomb Japan, the 
focus of "Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes" follows the survivors. In the ensemble 
film, Von Sydow shares billing with Judd Nelson (an American POW interned in a 
Hiroshima jail), Pat Morita (a Hiroshima postman), Tamlyn Tomito (a 
Japanese-American whose husband is in the Japanese Army) and Kim Miyori (a 
mother of a missing child). 
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow is reluctant to address the moral issues surrounding Hiroshima. "We 
don't know what would have happened if America hadn't dropped the bombs," he 
said. "It's easy to say that no bombs should have been dropped. But this was a 
war situation, and dropping them was an attempt to end the war." 
</P>
<P>
Although Von Sydow, 61, was too young to have fought in World War II, he did 
see its effects first-hand. In 1945 he was a high school student in Sweden, a 
country that remained neutral during the war. "That spring," he recalls, "the 
concentration camps were opened, and members of the Red Cross went in and 
brought a large number of prisoners to southern Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
"I belonged to a folk dance group that visited these poor, miserable people and 
performed for them. We were asked to learn a number of national anthems, and we 
sang them. It was an extremely emotional experience. Many of these people were 
in terrible shape. They looked like walking skeletons, but they were beaming 
with joy as we entertained them." 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by such a reception, Von Sydow ignored his parents' plan for him to 
enter college and instead pursued an acting career. "I was in such a hurry to 
be an actor," he remembers. "Now I'm sometimes mad at myself that I didn't stop 
and study for a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he attended Stockholm's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, began a stage 
career and then had the good fortune to meet Bergman. His work in the 
director's "The Seventh Seal," "The Magician" and "The Virgin Spring" brought 
him to the attention of Hollywood. In 1965, Von Sydow came to America to play 
Christ in "The Greatest Story Ever Told," and he has come back periodically 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the title role in "The Exorcist" and a small part in "Hannah and Her 
Sisters," as Barbara Hershey's intellectual lover, most of Von Sydow's work in 
Hollywood films has been villainous. "It's because I'm foreign," he explains in 
his ever-so-lightly accented English, Rand foreigners are very often villains." 
Since the success of "Pelle the Conqueror," an Oscar-winner in 1989 for best 
foreign film, Von Sydow thinks he has a new image in the United States. "Now 
I'm getting less villain offers and more normal people offers," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Even as his Hollywood career prospers, Von Sydow, who has lived in Rome and 
Paris for more than a decade, intends to move back to Sweden to pursue stage 
work. "If they want me, I'll do one limited theater engagement there every year 
and films the rest of the time," he says. "It's a daydream, but I hope it will 
work."
