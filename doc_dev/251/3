   Communist and Solidarity leaders joined to
mark the 50th anniversary of the Nazi invasion, and Pope John Paul
II called on all peoples to not use war to solve disputes.
   As Europeans commemorated the beginning of World War II Friday,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany expressed sorrow and regret
for the ``unspeakable suffering'' caused by the Nazis.
   In London, about 200 people gathered at the St. Pancras railway
station to remember their evacuation to the countryside to escape
Hitler's relentless ``blitzkrieg'' bombings.
   Rude Pravo, the Communist Party daily newspaper in
Czechoslovakia, called the conflict ``mankind's most terrible war.''
   Pope John Paul II participated in his homeland's ceremonies,
appearing on a large television screen overlooking Warsaw's Victory
Square in a broadcast from the Vatican.
   ``The memory of World War II, and the local conflicts that have
been going on for the past 50 years ... oblige all of us to persist
in the aim to eliminate war from all parts of the world, so it
ceases to be a tool for resolving disputes,'' the pontiff said in
his native tongue.
   The pope's speech was part of an international Day of Prayer for
Peace in Warsaw, attended by leaders of the Roman Catholic Church
and other religions. But Poland's only rabbi stayed away to protest
the presence of a Catholic convent outside the Auschwitz
concentration camp in southern Poland.
   On Friday evening, Leonard Bernstein conducted an anniversary
symphony concert at the Grand Theater.
   Solidarity leaders joined Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski
in a display of national unity at the Baltic port of Gdansk as the
country honored the small Polish garrison that the Nazis attacked on
Sept. 1, 1939, to start World War II.
   On one side of Jaruzelski was Solidarity leader Lech Walesa; on
the other was newly elected Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a
longtime Solidarity adviser.
   ``We should never again be weak, quarreling or isolated,'' said
Jaruzelski. ``Tomorrow, Poland must be stronger than today, through
its economic potential and most of all through mutual effort,
agreement and national reconciliation.''
   Sitting in the front row were 53 veterans of the legendary
garrison that endured the guns of the German warship
Schleswig-Holstein and staved off a determined infantry assault for
seven days.
   World War II killed more than 50 million people, including 6
million Jews exterminated by the Nazis. By the time the fighting
ended in 1945, the United States had forever changed warfare by
dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   Kohl, in a speech to the West German Parliament in Bonn, singled
out the first nation to fall in the war.
   ``We seek understanding between the German and Polish peoples,''
he said. ``This is our duty and it accords with the yearning of both
nations.
   ``It is true that too many people in Germany and some abroad were
blinded and deceived by that tyrant,'' Kohl said of Adolf Hitler.
   ``Who among us can say with a good conscience that, confronted
with such evil, they would have summoned the strength to be martyrs?
And who among us can judge what it meant at that time to risk not
only one's own life but the lives of one's family as well?'' he
asked.
