<TEXT>     (check) Step up the pressure.;    Until Jan. 16, our agenda was to keep the
war from starting. We were dealing with hypothetical deaths. Now we are
dealing with real deaths. Now it has been unleashed and we abhor what we see.
There are more reasons than ever to try to restore peace.;     A common goal; 
Different people will use different means to reach that goal. There need to be
more rallies, more marches, more expressions of outrage, more letters to
Congress, more demonstrations in front of the White House and elsewhere. Some
of our actions will result from frustration, some from cool, rational
analysis. But all of our actions must make clear to our policy-makers that we
are not a docile or willing people.;    In the course of protest, we will be
asked, "Don't you care about the American soldiers in the Middle East?" Our
answer must be, "We care. We care too much about them -- and all other
soldiers -- to consign them to destructive desert warfare. We want them back
home, creating families rather than corpses.";    (check) Keep everything we
do non-violent.;    It will distort our message beyond recognition if we
appear to be saying that violence in the Mideast is all wrong, but violence at
home is all right. If our message is peace, our tactics must be peaceful. If
the true enemy is violence, we must be non-violent. Non-violence can include
civil disobedience, as Martin Luther King Jr. proved.;     Hatred is
destructive;  (check) Distinguish between anger and hatred.;    In this new
situation, anger is a virtue. Anger can be creative. It can motivate people to
change. It can cleanse. It can empower. Hatred can only be destructive. To
hate another is to deny that person full humanity. When we hate, we deny our
own humanity as well.;    To be angry at George Bush and his policies is
surely part of being for peace. But to hate George Bush is inappropriate. We
can be angry at what the system is forcing young men and women to do in the
Middle East, but we cannot hate them. They are trapped in a process they did
not create, and from which it will be almost impossible for them to
disengage.;    (check) Remain alert to how easily human rights and civil
rights are violated in wartime.;    It is a matter of national shame that the
Federal Bureau of Investigation has been interrogating Arab-Americans on the
assumption that they may be untrustworthy citizens. It recalls the ugly
treatment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.;    We must continue to
protest the curtain of military censorship that has already fallen on our
basic right to know what is really going on. It will little avail us to have
"victory" over a "tyrant" if the price of victory is adopting the tactics of
tyranny.;    (check) Scrutinize what the war is doing to our lives.;    We
want a world that is more caring: Let us care for one another now. We want a
world in which love is stronger than hate: Let us extend the circle of those
we love until no one in the human family is excluded.;     Turning to prayer; 
Many people concerned for peace are now going to churches, mosques and
synagogues to pray -- for the first time in years. Is that just a cop-out, or
is it a fresh recognition that we need a relationship to something more
ultimate than ourselves?;    The peace movement is committed to the ultimacy
of love. That is basically what prayer is: not words, but a fusion of words
and deeds. To pray for peace is hollow if we do not work for peace. Working
for peace frequently requires the infusion of a new empowerment that words of
prayer can sometimes channel. Perhaps we can rediscover in prayer deep
resources of energy and love we had not known were there. Then we can continue
to work for peace with determination and with hope.  </TEXT>
