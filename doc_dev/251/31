   A meeting between Japanese anti-nuclear
activists and officials of a high school whose symbol is a nuclear
mushroom broke up when the principal angrily declared that the
United States wasn't to blame for World War II, then left.
   Tuesday's meeting was called to discuss Japanese objections to
the Richland High School symbol, which celebrates the area's role
in the production of U.S. nuclear arms _ including plutonium in the
bomb that destroyed Nagasaki in World War II.
   ``We are not going to change our symbol because we believe it
has something to do with the heritage of our community,'' Principal
John Nash told a delegation of 35 Japanese who visited this town
adjacent to the giant Hanford nuclear reservation.
   ``I heard some things here that made me angry,'' Nash said. ``We
can go back to history and recall a lot of things about the war and
I could say some things here that would be very disruptive to you
people, but I'm not about to do this,'' Nash said.
   ``But I'm going to say one thing and you should remember this.
We did not start that war and I think that should end it.''
   Nash then walked out of the classroom, to the loud applause of
some residents in the south-central Washington city, leaving the
visitors to talk with faculty, students and reporters.
   ``It was not our intention to protest,'' said Masa Takubo, of
Washington, D.C., who served as interpreter. ``We wanted to present
our views and we wanted to understand his views.
   ``Unfortunately he had to leave in anger,'' Takubo said.
   ``I was embarrassed at my ex-principal,'' said Marcia Cilian, a
Richland High graduate. ``He interpreted it the wrong way. They
were not asking us to change it, just look at it another way.''
   Hours later, about 100 people who largely supported the Japanese
visitors attended an evening with them at the Richland Public
Library.
   However, Mary Baird, of Richland, defended the dropping of
atomic bombs on Japan at the end of the war, saying they prevented
even greater slaughter of Americans and Japanese.
   ``It's unfortunate that a nuclear war occurred, but I will not
accept the blame for my country,'' she said, noting that the
Japanese launched hostilities in the Pacific.
   The Japanese visitors have been in this country since May, when
they attended a United Nations special session on disarmament in
New York. Since then, they have been touring U.S. nuclear
facilities.
   Hanford was created by the Manhattan Project in World War II to
make plutonium for nuclear weapons. The jobs of up to 30,000
Richland residents are tied to the nuclear weapons industry, and
criticism of their role in that work is a sore point with many
locals.
   Earlier this year, an attempt by some teachers and residents to
eliminate the mushroom cloud symbol of the Richland High School
Bombers was overwhelmingly defeated in a student election, when
students voted instead to officially adopt the cloud as their
symbol.
   The widespread media attention given that election attracted the
Japanese delegation.
   Tuesday's meeting began quietly, with Nash escorting the
visitors into a classroom and welcoming them.
   But the meeting turned sour when Sakae Ito, a 77-year-old
survivor of the atomic attack on Hiroshima, made a lengthy speech
about military symbolism and asked Nash to change the school symbol
to something more peaceful ``like cranes or rainbows.''
   ``The mushroom cloud reminds us of the tragedy of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki,'' she said through the interpreter. ``I feel sorry and
sad people here support the mushroom cloud.''
   Nash replied that many athletic teams in the United States used
aggressive symbols and noted that students voted to make the cloud
their official emblem.
   ``I'm not going to change it,'' he said before walking out.
