   Riot troops ringed the house where Adolf
Hitler was born and police said they arrested eight people Thursday
for marking the 100th anniversary of the dictator's birth with Nazi
slogans and stiff-armed salutes.
   Hundreds of police swarmed this city of 17,000 people to prevent
a repeat of the 1979 clashes between neo-Nazis and leftists that
marked Hitler's 90th birthday. No serious incidents were reported.
   Across the border in West Germany, foreigners closed their
stores and kept children out of schools because of fears of
neo-Nazi violence. Several members of anti-Nazi vigilante groups
were arrested for carrying weapons.
   Security was heaviest here, at the two-story yellow house where
Hitler was born on April 20, 1889. The house, a former inn now used
as a day-care center for handicapped children, was sealed off with
metal barriers manned by dozens of police and special riot squads
with dogs.
   About 50 to 100 onlookers stood nearby. Nearly all shops along
the street were closed, some barricaded with wooden boards.
   Police said unspecified numbers of people were being turned back
at the border by West German or Austrian border police.
   A police spokesman said two Austrians, three Italians, two West
Germans and an American were arrested and face fines of up to
$2,300 for their public behavior.
   The Italians, one Austrian and the American gave the Nazi
salute, said a police official who did not give his name. One West
German was arrested after he shouted Nazi slogans and spat at
reporters. Police said he was carrying a large knife.
   Another West German also shouted anti-Semitic slogans, including
``Jew, go and rot!'' and ``This will be a national holiday in 100
years' time!''
   Officials did not identify those arrested. They were charged
with misdemeanors.
   On Wednesday, four Americans, an Irishman and a West German were
ordered by police to change their black boots and brown shirts,
garb reminiscent of Nazi uniforms, police said.
   ``Judging by what could have happened today, I am happy with the
security measures taken,'' Braunau Mayor Gerhard Skiba said.
   Skiba defended an anti-fascist memorial he ordered put up in
front of the ``Hitler House'' two weeks ago.
   ``I did not ask the city council, because I knew that the
(right-wing) Freedom party and part of the (conservative) Austrian
People's party were against it,'' he said.
   The memorial is made of granite from the quarry once worked by
prisoners at the nearby Nazi concentration camp of Mauthausen.
``For peace, freedom and democracy ... Never again fascism,
millions of dead warn,'' reads the inscription.
   Braunau was quiet, but at least four elderly people attracted
clusters of people as they glorified the Nazi past.
   ``The first and second world wars were started because Germany
was economically strong, too strong, and neither East nor West
wanted such an economic power,'' said one.
   In West Berlin, police arrested nine people who were driving
around in cars, apparently to defend against anti-Nazi attacks.
Police said they were carrying tear-gas pistols, helmets, clubs,
knives and other weapons.
   West Berlin police also said a Turkish cemetery was vandalized
early Thursday, with more than 38 grave stones were overturned or
damaged.
   Peter Frisch, vice-president of the Federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution in Frankfurt, said foreigners,
particularly Turks, are most vulnerable to attacks.
   Turks in recent years have flocked to West Germany in search of
jobs, triggering resentment among many working-class Germans.
   ``They (the Turks) have assumed the role that the Jews played in
the Nazi ideology,'' Frisch said on the North German radio station.
   In Hamburg districts that have large foreign populations, a
``considerable number'' of parents kept their children out of
schools,'' a school spokesman said.
   Neo-Nazi leaflets circulating in Hamburg recently threatened
violence against foreign schoolchildren.
   Some foreign shopowners closed their stores Thursday in Hamburg.
   In Oslo, Norway, the Dagbladet newspaper marked the day by
publishing a survey that asked 50 children what they knew about
Hitler.
   All said he started World War II, occupied Norway and other
countries for five years, killed millions of Jews and committed
suicide when losing the war.
   ``He was an evil man and probably insane,'' one youngster wrote.
