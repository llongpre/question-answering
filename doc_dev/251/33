   Conflict has heightened in the Roman Catholic church
over Polish primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp's refusal to honor an
agreement to move a convent away from the Auschwitz death camp.
   Three of the four cardinals who signed the pact with Jewish
leaders in 1987 insisted Sunday that it be carried out. They include
the leaders of France and Belgium's Catholics.
   The three were responding to Glemp's suggestion last week that
the accord be renegotiated.
   Prelates Albert Decourtray of Lyon and Godfried Danneels of
Brussels and fellow Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris said in a
statement that Glemp ``could only have been speaking for himself.''
   Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow, Poland, the other
cardinal who signed the agreement, said Aug. 19 that he was
suspending the accord because of ``aggressive'' demands and protests
by Jewish activists at the convent located in his diocese.
   Glemp later angered many Jews and non-Jews with a sermon Aug. 26
in which he said Polish anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews would
abandon anti-Polish sentiments.
   He asked Jews to understand that it offended Poles' religious
sensibilities and feelings of sovereignty to insist on removal of
the Carmelite convent, which in 1984 was set up just outside the
fence surrounding the former Nazi concentration camp.
   ``Dear Jews, do not talk to us from the position of a nation
elevated over all others and do not put to us conditions that are
impossible to meet,'' Glemp said in the sermon.
   Glemp offended many Jews by suggesting Jews helped spread
Communism, and by mentioning that some collaborated with Nazis
during World War II or as businessmen neglected or detested Poles.
   Pope John Paul II has not commented on the dispute. Vatican
officials said in Rome that the Polish-born pope believes the Polish
church must resolve it.
   Jewish groups say the convent and its Christian religious
symbols, including a 23-foot cross, offend the memory of the 2.5
million Jews who died there during World War II.
   Under the 1987 agreement between a Jewish delegation and the four
archbishops, the nuns were to have been moved by Feb. 22 to an
interfaith prayer center to be built several thousand yards away.
   Glemp was quoted Saturday in Italian newspapers as saying it was
``a scandal'' to move the convent:
   ``I want this accord to be renegotiated,'' Glemp was quoted as
saying. ``It has to be done by competent people and not by just any
cardinal who doesn't understand the things.''
   In their statement issued in Paris, Decourtray, Lustiger and
Danneels defended the agreement, which they said was ``patiently and
loyally negotiated over two years,'' and the capacity of the
negotiators on the two sides.
   ``If the Jewish delegation at the Geneva meetings, led by Mr.
Theo Klein, then president of the European Jewish Congress, is `not
competent,' who would be?'' they asked.
   ``And if four cardinals, including the archbishop of Krakow, are
not qualified to represent the Catholic side, who might be? The
Auschwitz camp is in the Krakow diocese. According to church law,
its archbishop has full authority there. The cardinals who
accompanied him belong to nations who, in the West, were among the
chief victims of the Hitler barbarism.''
   Many Poles argue that there is nothing offensive about nuns
praying at a site where large numbers of Roman Catholics, as well as
Jews, were killed.
   ``The Jews should understand that devoting oneself to a life of
prayer near the place where Christians were martyred doesn't offend
their feelings,'' Glemp was quoted as saying in the Italian
interview.
   Speaking to reporters Sunday in Lyon, Decourtray said he hoped
the dispute could be resolved without requiring intervention by the
pope, who was Macharski's predecessor as archbishop of Krakow.
   ``I'll say that I am a little shocked, a little hurt by Monsignor
Glemp's statements,'' Decourtray said. ``But I want a clear
understanding. Like Mr. Theo Klein, I want Auschwitz to become again
a sacred place.''
   In Warsaw, a spokesman for the Catholic Episcopate, Marek Pernel,
said today that Glemp had not seen the cardinals' statement that
there would be no immediate comment.
   The Glemp comments reported Saturday were the primate's first
published remarks on the convent issue since his Aug. 26 sermon.
   Seven Jews, including Rabbi Avi Weiss of New York City,
demonstrated July 14 at the convent.
   Glemp was quoted as saying, ``A squad of seven New York Jews
launched an attack against the convent, but did not kill the nuns or
destroy the convent only because they were stopped.''
   The seven demonstrators were roughly dragged away by workmen at
the camp.
   In Chicago, Jewish leaders have called for a boycott of Glemp
during his scheduled Sept. 21-25 visit.
   Only several thousand Jews remain in Poland from a pre-war
population of 3.5 million. About 3 million Jews were among the 6
million Poles killed during World War II, and most of the rest have
emigrated.
