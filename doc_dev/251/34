   Communist authorities have resurrected the
image of Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, the enigmatic revolutionary who
restored Polish statehood 70 years ago and deposed the government
eight years later.
   Once consigned to Stalinist oblivion, Pilsudski is now being
honored by those same authorities who once scorned him as a
reactionary dictator.
   The government also mounted a gala celebration today marking the
anniversary of the birth of the prewar republic. A parliamentarian
had asked that today _ Nov. 11, the main national holiday before
World War II _ be officially restored as a state holiday.
   Today's ceremonies in Warsaw included a rare televised Mass and a
military parade in Victory Square. It represented the most elaborate
celebration ever under communist authorities to mark the 1918
creation of the capitalist, anti-Soviet republic in Poland between
the two world wars.
   Earlier this week, Krakow authorities named a street for
Pilsudski and a Warsaw newspaper launched a drive to set up a museum
for the marshal in the house he owned in Sulejowek, outside the
capital.
   The cult of Pilsudski has never quite died out in Poland. Go into
the home of nearly every supporter of the banned Solidarity trade
union movement and you see on the wall next to the Solidarity emblem
and photographs of Polish-born John Paul II the bushy moustache and
fiery eyes of Pilsudski.
   In recent years the communist party, stressing its role of
guarantor of the nation's existence, has begun to embrace popular
national symbols such as Pilsudski. But historically, Pilsudski is
harder for communists to swallow.
   Although he started out as a socialist, he abandoned most leftist
trappings soon after taking power.
   One of his most-quoted remarks was, ``I rode the red streetcar of
socialism, but got off at the stop called `Independence.'''
   Pilsudski's orientation was anti-Russian. He dreamed of creating
a multinational Central European state that would be large enough to
resist both Soviet and German hegemony.
   One of his first acts was invading the Ukraine, capturing Kiev.
Polish forces eventually were forced to retreat by the Red Army,
which in turn seemed on the verge of crossing Poland and spreading
communism to Germany in 1920.
   But the Poles' brilliant counteraction in mid-August 1920 handed
the Red Army a humiliating defeat, still remembered in Poland as the
``Miracle on the Vistula.''
   Lenin sued for peace, giving up large chunks of previously
Russian territory that remained in Poland's hands until the Soviet
Union took it back at the start of World War II. Pilsudski and
``White Poland'' were deemed ``class enemies.''
   Pilsudski is considered a hero because he united the country and
defended its independence at the end of World War I.
   Poland had been erased from the map of Europe but not from the
minds of Poles during the previous 123 years, having been
partitioned by Prussia, Austria and Russia. World War I and the
Bolshevik Revolution saw the collapse of all three partitioning
powers, allowing Poland to regain independence.
   At the start of World War I, Pilsudski had raised a Polish army
and put it in the service of Austria against Russia. But he was
imprisoned by Austria's ally Germany when he refused to put his
legions under German command.
   When German ranks collapsed in a general panic at the end of the
war, Pilsudski was freed from the castle where he was held.
   After arriving in Warsaw on Nov. 10, 1918, local citizens gave
him the title of commander. He ordered the disarmament of remaining
German troops and declared the Polish Republic restored. Power was
legally transferred to his government Nov. 11 from a Regency Council
set up by the Germans.
   But his reputation lost some luster in 1926 when, impatient with
discord in the elected government, he came out of retirement to
stage a military coup in which 300 people were killed.
   Although nominally out of power, he became Poland's
behind-the-scenes dictator until 1935 when he died and was buried in
Krakow's Wawel Castle alongside Polish kings.
   His senior officers, calling themselves the ``Sanitation''
regime, continued to rule until German and Soviet invasions in 1939
again wiped Poland off the map.
   Postwar Poland saw a new social order, dominated by communists
supported by the Soviet Union. Institutions such as Warsaw
University, which had borne the name of Pilsudski, were renamed.
Nov. 11 was treated as an ordinary work day.
   But 40 years later, the pendulum has swung back, with Pilsudski
restored to the status of national hero.
