   Samuel Pisar saw the 50th anniversary of
World War II as a time to celebrate the triumph over evil, but the
dispute over a convent near the Auschwitz death camp he survived has
cast a shadow on his efforts at reconciliation.
   At the request of composer Leonard Bernstein, Pisar has written a
personal reminiscence of the destruction in his native land that he
will read at a concert Friday to mark the anniversary of the 1939
invasion of Poland by Germany that began the war.
   ``I decided to tackle it out of solidarity and out of a need for
reconciliation, because I don't believe in hereditary enemies of
history,'' Pisar said.
   ``This 50th anniversary is a very good moment to celebrate our
triumph over evil and move to a more hopeful future. I am telling a
Polish story, but also a Jewish story,'' he said.
   Pisar will narrate the concert which is to be broadcast live to
more than 20 countries. He plans to relate his experience, which he
says epitomizes that of many who endured World War II.
   He was 10 when the war struck his home city of Bialystok in
northeastern Poland. His mother wanted to flee, but his father,
whose family had been in Bialystok for several generations, did not.
   Pisar was the only member of his family to survive the years that
followed. The Gestapo killed his father and he lost his mother and
sister to the concentration camps that claimed the lives of at least
6 million other Jews.
   Sent from Auschwitz to camps in Germany as a forced laborer,
Pisar escaped from Dachau and was liberated by the American Army at
the age of 16.
   Now a lawyer in Paris, Pisar has made three previous trips to
Poland, accompanying American senators, international bankers and
former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
   This trip is more personal. Pisar brought his wife and three
children with him to visit his native city of Bialystok in
northeastern Poland and then to travel to Auschwitz.
   They have arrived to find that 50 years has not healed the
spiritual wounds of war, and that the historic tension between
Catholic and Jews still impedes reconciliation.
   The Roman Catholic hierarchy's decision Aug. 10 to abrograte a
1987 agreement to move a Carmelite convent away from the Auschwitz
camp and remarks Saturday by the leader of Poland's Roman Catholic
church has left many Jews, including Pisar, troubled.
   ``I am happy to be here and I feel that peace is fragile and the
spark of freedom that we witness here today and that is so
encouraging, is fragile and yet I feel a discomfort, I feel a pain,
deep physical pain,'' Pisar said.
   ``For some strange reason at this precise moment of history to
focus on tensions between Jews and Poles _ the two people that
suffered more than any others from the Second World War _ seems not
only unnecessary but ... why give Hitler, posthumously, such a
satisfaction?'' he said.
   As one of the youngest camps survivors, Pisar says he feels
compelled to speak out.
   ``I don't want any polemics with the cardinal, but with due
respect, his words, even if well-intended, were ill-chosen. I am
disappointed and surprised,'' Pisar said.
   He was referring to an address by Cardinal Jozef Glemp at the
Jasna Gora Monastery in Czestochowa, Poland's most revered shrine,
in which Glemp said there would be no anti-Semitism in Poland if
Jews abandon anti-Polish sentiments.
   Speaking about the convent, Glemp said the nuns wanted to be a
symbol of human solidarity with the living and the dead and that
asking them to leave would offend the feelings of Poles.
   Pisar acknowledged that not only Jews were killed in Auschwitz,
but he said the site belongs to no one and that he could not
tolerate the appropriation of the Holocaust by Christian symbols.
   ``Auschwitz is a place that belongs to everybody and no one,'' he
said. ``It is the greatest wound ever inflicted on our civilization
and its deserves respect ... silence.''
   ``I feel no anger to the Carmelite nuns. I think they are sincere
in their desire to pray. I respect that, but I think it would be
better if they prayed outside the perimeter of the death camp and I
think God would be able to hear them better if they did,'' he said.
   Pisar said he hoped that Pope John Paul II would use his moral
authority to stop the dispute before it festers.
   ``He can bring it to a stop, and I wish he would, and that the
dead would be left alone because it is really needed out of respect
for the dead and compassion for the living.'' He said.
