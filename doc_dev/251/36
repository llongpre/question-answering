   Anti-Semitism is increasing in Hungary,
a rabbi said Wednesday, and he called for ties with Israel during
the first parliamentary commemoration of Holocaust victims.
   Rabbi Alfred Schoener addressed a session of Parliament that
paid tribute to the 600,000 Hungarian Jews who died in the
Holocaust and to tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians who
perished in World War II.
   The commemoration came on the 45th anniversary of the start of
mass deportations of Hungarian Jews to death camps.
   ``I don't know whether there is more anti-Semitism in Hungary
today than before, but I must say it has become more open,''
Schoener said.
   Swastikas were painted on a synagogue wall, the windows of
Jewish seminaries were broken, and Jews were being insulted in the
streets, he said.
   ``We must not allow anti-Semitism to grow in our society which,
undergoing democratization, allows many things to happen,''
Schoener said.
   He also complained Hungarian school textbooks contain only
cursory mention of the Holocaust and ``for some reason the very
word `Jew' has been avoided in the media.''
   Schoener also criticized the absence of a memorial to the 6
million Jews killed by the Nazis in World War II.
   One way of remembering the deportations would be ``to establish
full diplomatic rlations with Israel, where many Holocaust
survivors and relatives of beloved ones still live,'' the rabbi
said.
   Hungary, along with the rest of the Warsaw Pact, broke off
diplomatic relations with Israel after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   Parliamentary speaker Matyas Szueroes reviewed wartime
atrocities and said the persecution of Jews and others considered
undesirable by the fascists were ``swept under the carpet'' by
Hungarian leaders after the war.
   ``Let us now discuss what we have not been able to discuss for
over 40 years,'' said the speaker.
   He proposed that Parliament draft legislation to commemorate all
wartime victims.
   ``Let us tell the world that we Hungarians and other
nationalities living in Hungary are resolved never to let this
happen again,'' Szueroes said.
   Four other parliamentarians took the floor to criticize official
unwillingness to come to terms with wartime tragedies.
   Deputy Laszlo Czoma mentioned a history book published in
Hungary in 1975 that discussed the loss of human lives in one
sentence. Another sentence was devoted to the wartime losses of
livestock, he added.
