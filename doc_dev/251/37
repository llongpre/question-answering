<HEAD>Israeli Foreign Minister Visits Auschwitz</HEAD>

   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel
visited on Wednesday the site of the Auschwitz death camp, where
millions of Jews died at the hands of their Nazi captors.
   ``You cannot travel to any country of Eastern Europe _ and
certainly not to Poland _ without pondering the tragic fate of the
Jewish nation during the last war,'' Arens said in an interview
with the government daily Rzeczpospolita Wednesday. He was visiting
Poland to renew full diplomatic ties.
   ``While being here, our delegation wants to go to all those
places where Jews have been killed.''
   Arens credited Poland with giving Jews ``great assistance''
during World War II, when an estimated 3 million of 3.5 million
Polish Jews were murdered by the Nazis. Millions of other Jews were
brought from across Europe to their deaths at camps in Poland.
   The Auschwitz complex and the adjacent Birkenau camp, an
integral part of German dictator Adolf Hitler's ``Final Solution,''
were built to exterminate Jews, and then Poles and other Slavs.
   Estimates of the death toll at the camp in southern Poland range
from 2.5 million to 4 million, the vast majority Jews.
   A Roman Catholic convent at the edge of the camp has strained
Jewish-Polish relations and stirred international controversy.
   Arens discussed the convent with Polish officials Tuesday. The
government underlined its support for building an alternate home
for the nuns. Ground was broken last week for an interfaith prayer
center, which will include a new convent.
   Arens visited the Majdanek concentration camp near Lublin in
southestern Poland on Monday at the start of his four-day visit.
   On Tuesday, Arens and Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof
Skubiszewski signed an accord establishing full diplomatic
relations after a 23-year break.
   Poland became the third Warsaw Pact country after Hungary and
Czechoslovakia to renew relations with Israel in the past six
months.
   Poland, like the entire Soviet bloc except Romania, cut off
relations in 1967 to support the Arab side in a Middle East war
that year.
