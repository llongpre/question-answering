   Thousands of people began arriving this
week for the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto Uprising,
when starving and poorly armed Poles held off the final Nazi
extermination drive for nearly a month.
   About 4,500 guests from throughout the world are expected for
the April 14-19 observances, including the largest Israeli
delegation ever to visit Poland.
   Poland severed diplomatic ties with Israel after the outbreak of
the Middle East War in 1967, when Israel seized the West Bank and
Gaza Strip from Egypt and Jordan. Low-level diplomatic ties resumed
in 1986, with the two countries establishing diplomatic section
offices in each others' capitals.
   The observances climax on April 19 with a ceremony at the Warsaw
Ghetto Fighters' Monument. The monument sits in a plaza in an
apartment complex built on the rubble of the former ghetto, which
was razed by the Nazis.
   Nazis marched into the ghetto early on April 19, 1943, expecting
to organize a rapid deportation and eradication of the last 70,000
inhabitants.
   But they were met with fierce gunfire from the young warriors of
the ghetto's Jewish Defense Organization. The standoff continued
until mid-May, when the Nazis claimed victory and began deporting
the surviving inhabitants to death camps.
   The anniversary events have been jointly organized by Polish and
Israeli committees.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told reporters Tuesday that
Poland will observe the anniversary as an event marking ``tragic
European and Polish events (which) refer to our past, predating the
creation of the state of Israel and the Middle East conflict.''
   He said Poland remains ``in full solidarity with the
Palestinians (in the Israeli-occupied territories) fighting for
their human and national rights.''
   He called Israel's behavior in the territories ``brutal'' and
``an offense to the memory of the defenders of the Warsaw Ghetto
... Contradictory to the ideals'' for which they fought.
   The Israeli visitors include Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon,
a Labor Party member who serves as minister of education and
culture, and Abram Sharir, a Likud member who is minister of
justice and tourism. They are the highest-ranked Israeli officials
ever to visit Poland.
   Although their visits are considered private, ``the whole event
has some influence on Polish-Israeli relations,'' said an Israeli
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In addition to Navon and Sharir, the Israeli delegation includes
six members of parliament and 2,000 Israeli citizens.
   Other notables taking part in the observance are Edgar M.
Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress; the Israeli actor
Topol; author Jerzy Kosinski; and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie
Wiesel, who has written extensively about the Holocaust.
   Poland also expects delegations from the United States, Canada,
Australia and Western Europe.
   Activities planned include an international ``March of the
Living'' on Thursday from the former Nazi concentration camp of
Auschwitz, in southern Poland, to the mass extermination center of
Birkenau nearby.
   A two-day historical and scientific conference on the struggle
of Poles and Jews under the Nazi occupation begins Thursday in
Warsaw.
   On Sunday, Polish television will broadcast an Israeli-organized
quiz program for young people on the history of the Warsaw ghetto.
   About 120 Poles are to be honored as ``Righteous Among Nations''
by the Israeli Yad Vashem Institute for the aid they gave Jews
during World War II.
   On Monday, a newly built monument at Umschlagplatz, where Polish
Jews were loaded onto trains for the trip to the Treblinka death
camp, will be dedicated.
   A group led by the last surviving commander of the uprising,
Marek Edelman, plans to hold its own observances on Sunday.
   The group includes several activists of the outlawed Solidarity
trade union federation and prominent cultural figures.
