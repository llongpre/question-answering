<LEADPARA>  WITH the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor looming at the end of the year,
Japan's greatest filmmaker has launched a bombshell at U.S. moviegoers.;   
After five decades of directing, 29 feature films, two Oscars and every other
award the world of cinema can think to bestow, 80-year-old Akira Kurosawa has
finally made a movie about the subject that has been lurking in his mind like
a bad dream for 45 years: the atomic bomb.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Post-nuclear family;  Kurosawa's new "Rhapsody in August" is a beautiful,
engaging and unforgettable story of one family's reaction to the nuclear
attack on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945. It is also a story that seems certain to
infuriate many Americans.;    That's what happened here the other day, when
the director previewed his newest creation for an audience of reporters, both
Japanese and foreign. At the ensuing press conference, Kurosawa ran into so
much hostility from the foreign press that he finally stopped taking
questions.;    The film starts out as if Kurosawa is going to portray the
United States as a murderous evil empire. "The Americans dropped the bomb on
us," one of the characters says early on, "and now they don't want to think
about it.";    But all of a sudden, a completely sympathetic American appears,
played by Hollywood heart-throb Richard Gere, who speaks Japanese for his
part. In the crucial scene between the strong Japanese heroine and a somewhat
wimpy Gere, Kurosawa quite clearly forgives America for dropping history's
only A-bombs on his country.;    Whose fault?;  For Japanese audiences, this
act of forgiveness is an interesting and perhaps touching development. But in
the West, it will provoke obvious questions: Is it really America that needs
to be forgiven for the tragedies of World War II? Why doesn't this movie ever
point out that Japan started the war? Why focus on Nagasaki and ignore what
Japan did at Nanking, Pearl Harbor, Bataan?;    "That would be a different
movie," Kurosawa explained at the press conference, reeling at the steady
media attack. "It was not my intention to make a movie about Pearl Harbor. I
wanted to tell the story of this family in Nagasaki, and to do that you have
to tell the story of the atomic bomb that was dropped there.";    "Rhapsody in
August" is more accessible than the exotic world of Kurosawa's film of last
year, "Dreams," and more entertaining than his Best Foreign Language Film
Oscar winner, "Dersu Uzala" (1975).;    "Rhapsody in August" is tentatively
scheduled to open in the United States the first week in December -- the
anniversary week of the Pearl Harbor attack. But it may not wait that long.
The film will be featured at the Cannes festival later this spring, and it's
scheduled to open in Japan in May. The resulting publicity may lead to an
earlier U.S. debut.;    Kurosawa buffs will find in "Rhapsody" all the
signature touches: the fascination with clouds and heavy rain, the beautiful
forest scenes, the Western music, the amplified background sounds, the
repeated symbolic motifs.;    Even people who aren't into the aesthetics of
artsy Japanese films will fall under the spell of Sachiko Murase, in a
riveting performance as the 80-ish grandmother, and the four fresh youngsters
who play her grandchildren. Despite the forbidding topic, much of the movie
has the same playful air as Kurosawa's samurai bounty-hunter movie "Yojimbo.";
   Caught up in history;    The time is August 1990, and four kids are
spending summer vacation at grandmother's farm outside Nagasaki. Like the
young people in most Kurosawa films, these trendy, happy-go-lucky kids know no
history. They have no interest in World War II or the atomic bombs that ended
it.;    Almost in spite of themselves, though, the four children get caught up
in their grandmother's tales of the war years. Gradually, they discover that
her husband and some of her siblings were killed in the atomic blast.;    The
kids also learn that summer that they have a rich Japanese-American cousin in
Hawaii. When it turns out that this cousin is coming to Nagasaki to visit
grandmother, everyone agrees not to mention the nuclear blast. Americans,
after all, won't want to hear about it.;    Richard Gere is cast as the
Japanese-American relative. Presumably there will be controversy aplenty about
his thoroughly apologetic American view of the war. He evidently doesn't
remember Pearl Harbor, but he sheds tears when he meets some disabled victims
of the bomb.;    And then he falls all over himself telling grandmother how
sorry he is that Americans dropped the bomb that killed her husband.;    "It's
OK," she says, in the climactic scene, with Gere and grandmother sitting on a
bench beneath an impossibly big full moon. "Don't worry about it. It's all
right now.";    And with that, America stands forgiven.;    Actually, it's the
American people, not the government, whom Kurosawa is forgiving in this film.;
   "I have dealt with this theme in my samurai movies," Kurosawa said. "I'm
trying to say that war is not a matter between the people of the two
countries. It's the politics, the leaders, who make war. When grandmother
says, 'It's OK, thank you,' it is an act of forgiveness between the people of
the countries.";    But will the movie-going people of the United States be
willing to forgive Kurosawa for his atom bomb movie? The combative
octogenarian says he frankly doesn't care.;    "All I want is for movie lovers
to come see my film," he said. "All I'm doing is expressing myself. If you
disagree with me, that's fine. Fire away!"  </TEXT>
