   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev spent
Friday in closed meetings with other Warsaw Pact leaders, and his
wife Raisa visited Auschwitz, where 4 million people were killed in
Nazi death camps.
   Gorbachev's proposals for new efforts to break a deadlock with
NATO over reducing conventional forces in Europe, already rejected
by the United States, were among the topics for discussion in the
first of two days of private talks.
   A brief official report of the proceedings said Gorbachev and
the other leaders addressed the opening-day session, but gave no
details. They met in the Council of Ministers Palace, where the
Treaty of Warsaw was signed in 1955 to formalize the political and
military alliance.
   The official news agency PAP later reported dinner toasts by
Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania and Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Ceausescu called for talks aimed at eliminating short-range
nuclear missiles in Europe _ those with ranges up to 300 miles,
which are not included in the U.S.-Soviet treaty to scrap
medium-range weapons, the agency said.
   Jaruzelski said Gorbachev's proposals for talks on reducing
conventional forces were ``valuable, original initiatives'' and
were discussed in the first day's session.
   Mrs. Gorbachev returned to southern Poland, which the Gorbachevs
visited earlier in the week, to memorialize those who died during
World War II in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp.
   She laid bouquets of red carnations at Execution Wall and at the
Russian-language tablet that is part of an international monument
to the dead.
   Wiping a tear from her cheek, Mrs. Gorbachev said after touring
the camp that almost 50 years since the beginning of World War II
the camp still reminds the living of ``the hope, human fear and
bravery'' of its inmates.
   ``It should remind us all that what is most precious in this
world is the right to live and be free,'' she said in brief remarks
broadcast by state television.
   Soviet forces liberated Auschwitz, built by the Germans after
they occupied Poland at the beginning of the war, in January 1945
and it has been preserved as a museum. The gas chambers and
crematoria of Birkenau were largely destroyed by retreating German
forces, and the site is marked by a stone monument and tablets in
many languages.
   The combined camp was the center of Hitler's effort to wipe out
European Jews, millions of whom lived in Poland and Nazi-occupied
regions of the Soviet Union.
   Next to Poles, both Jew and Christian, more than 1 million
Soviet citizens made up the largest single nationality among the
victims. Soviet prisoners of war received particularly harsh
treatment in the slave-labor sections of the complex.
   News coverage of Mrs. Gorbachev's visit, the first event of the
six-day visit to Poland when she did not accompany her husband, was
restricted to Soviet and Polish media.
   The meeting of the Warsaw Pact's political-consultative council
is the first since the fourth Gorbachev-Reagan summit six weeks ago
in Moscow.
   It also was the Soviet leader's first opportunity to brief his
allies on the Soviet Union's national Communist Party conference at
the end of June, which reiterated his policy of encouraging
economic and social reform.
   When he arrived Monday, Gorbachev proposed that negotiators from
East and West meet informally to seek ways of breaking the impasse
that for years has blocked mutual reductions of conventional forces
in Europe.
   Washington issued a statement saying appropriate forums already
exist in Vienna and elsewhere for discussing arms reduction and
that any such talks should include representatives of all NATO
countries.
   The U.S. response was equally cool to Gorbachev's suggestion
that the Soviet Union would withdraw an unspecified number of its
military aircraft from Eastern Europe if NATO drops a plan to
redeploy 72 American F-16s from Spain to Italy.
