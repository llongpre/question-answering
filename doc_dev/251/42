   North Korea's official news media reported some
200,000 people attended an anti-American rally in Pyongyang Sunday
and speakers called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South
Korea.
   In another report the state-run media said more than 100,000
North Koreans lined Pyongyang streets to welcome PLO chief Yasser
who previously visited Pakistan and China.
   Choe Mun Son, chief of the the Pyongyang committee of the ruling
Workers (communist) Party, addressed the rally.
   The official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Toyko,
reported Choe said: ``Now that the Soviet Union has taken the
initiative in disarmament, the East-West situation is showing signs
of detente and foreign troops are withdrawing from other regions of
the world, the United States must withdraw its troops and nuclear
weapons from South Korea.''
   The agency said the rally marked ``June 25, the day of struggle
against U.S. imperialism.''
   On June 25, 1950, North Korean troops invaded South Korea,
starting a war that ended with an armistice on July 27, 1953.
   The United States has some 43,000 military personnel stationed in
South Korea under a mutual defense pact. North Korea claims they are
blocking a peaceful reunification of the country, divided since the
end of World War II in 1945.
   Choe told the rally the United States had started the Korean War
_ ``a most cruel and brutal, homicidal war.''
   ``Today, South Korea has turned into the biggest nuclear arsenal
in the Far East, a most dangerous hotbed of nuclear war in the world
due to U.S. imperialist moves toward nuclear war,'' Choe said,
according to the Korean Central News Agency - KCNA.
   The agency reported anti-American demonstrations were held
Saturday throughout North Korea.
   KCNA said Arafat was greeted at the airport by Vice President Li
Jong Ok and other officials. It said the airport was decorated with
portraits of Arafat and President Kim Il Sung.
   Earlier Sunday, Arafat's plane made a brief stop at the Beijing
airport and the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman was met
by Yang Fuchang, assistant to the foreign minister.
   China's official Xinhua news agency reported Yang conveyed the
greetings of China's communist leaders.
   The report referred to Arafat as president of the state of
Palestine. China has recognized a Palestinian government in exile.
   Arafat flew to Beijing from Pakistan, where he met with
government leaders Saturday in Islamabad and offered to mediate a
political solution to the civil war in neighboring Afghanistan.
