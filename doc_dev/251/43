   When Hiroshima remembers the atom bomb
it is with a flock of doves and a mournful tolling of bells. On the
central monument to the bomb victims is a prayer ``that this evil
shall never be repeated.''
   Forty-five years after the United States dropped the first
atomic bomb, Hiroshima continues to lay the grim realities of
nuclear war before the world.
   In Japan, most remembrances of the Aug. 6, 1945 bombing focus on
the horrors of the atom bomb and the 140,000 deaths it caused, and
rarely on the responsibility of the warring nations.
   When Hiroshima began refurbishing its Peace Memorial Museum last
year, 16 groups of citizens, bomb victims and labor unions demanded
the city include an ``aggressor's corner'' that would focus on
Japan's aggressive role in World War II.
   City officials refused. In a written statement, the city quoted
former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who said in 1988 that it
was unclear that Japan was an aggressor in World War II.
   ``The purpose of this museum is to bear witness to what happened
on August 6th in Hiroshima,'' said Yoshitaka Kawamoto, president of
the museum.
   The museum's exhibits say the atomic attack was aimed at
civilians.
   ``If we had a display about Japan's aggressive role, people will
think it is natural for aggressors to be atom-bombed,'' said Toru
Kataoka, manager of the Peace Culture Center, which is housed in
one of three major buildings at the Peace Park. ``It opposes our
basic policy on the museum, which is to pray for the victims.''
   More than 20,000 of those victims were Koreans, brought here as
slave laborers during Japan's 35-year colonization of the
neighboring Korean peninsula.
   They have seldom been recognized.
   When South Koreans built a monument in 1970 to honor their
countrymen who died in the blast, city officials said there was no
room in the Peace Memorial Park, citing the 20 monuments there
already.
   The Koreans kept up their pressure and in May, the city relented.
   In Hiroshima, the city's efforts to preserve the horrific
experience continue. Last year, the city collected more than $2.5
million in public donations to preserve the atom-bomb dome, the
hulking skeletal remnants of a building left standing near the
center of the blast.
   Preserving the dome is important ``because its ravaged state
sounds a warning about the potential for humanity to destroy itself
with nuclear weapons,'' Mayor Takeshi Araki said last year.
   Most Japanese observe the anniversary of the atomic bombings
mournfully, adding names to lists of those who have died in the
past year due to the continuing effects of radiation or other
injuries.
   This year, the victims will also be honored in the United States.
   At a desert ceremony west of Salt Lake City later this month,
members of the squadron that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima will
dedicate a 16-foot obelisk honoring their bomber group and ``all
who contributed to bring this dreadful war to an end.''
   The group will also honor those who died in the blast at
Hiroshima and at Nagasaki, where a second atom bomb was dropped
three days after the bombing of Hiroshima.
   Japan surrendered six days after the atomic bombing of Nagasaki,
ending World War II.
