   The designer of a monument to 300,000 Jews
who were sent to their deaths during World War II says an adjoining
gas station should be closed because it is insulting to the victims.
   The filling station abuts the sparkling new marble-and-stone
memorial at Umschlagplatz, the railroad siding which bordered the
walled Jewish ghetto during the war.
   The monument is being dedicated Monday as part of elaborately
planned observances marking the 45th anniversary of the doomed
Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, in which some of the last 70,000
inhabitants took up arms against the final Nazi eradication drive
on April 19, 1943.
   Workmen were busily trying to complete the 20-yard-by-6-yard
memorial this week, but whether the gas station next door will
reopen in a few weeks remained unclear and a source of controversy.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski said Thursday
that official plans always have been to close down the the station
once the monument was built.
   But Roman Slawinski, director of the Warsaw branch of the state
gasoline monopoly CPN, said the station will reopen after the
anniversary ceremonies.
   He did not elaborate, but an official source demanding anonymity
said the station ``will start operations again until another
location is decided upon, and another station is built at the
expense of those building the monument.''
   According to the designer of the monument, Hanna Szmalenberg,
that is ``blackmail.''
   ``It shouldn't be there,'' she said. ``No other important
monument has a gas station nearby. It is insulting to the memory.''
   She said the station should never have been constructed at the
site and charged that putting it there in the first place was a
``political decision'' which stemmed from an anti-Semitic purge
which took place in Poland in 1968.
   Even though an Israeli donor has offered to pay for construction
of a replacement gas station, she said, CPN has been holding out
for more money.
   Ms. Szmalenberg, interviewed in the gas station lot Wednesday,
said she designed the $252,000 monument as an enclosed rectangle in
part because of the station's proximity.
   There often are long lines of cars at Polish gas stations, and
idling vehicles just a few feet from the monument could be expected
to disturb visitors, she said.
   In her design, she said, visitors will be able to step inside to
partially avoid the fumes and the traffic noise.
   Visitors will enter under a sculpted arch. Inscribed on the
walls inside are about 400 names, representing some of the victims
who passed through Umschlagplatz. Previously, a small tablet marked
the site.
   About 450,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding countryside
were crowded into the Warsaw Ghetto after the 1939 Nazi occupation.
The Nazis enclosed the quarter with a barbed-wired-lined brick wall.
   The railroad siding at the tightly guarded square of
Umschlagplatz _ German for ``deportation point'' _ was the only
exit for 300,000 Jews, who there were loaded onto boxcars bound for
the Treblinka and Majdanek death camps.
   Ms. Szmalenberg said she was skeptical of official promises that
the station later would be shut down for good.
   The pumps have been taken down but the office has not been
touched, standing only about a dozen yards from the monument.
   ``Even the Warsaw authorities are not strong enough to get the
gasoline people to change their mind,'' she said.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, asked about it on Tuesday,
said, ``I really don't understand _ and you must pardon me for this
_ what the problem is, because it concerns some technical details.''
   If the filling station poses an obstacle to the monument itself,
``then it goes without saying that it will be closed down for
good,'' he said. But if the station is just an impediment to the
ceremonies, ``it is a different matter.''
