Few episodes of the second world war revealed so clearly the depths of human
wickedness and the heights of personal and collective heroism as the Warsaw
rising, whose 50th anniversary will be commemorated this weekend in the
Polish capital.
The rising, 63 days of increasingly desperate street fighting between
150,000 ill-armed volunteers of the Polish Home Army (the AK or Armia
Krajowa) and a pitiless Nazi annihilation force, took place while Stalin,
whose soldiers were encamped just across the River Vistula, looked on with
folded arms, and the western allies were preoccupied with the battle for
France.
'The decision to launch the rising represents for the Poles the most tragic
mistake in their recent history,' wrote historian Norman Davies, author of
God's Playground, the most authoritative contemporary history of Poland. Its
failure scarred a generation of Poles and set the scene for 45 years of
east-west mistrust and the cold war.
Given this background, the decision of Polish President Lech Walesa to
invite the presidents of re-united Germany and post-communist Russia, as
well as representatives of the war-time allied powers, to this weekend's
ceremonies has been controversial. Intended as a gesture of forgiveness for
crimes which Poles will never permit to be forgotten, the Russo-German
presence has been fiercely criticised by Mr Walesa's domestic political
opponents and nationalist critics.
Mr Roman Herzog, the recently elected German president, accepted under the
unfortunate misapprehension that the object of commemoration was an earlier
slaughter of the innocents, the desperate Warsaw Ghetto uprising of April
1943 when the last remnants of the Jewish ghetto fought a doomed battle to
prevent their transport to the death camps, while Russian President Boris
Yeltsin passed the invitation on to lesser officials. Prime minister John
Major is representing Britain but US President Bill Clinton, who toured
central Europe before the Naples summit, is sending Vice President Al Gore.
The international line-up may be lighter and more controversial than hoped.
But nothing can take away from the significance of the event being
commemorated.
Five decades ago Soviet forces under General Rokossowski had advanced to the
suburbs of Warsaw. German troops under General Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski
were evacuating stores and preparing to vacate the city. In his makeshift
underground headquarters General Tadeusz Bor-Komorowski, commander of the
Polish Home Army and the chief delegate from the Polish government in exile
in London were debating how and when to strike what they hoped would be a
decisive blow for liberation.
On the evening of July 29, Moscow Radio broadcast to Warsaw that 'the hour
of action has arrived.' This apparent invitation to take up arms against the
retreating Nazi's was accompanied by the first sighting of Soviet T-34 tanks
in Praga, a suburb just across the river Vistula from the historic town
centre.
The rising began at five o'clock on the afternoon of August 1 and ended two
months later with the surrender of the last pockets of Polish resistance. It
was followed by the forced evacuation of the surviving population and the
systematic destruction of 85 per cent of the city on Hitler's express
orders.
The outcome of the unequal battle was never in doubt after the hoped for
Soviet intervention failed to materialise and the first four days of
fighting failed to secure the airport, the railway station or the bridges
over the Vistula. Hitler, shocked and angered by the failed bomb plot
against him a few days earlier, ordered his commanders back to the city to
suppress the rising ruthlessly.
Fighting street to street, and cellar to cellar even continued in the sewers
which formed the main lines of communication for the beleaguered AK while
German ground troops backed by heavy artillery, dive bombers and tanks
remorsely tightened the net. To this day the track of a German 'goliath'
mini-tank lies embedded in the rebuilt walls of St John's cathedral in the
heart of the old city where mass will be said on Sunday in memory of those,
soldiers and civilians, who took part.
The last hope flickered and died on September 18 when a daylight air-drop of
food and arms by allied bombers left 90 per cent of the aid in German hands.
The bombers were forced to fly to the limits of their range from bases in
Italy because Stalin refused to allow them to use airfields in
Soviet-occupied territory.
It was a telling omen of things to come, which the allies turned a
half-blind eye to, preoccupied as they were with breaking out from the
Normandy beachheads and unwilling to 'antagonise Uncle Joe', the man whose
Red Army had torn the guts out of Hitlers armies in the east,
But the Poles had embarked upon the rising harbouring no illusions. Their
aim was to liberate the Polish capital from the Nazis and 'to mobilise the
entire population spiritually for the struggle against Russia.'
For the Poles already knew what being 'liberated' by Soviet forces meant.
Five years earlier, in September 1939, Poland had been violated by Hitler
and Stalin together under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.
Poles, and the large pre-war Jewish population in particular, suffered
terribly under Nazi rule. But for non-Jews, political and physical
repression by the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, in the Soviet-occupied
east of Poland was in many ways worse than that imposed by the Gestapo.
To the Nazis the Poles were simply Untermenschen whose ideas and culture
were of no interest. For Stalin's commissars, by contrast, Poland's
nationalist traditions and 'bourgeois' culture were a threat to be
eliminated. Hence the cold-blooded murder of thousands of captured Polish
officers in Katyn forest, near Smolensk. Hence the mass arrest of Polish
intellectuals, priests and teachers and their execution or deportation to
Siberia.
The AK's decision to fight for a 'Polish solution' to Poland's future was
'taken for the most honourable motives by men who had fought selflessly for
their country's independence against all comers,' writes Professor Davies.
But 'the idea that Warsaw could have been held by the AK in the name of the
government in exile without a subsequent showdown with the Soviets was
belied by all previous experience,' he adds.
So it proved. But the tradition of stubborn resistance to foreign occupation
embodied by Warsaw's defenders lived on to re-emerge a generation later in
the anti-Soviet Solidarity movement. The defeat of 50 years ago turned into
the victory of 1989 when Poland became the first of Moscow's satellite
states to throw off the Soviet shackles. In so doing Poles started the
process which liberated not only central Europe but permitted the
re-unification of Germany and the re-emergence of a Russia shorn of its
Soviet imperial arrogance. That is the final testament to an immense
sacrifice.
