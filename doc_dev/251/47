   A monument depicting Austria's shame and
suffering in World War II was unveiled Thursday and served as a
somber reminder of Hitler's persecution of the Jews.
   More than 1,000 people gathered in and around Albertina Square
behind the Opera House for the inauguration of the monument by
sculptor Alfred Hrdlicka.
   The most controversial figure in one of several scenes depicted
is that of a Jew scrubbing the pavement.
   It recalls how the Nazis made Vienna Jews scrub streets clean of
anti-Nazi slogans with toothbrushes after Hitler annexed his native
Austria to Germany in 1938. Crowds of cheering Austrians often
looked on.
   Chief Rabbi Paul Chaim Eisenberg said the bronze figure would
remind Austrians of their past, which often is an uncomfortable
topic to the many who see themselves only as Hitler's victims.
   ``If you stand still, shaken, before this monument, then that can
be atonement for those who walked unmoved past the living Jews
washing the streets then,'' Eisenberg said.
   Thursday's ceremony was the last of many events this year
recalling the annexation and the attacks on Jews by Nazi thugs in
November 1938 that began the Holocaust.
   The anniversary has produced mixed emotions, reflecting Austria's
dual role as victim and accomplice of the Nazis.
   Controversy about President Kurt Waldheim's World War II service
as a German army officer has been an important element in the
observance and he played little part in the memorial events.
   Waldheim has been accused of committing war crimes while he was
an intelligence officer in the Balkans and denies the allegations.
   An international panel of historians determined that Waldheim was
in areas where atrocities were committed, knew of them and did
nothing to stop them. The historians said they found no direct
evidence that he committed crimes, but left the question of guilt
open.
   Erika Weinzierl, head of Austria's Action against Anti-Semitism
campaign, said Thursday the monument ``challenges us to remember the
darkest epoch of our history.''
   As she spoke, a few dozen people in the crowd chanted inaudible
slogans and knelt on the pavement, scrubbing it like the Jews of 50
years ago.
   They tossed leaflets into the crowd saying ``the Fuehrer has
gone,'' but anti-Semitism and persecution of other minorities
remains. Some of the dozens of policemen guarding Thursday's
ceremony were seen detaining at least two people.
   The monument, which will not be complete until next year, has a
``Gate of Violence'' opening on the figure of the crouching Jew.
Farther on, Orpheus arises from the underworld as a symbol of Art
overcoming the forces of darkness.
   Hundreds of Austrians lost their lives in a 1945 bombing raid on
a house that stood on the site of Albertina Square and their remains
are buried under the park-like, triangular area.
   It also has a pillar bearing pats of the declaration of
independence made by non-Nazi politicians April 27, 1945, just
before the war ended.
   Hrdlicka's monument cost about $900,000 and has been a subject of
argument since it was commissioned in 1983. Many conservative
politicians boycotted the ceremony, which was attended by Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky, Mayor Helmut Zilk and leaders of the small Jewish
community.
