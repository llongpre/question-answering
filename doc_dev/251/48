</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Belgian radio listeners awoke to the chilling sound of Adolf Hitler declaring 
war on Poland, and Germans mourned their grim legacy to the world as Europeans 
today marked the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Jews, Poles, Russians, Germans and others gathered for memorials across the 
continent to remember the great conflict that began with the Nazi invasion of 
Poland. The events conjured somber memories of bomb shelters and concentration 
camps, of scrambled boundaries and splintered families. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in a speech to Parliament, expressed sorrow 
and regret for the "unspeakable suffering" wrought by the Nazis. He also tried 
to assuage lingering German guilt. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true that too many people in Germany and some abroad were blinded and 
deceived by that tyrant," Kohl said of Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
"Who among us can say with a good conscience that, confronted with such evil, 
they would have summoned the strength to be martyrs? And who among us can judge 
what it meant at that time to risk not only one's own life but the lives of 
one's family as well?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
In Communist East Berlin, ailing leader Erich Honecker missed the memorial 
ceremony in the 500-member People's Chamber, where Foreign Minister Oskar 
Fischer delivered the main address. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer called for a day of "recollection and sorrow" and said the East German 
leaders pledge "to do everything in our power to ensure that war and fascism 
never again threaten our lives and the lives of our children." 
</P>
<P>
Poland's leaders marked the occasion with a symbolic show of unity by the 
Communists and the Solidarity labor movement they once crushed. 
</P>
<P>
Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and 
former Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, now the prime minister, appeared 
together at a small Polish garrison in Gdansk that bore the first Nazi 
onslaught on Sept. 1, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
"On this day of great national memories we look not only into the past but also 
into the future," said Jaruzelski, flanked by two men he once jailed. 
</P>
<P>
"Let this be an oath in this sacred place," Jaruzelski said, his voice 
trembling. "Poland stood the toughest trial of war with honor. On this 
exceptional day we have the moral right to address all nations and governments 
of Europe. We want to have friends close to us, and far away" -- an obvious 
reference to the Warsaw Pact nation's efforts to reach out to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, eager to keep Poland in the Soviet sphere 
as that nation flirts with reform, said in a message to Jaruzelski: "The Polish 
people and their army were the first to bear the brunt of Germany's powerful 
military machine. 
</P>
<P>
"These tragic events were actually prompted by the inability of the states 
threatened by fascism and militarism to rally together and set up a collective 
security system." 
</P>
<P>
In Belgium, BRT state radio woke up listeners with a spine-tingling flash from 
the past: a tape of Hitler declaring war on Poland on the same day he had 
launched the first attacks. The frenzied fuehrer's incitements were followed by 
the cheers of adoring Germans. 
</P>
<P>
In London, about 200 people gathered at the St. Pancras railway station to 
remember their evacuation to the countryside to escape Hitler's "blitzkrieg" 
bombings.
