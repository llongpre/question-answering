   If I read Paul Johnson's "Irredentist Perils in Faltering Soviet Empire" (editorial page, Aug. 23) correctly, he and I share a cautious preference for the pre-World War I arrangement of Eastern Europe. 
And he is clearly right to suggest that the Treaty of Versailles had left many questions unanswered, to say the least. 
But I note with sadness that he accepted a 1938 Berlin propaganda line. 
He singles out Czechoslovakia as one of the countries that "ill-treated their minorities, often more savagely than the old empires." 
This resulted, Mr. Johnson argues, in German irredentism, which then led "directly to the Anschluss, Munich and the crisis over the 'Polish Corridor,' the immediate cause of World War II." 

   I do not propose to argue the issue of Czechoslovakia's treatment of the Sudeten Germans. 
But to explain the Anschluss, the tragic debacle of Western democracies and decency in international relations at Munich, and the outbreak of the war itself without a single reference to Hitler's explicit desire to start the war is at variance with available documents as well as common sense. 

   Further, it is true that nationalism in Eastern Europe outlived Moscow's effort to replace it with communist internationalism, i.e., with whatever serves the interests of the Soviet leadership. 
But Mr. Johnson is utterly wrong to argue that in 1968 "Leonid Brezhnev had no difficulty in getting the Poles, Hungarians and East Germans to cooperate gladly in the invasion of Czechoslovakia." 
The three armies sent only token units that remained as invisible as they could, given that they had arrived in tanks. 
If Mr. Johnson had looked into the eyes of the Polish, Hungarian and East German soldiers he would have found no "gladness" whatsoever. 
On the other hand, the one Warsaw Pact army that did show some zeal for the mission designed for it by the Soviet marshals, the Bulgarian army, is strangely missing on Mr. Johnson's list. 

   Finally, Mr. Johnson fears "the nationalist mob is once more making its appearance in the streets of Eastern Europe." 
But that is nonsense. 
Nowadays, nationalism in Warsaw, Prague, Berlin or Budapest is first and foremost a rejection of the rule by Soviet Party bureaucrats and the humiliating presence of Soviet troops. 
Czechs, Poles, and Hungarians have demonstrated on many recent occasions an understanding of one another's lot. 
This is true among the intellectuals and it is rapidly growing in other social stratas. 
In the near future, Eastern Europeans are unlikely to produce nationalistic mobs. 
Instead, they share my own feeling that the real mob in Eastern Europe is the one wearing the Red Army uniform.
