   Europe today paid solemn tribute
to the millions of victims of World War II, which started 50 years
ago on Sept. 1 when a German warship opened fire on a tiny Polish
garrison.
   Adolf Hitler's troops quickly overran Poland, and the war spread
around the globe. In the end, 50 million people had died.
   By then the Nazis had shocked the world with the extermination of
6 million Jews, and the United States had forever changed warfare by
dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
   Many of Belgium's 6 million Dutch speakers woke up to a broadcast
of Hitler declaring war on Poland. BRT state radio opened its
foreign news report with a tape of the original declaration and
Germans cheering for their fuhrer.
   In London, a reunion was planned of some of the people who were
evacuated during Hitler's savage Blitzkrieg bombings of the city.
   Italy's leading daily, the Milan-based Corriere della Sera, told
its readers that ``Europe paid the price of its lacerations with the
loss of its political supremacy.''
   West Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a special Parliament
session in Bonn: ``We feel sorrow for the unspeakable suffering
which was caused to human beings and nations in the name of the
Germans and by the hand of the Germans.''
   ``We mourn for the many innocent victims from within our own
people,'' Kohl added.
   As he spoke, a group of young Poles sat in the visitors' gallery.
The group had been invited as a sign of reconciliation between West
Germany and Poland, which suffered more than any other country from
the Nazi atrocities.
   There still are nagging questions over West Germany's
relationship with Poland. Kohl has been under pressure from the
opposition Social Democratic Party to visit Poland, as he has
promised to do, and provide more financial aid to Warsaw.
   ``By delaying his visit, the chancellor is wasting good chances
to give a clear expression to the reconciliation process between
Poles and Germans,'' party leader Hans-Jochen Vogel said Thursday.
   The Communist Party daily in Czechoslovakia, Rude Pravo, called
the fighting that spread to all corners of the globe ``mankind's
most terrible war.''
   In Communist East Berlin, Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer called
today a day of ``recollection and sorrow'' during a speech to the
500-member People's Chamber.
   Fischer also repeated the commitment ``to do everything in our
power to insure that war and fascism never again threaten our lives
and the lives of our children.''
   Corriere della Sera called Hitler's Blitkrieg ``the technology of
a new Genghis Khan,'' the dreaded Mongol conqueror of central Asia.
   It noted that Hitler had the support of the ``German masses,''
also pointing out that European political clout plunged after World
War II.
   Some of the most closely watched events were scheduled in Poland.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski was to speak at Westerplatte on the
Baltic coast, where the first shots were fired.
   ``We will pay homage to all victims of the war, we will pay
homage to its heroes and we will express the will to live in
peace,'' said Wlodzimierz Lozinski, a spokesman for Jaruzelski.
   American conductor Leonard Bernstein was to lead an
internationally televised memorial concert in Warsaw, and Pope John
Paul II was to address fellow Poles in Warsaw by a TV hookup.
   But an event to bring together members of the world's dominant
religions to pray for peace appeared likely to be marred by a
boycott by Poland's only rabbi.
   Rabbi Menachem Joskowicz said he would stay away because the
Roman Catholic Church has not removed a convent from the Auschwitz
concentration camp that many consider offensive to the memory of the
2.5 million Jews killed there.
   Fifty years after the outbreak of World War II, there are still
many unresolved issues traceable to Adolf Hitler's dictatorship.
   They include the role of secret protocols in the 1939
non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
   The agreement allowed the Soviets to take over the Baltic
republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and Western accounts say
the pact paved the way for the start of World War II.
   Recent Soviet reforms have emboldened residents of the Baltics,
now the site of a growing independence movement.
   The Kremlin on Thursday called World War II ``the most horrible
and destructive of all wars.'' The commentary from the official
Soviet news agency Tass then quickly lept to how the ``lessons of
the past'' should lead the West to agreeing with Moscow on arms
control issues.
   In Bonn, ultra-conservative Finance Minister Theo Waigel said he
did not deny ``one iota of German guilt'' for the war. But he added
that ``a one-sided view of history with the conclusion that only the
Germans are burdened with guilt would be unbearable and would lead
to dangerous condemnations.''
   Ultra-conservatives have long asserted that Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin also shares some of the blame for the outbreak of the war.
