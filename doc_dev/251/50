<HEAD>Sanctions at Heart of Gulf War Question for Many</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   More than two dozen countries dispatched troops to the Middle
East after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The troops' first aim was
to block a possible assault on Saudi Arabia. But now many wonder
whether the U.S.-led coalition should strike first - and if so,
when and under what circumstances.
   The Associated Press put that question to eight people,
including a Vietnam veteran, the wife of a hostage and two former
Defense Department officials. Here are their answers:

   They certainly shouldn't wait any longer. And I think that the
object of the attack should be to remove Saddam Hussein from
control and neutralize his ability to use weapons of mass
destruction. ...
   With each passing day, the likely costs and degree of difficulty
of an attack increase. That's because Saddam Hussein is trying to
make his forces more resilient, feverishly trying to bring to bear
more capable weapons systems. If this crisis should result in a
perpetuation of his power, we'll see those costs increase
exponentially because then he will have weapons far more dangerous
than those currently available to him.
   Meanwhile, it's unclear how long it will take before the
sanctions even get his attention. Saddam Hussein is nothing if not
indifferent to the condition of his people.
   In short, I think it's reasonably clear that neither the Iraqi
people nor the military are going to be sufficiently affected by
the sanctions between now and the closing of what's called the
``window of opportunity'' for an attack, namely the end of March or
so. ...
   Time is not on our side. Saddam Hussein is playing a waiting
game and thinks he can succeed at it.

   I think the best way to proceed is to try to negotiate a
settlement. The first issue that brought us there was the invasion
of Kuwait, and that's the primary issue. The primary issue is, as
far as I'm concerned, negotiable in terms of the withdrawal of
Iraqi forces.
   The escalation has come since we started talking about an
offensive straight through into Iraq. I'm not sure I understand the
reason for that except Saddam Hussein is a, quote, ``madman'' and
in four years they'll have the power to construct a nuclear bomb. I
don't necessarily get the connection between those two facts and an
incredible amount of blood shed by poor boys from Boston,
Dorchester and Roxbury.
   As someone who works with veterans, I see that right now the VA
is unable to handle the problems of an aging veteran population or
the problems of the Vietnam generation of veterans, issues of Agent
Orange and post-traumatic stress disorder. And many of the states
who are sending these National Guard units are closing their
programs for veterans.
   In Massachusetts, you have the case where they're discussing
closing the soldiers' homes and the outreach centers for
Vietnam-generation veterans. Here we're sending these guys off to
war and at the same time we're cutting back all the support systems
for people who have gone through our previous wars. That kind of
inconsistency is something that carries throughout the whole policy
and what we're doing in the Persian Gulf.

   I want to know what gives our president the power to decide that
on a certain date we're going to start a war. What gives him the
power in the month of November to say that in January we're going
to start a war?
   I think it's a horrifying thing to be doing. What frightens me
is that the decision is in the hands of people who are not actively
involved. In all of Congress, there are only two people who have a
family member in Saudi Arabia.
   (U.S. troops) went to Saudi Arabia to prevent an attack ... but
(now) President Bush is leading the pack into war.
   Everything is being drummed up to keep the flames of war
brightly lit. First we heard about the oil ... then we heard about
Saddam being an evil aggressor ... and now we're hearing about his
possible atomic capabilities.
   We should be over there in a defensive mode and, at this time,
nothing more. It should not be an American military offensive as a
presidential option but as an act of Congress, and the people
Congress is supposed to represent.

   We ought to give the sanctions time to work and we should only
attack if we are provoked by Iraq. We ought to let Saddam Hussein
know we are there until hell freezes over. In six months, his
aircraft will run out of spare parts and there will be other parts
shortages as well. So what if it takes us a year or two or three?
It took us 40 years to win the Cold War. ... I don't even think we
should be beefing up our force there. I'd probably get the
deployment down to 150,000 - 200,000 maximum in the area and
announce a rotation policy for the troops. ...
   If there were a provocation and you did have a war, I would bomb
his military facilities, the chemicals, the nuclear and his
munitions factories. I'd cut off his supply lines and I might pick
out one of his divisions in Kuwait and bomb the hell out of it too
and then say, ``OK, now get out or we'll bomb another division, and
then another.''

   ``They should not attack. History has taught us that when other
countries tolerate invasion such as Japan's invasion of China and
Germany's invasion of Poland, it can lead to world war. But now
with the development of missiles and nuclear weapons, the meaning
of war has changed. It may result in the total destruction of
mankind. ... Secondly, United Nations efforts and international
economic sanctions have made great progress. ... World opinion can
end Iraq's occupation.
