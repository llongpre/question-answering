   With the clang of a single bell and the
rush of 1,000 doves overhead, Hiroshima came to a standstill Sunday
for a moment of silence to recall the world's first nuclear attack
44 years ago.
   About 50,000 people gathered in the city's Peace Memorial Park
to mark the anniversary of the city's destruction by a U.S. atomic
bomb. Prime Minister Sousuke Uno said the memorial should ``sound
an alarm'' for the future, and he said Japan should carry out more
aggressive diplomacy to work for peace.
   At 8:15 a.m., the precise time when the bomb exploded in a flash
of white light on Aug. 6, 1945, Hiroshima residents, Japanese
government officials and foreign guests bowed their heads in silent
prayer while this city of 1 million came to a halt. A single bell
rang, and 1,000 doves were released.
   People on stopped buses and streetcars, and patients in their
hospital beds, prayed.
   At the same time, 1,000 people staged what they called a
``die-in'' in front of the Peace Park's A-Bomb Dome, a preserved
ruin from the atomic attack. The group of Japanese and foreign
anti-nuclear activists protested nuclear arms and appealed for
peace, a representative said.
   About 140,000 people died in the blast, firestorm and radiation
from the attack on this western Japanese city, a major military
center during World War II.
   ``Our country, as the sole nation to have suffered an atomic
attack, is determined that the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
should never be repeated,'' Uno told the crowd in the park. Many
were dressed in black mourning clothes, despite sweltering heat.
   Three days after the Hiroshima attack, the United States dropped
a second atom bomb on the coastal city of Nagasaki, killing 70,000
people. Japan surrendered unconditionally Aug. 15, 1945, ending the
war.
   ``We strongly feel the duty to use Hiroshima to sound an alarm
bell for the future of all humanity,'' Uno said. ``From now on,
Japan must carry out more aggressive diplomacy for peace and
security in the world,'' said Uno.
   He is about to step down as prime minister after a severe
election setback for his party.
   A group of mayors at an international peace conference,
including Anne Rudin of Sacramento, Calif., and Herbert Schmalstieg
of Hanover, West Germany, placed a wreath of yellow chrysanthemums
beside a granite tomb dedicated to the bomb victims. Chrysanthemums
are a traditional mourning flower.
   ``The people of Hiroshima have turned this into a positive thing
because they have educated the world about the horror of nuclear
war,'' Ms. Rudin said after the ceremony.
   Outside, hundreds of Boy Scouts handed visitors fresh flowers
while protesters passed out leaflets accusing the government of
laxity in enforcing a policy against allowing U.S. and other
warships to bring nuclear weapons into Japan.
   Korean residents of Japan distributed pamphlets demanding that
the government apologize for Japan's aggression against other
Asians in World War II and other conflicts.
   In his annual peace declaration, Hiroshima Mayor Takeshi Araki
said ``the Cold War framework of East-West relations'' was being
replaced by ``a new order of international peace.''
   Araki, a survivor of the atomic attack and an anti-nuclear
activist, called on Japan to reduce its military spending and
pointed to progress in superpower arms control.
   In the Philippine capital of Manila, a left-wing group marked
the anniversary by calling for the end to nuclear weapons and
establishment of international nuclear-free zones.
   The group, the Society of Ex-Detainees for Liberation Against
Detention and for Amnesty, is made up of former political prisoners
under the government of Ferdinand Marcos.
