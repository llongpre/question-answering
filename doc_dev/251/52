   The Soviet Union's fear of a reunified Germany
is grounded in a bitter national memory of millions lost in war and
a sober recognition that a historical enemy's rise might parallel
its own decline.
   The roster of Russian dead in World War II _ 7.5 million by
unofficial estimates _ dwarfs the losses of other nations and is
roughly 18 times higher that of America, which was spared combat on
its home soil. Millions of Soviet civilians also perished as German
forces penetrated deeply into Russian territory.
   Yevgeny Primakov, a top adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, said Saturday that the lingering fear of Germany _ not
the Soviet economy _ was paramount in the minds of Soviets.
   ``Whenever our children play war,'' he said, ``the two opposing
sides to this day are the Soviets and the Nazis _ the Germans.''
   Despite all the years of tension between the United States and
the Soviet Union, Soviet children playing such games have never
posed as Americans, he said.
   ``You can judge from that how deep are the fears of Germany's
military might. ... Our people have survived two wars started by the
Germans in this century.''
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, with Gorbachev at his
side, told reporters in Ottawa last week: ``All of the nations
suffered greatly in the Second World War, but none _ none suffered
more dramatically than the Soviet Union.''
   Said former NATO Ambassador Robert F. Ellsworth: ``Today, the
Germany question is completely different from what it has been
before, because it is the Russians that are weak and uncertain.''
   So the German issue, unsurprisingly, hovered over Gorbachev's
talks with Mulroney, and loomed menacingly as a possible albatross
around the necks of Gorbachev and President Bush, his summit host.
Indeed, the summit's risk of failure may have been averted by their
acknowledgements at the outset that the German question couldn't be
resolved in four days of talks here.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, briefing reporters on the
pair's talks Saturday at Camp David, Md., said that both Bush and
Gorbachev felt their Germany discussions ``were quite productive''
in the sense that the superpower leaders ``did reach a better
understanding of their positions.''
   Germany was divided into Eastern and Western zones after World
War II, but the Western powers remained committed to its eventual
reunification despite the puppet East German government set up by
the Soviet Union.
   Germany's omnipresence as an issue at East-West summits is richly
documented.
   When President Harry Truman and Soviet Premier Josef Stalin met
with British leaders in Potsdam in 1945, it was, in part, to carve
up the Germany that the Allies had just conquered.
   By 1959, when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev met with President
Dwight D. Eisenhower, trouble was brewing over the Potsdam
agreement. Khrushchev was proposing to terminate allied rights in
West Berlin, posing the threat of a major East-West confrontation.
   But in subsequent superpower talks, the German issue receded into
the background as arms control questions came to fore. That is,
until last year's toppling of the communist government of East
Germany in the wave of democratic reform that swept through central
and eastern Europe.
   West German armed forces number about 494,000. East German forces
totaled about 173,000 last year, although they may have been cut
some since, and it is unclear how many of them might be absorbed
into the unified German military force.
   Against this background, and with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
disintegrating, Bush made it clear last week that he favors a united
Germany as a full member of the U.S.-led NATO alliance. The Soviets
balked, and Gorbachev exhorted the West to find ``a new melody.''
   Georgi Arbatov, director of the Soviet Institute for U.S. and
Canada Studies, said that ``a military alliance against the Soviet
Union, that's the way we see NATO.''
   In his meeting with Bush, Gorbachev proposed that the military
role of a united Germany be decided by a new ``council of all
Europe'' in which both the United States and the Soviet Union would
participate. Diplomatic aides are to pursue the idea in Copenhagen,
Denmark, this week and in Berlin two weeks later.
   Ellsworth, the former NATO ambassador who now is vice chairman of
the private American Council on Germany, predicted the issue could
still remain a thorny one for the United States and the Soviets.
   ``Russians are saying, `We have the memory of these fears left
over from World War II.' '' said Ellsworth. ``It's totally
understandable, but I just don't think that we in the West can
conduct our politics on the basis of providing psychiatric therapy
for the Russians' neurotic memories of World War II, valid as they
are.''
   ``When the Germans get unified, they are going to have to make
these decisions as a sovereign people or otherwise it won't work,''
he said. ``They will have to be part of the picture, but not in
their present legal status as the defeated power in World War II.''
