<LEADPARA>  Hundreds of anti-war demonstrators walked the Golden Gate Bridge today, waving
banners and flashing peace signs at motorists while the morning commute slowed
to a crawl.;    With signs saying "Talks Not Tanks" and "How Much Blood To The
Gallon?" protesters lined both sides of the bridge. Several jumped out into
traffic lanes, and at least two were arrested, said Don Gappa, a spokesman for
the California Highway Patrol.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Bridge officials closed the span temporarily, and southbound traffic was
backed up as far away as Highway 37, about 15 miles to the north, Gappa said.;
   Earlier in the morning, a group gathered on the bridge to protest recent
violence in Lithuania, but no incidents or arrests were reported.;    Across
the Bay Area, ministers, rabbis, priests and Muslim prayer leaders have urged
world leaders to find a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis.;    Outside
church and synagogue and mosque walls, attempts to avoid war were the focus of
demonstrations and marches.;    In San Jose, as pastor of a vibrant,
predominantly black Baptist congregation in a mean part of the city, Frank
Selkirk has persuaded more than 15 young black men to join the armed forces
over the years to get them off the streets.;    But now those young men are in
the Persian Gulf -- and Pastor Selkirk, his heart heavy with anger toward
world leaders and his head pounding with responsibility for the young lives,
was pleading Sunday with all the passion of his faith.;    "I say to you Mr.
Bush, you are in trouble," Selkirk said in his sermon at Antioch Baptist
Church on Sunday to a chorus of approval. "I say to you today, either you hear
what the world and the nation is saying to you, or one day you will fall to
your knees.";    In Santa Cruz, more than 4,000 people marched from the
University of California campus to the center of town, chanting slogans and
carrying signs. More than 40 local groups sponsored the event.;    "Don't stay
home and watch it on the news" if war starts, speaker Terry Teitlebaum told
the Santa Cruz gathering. "Hit the streets and make the news.";    In downtown
San Jose, more than 150 people joined a demonstration organized by a group
called Women Opposed to War, for whom the marches have become a weekly event
every Sunday night since Dec. 8.;    But while protesters were unified in
their opposition to war and religious leaders were unified in their prayers
for peace, religious groups differed on the reasons for their prayers.;   
"Everybody during times of war is concerned about self," said Rabbi Jonathan
Plaut of Temple Emanu-el in San Jose. "But it's difficult not to be concerned
about our own. Blacks are concerned about blacks in the military, Latinos are
concerned about their numbers in the armed forces, and Jews are concerned
about what effect this has on their life in America . . . and in Israel.";   
Muslim leaders in the Bay Area are praying as fervently for peace as anyone
else these days, said Dr. Khalid Siddiqi of the South Bay Islamic Center in
San Jose. But Siddiqi said he and most other Muslims feel the United States
has no business involving itself in a conflict between two Arab Muslim
nations.;    "You may have heard people refer to this as a jihad, as some kind
of holy war," Siddiqi said. "There is no holiness in this war according to the
holy Koran. No true Muslim anywhere in the world will agree with the invasion
of Kuwait.";    Despite their political differences, the religious leaders of
the Bay Area all did one thing this weekend. They asked their congregations to
pray for an answer to a seemingly intractable problem.;    "I hope that
somehow there's a miracle that can be found that will resolve the crisis,"
said Rabbi Plaut. "It's like the mythical sword of Damocles. That
double-bladed sword is hanging over us, and we don't know what's better: to
face the danger now or to try and face it in the future."  </TEXT>
