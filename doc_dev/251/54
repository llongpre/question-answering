<LEADPARA>  In a haunting and historic visit Monday, Poland's President Lech Walesa asked
Israel to forgive centuries of Polish anti-Semitism and open a new chapter of
reconciliation between Poles and Jews.;    "I am a Christian, and I cannot
weigh with a human scale 20 centuries of injustice between our two peoples.
Here in Israel, the cradle of your culture, the cradle of your renaissance, I
ask your forgiveness," Walesa said, speaking in Polish to a special session of
the Knesset (parliament).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Let our meeting . . . help to renew the links of love between Poles and
Jews.";    Walesa's was the first visit by a president of Poland to the
43-year-old Jewish state. And it stirred emotions in the nation haunted by the
memory of the 6 million Jews who died in Hitler's Holocaust in World War II.; 
  Of the 6 million, Holocaust historians say, more than half were killed on
Polish soil by the Nazis, many in grisly death camps such as Auschwitz and
Treblinka. The Holocaust also snuffed out centuries of Jewish culture in
Poland.;    Walesa made the plea in the first day of a four-day state visit.; 
  During World War II, he said, some gentiles helped hide Jews from the Nazis.
But some did not, he said, conceding, "there were also evil-doers among us."; 
  Walesa shared the speaker's platform with the Polish-born Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, who listened to Walesa's speech without the benefit of Hebrew
translation. The 76-year-old prime minister left for Palestine before World
War II but lost his entire family in the Holocaust.;    Shamir did not reply
directly to the request for forgiveness. But he took up the reconciliation
theme.;    "Our honored guest . . . represents the new Poland, the new free
Poland, which is in the process of regeneration," Shamir said. "Mr. Walesa has
proved himself to be a fearless fighter for freedom.";    Shamir and other
Jewish leaders long have criticized Polish behavior toward the Jews in Poland
before and during World War II. They have said anti-Jewish killing sprees,
called "pogroms," set the stage for Polish collaboration with the occupying
Nazis during World War II.;    Walesa was criticized for anti-Semitism during
his election campaign last year. In a speech at a rally, the former Gdansk
shipyard worker said he was "clean" because he had no Jewish ancestors and was
"100 percent Pole." He later apologized for the remark, calling it a blunder.  </TEXT>
