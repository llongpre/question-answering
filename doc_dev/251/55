   For 19-year-old Krzysztof Tulatycki,
selling stamps in a municipal post office is ``just another job,
like anywhere else.''
   But this particular post office, a few blocks from the center of
old Gdansk, is one of the two spots where the greatest conflagration
in history began.
   Before dawn on Sept. 1, 1939, German armored cars, artillery, and
police and SS detachments armed with flamethrowers surrounded the
main Polish Post Office in the Free City of Danzig and opened fire
on the 50 postal workers inside.
   At the same time, the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein, on a
``courtesy visit'' to Danzig, trained its heavy guns on a 182-man
Polish army garrison stationed on the Westerplatte peninsula in the
city's port area and started firing.
   Soon German dive bombers were over central Poland and tanks had
punched across the border at dozens of spots, heralding the start of
World War II.
   In late August 1939, Danzig was already filled with Nazi troops,
swastikas flew from buildings and young Polish men avoided the
streets for fear of being arrested, recalled Brunon Zwarra, a
70-year-old businessman who has written two books on the period.
   Although nominally independent under the post-World War I Treaty
of Versailles, Danzig _ known today by its Polish name, Gdansk _ had
been tied politically to the German Reich since Adolf Hitler's
National Socialists won control of the city government in 1933
elections.
   The mainly German-speaking Baltic port city, located at the mouth
of the Vistula River that flows through Poland, had been loyal to
Polish or Prussian kings at different turns in its history, usually
enjoying a degree of autonomy.
   Under the Versailles agreement, Danzig and the territory around
it was to be an independent buffer between Poland's newly created
corridor to the Baltic Sea and German-ruled East Prussia. Poland was
given jurisdiction over the city's customs administration, control
of its railroads and limited rights to operate a postal service in
the Free City.
   By 1939, harassment of the Polish officials by Danzig authorities
had turned the guarantees into a mockery.
   Nazi armaments were shipped to the city, and ethnic Poles, who
constituted less than 10 percent of the population, started to flee.
   A German-Polish non-aggression pact was abrogated by Hitler in
April 1939. The death knell of the uneasy peace sounded when Nazi
Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression treaty Aug. 23.
   Zwarra, then 20, a Polish Danziger working for a German company
and having many German friends, saw the handwriting on the wall.
Poles of military age were being arrested on various pretexts, so he
asked a girlfriend to buy him a train ticket and bring it to him.
   Later, on the platform, plainclothes policemen stopped them. Only
when she lied that they were on their way to get married was he let
go.
   In this tense, nervous atmosphere, a small contingent of Polish
postal workers prepared to take their stand.
   The attack came at 4:45 a.m. The postal workers had secretly
armed themselves with rifles, and a reserve officer with military
training had been assigned to lead the defense. The postmen had been
told to hold out for six hours, when a Polish army rescue was
supposed to come. They fought for 14 hours, but the rescuers never
came.
   Five postmen were killed in the battle, two more were slain while
surrendering and about 30 others were executed in a Nazi prison in
October as ``partisans.''
   ``They were simple postmen, defending this plot of Polish soil in
such a heroic way,'' said Andrzej Januszajtis, a Gdansk physicist
and amateur historian. ``For them, it was just a piece of Poland.''
   It was an act of ``great patriotism, but why?'' asks Andrzej
Stanislawski, a retired journalist. ``We Poles are experts in this:
the more hopeless the situation ...,'' he answers, his voice
trailing off.
   Stanislawski, who escaped from the Majdanek death camp in 1944,
lectures on the destruction and reconstruction of Gdansk.
   On Westerplatte, the Polish garrison was outnumbered 20-to-1 but
held out seven days before surrendering.
   It has become a patriotic shrine. Visiting heads of state are
ritually escorted by Poland's leaders to lay wreathes at the base of
the 75-foot-tall granite obelisk memorializing the defenders.
   The monument is the focus of anniversary observances, but the
post office has been less remembered.
   The bombarded and burned building was reconstructed after the
war. One half of the lobby is a museum, and the other half remains a
post office serving the neighborhood. A plaque outside recalls the
postal workers; inside on display is a pre-war Polish mail box
pocked by bullets.
   There is a steady stream of curious visitors, including German
tourists, Tulatycki said.
   He said the war's 50th anniversary does not signify much to him,
but it will be meaningful for his family, especially since his
grandfather was put to death by the Germans for being a communist.
   ``I have a somewhat different view,'' said the young man who came
of age in the era of Solidarity, the movement born in the Lenin
shipyard seven blocks away.
   But asked if he would have followed the example of the postmen
who sacrificed themselves, Tulatycki did not hesitate: ``I would
have done the same.''
   Troubled relations between Poland and Germany still touch Gdansk.
A long-discussed conciliatory visit to the rebuilt, now quite Polish
city by West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker for Sept. 1
observances was quietly scrapped amid lingering tensions over aid to
Poland and other issues.
   Poland's denial that it has a large German minority angers Bonn,
while Poles were irked recently when a leading West German
politician spoke of restoring Germany's 1937 borders, a move that
would erase a third of present-day Poland.
   But in a small token of friendship, Januszajtis said, Poles and
Germans are cooperating to restore a 37-bell carillon to a historic
Gdansk church.
   ``It is a great symbol (that is) very appealing to me. I would
like to close the stage of hatred,'' said the professor, whose
father died at the Auschwitz death camp.
   For Stanislawsji, ``We are a passing-away generation. The young
generation is not so involved in the past. We should look toward the
future.''
