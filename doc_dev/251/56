   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today that
only the truth will heal the wounds of the war Germany began a half
century ago and declared his nation's readiness to reconcile with
Poland.
   In a nationally televised speech to the federal Bundestag, or
parliament, on the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II,
Kohl said Germans had to acknowledge their responsibility for the
Holocaust and Hitler's dictatorship.
   But he said that following Germany's defeat in the war, the
nation had been fundamentally altered and dedicated to the
principles of freedom and democracy. For those reasons, he said, the
younger generation of Germans were absolved of responsibility for
the war.
   ``They bear no guilt for dictatorship or the world war _ neither
collective as there is no such thing, nor individual as their elders
retain that,'' he said.
   But Kohl also said the horrors inflicted on Europe by the Nazi
regime could never be overcome or underestimated.
   ``It must always be a reminder,'' he said, referring to the
millions of victims of the Holocaust. ``It can never be rendered
harmless by false comparisons.''
   Joining parliament to hear the 50-minute speech were guests that
included Polish students, Warsaw's ambassador to West Germany,
Ryszard Karski, and U.S. Ambassador Vernon Walters.
   Kohl was interrupted by applause only once, when he said West
Germany wished success for Poland's new leadership.
   Relations with Poland and other communist nations of the East
bloc were a major theme of Kohl's address and of memorial speeches
by other West German dignitaries, including President Richard von
Weizsaecker and former chancellor Willy Brandt.
   ``We want understanding between the German and Polish peoples,''
Kohl declared. ``This is our duty, and it expresses the yearning of
both peoples.''
   Poland was the first nation to fall victim to Nazi attack, when
Hitler's army invaded Sept. 1, 1939, beginning the world war that
would eventually claim 50 million lives.
   ``In the name of Germany and by German hands were the terrors
brought about for the Polish people,'' Kohl said. ``Reconciliation
is only possible if we tell the whole truth.''
   Kohl recalled the systematic extermination of Jews, Poles,
gypsies and political opponents, and blamed the Nazis and ``the all
too many Germans as well as many others abroad who allowed
themselves to be blinded and misguided by tyranny.''
   His cautious attempt to address the responsibility of today's
Germany for the crimes of the past recalled memories of a more
controversial effort last November by then-Bundestag President
Philipp Jenninger.
   Jenninger, of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, offended
liberals and conservatives alike when his recollection of how
Germans at the time praised Hitler's repressions was interpreted as
being in sympathy with those sentiments.
   In that speech on the Nov. 10, 1988, the anniversary of the
Kristallnacht pogrom against Jews 50 years earlier, Jenninger said
the Germans of that time saw the early years of the Third Reich as a
``triumphal march.''
   Jewish leaders including Simon Wiesenthal later excused
Jenninger's remarks as unfortunate but not ill-intended, but the
parliamentary leader stepped down a day after the speech in the face
of widespread public criticism.
   Kohl said the foundation of the West German state established
after the war discourages the growth of extremism, but that radical
elements persist today.
   ``Extremism from the political right or left can succeed and come
to power only when the citizens turn away from the democratic
parties or stand indifferent,'' he said.
   He made no direct reference to the ultra-right Republicans party
but appeared to be warning West Germans against defecting from
moderation.
   The Republicans have garnered as much as 10 percent of the vote
in recent local elections on a campaign platform that some view as
threatening the rights of foreigners and have drawn important
support away from Kohl's conservative party.
