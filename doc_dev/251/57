<HEAD>Catholic Church Leader Urges Jews to Stop Being anti-Polish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic Primate Jozef Glemp on
Saturday urged Jews worldwide to stop being anti-Polish in his first
comment on the controversy surrounding a convent at Auschwitz death
camp.
   ``Let us start a dialogue in honesty and in truth,'' said
Cardinal Glemp, leader of Poland's Catholic Church. ``If there would
be no `anti-Polonism,' there will be no anti-Semitism in our
country.''
   He spoke to thousands of pilgrims at Jasna Gora Monastery in the
southern city of Czestochowa on the holiday honoring the Black
Madonna, Poland's most revered Catholic icon.
   Glemp was responding to international criticism of the church's
Aug. 10 abrogation of a 1987 promise to move the convent from the
perimeter of the former Nazi camp.
   Many Jewish groups consider the convent an intrusion at the site
where more than 2.5 million Jews were killed by the Nazis. Three
million of the 3.5 million Jews in Poland at World War II were
killed in the Holocaust.
   Most survivors fled immediately after and in another wave after a
government-led anti-Semitic purge in 1968, leaving the Jewish
population here today at only several thousand.
   Glemp, in coments reported by the PAP state news agency, said:
   ``Have there been animosities and adventures against Jews in
Poland? Yes, there have. Have there been Jews in Poland,
businessmen, who neglected and detested Poles? Yes. Were there
Jewish collaborators during the (Nazi) occupation who did not grow
into the heroic defenders of the Warsaw Ghetto? Yes.''
   He also noted Jews were among Polish soldiers killed at the siege
of Monte Cassino in Italy and at Katyn in the Soviet Union.
   ``The brotherhood of common martyrdom has extraordinary
significance ... So why has the problem of Auschwitz and the convent
of the Carmelite nuns been born? Why has it exploded so suddenly 40
years after putting out the crematoria?'' he asked.
   ``Dialogue is needed ... The systematic explanation of difficult
things, not of putting forth demands,'' Glemp said.
   ``The Carmelite nuns living beside the camp site in Oswiecim
wanted and want to be a symbol of the human solidarity which covers
the living and the dead.
   ``Can't you see, dear Jews, that acting against them offends the
feelings of all Poles and our sovereignty ...
   ``Your power is the mass media at easy disposal in many
countries. Don't let them serve to kindle anti-Polonism.''
   Referring to seven American Jews who climbed a fence at the
convent July 14 and occupied the convent yard before being roughly
dragged out by workmen, Glemp said, ``Don't call the (Jewish)
assailants heroes.''
   He also urged Jews to distinguish between the Auschwitz camp,
where he said mainly Poles were killed, and the nearby Birkenau
camp, run from a Nazi headquarters at Auschwitz, where mainly Jews
died.
