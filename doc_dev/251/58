   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa met Tuesday
with World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman and pledged to
oppose anti-Semitism in Poland.
   Bronfman, continuing a visit to Poland that included meetings
Monday with President Wojciech Jaruzelski and Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, also traveled to the Auschwitz concentration
camp in southern Poland.
   ``There is nothing to be said here, only the wail remains,''
Bronfman wrote in the visitors' book at the camp where officials
estimate up to 2.5 million Jews were killed by the Nazis during
World War II.
   During the meeting with Walesa, Bronfman expressed concern about
what he termed a reappearance of anti-Semitism in Poland.
   Noting that there are only 10,000 Jews left in all of Poland,
compared with a pre-World War II population of 3.5 million, he said
it was unprecedented for anti-Semitism to remain in a country where
there are so few Jews.
   He asked Walesa for a public condemnation of anti-Semitism.
   ``I have condemned anti-Semitism everywhere,'' Walesa replied.
``I have always been doing so and I will do so.''
   Walesa called it ``a great loss that there are so few Jews in
Poland.''
   Jews have lived in Poland for nearly 1,000 years and made up 10
percent of Poland's population before World War II. But despite
that long history of coexistence, relations between Polish
Catholics and Polish Jews have often been marked by tension and
hostility.
   The Solidarity-led government of Mazowiecki has pledged to
improve Polish-Jewish relations and oppose any resurgence of
anti-Semitism.
   It plans to restore diplomatic relations with Israel next week,
and has moved to speed up construction of an alternate home for
Roman Catholic nuns whose convent next to Auschwitz has offended
Jews and others.
