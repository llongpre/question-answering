   On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the
start of World War II, Poles from Lech Walesa to President Wojciech
Jaruzelski remembered the conflict with sadness Thursday and vowed
``War Never Again.''
   ``They fell on the field of glory!,'' shouted soldiers assembled
for a torchlight ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in
Warsaw.
   In a symbolic roll call, an officer read out a list of groups of
the fallen _ soldiers, sailors, pilots and the millions of civilians
killed in camps and forgotten forests _ and the honor guard replied:
``Honor to their memory''
   ``War never again!,'' the officer shouted.
   ``Never! Never! Never!,'' the guard responded.
   The alarm read on the day of the Nazi attack by then-Mayor Stefen
Starzynski was replayed, and the wail of sirens as the German
bombers approached once more sounded in the twilight.
   Jaruzelski, wearing his army general's uniform, saluted as he
approached the tomb to lay flowers portraying the white Polish eagle
in a sea of red.
   Beside him was Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the longtime
Solidarity activist who last week became Poland's first
non-communist government leader in 45 years.
   On Friday, Jaruzelski will speak at Westerplatte on the Baltic
coast, where the first shots were fired, and Leonard Bernstein will
lead a memorial concert in Warsaw.
   But a key event bringing together members of the world's
religions to pray for peace appeared likely to be marred by a
boycott by Poland's only rabbi. He said he is staying away because
the Roman Catholic Church has not removed a convent from the
Auschwitz death camp that many consider offensive to the memory of
the estimated 2.5 million Jews who died there.
   The World Prayer for Peace project began Thursday with a solemn
convocation at Warsaw University led by Polish primate Cardinal
Jozef Glemp and attended by leaders of many world religions,
including Orthodox Christians, Protestants, Hindus and Buddhists.
   Glemp was joined by Jaruzelski, who noted Poland was the first
country visited by the war and remembered the 6 million Poles who
died.
   ``War destroys man and his material and spiritual heritage, but
it is man alone who sets it ablaze,'' the general said.
   ``Opposing war means ... (engaging in) dialogue, tolerance and
mutual respect, including endorsing the sovereignty of states and
the rights of nations to self-determination.''
   Glemp spoke of Poland's difficult past _ ``a country that
suffered greatly ... preserving always its deep religious and
spiritual values.''
   The primate, who has been criticized for insensitivity to Jews,
said Poland was a tolerant country where Catholics and Jews had
lived together. He said Jews were the most numerous religious
community besides Catholics in Poland before the war and ``suffered
the greatest persecution.''
   ``In terrible death camps organized by the Nazis, Jews were
killed for the sole fact that they were Jews,'' Glemp said.
   He departed briefly from his text to say he had made the same
point Saturday, in a homily about Polish-Jewish relations that later
was criticized by some Jewish and Catholic leaders as being
insensitive to Jews.
   Elsewhere, Castle Square in downtown Warsaw was decorated with a
huge sign in English reading ``War Never Again,'' and in Gdansk,
Walesa referred to the war Thursday as ``that great human
stupidity.''
   The conflict began at 4:45 a.m. on Sept. 1, 1939. The German
battleship Schleswig-Holstein opened fire on a garrison of 182
Polish soldiers on the Westerplatte peninsula in the port of the
Free City of Danzig, and German troops fired on the city's main
Polish post office.
   At dozens of points along the Polish frontier, the Nazi
``blitzkrieg'' _ lightning war _ began without warning, an invasion
by 1.5 million German troops that was to obliterate the last
organized Polish army units by Oct. 5.
   Britain and France, after demanding the Germans withdraw, honored
treaty obligations and declared war on Hitler on Sept. 3.
   Poles continued to fight _ in Poland in the underground Home
Army, in the West as pilots in the Battle of Britain or in Gen.
Wladyslaw Anders' army that crossed Africa into Italy, and in the
East under Soviet auspices. Poles were among the Allied troops who
entered Berlin on May 9, 1945.
   The Solidarity-dominated Polish Senate adopted a statement on the
war that said the anniversary should be a day of ``new horizons of
reconciliation.''
   Nearly one out of every five Poles died. Victims included 3
million Polish Jews swallowed up in the Holocaust, 15,000 Polish
officers believed massacred on Stalin's orders at Katyn and
elsewhere in the Soviet Union, 200,000 residents of Warsaw who died
in the capital's doomed 1944 uprising, and boy and girl scouts who
organized underground resistance units.
