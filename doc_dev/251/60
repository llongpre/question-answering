<LEADPARA>  At 7:55 a.m. Saturday, a formation of jet fighters shot across a clear sky, as
clear as it had been on the morning they were commemorating.;   Below -- in
the crater of an extinct volcano where Hawaiians used to sacrifice humans to
gods and where Americans have buried those who made the ultimate sacrifice for
their country -- a military band played "The Star-Spangled Banner." Thousands
of people looked up and thought back, 50 years to the minute, to when the
sudden roar of planes overhead marked the start of war.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The gathering at Punchbowl, officially called the National Memorial
Cemetery of the Pacific, was the largest of a dozen simultaneous events here
to remember the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. For many survivors, the
ceremony was an emotional pause in a largely festive five-day reunion.;  
"Something like this brings it all back," said Clyde Stephenson, a retired
electrical contractor from Appleton, Wis. Then he cried.;   Punchbowl provided
a powerful setting. About 26,000 war dead and their dependents are buried in
the crater, beneath simple gray markers that lie flat on the grass. Dawn
lighted the crater's rim. In the sun's first rays, the crater looked as soft
and lush as velvet.;   President and Mrs. Bush arrived at dawn, their first of
three appearances at Pearl Harbor ceremonies here.;   Bush, a Navy veteran who
flew 50 combat missions in the Pacific and was shot down by the Japanese, told
the survivors he understood their feelings on this day. "I remember sharing
friendship and danger in these skies and ocean," he said. "Some of my closest
friends, like some of your closest friends, never came home.";   Responding to
critics who now argue that the United States should reject engagement abroad
after the end of the Cold War and "come home," Bush said World War II had
occurred because a victorious America had decided after World War I that "we
should turn all of our energies inward. That notion of isolationism flew
escort for the bombers that attacked our men 50 years ago.";   Regret for
internment;   Bush expressed regret for the internment of 120,000
Japanese-Americans, "innocent victims who committed no offense." And he
cautioned Americans of the post-Cold War era not to forget the main lesson of
Pearl Harbor: vigilance.;   "Winning the peace demands preparedness," he
said.;   Later, at the USS Arizona Memorial, a gleaming white bridge-shaped
structure that spans the sunken ruins of the battleship, Bush paid homage to
the 1,177 servicemen who died there. He observed that drops of oil rise each
15 seconds to the surface from the sunken hulk, where the remains of 945
Americans are entombed.;   "With each drop, it is as though God himself were
crying," Bush said.;   He appealed for reconciliation with the Japanese and
other past foes.;   "World War II is over," Bush said. "It is history. We won.
We crushed totalitarianism, and when that was done, we helped our enemies give
birth to democracies. We reached out, both in Europe and in Asia, and made our
enemies our friends. We healed their wounds, and in the process we lifted
ourselves up.";   Bush's voice broke as he finished his emotional tribute to
the men of the Arizona and the other casualties of Pearl Harbor.;   'A truly
blessed shrine'; "Look behind you at Battleship Row -- behind me, the gun
turret still visible, and the flag, flying proudly from a truly blessed
shrine," Bush said. "Look into your hearts and minds: You will see boys who
this day became men and men who became heroes. Look at the water here -- clear
and quiet, bidding us to sum up and remember.;   "One day, in what now seems
another lifetime, it wrapped its arms around the finest sons any nation could
ever have, and it carried them to a better world," Bush continued with
difficulty. "May God bless them. And may God bless America, the most wondrous
land on Earth.";   The president and his wife, Barbara, then peered deeply
through a well of the memorial into the waters where the Arizona went down and
sprinkled flower leis on the water in memory of the crew.;   Not every
sentiment or every story on this day was solemn. But each had poignancy.;  
The youngest survivor here, age 66, dramatized the fact that it is often
children who fight wars. The oldest, 96-year-old Bryan Thomas from
Mississippi, provided a reminder that the veterans who have kept alive the
memory of this date will not be around much longer.;   3 1/2 years of
anniversaries;   The Pearl Harbor commemoration marks the beginning of 3 1/2
years of wartime anniversaries. Next May: Coral Sea. June: Midway. August '92:
the landing on Guadalcanal. Although these do not have the national symbolism
of Pearl Harbor -- or the huge organization of survivors devoted to keeping
the memory alive -- these battles are seared into many hearts. The pain of
Pearl Harbor survivors Saturday is a taste of what is to come for those who
survived other fights, or have loved ones who didn't.;   When the ceremony
ended at Punchbowl and the crater was tranquil, Clyde Stephenson walked up the
southern slope. First, he visited the grave of his brother Glenwood, one of
two killed during World War II. Then Stephenson stopped by the grave of Earl
Waller, a shipmate on the USS California who died exactly a half-century ago.;
  The marker sat in the shade of a giant monkey pod tree. Like all the graves
of Pearl Harbor victims, a red rose lay across the top of the grave and a
small 48-star flag was planted beside it.;   Stephenson had been here before.
The last time, he watched burials for Vietnam soldiers. But on Saturday, his
pain seemed as fresh as the dirt of a newly dug grave. Whenever he tried to
talk, he broke down.;   "This 50th," he said. "It seems like it's the last one
for us."  </TEXT>
