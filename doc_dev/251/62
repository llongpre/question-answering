   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens
arrived Monday for a four-day visit during which full diplomatic
relations with Poland are to be restored after a 23-year break.
   Arens meets Tuesday with his Polish counterpart, Foreign
Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski, to sign the protocol establishing
the ties broken by Poland after the 1967 Middle East War.
   He also has appointments Tuesday with Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki and President Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   The foreign minister's first day was spent in emotional visits
to memorials to Poland's once-vibrant Jewish community, reduced to
a few thousand from 3.5 million before World War II.
   ``Every Jew who comes to Poland must remember the tragedy of the
Holocaust that the Jewish nation went through on this land,'' Arens
said, the official PAP news agency reported.
   He paid homage at the monument to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of
1943, when Jews, held in a walled-in section of the city to face
starvation or deportation, rose up against the Nazi occupiers.
   Arens stood in silence at the monument at Umschlagplatz, the
depot where 300,000 Warsaw Jews were loaded on trains to the Nazi
concentration camps. He went to the Jewish Cemetery, where acres of
overgrown graves testify to the obliteration of later generations.
   He laid a wreath at the Polish Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and
visited the Majdanek concentration camp near Lublin in southeastern
Poland.
   Arens on Wednesday will go to the Auschwitz death camp in
southern Poland, where the presence of a Roman Catholic convent in
a former Nazi warehouse strained Jewish-Polish relations and
stirred international controversy.
   Construction of an interfaith prayer center to house the nuns
farther from the camp began last week, a year after the passing of
the deadline for moving the convent set in an accord reached by
Jewish and Catholic leaders in Geneva.
   Polish press coverage of the Arens visit has focused on the
Solidarity-led government's position acknowledging the error of the
decision to sever ties and the act's consequences, including an
anti-Semitic purge in 1968.
   ``Poland Apologizes to Israel'' and ``Return to Normalcy'' were
among the newspaper headlines Monday. The daily Zycie Warszawy said
the breaking of ties ``could have looked spectacular then, and
could even seem justified, but in fact it brought about more losses
than profits.''
   Poland, with the rest of the Warsaw Pact except Romania, cut
relations with Israel after the 1967 war. Hungary in September
became the first nation to restore ties, and Czechoslovakia was the
second on Feb. 9.
   From 350,000 to 500,000 Israelis were born in Poland, the
newspaper noted, including the first Israeli prime minister, David
Ben Ben Gurion, and the present one, Yitzhak Shamir.
   Polish-Israeli relations have steadily improved since 1986, when
each country established an interest section in the other's capital.
   Poland's new government, however, also has sought to establish
even-handed relations with Arab states and has not changed its
position in support of the Palestinian nation's right to a homeland.
   Arens is accompanied by a delegation of business leaders and has
talks scheduled with Polish Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowic, who
drafted Poland's radical shift toward a market-driven economy.
   Poland is seeking Western investment and officials have said
they hope the improved relations will increase Polish-Israeli
trade, estimated at $60 million last year.
