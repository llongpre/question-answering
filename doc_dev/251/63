   Amid the hills of rural Pennsylvania,
where the Holocaust's horrors seem long ago and far away, a Polish
parish is converting a church basement into a museum evoking the
concentration camp where the ``Saint of Auschwitz'' died 47 years
ago Sunday.
   ``I lived through the cruelties and atrocities of World War II,
and I would like the people in this country to have some idea what
transpired,'' said Stanislaw Dziob, 55, an engineer from Krakow,
Poland.
   He and another visitor from Poland are transforming the basement
of St. Thomas Roman Catholic Church into a museum made to look and
feel like the concentration camp where St. Maximilian Kolbe died.
   While honoring all those killed by the Nazis, the museum
spotlights the Polish victims, especially Kolbe, a Franciscan friar
who volunteered to die so a fellow prisoner at Auschwitz might live.
   The 47-year-old priest, No. 16670 to his Nazi torturers, died by
lethal injection on Aug. 14, 1941. He was declared a saint by Pope
John Paul II on Oct. 10, 1982. A week later, a shrine to the saint
was dedicated in the shadow of St. Thomas, an anchor of this
ethnic, former coal mining town 50 miles south of Pittsburgh.
   ``So often in the United States, people speak of the
extermination of 6 million Jews, quite forgetting the extermination
of (millions of) Poles,'' Dziob said, speaking softly in Polish.
Many of the Jews killed by the Nazis were Poles as well.
   Busloads of Roman Catholics from Pennsylvania and neighboring
states, most of them Polish-Americans, regularly descend on the
shrine, a small, stone structure topped with barbed wire and
holding the ashes of Holocaust victims.
   Many visitors are moved to tears when they hear the church's
pastor, the Rev. Lawrence Hoppe, tell of the supreme sacrifice made
by the frail, tubercular priest from Zdunska Wola, Poland.
   Even though it is incomplete, visitors also can visit the
museum. Its dedication is planned for Aug. 14, 1989. Unlike the
shrine, the museum is meant to reach beyond religion, according to
Hoppe.
   ``I see the shrine as a place to come and pray, to develop some
piety and some closer relationship with God,'' said Hoppe, 54, who
is of Polish descent and translated for his Polish visitors. ``The
museum I see as more intellectual, academic.''
   Built in six cubicles lining two walls of the dimly lit
basement, the museum is also more brutal to the senses. To lessen
the shock, Hoppe and others plan to increase the intensity of the
exhibits over time.
   ``We would not shock the public too much at once, (rather)
prepare them, bring people into a theme of suffering, a theme of
the terribly horrendous effects of war,'' said Waclaw Rybotycki,
42, an artist and architect at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow.
   It is called the Expo Museum _ ``expo'' meaning to expose the
cruelty of the Nazis _ and has the blessing of Francis Gajowniczek,
86, the Pole whose life was spared by Kolbe's martyrdom.
   Dziob and Rybotycki, who began planning the museum with Hoppe's
predecessor, arrived last month from Poland.
   They brought with them 70 items for a display depicting the life
of St. Maximilian and the atrocities at Auschwitz in Poland, the
most notorious concentration camp. They received help in compiling
the collection from the National Museum in Krakow, the museum at
Auschwitz and the Franciscan community founded by Kolbe in 1927
outside Warsaw.
   The displays will include recreations of death-camp cells,
photographs, tombstone-shaped plaques, an eternal flame and an oil
painting by Rybotycki showing St. Maximilian about to die.
   Edith Stein, a Jewish-born Carmelite nun from Poland who died in
1942 in Auschwitz's gas chambers, will be honored, and there will
be scenes from the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals.
   A stone Wall of Honor will commemorate U.S. servicemen who
liberated the concentration camps.
   Despite the despair, the overriding theme of the museum is the
struggle between good and evil and love's ultimate triumph over
hate.
   ``You cannot have peace unless you have justice,'' said Hoppe,
who hopes the museum and shrine, through St. Maximilian's example,
can help ``prevent World War III, World War IV and any future world
wars.''
