   War veterans, young people and Solidarity
activists on Sunday quietly marked the 50th anniversary of the
invasion of Poland by the Soviet Red Army.
   The government appealed for dignified demonstrations, and the
observations were small compared to those held Sept. 1 for the 50th
anniversary of the Nazi invasion of Poland that started World War II.
   But for Poles, Sept. 17, 1939, was just as tragic. When the Red
Army entered from the east Poland was divided and millions were
deported, killed, or forced to remain in the Soviet Union after the
war.
   ``May Sept. 17, 1939, never be repeated in any nation again,''
Cardinal Henryk Gulbinowicz told more than 100,000 pilgrims at an
annual workers' Mass in the southern city of Czestochowa.
   The new Solidarity government, in an appeal on national
television Saturday night, upheld the right to mark the event but
urged that ceremonies be held in a calm manner.
   The appeal for calm was repeated throughout Sunday on the radio.
In previous years, demonstrations on the anniversary were often
broken up by police.
   In Warsaw, about 1,000 people met at the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier to lay wreaths representing the Home Army, the underground
resistance force that fought both the Nazis and the Red Army; the
Warsaw chapter of Solidarity; and the Confederation for an
Independent Poland, a small independence group.
   ``Fifty years of spitting at our history. These are the effects
of Sept. 1 and Sept. 17, the effects of the plot by the two biggest
criminals in world history _ Hitler and Stalin,'' Edward Bohdan, a
Home Army veteran, told the crowd.
   Many of the same group later went to a monument in Warsaw's
Powazki military cemetery for the more than 4,000 Polish officers
killed by Soviet security forces in the Katyn forest in 1940.
   Bohdan said reconciliation with the Soviets would not be possible
until ``they (Soviets) tell the truth'' about the massacre. The
Soviets maintain the officers were killed by the Nazis, while Polish
and Western documents say the Soviets were responsible.
   In the Baltic port of Gdansk, supporters of the still-banned
Independent Students Union and other youth groups held a rally as
did activists of Fighting Solidarity, a hard-line splinter group
that opposes dialogue with Communists.
   This year, as a result of the more tolerant political climate in
Poland, even hard-line newspapers such as the Communist Party daily
Trybuna Ludu have carried reports on what happened during and after
the Soviet invasion.
   Those facts have been well known to a large part of the Polish
public for many years as a result of teachings in church,
independent publications, and the experience of Poles who lived
through the war.
   Trybuna Ludu said Saturday that the Soviet invasion resulted in
repression and mass crimes involving millions of Poles.
   ``The date of Sept. 17 is deeply rooted in the consciousness of
the Polish nation. Especially because the entry of Soviet troops was
followed by growing repressions, and even mass crimes which involved
millions of Poles,'' Trybuna Ludu said.
   Gradually, the party has been opening archives and treating the
subject of the Soviet invasion and other painful events with greater
frankness.
   In Czestochowa, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told more than
100,000 workers that a decade of struggle for union rights had
finally succeeded.
   Speaking at the end of a Mass at the Jasna Gora monastery, Walesa
said that ``We have come here to give thanks for our regained
rights.''
   A year ago, Walesa told a smaller crowd that legal recognition of
the long-banned union was ``very close.'' Solidarity then had just
agreed to end a wave of strikes and enter into talks with
authorities.
   The union was legalized and now Solidarity's Tadeusz Masowiecki
heads the government as prime minister.
