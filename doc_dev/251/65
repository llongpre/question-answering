   After marching from the Auschwitz death
camp to the crematoria of Birkenau, the roughly 4,000 teen-agers
from 36 countries marking Holocaust Memorial Day lighted torches
and heard a prayer for the dead.
   In Israel, sirens wailed for two minutes Sunday as life briefly
came to a standstill in remembrance of the 6 million Jews slain by
the Nazis.
   Writer Elie Wiesel, diplomats and Israeli parliamentarians
joined the young marchers in southern Poland for the two-mile
``March of the Living.''
   The sunny day turned cloudy and light rain started as Wiesel
stood at a podium before a gray stone monument to recall his time
at Auschwitz:
   ``Years and years ago I saw _ I cannot tell you what I saw. I'm
afraid that if I told you we would all wake up in tears and would
not be able to stop. I see a young girl. ... ,'' he said before
stopping, apparently unable to continue. He silently left the
podium.
   Many cried as the students _ some carrying Israeli flags and
others bouquets of flowers _ walked along the train tracks that
ended at the cremetoria.
   Dandelions waved in the wind-swept grass now covering the rubble
of the camp. Torches were lighted, poems read and mournful violin
songs played before a reading of the Kaddish, a Jewish prayer for
the dead.
   Shawn Tepper, 17, of Miami Beach, Fla., held hands with a row of
other young American Jews. She said the experience was overwhelming
but ``proved to everyone that we are alive, we are together and we
are strong.''
   The march was in memory of those who died in Nazi death camps as
well as in the Warsaw ghetto uprising that began April 19, 1943.
   In the uprising, several hundred Jewish insurgents staged a
desperate three-week struggle against the Nazi drive to liquidate
the last 75,000 residents of the walled ghetto.
   Sunday's event was the second ``March of the Living.''
Participants said it had special significance because of the drive
toward German unification and Israel's rapid renewal of ties with
Eastern European countries that once had flourishing Jewish
communities.
   The Nazis built Auschwitz as the main engine of Hitler's ``Final
Solution.'' Estimates of the death count vary, but recent research
has put the toll at the camp at about 1.5 million, more than 90
percent Jews.
   In Israel, as the sirens sounded at 10 a.m. Sunday, traffic
ground to a halt, and thousands stood silently at attention to
honor the victims.
   Hundreds of Israelis also marked the day by participating in
ceremonies across the country at which the names of victims were
read by relatives and friends.
   According to recent statistics, 302,404 Holocaust survivors live
in the nation of 4.7 million people, including Polish-born Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir and other top military and political
leaders.
   ``I remember my family members who have died in those terrible
and fearsome days,'' said Shamir, 74, during a ceremony outside
parliament. He lost his parents, two sisters, their husbands and
children during World War II.
   The Holocaust still deeply influences private lives and politics
in Israel, reflected in both the right-wing preoccupation with
security and the liberal drive to guard human rights. But its
impact on the younger generation is diminishing.
