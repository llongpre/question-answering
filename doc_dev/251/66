<LEADPARA>  I want to speak up for all Americans and say that the deaths of Iraqi
civilians is absolutely horrible. All Americans, anti-war and pro-justice
alike, grieve over the hardships suffered by Iraqi civilians.;    I would,
however, like to comment on the positions taken by the anti-war protesters.
The country as a whole has studied all the arguments of this war for months,
and the United States Congress, representing us, decided that use of force is
justified. Our population is never going to agree completely on anything, so
when 80 percent of a population as diverse as ours is supportive of the war,
it is absolutely phenomenal.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Once the shooting started, being anti-war became synonymous with being
against the troops. Protesters say they are not against the troops, only
against the war; this is nonsense. To end the war now is to tell the troops
they have been put in harm's way for months for no reason. It is to say that
those dead have died for absolutely no reason. It is to call those brave
enough not to suddenly "realize" they have conscientious objector convictions
"jerks." If anti-war protesters' fulfilled agenda, as a byproduct, humiliates
and denigrates the troops, then they are in fact against the troops.;   
Protesters tell us that they, like the Vietnam protesters, will eventually
change the public's mind through education. They shouldn't flatter themselves.
Vietnam protesters knew more about that war than did the population at large,
whereas today's protesters are steeped in illogic, ignorance, and a lack of
courage. Everybody on the planet already knows all the facts about the
invasion of Kuwait, so further education is not possible. Everybody in the
country knows all the facts of this war, and yet an amazing 80 percent are
behind the war effort.;    Don't tell us we are committing genocide against
Iraqi civilians when Iraq itself counted but 300 casualties after three weeks
of bombing. Don't tell us Kuwait belongs to Iraq unless we also agree that
California should be returned to Mexico. Don't tell us Iraq is trying to help
the Palestinians; that argument lacks any merit. Don't tell us we are
inconsistent for not helping Iran when the Iran-Iraq war started, since at the
time Iran was holding Americans hostage.;    Protesters, go home. Bone up on
reality. Read some history and learn to think logically. Consider that, since
1918, only two despots have started wars of territorial conquest. One is
Saddam; the other was that little Austrian.;    -- Victor J. Marshall;
