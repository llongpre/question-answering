   Leaders of a new Germany rushed to assure the
world Wednesday that it would strive for peace in the future and
would never forget the dark lessons of its Nazi past.
   As most of the nation savored its first hours of unity and
sovereignty after nightlong celebrations, leftist radicals
protesting unification rampaged in Berlin. Police fired tear gas
and water cannons in street battles, and about 50 people were
arrested.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, widely credited with making
unification possible, will visit Germany next month, a government
spokemsan said Wednesday. A hero's welcome is expected.
   In a message to governments worldwide, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
pledged Germany would never again pose the territorial claims that
marked Germany from its initial unification in 1871 to its defeat
and division in World War II.
   ``In the future, only peace will emanate from German soil,''
Kohl said.
   ``At the same time, we stand by our moral and legal
responsibilities that arise from German history,'' Kohl added. That
was a reference to the Nazi past and the Holocaust, which claimed
the lives of 6 million Jews.
   President Richard von Weizsaecker raised the same themes in his
speech at the ceremony in Berlin's Philharmonic hall.
   ``The Nazi terror and the war it caused inflicted untold serious
injustice and suffering on almost all of Europe and on us,'' he
said. ``We continuously recall the victims.''
   Among the several hundred invited guests was Heinz Galinski, an
Auschwitz death camp survivor and now the leader of Germany's
Jewish community.
   ``No one among us will forget that there never would have been a
separation without the war started by Germany under Hitler,'' said
von Weizsaecker, whose own father was convicted of two Nazi war
crimes for his role as a Foreign Ministry official.
   Von Weizsacker said: ``For the first time, we Germans are not
creating a point of contention on the European agenda.''
   Members of the renowned Berlin Philharmonic played works of
famous German composers, including Johannes Brahms and Johann
Sebastian Bach.
   The rebirth of Germany as the greatest economic power in Europe
has worried its neighbors, particularly Poland, one-third of whose
territory once belonged to Germany. Kohl singled out Poland when
saying that a future Germany will ``make no territorial claims
against anyone.''
   Kohl, however, reiterated plans to amend Germany's constitution
to send German troops to the Persian Gulf. He said a united and
sovereign Germany was willing to help U.N. efforts in ``protecting
and restoring peace.''
   Although Germany has committed $2 billion to the U.S.-led
multinational effort to isolate Iraq after Iraqi troops invaded
Kuwait, Washington has urged the Germans to do more.
   Germans say their constitution prevents them from sending troops
outside NATO territory, but Kohl reaffirmed in his message that he
will seek an amendment that will make such a move possible.
   His message came after Germany held a nightlong nationwide
celebration with fireworks and music.
   The nation united at the stroke of midnight when a giant German
flag was raised in front of the battle-scarred Reichstag building
in Berlin. Kohl, von Weizsaecker and other leaders joined in
singing the national anthem.
   The unification came 11 months after the Berlin Wall fell in a
peaceful revolt that cast aside Communist East German overlords.
   Random violence marred the unification celebrations overnight in
nearly a dozen cities, including Hamburg, Goettingen and Leipzig,
the cradle of East Germany's peaceful revolution against the old
Communist government.
   In Berlin, about 20,000 protesters, most of them young leftists,
rallied Wednesday in the working class district of Kreuzberg. As
the march moved toward central Alexanderplatz square, a group of
protesters wearing masks broke store windows, set cars afire and
scuffled with passers-by.
   Police battled the protesters with nightsticks and fired water
cannons and tear gas.
