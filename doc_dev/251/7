   Pope John Paul II, speaking to Poles Friday
via TV from the Vatican, recalled the horrors that gripped the
capital of his native land 50 years ago with the Nazi invasion of
Poland.
   The pope's speech was part of an international ``Day of Prayer
for Peace'' in Warsaw, attended by leaders of the Roman Catholic
Church and other religions, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of
the start of World War II. But Poland's only rabbi stayed away to
protest the presence of a Catholic convent outside the Auschwitz
concentration camp in southern Poland.
   ``On Sept. 1, 1939, with the invasion of Poland, began a long and
painful period of suffering of humanity, of Christians and Jews, of
everyone,'' the pontiff said, his image appearing on a large TV
screen overlooking Warsaw's Victory Square.
   ``Fifty years later, what sounds on Warsaw streets is not the
echo of heavy soldier's boots ... but the light and friendly steps
of pilgrims, men and women professing different faiths, who come
from all parts of the world. They have no power other than the power
of memories, which stimulates reflection and fervent prayer for
peace,'' the pontiff said in Polish.
   ``The memory of World War II, and the local conflicts that have
been going on for the past 50 years, and those which still
tragically continue, obliges all of us to persist in the aim to
eliminate war from all parts of the world, so it ceases to be a tool
for resolving disputes,'' he said.
   In Warsaw, banners of black changing into Poland's white and red
colors hung from the windows of the Royal Castle, painstakingly
rebuilt in the 1970s after being leveled during the war along with
much of Warsaw.
   Around the square hung a rainbow banner decorated with a dove and
``Peace'' written in many languages. A huge billboard proclaimed:
``War Never Again.''
   Photographs of the destruction of Warsaw were shown on a TV
screen set up for the pope's address, and smoke was released from
the castle tower to recall its burning in September 1939 after being
struck by a German bomb.
   On Friday evening, Leonard Bernstein conducted an anniversary
symphony concert at the Grand Theater.
   Earlier, Solidarity leaders joined Communist President Wojciech
Jaruzelski in a display of national unity at the Baltic port of
Gdansk as the country honored the small Polish garrison that exactly
50 years ago bore the first fierce Nazi onslaught of World War II.
   On one side of Jaruzelski was Solidarity leader Lech Walesa; on
the other was newly elected Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a
longtime union adviser.
   A third senior Solidarity adviser, Senate Speaker Andrzej
Stelmachowski, stood a few steps behind the president, who used the
occasion to stress the theme of national understanding.
   ``On this day of great national memories we look not only into
the past but also into the future, into the near future and that
which is still far ahead,'' said the president.
   ``We should never again be weak, quarreling or isolated,'' said
Jaruzelski. ``Tomorrow, Poland must be stronger than today, through
its economic potential and most of all through mutual effort,
agreement and national reconciliation.''
   Sitting in the front row were 53 veterans of the legendary
garrison that endured the guns of the German warship
Schleswig-Holstein and staved off a determined infantry assault for
seven days.
   ``I shot ... at the enemy. It was my duty,'' said Wiktor
Bialous-Bielas, 73, wearing his uniform and holding a sword as he
recalled the morning 50 years ago when the war began.
   World War II began with the battleship's opening salvo on
Westerplatte, a Polish outpost in then pro-German Free City of
Danzig, at 4:45 a.m. on Sept. 1, 1939.
   Isolated from the rest of Poland, the stubborn resistance of the
182 Polish soldiers on Westerplatte served as an inspiration for
Poles who continued the battle against Hitler until the march into
Berlin nearly six years later.
   Jaruzelski and Mazowiecki returned to Warsaw after the ceremony,
while Walesa attended a Solidarity Mass celebrated by Gdansk Bishop
Tadeusz Goclowski in a wooded glade nearby.
   Earlier, Walesa, Mazowiecki and Senate Speaker Andrzej
Stelmachowski _ another Solidarity activist _ visited the workers'
monument erected by the union in 1980 in front of the Lenin
Shipyard, where it was born.
   Mazowiecki laid red and white flowers at the towering columns
dedicated to workers killed during riots along the Baltic coast in
1970.
   The Solidarity leaders then bowed to the crowd and Walesa led the
singing of the Polish national anthem.
   Stelmachowski, viewing the former political prisoners celebrating
their victories against Communist control, said: ``I still have an
impression that I am playing a strange part in a very strange
theater.''
