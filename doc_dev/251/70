   A large area in the wooded
mountains of northern Yugoslavia was a ``forbidden zone'' for 40
years. With the erosion of communist power, the people finally are
learning why.
   An underground warren was built in the mountains to protect the
Communist Party elite of the Slovenian republic from any disaster,
ranging from nuclear war to insurrection.
   Thousands of political prisoners are said to have built the
shelter in the heart of a heavily guarded 56-square-mile area 40
miles south of Ljubljana, capital of Slovenia.
   On a tour organized by Slovenia's new non-communist government,
journalists were taken through police roadblocks to a mountain that
has been transformed into a well-concealed maze of tunnels,
galleries and shafts.
   Igor Bavcar, the Slovenian interior minister, said the
government in Ljubljana has been told similar shelters were built
by the other five republics. He expressed confidence that, as
democracy spreads, ``the veil of secrecy will be lifted from all of
them.''
   The 3,000-square-yard facility in Slovenia ``could accommodate
at least 100 people, and if the need arose, probably several
hundred more,'' said Marko Kadunc, an engineer employed there since
1961. He said stocks of fuel, food and water were sufficient for
several months.
   Slovenia and Croatia, the westernmost of Yugoslavia's republics,
are ruled by center-right parties that defeated reform Communists
in the first multiparty elections since World War II.
   All the other republics except the largest, Serbia, have
scheduled multiparty elections and free federal elections are
expected in the fall.
   Soon after taking office, Slovenia's new government formed a
commission to investigate the guarded zone and determine whether
political prisoners helped build it.
   Well-lighted corridors wind through the mountain past dozens of
bedrooms, a kitchen and conference rooms. There are a small
infirmary and a fully equipped operating room.
   Small, oval steel doors like submarine hatches subdivide the
underground area, and entry is through a decontamination room.
``This place was designed to survive a nuclear war,'' said Kadunc,
the engineer.
   The complex was finished in the mid-1960s, used for occasional
training exercises and gradually mothballed after 1978. More than
400 employees remained, to maintain the shelter and run a large
cattle farm and logging operation inside the restricted zone.
   An intelligence report published June 20 by the daily Borba in
Belgrade said German prisoners of war started the work on the
shelter, and Yugoslav prisoners took over after the POWs were freed
in the early 1950s.
   Political prisoners and captured officers of various armed
groups that fought the communists in World War II blasted the
tunnels in the mountain, the report said.
   The zone is just a few miles from Kocevski Rog, a mountain where
up to 15,000 anti-communist fighters who surrendered were executed
when the war ended in 1945.
   Anyone who worked on the shelter got a 20-year prison sentence
and was ``earmarked for gradual liquidation in order to safeguard
the secrecy of the forbidden zone,'' said the intelligence report,
which was confidential until Borba published it.
   Kadunc said no political prisoners had worked at the site since
he started there in 1961, and he had not heard of any being used
before that.
   ``Only free Slovenian workers with a good moral profile worked
here,'' he said.
   Slovenian government officials said the zone would not be opened
to the public before the end of 1990, to allow time for removal of
stored ammunition and other explosives.
