   More than 5,000 Poles paid homage to the
heroes of the Jewish Ghetto Uprising at an unsanctioned rally
Sunday, then retraced the route of condemned Jews to the
deportation site for the Nazi death camps.
   In a tribute under bright sunlight in front of the Monument to
the Heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto, the 1943 uprising's last commander
in Poland, Marek Edelman, and leaders of the banned trade union
Solidarity spoke of the tragedy of the Holocaust.
   ``We bend our heads in homage to the courage and dignity (of the
fighters), and at the same time to all those who were dying of
starvation, from bullets, in flames. To all victims,'' said
Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz, reading a letter to the
crowd from union chairman Lech Walesa.
   Authorities had told the citizens' committee organizing the
ceremony that it would be illegal.
   But police did not interfere either during the speeches and
wreath-laying at the monument or as the banner-carrying throng made
its way to the old deportation site at Umschlagplatz, about a
half-mile away.
   Earlier, thousands of people, including U.S. labor leader Albert
Shanker, packed the city's Jewish cemetery to honor two Jewish
socialists executed by the Soviet Union in 1943.
   Across town in the Parliament building, the Yad Vashem Institute
of Jerusalem honored more than 100 Poles for their efforts to
rescue Jews during World War II.
   The ceremonies were part of unofficial observances sponsored by
Polish intellectuals and opposition activists to mark the 45th
anniversary of the uprising. More than 4,500 people from around the
world have come to Poland for the weeklong observances.
   Edelman dedicated a monument to executed socialist Jewish Bund
leaders Henryk Erlich and Viktor Alter, who were ordered put to
death by Stalin in 1943.
   ``It's better now than never and so I'm happy, but I am also
bitter that it's taking place only now,'' said Erlich's
daughter-in-law, Iza Erlich of New Haven, Conn., who traveled to
the ceremony with her sons Mark and Henry.
   The ceremony brought together a cross-section of the Polish
opposition movement and linked it historically to the political
activism of earlier generations.
   Represented were Solidarity, the outlawed Polish Socialist
Party, the Independent Student Association and the conservative
opposition group Confederation of Independent Poland.
   Edelman, 64, had been a leader of the Bund party's youth
movement. He led a unit of Bund fighters in the uprising, in which
several hundred Jewish insurgents staged a three-week struggle
against the final Nazi onslaught against the ghetto in April 1943.
   News of the execution of Erlich and Alter in the Soviet Union
reached the outside world a few months before the uprising.
   They had been deported to the Soviet Union after the Red Army
occupied eastern Poland in September 1939, a few weeks after the
Nazis had invaded from the West. At the time, the Soviets and Nazis
had entered into their non-aggression pact that led to the division
of Poland between them.
   Edelman said the two men, members of the Warsaw municipal
council, were executed for signing an official protest against the
Soviet occupation.
   Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said
he was representing Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO.
   He drew repeated applause when he likened the Bundist leaders'
struggle to that of Solidarity, which was declared illegal after
the government's martial law crackdown in 1981.
   At Parliament, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon and
officials of the Polish veterans' association were present as 96
medals and certificates were presented to more than 100 Poles for
rescuing Jews during World War II.
   The silver medal for ``Righteous Among Nations in the World''
bears an inscription from the Talmud in Hebrew and French: ``He who
saves one life also saves the world.''
   Felix Zandman, 60, of Philadelphia had an emotional reunion with
the children of three Polish sisters whose family hid him in a hole
with four other Jews for 18 months in 1943-44.
   Gen. Jozef Kaminski, a leader of the Polish veterans'
association Zbowid, told the assembly that more than 3 million
Polish Jews were killed, and he praised those Poles who came to the
aid of their Jewish countrymen.
