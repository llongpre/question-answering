   Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the Roman Catholic
primate of Poland, said Tuesday the Carmelite convent near Auschwitz
may be moved, but he complained that Jewish protests had ``touched
the dignity'' of the nuns.
   Glemp said he had not seen a Vatican announcement Tuesday saying
the convent should be moved away from the former Nazi death camp and
that the Vatican would help pay to build a new prayer center outside
Auschwitz in Poland.
   But when reporters described the announcement, he said it sounded
like a ``forceful resolution of the problem, and I don't think that
would be a very positive way.'' He said that by ``forceful'' he
meant ``an administrative enforcement of the transfer of the
sisters, not their own expressed wish.''
   Glemp, who was on a 24-hour visit to consecrate a Polish church
in this southwestern city, said that building a prayer center away
from the Nazi death camp would be a ``great step, we hope, in order
to solve this problem.''
   ``I do think there is a possibility that the nuns could be moved
elsewhere,'' added Glemp. ``But if they were to be moved this should
be done with charity because ... that would be also crossing out
their rights.''
   Glemp's remarks were in line with recent hints he has softened
his position on the convent, which many Jews regard as an offensive
intrusion.
   At least 2.5 million Jews were among the 4 million people
murdered by the Nazis at the World War II death camp.
   The nuns were supposed to move to a prayer center away from the
camp by Feb. 22 under a 1987 agreement between four European
cardinals and an international Jewish delegation.
   But the Catholic Church in Poland balked at honoring the accord
and the deadline passed with no sign of a center or any move to
relocate the nuns.
   The cardinal, at the center of the dispute which has split the
Catholic Church and revived charges of deep-rooted anti-Semitism in
Poland, spent most of a 40-minute news conference defending his
position.
   Glemp had canceled plans to travel from Britain to the United
States because of threats of Jewish protests.
   ``The great Jewish protests which developed around the problem of
the Carmelite nuns in Auschwitz were very sad because they touched
the dignity ... of the women who devote their lives to God,'' said
Glemp. He spoke in Polish, and his remarks were translated into
English by a fellow priest.
   Glemp discussed plans for the prayer center last week with
Zygmunt Nissenbaum, a German-Jewish financier who runs a
philanthropic trust that restores Jewish memorials and who has
offered assistance. Previously, he said, the prayer center was just
``wishful thinking.''
   He did not say when construction might start, nor did he say
explicitly that the nuns would move once the building was complete.
   During the news conference, Glemp called repeatedly for
Catholic-Jewish dialogue over the convent dispute.
   He also acknowledged there was anti-Semitism in Poland, but he
said Poles could not accept that Auschwitz was a purely Jewish
memorial, because many Christians also died there.
   During the summer, Glemp suggested repeatedly he wanted the
convent, established in 1984, to remain and called the accord
offensive.
   Cardinals in the United States, France and Belgium have said the
church should honor the 1987 agreement.
   The controversy grew after seven Jewish protesters, led by a New
York rabbi, tried to climb a fence surrounding the convent and were
forced back by Polish workers in July.
   In remarks that increased Jewish anger, Glemp suggested afterward
that the protesters meant to attack the nuns and said that Jews had
the media ``easily at your disposal in many countries.''
