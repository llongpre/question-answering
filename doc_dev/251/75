  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
instructed his aides Tuesday to consider having the Hiroshima 
atomic bomb dome placed on a UN list of world heritage sites. 
  Hata told an informal cabinet meeting he supports 
registration of the building and directed Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai and other officials to look into the 
matter, officials said. 
  "Nuclear weapons are a tragic thing and Japan ought to be 
telling the people of the world that it is the only country to 
have suffered an atomic bombing," Hata told reporters after the 
meeting. 
  The move followed a proposal at the meeting by Koshiro 
Ishida, director general of the Management and Coordination 
Agency, that the dome should become a heritage site to mark next 
year's 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. 
  Ishida told a news conference the listing of the dome 
deserves consideration because the Nazi-built World War II 
Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland is also on the UN list. 
Poland placed it on the list in 1979. 
  Several million people, many of them Jews, were killed in 
the 
concentration camps. 
  Supporters of the bid to have the dome registered have 
argued 
that it is comparable in significance to the Auschwitz camp 
since it is a symbol of the suffering caused by the war and a 
reminder of the dangers of nuclear warfare. 
  "Japan is the only country to have suffered an atomic 
bombing 
and has an obligation to signal peace to the world," Ishida said. 
  Japan joined the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) convention concerning the protection of 
the world cultural and natural heritage in June 1992, 20 years 
after its creation. 
  The dome, a symbol of the nuclear attack on the city in the 
closing days of World War II, is part of the former Hiroshima 
Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall designed by Czechoslovak 
architect Jan Letzel. 
  The ferroconcrete building was some 160 meters below the 
point at which the atomic bomb exploded on Aug. 6, 1945. 
  The World Heritage Program, begun in 1978, aims to protect 
sites and landmarks of outstanding universal significance. 
  The UNESCO list of more than 360 sites throughout the world 
includes the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the Taj Mahal in 
India, Chartres Cathedral in France, and Serengeti National Park 
in Tanzania. 
  The four sites Japan has listed include Yakushima, an island 
dotted with Japanese cedars off the southernmost main island of 
Kyushu, the Shirakami mountain region with its beech trees 
straddling Aomori and Akita Prefectures in northern Japan, the 
seventh-century Horyuji temple in Nara Prefecture and the 17th 
century Himeji Castle in Hyogo Prefecture, both western Japan. 
  The Hiroshima city assembly and Rengo Hiroshima, an 
organization comprising a number of local groups, have backed a 
campaign to persuade Diet members to register the dome. 
  But to qualify for placing by the government on the UNESCO 
list, sites in Japan must be designated under the Cultural 
Properties Law. 
  The Agency for Cultural Affairs, which administers the law, 
normally only registers sites from before the postfeudal Meiji 
era, which began in 1868. 
  Any decision to register the dome would have to be made in 
time for a UNESCO-sponsored international meeting in December at 
which site nominations are assessed.
