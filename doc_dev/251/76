<LEADPARA>  How many more Kurds and Iraqis must be sacrificed on the altar of
non-intervention?;    After sending 500,000 men and women halfway round the
world and bombing Iraq to kingdom come, we have decided to stand aside and let
Saddam Hussein's Republican Guards fight it out with rebellious Kurds and
Shiite Muslims. As we look on, tens of thousands of Iraqis are being
slaughtered by the most brutal and savage regime in the Middle East. We came
to save Kuwait but, as in Vietnam, our intercession has only brought about the
death of innocents.;    Long after the ubiquitous American flags are furled
and the yellow ribbons are put away with other keepsakes, the U.S.
intervention in the Persian Gulf will be remembered for its betrayal of a
people who rose up to overthrow a vicious dictator. And what did it get them,
these Iraqis and Kurds who heeded our advice to rebel? Annihilation.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     -- Bennett Karmin; San Jose; (hbox); The Persian Gulf War from the start
has been described as more analogous to World War II than to Vietnam, and with
good reason. So, why then has the situation been left in the mess that it is?;
   All this talk about not interfering in the internal matters of nations is
malarkey. Did we stop at the pre-World War II German borders in 1945? If we
had, how many more Jews would have died in concentration camps? Why was that
not an "internal matter"? How many Kurds or other Iraqis will we allow Saddam
to kill or force to flee their country?;    We got part of the equation right,
Kuwait has indeed been liberated (unlike Poland and the other Eastern European
nations at the end of World War II). But we left the matter unfinished. If we
were willing to bomb the entire country of Iraq and occupy (still) about
one-fifth of its territory, what internal matter haven't we interfered with?; 
  And since when is President Bush such a believer in non-interference anyway?
Did we not go into Panama after Noriega thwarted the free election process
there? His crimes, while not defensible in any way, seem to pale in comparison
to Saddam's. So how is it that it was morally correct for us to oust Noriega
and not Saddam?;    It seems that the new world order is shaping up along the
same lines of selective morality as the old world order. We have already
experienced President Bush's lip service on domestic issues; now the rest of
the world is getting a taste of his empty rhetoric.;    -- Jim Champagne;
Sunnyvale; (hbox);    Now that the gulf war cease-fire has taken effect, the
fact that our nation was divided over the war is irrelevant. Rather than
regret what was not done, look to the future and wonder what we, the American
people, can do to help the refugees of Iraq who have been made victims, once
by Allied bombs and a thousand times by Saddam Hussein.;    I think that since
we mobilized ourselves to send gift packages to soldiers who were strangers to
us, soldiers who came from the most affluent nation in the world to start
with, we might tap that spring of energy and charity again and find a way to
help these people who answered George Bush's call to rebellion, who lost, and
who now find they prefer even the cruel tyranny of hunger and cold to that of
Saddam.;    I want to help. But I can't send medicine, clean water or
sanitation equipment; I don't know how to send food, blankets, or tents. This
is my call to international organizations: Tell us what you need. Tell us
where to send it. I'm ready and waiting.;    -- Patricia Oren; Sunnyvale  </TEXT>
