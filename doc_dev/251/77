<LEADPARA>  After World War II, Gen. Hideki Tojo wrote defiantly that Americans'
bitterness about his government's attack on Pearl Harbor was based on a tragic
misunderstanding.;    In his writings in a Tokyo prison after his arrest as a
war criminal, Japan's wartime prime minister said Tokyo had followed
international law by declaring war before dropping the first bomb on the U.S.
military base in Hawaii.  </LEADPARA>

JAPAN DECLARED WAR FIRST, HIS NOTES ARGUE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     He said the United States misinterpreted a statement that Japan meant to be
a declaration of war.;    His prison writings, published for the first time,
appear in the current issue of the monthly magazine Hoseki. Tojo was convicted
by the Allies of war crimes and hanged in 1948.;    The excerpts show a man
angered at the charge that Japan had started the war in violation of
international law.;    "The economic pressure imposed by the United States,
the British government and others was an inhuman act," he wrote from Sugamo
Prison. "For Japan, doing nothing would have meant the destruction of the
nation. We had to stand up and defend ourselves.";    The United States and
its allies imposed economic sanctions against Japan after the outbreak of the
Chinese-Japanese war in 1937 in an effort to block Tokyo's expansion.;   
According to the official U.S. account, Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor on
Dec. 7, 1941, before Japan formally served the U.S. government with a
declaration of war.;    In his prison writings, Tojo said a note handed to
Secretary of State Cordell Hull in Washington on the day of the attack was
meant as a declaration of war.;    U.S. historians have said the note in
question was considered by Washington to be more of an ultimatum than a formal
declaration of war.;    In any case, U.S. historians say Japanese diplomats
had been instructed to deliver the note to Hull only a half-hour before the
start of the attack on Pearl Harbor. In fact, the Japanese were delayed and
did not deliver the note until about an hour after the bombs started falling.  </TEXT>
