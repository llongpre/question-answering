There was a fairly interesting editorial in the London Sunday Telegraph last
week on the subject of crime and punishment, an Anglo-Saxon obsession these
days. Its main thrust, if I understood it, was that in western societies the
(criminal) enemy at home resembled the enemy abroad of past times, that is
to say Germany. And enemies have to be severely punished, not understood.
That was aimed at Tony Blair, the leader of the Labour Party, who once said
he would be 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime'.
The Telegraph said the background to criminal behaviour should be a
secondary matter of concern and concluded with a reference to 1914:
'Germany's illegalities then, as again in 1939, were defeated by force, not
by inquiring into their causes.'
This argument suggests bizarre conclusions and on this day, the 55th
anniversary of the outbreak of the second world war, it is worth seeing what
they are. Let us start with the Great War, which Le Monde celebrated all
last month with a series of illuminating studies of lesser known aspects of
that event. One of the last pieces was headlined, 'The army distressed by a
beaten and shocked Germany.'
It dealt with the reception given to the armies of the Kaiser on their
return to the Fatherland in November 1918. The army believed it had not been
beaten. The last message of the commander, Field Marshall Hindenburg, ran:
'Thanks to victorious attacks as well as determined defence we have been
able to keep the enemy far from our borders. We have saved our country from
terror and destruction.'
The population disagreed and greeted the solders with hostility, which Le
Monde called la fete refusee. The troops believed they had been sold out by
traitors at home. Then came the Treaty of Versailles which, in another
article, Le Monde called, 'The antechamber of the next catastrophe'. At
Versailles, Germany was punished in a manner that would gladden the heart of
a Sunday editorialist. She was found guilty in the dock of world opinion,
lands were lost and huge fines imposed (which were not paid).
To cut a long story short, Hitler played on the myth of the stolen victory
and the stab in the back, launched the second world war and tried to murder
the Jews whom he held responsible.
These 'illegalities' eventually met with a firm response. The anniversaries
of that action now flood the newspapers. But the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung celebrated the anniversary of the liberation of Paris in an unusual
manner. One item started: 'In this year is there no end to the
commemorations of the events of 50 years ago. They will continue until May
1995. Fifty years ago many in Europe experienced horror.
'In Germany it was above all the allied bombardment which the people had
increasingly to suffer. Almost every day towns were the target of heavy
attacks, some places were bombed again and again, for example Kiel with its
harbours and U-Boat depots. Not only were military installations hit by the
allied air fleets, but also, systematically, residential districts. What
happened in one such attack is reflected here in the matter-of-fact words of
the record kept in the war diary of a marine auxiliary on August 26 1944.'
The report was a hair-raising account of nearly six hours of heavy bombing
in which both sides suffered substantial losses. But, having read Le Monde
just a day before, one was struck by a resounding fact: how different things
were in 1945 from 1918. At the end of the second world war no German could
think his country had been spared 'terror and destruction' nor could he
think it had not been defeated. And Germany, as the FAZ implicitly pointed
out, suffered a similar fate to that of its victims in the second war.
One conclusion might be that we must all thank Lord 'Bomber' Harris for half
a century of peace in western Europe. The controversial head of the Royal
Air Force is regarded as a war criminal in some circles in Germany because
it was he who implemented the policy of so-called carpet bombing of German
cities. But one must recognise that Germany, where memories of the raids are
as vivid as ever, has presented no threat to anybody for the first time in
100 years. And still does not today.
That looks likes one up to the Sunday Telegraph. Yet there is another side
to the story. After the second world war there was no Versailles. Germany,
at least the western bit, was given a shiny new constitution and pots of
money. No huge fines, no isolation from the community of nations, instead a
willingness on the part of the victors to learn from their past mistakes.
If there is a lesson in terms of domestic law enforcement in all this, which
is doubtful, then it is a peculiar one. The police should be extravagantly
violent in their pursuit of the criminal, but the judicial agencies must
exercise extreme leniency in the imposition of penalties. In other words, in
English terms, the accused should be beaten up in the remand cell before the
trial and given an unconditional discharge after it.
