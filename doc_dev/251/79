   In a war few outside Poland recall,
soldiers of the newborn Polish republic 70 years ago this week
retaliated in a battle that saved Warsaw from Bolshevik conquest
and the wrath of the Red Army.
   Until last year, the Polish-Soviet war of 1919-20 was rarely
discussed by Poland's former Communist authorities because they
correctly gauged local sensitivities about the ``Miracle of the
Vistula.''
   But five days of observances about the battle that began Aug.
13, 1920, were organized in villages across Poland for the first
anniversary observance since the end of Communist rule.
   The ``Miracle on the Vistula'' has been recalled in churches and
cemeteries throughout Poland since Sunday, and memorials destroyed
or removed during the reign of the Communists have been carefully
restored.
   ``Many historians put this battle among the dozen most important
military acts,'' Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said during a
Royal Castle ceremony Tuesday night honoring veterans of the battle.
   ``If not for the Polish determination, if not for our sacrifice
and our victory, the history of Europe would have been much
different,'' he told the elderly survivors.
   Ceremonies on Wednesday at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in
Warsaw and Thursday at the Krakow tomb of Marshal Jozef Pilsudski,
the champion of Polish independence who led the military campaign,
were to conclude observances that had captured Poland's emotions
all week.
   With central Europe in collapse after World War I and the German
working-class excited by Bolshevism's triumph in Russia, Soviet
leader Vladimir Lenin dreamed of conquering Poland, which would put
the Red Army in mid-Europe and spread the socialist revolution
across Europe.
   In the summer of 1920, five of the feared Soviet armies
converged on Warsaw.
   ``To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to
worldwide conflagration,'' Soviet Gen. Mikhail Tukachevsky
instructed his troops before the battle, according to British
historian Norman Davies.
   ``White'' was Lenin's pejorative description meaning
counterrevolutionary enemies of the working-class. The czarist army
opposing the Bolsheviks dressed in white.
   Barbed-wire defenses hurriedly errected by Warsaw's residents
held, and in a series of daring maneuvers Poles managed to encircle
the Soviets. In days, 100,000 Red Army troops were taken prisoner
and the rest fled to East Prussia. East Prussia is former German
territory now belonging to Poland and the Soviet Union.
   In Poland, the unexpected triumph came to be called ``The
Miracle on the Vistula'' for the river that passes through Warsaw.
   ``Had (Polish soldiers) failed to arrest the triumphant advance
of the Soviet Army at the Battle of Warsaw, not only would
Christianity have experienced a dangerous reverse, but the very
existence of Western civilization would have been imperiled,''
wrote the then-British ambassador to Berlin, Lord D'Abernon,
according to Davies.
   The attention focused on Poland's heroic effort continues today,
Mazowiecki said. Thousands of people of all ages have been jamming
memorial Masses this week, decorating their villages with ribbons
in honor of the battle.
   ``The world is paying great attention to our experiences now
because it knows our process of freeing ourselves from communism
has critical importance for the world,'' Mazowiecki said.
   Polish primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp told worshippers that the
battle ``is still going on,'' referring to the trials of building a
democratic society after four decades of one-party rule.
   Glemp started the commemoration Sunday at a country church in
Radzymin, outside Warsaw near a battlefield where a rebuilt
cemetery chapel now honors the fallen soldiers.
   Among those attending was Col. Stanislaw Lis-Kozlowski, 84, a
teen-age volunteer from the Polish boy scouts who shouldered a
rifle against the Bolsheviks in 1920.
   Lis-Kozlowski, who came from his home in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, stood outside the church, his suit covered with medals
that recalled his service with the anti-Nazi resistance in World
War II and the doomed 1944 Warsaw uprising.
   He scoffed when a reporter suggested that as a 14-year-old he
was too young to fight. ``In the uprising in '44, I had soldiers 12
years old,'' Lis-Kozlowski said.
   For the Soviets, 1920 proved a temporary defeat. Stalin's troops
occupied more than half of Poland in 1939. After World War II,
Communists took power and ruled until 1989, when the Solidarity
movement wrested power from the party and installed a non-Communist
government.
   Many of the ``Miracle on the Vistula'' fighters perished among
the 15,000 captured Polish army officers executed by the Soviets at
Katyn and two other sites in 1940. In Poland, the crime often is
viewed as Stalin's revenge for 1920.
