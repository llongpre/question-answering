   Hiroshima halted for a moment of silence
early Sunday to mark the 44th anniversary of the first atom bomb
attack and to appeal for peace.
   As a single bell wailed and more than 1,000 doves were released
into the skies, 50,000 people gathered in Hiroshima's Peace
Memorial Park to mark the moment a U.S. B-29 bomber carried out the
world's first atomic attack.
   At 8:15 a.m., the precise moment when the bomb exploded in a
flash of blinding light on August 6, 1945, Hiroshima citizens,
Japanese government officials and visitors from throughout the
world bowed their heads in silent prayer while buses and streetcars
stood still throughout the city of 1 million.
   The heat, blast and radiation reduced to rubble and ashes a
large portion of the western city, a major military center during
World War II. About 140,000 people perished in the firestorm that
engulfed the city.
   ``Our country, as the sole nation to have suffered an atomic
attack, is determined that the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
should never be repeated,'' Prime Minister Sousuke Uno told the
crowd, many of whom were dressed in black under a sweltering sun.
   ``We strongly feel the duty to use Hiroshima to sound an alarm
bell for the future of all humanity. From now on, Japan must carry
out more aggressive diplomacy for peace and security in the
world,'' said Uno, who has announced he will resign the premiership.
   A group of visiting mayors, including Anne Rudin of Sacramento,
Calif., presented a large wreath of yellow chrysanthemums, the
traditonal mourning flower, to the victims of the bombing at their
official monument, a granite cenotaph in the center of the park.
   ``In my city we are learning that our strength as a nation does
not depend on military might but on economic strength,'' Rudin said
after the ceremony. ``A nation's greatness is not measured by the
evil it threatens but by the good it does.''
   Outside the ceremony, hundreds of boy scouts handed visitors
fresh flowers while protesters handed out leaflets criticizing
alleged government laxity in preventing U.S. warships from bringing
nuclear weapons into the country contrary to government policy.
   Korean residents of Japan distributed pamphlets demanding the
government apologize for its aggression against fellow Asians in
World War II and other conflicts.
   At the memorial service, 4,244 names of those exposed to the
bomb who died in the last year were added to the names enshrined on
a tablet in the cenotaph.
   Although it is difficult to determine which deaths are directly
related to the bomb, researchers believe the risk of death from
leukemia, and lung, breast and bone cancer is greater for those
exposed to the bomb than for those who were not.
   Three days after Hiroshima, the United States dropped a second
atom bomb on the coastal city of Nagasaki, killing another 70,000
civilians. Japan surrendered unconditionally on Aug. 15, 1945,
ending the war.
