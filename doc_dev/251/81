<LEADPARA>  'YOU KNOW who I feel sorry for?" quipped Dennis Miller, Saturday Night Live's
comedic "news" anchorman. "It's the one retired Army colonel who didn't get a
job as a TV analyst this week.";    Miller may not have been joking.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Alongside the parade of retired military brass, network TV's extensive
coverage of the gulf war has featured a narrow and monotonous procession of
analysts: patriarchs of the "defense establishment" like Henry Kissinger and
Al Haig, think-tank scholars of a generally conservative bent, hawkish pundits
and politicians and -- for supposed balance -- Democratic Party leaders
rallying around the president.;    With news from the war front arriving in
bits, network anchors have filled time by rounding up and interviewing "all
the usual suspects" from the political-military elite. Critics of the war are
seen on TV but not at the table where the experts sit. Coverage of war
opponents is more akin to nature footage: Critics are shown only in street
action, their apparent "natural habitat.";    Unlike the many newspapers that
offer dissenting views on the Op-Ed page, network TV has been so one-sided at
times that boosterism for war has drowned out independent reporting. The first
casualty of war has been even the pretense of journalistic balance. And this
has been television's war, with audiences of record-breaking size.;    The
networks seem bent on marginalizing dissent. A reinvigorated peace movement
exploded in opposition to Bush's gulf policy back in August, but one would
never have known that from the three major networks. In the first five months
of the crisis, only 1 percent of gulf coverage on the nightly news touched on
opposition activity. Foreign policy experts associated with the peace movement
never once appeared on any of the nightly news shows.;    Given this
undercoverage, perhaps it's no wonder that ABC's Cokie Roberts reacted to the
militant demonstrations on Day One of the war by noting that the "peace
movement has instantly sprung up.";    Hours before the war started, a CNN
correspondent concluded his report on Atlanta's Martin Luther King
commemoration which turned into an impassioned protest against Bush's gulf
policy: "Anti-war sentiment in Atlanta is more fervent than anyone knew." CNN
is headquartered in Atlanta. Why didn't it know?;    Today, no one can argue
that TV has not noticed the anti-war movement, but coverage is usually just a
blur of street action -- from big marches to sit-ins to fringe flag-burners.
Still missing from the news are substantive interviews with national peace
leaders or experts sympathetic to the movement.;    The exclusion of critics
from TV's list of war analysts leads to bias in network presentations. Obvious
questions are not even raised. From McLaughlin Group shouters to George Will
to the colonels, the consensus on TV is high praise for Reagan's high-tech
arms buildup "now proving itself in the gulf." No one has been impolite enough
to ask about Reagan's role in building up the strength of the enemy, Saddam
Hussein.;    While TV anchors and their analysts marveled at the massive
aerial bombardment of Baghdad, with its "precision" targeting, "smart bombs,"
and cruise missiles turning left at Main Street to find the Defense Ministry,
few raised the unpleasant issue of Iraqi civilian casualties. As soon as Scud
missiles hit Israel, TV focused heavily -- and quite correctly -- on the
terror suffered by innocent civilians. Yet a week into the bombing of Iraq,
U.S. television and its experts had hardly considered the terror inflicted on
Iraqi civilians.;    On Jan. 15, our country was evenly divided about starting
war with Iraq. Given the network TV onslaught in support of the war effort,
and the natural tendency of the public to rally around the president at the
outbreak of war, it's significant and newsworthy that such a solid minority
still strongly opposes the war.;    Network TV needs to wake up to the fact
that the debate going on in the country is far broader than the one going on
in Washington. On the eve of the war, polls showed most Americans favoring an
international peace conference and a Kuwait/Iraq border compromise as ways of
negotiating Iraq out of Kuwait without a war. Several days into the war, 42
percent of the public favored peace talks. But such views were rarely heard on
network TV.;    The networks can take a simple step to bring balance and
perspective to their war coverage: open up their analysis booth to critical
and dissenting experts. Peace advocates are capable of expressing themselves
in more than just slogans, chants and sound bites.;    In wartime, governments
engage in censorship. An independent press should not.  </TEXT>
