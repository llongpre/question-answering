<LEADPARA>  As pastor of a vibrant, predominantly black Baptist congregation in a mean
part of San Jose, Frank Selkirk has persuaded more than 15 young black men to
join the armed forces over the years to get them off the streets.;    But now
those young men are in the Persian Gulf -- and Pastor Selkirk, his heart heavy
with anger toward world leaders and his head pounding with responsibility for
the young lives -- was pleading Sunday with all the passion of his faith.;   
"I say to you Mr. Bush, you are in trouble," Selkirk said in his sermon at
Antioch Baptist Church on Sunday to a chorus of approval. "I say to you today,
either you hear what the world and the nation is saying to you, or one day you
will fall to your knees."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Selkirk wasn't the only religious leader speaking strong words this
weekend. Across the Bay Area, ministers, rabbis, priests and Muslim prayer
leaders urged world leaders to find a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis.;  
 Outside church and synagogue and mosque walls, attempts to avoid war were the
focus of demonstrations and marches around the Bay Area.;    In Santa Cruz,
more than 4,000 people marched from the University of California campus to the
center of town, chanting slogans and carrying signs. More than 40 local groups
sponsored the event.;    "Don't stay home and watch it on the news" if war
starts, speaker Terry Teitlebaum told the Santa Cruz gathering. "Hit the
streets and make the news.";    The protest was peaceful except for a brief
scuffle between an unidentified motorist and several demonstrators after
witnesses said he drove through the middle of the march. There were no
arrests.;    San Jose protest;  In downtown San Jose, more than 150 people
joined a demonstration organized by a group called Women Opposed to War, for
whom the marches have become a weekly event every Sunday night since Dec. 8.; 
  "We got the idea from the people of Germany, who brought down the (Berlin)
wall by coming out every Monday night," said Susan Fogel, a member of the
group. "We believe that the people of the United States are opposed to this
war, and if everyone would come out, we'd have critical mass. The cowardly
Congress would enact the will of the people.";    But while protesters were
unified in their opposition to war and religious leaders were unified in their
prayers for peace, religious groups differed on the reasons for their
prayers.;    "Everybody during times of war is concerned about self," said
Rabbi Jonathan Plaut of Temple Emanu-el in San Jose. "But it's difficult not
to be concerned about our own. Blacks are concerned about blacks in the
military, Latinos are concerned about their numbers in the armed forces, and
Jews are concerned about what effect this has on their life in America . . .
and in Israel.";    Many area religious leaders also said they feel helpless.;
   'Out of our hands';  "I think what people feel essentially is that events
are out of our hands. We fear the worst and hope for the best," said Rabbi
Richard Block of Congregation Beth-Am in Los Altos.;    Muslim leaders in the
Bay Area are praying as fervently for peace as anyone else these days, said
Dr. Khalid Siddiqi of the South Bay Islamic Center in San Jose. But Siddiqi
said he and most other Muslims feel the United States has no business
involving itself in a conflict between two Arab Muslim nations.;    "You may
have heard people refer to this as a jihad, as some kind of holy war," Siddiqi
said. "There is no holiness in this war according to the holy Koran. No true
Muslim anywhere in the world will agree with the invasion of Kuwait.";    At
St. Aloysius Catholic Church, in Palo Alto, Father Eugene Boyle said more time
is needed to determine the consequences of war.;    "There should be no rush
to judgment on the fateful question of turning from sustained political and
economic  pressure on Saddam Hussein to deciding there is no road left but
war," he said.;    But not all religious leaders spoke this weekend against
the prospect of war. At the evangelical Los Gatos Christian Church, Pastor
Daniel Henderson told his congregation to pray for peace but to support
President Bush regardless of what action he takes.;    'Supportive of our
president';  "We are very supportive of our president and of our leaders, and
we understand the Bible tells us to be that way," Henderson said. "We
understand that sometimes the only thing to do is to use force.";    Despite
their political differences, the religious leaders of the Bay Area all did one
thing this weekend. They asked their congregations to pray for an answer to a
seemingly intractable problem.;    "I hope that somehow there's a miracle that
can be found that will resolve the crisis," said Rabbi Plaut. "It's like the
mythical sword of Damocles. That double-bladed sword is hanging over us, and
we don't know what's better: to face the danger now or to try and face it in
the future."  </TEXT>
