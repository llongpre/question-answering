<LEADPARA>  It was called the "war of the cities.";    In the spring of 1988, Saddam
Hussein lofted about four Scud missiles a day into Tehran, Iran. They never
carried chemical weapons. They caused little physical damage. But they
terrorized the population, causing 40 percent of Tehran's people to flee to
refugee camps outside town -- and helping force Iran to ask for a cease-fire
in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.  </LEADPARA>

SHRIEKING MISSILES PANICKED IRANIANS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Analysts familiar with Iraq's use of Scuds said the civilian populations in
Saudi Arabia and Israel may be less likely to panic because of their air
defenses and the expectation that the war will not drag on for years.;    The
Scud attacks against Iran came when the population had been subjected to
warfare for eight years.;    "It affected our morale terribly," an Iranian
diplomat said of the Scud attacks. "More than the destruction, there was great
psychological impact on our people.";    As the campaign went on, and as
Saddam threatened to arm the rockets with chemical weapons, Tehran's residents
grew more and more nervous. They came to dread, the diplomat said, the sound
the Scuds made close to impact: When overhead, the warhead was separated from
the rocket by a small explosive charge.;    "You hear the sound of the
incoming Scud from a distance. It is a shriek, very similar to the V-2 attacks
on Britain in World War II," said Jan Nolan of the Brookings Institution in
Washington. "They are terror weapons, by objective parameters not as accurate
or powerful as the bombs landing on Iraq, but very damaging psychologically.";
   Like the V-2s, which rained on London in 1944 and 1945, the Scud is a
ballistic missile, shot into trajectory by a rocket engine, which quickly
burns out, leaving the missile to speed to its target. The Soviet-model Scuds,
which were developed in the late 1960s, were modeled on a German World War II
anti-aircraft missile called the Wasserfall, said Steven Zalonga, a missile
expert and consultant in New York City.;    In modifying them to reach Tehran
and Tel Aviv, Iraq has reduced the warhead arom 1,800 to 330 pounds, according
to Seth Carus, a missile expert who said those figures were based on Iranian
estimates.;    While Iraq never used chemical warheads, the mere threat was
enough to spread terror.;    In one case, an Al-Hussein missile -- a Scud with
an extended range -- with a conventional warhead landed on a bakery and spewed
flour in the air, causing a panic because people nearby thought they were
under chemical attack, according to Carus.;    Defense analyst Joseph Bermudez
of Merrick, considered the leading U.S. expert in Iraqi missile strategy, said
it is unclear whether Iraq has the ability to put chemical weapons on the tips
of its Scuds. The Soviets have developed a chemical warhead for the Scud but
it was not provided to Iraq.;    To use chemical warheads, Iraq would have had
to develop a triggering device to explode the chemicals at a low altitude
before impact. Other than delivery by airplane, the longest proven range for
Iraqi chemical weapons delivery is by multiple rocket launcher, which can
reach about 25 miles.;    "If they do have the capacity, Saddam will most
likely use chemicals when the ground war starts," Bermudez said.;    b  </TEXT>
