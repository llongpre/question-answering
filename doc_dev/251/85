</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the Polish tourists glanced a few yards to their left as they emerged 
from the "Block of Death" where special prisoners of Auschwitz once awaited 
execution. There, past the barbed wire and the watchtower, on the other side of 
a 12-foot concrete wall, they could see the upper floors of a recently 
refurbished, four-story brick building and, next to it, the top of a large 
wooden cross. 
</P>
<P>
"That building houses the Carmelite cloister that the church authorities are 
fighting for," said their tour guide. 
</P>
<P>
That remark triggered much angry murmuring among the seemingly passive Poles. 
"This is our country!" grumbled one. "Poles were also murdered here!" a second 
said. "It's not right that they should be protesting!" declared a third. 
</P>
<P>
"They" are the Jews who view a Roman Catholic convent at the site of Nazi 
Germany's most infamous World War II death camp as a religious desecration and 
an assault on the memory of their unique suffering as the target of the most 
brutally systematic attempt at genocide in recorded history. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials in this predominantly Roman Catholic country have unilaterally 
suspended an earlier agreement with world Jewish leaders to move the 
five-year-old convent to a planned interfaith center to be located farther from 
the Auschwitz site. They said they did so because of what they assert were the 
agreement's "unrealistic" terms and "aggressive" actions on the Jewish side. 
</P>
<P>
There were indications over the weekend that some compromise may be in the 
offing to defuse what has proved to be an explosive and acutely embarrassing 
squabble for a Polish nation that is elsewhere basking in Western admiration 
for installing Eastern Europe's first non-Communist government in more than 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But as the comments by the Polish tourists suggest, here at Oswiecim -- as the 
town and camp are called in the Polish language -- it looks as if no matter 
what is finally decided, divisions will remain between the Polish and Jewish 
understanding of each other on the matter of Nazi atrocities inflicted on both 
peoples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Enormous Evil 
</P>
<P>
As enormous as is the evil that Auschwitz represents, it is as if it is still 
not big enough for Poles and Jews to share. 
</P>
<P>
Both peoples see Auschwitz and the adjacent death camp known as Birkenau as 
monuments to unfathomable hatred and cruelty. But for Poles, it is a national 
memorial to extraordinary wartime suffering little appreciated by the outside 
world; a reminder of a conflict that not only laid waste to their country and 
killed millions of its non-Jewish citizens, but which then handed them over to 
the domination of another alien power, the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
To Jews, Auschwitz is a symbol that transcends war and nationhood. It 
represents the culmination of 2,000 years of irrational persecution and 
contempt by a Christian world which accused an entire people of deicide. And 
any action seen as diluting this central theme is considered unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
"The state museum of Oswiecim-Brzezinka is a monument of the martyrdom and 
struggle of the Polish and other nations," according to a sign at the entrance 
to the complex that employs the Polish names for the two camps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Hebrew Version 
</P>
<P>
There is no special mention of the Jews, who numbered at least 2.5 million of 
the 4 million murdered here. And while the sign is translated into several 
languages, including Italian, Danish, German, and Russian, there is no Hebrew 
version. 
</P>
<P>
Through the end of last year, more than 19 million people had visited the 
museum since its opening in 1947. While many of the nearly 4 million foreign 
visitors have been Jewish, the great majority who come here are Polish 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
One of about 200 groups that came this past weekend was on a pilgrimage 
organized by a parish church in the Poznan area. Auschwitz was one of several 
stops on a three-day tour that also included Poland's holiest shrine at 
Czestochowa, the former home of Polish kings at Krakow and the birthplace of 
Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if I'm going through the occupation again," said Lucja Mikula, 67, who 
was here for the first time. "The young people don't know," she added as she 
began to weep. "But we remember it. We lived through it. I worked five years 
(as a forced laborer) for the Germans." 
</P>
<P>
Polska Lucyna, 63, from the same tour group reached behind her neck and also 
started to cry. "The pain, here," she explained as she recalled her arrest 
during the occupation. "I feel they are beating me again." 
</P>
<P>
Several Poles stayed outside while their groups entered Block 11 -- the 
so-called Block of Death. "I can't go in," said Kristin Wielgosz, 52. "I don't 
want to go through the experience." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everybody Should Come' 
</P>
<P>
Andrzej Skowronski, who was a wartime courier in the Polish underground, said 
he has visited Auschwitz many times from his home in Rabka, near Krakow, often 
escorting family and friends from abroad. "I think everybody should come here 
and experience this in his own way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He knew many who died at Auschwitz, Skowronski added -- "Poles. And Jews as 
well." And he sighed audibly when asked about the controversy over the 
Carmelite convent. "I think it's totally unnecessary," he finally said. "My 
personal opinion is that whoever prays here, it won't hurt those who died 
here." He blamed "groups who come here shouting and screaming" for whipping up 
trouble. "It's out of place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rabka man was alluding to a group of American Jews who trespassed on 
convent grounds in mid-July to protest the failure of the Polish church to live 
up to a 1987 agreement meant to resolve the issue. The nuns were supposed to 
have been moved to a new interfaith prayer center by last Feb. 22 under that 
agreement, but so far, no work on such a center has even begun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doused With Water 
</P>
<P>
The protesting Americans were forcibly ejected by Polish workmen who roughed 
them up and doused them with water in an ugly scene captured by television 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow, the Polish cardinal who 
helped negotiate the 1987 accord, said that he was suspending it because of 
"aggressive" demands and protests of Jewish activists. 
</P>
<P>
Then, three weeks ago, the Polish primate, Cardinal Josef Glemp, voiced during 
a sermon what apparently were extemporaneous remarks in which he alluded to 
alleged Jewish control of the media and a Jewish role in spreading communism. 
</P>
<P>
Glemp asserted that anti-Semitism in Poland would disappear if Jews would cease 
anti-Polish remarks and actions. And regarding the convent, he said: "Dear 
Jews, do not talk to us from the position of a nation elevated over all others 
and do not put to us conditions which are impossible to meet." 
</P>
<P>
The primate's remarks angered Jews further and shocked many non-Jewish 
observers as well. A trip he was scheduled to make to the United States later 
this month was canceled because of "circumstances not favorable" for his visit. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who is Polish-born, said that Glemp's 
remarks were indicative of a national anti-Semitism that Poles "suck in with 
their mother's milk." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Our Own Stupidity' 
</P>
<P>
Adam Michnik, a deputy in the Polish Parliament who had earlier condemned 
Glemp's statement, was equally incensed by Shamir's, calling it "absurd" and 
"an offense to all Poles. . . . Let us remember that no hatred -- be it 
anti-Semitism or 'anti-Polandism' -- can be 'sucked in with mother's milk.' 
Hatred is always a product of our own stupidity and immorality." 
</P>
<P>
Glemp met over the weekend with Zygmunt Nissenbaum, the head of a family fund 
that restores Jewish monuments in Poland, and according to the official PAP 
news agency, "a draft of a satisfying solution of the Auschwitz conflict was 
shaped." 
</P>
<P>
According to unconfirmed reports, Nissenbaum will help finance the proposed 
interfaith prayer center, where the convent would be located, a distance away 
from the Auschwitz camp.
