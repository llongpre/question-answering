   President Bush said today there is just ``a
nuance of difference'' with Poland over its demands for a signed
treaty guaranteeing its border before the two Germanys unite.
   Bush, in a news conference shortly after a second round of talks
with Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said the Poles and
Germans ``are very, very close now'' to an understanding that the
current borders must remain intact.
   ``Let them sort it out. It's going very well,'' Bush told
reporters.
   He said again that Poland will have a voice at the two-plus-four
talks on questions affecting its borders, and stressed that those
talks are not ``going to determine the fate of all of Europe.''
   Mazowiecki left the White House saying ``there are no problems
between us'' on Poland's demand for an early treaty with the two
Germanys guaranteeing its borders.
   Bush said he had not gotten any assurances from Mazowiecki that
the new non-communist government in Warsaw will press for
withdrawal of Soviet troops from its territory.
   ``There isn't any need for Soviet troops in Eastern Europe, and
the sooner they get out of there the better,'' said Bush.
   Mazowiecki has said he wants the Soviet troops to stay until the
German question is resolved. The prime minister, speaking with
reporters as he left the White House, said, ``We've stated publicly
we're going to start talks about that that will eventually lead to
total withdrawal'' of the Soviet forces.
   On the so-called two-plus-four talks on German unification
involving the two Germanys and the four Allied victors from World
War II, Bush said, if the talks involve Polish issues, ``Poland
should be there. Poland should be involved.''
   ``We don't see this as the group that is going to determine the
fate of all of Europe. ... But if two-plus-four starts talking
about Polish borders, for example, clearly the Poles should be
involved,'' the president said.
   Mazowiecki said he was ``very pleased'' with his talks with Bush.
   ``There are no problems between us'' on Poland's demand for an
early, swift treaty with the two Germanys guaranteeing its borders,
the prime minister said.
   ``The only problem is to persuade both our German partners that
it needs to be done swiftly and finally,'' said Mazowiecki, who
wants a guarantee in writing that a united Germany will not seek to
reclaim territories ceded to Poland after World War II.
   Asked if he and Bush had solved disagreements over how large a
role Poland should have in the talks, Mazowiecki replied, ``It is
well known that we will participate in the conference and we will
take part in everything that will affect and concern ourselves.''
   Poland has been assured a seat at the table when the two
Germanys and the four Allied victors from World War II _ the United
States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ discuss issues
affecting the Polish border.
   Mazowiecki said the Poles want a treaty with the Germanys
``initialed prior to the German unification and finally reaffirmed
after the unification.''
   ``We do not really see any major reason why that should not
happen, because we want that to happen to make sure that the whole
debate would not have to be started all over again afterwards. We
would like to avoid this,'' he said.
   ``We know that after all we're going to live as neighbors with a
unified Germany from now on and we would like to see it as a good
neighborly relationship,'' he said.
   Mazowiecki then left for Capitol Hill and talks with leaders of
both the House and Senate.
   At a state dinner Wednesday night, Mazowiecki pressed his
insistence on a new treaty guaranteeing Poland's border and urged a
new political structure to free Europe of military rivalry.
   Earlier Wednesday Bush sought to assure Mazowiecki of U.S.
support for Poland's demand that its current western border not be
breached when the two Germanys unite.
   Both in private talks and in a poignant toast at the state
dinner, Mazowiecki stressed the issue's importance to Poles now
emerging from ``a long night of totalitarian oppression'' under the
Nazis and then communist rule.
   At the state dinner, Mazowiecki invoked Alexis de Tocqueville's
words about ``the unstoppable march of democracy.''
   ``Nowadays, we're witnessing an enormous acceleration of that
march _ in Nicaragua, Chile, even Mongolia, but most of all in
Eastern and Central Europe,'' he said. ``Democracy is a system
which secures the freedom of the individual, the freedom without
which no normal life is possible.''
   He recalled how Poland was ``ravaged by the Nazi invasion'' in
1939.
   ``Our people suffered more than any other on earth. Poland lost
6 million of its citizens, half of them Polish Jews,'' he said.
   After World War II, he said, ``for the next 45 years we were
forced to live under an alien political system, a totalitarian one,
which was imposed on the whole Eastern and Central Europe. The
Poles never accepted their fate and were the first to challenge
it.''
   Mazowiecki said, ``a need is emerging for a new structure ... to
gradually free Europe of military rivalry and bring the two
separated parts closer together.''
   ``Reconciliation between nations is possible only when they do
not fear either for their present or their future. For this reason,
an important component of the building must be the recognition of
the Polish border along the Oder-Neisse Rivers in the form of a
treaty,'' said the prime minister.
