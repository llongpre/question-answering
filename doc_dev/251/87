   David T. Best's journey to honor a childhood
friend killed 49 years ago at Pearl Harbor ended Friday at the
stark limestone facade of the Indiana World War Memorial.
   Best, 72, traveled from his Hayward, Calif., home to join other
World War II veterans at a service honoring the 2,403 Americans
killed in Japan's assault on the Pacific Fleet.
   Best glanced at a photograph of Paul B. Free, whose life ended
at 20 as he climbed into his airplane on Dec. 7, 1941.
   ``Few things stir man's compassion so deeply as remembering the
supreme sacrifice of an old buddy. Sleep, comrade, sleep in
peace,'' Best said.
   Veterans alternated reading 10 names a minute while tolling a
large, silver bell from the USS Indianapolis one time for each
American who died.
   Similar ceremonies took place elsewhere, including in Hawaii,
where dignitaries boarded the USS Arizona Memorial for wreath
presentations, a 21-gun salute and echo taps. At the Pearl Harbor
Naval Base, a ``missing man'' flyover by Hawaii Air National Guard
jets ended a minute of silence marking the time of the attack.
   Best, a self-described ``loyal, patriotic American who gets
choked up when `The Star-Spangled Banner' plays,'' grew up in
Williamsport, Pa., and returned there in 1988 to unveil a plaque
commemorating Free as the city's first resident killed in World War
II.
   ``We made a pact that he would enlist in the Army Air Corps and
I would try to get aviation experience. Of course, then he was
killed,'' said Best, who later trained B-17 radar bombardiers and
navigators in Florida.
   ``When I got the terse telegram (about Free's death), I was just
a 21-year-old kid. I was in shock, I didn't know how to cope. So
then I enlisted. I have never forgotten him, and I never will.''
   That was a feeling shared by about 100 people who stood in
28-degree weather as a bugler from Fort Benjamin Harrison in
Indianapolis played taps. Yellow ribbons decorated the bare
branches of trees around the monument on the downtown American
Legion Mall.
   The USS Indianapolis was sunk between Guam and the Philippines
by a Japanese submarine July 30, 1945, two days after it unloaded
parts and nuclear material used in the atomic bombs dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bell later was recovered from the ship.
   ``We're not here to refight the war or verbally bash the
Japanese. On a lovely Hawaiian morning 49 years ago, Americans who
saw the sun rise did not see it set,'' said the Rev. Russell
Blowers, minister of the 91st Street Christian Church and veteran
of the Eighth Air Force. ``With the tolling of the bell, remind us
that someday the bell will toll for us.''
   ``We are hoping this will lead to bells tolling all over the
country next year on the 50th anniversary,'' said Elbert Watson,
chairman of the World War II National Commemorative Association,
which sponsored Friday's service.
   Watson asked the Japanese government to apologize for the attack
that drew the United States into World War II. Some Japanese are
trying to persuade their leaders to apologize before President Bush
visits Japan next spring.
   Japan has apologized to South Korea and China for its military
actions in the 1930s and 1940s. No official apology has been issued
to the United States.
   ``An apology by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu or Emperor Akihito
would go a long way toward helping both countries put the war
behind them, and get on with properly commemorating the 50th
anniversary of World War II,'' Watson said.
