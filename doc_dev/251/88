   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
concluded a historic visit to Poland Tuesday and told his hosts the
issue of German reunification concerns all of Europe and must be
approached with great sensitivity.
   Kohl spoke at a news conference after signing a joint
declaration with the Solidarity-led government. The declaration
opens the way to close economic cooperation and repeats previous
West German commitments to respect Poland's western border.
   Also Tuesday, Kohl paid a somber visit to the Auschwitz death
camp, where 4 million people were murdered by the Nazis during
World War II. Kohl was accompanied by Heinz Galinski, head of the
West German Jewish Community Council, and Rabbi Menachem Joskowicz
from Warsaw, Poland's only rabbi.
   Polish television broadcast part of the visit live to the somber
music of Chopin.
   Kohl laid a wreath at the wall of death, where prisoners of
different nationalities were shot, and another in Birkenau where
the crematoriums were located. He did not make a speech.
   It was the second site Kohl visited in connection with World War
II. On Sunday, he embraced Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in a
sign of reonciliation at a Mass in the former German village of
Krzyzowa, where opponents to Hitler planned reisistance during the
war.
   The chancellor's five-day visit here was aimed at cementing
cooperation between the two countries but was dominated by the
rapid changes in East Germany.
   Kohl found the question of German reunification foremost in the
minds of his hosts when he returned to Warsaw Saturday after making
a brief stop in Bonn for an emergency Cabinet meeting.
   ``Both the Germans in East Germany and West Germany are not
alone,'' Kohl said at Tuesday's news conference. ``We Germans have
to act with a great dose of sensitivity as far as the situation in
all of Europe is concerned.''
   Kohl, the first West German leader to visit Poland since 1977,
said he and Mazowiecki discussed bilateral relations ``in the
historical context and in the context of obligations for the
future.''
   The statement said the two countries aim to ``heal the wounds of
the past through understanding and reconciliation.''
   In a meeting with members of Parliament Monday, Kohl said Poland
would benefit from a unified Germany.
   West Germany pledged in a 1970 treaty to respect the Oder and
Neisse rivers as Poland's western borders, but a reunified Germany
is not committed to those terms.
   The joint declaration signed Tuesday says West Germany will
continue to honor the 1970 treaty. Polish government spokeswoman
Malgorzata Niezabitowska said Poland was satisfied with the section
of the treaty on borders.
   Both Kohl and Mazowiecki said the joint declaration and 11
agreements signed earlier form the basis of a new chapter in
German-Polish relations.
   Of major importance to Poland are clauses in which West Germany
says it will strive to ensure that Poland's $39-billion debt is
rescheduled ``under a long-term arrangement on terms that take ...
account of the country's ability to pay.''
   A senior West German official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Bonn favored at least a five-year moratorium on
repayment of interest.
   The declaration calls for intensified economic cooperation
between the two countries. West Germany is Poland's largest western
trading partner.
   It also calls for an increase in exchanges between young people,
the establishment of German cultural institutions in Poland and the
expansion of German-language teaching.
