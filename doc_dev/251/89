   Poland says it is now satisfied that a united
Germany will make no claims on its territory, and concurrence by
the four World War II Allies virtually assures that the two
Germanys will be one by year's end.
   Foreign ministers from the seven countries decided Tuesday that
the Allies will pull out of Berlin and give up other occupational
powers held since 1945 once a reunified Germany signs a treaty
guaranteeing the current borders.
   ``We are very happy with the results,'' Polish Foreign Minister
Krzysztof Skubiszewski told reporters after Tuesday's talks. ``The
border has been confirmed.''
   The Polish diplomat's meeting with his counterparts from the two
German states and the United States, France, Britain and the Soviet
Union came a day after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
cleared the last great remaining obstacle to German unity by
endorsing its membership in the NATO alliance.
   In Tuesday's talks, the Germans agreed to give up any claim to
territory absorbed by Poland at the end of World War II and to make
that commitment part of the new Germany's constitution.
   A treaty to be signed by the new Germany and Warsaw shortly
after unification will accept the border the Allies set in 1945
between Poland and what later became East Germany.
   The Bonn government also agreed on Tuesday to talks with Poland
this summer designed to assure Warsaw that its contracts with East
Germany will be fulfilled after unification.
   The talks could result in German assistance to Poland's shaky
economy. Gorbachev ended his public reservations about German
reunification after the Bonn government promised financial
assistance as well as a limit on the troop strength of the future
German military.
   ``All agree that a unified Germany will consist of the Federal
Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and Berlin _ no
more, no less,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a joint
news conference held by the foreign ministers after their meeting.
   ``Today will go down in history as the day in which the Polish
border has been settled to the satisfaction of our Polish
friends,'' said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Tuesday's talks were held in an international conference center
yards from the Arch of Triumph, the Napoleonic monument under which
the troops of Nazi Germany marched in victory 50 years ago last
month.
   A senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said: ``Germany will give up any claim to land now held by Poland
and will state it has no territorial claim to any other nation's
land.''
   Poland, which lost 6 million people in World War II, had been
concerned that its powerful neighbor once again would start eying
Polish territory. About one-third of today's Poland was part of
pre-war Germany, awarded to the Poles to compensate for territories
annexed by the Soviet Union.
   The virtually simultaneous acts of German unification and
concluding a border treaty with Poland will be followed by full
German sovereignty, with the Americans, Soviets, British and French
giving up all occupational powers.
   Another result of the successful third round of the
``two-plus-four'' talks, to which Poland was added on the issue of
its borders, is the increased likelihood of a 35-nation summit in
Paris in November. However, the United States has insisted on
completion of a treaty beforehand to reduce U.S. and Soviet troops,
tanks and other non-nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Those talks are being held in Vienna between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact.
   On Monday, in the Soviet region of Stavropol, Gorbachev and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany agreed that the army of a
united Germany would be limited to 370,000 troops. The two Germanys
now have about 600,000 men under arms, with 480,000 in West Germany.
   The Soviet Union and West Germany also agreed to begin
negotiations on the full withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from what is
now East German territory. The 380,000 soldiers should be pulled
out in three to four years.
   West Germany _ the richest nation in Europe _ is expected to
increase trade with Moscow. It has already backed a $3 billion bank
loan to the Soviet Union and pushed its allies for a comprehensive
plan to bail out Gorbachev's crumbling economy.
   All-German elections are scheduled for Dec. 2.
