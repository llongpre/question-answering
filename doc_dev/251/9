   After years of silence and anti-Semitism,
Poland is re-evaluating its relationship to the Jews, once the
country's largest minority and now mostly a memory in abandoned
synagogues and forsaken graveyards.
   On April 14, Poles will begin a weeklong observance of the 45th
anniversary of the heroic rising of Warsaw Jews against the Nazi
occupiers.
   The commemoration, which will bring the largest delegation ever
from Israel, follows a rare public self-criticism issued last month
by Poland's communist party about anti-Semitic purges 20 years ago.
   Both the Warsaw anniversary and the party's self-criticism have
rekindled a simmering debate about whether Jews and Poles, who
lived side by side for most of Poland's 1,000 years of recorded
history, will ever be able to repair their sundered relationship.
   Poland once was known for its tolerant attitude to the Jews.
   From the Middle Ages to the 19th century, it guaranteed Jews
legal privileges and limited self-government. The Polish king was
regularly prayed for in synagogues around the world.
   By the beginning of World War II, Poland's 3.5 million Jews
comprised 10 percent of the population, the backbone of its middle
class. About 40 percent of Warsaw was Jewish.
   But as a result of the Nazi Holocaust and subsequent waves of
emigration, the number of Jews living in Poland today has fallen to
about 10,000 out of a population of 37.5 million.
   A visit to Warsaw's only synagogue on a Saturday morning shows
just 40 worshipers, mostly elderly men. There are no rabbis in
Poland.
   The 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising _ the
monthlong resistance to the Nazi drive to liquidate the ghetto's
last 70,000 inhabitants _is being treated by the government as an
opportunity to honor Polish Jews and stress the mutual suffering of
Poles and Jews under the Nazis.
   But the official apology for the 1968 purges is a reminder of
the persistent strains of anti-Semitism that have marred
Polish-Jewish relations through the centuries.
   In March, Trybuna Ludu, the official newspaper of the Polish
United Workers (communist) Party, for the first time acknowledged
that anti-Semitism was a decisive factor in the 1968 purge and that
innocent people were harmed.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, himself of Jewish descent,
said in an interview after the party statement that anti-Semitism
no longer exists in public life and among the younger generation
``it is practically nonexistent.''
   But Warsaw psychologist Kostek Gebert, a member of a budding
movement of Jews who in recent years have returned to their
ancestors' faith, said the official view is too rosy.
   ``Polish culture, the Polish identity is permeated with
anti-Semitism and I can't see any imaginable way of this fact being
corrected,'' Gebert said.
   ``The point is that in Poland a respectable person can be
anti-Semitic,'' he said. In other countries, he said, anti-Semitism
is like syphilis. ``You can have it but a gentleman doesn't show it
off.''
   During World War II, nearly 3 million Polish Jews were killed by
the Nazis. The death camps of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka,
Majdanek, Belzec, Chelmo and Sobibor were all on what is now Polish
territory.
   But although Poland was the site of much of the killing, most
Poles bridle at the view, common outside Poland and reflected in
the French documentary film ``Shoah,'' that Poles to some degree
were accomplices in the Holocaust.
   The dominant viewpoint here is that both Poles and Jews were
victims of the Nazis, and that Poles did what was within their
power to thwart the tragedy.
   Indeed, of the gentiles honored by Israel as Righteous Among
Nations for assisting Jews during the war, 1,700 were Poles, more
than in other country. And it was the Polish underground that
smuggled evidence of the existence of the death camps to London
during the war.
   But for all the examples of Poles coming to the aid of Jews,
examples can be found in recent history of Polish cruelty to Jews.
   Europe's last pogrom claimed dozens of Jewish lives in the
southern Polish city of Kielce in 1946. The 1968 purges forced
13,000 Jews from the country. During the 1980-81 Solidarity labor
upheaval, anti-Semitic charges were leveled against union activists.
   Nevertheless, there are signs that Poland is trying to put away
its anti-Semitic legacy.
   For the April 19 anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the
government is creating a memorial route.
   The government is also sprucing up Jewish monuments and
cemeteries around the country and establishing a kosher kitchen for
the 4,500 foreign visitors, principally from Israel and the United
States, expected for the Warsaw anniversary.
   Reflecting a desire to clarify attitudes about Jews in Polish
history, about 100 Polish scholars attended a meeting of historians
in Jerusalem in early February on the Holocaust.
   ``The Polish side ... presented the view that we had not done
enough and that we must admit that we are guilty of at least the
sin of indifference towards those who had been condemned,'' said
historian Krystyna Kersten, describing the conference in the
underground newspaper Tygodnik Mazowsze.
