<LEADPARA>  Robert Hawthorne (Letters, Feb. 11) and all those who are now calling for a
cease-fire and negotiations in the Middle East should read "The Rape of
Kuwait" by Jean P. Sasson. If Saddam Hussein was not persuaded to withdraw
from Kuwait by five months of negotiations and a month of watching his
military and industrial power being destroyed, it is clear that no cease-fire
and no amount of negotiations will persuade him to leave.;    In the end we
would be faced with the choice of allowing a United Nations member (Kuwait) to
cease to exist or going back to fighting. The former would mean the end of
U.N. effectiveness since the first duty of that organization must be to
preserve the existence of its members. The latter would mean much higher
causalities since allied forces would be facing an Iraq made stronger by the
rebuilding done during the cease-fire.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Bringing international outlaws to justice saves suffering and lives, just
as getting hoodlums off of the streets saves suffering and lives here at home.
The way to save lives is to win the war as soon as possible.;    -- Howard
Underwood; Fremont;  LOOK BEYOND YOUR BAY AREA BLINDERS; Pardon me, but has
anyone on the Mercury New staff ventured out off the Bay Area in the last
couple of years?;    I'm irked by the recent front page photo of "the only
stand-up roller coaster west of the Mississippi" coming to Great America in
March.;    Has anyone else ridden the Shock Wave at Magic Mountain in
Valencia? Forgive me if I'm mistaken, but I felt sure I remained upright
throughout the entire ride! Also, I believe Valencia is still west of the
Mississippi -- the earthquake didn't change the landscape that much.;   
Someone should pay the fact-checkers more money or else send more reporters on
vacation out of Santa Clara Valley.;    -- Lisa C. Thorn; San Jose;  ARMCHAIR
EXPERTS MULTIPLY IN WARTIME; One thing is certain about this stupid war: Never
in the history of warfare have there been so many armchair experts who know
when the air war should stop, when the ground war should start, or how to
fight underground.;    Politicians, retired corporals, truck drivers, busboys,
secretaries, graduates from mental institutions, reporters, etc., all know
exactly what should be done, and when and where it should be done. Even some
soldiers who have never seen their friends blown to pieces can hardly wait "to
get it over with.";    Having served my country from the beginning to the end
of World War II in the 3rd Infantry Division, I can only say that whenever any
war starts, it's the wrong time, the wrong place and for the wrong reasons.;  
 -- Alton E. Carlson Sr.;  San Jose  </TEXT>
