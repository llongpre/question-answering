   About 1,500 Jewish youths, many carrying
Israeli flags, took part in a ``March of the Living'' Thursday at
the site of the Auschwitz and Birkenau death camps as Poland
honored its victims of Nazi Germany.
   In Warsaw, hundreds of academics and historians gathered at the
State Jewish Theater for a two-day conference on the struggle and
martyrdom of Jews and Poles during the 1939-45 Nazi occupation.
   The march and the conference began a week of observances of the
45th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, in which several
hundred Jews fought a three-week battle against Hitler's army. The
uprising began April 19, 1943.
   The observance is the largest ever organized in Poland to honor
the memory of the millions of victims of the Nazi Holocaust who
died on Polish soil.
   Among those attending the conference were several Polish
government ministers, senior Communist Party officials and Roman
Catholic bishops.
   Despite the somber commemorations, the chief foreign ministry
spokesman denounced Israel for violating the basic human rights of
young Palestinians demonstrating against the Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Stefan Staniszewski told a Warsaw news conference that Poland
wanted to pay homage to the Jewish ghetto fighters who ``were
Polish citizens and ... fought together with us'' against the Nazis.
   But he said ``this emotional attitude ... does not influence our
policies towards Israel.''
   ``The brutality of the repressions used by Israeli authorities
toward the Palestinian population evokes popular outrage and
condemnation around the world,'' said Staniszewski. ``We
categorically protest against the Israeli policies.''
   As light snow fell, the march began near the Auschwitz camp's
main gates, where the legend in German reads, ``Work makes you
free.''
   The blue-jacketed youths, marching behind a banner reading
``March of the Living,'' trekked two miles to the site of the
Birkenau death camp.
   There, as a cold wind whistled through the vast open field still
surrounded by double rows of barbed wire fences and wooden watch
towers, the young Jews lit a memorial flame and scattered soil from
Israel by the monument. They followed a cantor in saying Kaddish,
the Hebrew prayer for the dead.
   Auschwitz is the German name for the Polish city of Oswiecim,
where the camp was located. The monument also commemorates the camp
at Birkenau, where the Germans built huge gas chambers and
crematoria.
   In an emotional ceremony by the stark, gray international
monument honoring those who died at the two camps, Israeli
officials declared that only a strong Jewish state could prevent
another Holocaust. The marchers carried blue-and-white Israeli
flags.
   ``It is the obligation of every Jew to feel solidarity with
every other Jew,'' said Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon,
the highest-ranking Israeli official ever to visit Poland.
   ``Only by strengthening the state of Israel, multiplying and
increasing our numbers,'' can we prevail, Navon said, speaking in
Hebrew and English.
   More than 4,500 foreign visitors have come to Poland to take
part in the observances that end April 20, including some 2,000
Israelis and hundreds of Jews from the United States, Canada, Latin
America, Western Europe and Australia.
   The observances climax Tuesday, the anniversary of the outbreak
of the uprising, in which several hundred Jewish insurgents staged
a desperate three-week struggle against the final Nazi
extermination drive to liquidate the ghetto's last 75,000
inhabitants.
   One visitor to the camp's museum, Ayelet Kuper, 15, of Montreal,
Canada, said it was emotionally wrenching to look at a room full of
children's shoes taken from victims before they were murdered.
   ``And there was a small crutch, like for an 8-year old,' she
said. ``That got to me a lot.''
   More than 4 million people died at Auschwitz and Birkenau, about
70 percent of whom were Jews.
