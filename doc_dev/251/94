   LONDON -- Lloyd's of London predicted sharp increases in
shipping insurance rates if war is started in the Mideast.
   Stephen Merrett, chairman of the big insurance market's
underwriters' association, declined to predict levels
insurance rates might reach. But he said, "If there's
substantial damage for shipping, rates would rise
substantially."

   Tankers bound for terminals in northern Saudi Arabia, the
most dangerous part of the Persian Gulf, currently are paying
rates of between 1% and 2% of the value of the cargo, Mr.
Merrett said, a huge increase over rates of 0.0125% to
0.1275% before the crisis.
   But current premiums also are far below the rates of more
than 10% seen at the height of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war,
Mr. Merrett said.
   The outbreak of war "no doubt" also would lead to higher
insurance rates in nearby shipping areas, such as the eastern
Mediterranean Sea and Suez Canal, Mr. Merrett said.
Underwriters also are checking with airlines throughout the
world to make sure they are strengthening security
arrangements to thwart any terrorist attacks, he said.
   Lloyd's also said it would remain open for business seven
days a week if necessary, if war is started.
   Lloyd's last opened on Saturday in 1965. The 300-year-old
insurance market hasn't ever operated on Sunday.
