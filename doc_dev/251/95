   Poland and Israel resumed full diplomatic
ties today after a 23-year break, making this country once a
vibrant center of Jewish life the third Warsaw Pact nation to
resume relations with Israel in the past year.
   Relations were sealed with the signing of a protocal by Foreign
Ministers Moshe Arens of Israel and Krzysztof Skubiszewski of
Poland.
   Poland, like the entire Soviet bloc except Romania, followed
Moscow's lead and broke with Israel in 1967 to support the Arab
side in the Middle East War. It joins Hungary and Czechoslovakia in
renewing ties with the Jewish state.
   Poland has had low-level ties with Israel since 1987 and the
Solidarity-led government that came to power in August is hoping
the restoration of a formal embassy will lead to closer economic
and cultural cooperation.
   Poland's Jewish community was 3.5 million strong before World
War II, the Holocaust and massive emigration including a wave
prompted by a 1968 purge. Today, it numbers just 10,000.
   From 350,000 to 500,000 Israelis were born in Poland, including
the first Israeli prime minister, David Ben Gurion, and the present
one, Yitzhak Shamir.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki looked on during the protocol
signing at a government palace, and the Polish and Israeli
delegations sipped champagne afterward to celebrate the
long-awaited event.
   Arens said Israel hopes for Polish support for Israeli positions
in the Middle East peace process and for ``very extensive economic
relations. ... That will be of benefit to both countries.''
   The first day of Aren's visit Monday was spent in emotional
visits.
   He went to a Jewish cemetery and paid homage at the monument to
the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943, when Jews, held in a walled-in
section of the city and facing starvation, murder and deportation,
rose up against the Nazi occupiers.
   Polish press coverage of the Arens visit has focused on the
government's acknowledging the error of the decision to sever ties
and that act's consequences, including an anti-Semitic purge in
1968.
   ``Poland Apologizes to Israel'' and ``Return to Normalcy'' were
among newspaper headlines Monday.
   Skubiszewski said he agrees with the need for an apology and
said that Jews who left Poland after the 1968 purge are free to
come back and recover Polish citizenship. In addition, those harmed
can seek damages, he said.
   Arens is to go Wednesday to the Auschwitz death camp in southern
Poland, where the presence of a Roman Catholic convent in a former
Nazi warehouse strained Jewish-Polish relations and stirred
international controversy.
   Skubiszewski said the topic of the convent was discussed with
Arens on today, with Poland underlining support for the
construction of an alternate home for the nuns. Ground was broken
last week on an interfaith prayer center that is to include a new
convent for the nuns.
