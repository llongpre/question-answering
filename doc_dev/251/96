<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Provokers' Confession, Witnesses' </F>
Testimony"] 
  [Text] The date of 25 June 44 years ago was the date when 
the United States provoked a war of aggression in Korea. The 
fact that the United States planned, prepared for, and provoked 
a criminal war of aggression in Korea has been confessed by the 
provokers themselves. This is a historic fact to which 
witnesses and the world have testified. 
  First of all, the United States mapped out a detailed plan 
and made scrupulous preparations for the war of aggression in 
Korea. As far as the United States was concerned, its invasion 
of the northern half of the Republic was a central question in 
U.S. policy toward South Korea at that time. In this 
connection, the United States had made preparations for an armed 
invasion of the northern half of the Republic right since the 
end of World War II. 
  At that time, then U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Muccio 
stated definitely: A northward invasion is a central question 
in the U.S. policy toward South Korea. Therefore, this question 
should not be slighted. 
  Already in May 1950, the eve of the war provoked, (Jones), 
director of the South Korean Affairs Department of the former 
U.S. Agency for Economic Aid, said: They are armed with 
American-style weapons. One hundred-thousand-strong South 
Korean troops, who have been trained by U.S. Army officers under 
the supervision of a U.S. Armed Forces' mission in Seoul, have 
completed all of their preparations. They are ready to start a 
war at any time. 
  At that time, (Seybold), director of the (?Foreign Affairs 
Bureau) of the MacArthur Command, pointed out: As far as a 
conquest of North Korea is concerned, the battleships or 
aircraft in Japan will participate in battles on the side of 
South Korea. Therefore, there will be nothing to be worried 
about as far as the Navy and Air Force are concerned. 
  LIFE, a U.S. magazine, wrote: We have never seen an 
example--in which much preparations have been made--in any kind 
of war waged up until now, throughout the entire period of our 
history, other than when the Korean War started. 
  (CONBADIE) of France wrote in the 29 July, 1953 edition: 
Judging from all facts today, the United States had already made 
preparations for the Korean War right since the end of World War 
II. 
  An American publication entitled "Who Ignited the Korean 
War?" pointed out that such meticulous preparations had been 
completed in May 1950. 
  The warmongers, who had finished their preparations for the 
war, watched only for an opportunity to ignite a war. 
  On the foremost front along the 38th Parallel on 18 June, 
1950, Dulles, a former U.S. presidential special envoy who had 
sneaked into South Korea for a final check-up for preparations 
for a Korean war, mapped out a scenario--for the puppets--aimed 
at covering up their provocation of a war, saying: Along with 
counter-propaganda that North Korea invaded first, you should 
launch an attack on North Korea. If you hold out for two weeks, 
the United States will bring a charge that North Korea has 
invaded South Korea during that period so that the United 
Nations will have to mobilize ground, naval, and air forces in 
its name. We will see to it that everything goes on smoothly. 
  On 20 June two days later, he clamored: The purpose of my 
visit to South Korea as a special envoy of President Truman is 
to study the situation about the preparations for a war--which 
we have actively pushed for--and to present my opinion that you 
had better not hesitate in launching a northward invasion if 
there is nothing insufficient. In my opinion, everything has 
been prepared satisfactorily. As long as preparations have been 
made, the sooner, the better. 
  Dulles then gave an order that a northward invasion be 
launched on 25 June. 
  In June 1950, at that time, Robert, director of the U.S. 
military advisory group, spat out the inside truth by saying: 
Why did we choose the date of 25 June? Herein lies our 
prudent intention. June 25th is a Sunday. The United States, a 
Christian country, and South Korea regard Sunday as a Sabbath 
Day. No one will believe that we launched a war on a Sunday. 
In other words, this is aimed at making people believe that we 
have not ignited a war first. 
  It is a stereotyped trick of the United States to wickedly 
maneuver to shift its responsibility for a provocation onto 
another's shoulders. 
  In his book entitled "A Secret History of the Korean War," 
an 
American reporter exposed: The United States Government has 
already prepared a draft of a resolution to be used at the 
United Nations. Without undergoing (?negotiations) and 
investigation at the UN Security Council, it demanded that the 
United Nations brand North Korea an aggressor. 
  An American critic disclosed: The news about 25 June, 1950 
that North Korea attacked South Korea has been come out of the 
pockets of Syngman Rhee and MacArthur. 
  The true nature of the war provokers was made clear also in 
a 
report filed by the UN Commission on Korea to the UN Secretary 
General on 24 June, one day before the provocation of the war. 
  The report pointed out: Up to now, our commission has not 
received any information from any intelligence organization that 
the North Korean armed forces have an attempt for an aggression. 
On the contrary, the North Korean regime is now absorbed in 
implementing the two-year people's economy. 
  (Herringer), a former professor of the University of 
Pennsylvania, pointed out: The one that was dealt an unexpected 
blow was not the United States, but the communist camp. 
  An American scholar (Meier) exposed the truth by noting: The 
People's Army launched a counterattack after withdrawing two to 
three kilometers on all fronts of the 38th Parallel after having 
been dealt an unexpected attack from the South Korean Army. 
  Like this, the United States believed that its scenario for 
provoking the Korean War would remain a secret forever. But, it 
has been fully revealed to the world by Americans' own 
confessions, documents, and the world's media. 
  The truth about the U.S. imperialists' provocation of the 
Korean War can never be covered up.
