   Mixing anger with grief, World Jewish
Congress leaders today honored the memory of the 6 million Jewish
victims of the Holocaust at the mansion where high-ranking Nazis
plotted their ``Final Solution.''
   ``I will not pray here, because I personally believe that God
turned his face away from this place, as he did from Auschwitz,''
said congress President Edgar M. Bronfman. ``Neverthless something
must be said.''
   In Hebrew, German and English, participants read words penned by
death camp survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel:
   ``What does a Jew today feel in this place, marked by evil and
malediction? Fear and trembling, anger _ incommensurate anger,
helplessness and grief, infinite grief.''
   The ceremony at the Wannsee Villa came on the final day of the
World Jewish Congress meeting in Berlin, the first time the
organization has met on German soil. Some delegates from around the
world stayed away from the meeting, saying the trip to the heart of
Nazi tyranny would be too traumatic.
   After the ceremony, the congress leaders went to East Berlin for
a meeting with East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   ``There has never been a Germany without Jews,'' de Maiziere
told the Jewish leaders. ``There can only be a Germany with Jews,
or there won't be any Germany.
   ``Yet, the shadow of Auschwitz hangs over us,'' he continued.
   The democratically elected East German parliament, in a dramatic
gesture, last month accepted a share of responsibility for the
Holocaust. For more than four decades, the now-ousted Communist
authorities had denied any responsibility for the deaths of 6
million Jews.
   During his East Berlin visit, Bronfman urged that a memorial be
built at the site of the now crumbling Berlin Wall to recall the
dual significance of the date Nov. 9.
   On that day last year, the Berlin Wall was opened. On Nov. 9,
1938, Nazi thugs throughout Germany started ransacking Jewish
stores and homes and killing dozens of Jews in what has been called
Kristallnacht (Crystal Night), because of all the broken glass.
   The ceremony at the Wannsee Villa was held on the 45th
anniversary of the Nazis' unconditional surrender, ending World War
II in Europe.
   Under brilliant, sunny skies, the congress leaders gathered in
front of the villa, where on Jan. 20, 1942, high-ranking officials
of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich planned the extermination of the Jews.
   Wiesel's words called to mind some of the Jewish victims of the
Holocaust: ``teachers and their pupils, brides and grooms,
intellectuals and workers, rabbis and their disciples, young
revolutionaries and old dreamers of Zion.''
   Heather Harris, 23, read the statement in English before about
300 people, including the congress' leadership. Ms. Harris comes
from San Francisco and now lives in Jerusalem, where she heads the
World Union of Jewish Students.
   Heinz Galinski, head of West Germany's 35,000-member Jewish
community, recalled the horror that the Nazis planned at Wannsee.
   He said the murder of the Jews ``stands alone in the history of
mankind.''
   ``If the Nazis had won, then all the people of the world would
have been enslaved,'' said Galinski, like Wiesel a survivor of the
Auschwitz death camp.
   Before the ceremony, Bronfman and other leaders of the group
toured the inside of the villa, which is in disrepair. West Berlin
plans to turn it into a Holocaust memorial.
   They stood in what is known as the ``Fireplace Room,'' where
Nazi SS boss Reinhard Heydrich and his fellow Nazis planned the
``Final Solution.''
   ``It's mind-boggling,'' Bronfman said. ``I'm sad and I'm angry
too.''
   Introducing the statement by Wiesel, Bronfman called the Wannsee
decision ``the most despicable decision in the history of
mankind.'' Wiesel himself did not attend the ceremony because of
what were termed ``scheduling problems.''
   In the villa 48 years ago, Heydrich detailed plans to use Jews
as slave laborers and to build concentration camps, gas chambers
and crematoria. He said that a total of 11 million Jews would be
wiped out.
   Even before the Wannsee conference, Nazi troops had been
slaughtering Jews in occupied Polish and Soviet territory.
   Outside the villa's high gates, a plaque reads: ``In this house
in January 1942, the infamous Wannsee conference took place. To the
memory of the fellow human beings slain by the Nazi tyranny.''
   At a news conference Monday at the heavily guarded West Berlin
Jewish Community headquarters, the Jewish congress leaders
discussed their concerns about German reunification.
   ``The Jewish people have something to say to the new Germany
that is going to be created in a short time,'' Bronfman said.
   He said Sunday that a unified Germany must ``forever teach''
about the Nazi Holocaust, ``the lowest point ever reached in man's
inhumanity to man.''
   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said it was Israel's
duty to demand that ``in a united Germany there would be a
perpetual educational effort, so that the generation growing up
there would remember. In all parts of Germany, the government must
wage a war against anti-Semitism.''
   The Polish-born Shamir escaped the Holocaust, but his parents
and two sisters were killed.
   Of the more than 600 participants at the meeting, 80 were from
nations other than Germany.
