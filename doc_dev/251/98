   A vandal threw paint on windows and walls
of the Jewish State Theater over the weekend in an attack linked to
the dispute over a Roman Catholic convent at Auschwitz, police
reported.
   The vandal painted the message, ``This is for the convent.''
   Worshippers saw the damage as they arrived Sunday night to mark
the beginning of Yom Kippur, the most solemn Jewish holiday, at
Warsaw's only synagogue that is next to the theater.
   Police said the blue paint had been splattered on the building
Saturday.
   The theater, created by the state shortly after World War II,
presents plays in Yiddish, preserving a cultural remnant of what
was once one of Europe's most vibrant Jewish communities.
   ``A lot of nasty and unexpected things have happened recently,''
said Rabbi Menachem Joskowitz, a survivor of the Nazi death camp at
Auschwitz who emigrated this year from Israel to serve as Poland's
only rabbi. ``Synagogue windows have been broken in Lublin and
Czestochowa,'' he said.
   The rabbi said the violence was a result of controversy over the
convent of Carmelite nuns on the perimeter of the Nazi
concentration camp in southern Poland. Jewish leaders have demanded
that the convent be removed, saying Christian symbols are intrusive
at a place where 2.5 million Jews were murdered.
   Catholic Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow agreed in 1987
to relocate the convent, but a 1989 deadline was not met and the
Polish church said the agreement was not valid. After the Vatican
intervened in the dispute in August Polish bishops agreed again to
move the nuns to an international prayer center.
   On Saturday, the Polish episcopate issued a statement saying it
hoped the prayer center will ``contribute to development of
Christian-Jewish dialogue in the spirit of mutual respect and
understanding of the importance of the Auschwitz Nazi death camp
... for Poles, Jews and other nations.''
   The Jewish demands angered some Poles who said the nuns harmed
no one and should be allowed to pray for the tens of thousands of
non-Jewish victims killed at Auschwitz.
