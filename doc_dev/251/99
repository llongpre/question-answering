   A half-century after World War II broke out
across Europe, half of all Americans expect World War III one day _
and most think it would end in nuclear devastation, a poll has found.
   Of those who foresaw another war, six in 10 expected it within
two decades, the Media General-Associated Press poll found. And if
world war does break out, 54 percent feared its escalation into
all-out nuclear war.
   A majority of respondents also said one of the darkest episodes
of World War II could recur: A holocaust on the order of Nazi
Germany's murders of more than 6 million Jews, gassed, starved or
shot in concentration camps.
   The poll, conducted among 1,163 adults, asked: ``Do you think
that kind of thing could happen again _ that is, the killing of
millions of people because of their religion or ethnic background?''
Six in 10 said it could.
   World War II erupted on Sept. 1, 1939, when more than a million
German troops invaded Poland. The war soon consumed Europe, North
Africa and the Far East, claiming an estimated 50 million lives
before it ended in 1945.
   The United States joined the war in 1941 after the Japanese, who
were allied with the Germans, attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet at
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Poll respondents overwhelmingly expressed the
view that the Nazis would have conquered Western Europe had the
United States not intervened.
   In the Pacific, the United States hastened Japan's surrender in
1945 by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki _ still the
only time nuclear weapons have been detonated in a war.
   Six in 10 poll respondents said the Hiroshima bombing, in which
death estimates run as high as 200,000, was the right thing to do.
Seventy percent of the men in the survey supported the bombing; half
the women agreed.
   With Japan now one of the world's leading economic powers, nearly
four in 10 said the United States did too much to help rebuild Japan
after the war. Two in 10 said they sometimes think of Japan as the
enemy because of the war.
   Germany fared better: Just one in 10 said they sometimes think of
it as the enemy, and 24 percent said the United States did too much
to help rebuild West Germany, also one of the world's strongest
economies today.
   Respondents strongly supported the reunification of Germany,
which was divided into democratic West Germany and communist East
Germany after the war. Seventy percent favored reunification.
   Nearly seven in 10 considered themselves to be familiar with the
events of World War II. Older people were far more apt to rate
themselves as ``very familiar'' with the war; 57 percent of those
older than 64 chose that category, compared with just 12 percent of
those younger than 45.
   There was no division by age in familiarity with one aspect of
the war: A near-unanimous 95 percent said they had heard of the
Holocaust.
   Older respondents were less likely to believe there will be
another world war but were more likely to expect that if one
occurred it would escalate into nuclear war. The expectation of
another world war was greater among women than men, 53-44 percent,
and women were more inclined to fear nuclear escalation of a world
war, 60-48 percent.
   Of the 49 percent who foresaw another world war, 6 percent said
it was likely within five years, 29 percent within 10 years and 26
percent within 20 years. Thus 61 percent of this group _ or 30
percent of all respondents _ expected World War III within two
decades.
   The poll was conducted by telephone July 7-16 among a random
sample of adults in the continental United States. It has a margin
of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
