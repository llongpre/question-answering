   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether people who do not own property may be excluded from
membership on a public body authorized to recommend a reorganization
of local government in the St. Louis area.
   The court said it will hear a challenge to the make-up of the St.
Louis City-St. Louis County Board of Freeholders.
   The board of freeholders was created to write a proposed charter
for reorganizing the city and county government structure. The board
also was empowered to recommend new taxes to finance the city and
county governments.
   Any proposals by the board would be submitted to the voters in a
referendum.
   Board members were ppointed by the mayor of St. Louis, the county
executive and the governor of Missouri.
   State Representative Robert J. Quinn, a St. Louis County resident
who does not own property, said his rights were violated by a state
constitutional requirement limiting membership on the freeholder
board to property owners.
   Quinn, suing for himself and all others in the city and county
who do not own property, said the exclusion violated the U.S.
Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under law.
   But the Missouri Supreme Court ruled last September that the
federal constitutional protection does not apply because the
freeholder board does not have ``general governmental powers.''
   ``The board of freeholders serves only to recommend a plan of
reorganization to the voters of St. Louis City and St. Louis
County,'' the state court said. ``It can recommend ... property
taxes and sales taxes, but it cannot levy and collect them. In sum,
the board of freeholders has no general governmental powers.''
   The state court said the St. Louis case is not covered by past
U.S. Supreme Court rulings that struck down property ownership as a
qualification for membership on a city school board or regional
airport commission.
   The case is Quinn vs. Millsap, 88-1048.
