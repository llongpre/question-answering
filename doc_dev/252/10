Chrysler, the US motor manufacturer enjoying strong market share gains,
yesterday announced plans to spend Dollars 1.8bn - up from a previously
announced Dollars 1bn - to expand the production capacity of its
best-selling vehicles over the next two years.
The company said the Dollars 1.8bn would increase capacity by some 500,000
units a year, to around 3.5m vehicles by 1996, and could add around 6,000
new jobs at its plants in the US and Canada.
Last September the company approved a Dollars 1bn programme to remove
production bottlenecks and the additional Dollars 800m it is now committing
is in response to continued strong demand for its products, particularly its
new Dodge Ram pick-up trucks and its Jeep Grand Cherokee sports utility
vehicles.
The move, which comes against a background of global vehicle overcapacity,
underlines Chrysler's strong financial and market-share recovery from the
1991 US recession, when it appeared close to a financial crisis.
The recovery has been due to a succession of innovatively-styled new
vehicles, strong cost controls, and an improvement in the US vehicle market.
The US industry announced yesterday that cars sold at an annual rate of 7.3m
units in February, the same as January and up from 6m units a year ago.
Truck sales were 6m units, up from 4.7m the previous February.
Chrysler's action yesterday includes keeping open its St Louis North
assembly plant, which is making its popular mini-vans. It had previously
intended to close the plant in January 1995, switching production of a new
generation mini-van to a second plant in St Louis.
However, the North plant will now be reopened in the third quarter of next
year to build up to 130,000 Ram trucks a year. The move will add around
1,500 employees in a programme costing Dollars 300m.
