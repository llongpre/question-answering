<LEADPARA>  The pattern is becoming frustratingly familiar for the Sharks.;   In what has
become typical style, the Sharks (1-4) walked away from a tight game Saturday
night with nothing to show for themselves after they had gone to the final
minute with a chance to get at least a point.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Saturday's Score; BLUES 6, SHARKS 3; Highlight: St. Louis scored four times in

<TEXT>     This time, the chance died when Murray Baron and Rob Bassen pleased a crowd
of 17,897 at the St. Louis Arena by scoring empty-net goals to ice a 6-3
victory for the St. Louis Blues.;   Dave Christian had two goals for the
Blues, and Jeff Brown and Adam Oates had the others. The Sharks got goals from
Perry Berezan, Brian Mullen and Pat Falloon.;   The Sharks have not been
behind by more than one goal heading into the final minute of any of their
five NHL games, but four of them have ended in losses.;   "This definitely is
getting frustrating," said Falloon, who had an assist to go along with his
goal. "But we can't let it get to us. We have to learn from it, and you learn
a lot more when you're playing in tight games.";   The outcome might have been
different if not for a span of about a minute late in the second period. The
Blues (2-2) took their first lead of the game when Christian snapped a 2-2 tie
after taking a pretty backhand pass from Oates with 16 minutes, 14 seconds
expired in the period, and Oates extended the lead to 4-2 when he beat Sharks
goalie Jarmo Myllys with a rebound shot 52 seconds later.;   "We lost our
composure and we paid for it," Sharks Coach George Kingston said. "We got
ourselves into a hole.";   The Sharks had a chance to climb out of that hole
after Falloon scored his second goal of the season at 3:07 of the third
period. But they weren't able to get another shot past St. Louis goalie Curtis
Joseph, even after being awarded a power play when Blues defenseman Garth
Butcher was called for high-sticking Brian Lawton with 3:24 remaining.;  
Craig Coxe came close to getting the Sharks into a tie with about a minute
remaining, but Joseph robbed him. Earlier, Joseph made a nice save to beat
Lawton from point-blank range.;   "We all knew they were for real," said
Oates, who had assists on both of Christian's goals. "They have a lot of good
hockey players, and we had to play a strong game to beat them.";   The Sharks
led 1-0 at the end of the first period on Berezan's first goal of the season.
But Brown beat Myllys with a shot from beyond the top of the right-wing
faceoff circle at 2:01 of the second period.;   Brown's goal came 47 seconds
after Sharks defenseman Doug Wilson had been sent to the penalty box for
tripping.;   Kingston said he thought Myllys wasn't prepared for Brown's shot,
but Myllys said it deflected off the stick of Sharks defenseman Ken Hammond.; 
 "It might have hit off the shaft," Hammond said. "I know Jarmo said it
changed direction.";   Mullen put the Sharks ahead 2-1 when he scored his
second goal of the season at 7:12 of the second period, while Blues defenseman
Mario Marois was serving a holding penalty. But Christian answered with his
first goal at 10:28. Christian scored on a rebound after Myllys had stopped a
long shot by Butcher, and Kingston criticized Myllys for not freezing the puck
after making the original save.;   "I know I made a mistake on that one,"
Myllys said. "I should have frozen that puck, and I just didn't do it.";   For
the Sharks, it was just another typically frustrating moment.; Sharks     1 1
