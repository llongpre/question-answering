<HEAD>Cox Sells Independent TV Station To St. Louis Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>

   Cox Enterprises Inc. said Tuesday it had agreed
to sell its independent television station here to a new St.
Louis-based communications company for an undisclosed price.
   The sale of KDNL, Channel 30, to Better Communications Inc.
hinges on approval by the Federal Communications Commission. KDNL is
affiliated with the Fox Network.
   Atlanta-based Cox also owns newspapers, other television stations
and radio stations.
   Stanley G. Mouse, president of Cox Broadcasting, a division of
Cox Enterprises, said KDNL had not fit the profile of its other
television stations.
   ``Other Cox television stations either are affiliated with the
networks of ABC, CBS and NBC _ or are top 10 market independents
with major news commitments,'' Mouse said.
   ``We're pleased to turn KDNL over to quality broadcasters who
will serve the St. Louis market well,'' he said. ``As for Cox, we
will continue to look for television stations that fit our
portfolio.''
   Better Communications was formed last fall by Barry Baker, former
vice president and director of Koplar Communications Inc. of St.
Louis, and Larry Marcus, former vice president of business affairs
for Koplar. Koplar owns KPLR-TV, St. Louis' Channel 11.
   ``KDNL is the perfect launch for Better Communications,'' Baker
said. ``We plan to grow a broadcasting company from our St. Louis
base, a city in which we have strong ties to both the business and
civic communities.''
