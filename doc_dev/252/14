Bernie Nicholls said the coaches jumped all over the Kings after a lackluster 
first period, and it apparently had the desired effect as Los Angeles came out 
and blew St. Louis away, 7-4, behind Nicholls' 13th career hat trick Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious we didn't play well in the first period," Nicholls said of a 
period that saw only a single goal -- by St. Louis. "Give them the credit. They 
didn't give us much. We got shouted at between periods and it got a little 
hyper in here. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get excited after one bad period. We played well in the second and 
third." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls scored his third hat trick of the season in running his goal scoring 
total to 43 in 44 games, second only to Mario Lemieux of Pittsburgh, who has 
47. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring the first Kings goal of the game, Nicholls completed his hat 
trick with a pair of goals 64 seconds apart early in the third period to expand 
what had been a 4-3 Los Angeles lead to 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Krushelnyski added his 12th and 13th goals for the Kings, while rookie 
Igor Liba added a goal and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
Tony McKegney collected two goals for the Blues, his 16th and 17th of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have won two straight games after suffering through a five-game 
winless streak. St. Louis has won only once in their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Tuttle scored the only goal of the first period at 1:45. After Nicholls' 
45-foot slap shot tied the game at 2:07 of the second period, McKegney rammed 
in a 5-footer at 3:44 to make it 2-1 Blues. The Kings then reeled off three 
straight goals to take command. 
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille popped in a 10-foot rebound of a shot by Sylvain Couturier at 
4:29 to tie the game at 2-2. Liba's power play goal made the score 3-2 at 8:45. 
Liba deflected in Dale De Gray's shot from the blue line past goaltender Greg 
Millen. 
</P>
<P>
Krushelnyski's first goal at 14:27 of the second came on a 5-foot tap-in off a 
pass from Liba to make it 4-2. St. Louis closed to 4-3 with 3:30 remaining in 
the middle period when Rick Meagher beat Kings goalie Glenn Healy on a 20-foot 
wrist shot. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference tonight is we were down 4-3 going into the third, and we know 
it's a one-goal game," said Blues Coach Brian Sutter. "We've got to play like 
we did in the first two periods. We got away from what we do as a hockey team. 
We let it slip away. You've got to play 60 minutes -- that's concentration. 
It's not that didn't get any chances because we got the opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Kings goalie Glenn Healy won his 20th game of the season, tying him for the NHL 
lead with Philadelphia's Ron Hextall. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately we came out strong," said Healy, "and when you get a cushion you 
tend to play with a lot more confidence."
