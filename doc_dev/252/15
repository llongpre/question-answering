It's still unknown whether Bill Walsh will return to the broadcast booth next 
season, but the former San Francisco 49er coach did indicate a preference for 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers should he return to football. 
</P>
<P>
"If I pick a team to sign with, Tampa Bay would be at the top of my list," 
Walsh told the St. Petersburg Times. "But there's a lot that would have to 
occur before we finalize something." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's name has surfaced as a possible replacement at virtually every 
franchise that is having trouble. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Tuesday 
that three teams, possibly including the Rams, have already contacted Walsh. 
Cleveland and Tampa Bay were the other teams. 
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper report may be nothing more than speculation based on 
rumor. Neither Walsh nor Rams executive vice president John Shaw could be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has given no indication to his colleagues that he has an interest with 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Enberg, a broadcast partner of Walsh's at NBC, said that Walsh has had a 
lot of contact from teams but Enberg labeled the Ram rumor as "the least 
credible of them all." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Jones, who spent last weekend with Walsh working the Denver-Kansas City 
game, said he talked extensively with Walsh about a possible return to 
football. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what he's going to do, and I don't think Bill knows what he's 
going to do," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Network sources indicate that NBC is satisfied with Walsh's work but given 
current budget constraints haven't decided whether to sign him to another 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has said that he will not decide his future until after the football 
season. He has not spoken with Buccaneer owner Hugh Culverhouse, but Walsh said 
in the St. Petersburg paper that Culverhouse had asked San Francisco owner 
Eddie DeBartolo to represent Tampa Bay interests in preliminary discussions.
