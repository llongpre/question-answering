RAMS HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 1990

In a world devoid of San Francisco 49ers, the Rams might be kings. They threw 
their best stuff at the league in 1989, won 13 games, christened a star 
quarterback, played with passion and purpose, and made everyone gather around 
the tube to watch reruns of Flipper. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no blue ribbons. The 49ers have extended grief upon the Rams into a new 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Losing a championship game is difficult enough. The Rams know, having lost nine 
of 12 over the years. But losing to your divisional rival is unbearable. Still, 
the Rams stood and took it honorably after Sunday's 30-3 loss, biting their 
tongues to suppress what had to be an excruciating frustration. 
</P>
<P>
What legal act, exactly, aligned these divisions in the first place, and what's 
to keep a team from jumping ship? If an owner can move a franchise out of town 
in the dead of night, why can't the Rams fudge up their letterhead a bit and 
announce a new alliance with the AFC West? 
</P>
<P>
Can a franchise talk out loud here? 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have averaged 9.6 victories a season under Coach John Robinson since 
1983, and have to show for it one lonely divisional banner to run up the 
flagpole each morning. The Rams will always have 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, a spirited team with an infectious collegiate flavor, never wanted 
the 1989 season to end, much less skid to a halt as it did in Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a roller-coaster," safety Vince Newsome said. "It's been one of the 
oddest years, and the only way to see any good out of it would have been to be 
in the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Newsome, a relative veteran among kids who turns 29 next week, has maybe seen 
his best chance slip away. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Flipper Anderson, who burst from nowhere in training camp to 
national acclaim in November, can't wait for July. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big loss," he said after Sunday's game. "But we know what kind of team 
we have. Our spirits are down because of the loss, but we'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Rams count the days until Joe Montana's going-away party. 
But 1989, for all its crazy comebacks and memories, is done. Robinson explains 
that a football team dies at the end of each season and must be reborn the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Rams were buried in Candlestick Park. A new season will be bring 
change. You'll miss some familiar faces and won't recognize others. 
</P>
<P>
Some names to look for in coming weeks: 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett. One skittish championship game-performance does not a season make. 
Everett came of age in 1989, leading the Rams through nine nerve-racking 
finishes, winning six. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will soon reward Everett with a new long-term contract, probably five 
years in the $2-million-a-season range. The deal will be completed before Feb. 
1, when Everett technically becomes a free agent. Vice President John Shaw and 
Everett's agent, Marvin Demoff, have been quietly working on the deal since 
August, and risking Everett to a free-agent offer sheet was never an option for 
the Rams or Everett. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiations say the deal will be announced at a news 
conference soon, but there's a "90%" chance it won't happen this week. 
</P>
<P>
LeRoy Irvin. He was 10 years of laughs and one of the most flamboyant Rams 
ever, but his career is apparently over, at least in Anaheim. Irvin, a two-time 
Pro Bowl selection at right cornerback, suggested he would retire after 
Sunday's loss. That may become official on Feb. 1, when the Rams must protect 
37 players and leave the rest for Plan B free agency. Irvin, sources say, won't 
be protected. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Slater. The 14-year veteran right tackle made the Pro Bowl for the sixth 
time in 1989, but Sunday's loss choked him up so much he said he's considering 
retirement. Don't expect it to happen. Robinson thinks Slater, 35, can play two 
more seasons. For that reason, the Rams are expected to protect him. Great 
tackles, even aging ones, are difficult to find. Look for Slater to return for 
his 15th season. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston Green. What's a team to do with a first-round pick who hasn't played in 
two years? Green finished the season on injured reserve so the Rams could 
activate Paul Butcher, a free-agent special teams monster, for a playoff game 
against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was the 14th pick of 1988, though, the Rams will likely protect 
Green from free agency, figuring some team will surely take a chance with the 
former UCLA star. The trading season opens again Feb. 5, but Green hasn't shown 
enough to command much in market value. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone need a low-mileage tailback with great speed and questionable desire? 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Shurmur. The Rams' defensive coordinator since 1983, Shurmur brought the 
league innovations such as the Eagle defense -- five linebackers, two down 
linemen -- and this year's four-linebacker rushing unit. Shurmur gained 
national attention when he out-foxed Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan in the 
wild-card game. It might have been enough to get the 57-year-old Shurmur a 
crack at the Phoenix Cardinals' coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
It would take the Rams more than a phone call or two to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ONCE AROUND THE ROSTER IN 1990 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSE: Don't touch that dial. The unit is set for the next five years, so 
long as tackle Robert Cox can step in for Slater in two years and line coach 
Hudson Houck can develop a few young projects to protect against age. Left 
tackle Irv Pankey turns 32 next season and center Doug Smith is 33. Smith made 
the Pro Bowl in 1989, and Pankey would have been in a few by now were it not 
for Slater, who keeps stealing votes on the right side. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson says he's going to abandon his one-back offense in favor of a two-back 
set to better utilize underworked backs Robert Delpino and Cleveland Gary. 
</P>
<P>
But tailback Greg Bell isn't exactly over the hill. The man the experts claimed 
couldn't put good seasons back to back just finished his second consecutive 
1,000-yard rushing season and his third in a six-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for an afterthought in the Eric Dickerson trade of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Bell doesn't turn 28 until August. Any more dwarf jokes? 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: Want six good reasons the Rams had no chance of stopping the 49ers 
Sunday? Mike Piel, Bill Hawkins, Clifford Hicks, Anthony Newman, Doug Reed and 
Newsome. All missed the championship game because of injuries. Piel started at 
right defensive end but re-dislocated his left elbow in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
When sound, the Rams' defense isn't as defenseless as it appeared Sunday when 
Montana brushed up on some of his patterns. It probably wouldn't have finished 
21st overall for the season, either. The pieces are there. 
</P>
<P>
Still, changes beckon in 1990. Robinson swears he's finally going to move Jerry 
Gray, a four-time Pro Bowl selection at left cornerback, back to his natural 
position, free safety. But can he afford to if Irvin retires and Hicks, his 
heir apparent, can't return from major reconstructive knee surgery? That would 
leave Darryl Henley and Alfred Jackson as starting cornerbacks in the same 
division with Jerry Rice and John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
One option is drafting a cornerback this spring, or moving Newman to one of the 
open spots. 
</P>
<P>
Piel kept getting better at defensive end, and first-pick Hawkins had emerged 
as a solid player when he was lost for the season Dec. 11 with a knee injury 
that required surgery. 
</P>
<P>
One objective for next season is getting linebacker Frank Stams more action. 
The former Notre Dame star volunteered to move to inside linebacker when Fred 
Strickland and Larry Kelm went down in training camp. Stams was thrown to the 
wolves, then disappeared when Strickland and Kelm returned, proving it takes 
more than five minutes to learn a new position in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL TEAMS: Dale Hatcher, who made the Pro Bowl as a rookie in 1985, may 
have punted his way to Plan B free agency with his woeful 38.8 average in 1989. 
Kicker Mike Lansford remained one of the NFL's best clutch kickers. If he ever 
improves his kickoffs, he'll make a Pro Bowl before he's through. 
</P>
<P>
No question, the Rams made waves in 1989. Their fourth-quarter comebacks gave 
them unique character and a soul. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of our football team," Robinson said. "I think we played our hearts 
out throughout the year." 
</P>
<P>
They made it all the way to the Final Four. Flipper Anderson, an understudy 
turned superstar, says the Rams will be back in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Think the 49ers will show? 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have been held without a touchdown in their last three NFC title 
games, dating back to a 9-0 victory over Tampa Bay in the championship game of 
1979. The Rams used three field goals to win that game. They were defeated by 
the Chicago Bears in 1985, 24-0, and by the 49ers on Sunday, 30-3.
