   With a little help from Interpol, a Roman
statue displayed here is going back to the French museum from which
it was stolen in 1914.
   The bronze, a six-inch statue of Hypnos _ the god of sleep _ was
given to the St. Louis Art Museum in 1953.
   The museum's board of commissioners voted Tuesday to give it
back to the Musee des Beaux Arts et d'Archeologie in Besancon,
France.
   French police may come to St. Louis this summer to claim the
statue, one of six bronze objects stolen in 1914, a French museum
official said.
   The statue was given to the St. Louis Art Museum by the late J.
Lionberger Davis, a lawyer, art collector and museum patron, said
James Burke, museum director.
   Burke said the statue was neither a particularly valuable nor
important work and was worth no more than $5,000. He said the
statue has not been displayed at the museum for at least 20 years.
   The statue's ownership came into question as it was about to be
auctioned at Sotheby's in New York last year. A few days before the
auction, two scholars who had seen the statue in a catalog
questioned its authenticity and suggested that it might be a copy
of the missing Besancon bronze, Burke said.
   A day before the auction, Interpol, the international police
force, notified Sotheby's that the statue was believed to be the
stolen bronze itself and the statue was withdrawn from the sale.
   The authenticity of the statue was determined when a plaster
cast made from a 160-year-old mold of the Besancon bronze was
compared to the statue in the St. Louis collection. The plaster
cast and the St. Louis bronze were identical, down to a crack in
the left arm and scratch marks on the buttocks, Burke said.
   Sidney M. Goldstein, associate director of the St. Louis museum,
said he had no reason to believe that either Davis or his dealer
had known that the object had been stolen. He said he had planned
to take the statue to the Besancon museum himself as a gesture of
good will, but a French museum official said the statue must be
turned over to the French police.
