   The city of East St. Louis endangers its
police force by failing to equip officers properly, a prosecutor
said Wednesday at the opening of a trial on criminal charges of
reckless conduct against the city.
   But Mayor Carl Officer countered in afternoon testimony: ``I
know of no officer of the East St. Louis police department required
to go to work if they felt their safety was endangered.''
   The Mississippi River city, plagued by unemployment, crime and a
growing municipal debt, is accused of failing to supply its
seven-member patrol force with properly working radios and cars.
   Officials said it was the first Illinois city to be tried on
criminal charges. Convictions would carry fines of $1,000 on each
of nine misdemeanor counts, filed Feb. 22 by the St. Clair County
state's attorney.
   State's Attorney John Baricevic told Circuit Judge Robert
LeChien that some police had bought their own radios and that
detectives had used their own cars.
   The city ``was aware of the situation and recklessly ignored''
it, Baricevic said. The city had the money to correct the problems
but failed to do so, he said. He said he planned to call about 30
witnesses.
   The mayor testified the police-radio problems were routine.
``They are mechanical equipment. They are manmade; they break
down,'' he said. He contended some of the vehicle problems were due
to abuse by the police.
   East St. Louis City Attorney Sam Ross contended Wednesday that
there were no local, state or federal regulations saying
municipalities must provide officers with radios.
   Officer Ray Waggaman, a 16{-year East St. Louis police veteran,
testified that he felt endangered by problems with the radios and
cars.
   Waggaman said he bought his own portable radio in 1983 because
the police radio did not transmit or receive properly. He said he
was not reimbursed.
   Waggaman said he informed his shift commander repeatedly of the
problems, which included cars with bald tires and low oil and
without spotlights.
   During cross examination, Ross said there were no regulations to
define what a ``properly equipped'' vehicle was.
   ``It's a luxury, is it not?'' Ross asked Waggaman, referring to
the radios. ``It's for the convenience of the officer.''
   Waggaman said he knew of no regulations governing the equipment.
   Roosevelt Malone, a former alderman and former chairman of the
City Council's Public Safety Committee, testified that Police Chief
Isadore Chambers told the panel on numerous occasions that new
police equipment was needed.
   Chambers has said that while the force has six radios for its
patrol cars, he often had as many as seven uniformed officers on
the streets. When a seventh officer is available, two members of
the force must share a car so both have access to a radio.
   East St. Louis, once a thriving industrial city, became one of
the nation's poorest with the decline of the industries and the
exodus of whites in the 1960s.
   Sixty-one percent of the city's 55,000 residents receive some
kind of public assistance, and about 40 percent of its citizens are
unemployed.
   Officials say the city's financial problems show no sign of
subsiding. It recently reached a $4 million settlement with a man
seriously beaten by another inmate in the city jail in 1985.
