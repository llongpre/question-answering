   People who do not own property may not be
excluded for that reason from membership on a public body empowered
to recommend a reorganization of local government, a unanimous
Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court declared unconstitutional the composition of the St.
Louis City-St. Louis County Board of Freeholders.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said a
land-ownership requirement for appointment to such a public agency
violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under law
for all people.
   ``The mere fact that the board of freeholders considers land-use
issues cannot suffice to sustain a land-ownership requirement in
this case,'' he said.
   The St. Louis freeholder board was created to write a proposed
charter for reorganizing the city and county government structure.
The board also was empowered to recommend new taxes to finance the
city and county governments.
   Any proposals by the board would be submitted to the voters in a
referendum.
   Board members were appointed by the mayor of St. Louis, the
county executive and the governor of Missouri.
   State Representative Robert J. Quinn, a St. Louis County resident
who does not own property, said his rights were violated by a state
constitutional requirement limiting membership on the freeholder
board to property owners.
   Quinn, in a suit on behalf of himself and all others in the city
and county who do not own property, said the exclusion violated the
U.S. Constitution's guarantee of freedom from unlawful
discrimination.
   But the Missouri Supreme Court ruled last year that the
constitutional protection does not apply because the freeholder
board does not have ``general governmental powers.''
   Blackmun said today that even though the freeholder board has a
limited role, that does not mean its composition can violate
constitutional protections against ``invidious discrimination.''
   The case is Quinn vs. Millsap, 88-1048.
