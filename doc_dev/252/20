<P>
Convicted murderer Winford Stokes was executed at the Potosi Correctional 
Center in Missouri for strangling and stabbing a woman to death in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St. 
Louis denied last-ditch requests to block the execution. Stokes, 39, was 
pronounced dead after receiving separate lethal injections of sodium pentathol, 
Pavlon and sodium chloride. He also had served time for the 1977 slaying of an 
elderly St. Louis woman and the fatal shooting of a St. Louis tavern owner in 
1969.
