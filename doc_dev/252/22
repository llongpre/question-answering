   A judge on Wednesday approved the sale of the
Chicago-to-St. Louis line of Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway
Co., ending fears of a shutdown during the company's bankruptcy
reorganization, its trustee said.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Schwartz made final a tentative
approval he had given last week to the purchase of CM&amp;W's
north-south line for $21.5 million by Rio Grande Industries Inc.,
the parent of Southern Pacific Railroad.
   The sale was endangered, with the threat of a shutdown in
service, late Tuesday when negotiations hit a snag, CM&amp;W trustee
Daniel Murray said.
   The snag occurred when Norfolk Southern Corp., the joint owner
of facilities with CM&amp;W, demanded at least $350,000 from contracts
signed before CM&amp;W declared bankruptcy in April 1988, Murray said.
   But that dispute and several other minor ones were resolved
Wednesday, he said.
   ``The closing is in the process of being completed right now,''
he said late Wednesday afternoon. ``We reached a resolution of the
dispute with Norfolk &amp; Western after negotiations last night and
this morning.''
   Norfolk Southern is the parent of Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co.
   Murray did not provide details on how the problem was resolved.
   ``There will be continuation of service on the line from Kansas
City to St. Louis,'' he said. ``Southern Pacific will take over the
north-south line. Service will continue uninterrupted.''
   CM&amp;W has 632 miles of track from Kansas City to Joliet, with
trackage rights into Chicago. The purchase affects the 282-mile
line running roughly from St. Louis to Chicago.
   Murray had said Tuesday that if negotiations to resolve the
dispute were not completed before the parties went before Schwartz
on Wednesday, the judge would probably have ordered the entire
railroad shut down at midnight.
   About 100 businesses in Illinois and Missouri would have been
affected by a shutdown. An estimated 300,000 people annually also
travel by Amtrak on CM&amp;W track between Chicago and St. Louis.
   The sale of the north-south line to Rio Grande came during
eleventh-hour negotiations last week. State officials stepped in to
mediate the deal and avert a possible shutdown.
   Citicorp North America Inc. and Heller Financial Inc., CM&amp;W's
chief creditors, had asked the court to cancel the CM&amp;W contract
with Amtrak on the north-south line because they said the railroad
was continuing to lose money on passenger service and had no
prospects for a successful reorganization.
   Murray said those creditors appeared to accept the deal and
voiced no objections in court.
   Rio Grande agreed to pay $1 million in start-up expenses and
assume responsibility for $11 million in loans the state of
Illinois made last year to keep struggling CM&amp;W afloat.
   The state, in turn, agreed to reduce interest rates on the
existing loans and extend their payoff periods, as well as forgive
another $2.5 million loan by changing it to a grant.
   Negotiations continued with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., which seeks
to purchase the CM&amp;W east-west lines that are used to haul freight
between St. Louis and Kansas City.
   The Wertheim cash proposal was expected to go before Schwartz on
Dec. 4, Murray said.
