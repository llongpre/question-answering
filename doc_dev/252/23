   Convicted killer Winford Stokes was executed
by lethal injection Friday night for strangling and stabbing a
woman to death 12 years ago.
   Both the U.S. Supreme Court and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in St. Louis denied last-ditch requests to block the
execution Friday.
   Stokes, 39, was pronounced dead at 9:39 p.m. CDT after receiving
separate lethal doses of sodium pentathol, Pavlon and sodium
chloride at the Potosi Correctional Center.
   He lifted his head to look at the IV bag as the first chemical
was being injected at 9:35 p.m. CDT, blinked his eyes rapidly and
lay back on the gurney.
   Stokes had no last words and had asked for no personal witnesses.
   ``Justice has been served. This regrettable event is necessary
to reaffirm the value the state of Missouri places on innocent
human life,'' Gov. John Ashcroft said in a prepared statement.
   Stokes was sentenced to death after being convicted of capital
murder in the February 1978 strangling and stabbing of 33-year-old
Pamela Benda of University City, outside St. Louis. Authorities
said Stokes, who had escaped from a mental hospital, killed Benda
after meeting her in a bar and going home with her to have sex.
   He also has served time for the 1977 slaying of an elderly St.
Louis woman and the fatal shooting of a St. Louis tavern owner in
1969.
   Stokes' wife, Evette, met with the condemned man for most of the
afternoon but left the prison shortly after 6 p.m., said Dale
Riley, prison spokesman.
   The full 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had refused Friday
morning to lift the stay. Attorney General William Webster promptly
turned to the Supreme Court.
   Even while the stay was in effect, prison officials continued to
prepare for the execution. Stokes ordered another last meal, his
second in two days.
   Riley said Stokes ordered catfish, french fries, cole slaw and a
two-liter bottle of Pepsi. He had had his first last meal of
sirloin steak, wild rice and Pepsi on Thursday.
   The Supreme Court issued its ruling lifting the stay about 7:15
p.m. CDT, and Sindel promptly asked both the 8th Circuit and the
Supreme Court to issue a second stay based on other arguments. Both
courts refused.
   An opinion concurring in the decision was signed by Justice
Anthony Kennedy, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justice
Antonin Scalia.
   Justice William Brennan was joined in a dissenting opinion by
Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun.
   Justice John Paul Stevens also dissented.
   Earlier Friday, another three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit
refused to lift the stay. That order was appealed to the full 8th
Circuit.
   Stokes' attorney, Richard Sindel, said U.S. District Judge
George Gunn Jr. granted the stay Wednesday on the basis of
arguments contending Stokes' trial court failed to differentiate
between felony murder and capital murder in its instructions.
   He was the third convict in Missouri and the 125th nationally to
be executed since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing
states to resume use of the death penalty.
