RAMS' CAMP TO OPEN IN EXPERIMENTAL MODE

Finding themselves submerged in a dynasty not their own, the Rams will open a 
training camp for rookies today knowing that all good things and teams must 
end. So is this the year or will San Francisco party again? 
</P>
<P>
More anxious than even Steve Young for quarterback Joe Montana to retire, the 
Rams are rebounding from their championship game knockout last January to 
presume again that the best days of the 49ers too shall pass, preferably 
against someone else's defensive secondary. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were quite the compliment collectors after last season's entertaining 
title run, emerging as possibly the NFL's second-best team -- small 
consolation. 
</P>
<P>
For sanity's sake, the Rams pretend not to notice their northern rivals in 
July, prefering self-examination. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they're the issue," Coach John Robinson said of the 49ers, 
resurrecting a familiar training camp tone. "I think they're the issue for 
external people, not for us. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to start this year -- and win the championship this year -- against 
all of the teams that we play. What we're striving to do is become a 
championship-level football team, not just focus on beating one team." 
</P>
<P>
Come December, though, the teams are inevitably linked because of their 
distinct rivalry and a divisional title they seek each season. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, in fact, calculates precisely a San Francisco mean streak that has 
produced consecutive Super Bowl titles. He notes accurately that the 49ers have 
won 24 of their last 27 games since a midseason slump in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"And we're two of those losses," he adds. "And certainly there was another one 
of those we could have won. We've played them four times (during the regular 
season) in that period and won twice. And it's been a phenomenal period, but it 
won't go on. But we cannot spend our time looking at someone else. We must 
spend our time looking at ourselves and improving ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Still, each measure of self-improvement is always in part a response to the 
maneuverings of the 49ers. The difference is that the Rams play their game of 
chess with limited funds, looking for garage-sale bargains while the 49ers 
spend money from their owner's fancy shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
This past off-season, the Rams signed free-agent quarterback Chuck Long, a 
former sore-armed, first-round draft choice of the Detroit Lions who never 
panned out. If Long pays off in Anaheim, he's the insurance policy answer to 
Young, San Francisco's talented backup. Young earns $1 million a season; Long, 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Robinson reached into the Plan B market, plucking tailback Curt Warner 
from Seattle, where he gained only 631 yards last season. At his best, Warner 
was among the game's elite runners. At 29, he battles doubts and leg injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is hoping that Warner, a passionate player and leader, will replace 
the emotionless statistical offerings of Greg Bell, who gained few yards in the 
clubhouse diplomacy game. Robinson sent Bell to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The Warner experiment, too, was cost-effective. They'll pay him less than 
$800,000 for the chance he'll bring to the Rams what veteran John Riggins 
brought to Washington after a late-career trade from the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a mistake," Robinson said of the Warner deal. "But I don't think 
it's a gamble. It didn't cost us anything. We didn't pay anything. We didn't 
give away a draft choice. Sports has millions of outstanding players who 
somebody said they're careers were over. Then, they make a move and there's an 
immediate resurgence. One could say that the jury's out. But it's not 
ill-conceived. It has a chance for some real success." 
</P>
<P>
If Warner fails or is injured, the running load is plopped into the lap of 
inexperience. Cleveland Gary's rookie season was a wash in 1989 after he 
reported to camp less than a week before the opener. Gaston Green's career has 
been a wash since the Rams made him their top pick in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson insists that Green has matured as a runner and will get a shot this 
summer. But time is running out on this costly investment. 
</P>
<P>
"For us it is," Robinson admitted. "I don't mean that as any kind of threat or 
anything. We've either got to use him or find a way for him to get somewhere 
where he can use his strengths. No question, he is physically different now 
than when he came. He wants desperately to play, (and) we're going to try to 
give him that opportunity. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to have to wait and see. Who knows about injuries? There's 
some question about Curt. Some people say he's all washed up. You don't know. 
There are three guys. I have three tailbacks all trying to prove themselves 
this year. So we will have some healthy competition." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing on offense compares to the competition on defense, where waves of young 
talent fight for a few positions. The Rams ranked 21st overall on defense and 
28th against the pass, although serious and numerous injuries last season 
muddled the true picture a bit. The Rams played the title game without six top 
defenders, but vast improvement on defense remains a must if the Rams wish to 
contend. In short, the wealth of talent acquired in the drafts of 1988 and '89 
must soon produce. The Rams were fortunate last season to get quality time from 
free-agent linebacker Brett Faryniarz and seventh-round linebacker George 
Bethune. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the young defenders on the hot-seat this season are linebacker Frank 
Stams, safety Anthony Newman and linemen Bill Hawkins and Brian Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to improve," Robinson said. "But I like the cast of 
characters. There's just a lot of unproven people. The scary thing would be to 
have a mediocre group and have them all back." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson envisions multiple defensive schemes and alignments this season to 
take advantage of all his personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, for example, have a strong run defense led by nose man Alvin Wright 
and ends Doug Reed and Mike Piel. But that unit gets burned too often on 
first-down passes. Robinson hopes to improve the situation by using either one 
or both of his twin towers, Smith and Hawkins, on early downs. Both are 
6-feet-6 and about 270 pounds. Hawkins and Smith also will team up as inside 
rushers on passing downs, and the hope is that the tandem will take some 
pressure off the secondary and the team's only true pass-rusher, Kevin Greene. 
</P>
<P>
"Our outside rush is OK," Robinson said. "Inside is where we need the help. In 
Minnesota, for example, (Keith) Millard is coming at you with the pass rush all 
the time. We're going to try to move in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams signed their 10th-round choice, defensive end Stephen Bates, Tuesday. 
He and sixth-round receiver Tim Stallworth are the only draft chices to sign so 
far. Bates, from James Madison, may be tried at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Safety Anthony Newman (elbow), defensive end Doug Reed (ankle), safety Vince 
Newsome (ankle) and defensive tackle Mike Piel (elbow) have recovered fully 
from injuries suffered late last season, Coach John Robinson said. Defensive 
tackle Bill Hawkins still isn't 100% after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery 
in December, but he is expected to be practicing at full speed by Aug. 1. The 
news isn't so good for third-year cornerback Cliff Hicks, who suffered knee 
damage last season. He is not expected back until September at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Two roster positions open this summer are at fourth wide receiver and punter. 
Veteran Hank Ilesic and rookie Kent Elmore figure to battle for Dale Hatcher's 
old punting job. . . . The veterans will report to training camp at UC Irvine 
on July 26. The Rams were forced out of Cal State Fullerton this year because 
construction has begun on a campus sports complex. . . . The team will spend 
two weeks at Rams Park before opening camp in Irvine, then leave a week later 
for an Aug. 11 exhibition game against the Kansas City Chiefs in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are the first NFL team to report to camp. It might be a while before 
the team's top three draft choices -- Bern Brostek, Pat Terrell and Latin Berry 
-- agree to terms. The Rams also have seven conditional free-agent veterans yet 
to sign, most notably Pro Bowl linebacker Kevin Greene, who has recorded 33 
sacks over the last two seasons. The others are linebacker Brett Faryniarz, 
tight ends Pete Holohan and Damone Johnson, safety Michael Stewart, nose tackle 
Alvin Wright and defensive end Doug Reed.
