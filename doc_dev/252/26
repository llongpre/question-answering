At the posh reception in the Golden Gate Way ballroom at the Hyatt Regency 
Saturday night, even the food symbolized the fan loyalties for the game between 
the Rams and 49ers, who face off under cloudy skies today for the NFC 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams people dug into pizza from a station at "Hollywood and Vine," 
surrounded by movie posters and stuffed pink flamingos. The 49ers piled their 
plates from a boatload of seafood a la Fisherman's Wharf. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Rams owner Georgia Frontiere swept into the party fashionably late, 
sparkling in an amethyst necklace and bead-splashed turquoise chiffon dress. 
"I'm so excited, I can hardly stand it," she said. "It's going to be the Rams 
all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Not all Rams fans can get invited to parties at the Hyatt. But the hundreds of 
Rams supporters who made it to San Francisco for the game to decide the NFC's 
Super Bowl team found the city teeming with football fever, undampened by the 
rainy weather. None of the Rams' fans lacked for spirit either. 
</P>
<P>
At San Francisco International Airport, Yvonne De Jon of Long Beach was decked 
in Ram colors -- a blue and gold Bermuda-style hat, with a football-helmet 
charm dangling from her neck, and a Rams' jacket. 
</P>
<P>
She and others gave a boisterous hello to the city when they arrived on a 
Saturday flight from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that for Joe Montana?" she gently chided an airport porter pushing a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"No way. Go 49ers," he shot back." 
</P>
<P>
De Jon and her friends arrived early enough on Saturday to greet Rams players 
as they checked into their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got on my (Rams) colors, right down to my blue bra," De Jon boasted. 
</P>
<P>
Closet Rams fans cropped up at the unlikeliest of places. At Candlestick Park, 
where the game will be played this afternoon, groundskeeper John Gilledo, 24, 
said he was only sporting a 49er hat because he works there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Rams fan," he said. "I have a hunch that they are going to win." 
</P>
<P>
Late Saturday night, 30 members of the Rams Booster Club climbed aboard a bus 
for a night of revelry. Waving a banner and blowing horns, the group charged 
into the lobby of the West Hotel at the airport, where the players are staying, 
in hopes of finding some of their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
"You blew it," a hotel clerk said. "You're about an hour late." 
</P>
<P>
But they were lucky enough to find defensive back Kevin Greene, who found 
himself surrounded by well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," Greene said. "We're getting great support. I'm happy to see 
all these smiling faces." 
</P>
<P>
Some Ram boosters made a stop by the offices of the San Francisco Chronicle, 
taping a banner to the window that read "Watch Out, the Rams Booster Club was 
here." They were steamed about an article in Saturday's paper describing them 
as lousy fans. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really mad," said Joanie Feria of Glendale. "We won't wear white shoes 
after Labor Day." That crack was in response to the article's suggestion that 
Ram fans were even bad dressers. 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of non-Ram fans in town, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate the Rams," said Manny Robleto, a San Francisco policeman. "I'm hoping 
it's going to be a 49er blowout." 
</P>
<P>
At the Hyatt party, 49er owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. apologized about the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry about the rainy weather," he told some Rams people. "I don't think it 
will affect the game that much. In fact, it may help the offense." 
</P>
<P>
The $40,000 party, attended by nearly 400, was for team owners, their staffs, 
sponsors, and the media. 
</P>
<P>
Someone jokingly noted the Hollywood theme and asked: Doesn't San Francisco 
know that the Rams are from Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
It was a festive mood, whatever the theme. But one element missing from the 6 
to 8 p.m. party was the players. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Beam, director of operations for the Rams, explained they were in team 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it's two hours of free time, when they'll go into their hotel rooms, 
watch some TV, and play some cards. They'll have their meal at 9:30 -- 
hamburgers, fried chicken, salads, that kind of stuff -- and curfew is at 11." 
</P>
<P>
Former Rams defensive end Jack Youngblood, now a Rams broadcaster, confided he 
would rather be resting up to play in the game instead of rubbing elbows. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd all like to be 28 and out there playing the game," he said. "It was a 
very exciting time for me, and right now I know the Rams are trying to relax. 
You get stressed out just trying to relax. Tomorrow morning, they will get up 
at 6 and drink six gallons of coffee, have a little breakfast and load up on 
the carbs (carbohydrates)." 
</P>
<P>
For those without tickets, the 49ers booster club was selling them for $300 
each. Some of the Rams booster club members were worried they would get tickets 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until Wednesday that 18 tickets were made available to them. And that 
was only because booster president Larry Kenemore called Georgia Frontiere at 
her hotel in New York. The club actually wound up getting more tickets through 
the 49ers booster club, which made 50 tickets available at the regular price. 
</P>
<P>
Two Ram fans, Beth Fisher, 14, and her sister, Karilyn Fisher, 21, had a 
special reason for making the trip. They got a call from Coach John Robinson 
himself after the Rams beat the Giants last week. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Fisher said he told them: "Make plans for San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is engaged to their mother, Linda Fisher, owner of a modeling agency 
in Anaheim. The daughters said they think the wedding will be next month. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually just go to home games, so this is real exciting," Beth Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams supporters were having fun, but anxious for victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams are going to be the team of the '90s," predicted Jim Ort, a charter 
member of the Booster Club. 
</P>
<P>
But most fans will likely agree with 49ers owner DeBartolo. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is it's going to be a great game," he said.
