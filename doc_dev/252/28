   Southern Pacific Transportation Co. will
pay $22 million in cash to purchase the St. Louis to Chicago rail
line of the Chicago, Missouri &amp; Western Railway Co., officials
announced Thursday.
   The CM&amp;W railway submitted the preliminary sale agreement to
Chief Bankruptcy Judge John D. Schwartz in Chicago, said Daniel R.
Murray, trustee of CM&amp;W.
   Southern Pacific, a unit of Rio Grande Industries Inc., agreed
to buy the 282-mile line through Springfield and Bloomington, Ill.,
and to assume $7 million in debt owed by CM&amp;W to the state of
Illinois, he said. CM&amp;W is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Under the terms of the agreement, the trustee would retain the
CM&amp;W lines from Kansas City, Mo., to Springfield and to Godfrey,
Ill., as well as a 50 percent interest in the lines from eastern
St. Louis to Godfery. The St. Louis and Kansas City lines meet in
Godfrey.
   Schwartz referred the matter to the Interstate Commerce
Commission and has set Sept. 13 for a further hearing.
   ``This purchase, along with acquisition of the Soo Line's Kansas
City-Chicago route which we negotiated in June, will give Southern
Pacific access from two major routes to Chicago markets and,
through Chicago, important routes for customers across the
nation,'' said Mike Mohan, president of San Francisco-based
Southern Pacific.
   Rio Grande Industries, which also owns the Denver and Rio Grande
Western railroads, last month announced it had agreed to buy 532
miles of railroad between Kansas City and Chicago from the Soo Line
Corp. An application to the ICC for approval of the sale is being
prepared.
