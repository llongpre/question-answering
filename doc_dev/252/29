   An eighth-grade dropout convicted of
murdering a woman 12 years ago after meeting her at a bar was put
to death by lethal injection.
   Winford Stokes, 39, was pronounced dead at 9:39 p.m. CDT Friday
after receiving lethal doses of sodium pentothal, Pavlon and sodium
chloride at the Potosi Correctional Center.
   The U.S. Supreme Court and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
had denied last-ditch requests to block the execution.
   Stokes was sentenced for the Feb. 18, 1978, strangling and
stabbing of 33-year-old Pamela Benda, a waitress from University
City, a St. Louis suburb.
   Stokes, who had escaped from a mental hospital, killed Benda
after meeting her in a bar and going to her apartment for sex.
   Stokes previously had been convicted in the 1977 slaying of an
elderly St. Louis woman and the shooting death of a St. Louis
tavern owner in 1969.
   His wife, Evette, met with the condemned man for most of the
afternoon, prison spokesman Dale Riley said. Stokes had no last
words and asked for no personal witnesses at his execution.
   After the curtains to the death chamber viewing area were
opened, Stokes lifted his head to look at the witnesses and the IV
bag from which the lethal chemical flowed. Then he blinked his eyes
rapidly and lay back on the gurney.
   ``Justice has been served. This regrettable event is necessary
to reaffirm the value the state of Missouri places on innocent
human life,'' Gov. John Ashcroft said in a prepared statement.
   Stokes was the third person put to death in Missouri since 1976,
when the Supreme Court ruled that states could resume carrying out
the death penalty. He was the 125th person in the nation executed
since then.
