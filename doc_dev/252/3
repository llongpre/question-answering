Considering the task at hand, maybe 5,600 miles isn't far enough from home for 
George Seifert, who makes his pro head coaching debut tonight (Sunday, Japan 
time) when the San Francisco 49ers face the Rams in American Bowl '89 at the 
Tokyo Dome. 
</P>
<P>
As it was soon discovered this week, not even crossing the international 
dateline helps. Eager to show the world they've done their homework on a 
strange game that certainly is not baseball, the Japanese were curious to know, 
foremost, what it felt like to replace a legend. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert might have referred them to the new emperor. Instead, he worked his way 
deftly through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we start in this profession, we all tend to live with it," Seifert said 
of handling pressure. "Whether as a head coach, or assistant coaches and 
obviously, the players. That becomes a way of life to us." 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that Bill Walsh, who coached the 49ers to three Super Bowl 
titles in the 1980s, no longer even hovers in the front office, having recently 
accepted a broadcasting position with NBC. Only the memories of a genius and 
his sweaters remain. 
</P>
<P>
Undramatically, tonight's game should prove little, other than to see how well 
Seifert handles the pregame interviews and sideline headset. The game itself is 
pure ceremony, marking the third consecutive season the Rams will play five 
exhibition games instead of the customary four. It's the second overseas 
exhibition in two years for the 49ers, who faced the Miami Dolphins in London 
last summer. All for the betterment of humanity, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry on the field has long been heated, but what about these owners, 
Edward DeBartolo Jr. and Georgia Frontiere, who have been duking it out in the 
game of international diplomacy? 
</P>
<P>
DeBartolo is already challenging Frontiere to a game next year in Milan, Italy. 
Although the Ram owner is interested, she concedes that she may need some time 
to think it over. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the owners have asked coaches Seifert and the Rams' John Robinson to 
put something interesting together for their hosts, which is easier said than 
done. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could be missing seven offensive starters because of injury or 
holdout. Tailback Greg Bell, tight end Damone Johnson and guard Duval Love are 
back on the mainland, poring over negotiating strategies. Flanker-tight end 
Pete Holohan is out with a bad knee, and left guard Tom Newberry and wide 
receiver Aaron Cox have hamstring pulls. Receivers Henry Ellard and Ron Brown 
are doubtful with back and hamstring problems, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
So how can a game live up to its billing? 
</P>
<P>
"You get the feeling their expectations of the game are very high," Ram 
quarterback Jim Everett said of the Japanese. "I think all we can do is play as 
aggressive and hard as we can and hopefully win." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson will do his best to squeeze two quarters out of his starting 
quarterback. No one said show business was easy. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have a cultural show for the Japanese people," Robinson said. 
"But we don't want to embarrass ourselves. We have mixed goals. We'd like to 
play a lot of people and we'd like to have some rhythm. I think you worry about 
the first game, you know, getting the snap from center." 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, the Rams' offense will be equally matched by the 49er defense, 
which is missing cornerbacks Don Griffin and Tim McKyer, end Larry Roberts, 
linebacker Charles Haley and strong safety Jeff Fuller, all of whom are 
negotiating contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Go out and have a hot dog when we have the ball," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana, Super Bowl hero, will start at quarterback for the 49ers and no 
doubt draw the most attention. His legend stretches across the Pacific and was 
further enhanced by Robinson at an opening-night news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"In Joe Montana, you will see one of the great players ever to play this game," 
Robinson said. "He certainly has been the best quarterback to play in my time 
in the NFL, and I think he will go down in history as perhaps the best 
quarterback of all time." 
</P>
<P>
Does Joe dare throw an incompletion? And what of the transition from Walsh to 
Seifert, a nine-year 49er assistant and the team's defensive coordinator since 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference isn't as great as everyone believes," Montana said. "George has 
been in this organization and has been the major reason for our winning. 
Everybody knows what he can do and respects him. For us, it doesn't seem like 
that much of a change. I think there's a little transition in the beginning, 
but practices are going along as usual." 
</P>
