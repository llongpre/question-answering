<HEAD>Supreme Court Ruling Sends Woman Across State Line For Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>

   A woman carrying a severely deformed fetus was
left with a choice of a 250-mile trip to get an abortion or going
to another state because of the Supreme Court's ruling on
Missouri's abortion law, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   In its ruling July 3, the U.S. Supreme Court said Missouri can
bar public hospitals from performing abortions. Within hours of
that decision, Truman Medical Center, a public hospital in Kansas
City, ordered its doctors to stop performing abortions.
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that a 24-year-old woman
was referred to a specialist at Truman who confirmed through tests
that the 19-week-old fetus she was carrying had deformities that
made survival outside the womb impossible. A doctor familiar with
the case told the newspaper the fetus' heart was outside the chest
wall and that its abdominal organs were outside the abdominal wall.
   ``Before the Supreme Court decision, she would have had a
therapeutic abortion at Truman,'' said Dr. Howard Schwartz, an
obstetrician and gynecologist who was a consultant on the case.
   Truman was believed to be the only site in Kansas City where
second-trimester abortions were widely available before the Supreme
Court ruling. After the ruling, the nearest clinic in Missouri
where the woman could have gotten a second-trimester abortion was
across the state in St. Louis, a 250-mile drive.
   Instead, the woman was referred to Comprehensive Health for
Women, a private gynecological clinic in nearby Overland Park,
Kan., a Kansas City suburb about 20 miles away.
   The fetus was aborted in a two-day procedure July 11 and 12, and
the woman's insurance company paid for it.
   Schwartz said he thought the woman's abortion was the first of
what would ``turn out to be many cases of Missouri women crossing
to another state or traveling to St. Louis to obtain abortions.''
   Adele Hughey, executive director of Comprehensive Health, said
abortion was the woman's ``only real option.''
   ``The condition of the fetus was totally incompatible with
life,'' Hughey said. ``She could have carried the fetus through the
entire term of pregnancy, knowing that the outcome would be a dead
baby, or have an abortion and then try to get pregnant again. But
by carrying the fetus to term, she might have jeopardized her own
health and also delayed another pregnancy.''
