   The city's new daily newspaper, the St. Louis
Sun, is scheduled to hit the streets Sept. 25, its owner says.
   ``We're right on budget and right on schedule,'' Ralph Ingersoll
II, the newspaper's chairman and editor in chief, said at a news
conference Tuesday in the Sun's downtown newsroom overlooking the
Mississippi River and the Gateway Arch.
   The Sun, a morning tabloid, will cost 25 cents every day except
Saturday when it will publish an expanded weekend edition that will
sell for $1 and include two glossy magazines and advertising
supplements.
   The Washington Times, a newspaper owned by affiliates of the
South Korean-based Unification Church headed by Rev. Sun Myung
Moon, was the last major metropolitan newspaper to be started in
the United States. It began in 1982.
   Ingersoll, chairman of the Princeton, N.J.-based Ingersoll
Publications Co., said the Sun hopes to lead the way in the
newspaper industry with its expanded Saturday edition.
   ``Changing lifestyles and workplace habits convince us that
Saturday morning will continue to increase in importance as the
prime time for weekend newspaper publication,'' he said.
   Ingersoll's publishing company owns 40 daily and 150 non-daily
newpapers in the United States and also publishes 14 papers in
England and Ireland. The company employs 11,000 people.
   It also operates a chain of suburban newspapers in the St. Louis
area, which Ingersoll said has helped the Sun get started.
   The Sun will compete with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which has
operated alone in the city since 1986 when its longtime rival, the
St. Louis Globe-Democrat, folded.
   The Post-Dispatch has a circulation of 371,000 during the week
and 551,000 on Sunday. It costs a quarter during the week and its
Sunday edition costs $1.
   Ingersoll said the Sun hopes to have 75,000 subscribers
immediately and will be able to break even if circulation climbs to
100,000. He said he's not looking to pass the Post-Dispatch in
circulation numbers.
   The new newspaper has hired about a third of its editorial staff
and has trained its display advertising staff, which will begin
selling ads soon, Ingersoll said.
   A sample front-page showed a bright and colorful layout with
only headlines and teasers promoting sports, business and other
news stories inside the paper.
