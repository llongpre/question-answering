SPORTS ET CETERA: HOLIDAY BOWL ON A SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in the game's history, the Sea World Holiday Bowl this year 
will be played on a Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 13th annual game will be played at 4:30 p.m. Dec. 29, also the earliest 
kickoff in its history, the game committee announced. 
</P>
<P>
"The weekend date means local fans will not have to battle rush-hour traffic to 
get to the stadium, and those coming from out of the area will also find 
Saturday a more convenient date," Holiday Bowl President L. Robert Payne said.

INDOOR SOCCER

Milan Mandaric, owner of the MISL St. Louis Storm, said he is optimistic that 
his team will not fold, as has been rumored, and set Monday as the date a 
decision will be made on the future of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Mandaric, who lives in San Jose, has been looking for St. Louis investors for 
his financially ailing team. He said "some" St. Louis business leaders have 
come forward and that St. Louis Mayor Vince Schoemehl has begun soliciting 
support on Mandaric's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things are happening in the last minute," Mandaric said Friday. "The 
mayor of the city and others want to give some support to the club, and I'm 
waiting to see how things develop." 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the eight-team league could hinge on that of St. Louis. Other 
owners reportedly do not want to go forward with just seven teams.

SWIMMING 
</P>
<P>
Poway High School, whose boys' and girls' swimming teams have won San Diego 
Section titles the past two years, both earned spots in the National 
Interscholastic Swimming Coaches of American TNT Power Ranking poll. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan boys were ranked ninth nationally among public schools with over 
1,900 students and 20th among all public schools but dropped to 28th nationally 
when independents were included. The girls were ranked 14th, 28th and 33rd.
