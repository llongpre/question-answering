   In the newsroom of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
editors, reporters and clerks left their desks and gathered around a
microphone to hear a talk from the chief.
   ``Our confidence is strong, our spirits are high, our adrenalin
is running and we've done this without steroids,'' said Joseph
Pulitzer, Jr., chairman of the Pulitzer Publishing Co. and grandson
of the founder of the Post-Dispatch.
   It was a pep talk for the journalism troops who are preparing to
begin the nation's newest newspaper war, a battle the newspaper
industry is watching closely.
   The confrontation starts Monday when the tabloid newcomer, the
St. Louis Sun, owned and edited by Ralph Ingersoll II, hits the
street.
   Ingersoll, whose Ingersoll Publications Co. owns a chain of 43
free weekly or bi-weekly newspapers with a circulation of 700,000 in
the suburbs of St. Louis, is trying to buck the trend of newspapers
closing up or merging because they can't attract enough readers or
advertising to make money.
   So far, the specter of competition has been good for the historic
Post-Dispatch, which will be 111 years old in December, said
Nicholas G. Penniman IV, the newspaper's publisher.
   The paid daily circulation of the newspaper has been steadily
increasing this summer, Penniman said. Compared with the same period
last year, daily circulation is up about 8,000 and Sunday
circulation has increased by about 15,000.
   ``Part of the increase is because of baseball, part of it is
because we are making aggressive attempts to sell the Post-Dispatch,
and thirdly, I think people appreciate the Post-Dispatch and enjoy
it,'' he said.
   Penniman said the Post-Dispatch now has a daily circulation of
about 380,000 and a Sunday circulation of about 565,000. The Sun
hopes to have at least 75,000 subscribers at the outset; it already
has signed up more than 50,000, said Robert M. Jelenic, president
and chief executive of the Sun.
   Penniman said that as far as the Post-Dispatch can tell, it has
lost only 50 subscribers to the Sun, and the amount spent on retail
advertising by the Post-Dispatch's 10 largest accounts is up about 5
percent from last year.
   Meanwhile, in the Post-Dispatch newsroom, ideas and ideals have
been flying.
   ``It's a little bit like an athletic competition,'' said David
Lipman, the managing editor. ``There's no question there's a sense
of anticipation and excitement about the competition.''
   He said the Sun has allowed editors to make changes that had been
proposed for at least a year, including increasing sports and
business coverage and adding a news summary.
   The Post-Dispatch also has redesigned several sections of the
paper and hired a full-time writing coach, longtime chief copy
editor Harry Levins.
   Lipman said the changes were not made to match the Sun, which has
touted itself as planning to be a colorful, easy-to-read ``laptop''
newspaper with extra emphasis on sports.
   ``We would have made these changes whether there was some new
competition or not,'' he said. `'We are going to continue putting
out an ever-improving newspaper no matter what distractions or
attractions come to St. Louis.''
   Expectations of St. Louis residents toward the two newspapers may
differ, according to Charles Klotzer, editor of the St. Louis
Journalism Review.
   `'I think the first questions that are asked about the Sun and
the Post-Dispatch depict immediately how the newspapers are viewed
in the community,'' Klotzer said.
   ``When we talk about the Sun, we ask, `Do you think it's going to
make a profit,' and when we talk about the Post-Dispatch, we ask,
`Do you think it's going to be a better newspaper.'''
   Penniman, speaking to a recent Missouri newspaper meeting, said
some people believe ``we'll be like the 800-pound gorilla and crush
the Sun.'' But he added that this would not be true.
   ``We don't want to be the only paper in St. Louis, we want to be
the best,'' he said.
