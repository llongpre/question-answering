<TEXT>
<P>
So the 49ers won at Anaheim Stadium and the Rams won at Candlestick Park. What 
else is new? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don't blame this one on Cleveland Gary. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire shouldn't have to apologize for trading Hubie Brooks and keeping a 
younger and better hitter, Kal Daniels. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Less than 48 hours after the Dodgers dealt Brooks to the New York Mets for Bob 
Ojeda, they sang happy birthday to Ojeda at a Stadium Club news conference and 
wheeled out a cake big enough for 33 candles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Gary Carter would be a good pickup for a team whose candidates to back up 
catcher Mike Scioscia are Carlos Hernandez and Barry Lyons. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger-Giant rivalry is bound to heat up this season when Brett Butler-Kal 
Daniels-Darryl Strawberry-Eddie Murray are matched against Willie McGee-Will 
Clark-Kevin Mitchell-Matt Williams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
So much for the depiction of Peter O'Malley as an owner who is satisfied to 
have a winning team that makes money and won't spend that extra buck to win a 
pennant. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You would have thought that the Angels finished first in the American League 
West last season, not 23 games out in fourth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jack (the Ripper) Clark, a pull-hitting right-handed slugger, seems made to 
order for Fenway Park. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson's 88-yard run against Cincinnati was only the third-longest of his 
Raider career. He went 92 against the Bengals last year and 91 at Seattle in 
1987. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Eric Dickerson of the Indianapolis Colts each gained 117 yards 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was that Bo carried the ball eight times at the Coliseum and 
Dickerson 28 times against the New York Jets at the Meadowlands. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No Los Angeles NFL running back has been as exciting as Jackson since Jaguar 
Jon Arnett was dodging, darting and dashing for the Rams from 1957-63. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All four quarterbacks who went down over the weekend -- Jim Kelly, Phil Simms, 
Jim Harbaugh and Steve DeBerg -- were playing on artificial turf. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bears were more fun to watch when Mike Ditka was throwing temper 
tantrums on the sideline. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Peter Tom Willis, the rookie from Florida State, should develop into the best 
of the Bear quarterbacks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Smiling Rodney Peete seems to enjoy his work. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The New England Patriots aren't as good as their record would indicate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Late-season NFL cliche: "We can control our own destiny." . . . 
</P>
<P>
You know the Broncos are having a lousy season when there are 11,042 no-shows 
for a game against San Diego at Denver. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There have been 13 sellouts for hockey at the Forum this season and only one 
for basketball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Twenty Washington football players were named first- or second-team or 
honorable mention All-Pacific 10. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The new cradle of college football coaches is UCLA. Six of Terry Donahue's 
former assistants are head coaches -- Jim Colletto at Purdue, Gary Blackney at 
Bowling Green, Rich Brooks at Oregon, Dick Tomey at Arizona, Steve Axman at 
Northern Arizona and Don Riley at East Tennessee State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Roy Firestone got three standing ovations -- and several sitting -- on opening 
night at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All is peaceful in Naples, where Diego Maradona has returned to the starting 
eleven. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Harry Ornest, the former owner of the St. Louis Blues who was involved in a 
scuffle with John Forsythe in the Hollywood Park Turf Club on Sunday, must have 
seen too many hockey fights. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KO magazine rates Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez, who defends his World Boxing 
Council light-flyweight title against Rolando Pascua Wednesday at the Forum, as 
the most feared fighter in the world. Ranked behind the 108-pound slugger are 
the considerably bigger Michael Moorer and Mike Tyson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing, who is eligible to become a restricted free agent next season, 
will make at least $5.7 million if he stays with New York. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Seattle would like to deal Dale Ellis as soon as he returns to the court and 
displays his old skills. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland, seeking a replacement for Mark Price, is among those teams 
interested in Minnesota guard Pooh Richardson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Detroit isn't quite the same without James Edwards, who is injured. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Morton Downey Jr., the controversial former TV talk show host, was one of the 
organizers of the old American Basketball Assn. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's No. 5 ranking in basketball is the Bruins' highest since late in the 
1982-83 season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Forum claims to have broken even financially on its first Chicago show, but 
the local favorite, junior welterweight Louie Lomeli, got knocked out in the 
first round. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Pete Sampras doesn't watch out, he'll give men's professional tennis a good 
name.
