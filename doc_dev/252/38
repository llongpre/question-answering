   Up to 40,000 people in St. Louis rallied to demonstrate their
hope the U.S. Supreme Court will overturn the 1973 decision that
legalized abortions, and more than 100 anti-abortion protesters
were arrested in Cleveland.
   In Pittsburgh, about 4,000 people sang and prayed, carrying
balloons and placards during an anti-abortion rally in the city's
Market Square. The protesters paraded through the downtown shopping
area in a light rain Saturday during the 10th Annual Greater
Pittsburgh March for Life.
   The St. Louis demonstrators gathered at Kiener Plaza on Sunday
without incident and no arrests were made, said police Lt. Roy
Miller.
   Organizers called it the largest anti-abortion rally in St.
Louis. But several police officers at the scene and pro-choice
supporters disagreed with the official crowd estimate. They said
only about 5,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were on hand.
   In Cleveland, 119 protesters were arrested Saturday outside of
two abortion clinics. They were charged with aggravated disorderly
conduct, resisting arrest and criminal trespassing.
   Edward J. Heben Jr., a lawyer representing the protesters, said
his clients planned to plead innocent to all charges today in
Cleveland Municipal Court.
   St. Louis demonstrators marched several blocks through downtown,
some holding balloons and banners. One teen-age girl carried a sign
saying, ``Thanks, Mom!''
   The ``Show-Me Life'' rally came several weeks after the U.S.
Supreme Court heard arguments in a Missouri abortion case that
could be used to overturn the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision that
legalized the procedure in 1973.
   The court is expected to announce its decision this summer in
that case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services.
   The Missouri law at issue, passed in 1986, declares that human
life begins at conception. It restricts abortion by banning the
procedure in publicly financed hospitals and by forbidding the use
of public funds.
   Loretto Wagner of Missouri Citizens for Life said rally
organizers hoped to impress the Supreme Court with the number of
people who attended the St. Louis event.
   During the rally, about 85 pro-choice supporters stood across
from Kiener Plaza. One woman carried a giant white coat hanger with
the messages ``Never again'' and ``Keep abortion safe and legal.''
   ``We just wanted to be a thorn in their side, to keep them
honest,'' said Brooke Petersen, a board member of the Missouri
affiliate of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   The anti-abortion rally was sponsored by Missouri Citizens for
Life, along with the Archdiocesan Pro-Life Committee, the Christian
Action Council and Clergy for Life.
