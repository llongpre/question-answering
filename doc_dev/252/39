When it came time to pull two first-round triggers, the Rams were left stunned 
at what remained on Sunday's draft table. So they stalked and talked and darn 
near balked, waiting until waning seconds before finally turning to Miami 
Twice. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't supposed to be so difficult. The Rams were almost locked into Miami 
defensive end Bill Hawkins at pick 21, but were forced to reconsider with so 
many blue-chippers left. 
</P>
<P>
Gnashing teeth as minutes passed, the Rams were left to ponder: How do you not 
take cornerback Louis Oliver, considered a top 10 pick in most circles? Or 
receiver Andre Rison? Or fullback Cleveland Gary? What were the Rams doing with 
this incredible opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
Panicking, as it turns out. With only 16 seconds left to choose in their 
allotted 15 minutes, the Rams scribbled Hawkins' name on some paper and raced 
it to the podium. 
</P>
<P>
They resisted temptation in the end and stuck to their guns, passing on the 
best-available athlete theory to fill a long-standing need at defensive end. It 
seemed a victory for the coaching staff, defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur in 
particular. This wasn't a public relations pick. 
</P>
<P>
So Bill Hawkins it was. He's tall (6-6) and lean (265) and was a three-year 
starter for the Hurricanes, who lost one football game the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a chance to develop into the big-time pass rusher we've always talked 
about but never found," Ram Coach John Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson wasn't out of the woods yet. 
</P>
<P>
Five picks later at 26, Miami fullback Cleveland Gary was still on the board 
and flashing like neon lights in front of Robinson's eyes. The Rams were still 
thinking defense, or maybe tight end. But not a fullback. Only minutes before, 
Robinson said that Robert Delpino, last year's rookie sensation, was a 
perfectly capable fullback. 
</P>
<P>
But this time the Rams couldn't pass on a big-name talent. They used every 
second of their 15 minutes and finally decided on Gary, passing over Auburn 
tight end Lawyer Tillman and Tennessee linebacker Keith DeLong. 
</P>
<P>
Just what the Rams need, another running back. But Robinson coached Gary in the 
Senior Bowl and claims he's one of the best receiving backs to come out of 
college in years. 
</P>
<P>
Gary wasn't as thrilled over the developments, figuring he never should have 
lasted long enough to become a Ram. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I'd be there," said Gary, who considered himself a top 10 pick. 
"But the decision's been made and I'm and L.A. Ram. I love it. . . . You have 
to prepare for things like that. I'm elated that it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Next question: Are there enough footballs to go around? The Rams are suddenly 
well-stocked in the backfield, Gary joining a team that includes Greg Bell, 
Delpino, Buford McGee and last year's first round choice, Gaston Green. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson seems to think he can keep everyone happy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an area that we once did not have any depth," Robinson said. "We now have 
depth. This isn't a game where you can have one deep. It just isn't." 
</P>
<P>
But doesn't something have to give? Is Greg Bell on the trading block? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
What about Gary being a makeup pick for Green, who played sparingly as a 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard one genius say that it's indicative of our feelings for Gaston Green," 
Robinson responded. "But that's way off. It's not even close." 
</P>
<P>
Only time will tell whether the Rams will regret taking Gary over DeLong, a Ram 
favorite who went two picks later to the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
A brief look at the rest of the Rams' Sunday picks: 
</P>
<P>
Second Round 
</P>
<P>
45th choice -- Frank Stams, linebacker, Notre Dame. The final payoff for Eric 
Dickerson, Stams gives the Rams another outside pass rusher to go with Hawkins. 
Robinson compares Stams to the NFL's second-leading quarterback sacker last 
season. Lawrence Taylor? Bruce Smith? No, Kevin Greene, remember? The Rams' 
outside linebacker finished with 16 1/2, trailing only Reggie White of the 
Philadelphia Eagles for the league lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We see him like Kevin Greene," Robinson said of Stams. "He came off the corner 
for Notre Dame much like Kevin Greene did for us." 
</P>
<P>
Stams is a converted fullback and one of several prime-time players from Notre 
Dame's national championship defense. He led the Irish with seven sacks in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
One knock on Stams is his inability to drop into pass coverage. The Rams 
knocked on wood. Robinson spoke of Stams as if he were a son. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm not supposed to get emotionally involved with guys," he said. "But I 
really feel good about this guy." 
</P>
<P>
48th pick -- Brian Smith, defensive end/linebacker, Auburn. Like Hawkins, Smith 
is 6-foot-6, giving the Rams a pair of ends who can peer over a line of 
scrimmage for a change; unlike say, a Donald Evans. Rams' personnel director 
John Math calls Smith "747" because of his large wing span. He's also been 
called "String Bean," but that's what weight rooms are for. Smith is listed at 
245 pounds, though Robinson envisions him at 270 pounds some day. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a Richard Dent-type," said Robinson, careful not to actually compare 
Smith to the Chicago Bears' All-Pro. 
</P>
<P>
53rd pick -- Darryl Henley, cornerback, UCLA. He returns to a Bruin reunion 
that includes Gaston Green, James Washington, Flipper Anderson, Duval Love, et 
al. At 5-feet-8 and 165 pounds, Henley lacks size and muscle, but could be the 
punt returner the Rams have been looking for since receiver Henry Ellard became 
too valuable to risk returning kicks. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great punt returner, and that's very positive for us," Robinson said. 
"His lack of size probably kept him from being a first-round corner. He played 
like a first-round corner." 
</P>
<P>
Henley's best shot this season seems to be as a nickel-back player. 
</P>
<P>
Third Round 
</P>
<P>
75th pick overall -- Kevin Robbins, offensive tackle, Michigan State. Right 
now, he's just the answer to Tony Mandarich's trivia question: Name the other 
tackle at Michigan State last season. Yes, it was Robbins, who pales in 
comparison to Mandarich at only 6-foot-4 and 286 pounds. Robbins, however, was 
an Academic All-Big 10 Conference selection. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth Round 
</P>
<P>
102nd pick overall -- Jeff Carlson, quarterback, Weber State. A local product 
from Pacifica High School in Cypress, Carlson could be that developmental 
quarterback Robinson was talking about. The lefthander passed for more than 
5,000 yards in his college career. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth Round 
</P>
<P>
135th pick overall -- Alfred Jackson, cornerback, San Diego State. A wide 
receiver in college, Jackson will compete for a spot in a very crowded Rams 
secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
As exected, Robinson said Sunday he would soon meet with veteran linebacker 
Carl Ekern, 34, and fullback Mike Guman, 31, and probably ask both to retire. . 
. . Darryl Henley is the brother of Thomas, a free-agent receiver recently 
signed by the Rams.
