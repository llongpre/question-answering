<P>
As exhibitions go, Saturday night's American Bowl '89 at the Tokyo Dome wasn't 
worth the price of admission, but then, game programs were selling for more 
than $14. 
</P>
<P>
You couldn't tell the players without a program, for 2,000 yen. Yet, a 
standing-room-only crowd of 43,896, some of whom paid $200 a seat for the 
privilege, seemed equally amused and impressed by the Rams' 16-13 overtime 
victory over the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
On his fourth chance, kicker Mike Lansford kicked a 29-yard field game as time 
expired in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The fans here, who haven't seen a professional football game played on home 
soil in 13 years, reacted mightily to every moment and movement, from violent 
collisions on the field to the acrobatics of the Rams' baton twirler. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're a great crowd and were excited to see American football," Ram 
quarterback Jim Everett said. "As players, we were excited to get the chance to 
play in front of them." 
</P>
<P>
Too excited, as it turned out. The game actually spilled into extra minutes, 
the last thing either team wanted with Typhoon No. 13 sweeping toward Tokyo and 
chartered flights awaiting them at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford had a chance to win it for the Rams with 5:48 left in overtime, but 
his 27-yard field-goal attempt was blocked by Wesley Walls. 
</P>
<P>
He had another shot with less than a minute remaining, but Walls again blocked 
his attempt, this one from 24 yards. However, Ram tackle Kevin Robbins was 
called for a false start before the block, and Lansford set up again from 29 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
A third attempt was also blocked, but both teams were called for false starts, 
and the down was replayed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Lansford connected and sent the Rams to the airport. But the Rams and 
49ers did their best to mess up complicated logistics that were months in the 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the third quarter, with the 49ers on the Rams' goal line with a 13-6 
lead, rookie Frank Stams recovered a Terrence Flagler fumble at the seven and 
sent the momentum the other way. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams drove 93 yards from there and scored on Robert Delpino's one-yard run 
that tied the score with 8:18 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Starting quarterbacks Everett and Joe Montana were long gone by then, having 
finished up their tuneups in the second quarter. Both were sharper than might 
have been expected so early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Montana completed eight of 13 passes for 81 yards, while Everett finished with 
five of nine for 69 yards and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a start in the right direction," Everett said. "I didn't like the way my 
performance ended with a pass interception, but again, it's only our first 
preseason game." 
</P>
<P>
And a time to shake the rust from a few Rams. In fact, some would be 
hard-pressed to name the Rams' backup quarterback last year. 
</P>
<P>
He attempted only five passes all season, completing four for 38 yards. His 
name is Mark Herrmann, and he was impressive in his longest stint since joining 
the Rams as a free agent last summer. To give you a hint of how well Everett 
was going in 1988, Herrmann didn't appear in the team's last eight games last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, he stepped in and looked at home in the offense, exactly what 
offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese had in mind when he suggested that the Rams 
rescue Herrmann from football's unemployment line. He had learned Zampese's 
complicated offense in San Diego, and the Rams' figured it was easier to bring 
in Herrmann than to break in a new quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann completed 16 of 29 passes for 186 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The other star of the night was tailback Gaston Green, the team's first-round 
draft choice a year ago, who shook off some heavy cobwebs. He shared the 
tailback spot with Delpino and finished with 28 carries for 116 yards, nearly 
surpassing in one game his totals for the entire 1988 season, when Green 
carried 35 times for 117 yards. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Montana and Everett exchanged enough fire to get their teams 
into kickingrange. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers scored on a 33-yard field goal by Mike Cofer with 6:03 left in the 
quarter, capping a nine-play, 41-yard drive. The Rams came back and tied the 
score during their next possession on a 32-yarder by Lansford. 
</P>
<P>
Montana then picked his way up the field, hitting Jerry Rice for 18 yards and 
John Taylor for 19 on successive completions. The 49ers stalled at the Ram 22, 
and Cofer's 39-yard field goal gave San Francisco a 6-3 lead with 11:15 left in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Young replaced Montana on the 49ers' first possession of the second 
quarter. On first down from his own 36, Young took off on a 41-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
After escaping the rush, he cut his way through the middle before breaking down 
the right sideline. The biggest collision on the run was Young crashing into a 
Japanese photographer as he was forced out of bounds at the Ram 19. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers scored two plays after Young's run. Flagler broke left from the 15 
and had the ball stripped from his arms by safety James Washington at the 
three, the ball bounding toward the end zone. Ram cornerback Clifford Hicks had 
the ball in his hands before it squirted free and into the arms of receiver 
Terry Greer, who recovered in the end zone, giving the 49ers a 13-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann, who replaced Everett in the second quarter, then drove the Rams 68 
yards in eight plays into field-goal range. Lansford's 25-yarder with 2:11 left 
cut the deficit to seven before the half. On the drive, Herrmann completed 
three of four passes, including a 47-yard play to rookie Mike Williams, the 
team's 10th-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
The only other NFL game in Asia was in Tokyo in 1976, when St. Louis beat San 
Diego, 20-10.
