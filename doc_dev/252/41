   A new daily tabloid will hit the homes and
newsstands of St. Louis in September, and its publisher will be a
man who has been a top executive at the city's established
newspaper, publishing magnate Ralph Ingersoll II announced Tuesday.
   The newspaper, the St. Louis Sun, will be published seven
mornings a week and compete head-on with the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, a morning newspaper owned by the Pulitzer Publishing
Co.
   The Post-Dispatch has been the city's only newspaper since the
St. Louis Globe-Democrat folded under financial strain in October
1986.
   ``This is a completely new newspaper,'' Ingersoll said at a news
conference. ``I assure you the Sun will not just be a good
newspaper, it will be a great newspaper.''
   Asked about the slant of the editorial page, Ingersoll said the
paper would be ``a conservator of traditional values.''
   Ingersoll said he will be chairman and editor in chief of the
newspaper and will set up a residence in St. Louis to oversee the
operation initially.
   Robert M. Jelenic, executive vice president of Ingersoll
Publications, will be the president of the new company; and Thomas
M. Tallarico, 44, a senior vice president and general manager of
the Post-Dispatch since 1986, will be the publisher.
   Tallarico submitted his resignation to Post-Dispatch Publisher
Nicholas G. Penniman IV Tuesday morning, sending shock waves
through that newspaper.
   Penniman said he was stunned when Tallarico gave him the news.
Penniman said it was his view that Tallarico had taken on the job
of ``burying the Post-Dispatch.''
   ``We, of course, won't let that happen,'' Penniman said.
   Ingersoll owns the Suburban Journals, 43 non-daily newspapers
published throughout the metropolitan area. He said the Journals
and the Sun would be operated separately.
   Ingersoll said his company has invested more than $100 million
in the St. Louis area with its non-daily publications and is
committing millions more to establish the Sun. He would not divulge
specific figures on the Sun's start-up cost.
   The organization has acquired color-capable presses that can
print 128 pages an issue. The press run will be 200,000 copies,
Ingersoll said.
   The paper, to be housed in a new downtown office building, would
be able to operate successfully with less than 100,000 circulation,
he said. Ingersoll said the Sun will hire a staff of 75 to 100
reporters.
   Ingersoll said he was not concerned that many cities have become
one-newspaper communities due to lack of advertiser support for a
second paper.
   ``We'll be competitive with the Post-Dispatch _ volume one,
number one,'' Ingersoll said. ``The Sun will be profitable in the
second year of its operation, and it will continue to grow.''
   Tallarico said the Sun, unlike many other tabloids in the United
States and Europe, would not emphasize sensational news.
   St. Louis Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr., who was involved in an
attempt to save the Globe-Democrat in 1984, called the announcement
``a very historic day.''
   Ingersoll Publications, a privately held company that had
revenues of more than $700 million in 1988, operates 40 daily
newspapers and more than 150 non-daily newspapers.
   Circulation of the daily newspapers exceeds more than 1.25
million. Its non-daily editions reach an additional 5 million homes.
