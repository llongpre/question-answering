   The Interstate Commerce Commission on Friday
approved the proposed sale of the Chicago, Missouri &amp; Western
Railway line between Chicago and East St. Louis, a major step in
the carrier's reorganization.
   The deal, which still must be approved by a U.S. bankruptcy
judge in Chicago, would give the route to Rio Grande Industries
Inc., a railroad company in San Francisco that has been seeking a
foothold in Illinois.
   Under the proposal, Rio Grande would pay $22 million and assume
$7 million of CM&amp;W debt owed to various state agencies. Rio Grande
told the government it would eliminate 187 of the 360 CM&amp;W jobs on
the line.
   ``Whatever happens in bankruptcy court will probably happen soon
because CM&amp;W is in a tough cash position,'' said George W. Mayo
Jr., attorney for Rio Grande.
   The route is used mainly for freight, but Amtrak also uses it to
run three daily round-trip runs between Chicago and St. Louis and
two between Chicago and Springfield.
   In making its decision, the ICC considered objections from
competing railroads, including Chicago and North Western
Transportation Co. and Illinois Central Railroad Co.
   Both handle freight for railroads owned by Rio Grande _ business
they are likely to lose if the deal is approved in bankruptcy court
and Rio Grande gains access to the line. Illinois Central said it
would lose $7.2 million per year.
   The ICC was not swayed.
   ``We conclude that the ... acquisition of CM&amp;W's line ... will
not result in a substantial lessening of competition, creation of a
monopoly or restraint of trade in freight surface transportation in
the region,'' the order said.
   ``The transfer will also assure continued operation by Amtrak
over its third heaviest volume line. ... The state has made a
substantial investment in the line,'' the ICC said. ``Sale to (Rio
Grande) will secure this investment.''
   Under the proposed deal with Rio Grande, CM&amp;W would still retain
its Kansas City, Mo.-East St. Louis route; track between Greene
County and Springfield; a 50 percent interest in the Godfrey-East
St. Louis line, and all locomotives and cars.
   CM&amp;W was created in 1986 to be an independent regional railroad.
In April 1988, the railroad filed for bankruptcy reorganization and
the case is pending before U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John
Schwartz in Chicago.
   Creditors, primarily Citicorp North America Inc. and Heller
Financial Inc., are owed more than $100 million. They want
immediate liquidation of the railroad, while Daniel Murray, the
court-appointed trustee, supports the Rio Grande deal.
   Neal Wolf, an attorney representing Citicorp, and Murray could
not be reached for comment Friday on the ICC decision.
   CM&amp;W is wrangling with its creditors over $13.9 million in loans
and grants given to the railroad by the state of Illinois.
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen prevented CM&amp;W from using the
money, but that ruling has been appealed to a higher court.
