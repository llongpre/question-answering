   In a development that could have ramifications for cable
television operators nationwide, a Missouri cable operator
was denied a franchise renewal by the city it served, ending
a six-month court battle.
   U.S. District Court Judge Edward L. Filippine in St. Louis
upheld the decision by the city of Rolla, Mo., not to renew
the franchise that Rolla Cable Systems, a subsidiary of Omega
Communications Inc., had held for thirty years. The franchise
is among the oldest in the country, but had been attacked by
the city for failing to provide adequate service.

   Cable industry analysts and attorneys say this is the
first case where a court upheld a city's decision not to
renew a franchise based on guidelines contained in the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984. The act freed the cable
industry from most local rate regulation, but left local
governments with authority over franchise renewals.
   Cable franchises are valuable commodities that are not
surrendered easily. Of the cable franchises up for renewal,
98% are negotiated informally and without incident, said Wes
Heppler, an attorney specializing on cable television law
with the Washington, D.C., firm of Cole Raywid &amp; Braverman.
"It's highly unusual for a case to get this far," he said.
   Rolla Cable Systems, which has about 4,000 subscribers,
brought the case to U.S. District Court in St. Louis after
the city of Rolla decided to deny the company a franchise
renewal.
   "We had problems with their office staff, their technical
staff and problems with getting a clear signal from St.
Louis," said Merle Strouse, the city administrator of Rolla,
a community with a population of approximately 14,000 located
midway between St. Louis and Springfield.
   Robert Schloss, president of Indianapolis-based Omega
Communications, which operates 12 cable systems with 60,000
subscribers, declined to comment on the judge's decision or
say whether the company would appeal.
   However, Mr. Schloss said the city of Rolla, through Rolla
Municipal Utilities, was anxious to establish its own cable
franchise and that entered into the city's decision to oust
Rolla Cable.
   Mr. Strouse acknowledged that the city's utility company
might become a cable operator, but added, "we're going to
entertain bids from other cable companies, including Rolla
Cable Systems, if it wishes to enter the competition."
   In its filing with the court, attorneys representing the
city of Rolla said that there was "no factual base" to
determine that Rolla Cable Systems "has the continuing
technical ability" to provide adequate services, facilities
and equipment. The city also charged that the cable operator
"continually and consistently mismanaged the system in light
of substantial community criticism and had done so primarily
because of its inability to understand and/or commit to
technical competence."
   John Mansell, a senior analyst with the Carmel, Calif.,
cable firm Paul Kagan Associates Inc., said that such cases
may increase as "cities make noises about owning their own
cable systems."
