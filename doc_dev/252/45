   Suits being filed nationwide against Chrysler
Corp. have delayed payments of at least $500 each to owners of
Chrysler cars sold after being test-driven while their odometers
were disconnected.
   Chrysler, the nation's third-largest automaker, agreed last year
to pay about $16 million to more than 32,000 owners but will not
pay the money until the settlement is approved late this summer by
U.S. District Court Judge John Nangle in St. Louis.
   Approval of the settlement has been delayed in part by continued
filing of class-action suits against Chrysler nationwide, said
Marcia Aud, Nangle's deputy clerk. The suits must be consolidated
and heard in St. Louis.
   So far, Aud said, 38 suits have been filed against Chrysler by
owners and state attorneys general, ``and we're still adding new
ones.''
   Chrysler pleaded no contest last year to federal charges of
odometer tampering contained in an indictment handed down in St.
Louis. The investigation was launched in Missouri after state
police noticed in several instances in which traffic citations were
issued to Chrysler employees that the odometer read zero and
speedometer was out of commission.
   Chrysler stopped disconnecting odometers in October 1986 after
learning of the government investigation.
   Chrysler also extended the warranty on the cars to seven years
or 70,000 miles from the standard five years or 50,000 miles. The
warranty is in effect despite delays in the settlement, Chrysler
spokesman Steve Harris said.
   Last July, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said selling cars
tested with disconnected odometers was ``dumb'' and that selling
cars damaged during the testing went ``beyond dumb and reached all
the way to stupid.''
   All automakers disconnected odometers during testing at one
time, but General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. halted the
practice in the 1970s.
