This week's purchase by Saint Louis of a 13.8 per cent stake in Source
Perrier is another intriguing development in the Agnelli family's
pan-European food strategy. The ultimate goal may remain obscure, but the
latest deal has two immediate implications. It notably strengthens the
Italian grip on France's much-prized water company, and it underlines the
growing alliance between the Agnellis and Maison Worms.
These two families are openly acting in concert at St Louis, where they have
more than 50 per cent of the votes. By combining the new St Louis stake in
Perrier with the 35 per cent held by Exor, the quoted holding company for
which the Agnellis are currently making a full bid, they will now own 49 per
cent of Perrier. Under French takeover rules that should trigger a partial
bid for the rest, though minority shareholders should not expect any
favours. The Agnellis would not be required to pay more than the FF1,235 per
share forked out this week by St Louis, and with effective control already
in their hands they will hardly want to.
The more interesting question is whether a more substantial shake-up of food
and drink assets in France is on the cards. Notwithstanding stakes in BSN
held directly through the Agnelli vehicle Ifil (5.8 per cent) and indirectly
via St Louis (3 per cent), a full bid for the food giant is difficult to
envisage. It would be hugely expensive, would cause deep political ructions
and would simply not be the Agnelli style. The Agnellis and their French
friends are nevertheless emerging as a powerful new force in the European
food industry, ready to mount a serious challenge to the likes of Nestle and
Unilever in the 1990s.
