   Convicted killer Gerald Smith, who had said
he wanted to die, was executed by lethal injection early today,
becoming the second Missouri prisoner put to death in a
quarter-century.
   Smith, 31, of St. Louis, was pronounced dead at 12:09 a.m., said
Dick Moore, director of the Missouri Department of Corrections.
   Smith was executed for the 1980 beating death of Karen Roberts,
his former girlfriend in St. Louis. In a letter to a newspaper,
Smith said he murdered Ms. Roberts because he believed she gave him
a venereal disease.
   Smith's wife, Lynn, watched the execution along with
court-appointed defense attorney C. John Pleban.
   As the first lethal drug was administerred, Mrs. Smith raised
her left hand and made a ``V'' sign. She mouthed, ``I love you.''
   Smith became the 121st prisoner executed since the U.S. Supreme
Court allowed states to resume carryuing out the death penalty in
1976.
   Death-penalty opponents made a last-ditch effort to save Smith's
life by filing a motion Wednesday afternoon with the U.S. Supreme
Court, but the court voted 7-2 to reject the appeal by the Missouri
Capital Punishment Resource Center in Kansas City.
   Smith came close to execution several times before, but stays
were issued as he changed his mind about whether he wanted to die.
   Last week, Associate Justice Harry Blackmun stayed an execution
for Smith that was scheduled last Thursday to allow the court to
consider motions by Pleban.
   But the full court lifted that stay on Tuesday, and the Missouri
Supreme Court acted swiftly to schedule the execution.
   Smith also was under a death sentence for the 1985 slaying of
fellow death-row inmate Robert Baker.
   Opponents of capital punishment gathered for prayer services at
churches in St. Louis and Jefferson City.
   Gov. John Ashcroft was asked to reprieve Smith on Wednesday by
the Missouri Coalition Against The Death Penalty. The governor's
spokesman, Bob Ferguson, said Ashcroft would not interfere with the
judicial process.
