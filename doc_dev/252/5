   A St. Louis jail escapee wanted in a
multistate robbery-kidnap spree was chased by 40 police cars and
captured Wednesday in Fort Wayne, after his stolen car crashed into
a squad car and overturned, police said.
   Ronald L. White received only head and leg abrasions in the
crash that ended a 15-minute chase through city streets by FBI
agents, state police and Allen County deputies, police said. He was
arrested around 12:45 p.m.
   Authorities say White was involved in a series of sexual
assaults, the abduction of three people and the theft of four
vehicles since his escape Monday from the medium-security City
Workhouse in St. Louis.
   White, whose age and hometown were not immediately known
Wednesday, was taken to the Allen County Jail after being treated
at a Fort Wayne hospital, Additional charges may be filed by
Missouri, Illinois and Indiana authorities for crimes White
allegedly committed while at large, said Lee M. Quick, assistant
special agent in charge of the Indianapolis FBI office.
   Quick said about 40 law enforcement vehicles were involved in
the chase.
   White also faced charges from an Aurora, Colo., bank robbery
after he was arrested in St. Louis on a drug charge, Quick said. He
also is suspected in in bank robberies in Denver, Seattle and
Lansing, Mich., officials said.
   ``The FBI received a tip that White was en route to Fort Wayne
from Indianapolis and that he had a relative in Fort Wayne,'' said
police Sgt. Keith Butts.
   ``A stakeout was set up at the (relative's) house, but the
suspect rammed an FBI vehicle and fled,'' Butts said.
   White was captured a short time later in a stolen car matching
the description of one owned by a woman he abducted in Missouri,
officials said.
   The kidnapping charge involved the abduction of a 60-year-old
St. Jacob, Ill., gas station attendant who was reported missing
Tuesday night and was found unhurt the next morning, tied up in an
Indianapolis motel, Quick said.
   White drove out of the St. Louis jail Monday after stabbing a
dairy truck driver in the leg who was making a delivery to the
lockup, authorities said. White abandoned the truck minutes later,
then got 27-year-old Michael Crawford to take him to south St.
Louis, where he picked up his 25-year-old girlfriend and threatened
Crawford with a butcher knife, police said.
   Crawford then crashed his car against an apartment house after
White threatened to kill him with a butcher knife, police said.
   Crawford was not injured and White fled, but his girlfriend, who
was treated for facial cuts from the accident, was arrested, police
said.
   White also is suspected of entering the residence of a
19-year-old St. Louis woman, sexually assaulting her at knifepoint
four times and forcing her to accompany him in her boyfriend's car,
police said.
   The woman later jumped from the car when White tried to make her
cash checks at a bank drive-up window. White drove away in the
vehicle, the FBI said.
   He was being held in the workhouse awaiting extradition to
Denver, Quick said. Authorities said they found $20,000 in
travelers checks taken in the robbery of a suburban Denver bank in
his car.
