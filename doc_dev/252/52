Steve Rosenbloom, 44, sits at his home in New Orleans, talking on the phone 
with an old sportswriter friend from his Baltimore days. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rosenbloom is by no means an unhappy man. 
</P>
<P>
He has a 2-year-old son, Jonathan, by his second wife, a New Orleans woman, 
with whom he is happy. His sons, 10 and 14, from his first marriage live nearby 
with their mother. He sees them "all the time." 
</P>
<P>
A Georgetown University graduate, Rosenbloom has been involved in real estate 
since he was fired by the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
"We did some residential things," he says, "but New Orleans has a depressed 
economy because of the energy business. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has any money right now so nobody's buying anything. We're sort of 
landlords at this point." 
</P>
<P>
As a young man, Steve Rosenbloom did not dream it would be like this when he 
reached middle age. 
</P>
<P>
He thought he'd be the owner and operator of the Baltimore Colts, the team his 
father, Carroll, owned during its glory years. 
</P>
<P>
But Carroll Rosenbloom traded the Colts for the Los Angeles Rams and, a few 
years afterward, he drowned in the surf off his home in the Golden Beach 
section of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Steve's stepmother, Georgia Frontiere, inherited 70 percent of the Rams. Steve 
and his brother and sister sold off their share. Before long, Georgia fired 
Steve from his front office job. 
</P>
<P>
There are people in Baltimore who remember that Carroll Rosenbloom ran a very 
successful franchise for a number of years, and that Steve was being groomed to 
succeed him. Some wonder if Steve would come back to Baltimore as owner of a 
new NFL team, should Baltimore get one. 
</P>
<P>
"Six or seven years ago," Steve says, "I did put a group together that would 
have owned an expansion team in another city. Ironically, it was Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"We dealt with Mayor Hudnut, who is very progressive the way Mayor Schaefer was 
in Baltimore, and we thought we'd get the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, Indianapolis didn't have to wait for an expansion team. Bob 
Irsay moved the Colts there." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rosenbloom is as uneasy with the mere mention of Irsay as most 
Baltimoreans are. 
</P>
<P>
"If Baltimore people are angry about what Irsay did there, they should blame 
Joe Thomas," Steve says. "Joe was out of a job. He went out and found Irsay and 
brought him to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad didn't know Irsay. He sure didn't know what a jerk the guy was. 
</P>
<P>
"Things moved so fast at the end when the franchises were traded. Dad got tired 
of being hit over the head in Baltimore by people who were angry because he 
wanted to put the exhibition games on the season-ticket package, by people who 
were always asking what was wrong with the Colts when they were 10-6. Finally 
he said, 'I'm out of here.' 
</P>
<P>
"Irsay has always been an embarrassment to me when I see what the city got 
after we left. Irsay single-handedly made more Oriole fans than anybody thought 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Irsay messed up Baltimore and now he's making a toilet out of Indianapolis, 
which is a shame. I like Indianapolis. I like Mayor Hudnut. There are a lot of 
nice people out there." 
</P>
<P>
Since the time when Steve was visiting Indianapolis, advising the people there 
how to get a franchise, his interest in pro football has waned. 
</P>
<P>
"The game has changed so much," he says. "The new breed of owners is greedy. 
The old guard knew something about pro football. At least they cared about the 
game. All the new owners care about is money. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to give the teams back to the cities, back to the fans. The 
new owners don't know how these franchises became successful in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"With us in Baltimore, it was a partnership. We related to the fans. We had the 
Colt Corrals. Everybody was involved. Everybody lived it. There was a closeness 
that's gone now. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that made the NFL stable all those years was that while baseball and 
basketball were moving franchises around, no NFL franchise was moved from the 
time the Cardinals moved from Chicago to St. Louis in 1960 until Al Davis took 
the Raiders to Los Angeles. Now it's a this-is-your-team-for-a-week kind of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
As for Baltimore, Rosenbloom says: "I'm glad I was in it in Baltimore when it 
was fun. It may be better to have the memories than to be in it the way it is 
now."
