   Attorney General Edwin Meese's choice to
become the No. 2 official in the Justice Department is under fire
for his membership in an all-male athletic club and an all-white
country club.
   ``It makes it hard to imagine he'll be able to administer
justice in government in a way that's non-discriminatory when in
his own personal life he doesn't live up to that,'' Patricia
Ireland, executive vice president of the National Organization for
Women, said of John C. Shepherd.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on whether to confirm
Shepherd as deputy attorney general, if President Reagan goes ahead
and nominates him. Committee members said Thursday that it is too
soon to comment on Shepherd's membership in the Missouri Athletic
Club, which has no female members, and the Bellerive Country Club,
which has no blacks. Both are in the St. Louis area.
   Shepherd, 62, a St. Louis attorney, could not be reached for
comment Thursday. He was not in his office, and his home phone
number is unlisted. But on Wednesday he told the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch he had not yet decided whether he should resign from
the clubs.
   ``I haven't made up my mind on whether that would be
necessary,'' he told the newspaper. ``I am going to Washington for
nine months to help the attorney general as his deputy.''
   Shepherd said he told Meese and other Justice Department
officials about his club memberships in conversations in Washington
earlier this week. He added that the FBI ``is aware of this.''
   In the same interview, Shepherd also said he was confident he
would be cleared by the FBI of allegations that he had an affair
with a former bookkeeper at his firm and that he had authorized her
to write $147,000 in checks to herself.
   He added that the allegations by Denise Sinner, 29, of St.
Peters, Mo., ``are absolutely untrue and unfounded.''
   Sinner was convicted last month in St. Louis Circuit Court on
charges of making false statements and stealing more than $100,000
from Shepherd's law firm, Shepherd, Sandberg &amp; Phoenix.
   Sinner's attorney, Darrill S. Beebe, said Thursday he was
surprised when he heard that Meese had chosen Shepherd for a top
Justice Department post. However, he said he and Sinner would
testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Shepherd ``only
if we're subpoenaed. We're not volunteering.''
   Shepherd, a former president of the American Bar Association,
was tapped by Meese on Tuesday to fill the deputy attorney
general's job following the March 29 protest resignation of Arnold
Burns.
   Burns quit along with Assistant Attorney General William Weld
because of concerns that the 11-month criminal investigation of
Meese was dragging down the Justice Department, department sources
have said.
   Meese left Wednesday on a trip to Latin America to discuss
anti-drug efforts.
   Shepherd's memberships in the Missouri Athletic Club and the
Bellerive Country Club were first reported by NBC News. Jim Baer, a
spokesman for the athletic club in downtown St. Louis, confirmed
Thursday that Shepherd is a member and said the club, founded in
1904, does not accept women.
   Arthur Wright, president of the country club in suburban St.
Louis, said Shepherd has been a member there since 1970. ``There
are no black members,'' Wright said, ``but our bylaws specify that
the club is open to everybody.''
   Wright said, however, that membership in the country club is
through invitation only and ``to the best of my knowledge, no black
has ever been proposed for membership.''
   A spokeswoman for the American Bar Association, Gail Alexander,
said the group's code of conduct prohibits members who are judges
from belonging to private clubs that practice ``invidious
discrimination.''
   Ms. Alexander said the ABA also has a policy that prohibits
meetings from being held in such private clubs.
   The issue of membership in exclusionary clubs has arisen before,
with mixed results. President Carter's nominee for attorney
general, Griffin Bell, told the Judiciary Committee during his
confirmation hearings he would resign from such clubs. President
Reagan's first attorney general, William French Smith, refused to
follow that example and was confirmed anyway.
   More recently, U.S. Circuit Judge Anthony Kennedy resigned from
membership in two exclusionary clubs when his name was first
mentioned as a possible nominee for the Supreme Court. He was
subsequently confirmed as a justice.
