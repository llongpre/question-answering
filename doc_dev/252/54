   Anti-abortion protests Saturday in south Florida and St. Louis
resulted in more than 130 arrests, police said.
   In Oakland Park, Fla., 107 people who blocked the entrance to the
Women's Clinic were arrested, but the demonstrators were freed
within hours on their own recognizance, an organizer said.
   Demonstrators were carried off by police, charged with
trespassing and unlawful assembly and booked at the Broward County
Jail, said Katie Mahoney, spokeswoman for Rescue South Florida, the
rally organizer.
   Police said about 100 arrests were made but could not give a
specific number. No violence was reported.
   The Women's Clinic closed for a few hours during the
demonstration.
   In St. Louis, police said they arrested more than two dozen
people who attempted to block the entrance to the parking lot at the
Reproductive Health Services clinic. They declined to disclose the
exact number of arrests.
   The protesters laid down in a driveway to block cars attempting
to get into the lot, but police picked them up and put them into a
van. About 30 officers formed a shield around the front door of the
clinic, keeping the protesters away from the entrance.
   Several hundred pro-choice demonstrators marched past the health
center during the protest, but there was no confrontation.
   The protest came on the final day of a three-day event that the
St. Louis Pro-Life Direct Action League called ``Rescue St. Louis.''
Thirty-eight protesters were arrested during a demonstration Friday
at a medical office complex.
