   President Bush signed legislation Tuesday
making a national historic site of the St. Louis County, Mo.,
estate where Ulysses S. Grant and his wife lived before the Civil
War.
   Bush also signed a separate bill paving the way for the
acquisition of three additional houses adjacent to Harry S.
Truman's home in Independence, Mo., which is already a national
historic site.
   The 9.65-acre Grant estate, called White Haven, was the home of
Grant's wife, Julia. The Grants lived there from 1854 to 1860 and
owned the estate until Grant's death in 1885.
   Grant led the Union troops in the Civil War and became the 18th
president in 1869.
   ``The Grants lived together at White Haven during the crucial
pre-Civil War years. It was during this time that Grant's strength
of character was developed through economic adversity,'' Bush said
in a statement.
   Grant developed then such traits as ``a relentless pursuit of
success and a determination to move ahead despite temporary
setbacks'' that later served him well both ``as an incomparable
military leader'' and in the White House, Bush said.
   While saying White Haven will be ``a worthy addition to the
National Park System,'' Bush expressed chagrin that Congress passed
it without first waiting for a formal study as the Interior
Department had recommended.
   Bush said that in the future, completion of a formal study
``should be a prerequisite for establishment of any new unit of the
National Park System.''
   ``Such studies enable the National Park Service to examine the
suitability, feasibility and alternatives for managing proposed new
park units,'' the president said.
   White Haven is in what are now the suburbs of St. Louis. The
County of St. Louis acquired the home after a civic campaign was
launched in 1985 to save the Grant estate.
   While the legislation, sponsored by House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and others, stipulates that the estate
will be donated to the government as a historic site, it allows the
government to acquire other Grant artifacts by either donation or
purchase.
   It also authorizes the Interior Department to spend up to $1
million restoring the estate, and estimates the annual operating
budget and upkeep at $400,000.
   The separate Truman legislation authorizes the government to
spend $250,000 acquiring three houses in Independence adjacent to
the Truman home, giving the current owners the right of tenancy for
25 years or until death, whichever is later.
   Administration officials estimated it will cost $75,000 to
repair and convert a vacant house into a visitors' center, with an
annual operating cost of $15,000. The measure was sponsored by Rep.
Alan Wheat, D-Mo., and others.
   Truman, the 33rd president, died in 1972.
