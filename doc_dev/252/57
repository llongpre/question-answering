   The premier edition of St. Louis' new morning
newspaper, the St. Louis Sun, was snatched up around the city
Monday by curious and enthusiastic readers.
   ``The customers like the competition,'' said Ann Pointer at a
World News Ltd. newstand in Clayton where 700 copies were sold in
about 2{ hours. ``They like another viewpoint.''
   Sales were brisk around town, and many of the Sun's shiny red
street corner boxes, dubbed ``facts machines'' by the Sun, were
empty by mid-morning.
   The Sun, whose debut featured a color picture of a sun rising
behind the Gateway Arch, is the first major newspaper to start from
scratch in a big U.S. city since the Washington Times in 1982.
   The Sun published 200,000 copies of its premier edition.
   The colorful tabloid is competing with the 110-year-old St.
Louis Post-Dispatch, also a morning paper. The Post-Dispatch has
been the city's only daily newspaper since the St. Louis
Globe-Democrat folded in October 1986.
   At a sidewalk reception outside the Sun's downtown offices
Monday morning, Sun employees darted into traffic to hand out free
copies of the paper. A Dixieland band played in the background, and
employees offered coffee and donuts to passers-by.
   Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman and chief executive officer of New
Jersey-based Ingersoll Publications Co., which owns the Sun, is
moving to St. Louis from Connecticut to become editor in chief.
   ``I think it's pretty clear that print has a good future. I
haven't the least doubt the St. Louis Sun will be profitable. It's
one of the lower risk ventures we've undertaken,'' he said.
   Already, the Sun has attracted 55,000 subscribers _ nearly twice
the level company officials had been aiming for after a month of
publication. Advertising space in the inaugural edition was sold
out.
   Last week's paid circulation at the Post-Dispatch stood at
564,000 on Sunday and 384,000 on weekdays.
   ``We definitely welcome competition,'' said the Post-Dispatch's
managing editor, David Lipman. ``We find it exciting and
challenging.''
