   Walter DeBow and his family fought
City Hall, and now they own it.
   DeBow, 55, suffered permanent brain damage after being beaten
into a coma by a fellow prisoner at the city jail more than six
years ago. He and his family were awarded $3.4 million in a 1985
court settlement with the city.
   With interest, that amount has grown to $4 million, and the
debt-ridden city has not paid at least $1 million of it, said the
DeBows' attorney, Clyde Kuehn.
   So on Thursday, Judge Roger Scrivner of St. Clair County Circuit
Court awarded the East St. Louis Municipal Building and 220 acres
of city-owned property to the DeBows.
   Kuehn said the DeBows planned to sell the property. ``Definitely
my clients want what they were awarded, and I think this is
necessary to accomplish that,'' he said.
   City officials estimated the municipal building alone cost $10
million to build. City Attorney Eric Vickers said the value of the
properties far exceeds anything owed the DeBows.
   ``I think this decision is just a major miscarriage of justice
and demonstrates bias against the city of East St. Louis,'' Vickers
said. ``The city has not defaulted on its payments. It's
ludicrous.''
   Another lawyer for East St. Louis, Irvin Williamson, said the
city would ask a court to stay the judgment pending appeal.
   ``If the court allows the judgment to stand against the city,
what's next? The police cars? The fire trucks?'' Williamson said.
   East St. Louis is plagued by debt estimated at $47 million. Gov.
James R. Thompson signed a $34 million bailout bill Aug. 30. The
money will come from state bond issues.
   The population of the city, which has one of the highest murder
rates in the country, fell from 55,000 in 1980 to 40,000 this year,
the Census Bureau estimates.
   Mayor Carl E. Officer declined to comment on the judge's order.
Aldermen were flabbergasted.
   ``It's amazing,'' said Alderman Percy McKinney. ``I guess we pay
rent from now on.''
   State law gives DeBow's family the right to evict the city in
seven days, but Kuehn said his clients weren't likely to do that.
   Walter DeBow was comatose for three months following the January
1984 beating, which occurred while he was being held on a traffic
charge of illegal transportation of alcohol. He is being cared for
at a head-injury rehabilitation center in New Jersey.
   Kuehn has taken the city to court several times since DeBow was
awarded the $4 million. In March 1988, he won an order to freeze
the city's assets, stopping city workers' paychecks and threatening
to push the city into bankruptcy.
   The city later tried to pay off the debt by issuing nearly $5.2
million in bonds.But Thursday, Kuehn said the actual value of the
bonds was only $2.8 million, prompting him to ask the judge to
award the city property to DeBow's estate to make up the
difference.
   DeBow also will continue to hold the bonds and receive biannual
bond payments, Kuehn said.
