<LEADPARA>  Pittsburgh Penguins owner Edward DeBartolo said Wednesday that he has agreed
to sell the Stanley Cup champions to a group that includes two former NHL
owners.;   The group that has been seeking to buy the franchise is made up of
former Hartford Whalers Chairman Howard Baldwin; Morris Belzberg, who owned
the Minnesota North Stars with Baldwin for a brief time last year; and Thomas
Ruta.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The deal should be completed by November, DeBartolo said. It must be
approved by 17 of 22 members of the NHL Board of Governors.;   Terms were not
announced, but Pittsburgh newspapers have reported that DeBartolo wanted $55
million for the team and the rights to operate Civic Arena.;   DeBartolo,
father of 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr., has owned the club since 1977. He
is reported to be selling off assets, including the Penguins, because of real
estate losses.; THE HOT SEAT: All Brendan Shanahan wants to do is play hockey,
but sometimes it's hard being the guy who cost the St. Louis Blues Scott
Stevens.;   When Shanahan, a forward, left the New Jersey Devils and signed a
free-agent contract with the St. Louis Blues in July, he looked forward to
being with a Stanley Cup contender. But his arrival meant the loss of Stevens,
the team's captain and top defenseman, as compensation to the Devils.;   And
so, with the Blues off to an 0-2 start in which they have been outscored 10-2,
Shanahan is understandably feeling a little heat entering tonight's home
opener against Edmonton.;   Last week, he said he was sick of hearing about
Stevens.;   "I shouldn't worry about our defense without him, and I don't
think he has to play forward in Jersey to make up for me."; ETC.: Los Angeles
defenseman Rob Blake, who sprained his right shoulder when he rammed into the
boards during the Kings' 6-3 victory over Edmonton on Tuesday, will be
sidelined for up to a month.  </TEXT>
