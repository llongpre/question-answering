Maybe the management of the Sockers should consider making trades more 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the Sockers shipped temperamental forward Zoran Karic off to chilly 
Cleveland in exchange for Paul Wright, a speedy 20-year-old forward who slipped 
through the Sockers' fingers during last summer's free agent draft. The 
question begging an answer was whether it was worth swapping a guy who led the 
team in scoring during the regular season last year for a second-year player 
who played infrequently as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night before a San Diego Sports Arena crowd of just 5,538 -- the fewest 
at home since 5,525 watched a game with Dallas on Feb. 3, 1987 -- the Sockers 
defeated the St. Louis Storm, 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
Draw your own conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
One game is only a small indicator that this was a smart trade. But, if nothing 
else, it was proof that there is life left in a team that seemed ready for the 
Major Indoor Soccer League obituary page less than three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that the Storm (19-21) had defeated the Sockers (17-21) in four of 
six meetings before Tuesday night. Also keep in mind that we're talking about a 
Socker team that had previously won by more than four goals only once this 
season, and only once had scored nine goals. 
</P>
<P>
So there were a lot of happy Socker faces by the time rookie forward Rod Castro 
scored 58 seconds into the fourth quarter to give the Sockers the final goal of 
their offensive party. They were talking with renewed zest in the locker room 
minutes after the final ball was played. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the team that should be playing right now," defender George 
Fernandez said. "Everybody feels good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The coach feels good, too. 
</P>
<P>
"That should make a few people sit up and take notice around the league," Coach 
Ron Newman said. "It was great. There was no slackness tonight." 
</P>
<P>
How did the Sockers pile up so many goals? Let us count the ways. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Waad Hirmez started things in the first quarter, followed by 
midfielder Branko Segota and forward Jim Gabarra. The first quarter ended with 
the Sockers ahead, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Second quarter. Gabarra scores again, his seventh of the season. Midfielder 
Thompson Usiyan scores for St. Louis to make it 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Third quarter. Hirmez starts things off again with a goal off a restart kick 
from Wright. Segota scores the next two goals for a hat trick and a 7-1 Socker 
lead. Segota now has 700 points in his MISL career. 
</P>
<P>
"I was due," Segota said. "I've been hitting the post and crossbar all year. 
I've also had minor injuries that have slowed me down a little. I feel good 
now. I had 10 days off to take care of the knicks and knacks." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes after Segota polished off his hat trick, Gabarra made it 8-1 a to 
pick up one of his own, the second of his MISL career. Then, after Castro 
scored, St. Louis got late goals from midfielders Daryl Doran and Claudio De 
Oliveira. 
</P>
<P>
Though he only collected one assist, Wright's presence was felt. The Sockers 
suddenly have quick, fresh feet at the midfield position, which allows Segota 
to play forward and take his hacks at the goal. From now on, opponents of the 
Sockers will keep a nervous eye on Wright as they double-team Segota. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they have to worry about his speed," Segota said. "By playing up 
front, I'm more effective. When you go back and forth and then you still have 
to battle the double-coverage, it's tough." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Despite a season filled with ups and downs, the Sockers are still talking with 
the confidence of champions. Asked about the playoffs, defender Kevin Crow 
said, "I don't see anybody that's going to beat us in a series. A lot of guys 
on our team, right, wrong or indifferent, are in the habit of looking at their 
calendar on October 1st and saying 'Man, the season goes all the way to April.' 
It's hard for some of our guys to play at a high level the whole season. But 
they can suck it up for short periods of time, and that's what happens in the 
playoffs." Midfielder Brian Quinn missed his fifth consecutive game with 
tendinitis of the groin, which he said will probably keep him out of weekend 
games with Kansas City and Baltimore. Also not in uniform Tuesday was veteran 
forward Steve Zungul and forward Damir Haramina, out with strained a 
quadriceps.
