FT  16 SEP 92 / Shareholders claim a lack of entente: Strong reaction to
paper group's move

British analysts and institutional shareholders re-acted angrily to Arjo
Wiggins Appleton's dividend cut yesterday.
Most complained they could not understand the reasons for the unexpected
decision by the Franco-British paper group.
The move seems to represent a serious breakdown in understanding between St
Louis, AWA's French minority shareholder, and its British counterparts.
It also demonstrates the different attitudes of French and Anglo-Saxon
groups to shareholder value and management practice.
Mr Bernard Dumon, chairman of St Louis, the French group which owns 39 per
cent of AWA, said he was surprised at the reaction of the London market.
'This is very simple,' he said. 'What concerned us was the fall in profits
this year and last. There was no prospect of an improvement next year. If
profits fall, then it's absolutely normal to cut the dividend. That is not
unusual. It's not a French nor a British practice, but just good
management.'
Mr Nicholas Worms, senior partner at Worms et Cie, the French financial
group which owns 36 per cent of St Louis, said UK institutions had
over-reacted to the cut.
He said the market should have appreciated the move as a sign the company
was serious about getting to grips with its problems, although they were not
as serious as other companies in the sector.
UK analysts were far from understanding, however. 'The cut is a stupidity
and a tragedy. There was just no need to do it,' said one analyst.
'Financially the group is strong. The decision shows Arjo Wiggins has
effectively become a subsidiary of a French group that does not have the
interests of the majority shareholders at heart.'
Another analyst complained: 'The company is completely out of touch with its
shareholders - apart from 39 per cent of them.'
There were suggestions that a lower share price after the dividend cut might
make it easier for St Louis to raise its stake.
Mr Dumon said St Louis had no plans to increase its shareholding for the
time being. 'There is nothing in the air or any studies to go above the 40
per cent limit set during the merger between the French and British
companies.'
Mr Worms said that if in a couple of years the market had been 'completely
idiotic' and the share price was too low, St Louis might then approach the
other shareholders to buy them out.
However, he said St Louis was relatively too heavily invested in the paper
industry and did not have spare cash to squander.
Mr Tony Isaacs, AWA finance director, said that given the expected fall in
earnings for the full year, dividend cover would have dropped below the 2.0
to 2.5 times target set by the company if the dividend had been maintained.
The savings, he estimated, were about Pounds 13m. But analysts said such a
sum was tiny compared with the Pounds 50m the company had spent on
acquisitions and the Pounds 82m it was spending on capital investment.
Shares look likely to remain weak until the company can regain the City's
confidence. But most analysts believed that could now take years.
Meanwhile, Mr Worms insisted the move would strengthen the company. 'We have
to be realistic,' he said.
'If we want the company to be in a position to take advantage of the market
and make a Pounds 100m or Pounds 200m investment, then it's essential to
have a strong balance sheet. The dividend cut helps us achieve that.'
