   ST. LOUIS -- The minority shareholder in Clark Oil &amp;
Refining Corp. has filed a lawsuit to block Horsham Corp.,
which owns 60% of Clark, from proceeding with a planned
initial public offering that values the subsidiary at roughly
$420 million.
   In its complaint, AOC L.P., which owns the other 40% of
Clark, said the proposed offering undervalued the St. Louis
oil refining and marketing concern. The complaint also said
the offering violates an agreement between the two holders
that AOC must approve such a transaction before it can
proceed. AOC is a closely held concern of St. Louis
businessmen Paul Novelly and Samuel Goldstein. Horsham is a
holding company based in Toronto.

   "We firmly believe the lawsuit has no merit. There's no
conceivable reason why Clark would want to undervalue its
stock," said Paul Melnuk, president and chief operating
officer of Clark and of Horsham.
   Clark plans to issue seven million shares, or about 25% of
the total outstanding, at between $14 and $16 each. This
would value the whole company in the range of $392 million to
$448 million. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. is the lead underwriter
for the planned offering.
   AOC didn't specify what it believes would be an
appropriate value for Clark. In its complaint, filed in
Delaware Chancery Court, AOC said an "exhaustive valuation"
by another consulting group concluded that Clark "had an
equity value substantially in excess" of the amount suggested
by Goldman Sachs.
   Messrs. Novelly and Goldstein couldn't be reached for
comment.
