   Two striking Greyhound drivers in Missouri
were arrested Tuesday in connection with the shooting at
passenger-occupied buses near St. Louis last month, federal agents
said.
   Those arrested were Roy B. Simes, 35, and Harry T. Lewis, 42,
both of suburban St. Louis, said Stephen Higgins, director of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   There were no injuries in either of the March 22 incidents. One
involved a bus traveling on Interstate 55 about 12 miles south of
St. Louis and the other was just across the state line in
Collinsville, Ill.
   The federal agency announced last week it was investigating the
more than two dozen Greyhound shootings that have occurred since
6,300 drivers and 3,000 other workers walked off the job March 2
over wages and job security.
   Both men were charged before a federal magistrate in St. Louis
with three federal crimes _ endangering people on board a vehicle
used in interstate or foreign commerce; commission of a felony with
a firearm that has been transported in interstate commerce and use
of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, the agency
said.
   Spokesman Tom Hill said U.S. Magistrate Richard Buckles ordered
the men held without bond pending another hearing at 2 p.m.
Wednesday.
   If convicted, the men could face up to 10 years in jail and a
$10,000 fine. Using a firearm during the commission of a felony
carries a mandatory five-year jail term.
   The two St. Louis arrests were the agency's first since getting
involved; an arrest in a Hartford, Conn., shooting incident has
been the only other arrest. That also involved a striking driver.
   There were no new bargaining developments. Talks between
Greyhound Lines Inc. and the union have been stalled since March
18, and the company said it will not resume negotiations until a
week goes by without any acts of violence.
   Along with the nearly 30 shootings at buses and more than 100
bomb threats, the union contends there have been more than 60
incidents of violence against striking workers. One striker was
crushed to death by a bus in Redding, Calif., on March 3.
   Greyhound, the only nationwide bus system, has been operating on
a reduced schedule with replacement drivers they hired and union
members who crossed the picket line.
