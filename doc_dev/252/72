   The St. Louis Sun, starting from scratch in an
attempt to buck the trend of newspaper mergers and shutdowns,
debuted early today before a curious and eager community.
   The first edition of the tabloid featured a photograph of a
bright sun rising over the Gateway Arch.
   The lead story was the launch of the newspaper, and its headline
was ``St. Louis, We Have Liftoff.''
   The Sun is the first major newspaper to begin from scratch in a
big U.S. city since the Washington Times debuted in 1982.
   Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman and chief executive officer of New
Jersey-based Ingersoll Publications Co., which owns the Sun, is
moving to St. Louis from Connecticut to become editor-in-chief.
   ``I think it's pretty clear that print has a good future. I
haven't the least doubt the St. Louis Sun will be profitable. It's
one of the lower risk ventures we've undertaken,'' he said.
   ``This newspaper will be successful if it's relevant. That's our
number one priority.''
   To herald the Sun's rising, Ingersoll and other executives
gathered at a sidewalk reception this morning at the city's
downtown offices. A Dixieland jazz band played in the background as
Sun employees waded into traffic to hand out free copies of the
morning newspaper.
   Sue Selvidge, a clerk at World News in downtown St. Louis, said
this morning that the paper was selling briskly. ``Everygody likes
to see something new,'' she said.
   Already, the Sun has attracted 55,000 subscribers _ nearly twice
the level company officials had been aiming for after a month of
publication. Advertising space in the inaugural edition was sold
out.
   The Sun started printing 200,000 copies of the newspaper about
9:30 p.m. Sunday night, three hours earlier than its planned
deadline, in order to meet expected heavy demand.
   The 1-day-old Sun will be competing with the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, which will be 111 years old in December. The
Post-Dispatch has been the city's only daily newspaper since the
St. Louis Globe-Democrat folded in October 1986.
   ``We definitely welcome competition,'' said the Post-Dispatch's
managing editor, David Lipman. ``We find it exciting and
challenging.''
   The Post-Dispatch's circulation has been increasing all summer
and its 10 biggest advertisers are spending more money than they
were a year ago. Last week's paid circulation stood at 564,000 on
Sunday and 384,000 on weekdays.
   The Post-Dispatch took note of its new competition with a story
on the bottom of today's front page that included this quote from
Editor William Woo:
   ``It's a good-looking newspaper, but it's not a newspaper that
was invented on Mars or is the likes of something that people have
never seen.''
   Sun officials are calling the new tabloid a ``laptop'' paper
that's ``user friendly.''
   Although industry analysts are closely following the Sun's
progress, they don't think it will have that big an impact on the
industry.
   ``No matter what happens in St. Louis, I don't think you're
going to see many people rushing to try the same thing around the
country,'' said John Morton, a Washington-based newspaper analyst.
   Morton said there are only 19 cities in the country that still
have two commercially competitive newspapers, and it appears that
number will be shrinking soon.
