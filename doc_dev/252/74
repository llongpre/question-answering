<LEADPARA>  WHILE the incredibly wealthy and influential Busches of St. Louis -- brewing's
royal family -- have captured almost 44 percent of the nation's beer market,
they've also weathered a vast array of scandals and tragedies.;    It's enough
to fill a book.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     And now that book's been written by Peter Hernon and Terry Ganey, two
reporters for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.;    Criticized by some reviewers
for being ploddingly pieced together yet meticulously researched, "Under The
Influence: The Unauthorized Story of the Anheuser-Busch Dynasty" (Simon &amp;
Schuster, $24.95) unearths or recounts a mind-boggling number of fascinating
tales from the Busch family crypt.;    There's something to titillate
everyone, from family encounters with Kaiser Wilhelm, Adolf Hitler (a guest at
a family member's German estate in 1930), Al Capone and Frank Sinatra to the
rumored affair between Susan Hornibrook Busch, first wife of current company
head August A. Busch III, and Harry Caray, eccentric announcer for the
Busch-owned St. Louis Cardinals baseball team at the time.;    With a chilled
six-pack of Budweiser in hand, we visited co-author Hernon, 43, who was in the
Bay Area on Wednesday morning to hawk the book. Here are some highlights from
the conversation.;     Q. You want a brewski?;     A. If this were this
afternoon, I would take one. It's a great beer.;     Q. You drink Budweiser?; 
   A. Oh, sure. Sure. I prefer their low-end beer 'cause it's cheaper. Natural
Light. It all kind of tastes the same to me. . . . I think that for all their
scandals and peccadilloes, they do make just a fine lineup of beers.;     Q.
What do you think is the single most telling tale about the Busch family
dynasty?;     A. You know, they have had these incredible scandals and
incredible tragedies. Fatal car wrecks. Fatal shootings. Drug abuse. Sex
scandals. But through it all, somehow, some guy always miraculously turns up
that can run the hell out of that company.;     Q. Which do you think is the
worst scandal to plague them?;     A. The one that just stands out because it
still boggles the mind is Peter Busch -- a guy who is infatuated with guns.
Shoots himself in the leg practicing quick draws on the estate in St. Louis.
He blows the brains out of his best friend (in 1976), a kid by the name of
David Leeker.;    He was charged with manslaughter and pleads guilty to it. He
never serves a day in jail. As usually happens in the case of Busches after
great tragedies and great scandals, he winds up with a lucrative beer
distributorship down in Florida.;     Q. Do the Busches own the police in St.
Louis?;     A. That's one of the raps.;     Q. Well, you have that anecdote
about them stopping August IV in his Mercedes after shooting out his tire . .
.;     A. And they repaired the tire! Can you believe that? It's just
incredible!;    That trial was a hoot. I mean, here's the kid, August IV,
who's already involved in this fatal wreck out in Tucson. A Corvette flips
over. A young woman is dead. He's found in his condo. He doesn't remember the
accident. There's shades of Chappaquiddick all over again. He's never
prosecuted. He admitted that he was drinking before it happened, but they
couldn't prove that he was intoxicated at the time. That was in '83.;    In
'85 he's involved in this chase in the Central West End, an exclusive section
of St. Louis. They shot out his tire and they thought he was a drug dealer. .
. . He thought he was being kidnapped. But the fact remains, they charged him,
he stood trial. (He was acquitted.);     Q. It was also his kid that the
custody battle was over . . .;     A. No, that was Billy. How could you forget
about Billy -- who makes the Geraldo show, for Chrissakes? Here's Billy, who
was a brawler. Bit a guy's ear off in a barroom brawl.;     Q. It takes a lot
to bite an ear off . . .;     A. To his credit, he was provoked.;     Q. You
gotta be pretty provoked to bite somebody's ear off.;     A. "I was biting his
ear, your honor, and it just came off . . .";    He encounters this woman.
They have a child. Na-a-a-asty custody battle. They both admit doing drugs.
Billy admits to doing cocaine. It makes it to the Supreme Court of Missouri.
That never happens. Lo and behold, the Supreme Court rules -- surprise of
surprises -- that Billy should have custody of the child.;     Q. I gotta ask
you, what is the deal with Susan Busch and Harry Caray? You ever see Harry
Caray? It's pretty hard to believe.;     A. The lawyers went over this a whole
lot. A whooooole lot. And some stuff was deleted from the book that cannot be
discussed. But Susan, to her credit, she called me up. She wanted to respond.
And she said they were just rumors.;     Q. What was it like to be interviewed
by (former Cardinal player and broadcaster and Anheuser-Busch booster) Joe
Garagiola on the Today show?;     A. To me, if that is NBC's idea of
objectivity to have a guy who worked for the brewery interview me . . . I was
a little astounded.;    He wanted me to say that the Busches have done a lot
of good. "You gotta admit, don't you, Peter, the Busches have done a lot of
good things for St. Louis." And I said: "They have been good for St. Louis,
Joe. Of course. But they've been good for you too." That's how it ended.;    
Q. How did you manage to even write this book? You even mention in it that
there was a story about the custody battle that your newspaper once killed.;  
  A. They killed it and it made Newsweek. After that, (the paper) covered the
hell out of the thing.;    The Busches, they really tried to put up a wall. .
. . I'm sure that pressure was applied at a higher level to try to prevent
that book from being excerpted in the paper. But it was. It was a very, very
dicey time at the Post-Dispatch, and more than that I just cannot discuss with
you.;     Q. One last thing: What the hell is that beechwood aging?;     A.
There are these belt-sized strips of beechwood. We're talking big, big chunks
of beechwood that they put at the bottom of the tank. What it does, I haven't
the slightest idea.  </TEXT>
