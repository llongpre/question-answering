   A new tabloid hits the streets this fall,
offering St. Louis the prospect of an old-fashioned newspaper war.
   The established paper already has served notice it won't concede
so much as one reader to the upstart.
   Ralph Ingersoll II on Tuesday announced plans for a ``visually
dynamic'' paper called the St. Louis Sun. He said it will be
published seven mornings a week and will be competitive with the
111-year-old St. Louis Post-Dispatch from day one.
   ``The Sun will be profitable in the second year of its
operation, and it will continue to grow,'' he predicted. Ingersoll
Publications Co. publishes more than 40 daily newspapers and more
than 150 non-daily papers in the United States and Europe.
   The Post-Dispatch, owned by the Pulitzer family since its
inception, has been the city's only daily newspaper since the St.
Louis Globe-Democrat folded under financial strain in 1986.
   ``Competition is the way of life in the American system,'' said
Joseph Pulitzer Jr., Post-Dispatch chairman. But he added, ``We'll
beat the pants off them.''
   Ingersoll, chairman and chief executive of Ingersoll
Publications, will start his venture with the help of a top
Post-Dispatch executive, who resigned from that paper Tuesday
morning. Thomas M. Tallarico, 44, a senior vice president and
general manager of the Post-Dispatch since 1986, will be publisher
of the Sun.
   ``The Post-Dispatch's mission will remain the same, as will its
character,'' said Editor William F. Woo. ``Competition focuses,
competition sharpens and competition quickens. All of those things
are good _ for newspapers or any other business. But I am not
prepared to concede one single reader to Ralph Ingersoll.''
   Ingersoll would not divulge start-up costs but said the first
run of the newspaper will be 200,000 copies. He said the newspaper
could be profitable with a circulation of fewer than 100,000.
   Weekday paid circulation for the Post-Dispatch is about 378,000
with 554,000 copies on Sundays.
   ``It has been an old saw that big cities can really only have
one successful newspaper,'' Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr. said.
``I think a new sense of competitiveness, new technology and a new
aggressiveness in the media industry makes that old saw sawdust.''
   ``It can only help to have another public voice,'' said Charles
Klotzer, editor of the St. Louis Journalism Review. ``The big thing
is, are they going to get the big advertisers? But as a whole, it's
very encouraging.''
