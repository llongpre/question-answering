The St. Louis Sun, which hoped to be the first major metropolitan newspaper to 
make a successful launch in this country since World War II, unexpectedly 
folded Wednesday after only seven months. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Ralph Ingersoll II, editor-in-chief of the new newspaper, 
said the Sun had published its last edition Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Closing the Sun was a decision the St. Louis marketplace made for us," said 
Ingersoll. Since launching the paper Sept. 25, 1989, the newspaper had 
published 213 editions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that we could not achieve sufficient circulation to make this 
enterprise viable, and so we have concluded that there is no longer room in St. 
Louis for a third newspaper in addition to our own Suburban Journals and the 
Post-Dispatch." 
</P>
<P>
The Sun had struggled to overcome higher-than-expected costs, revolving-door 
circulation, limited advertising and a murky image.
