   The debut edition of the St. Louis Sun, the
nation's newest newspaper, began rolling off the presses on time
Sunday night with a front page featuring a bright sun rising over
the Gateway Arch.
   There was a last-minute rush to finish the final few pages, but
editors made their 9 p.m. deadline and the printing presses began
about a half hour later, a Sun spokesman said.
   Editor-in-chief Ralph Ingersoll II said the newspaper contained
four significant exclusive stories, including two copyrighted
stories. The media was barred from the newspaper's printing plant.
   The Sun's deadline, more than three hours earlier than usual,
was required to print 200,000 newspapers to meet the expected heavy
demand from the curious and people looking to pick up collector's
item.
   ``We'll be able to sell every paper, guaranteed,'' said Robert
Jelenic, president of the St. Louis Sun Publishing Co.
   The newspaper industry has been closely watching the launch of
the Sun, which is owned by the New Jersey-based Ingersoll
Publications Co., and is trying to buck the trend of newspapers
merging or shutting down.
   ``This newspaper will be successful if it's relevant. That's our
No. 1 priority,'' said Ingersoll, who is also chairman and chief
executive officer of Ingersoll Publications.
   Ingersoll and other Sun officials plan to ``hawk'' newspapers on
the street in front of the Sun's downtown offices Monday morning to
herald the newspaper's debut.
   The tabloid newspaper, which Sun officials are calling a
``laptop'' paper, already has been well-received in the St. Louis
area, having attracted nearly twice as many subscribers as
expected, Sun executives said Sunday.
   About 55,000 copies of the newspaper were to have been delivered
to charter subscribers early Monday morning, although that number
could have been higher, said Sun Publisher Thomas Tallarico.
   ``We had to stop promising first-day delivery because we
couldn't process the deluge of orders in time,'' Tallarico said.
``People will still get Vol. I, Issue I, they may just have to wait
till Tuesday.''
   Tallarico said officials had originally hoped to have a
circulation of 30,000 by the end of its first month of publication.
   The mood in the newsroom seemed remarkably subdued as editors
and reporters, 20 of whom have been borrowed from other Ingersoll
newspapers, completed the finishing touches of the debut issue
Sunday.
   ``I really do feel like we're making history, but we have to be
cautious not to blow all our energy in one day,'' said Bill
Theobald, assistant metro editor. ``Because we have to do this all
over again tomorrow and again and again and again.''
   Much of the newspaper had been pre-planned and pre-packaged,
leaving only sports and a few news stories until Sunday evening,
said Managing Editor Peter O'Sullivan.
   ``In many ways I think the pressure will be greater tomorrow
because we've been working toward this issue for months. Tomorrow
we'll only have one day, just like it's supposed to be,''
O'Sullivan said.
   The new paper will compete with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
which also publishes in the morning and will be 111 years old in
December. The Post-Dispatch has been the only daily newspaper in
St. Louis since the St. Louis Globe-Democrat folded in October 1986.
   The Post-Dispatch now has a daily circulation of about 380,000
and a Sunday circulation of about 565,000, said publisher Nicholas
G. Penniman IV.
