   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Thursday by the Supreme Court.
   
   CIVIL RIGHTS
   
   The court, which touched off an uproar last year by considering
reversal of a key civil rights decision, today upheld the 1976
ruling that has been a powerful tool to fight racial discrimination.
   The justices unanimouly reaffirmed that an 1866 law enacted to
help freed slaves could be used to sue private citizens accused of
race bias.
   But the court, by a separate 5-4 vote, also ruled that the
123-year-old civil rights law cannot be invoked to fight racial
harassment.
   The case is Patterson vs. McLean Credit Union, 87-107.
   
   STATES-CIVIL RIGHTS
   
   The court gave states and state officials sweeping new protection
from federal lawsuits accusing them of civil rights violations.
   In a 5-4 ruling in a case from Michigan, the court said they may
not be sued under an 1871 law that authorizes damages against
``persons'' who violate people's civil liberties.
   The case is Will vs. Michigan Department of State Police, 87-1207.
   
   REVERSE PATERNITY
   
   The court gave some legal help to any man trying to prove he
fathered the child of a woman married to someone else.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said states must give such men a
``fair opportunity'' to prove paternity and seek visitation rights.
   The case is Michael H. vs. Gerald D., 87-746.
   
   HANDICAPPED CHILDREN
   
   The court shielded states from federal court lawsuits by parents
seeking to enforce a federal law aimed at assuring adequate
education for handicapped children.
   The justices voted 5-4 to excuse Pennsylvania officials from
paying a year's private school tuition for a student with a learning
disability.
   The case is Dellmuth vs. Muth, 87-1855
   
   SUPERFUND
   
   The court ruled states may be forced, through private lawsuits,
to help pay for cleaning up hazardous waste sites targeted under the
so-called Superfund Act.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said the Constitution's Commerce
Clause gives Congress the power to strip state governments of their
constitutional immunity against private lawsuits.
   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Union Gas, 87-1241.
   
   INSURANCE TAXES
   
   The court resolved a tax dispute between the insurance industry
and the Internal Revenue Service in a decision dealing a significant
financial setback to many insurance companies.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that the ``ceding
commissions'' a life insurance company pays when reinsuring another
firm's policies may not be claimed as deductions for the year they
are paid.
   The case is Colonial American Life vs. Commissioner, Internal
Revenue, 88-396.
   
   FREEHOLDERS
   
   The court ruled unanimously that people who do not own property
may not be excluded for that reason from membership on a public body
empowered to recommed a reorganization of local government.
   The court declared unconstitutional the composition of the St.
Louis City-St. Louis County Board of Freeholders.
   The case is Quinn vs. Millsap, 88-1048.
