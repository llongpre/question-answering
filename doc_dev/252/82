   Few people could have been more shocked than
John O'Connor when the St. Louis Sun, the morning tabloid that made
its debut just seven months ago, went out of business.
   O'Connor joined the Sun's staff a little over a week ago _ just
long enough to rent an apartment and learn his way to work _ and
was out on assignment when the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Ralph
Ingersoll II, announced the paper's closure in the newsroom
Wednesday.
   ``I walked into a bar and I saw Ralph Ingersoll on TV,''
O'Connor said, standing outside his newspaper's downtown offices.
``I said, `That looks like my boss, I'm from the Sun.' They said,
`That is your boss, you're out of a job.'''
   O'Connor, who came to the Sun from the Bloomington (Ill.)
Pantagraph, was one of 194 full-time employees who were trying to
recover from the shock that the Sun is no more.
   Ingersoll, who is chairman and chief executive officer of
Ingersoll Publications Co. and has an interest in four other
newspaper holding companies, said his new tabloid couldn't generate
enough single-copy sales.
   ``It had nothing to do with money. It had to do, and you'll have
to take me at my word for it, with single-copy sales '' said
Ingersoll, who had moved to St. Louis to personally direct the rise
of the new paper.
   Ingersoll said the Sun had to sell most of its 100,000
newspapers via vending boxes or from racks in convenience stores
and on street corners in order to survive.
   Instead, it ended up with home-delivery sales outnumbering
single-copy sales two-to-one. That cost the paper, which spent in
excess of $25 million to start up, an unexpected $5 million.
   Home delivery costs are higher because of the expenses of
billing customers and hiring delivery people.
   Ingersoll decided Sunday night to stop the presses and make
Wednesday's newspaper, with the large, front-page headline
``Deathly Quiet,'' the Sun's final edition.
   After seven months and 213 editions, the newspaper's sudden
death surprised everyone.
   ``They read the handwriting on the wall .... The weather was
good, the Cardinals were playing, the Blues were playing and people
still weren't buying the paper. You don't have to be a brain
surgeon to figure it out,'' said Kevin Horrigan, a popular
columnist who jumped ship from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to join
the Sun.
   In Horrigan's old newsroom, Post-Dispatch Editor William Woo
said he was sorry about the demise of the Sun.
   ``The Sun undertook a difficult mission and made a valiant
effort, which fell short,'' Woo said.
   With a circulation of about 100,000, the Sun never threatened
the Post-Dispatch's huge circulation of 375,000 daily and 565,000
on Sunday.
   But it did manage to generate a fair share of controversy in
this conservative Midwestern city.
   The Sun was criticized by some as sensationalizing stories for
its coverage of a politician involved in a sexual assault and of
the five-year anniversary of an accident in which a man was nearly
sawed in two.
   The newspaper also was chided for running photos of new women's
swimsuits and lingerie.
   But the Sun was praised for its coverage of the effort to build
a new domed stadium downtown and of the troubles facing St. Louis'
major air carrier, Trans World Airlines.
   Ingersoll said he didn't know how much money he had lost on the
Sun. He said the decision to close had nothing to do with long-term
debt problems at another of his newspaper companies.
   ``They have nothing to do with each other. They are different
companies,'' he said.
   On Friday, an offer by Ingersoll to buy back much of the $240
million of junk bonds issued by his Community Newspapers, Inc.
failed to attract a single bondholder. If he can't arrange a
buyback, the interest rate on some of the bonds might have to be
reset at an exorbitant level of more than 26 percent in June.
   Ingersoll extended the offer until May 4 and Wednesday said he
was considering raising his offer.
   The St. Louis Sun was owned by Ingersoll Newspapers, Inc., which
also owns 77 other newspapers in seven states. Ingersoll also has a
stake in New Haven Newspapers, Inc., which owns the New Haven
Register; Ingersoll Publications Ltd., which owns 29 newspapers in
Great Britain; and Ingersoll Publications Co., which is a newspaper
management group.
