   The board of directors of Emerson Electric Co.
approved Monday the spin-off of its six defense-related
subsidiaries into a separate company called Esco Electronics Corp.
   The spin-off will allow Emerson to focus on ``faster growing and
more profitable commercial business,'' said Charles Knight,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   Also on Monday, Esco announced that the new company will not be
suspended from competing for U.S. government contracts. Emerson had
been under investigation by the U.S. Attorney's office in St. Louis
after the company pleaded guilty May 1 to making inflated cost
estimates for electronic equipment.
   The company was fined $14 million in fines and penalties.
   The investigation was not a factor in deciding to spin off the
defense subsidiaries, company officials said. Rather, Emerson
wanted to give the subsidiaries more freedom to compete in the
changing defense industry.
   Emerson's directors approved a stock exchange that will give
shareholders equity in the new company.
   Under the formula, which awaits Securities and Exchange
Commission approval, Emerson shareholders of record at the close of
business Oct. 5 will be eligible to receive one Esco share of
common stock for every 20 shares of Emerson common stock they own.
   The six former Emerson subsidiaries are: Electronics &amp; Space
Corp., St. Louis; Hazeltine Corp., Greenlawn, N.Y.; Rantee
Microwave and Electronics Corp., Calabasas, Calif.; Southwest
Mobile Systems Corp., St. Louis; Vacco Industries, South El Monte,
Calif., and Distribution Control Systems Inc., St. Louis.
   Emerson is the world's leading maker of electric motors. The
company also makes equipment for factory assembly lines, tools for
Sears, ceiling fans, garbage disposals, refrigerator compressors,
and uninterrupted power supplies for computers.
   Esco will be involved principally in developing, manufacturing
and marketing defense-related electronic products and systems,
including communications and radar equipment, automatic test
equipment and anti-submarine warfare equipment.
   Net sales for the six former Emerson subsidiaries making up Esco
totaled about $600 million, of about 8 percent of Emerson's overall
net sales of $7.1 billion, in fiscal 1989.
   Pre-tax earnings were about $15 million. Esco employs about
6,100 people.
