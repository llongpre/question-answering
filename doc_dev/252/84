   Debt-plagued East St. Louis, which
hasn't had regular garbage pickup for six months, faces fines of
$10,000 or more if the city does not clean up well enough by May 3,
officials say.
   Although state laws against illegal dumping and failure to
dispose of garbage apply to all property owners, the state's action
is aimed primarily at the city, St. Clair County Assistant State's
Attorney Jeff Hoffman said Wednesday.
   ``The main thrust of this is getting rid of a public health
problem,'' Hoffman said.
   Officials in this poverty-stricken riverfront city of 55,000
told state regulators that garbage pickup should resume Friday. And
they have budgeted $210,800 of federal community development funds
to have the backlog of garbage that has piled up taken care of.
   Ken Mensing, regional manager of the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency, said that if the cleanup doesn't go fast enough,
the city could face a state injunction, fines as high as $10,000
and penalties up to $1,000 per additional day of non-compliance for
each violation, he said.
   ``Just where we would draw the line, I don't know,'' Mensing
said. ``We haven't discussed it.''
   Mensing said he could not estimate the amount of garbage that
has accumulated in East St. Louis since regular garbage pickup
ceased in October because the city owed $262,000 to the private
company that it had hired to do the collecting. The company has
since sued the city.
   The only garbage hauling that has been done since then has been
in the form of volunteer drives, or work done privately by
companies hired by individual businesses and homeowners.
   Joseph Kurre, director of the East Side Health District, said
the onset of warm weather raises the specter of disease and
increased rat infestations caused by rotting garbage.
   Over the objections of Mayor Carl Officer, other city officials
recently contracted with another private company G. Corp. to do
trash pickup until December for $350,000.
   Officer continues to contend that the city cannot afford to pay
for the service and that property owners should pay private
companies to haul away their trash.
