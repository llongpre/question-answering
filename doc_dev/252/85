   Missouri has generally recovered from
the drought that crippled farmers, cities and towns two years ago,
but the river that bears its name hasn't been so lucky.
   Dry weather in the Dakotas continues to keep water in short
supply throughout the Missouri River basin, officials say. That
will cause rough traveling this summer for the river barges that
carry grain and fertilizer across Missouri.
   More significantly for the nation, the low water also could
cause problems for the commercially important Mississippi River.
   Complicating the issue is South Dakota's recent decision to file
a federal lawsuit sometime soon against the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to force it to keep more water in strapped reservoirs in
the north.
   The Corps says it will negotiate, but that doesn't reassure the
people responsible for drinking water in Kansas City and other
Missouri River towns.
   ``Everybody's going to suffer in some way,'' said Chet Worm,
chief of the reservoir regulation branch of the Corps in Omaha,
Neb. ``The people at the reservoirs up north are suffering now, and
the people downstream could be suffering later.''
   Tracy Mehan, director of the Missouri Department of Natural
Resources, said ``Things are going to be difficult. We're going to
have to tighten our belts in the area of drinking water and
navigation, no question.''
   Already, the Corps has shortened this year's navigation season
on the Missouri and told barge operators they must carry fewer tons
per barge.
   ``Essentially, besides losing about five weeks of the season,
they won't be able to carry as much cargo,'' Worm said.
   The Missouri carries only a fraction of the commercial cargo
carried on the Mississippi each year, about 2.4 million tons
compared to 75 million tons. But the restrictions still have a big
impact on the few companies that operate barge lines there.
   ``We charge by the ton, so if we carry fewer tons per barge, we
lose money,'' said Roger Blaske, co-owner of Blaske Marine Inc., of
Alton, Ill., which operates barges on both the Missouri and
Mississippi.
   But higher costs aren't his main worry.
   ``If they release less water, we may have to quit on the
Missouri altogether,'' Blaske said.
   The river is controlled by a series of six dams between Montana
and South Dakota, designed to control flooding in wet years and
maintain a stable river in dry years.
   South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson contends the small amount of
barge traffic traveling the 730 miles between Sioux City, Iowa, and
St. Louis doesn't justify the low water levels in his state's
reservoirs.
   Although the state of Missouri has received normal rainfall so
far this year, North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana each lacked
both winter snow and spring rains.
   Because of that, the Missouri river received only 80 percent of
its normal spring runoff. About 19.6 million acre feet of water
flowed into the river north of Sioux City, compared to the normal
25 million, Worm said.
   The low water levels have threatened city and rural water supply
systems, left boat ramps far from water's edge and prevented
irrigators from using water in the huge reservoirs, Worm said.
Farther south, about 1,400 boat slips between Sioux City and Omaha
are endangered.
   Mehan says he recognizes South Dakota's legitimate worries, but
says Missouri has water needs, too, and might enter the fight with
legal action.
   ``We would hope to be accommodating to their problem, but we
certainly have to draw the line somewhere,'' he said.
   Many Missouri cities and towns, including Kansas City, St.
Joseph and St. Louis, have improved their drinking water intake
systems in recent years, but that might not protect them if the
Corps cuts back the water flow, Mehan said.
   The effect the low Missouri will have on the Mississippi River
is another question, and a troubling one, officials say.
   ``The Missouri is going to be lower this year than it was last
year,'' said Ken Kruchowski, a spokesman for the Corps in St.
Louis. ``And we had major problems on the Mississippi last year.
We'll just have to wait and see.''
