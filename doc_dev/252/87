<P>
The Rams, who limped and sputtered through two exhibition games with makeshift 
lineups and few memories to speak of, had a coming out of sorts Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix Cardinals appeared ready to win until rookie Jeff Carlson's pass to 
Flipper Anderson went 45 yards for a touchdown with 20 seconds to play, giving 
the Rams a 23-20 victory. The Cardinals had previously taken a 20-17 lead on a 
37-yard field goal by Al Del Greco with 14:50 left in front of 39,666 fans at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rally, the Rams' first team, as it turns out, will not go the 
entire season without scoring a touchdown, ending a developing drama late in 
the first quarter on a one-yard run by Robert Delpino. 
</P>
<P>
At times both offense and defense sizzled. Sometimes both burned. But there was 
finally signs of life, most notably from a set of aging wheels belonging to 
LeRoy Irvin, a 31-year-old cornerback in search of a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin, who didn't have his best season in 1988 and is talking about retirement 
after this one, was suddenly young again. He finished a short night's work with 
two first-half interceptions. With 8:54 left in the first quarter, he stepped 
in front of a Gary Hogeboom pass and returned it five yards to the Phoenix 
26-yard line, setting up Delpino's scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin picked off another Hogeboom pass late in the half and returned it nine 
yards. Other first-half stories included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robert Delpino. The fifth-round pick of a year ago got his first real shot 
at the tailback spot with starter Greg Bell out of camp and Gaston Green 
hurting. Delpino, not the hometown bonus baby, figures he's going to have to 
turn some heads to win the job outright, and did his best to do just that. 
Delpino worked the first half and gained 44 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Everett. His numbers weren't the greatest, six completions in 16 
attempts, but he threw for 112 yards and a touchdown in his half of work. 
Everett started fast, connecting with Anderson for 46 yards on his first pass. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frank Stams. The rookie linebacker from Notre Dame made his first big 
impression, blocking a first-half punt that led to a Rams' touchdown 
</P>
<P>
The news wasn't all good, though. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams got a big scare with 10:07 left in the third quarter when backup 
quarterback Mark Herrmann was blindsided on a safety blitz by Phoenix safety 
Tim McDonald. The hit jarred the ball from Herrmann, and it bounded to former 
UCLA standout Jim Wahler, who raced 40 yards to the 10 before being dragged 
down by Richard Calvin. 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann remained on his back for several minutes after the play but left the 
field under his own power. He was taken by cart to the locker room, where it 
was determined Herrmann had a fractured rib on his left side. He's expected to 
be sidelined three to four weeks, which puts some heat on Carlson, who worked 
the rest of the game in relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, that's a big blow for us," Ram Coach John Robinson said about 
Herrmann's injury. "That's part of this game. You're never to the point where 
you have enough depth. He's had a good preseason, but his preseason's over 
now." 
</P>
<P>
But it's just beginning for the rookie Carlson, who threw the game-winning pass 
to Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a prospect," Robinson said. "He kind of goes out there and wings it. But 
there's prospect and NFL quarterback, and there's a lot of distance between the 
two." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals wasted little time taking advantage of the hit on Herrmann, 
scoring on the first down after the big play, when Lydell Carr ran 10 yards to 
tie the game, at 17-17. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams scored first with 5:42 left in the first quarter on a one-yard run by 
Delpino, capping a 26-yard drive after Irvin's first interception. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals drove from their 35-yard line to the Rams' four on their next 
possession after key passes of 22 and 14 yards from Hogeboom to the veteran Roy 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
But the drive was abruptly stopped by linebacker Kevin Greene, who sacked 
Hogeboom for an eight-yard loss on third and four at the Rams' four. The 
Cardinals settled for Del Greco's 29-yard field goal to cut the lead to 7-3 
with 13:50 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, led by Delpino and Everett, charged back. On first down, Everett's 
pass to Ellard worked for 26 yards to the Phoenix 39. Everett later completed a 
pass to Thomas Henley for 12 yards, but the drive stalled at the 22 and the 
Rams settled for a 39-yard Mike Lansford field goal to make it 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the special teams stepped in. Rookie Stams, the second-round pick from 
Notre Dame, broke through the line and blocked Rich Camarillo's punt at the 20, 
the ball rolling toward the end zone. Rams Clifford Hicks and George Bethune 
fought for control, with Bethune finally falling on the ball and rolling into 
the end zone for a touchdown with 9:43 left. That put the Rams ahead, 17-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals cut the lead to 17-10 with 1:12 left in the half on a one-yard 
run by Tony Jordan, capping a 65-yard drive that took only five plays, thanks 
to a 46-yard pass from Hogeboom to Robert Awalt on first down from the Phoenix 
35. 
</P>
<P>
Hogeboom, who signed with Phoenix as a Plan B free agent in the off-season, 
rebounded strongly after a weak performance in the Cardinals' exhibition opener 
against Seattle last week. In that game, Hogeboom threw three interceptions in 
the first half. Monday night, he completed nine of 14 passes for 150 yards in 
the first half, although he did give up the two interceptions to Irvin. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The agent for Ram holdouts Greg Bell, Robert Cox and Duval Love last spoke to 
Rams' management on Saturday and reported no progress in negotiations. "The 
Rams indicated to me that with my players out, they've had time to look at 
other players and were very pleased," Steve Feldman said Monday. Feldman added 
that it was never his intention to take advantage of his holdouts and the new 
80-player roster limit, which has made training camp even more difficult for 
the Rams. "The last thing any of the players wants to do is distract training 
camp in any manner." 
</P>
<P>
Kicker Mike Lansford, who signed a temporary one-year contract to get to camp 
on time, has been closely monitoring the negotiations of other kickers in the 
league. Detroit's Eddie Murray recently signed a three-year deal for $1.1 
million. New Orleans kicker Morten Andersen, who figures to set the standard 
for kickers, signed a four-year deal Monday. Though terms were not revealed, 
Andersen's deal reportedly could average about $500,000 per year with signing 
bonus and incentives. Lansford earned $195,000 last season. . . . Navy 
Tuiasasopo started at left guard for the Rams. He replaced eighth-round pick 
Warren Wheat (injured neck), who was filling in for starter Tom Newberry 
(hamstring). . . . Rookie Vernon Kirk, the team's ninth-round pick, started at 
tight end. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams play host to the Minnesota Vikings next Saturday night in the 44th 
annual Times/Rams Charity game at Anaheim Stadium. . . . Linebacker Mel Owens 
pinched a nerve in his neck in the first quarter but later returned. . . . 
Tailback Gaston Green, who is recovering from a bruised left thigh, was not in 
uniform Monday night. . . . Phoenix tight end Robert Awalt had injured ribs 
after taking a vicious hit from safety Jerry Gray after a 46-yard reception 
late in the first half. X-rays were negative, but Awalt did not return for the 
second half.
