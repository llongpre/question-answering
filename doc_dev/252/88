   Chrysler Corp., which admitted it had been "dumb" to disconnect the odometers of certain test vehicles, yesterday pleaded no contest to charges that its odometer tampering was criminal. 

   Chrysler also formally agreed to pay at least $16.4 million to settle most, but not all, of the civil litigation filed by states and individuals in the wake of revelations that some executives of the company would disconnect the odometers of new Chrysler cars, drive them as much as 400 miles, then sell the cars as brand new. 

   As previously reported, the $16.4 million settlement represents the total amount Chrysler has agreed to pay to owners of at least 32,750 cars, which had been driven with disconnected odometers prior to sale. 
The figure doesn't include any fines arising from the criminal case, or the cost of the extended warranties Chrysler has offered on affected vehicles. 

   Chrysler attorneys and representatives from the U.S. Attorney's office in St. Louis went before U.S. District Court Judge John F. Nangle yesterday morning to cement a plea bargaining agreement reached in negotiations during the past month. 

   A federal grand jury in St. Louis indicted the No. 3 auto maker and two executives in June on 16 counts of odometer fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud. 
The criminal charges provoked a rush of civil claims from states, charging that Chrysler violated their odometer fraud laws, and from customers who were angry at having paid new car prices for used cars. 

   In July, Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca called the odometer tampering "dumb" and offered aggrieved customers extended warranties, and in some cases, replacement vehicles. 

   Having done that, "it makes no sense to go to trial to defend that practice" of off-the-odometer test drives, a company spokesman said. 
When the judge agreed to drop all charges against the two executives, the company agreed to the no contest plea, according to Lewis Goldfarb, assistant general counsel to Chrysler Motors, the unit that builds and sells Chrysler vehicles. 

   Under the separate civil settlement, Chrysler will pay at least $500 to current owners of every vehicle that can be identified as having been involved in what Chrysler called its "Overnight Evaluation Program." 
The company's records, which go back only to 1984, show that at least 32,750 vehicles were driven with the odometers disconnected before being sold as new, said Missouri Attorney General William L. Webster. 

   The agreement, negotiated by Mr. Webster and a group of state attorneys general, is supported by forty-three states, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. 
Judge Nangle has also agreed to take jurisdiction of 13 federal class-action suits brought by individuals. 
Attorneys involved in the case said that likely will mean those cases will be settled on similar terms. 

   But Chrysler's troubles aren't over. 
Judge Nangle has scheduled a sentencing hearing for Feb. 19, and could impose additional criminal penalties, including fines up to $120 million. 

   In addition, Kentucky Attorney General David L. Armstrong said yesterday he will pursue his litigation against Chrysler in Kentucky courts despite the settlement. 
The Kentucky action charges at least 351 violations, and seeks civil penalties of as much as $7,000 per vehicle.
