   A former restaurant owner involved in
litigation over a $350,000 Mercedes-Benz Pullman car once owned by
John Lennon was sentenced Friday to 15 months in prison for money
laundering.
   Edward Murphy, 44, pleaded guilty in August to violating federal
currency reporting requirements. He admitted his girlfriend bought
cashier's checks at six St. Louis area banks to avoid reporting
transactions exceeding $10,000.
   Murphy, who once owned the American Cafe in St. Louis, was
sentenced by U.S. District Judge John Nangle.
   Murphy used the cashier's checks to wire $45,000 in April 1988
from Mercantile Trust in St. Louis to London as payment of legal
fees connected with the litigation, U.S. Attorney Stephen Higgins
said.
   Ownership of the car was being challenged by former Supremes
singer Mary Wilson.
   The car was sold by a repair shop in Basingstoke near London for
$3,750 in 1982, two years after Ms. Wilson and her ex-husband,
Pedro Ferrar, left it there for repairs.
   The car passed through several owners before Nick Miranda, a
former St. Louis used car dealer, bought it in December 1984. Ms.
Wilso won repossession of the car in 1988.
