<HEAD>EAST ST. LOUIS: cash bond.</HEAD>

   The inmate who beat DeBow was placed in the same cell even
though empty cells were available.
   Kuehn said the state had repeatedly warned the city its jail was
being operated unsafely. ``The city was in an indefensible
position,'' he said. ``(DeBow's attacker) was only the bullet. The
weapon was trained and held by the city.''
   Carr called the case ``the avalanche that broke the camel's
back. If not that, it would be something else.''
   East St. Louis has long suffered a rough, ugly reputation. Its
history of gangsters, gambling dens and gun battles in the streets
has been updated only in the particulars, especially in politics.
   Last year, for example, a candidate for alderman was arrested
hours before the polls opened for barging into a radio station and
threatening to shoot another candidate, the host of a call-in show.
Charges were dismissed.
   Since 1980, guilty pleas have been entered by a police captain
who took bribes, a sergeant who sold drugs, a precinct committeeman
who committed murder and a St. Clair County board member charged
with unlawful use of a weapon _ he shot at a man he mistakenly
thought stole his car, said County State's Attorney John Baricevic.
   Two of last year's mayoral candidates were convicted in years
past of extortion, and a third was found guilty of forging
government checks and mail fraud. One had also pleaded guilty to
trying to arrange another's murder.
   Gentry himself faces trial on charges of misusing city money to
buy campaign advertisements for Officer. Other charges are pending
against Officer's administrative assistant and a second man, a
convicted rapist and unsuccessful aldermanic candidate.
   The city denies allegations that some police go without cars or
radios or cope with equipment in dangerously poor repair. Baricevic
said some police have bought their own radios and detectives have
used their own cars.
   If a cop ``gets shot at, how does he get help? He doesn't,''
Baricevic said. ``If he tries to get away ... (in) some of the
cars, you've got to roll down the window to get out of the car.''
   Because of the ever-rising crime problem, state troopers were
called in two years ago to help fight gangs and armed bandits
preying on motorists.
   ``The public response was overwhelming,'' said Bob Fletcher,
state police spokesman. ``People would wave to them from windows.
It's like the vets from World War II coming into towns into France.
It's the kind of things that brings tears to a cop's eyes.''
   As of May 1, the state police had made 2,250 criminal arrests,
and robberies and gang activities are down, said Capt. Bobby Henry.
   The city has received other assistance. Operating on grants, the
East St. Louis Community Foundation established an alcohol
treatment center and school-work program, but the association
fizzled in 1987.
   Former U.N. ambassador Donald McHenry, an East St. Louis native
and a former chairman of the community foundation, said that
despite hard work from many residents and the outside aid, ``most
of it was probably wasted'' due to inappropriate programs,
corruption, inefficiency and poor coordination.
   A former foundation director offers another assessment. City
leaders, said Handy Lindsey, ``make their own rules about
everything. If you come to that community and are not prepared to
play by their rules, they run you out.
   ``Nobody seriously gives a damn about East St. Louis,'' Lindsey
said. ``I think people who run it give a damn about their own
personal fortunes.'
   Still, Lindsey and others agree hope lies along the riverfront.
Bonds have been issued to build a port, a waste recycling facility
and middle- and upper-income housing.
   But some are skeptical the project will even get off the ground.
   Because of deadlines and legal questions, there's ``very little
evidence (the projects) will come to fruition,'' said Barry
Freedman, executive director of Target 2000, a private economic
development firm.
   A management company has sued the city for breach of contract,
alleging that a man acting for Officer tried to solicit a $500,000
finder's fee and, when no money was paid, the company was illegally
dropped from two riverfront projects.
   Even if Officer's plans fail, Freedman is confident the
riverfront will be developed. He mentioned other plans for
rejuvenation, including a proposal to extend a St. Louis park
across the river and make a national park.
   Freedman admits that promoting the city isn't easy.
   ``People tend to discount it automatically,'' he said. ``Once
they get past it, they're surprised at what they find. ... The
perception is worst than the reality.''
