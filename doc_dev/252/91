<HEAD>St. Louis County Residents Vote Against Dioxin Incinerator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's plan to build a dioxin
incinerator at Times Beach was dealt at least a minor setback by
St. Louis County residents voting on an advisory referendum
Tuesday.
   The vote, with 60 percent of the ballots counted, was 95,845
against building the incinerator and 81,708 in favor.
   Opponents of the incinerator, who sponsored the non-binding
referendum, hoped that a resounding `no' vote would convince state
leaders, particularly Gov. John Ashcroft, to stop the project.
   The incinerator would burn dioxin-tainted soil from Times Beach
and 27 other eastern Missouri sites. Opponents say it would be
unsafe in a heavily populated area such as St. Louis County and
that it should not be built in a flood plain.
