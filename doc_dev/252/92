   Energy Secretary John Herrington was asked
Wednesday to halt rail shipments of radioactive waste from the
Three Mile Island nuclear plant until a new study can be made of
the route by which they are transported.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., ranking minority member of the Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, made the request in
the wake of an incident involving a TMI train in the St. Louis area
earlier this month.
   Herrington took the senator's request under consideration, a
Danforth aide said.
   The Federal Railroad Administration confirmed on Wednesday it is
investigating a rail car switching incident on Feb. 9 just before a
TMI train passed through St. Louis. The agency is determining
whether there were violations of rail regulations, which could draw
civil penalties of up to $10,000.
   The train was carrying casks of radioactive wastes from the
damaged TMI plant in Pennsylvania to a government laboratory in
Idaho.
   Bill Loftus, an FRA spokesman, said the possible violations
involve mislabeling of a covered hopper car, which was added to the
TMI train in a railyard in East St. Louis, Ill.
   The car carried a placard stating that it contained a flammable
material, but later was found not to be carrying the dangerous
cargo.
   Loftus said the investigation is looking at possible violations
by the rail switching yard, the Union Pacific Railroad which
operated the train after it left the yard and a lime company that
was shipping the car.
   Federal rail regulations, Loftus said, require shippers to
properly label goods being moved by rail. Regulations also prohibit
switching yards from offering mislabeled cars for addition to a
train and railroads from transporting any improperly labeled
freight.
   Herrington met on Wednesday with Danforth and several other
senators from states along the TMI rail route. The Missourian wants
the Energy Department to halt the waste shipments until the
Transportation Department can study the rail route used by the
Energy Department to move the materials to the laboratory in Idaho
Falls, Idaho.
   Since the shipments began in 1986, Missouri officials have
complained that the government's route takes the radioactive
materials through densely populated cities such as St. Louis.
