   A federal jury in St. Louis found a drug manufacturer and two former drug company executives guilty of making and marketing a vitamin supplement linked to the deaths of 39 infants. 

   The jury found Ronald M. Carter and Larry K. Hiland guilty of conspiracy and violations of the federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act for their part in making and marketing E-Ferol Aqueous Solution, a high-potency intravenous vitamin E supplement used in the treatment of a disease that can cause blindness in premature infants. 

   Carter-Glogau Laboratories Inc., which Mr. Carter founded and headed and which manufactured E-Ferol, was also found guilty of the charges. 
The laboratory, now known as Retrac Inc., is an inactive subsidiary of Revco D.S. Inc., a Twinsburg, Ohio, company that sought protection from creditors earlier this year under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. 

   Steven Kowol, an attorney for Mr. Carter and Retrac, said it is likely they will appeal the verdict. 
Mr. Hiland couldn't be reached for comment. 
Mr. Kowol said that the maximum fine the Revco unit faces in the case is about $130,000, and that Messrs. 
Carter and Hiland each face a maximum sentence of about 40 years in jail. 
In a filing earlier this month with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Revco also said it faces lawsuits over E-Ferol in Washington and Texas. 

   According to a study by the federal Centers for Disease Control, 39 babies in 11 states died after receiving E-Ferol between October 1983 and March 1984. 
A second study attributed the deaths of 21 babies at five hospitals to a fatal syndrome caused by the supplement. 
E-Ferol was voluntarily recalled in April 1984. 

   Federal prosecutors charged that the two former executives made and sold EFerol solution knowing it could be toxic or fatal to premature infants. 
During the two-month trial, a number of physicians and pharmacists testified that they believed the solution's packaging that said E-Ferol was safe. 

   "Basically we proved what we alleged," said federal prosecutor Eugene M. Thirolf Jr., who is a member of the Justice Department's office of consumer litigation. 

   The infant deaths linked to E-Ferol prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1986 to tighten up its reporting requirements for makers and marketers of prescription drugs. 
E-Ferol didn't have FDA approval when it was sold. 
The manufacturers said such approval wasn't required because the supplement closely resembled other vitamin supplements marketed legally since before the FDA's creation in 1938. 

   During the St. Louis trial, federal prosecutors said Carter-Glogau rushed to make E-Ferol at the request of James Madison, a former vice president of O'Neal, Jones and Feldman Inc., a St. Louis distributor headed by Mr. Hiland. 
The distributor wanted to market the drug before a competitor could sell its own vitamin E supplement. 
In all, prosecutors said O'Neal Jones &amp; Feldman shipped some 26,000 vials of E-Ferol to hospitals and doctors around the U.S. 

   Mr. Madison, who was indicted in the original federal complaint, pleaded guilty to one count of fraud and two counts of misbranding and was a federal witness during the trial. 

   O'Neal, Jones &amp; Feldman, which was also included in the original federal indictment, was severed from the case. 
The company, now an inoperative shell owned by several principals in the New York investment firm of Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corp., has entered a guilty plea which is pending before the federal court in St. Louis. 
Dyson-Kissner-Moran officials declined to comment.
